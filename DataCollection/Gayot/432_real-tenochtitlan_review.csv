And this is not typical. I've only gotten the moles, and it's probably all I'll ever get here. I order mole wherever I can (which isn't often enough), and so far nothing has compared to Real Tenochtitlan. Part of it is the tortillas - they're housemade and outstanding.

Their chiles en nogada when they have them, are out of this world. Their tilapia with poblano sauce is the type of dish that I sometimes, out of the blue, crave. Their moles are divine. Make sure you get the tasting (and ask for tortillas to scoop up little bowlfuls of the stuff. Each one is so different and flavorful. They're like tasting wine, with layers of flavors and scents. So yummy. Their drinks are great and it's usually pretty easy to get a table, which worries me. I'm sure the decor (very bright and ummm, featuring kind of risque art) and cavernous location has made this place less than desirable as a favorite for dates, but I think people should be more appreciative of this place.

So this place is under new ownership and the old chef/owner flew the coup but his mole recipes were apparently left behind because they are still outstanding. I had the rack of lamb with black mole and mash potato and it was amazing. The meat was only mid quality but i knew that based on price ($22) and it didnt really matter because the mole was so good.  Portion size was excellent. My buddy had the enchiladas and he said they were excellent. We also had the sopes appetizer and it was very solid.  Chips and salsa are provided free of charge and are nothing special. Margaritas were pretty bogus and weak.  They need to step their game up in this department.  Service was fine, not outstanding nor poor.   Im a fan of this place and hope it can stick around.

2013-01-23,1.0,"There were multiple problems with this restaurant.  My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant on a Friday evening.  We had a youswoop certificate that was purchased in mid-October so we decided to try something new.  We arrived and were greeted by a sign indicated that as of October 2012, they are under new management and no longer accepting/redeeming Groupons/LivingSocial/Youswoop/etc.  I explained to the individual that 1) there was nothing on their website about this, I checked ahead of time; and 2) I purchased this after their alleged change of management, so they should call youswoop and complain. We decided to eat there anyways. The food was not good.  I did not think that anyone could mess up Mexican, but I was wrong.  I had the chicken fajitas and the tortillas tasted like olives and the fajita meat and vegetables weren't seasoned or fully cooked.  It was not good. While we were waiting for our food, the table behind us handed us a coupon that they had for the restaurant and indicated they saw the ordeal we went through, they had gone through the same thing so hopefully we could use their coupon from the restaurant. We took one coupon off that we were going to use.  While we were eating, another couple came in with a Groupon, went through the same ordeal, etc.  So we offered them one of our unused coupons, but the told us the host at the door had handed the coupons to them when they came in.  Apparently, every table except ours had received these when they entered.  We chalked it up to an oversight. I would not recommend eating here.  I don't really believe their alleged change in management, since their business cards, menu, credit card receipt, and website all indicate that the same name, Real Tenochtitlan, but they claim to be Tenochtitlan.  Regardless of the semi-shady business practices, the food was not good.  In Logan Square there are plenty of good restaurants to eat at, I suggest going to a different one.",-0.8342,0.891,0.037,0.072,0.3786561264822134

It was really spacious and they were smart enough to spread the tables out so you never had the sense you were on top of another table. Service was outstanding! Our server was wonderful about coming back, but not being overly obtrusive. He offered great recommendations and even brought my daughter over a balloon. The whole experience was very homey and warm.  Our sangria was dangerously delicious, a recommendation of the server. I wanted a mole, but couldn't decide which one so I went with another recommendation - the leg of lamb. This is far from my typical order, but I figured what the heck. It was so good. The depth of flavors in the mole was incredible. The lamb was nice and tender, not overcooked or overly fatty.  In addition, I have to measure a Mexican restaurant on the quality and freshness of their salsa. Real Tenochtitlan passed with flying colors. Both salsa varieites offered had very different, distinctive, fresh flavors.  On top of the whole experience, they gave us a 25% off coupon with our bill and told us we could use it right then and there - unheard of!

2012-11-18,1.0,"Never thought one could screw up Mexican food so badly.  My buddy and I entered this place around 6:30 on a Saturday night and were stoked to see only a couple tables were taken so we could get right in.  The fact nobody was in there during dinner time on a Saturday night probably should've been a sign but whatever, we were hungry.  We were seated right away which was the only highlight of the night. They brought out what had to be store bought chips that were stale and salsa that was as bland as can be and that was a good 10 minutes of waiting.  Again, we were one of 3 tables there.  We were hungry so we wanted to get a side of beans and cheese to use on our store bought chips.  The waiter said ""um I don't think we have that"" as he thumbed through the menu with no clue.  How the hell are you a Mexican restaurant and you don't offer a side of beans and cheese I'll never know.  Whatever.  We both ordered enchiladas with the red sauce.   30 minutes later, something appears on plates in front of us.  There's Spanish rice with cucumbers in it, black beans that were meh and then the worst looking enchiladas with ""red sauce"" I've ever seen.  I honestly didn't have any idea what food it was I ordered.  The sauce looked and tasted like it was a barbecue sauce concoction hybrid.  This was absolutely the weirdest tasting sauce I've ever had.  My friend said ""it tastes like how a head shop smells"" which strangely enough was very accurate.  We took 3 bites had to throw it aside.  The waiter checked on us and asked if everything was alright.  We simply said we will pay for the food but it was terrible and we'd like to go because we have someplace to be.  His next response?  ""Would you like a to go box?""  lol.  Wow.  He left and came back saying the kitchen can make us something else but even if we had the time to eat something else, there's no way in hell we're going to try another mystery dish trying to pass as authentic Mexican food.   Service was slow, food was terrible.  Will never be back.",-0.6568,0.801,0.093,0.106,0.4823511904761905

2012-09-19,4.0,"This is definitely a Mexican restaurant to try in the Logan Square area when you want something a little nicer than your typical $2 per taco meal.  My friend and I came on a Tuesday night for dinner, and we were surprised that there was only one table occupied in the whole restaurant.  The room is very open and spacious, and I totally appreciate the tall ceilings.  Even if you did come at a busy time, you would have your privacy and not have to hear your neighboring table's conversation.  We were greeted warmly, and given ample time to look over the menu.  The prices are very reasonable for a nicer Mexican restaurant.  $12 for fajitas.  $16 for specialty moles with your choice of meat.  There were a few inconsistencies with their online menu and the restaurant menu, so I hope they work that out soon.  Prices were actually a few dollars cheaper for a lot of items at the restaurant. On to the food: We were bummed that they were out of the appetizer ""Sopes Surtidos"" we wanted to try because it sounded delicious, so we'll have to save it for next time.  My friend enjoyed her combo chicken and steak fajitas with rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream, and I enjoyed my pork in negro mole sauce. My pork was a little too dry and charred for my taste, but the generous amount of negro mole on the plate made it all better.   We were given fresh, warm, home-made tortillas, which we requested two rounds of refills since they were so good!  The tortillas are chewier and slightly thicker than store bought tortillas, so it's really a matter of preference if you like that; we sure did.  If you are interested in their fantastic selection of moles, there is an option to get a mole tasting for $4.  Totally worth it.  The server explained that they give you four ramekins of the different moles in case you don't know which one to choose for dinner, but we just ordered them with our meal to be able to taste all the flavors.  They were all delicious!  Her favorite was the verde mole - which tastes like tomatillo salsa, and finally chose the negro as my favorite because the 28 ingredients they add make it so deliciously complex, and not easily replicated. Unlike any mole I've had.  The other two are on the sweeter side, but still so good. Dessert included the Nevado de Chocolate - which was a fabulous warm gooey chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla icecream on top that started melting and made it look like a little volcano.  It's big enough to share, but after you try it, you won't want to share anymore.   I wanted a coffee, and the server suggested a Cafe Olla, which is coffee with brown sugar, cinnamon and orange zest.  Absolutely delicious and a must try!  DECOR: It is a Mexican restaurant so it is supposed to be colorful - so the guy complaining that it looks like a Chinese buffet is just wrong. There wasn't any 80's wallpaper, moving pictures, nor neon lights, so I really don't know what he is talking about.   The walls are colorful, but the tables have a neutral beige tablecloth, and their beautiful hand carved wooden chairs balance out the color scheme.  To all the people complaining about the art:  GET OVER IT!  I am not Mexican, but I happen to love all of the bold, colorful paintings in the restaurant.  Yes, they have topless women in them, but they are very tasteful.  Are you same people complaining about Michelangelo's David?  What do you tell your kids about that or other art with nudity?   Better yet, don't bring your kids!  Parents should have the common sense to not take their kids to places that don't have a kids menu. Adults want to enjoy their evening without little rug rats screaming and crying all night.  This place is much better suited for a date night, birthday celebration, or girls night out.",0.9992,0.763,0.209,0.028,0.5096557120500782

I'll start with the good points: Handmade corn tortillas (but only served about 4) Location Sidewalk Patio Service seems to be inconsistent judging by the reviews.  The server that took care of me was a very nice guy, came around often, and was pleasant. On to the negatives: Decor - hanging on the wall immediately to the right as you walk in, hangs an enormous painting of a Mermaid endowed with with beautiful breasts and in full sight for all, including any prepubescent teen to store in in his spank bank.  On the left wall, hangs an equally large painting of an Aztec Pyramid also featuring a bare chested woman, Aztec Warrior Princess to be exact... I'm going out on a limb and say that this place is not kid friendly, at least not for my 10 year old son who I'm glad I didn't take this evening.  So imagine my surprise when I walked into the men's room and was greeted with a life size nude Aztec woman staring right at me (photos in the restaurant gallery) BTW, I'm pretty sure the Aztecs didn't practice Brazilian waxing, but I digress. The walls are bright yellow with an odd blue strip on one side, red strip on the other.  The rear features a fluorescent green accent wall.  All of these are further enhanced by the orange curtains draping down on both sides of the dining room. I'm sure this place was a Chinese Buffet in a former life. Drinks -  $8 for a 6oz Margarita which was mediocre. Appetizer -   First basket of Chips and Salsa is ""on them"", second one is on ""you"" for $2. I opted for the ""Seviche"" (as it was misspelled on the menu).  It had some strange brown fish in it and olives.  I've never had ceviche with olives, but oh, well.  I had to ask for a menu to find out what type of fish it was made with, and apparently it was Marlin.  The ceviche didn't really taste like seafood, the texture of the fish was a little too slimy for my palate.  (cue the ""that's what she said"" joke) Entree -  I ordered the mole, since this is what seems to be their specialty.  I opted for the Pollo en Mole Verde.  The mole itself was very tasty!  However, I have a very strong suspicion that the chicken came from one of those pre-grilled packets of chicken and then warmed up in a microwave.  It was way too juicy and watery for it to have come from a grill. When the bill came, I pulled up my $50 Groupon, as just about every other customer in the joint was doing and handed it over.  The server seemed a little disappointed, maybe thinking he wouldn't get a good tip?  I tipped 20% as I usually do for good service on a Groupon and swore never to return again, unless of course I catch the transformation on Restaurant: Impossible.  Normal prices on entrees range from $14 - 18+",0.9652,0.882,0.083,0.034,0.5148076923076923

We started with the ceviche which sounded delicioius on the menu, but had definitely been sitting in its juices for more than a few hours, losing any texture or flavor it once had.  Then I had to try the reknowned mole, with pork.  The mole was indeed very tasty, but the meat was underdone.  I know these days that pork doesn't have to be cooked to hell, but this was just barely past raw in the middle.  My favorite thing was the cucumber mojito--this was perfect for a smoldering day, and not overly sweet like some cocktails can be. What made this whole experience just weird is that the restaurant was close to empty, but it took forever for our server to come.  Then when he did, he wanted us to order drinks, apps, and dinner all at the same time.  Then he stood around awkwardly when we told him we would like to take our time.  In his defense, he seemed pretty young, and I think the management needs to provide him with better training.  To boot, I thought the decor was kind of half-assed.  I love those authentic carved wooden chairs and brightly colored huge paintings to create a look of modern authenticity!  Unfortunately, the yucky red carpet and stained drop ceiling in the front of the restaurant just killed whatever classy look they were going for.  (My husband, an electrician, couldn't help but be annoyed by the weird mix of table and hanging lamps--some ugly antique, some from Ikea, and some random plastic things) I really hate to be hard on a place that has some good things going for it, but this just did not hit the spot for me.  There is potential, and I hope they work out some of the decor and service issues.  Also, they need to decide if they are going to be fine-dining and fix the food, or down-home Mexican, and adjust their prices",-0.8112,0.729,0.125,0.146,0.5962126068376069

Our table decided to share a pitcher of white sangria.  Please save yourself the 30 something-dollars to avoid having to experience this watered down, bland concoction.  Considering sangria is made using the worst possible wine you can find, I felt very ripped off. The chip situation is interesting.  Your first serving is free, but afterwards you are charged $2.  The sauces for dipping the chips were tasty (I preferred the green tomatillo), but we also were in the mood for guacamole.  It was nicely spiced, but a little too thin for my liking. For a main course, I ordered the vegetable fajitas.  I received a giant portion of sizzling bell peppers, onions and squash, along with flour tortillas, rice, and beans.  The preparation and seasoning of the fajitas were fine.  One thing I still fail to understand is why my Mexican friends make such fantastic rice to go with their dishes, yet every single Mexican restaurant I have been to thus far prepares the blandest, most tasteless rice.  (Think: The kind you eat when you have a stomach virus or are too hungover to stomach anything else.) Our waiter came around with dessert menus, but we were all too full for dessert, plus the options did not seem particularly appealing.  Although I left dinner full and satisfied, I didn't find anything that made the restaurant special or worthy of a repeat visit.  And so it was onto the next Mexican restaurant on the list...",0.9834,0.811,0.138,0.05,0.5292468760553868

My family dined on guacamole and the chips and salsa for starters, and we loved it. I ordered a Paloma and it was delicious. Not too strong, but still had it's kick. Our entrees were varied; we tried the fajitas with carne and camarones, the coctel de camarones, enchiladas, and the carne asada. The flavors were subtle, not overpowering like at other restaurants I've tried. The carne was a little dry, but still good. The salsa over the enchiladas was a little sweet, but it gave the chicken and the cheese a different taste. The deserts were good too, my parents enjoyed the crepes con cajeta.

Well, we ate and had an extra dessert so I knew we would get charged. The waiter brings us the bill and its $34.75 ($47.75 prior to the discount): FOR A DESSERT?! So I look it over and he was only subtracting $13 from the tab with the coupon I brought it - IT ORIGINALLY COST ME $18! (Did I just pay more money by using a coupon?) Anyway, after talking to him for 10 minutes, the waiter, with an attitude, states ""what I COULD do for you is subtract both entrees."" WTF!? So now he actually took out the original $18 I had paid. (At least, I broke even - I GUESS).  At this point I'm thinking, I'm going to ask for it back - pay the bill, get a refund and trash this place THROUGHOUT THE INTERNET AND EVERY OTHER REVIEW MEDIUM! As I walk away from the waiter to put on my coat, he walks towards me and says he was able to subtract both entrees, both drinks but would still need to charge me for two desserts: I end up still upset but what could I do, I end up paying roughly $25 dollars (that's $12.50 per dessert). Now for the food, the Bloody Mary's taste like coctel de camaron (minus the shrimp), HORRIBLE. Ordered the breakfast burrito, that was BIG but taste exactly like the Mickey D's breakfast burrito (and is 5 times as expensive). The enchiladas (egg and steak) were not the best; however, they are being held up to my mothers standards - that lady can cook! The dessert.. The crepes with cajeta I had were one of the best I've had but MOST DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $12.50. The wife had a chocalate cake with a scoop of ice cream, the cake was too chocolatey, overly sweet - only half was eaten.  All in all, I would not recommend this to even my worst of enemies. This place if SUPER OVER PRICED and their Bloody Mary's make you want to gag. The waiter has no idea about the Groupon Deals or YouSweep deals which makes me wonder why even have them.

2012-03-09,1.0,"First off, I'm only giving this place one star because they had very good service.  I'm not the type of person to send my food back, but I sent it back twice.  First, let me start off by saying that I have traveled all over Mexico and experienced all different types of Mexican food - D.F., Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, Zacatecas, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Baja, San Luis Potosi, Quintana Roo, Guanajuato, Nuevo Leon, Tlaxcala, Quintana Roo to name a few so needless to say, I think I have a lot of experience eating Mexican food and knowing flavors of Mexican food. I ordered the enchiladas verdes - worst green salsa I have ever tasted.  It had a taste so strong and overwhelming of clove that I couldn't taste anything else (I actually like the taste of clove when used appropriately.)  I had my husband try it to make sure I wasn't being overly sensitive and he said it was the most disgusting think he's ever tried.  (My husband is from Mexico, BTW.) We told the waiter and he suggested I try the enmoladas, so I did.  For a place that promotes themselves on their mole, the mole was eeeehhh, ok at best.  Again, very heavy on the clove.  I have seen my grandmother make mole from scratch and I've probably tried a ton of different moles in Mexico and I know there are hundreds of varieties of mole and I know the one thing that makes a good mole is a complexity of layered flavors.  Not an overpowering taste from one ingredient.  So I was not a fan of the mole, but the worst part of the enmolodas was the chicken inside of them was hard as a rock - like chicken jerky.   Needless to say they gave me three enmoladas and I took perhaps three bites of one.  At that point, I didn't even want to eat anything else and I just wanted to go home.  My husband had the carne asada and I tried it and we both thought it was pretty good.  I must say, hands down, the worst Mexican food I've ever had in Chicago and I'm generally not a picky person.  In a city filled with Mexican food, most corner taco joints are better than the food here. The waiter was very nice and accommodating and did not charge us for my food and that is the only reason there is one star up there.",0.9748,0.817,0.119,0.064,0.5855432098765432

I grew up on Mexican food and paying high prices for it was never my thing, until now. Now for the meal. I had the enMoladas (Enchiladas with Mole). Mole is a mexican staple that can be made in about 200 varieties, maybe more. This Mole was done so well, I called my mother and told her I found my new love. The flavor was exquisite and had my mouth begging for more. Oh yeah, there were two others with me for dinner. They had the Fish Tacos, which were the most juicy and flavorful Fish tacos I've ever tasted, and the Pork in Salsa Verde, which was the best salsa verde I had tasted in decades (since I was a kiddo).  Oh yeah, our waiter brought out a flight of Mole (yes, a flight of Mole) like it was some kind of fine wine or beer. I know why now! These Moles were outstanding, each in their own delicious way.  I did have one gripe with this ""almost perfect"" experience. We all had the Margaritas. Of course, if you go to a Mexican restaurant, you have to have the Margaritas. Unfortunately, this one let us down. it was way too sweet and not done quite right by their mixologist. Having a bar tending background, I strongly suggest changing their recipe. My dinner would have been rocked to my core had the Margaritas been done well.  Btw, the service was great. Our waiter was extra attentive and very instructional. he guided us through the meal and even talked us into dessert (well, that really didn't take much effort considering our meal was so delicious). We had two of their desserts and shared (what a mistake, I should have ordered my own, they were so delicious). Overall, the food is fantastic. The service great. The decor is very warm and inviting.

The salsa and chips were kinda low quality; I've seen better chips and salsa, and it seemed watered down.  We did get the shrimp appetizer and that seemed okay.  The food took awhile and when we got it, it was hot, but it seemed a bit overcooked.

Anyways, the kicker here was that they 1) forgot who had given them the coupon, which tells me that they do not care about the person that eats there. 2) They said that since a coupon is being used, it would be cash only since they lied and stated that it was on their coupon.  He also mentioned that it is because no one wants to pay the 5%.  My advise to the restaurant is if you don't want to pay, then don't advertise on the sites.  Obviously, since we did not have a copy, and it was getting late on a Sunday, I did not want to argue and thankfully our brother-in-law had cash.  But I it kept bugging me since I know  restaurant.com  is usually clear with these things so when I checked at home, I saw that was not the case.  So if a restaurant is lying to you about something as little as that, then what else could they be lying about with their food?   Trust me when I say that I will never go back or recommend this place.",0.2746,0.831,0.082,0.087,0.46608187134502915

The flavors are delicious and complex. The first time I went I tried the sampler of Moles and they were all fantastic. Those alone made the meal. The chips and salsa were flavorful and had 2 salsas that were different than most salsas you get at a Mexican restaurant.  Other than the Mole, the meal was incredibly average. The vegetables were bland as was the rice. Not underseasoned but not seasoned at all. The guac was good but for $9 the portion was tiny. The flan was average and not unique.

Good limeade.  Nice server.   I wasn't blown away with my dish - actually was a bit disappointing.  At the last minute, I switched to the chicken tacos (a regrettable decision), which came with a small round tortilla shell filled with beans (weird), a cut up chicken breast, a tiny lettuce leaf with a scoop of guac.  no rice, no sour cream, no salsa - it was lacking, big time.  The chicken was too salty.  I shared tortillas with another diner who ordered the much better looking fajitas.   My group split the plantain / caramel crepes for dessert.  Again, a little disappointing.  The crepes were good, and the caramel sauce was awesome - but there were not many plantain pieces and there was no ice cream or other compliment that could have really added to the dish.

We started with the Sopes appetizer.  They were so cute and soooo good!  They included a guacamole sope, a chicken and mole sope, a platanos (sweet fried plaintain) sope and a chorizo with black bean sope.  WOW were they yummy - I think I could have probably eaten two orders of these with some rice and called it a night!  I wish they sold them full sized they were so good!!!  The sope themselves were soft (you could cut through them with a fork) and the fillings were all very tasty.  I also appreciate that there were options for those who may not have wanted meat.   I had the Enchiladas Indigenas and my BF had the Carne Asada.  My enchiladas were filled with potatoes, mushrooms and cheese, topped with two salsas and a salad.  Served with a side of rice.  Holy Cow was it delicious!  That salad something in the dressing (which was a little on the citrusy almost bitter side) was so good - I couldn't get enough of it.  The sauce was a little spicy - ok my lips were burning, but man I couldn't stop eating.  But it was so much food, I could only eat 1 of the 3 enchiladas.  I was stuffed.   So, on to my BF's dish.  The carne asada was served with a side of black beans (he said he wished it also had rice - so I shared mine) and some guacamole, and a generous portion of platanos and a side of freshly made tortillas.  The meat portion seemed a bit small, but the BF didn't complain, he just gobbled it up.  He pretty much ate everything on his plate...but also commented on how full he was - which is a pretty bold statement cause this guy can eat!! We had an Amazon certificate that included dessert, so we took it to go... had we paid regular price - I believe we would be looking at about $70 (not including tip) for 2 margaritas, one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert.  I do think it's a bit pricey - as do others.  And the service was a little slow here and there.  But overall,  I thought the place was very nice and the food was really good.   I will probably give them another try even if it's just for those sopes - they were really good!!!",0.9989,0.764,0.21,0.026,0.5717051282051283

The tortillas were dry and brittle and the serving dish was about 85% green peppers.

The mole sauce was good but the baby rack was minuscule and offered very few bites of meat. The mashed potatoes came in a small dollop in size and served in a tiny taco-like dish. For $21, they should give you a pound of mash since the main portion is so unsatisfying. Much like the same dish offered at Salud Teq lounge. Add on top of this a $25 pitcher of okay mango margaritas and fresh guac and the bill was tipping the scales. Thank you Groupon!  Highlights; my company, the ever so awesome Allison V. Margaritas could have been stronger but the winner was the taste of the mango in it, we both almost thought they used the real stuff to make them. Also the fresh guacamole which was made table side. Also the bevvy of beautiful cleavage.  I'm not sold on the place, but being the promising atmosphere and possibility of the decor and surroundings, I'd probably stop by again in the summer and see what events might take place. Also, I want to explore their desserts menu!",0.9967,0.753,0.204,0.043,0.49759856630824373

There were two other tables with people at them when we arrived, but we didn't care. We were given complimentary chips and salsa along with water. They have a their own salsas, the one I like was a green tomitillo with a sweetness to it. They made guacamole table-side which was good. The Mango Margarita was decent. The entrees were so-so. There was not a lot of flavor and everything seemed kind of bland.  The service was great!  Our waiter...Alredo was friendly and did a great job. I don't know if I will go back.

2011-04-03,2.0,"The food is decent but not worth the price, especially in Logan Square. For $14,I had the enoladas, which was chicken in mole sauce, wrapped in tortillas and topped with chihuahua cheese. I asked the waiter if it came with anything else, like rice, he nodded and wrote it down, it turns out it didn't. Not for their ""small entrees,"" but I didn't find that out until the bill came around. For an extra $4 , they will give you a little less than a cup of rice, shaped in a fancy pyramid. The mole was decent but I kept wanting something else, like a little bit of corn to compliment the saltiness of the cheese. I'd order it again if it wasn't so expensive. My boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas. Now we came with a big group and I understand that not all food ordered could be brought out at the same time, but all the plates of fajitas ordered, came to the table sizzling, like you could hear them pop and crackle, not his. It was steaming, but that's about it. Also, there wasn't much steak to be had, it was more like a few pieces of ground beef in a sea of peppers. It was a regular entree, which included rice, tortillas of course, guacamole, beans and sour cream. Unfortunately, there were only 4 corn tortillas, a tablespoon of guacamole that was hidden on a leaf of lettuce, below it was the beans and a tiny bit of sour cream. Needless to say, he was not thrilled and kind of over the meal when it got to the table. We tried to inform the waiter about all our issues with his meal, but he was no where to be seen until it was time to clean the plates off the table. Of course he ate, but by the end of the meal you wouldn't know with all those peppers.  Now I know some other reviews said it gets pretty busy after 9pm, but it wasnt busy. We were there around 9pm on a Saturday night , there were probably 4 small parties there and one other large party in the upper room. So where was our, or any, waiter.  So yeah, the experience was meh, yeah I said it. I didn't mind titties up in my face (on paintings) while eating my meat, but if you would, this isn't a place to welcome your family to celebrate a christening or 1st birthday party. Their margaritas were decent, service was hardly there, but they were definitely accommodating to our ever growing party.

Our friends and family said it was definitely the best wedding they had ever attended. I truly can't speak highly enough of this place. We just went back tonight for the first time since our wedding for a little wedding day deja vu and it was great- we were once again just blown away with flavor- we started with a pitcher of sangria (my personal fave) and the shrimp cocktail appetizer, which is one of the best I've had- the perfect amount of spice, fresh and delicious. As for entrees, my husband got the mixed seafood paella dish which was very tasty and I got the duck breast with a chile-peanut mole sauce, yukon potatoes and frizzled beets on top- it was really amazing, and came with the the most delightful corn tortillas I've ever had.

Quite terrible and flavorless. We were robbed.  On top of this, the service was extremely awkward. For example, while we were finishing the last bit of guacamole (I'm talking midbite, people), the server (eyeing us the whole time) came over and confiscated our plates from us. There was still chips and salsa on the table. We were like, ""WTF?!?! Are we in a Seinfeld episode?!"" Not cool.

The margaritas were a bit too sweet and the small amount of tequila I did taste wasn't very high quality. Or maybe I'm just used to Patron... Their food is their saving grace. The portions are quite small but pretty tasty. The tamale appetizer was very good, but I wanted more than they gave us! I had the steak fajitas and my boyfriend had the shrimp fajitas.

I suppose not checking on the prices before I went is my own fault, but the fact is that this place wasn't any better than the multiple other Mexican places I passed on Milwaukee on the way there, and it was more expensive.  The oddly painted walls, replete with naked women and some other strange scenes, was just a weird addition to the disappointment.

Okay, I said, let's give it a try. It's a place that aspires to be on the high end of the Mexican restaurant list but just doesn't make it. The decor is pretty interesting - starting with the painting of a Latin mermaid, and her voluptuousness in full display, and the Mayan warrior woman with only half her nipples exposed. It's art. I get it. But it just seemed a bit shlocky. We ordered the guacamole starter which was fine, but nothing special. My wife ordered the pumpkin soup, which was very good - sweet, but also had zucchini and carrots in there to offset the pumpkin. I had their version of the shrimp cocktail and it was a disaster. Sounded good on the menu but it was basically a cup of their homemade cocktail sauce and small shrimp and avocado swimming in it. It came with two spoons so I take it you're supposed to eat it like a soup. It just didn't work and it smelled a bit too ""sea-foodie"", not spoiled, but just had that distinct scent to it.   For the entrees, I had the chicken with the Rojo Coloraditos mole, on the server's recommendation. The mole was okay, but just not spectacular. It came with a pyramid of rice that was not fully cooked, so I crunched my way through it, rather than send it back. I just wanted to get finished.  My wife enjoyed the Sopes Surditos as her entree, but its really an appetizer. It was a nice mix of flavors and meats in small corn cups, with nice presentation. We skipped desert and the bill came in at $60.  Not outrageous prices, but the food just wasn't quite there. The attention to detail is a bit lacking and some of the plates failed.

We tried two appetizers to share: the Camarones al Ajillo and Sopes Surtidos.  The camarones were OK - I wasn't impressed with the freshness of the shrimp and that made the appetizer disappointing.  However, the Sopes were delicious.  The flavors complimented each other well and there was a nice variety of sopes for all tastes.   We split the Friday mole special, Chichilo, for our entree.  I thought the flavors were good but, for such a high price, the portion was pretty small.  All of the entrees are about $20 but they don't really feed one person well.  If you didn't get an appetizer or don't fill up on the side of rice, the entree itself isn't very large or satisfying.  I enjoyed the mole and I'd like to try some of the other flavors, but the flavor and combination of ingredients wasn't overwhelmingly satisfying or anything.  It was really just good and that's about it. With drinks, we paid quite a lot for a night out for two - almost $65.  That's a bit much for two people to go out for dinner, especially if you wanted to come here often.  If we come back, I'd definitely like to try the guacamole that they prepare right at your table.  It seems like a cool idea and other reviewers seem to enjoy it.  The margaritas are pretty good and there's other food I'd like to try.  I haven't written you off entirely, Real Tenochtitlan.",0.9983,0.721,0.256,0.023,0.551391223155929

2010-01-20,5.0,"MAGNIFICENT MOLES + VOLUPTUOUS MERMAIDS + PYROTECHNICS = ???  An incredible night at Real Tenochtitlan.  I have to admit I'm a bit of a mole snob. I usually don't order mole at most Mexican restaurants because I love it too much to assault my senses with cheap impostors. I had yet to find my go-to place for mole in Chicago until I found Real Tenochtitlan, for whom mole is their raison d'être.  FOOD:  We started out with the guacamole which was prepared table side. It was fantastic; creamy avocados, a surprising yet perfect amount of heat...it didn't last 5 minutes. It was the perfect compliment to their excellent margaritas (that's right, they're no longer BYOB...boo!).  On to the main event, the mole. The front of the menu where they list the moles is a bit confusing. They list a mole of the day, but due to popular demand you can actually get any of them every day to pair with the protein of your choice. We had a lot of questions about all the moles so they graciously brought us a mole flight to sample! Here are my tasting notes:  -Mole Blanco: Sweet and nutty, strong almond notes, perfect with fish.  -Mole Chichilo: Great chili flavor, but not spicy, great with pork of chicken  -Mole Rojo Coloradito: (my choice) Complex, sweet, savory, and just plain delicious, complex chocolate, peanut, chili, and sesame notes, perfect with chicken or pork, although hell...I'd put it on ice cream.  -Mole Negro: The most ubiquitous mole, sweet, rich, very strong sesame notes, almost an Asian quality to it, also great with chicken, duck, etc.  DECOR, AMBIANCE, & SERVICE: On top of the great food, I loved the decor and the ambiance. Think high ceilings, vibrant Mexican-inspired art, (check out the mermaid...hubba hubba), and a lively atmosphere. It's the kind of place where you just want to linger.  Finally, the service was fantastic. Despite a huge party going on and sparklers on their desserts that set off their smoke detectors, the staff was attentive, helpful, and never made you feel rushed. They really take pride in their food and the time they spent with us setting up the mole flight and explaining all the ingredients was really above and beyond.  Me gusta! Me gusta!

The sauce was perfectly spicy and there was enough spilling over to sop up with some of their homemade corn tortillas. yum. The rice was just OK, not really what I am used to, but it tasted good.  I also had a few margaritas, which were tasty, but not very strong at all.

2009-12-07,3.0,"First of all, everyone please be aware - Real Tenochtitlan is no longer BYOB!! They have a full bar now, which has decent enough prices on a wide selection of drinks. I wouldn't say that there are any deals to write home about, but there is booze to be had at a medium-high price.  I should have checked their website to confirm prior to inviting friends there for a birthday party, but I saw the BYOB reviews on Yelp and went with that in my excitement. We showed up as a party of 10, bearing a healthy collection of bottles of wine - all of which we set on the table. And then the waiter awkwardly handed us the wine list. He later allowed us to open the wine we had brought, at a $5 corkage fee per bottle. One person had a six-pack of beer as well, and he was charged $5 per bottle of beer (shouldn't it have been $5 for the six-pack?)... I had mixed feelings about the whole thing, especially since we weren't the only party in the (nearly empty) restaurant to have made this mistake - another large party across the dining room had rolled in with several cases of bud light. They must have been looking at a hefty bill by the end of the night...  Anyway, moving on to the actual food. Mostly in the 3 to 4 stars range - I think everyone really did enjoy their dishes. As other reviewers have said, the moles and other sauces are really the things to try here. We had the ceviche and the sopes plate appetizer, both of which were quite good - though definitely on the skimpy side for the relative prices. Lovely presentation though. Chicken breast wasn't anything special, a little dry actually. I had a duck breast that was quite good. Relatively boring rice, steamed vegetables, ok tortillas - all made better by being dunked in mole, of course. A friend had the Pato Encacahuatado, which was duck breast in spicy peanut sauce with mashed potatoes and crispy fried beet chips. She seemed to be in love with it.  In the end, the weirdness over the BYOB situation made it hard to enjoy the experience. It had a ""second-class-diner"" vibe to it. Our server, Jorge, was attentive enough, but in sort of a weird, overly-aloof way. The whole place sort of just felt like it thought it was much fancier than it actually is. I know, I'm probably starting to get spoiled by the Paul Kahans and Rick Baylesses of the world - presenting incredible food in a non-pretentious, relatively inexpensive sort of way. Real Tenochtitlan ended up feeling like the opposite - decent food, with some standout elements (moles, sauces, presentation), but overpriced and in a pretentious environment.",0.9969,0.787,0.168,0.045,0.4662202380952381
2009-12-06,2.0,"Great food, lazy service. I went here with a group for a friends birthday.  We went thinking it was BYOB (it was listed on metromix as byob) and brought a couple bottles of wine.  First they informed us that they'd just gotten their liqour license, so we couldn't drink what we brought.  We were bummed, but we understood and didn't complain.  After a couple of minutes they said we could drink what we brought, and we though 'these guys are great, that's so nice.' From there on the service went downhill.  Our server was curt and apparently preoccupied, even though the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night.  When the food got to us, there was a small mix up with who had what, and instead of changing the plates our server said ""could you just switch your plates, because..."" and then walked away.  Ok, maybe he's having an off night. The food was incredible, no complaints.  The steak tacos were to die for and the mole dishes were uniformly great.  But when we got our bill, not only was there the %20 gratuity (standard for large groups, but after the service we had...) but also a $40 corkage fee.  They charged us for each bottle of wine and each bottle of beer we opened.  I understand this may be common, but no one told us upfront.  Also, $5 for a bottle of wine is reasonable, but $5 for individual beers is absurd.  Not wanting to make a fuss during our friends birthday, we paid up.    I think that's pretty shoddy to tack on $40 without warning, especially when we brought a group of people to an otherwise pretty empty place, and we were fine to just order from the bar. Not coming here again with that kind of service.  Which is a shame because the food is pretty stellar.",0.9734,0.787,0.136,0.077,0.6718537414965987

The first time I came was recently after it had opened last year and the food was delicious and our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Well, the story has changed... My boyfriend and I made a reservation for Friday night at 7:30 thinking that the place was going to be busy. We get there and there's only one other full table. The whole night the place was like a ghost town. That includes the servers too. At one point we asked for a little time to decide on our entrees and didn't see a server again for about 40 minutes! The descriptions of the different moles from the server were vague at best.  Now about the food. We ordered the sopes as an appetizer. They were pretty tasty, especially the black bean and chorizo and the plantain and cheese ones. For entrees we ordered two different types of mole with duck as the protein on both. When the plates arrived the duck was a little ""off"" looking. It also tasted weird. I have eaten my share of delicious duck too. I make it several times a year and order it every time I see it on a menu. So, we both sent our duck back and it was replaced by some equally as mediocre chicken. I will say that the mole was pretty damn good, but the proteins were just not there.

First of all, the place looks really good! If Carnivale had a mini-me equivalent, this would be it. The best part were the massive paintings with Mayan motifs - really I just liked the King Kong sized boobies staring me in my face...who doesn't?  Second surprise, the buffet was $15. I might be a little backwards snobby - but this is Logan Square, not Lincoln Park. Thirdly, the ""buffet"" was like a quasi-, semi-, or from some of the reviews on here, a fusion buffet. Anyway, you want to call it, you couldn't just go up and gorge yourself. The first part of the buffet (and really only part) was a buffet of appetizers, fresh fruit, pico de gallo and chips. The second part was a choice of ONE entree from a menu, in which you have to order from your waiter. Everything looked good on the menu, why not serve them all? Then it'd be worth the $15! So with my luck, I probably picked the only entree that I didn't really like. Overall, food was pretty decent, except for my entree, Chilaquiles. I've had it before but this time it was in some type of sauce. I assumed it was mole and am not knocking this review down since I'm not a big fan to begin with. Appetizers consisted of chicken tamales, chicken taquitos, black bean and chorizo tart, cheese empenadas, pico de gallo, black beans, rice, etc. I must throw in here that the Horchata was exceptional.

The food was lackluster - perhaps it was just this buffet?  The other reviewers here seem to love it, but I was left with an unsatisfied, yet full tummy.  The service - when we got it - was friendly, but yes, sparse.

We picked this place based on a recommendation and I'm so glad we went.  On the outside it doesn't look like much and you really don't know what to expect until you walk in. The dining room was very inviting and warm with lots of tables and tall chairs. Since this was a BYOB, we brought plenty to drink - margarita pitcher, many, many bottles of wine, and beer. With the margarita, the wait staff brought over glasses already made up with salt on the rim and lime (if that's the way you prefer to drink it).  We got a couple of appetizer sample platters that came with a little of everything and it was all very delicious and generous with the portions. Of course at any Mexican restaurant, one should always order their guacamole and Real Tenochtitlan was very tasty and didn't disappoint.  They specialize in different mole sauces, so each day has a different specialty as well as some staple mole sauces they create on a daily basis. With each of the mole sauces, there are several choices of meats you can get with it such as lamb, beef, pork, chicken, and duck - just to name a few. The big hit with the group that night was the scallop dish as 1/3 of our table ordered it. I'm a big fan of duck, so when I see it on a menu, I always gravitate towards it. The duck and the scallop dish were both spectacular and perfectly cooked. The duck was moist and cooked medium/medium rare - just divine. I can't comment on their desert as we brought our own cake. They were more than happy to store the cake we brought and served it to us when requested - very accommodating. :) The only thing I'm sorry about is that I haven't made another trip out there.

The interior is pleasantly surprising, with plenty of room, white table cloths, soaring ceilings and bright, lively yet sophisticated colors. (My 2 cents: turn the lights down a bit more at dinner, and dress the store front windows with some sheers: the view of the car wash leaves much to be desired). BYOB service was prompt, no waiting for wine glasses. I think it was the chef who started to wait on us, which made it feel like a special evening. He was very informative, yet down to earth. He seemed appreciative that we deferred to him to help us make selections - and we were very glad we did. Started with the ceviche; fresh and delicious.The tableside-made guacamole was fresh enough to nearly warrant the $9 price - and served with fresh-fried chips.  Hearing the chef is a mole master, that's what we ordered. The waiter who replaced the chef at this point lost major points for abandoning us after serving our dinner, but the food was so good our experience was not dampened. I had the Saturday special red mole, with sliced duck breast (not somehting I usually order), and my date had the trio of mole: green with shrimp, white with quail, black with beef. The food was so good, we could not talk after we tried it - just looked at eachother thinking HOLY !@#$ THIS IS GOOD. Everything on each plate was both of top quality and cooked perfectly: protein, starch, vegetable: but it was the mole that was the star. I wanted to take it home, fill up the bathtub and roll around in it. THAT'S how good it was. I had to yell at my date after he picked up a bone with the intention of gnawing on it.   And OMG the tortillas! If you've never had fresh-made tortillas, they warrant the trip on their own. We each had desert - pineapple upside down cake and chocolate pecan pie, both delectable.  It was a little pricey, but BYOB certainly took the edge off and it was so good, I'd pay practically anything for food of that caliber again. If you want a huge plate piled high with tacos, rice and beans, go elsewhere.

2009-02-25,5.0,"I'll admit it, until a few years ago, I hated moles.  Keep in mind that the only moles I'd had were of the corner taqueria variety, but I generally shied away from them, finding them cloying, heavy and generally unpleasant. Geno Bahena changed all that by opening a fine dining Mexican restaurant on a desolate stretch of Milwaukee, a restaurant that was of the same caliber as Frontera, yet half the price.  It soon became a family favorite and a regular dining destination due largely to Bahena's mastery of sauces, in particular, the formerly dreaded mole.   I was heartbroken when the original Ixcapuzalco closed, so when word of Real Tenochtitlan's opening came around, I couldn't wait to try it. The wait, I'm happy to say, was completely worth it.  Geno is on his A game again with the Real Tenochtitlan. The space itself is very pleasant, elegant and understated at the same time.  It's the kind of restaurant that you could wear jeans or a dress to and be at ease either way. It's physically comfortable with plenty of room between the tables and soft music in the background that still allows for easy conversation.  I noticed a 2nd floor dining area that all of us agreed would be perfect for parties or other events, and a lovely bar that should do a brisk business once they get their liquor license.   The service was fantastic - we came in with some beer(still BYOB), and our waitress immediately put it on ice and brought us glasses.  All empties were whisked away promptly, and when we had a couple left over at the end of the evening, a bag was brought out for us to carry them home.  Service was attentive without being overwhelming, and I was pleased that they remembered to bring out fresh silverware after each course.  Our very friendly and professional waitress was happy to make recommendations and had expert knowledge of the menu, and the busboys were warm yet unobtrusive. All of us were sorely tempted by the very reasonable tasting menu of five courses for $45 but, in the end, we couldn't resist going with some old favorites.  Many of the ""greatest hits"" from Ixcapulzaco were present on the menu, including quail, baby rack of lamb, and the sopes, along with some tempting new options.  My father had duck breast in the daily mole, a Rojo Coloradito, my husband, Mr. Unadventurous Eater, had the steak in a tomamole suace, and I had the scallops in a creamy pumpkinseed sauce.  The table shared an order of the sopes and a sopa Azteca and fresh corn tortillas. I come from a very chatty family, so the quality of a meal to me is measured by the amount of chatter at the table once the food has arrived.  Absolute dead silence descended upon us, broken only by intermittent sighs of satisfaction or offers to share.  The delicious house made corn tortillas were utilized to sop up every last bit of sauce on each plate - I would hardly have believed it could be possible, but Bahena's sauces are even better than I remembered them to be.  The actual proteins were of the highest quality and expertly prepared, with my father's duck breast at a perfect medium, the steak at a gorgeous medium rare, and my scallops cooked through *just* enough.  Everything was wonderful, but I was particularly struck by the quality of the steak - probably the best $18 steak I've ever had the pleasure to try. All of us agreed that it was just enough food to satisfy you but without making you feel overfull, something I very much appreciate in this era of obesity inducing servings. Although I'm not a dessert eater, our meal had been so successful that we chose to gamble and sample one of the desserts as well.  I'm very glad we did as the key lime pie we had was probably the best I'd ever had, although my father ""only"" placed it in his top 3, ha ha.  The espresso I ordered was wonderful as well and was clearly not treated as an afterthought as I often find these days.  It was a genuine treat. Service, perfect. Food, sublime. Price, utterly reasonable.  Dining room, beautiful yet comfortable.  As a bonus, they brought us a coupon for 10% off on our next meal, something I'm planning on using on brunch some weekend.  Geno Bahena has another home run in Real Tenochtitlan - this is going into my regular rotation and I'm looking forward to trying each and every item on the menu over and over again.",0.9996,0.729,0.235,0.036,0.5532055771943412

While admittedly intoxicated, seems like everyone enjoyed their food.  Couple of us had spent time in Mexico the past year and everyone liked  the food.  There were 2 versions of guacamole - I think the standalone guac for the chips was not as good as the appetizer dish that came with guac.  My pork chop dish was delicious and my friends enjoyed the carne asada, rabbit and the 3 mole dish of the night.  The entrees were tasty and appropriately portioned.   RT is a little out of the way, but it's worth the trek for decent Mexican cuisine at a reasonable price.",0.952,0.85,0.126,0.024,0.5303333333333332

But I am pleased to report that I can get food of similar taste and quality mere minutes from my own home. And for one for whom laziness is next to Godliness, that is a very, very good thing. Moles rule the day here, but other fine dishes can be had. The pumpkin soup is unbelievably rich, velvety and filling and, my favorite, the sopes surtidos appetizer is great as a starter or as a  meal (especially in conjunction with the soup). The official word is that the sopes surtidos are masa boats filled with various items, including guacamole, chicken mole, black beans with chorizo and plantain with queso fresco. However, I suspect that they are actually filled with some highly addictive and moderately spicy street drug created as a mind control device by some Oaxacan cartel. If I ever leave anything on my plate, I am so sending it to a laboratory. It's currently BYOB so bring your wine, beer and/or tequila (they make their own margarita mix that is fresh and not super acidic). There is a funny liquor store across the street (as part of a car wash, oddly enough). There's no wine there, so be forewarned. My one complaint is that the support staff didn't speak a lick of English, which made for some problems when there were issues with the dishes they were bringing out. The problem took 5 minutes to resolve as we had to wait for a waiter to come over who could understand the request. Geno Bahena is a great chef but stumbles a bit as a restauranteur.

When we asked for additional chips, we found out later that we were charged an extra $3.50 on our bill. The single poblano pepper was $7 or $8 and stuffed with cream cheese. It was good, but I could have made the exact same thing at home for less than a $1.  I had the lamb chops which were fairly priced at $21 for four chops, plus mashed potatoes. My friend had the venison, which he devoured. Our hunger drove us to tolerate our food, but nobody was slightly impressed by dinner.  They are BYOB for now, but once they get their liquor license, it will tough to walk out of this place for less than $40/person, which is just way too expensive for a sub-par experience.",0.8924,0.861,0.095,0.044,0.4312324929971989
2008-08-03,2.0,"What a disappointment. I was very surprised at the whole experience. To being, our waiter had really no idea about the menu. When I asked him if a dish was good, he replied with such little enthusiasm (besides saying the venision was gamey and tough but that it was a good choice!) that I felt like not ordering anything and leaving. The freshly made salsas were excellent and we at those and the chips (which tasted store bought, not homemade) with pleasure. The rest of the appetizers took forever to appear, because the waiter had forgotten to put them in.  The main courses were so so. Even their mole, which is supposed to be the specialty (and it wasnt even listed on the menu or described to me-I had to ask) was nothing special.  Bottom line-food is average, service is awful-I wouldnt go back.",0.661,0.797,0.112,0.091,0.5225396825396825
