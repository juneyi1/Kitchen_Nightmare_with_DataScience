2009-06-03,2.0,"I've been to La Donna before and thought it was good.  So when my friends were coming to dinner in my neck of the woods and wanted Italian, I took them here.  Sadly, I wasn't as impressed as my last visit.  There was a gross brown stain on the table cloth right were I was sitting.  The paper menu was dirty.  The bread was terribly stale.  I had the seafood risotto while my friends had linguine with seafood and we all agreed the mussels were terrible- chewy and fishy.  There was hardly any other seafood in our meals. I think my dish had a half of a tiny bay scallop, and the shrimp were tough.  Also, my dish was so bland I had to had a fair amount of salt, pepper and cheese. Our server was good, by sadly, I feel this place either went down in quality, or I just happen to get lucky last time I was there.  OH- and BTW- as of June 1st it is now BYOB.  Which I did not know beforehand.  Fortunately there is a liquor store across the street.  Also, there was no mention of the prix fixe that other Yelpers have mentioned, so it's either not available anymore or we were not told about it.  My lousy entree was $19 and came with nothing but stale bread.",-0.5666,0.856,0.059,0.084,0.5524544385655498
2009-04-26,2.0,"Oh man, how I wanted to enjoy this restaurant experience. I have to say that most of the time yelp does not steer me wrong, but this time it did. We were looking for a romantic dinner and some of the yelpers had very positive things to say about this place, but I just didn't see it.  My partner and I came in on an early Saturday evening. There was plenty of seating available on the first floor, near the street-side windows, yet for some reason we were seated on the second floor, side nook area. Now, this would be a romantic dream come true had there not been two other couples seated within this tiny space. I mean, with the lack of any ambient music, we heard every single detail of their conversations without even wanting to.  I think it was nearly 20 minutes before our server finally realized he had a table in this tiny, off room. The server was friendly when we saw him, but service was sporadic at best for the rest of the evening.  The food was somewhat blah to me. We tried the prosciutto and mozzarella stuffed in radicchio leaves - PASS! I had the pear salad with a honey vinagrette and that was my favorite part of the meal. I ordered the curry chicken pasta dish that several others recommended and it was just ok to me. My partner had the gnocchi. Both of us decided the flavors were just not there.  Due to these issues and the somewhat **substantial bill that accompanied the mediocre experience, I don't think we'll return. **Note: We were informed that bills are half off during weeknights and there is also a prix fixe special so that's probably going to be your best bet with this place.",0.994,0.829,0.159,0.013,0.5010768398268398
2009-04-23,4.0,"Listen up, I've found one of my favorite date spots and, lucky for me, it's right in my own neighborhood. First and foremost, the weeknight prix fixe is a deal!  For $22, you get three courses: an appetizer or salad: any entrée; and dessert.  Some of the entrées range on the higher side, so you could easily spend more than that on one course, especially paired with a glass or two of wine. The service reminds me of going to someone's home.  It's really friendly, just attentive enough, yet not 5 stars.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't feel neglected one bit.  ""Comfortable"" comes to mind.  What could be better than being asked if I'd like the lights dimmed down a bit in my cozy little corner?  Oh yes, honey, do slide a little bit closer, will you? My dining companion and I arranged our prix fixe meals so that we could share dishes.  For the first course it was the Calamari alla Griglia for me and the Insalata di Pere for her.  The calamari was cooked almost perfectly, served up with a very mildly spicy olive oil, and presented with some sautéed spinach.  Easily a dish that could lead to overindulging!  The salad was your average version of a standard pear salad.  The pears and honey balsamic dressing added just the right amount of sweet.  For the second course, I chose the Fussili con Pollo e Curry.  Chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and a curry brandy sauce make an addictive combination.  Yes, that's right, I said curry and brandy.  Chef, I love you.   My super dining companion had the Ravioli di Zucca with Grassa sauce, a creamy balsamic sauce.  The combination is recommended right on the menu, with good reason! The wine list is fairly short and not many bottles fall below the $30 mark.  That's not shocking, just be prepared if you're looking to indulge.  The wine glasses are a bit small if you're like me and want to get a good swirl on.   You'll certainly see me back at La Donna again.  Look for me in the cozy corner with the dimmed lights and a date",0.9959,0.825,0.175,0.0,0.6043373938722777

I had mozzarella with prosciutto as a starter and neither the mozzarella nor the prosciutto were of very good quality. I had better from Trader Joes in fact. The bread that was served with it was stale. The main dish was somewhat better. I had the saltimbocca in a sage sauce. It wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either. I would say that they used a bit too much sage though. I have been to Italy quite a few times and this wasn't anywhere near the quality of food I was served in Italy.  Maybe I should have had one of the pasta dishes instead. On top of that the service wasn't that great. We definitely weren't ignored.

To start with, the space is wonderful -- warm, cozy and inviting.  They skillfully manage to optimize the seating area without making their guests feel crowded. I have never had a disappointing meal there.  On my most recent visit, I had the Carpaccio and the Zuppa di Mare -- two dishes which I LOVE.  La Donna handles them both extremely well.  The carpaccio is fresh and succulent with the perfect amount of capers and fresh parmesan.  The Zuppa is a tresure trove of fresh seafood (they do not skimp) in a satisfying broth with the perfect amount of spice. Brunch at La Donna is also a good choice.  It's very relaxed, well-portioned and reasonably priced. The wine list is extensive and the servers are very experienced in wine pairings.  You can be assured of and exquisite variety to accompany your meal. Speaking of service, I have always found it to be perfect.  The servers are knowledgeable and seem to really take pride in the restaurant.  The services is always friendly, efficient and never in your face.

You walk into La Donna expecting it to be fancy, expensive, almost snobbish, but you get the complete opposite. Very warm, friendly, great prices, ok... still a little fancy but nothing is wrong with that. Everything in plain sight is very simple, light wall hangings and the rest of the room is filled with very rich dark colors. We chose a table in front by the window during a chilly night but had no problems with a draft. The service was excellent, fun, kept our drinks full, and even got excited when we ordered one of her favorites. The food was nothing short of perfection, light, flavorful, and huge portions (hence sharing). We started with the grilled portabella mushroom stuffed with spinach and gorgonzola cheese, then a special house salad, and finally an entre that you wouldn't normally expect....Fusilli con Pollo e Curry.

However, I'll give the lone server that was working at the time I ate here credit for at least being on top of remembering to give us bread and water refills(and a la my experience of observing a lone waiter at work at Tre Kronor).

My boyfriend ordered the Uova e Spinaci al Forno, which was awfully soupy for a baked egg dish.  He didn't really care for it.  My Uova del Bosco was good, but instead of the advertised shoestring potatoes (exciting!), I received some lackluster rosemary potato wedges, with no mention of the substitution.  Had this been mentioned to me when I was ordering, I would have selected something else because I really dislike rosemary and was SO looking forward to hash browns/shoestring-style potatoes.

2007-09-20,4.0,"Proving yet again that Yelp is a precious resource, a few of us ordered take-out from La Donna last night.  Having neglected to read what the Yelpers actually had to say, we were fully unaware of the prix fixe menu options!   I don't know if it's fair to suggest that our order taker could have mentioned it, but regardless, we ordered the following:  Insalata Mista ($5.95) - hand picked greens with salad vegetables served with a citrus mustard dressing.   Petto di Pollo Ripieno ($15.95) - baked chicken breasts roulade stuffed with ricotta cheese, spinach & mushrooms in a white wine sauce served with green beans, sauteed with cherry tomatoes.  Lasagne alla Bolognese ($14.95) - pasta with meat & bechamel sauce topped with mozzarella in a creamy tomato sauce.  Gnocchi di Regolari with the Sofia sauce ($15.95) - regular Italian dumplings in a sauce comprised of gorgonzola, walnuts & cream. It's a pretty safe guess that their take-out crowd isn't terribly abundant.  The dining room is intimate, small and perfectly desirable for small groups of friends or comfortable dates.  However, after placing our order, we were told to show up in just fifteen minutes, which I did.  I spent perhaps another five minutes waiting.  Everything was fully packaged and ready to go soon after.   With tax, the total came to $57.95...certainly pricey for a weeknight take-out, but considering the amount of food, still reasonable.   Thirty minutes later, three very content & stuffed people sat around the table.   The starter salad was insignificant but could certainly classify as 'nice'.  The greens were fresh and colorful, and the accompanying dressing was flavorful.   The chicken was unanimously the least favorite of our three entrees, though none of us would say it was a bad dish, by any means.  It was a lighter foil to the heavier, more robust flavors we enjoyed.  The interest factor was low, but again, we were not disappointed with it.  Anyone wanting to avoid the red-sauced, pasta-based dishes will appreciate it's appearance and texture. The lasagna was a definite hit.  For being so simplistic, bechamel sauce made a huge difference in this dish.  It was already blended with the marinara, so the presentation was that of a tomato cream sauce.  The noodles were not overcooked, and the cheese was perfectly browned.  It's hard for lasagna to stand out unless the fillings are unusual, but this certainly held its own. Nous avons adore' le gnocchi.  What a knockout dish.  The gnocchi had a perfect, al dente consistency, but that sauce...pure bliss.  Not being a fan of the stinky cheeses myself, I usually stray away from gorgonzola in general.  I'm really glad I felt daring and wound up loving that dish. Will we be back for more?  You bet...and next time we're craving La Donna on a Wednesday, we now know to ask for the prix fixe menu.",0.9984,0.747,0.206,0.047,0.5545329670329671
2007-09-07,3.0,"Most of reviewers here have raved about the prix fixe menu and I have to say that it would make for a very satisfying and incredibly thrifty meal. Going in for dinner at regular menu prices, while not a complete waste of time, leads one to wonder what one is missing out on elsewhere. The polenta crostini with braised leeks and gorgonzola is wonderful. They are generous with the leeks, wise with the gorgonzola, and add a little drizzle of balsamic. Entrees are very good, but we all found ours to be lacking a little something. My risotto (chicken, apples, onion) could have used more onion and maybe some rosemary. My companions' tilapia and salmon were also very nice but a bit lackluster. Everything needed a little more salt. Desserts are my line of work and my passion, so I always have to at least look at the dessert menu. It's very, very heavy on chocolate. Not a balanced sort of menu at all, but who am I to complain about too much chocolate? I was interested in gelato or sorbet, which are made locally, but instead opted for the tiramisu because different restaurants' interpretations of this classic dessert can be interesting if not necessarily edible. Always an adventure. There's is a solid effort and definitely some of the better tiramisu in the city. There's a lot to be said for real dairy!! They offer an amazing selection of wines by the glass. Most places just offer a red or two and a white or two, but almost all of La Donna's wines are available by the glass. The service is competent but nothing to write home about, the decor is casual and clean. They keep it super-dark, though. Makes you wonder what they're hiding.

But the service left something to be desired.  We had a party of five, and three had gotten there a little earlier and were served their wine.  When my friend and I got there, we waited for a good ten minutes before the server came back to take our drink order.  We asked for a wine list, which she provided, and then disappeared for another ten minutes.  She finally returned, we ordered (wine and food) and then she disappeared.  We waited...and then notice that our server is up at the bar folding napkins, and hey, she's pouring that woman at the bar another glass of wine...um, did she forget about us?  Well, she did!  We finally get our wine and then begin to enjoy our dinner. I loved the food, I probably will return for this special, it really is a great deal!  However, the service was just really sub-par.  She wasn't rude, just completely disinterested.  There were two occasions where we'd ordered something, she didn't write it down, and it was wrong or forgotten.  That just shouldn't happen.

2007-04-19,4.0,"I held off reviewing La Donna until I could revisit it -- this time in the company of a half dozen or so other Yelpers. We went for the prix fixe dinner, which is basically any appetizer, entree, and dessert for 20 bucks. Sweet! La Donna is pretty casual, but the room is nice enough that you'd feel comfortable going there for a special occasion. The main dining room is long and spare -- basically a long banquette with tables on one wall, a few fee standing tables, and tall French doors which are open during warmer weather. When the place is busy, you may feel like you're dining with the people at the next table, but get over it. We ate upstairs, which is a little more relaxed and very cute. Since it was a Weds night and the place wasn't that busy (though downstairs was pretty full), we had the upstairs to ourselves. The upstairs is bright and cheery, with a more vibrant color scheme, and windows that overlook Clark Street. There's even a curtained-off private dining room, for smallish parties. Very nice. The food was terrific. La Donna's offerings are basic, rustic Italian home cooking. It's nicer than a standard Italian-American joint, but nothing trendy. They have some nice seafood selections, and a few risotto and gnocchi choices, along with the usual pasta and meat. They've started serving a ""mix and match"" pasta menu, which offers your choice of pasta and sauce -- probably because people were doing this on their own, anyway. (""Can I get the linguine, but with the red sauce instead?"") I'm not crazy about this concept. If you serve pumpkin ravioli, I trust that you know which sauce complements it best. The good thing is that the menu indicates La Donna's choice (""recommended with the Grassa sauce'), so you don't have to trust your own judgment.  Service can be a bit of a crap shoot, as other reviews have mentioned. Generally, I've found the staff pretty knowledgeable and accommodating (and the bus staff is always terrific), but I've had some clunkers here. I think we're seeing some family members working here, and some can't be bothered. Drinks are pricey -- $10 martini (granted, top shelf) -- but I guess they help pay for the prix fixe.

2005-10-04,4.0,"The italian food here isn't the most spectacular I've ever had, but some of their dishes are very good. I've found the veal dishes to be just so-so, but they do some tasty and innovative variations on raviolis.  They seem to have a following, the couple of times I've been there the dining room has been busy (but not packed, I've always been able to get in without reservations). Watch for their coupons, they have an 2-for-1 entree deal that you can print from the Chicago Reader restaurant website.  I also picked up a $5-off coupon on my way out from my last visit.",0.8458,0.924,0.076,0.0,0.4746296296296296
2005-08-24,5.0,La Donna is a lovely restaurant in Andersonville.  The doors open to let fresh air in during the summer.  The decor is upscale.  The food is to die for!  Italian food that is rich and creamy and yummy.  Just like it should be.  Expensive but worth it.  Pumpkin ravioli with a maple syrup based sauce!  Brilliant!,0.9357,0.685,0.279,0.036,0.5375000000000001
