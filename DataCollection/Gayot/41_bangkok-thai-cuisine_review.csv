Our server ignored us, we waited at least 20 minutes before our server took our order and that was only after we flagged her down. I ordered pad see ew with beef, my friends ordered 2 soups and chicken wings. After waiting another 30 minutes their soups came out cold but the order of chicken wings and noodles didn't come out at all with no explanation. My friend sent back the cold soup to get warmed and it was never seen again. I assumed my food would be coming out soon and waited again for another 15 minutes. Then I saw the table that came at least 45 minutes after us get 3 appetizers including chicken wings that we never received. At this point, it was clear my food wasn't coming.

2017-05-28,2.0,"Ordered from This place last night. While the food was actually quite tasty, the amount you receive is very lack luster.  Ordered the pepper steak, and just like another reviewer wrote, i was charged an extra dollar for choosing beef. This was not the lunch special btw, this was the full order. When the pepper steak came, there was about 6-7 small bite size pieces of the beef in there for $11.50. i think this was quite unreasonable. Just so you don't think it was just this one dish. My fiance and i also ordered two other dishes, the chicken curry and drunken noodle with chicken. Both once again were very flavorful and tasted wonderful. BUT, both only had about 6-7 pieces of small chicken.  So if you want a small meal that tastes great, then this place is great. If you want anything more than a small meal though, i suggest you go elsewhere.",0.9457,0.854,0.116,0.029,0.5406547619047619

I asked the waitress about the amount of steak, but she simply smiled and said ""I don't know, that's how it comes.""  When the check comes I was charged an additional dollar for a beef add on to the ""Pepper Steak"". I again asked the waitress, and she said it's because I wanted beef. She got the menu and pointed to the part where it said chicken is free with the lunch menu, but beef is $1 more. Still confused I asked why do you call it pepper steak and not pepper chicken?  It really only comes as pepper steak. She must be confusing getting beef with a dish such as pad Thai rather than chicken, right?  Again, she smiled very nicely and said beef is extra. I just have up.  Overall, portions are small and menu confusing.",0.9214,0.815,0.123,0.062,0.5642857142857144

2017-01-09,5.0,"The area has been absent a decent Asian option since Kam Kong Cafe expired over a year ago. It was a local gem which went kaput! Some people might disagree with my estimation since there are a few decent and a couple crappy alternatives. Restaurants like; a newer Vietnamese offering (which I'm not familiar with), as well as the famed Hoanh Long, a decent Filipino restaurant, Panda Express (dare I call it Asian) and the disgusting Chinese buffet around the corner.  In the space that Bangkok resides used to be a ""homestyle"" themed diner that had existed for what seemed to be a short while. It had some popularity but didn't seem to drum up the kind of foot traffic a thriving business needs to continue operating. This area of Lincoln ave gets a ton of traffic. But giving people ample reason to stop is what's key. Many businesses cannot afford putting up a large (street-facing) sign like the Wingstop next door. That detail aside, if people were willing to take a look indoors, they'd find a new gem to fawn over. Inside you'll find a quaint interior. Adequately decorated and shielded from the noisy street outside. Their double door system at the front helps shield the indoors from the cold outside.  Helps to forget where you are and enjoy the surroundings. Find Thai inspired decor pieces on glass shelving and dark mahogany looking tables and chairs. If only the inside temperature were warmer (during the current winter season), I might have opted to dine in. I loathe being cold when eating. Maybe the heat is increased when a diner sits in, but I have yet to figure that out.  I checked them out for the first time about a week ago. Did not realize a new Thai place had opened up on Lincoln. It's a thoroughfare often used to get around this area of the city  quickly. Searching lunch specials in the area (on Yelp), a popup suggested this spot. Reviews, photos and price points met my needs so I decided to give it a go. Got the pepper steak in garlic sauce w/ jasmine rice and it can come with 2 pieces of Crab rangoon or a Thai salad. I opted for the Rangoons. I also ordered a Golden curry puff appetizer. (Based on photos and price, I thought these would be bigger. Not the case.) I requested they make my food moderately spicy and they obliged. The food was fresh, ingredients were tasty and tossed in a garlic sauce that they gave a good kick of spice too. Enough that it left constant indication of sweat beads rolling down my nose. Usually I'd try to save half the portion for a second meal but the food was so good I devoured everything. My only gripe is the amount of rice. A bigger helping would have complimented the meal but like most Thai restaurants, this is typical. In any case, food was superb. The appetizer was minuscule and hardly dented my appetite. My best description of them would be; tiny pockets of curried samosa filling. The filling is slightly sweetened and served with a very light, sweet based dip. Top them in sriracha for a tasty kick. If sharing this appetizer, two would be necessary though hardly cost effective, as there are tastier ways to spend $13 dollars. Some days later.. I was jones'ing for another tasty lunch special. This time I went with the Ginger chicken in ginger sauce with a Thai salad on the side. Requested it light spicy and also got an order of the Bangkok Wings as an appetizer. Looking over their website a photo of the wings was displayed and looking mighty appealing. This instigated an immediate reaction of a purchase.  Thoughts? The wings were merely alright. Fried from frozen and well done. Meat stuck to the bone. Maybe the chicken was a witch and to dispel its evils it had to be burned to death. It was covered in Thai herbs which could be seen on each piece and served with a side dipping sauce. The winner was the ginger chicken special. Same great flavors from before, fresh ingredients and a decent kick to keep me enthusiastic about my meal till the last piece of rice was spooned into my mouth. The Thai salad is a tiny portion of light mixed greens with a sweet sorta vinaigrette. So far, so very good. Looking forward to the next time.",0.9983,0.808,0.151,0.041,0.5082458839687758

The prices were a bit more than other places, but you definitely got less than you would at Pride or other Thai restaurants. The only dish I did like from them was the pineapple fried rice.

2015-12-16,5.0,God I hope this place survives.  Some of the best Thai I've ever had.  The wife and I stopped for lunch here last week and had a fantastic meal.  The green curry and crab rangoon were probably the best I've had.   My wife loved her meal too(can't recall what she had to be honest).  BYOB and some of the friendliest service you will find.  Go here please so they can stay open.,0.9774,0.676,0.302,0.021,0.5083333333333333

2015-11-13,5.0,"If you look at my other reviews, several are for Thai places all over the country.  I stopped in today for lunch.  There wasn't anyone dining yet, but the quaint little place was very well decorated, nice chairs, and had an inviting feel.  A friendly elderly man brought me water and told me lunch specials were on the back.  I got green curry with chicken, which usually is my litmus test for good authentic Thai or an Americanized hack job wannabe.  With it came a crab Rangoon appetizer.  Fully expecting a heat and serve Rangoon that is very standard, I was pleasantly surprised when a very fresh, hand made, with crabmeat Rangoon came out.  And there was two on the plate.  After that, a nice size bowl (lunch serving but was plenty) of green curry and white rice came out.  Everything was wonderful.  The curry was fresh, rich, spicy (I asked for spicy), delicate, and delicious.  The chicken was tender, the veggies still were al dente', and the sauce was velvety.  The best part is when I went to pay the lady was unfortunate to tell me there was a $10 minimum for the charge card.  My meal (w/water) was only $8!  So I got a Thai coffee to go ($3) to get past the minimum.  It, as well, was very good.  I can not believe this place didn't have a line out the door for lunch.  That may be the best under $10 meal in Chicago in my opinion.  Most of the prices on the dinner menu are $10 - $13, and the place is BYOB.  So you could walk in with a bottle of Kim Crawford, have a fabulous meal and get out the door for $35 - $40 (including what you paid for the wine).  That is ridiculous considering the bottle of Crawford would cost you that alone at most places. I initially think this place is the best Thai I have had in Chicago so far.  I will be back to continue to test that theory.  This is a straight up mom and pop, super reasonable, excellent food kind of place.  These are exactly the kinds of places I look for when I travel for work. Other info... They do deliver.  They don't have a parking lot so you may have to pay to park on the street (I parked right in front of the restaurant).  I think it would be a great date spot if she/he likes Thai.",0.9986,0.742,0.227,0.03,0.5719655521783182

2015-11-03,4.0,"I ordered Take Out here for Lunch. The Lunch specials are cheap and numerous! I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken lunch special with an order of the Crispy Tofu and it was ready for pickup within 10-15 minutes. The Sweet Chili Garlic Sauce that came with the Crispy Tofu was AMAZING: sweet, tangy, with just the right amount of heat to linger on the lips. The tofu itself was no longer crispy by the time I got back to the office 5 minutes after pick up because of the build up of steam in the container, however. But the tofu was springy, soft, and delicious. The side salad was small and simple, mostly lettuce and carrots but the dressing was great. The Pad Thai came in a large portion; it was very filling and satisfying. However, it was topped with some crispy chips (they looked like very small and thin Fritos) which I'd have preferred if they kept out. They didn't really add to the taste and it was not a texture I enjoy with Pad Thai and it's not something I've seen served on Pad Thai before. I would have preferred if they topped with more crunchy fresh mung bean sprouts. The dish did have bean sprouts but they were cooked in and therefore soft only. But because these are personal preferences and not a comment on the quality of the food. I'd definitely come here again and most likely try one of their curries.",0.9802,0.855,0.126,0.019,0.5729953917050692

2015-06-18,5.0,"Everyone has their favorite Thai place. This is my new fav and hidden gem on Lincoln next to another secret gem: Hoang Loanh. We ordered all the basics: spring rolls, pad Thai, pad see eww, curry fried rice with pineapple and chicken to compare to my other fav place. Each dish was the same as usual but elevated by the details and presentation. No giant portions here, quality over quantity. Gorgeous and delicious touches included: toasted sesame seeds on the tops of the spring roll bites...who ever made these used to make sushi bc the julienned carrots inside were perfectly arranged in the rice paper which was perfectly prepared ie not the chewy sloppy mess you get at most places...we asked for ""crispy"" on the pad see ewe...perfectly crispy noodles...they put fresh mint leaves on the plate with the sticky rice and mango! Love it! Best Thai food in Chicago with high attention to detail and obviously someone cooking who is a chef, not a cook! Hurry before the crowds come!",0.9938,0.732,0.239,0.029,0.588767217630854
2015-06-14,3.0,"So far, I've been here a couple of times, but I'm not sure if I want to dine here again. The first time we went, I went with a group of 6 friends and had very attentive service. There was 1 other table at the place with us for lunch.  This last time we went, I went with a group of 5 friend and had HORRIBLE SERVICE. There were 2 other tables of 2 people and maybe 1-2 carry orders. There was no excuse really. It took at least 20 minutes for them to fill our water cups and the cups are smaller than most places. The restaurant is pretty open, so it's not like it is so difficult for them to glance at our tables. It then took like 25 minutes for us to get our check after asking for it! What the heck were they doing? I have no idea. I was pretty frustrated by the end of the meal. Don't get me wrong, they were very nice, but we were definitely neglected. Food: I've had the calamari with was very tasty with the spicy fish sauce. It was yummy, but not spectacular. It is fairly small. The chicken satay is pretty tasty. The chicken was juicy and the peanut sauce complimented the chicken very well. The crab fried rice was okay. It was good, but I've had better. There was not a lot of crab in the fried rice itself, but presentation counts. They shaped it like a cone! The pork pad sie ew was very good. Very sweet and savoury. It was a tad on the greasy side, but still good. Pretty standard pad sie ew. Parking is Chicago metered box parking on the street out front.",0.9897,0.689,0.204,0.107,0.6314564564564565

2015-05-06,4.0,Had a nice lunch today.. started with Thai salad with ginger dressing. (part of $7.95 lunch special) followed with Bangkok spring rolls... super fresh and tasty.. had the tom kha soup with chicken.. fairly average could have used a little more heat.. the rest of the lunch special was a red curry with pork.. medium heat was perfect ..not overpowering. Portion was perfect if you had additional dishes. Service was attentive and prompt. Clean and well designed surroundings. Nice Thai iced coffee.

2015-04-19,4.0,"Note: As I'm writing this on 4/19/15, their website is not up yet - but they're working on it! For reference, this restaurant is next to Hoanh Long. It has street parking with meter; I'm not sure about neighborhood parking. This is more of a 3.75 star rating - if only that were possible! The restaurant is brand new and my family orders spicy (and A LOT)! So here goes... -Chicken satay: Cooked very well and at the right consistency -Calamari: Breaded lighter than in American restaurants, delicious! -Mee grob (or mee krob): Sweet and crunchy noodle appetizer that we love. The chef made it super crunchy and used a different sauce (maybe sweet and sour?) than we were used to, but it was an interesting take on the dish -Tom yum goong: We ordered this extra spicy and they seemed to add red peppers to up the spice instead of Thai peppers. The soup could've been made a bit sweeter too. -Som tam: Spicy and good as in other restaurants! -Basil fried rice: Maybe skip it for now, as it tasted like Chinese fried rice... give it a few months and maybe the chef will add more basil taste to it. -Red snapper with spicy basil sauce: Not sweet as we expected, but fish was fried deliciously and sauce was still pretty tasty - if you're the chef, please offer a sweet and spicy sauce too! We would love that! -Pad see eiw: Unfortunately, I only had one bite, but it was pretty good. For dessert, we had the fried ice cream. Not bad, but we probably won't order it again. (Too much batter and the ice cream could've been richer.) Final impressions: PROS: Server was very attentive (albeit a bit nervous from being new), restaurant has simple but elegant decor, fresh and high-quality food, unique spice-takes on dishes, inexpensive lunch deals ($7.99?), welcoming ambience for dates, families, etc., dishes were a decent size, pretty artistic with food design CONS: Spices for some dishes were different from what we were used to, difficult to spot when driving on Lincoln For sure, I'll go back to try the lunch specials and see how they do for dinner in about a month or so! I'm excited to see how this restaurant fares!",0.9978,0.751,0.207,0.041,0.593485393013695
