2009-03-29,4.0,"We were going back and forth on what to order tonight and O'Fame came to mind.  We live close by, but they don't do a good job of advertising (hint, hint owners) - I can't tell you how many times I've driven by and had no idea that there was a pizza place on the corner. Anyway, let's get to the food.  Really really good.  We had a thin crust, sausage (homemade).  Excellent.  The pizza was cooked exactly right.  We usually go to Pete's and this was just as good if not better.  We also had the Antipasto plate - Wow!  Great value, really good stuff. We will definitely be ordering from here again, some of the best thin crust I've had in the city.",0.936,0.695,0.186,0.119,0.5844537815126051

2009-03-12,4.0,"I used to go to their Webster location because my roommate knew someone who worked their. I remember clearly, ordering their pizza and loving it.  Over the years, I'd go with other friends for half price pizza and was excited to find out they were moving up north and would deliver. Their pan pizza has some of the best crust I've ever had. It's thick, doughy and has a buttery flavor. The puffiness goes so well with the light tomato sauce, fresh ingredients and slightly browned cheese. They still do half price on Wednesday nights, which is a great deal. I think pan pizza is sort of a special division that can't be compared to thin or deep dish. And because of this, I believe O'Fame to be some of the best.",0.9849,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.48779761904761904

2009-01-11,5.0,"The man and I just ordered up some pizza to go as we were returning from our errands, as pizza is pretty much our go-to food. O'Fame is close-by (North Center-ish) and he was familiar with the original O'Fame, which opened in Lincoln Park 25 years ago (but closed this past March). Having just tried Apart Pizza and coming away unsatisfied, I really hoped O'Fame would pull through and deliver the goods. Ooooooh, they did. Our all pepperoni/half spinach and onion was deeeelish!  The crust was soooo crispy, the ingredients fresh, just the right amount of cheese, and not smothered with grease. Uhhhmazing. Also, found out that they do deliver to our place in Ravenswood Manor. Sweeeeet. I think we'll have them come to us next time. Not only will I be satisfying my pizza cravings with them, I'd love to try the salads and pasta entrees they have on the menu.  O'Fame is definitely a welcome addition to the area (sorry Lincoln Park!)",0.9688,0.839,0.146,0.015,0.5690476190476191

2008-12-28,4.0,"Excellent homemade soups, fresh salds with quality vegetables, lettuce and cheeses and excellent thin crust pizza.   Everthing was fresh - for a delivery joint, and it is an excellent thin crust pizza.

2008-11-29,3.0,"Not too shabby.  We had the thin crust and I was pleased to find that it wasn't TOO thin... Sometimes, cracker crust is nice and others, thick, fat-ass crust is just what the cardiologist ordered. What seems to be missing from a lot of Chicago pizza menus, however, is a nice hand-tossed pizza... Not too thick, not too thin.  While O' Fame isn't quite hand-tossed, it is of a pleasurable thickness. It showed up piping hot and when they said it would. The mozzarella sticks requested for accompaniment  were decent-- pretty obviously frozen, but chewy and well-seasoned. A weird side-note about the mozzarella sticks: grubhub demanded that you choose a dipping sauce... BBQ, Marinara or Sour Cream. Huh? Really? Not being a retard, I went with the BBQ Sauce.  The chocolate cake-- ordered only for my girlfriend-- was richer than Teddy Roosevelt's banker, I'm told. If that's your bag, stuff yourself into a diabetic coma, I suppose.  Overall, I was pleased. Not surprised-- it was just about what I expected-- but pleased nonetheless. Along with Manzos and Apart, could become a regular part of my pizza rotation.",0.9129,0.819,0.125,0.056,0.6497435897435896
2008-11-13,5.0,"Best Zupa de Pesce ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I crave it. Saucy and spicy red sauce over linguini with tons of fresh seafood piled high. Love the atmosphere, comfortable but classy, cute, but not overly done. I tried the zupa once and never got another thing on their menu. Yup, it's just that good. The only problem is that I no longer live or work anywhere near O'Fame anymore. Boo!!!!!!!",0.9384,0.661,0.263,0.076,0.5950000000000001
2008-11-12,4.0,"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars.  Instead they get 4 stars only because I can't give them 3.5 stars. The 1/2 star would be for loyalty. I've been getting pizza from this place since 2001 and was so excited when they moved north. The old location was great but parking was tough.  The first few times I ordered from their new location, the pizza was great and the service was stellar. not so much since then.  When the new team gets it right they nail it - best thin crust pizza I have had anywhere in the country.  They are only getting it right about half the time.  I've spoken to the owners about this and  can only hope they can find, train, and motivate their staff they way they did at their old location. Even with my concerns, an average pizza from this place is still better than most others.",0.9829,0.816,0.174,0.01,0.5109938672438672
2008-10-21,5.0,"OMG!  My favorite Italian eatery is sooooo close to me now that they have moved up north.  I don't mind them not having a dining room anymore since with the economy and all I've been eating in.  And now I can still order my favorite stuffed artichoke, antipasto salad and steak sandwich on garlic bread....MMMMMM!  Now with this delicious food I'll be watching Dancing with the Stars!!!!  Next week it's that incredible thin crust pizza they are so well known for, and I think I might just be off the diet to have the cannoli too.",0.9358,0.859,0.141,0.0,0.6785714285714286

I'll just order take out from Pizza Art Cafe from now on.  Waaaay  more of a value.",0.8924,0.79,0.174,0.036,0.5375000000000001
2008-07-09,4.0,"I decided to give O'fame 4 stars because I am still bitter than they closed the location on Webster.  My brain says 5 stars, but I'm a woman scorned. I am originally a Michigan gal, and don't get the whole meat-patty-saucy-soup that Chicagoans call ""stuffed pizza.""  I like pizza thin, a little floppy, and I am very particular.  When we found O'fame- what a treasure- almost perfect pizza every time!  Their cheese is a little bit browned (well-done), and the crust isn't rock-hard.  So crave-worthy. Imagine my heartbreak when we drive past and see the little sign in the window- worst break-up note I ever read.  They moved north, much too far to deliver to us in Old Town.  Now I'm on the rebound with places that just don't compare. Pretty soon I might have to get stalky and make my way up Lincoln Ave for some carryout.  Yes, I am a weirdo about pizza... but theirs is just damn good.  Also their logo reminds me of an 80's movie, and that's just fun times for everyone.",-0.2671,0.764,0.115,0.121,0.5546296296296296

2008-06-08,2.0,"I went here last Saturday night to pick up a quick meal.  My girlfriend and myself really wanted some simple pasta, so we both ordered pasta and marinara sauce.  I had spaghetti and meatballs and she had rigatoni.  When we both got home and started to dig in, we were both incredibly underwhelmed!  I dare say average, at best.  First off, I asked the lady at the counter if the pastas were homemade and there was a long pause and she finally said 'yes.'  Hmmm, I guess I should say that I wasn't surprised when I got home and concluded that the pasta was most certainly not homemade and probably boxed!  Hey, I realize that making your own pasta is time intensive and difficult, but don't try to pass off Barilla as the real deal.  The marinara was decent, a bit thick and dark with a sort of wine-y flavor, but i've certainly had better.  The meatballs were average, being a definite blend of pork, veal and probably beef...they were tender, but I felt that they lacked seasoning.  Overall, for $10 a plate of pasta, I think you could do better on many different levels at many different establishments.  I'll have to give their pizza a shot, I remember the pie in their old Lincoln Park shop to be pretty good.",0.9776,0.864,0.122,0.014,0.5231770833333333
2008-05-17,4.0,"This is O'Fame's newest location and let me say I like it a lot.  The crust is thin and the ends are super crunchy.  I ordered a large with sausage, hot peppers and tomato.  There was plenty of toppings to go around and the sauce was just about right.  I think I'll ask for a little extra sauce next time, but other than that it was a great pie.  The delivery was quick for a friday night and the person on the phone couldn't have been nicer.  I will be ordering from them again in the near future.",0.7744,0.868,0.101,0.032,0.46776556776556777
