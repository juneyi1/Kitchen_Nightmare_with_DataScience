2012-06-20,2.0,"I've always enjoyed Erwin - until last nite.  They have a good, creative menu and a warm and welcoming atmosphere.   The problem last nite was the terrible service from our female server.  We had over an hour to eat before theater which she knew and yet, we ended up dashing out without coffee because of her inattentiveness.   There seems to be plenty of servers in the main dining room but she also covered the bar area and, in her defense, was probably overwhelmed.  It was also inappropriate for her to blame me for not serving my desert by saying I had still been eating when, in fact, we waited about 15 minutes between courses for her to pay some attention.   The management should make sure there's enough coverage in both the bar and dining room, especially before an event in the neighborhood.  And, they should give their staff some customer service training.",0.5927,0.85,0.097,0.054,0.5768518518518518

We had the groupon so it made the prices more reasonable.  We did hear they are closing on July 1 though, which is disappointing since we finally found a great place.

2012-05-27,4.0,"On this recent visit to erwin, my partner and I were noticing that even though we can't give a solid 4* on any one dimension, we like the place overall. We've been there a few times over the past 15(?) years or so, and make it a point to come back every so often. My sense is that the food and service have slipped a notch over the years, but there's just something about the place that feels good, even if it's not at the top of my list. Tonight, a beet salad with watercress and ricotta salata was fresh and flavorful. Whitefish over quinoa was good, if a bit subdued. Ditto a pork chop. A side of garlic spinach was nicely done: good flavor, not soggy. Peanut butter mousse cake was appropriately indulgent and attractively plated. The wine list offers many good choices at affordable prices. Our server was attentive, if not very polished. I was a bit apprehensive when I found out they had live jazz (too often, live jazz completely overpowers a small room like this), but I was pleasantly surprised - the music was tasteful, well performed and did not interfere with conversation.

2012-05-26,2.0,"I've visited Erwin several times over the past ten years. It's typically reliable food, if lacking excitement, but good and cozy, with modest bills and little regret. So when I recently saw a Groupon for Erwin I jumped. Granted, it's been a few years since I've been, but I can also guarantee it will be even longer before I return, if at all.  A few complains: sever was professional, if lacking in sincerity. Normally I wouldn't complain, but we were dining on a Friday evening and looking to settle into our bottle of wine and not be rushed. She began by referring to their otherwise well-conceived prix fixe as ""the economy option for those who need that"" which I found simply annoying and a bit degrading to the restaurant and patron alike. The food, which, sadly, contained a season's worth of salt, was rushed out so fast you'd think we were eating at matinee hour. All of this proves to be even more frustrating when we're only halfway through our bottle of wine and dessert is thrust onto the table with the check. Fine, I say to myself, we'll pack it up and head home.  This is when the evening goes from mediocre to a disaster. As I'm corking my bottle--since we were hardly given ample time to eat and drink (bearing in mind it's about 9:45p on Friday night)-- the front of the house manager runs over to tell me I cannot take my wine out. Confused, I refute, and he goes on to explain that Erwin, the owner, did not want to pay the city fees for the second part of a two part license allowing patrons to recork their wine.  The bill allowing patrons to do so, which went into effect in 2007, simply amends the current Illinois Liquor Code to allow each restaurant in Illinois to recork and place into a tamper-proof bag one bottle of partially consumed wine. I've done this countless times and I have never, ever, had a restaurant prevent me from doing so. Had my food not been rushed out I may have had a chance to finish my wine. Such is life. I can appreciate the restaurant owner's prerogative, but then it's also incumbent on Erwin to accept the social and legal norm in Chicago, which is for restaurant owners to pay the fee, and be candid and upfront; choosing to prevent patrons from recorking should be met with a disclaimer on the wine list.  Ultimately, what bothers me most, I'm afraid to say, is that if Erwin is too cheap to pay the fee to keep pace with other business owners, I'm afraid to think of how infrequently they probably buy food and how long they store their meat and seafood. I'm sorry if business is slow or even desperately poor, but it's highly unlikely I'll return to Erwin.",-0.9347,0.837,0.076,0.088,0.5075661375661374

On Laila C.'s recommendation, I ordered the flank steak and eggs.  I'm always a little hesitant about ordering this combo at brunch places, because I've been burned too many times by steaks that were so dry and flavorless you can build decks with them.  But oh boy, these were AMAZING.  Try them rare; they're a little sweet, but with a texture that almost reminded me of sashimi.  I have fallen in love. The steak was so good that I nearly forgot about the potatoes, but ah, the potatoes.  Now, if there's anything one needs to know about me, it's the fact that I live and die by potatoes.  These were perfect -- big, chunky pieces that were just the right amount of mushy, with skin and onions and all kind of delicious herbiness. The portions were big, but all three of us finished our plates; that was how good it was.  Other niceties:  they dropped off an entire carafe of coffee at our table, along with a glass bottle of water.  The whole place was cleanly decorated and pleasantly lit, contributing to a cozy, happy feeling even when it was raining and gloomy outside.",0.9897,0.77,0.183,0.047,0.5788188002473718

2012-05-06,2.0,"Poor service, average food. A big disappointment for Easter Brunch. After living in Lakeview for 3 years, I had always heard that Erwin was a great traditional spot, that offered quality food and a more relaxed upscale atmosphere. So, I decided to bring my family here for Easter Brunch.  At first sitting, I poured half of cup of coffee, from the canisters on the table, and immeditatly after taking one sip, stopped drinking. As my other family members agreed, it was some of the worst coffee we have had in a long time - it tasted burnt and like it had been sitting out for hours. Nothing to complain about at that point, but surely bad enough not to keep drinking. The rest of our meal was fine -nothing spectacular, but good for Brunch.  It was the end of our meal, and our extremely rude waitress that really made me upset that we dined here in the first place. After receiving our bill, which as all tables received, included a $20 credit for your next visit.  At this point on the bill, we noticed that we were each charged $3.50 for the half cups of bad coffee that we didn't drink. After asking the server about that, she became extremely defensive and argumentative with the coffee, and that it was top of the line coffee. So much so that other tables started to notice how rude she was being to our table, and commented to us afterwards. As to her suggestion,  she agreed to take one cup of coffee off the bill, but when she returned with the updated receipt, she took away our original $20 credit coupon.  At this point, we had had enough with the poor service and weren't going to argue the $20 credit back, but did kindly write on the receipt, to not argue with your customers  - especially on Easter. So, as much as one cup of coffee shouldn't ruin a dining experience, it did for Erwin.",-0.2446,0.758,0.124,0.119,0.5009523809523808

Suffice it to say, there was a mistake made a we were presented with a bill with a significant overcharge. It took me and the people I was dining with probably 15 minutes to figure out what she had done with the bill, and when we finally figured it out, there was no apology, and she was very reluctant to remedy the error at all.

2012-04-15,3.0,"After striking out with four other restaurants in the area that were closed, we finally found Erwin with tables abound.  The giant green awning displaying the restaurant's name (who is the owner), called out to us with a long standing neighborhood presence, one that I've known, but never met.  The interior is small, and with the whimsical murals on the walls, it feels a bit country.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant, with the majority of clientele in the ""early bird dinner"" crowd.  With few tables full, it took quite awhile for our server to finally greet us and take our drink order.  She seemed distant, and we had much more interaction with our busser throughout the meal.   Starting with the bread service, the accompanying white bean spread is a welcome change from butter.  Packed with flavor, I ate up way more carbs than I needed to transfer this tasty spread to my palate.  I decided to go with the prix fixe, beginning with Vidalia onion soup, which was by far the best course of the night.  After consuming my small cup, I noticed the next table (a loud group of North Shore old money twenty somethings and their parents) receiving a much more artful presentation of the same soup, in a much larger bowl with soup doled out of a beautiful copper pot table side.  I felt a little cheated, as I'm pretty sure I would have appreciated the service more than the preppy frat boys did.  Main course was mussels in a tomato, sausage, and white bean broth.  The mussels were definitely not flown in that morning, but disguised in the sauce, they were fine.  Dessert was disappointing, a watery orange pudding cake that left me craving a supplemental dessert course.  We also tried the burger, which was a hefty patty surrounded by well seasoned fries.  For $15, it was good, but not worth a return visit.",0.9856,0.836,0.126,0.038,0.458459595959596

Service: Impeccably professional, thoroughly impressed by the bus service in particular. Menu: Refreshingly creative items that don't try too hard - i.e., brussel sprouts and sweet potato hash; bacon-wrapped medjool dates that aren't served with the same old Spanish sauce but smothered in smokey barbecue flavors and stuffed with gorgonzola cheese (dates are juicy and not overcooked, what a delight). The attention to greens throughout the meal should be commended - always fresh and also a good selection to compliment the dish (arugula with fried green tomatoes, mescalin with bacon-wrapped dates). The crab cakes were phenomenal, perfectly light and fresh and accompanied with carrot spaghetti drizzled with sesame ginger sauce.  Wine and liquor: Good, edited collection to choose from in terms of wine, beers, bourbons, whiskeys and cordials. Ambiance: Not the best. As mentioned, the decor is a bit confusing for a restaurant of this caliber - you feel like you could be at a New England seaside restaurant.

The mixed green salad was better but again, uninteresting.   The burger was good, meat was very flavorful and the liver excellent.   Good, affordable wine list.  We had a  restaurant.com  coupon so the price was great.",0.9775,0.74,0.205,0.055,0.5067460317460318

""Cheers"" she said as she served me a beer. I wanted a martine, but $14.50?  Must be good!  probably not something I should have on a weekday anyway since I'm giving up alcohol during the week. I enjoyed seeing very senior citizens enjoying a meal, a guy eating the tastiest-looking porkchop ever at the bar, new dates, women catching up. Great for everyone. The host was so nice. Always a smile. Updated us twice on the availability of a table. Once we were seated I had a recessed light shining brightly on me. I mentioned it to my husband and all of the sudden the light dimmed. I looked around and lo .... the host had heard and waved. We all had a nice little laugh.  The waitress suggested the de Pouy instead of the Chardonnay. I wasn't too happy at first - really wanted something very dry but she had said the  Chardonnay wasn't soo good. The de Pouy was like a sauvignon blanc and I wanted dry. Oh well. Once I got my food, it was fine.  The food? WOW! The menu had some specials and they looked good. My husband had the prix fixe menu which had some linguine and heirloom tomatoes. weird - I'm the one who likes heirloom tomatoes!  But hey - it was only 18 bucks!  So, me?  I had the pan-roasted whitefish.  O    M     G! It was perfectly done - like eating a bit of crab meat - very meaty texture. It was on top of a bed of quinoa, creme fraiche, prosciutto and corn.  SOOO good. Even when the fish was gone, I was feasting on the corn and quinoa. The wine was a very generous pour. In fact, they say one serving is 1/3 of a bottle. No wonder I felt a bit tipsy driving home. The beer and wine list seemed pretty good. The beer was off the beaten path - maybe even local but I wasn't sure.  I had the Avery IPA. Craig had something called the Lost Brown Ale. Both good. The wine? His Pinot Noir was yummy. My white wine - okay.  Service?  Awesome. Friendly. Happy. Always there when we were ready to order. The guys cleaning the table?  Never intrusive.  The decor? Interesting. It was like eating in a shanty town seaside restaurant but the food was like eating gourmet. I wondered if the food is all local. Could be. White fish?  Yeah - from wisconsin maybe. Salmon?  Not sure. There was a type of very simple wood wall covering on most of the walls up to about a foot from the ceiling - somewhat like wainscoating but something you'd find in a cabin - very rough. Above the wainscoating, partial images of country, seaside, and nature in that foot band around the ceiling.

The food is really solidly good. It's like home-cooked food by your favorite family chef. What's great is that the menu changes every month or two so I never get bored. M loves the cherry pie made with real cherries (not that canned stuff that is overly sweet). I am personally crazy about the bacon wrapped dates. Every once in a while we get food that doesn't blow us away (it's just food), but that's okay. We are still pleased overall. The libations also please. I've definitely gotten tipsy at least once because, boy oh boy! The drinks can be strong! Besides that, they don't have a cocktail menu, so don't expect anything too creative. I think the service is particularly good too. Even on busy nights, the servers bust their chops to be attentive. Sometimes I even get to see Erwin, the chef and owner! I usually don't write about this in reviews, but the crowd at Erwin is usually elderly and white.

We were, as I'd hoped, seated immediately.  I got some hot tea - you get a selection of Stash brand teas, and a large teapot filled with hot water for your convenience.  They're happy to refill with more water if you need it.  I ended up getting the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, goat cheese, scallions, spinach, and peppers.  I have to say - it was not my favorite brunch dish.  The first few bites were good, but the richness from the cheese and the smokiness of the salmon made it a hard dish to finish!  It's clearly fresh and well-made, but it is a substantial portion of strongly flavored food.  I suppose it just wasn't for me. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food more, my parents commenting that the basil sausage in particular was very good.  Service is genuine and attentive.

2011-05-17,2.0,"I should have known when we got a drink at the bar that Erwin's wasn't going to be all it was cracked up to be. Being a resident in a new city - nothing is more fun than venturing around my 'hood and figuring out what is around...and who are the good, the bad and the ugly in that group.  I read a lot of reviews trying to find a great place for my stepfather and I to enjoy a nice dinner out. People had great things to say about Erwin's and considering it was just a short walk from my place, I made an 8:30 reservation and waited for my stepfather to meet up with me. Even though we were 10 minutes late for our reservation - the host was extremely nice and still had us at the top of the list to get to seated as soon as a table was available. So here is where started to go downhill. We went to the bar to order a drink while waiting for our table. The bartender was nice but distracted and a bit slow moving. The bar wasn't particularly full, so OK we had to wait a bit to order a drink - no big. Well once he did pay attention to us, we ordered Beefeater (gin) and tonic in a tall glass. What we got instead was something between a gin and tonic, and a gin martini served in a martini glass. Very confusing. Shortly after we got our drinks, our table was ready so we brushed off the strange drink presentation and were looking forward to some dinner. We had a female waitress who was very nice and patient with us when we couldn't decide on what wine to get with our dinner. She actually went and asked the chef what Spanish red was best on their menu - but we'll get to that later. They have a pretty straight forward menu which I appreciate. There are about 5 starters to choose from and maybe 5 or 6 entrées to choose from as well. They also had two entrées on special. We grilled our waitress on which options were better -  the specialty menu v. the standard menu. She was pretty good at explaining what things were supposed to taste or look like, but I kind of felt like she was pushing the specials on us a bit.  We ended up settling on the onion tart and the bacon wrapped dates for starters. The 'tart' was a flat piece of whole wheat crust topped with caramelized onion, danish blue cheese and pecans. Bacon wrapped dates were stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese, fired grilled and drizzled with cider vinaigrette. For our entrees we both decided to go from the specialty menu because the waitress did do a great sold selling us and they sounded pretty darn tasty. My stepfather went with the soft shell crab and I went with the veal steak. We also went ahead and ordered the tempranillo wine the chef had recommend. This is where things took a turn from 'interesting' to not good. The wine arrived and I'm not sure if it needed to breathe more or what but it was one of the more lack-luster bottles of tempranillo I've ever had. My stepdad and I both love bold, spicy reds which is what we expressed to our waitress - so we were surprised that the chef, of all people, recommended something so mild. OK, the wine isn't good. It happens then next thing I know our entrees are coming out and our starters are completely missing. The waitress was very apologetic and got the dates and tart out to us quickly, but I was surprised after she checked in on us a fews times once our wine arrived that she never noticed that our starters had not made it out to our table. So now we have a table full of food, it looks pretty good and smells pretty good so this is the point where everything is going to turn around right?!? Wrong. Starters - The great thing about pairing dates with bacon is you get that perfect mix of savory and sweet. In my opinion they could have wrapped the dates in a much smaller piece of bacon to really allow the dates and Gorgonzola to shine. Side note - my mom does make bacon wrapped figs and dates for Christmas sometimes so I could be biased from the start. The onion tart was one of the better things on the table in my opinion. The onions were delicious and even though I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese I felt like the sweetness of the onion balanced the strong cheese very well and the pecan was nice little crunch in the midst.  Entrees - When I ordered the veal our waitress had asked if medium-rare was OK temperature. I love a perfect medium rare so I was more than happy to hear that is how the veal steak was going to be cooked. What showed up on my plate however was barely a medium. It was under seasoned and, for me, rather forgettable. My stepdad did a little better with the soft shell crab but again it was good, but forgettable. The interior of the restaurant was clean and comfortable. Even though the dining room was full you were able to hear the person across from you and converse without yelling at one another. Definitely a let down in a lot of capacities.",0.9996,0.754,0.206,0.039,0.5460078374784259

2011-04-17,5.0,"Erwin's location is kind of strange -- a pretty empty (restaurant-wise) area on Halsted. The restaurant is worth making the trip for however -- this place is a culinary gem. The seasonal vegetables are what really make Erwin shine. I have eaten here twice, and while the protein is awesome (and I love me some meat), the vegetables are the star. Highlights: Beet Salad -- I have honestly never had beets that good in my entire life. It's hard to get excited about a beet -- but they are so fresh, delicious at Erwin you will end up telling your friends about em. The cheese they serve them with is also a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the beet. Flank Steak -- When I went with the fam my dad ordered this and told me it is one of the best steaks he has ever had (and he is quite a connoisseur). I tried a piece of it with the Chipotle Sauce accompaniment and I have to agree with him. Spicy, smoky, sweet flavor that is explosive but not overpowering, and the steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection.   Mushroom Cake -- This meatless wonder was the star of the show. Soft, almost crab-cake like texture inside and a perfectly crispy exterior. I will be coming back for these. Peanut Butter Mousse Cake -- Whoa. This is one of the greatest things I have ever stuck down the ole throat hole. My date and I were both stuffed after dinner but wanted to try something from the desert menu. We practically licked the plate clean, and the slice they gave us was so massive I think it altered the gravitational field around our table.   The service was excellent, the wine list impressive, and the decor rustic, comfortable, and inviting.

I ended up eating her dish, and she mine.  The texture of her 'fried' dish also was not very good, the skin of the fish was covered in sauce and became very slimy, just kind of outputting and frustrating when you are paying $20+ for an entree.

As with all post-run brunches, we started with drinks.  I don't know how Erwin's regular Bloody Mary's are, but the one I requested with extra horseradish was spectacular.  For brunch, I had the scrambled eggs with baby spinach, goat cheese and salmon and was really happy with my choice - and I am not a great lover of eggs.  The chef can cook!   Everyone in my group was happy with their food and we never felt rushed or unwelcome, even being slightly sweaty and dressed like leprechauns.  I'm looking forward to trying Erwin for dinner with my husband.",0.6568,0.719,0.156,0.125,0.5341222879684419

There was nothing bad about the meal, there just wasn't anything that stood out either. For the price point, I have received better meals at many other places in Chicago and do not think I will be returning anytime soon.  The service was good, very straightforward and efficient. No complaints in that regard, everyone was friendly.  The atmosphere was very nice and quaint, definitely not trying to be trendy, which I appreciated.  The food was just OK, my wife and I both felt our dishes were under-seasoned and rather boring. I had the trout and she had the whitefish and we both just shrugged our shoulders at it. What little flavor did show up in the dish was nice, but neither dish worked as a whole for us. The texture of my dish also was not very good, the skin of the fish was covered in sauce and became very slimy, I also had a couple of bones in my fish as well. Just kind of off-putting and frustrating when you are paying $20+ for an entree. Dessert was also mediocre at best, but again nothing necessarily wrong with it. I left feeling like it should have been better and maybe on most nights it is, but do not think I will be returning anytime soon to find out, even though I feel bad saying it because the concept and idea of the place seemed great to me.",0.9921,0.774,0.196,0.031,0.568405205905206

The food isn't the best ever - it's okay, nothing wrong with it but nothing special. I had the salmon which was good, but my side order of brussel spouts were very overcooked and mushy. I have food allergies and the waiter didn't really understand that I really needed him to ask the chef what was in the meal and not have him guess. He finally asked the chef after I had to ask him a couple times to do so. You can't just guess when it comes to food allergies! Atmosphere is very nice and relaxing.

2010-11-08,4.0,"I had dinner plans with my friend Sarah last Friday. It was her, her husband and their adorable 15 month old son joining me for dinner. I was lost as where to go, (not being up to date on my family friendly places), but when Erwin was suggested, I was certainly open to trying.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. Bring a 15 month old out to dinner!? Well, their son is and was well behaved that night and the staff couldn't have been friendlier in helping us out.  I had rave reviews from friends and clients who have dined here in the past and really, they weren't far off. The wine list is good, the food even better. We sat down around 7:15pm, the parents making sure the wee one was well fed and sleepy, servers working around us, making sure we had what we needed and anything else and all with a smile.   Now walking in, you might notice the crowd is certainly older then mid thirties, but please, don't let that stop you. We certainly didn't stop with one appetizer, going with the fried green tomatoes, (delicious, flavorful, though a little heavy on the sauce for my part), Cesare salad, (good, but your normal salad with some nice slices of anchovies), and their special of the night which was their free form ravioli topped with tallegio cheese and veal stock sauce over the top, (and certainly there wasn't enough bread to soak up that delicious sauce). We eagerly munched away, sipping a great d'abruzzo or malbec and enjoying the soft music and good conversation.  On with the main courses, the escarole was meaty and had a wonderful slightly sweet glaze over it which paired well with the sugar snap peas and corn underneath. My whitefish was cornmeal crusted and pan fried, but certainly well prepared with quinoa and sweet potato underneath though wasn't a huge fan of the cranberry ginger compote was a little strong for the fish, so I left it off to the side. The flank steak was a medium rare, but the chipotle barbecue sauce was really outstanding with a nice touch of heat and ever so slight hint of sweetness. The cheesy and creamy turnips we had was surprising and all in a good way. Certainly more mild then the turnips I have had in the past, but a crowd pleaser none the less.  Dessert was a bit of a battle, with all of us wanting a fourth, but we managed well with our three. The sour cherry pie, apparently one of their signature dishes, was a real winner since all that remained of it afterward was the spoon and bowl. The lemon goat cheese souffle cheesecake was certainly the husbands favorite and he certainly enjoyed his large and stacked portion. I, being the chocolate lover that I can be, went with the double chocolate banana split sundae. If you need a chocolate fix, with the nice wedges of brownies, the decadent rich chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce, the caramelized bananas, certainly would have cured any chocolate fiend's tweaked out need. Price point, a little more on the special side, but certainly nothing outrageous. I could see this become more of a once a month if not twice if I lived closer and had the chance to go.  Did I mention the vibe here? With all the wood work, I wouldn't call this place cutting edge in the design style, but the soft lights, the welcoming service, the light jazz, certainly made us feel at home, perfect for a catch up night with friends or a little more intimate of an evening with that someone special.

Since I'd already perused the menu online a few times (like I always do) I already knew i wanted the flank steak and eggs. My friend after getting help from the server also decided on the same thing. Wow...I'm soo glad we both got the same thing because I would've hated to share even a bite of the SUPER juicy, flavorful, amazing steak! Each bite of the steak with some runny egg and potatoes was phenomenal. I'm generally very picky about morning potatoes but these were made exactly how my ideal potatoes should be made. Mushy with lots of flavor and bits of onions.  There was a LOT of food on the plate and although I wasn't planning on eating the whole thing, I found it impossible to stop eating. Bite after bite of joy entered my mouth and my will power to stop weaned with each bite.  I even managed to eat an entire toast topped with 2 packets of whipped butter. Even I knew to appreciate the delicious bread.  And the service was good too. Never an empty water cup and they were so eager to fill my friend' coffee cup she had to tell our server to just leave us alone. Overall a really really wonderful brunch.

We started out with the onion tart app, I wish it had a bit more blue cheese to cut down on the onion a bit. It was also a bit bigger than I imagined. For dinner I had the trout and it was served with the head. I love when restaurants do that. I even took a pic of it and sent it to twitter. The ragout and snap peas it was served with were delicious and fresh and I only wish there were more of it. Our sides were the hand cut french fries and the potato au gratin. I LOVED the potatoes and finished the dish while my sister loved the fries and ate more of them. We also drank prosecco with dinner because I have been seeing it pop up more and more recently. I first had it at Chicago Gourmet then Alpana Singh recommended it as a gift to bring to a host at a party. I thought it complimented the dinner well and wasn't too sweet or too heavy. The thing I love about Erwin is the every changing menu of fresh seasonal ingredients.

Erwin was delightful in all respects - food, service and decor.  I seriously judge a restaurant by the quality of their table bread; once I tried the fluffy yet crusty bread topped with a dollop of the white bean spread (not butter), I knew we would be having a good dining experience.  Being the...budget-conscious diners that we are, we went with the $18 3-course special. We got a cup of rich, velvety butternut squash soup with apple cider cream to start. That was followed by a filet of salmon in a lobster/bacon creamy broth studded with chunks of sweet potato. To finish off our meal was a homemade blood orange soda float with vanilla ice cream. This wasn't my favorite part - and believe me I was seriously tempted to sub in one of the other amazing sounding desserts for an extra $4, but it was good nonetheless. My boyfriend loved it - but he likes orange flavored things more than me.  I also ordered a glass of the Torrontes (crisp, grapefruity, but not overpowering) and was delighted.  The ambiance offered some mid level lighting with table lamps. A nice progression of a ""day in Chicago"" ran a mural along all the walls.

All of the options on the menu sounded delicious, but I opted for the smoked salmon scramble, which also had spinach, goat cheese, and scallions.  I was expecting a small to decently sized portion, and I got a monstrous plate of scrambled eggs, complete with rosemary home fries and some of the best, thickest, toasted whole grain bread.  The potatoes were a little too greasy for my liking, but the eggs were pure comfort food.  The amount of goat cheese made the dish very rich, so I was unable to finish and felt as though I couldn't fit anything else into my stomach for a week (but I miraculously managed to, within an hour).

2010-08-04,3.0,"The owners of Erwin have done a brilliant job with their clients. It seemed as though they knew almost everyone who came in. They've fostered the good will through great customer service and I think it goes to show that a warm smile and attention to the customers can overcome almost anything. ..a recession, a strange location and even hit and miss food. My parents live 2 blocks away from Erwin and I think they have gone once a month for the last ten years. When they want to go out and don't know where to go, this is the place they rely on. That translates to trust: a trust that they will be treated well and will have solid food that they know.  For me though, I can't get the hang of this place. There is something strange to me. It could be the decor or lighting, which despite having a comfortable ""homey"" vibe just comes off a little drab. More than anything, I think it's just not my palette. I often judge restaurants (perhaps unfairly) by how I feel when I look at the menu. Do I want to eat EVERYTHING? If I do, then that bodes well for my experience. I look at the Erwin menu and I have trouble finding something I want. Each dish has one ingredient where I'm like...no. Maybe I need to eat here more.

2010-08-01,4.0,"The staff here is super friendly and accommodating. Our server (Monica?) was stellar--she spaced things out well, and did not require us to order all of our items at once. At first I thought this may result in a lot of waiting between courses, but at 9-9:30 on a Friday night, the kitchen was firing the food out quite quickly. By about 10, the action was definitely starting to die down, so I would recommend coming in by 9. While Erwin has a casual feel and you get the sense that you could come as you are, the restaurant is decidedly more upscale than many of the other options in Lakeview. If you know LV restaurants well and like offerings like Yoshi's Café, you should definitely walk down two blocks to give this a shot. The prices are quite accessible, and portions generous for this class of restaurant. The fried green tomatoes (with bacon) were excellent, as was an appetizer off a special menu, recommended by the server, consisting of cheese wrapped in Italian meat and then wrapped in a roasted red pepper with an olive tapenade. Very flavorful. After our entrees, we did not have room for dessert. While the location feels a bit off the beaten path, it is easily within walking distance from the action on Halsted, Broadway, Belmont or Diversey. I appreciated the space--which is not crammed into a deep but narrow space as so many LV/LP restaurants are. The large central bar is a nice focal point, and my martini was tasty and really big!

2010-07-02,3.0,"Solid. Our party of five ate here last night; two of us had the $18 New Deal prix fixe special, three ordered a la carte. We started with fried green tomatoes and stuffed dates; the tomatoes were pretty good, not spicy like other places, and the dates were good and on par with other restaurants' stuffed dates, but the portions were a bit stingy (4). The ND starter was some sort of sweet onion soup - it was like a sweet minestrone, not horrible but I just wasn't into all that sugar. The ND entree was a crispy rainbow trout with three little shrimp on top - the crispiness was very nice, but the fish was underseasoned. It came with a side of average potato salad and half an ear of very buttered corn on the cob - I thought these cheapened the dish; they would've done better with some mashed potatoes, roasted veggies, couscous, etc. The other entrees were the pork chop, burger, and mushroom cakes - all were sufficient but not exceptional. All entrees tended to be under-salted, which is fine because you can always add salt on your own. Then we had the ND dessert, which was a blood orange ice cream soda. It was only ok - my problem with it was some fairly large ice crystals in the ice cream. Overall: Acceptable for one meal, but it will not be added to my regular rotation of restaurants.",0.9763,0.805,0.152,0.043,0.5168897194759264

2010-03-30,5.0,"What a pleasant surprise! Who knew that erwin would deliver on such a delightful evening? After all, I have driven by this place countless times never giving it more than a passing glance, so when a friend suggested dinner here the other night, I jumped at the chance to check it out.  We went on a Friday night. We arrived a few minutes late for our reservation but the host was delightful, welcoming us to the restaurant asking if it was our first time and really making us feel like one of his regular customers.  The space is lovely, if not simple. A large mahogany cabinet separates the bar area from the dining room. The walls are painted a light green and there are murals that mimic the rooftops in the neighborhood painted throughout. Named after the chef, erwin (purposely with a small ""e"", and you will know why if you meet the chef) as it has always been about the customer, not about him.  We were seated in the back at a cozy corner table (next time I'm going to ask to sit in one of the booths by the front window) but on this night it was perfect. Our server was over in a flash with menus, a detailed explanation of the specials and then he sped off to grab us our drinks.  The menu is chock full of American specialties, from starters like wrapped dates to fried green tomatoes, and entrees that ranged from steak to fish.  We started with the fried green tomatoes. Perfectly crunchy, served with greens and buttermilk dressing, they were good, but didn't rival the goat cheese topped ones that I had recently at the Southern.  As for our entrees, I went with the pork chop (served with mashed potatoes) and my friend had the burger which according to our server won the best burger contest from Time Out Magazine. I have to admit- it was really tasty (and I've eaten a few burgers in my day!) My pork chop was perfectly done, thick and juicy. For dessert we just had to try the ice cream sandwich (chocolate chip banana bread served with cappuccino ice cream and caramel sauce . . . .really?) and the sour Michigan cherry pie served with vanilla ice cream. In my book the pie was certainly the winner (being a Michigan girl and all) but they were both delicious and certainly ""calorie worthy""!  With entrees in the $13 to $25 range, our dinner with drinks, entrees and dessert came in around $100. If you drive, know that there is valet parking out in front, and depending on the night you go, once you pay if you go late enough, you may just be able to leave your car there on the street to visit other businesses in the area.  I love places that take care of the customer like I am dining in their own home. And erwin pulls that off beautifully. Outstanding food, great service, all served up in a little neighborhood place?

My friend had the pheasant thigh with risotto.  It looked delicious and she enjoyed it, but I didn't try it, so I can't say if it was good.  It looked really nice, I must say. I had the mushroom cakes and it was pretty delicious.  It's always nice to see a great vegetarian option on the menu.  The mushroom cake was full of bulgur, spinach, mushroom and other grains.  Truly delicious! The great thing about Erwins is that their menu always changes and they have lots of specialty meat options like pheasant, duck, liver, etc. My review for them is a little mixed, b/c although I can recognize that they make some quality food, none of the items on the menu was of interest to me.

2010-02-02,4.0,"Somewhere along the line I scored a $25 gift cert to Erwin otherwise I never would have known about it. Even though it's on Halsted it is a slightly awkward location and despite having walked by many times I've seriously never noticed it. Maybe I'm just nuts, whatever. Turns out Erwin has the potential to be one of my new favorites.  Erwin has a very old feel when you walk in. The wooden booths, tables, and wall decor all felt a bit dated but cozy. I suggest doing your best to get into one of the booths in front by the windows. Best seats in the house. Otherwise you run the risk of sitting at one of the smaller tables in the center of all the hustle and bustle of servers walking by and other people. The atmosphere is definitely casual, even the servers were wearing jeans but I still think it's nice to look nice when dining out.  We started with the dates which were delicious. Warm, soft, and a zip of Gorgonzola in the middle. They also brought bread to the table with a great hummus-like spread instead of butter. Loved it. Our server helped us pick a great bottle of wine and was very friendly and patient with us while we drooled over the entrees. I had the flank steak with mashed potatoes which was perfect. It was cooked perfectly, the mashed were great, and I loved the zippy flavor of the caramelized onions. My dinner companion had the crab cakes which he said were ""good"". I'm not much for seafood but I took a bite anyway and they seemed pretty standard to me. You can order one as an app or two as an entree, but frankly I don't think even two would be very filling.  Lastly we ordered dessert and went the totally gluttonous route of each ordering our own instead of sharing one which we easily could have done. I had the peanut butter mousse cake and was in heaven. It was creamy, very rich, and I absolutely loved the crust. Second dessert was the brownie which was also amazing. It was soft, warm, and had a strong cocoa flavor which I enjoy.  Now with all that food that we ordered and a bottle of wine, our bill was just under $100 after the gift cert. I was pleasantly surprised because I was prepared to spend way more. When our awesome server came back to our table with the receipt to sign she also gave us another coupon for $20 off our next meal. That sealed the deal, I definitely would recommend and will be back!  PS - I just realized they have brunch!

Note regarding the wine prices, many glasses are $10-$12 which is a little on the high side, but bottles of the same wine were only $34-$40. Much better bottle value if you're going to have a couple glasses.  I generally hate the term ""cozy"" when describing an atmosphere, but on a cold night the interior was temperature warm, crowded without being jam packed, and tables are generally close together without being annoying. Find a better term than cozy if you wish.  Start with the Gorgonzola stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Awesome, and made even better with a red wine. The Arctic Char special, similar to salmon, was also very good. The Chipotle Steak was a risky order, but the steak wasn't covered in sauce as I had feared. Just a small amount underneath to enhance the flavor of the perfectly prepared medium rare beef. A good sauteed spinach side enhanced the meal.  A couple entrees, bottle of wine, an app, and a side were around $90. Coupon for a future visit. Bonus. I will be back.",0.9936,0.725,0.231,0.045,0.5794196428571429

Our waitress was very helpful and provided excellent insight into the menu, although midway through the meal, she did disappear for a bit. I started with the gorgonzola stuffed dates, wrapped in maple bacon, which were every nuanced and flavorful. On recommendation of our waitress I ordered the duck & venison, with parsnip puree, cranberry-orange compote. I very much enjoyed the interaction of the supremely tender meats, with the cranberry-orange compote. The flavors were sumptuous and tasty. The one issue I did take with the entree was the interaction of the parsnip puree, which had a really interesting taste, and the rest of the entree. The tastes just didn't mesh and form a complete taste for me. I suspect it was the strength of the parsnips and the fruit compote. For dessert I enjoyed the sour cherry pie, which was stuffed full of cherries, striking a perfect balance between sweet and sour. Unlike most pies, which are too sweet for my tastes, this was perfect. Other items of note, others in my party ordered the crab cakes and fried green tomatoes, which were both excellent.

We also shared a side order of mashed potatoes, more than enough for 2 people. We shared the chocolate banana brownie for dessert. It was an amazing meal, and the service was good too. I felt cared for but not at all rushed. The atmosphere was warm and not at all pretentious.

But after finally going for an impromptu dinner with some friends last night, I must say it's pretty sad I didn't get in here sooner (say, like 3 years ago!)  The menu is small, but had a lot of unique dishes. I've only been there once so I couldn't say definitively that it changes seasonally, but I know many of the dishes I saw last night would fall into that category: Beautiful summer gazpacho which was smokey and even a touch sweet because of the fresh tomatoes; Green beans; Corn dishes; Sour cherry pie. Oh the sour cherry pie, it was so, so, so good. The waitress also informed us of how they were getting cherries fresh from Michigan, and it translated into a tangy, but sweet pie with a flakey crust and french vanilla icecream to die for. It probably helped that my pie came with a candle in it for my birthday. The whole feel of the restaurant is elegant, with dim lighting and dark wood bars, but it has such laid back and whimsical accents like bird houses and murals that the place comes off feeing wonderfully relaxed.

Crab cakes great, fried green tomatoes great, my white fish great, cherry pie GREAT! Everything I put in my mouth was wonderful! And we even got $20 dollar off coupons for our next visit.  Maybe the best part of the whole experience was our waiter. He was clearly a talented actor and when my dad pried a bit we found out he was working on being a voice-over. He had a great voice and this somehow encouraged my (drunk) father that this should be a profession he should practice on us for the remainder of the evening.

The bread basket came with what I think was a hummus, which I was enjoying until the bus boy took it away without even asking if we were done.  A new one was brought a few minutes later, but I still think we should have been asked.  I started with the roasted beet salad: while the beets themselves were tasty, something about the grilled onions tasted strange and unpleasant, and I would have liked a little more ricotta in it.  Also, I don't know what the branches in my salad were but I was not brave enough to eat them.  I moved on to the skate as an entree and it was ok.  I tasted his pork chop and I think it could have used a little more seasoning, as could the accompanying potatoes.  The dessert menu was tempting but as I was full I passed. Our service was good but our server was a bit over the top; the way he spoke reminded me of a game show announcer and I was just about to ask Don Pardo what I won...It distracted me a bit throughout the night.  Also, the ambiance was a bit offputting for me, more country inn than I expected for the type of food served.

We also tried the mimosasyum, very good.

2009-03-25,4.0,"This place was pretty good.  I was a bit surprised by how many other reviewers gave it five stars.  Here's why: Erwin's menu consists of well made, relatively uncreative food.  The service was an odd mix of attentive and inattentive, in that the bus people were wonderfully attentive--refilling water glasses and fetching bread whenever necessary--but the servers themselves were spotty.  We rarely saw our server, and we actually began the evening with a different server than the one we ended up with (neither of them introduced themselves to us, or offered much commentary on the food).   The food itself was, as I mentioned, well made but uncreative.  The bacon-wrapped dates were wonderfully flavorful, but the bacon was somewhat overcooked.  I ordered the sausage ragout entree, and my boyfriend ordered the duck confit.  The duck was cooked perfectly (crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside), but the potatoes that came on the side were unpalatably overcooked.  The sausage ragout was a great combination of flavors, but texturally rather bland.  Neither dish knocked our socks off. The last thing I will say is: beware the bar.  Erwin has no cocktail menu, but does have a full array of liquors and mixers.  I ordered a pomegranate cocktail (on the server's recommendation).  I should have asked how much it cost, but I did not.  I never thought it would be $13!  Way too expensive for a simple, overly-sweet drink.",0.9741,0.867,0.115,0.018,0.5579192546583851

She felt the need to write the original total in large letters.  One time is forgivable, but then she wrote it a second time on the credit card copy.  Pam was more worried about her tip than our experience.  Maybe if she bothered to serve us and say more than five words she would not have been so concerned about her tip.   I said something to the host about her double scribble on the way out she was no where to be found.  She finally came out and said ""I am sorry you feel that way"".  My friends and I leave twenty percent always.  This is one time I was kicking my self for it.  Pam seems like she needs to move on from the service industry.  Bitter and battered. The funny thing is she thought she was being smart by writing that on the check and on the credit card copy.  It amount to about a dollar difference in tip.  Was it really worth offending four people that will never return and will tell everyone how bad Erwin is?  You just cost your self and your boss a lot more than a dollar Pam.  Not so smart.

First of all, they don't give you an abbreviated menu to choose from, I approve of this. I like to choose things I would normally eat, not from a special little menu of little food. I personally went with the Pear/gorgonzola salad to start, the scallops as an entree. Well done, although 2 scallops was a bit on the stingy side. It looked like an appetizer, and the ""normal"" price was $27. Had I paid $27 for it, I'd have been a tad annoyed...my friends both had the pasta, shrimp bacon extravaganza special, which was a healthy quantity, and quite tasty.  Oh, the best was certainly saved for last. An incorrect dessert was brought to our table, so we valiant women braved four lovely, decadent creations. The mocha pot de creme (fabulous), Michigan cherry pie (sugary crystaled crust, divine), the special of the night: bread pudding and a banana chocolate ice cream sandwich. Sufficiently stuffed, sugared and satisfied, to say the least.  Service was beyond adequate. Our server was attentive without hovering, and the busboys were top notch, no benchwarmers here. I especially liked the numerous coffee refills, and I do believe I'll likely be up til about 3am because of them.  Overall an excellent experience, however the crowd was decidedly older on a Wednesday night. I do believe a lot of regulars come in for the prixe fixe special.

I mean, I've been to Erwin bunches of times, and always loved what I've order- the duck, rabbit, fish, and most recently, jumbo scallops. Everything is tasty and served hot, with service akin to a day at the spa (attentive yet chill, informative without annoying).  That said, my boyfriend's steak was a blight on the record, and it wasn't just a 'matter of taste'. Now, I know that a steak-au-poivres or streak frites is not Ruth's Chris steakhouse-grade steak; it's a bistrot dish using the less expensive and, quite frankly, less desirable cuts of meat. That said, Erwin is a nice restaurant, the dish cost a significant amout of green, and it was really obvious that very little, if any, butchering was done. The steak was saddled with large chunks of fat, so much so that he couldn't take a bite without an extrodinary amount of surgery first. All in all, a nice, comfy spot for tasty viddles...just be careful to ask questions about the cuts of meat or fish when you order to ensure that it's in fact what you want.

2007-04-30,4.0,"This understated old Lakeview eatery surprised me. This definitely makes it on the map for foodies. Erwin has a relaxed ambience - this is not a ""see or been seen"" kind of  place. You could hang with your friends here - or bring in your mom. Its all about the food. Simple American dishes(like the humble hamburger) are taken and prepared to perfection. Hard to go wrong with any of the items on the menu. The wine selection is limited but I was not disappointed with the reds (including some full-bodied offerings from Argentina, Portugal and Australia).",0.8352,0.81,0.144,0.046,0.5159722222222222
2007-04-25,4.0,"The first thing that jumped out about Erwin (the restaurant) was how Erwin (the owner & chef) seems to know everyone who eats at his restaurant.  Seriously, in the five minutes that we waited for our table to be ready, Erwin must've said hi, hugged and/or kissed hello to at least 10 different people from three different parties.  Either Erwin is just a REALLY friendly guy or his customers like eating at his restaurant so much that they keep coming back for more.  Either way -- very cool.   But what about the food, you ask?  I'd have to give it a thumbs up.  My gf and I had dinner at Erwin on a Friday night and everything was top notch.  For appetizers, she had the pear salad, which she said was very light and good.  I like my food with a bit more sustenance, so I opted for the crab cake, which was a bit underfried (the cake had trouble maintaining its shape) but still very tasty.  For her entree, my gf ordered the skatewing and I had the the braised lamb shank.  Her skatewing was nicely fried and came with a big assortment of veggies.  My lamb shank was very tender and was covered in a sauce that had the texture of gravy but did not taste like gravy -- a bit different but it worked.  They also have a sizable wine list with some decent options by the glass.  The service was top notch -- efficient but far from obstrusive.  It all added up to a very enjoyable meal. Erwin seems to appeal to an older crowd (read: mid 30's and up); my gf and I were probably the youngest patrons at the restaurant that night.  Nothing wrong with that -- more of an FYI in case you were wondering.  So if you're looking to have a ""nice"" meal in the Lakeview area, definitely give Erwin a try.",0.9835,0.85,0.128,0.022,0.5269354838709678
2007-04-18,4.0,"The bf and I just tried Erwin last night, a sort of spur of the moment outing, and it was a fantastic surprise.  We read about it in Time Out Chicago for having a great burger, but that was all we knew so we didn't know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that they had a special of half price bottles of wine and $5 martinis.  The bf went for the burger, it was outstanding as expected, and I was in the mood for something a little ""healthier"" so I tried the mushroom cakes.  Let's just put it this way: I didn't know mushrooms could taste like that!  I don't know really what they did to those mushrooms, but they were absolutely fantastic!   In addition, I have to mention something about the service, it was great.  The staff was knowledgeable and extremely attentive, our server made excellent recommendations and our water glasses were always filled.  All in all, a great experience!",0.994,0.745,0.255,0.0,0.6581101190476192

2007-04-09,4.0,"I'v enjoyed Erwin very much both times I've been there. Their food seems very fresh, and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Their food is somewhat high-end but can appeal to anyone; there's a burger on the menu for someone who won't eat anything fancy. I really like their wines as well.

2007-02-25,5.0,"This place was jam packed when we showed up with a group of 5 - probably due to some recent publicity regarding their burgers. We decided to stick it out despite being quoted an obscene wait time and were very happy we did. The wait wasn't bad at all, and the gentleman running the show was very kind to us, even though we had stragglers in our group and weren't very organized. The ambiance was relaxed yet warm, with whimsical paintings along the top of the room. Having the bar in the center of the room was a nice touch. The space is a bit small, however. The food was outstanding, with several of my companions remarking that it was, ""My new favorite burger in Chicago."" I went with blue cheese on mine and it overpowered the meat a bit but was still very tasty. The poppyseed bun was a nice touch, and was perfectly toasted. Also, I'm a sucker for red onion. If you really want to taste the meat, go with the cheddar cheese. The fries were above average. My one complaint is that my burger was overcooked a bit, although not enough to keep me from enjoying it.  The wine menu had affordable wines by the glass and they had a good selection of beer as well. Our vegetarian friend wasn't all that thrilled with the mushroom cakes but loved the garlicky mashed potatoes. For my money, I still prefer the burger at Rosebud (a dollar cheaper, too) but would happily mix it up once a while at Erwin and I'm sure the rest of my group would have the opposite opinion. The rest of the menu looked great and I'm excited to come back and try something else. I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm just going to order the burger again, anyway.",0.9934,0.761,0.192,0.047,0.5327054327054327

2006-12-03,3.0,"***UPDATED TO 3 1/2 STARS*** PREVIOUS: 5 stars CURRENT: 2 stars Reason for the update is the service. Or lack of service. Our last visit was horrible.  Our waitress was okay up until dessert where she forgot the spoons. Our sorbet was melting in front of us and ended up using somebody else's coffee spoons until we could flag down a busboy. Then, we never received our bill. Our waitress completely disappeared and after 30 minutes (no exaggeration), she still never stopped by. We asked another waiter if he could find our waitress so we may leave. She finally came around and just dropped the bill with the plastic plate on the table with a thump. We paid with a credit card so it took her a while to come back around and return the slip. On top of that, she was never apologetic about the wait.  I never had to think twice about going to Erwin's and now I will only go when I receive a coupon or somebody else is paying. ORIGNAL REVIEW: I don't know how this fabulous restaurant escaped my radar. Last weekend I finally went and had a wonderful meal that I will enjoy reliving for a long time. The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable. The menu is inventive but not intimidating. If I had a question regarding anything the waitress was --- gasp --- KIND and informative. Shocking...I know! There is no pretense, just fantastic food.  Oh, and not only do they have Pimm's stocked at the bar but they actually know how to make a proper Pimm's cup.",0.9666,0.849,0.115,0.035,0.6035555555555556
2006-11-28,4.0,"I moved to Chicago not long ago,  and was treated to brunch by one of my contacts and his wife.   The scene was laid back,  cozy with dim lighting.  The greeter was polite, the waitress was personable,  and the plate of food was hearty (the price is a little higher,  but the meal size makes up for it in most cases). I strongly recommend the  banana-cinnamon french toast with a side of applewood-smoked bacon,  and  the strawberry-rhubarb crisp for dessert.  Also, be sure to bring along someone to split the meal with.",0.8646,0.898,0.102,0.0,0.47171717171717165
