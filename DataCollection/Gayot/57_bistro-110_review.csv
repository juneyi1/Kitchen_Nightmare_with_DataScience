Mix those two together and you have one hell of a heartburn even before you start the meal. Bistro is located in a very touristy part of Chicago naturally that affects a lot of variables for the restaurant. I can not argue with the other reviewers however I can say the following: We had lunch here on a Friday, the dining room was quite nicely lit, welcoming, clean and not too crowded to our relief.  The wait staff were attentive. The food was well prepared, the lettuce in the side salad I had was the freshest field greens I have tasted in quite some time. While this is not the definitive French Experience, I thought the service, the quality of the food, the ambiance were all agreeable. I thought this was more of the French I like -- Provence and less of the France I dislike -- pretentious Paris stuff with expensive prices and food that piles up 12 inches high on plates like there's nowhere to go on the plate.

(Side note: maybe the fact that my girlfriend just watched the movie also had something to do with it). It was a half roasted duck with roasted peaches and pommes frites, the latter of which were crispy and savory.  The duck was good but just a bit dry.  We also ordered the Oven Roasted Sea Scallops. The scallops were pan friend golden brown with a side of rosemary polenta and peppercorn sauce.  My girlfriend loved it!  (Side note: when we went back a second time, it seemed like they cut back on the portion of scallops unfortunately.)  For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee, which was very good.  Overall, the portions were fairly generous, the food was above average, and the ambience was that of your typical traditional semi-classy restaurant.",0.9871,0.858,0.134,0.009,0.42268452380952387

The food here is delicious bistro fare, but the service always surpasses the quality of the food.  On Saturday, time restraints got me to the restaurant before the dinner menu (with my beloved cassoulet) kicked in.  I asked my waiter if it were available.  He graciously agreed to check (none of that ""if it ain't on the menu, we ain't got it"" crap).  While I sipped my Aviator (a cold mixture of gin, lemon, and cherry liquor), he disappeared into the kitchen and returned to tell me the chef had agreed to plate the cassoulet early for me.  I was so happy that we high-fived.

Complimentary roasted garlic, butter and baguette were pretty darn good, and we were offered more just as we were getting to last pieces of bread. Rack of lamb was utterly delicious, cooked on point (medium rare) and was a veritable treat. The vegetables really added to the meal instead of being a healthy afterthought. My only suggestion is to use larger couscous as the kind used was quite small and almost grainy. After soup, two helpings of bread and rack of lamb, we were stuffed, but couldn't stop ourselves from ordering the creme brulee with fresh berries.

The bartenders are nice and good at what they do.

See, I studied the menu beforehand, knew what I wanted, and then was so swayed by the server's description of Julia Child's Roasted Duck with Peaches, that I went with that instead.  It was weird, maybe that's just my palate, but the sweet and peppery didn't work for me.  I liked the crispy skin, but the meat was, well, too ducky for me.  I'm not sure I really like duck, so that's my fault.  I've had it twice, once in Beijing, and really really liked it, but I keep trying it other places and I don't like it so much. Anyhoo, problem number two is that the duck is served with pommes frites.  I knew from being a good yelper and reading the reviews that this would not be fries, but more of an inbetween of fries and potato stix,  So when the server suggested an appetizer of fries and onion curls, I assuimed that would be something different, because why would the server knowingly recommend the same appetizer I was about to get with the entree I already ordered?  Well, it was the same.  And frankly, it was like high end funions and potato stix I felt like I could have bought from Treasure Island in the chips aisle. My sister ordered the prix fixe combination option (my original intention), she chose:  French Onion Soup, Grilled Chicken Paillard, and Gateau Breton for dessert.  She shared her meal with me since I didn't really like mine and hers was much better.  The French Onion Soup was delicious, I loved the crusted cheese, although, I know other places (uhhm, Golden Steer) that do it up right as well.  The chicken was okay, although I didn't care for the type of perfumy apple it was plated with.  The Gateau Breton was divine.  Seriously, the caramel syrup and scoop of vanilla ice cream just added to the perfection of the shortbread-like cake.  So so good.  I would have bought a whole one to take home if it was an option. Yeah, the garlic was good too, but I wondered if that was only available for April as it was garlic month?  Frankly, the dry, cold baguette wasn't my favorite though.  Kind of wished the bread had been warmed first.

To make matters worse, my gf got the pork special, which should always be cooked medium or more and it was a nicely executed rare-medium-rare.  I took a single bite and felt like I got punched in the stomach the next morning.  They apologized a lot and sent some free shit (which is why they get 2 stars), but when it comes down to it, we ordered two meat dishes and both were extremely poorly executed so I must suggest you don't go there.  Good restaurants abound in Chicago.

They give pretty large portions so we had enough of both dishes to bring home. Our server was even nice enough to give us some extra creole sauce! That made my bf's day!

We started off with the artichoke with baked brie.  It was the first time I'd ever eaten an entire artichoke before so Rob had to school me in the ways of how it was done.  It was alright...too much work for too little reward in my opinion.  I also ordered the french onion soup, which was another first for me.  It was excellent.  I loved all the gooey, cheesy goodness and the fact that it wasn't as onion-y as I thought it would be (which is what has kept me from trying it before Bistro).  Rob got the shrimp gumbo.  I had a little taste and it was quite yummy as well.   We were already quite stuffed by the time our main dishes arrived but being the little piggies that we are, we forged ahead.  I got the Eggs Louisiana, which is basically eggs benedict with crab cakes.  Rob got the eggs benedict with pork loin (similar to canadian bacon).  I took the first bite of mine and holy crap I thought I'd just eaten a spoonful of salt.  I doused it with a bit of hollandaise sauce but that didn't really cut the sodium factor by much.  I had a bite of Rob's and thought it was quite good.  (Damn, I should've totally gotten that one!)

Walking in to a bright scenery, filled with smiling and friendly faces, well, heck. That just starts this place off just right. I was sat promptly while I waited for Sarah. Rob, the waiter, not me, greeted me a few minutes later and was certainly energetic and of course friendly. He was always around and when we needed him, never around when we didn't.

Yeah... sorry, I prefer the vampire protection over those choices. We planned our meal like usual, calling out dibs on plates and choosing what we wanted to split. The artichoke with baked brie was good, but was the entire artichoke, not just the heart, which was a little surprise. I think there was a bit too much acidity in the topping, but it can get a bit messy as you work those outside leaves. The shrimp gumbo was quite good, a nice little heat, flavorful and tasty. Sarah had the French onion soup, I didn't try it, (close your jaw, I know it is surprising, but sometimes I do skip on trying things. It happens.) By the time the main dishes came we were struggling.

I will say I was impressed with how well the eggs were poached, however the crab cakes had some serious salt in them which was a little too much for my sodium loving mouth. The pom frittes I would skip. I like mine to be shoe string and to have some actual potato on them, these were simply shaving of potato, super crispy but not much flavor.

Steak Frites: What a disappointment.  The steak was flavorless and I didn't particularly care for the sauce that it came with.  I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium. I also wasn't in the mood for fries after gorging myself on bread and herb butter.   Roasted Duck with Peaches: my friend got this and I was so jealous.  This is absolutely the dish to order. Absolutely delicious.   Desserts: the waiter brought out complimentary creme brulee, chocolate mousse and some sort of cake that I didn't try.  The creme brulee was great and not too sweet.  I didn't try the other two because I was stuffed.   Service: fantastic.  They totally catered to us and there was no rush to get us out the door.  I love long dining experiences, especially when celebrating! I would come back for the large round tables and the service.  Overall, however, the food was just average.  I have to imagine there are more authentic French places to eat in Chicago.",0.9957,0.709,0.214,0.076,0.5869616977225671
2010-03-08,2.0,"Tried this place for brunch via Groupon, inspired by how promising the menu sounded online.  But B110 seems to be having an identity crisis...it bills itself as French, with a New Orleanian flair, yet the decor and atmosphere is total white-bread touristy Michigan Ave. (which its location fits perfectly.) The servers were incredibly attentive (as they should be, given the high prices), but I was not impressed by the food at all, aside from the yummy, caramelized baked garlic bulb that came with the complimentary baguette.  (And I can make that at home!)   First of all, the Artichoke Baked with Brie was not at all what we expected--it was just a steamed artichoke in a really mustardy sauce, with some melted brie at the heart.  The half Frites/Onion Strings Side was sizable, almost too much...who can really eat an entire mountain of fried potatoes and onions?  And the frites were sliced so thinly that they were more like hash brown strips.  Even more disappointing that such a high-brow restaurant would serve them with a side of regular ketchup (no aioli?).   Entrees were large, but at $15-25/plate for brunch, shouldn't they be?  Still, I wish as much attention had been paid to seasoning/quality.  The ""New Orleans"" frittata was laughable--an unspiced, basic frittata with peppers, onions, mushrooms, and some bacon thrown in.  No flair, no interesting garnish, no sublety or anything marking it as remotely Cajun/Creole.   When I got my Chicken/Mushroom/Bacon Crepes, I mistook them for enchiladas, such was the look of this bubbling, gooey/cheesey mass in a cast-iron skillet.  I love cheese as much as anyone, but really?!  I've never had a French crepe that was literally SWIMMING in more cream sauce and swiss cheese than crepe.  It was also gross to take the first bite and get a hunk of all-fatty, gristly bacon...not tasty, not edible, and certainly not befitting an $18 ""Specialty"". We left full, for sure...but I'm not sure the food was even worth the Groupon discount.",0.8506,0.836,0.092,0.072,0.4387059052059052

When my coworker's French onion soup arrived, it looked so delicious! I mean it was so magnetic that I literally could not take my eyes off of it. To say that I was jealous of this French onion soup was an understatement - next time I go to Bistro 110, I will make it my top priority to order some of that delicious French onion soup!

My water glass never reached empty even though I was drinking it as fast as it arrived. When Le Hamburger arrived with steak fries, I bit into the Le Hamburger and found it to be Le delicious!

The garlic was really intense but when you mixed it with the butter it made the perfect spread for the bread. When we went there was a special Valentine's menu with a number of interesting options including lobster bisque. We decided to share it.

Bistro 110 is the definitive escape from the weather and shopping perils of the Mag Mile in winter. I confess, though, that I no longer go in the summer, when the space is just a little too uninviting to light and air and I feel as if I've escaped from something that I had no desire or intention of escaping from, and as a result I'm imprisoned by my own stupidity. B110's summer al fresco sidewalk attempt is, I suppose, a pragmatic gesture, but its just another way of suffering what you wish was a different circumstance.

We went for brunch and ordered from their prix fixe menu, which included 3 courses for $22.95...definitely not a bad deal!  We started off with a warm baguette that came with butter, raspberry preserves, and a garlic spread.  Never had the garlic in that form before....I liked it though, it was interesting.  I ordered the shrimp gumbo, which is out-of-this-world AMAZING!!!  Flavorful, just a hint of spicy, fat pieces of shrimp, white rice, bits of meat, vegetables...I fell in love.  I also ordered the Eggs Louisiana, which were crab cakes with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  I didn't enjoy it as much, probably because I was already stuffed!  But I think the crabcakes were a bit dry.  Lastly, dessert consisted of a slice of chocolate cake floating on a lake of caramel sauce accompanied by a huge dollop of whip cream and berries....delicious!

2010-01-29,4.0,"Thanks to Groupon I've been able to try a lot of places I have never considered going. Bistro 110 was one of these. While I am a huge food fan, I must admit I have never experienced true French cuisine before. I know, I should be ashamed - but c'est la vie. Ha. Anyway, the atmosphere at Bistro 110 is nice. It is a very large roomy restaurant, and you don't feel crammed in next to your fellow diners. There are lots of nooks and corners for a romantic evening, and big tables for a large get together. I started off with an Aperitif, which is a wine-like pre-dinner liquor. I've never had one before, and it is certainly an experience to try at least once. The waiter was very helpful in explaining them to me. They are pretty strong, but unique in flavor. Sadly, we couldn't order the appetizer we wanted - artichokes baked with brie as apparently a drought has killed or shrunk the artichokes. Heart break! At least we were given an explanation instead of being told ""We ain't got none."" I had the Cassoulet, which was pretty amazing. It is comprised of a leg of duck, lamb, sausage, bacon, and white beans, all served in a tiny cast iron casserole dish. Everything was cooked extremely well, especially the beans (and I am NOT a bean person). The flavors melded together perfectly - duck and lamb are an excellent pairing. My only complaint would be the weird powdery crust that was on the duck - it was too salty, so I just brushed it off to the side. My girlfriend had the Wood Roasted Salmon 110 . She really enjoyed the salmon, which was flaky and well seasoned. However, she said the vegetables were bland and she hardly ate them (she ended up finishing my dish). We also had a side of the Angel Hair Onions, which we were very excited about. Unfortunately, they were cut -too- thin and lacked any flavor (and were cold when we got them). Plus they were served with ketchup. Seriously? Ketchup? That's the most inventive thing you can serve with these? We topped off the meal with Creme Brulee. The creme part was delicious, but the crust topping was a little too thick which made it a touch too chewy. My dish was hands down the best part of the meal. The service was fantastic, the waiter very helpful in explaining and being attentive to our needs. Overall, the food was great, and I'd be willing to go back for a fix prixe menu or their monthly tastings.",0.9973,0.756,0.19,0.054,0.6104566972988025

It said nothing about having sausages and bacon in it, so I didn't expect those things to randomly appear in my dish. That was a bit strange... I was expecting just duck and lamb! Still, it was pretty good. I liked it. I mean, c'mon, what's there not to love when the dish combined two of my favorite meats? My friend ordered the lamb shank and offered me a piece to try. I thought it was dry... Yeah, I definitely liked mine more.  Our server was smiley and bubbly. I liked that. Except I wasn't pleased when she brought over my wine. It was first in a mini carafe bottle and then she just poured it all into my wine glass. There was nothing like a taste -- ""How do you like it?"" Nope, just straight into the wine glass.

Then, you move away and suddenly you're all over Bistro 110 like flaky pastry on escargot.  Overall, I have to say, I was not overly impressed. It's not great for the restaurant when the best part of the meal is the bread+roasted garlic combo (which, by the way, was outstanding). The escargot was pretty ""meh"" and my entree, the cassoulet was a little disappointing -- kind of like chili. My sister had the lamb which was comparatively delicious but not even all that outstanding.  I was also distressed because, when we got there, we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. I stared down two empty tables and eventually, in 10 minutes, we were led to one of them. It was all very odd.

I used to think this was THE place to go just because the service was impeccable. It's always crowded no matter what time you go, but the servers never rush you and give you the attention you deserve (for what you're paying). I'm not saying I'll never go back however - it's just that there are about 100 other place I'd prefer to go. The roasted garlic and olive oil that they start you out with it just about the best thing they offer. Their bread comes out warm and fresh also. If I did come to eat at Bistro 110 again, it'd be purely for their appetizers. Their mussels and french onion soup are very good. The endive and goat cheese salad is really too. For entrees I've had the scallops, steak frites, and duck leg. The scallop entree and steak have always been good - but not great.  The one thing that will get me to come back is the decadent slice of chocolate cake they give for birthdays and other celebrations (I went once and told our server that I got a new job and she came out with a slice of cake on the house!) Heavenly. It's three layers of moist chocolate cake with two layers or rich chocolate and an outer layer of chocolate with toffee candy sprinkled on the edge. YUM.

Bread is served with a whole head of roasted garlic - you can never go wrong with roasted garlic - sweet 'n spicy, and it gets rid of all your worms too! For the appetizers, had: - Artichoke Baked with Brie - The artichoke was a bit over-steamed to the point it was pretty water-logged, however the melted brie dijon mustard seed sauce was absolutely suburb.  This is a close second to my favorite grilled artichoke. - French Onion Soup ( yelp.com/biz_photos/SEEP… ) - baked in a cast iron crock with a gratin of Gruyere and provolone was a very tasty start.  The onion soup was a combination of white and green onions.  The cheeses were rich and exactly the right amount to satisfy any cheese-head. - Escargots en Croute - These slippery suckers were finally put to rest baked in a rich maitre d' butter sauce and topped with a flaky pastry puff. Entrees: - Bistro 110 Steak Frites - A New York strip top with a huge slab of shallot-parsley buddah.  This was tender and juicy - but a NY will always take second to a good rib-eye in flavor.  It was served with homemade thinly sliced pommes frites and a chili-style steak sauce on the side. - Duck Confit with roasted sweet peaches - This was quite moist and exceptionally cooked without the gaminess.

I made reservations on Open Table and told them it was our anniversary. The hostess and waitress both went out of their way to wish us well, ask how long we've been together, etc. It really made the dinner start out special for us.  They were not busy at all, so the hostess asked if we had a seating preference and we chose the windows. It was a bit of a tight squeeze with the tables to either side of us, but it was fun to people watch. We started with cosmos, which were made well, but not the absolute best I've ever had. Their cheese platter is decent, though a little smaller than I anticipated, and the brie was nothing special. The other two cheeses and preserves were great though.  The bread and garlic, as other yelpers have already pointed out, is phenomenal. I could eat that all day long.  Bottle of wine with dinner... the wine list is fairly wide-ranging price-wise, which is good cause we are definitely bottom of the price range diners.

I'm not sure I would have wanted to down that much garlic on a date, but stinky breath around the colleagues was worth it. The endive salad with goat cheese was also really good. The cheese is served breaded and comes warm on top of the cool, tangy endive. It's pretty much everything I want from a starter salad. I had the duck for entree and it was fine, but the roasted sweet potatoes that came with were actually the best part. I wasn't that thrilled with the entree, but dessert totally made up for it. Oh, the creme brulee! It was perfect. The shell was not overpowering or too thick etc, and the custard actually had a wonderful sweet vanilla flavor, rather than the non-descript taste of many creme brulees I've had.  All in all, I'd go back just for the bread, appetizers, and dessert!

Isn't this supposed to be a french restaurant? The presentation of the food reminded me nothing more than a generic American chain, I might as well have eaten at Apple Bee's. First of all, we went in at 12:30pm on a saturday and the place was not too crowded. There were open tables. Yet it took the server about 10 minutes after we sat down to pour water and ask us if we wanted anything else. He explained the menu, and off he went...for another 10 minutes. We had decided the menu, put it aside, and then he came and dropped off our bread basket with the roasted garlic and butter. That was probably the best part of our meal...no wait, dessert was kick ass too. They roast a whole garlic tat you can easily pop right out of its clove and spread it on your bread..mmm.  We ordered the prix fixe menu with three courses, a hot tea, a coffee, and the brie with artichoke. When the artichoke came, it was a little disappointing, like the dish was an afterthought and half eaten. The taste was pretty good though with the sauce and melted brie.  Our soups then came, we had a French onion soup and a lobster bisque. The french onion soup was decent, lathered in cheese and bread. The lobster bisque was WAYYY too salty. I love salty soup...but I couldn't even finish it and my head was already hurting from the salt. Seriously, even for a bisque it was toooooooo salty.  For the main course, I got their NY Strip BLT and my husband got the wood smoked salmon. Okay..where did FRIES fit into french cuisine? French fries? har har. Seriously though, my BLT with steak was falling apart, the lettuce and tomato was stale and mushy, and it just came with steak fries. Fries. I can't get over the fries part. It looked just like something I could have gotten at an American chain. My husband's piece of salmon was alright at best, nothing to write home about, and definitely nothing memorable. His salmon came with random mixed greens and fries.  The dessert was the saving grace. Their bread pudding and creme brulee were amazing. The brulee was mixed with vanilla bean and it tasted fresh. The bread pudding wasn't too sweet or anything, just the perfect bite. Service made this restaurant sink in another star because our waiter was not attentive at all. Even with many reminders that we would like refill on coffee, he failed to refill it for us for a good amount of time. It was slow and tedious and definitely not remarkable in any way. It would be a perfect little joint for a quick lunch but I don't know if it would be a place you PLAN to go as a french dining experience.

It's not your typical cozy little French bistro. It's bustling and loud, and I like it that way. The beauty of Bistro 110 in these tough economic times is that there's a great entree in every price range. I had the mussels (that come with fries!) for $10.95, while one of my dining companions had the cassoulet for $23. We were both quite satisfied. Our server, Angela, was warm and knowledgable. She steered us all toward great food recommendations and also a great wine recommendation too. And, you know, it's not a visit to a French restaurant unless you have creme brulee for dessert. Bistro 110's is the best I've had in a long time. If you're in that area and tired from shopping, I definitely recommend it. I still can't say it's a ""destination"" restaurant for me, or someplace I'd go for a special occasion, but you can't beat the location, the food or the bang for your buck.",0.9411,0.836,0.126,0.039,0.46397515527950306

We can get good food, booze, and I can still eat something that tastes like it was made for a human- that will not make some part of me swell up.  On more than one occasion, the chef himself has come out of the kitchen to clear ingredients with me. The waitstaff are trained to be especially sensitive to allergies. It is quite an issue for the Chef- you see, his children suffer from possibly life threatening food issues. He takes these concerns and transfers them to the good of his customers.

2008-11-30,4.0,"I've been eating at Bistro 110 for more years than I can remember. It's been one of my favorite places to have a leisurely late lunch on a Saturday afternoon, a raucous dinner with a group of friends, or a quick bite for lunch. The biggest plus has to be the location; right off of Michigan Ave. and near my favorite Oak St. boutiques..and Water Tower. It's a top choice when I have friends in from out of town and it never fails to please.  Can we please talk about the bread/butter/baked garlic, please?? Umm, hello, orgasm in a bread basket. The bread is perfect: warm, crunchy crust, soft center. The butter melts as soon as it hits the bread, and then the garlic...the garlic. Soft and fragrant- the perfect bread topping combo. I could eat the bread and nothing else and be a very happy woman. Really. If you want to win me over or get information out of me, ply me with their bread, butter, and garlic and I'm yours.  The Mussels Marinieres and Escargot en Croute are my favorite appetizers. I'm somewhat of an escargot connoisseur- I've been eating it for over 20 years, so I know what's what. It should be noted that en croute is usually my least favorite way to have it, but, Bistro 110 serves it perfectly; the en croute is placed on top. I always get the Endive and Goat Cheese Salad because it's the perfect combination of savory and tart. Favorite entree: Steak Frites, hands down. The steak is cooked to perfection and the maitre d'butter sauce is the perfect compliment. Their frites are the way I love them; thin and crispy.  Their wine list is extensive and I like that the prices cover all bases. My favorite drink, however, is their bellini martini. Actual white peach nectar and prosecco, love it! They're so good I've forgotten what number I'm on many times. It's not super expensive, the service is great, and the food delicious. All in all it makes for a great dining experience.",0.9982,0.722,0.25,0.028,0.6327286470143614

I can't say much about the steak or chicken dishes as I usually dined on various seafood. One memorable experience likely won a few repeat visits. I'd ordered an appetizer that never showed up, and instead of just comping it on the bill they surprised me with dessert and promised to make it right next time around. They did, and it's small attention to detail at little cost to them that wins customer business. That said, the food isn't exactly award-winning.

If you get the prix fixe and order a cocktail (e.g. bloody mary, bellini, etc), it's only $5 instead of the usual $7.50.  The bloody mary is a little watered down but still decent.  Oh and as many people have already mentioned, the fresh roasted garlic that they bring out with your bread is fantastic.  Our server suggested we spread the garlic, butter and jam together on our bread -- it sounds funky but it tastes amazing!

The French Country decor was too cutesy and not a fluid theme, some of the decor was french country, the other was just ugly. It just didnt work for me.

My drink was great (a super spicy Bloody Mary), the soup was really good (french onion, not to salty). My Voodoo Eggs Benedict lacked some imagination. They claimed to be a Creole or Cajun spiced entree - There was no kick to be found. The Hollandaise was so bland, not worth the calories.  But at dessert, my family and I ended up with the 3 options - the chocolate cake, creme brulee and the apple tart. Whatever you do, just get the chocolate cake - sooo good. And be prepared to share, cause that thing is huge!  But what made me giggle is the Jazz part of the jazz brunch. These 2 old men, with the average age of 82 sat on stools and played a few notes, warmed up, went to drink coffee and came back. When we asked when they start to play, our server when they start, she told us ""whever they feel like it"". And that's of course what happened.  All told, this place is good.

2007-02-13,4.0,"When it comes to food, I tend to go on quests. Some quests involve distance and timing (such as driving 35 miles to hit a particular Tastee Donut shop at precisely 4:00am) while others involve a specific cuisine or dish. In the case of French restaurants, I am on a quest for the perfect cassoulet; one that triggers my memory of the exquisite dish I had the pleasure of experiencing a number of times at La Table d'Aude in Paris. From what people tell me, La Table d'Aude is gone, but the memory of the cassoulet lives on. I must find it. I am on a quest. Bistro 110 is a French restaurant in the heart of tourist central in Chicago. Although it comes across as a tourist spot, it does have cassoulet on the menu. Could a tourist place approach cassoulet perfection? No, but it is an honorable mention. For those who don't know, my description of cassoulet is a hearty stew-like dish that features duck or goose, is bean-based, and slow-cooked. Cassoulet, in my opinion, is best when most of the liquid has been reduced to the minimum -- not dry, but with a bit of broth that takes it just beyond moist. The slow cooking makes everything so tender and the stew absorbs all of the flavors to create a delightfully complex meal that is perfect in winter. It is definitely French country cooking and not haute cuisine. The cassoulet at Bistro 110 is good -- not La Table d'Aude, mind you -- but still good. And like the cassoulet, the rest of the food I've tried has been equally good and distinctly French. Now I never go to Bistro 110 during tourist season or on a Friday or Saturday night, so the quality may differ during those periods. I go when it is slow -- the off-season, Sunday nights, and during winter weather. If you are looking for a place to dine, want something French, and don't want to go far off Michigan Avenue, then try Bistro 110. And if it is cold, try the duck cassoulet -- then imagine that taste several orders of magnitude better. Interested in going on a quest?",0.996,0.832,0.161,0.007,0.4595679012345679
