2012-08-23,1.0,"I went here this past week with two friends, one of whom is a tequila aficionado who'd been hoping to try this place for a while. I was excited by the promise of the place, but I strongly feel the service and food merit no more than one star. When ordering, I first requested the portobello mushroom empanada and inquired about vegetarian options or substitutions for entrees (none were listed, but I don't demerit them for that). I was met with a solid stare for about 20 seconds from the waitress as if I were from space before being told she couldn't think of anything. I suggested leaving the chicken off the fajitas, which she agreed would be a fine idea. When the appetizers arrived, I started eating what was supposed to have been my selection, while ignoring it being overcooked, began to wonder where the mushrooms were half way into the dish. As the server walked up, I unearthed an entire piece of shrimp: they'd given me the wrong dish, and  was horrified by what I'd been eating. The server, while apologetic, patronized me, calling it cute that I was ""so innocent"". As a vegetarian of 18 years, this was somewhat offensive but I rolled with it, not wanting to ruin the evening for anybody. The worst part was the ""solution"" to their mistake:  my half-eaten shrimp empanada was swapped for my friend's half-eaten, mis-delivered mushroom empanada, which I was then given to eat. Any half-decent restauranteur would have made a new plate right away for both of the incorrectly served dishes. A simply decent one would have probably made at least one complimentary after the sin of serving the wrong meat dish to a traumatized vegetarian. Neither of these things happened. The entree later arrived, which was bland and not worth finishing: a mass of what looked like exclusively two entire red bell peppers tossed in a tomato sauce with some tortillas on the side. Onions, mushrooms, garlic? Lifting a finger in the kitchen to substitute anything for the chicken else would have been welcome. Our party had to ask for tableware routinely throughout the night, as some place settings were originally missing, and they kept being bussed between courses without being renewed. If anything helped me get through ordeal, it was the margaritas, which were decent. I was enthusiastic when I saw the menu cite they'd worked with Tommy's of San Francisco (legendary margaritas in the Bay Area) on the Salud recipe, but I just didn't see any of their renowned qualities shine through. Salud margaritas were at least above average. I wouldn't come back here even if the menu were more expansive. My meat-eating, tequila-loving dining partners were similarly unimpressed, leaving me confident with this rating.",-0.0776,0.801,0.103,0.096,0.5427261335156072

The tequila here is awesome, so naturally, their drink selection is amazing and well put-together. Drinks are no less than $8, but I think they are worth it. The mango mojito was sublime (we're talking real good mix of mango and mint flavor here) and my friend's El Diablo was well made as well.  So, the drinks are great, but the atmosphere is really odd.  The decor is very dark and ""Pan's Labyrinth""-y, and the DJ on a Friday night was just straight up playing top 40s jam after jam. The service... OHMYGOODNESS the service... it was extremely slow and painful! I don't know what the deal was, because it wasn't at capacity.

2012-06-05,2.0,"I would skip this place in the future. First off, even though the place wasn't busy, service was SLOW. It took someone about 15 minutes to ask for our appetizer/drink order, and no one approached us to order our dinner until long after the appetizer was gone. I think we sat for a good hour until we were brought our dinner. The food itself wasn't that great either. We ordered the guacamole platter, that supposedly had 3 types of guacamole. Ummm, it had basically 2 of the same kinds, and one that was a little different. The only difference between two of them was one was considered ""original"" meaning it had tomato/red onion in it and the other was that same base with pineapple on top. i wouldn't exactly call that a different kind of guacamole. As for the dinner itself, my ""medium-well"" burger was a tough, charred, way over cooked piece of meat. The toppings weren't revolutionary either, just cheese, guacamole, and some pico. It had no kick, so I doused it with hot sauce. My husband ordered steak with shoestring plantain fries. It looked good, until he found a nail in between the pieces of plantain. He wasn't particularly bothered by it, but I probably would have stopped eating at that point. I ordered a pomegranate margarita and was disappointed. It tasted strong, but I think that was just because the actual pomegranate taste was minimal. Husband said his cucumber drink was good. Finally, I was just a little upset at the way the nail thing was handles when we brought it up. We told one of the servers that we had found it in the food. We didn't make a huge deal about it, and the waiter apologized, but that was it. No offer to take the steak off the bill, no offer for a gift certificate in the future, nothing. Granted, we didn't ask for it, but that could have caused a cracked tooth or other serious injury. There was no offer to make up for what in my book is the most egregious error a restaurant can make, which is finding something in your food.

2011-12-08,2.0,"I like Salud.  I think the food is a pit overpriced for what you get, but it's good.  Reason for my two star rating?  Groupon Party last night for our annual girl's holiday dinner. Groupon details - $500 for a three-hour party in a semi-private space for up to 30 people with open bar and variety of appetizers. We had 15 girls.   Open Bar - We had a list of drinks to choose from.  So much for ""Open Bar""  But, in their defense, the list was pretty solid.  Lots of margaritas and they did give us pitchers of Sangria. Variety of Appetizers - As my one friend put it we got Hard Nachos, Medium Nachos, and Soft Nachos.  15 hungry girls at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday were given cheese quesdillas, chips with salsa and guac, and Salud's individual nachos. We got flour and cheese. Service - We had two waitresses.  We talked about tipping them at the end of the night and once I let them know that's what we were going to do, I expected the service to be a little better.  One waitress was great...the other one, not so much.  Then, the kicker comes...When we asked for more food, we were told that there wasn't anymore and we couldn't get anymore.  This was an hour into our party. If you read above the party was for THREE HOURS with a variety of appetizers.  They could have at least given us some tacos.  Then I told the waitress we never received any guac - she told me, ""And?  I don't know that. The kitchen said it came out so...."" and then proceeded to look at me.  WHAT???  I think I'd know if I ate some damn guac with my crazy flour and cheese.   We had to flag them down more times than I could count to get service... I understand that they're probably Ticked off that we got the groupon deal, but if you don't like, don't sign up for it!  After that run in about the guac with the waitress her tip dwindled from $100 to $55.  I'm a generous tipper, but to challenge me about what I ate and then walk around like you wish you were somewhere else, well, drew the line for me.   They need better waitstaff and a better ""party"" menu.

2011-11-17,1.0,"I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE, EVER.  And you shouldn't either.   We have been here a few times, food is  just a solid o.k. and definitely pricey for the quality and presentation.  We typically go just for a few of their specials, which makes some of their overpriced items more reasonable.  Without those offerings the place is pretty forgettable considering the other options in the area and the attitude of their employees. Which brings me to our most recent experience here and the basis as to why I would never go back.   I think it is universally understood that you participate in marketing/advertising/promotional offers to encourage new business and existing customers to frequent your establishment.  That fact seems to be lost on Joseph, a manager at Salud.  Not only that but if, as a business, you are going to have such a specific and rigid interpretation of your promotional offer it is probably best not to belittle your customers when trying to explain your policy. We were there with two friends on a Wednesday night.  Prior to our friends arriving we had a conversation with our waitress about how the last time we were in we didn't actually order enough food to utilize the  restaurant.com  coupon that we had and we planned on using it tonight.  The waitress saw the coupon, I reference that as it will become important later.  After seeing the coupon the server then goes on to let us know what the daily drink and food specials are, never mentioning that if you order any of those items and try to use  restaurant.com  offer that all items will be charged at full price, not the special price.  Even the drink specials become full price although  the coupon clearly states 'Valid for food only', may not be applied toward drinks.  Had she mentioned that initially, hadn't tried to play dumb later when she brought the check when strangely she had no issue articulately communicating their policy we would most definitely continue to be customers at this place. We ordered several of their signature margaritas, one appetizer that was on special on Wednesdays and each person ordered a full entrée.  We purposely ordered enough regularly priced food this time to ensure that there would be no issues when we tried to redeem the  restaurant.com  gift certificate.  This is when things went sideways.  When our waitress brought the check she suddenly remembered to mention that if we planned on using the gift certificate, which we discussed with her prior to ordering anything and she never mentioned any restrictions, that all items we ordered including drinks would be charged at regular price.  Essentially making the gift certificate pointless.  Had we known that at the beginning of the meal we all would have ordering differently without question.   We asked to speak with a manager and that is when Joseph strutted up to our table.  His attitude and body language was confrontational and annoyed before we could even get a word out.  We weren't rude, didn't raise our voices and asked straight forward questions regarding their policy so his demeanor was completely uncalled for.  Joseph let us know that it's not the waitress responsibility to explain their policies to customers, which I find odd, because she had no problem clearly explaining at the end of the meal after there was nothing we could to do to alter our order.  He also mentioned that he was already doing us a favor by giving us our drinks and one appetizer at their daily special price, I don't see how that's a favor.  The gift certificate states that you receive a $25 credit if you order $35 or more of food and can't be combined with specials.  We ordered $48 of regularly priced food and there was an appetizer that was discounted $3(?) because it was a daily special.  We clearly ordered enough regularly priced food for the certificate to apply and have never had an issue redeeming them the few times we have used one in the past.  Apparently Joseph felt we should have intuitively known that they have an extremely obscure and rigid policy at Salud and beyond the guidelines in fine print on the certificate they have additional criteria.  He would have been fired at any of the restaurants I've ever worked at for treating customers the way he treated us.  There is no need to be a douche when customers are asking legitimate questions.  Every single person at the table has worked in the service industry and was appalled by his behavior.  No one was looking to get anything for free or try and 'game the system' as other have mentioned in their review. Terrible end to a mediocre meal.  If you are going to offer to accept gift certificates, accept gift certificates.  Salud's participation in this promotional offer had the complete opposite effect of what they were looking to do because their manager has no business working if the service industry if he has that much distain for people.  Because of his attitude Salud has lost 4 customers forever.  Way to go.",0.9755,0.809,0.106,0.084,0.3823646881573711

We started our night sitting at one of the couches with a low coffee table next to it (which would be great for a group who wants to have drinks), but we were there for dinner so we asked to move.  When we asked our waitress, she said it was fine to move, but did not help us move our drinks, menus or anything to the next table.  When she saw that my hands were full, she did grab my water.   Next, we placed our order and got the Salud Nachos (my favorite!).  When I first started going to Salud, they only had one type, so when she asked me with an attitude ""Well what kind of nachos?""  I was taken aback.  I told her we just wanted the plain black bean ones.  When they arrived they were full of portobello mushrooms.  When I asked our server about them, she looked at the mushrooms all over my plate and did not acknowledge that they were even mushrooms.  She looked at me like I was crazy.  She then proceeded to take my knife and touch my food and say ""there are the black beans.""  Please do not touch my food!  She went to the computer and came back and said that she put them in as plain nachos, but she did not offer to make it right by giving us the plain ones.  I was not happy. Then our main food came and I ordered the shrimp tacos that were not described as being spicy.  They made my mouth burn so much that I could only eat half of one.  Even my boyfriend was unable to handle the spiciness.  I've been to restaurants where food is spicy and the server usually mentions when I order it to let me know.  This was not mentioned at all.  My boyfriend had the steak tacos which were very good.  When our bill came, there was $2 charged for the mushrooms on the nachos.  Obviously, she had put it in wrong in the first place, but did not want to mention that to us.  Luckily, we used a YouSwoop for this meal, so we did not have to pay much.  The drinks there are great, but slightly overpriced.  I would maybe go back and try it again because it could have been a fluke and maybe the server was new.  However, I would not recommend anyone getting the shrimp tacos unless you like having your mouth feel like it is on fire.   Salud, you disappointed me this time.",-0.7662,0.859,0.063,0.078,0.45700806768988583

2011-09-19,1.0,"The place does have a nice ambience and nice decor.  That's about all it has going for it.  The food was horribly over-priced!! For $9, I got only 2 tacos, and the tacos weren't anything special, you can get these same tacos at El Famous.  Even with the basket of chips and salsa (which we had to flag the waitress down to get more when it was empty), and a little bit of my friend's weird-too-salty-and-mushy plaintains, I was still starving after dinner was over.  For $5 more, you get twice the amount of tacos at Mercadito in River North, not to mention they're far tastier.   We were there at 7 pm on Saturday; usually at a time when you'd think you'd have a long wait to get  table.  This place was totally dead, and once we got our over-priced food, we realized why.  There was another table there besides us, but there were far more people working in the restaurant than there were people dining.  Probably about 5 people behind the bar, and 4-5 waitresses/busboys that would hang out around the kitchen chatting for long periods of time, some were even reading at some point.  With all that staff you think we'd get very attentive service, but we had to keep flagging down our waitress for things, or asking the bus boy to get a refill of coke.  Lastly, we ordered shots of tequila at the end of the meal, seeing as this is a tequila lounge, may as well try their specialty.  The waitress suggested a tequila called Karma, because it was smooth.  This tequila was so smooth, we're pretty sure it was totally watered-down.  We could actually see the ice on top of the shot which made us wonder how much water was in there, seeing as there was no burn at all.  Yet another over-priced thing on the menu, I guess that's their way of saving money to employ the unnecessary 15 staff members when the place is empty.  Overall, don't waste your money here.  For a little bit more, you can get far more bang for your buck at Mercadito's with gorgeous decor, amazing tacos, creative guacamole, and great cocktails.  Or even keep it cheaper at Barrio Urban Taqueria, all their food is great.  I can't imagine how much longer Salud will stay in business.",0.9902,0.86,0.11,0.03,0.5832556935817805

We sat on the outdoor patio, which is perfect for people-watching, especially considering all the freakshows that are wandering around that area (especially during rush hour). Anyway, the food menu is quite small. I stuck with the arrachera (skirt steak), which came with a huge portion of cheese-covered fried plantains. The food was good, although I wasn't really wowed by it. We also had the guacamole appetizer. I thought the chips were quite good, but in my opinion the guac itself was heavily lacking in both the flavor and spice departments. We even got the spicy version, yet we tasted no spice whatsoever. Maybe they messed the order up? Drink wise, the beer menu is small, but since the place is a TEQUILA joint, I guess that's allowed. The tequila list is pretty good, but I thought it was a bit overpriced, so I didn't order any margaritas or tequila pours. My fiancee and I did split a small pitcher of sangria, however ($12). Once again, Salud didn't do a terrible job, but I wasn't wowed. It definitely wasn't among my favorite sangrias. My fiancee said she felt buzzed after her two glasses, so I guess that counts for something, right?

The server told us right off the bat that they were short handed so service would be slow. I really appreciate that because it gives the option to go elsewhere if you are impatient or in a rush. We weren't so we took advantage of the specials. The drink of the week or month was a strawberry cucumber concoction so I got that and was pleased. They had some food specials ($5 burgers I think) that were amazing and when they forgot our appetizer order, the manager brought it out and made it on the house with no fuss. All in all, it was kinda quiet cause it was Memorial Day weekend, so not sure how the atmosphere would be when it's busy but I loved the laid back low key feel of our visit.",0.8193,0.839,0.104,0.058,0.5754960317460317

The food was good, but there are plenty of places to get good (or great) food in the city that will treat you far better.  The server was slow, but my friends and I would have let that slide-until we tried to pay.  They could have redeemed the otherwise completely forgettable evening, but instead they frustrated us to the point we decided we had to speak out and to ensure that not only do we not return, but that we dissuade others from wasting their time and money. We had a groupon to use, and had spent well above and beyond the amount required.  When we tried to pay, the server refused to allow us to redeem it, stating that we had gotten the daily special and so the groupon couldn't be used.  We had all read the fine print and that should not have been.  We offered to split the check, as even by separating off the special, we still had spent almost double what was required for the groupon, but again we were denied.  She asked if we wanted to speak to the manager-who proceeded to ignore what we were calmly trying to say and simply said that we were ""gaming the system"". After the awful treatment (clearly someone missed the day where they taught that the customer should be treated with respect, especially if they are being polite, reasonable and calm), we decided we weren't willing to ever come back to try to redeem it, and so gave it to the table next to us.  I never write on here, and dine out often-but this experience was so frustrating that I felt it was necessary.  Salud, you cannot arbitrarily change your rules and then make derogatory statements about your paying customers when they disagree...",0.8243,0.771,0.125,0.104,0.5494791666666667

Great presentation but we didn't finish it.  My next drink that evening was the Paloma. It was fantastic - I have a soft spot for cocktails with grapefruit soda and this one is my new favorite.

I had a the el diablo, which was just waaay too sweet for my liking, but other than the sweetness, it was alright.  Enjoyed a mojito after that, which was a bit better in my opinion (i asked our bartender to go easy on the simple syrup).   On mondays they have $5 burgers, chicken sandwiches and brats.  I decided to have the chicken sandwich...   oh my, it was good.  I know what you are thinking..  how can you screw up a chicken sandwich??  Well its tough.  but these guys know how to make it memorable.   Generous portions of guac and pico on a moist breast of chicken marinated in some type fo tequila derssing made for a perfect dinner.  I suggest you have either the fried yucca or the plantains for your side...  Both were much more satisfying than any french fried potato could have been.   I've been told they have great tacos here... fish (talapia), shrimp, pork, and a few more.  I think ill have em on my next visit.   There was an even going on in the dining area, so i didnt get a good look at it, but it looked like there was quite a bit of room back there.   All in all, i'm impressed.  Friendly conversation with a few other patrons, bartender was quick to address any and every need, weekday deals, yes, yes, yes.",0.9975,0.713,0.26,0.028,0.5956885456885457

The dessert was miserable.  Fruit empanada with ice cream and caramel sauce.  The empanada looked like an overcooked hostess fruit pie and tasted worse.  Very greasy and flavorless.  The ice cream was barely better- slightly better than Bryers.   The Cocktail was very good- tequila, chocolate, nutmeg, and chili pepper concoction- blended. very refreshing and satisfying.   The service was very friendly and efficient- no complaints there.   The pacing of the meal was off as well- too long between courses. I found myself wanting another drink between courses.   All in all, I would go back to Salud for Cocktails, but not for food.",0.9978,0.728,0.223,0.048,0.5544065034582277

It's not that I don't like this place.  When they have tables outside it is a pleasant place to grab a drink and some tasty appetizers.  However, the layout of the place is kind of weird as there is just a giant open floor with a few tables sprinkled around the edges.  Granted it is made more for drinking (as the food menu contains a very narrow list of options), but it comes so close to being an inviting atmosphere that it's almost frustrating it misses the mark.  They do have a back area, but every time I've gone they've had some sort of event that I'm not allowed in to (which is weird because I have a very inviting face.) The food is definitely good, but it is served in such small portions that the price doesn't match the product.  Although you can tell they are using higher quality ingredients, I wish they would have given me a little more somethin' somethin' for my money.  Additionally, they don't have lettuce? I will say that if you're in the mood for an authentic drink from south of the border, you'll appreciate their wide selection of tequilas (they are a tequila lounge after all) and traditional mixed drinks including margaritas, fresh mojitos and a drink I have come to absolutely love (yet there are only a handful of places I've been to that serves it) the caipirinha.

I stopped in here for drinks with a friend I hadn't seen in a long time, and with beer looking kind of expensive, I opted for something more home-made. I mean, you can get a Corona in any bar. I ordered a City of Gold, made with 5-year aged gold rum, and fresh ginger. I was a little suspicious since ginger is a flavor you can screw up pretty easily, but the bartenders (who were very helpful by the way) hit it just right so it had just a pop of flavor without being overpowering. I also ordered a Tequila Mockingbird, which had a cool lime taste, almost like a margarita. I'm not really a fan of the layout. It seems too big to just be a bar, but too small to be a restaurant. The lighting is VERY dark, and on a down night, it can feel very empty. The prices are a bit steep too. Those two drinks cost me nearly $20, which even for Chicago is pretty outrageous considering the drinks were not that strong. I had fun, but I'm not sure whether I'll be back or not. The staff is very helpful, but it's not worth the price for an evening of drinks when there are plenty of places serving cheaper drinks in Wicker Park and Bucktown.

The Salud Tequila Lounge just oozed with excitement.  While I did not get to sample their cuisine, the engaging atmosphere caused us to ponder a subsequent trip to the area to try the food.  Unfortunately, our time in the city was brief, so I will have to add a meal at Salud to my to-do list for another time.",0.9753,0.842,0.146,0.012,0.43119658119658116

I wish they had waited to bring out the torta, but by this point my expectations were low.  My boyfriend ran out of water and waited about 10 min for the waitress to come by again to fill it up.  When she came back to refill our waters, she ended up dropping the entire carafe of water on the table and in my lap!!! Half a carafe of ice. . . cold. . . water. . .   in my lap. Great.  We got up so they could clean up our table, as water was all over our food, the seat and the floor and the waitress kindly said she's get us another torta.  Really?!  Another torta is just what I wanted to go with my soaked pants.  No thank you.  After being shockingly unapologetic, the waitress said she'd see what she could do about the bill.  She came back over and said that she's personally pay for our drinks and food.  So we start to walk out and she says ""wait, you need to pay for the apps"".  What?!  So we really have to pay for our guac that has a cup of water on top of it?  When we ask to speak with the manager, the waitress points to the back of the restaurant and says ""that's him in the white shirt"".  We look at her and after a moment of silence, she says ""oh, did you want me to get him?"".  The manager comes over and said that he thought they were being very generous, but that he guesses it's fine if we didn't want to pay for the apps.  So ridiculous.  This place has TERRIBLE customer service and awful waitstaff.  I will never go back and will not recommend it to anyone.",0.9433,0.846,0.086,0.069,0.5104707792207792

2010-05-08,2.0,"There's something raucously naughty about the idea of a tequila lounge.  The whole idea suggests a Sergio Leone-like ambiance - grizzled bandito's narrowing their eyes and ordering drinks in gruff undertones - gussied up for the Lincoln Park set.  At the same time one can easily imagine noisy frat boys hunched over  johns, steering the porcelain bus, a Wrigleyville holler house with a Disney-like twist, all of it lubricated by an immoderate desire to ""get the worm"". That's why we were pleasantly surprised by Salud Tequila Lounge.  On a Thursday night in February it was blessedly restrained, comfortably cozy, more cool lounge than tequila bar, nary a frat boy or bandito in sight.  The warm gold and burnished copper décor was tastefully decorated in Spanish accents, the plush half circle booths with timber and parchment table tops were stylish yet rustic.   After all, Salud is just a lounge; there is little attention paid to the food.  Although the menu offers the usual fajitas, tacos and guac, nothing stands out, some items are marginally substandard, and there is even a bit of a fraud lingering there under the specialties list.   Quick, tell me what this is:  Macho Barracho, 8 oz. ground beef or chicken infused with tequila, topped with Chihauhua cheese, guacamole and pico de gallo.  By any another name, it's a cheeseburger - a Mexi-burger if you like.  And a fairly average one at that.  But why the smokescreen?  Could it be that Salud wants you to think the food here is more special than it is? The empanadas of chopped shrimp, cream cheese, scallions and hearts of palm were up to snuff, once you bit through the rather flavorless baked pastry.  Ditto the portabella, goat cheese and sautéed garlic.  The pastry added nothing.  But where Salud really fell down was with the fajitas, uninspired, nearly bland (if that's possible with fajitas).  The fajitas at your local Chili's put this effort to shame. On the other hand, Salud excels where its heart is.  The house specialty Cadillac Tequila is as smooth and compelling as the menu implies and that's just the beginning.  Salud offers more than 75 premium 100% aguave tequilas, many from small artisanal producers tucked away in the highlands of Jalisco.  For anyone looking to savor one of the world's most complex spirits, Salud will be your guide.   Brought to you by the people who gave you Evil Olive and Cans, it's no surprise that the focus is on drinks.  But at Salud there is a higher degree of refinement than you find at those other places.  Mindless frat boys pounding hard liquor are not the target demographic, although a few may wander in from time to time.  Instead, Salud reaches for a more sophisticated palate, at least when it comes to the booze. As for the food, a grizzled bandito would never be able to tell the difference.",0.9703,0.871,0.09,0.039,0.513811249137336

2010-04-24,2.0,"This review really only applies to this place on my experience for dinner.  It is actually a little better of a bar than a restaurant.  So if you come here, I'd come here after dinner and just get drinks... My sister got me a  restaurant.com  gift cert to this place for Christmas, so I decided to give this place a try (don't get me started on  restaurant.com , and if anyone reading this wants to get me a gift, please let it have nothing to do with  restaurant.com ) Anyway.  We went here on a Thursday night. We ordered two cocktails and two waters.  The cocktails arrived about 15-20 minutes later (the place was relatively empty with about 8 tables worth of diners/drinkers).  The water did not yet arrive. I noticed that on Thursdays, Salud has a $1, $2, and $3 menu, which sounded pretty decent - but of course the  restaurant.com  gift cert doesn't work for their specials.  We ordered the trio of guacamole, a ceviche appetizer, steak tacos, and some portabella enchilada.   The guac came relatively quickly, and it was pretty good.  I enjoyed the fruit guac more than I thought I would.   About 10 minutes after the guac delivery, the waitress came to tell us that they were out of ceviche.  I feel like she could have told us this earlier, but how could she? That was the first time she came to our table since we ordered 15 minutes prior.  We also told her (for the second time) that we would enjoy some water. A little bit later our mains were brought out - to another table.  It managed to get to us right after though.   The steak tacos were pretty bland and tasted cheap.  I got 2 with rice and beans for $9.  Most cheap Mexican restaurants are tastier in my opinion and much cheaper. My girlfriend's portabella enchilada also was not very tasty.  She had to stop eating it about halfway through because she was too thirsty and our server had not been back since she told us that the ceviche wasn't available.  I was starting to feel bad and almost got up to go behind the bar and pour her a glass of water myself.  Luckily our server came out with a pitcher of water.  She walked to another table, filled them up, turned back around, and started walking to the kitchen.  My girlfriend tried to get her attention but the server didnt turn around.  I literally had to yell across the restaurant at her just to get her to turn around.  She came by to refill our waters only to realize that we never got glasses. At this point I had already finished my sub-par tacos and the busboy had cleared my plate.  The server asked ""Has your food not come out yet?!"" She really paid no attention to us.  She did notice that we still had guac but no chips.  She asked if we would like some more chips, and we said yes.  She finally did something nice!  Well- not really.  We got charged an extra $2 for the chips, of which we only ate a handful to finish the guac. We did get a dessert (I know.  You may be asking what am I still doing here if I'm having this bad of an experience - well I tolerate things a lot better in person and try to make the best of any night - with the exception of having to yell ""Excuse me!"" to get the waitress' attention)  The dessert was actually pretty good.  It was a brownie sundae and was very delicious.   The music they played throughout was really good (chill ambient type music mixed with some good indie music.  It gets more clubby as the night goes on) Our bill, after the $25 discount from the  restaurant.com  check was around $52.

Can't comment on the 5 pages of tequila, but my pomegranate mojito (which ironically doesn't contain any tequila, oops!) was pretty good and decently strong.

2010-04-04,2.0,"Appropriately, this place has a much more extensive selection of tequila than food. They make an effort to offer better food than you might expect at a lounge -- unfortunately, that's not saying much. We dropped by because we were hungry, but should have left after flipping through 5 pages of alcohol to find a short list of appetizers and entrees at the back of the menu. We stayed to give the place an honest shot, and because my friend had fond memories of their empanadas from a previous Yelp! event. For our first course, we had the chunky guacamole and the portabella with goat cheese empanada, and filled up on carne asada tacos and BBQ pollitos for our main course. The appetizers weren't incredibly memorable. You could choose between original, fruit, or chunky guacamole -- ours was chunky as advertised, but didn't have the zing you might expect from a fresh-made guacamole. The empanada was relatively large as far as empanadas go. One was enough for the two of us, as it was a bit heavy on the goat cheese. If it were up to me, I probably would have gone with the skirt steak or chorizo empanada for more of a kick. The carne asada tacos (2) were good, but for $9 you can get better for less at Chipotle. The barbeque pollitos were essentially fried chicken sliders (2) with barbeque sauce, guacamole, and bacon. An interesting combination of ingredients, but the inclusion of both guacamole and barbeque sauce didn't do much for me in the mouth-feel department. The waffle-cut fries could have been a little crisper too. Aside from the tacky glowing faux-marble and driftwood bar tables, the ambiance was a pleasing softly-lit lounge with an upscale Mexican adobe-style interior. The waitress was par for the course until the end of our experience, when we waited ten minutes for her to return to pick up my credit card after dropping off the check. We can't fault her too much -- seeing as the place was so empty, she probably couldn't resist feeling comfortable chatting up the bartender in the back and losing track of time. So in summary, one star for an extensive tequila list and another for a pleasing lounge environment.

2010-03-29,2.0,"While I don't live in the neighborhood, I've made a point to visit Salud on a number of occasions. My cousin's birthday party was the first experience, and my overall impression then was that it was expensive and the crowd was obnoxious.  I returned a couple months later on a Wednesday night not realizing they offered 1/2 price appetizers. My friend and I took well advantage of the offer and loved it. The food was delicious. Fast forward about a year and a half, and I came back on Friday night for dinner with a friend that was well overdue. I decided to purchase a  restaurant.com  gift certificate which I was pleased would still be valid on a Friday night - awesome. I'm not cheap by any means, but I do appreciate saving a little when I can. Anyway, my experience this time around was subpar.  We walked in a little after 7pm on a Friday night, prime dinner time, and there was an extremely loud group of people standing by the bar, causing attention. The host asked us if we were planning to stay passed 9pm...a little odd, but he said they had a private party coming in at 9 and wanted to seat us in the back room to avoid this obnoxious group. We reluctantly decided to sit in the front with the noise and were placed in one of the front booths by the window. My friend sat towards the middle of the wall where a space heater was keeping her toasty. A few inches away, I was freezing cold.  We ordered 1 pitcher of sangria (which I was hoping would help the warmth factor), 2 appetizers to share, our main dishes, and split a dessert. Our appetizers took a long time to eat, particularly the sopes dish - a corn cake topped with a salad-like mound. The corn cake was very hard to cut through and messy. The taste was forgettable as all I can remember was how hard it was to cut. Even though there were only 2 of us, our table was too small for the size of their plates, and before we even started the sopes appetizer, our meals came. We felt a bit flustered and moved the last 2 pieces of our other appetizer to our new plates while we still wanted to finish the sopes. At least 10-15 minutes pass and we're still working through the app, and I felt like our dishes were getting cold. I called over our server to take the main course dishes back into the kitchen to put them under some heat. She did, but without apology, which sort of rubbed me the wrong way. Eventually our dishes came back and we were ready for round 2. I had ordered the tilapia taco dish, which I have had once before. This time around it seemed different, and it wasn't nearly as good. The fish, sauteed onions and peppers seemed plopped on the tortillas, and there was really nothing special about them. My friend had ordered a similar taco dish with pork. She didn't seem too thrilled either. Perhaps ""Lounge"" in the name of this place is a giveaway. If you're looking for a loud and yuppie bar with good Tequila, you've come to the right place.

A friend and I split an order of the guacamole and the chicken fajitas. We got the guacamole chunky style which I would not recomend, it was too chuncky, but delicious none the less. The fajitas were also very good, they split them for us with out being asked which was nice and I still couldn't finish all my food. They came with rice with fresh cilantro and black beans.

Here's another place associated with Three Headed Productions, the successful restaurateurs, club whatever of Chicago.  Inside, you get a nice dash of decor, a large bar area, outdoor seating and back dance room, open for reserving.  The booths can be tight inside for larger groups, and the outdoor can seat 6 comfortably.  I agree with some of the ""eh..."" reviews on this note, not the best place for many.  Get here on a double-triple date, drink yourself funny and have a good time.  The more people, the more annoyed at the discomfort you may get. Focusing mostly on their tequila, most of the variations of margaritas were good and fun.  Nicely mixed and filled with some uniqueness, the Cadillac and Pomegranates are always a treat.  The appetizer deal is quite addictive, as who can turn down $1-$3 plates?  When do you stop with prices like that?  The rest of the food is tasty as well, priced a little high but at least the flavor is there.  I suggest the tequila burger, mixing two of my favorite vices.  Yes, Salud may not be best for fiestas largo, but that doesn't make this a bad place.  It's a really fun place for a smaller, intimate group to drink intimate enticing drinks.  Their dance floor is a plus and in the warmer of times, the outdoor area is great for relaxing with a refreshing drink.",0.9887,0.75,0.194,0.056,0.5895308641975309

On this particular Thursday, the whole back room was being used for a Tequila Dinner (sounds interesting, if you are into that, check out their website) so there were only 6 or 8 tables up front. The door staff wasn't accommodating and made us wait much longer than necessary, since tables did become available during the time we were there.  Power trip and it killed our mood waiting an hour to sit though the bartender while we stood at the bar was very sweet.  My tip from my experience:  If they have a Tequila Dinner which I heard they do the last Wed. and Thurs. of every month, don't go for drinks and food at that time!  I think if I would have went on a different night I may have been more pleased.",0.9733,0.859,0.117,0.024,0.43885204081632656

I gave it 2 stars because I ordered the nachos and 30 min later after we got all the rest of our food, they still didn't come. The waitress said sorry and reordered them for me. 10 Minutes later she comes by and asked if I received them. I said no and she said "" oh it should be any moment, they orders are put in weird"" 5 min later she comes back and is like are you sure you didn't get the nachos. Seriously? Besides the fact she thought I ate the nachos and proceeded to tell her I didn't; she also charged my friend $2 for chips to finish her salsa. By the way, Chips and salsa were $1. So she could of just told her to get another chips and salsa. She was just a horrible waitress, I wish i remembered her name. She kinda ruined our experience since the service was just horrible.

We were soon joined by a friend who ordered a strawberry margarita, as they were on special that night.  My sister ordered one too, and I switched to beer as I don't drink tequila if at all possible :)  We thought nothing of this, until we were joined by two other friends who were asking about the drink specials.  I pointed to the two margaritas on the table, and said, ""This is the special.  You should get it...it's only $4.""  To this the waitress replies, ""That's not the $4 margarita...that's the 'infused' margarita.""  wtf??  Why on god's green earth would they order a strawberry margarita if it weren't on special?  It turns out the blended version, which was half the size, was the $4 option.  You could tell that the waitress knew she had mislead us, but she still did not comp us the price of the drinks, which were.....NINE DOLLARS.  holy crap.   Overall, the service was so-so, the drinks overpriced, and the food tiny.  Unfortunately, we will be back to use the Groupon (which was sitting on the kitchen counter...curses!) but won't spend a dime more than the minimum amount to receive our discount.  We live in Wicker and love to patronize the restaurants on Milwaukee, but Salud will definitely not become part of our rotation.",0.9963,0.791,0.175,0.034,0.6081724581724582

Last night, however, my roommates and some friends headed over for a birthday dinner and we had a great time: - The drinks were great! Try the strawberry infused margarita! The tequila soaks in strawberries for a week before being used in the drink. - The food was simple but delicious. We had shrimp fajitas, chicken quesadillas, and fish tacos being passed around the table and they were all well prepared. - They had a wide variety of tequila options. After all, it is a tequila lounge, duh. We had a couple of their blanco flights, some margaritas, and other random shots here and there. If you're a tequila lover, this is a great place to go to try something other than the standard Cuervo or Patron. - The service was excellent.

In between these cocktails we did a few shots of Don Julio as well, which made the night interesting to say the least. Also, their food was very good.  We split up the carne asada tacos and chicken quesadillas.

It was half price appetizer night, so we took full advantage of that and ordered just about everything on the menu. The Guacamole Platter was really good and came with plenty of crispy chips. You get 3 choices of Guac and all of which are yummy. We also tried the Ropa Vieja Con Arrepa, which is basically shredded pork served on a corn cake with sour cream and more guacamole. Very good!

Our 4 appetizers in order of preference (these were huge any two is easily a large meal, save the empinada): Mussels in white wine sauce (a large portion maybe 20 pieces) Ceviche (A large blend of sea foods, calamari, fish, shrimp, and chips) Quesadillas (I combined black beans and steaks, excellent flavor but too easy to do at home to put above Ceviche) Empinada (The empinada had an awesome sauce and the pastry was perfect, the mix of cherizo, chihuahua and whatever the third ingredient didn't do it for us). Grand total for the night was $28.00 before the tip.",0.9952,0.782,0.198,0.02,0.5483543417366947
2006-12-13,4.0,"Ever since I passed the age of 22, I can't stomach tequila (except in the form of frozen margaritas), so I wasn't all that excited when my friends took me to Salud one night. But I've been back voluntarily many times since for their unbelievable mango and pomegranate mojitos. It's hard to tell if there's going to be a crowd there - sometimes I've gotten there and the place has been almost empty, while other times it's completely packed. Either way, the drinks are great and the music is decent, too. Great outdoor seating during the spring and summer as well!",0.9109,0.812,0.143,0.046,0.5666666666666667

But I went to try an appetizer on a boring Sunday.  I had a buy-one-get-one so my gf hooked me up.  I had a chicken dish (marsala?) that was pretty damn tasty.  But pricey.  The drinks were expensive and nothing to write home about.  The food was good but the atmosphere was too clubby for me.  The music was OK, it was like ambient stuff, which seemed more progressive than what I expected. The staff was what you'd expect from the kind of people that come to mind when you say ""tequila lounge"".  But I guess they were nice enough. Bottom line, don't go here to drink, it will suck.  If somehow you can get something for free or discounted from a promo, go on a not busy night and don't plan on drinking (much to expensive).",0.9306,0.816,0.133,0.05,0.6718750000000001

My dining partner had a chicken dish, can't remember what exactly. It was pretty tasty as well. We were in there early-ish on a Sunday evening. It was real chill and I enjoyed the emptiness, the low light and the music. I did not enjoy the astronomical drink prices. I am not a fancy girl and don't drink fancy drinks. But the Original Margarita (well tequila and small) and a bloody mary were 10 bucks each. I'll stick to $5.50 Silver Cloud bloodies thank you very much.

2006-08-13,4.0,"I can't resist a place with a great selection of tequila and some tasty food to boot - though there won't be a huge selection of food for you if you're not into seafood since a lot of the best choices on the menu are fresh fish (the tilapia was excellent) or have fish on them (I love the nachos loco or whatever they were called - I can't remember since I haven't been in a while - they had scallops and other assorted seafood on them). Aesthetically pleasing, a bit on the dark side if you're not into that (fortunately, I am), a tad pricy but nothing horribly extravagant (if you don't want it to be - the tequila can get pretty high on the price range, but that's a matter of getting what you pay for) and it can get loud on the weekends (I prefer afternoons there or early evening before it gets too crowded) but it's not a bad place to show up on occasion.

2006-08-07,4.0,"Salud is definitely a Tequila bar.  Many different kinds, some very expensive.  It definitely helps move Tequila out of the ""drink of the devil"" stereotype.-  I made my first visit this past Saturday night, and despite two large bachelorette parties, complete with lap-dances from willing male patrons (myself NOT included), I had a great time.  Salud pulls off the difficult task of being posh without being pretentious.  I think it has to do with the staff.  They are very friendly and extremely accommodating.  The layout of the place is great too.  Big open bar area in front, patio, and a nice looking lounge in back.  We were stationed in a booth at the front. It was a great time.  Looking forward to heading back for the food and maybe some more tequila. Hope to see you there.  EDIT: ""Salud"" is my favorite phrase with which to toast someone.  It is the best phrase and if you disagree, you're wrong.  Sorry to be so polarizing, but I must take a stand here.",0.9244,0.803,0.144,0.053,0.5775680272108844

Although it was still early and not very crowded, our waitress was really cool and kept bringing over free pomegranate mojitos and margaritas for us (a rep for the alcohol was in the bar, so I guess we lucked out!) The food was nothing special, but decent- we ordered some of the appetizers like nachos, quesadillas and crabcakes- but was still tasty. The music was little too relaxed and monotone for my taste- I felt they needed some upbeat music, because we were all kind of falling asleep after a while- but maybe that was the drinks!
