I once ordered that French style pizza with onions and bacon, you know tarte flambee (btw it's better in France). When I asked the lady (I call her lady because she isn't a waitress) if they could put the onions on half she basically told me no way (you all know the story, they don't do anything for anyone). I told her then that she could watch me pick the onions off one by one when the pizza came. I stared her down and picked them off as previously stated, plopping them down onto the pizza tray. She couldn't have cared less but I enjoyed it. Go somewhere else (oh wait you have to it's closing and if they open a new place still go somewhere else).

2013-01-28,2.0,"I felt torn with this review.  I need to start off by saying that the pizza was out of the world incredible!  I have never tasted pizza quite so good.  It almost overshadowed the horribly rude and impatient waitstaff, but not quite. They will not take a party over 4 people because they want to fit as many people in as possible, according to them.  When I told them that I wanted my father, who is 86 years old, to dine with me and my family, bringing our group number up to 5 people, one staff member very bluntly said, ""no, this is the way it is and it's not changing.""   Therefore, I have only eaten here once.  There was a wait of 1 hour just to get seated, and it's BYOB.  When we tried to alter the pizza by asking them to put on a little less onion on the onion pizza, the waitress gave an adamant ""NO, the chef does not change the pizza, ever.""  OK, I can appreciate a chef sticking to his/her guns, but the waitress just acted so irritated by us for asking.  When we got the pizza, I could hardly get over the incredible taste of it, so I can understand why the chef does not change the pizza for any reason.  It truly was perfect. When we gushed over how good the pizza was, the waitress seemed to irritated and indifferent.  It's like they all hate customers.   The restaurant itself was very, very small.  We had to share a table with a few people, and that was kind of fun.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the place.  Too bad the service was so bad and the entire waitstaff seemed ungrateful and resentful of anyone eating there.   Also, the pizza was incredibly expensive.  $30 for a pizza.  A little much for my taste.  It really was good, though.",0.4871,0.726,0.14,0.134,0.5839583333333332

That being said, do yourself a favor, drive (or walk) a few minutes north on Clark to Pizza Antica for an awesome thin crust pizza experience. You will not be disappointed!! Oh yea, and it is less expensive and the customer service is terrific. On a side note, I also heard Great Lakes takes advantage of the neighboring restaurant and sends all their customers over there to use the bathroom since they don't have one of their own?!!  Crazy, not only are they rude but they don't have a bathroom!  Hahaaa.... it is almost comical. Anyhow, I too read all the reviews about Great Lakes and was prepared for them to be a little aloof but they were more than that, the owners and staff were jerks.  Regular old jerks serving what, at the end of the day, is just pizza....not a life altering experience.  I have literally no idea how this place stays in business.   Skip Great Lakes and go to Pizza Antica if you are in the neighborhood.  You will NOT be disappointed.",0.9934,0.806,0.147,0.047,0.6490320278012587

2012-12-16,1.0,"Put a bird on it! My rating is solely based on my experience of ATTEMPTING to eat there.  Let me explain why... It's a mild Thursday evening at the end of November.  My party of three arrives at 7:20pm.  No one else is ahead of us, no one behind us.  The communal table is full, the two smaller tables have one person at each and the bench along the east wall is empty.  Girl at counter tells us to wait a moment while she tends to the other patrons.  After she takes care of a few people at the communal table (take note here that everyone now has food), she proceeds to straighten items on the shelves behind us for a good two minutes.  We are standing there with puzzled looks on our faces because the shelves and their contents -- which were not messy -- required her undivided attention.  The two owners, who are in the process of making pizzas, glance over at us with ennui-filled disdain.  The looks just seemed to say, ""Oh no, you are not worthy of eating our pies."" The girl finally goes back to the register and asks how she can help us.  We tell her we would like to dine in.  She told us that she could NOT guarantee, at 7:25pm, that we would be able to eat by closing time (9:30pm, according to the sign on the door).  She suggested that we go to a bar in the neighborhood and check back in a bit for a seat.  My friend asked if we could be put on a waiting list, to which the girl gave a blunt, stern ""No"".  Her final suggestion was to order to go and take it to Simon's.  While we were open to that suggestion (after all, we did bring our own liquor and we really wanted to see what the hype was all about), the hour wait for a takeout pizza was not at all appealing. Now I have a question for all you Yelpers that rave about this place:  If this place were plucked from its cozy little Andersonville location and relocated on the south side -- say Bridgeport or Pilsen -- would you still give a place like this such a high rating?  Let's even assume everything would be the exact same, from the tiny storefront to the hipster owners.  Would you even make a trek to the south side for this type of service and so-so, overpriced pizza? We wound up going next store to Vince's and had a fabulous meal, with liquor, for what we would have paid for pizza.  When we left Vince's at 9pm we saw the two owners riding their bikes down Balmoral.

So, it was with some curiosity that I made an almost hour-long trek up to Great Lake - a pizza place - to see what they had in store based on the recommendation of a friend who used to live in the area. Three pizzas, and an pseudo soup-nazi protection of the toppings (I couldn't have the toppings from pizza #1 applied to pizza #2).  I say this as a positive aspect -- these people know their pizza, and care deeply about their pizza, and frankly you can't have it your way because their way is better. After a brief discussion of the menu options I decided on the #2 pizza -- crimini mushrooms, sheep cheese (I can handle a little sheep or goat), and added garlic. This review is fairly lengthy, but it's only here in the middle that I'll actually talk about the pizza itself.  I won't say much because there isn't much to say that goes beyond what I said to Kate when she asked how my meal was, and that was this:    I HAD NO IDEA PIZZA COULD TASTE THIS GOOD. I said it then, and I'll repeat it now, and no matter how much I replay the delicious memory there's nothing else I can possibly think to add.

2012-08-05,2.0,"Pro: The pizza was very good. My husband and I are from the East Coast and we haven't been able to find pizza we really like here. We enjoyed our pizza last night, though this was the only good part of the experience - for some, that may be enough. Cons:  Rude people The people who own/work here are rude. We were the first in line at 5:00 - not too many people waiting b/c it has just poured down rain. This was our first time here. There are two tables for two inside and one table for six people. We went to sit down, but were told we had to order at the counter first. I asked the woman for a menu and said we didn't know what we wanted yet, so maybe she should have other people go before us. She didn't know what to do with that information and told/asked the other woman in an irritated way that we didn't know what we wanted, so what should she do? They did wind up letting us sit down to decide. Price The pizza is very overpriced. It cost $25 for what I would consider a medium size pizza. The other pizzas with toppings are more expensive. It's a very limited menu - just three pizza choices. Rude and pricey Since my husband and I were still hungry after we had our pizza and a salad, we decided to order another one, though that would mean our pizza and salad dinner would cost us about $70 when all was said and done. One of the women who worked there came over with our check, and I asked to order another pizza. She said that since some people were waiting, we couldn't order another one to eat there, we would have to take it to go. Totally bizarre. We left. I talked with some friends about this place today. They agreed that the pizza is good, and that the people who work there are very rude. I won't be going back.

I ordered 4 pizzas one night and they had them ready for me exactly when I needed them to be (I showed up about 2 hrs before I wanted pizza).  Here are the reasons the place gets 4 stars and not 5. 1. You have to call or stop by a while before you want a pizza. 2. It's a little pricey. It's worth it, but a go to place for me on a weeknight. 3. Most of the pizzas seem to be veggie oriented and those that have meat don't seem to have very much of it.

We came in at around 6pm on a Wednesday night.  The outside actually looks like a store and not like a restaurant.  For a moment we were like, ""Oh, wow, are they open?"" stood debating on the sidewalk, left, then realized that maybe we should open the door to find out if they are open?  Ta-da!  They were....so we were happy. Looking around, the restaurant is tiny.  I'm talkin like mini-boutique store tiny.  There were literally three tables to sit down.  The kind lady at the counter said it would be 1hr and 20 minutes for our own ""private"" table or we could be seated right away at the ""communal table"" which was literally just a longer dining table.  We opted to be seated right away as we were hungry. So, sitting in the middle of a nice three pair of women and two men at a long akward table, we ordered their special salad and the #1 with onions.  Everything we ate was really good and wholesome.  You can actually taste the ingredients in the pizza which is pretty rare. I know this sounds super ""American"" of me, but I just wish the place were a bit bigger, with a larger oven.  (They could only cook two pizzas at a time! Two!)  But, overall, the service was great and the pizza was amazing.  The crust was so good and though I don't tend to like strange cheese, the ""lamb cheese"" on our pizza was ridiculously good. Not sure I'd wait in line for this place, but overall it was very good. Oh, and PS- our total bill was $52 not including tip, for ONE PIZZA and ONE SALAD.  (pretty expensive for pizza, no?)  They don't accept credit cards for tip, so make sure to bring a cash tip.",0.998,0.746,0.224,0.03,0.5666179653679654

If you are expecting your basic pizza menu, where you can order several ingredients to be added to your pizza, you will not like this place.

Based on the many negative reviews here, I thought that the first time we ordered a pizza on the phone for pickup that there might be some issues with pickup time, etc. No, they were nothing but polite and pleasant. When my husband went to get the pizza, I had him bring an insulated bag to keep the pizza hot. When he got there, they were just pulling the pizza out of the oven (exactly at the time they said it would be ready, on a busy Saturday night).

However I can say after having had the pizza from here, not only is it completely not worth it from a time and monetary aspect, the pizza itself is nothing special. in fact, it's one of the worst pizzas I've had since living in Chicago. I now understand why Alan Richman, who rated this the best pizza in the country is considered such a hack by those in the know. After arriving at 5:30 on a Saturday to place a carryout order, and after appetizers and a couple beers at nearby Hopleaf, my girlfriend and I journeyed back to Great Lake at our mutually agreed upon pick up time of 7:00 pm to retrieve our $33 14"" pizza with tomatillo salsa, goat cheese and mortadella-- mortadella which I had heard so much about and for whatever reason was only available as a $5 ad-on for this specific pizza. We guarded it like diamonds on the drive home, eager with anticipation to partake in the orgy of pizzaness which was to occur upon thrusting slices of Great Lake into our mouths. We were sorely disappointed. The kind of disappointed a child asking for Nintendo for Christmas all year might feel when they finally run down the stairs and unwrap their presents on Christmas morning only to learn Santa had brought them the Sega Master System instead. The cheese was incredibly salty, greasy and gritty. Not qualities you look for in pizza cheese. It was so salty, as I write this 10 minutes after having eaten, my lips are shriveled and pruned. From a spot that has the earned the title of best pizza in America, however dubious, and even if our pizza was an anomaly, which clearly from the other reviews it's not, the level of saltiness turned it almost inedible, which is completely unacceptable. If you are on the fence about going, please, don't waste your time. There are many other local restaurants that offer a better pizza, ranging from Neapolitan style like Apart Pizza, to close as New York style as Chicago will come like Jimmy's.

And when you do get a table, it's very likely that you will be next to a couple or couples at a table.

The pizza does get quite floppy near the center (though stays intact). It's good pizza, but it's easy to say I've had better. The beet salad we had was a laughably paltry amount of thin beet slices. Altogether, it probably amounted to a single small beet with sprinkle of cheese and pile of wispy greens on top -- all for $11.

2012-02-02,4.0,"Great Lake had a mention in Esquire some time ago claiming it to be the best pizza around. I had never ventured all the way up to Andersonville for dinner when I actually lived in Chicago, so while visiting over a weekday and it was suggested we drive up there; I was in.  You should call before you go because 1) they run out of things 2) it is small, nay, tiny, so if you plan on eating in you better figure that out beforehand. 3) it takes a while to get your pizza 5) the hours of operation can be odd 4) the menu changes frequently and you might not like what they are offering. That being said, we called ahead and ordered, and drove there about an hour and a half later, we were $55 poorer and had two armfuls of pizza. I would be more dismayed by the price, but honestly, that's what you pay for quality pies when you dine in anywhere, so I'm not sure what all the price shock is about. One of the pies was a garlicky spinach pie and the other was a caramelized onion and house made chorizo pie. I didn't try the chorizo, but the spinach pizza was very very good. The crust was perfect, not too crispy, not too soft, and very salty, which I thought was a nice compliment to usually lack-luster crusts.  Overall, I would go back.

However, I can certainly see the vast majority of their customers being offended and upset as your treated like a nuisance and ignorant sheep.

I don't expect people at every restaurant I go to kiss my butt, but they can at least treat me like a person and not be a condescending d-bag. And those are the type of people that work here, so be ready for attitude if you walk through the doors here. If you can't be a decent person while interacting with people, the restaurant industry may not be the best place to work. - 2 stars for arrogance and bad attitude of employees. Another point to make here is the restaurant set up itself. If you don't have a decent size dining area, you need to pick a new location that at least offers enough space for a few more tables. I think the owner's want to feel like their product is in high demand so they keep the dining area as small as possible making people wait long amounts of time before they can be seated. I call this the Flight of the Conchords approach. You know when they played the ""sold out"" elevator gig, or the ""sold out"" van gig. Big spaces are overrated, it's all about being ""sold out."" -1 star for bad set up. One word to describe this pizza, salt! The other reviewers on here are correct. The people that make these pizzas love them some salt. [ Note to Mayor Emanuel, if the city is running low on salt for the streets this winter, come here and offer to buy their inventory of salt. You can probably clear a few neighborhoods with the amount of salt on the 2 pizzas we had alone!] I actually liked the well done crust, but that was the only thing I liked about this place.  And then there is the price...... dios mio man! This better be some of the best pizza ever for what they are charging. The 2 pies we had, which weren't that big were a total of $55. I wonder how much of the $55 dollars I spent went towards their salt budget? I've had far better Neapolitan pizza in NYC(and I HATE giving NYC any props when it comes to any style of pizza) and Chicago than this place. I have no problem paying more money than I probably should, as long as the food is great. Definitely not the case here.  - 3 stars for bad food, -1 additional star for pricing of said bad food.

Is this the best pizza in the United States?  It's pretty darn good, but a food writer making ""best"" lists is more about selling magazines.  Let's just say it's worth a trip to Andersonville.

I was a little thrown back when we first walked in and realized that this place is absolutely tiny. We immediately received a few stares as if we had walked into a movie party in which the record screeches to a halt and everyone looks at you as if you don't belong. The woman at the front desk put our name on the list, took our phone number, and mentioned she would call us when a table opened.  We ventured back out in to the cold in search of a local watering hole. I started feeling as if maybe the reviews were right simply based upon our experience walking in. We eventually found a pub a little down Clark and before we could even order a beer we received the call. We quickly scurried back and claimed our table. We popped our wine and started to peruse the small menu. My date and I started with the salad with the herb buttermilk dressing. It was, well, good. Nothing to write home about, but overall a solid starter. Then came the pizza, oh the pizza. Maybe it was because I was in the mood for pizza, was utterly starving, or that I had already put down a couple glasses of wine, but this pizza was exceptional. So good it makes you want to slap yo momma (sorry I always wanted to say that in a review). First, the pizza was perfectly cooked. The crust was nice and crispy, but not burnt. The cheese was slightly browned, but not over cooked. The fresh/delicious ingredients were not over done and perfectly spread out. I sure don't consider myself a pizza snob, but all in all it was scrumdiddlyumptious. I'm not saying that this was the best pie I've ever inhaled, but definitely slides into my top 3. I guess the real reason I felt compelled to post a review was that the staff was extremely courteous.  Our waitress was patient and happy to answer any questions we had. I walked in with visions of the soup Nazi. Thinking some guy from across the counter was going to yell ""NO PIZZA FOR YOU!"" after I asked for a recommendation. This could not have been further from the truth. We were the last customers in the place and all three employees even said thank you before we made our way out the door. Were they over the top polite? No, but by no means were they rude.

2011-06-15,4.0,"Tie my bandana, I have joined the cult. All that stuff about Great Lake being the best pizza in Chicago?  It's true.  But it doesn't come easy. The place feels like a kitchen on a communist cult compound.  Be cool.   Don't ask questions.  Follow someone else's lead.  Just...act...natural. I admit it; I only skimmed the reviews, and all I registered was that the pizza was magnificent.  My eyes fell upon such superlatives as, ""perfect,"" ""to die for"", and ""best in the city,"" and I was compelled.  I really had no idea what I was in for. The place is as small as the little end of nothin' sharpened. There are two two-tops and a picnic table.  The two of us were seated in the center of the picnic table between two groups.  It's the boobs' spot.  Both groups ceased their conversations and turned to stare at us as we were seated.  It was awkward.  Great Lake is going for a communal feeling, but it doesn't really fly.  If you're going to sit me on someone's lap, introduce me first.  Perhaps they should provide name-tag stickers.  That could help break the ice.  The posted list of local supplier farmers and producers is more than twice the length of the menu itself.  As a member of the cult, you love this.  You really, really care. The menu is exclusive. Want an appetizer?  You will have the salad.  That's all there is.  You have two dressings to choose between, and you will relish the choice. There are precisely 3 pizzas.  Each one is 14 inches and 23 or 24 dollars.  Each pizza has its own choices for toppings, and each topping is 4 or 5 dollars.  That's right.  4 dollars for spring onions, and somehow it's WORTH IT.   The pizza was truly magnificent.  Good lord! It was superb.  The crust is the proverbial Kool-Aid.  Crispy, chewy, and beautifully bubbled, each bite is a singular indulgence.  The slight tang of the sourdough tickles the tongue and takes the taste buds to heaven.  I found myself chewing ultra-slowly and closing my eyes in delight as I did so.  More on the pizza after this brief public service announcement. The service is not really service at all.  The bandana-clad pizza-chefs double as servers, and will visit your table exactly thrice. Once to take your order, once to bring your food, once to bring your check.  They are not the ""Hi! My name is ___"" type of server that is there to ""take care of you tonight!""  They will write down your order.  They will bring you your food.  They have pizza to toss! They don't have time for jokes, so don't make any.   Thankfully, you can refill your own water from the nifty Scandinavian-designed pitchers on the table.  These pitchers are for sale.  They sit on a bookshelf full of sundry Scandinavian doodads, better suited to be sold somewhere else.  Seriously, they could fit two more tables in that space!   Speaking of missed opportunities:  the wasted window nook is a tragedy of monumental proportions.  Instead of having one spacious two-top, two cramped two-tops, or a counter overlooking the quaint neighborhood street, the window space is filled with stuff that looks like junk.  What is this, a yard sale?  Why am I sitting on a stranger when I could be luxuriating in a view of Andersonville and the pleasures of personal space?   Why?  Because they're commies, that's why.   Use the loo before you show up.  The position of the miniscule, unisex bathroom is patently absurd.  Who planned this place, Punchinello?  If the picnic table is a loud-talker's hell, the trip to the loo is a klutz's worst nightmare.  You have to shimmy your way through the cramped kitchen (which is visible to the entire restaurant) past the pizza-making servers who have no choice but to stop what they are doing to let you through.  Don't slip!  Don't trip! Don't sneeze!  Just pray you don't have to go twice. The atmosphere won't calm nor comfort you, but the pizza is a siren singing your name. We opted for pizza #1, with tomato sauce, farmers cheese, dante cheese, fresh herbs and grey sea salt.  There is a paragraph of description detailing each ingredient and its origin (it's not olive oil, it's California olive ranch arbequina extra virgin olive oil) which is informative, if a bit over the top.   Every bite was transcendent.  I totally forgot about my capitalistic quibbles as I reveled in the wonders of flavor and consistency that are usually relegated to my dreams.   I was in bliss.  I was beside myself.  I'm still wrestling with disbelief.  It was worth it!  That marvelous, magical pizza was worth every moment of cramped, communist awkwardness and every penny of inflated price.   Do it.  Drink the Kool-Aid.",0.9976,0.795,0.148,0.057,0.5346710189452125

Take for example, a recent review that gives 3 stars based solely on the lack of meat toppings that day. I too ate at Great Lake before the Alan Richman review, and also on a night without meat on the menu. For me, meat is normally a preferred pizza topping, however I am unwilling to downgrade my rating for unknown reasons with too many possible variables.  Instead, I prefer to focus on their effort that day, without bias. Personally, I think the pizza was nothing short of brilliant. How can a simple margherita pizza standout among so many other offerings in the city, or country for that matter? In my opinion, I believe the quality of the ingredients are top shelf, but perhaps most importantly, the crust is absolutely wonderful - the best I have ever had. A great deal of care goes into their pizza, and it shows in the final product. Unfortunately, uninformed reviews abound on this site.

But the pizza. Oh the pizza. We had the first item, which was a traditional cheese number with spring onions and young garlic. The crust is oh so good. It's sturdy enough to hold up without flopping over, and it has a pleasant crunch on the first bite. But it's chewy, just like good thin crust should be. I'd buy a loaf of this stuff. The cheese was perfect and substantial. The garlic was pleasant but not overpowering. We didn't get anything else, but saw that our neighbors' salads were huge - more than enough for two.

2011-04-17,1.0,"Food - The ingredients appeared fresh, though I've had better pizza before.  I think it's a stretch to consider this as being the best pizza.  You can essentially buy the same ingredients from Whole Foods and make an equivalent pizza at home for 1/3 of the price - and mind you Whole Foods isn't necessarily cheap either.  We ordered the #1 with mortadella and #3 with bacon.  Both pizzas tasted pretty good, but they weren't memorable.  The #3 was way too salty. Service - I went in to place the order around 8:40pm and it seemed there was a slight hesitation to take my order given they close at 9:30pm.  Luckily there were no issues.  They indicated the pizzas would be ready at 9:40pm; however, when I arrived they hadn't even put the pizzas into the oven.  The pizzas were ready at 10pm.  They weren't apologetic or recognized the delay, which is one of the reasons I'm giving one star.  Given the price tag, you would expect to see more professional service. Value - The quality of the pizza and service cannot justify the $25-$30 price tag.  I recognize they use fresh local ingredients, but even the quality of the takeout pizza box is very cheap and flimsy.   In general if you are the type of person who only shops at whole foods and is obsessed with farmers markets, you may really like this place.  Otherwise you can have a better experience shopping the fresh ingredients yourself and making an equivalent or better pizza at home.   The only memory to takeaway from our experience is that it did not live up  to the hype and rave reviews.  We won't be coming back.",0.9868,0.819,0.147,0.034,0.5140322580645161

This a very amature place, not even a real restaurant with awful service.  You need to walk through the small kitchen to get to the tiny bathroom.  It's watching your grandmother try to make pizza in her own kitchen, not ok as a paying customer.",-0.8555,0.877,0.03,0.093,0.43556456770742474

Ordered a Cimini mushroom with smoke bacon.  The pizza came out just overloaded with mushrooms and the crust was really soggy.  The outside crust had a nice char and sweetness.  I can't say why Alan Richman from GQ rated this joint the best pizza in the country...  If the pizza had about a quarter of the toppings and a better balance with cheese, it would have been better.  At 27 bucks a pizza (22 + 5 for the bacon), you can do much, much better in Chicago.  On the other hand, just go to Phoenix and have a pizza at Bianco, Seattle Serious Pie or LA - Pizzeria Antica (near LAX).

2011-04-07,2.0,"The reviews here are right.  Went back to Great Lake last night with a friend, and it still just doesn't impress me. The pizza is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best in the city, let alone the U.S. If I could describe it more accurately, I would say it's a ""small, very idiosyncratic ""restaurant"" that sells flatbread with just three choices at any time for topping combinations."" The toppings are not what you're used to seeing in a pizzeria (last night, if you wanted a pizza with mozzarella and red sauce, you could only get mushrooms and mortadella, which is basically like fancy bologna; the other choices were both pizzas WITHOUT mozzarella or red sauce, but you could get bacon and onions, or bacon and mushrooms. They grate a little fancy, parmesan-ish cheese on top, but not really enough for you to notice. And we were told SPECIFICALLY that you cannot mix-and-match pizza bases and the toppings already specified for each base. So, even if you wanted to, they do not allow you to add bacon to the pizza that has mozz and sauce.)  So, you see, you are pretty limited in what you can get, and I hesitate to even call it a pizzeria, because that's not what you should expect. You should expect a very limited offering of round flatbread, with a rotating selection of organic or local ingredients. I should add that the pizza is not cheap.  Pizza with red sauce and mozz ran $22 plain. Add $5 for mushrooms, and $3 for mortadella. Or maybe it was the other way around. Anyway, for eat-in, it ended up being $36 for 1 pizza and no drinks.  So now you know about the food, which is really the most commendable part of the restaurant. The reason it's hard to like this place, though, is the service and the attitude of the restaurant. Plenty of other reviewers have mentioned this, but they are almost like Chicago's own version of a pizza Nazi--and not just in the fact that they care about the food---more the fact that even though they run a ""restaurant"", they seem to completely deny that they are in the service or hospitality industry! I promise I'm not a ranter, but I think all the other negative reviews on here add up--it's not just one crazy person who had a bad experience. It really is the restaurant!  Their attitude seems to be that it's a privilege for YOU, the customer, to be eating one of their pizzas, rather than it being a privilege for them to collect your hard-earned dollars and serve you medium-good pizza.  Some of the really irksome things--the lady with the curly dark hair told us to get out of there because the area inside the restaurant was only for takeout orderers. We were next on the list to be seated and I saw there was a two-top who had gotten their check so I thought it would only be a few minutes, but she insisted. So, we obediently filed out, after having been rudely asked to leave. No call from the restaurant for about half an hour, during which, we were getting really hungry and bought some other food to tide us over. When we finally got the call from the restaurant, we saw that they had seated two other people, who must have known the owner or been friends with them because they were NOT on the list when we left, at the two-person table we thought we were getting. Instead, we were told to sit in the middle seats at the communal table, even when there were 4-5 open seats at the table. We sat there, on little stools without chairbacks, basically in the conversation of the party of 3 next to us, staring at the empty seats on our other side.  Two people walked in way later and got the two seats on the end. Good for them! It was over an hour wait after we ordered for the pizza to come. They whole thing was like a farce--how to torture your customers and make them feel REALLY unimportant to you.  I should give them no stars, but I thought the pizza was okay, and I'm not stingy. I just think everyone who thinks about going here should be forewarned--it's expensive, they have major attitude, they DON'T care about you, you will probably wait longer than you think is fair, and the pizza is ok, but you could do a lot better in the city. It's too bad they continue to treat their customers like DIRT. Get a clue, Great Lake!",0.9864,0.814,0.111,0.075,0.44936284372904084

THEN he tells me that we had to schedule an APPOINTMENT to pick up our pizza. They could only make our pizza at 7pm apparently, no sooner and no later, and we had to be there at 7pm to pick it up. OK, whatever, I don't make dentist appointments, but I'll make an appointment to eat the best pizza in the country.

Au-fuckin'-rora, can you believe that? Now I'm getting really excited. THEN, about 15 minutes later (i'm still waiting), they bring out this lady's pizza and set it in front of her. Then the Aurora-lady takes ONE BITE of her pizza and loudly exclaims to the counter lady ""OH MY GOD! THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I'VE *EVER* HAD"". That's right .... ONE BITE. And afterwards her eyes rolled back in her head and she made some weird noises that were actually really hot. ALL IN FRONT OF HER 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, she just couldn't hold those feelings inside, I guess. When she regains composure she tells them to bake her another one for the way home ... I'M NOT MAKING ANY OF THIS UP.

2011-03-24,5.0,"I'm not one to shy from culinary controversy and after finally trying Great Lake, I'm so pleased to add my own enthusiastic five cents and stars to this charming little shop that manages to inspire such impassioned dialogue in this community. Thanks to yelpers' advice, I showed up to place an order at what is likely the best possible time to avoid the infamous waiting: right when they open on a rainy Wednesday. My companion and I showed up about five minutes before 5 pm and there was only one pair waiting before us.  We ordered #1 (tomato, homemade mozz, aged mona cheese, and fresh herbs) plus requested both possible add-ons: cremini mushrooms and salami. Ours was a take-out order but we would have been able to sit immediately if we'd planned to stay there. We were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait, totally reasonable for any pizza shop and, true to their word, our hot piping pie was ready to go shortly after we returned from a stroll with our dogs around the hood. We got back in time to see that they add the super-thin salami slices to the pizza after they remove it from the oven, so that the salami basically melts onto the surface. It was a torturous drive home for me, as the passenger with the coveted meal sitting on my lap. I should add that I was acutely hungry- one step away from having the shakes, I was so hungry. That may not have been the ideal state in which to anticipate fine cuisine, since a fast food burger may have tasted gourmet to me in that moment. Nevertheless, I'd say that my senses were actually most discerning and engaged because of the level of my hunger. There's a great quote by the writer H.T. Hamann which feels relevant here: ""The awfulest hunger is the type quenched too soon, before it becomes protracted and superior, makes you graceful and clever."" My hunger was turning me into something like a super-hero, so trust me, okay? Let me start with the smells emanating from the box... there was something vaguely sweet about the scent, as if I could just as easily be carrying a box of warm, fresh cinnamon rolls. It was an irresistible aroma- three dogs going crazy in the backseat confirmed this. But, it was not just an appetite-inducing scent. There was something else inspired in me- something amatory and sensual, something like nostalgia. When it finally came time to eat the pizza, we paired it with a Petite Sirah. And yes, I believe that the tastiness of this food is absolutely worth its hype. I'm not into assigning superlatives, but I cannot readily remember enjoying pizza this much, except for maybe once at a tiny bakery in Aix-en-Provence. My partner-in-consumption ranked it #2 in her own life's span, coming in second after a pizza she ate in New York. It was unadulterated fresh ingredients, without the commonplace element that makes so many pizzas taste essentially the same. The flavors and texture were unique to this pie alone.  I love love love that they keep the menu small, based exclusively on what ingredients are available. This is how food was meant to be prepared and enjoyed.",0.9984,0.769,0.192,0.04,0.619044339498885

2010-11-13,5.0,"Dinner on Friday was to've been Bonsoiree but that all changed when Schwa called me and changed things up on Thursday.  Frustrating as it was at first, what resulted was not only a swapping of dates between Schwa and Bonsoiree, but a later seating at Schwa that opened up an opportunity I could not pass up - the opportunity for an early pre-dinner featuring what many (including Alan Richman who took the place global on his GQ list) consider to be the best Pizza in America - Great Lake.  Traveling with my sister and her friend we called ahead to find out Great Lake would open at 5:00pm and we arrived in Andersonville around 4:30, grabbed a cup of coffee at Kopi, and proceeded to wait in the line already sporting two other couples. Standing in front of the large window with curtain drawn we could see the vague outlines of Nick Lessins and crew working inside and I explained to my colleagues the controversial Pizza-Nazi-esque reputation that has been spread across the net.  Undeterred by the stories and rather intrigued by the ethics of a husband/wife team that have stayed true to their roots - cooking each pie individually, sourcing everything they can locally or from well trusted providers, and honing their craft in the image of the restaurant that inspired them (Pizzeria Bianco) - instead of selling out and compromising an operation they clearly love, I rather figured the trip would be worth the effort.  As we stood and a few snowflakes fell a car pulled up and out hopped Lydia Esparza with a large bag of groceries - making her way past the now 14 person line she opened the door and ushered us in. Making our way in the door we simply followed the line up to the counter where Lessins could be seen preparing crusts and a young man was quickly chopping the ingredients Lydia had brought.  Browsing the menu on the wall there were three pizzas, three addable ingredients, and two salads available for the evening - we quickly came to a consensus and placed our order.  Handed a cork with two aces it was suggested we sit at an end at the communal table. Seated for a few moments a young man brought us water and three cups - we were left to pour our own, as were all persons providing their own wine.  As we sat and chatted we watched Nick slowly prepare each pizza step by step - throwing the dough, adding olive oil, placing each ingredient by hand, and manning the oven all on his own.  We also chuckled as Lydia shot down a special request (from a particularly annoying mother with two young girls who unfortunately sat right next to us) to order Pizza #2 without black pepper. With the gas oven capable of making only two pizzas at a time we sat for approximately 20 minutes before the first two came out of the oven and watched with baited breath as our neighbors indulged.  With a short line slowly forming outside we additionally started to realize the non-stop calls coming in for carryout orders - by the time we left the pickup time was nearly 2 hours.  Thankfully our wait was much less considerable and the pizza was delivered to our table a mere 35 minutes after sitting down. Delivered piping hot with cheese still bubbling our #1 with Tomato, Homemade Fresh Mozzarella, Mona Aged Cheese, Basil, Oregano, Rosemary, and 1/2 with thick cut Gunthorp Farms Bacon was every bit as good as the rumors.  Ten slices in total and featuring what I can only describe as the ""perfect"" crust I actually burned the roof of my mouth in taking my first bite - the supple charred crust proving astoundingly chewy beneath the creamy house mozzarella and cow/sheep blend.  With the spice blend nicely complimenting the exquisitely sweet and mildly acidic tomatoes and the smoky bacon adding its characteristic savoriness the totality of the pizza was exactly what you expect when you think of ""pizza"" and given the quality of ingredients and preparation it was that ""pizza"" in its ideal form. Settling the admittedly hefty $30 (w/tax+tip) tab after three slices each we thanked Lydia and Nick (I think Nick may have even looked up from the pizza station and smiled) and made our way to the street.  Having eaten a number of other top notch pizzas from ovens of wood, coal, and gas I can say without a doubt that while I often prefer esoteric ingredients there is no doubt in my mind that the crust and ingredients at Great Lake are amongst the best I've ever tasted.  Is it the best in the USA - I don't know, I really liked Osteria, Tacconelli's, and Supinos as well. While some people may not like the ""attitude,"" I'm okay with a man (or woman) truly dedicated to his/her craft and if they want to be perfect  six hours a day and four days a week I'm okay with that - perfection is worth waiting for.",0.9993,0.801,0.171,0.028,0.48012643041712805

I'm sure they use fresh local ingredients as their menu boasts, but the amount of salt on every one of the three pizzas we ordered made the taste of any of the quality product disappear -- it was that overpowering. We ordered the bread and butter to start. The butter was very good. But I'd rather buy some butter at whole foods or the farmer's market from a local vendor because then at least I might be able to get some decent bread to go with it. Like I said above, we ordered three pizzas, spinach, a mushroom one and something else. They all sucked. The crust was inedible and waayyy to salty. When we walked in all of the tables had mounds of crust left over, which shocked us to see at such a highly reviewed restaurant. But once we tried the crust, we knew exactly why and did the same thing. I'd rather spend my money at Piece, La Madia, Nella and Art of Pizza -- at least at those places I get great pizza and for half the cost. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here, not even just to try and form their own opinion. It honestly was THAT bad.",0.7118,0.842,0.093,0.065,0.47918803418803413

2010-08-29,1.0,"I think I have like one other one star review on here. I hate giving a place one star, especially a place as highly touted as Great Lake. I ask myself: am I rating it so low based on my lofty expectations? That's not fair to the business, but, man, the pizza sucked. Am I rating it low because I want to be the cool kid that hates the place everyone else loves? I wish that were it, because then there would be a chance that I took the slightest bit of enjoyment out of this pizza. But, I digress. Let's start from the beginning. Don't worry, we'll go fast. Everything people say about the service is true. It'd be better if it was nonexistant. They were extremely rude to my wife and not helpful at all. Whatever, it's ""the best pizza in the world"" and we were prepared for this assholishness due to you, my fellow Yelpers. We went at 5:30 on a Wednesday and were told our pizza would be ready for pick up by about 7. That seems a bit extreme, but, okay, we were prepared for that. There were six of us eating, so that meant we got one of each of their not-so-wide assortment of, well, three pizzas. I don't care if it really was the best pizza in the world, $85 for three pizzas is ridonkulous. Still, not mad. Seriously, not mad at all. On the ride home, the pizza smelled great and eased away all my worries. Maybe it wasn't that dramatic, but, it was close.  Then we ate the pizza. The first slice in my mouth was the Tomato, Homemade Fresh Mozzarella, blah blah blah. It was salt. I thought I was going insane. I took another bite. Salt. And I'm talking salt lick levels of salt. I thought I was crazy so I looked around the table. No, everyone had the same look of disgust on their faces that I did. On the inside, I told myself to be cool in the way that only people in movies seem to do so. I went for a slice of the Spinach, Fresh Cream, you get the point. Better. Not good, hardly edible, and with sodium levels just barely above the level of a salt lick. Still, I could taste the ingredients this time. They were fresh, but they sure weren't flavorful. My depression grew to levels not seen since I didn't have a date to the high school prom (it's cool, I had a date eventually). Slice three. Zucchini, Aged Goat Cheese, Smoked Paprika. There's hope here. I like zucchini, goat cheese could rule the world, and paprika is everyone's best friend. But, damn it, French sea salt dominates all of them. I never did like the French. Not as salty as the first pizza, and much tastier than either of the first two, this was probably my favorite. But, that's like saying Batman and Robin is the best worst movie of all time because it's just so ridiculous you can't help but laugh.  We had three pizzas. There were six of us. The verdict was unanimous. We won't ever be going back to back to Great Lake, not even if they paid us. Seriously. This is the worst restaurant pizza I've ever had. Well, that I've ever had sober. What? It's a very important qualifier. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to go unclog my arteries with the hope I can live beyond the age of 30.",0.9979,0.665,0.226,0.109,0.5500370370370369

Really, getting ""in"" here can be painless if you have an ounce of patience and a friend. The environment was cozy and welcoming - just a few tables and a small menu (I hear they rotate pizza flavors and offer 3 at a time). I felt like I was sitting in a family kitchen and that my pizza was being handmade with care while I waited - oh wait, that's exactly what did happen. There are no words to describe the deliciousness of this pizza. The crust was perfectly crispy, chewy, and flavorful. The ratio of toppings was just right and the fresh ingredients really spoke for themselves. I personally believe it's unfair to give restaurants you haven't even tried a bad Yelp rating. It's a small, family joint. They can't accommodate everyone's needs every night. If you are willing to accept this and plan accordingly, you will be just fine. If not, well, I would say it's your loss, but people who feel so entitled to ingratiating service probably wouldn't realize what they were missing.

2010-08-01,5.0,"Now, before you think about going to Great Lake, you really do have to plan ahead. Personally, I think your best bet is to always carry out and even then, you can expect to wait at least 1-2 hours before your pizza is ready. It's not that they purposely enjoy watching their customers suffer, it's just that they only cook two pizzas at once. When you call, they'll tell you when it'll be done and they're usually spot on.  Half the battle is just accepting that you're going to have to wait longer than what you're used to. Luckily, there really is a lot to do on Clark St. in Andersonville, so while your waiting, you can grab a drink at Hopleaf, Simon's or a ton of other places. There's also plenty of art shops, book stores and home decor type places to check out.  Now, for the pizza itself. Personally, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to tell the difference between Great Lake's fresh, local, organic blah blah blah and any other solid pizza. After all, I'm perfectly satisfied with a $5 Little Caesar's Hot n' Ready.  I can tell you with absolute certainty, it's the best pizza I've ever had.  While I think most well-known restaurants are overrated, Great Lake is not. The cheese is sprinkled lightly on, the crust is thin in the middle; crispy and chewy on the edges, just as many other reviews have said. It has a certain richness to it that other pizza just doesn't have. The last time I went, I had the no. 2, which at this point is the zucchini with black pepper and I added pepperoni. It was fantastic, however, I would recommend selecting a pizza (i.e. the no. 1) with their tomato sauce. I'm not a big tomato guy, but their sauce is fantastic.  Finally, I suppose I should address the service. I really think people on here are way too sensitive. My theory is that when it comes to a place like this, one that is incredibly delicious, small, off the beaten path and where the owners deal directly with the customers, people want to feel special. They want to be part of some exclusive club where the owners know them by name and know their order and blah blah blah. Like that Skull and Bones movie with Pacy from Dawson's Creek with the secret handshakes and cloaks and whatever, only this time with pizza.  The reality is, the Great Lake owners just don't come across as being overly social. Big deal. Not everyone is really outgoing and friendly, get over it. It doesn't mean that they're rude, it just means they're not as comfortable talking with people. Personally, I've never had an issue with them.",0.993,0.79,0.153,0.057,0.5179815711595372

Businesses operate with their public in mind, a level of courtesy and some respect for the customer, basic adherence to business hours and a product that people enjoy. The product here is the overall experience, not just the pizza. This is a service business and the service, basic communication skills and empathy for the customer is not existent here.

Here's how I avoided the long waits and such:  springtime.  Husband and I placed a take-out order, then went over to Charley's on Clark Street and had drinks and appetizers.  An hour later, we returned, waited ten minutes more, then took our prize to a park bench just outside and devoured.  A perfect Chicago moment.  Thanks Great Lake - we had a great non-traditional experience.",0.9768,0.78,0.193,0.028,0.44076023391812863

2010-06-11,2.0,"I eat a lot of pizza. Good pizza, bad pizza, doesn't matter. And this pizza, as publicized, is quite good. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce was zesty, and the crust (although soft toward the middle) was above average. And for a $25 pie that takes 40 minutes to arrive, it better damn well be good. Actually, it should change my entire life and make me question my existence and what I've been doing eating sub-par pie my whole life. But it's not so good that I'd come back over and over again accepting no substitute. That said, if I'm in the area, like I was last night, and have an hour to kill, I might come by to see if they don't have a wait.  Why wouldn't I wait like the rest of the sheep on a Friday or Saturday to grab a seat in their dining room that's barely bigger than my closet? Simple. Too much hassle. For starters, you're sitting on top of people. For places like Avec, it works well. For a pizza place? I think they're trying too hard to come off as pompous and elitist.  The service was pathetic. I've worked in the service industry for 10 years as a busser, waiter, and cook. The staff at Great Lake needs the collective stick from their asses removed before I start recommending this place to people. We got our pizza and never heard a peep from them until the bill came. You're serving 12-15 people, not a banquet hall, come around now and then to make sure everything is good! Or don't, but at least crack a smile.  Did I mention the cost? For two people, eating one pizza, and drinking one of their San Pellegrino Orange drinks (its BYOB, so they only serve water and an orange drink..like prison) was $35. Bill came to $30.14 and although I may have thought their service was barely better than a soup kitchen's, I left them fiver cause I'm a nice guy.  And here's the kicker: tips can only be given as cash. This came as a surprise as they say they take Mastercard and Visa but when the bill came, the receipt said that they can't add a tip to the card. Really? I've NEVER heard that in my life. I don't know if they want to avoid Uncle Sam's taxes or what, but I had to head down to the corner to break a $20.  Simply put: Above average pizza at way above average prices served to you by straight-faced, moody employees in a setting no bigger than the average person's dining room.

That was before Nick Lessins and Lydia Esparza's diminutive pizzeria was named the nation's best by none other than GQ Magazine. Today, the line for Great Lakes' singular pies forms long before the restaurant even opens its doors and, with a small communal table and a few two tops on the sidewalk during summer, it's a veritable squeeze until closing time. Lucky some of us live just a half a block away and can enjoy a more civilized take-out experience. On Great Lakes' truncated menu of pizzas, no ingredient is unaccompanied by the name of the farm or ranch on which it was raised. Please excuse my lack of specificity in regards to each component's provenance as I recount what you'll be enjoying. While the restaurant's offerings change with the seasons, memorable pies include a tarte flambée-inspired combination of bacon, onion, and crème fraîche; green garlic and cream; and chipotle salsa and corn. Nick also turns out traditional pairings like tomato sauce and salumi, but the sauceless ""white"" pies do a better job of highlighting his exquisite crust. Pizza aficionados know it's all about the crust, and Great Lakes' bubbly, chewy, crisp, and flavorful interpretation may be the best this Chicago-bred and New Haven-educated has had yet. The Lessins-Esparza's reverence for good design is reflected not only in their perfectly composed pizzas, but also in their ever-changing window display of art objects and a mid-century Alvar Aalto tea trolley.

When our #1 arrived an hour later, oozing creamy mozzarella placed among fresh mushrooms and tomatoes, and resting upon a perfectly-salted, pillowy, delicate crust, it was FANTABULOUS.  The young guy behind the counter was adequately polite.

Now some random points that just need to be said.  *Throw everything you know about eating out and pizza out the window.  *As to service, if you were in Europe it would be small and charming.  *It's small because you are basically walking into their private kitchen. For all I know their bedroom and closet is on the other side of the wall next to the mixer and I wouldn't be surprised.  *The owners are (and I mean this in the nicest way) more or less idiot savant.

An unleavened dough makes up the bottom crust, which is thin, light and crackery. The rim is a yeasted crust that seems to be applied to the other crust, thus is puffy and slightly chewy. The toppings were exquisite and the salad surprisingly delicious. Just remember to BYOB--otherwise, you just get water! Bottom line, go because this famous pizza is famous for a reason.

Tonight, once again, the crust was incredible. 1/100th of an inch of crispiness with the rest of it having a fresh chewy stretchiness. Nothing remotely resembling the sogginess described on some posts. We've seen that at some places. Usually it's attributable to high moisture ingredients like buffalo mozzarella combined with the high temperature pizza ovens required to get the crispiness pizzaiolos strive for. Also, the ingredients are top notch. We frequently see both the owners at the local organic farmers market picking up their ingredients. My girlfriend likes to get there before 9 which can be somewhat brutal on a Saturday morning.  Lots of people on Yelp seem put out by the wait and the service.

2010-04-05,2.0,"""People are going to be people."" Ms Esparza, one of the co-owners of Great Lake accepts when being interviewed by the New York Times on their newfound fame and notoriety. I'm sure they love Alan Richman. (how can you even name a pizza, ""best pizza in the nation""? He understands that there's a lot of nostalgia in choosing a pizza but completely disregards it because unfortunately, no one showed him one with good crust)- Great Lake has a pretty good if irregular crust.  I've read plenty and plenty of reviews about horrible service and I feel that it IS and IS NOT justified. First of all, my girlfriend and I had pretty good service. Our servers were very kind and always smiling. Sure, we had to pour our own water sometimes but it was always refilled and they came by to help pour the water as well. I understand that the American standard is at least a 15% tip and as a struggling student, I understand that there has to be some justification for the tip. In my experience, I've had much better at less-expensive restaurants but I've also had much worse at pricier ones. On to the main attraction: the pie. Alan Richman knighted their Mortadella pie best in the United States because of two main factors: the crust and the epiphany that the slice he was eating represented everything great about the new wave in pizza making. I had the cheese pizza by the way-which didn't win them the frustrating best pizza in America designation 1) THE CRUST. I was enlightened but mostly disappointed. The edges of the crust were everything I read about: burnt in bits, a bit crunchy and close to chewy, porous ciabatta. The best part had to be the sprinkle of salt around the outside. The VERY DISAPPOINTING part was that the crust was only firm until 3 inches toward the center of the pizza. The center of the pizza was a mess. It was so messy that my girlfriend asked me why I was using a fork and knife to eat the pizza and I told her that it was to keep the pizza from pouring all over myself. The outer two inches were all burnt bread anyways. Save, for the salt, it was almost unappetizing. That left me a little 8 inch diameter mess of toppings in the middle. I want to say (without a pizza background) that the crust is the most important aspect and Richman hit that in the head because without carefully reading his review, I knew that it could be special but my pizza was improperly cooked. 2) AMERICAN PIZZA. I love the whole locally-sourced movement. I wish I had the money to support it but it makes our pizza an almost unaffordable $21. Richman says that the pizza is original and creative. Without the mortadella, my pizza was a basic slice of cheese pizza. With a little salt scattered on the crust. Sure, the ingredients were great. Cremini mushroom addition was also great but not original. The tomatoes needed a little sugar.  Alas, the crust failed the whole pizza. I mean, what good are the toppings if the whole delivery mechanism, great crust, fails. The limp, runny center of the pizza distracted me. Iconic American pizza imagery is shoving a slice in your mouth with your hands, not a fork and knife. I blame Richman for disillusioning me but I blame Great Lake for serving inconsistent and pricey pizza. At least Domino's pan pizza got the crust right PLUS it's only $5.",0.9983,0.675,0.222,0.103,0.550701271302537

2010-03-21,3.0,"There is a lot to say when talking about Great Lake. For those unfamiliar, Great Lake is an extremely small (12 seats that I could count) pizza storefront in Andersonville that is open Wed-Sat from 5:30pm-10:30pm. A husband-wife team runs the place and makes the food. Wait times can exceed two hours, even for pick ups. The menu features only 3 pizzas that rotate randomly (each cost ~$21). Even knowing these peculiarities, the buzz is that the pizza is some of the best in the country, using fresh and local ingredients. I was intrigued. Trying to get a table for 3 on a Friday night at 7:30pm was quite foolish. Since we already parked and made the trip, we figured better to order take-out than nothing at all. The only problem is that they have their small oven planned out and that we could come back to pick up our one pie at 9:30pm, i.e. closing time. Even with the wait, the price, the ""service,"" and other ""ways I wouldn't run my business,"" the pizza is good, scary good. I've read that some don't call it pizza because the crust is so uniquely tasty and there is not a lot of sauce or cheese (more like flat bread). We ordered the #1, most would call it a margherita (cheese, sauce and herbs). I think the local specialized ingredients shine through and taste fantastic. I also approve of the proportions, just the right amount of toppings for thin crust pizza. The crust, however, is the most interesting and delicious pizza crust I've ever had. The bottom stays firm and steady throughout the entire piece, while the actual crust is more like fresh baked bread topped with sea salt. I'm not sure how it's done, but even if I knew, I couldn't replicate the result. Though the pizza was very tasty, I don't think I will be making the effort to have another slice. Quoting a friend of mind, ""would I want to go home and eat it tonight? Absolutely."" Will I go back, wait for hours, get treated like an alien and pay over $20 for pizza? Not likely.

I also ended up ordering a salad after eating the pizza because I saw one come out of the kitchen and it looked so good.  It was very rustic and again the ingredients were super fresh. The service-- I showed up here around 7 on a Wednesday and I must have gotten lucky because we only had to wait a couple minutes for a spot at the communal table.  Later we were asked to move to a smaller two person table so the communal table could accommodate more people, which seemed a little strange at first, but wasn't a big deal as our food hadn't arrived yet. They don't take reservations so it's definitely a gamble going here on a weekend, and the pizza took awhile to bake (there is one chef making the pizzas right behind the counter) but I encountered no rudeness and everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves.",0.9474,0.82,0.14,0.04,0.5009523809523809
2010-02-25,5.0,"Best pizza I've had in a really long time.  Simply amazing.  Unless you've had pizza outside of the US (mainly Europe), you probably have never had something quite like this.  One of the big differences, for example, is the absence of the typical tomato sauce you find in all american pizzas.  I believe only one of their pizzas has a tomato base.  I urge you to at least try it.  Might not be your thing, or you maylove it.  I absolutely loved - perfect thin crust, fresh ingredients, etc. I see a lot of angst here with regards to the customer service.  Some reviews are even saying the pizza was just OK because the service was bad - I fail to see the relation of how taste can be influenced by service.  Personally, I did not experience any negative service - that is also because I had the right frame of mind for this place.  Things you need to keep in mind: a) place sits about 10 - 12 tops (thats being generous), b) the entire place is the size of a large master bedroom (tables, kitchen, etc), c) oven space for pizzas is limited.  Knowing that, here is what you need to come to terms with: 1. If you want to sit and enjoy your pizza there, either come at opening time, or be ready to wait for a very long time (no reservations). 2. If you want your pizza in 15 - 30 minutes, you will have better luck calling Domino's.  Like I said, this place has limited oven space, and most people call for their pizza in advance.  You should take this as a cue to do the same and call in at 6pm to tell them you would like to pick up your pie at about 8pm or so. 3. This place appeared in GQ - thats how I found about it.  Thats how a lot of people found about it.  Regretably, since they dont have unlimited sitting or unlimitted oven space and materials, they cant service the hordes of people who want to try it. There is a possibility you may not get a pizza the day you want it.  But, that does not mean you have to be a baby and call them sellouts, or be dissappointed.  You know you would be complaning if they decided to expand and no longer put out the quality product they put out today.  Choose your poison. Taking the above items into consideration, you should have a fantastic experience.  I cerrtainly did. (Kitchen effectively closes by 9pm).",0.9911,0.828,0.136,0.037,0.48076388888888894

Wow - what happened to that mid west hospitality I've heard so much about?  Not to mention the fact we aren't locals AND trekked through actual SNOW and Ice to get there.  No, we stayed and ate our pizza.   (Forgot to mention that upon entering the establishment I failed to give the door the obligatory slam, much to the dismay of the woman working there.  She quickly got up and slammed it for me, without so much as a look at me - such passive aggression I haven't seen in quite a while.) The younger guy (who really wanted us to take our pizza elsewhere) had by far the worst attitude.  I mean, really - if you guys are only open for 4 hours could you bother to find someone who isn't totally put out by having to deal with the public?  The guy making the actual pizzas was a bit friendlier - he also seemed to be doing the most work. I found the actual pizza to be ok - no sauce underneath the mushrooms and the cheese seemed to have gone missing.  The ham was so salty I couldn't eat it and had to take it off my slices.  As I ate I had a chance to peruse the rest of the menu - recycling fee for the byob...are you kidding me?  As If I didn't have enough gripes with this place. We left feeling pretty dejected - perhaps we'd been punked?   Overall, not worth the acclaim it has been receiving.  I think this establishment is so full of its own self- righteousness it is going to be hard for it to be successful.  Pretentiousness will get you only so far - I should know - as a full time resident of the land of plastic people.  So what if you can treat the locals well - If you can't put in a solid day of good service to all - regardless of who they are, you shouldn't be selling anything.",0.8674,0.836,0.091,0.074,0.47170526014865644
2010-02-11,2.0,"Wow I was SO disappointed with their pizza.  Extremely pleasantly surprised with the service however.   Lots of bad reviews about that which I found undeserved -- they seemed like generally good people.   Why I didn't like the pizza: 1.  It is NOT like Italian pizza.  Definitely not even trying to be Napoletana which for some reason I expected it to be.  Crust-wise def not even in the vein.  This is my fault for assuming it would be.  I don't doubt they could make it Napoletana but I do not think they want to.  2.  The crust is VERY bready.  It is heavy.  I saw peoples' plates inside and thought they were crazy for leaving so much crust since its my favorite part of good pizza, but I ended up doing the same. 3.  It is EXTRAORDINARILY salty.  Even the biggest salt fiend at my table thought it was overwhelming.  When they put prosciutto on the #2, they didnt compensate by lowering the salt poured on top so it was a true salt fest.   4.  It is just SO, SO, SO, overrated.  Independently every one of the five people I was with said that if they didn't know it was famous they just wouldn't have thought anything and they would have forgotten the place and not gone back. 5.  The tomato sauce is not great.  Actually I don't even remember what it tasted like, probably because the bread (crust) was so overwhelming. 6.  The toppings are not great.  Again very not-Italian in the toppiong setup.  I thought it would be like Napoli in America but that could be my fault for making that assumption.  I just wasnt impressed with the toppings they used.  So, what was good?  It was far more quiet and pleasant than I expected.  The service was fine, I respect the owners and they were nice to us.  My meal was actually for my birthday and it was fun, I had four good friends and a few bottles of wine and it was all good but the pizza just really isn't that great.  I do eat pizza 3 - 5 times a week and have lived off and on in Italy for a long time so I think I know pizza and I just didn't really like theirs.",0.9913,0.74,0.182,0.079,0.5514492753623188
2010-02-08,5.0,"The pizzas are great. Just, awesome. I remember constantly being disappointed when I was in Rome because all the pizza I had there was not as good as at Great Lake (I had the Mortadella and a white pizza covered with crimini mushrooms). Enough people have talked about how good it tastes. I'm not going into that.  Yes, everyone complains about the customer service but I don't see what the big deal is. Sure, there are a lot of hoops to jump through but I couldn't imagine what the crowd would be like if they took phone orders, reservations and didn't become a destination restaurant where you really do have to plan it a few days ahead of time if you want to get in. I got turned away at 6:30pm on a Thursday the first time I tried to go but there are plenty of other restaurants to go to in the area (Anteprima is an excellent alternative: homemade pasta!).  The second time I went, we put down our reservation (went to the delicious Italian bakery just up the street) and came back 15 minutes before they told us we would have a table and had to wait another 30 minutes. The girl at the counter was really nice as we waited. She chatted with us, apologized for the wait and was generally doing everything she could. A woman came in around 7:30 and started screaming when she was told there'd be no chance for a table that night. That sucks but screaming is really not helping anybody. I feel like everyone who says that the customer service is rude acted rudely as well.  As long as the owner alone makes the pies (which I don't mind at all, they're amazing), there's inevitably going to be a slow turnaround. They wouldn't be able to serve more tables if they wanted to. Plus, even if you get turned away, Andersonville is a really great neighborhood with quality food places that aren't featured in GQ (and they are conveniently all located more or less on one road). The Coffee Studio was featured on Bon Appetit as one of its best coffee shops in the nation if you're looking for Conde Nast-approved destinations.  Sure, two hour long waits for food is not ideal in anyone's book but neither is needing to make reservations two months ahead of time. It's a lot of work but for me, it was totally worth it.  Tips:  Get there at 5:00 - 5:30 and budget three hours from walking into the shop to leaving, belly full.  ***Also: They are now open on Tuesdays too.

2010-02-07,5.0,"I tossed and turned last night...having nightmares that we had devoured all of our pizza from Great Lake and the cold leftovers wouldn't be waiting for me in the morning. Indeed, this nightmare was my recent reality. And that's when I was certain I was giving this place 5 stars. I'd been wanting to try this place out for months but the dreaded wait required more strategic planning than I am normally capable of when it comes to eating. But alas, I woman-ed up and planned ahead: we'd get there at 5:30. Put the names in. Expect a long wait. We'd go to a nearby bar. And that's exactly what happened, only, to my delight, our wait on a Saturday night was only 90 minutes. Exactly 90 minutes. So, let's cut to the chase: - who cares about the service. the only thing that had been promised about this place (besides a wait) was the pizza. So, I thought the service was fine. Great.  - salad with mustard vinaigrette: wonderful, light, tasty - dining room area: cute, small, cozy, different   And now, what we've all been waiting for: The Pizza. We split a red herb pizza, I mean, come on...gotta stick to the classic on the first trip here. It was everything I had hoped it would be. Charred crust that, like a newborn baby's first night home, had been tended to beautifully, carefully, thoughtfully. Great tomato sauce. Delicious fresh cheese chunks melted perfectly around the rim of the pizza, carefully toward the center. None of that poor pizza stood a chance at seeing my fridge. (I wish we would have ordered two just to have really overdone it, though one was absolutely the perfect amount for 2 people.) This place is fabulous, and that's not an accolade I throw around casually. Does it top my favorite in the city- Piece? Not totally. It's different so a comparison is not fair but it's certainly the best of its kind I've had in the city. Spacca Napoli doesn't stand a chance against it.

But two days ago, two days ago, a lifetime to milliseconds, I was able to sink my canines into its flesh.   I called at 8.30 pm.  I didn't hold out for hope too much.  I asked what was the earliest I could pick up the pizza.  The lady who I was talking with was nice, she was cordial, there wasn't a trace of rudeness.  She said 9pm and said that they have new pizzas out.  She proceeded to give me all three choices.   Both the first and third sounded like what I have been waiting months for and decided that the cayenne pepper was the tipping point.  This was the pizza: ""Spinach, Cream (Farm fresh), Mona aged (Sheep/Cow) cheese and cayenne pepper"" at 8.55, I rush out, with my fluffy jacket and boots to combat all weather emergencies.  Nothing was going to stand in my way.  I got there at 9pm and the pizza was still cooking.  5 minutes later, the pizza breeched the cool air in the store.  My credit card sliced the machine, my transaction was complete.  I rushed out, trying to get back home as fast as the cold air sucked all life out of every living being. I came home, Pizza was on the verge of death.  I put him into the warm oven.  A few minutes later, my taste buds were in for a surprise.  It was everything I expected.

2010-01-25,5.0,"Well, it is officially official, Great Lake dishes out the BEST, that's right, BEST, thin crust pizza in Chicago. Now, there are a couple of caveats that need to be mentioned. First, if you are unwilling to try what may be considered an ""odd"" pizza due to its ingredient combinations, I might avoid Great Lake. Second, if you have a group larger than 10 people, and/or do not like to wait, I would again recommend avoiding Great Lake. However, if neither of those two issues affects you, go try Great Lake ASAP! I went this past Saturday with my girlfriend, aunt, and uncle. We arrive around 5:10pm and were the first in line for the ONLY table... it was a one hour wait. This wasn't a big deal as we had expected a wait, so we headed down the street to Hop Leaf for a few beers to kill the time. Just about an hour later our cell phone rang and our table was ready. We sat down and decided to skip over the appetizers in an attempt to preserve our appetites for the pizza. It is worth mentioning that the Squash Soup looked very good, and their House Salad looked outstanding. After gazing over our three pizza choices, I was a little disappointed to learn their menu changes quite frequently, and consequently, their award winning pizza was not an option. Thankfully, this turned out to be a non-issue, because our selections were unbelievably good. We ordered two #1's, which was a Tomato, Fresh Mozzarella, Mona, and Fresh Herb Pizza. The #1 would definitely be the go-to choice for the pizza traditionalists, but again, I would recommend thinking outside the box. We also ordered a #2, which was a Cremini Mushroom, Mona, and Black Pepper Pizza. We were lucky enough to be seated next to two regulars, and they were friendly/generous enough to share of their #3 (Chorizo, Onion, Fresh Cream, and Mona) pizza with us. Initially, we were reluctant to try their food, because it was THEIR food, but they assured us this was the type of atmosphere Great Lake is all about and we were convinced when another couple arrived that were good friends with the two girls at our table and their relationship began from a prior meal at Great Lake. Anyway, all three pizza choices were amazing... and I wish we had ordered an additional #2 (actually, we tried, but we would have to had wait almost 2 hours for it). Another great aspect of Great Lake is the BYOB... I think it is $3 per bottle of wine. Overall, words cannot due justice to Great Lake, from the crust, to the combination of ingredients, everything at Great Lake is amazingly fresh and perfectly made. I will be returning to Great Lake very, very soon, and if you are a Chicago native, you'd be insane no to give Great Lake a try!",0.9986,0.739,0.219,0.042,0.49236375661375664

If the people before you leave something that looks like a Swiss army knife on the table, don't shout after them, ""Wait! You forgot your knife!"". I did that. It is actually a corkscrew because place is BYOB. The other patrons in the tiny establishment looked at me and all I could say was ""Oh..duh."" Back to the food. I was only going to give them 4 stars because I thought the pizza was a little salty and not enough cheese. But then with the guy not caring about our crappy tip and me eating onions and not hating them, and wanting another piece as soon as I got home...I knew Great Lake pizza deserves all the stars. I don't eat onions, I will even pick them out of spaghetti sauce. But on my companions pizza I could totally tolerate. This is a sign of a good chef. The companion got a pizza with chorizo and some kind of cream and onions. I got cheese (mona, I think), mushrooms (cremini) and garlic. Yeah. It was great.

The loss of two stars isn't because of the standard complaints about the wait or the rudeness. My wait wasn't long and the service was good. It was the pizza. Maybe it was an ""off"" night, but my boyfriend and I ordered the number 2 (with seasonal squash now instead of the mushrooms per usual). We found that the pizza was lacking in flavor (besides the herbs) -- including the squash flavor, which should have been front and center. The crust was of course amazing, but with the paper-thin squash and hardly any cheese (really it could have been a cheeseless pizza and I hardly would have noticed), the flavors didn't shine. I hate to say it, but from my experience here, it was not worth the hype. I won't be in any rush to return.",0.8556,0.848,0.097,0.055,0.46666666666666673

We got some awesome tomato and basil thing with garlic, and it was...well, ridiculous. My quest for really good pizza sauce has never yielded something so spot-on. Theirs is just a little bit spicy and salty and tomato-y and OH MAN, the GARLIC. IN any case, we were reeeeally happy with our pizza. We ate the entire thing in about five minutes. I was there on a pretty slow night (there were seats available!), but I thought the service was just fine and the owner and cashier very friendly.

2009-11-20,2.0,"Yes-  the Alan Richman GQ article made me curious. I have been waiting months to finally experience the supposed Holy Grail of pizza that is Great Lake. Let me first say I was taken by the charm of this simplistic small spot that you would think would be off a roadside in  some small rural area. The charm was certainly there. Although, like a superhyped movie you heard was a ""not to miss"" my expectations were built -the stage was set- could Great Lake REALLY be all that it has been pumped up to be? Let me first say I wanted to like this place I really did. I respect the owners for having a passion for their pizza and for using locally grown fresh ingredients. I get that. I admire that. But as you may have heard or read in the many well written reviews there is a disconnect here. I'll explain- Inviting people into your creation your ""dining room"" so to speak is serious business. You are essentially asking someone to fork over the hard earned cash (especially now) for a pleasant food experience which does not limit itself to supplying just a good pizza. Its a package experience that I believe if I pay good money for I hope the proprietor agrees with this ideal. The experience we had yesterday evening was awkward. There were no friendly greetings no smiles nothing that would welcome you and get you excited for what you were about to eat. After all you are at Great Lake! Now, instead you are like saying to yourself-""Self what have I done already to illicit such an ice cold greeting?? I am a friendly gal with a great big heartwarming smile! Then you talk your self down and say ""I am an informed yelp consumer I knew that this was going to be like this so lets move on and just eat some good pizza"".  We ordered their Tomato basil and also their Cremini pizza. We made friends with a man whom swapped a slice of his chorizo pizza for our Tomato basil. We thought the ingredients were fresh and tasty. However the crust was bland cooked at some points and soggy in others. I think since we were there before 5 and the first people to order I suspect the oven was not hot enough yet. Anyhow during our experience I had showed a video clip on my Blackberry to my friend and yes you could here the sound a bit anyhow the owner came from behind the counter to tell her to turn it off in the rudest of ways. Yes I understand people have strong feelings about cell phone usage so my bad on this one. But it was just the way it was said to a grown woman. My friend felt awful and I felt awful for her. Soon after another friend joined us and I moved a bench about 6 inches over to our table and gave my friend her chair. The wife stormed over and said ""We have a way of doing things here"" abruptly moved the bench I moved back 6 whole inches and let us wait til she retrieved a folding chair. Well I thought yes you do have a way of doing things here now don't you? At the end of my meal I paid the $60 tab (incl tip for both Pizzas) and actually received a smile from the owner while he was in mid pizza creation and I thought he cant be a bad guy does he get whats not right here? Does he care? As I contemplated that small glitter of almost hospitality I proceeded to thank his wife. Her response was ""SURE"". SURE! SURE?? No my pleasure- thank you- please come again??? No none of that. So in conclusion I prefer not to tell readers of my reviews to avoid places as you dont want to rob someone of an experience that could otherwise be different for them BUT you want to inform then to prepare them. Will I go back to Great Lake.. Sure....NOT.  My suggestion is travel South on Clark to the new Nella Napoletana (see review) or try Trattoria D.O.C. in Evanston for a much better pizza and better service.  Gosh I really wanted to like this place.....",0.9975,0.789,0.171,0.04,0.5558543860782666

2009-10-11,4.0,"Soo fantastic. $20 pizzas, $10 salads, corking fees of $3 for bottle of wine/$1 for 16 ounce beers (and if you are feeling brave, remind the proprietors that corking fees are illegal unless they have a liquor license, but I wouldn't because then they might take your pizza privileges away). We were seated immediately at around 5:20 on a Friday evening, so it was not the horrendous wait we were expecting. Great neighborhood, so if there is a wait you can traipse over to In Fine Spirits around the corner on Clark.  First, the food. M and I started with the salad, which sounds boring but was actually very delicious. It comes with a selection of sliced and diced in-season vegetables, including amazingly flavorful green tomatoes with a delightful mustard vinaigrette (there is another choice of dressing, a house-made ranch or something). A great starter to whet your appetite for the fresh ingredients on the pizza.  The pizza comes fresh from the oven, apparently always handmade from crust to toppings by the proprietor. It is well worth the wait, about 40 minutes (though we did get the salad after 20 minutes). There are three choices of pizza, and they all looked delicious--we had the #1. I can't remember all of the ingredients, I just remember a wonderful salty tomatoey fresh mozzarella-ey experience on a paper thin crust. We finished things off with ice cream, which was good, but next time I'll just get my ice cream kicks at one of the many desert places on Clark that are open late and offer more flavor selections. So, the food is great. What about everything else? The interior is very small, and sparse, with spartan shelves filled with a few foodstuffs and a table for six and a table for two. We didn't have to wait for a seat, but we were seated at the communal table. As I'm sure everyone knows, there are some risks to the trendy communal dining trend, and we were victims of this well-intentioned setting.  So, if you walk into Great Lake and someone tries to steal your spot, they're probably a bad person and you should take your pizza to-go instead of sitting down with them for a 40 minute wait and devouring of delicious pizza.

I went with a couple friends on a Wednesday evening around 6:30pm...the tables were all full at the time, so they took my cell number and gave me a call around 7:10 when they had something for us--which allowed us time to get a pre-dinner snack from Swedish Bakery and visit Jewel for the restroom (since the restaurant doesn't have one--be forewarned: dry/salty pizza + lots of water = restroom break!) and was so much better than one of those buzzing pagers. Placed our order--one of the standard #1 tomato/mozzarella/fresh herb pizzas and a #3, which that night had Italian sausage and matchstick peppers--and then waited about 45 minutes for the pizza. Again, since we'd stopped by Swedish, we were A-OK on the wait--that's definitely not my complaint here. My real complaint was with the crust. For me, pizza is mostly about the bread...and theirs was dry, bland, and too charred for my taste. Granted, I thought the taste of the middle portion on the #1 was excellent--unique, salty flavor--but since the crust was always the last bit I tasted in each slice, it really had me disappointed. My friends started skipping the crusts as we continued eating, which was probably a good idea--but if I'm going to order pizza, especially one that costs $20+ each, I'd like to be able to eat the whole thing. I get that some folks love a dry, charred crust--especially as evidenced by all those who stopped in to get pizza to go (seemed like ""regulars"")--but for my money, I'll always prefer Spacca Napoli's flavorful, chewy crust with just a hint of charred goodness and the freshest of toppings. Because of the GQ review, I think everyone should give this place a try--supposedly ""best pizza in America"" and all--but bring snacks, be prepared for a wait, don't go with too high expectations, and don't even think about taking a picture of anything but YOUR pizza b/c the owner will call you out in front of the entire restaurant and shame you for wanting to snap photos of the inside of their establishment (as he did me).",0.9944,0.81,0.157,0.032,0.4477777777777777

Just as a public service announcement I think it is important to note: the people that work here act weird, there is no music to drown out the uncomfortableness, no one seems happy and even the smoothest of customers get nervous here.  In short: get your pizza to go!!!! Here was my plan: this little (read: tiny!) pizza place opens at 5:30pm.  So, I thought in order to secure a table that getting there at 5:20pm we might be the first ones in line.  Nope!  There were a good 15 people in front of us.  So then, by the time we got up to the counter all the inside & outside tables had been taken.... We proceed to order and the guy behind the counter says, ""Okay, well, you can have a seat at this table here.""  It was a 6-top and there were 4 people at the table already.  Those 4 people looked at me and my husband like, ""oh hellllllz no, you aren't gonna sit here at the same table with us, are you?""  I turn to the worker at the counter and say, ""Um, that's okay, there are people sitting there, I think we'll just get the pizza to go.""  At which point, the counter guy leans closer to me, yet raises his voice and says, ""It's a communal table!""  I just started laughing b/c I was so nervous.... So then, once we decided that we were ""carryout"" people, the counter guy told us the pizza would be ready at 6:15pm.  We did what alot of other reviewers did and hung out around Andersonville until time to pick up the pizza.  If nothing else, the long waits for the pizza enables everyone to see what an awesome neighborhood Andersonville is! Yet another awkward encounter as I picked up the pizza and the counter guy said, ""Enjoy your pizza.""  But not in a normal way.  It was very sinister, like, ""I f-ing DARE you to enjoy your pizza, buddy.""  It was so weird that everyone in the restaurant turned to look at this lovely exchange between me, the counter guy, and my pizza.  Those poor ""dine-in"" customers looked miserable too: cramped, listening to the sound of the workers making the pizza...everyone just staring at one another.  Yikes.  I'm glad I got the pizza to-go. But for the pizza, it was good.  I'm not sure if I agree with GQ magazine, but the pizza was good and the crust is spectactular.  You can tell all the ingredients are locally grown...the tomatoes were extremely fresh and bonus points for using red + yellow tomatoes.  Perhaps the best part is the generous use of olive oil to make the pizza very moist.

After hearing about all the rave reviews about how fantastic the pizza is, I decided to give it a try.  After reading about the wait times, I developed a contingency plan.   I went in on a Wednesday night, with the expectation that there would be a wait, and we would walk over to Hopleaf and have a few beers while waiting for our table. When we walked in... nothing.  After standing there for a minute wondering why nobody was saying hi, I looked at my date and leaned over the counter.  I heard one guy (who appparently was the owner, Nick Lessins) say to another worker, ""Yea, normally douche bags are huge a-holes.""  Clearly a conversation that was much more important than us silly ""customers."" When I finally got the attention of a female employee, it did not get any better.  At 7:15, she informed us that it would be a two hour wait for a table. ""Oh, did you want to carry out?  Our next carry out time is 9:30.""  The one nice thing is that they will call you when your table is ready, so we went for a few drinks. When we came back, I had to get the employee's attention again.  Now, even though we had just walked in, she asked us if we were ready to order, then giggled at us when we said we were not.  While looking at the menu, my date asked if we could add pepperoni to one of the pizzas.  It was on another pizza, so they obviously had it.  But no, the employee just giggled.  Seriously.  She did not say a word, but her giggle was enough to let us know no modifications or additions were possible.   We ended up ordering a zucchini and pepperoni pizza, and it was phenomenal.  Nick has developed some sort of Rain Man ability to create these works of art.  Drizzled with olive oil, with sea salt and pepper to add seasoning, with crust of perfect thickness and crispiness, the little things really make the difference.  Having fresh, local ingredients helps a lot too. Ultimately, I cannot really recommend this because a fair amount of a restaurant experience is how you are treated while you were there.  When someone gleefully shits in your mouth, you are less inclined to go back.   Maybe carry out would be better, but I see that people have had nightmares with that too.  Even if the pizza is not quite as good, there are quite a few really good pizza places in Chicago (Bricks, Coalfire, Sapori di Napoli, hell, even Homemade Pizza Co.) where they treat you so much better.

2009-07-31,5.0,"For the record. I am not from the neighborhood, don't know the owners and live 800 miles away. Also before I begin I truly believe any discussion regarding ""best"" pizza is usually pointless. It is one of those food items people grown up with and hold dear to their heart. Needless to say opinions vary wildly. Personally I am very open to different styles of pizza and ""all food"", from Pizzeria Bianco to Di Fara. From Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven to DeLorenzo's in Trenton. I tried them all and comparisons are subjective to personal taste as they are very different styles all holding the title of pizza. My personal favorites are Great Lake and Pizzeria Bianco. But more than anything I wish to address some of what I believe is misinformed information posted here. 1. Alan Richman review. I don't agree with all his opinions. But he is a nationally known critic and would have never gotten to that position if he recklessly gave such unworthy praise. 2. Great Lake owners are making a giant buck off customers since the article. Please!! They have never altered their original concept and many pizzeria owners would have jumped at the opportunity to do so. Like adding a larger deck oven and hired minimum wage kids to pump out the pies from noon to midnight. Of course quality would tank quickly but that would be riding the publicity wave to the bank as long as possible. They did not, and I admire them greatly for it. 3. Criticizing everything from water cups to the space being taken by the products they sell. Those items are an expression of the owners, and their dream. It adds personality, and soul to their business. Rare among the many soulless profit focused corporate restaurants out there. I love and appreciate their eye for detail and uniqueness. 4. All the suggestions on how to improve and make service faster. Have those people ever worked in the restaurant industry? I have and at some of the very best restaurants in the country. And truth is due to space constriction limit's and the very nature of the product they are making I doubt much can be improved upon without jeopardizing quality. It will never be Pizza Hut and I doubt they want it to be. 5. And likely the most uninformed unrealistic preconceived notion for last. It's only pizza, should be fast, how hard to make.Truth is it may be the very hardest product to make with consistent quality. Don't listen to me but do the math yourself. Thousands of pizzerias in the country and only a dozen or so truly great. Like a mass market of hot house tomatoes in our supermarkets and a generation of people with no idea what a vine ripened tomato taste like. Great Lake's dough is not out of Food and Wine magazine, it can't be made in a few hours like done so at home or most pizzerias. It takes time and attention to detail. No less so then the kitchen staff do at the French Laundry. If yelp is a place to share opinions then this is mine. All restaurants have bad days, I grant that. But I tend to think many people are walking into Great Lake with preconceived ideas of pizza and maybe even a poor attitude before they even walk in. The owners recognise it as what it is( People thinking they have all the knowledge) and it leads to tension and a poor experience all around. It's human nature! My advice. With no time limitations and a open mind visit Great Lake. Bring a bottle of wine sit back and let Nick and Lydia do what they do best. You will not only be rewarded with great pizza but one of the best casual meals ever. But the key is keeping an open mind and positive attitude.",0.9978,0.762,0.169,0.068,0.5555208333333335

2009-07-31,1.0,"Let me start by saying that I've never Yelped before.  Let me also say that my sole purpose of joining Yelp was to tell the rest of the world currently contemplating a visit to Great Lake NOT TO BELIEVE THE HYPE.  This place is possibly the MOST overrated restaurant I have ever been to.  And I was so excited after having read the review in GQ or Esquire (don't remember which).  Malnati's or Giordano's has better pizza than this place.  And if thin crust is your bag, go to Spacca Napoli, a much friendlier environment where they actually recognize that YOU are the customer.  They like to give out tasty snacks for those that are waiting; at Great Lake the best you can expect is a health dose of attitude.  And nevermind the fact that the pizza is simply better at Spacca Napoli, too.          Generally in writing reviews I don't take one star lightly.  So let me explain.  Yes, we waited, for forty minutes before the meal.  Not a problem and to be expected with a popular restaurant with national press.  (As an aside, I lived in New York for four years, so I'm accustomed to waiting for brick oven pizza and the like, i.e., John's, Grimaldi's, Lombardi's...and please note that I'm a Philly guy so I'm not trying to turn this into a Chicago-New York pizza battle royale).  My issue with waiting was the forty minutes between pies 2 and 3.  Yes, clearly they put a great deal of care into the pizza.  However, we're talking about pizza here people!!!  This is not rocket science!!!  And at over $20 a pop, once I'm seated I want my food relatively quickly...ESPECIALLY if it's pizza.  Even after the forty minute wait dinner took an hour and fifty minutes for four people.  (Remember, this place is BYOB).   Service is non-existent.  Except for delivery of the tardy pies to your table, you're hard pressed to get a server.  If you're outside (which we were) forget about it.   This place is NOT kid friendly. Our friends received a stiff lecture on how we needed to position the stroller when sitting.  It was suggested that our female friend keep their child on the lap for the ENTIRE meal.  Remember, this was a close to two hour meal.  Who wants to keep one-year-old on  their lap for two hours?   As for the food - below average for a town that prides itself on pizza.  Admittedly the Margherita-style pie was solid.  Good crust, good texture, good cheese-to-sauce ratio. Pie 2 was below average, and Pie 3 was actually pretty bad.  But for the fact that I was carb loading for a long run in the morning (and famished from the wait between pizzas), I would not have finished my share.  I don't remember exact menu names, but pie 2 was some sort of shredded zuchinni pie.  Not enough cheese and kind of bland.  Pie 3, the ""meat"" pie on tonight's menu, used some sort of smoked pancetta.  The smokey flavor was so overpowering it was kind of gross.  I'm not a picky eater, man, I'll eat anything.  But this was pretty nasty.     If you're looking for a romantic date night or a quick pizza, this is not your place.

But the problem is that, given their size and lack of service, the restaurant is really just a waiting room. No wonder they sell cards. Here's how to survive a trip to Great Lake: Treat it like a picnic for grown ups (the gargantuan wait-times and lack of apps make it a poor choice for families). Bring a board game or your own set of cards. Bring your own drinks.

Bring your own appetizers. Their salads are horridly overpriced and comically small. And share your food. If the staff won't contribute to a communal environment, you can bring it with. Trust me, this will make you the most loved group there. The reward is the pizza, which remains as good as it was when we first went here over a year ago before this GQ madness. You will taste *every* ingredient in the pizza, and if you do as I recommend, you won't be miserable by the time it comes!

However I do mind when it is crowded but the staff behind the counter is all standing around, literally, doing nothing while the cashier is looking past me at the line forming behind me and the large group gathering outside and lazily says ""Okay, I'm not seating or serving them"" then proceeds to gape past me as if I am not standing there excited to hand her my money! Um, do you want my business? Hmm.... not a good start. 2. Tiny menu, but that's okay! That must mean that they specialize in their 3 pizzas.  We decided on the basic red sauce, cheese and mushroom.

If a restaurant gets a review in a national magazine, don't show up two hours after they open and expect to eat anything. Period.  If you show up any time after opening, you should be flippin' GRATEFUL to get a morsel of food. When a restaurant hits the big time, plan for a wait. And give the staff some slack- this is a family running things. A few normal people that just happened to hit it big. They are doing the best they can to meet demand, but they got thrown into the deep end with that review. They just wanted to sell a few pizzas, scrape out a living, and now they are dealing with all you arrogant MF-ers expecting them to work 24 hours a day so you can have a pizza. I used to own a floral shop, and all I have to say is f*** you. If you came into my shop a 5:59pm on Valentines day and expected me to have a dozen fresh red roses for $10 in a vase for you, I would laugh in your face. If you argued with me or gave me attitude, I'd tell you to go get your roses from Jewel. That's what you should expect if you show up late at Great Lake. Get there early and wait with us peasants. Support  a family's dream, support small farms, support your community. As for the food- my BF and I have been trying all the ""best"" pizza in the region, and nothing can compare to Great Lake. Our hour wait was nothing (especially when compared to the wait at Hot Doug's or Kuma's). The crust was buttery, crisp, flavorful. Not doughy/bready, not crackery. This is a mutant crust that has evolved from all the others, and it will take over the world. We sat at the counter side table and watched as the chef thoughtfully and precisely laid each ingredient on the pizza. It took a hour from the time we sat until the time we ate, but once we had our first bite we realized the secret.... Love. The precious time given to the creation of each pizza makes each on a work of culinary art. The staff was polite even though they were harried, and bless their hearts for running a small business in this economic climate. I wish them well. In conclusion. Suck it up and wait in line.

2009-07-13,5.0,"Agreed with Jake C. Seriously, it's like people don't understand they have ONE OVEN that can cook two pizzas at once.  They walk in and see there is room for one person to make pizza and one oven, and seating for 16 - and then they expect a place that just got national notoriety to magically be mass producing pizzas.  That's not what the place is.  It never was, and just because it's now recognized as being great (and nearly all the reviews say the food is great, even when they give it two stars), it's supposed to now have Pizza Hut throughput. There are hours posted.  The place is the size of a shoebox.  You really need to do the math and realize it's a tough ticket right now.  ""The pizza is amazing, BUT I HAVE TO WAIT FOREVER!  1 STAR!""  Well, no sh*t.  You are going there.  Other people have the same idea as you.  It's only so big, and only so much staff and oven space.  Hot Doug's is just as crazy, but dogs and brats take less time to cook so no one complains about standing in line for an hour for a dog on a bun.  If you want a pizza, get there by 6.  If you don't, that is your own fault.  You know it's going to be a long wait and they try to close by 9:30.  If you're getting there at 7 you're kidding yourself. Those talking about attitudes might need to get their own checked.  I've been around Lydia and Nick a lot, and they are wonderful people.  Very nice and welcoming.  After an entire night of people complaining about not enough tables and wait times (which they themselves are contributing to), you might be a little testy too.  What do you people suggest?  They're not going to expand, this is their pet project to enjoy themselves and make great pizza. They aren't taking call-in orders right now because A) they don't have enough oven space for all the in-store customers as it is and B) if they do that, everyone will do that, and they'll just have an empty store front.  Which gives bad perception.  So, deal with it or go home and leave the place to the people who appreciate it.  Those saying they won't make it, you're insane - ""they're too busy to serve everyone, but they'll go out of business"".  Huh?  Does not compute.  They were doing fine and dandy before GQ, and they'll do fine once the rubberneckers are gone too.",0.9531,0.827,0.103,0.07,0.6230489417989418

I can't imagine they will stay in business after the hubbub dies down. Which is a shame, because they actually do make a pretty good pizza...

2009-06-27,5.0,"Ok people, take a deep breath and relax. After all, it is just pizza! I think Great Lake serves the best pizza in Chicago. Other places are better restaurants, i.e. Spacca Napoli, for the overall experience, but Great Lake definitely serves the best pizza. It is homemade perfection with unbelieveable crust and some of the most unique and flavorfull topping combinations I have ever seen. That being said, I understand why alot of you are frustrated. Great Lake is not a restaurant designed for crowds. They hand make everything: the dough, the cheese and each pizza are handcrafted. So it takes time and when they run out of dough for the day they can't make anymore. So, here are some pointers to maximize your Great Lake experience: 1. Get there as early as possible and put your name on the list. On Saturdays a line normally starts around 5pm. Do not come in an hour before closing and expect to get a table, or even a pizza. 2. Be prepared to wait. If you have to wait for a table head to one of the many bars in the area (In Fine Spirits or the Hopleaf are my favorites) and they will call you when a table is ready.  3. Order quickly, the menu is on the board and you can decide while you wait! (p.s. They are all delicious) 4. If you are eating inside grab a bottle of wine at In Fine Spirits and bring it with you, you are going to have to wait some more once you sit. Otherwise bring a deck of cards or a magazine or even strike up a conversation with the table next to you. 5. Courtesy and politeness go a long way here. The owners of Great Lake did not start a tiny, artisnal pizza place in Chicago's most low key neighborhood because they wanted to be millionaires. So just because you drove in from Naperville for a pizza doesn't mean you are going to get one.

2009-06-01,2.0,"My friend and I have been trying to make it to this place before they close for weeks. Being open 20 hours M - F sucks! Then we made it one day at 8:30 and they wouldn't seat us because they closed at 9. WTF!!! You're open from 5 - 9 and you won't seat a table at 8:30? They wouldn't even make it ""to go"" and suggested we come back and try again. The tables weren't full. With such a small window, they should specify that their last orders are taken at 8:10. We have been so intrigued and yet so disappointed several times that I believe it will be one f'ing hell of a pizza to get me to try going back again. I doubt it's THAT good. When we left empty-bellied with the scent of fresh basil and oregano filling our noses we were so disappointed. They must make too much money to want our measly little business. I guess that's good for them and good for Pizzaria Aroma, which is where we ended up (see my reviews on Aroma).",-0.8953,0.803,0.079,0.118,0.42196969696969694

2009-05-30,5.0,"Oh, this is good pizza.  These guys seem to specialize in sauce-less pizzas.   I have had two of their six or so pizzas, the crimini w/smoked gouda and the one with soppresetta.  Both were great.  The crimini went really well with a Saumur-Champigny (cabernet franc-Loire Valley) from In Fine Spirts around the corner on clark.  The soppresetta went really well with a Saumur rose from Fine Wines on Lincoln.   One might think that the soppresetta would have made the pizza greasy but it didnt.  They put it on the pizza only after it is out of the oven.  That way the soppresetta actually wilts on top due to the residual heat.   They also make an onion and bacon pizza.  The onions are slightly sauteed and the bacon is really smokey.  About half way through wolfing it down I realized that this pizza had a lot in common with an Alsatian flatbread topped with lardons and onions called Flammenkuche.  This is classically paired with a dry Alsatian white wine like a riesling, gewurztraminer or sylvaner. fr.wikipedia.or ... One thing that I judge a pizza by is the crust.  And this pizzaria's crust is really tasty.  Just take a bite out of the crust w/o ingredients and you can judge for yourself. The place is small, only one table and byob.  I just call ahead for pick up and take it home.  You can see the chef at work and how seriously he takes his job.  That is great to see. They do sell some seemlingly random items on some shelves on one side of the restaurant.  Why?  I have no idea.  Not all of it is actually Italian.  They should chuck that and make more room for sitting customers.  As of May 2009, due to increased demand for their great pizzas,  they have stopped taking phone orders which is what I always do.  They only accept walk-in orders now.  I dont know what I would have done in their place but it sure makes it harder for loyal customers to buy their pizzas.",0.9844,0.862,0.113,0.025,0.46851851851851856

2009-05-25,3.0,"I enthusiastically gave these guys a couple tries when they first opened, and I cannot argue: the pizza is delicious.  Three solid stars. One star off for covering up the baseball-sized char hole in the middle of my pizza with arugula, and pretending I wouldn't notice.   Another star off for poor customer service.  The owners did not seem the least bit interested in having me as a customer.  No friendliness, no energy - I didn't even get an apology for having to wait around 35 minutes longer than quoted over the phone.  What a ridiculous waste of my time; I haven't been back since. I've since moved on - to Apart Pizza.  No frills, delicious thin crust at a reasonable price, and always ready when I arrive.  (It matters when you're trying to get home before the game starts!)",0.8985,0.713,0.189,0.098,0.48020833333333335

The price is really high for a pie and my partner and I felt like we could truly make this at home.  Yes, the ingredients were really fresh but the combinations were nothing to warrant such a rave.   Also, there is no menu online and they had no menus to take home in the store.  How am I supposed to be a returning customer not knowing what to order especially when asked if I can add an ingerdient the answer is ""no"".

2008-07-18,3.0,"We ordered from here once and we were some what pleased. When we walked in we did get the death stare from a couple sitting at the communal table.  Sorry folks, it seats 8 not 2.  We were not staying any way but nothing says welcome like they did. We reviewed the pizza selections written on the board and decided on one we both would enjoy.  Not that I was expecting a ray of sunshine for service but we pretty much got the ""what do you want"" look.  One thing about Andersonville is that people know each other and in order to keep the corporate places out many stores there rely on personality, disinterested isn't a positive experience. The pizza was ok, I didn't drool or fall over for another piece.  The toppings didn't seem to be dispersed over the pizza and mostly what I was tasting was the crust.  Maybe that is how the pizza was supposed to be but I would think if you are charging me for ""high-end"" ingredients then I should be able to taste them. $22 for a pizza of that size is a little to much.  Sure the pizza is made right there with fresh ingredients but when did fresh become expensive. As for the other products that are sold there, I didn't see anything that couldn't be purchased elsewhere and with out the mark up. I'm sure we will be back but it isn't the first place we think of nor will I go out of our way for it.",0.9526,0.839,0.112,0.049,0.5594469540121715
2008-07-12,3.0,"It is nice to have fresh pizzas I agree.  HOWEVER I have been to Italy, and all of the fancy Italian places sell Diet Coke.  Service is what happens when the customer gets what he wants without a hassle.  There is no beverages other than high calorie lemonade in a can and water.  I had to walk to the corner store to buy a diet coke.  So just because people like organic doesn't mean traditional WORLD beverages are something of the past.   Also the bathroom is in the back so you have to walk through the kitchen which feels uber tacky to me.   In Italy and America every fine dining restaurant I would think of going to has a full expresso bar... what gives with Great Lake?   Finally, I think $22.00 pizza (that isn't even organic whole wheat) is a bit pricey and it is BYOB for the ONE table inside.   I will go back but this new operation needs some serious refinement for people of a higher caliber of service when dining.",0.714,0.916,0.066,0.018,0.4749322169059011

I live three doors down, too (hmm) which, i think, is the only way you could know about this place.
