2014-06-21,4.0,"4 Stars for The Bluebird. I was having dinner with a couple of friends and one lives near The Bluebird. After I shared my craving for mussels with her she led us to The Bluebird and we had a fantastic meal.  We started out with two heaping bowls of mussels. We opted for the cider and southern French, both were delicious but the real winner for me were the cider mussels. The combination of cider with bacon, onion, and curry powder was divine. We had to ask for more bread just to sop up the amazing broth. The belgian frites they serve with the mussels are also amazing. Perfectly cooked and well complemented by the delicious aioli they were accompanied by. We also finished our meal up with the cauliflower which was good but unimpressive, especially compared with how much we loved the mussels.  Service and ambiance at The Bluebird are also spot on. I love how the restaurant is darkly lit and the tables are spread far enough apart so people are not cramped and on top of each other. The whole wait staff was equally impressive and the chef was even kind enough to stop by our table twice throughout the meal. The Bluebird is a hidden gem on Damen and definitely worth checking out.",0.9972,0.701,0.277,0.022,0.6118589743589744

Almost finished with dinner...would love another cocktail, except our server was no where to be found! Server visit #2: Dinner is done.  We are over it.  She finally shows up and at this point we just want to leave and ask for our check.

They have an EXTENSIVE craft beer selection, so if you're a beer aficionado, you can put The Bluebird on your ""I Want To Go To There"" list.  That being said, the prices for beer are a bit too high.  I noticed certain beers priced at $13 when I can get them for $8 at other bars.  Their cocktail list looked good, and the cocktails are cheaper than most of the beers! The food was alright.  My friend and I split some fries.  He ordered the Cider Braised Berkshire Pork Cheeks with celery root & kohlrabi remoulade.  We both thought it was good, but not great.  The pork cheek was tender and juicy, but not overall flavorful. The celery root & kohlrabi remoulade was bland. I ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with rabbit and pickled guajillo.  That was very flavorful, and my friend and I both really enjoyed it.  I definitely recommend the sweet potato gnocchi!

Overall it is light on seating but rich in atmosphere.  Exposed brick, dim lights, a rustic elegance that makes you feel like you're in a French bistro or something.  It is casual, but you would definitely feel at home if you were a bit dressed up too.  Come as you are, and eat tasty things. I ordered a glass of wine from the bar, then got another after we sat down.  $12 glass of lovely sweet German riesling.  It is quite sweet, which I like, but those who prefer dry whites should steer clear.  I thought it was lovely!  My friend and I shared the pan-roasted brussels sprouts which were absolutely delicious and served with a creamy aioli, then we devoured a generous pot of Southern French mussels with fennel, wine, and chiles.  Some crispy, salty, hot frites were served alongside with another tangy aioli.  Everything was wonderful.  Even the bread they brought us to dip into the broth was beautifully toasted but still a bit soft toward the center.  The broth in the mussels was some of the most flavorful I've had, and the flavor really carried through to the mussels.  How many times have I had a bowl of mussels where the taste of the broth didn't get picked up by the seafood at all?  I don't know how they did it but every bite was infused with great flavor.  This would make a meal for 1, but is great to split amongst 2 with another small plate (or a few).  Filling and fresh, I think this huge bowl of mussels (with tons of extra broth) was only $15.  Really you can eat quite inexpensively here with lovely food. Perfect for a date night, or splitting a few dishes with friends over bottles of wine.  And you can probably get in without a reservation so it's perfect for last minute nights out!  I'm so glad we came here, and I hope I get to come back soon.",0.9991,0.731,0.263,0.007,0.4900419287211741

Any meat that comes in small pieces and tossed in pasta screams boring and not thought through in my book.

I got to try some asparagus off of someone's plate. The shining star was the mac n cheese. It was incredible! The frites were nothing special and the brussel sprouts were w-a-a-a-y too salty. The asparagus was tasty. My Bourbon-based cocktails were okay. One of them was w-a-a-a-y too citrusy. It seemed as if the food was served to share but there were no serving utensils provided with the dishes. I felt kind of awkward helping myself to mac n cheese with my own fork - especially after it was already in my mouth. Our server was perfectly friendly and adequate. There wasn't anything very special about the service. Although we ordered everything at once, there were some noticeable breaks between some of the dishes. It is fine to space things out, but that was a little too spaced. I don't think I'd go back to Bluebird unless 1) my friends wanted to go there again, or 2) I happened to be in the area. It's just not that special to justify another visit.",0.9751,0.813,0.135,0.052,0.6578157349896481

Both visits have been about the wine, and there are plenty of options to choose from.   There are bottles in all price ranges, and the by-the-glass options are fairly broad too.  Wednesdays are half priced sparkling bottles which is a special after my own heart.  We shared two bottles of a Michigan sparkling wine that was just so smooth and tasty.  If wine isn't your thing, there is also a large craft beer and cocktail list. Regarding food, I really enjoyed the brussel sprouts.  The french mussels we had were absolutely to die for.  Less impressive to me were the paprika-orange wings and the cheese plate.  I wasn't aware that the cheeses were listed on the wall, so when the plate was set before us, I expected a 'tour' of the board and didn't get one.  Sad, but next time I'll check out the cheese wall!

The food was just decent, but my steak wasn't medium rare and they forgot the chimichurri, gave us a pretty bad attitude when we asked about splitting checks for a table of two, which I understand the policy but the attitude wasn't necessary. I would have rated three stars, but when we noticed that our change was $10 short, we asked the server who replied ""Did I keep an extra $10? I wasn't sure"".

2013-06-18,3.0,"Four of us had dinner there last Saturday night at 7 PM.  There was no need for the reservation three weeks in advance.  As we walked in, there was a sign saying, ""seat yourself.""  It was mostly empty, but that was not a problem as it was quiet which gave us a chance to talk without having to talk over the crowd of more ""energetic"" destinations.  I had seen the menu on line and assumed that was just a part of the menu.  There was a special main course and dollar oysters until 7 PM.  That suited me as we had arrived a little early and I had a half dozen being the only one that enjoyed oysters.  They came with a small cup of red sauce that tasted mostly like ketchup and two of the smallest pieces of lemon I have ever seen outside of a drink garnish.  Belgian style frites were a big hit at the table.   The artisan charcuterie for $12 contained three meats that were listed on the blackboard for our review.  The three artisan cheese plate had three hard cheeses for $16 making our cheeses, pound for pound some of the most expensive in Chicago.  The marinated olives for $6 on the other hand were a large portion and I took the extras home and have had a few every day.  Nothing special about the smoked paprika spicy chicken wings for $11 but they did have a kick.   I liked their flatbread with fava bean puree, manchego cheese, speck and arugula $13.  No one was awed by their mac & cheese served in a metal ramekin.  One entrée of the hanger steak with green garlic chimichurri, new potatoes and spinach $20 tasted fine, but was a disappointment as one of our group makes a much better chimichurri sauce.  For desert, we were celebrating a birthday and had the Dutch oliebol (doughnuts) on a bed of raisins, currants, almond and honey.  We had asked for a candle but when brought out, not a word was mentioned about the lack.  Nor did our waitress apologize for that misstep.  When I made the reservation, I said that we were celebrating a birthday.  What we did not try was their obvious house specialty of mussels made in a Belgian style, with Korean seasoning or traditional Southern French flavors. The selection of libations on the other hand made up for the abbreviated food menu.  Pages and pages of beers in bottle and on tap and a great selection of wine by the glass or bottle were of modest prices.  Service was pleasant but not attentive considering that she was not busy.  To have so many tables open on a Saturday night does not bode well for their future.  Their chef certainly has talent, but we won't make a point of going back.  If in the neighborhood, it is a great place for a beer or a glass of wine with a snack.  I think that they are over reaching to call this a full-fledged restaurant.",0.9964,0.827,0.142,0.031,0.4673069985569985

The place itself is very small so it might be a good idea to get a reservation, though we just walked right in on a Tuesday and got a small table next to the windows.

But in honor of season, I had to go with the Jolly Pumpkin.  *The atmosphere: It's a good combo of fun/casual derived from the exposed brick and chalkboard menu specials with a swanky/hip aura derived from the dim candle lighting and sleek decor. It was lively with the Saturday night dinner crowd but also bustling at the bar. *The simple yet upscale menu: I like when restaurants know what works for them and focus on those items. We ordered the prosciutto app and it was actually a good size portion for four people with fresh/crisp watermelon, arugula, onion and cheese on top. What could improve our experience - *No beers on tap - I appreciate the wide selection but it would be nice to have some on draft rather than all bottled. *Service was a bit slow - This could be attributed to the ""rush hour"" of when we entered the establishment, but it took a bit too long to place / wait for orders.

My first reaction was to call this inexcusable and rate it 1 star warning people not to eat here. But it's not like chefs have bacteria-seeing glasses, and how common is it to slightly under-cook part of a giant half chicken in a busy restaurant on a weekend night?  So don't let my bathroom horror story scare you away, that can happen anywhere, especially with a dish like that.

They brought out the mussels and there was bread in the bowl (the menu doesn't say anything about bread with the mussels).  Which of course means that I can't eat it, because they were now contaminated by the bread.  My boyfriend went and got the waiter and explained that they needed to bring out one without bread.  Again, the waiter came over to the table and said the mussels were definitely gluten free and I could eat them.  We kinda stared at him and said ""No, no they have bread in the bowl so it's not gluten free... can you bring one without bread?""  They finally did.   The bottom line was that the whole experience made me really nervous that they don't understand how to properly handle an allergy or intolerance, and even worse, they wouldn't admit that fact.",0.8402,0.848,0.088,0.063,0.6070175438596491

My friend claims that I am ""the pro"" at picking wine (I am flattered, but she exaggerates greatly!) and after reviewing the wine list at The Bluebird, I was impressed.  There were quality bottles of super Tuscans, Cotes du Rhones, and Rioja, as well as some very unique craft beers available by the bottle and on draft.  We selected a nice and affordable Nebbiolo to sip as we decided what to have for dinner. The two of us agreed to share the southern French mussels and frites and the artichoke flatbread.  The mussels were cooked in a delightful sauce of fennel, leeks, tomato, and white wine.  Despite how good the sauce was, the preparation of the mussels and frites paled in comparison to anything from a true Belgian restaurant.  The artichoke flatbread was essentially a thin cracker-like serving of carbohydrates topped with goat cheese and arugula; a delicate, but bland plate that really failed to impress. We were still feeling a little hungry and decided to share pumpkin pie for dessert.  I know restaurants are all about cutting costs, but wow, what a minuscule piece of pie we received.  It was also not your typical pumpkin pie; it had the consistency and density of a cheesecake, was probably about an inch and a half high, and was garnished with some very potent cranberries that drowned the flavor of the pie.

My date had the bison burger, and he didn't finish even half of it, saying it wasn't very good. The kitchen did at least cook it to the temperature he ordered. The fries accompanying the burger were quite tasty, though.  Ambiance is nice. I love a place with low lighting and a decent wine list (in a place more known for the beer list).

He didn't tell me where we were going until we got there, and I could obviously see it was Bluebird. Immediately, I knew why he picked it: 1. The beer list was extensive. By bottle only, and not as pricey as expected 2. THREE types of mussels (belgian, french, english) 3. Charcuterie plate for $25 4. And of course, pork shoulder  We were seated in the back. If you think this place is small from the outside, don't worry--there is a large back room. At 6:30 on a Friday, it wasn't packed until 7. We beat the crowd, and were soon surrounded by well-dressed foodies like ourselves. Hey--I showered that day, ok?! We asked how big the charcuterie plate was. The response ""Definitely substantial for the both of you, you get your money's worth"". PERFECT! We decided not to order until we saw the plate. Good choice. There were about 5 cheeses, and 5 types of meat with garnishes, too. There were flat crisps and a warm french baguette that accompanied it. We were ALMOST too full from the beer and charcuterie, but we moved along quite nicely to the pork shoulder. It was served with apple stuffing, sweet apple&honey type sauce, lettuce, and brown crunchy rice. We devoured it.  Were we finished? No. I spotted the chocolate porter cake with lavendar cream and suggested, rather demanded that we get it. I didn't really have to twist the beau's arm, seeing as we both ate all of it. It could have been sweeter, but that's because I like my desserts decadent--that goes without saying! Oh, I took pics of our plate and dessert-check it out! This is a great place for a date.

On this Monday night, the poor waiter was alone manning the whole restaurant -- so the service was a little slow, but we felt so bad for him, it wasn't a big deal.  We ordered a lot of food to split and though it was all tasty, the clear winner was the duck poutine.  It's decadent, rich and should not be eaten by one person alone.  It's everything I've had North of the border and better when accompanied by the flavors of the two wing bird. Another amazing item -- the cheese plate.  It's done extremely well and the cheeses are unique and flavorful. I've had about a billion cheese plates and this one is worth noting. Because the waiter was so overwhelmed and forgot our drink order a couple of times, he comped these, and the three of us had a huge dinner for $38.  Unbelievable.  I would recommend this as a nice place for a date, dinner with friends or an outing when you're the third wheel.  All feel appropriate.",0.9905,0.743,0.211,0.046,0.5970238095238095

Absolutely love the ambiance here, especially on a gorgeous night like tonight.

The food itself was pretty good, though I wouldn't say the *best* I've had in this kind of establishment.  We had a pomme frites at the bar (basically nice french fries) and I had a delicious bison burger as my entree.  The marinated tomatoes were truly the killer ingredient on the burger.  The fries were $5 and the burger were $13- very, very reasonable.

2011-10-06,5.0,"I've been a fan of Jack Stankovic since he was slinging pork chops and goulash at the Theatre Cafe way back in 2010 (check my review).  Sadly, Jack left shortly thereafter and the Theatre Cafe is no more. Now, as you may know, Jack is back at Bluebird and he's working his old magic again.  Full disclosure, Jack is a friend of mine, but know that because of that friendship, I had high expectations, and they were met. I loved everything about Bluebird.  The decor is classic Wicker Park - dark wood, exposed brick, hardwood floors, just enough ambient light, and ambient music that sets the mood for some seriously flavorful food.  We had a promising start with a champagne toast and old school cocktails, and eagerly awaited rich savory dishes.  We were not disappointed. First off, I love love love the drink program here, which is to be expected, given the provenance of the owners - Webster Wine Bar and Telegraph.  The J. Lassalle 'Cachet d'Or' Brut champagne is simply gorgeous - crisp and full of minerality, with loads of bread in the bouquet and on the palate.  I've recently become of lover of Cabernet Franc from the Loire Valley, and the Olivier Cousin had an earthy barnyard bouquet and rusticity reminiscent of finely aged Southern Rhones that paired perfectly with our dishes.  My noble bourbon boozers will find pleasant haven in the cocktail menu, for they make a fantastic manhattan.  The menu version is made with Bulliet Bourbon, but Bulliet Rye, which was my choice, is also available, and it provides a spicier version of the same.  On to the food.  We started with mac and cheese and mussels, provencale style.  Upon casual inspection of the mac you might think it to be light on cheese, but first impressions can deceive - the dish has loads of cheese flavor and none of the cloying clumpiness that has ruined many mac and cheese productions. The provencale mussels burst with flavors and boast fresh herbs that evoke the hillsides of the South of France.  Their aroma is unique to mussels I've had in Chicago and is not to be missed.  The mussels themselves are meaty and tender, and when they are dispatched you will want a second serving of bread to sop up the plentiful broth. For dinner, we had the steak and the pulled pork.  The pulled pork in the faro had a heavy flavor of smoke and cream and was just as good three days later as it was that night.  The steak was grilled to a perfectly bloody medium rare and had a rich consistency. As a finale, we had the beer batter waffles with peaches and the molten chocolate cake.  The waffles were light and flaky, and the peaches provided a perfect hit of sweetness.  They are perfectly matched with one of the many available selections of bourbon, and indeed the flavor is enhanced with a splash of bourbon upon the waffles.  The molten chocolate cake was similarly top notch. I look forward to returning many times, exploring the beer menu in more detail, and reclining in languor at the bar.  I recommend you do the same.",0.9989,0.761,0.207,0.032,0.5356666666666664

And that's fine by me - there are way too many restaurants in this city where I'd consider my table lucky if the wait were 30 minutes. I walked in at 7 on a weekday for a going-away dinner with 7 other people. It was practically empty, which was shocking. I'm used to having to go through a whole song and dance for a good meal in Chicago. Thank heavens we didn't have to do that here. There was no wait and no stress. Our table started with Spanish olives: manzanillas, arbequinas, & marcona almond-stuffed gordals. I am normally not an olives girl, but these totally hit the spot. I enjoyed a house wine special: a Cortese that was the perfect medium between sweet and dry for me. We also got to try the chicken pâté and some grilled baby octopus. The pate was flavorful and refined, the octopus pretty standard. I'd say the standouts from the meal were the pasta dishes and the mussels. We had an amazing rabbit pasta I'm still thinking about today. A flavor profile and presentation reminiscent of spaghetti carbonara, the oyster mushrooms were a fantastic touch to this dish. And everyone inhaled their mac n' cheese: penne w/ mascarpone, gruyère & bacon. We also tried two of the mussels: Brussels-style and Colonial. The first had a strong herb/beer base complementing the mollusks perfectly, and the second a rich cream base spiced with cilantro, curry and lemongrass that we drank like soup. The Belgian-style frites w/ truffle aioli & curry ketchup were coveted by everyone at the table and didn't last long at all. We finished with waffles - a dark chocolate sauce adorned one and bananas & caramel the other. The price point of this meal was ridiculously reasonable.

2011-04-03,4.0,"Just read a one-star review of this place, just -trashing- it because it's excessively yuppie--which it kind of is--only for the author of the review to offer the Hopleaf as an alternative. Apparently wine bars are pretentious, while gastropubs specialising in mussels and obscure Belgian beers are totally salt of the earth.  Anyway, Bluebird is pretty excellent. It is a bit pricey, and it is a wine bar--they specialise in wine, that's what they do. There is no tap, but they have some excellent bottled beers I haven't seen anywhere else, like The Demon Hunter, an awesome Italian (!) beer with the best label in history. But you should really try the wine--it's a great list, with selections from all over the world, at any price point you want. I didn't know they made really great, affordable wine in Lebanon before--thanks to the Bluebird, now I do.  And the cocktails are similarly excellent--I didn't know I liked Sidecars before--turns out they're terrific.  The one area where Bluebird truly does seem overpriced is the bar food--the portions really are tiny. Yet even there they serve some really great stuff--is the pata negra ham really crazy expensive for the amount you get? Yes. Is it some of the best cured meat you'll ever try outside of Spain? It actually is.  So yes, I recommend this place--if you're looking to try something other than beer (though again, they have great beer too)  alongside some really excellent, interesting food, it's hard to go far wrong. If, on the other hand, you spend your life living in terror of being labelled ""pretentious"" (which is apparently only slightly better than being labelled a ""war criminal"") then Bluebird is probably not for you--at some point you'll realize it's right across the street from Marc Jacobs, which might trigger some kind of psychiatric episode.",0.9973,0.701,0.237,0.062,0.6506845238095238

It takes a lot for me to lose my patience, and saturday i did. it was fairly busy, but the bartenders (both of them) were quite salty. is it such a pain in your ass if I/ we need to see a wine list? or if one of the girls wasn't sure exactly what she wanted at that very moment? it wasn't as if the bar was 4 deep and there were others waiting holding up their money. I have a lot of past experience behind the bar, so i know how it can get....however, the guy did nothing short of roll his eyes right at us. He let us know quite clearly either A. (he didn't like us there) or B. (he didn't want us there) or C. (he plain didn't like us) we were spending money too, 2-3 bottles of wine, several cocktails, and a cheese plate (which was the only pleasant thing about this particular visit).  We certainly were not being demanding...and we were not sloppy drunk....we are always professional and polite....and we don't look like assholes? so why the attitude sirs? if you don't like your jobs, go do something else.... I would suggest the illinois DMV in cicero. Those two evil clowns would fit right in there nicely. It's too bad that this seems to be a growing issue more and more frequently in such a charming place with so much potential.

This place is super reasonably priced and has some great wines that are bargains. So why the heavily qualified start to this review? Once again we had issues with service.

Super tender and flavored well.  The sweet potato puree was also really delicious.  Not sure what to make of the salty apple slices on top, but it added an interesting flavor.  Friend one got the vegetable flatbread, which seemed to only have potatoes on it.  The flavor was a little dull, and really garlic-y. Would have been nice as an appetizer for a group.  Friend two got the bison burger which she wasn't super impressed with but the frites were yummy.   Probably won't go back as the menu isn't very big and I didn't really see anything else on it I wanted to try.  Wine and beer selection was good, but could probably get it cheaper somewhere else.  Maybe if I was going for a romantic setting, I would hit Bluebird up again.  Otherwise, it was a fairly good experience, just not superb enough to repeat.",0.9941,0.676,0.25,0.074,0.6605555555555556

I do wish Bluebird would open slightly earlier (5pm? seriously? haven't you heard of happy hour!?).  So, this wouldn't work for an early Friday event with work, but a visit later is well worth it (p.s. free fries with drinks during the week early?! - this is fab!).",0.9874,0.785,0.184,0.031,0.5724358974358976

I had the pork cheeks which were very tasty, but which consisted of two small medallions. This item was listed as a dinner entree and not as a small plate, so I expected more. I had wine by the glass, but others enjoyed various beers. The cheese sampler was a good start. The squash soup appetizer was also very good. The belgian waffles for dessert were good and we ate them ravenously because our dinner portions were small.

2010-09-20,4.0,"Oh how I loved the Bluebird. My only regret is that it took me so long to get here!  I had dinner here with an old friend of mine. We had delicious wine, great food and lots of laughs. The ambiance of the Bluebird is urban chic, with lots of exposed brick, candles and hardwood floors. I felt like I was walking into a bachelor's loft. Cool, stylish and sexy.  After reviewing the menu, I had a glass of their Cabarnet Sauvignon. My friend had a beer... don't ask me what kind. The problem with the Bluebird's menu is that everything sounds good. How to decide what to order?? I went with their beet salad and ahi tuna. Both were excellent. I've had a lot of beet salads around the city. It's one of those dishes where if its on the menu, I'll always get it. The Bluebird did not disappoint. The portion size was super generous, with a delicious crusted goat cheese, grapefruit and delicate greens. While the dish is certainly shareable, I ate the whole thing by myself.  I also had their ahi tuna small plate. Again, the portion size is quite large for a small plate, and it was fresh, flavorful and delicious.  My friend had the chicken wings and frites. He devoured the wings. I confess, I ate half of his fries. Try their garlic dip. Totally worth the calories.  I will most definitely be back.",0.9964,0.71,0.266,0.025,0.6172619047619049

2010-08-30,4.0,"The intention was to eat at Hot Chocolate, but poor advance planning on my part and a 60+ minute wait pushed our dinner party to Bluebird. Seeing how crammed Hot Chocolate was, I was almost positive Bluebird would have the same wait, but we walked in and were immediately seated. Something that always impresses me off the bat with restaurants such as this are their cocktail and wine menus. First off, if I see any cocktails where a Smirnoff/Absolute vodka is mixed with Sprite, I turn and run. Bluebird has a fantastic cocktail menu--I didn't familiarize myself with their wine, but would guess that was satisfactory as well.  Our party of four ordered a wide variety of dishes, but I stayed rather simple ordering the beet salad (this is one of my favorite things) and the bison burger. However the two culinary highlights of the meal were ordered by my companions--Shannon got an order of the French fries with curry ketchup and garlic aioli. YUM. Then to top it all off, Judy ordered a Belgian waffle with fresh banana and homemade caramel sauce was the perfect end to the evening.  Perhaps my positive experience at Bluebird affected my review of Volo, also a small-plates place (two-stars, not so good), but when you have two similar offerings and two varied outcomes, it makes a big difference. Add to that, the atmosphere at Bluebird is even more conducive to better dining than Volo.  But hey--who am I to judge!

The reviews that mention the so-so food and horrible Bison burger are TRUE. I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini and while that's not the kind of drink most people would order here, I was just craving one and it's been around 100 years so every bartender should know how to make this most simple of drinks.  When it came out it looked great, sugar on the rim, pulp in the glass and a candied lemon on the rim. But it was not sweetened AT ALL.  When I asked the snobby waiter about it he put his hands on his hips and flippantly said ""We don't really do those kind of drinks here, honey.""  Honey?  Ok, just cause we are both obviously gay, don't call me honey.  Secondly, if you don't make staple martinis and secondary well known martinis, why DO YOU HAVE MARTINI GLASSES HERE IN THE BAR?????

Glasses and bottles, libations from near and far, all surrounding me and making me woozy with the boozy. But I am not a fan of your newest incarnation of the menu. Well, I think it can improve, nay it totally can!  Your flat bread, so crunchy and tasty, loved the combinations and all! The lamb one I had last Saturday? Soft and pliable. Perhaps you were thinking of making it more of a spin off of a pita since the toppings had minced lamb on it. To tell you the truth, not a fan. Happy that you kept those wings, delicious and with that spray of caramelized and burnt orange, it zinged and zipped happiness to my stomach. Still love your cheese plate as well. But really, I wasn't too impressed with the rest. The pork cheeks were ok, but nothing that wowed me over. The selection? May I say I am not high on the hog on it all? And that isn't saying you have to add more pork to the menu, (though if you did, I totally wouldn't mind).  Now I know you liked to mix it up every now and then, and really I can't disagree, I liked to have some surprises in my life! It makes it interesting! But as much as I love variety in my life I love those things that I can consistently count on. I miss your mac and cheese with bacon. I miss those crispy flat breads. The sausages.... sigh..... Now don't start throwing yourself off a cliff, I still have a place in my heart for you. Your server was awesome and kept my table of 10 hopping and fairly buzzed by the time we left to go to the next adventure. Flying around and on top of everything we needed. I still love how you sway me with your intoxicating selections.  But seriously, not crazy about the menu. Not at all.

We chose to sit towards the back where there were less patrons to make for a more private experience. With a beautiful lady sitting across from me I had no other requests. The beer book (literally, I think there were a few chapters) took me a while to browse through. I liked the extensive selection as I could taste something new that pleased my palate. A perfect place for a beer or wine snob with an appreciation for finely crafted beverages.  After the drinks were flowing the food decisions came next.

Grilled flap steak with grilled asparagus & red wine reduction The perfect amount of food for two, I commented, after taking the last bite of mac n' cheese.

First, atmosphere = Great.  Love the exposed brick, the lighting, the art.  Really nice.  Beer Selection = Excellent. No drafts, but I can live without it with this kind of selection. Hitachino Nest Beer is yummy and strong, the Witte light and refreshing and the Ayinger really a nice, light delight--who knew you could actually taste banana in a beer?  (and it's GOOD) Food = Above average.  Of the four dishes my SO and I shared, we absolutely DELIGHTED in two of them.  The rabbit fettucine and the special of the night, the braised pork belly, were to-die for.  We actually ordered a second pork belly.  For desert.  It was THAT good.  We also got the selection of meats (with a very nice name that I cannot remember) which was okay, but forgettable really--except the SO really dug the chicken liver pate.  Final dish of the night was the veggie ratatouille which was a little bland.  We only ordered it to help lighten up our otherwise meat-heavy meal.  So it served it's purpose, but I would probably never get it again.   Service wasn't the best.  Our waiter was really very nice, but often absent.  The hostess was great.  The busboy came by often, and even wiped down our table, which we very much appreciated.  The bartender who served us while we waited for our table just looked annoyed at our existence.  It just made us glad we were not eating at the bar!

Now, I was with close friends but, that napkin was nowhere near big enough to share. Of course, by the time I looked up to ask for more, the bartender had mysteriously disappeared, again. It came to the point were the couple sitting next to us was about to walk out so, I politely asked the host if they were short staffed and let him know our party and our neighbors would like to order something. He replied that they were not short staffed but he just ""didn't know where the bartenders were"". The same host eventually came behind the bar and took our additional food and drink orders.

I went in for dessert with a friend a few weeks ago. It was late and the crowd was thinning. Few open tables. We sit down, order dessert and some after dinner drinks. Apparently this offended our waiter who was a complete a** the rest of the night. Just acted like we bothered him by being there. I bar tended and waited tables for the last 8 years. I get we were not the greatest table of his night but come on! The place was starting to empty out, there were several empty tables so he could get more people in if needed, we ordered alcohol, and we were in and out in under 30 minutes. He was such a jerk but the dessert was decent, not great but decent, and the ambiance was so nice that we decided to go for dinner Tuesday.  Where do I start? Service was horrible. She was rude, had a snooty attitude and kept asking if we were done. It was dead that night so again I do not understand the need to ""turn your tables"". One server, three open tables, let me eat in peace.  We ordered a tuna app on house chips. I love tuna appetizers because it is such a blank plate. It can be seasoned and made to taste so many wonderful different ways. Well this tasted like grease. It was pure oil and zero flavor. Not chili oil or something interesting. Just oil. Next we had a salad. Roasted beets, ricotta, walnuts, honey and a dressing. NO FLAVOR. How you can remove flavor from beets, I do not know but the dish had no taste. I assumed the cheese would be seasoned since ricotta is so mild, def needs some seasoning with an intense taste like beets but the whole dish just sucked. Then we had a basil tomato soup. I honestly think i came out of a can. Thank god we didnt order a dinner yet. We paid and went for to another restaurant. Rude service mixed with bad food. No reason to go back.

Sometimes I like to curl up in my bathrobe and eat Mission To Marzipan ice cream and watch Beaches in a luxury hotel suite, but that's neither here nor there. For those middle times, the ones with the salad and the sandalwood and the upright kicking it, an appropriate dinner locale is needed.  Now, I'm pretty classy, so normally I take 'em through the old Arby's drive thru for some of that bacon cheddar Roastburger action, but it's hard for them to eat it sitting on my handlebars, so I need someplace with them sit-down tables.  Enter Bluebird. Tucked up just north of the hipster-infested herpes cesspool that is Wicker Park's 6 corners, Bluebird is a dark (not creepy dark, nor racist dark, but like, sexy dark) haven, candlelit and tastefully decorated with exposed brick and stout wood beams, a beer and wine list that is quite respectable and a kitchen brimming with simple but relatively delicious New American fare.  It's not the type of meal you have to write home to your mother about, proclaiming your love for some sort of poached skatewing dish in a torrent of purple prose, but for a light and fulfilling little meal for two, a couple of drinks and good old fashioned ambience, it's definitely nice to have around. Service can either be amazing or offputting, depending on the server, so maybe a little team-building (they have these great seminars now for that sort of thing) might help, but still, since I don't really need some waiter all up in the middle of my super smooth seduction skills, throwing off my A-game I could really care less.  Just bring me my belgian blonde and my rabbit courgette and let me do my thing, right?

Stopped in for dinner and it was fairly empty when I got there. We seated ourselves and waited for the menu. The waiter took down our drink orders and brought them out promptly and then he disappeared. It'll come to my knowledge that he's good at disappearing.  After perusing the menu we placed in the order for our appetizer. - Charcuterie: really tasty and well cured meats. Pata negra was delicious. I give props to the artisans who make these and sell their art to restaurants who facilitate it to us, the customer. So Bluebird really can't get much credit since they didn't actually make the meats.. - Cheese plate: Probably one of the best bries I've had in a long time. Very creamy. The Spanish sheep's milk cheese is pretty standard Manchego type. Very nutty. Frites w. Garlic Aioli & Curry Ketchup - hefty portion of fries, aioli wasn't nearly as garlicy as I expected, it just tasted like mayonnaise. The curry ketchup was too pungent in my opinion but I found myself dipping into it more to cut the saltiness of the frite itself.  We also ordered their wings... but we never got them. The waiter was one of those types that don't bother writing down the order. So on his way back to put in the order in the kitchen, our request for wings escaped him. We reminded him about the wings and he owned up to his shortcomings, but we didn't bother to go through with it. Entrees: Braised rabbit leg over fettuccine: I was disappointed by this. It was lacking flavor. The rabbit was questionable. I found myself wondering if I was eating chicken rather than rabbit. They tried to do a light cream sauce but it was really thin and oily. It sounded superb on paper but it was executed poorly. Steak with braised chard and red potatoes: Decent portion, I just have an issue with people cutting my steak for me... I'm capable of cutting my meat thank you. My plate was lukewarm and my greens were actually pretty damn cold. The red wine reduction saved the plate but overall it could've been better. I'm beginning to wonder if my plate had been ready for a while and my server decided to do another disappearing act before coming back to bring it to me.  The check took forever as well. Our waiter was buy chatting up the hostess who arrived and we sat there waiting for him to come collect his payment. So I'm thinking they could revamp their service.

And, in sticking with my ""birdie birthday"" theme, Bluebird was my choice for the birthday meal. The decor is marvelous.  Exposed brick, low lighting, wooden beams set a very lovely atmosphere that was natural, yet very polished.  We had a cozy table for two toward the back near the ""fireplace"" which turned out to be the perfect setting for our meal. Extensive beer menu, perfect for the brewery connesiuer, including Belgians and other lovely brews.  I stuck to a couple of glasses of the Mawby bubbly, which had me floating on a lovely journey of Bluebird's treats. First stop was meats and cheeses.  We sampled the merguez lamb sausage (from New Glarus, Wisconsin) and the smoked duck breast  alongside the cana de cabra goat cheese (from Spain) and the chimay la biere cow cheese (Belgium).  Presented beautifully with an assortment of olives, fruits, and warm, crusty bread, we agreed that this was a highlight of our meal.   Second stop: Plates.  Pork chop (with pears) for him, and grilled flap steak for me.  Both meats were excellently prepared to our choosing, tender and flavorful.  We also shared a side of frites which came with a curry ketchup that was perfection in a little ramekin. We ended with the fabulous chocolate mousse cake that  paired with my champagne perfectly.  (Chocolate and champagne together = heaven.) The one thing holding me back from five-starring this joint was the service.  It was inattentive and just not very nice.  For example, when she brought the first beer, she slopped it in the glass and it overflowed.  Her reaction?  ""Ooops.""  And slowly walking away to talk to another table.  It was just....odd.  And the timing was off.  We were in no rush, so when the pork chop and the steak came out when we'd barely ventured into the cheeses, it just seemed off.

Luckily, I've become slightly obsessive about utilizing public transportation and thus my CTA chariot whisked me safely home after 3 glasses of precisely perfect (and generously poured) Mawby champagne (from my home county, Leelanau, Michigan). Homegirl, holla.  I pretty much knew I was going to be in all sorts of bubble-fueled lust with Bluebird before the first drop (which sat dangerously close to the lip of the glass, thank you bartender) even touched the very same lips that spit cherry pits so dutifully summer after summer in Northern Michigan. You can take the girl out of the (faux) wine country, but don't take my damn champagne. Thanks.  Oh, and there is food, too. Actually, great food.  Start with: Olives. All varieties and different sizes, and the big ones are stuffed with some kind of nut. Awesome. Oh, gazpacho with avocado!? Indeed, sir.  Middle with: Heirloom Tomato Salad with Buffalo mozzarella and balsamic drizzle. Sauteed whitefish over snap peas and artichoke hearts. There was a distinct butter taste, not totally dissimilar from movie theater popcorn, my champagne compatriot and I decided. But you know what? Movie popcorn is like the crack of the toppings industry, so putting it on fish is like...mind blowing. Fattening? Oh, yeah. Whatever. It was excellent.  End with: Chocolate mousse cake. This thing is serious, but perfect portioned for two...and I'm positive that if we had been alone, we MAY have licked the plate. The line between rich/decadent and smooth/silky was most def achieved by this triangle-shaped mousse-y masterpiece. Mingle in: well, champagne, of course. However, their beer/wine lists are extensive and well thought out. Their specials (including Lagunitas, Two Bros, etc) are fantastic...and their bourbon specialty seasonal cocktail called to me from the chalkboard. Champagne is a fickle mistress however, I stuck with her ;) My head surely thanked me, I'm sure....

I didn't pay any of the times I was there, but if I remember correctly, the prices are reasonable. Nice people watching. I've only been during the week, and they always seem to be fairly busy, good for them.  The whitefish is delicious. Absolutely. I've loved every beer and wine I've had, which isn't anything they did except have a good selection, but it's worth mentioning. I was told by date number one (on our third date, holla, again) that it is ""pretty intimate."" Apparently I gave him the impression it had  a more casual, bar feel. I've been told it does not, ladies and gents. I said it was because we had a table, which I still think is correct. Sitting at the bar is much more casual, the tables are kind of date-ish. Isn't that the case anywhere, though? Regardless, the other date was lame and was nice that I was able to have a prime seat at the front to people watch while I was bored.  The food comes out super fast, btw. And the servers are fine. Nothing special, which is kind of how I like it. Don't get in my business, but don't be a snatch when I am unsure of my choice of beverage for the evening. They've always answered my questions or had nice suggestions when prompted.

It all started a few weeks ago in another bar but the craze hasn't faded yet. In fact it might grow even stronger thanks to Nathan.

I didn't order any - too scared of the 'too much of a (two?)  good thing' syndrome. And when my lovely girlfriend joined me, the real feast started: not only the glasses kept being filled and emptied and the food (meat and cheese, what else?) arrived, but our (aspiring) winegrower in shining armor wrote down for us, no, not his phone number - way too trivial, but half a dozen of labels to try. He had me sold on Bandol. Lovely little town on the French Riviera where I spent all my childhood summers.

Yes, I want that. $44 a bottle? Meh, my birthday is coming up. So yes, the Bluebird sang to me and made me dream. Nostalgia settled in but not for long; I was too ecstatic to have found yet another fantastic place where I felt like home.  Nathan and his magic talk made the trick for sure.

I'd skip the slimy, lackluster smoked duck in favor of the arugula and orzo salad, you need the veggies anyway and the layers of tangy, peppery arugula over an orzo dotted with feta and chick peas was positively what the summer doc ordered!

2008-11-16,4.0,"A decade ago, when a boy was a complete douche to a friend or to me, the girls and I would get beers, blast Ben Folds Five ""Song of the Dumped,"" and let out some pent up rage. Fast forward ten years: boys of course can still be complete douche bags, but now, my ""boys are stupid, lets throw rocks at them"" moments occur at lovely, sophisticated places like The Bluebird in Bucktown. My completely fabulous bff, Janna V., whisked me there post-manis at--where else, Mojo's--for sardines and wine. When we walked in around 5:30, it was the height of quiet, understated chic. Candles dimly lit the exposed brick walls, and the patrons were speaking to each other in meaningful, hushed, important tones. Janna V. and I sat ourselves at the bar and ordered wine. She got her usual Cabernet Franc, which, being a Cab was still too oaky for me, and I got the Malbec, which very typical for me. I adore a spicy, juicy Malbec.  The menu at The Bluebird is perfect for early noshing. The diminutive yet satisfying menu is dotted with toasts, bites, and tastings of charcuterie, and contains some more substantial flat breads and salads as well. There was a special sausage platter of the day, but Janna and I went straight for the sardines. Three large, slightly charred sardines arrived, accompanied by a salad of fennel and blood orange. For a moment, I felt as if I had slipped into a page of Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises."" While plates of grilled anchovies have certainly worked their way into my dining repertoire, this was my first time eating a sardine. I highly recommend it. After dealing with the slight unpleasantries of heads and tails, which is actually quite an indulgent gesture when one is suffering from a romantic setback, the meaty, salty fish effortlessly flakes off into buttery morsels that nearly melt in your mouth.  As we were divvying up the third sardine, our flat bread arrived. I had selected one with grecian sausage, chevre, greens, and caramelized shallots. It was rather good; the individual flavors were pleasant and tasty. However, I felt that it lacked unity, which is often something I usually criticize in my students' writing. Hmmm.... By the time we left, an hour and a half later, The Bluebird was filling up, and its demure charm was slowly fading away. I was no longer in a quiet arrondissement Paris on a January evening, but back in trendy Bucktown on a Saturday night. But the moment was lovely, and echoed the joy of once meeting a pleasant young man at the opera and on the bus ride home. But magic fades, and as we all know, nothing gold can stay.

I think you almost need to think of Bluebird like you would a wine bar. You go there to drink and maybe nibble on a little something.  But my finance and I wanted dinner so we each ordered a meal. I had the rabbit pasta and she ordered a flatbread, we also had some frites to share. It was all great! I am a big fan of rabbit, if I see it on the menu I usually order it up. But the only thing that out shines the food is the amazing beer selection. A good portion of the beer list features 22 oz beer master specials, which hit the pocket book at $15-$25 a pop. All is great stuff, I really can't wait to go back with friends and order some beers and maybe a small something off the meat and cheese plate.",0.9758,0.856,0.144,0.0,0.5000000000000001

I would say if you are looking for beer just go to the map room, if you are looking for wine then Bluebird is good for you and if you are looking for food there are better places. So, I have wanted to go to Bluebird for awhile now; however, just got around to it now. I had heard mixed reviews, but still had very high hopes going into it. Friday at 830ish, 45min wait (probably was more like 30 though.) Beer and wine lists were fantastic (but beware if you are not aware, good beer here will cost you...wine list was great and affordable if wanted.) Took about 15 minutes to get a drink as the waiter was tending to his own liesurely pace. Surveying the clientele they were definetly of the young 30s, white, preppy, but not preppy enough to live in LP variety that Bucktown calls home (not a knock, just an observation and hope that I can too one day have some more $.) Also, was a little bitter because I was sat next to a couple on a date and the dude deserved a punch in the face for being cliched douche from the suburbs. Ok, food. So originally was going to go with the mussels and fries and try the meats and cheeses. Decided that the meats and cheeses didn't look that impressive or worth the $4 a bite tag, so went with fries, steak and rabbit pasta.  -Fries-  First of all I had pretty high expectations of fries, if you are going to call yourself a gastropub or bistro or whatever I expect good fries. So anyway the fries were cold, and the aioli was terrible (chili ketchup was good although could have been a little spicier.)  -rabbit pasta- The rabbit pasta wasn't anything special -steak- Very good, cooked on point Other complaint: Pasta came out far ahead of the steak, which according to other reviews goes along with the poor service complaints. Aside from that and the bartender taking his time I didn't have a problem with the service, although no challenging questions were asked.) Anyway, boos were a much higher portion of the bill than the food (which is expected,) but left feeling that it should have been a better meal to justify my bill.

Maybe this waitress is the onion-dip and Lays type, because those were the exact flavors that this bizarre appetizer provided. ""Melted leek"" was right....the leeks had obviously evaporated into the overpowering cream cheese, creating a totally unappetizing sludge effect both in taste and presentation.  For our second courses, we split a flat bread pizza with roasted mushrooms, roasted shallots, watercress and brie. We also tried the mussels in Blanche de Chambly Ale with shallots, chili flakes, and garlic. The flat bread was, well, flat. It really lacked any spice or seasoning, and honestly just tasted like someone had spread some butter on the flat bread and laid some watercress on it. The mussels were on the other end of the spice spectrum; total chili flake overkill.  I'll give it to Bluebird in that the ambiance was somewhat interesting, but for the money we spent, I expected the food to be much more creative and inspired. Obviously this isn't a true gastropub.

""Why,"" I wondered, ""in a city like Chicago where great food is supposedly something we are proud of, does one of the most touted 'gastropubs' have to be so terrible?""  But let me back up. Because I obviously have a lot of explaining to do.  This was my second visit to the Bluebird. The first time I went I had a beer and some cheese and it was fine. The cheese - mahon, drap, and garrotxa, were just fine - although not cut 'properly' for those types of cheeses (for more instruction on cutting Spanish cheese, see this website:  cheesefromspain.com/CFS/…  ). It was quiet and laid back and I figured I'd take in a meal sometime. Sometime arrived the other night. I was excited for our meal and The Sass-quatch and I ordered enough to feed a small family. A flatbread, a salad, a cheese plate, a meat plate, a soup, frites...we pulled out all the stops.  Our meal started out with promise. The cheese plate was tasty, but again, not cut properly (too much rind, not sliced according to wheel shape, etc). The meats were good, too -- they, at least, were sliced thin. The meal faltered when it came to prepared foods. The salad was terrible - one of the worst I've had since making the mistake of ordering a salad at the airport Wolfgang Pucks. Heavily dressed arugula sat on an overcold 'composed' salad of chickpeas and orzo. It was frigid and texturally uninteresting. Flavors were mushed together. The soup was fine but uninspired. The flatbread was terrible. Oily, some parts too thick with cheese, covered in chewy sun dried tomatoes, which are seldom enjoyable when sprinkled with such a heavy hand. Frites were fine, but not worth seeking out. The REM-heavy soundtrack was also a massive downer but reflected that this is a restaurant for yuppies in their late 30s and early 40s for whom food is a novelty and not an obsession. That's not the Sass, and that's certainly not me. Advice to The Bluebird: ask your cheese supplier to come in and teach you about cutting cheese and putting together cheese plates. Grow your menu to include non-meat items that are created to be non-meat items, not just afterthoughts with the bacon or ham removed, and add more truly gastronomic touches.

We were seated right away when we came in, and our waiter was very attentive. We ordered way too much food for two people, and I wish the waiter would have said something cautionary, but oh well. I had the Ephemere apple ale, which I was a big fan of, and I have no idea what the boy got, but it was good, too. The food was where we were really surprised and pleased. We started with a roasted baby beet and frisee salad, and I seriously could eat it on a daily basis. The flatbread (tomato, basil, mozzarella, pine nuts, and salami) was just okay; without the salami, it was very bland and needed a little something extra - more flavor in the crust perhaps? The flap steak, however, was perfect cooked, and oh-so-tasty, especially when paired with the fries in garlic aioli. No room or time for dessert this time, but we'll definitely be back again soon to try some more beers and get that beet salad again!",0.9718,0.789,0.16,0.051,0.5801190476190476

2007-11-03,1.0,"""Die, yuppy scum,"" someone said as I walked into the back area. Then I realized who said it. It was me. To myself. Silently.  This place, sadly, is what everyone was hoping Bucktown didn't turn into: A dump disguised by money. I don't think I felt that bad about patronizing an establishment since the time I walked into Avenue M on their opening weekend.  My girlfriend and I walked in last night, planning to meet another couple for some libations. We asked the hostess for a table, as the other couple was parking their car. She couldn't seat us until we'd all arrived. Ok, that's not unreasonable. We take a seat at the bar and order a drink. ""I'd like a pale or white ale,"" I say to the bartender as I take my time going over their extensive drink menu. It's early November, but it's at least 78 degress inside. I begin to sweat. ""Ok, I think I can help you out,"" he replies. 2 minutes later, he's pouring a pilsener into a glass. I don't say anything, because I'm thinking that he, a bartender, might know something I don't. I'm wrong. It's a pilsener. Better than Budweiser, but lacking the flavor I seek. Then I see our friends walk in. We remove our Rock & Republic clad asses from the barstools and meet them at the hostess stand.  ""Sorry, I gave away your table. You'll have to wait about 20 minutes."" Strike! Time passes at the bar, seatless, as the ones we'd given up were quickly taken. The bartender is now too busy to get me another beer. I walk out for a smoke, as they don't allow it inside. When I return, the hostess tells me they're ready to seat us. We follow her to the back room. Everyone is about 30, white, wearing expensive jeans. Quiet night in Bucktown. Just like us. ""Die, yuppy scum,"" I hear someone say as I contemplate the stool-like chairs they have at the tables. I'm confused when I sit, as the chair seems to recline when I lean back. When I lean forward, the seatback doesn't return to it's full upright position. These chairs have to be from Ikea. We go about ordering. $30 750 ml of strange brew for the guys. The waitress plops it on the table and walks away without saying anything. It's ok. The food is ok. Small plates.  Later: ""Can you get me a pale or white ale?"" I ask the waitress, figuring her command of the English language might be better than the bartender's.  ""Yes, I better get you the Bluebird pale ale."" ""Oh, is this a brewery too?"" I ask. THERE IS NOTHING ON DRAFT AT THIS PLACE.  ""No."" ""So there's a brewery somewhere else that is owned by the same person?"" ""I don't know."" The waitress returns moments later with a 16.9 oz bottle. I taste. Hefe Weizen. I look at the bottle. Hefe Weizen. Waive my hand at the waitress. ""Um, excuse me, this isn't pale ale. Can you get the Bluebird you suggested before?"" ""Sure."" Moments later, she returns to pour another beer. Pilsener. Not Bluebird brand, but a German label. I don't have it in me to tell her that she and her bartender are two of the stupidest people I've ever seen allowed out in public.  We pay, leave. The seat remains reclined. Now, if I may share a little known secret with you, my loyal reader: Go to the Hopleaf. Yes, I know it's an $18 cab ride from Damen and North. Don't worry though. Put away 4 beers and you'll be saving money and you might even get what you order. The Hopleaf has about 4 times the selection that Bluebird does, with a broader, tastier food menu. The crowd is more diverse, and doesn't make you feel so bad about being the trixie or chad that you just realized you've become.",0.9893,0.865,0.094,0.041,0.3514255765199162

I also sampled a German Pilsner, EKU, that I had never heard of that was also quite good.   The ambiance was nice.  Wood topped bar, exposed brick walls, and antique light fixtures that while manufactured in Chicago, were actually found by the owner in an old warehouse in Philadelphia.   But the drinks and ambiance is where the love ended.   We tried a wide range of food options and none of them met our expectations.  The flat bread with manchego cheese, Serrano ham and egg was okay but nothing special.  At least it was hot, which is more than I can say for the macaroni and cheese with bacon that we ordered.  We also had the mussels (many empty shells and too much garlic) scallops (topped with cucumber slivers-the best thing of the night) and very overly done fries with aloi sauce and curry ketchup.  Surely that is enough sampling of the menu to know that this place cannot deliver on it's food promise. The service was good- but maybe our first clue about the food should have been when we asked the server for his favorites- he said he didn't have any.  Hmm . . .a little coaching, . . .say something, anything when asked this!

And bad because I still like the wine I like and would like a neighborhood place that actually sold it for a decent price. That being said we're definitely coming back. Tomorrow if I could.

The food was very reasonably priced, which was nice.  The beers were on the pricier side (everything at least $6), but given the quality of the selection and the reasonable food prices it wasn't really a problem to me.  The list looked to be pretty solid for wine; the only thing I wish they had on that front would be to add flights as a wine bar typically has.   Edit: Went again, the mussels were OK, but not great.  An awful lot of kick to them, I think they overdid the chili flake (I like hot and spicy food, but it was rather weird with the mussels).  Still one of the few places with a good beer list and at least interesting food, though I think the food is pretty hit and miss as far as whether it's good or not.",0.9965,0.757,0.216,0.027,0.581388888888889

For those of you who see the word Gastropub and say Gastro-What, let's take a look at Wiki for a second. *wiki***A gastropub is a British term for a public house (""pub"") which specialises in high-quality food a step above the more basic ""pub grub."" The name is a portmanteau of pub and gastronomy and was coined in 1991 when David Eyre and Mike Belben opened a pub called The Eagle in Clerkenwell, London. They placed an emphasis on the quality of food served, though The Eagle was not the first pub to offer good food. Gastropubs usually have an atmosphere which is relaxed and a focus on offering a particular cuisine prepared as well as it is in the best restaurants. Staying true to the format requires a menu that complements the assortment of beers and wines the gastropub offers.*end wiki*** Now that that is clear, you should know that although the name Gastropub may not be that old these types of food, bars, pubs, whatever, have been around fO-eVA. The Meets are severed by the ounce are spectacular, it's like having a tasting at a great butcher, or deli. The Flat Breads are amazing and extremely creative in flavor combinations. The wines are vast, fairly priced and the servers know what they are talking about. Now my favorite part.  The beer. Now I'd like to see some taps in this place but hey that's okay, I understand.  Beers from all around the world, but for me it's the Belgium all the way.  I bet the beer menu in Heaven looks a lot like this one even though, some bottles are a bit on the pricey side.  Fear not you will find one tailor made for your palate without killing your wallet. Next is the atmosphere, The Bluebird has a minimalist approach to decor which right away lets people know that ""WE ARE NOT PRETENTIOUS"" which is good because most ""Americans"" would look at the common menu at a Gastropub and make that mistake.   The bar stools and table chairs right away took me back to science lab, i was wondering where the Bunsen burners were. The front windows open up to giving the feel of alfresco. The music is perfect not to loud just right to enjoy and still have a conversation.   Which brings me to the best part of The Bluebird. You know how some places are great but the clientle sucks, thus far, this place is great and the clientle is AWESOME, full, of great people who get the idea of the Gastropub, it's all about Good Food, Good Wine, Good Beer, and GREAT CONVERSATION.  The night me and my Extra Special Lady Friend (ESLF) were there we met everyone it seemed and talked about such cool things all night long, even shared food and drinks with others in the place, good friends were made that night at The Bluebird.  So yes, go to The Bluebird, enjoy yourself, meet people, and DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING ON THE MENUS!  These guys know their stuff and just want to make you as happy as possible.",0.9991,0.754,0.226,0.02,0.5481937602627259
2007-08-02,4.0,"Finally.  I've been heary the glories of the new gastropub on Damen for 10 months.  Heard that the food was going to be great, the drinks program world class and the space super cool.   So, after 2 visits I will begin to judge.  Lots of AVEC going on here, which is just peachy by me.  Any place that has seperate MEAT and CHEESE sections on the menu are worthy of consideration.  Servings are small, but yummy.  Mac and Cheese is great, with little specks of meaty pig bits that remind me of Belgium.   Beer list is authored by Tall Paul and it goes beyond Map Room to the rarest and priciest stuff around.  I had a bottle of Swiss multiple barrel aged stuff that was interesting, but I would never pay $50 again for that stuff. Wish there were more drinking beers next to the experimental beers, that holds them back in my very biased opion. Space is super cool, with reused and recycled barn wood, etc, all around.   Given a little time and polish it could easily acheive 5 stars, but right now I'm sittin' on one, in honor of Blue Bird on Clybourn and my many mornings spent there.",0.9912,0.788,0.199,0.014,0.48627705627705636
2007-08-01,5.0,"Love it. The decor at the Bluebird is a dark, inviting take on rustic America with barnwood walls and old school doors. Lab stools at an antique-wood bar signalled to me that this place was sophisticated without the pretension. I've been for the beer list so far, which I can only describe as ""curated"" (though read the small print, some of the rarer brews are pricey). I've been probably five times already and the crowd is never pretentious. I think I've made a new acquaintance every night. Try the chickpea/spanish chorizo stew on the apps list. Savory and packed with flavor. Almond slivers in the mix give it a delicious crunch.",0.93,0.881,0.119,0.0,0.6754545454545455
2007-07-27,5.0,"We came here after dinner last night for a glass of wine, and despite already being full we ordered a few cheeses to accompany our wine and ended up staying for a few more glasses.  What a great decision that was!  All of the food around us looked so good, we're going to come back soon to sample some more.  The wines we tried were outstanding.  The first glass I tried was a Greek white (can't remember the name) but it was the tastiest Greek wine I've ever had. The wine list is extensive and has something for every taste and budget.  The descriptions for all of the wines (bottle and glass) are helpful.  I'm not much of a beer drinker myself, but they have a large selection as well.   The space itself is unique with table tops made of fir from old wine casks.  We could have stayed for hours (more) but had to get home.  We'll be back soon!",0.958,0.886,0.114,0.0,0.33509070294784576
2007-07-27,4.0,"This Bluebird is as good at what it does as the old Bluebird on Clybourn was dark. The ambience of this place is especially warm and convivial. At once sophisticated and casual, all the aesthetic touches from the surprisingly comfy Art School Stools to the wood mounted menus, are inviting and well thought out.  The bar itself is gorgeous. Douglas Fir maybe??? The artesian beer and the diverse wine lists including a very nice $7 Pinot will keep me in the fold.  The food selection is quite diverse (Fish, Quail, Flatbreads to canap style ""toasts"") will seemingly support both a destination and neighborhood crowd. Just one taste of the Garlic aioli and Curry Ketchup accompanying my Frites ($5) was enough to displace my monthly need for Hot Doug's Duck Fat Fries and Streetside's Chipotle Ketchup. The kitchen is open late night and I can see myself easily becoming a regular here.  Perhaps the most NYC place I've been to in Chicago.  That's a good thing.",0.9851,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.6579772079772079
