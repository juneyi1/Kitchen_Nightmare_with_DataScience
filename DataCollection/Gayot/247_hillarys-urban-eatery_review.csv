I have dreams of this wonderful place.  I am not ashamed to say  but i didnt tell my old high school friends (lol  cause some of them are about drama  gangs and b s)  I didn't want to see people from any hood hanging out here. THIS RESTAURANT SERVED PANCAKES GOOD ONES  ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY.... The lighting and the setting were contemporary and urban.  Very nice host and hostess...  ITS ALL ABOUT HILARY  I bet she trained them, as well as her cooks.  THIS PLACE IS IDEAL  WHEN I HAD TO STUDY SOME BUSINESS LAW  or wanted to take one of my buddies to talk business or have a casual conversation. But on the other hand  VERY SPECIAL IF I TOOK A CHICK HERE,,,  This was my place my joint, my world...

2007-10-12,4.0,I'm surprised this place closed down. It was actually very good. I hear the mayor used to eat here. Used to be one of a few reliable brunch spots.,0.624,0.831,0.169,0.0,0.4337777777777778
2007-08-24,5.0,An awesome urban joint. I used to take Saturday morning motorcycle trips downtown to have breakfast here. There is nothing like it (that I've found) in DuPage County.  Truly inspired food. Corned beef hash that's based off slow-cooked brisket chopped into large chunks. Variety of eggs choices served in styles that blow away 99% of all restaurants serving breakfast. Awesome breads and coffee threatens to peel the enamel off your teeth. If a new one does open (drops to his knees and prays) I hope they keep the tough urban feel of the old store front.  This place is busy for a reason so expect to wait if you snooze late.,0.9184,0.809,0.141,0.051,0.4833136560409288
2007-05-14,5.0,"Where o' where has my HUE gone? So many good memories I had here. Remember when they had that HUGE, ginormous breakfast buffet upstairs that was about $25.00 per person but worth every dime? Remember how you had to wait on Saturdays or Sundays for about 30 minutes but did not mind to people watch. Remember how they used to serve all drinks in Mason jars? Remember when you thought that was chic, not trashy? I remember wanting to live in the upstairs because it looked like the loft of a really cool friend who just happened to have a buffet in the living room. Please, someone recreate the ambiance of HUE on a warm, Saturday morning in May.....I will pay whatever you want. I am serious.",0.9754,0.777,0.201,0.022,0.5645833333333333

2007-03-03,5.0,I miss this place so much... i miss the stupid fucking jars of jelly beans... what the shit? who wants a three year old jelly bean?

2007-02-03,4.0,Hillary's was a haven of good food.  The number of crystals hung from the ceiling with fishing line really started to freak me out.  But they had great comfort food.,0.7675,0.632,0.284,0.083,0.5166666666666667
2007-01-29,4.0,"Moved away a few years ago from Chicago and shocked to hear this place closed (Although it appears the rumours are that they are to reopen). Great breakfast place, as evidenced by their typically long lines on the weekends. Brunch buffet is excellent but the killer dish for me was the Chilaquiles, the best! Great staff and Hillary and her husband were terrific...Here's hoping it reopens soon and will before my next visit!",0.9329,0.697,0.221,0.082,0.46666666666666656
2007-01-29,5.0,"It's been nearly a year since I last had the steak tacos at Hilary's. I still dream about them... and the chilaquiles.  Hilary's was a tradition for us. Visiting relatives requested it by name and brunch hasn't been the same since they closed. I hear the space is now a little grocery store. Sniff.

2006-02-12,3.0,"Just tried HUE for the first time and had a great meal.  However, it was bitter-sweet because we found out that the restaurant is closing in a month. (Rumor has it the location made it quite the obstacle for HUE to obtain a liquor license). The wait staff said she wants to reopen in another location where they could obtain the license.  Anyways, very cozy atmosphere, and loved the jelly bean jars on the table.  Went with a big group of girls and everyone loved their meals (Tuna Steak, Tilapia, Crab Cakes, Mac N Cheese).  I recommend the sweet mashed potato and creamed spinach sides.  We ended the meal with the bread pudding which was served with whip creme!",0.9424,0.839,0.139,0.022,0.5635416666666667
2006-02-09,5.0,"It is now your last chance to eat here! Today 2/27/06 Hillary's will be closing it doors. Yikes, where am I going to go for lunch now? Luckily I had a chance to eat this weekend and the food was fantastic. With so many selections of mouth-watering choices, I wanted to eat it all. The staff is fast and friendly, they're half the fun of going. Saying goodbye to such a cool place to eat at is going to be hard. Weird Side Note: 2/11/06 - I just saw them on Check Please this past weekend, not a word about closing. Must have been filmed before the decision.  NEW: 3/3/07 I recently heard from a former employee that Hillary is opening an new version of this restaurant down the street from the former location. Also, my Mr. Houdini was the basement cat at Hillary's before, now living the luxury life as a house cat.

2006-01-19,4.0,The Sunday brunch at Hilary's is scrumptious.  HUE is especially nice in the Summer because of the comfortable back patio.  The decor is kitchy and quaint.  You won't get out of Hilary's without dropping a few extra dollars...but it is worth it every once in a while.,0.8858,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.35000000000000003

2005-10-13,5.0,"i thought the food was good and the atmosphere cozy. the only truly stand out thing about this place, as far as i'm concerned, was my waiter. i was nursing a horrible hangover and picking at my food, looking generally miserable probably. my waiter came by, looking concerned and asked if the food was ok. i explained that the food was fine and admitted to being hungover. the waiter sort of laughed and came back with a club soda and lemon concoction, told me to drink it and said that if i had come by earlier, we could have fixed this situation sooner. oddly, the club soda miracle tonic and lunch did the trick. there's obviously a healer on staff.",0.8319,0.801,0.138,0.061,0.5714285714285714
