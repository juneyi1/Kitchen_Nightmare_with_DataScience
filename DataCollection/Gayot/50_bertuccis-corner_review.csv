This only made me wonder what fresh produce was being thrown into my main dish and I nearly did not continue. I wish I had not.  Unfortunately, I did go ahead and tried the main meal and it was AWFUL. I did not know someone could make Italian food so terribly bland. I could not taste a single ounce of seasoning at any point. In addition, the chicken in my dish was overcooked and dry making it impossible to finish my dinner. Bottom line: Spoiled produce, bland food, poorly cooked meats.

They do have one waitress who is scrambling around to do everything but she handles it like a champ. While I'm there (since I live in the suburbs) I also have a tiramisu and a cappuccino..fantastic. This is an ideal place for a date..It's got its own little location in the middle of the neighborhood so it has that hidden gem feel.--But it's also great just for me by myself! lol. I said not good for groups because it is so small. If you have more than maybe 4 people I'd say go elsewhere.

Upon walking in, there were only a few patrons at the bar and one family at the table. We were seated by the hostess, served our drinks by the bartender, and then tended to the rest of the night by whom I would suspect to be the manager or owner (older lady).  The restaurant was more of a divey feel than Italian, but the service was nice. We started off with the fried zucchini which was very tender and devoured tastefully. Also came with a side salad with their house dressing - would have enjoyed the salad more if it weren't loaded with the romaine stalks.  For my meal, they had veal piccata on their menu, however I made the request for chicken piccata instead with no problem. It was decent, though I think adding capers and/or artichoke would have made a nice touch (was a simple chicken, spice and sauce dish).

We were told to sit where we wanted (after I asked ""Are you open?"")  which was easy to do since there was not a single other person in there.

We both got minestrone, which was actually pretty good. After we were done with soup we waited, and waited for at least 1/2 an hour, then waitress informs us that our pasta will be ready ""in 7 minutes"". Um, ok. More than 20 minutes later, our food arrived. Apparently they don't use salt in their cooking. The pasta was tasteless. They did not put any salt in the cooking water. Even though we both ordered meat sauce, the sauce was marinara with a few, and by a few I mean 4 or 5 ""crumbles"" of ground meat thrown on top. The sauce was not cooked with the meat in it. The meat was not even mixed in. It was seriously like something out of a bag from Sam's Club, these meat crumbles. I pushed them to the side and ate some gnocchi, which was cooked surprisingly well (not mushy) though tasteless and clearly not homemade. There was something ""off"" about the taste of the entire dish though, like it was ""fishy"" or something.

Where to start....I had a bit of everything, since I was there for a wedding rehearsal dinner for reviewers Paul M. and Whitney G. that you see below my review. I think my favorite was the Eggplant Parmigiana and the Spinach Lasagna. The fact the Spinach Lasagna (which was TO DIE FOR) was made special for the occasion is simply a reflection of the owners' desire to go out of their way to make you feel at home. I know some folks might think dishes similar to what I ate have just way too much cheese, but then, they'd miss the point.

The marinara sauce is nothing short of perfection. The lasagna is the best I've ever had. The veal and eggplant parm is mind-blowingly tasty. And Maria, the owner, is one of the most delightful women I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.

I have enjoyed dining at Bertucci's multiple times in the past two years and have had fantastic experiences EVERY TIME. Two, anyone that doesn't like Bertucci's is crazy, and probably thinks the Olive Garden is great Italian food. Bertucci's is a classic old Chicago neighborhood joint that has history and character. The juke box has some great old tunes, and occasionally we start dancing next to the bar when we've had too much vino. I stumbled upon it during Chinatown festival and the food smelled so good, the group I was with ordered Lasagna to share even though we had just eaten. I'm a big fan of eggplant and love both the Eggplant Rollatini and Parmigiana. The marinara sauce is so good, we often order a bowl of it just to dip our bread in. Honestly, I have never had anything I didn't like at Bertucci's Corner, and the owner remembers me every time I come in!

Neighborhood is a little sketchy (literally right behind China town and close enough to Bridgeport) but worth the trip. This is one of the very few places that I outright give 5 starts too.  Underrated for sure. All of their food is exceptional.  Have daily specials that are always compelling and you can tell they spend a lot of time developing.  I esp love the Broccoli and Gorgonzola salad that is drenched in a beautiful garlic and lemon juice sauce.  I also love the Pork Chop Vesuvio that comes with 2 fat pork chops in a extremely tasty vesuvio sauce and potatoes.

As you push open the front door- your eyes are immediately drawn to the long wood bar- worn from years of patrons leaning on it as they enjoy their beer and talk about their day.This is a working man's bar. The wood paneled walls, the checked floor tile and pictures of old Chicagoans make you think about a bygone era as you ponder the menu for what to order.  Daily specials are posted on a smallish chalkboard but being sticklers for the ""tried and true"" we ordered off the main menu.  For appetizers, the baked artichoke can't be beat. Lots of bread crumbs and garlic- this giant artichoke is enough for a meal or two. We also ordered the salami and cheese plate. Be warned! This is a huge plate of chunks of cheese and salami, peppers and olives- surely enough for a party plate and way too much for two people!  Our entrees were great. I had the house lasagna with meat sauce (could barely make a dent in it as it was so huge) and my friend went with the tortellini Alfredo. Very good, home style taste.  And just when we told our server that nary another bite could pass our lips- she brings out a huge dish of homemade spumoni ice cream and two spoons. What's a girl to do? I just had to have a taste! Hard to believe that we could have all this food (and drinks) for about $50. Service is a one (wo)man show. The bartender was also our server and she was quick with our drinks or in getting us anything we needed. Parking is pretty easy in this neighborhood but know that after 4pm you can also park in the elementary school lot down the street.  Check it out. But know when you push open that door- you will have stepped into another time-  a simpler one- with good food, good service and a little peek into Chicago history.",0.9945,0.845,0.14,0.015,0.5469354838709678
2009-02-08,5.0,"I don't remember how I found this restaurant, but it quickly became a favorite.  The staff is what really makes this place great.  Maria and her family are really great service oriented people.  All restaurant employees should be so attentive.  They will even work with you for special events and special menus.  I've introduced many people to this restaurant and many have returned often.   My favorite dish is eggplant rollatini.  It is a periodic special and not on the menu, but if you ask nicely, they may whip it up for you.  However, everything seems made with fresh ingredients.  I've never been disapointed.   Parking is much easier now that you can use the school lot just Northeast of the restaurant.  Other reviewers have already commented on the atomosphere.  I will only add how much better it is since the whole restaurant is non-smoking.",0.9933,0.741,0.259,0.0,0.6204887218045112
2009-02-03,3.0,"Undeserving of yelp-related hype but not without its charms. Location and atmosphere are Bertucci's most impressive features: where else in Chinatown can you find a '60s era family restaurant? The menu features typical Italian-American dishes for about $11/plate. Service is friendly and slow-paced.  Bertucci's Corner is worth a visit if you're already in Chinatown, but don't make this your primary destination. There are too many restaurants nearby that feature superior dining at comparable prices.",0.9578,0.76,0.217,0.022,0.5625
2008-09-21,4.0,I have been going to this place with my family for years. Its wonderful home cooked Italian food. I was never dissapointed. The portions are huge and the price is just right. The servers are friendly and attentive. Its a small place hidden on a corner of a residential area in Chinatown. They also have a bar in there. This place is packed with regulars and usually city workers or policemen. Definitely give it a try if your in the area and have a feeling for Italian.,0.9081,0.847,0.153,0.0,0.4835497835497835
2008-03-17,3.0,"If you are from the Northeast, you have probably heard of Bertucci's, the chain restaurant.  When I found out I was heading to ""Bertucci's"",  I immediately thought another chain had slinked west, but my dining companion assured me that this Bertucci's is NOT a chain. So off I went to Bertucci's Corner for a real ol' Italian lunch in, uh, China Town.  Italian is hard to screw up so it is always a safe lunch option.  When we arrived, I felt really comfortable - this is a divey dining spot without being gross.  The crusty bread and olive oil were just what I needed to start.  The waitress came over right away and told us the specials - Eggplant, fried smelts, lasagna, spinach ravioli - there were quite a few.  I really wanted a salad but did not think this was the time so I went with the spinach ravioli in marinara sauce.  I must say, it needed a lot of cheese and pepper but the sauce was really fresh.  I liked the overall dish well enough but kind of wish I had chosen something with more flavor. . .  I will definitely come back here for a work time lunch and order something  else- Bertucci's has just the right amount of no-nonsense lunch vibe I need.",0.9853,0.834,0.151,0.015,0.3840608465608466
2007-12-03,4.0,"A vendor of mine has been taking me here for years. Fantastic meatballs, sausage and pasta. Certainly affordable. Not much ambience and off the beaten path, but the food speaks for itself. An older crowd and best suited for smallish groups. Have never seen a family here.",0.836,0.778,0.186,0.036,0.4609523809523809
