2007-08-26,1.0,"CLOSED!  We came here last night after we had several glowing recommendations from friends, only to find it locked and shuttered.  Tried calling but did not get a message.  After looking on the internet, apparently they have closed due to a lease problem and hope to open at a new location.",0.3903,0.822,0.113,0.065,0.32735690235690235
2007-05-21,2.0,"I found this restaurant to be extremely over-hyped with a severe lack of attention to details.  I recently had dinner there with 4 friends and none of my party will return.   We started the evening with chips and guacamole and quesadillas.  The guac was good and the quesadillas were passable.  For dinner I had pork baked in a banana leaf which was decent- moist but a little bland.  My wife had tiger shrimp served with beans and rice and a cheese stuffed plantain.  She said that the plantain was delish but the shrimp were bland as well. The others in my party had Turkey in mole, baked Cornish hen, and peppers stuffed with shark.  The stand out dish was the peppers.  This dish contained more flavor that the rest of the meals combined.   We sampled several disserts including the delicia de choco - which was probably the best.  Several members of my party did not enjoy the quarto leche cake, although the other half did.   The cocktail menu was not the best, although one of my party enjoyed a cocktail made with Squirt.   The service was rude and inattentive.  Granted, the restaurant was quite busy, however, we rarely saw our waiter.  In fact, I began ordering drinks when I was only half finished with my previous drink so that I would not have to wait, without beverage, for the waiter to return.   Lastly, the bathrooms are terrible.  I can only speak to the men's room.  I have never relieved myself so close to another person in my entire life.  Had we so desired, I could have locked arms with the gentleman whizzing to my left.",0.5532,0.809,0.097,0.095,0.4944444444444444
2007-05-01,5.0,"Delish. Absolutely WONDERFUL!  I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant, which has a somewhat offputting exterior ... It almost looks like some kind of tacqueria, slash nightclub from the outside.  But once you are inside, prepare to meet YUM!  I ate the venison from the Yucatan menu, totally awesome.  It was served with tortillas that were made from 50% corn, and 50% fluffy clouds.   Go here as soon as you can!",0.944,0.775,0.199,0.026,0.725
2007-01-27,5.0,"Dudley Nieto is back!  This fabulous new restaurant focuses on Yucatan cuisine and it is really wonderful. Expect cochinita pibil, achiote rubs, habenaro peppers and great seafood dishes. My wife and I had a delicious shrimp and octopus ceviche for an appetizer and grilled shrimp with plantain dumplings and mahi mahi baked in a banana leaf for entrees. We were stuffed but managed to share an orange flan with a berry sauce for dessert.  The staff is top notch, both friendly and professional, and the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful.  I think Mr. Nieto is one of the finest Mexican chefs around. He is a genius! By the way,  unlike the most popular high end Mexican restaurant here in Chicago,  Xel-Ha actually plays beautiful Mexican music.  And it's played at a level that allows you to hear your tablemate.",0.9902,0.745,0.248,0.007,0.5191414141414141
