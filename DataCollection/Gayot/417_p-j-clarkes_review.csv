2016-01-03,2.0,"This was the most forgettable meal that we had in Chicago. While we felt that the establishment's surroundings were pleasant, the food was not in keeping with the price, nor with the other meals we had in such a terrific city.  To start, we ordered chips and guacamole. The guacamole, while house made, was bland, and had a quarter of an avocado that wasn't even mashed up.  I ordered the Chicken sandwich. The chicken was anorexic to the point that I tasted more of the bun than I did of the chicken. The cutlet was dry, and thin. If the piece of meat had been 3 times thicker, it may have been an adequate serving. My girlfriend ordered a burger. The bun was rock hard, the meat was not seasoned and was flavorless. It could have been soy protein, as there was no way to tell it was beef by the flavor and lack of juices. It was a shame that the fare was so poor. We wanted to like this place, especially with the history attached to the name, but we won't return next time.",-0.152,0.912,0.04,0.049,0.6421052631578947

All I can see is...W...T....F?!  The food was absolutely horrific ( we had the fish-'n-chips Friday special which was nothing like the old), the service sucked (waiter was a complete newbie), the menu lacks most of the goodies they used to serve, only two sucky desserts (cake, ice cream), and the interior has only modestly been changed....and in a bad way (they took down all the photos and left the white brick). Seriously, we thought a joke had been played on us. Rosebud runs a top notch operation, so I'm completely baffled...especially by some of the reviews here.

2015-10-20,2.0,"I was a fan before they closed up shop to revamp everything.  Know that things change, I was skeptical of what was to come with the ""new and improved"" everything.  After waiting close to a year for them to reopen, I was disappointed to see that they made a few changes to the decor, but essentially kept everything the same.   The first visit in was just for a quick drink and snack.  The snack ended up being their guac and chips.  The guac was overloaded with onion and just not good.  So a few weeks later we decided to try the wingettes and soup.  The wingettes were decent, but the BBQ sauce was like Open Pit w/a dash of honey.  The chicken noodle soup has a distinct grease slick on it and couldn't be eaten. Now for the service.  It was a pretty slow night when we came in.  We sat at the end of the bar near the service bar where our bartender (nice-ish gal) served us just one drink and never came back to ask if we wanted another.  She walked by plenty of times while chatting away with the waitresses who were also kind of a distraction as they were busy texting on their cell phones.

Similar to what happened in the year or so before it closed. The interior was stripped down to very little...a lot of the wall decor is gone. Also gone is much of the menu. It's pretty stripped down version of what it was before, and does not match the website. Food was OK but nothing special and in an eating town like Chicago they'll need to step it up before it gets up and running again. Good burger at least.

Also chowed down on a large, delectable veggie burger. Awesome. No complaints here.   I was raving about it and brought one of my gal pal's in for a late lunch. I knew we were coming right around the swing from lunch to dinner so we weren't going to stay long and planned to close out right away so our waitress could do her side work or leave.  She greeted us and was friendly. She got us our drinks and we placed our orders. Food took really long to come out. I had just ordered a salad so I wasn't planning on waiting for quite as long as it took. I didn't say anything though because, who knows, maybe something went wrong, and the salad was really yummy when I got it.  My friend wanted to place an order for some sliders and I wanted a refill but our waitress was nowhere to be found. When the busser got her for us she didn't ask how anything was, took the order, and disappeared again. Eventually after another crazy wait, she came back to ask if we were done or needed anything else. I had finished my salad at this point but we let her know that the burgers still weren't out. She was surprised by this and went to check it, but that probably could have been avoided if she wasn't missing in action during the meal. So I don't know. Maybe it was an off day. I get that being the swing is exhausting-- especially after a Sunday brunch, but still not a good experience. I'll be back, I'm sure. The food is great and the atmosphere is pretty awesome.

It was Chicago and yes, it was windy. So shortly after we ordered our food we asked the waitress if we could move inside, and she moved us to a booth close to the corner of the restaurant. It seemed like a pretty popular place in my tourist eyes since the place was a bit crowded.  The food came out about twenty-thirty minutes later. I ordered clam chowder and my boyfriend a plate of chicken and mashed sweet potato. His chicken came out just as promised, with a bit of spiciness to it that matches the sweet potato perfectly. My clam chowder was creamy and delicious. It came with crackers on the side. The waitress came to check up on us once during the whole meal, which we thought was fine. The only thing though, we thought that we could use a bit more lighting. Now I'm not sure if it was the kind of atmosphere they were striving for, but I would like to see my food more than I did.

This soup will definitely fill you up, so don't order it thinking you're going to have room for much else, because you won't.  Secondly, they have a pretty solid breakfast menu and the portions are large. I was pretty surprised by their breakfast menu, I have to say.  Lastly, they are pretty open to suggestions as far switching up their preperation methods. Well, at least one time: my buddy wanted to order the fish tacos that were on special that day.

I was quite indecisive about where to go, I really don't know the area and he was paying), and after our first two places weren't available, we came here. Walking in I felt a little cramped. They certainly do well for the amount of space they have. The narrow passage areas, the low over hang ceiling for some of the tables, the copious amount of framed pictures makes it seem a little too much.

We got seated promptly. We sat in the back, I took note of the men intently watching the latest stock reports and ignoring the ESPN news. They have the back split in to two halves, a lower and upper section of tables, we were sat in the lower. Greeted with water and bread we looked at the menu with a certain pang of hunger which only means one thing, appetizers. We went with the buffalo tenders, tasty chunks of breaded boneless chicken in a typical buffalo sauce with blue cheese, celery and carrots. It would do. As I sipped my Fat Tire I looked at what I might have for lunch. My friend suggested on a burger and said they were quite good. Being a man to watch my svelte figure as well as one who can't eat beef, I went with the turkey burger with a side salad and he went with the Reuben. When our meals came his Reuben, looked large and tasty and so did his sweet potato fries. It was large apparently since he took half of his sandwich home. My turkey burger was a decent size and actually very flavorful so I wasn't too upset that I forgot to add cheese, however my side salad was fairly unspectacular. Iceberg lettuce is not my favorite for salad, give me some radicchio or endive... now we're talking! Our server was good, relaxed but around when we needed him.

I've also had the salads here on other occasions and they are pretty good. Perhaps I should be visiting P.J. Clarke's more often.",0.9645,0.789,0.197,0.014,0.5685897435897437
2006-03-07,4.0,Love this place! Love going somewhere that has a million options.  Tried the flatbread pizza as well as the Chinese Chopped Chicken Salad and probably could have tried 100 other dishes! Great service and reasonable prices make this place a hit in the city! Would go back anytime..,0.9475,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.484375
2006-02-21,4.0,I am a huge fan of P.J. Clarke's.  I LOVE their ribs and their salads.  Service is friendly and food is always reliable.  I agree with Elizabeth.. make a night out at the theater and then grab a bite at P.J. Clarke's.  Also frequent their State/Division location as well.,0.9463,0.681,0.319,0.0,0.575
2006-02-14,3.0,"Good place for food and thats about it.  Not much to see and drink selections are poor.  Not the same design as other P.J. Clarke's, it is small and two stories high.  I went here for my building party one time.",0.3612,0.81,0.123,0.068,0.4057142857142857
2006-02-08,2.0,"Ok, two and a half stars. Above average bar food.  Always crowded with forty and fiftysomethings, this saloon is a cash cow.  Grown up frat guys mix with ad agency types to flirt with bleached blonde divorcees (think guys that know dialogue from ABOUT LAST NIGHT by heart, women with Linda Evans DYNASTY hair but blue jeans) Solid service, always with a smile. Be careful they're laughing WITH you, not AT you, though.  Good quesadillas and mini burgers.  Good place to nurse a bloody on a Sunday morning while the nighttime stampede sleeps it off.  Not enough TV's to make it a good Football destination, though. Daily afterwork hang, crowded always. At least more tolerable than the mindless Division bars around the corner.",0.8885,0.75,0.169,0.081,0.38500000000000006
2006-02-02,3.0,"The decor is nice and the food is decent.  I've been there for both lunch and dinner, and it's great for lunch.  Dinners are a bit on the slow side, but it's a great place to go before seeing a movie at the theatre next door.  It gets extremely crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, so make sure to have a reservation or go after your 7pm movie is out.",0.9256,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.6819444444444445
2005-10-16,5.0,I love this place!!  They've got an enormous menu with a variety of things!  We just went here yesterday and I got the best salad with goat cheese and shrimp.. delicious!  Our waitress was kind of annoying but we ate a TON of food and it was super cheap!  Its huge too .. they have like 3 floors of tables and a big bar!,0.96,0.696,0.277,0.027,0.6966666666666667

2005-09-30,2.0,"Maybe my overwhelming blahness for this bar has to do with the fact I normally get dragged out here on amateur drinking night #1 (St. Patrick's Day).  It was super crowded to the point where people were knocking over beers and bumping into you in order to breathe.  It wasn't all that fun, plus it was a little plain in the decor and the people there.  Next time, I will just stay home and put green food dye in my Miller Light.",0.2495,0.907,0.047,0.047,0.46238095238095234
