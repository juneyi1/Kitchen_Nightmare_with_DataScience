2007-08-18,4.0,"Went to Papa Milano more than a few times the year I lived just down the street from here. It's a tiny hole in the wall, but the food's probably far better than a lot of the overpriced restaurants that surround it. My favorite things about Papa Milano (in no particular order): -The fact that, no matter how busy they are, there's no official waiting list and they don't take names. Don't worry...they usually manage to keep pretty good track of who's next in line. -They may have good desserts on the menu, but I'll never know because they always bring something out for free. Usually cookies or cake, generally with a ""Happy Birthday!"" Doesn't matter if it's your birthday or not. -One of the waiters always asks if you want tequila when he takes your drink order. I think he still finds it funny. You may think so the first time or two. Hey, at least he's consistent. -They always seem to have some sort of holiday decoration on the wall behind the counter. I think they were still celebrating Valentine's Day in April. -Watching the woman behind the counter (Papa Milano's wife perhaps?) bickering with the waiters. Love it.",0.9927,0.748,0.216,0.036,0.5402222222222222
2007-05-01,4.0,"RIP- Papa Milano! You will be missed!  Hosts, Angie, Rosemarie and Carmen welcome you into their piece of Chicago- Italian style.  One big dining room filled with Gold Coast regulars that crowd in for the sauce and the pizza.  Yum!  We loved the Chicken Vesuvio and the Sausage Pizza with flaky not-too-thick crust.  The menu sticks with the basics, but this place is a piece of Chicago history. I heard a rumor that we have to get it while we can.  The old location is said to be closing in the next several months  I haven't heard if they will relocate??? What will I do without the warm welcome of the Papa Milano staff and the little complimentary Italian cookies after a delicious meal???",0.9527,0.832,0.141,0.027,0.49000000000000005
2007-01-20,3.0,Something about this place would definitely lure me back.  Perhaps it was the ad-hoc bar behind the hostess counter.  Maybe it was the very traditional-style food.  It could have even been the FREE piece of cake the serve up at the meals end.  It is definitely the overall ambiance of Papa.  Every single person there is so polite and so welcoming. I loved it.  The tables are very modest and they pictures and maps of Italy.  Even Oprah found a place on the wall - random!  Something Papa exudes really made me feel comfortable and for that I will go back when on Rush.  Choosing Papa over Gibson's or Cru is a no-brainer for me.,0.968,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.4510204081632653
2006-10-26,4.0,"Me: 'Hi. We'd like a table for two. How long of a wait will it be?' Papa (thick Italian accent): 'Oh, two! 20, 25 minutes.' Me: 'Great. Um, are you going to take our name?' Papa: 'No, no. I remember you! I remember face!' We spent the next 30-35 minutes (he wasn't too far off) watching Papa (or at least I think he's Papa) guestimate times to hungry patrons, forgetting who was in line first and asking us how many were in our party almost a half dozen times. It was more funny than annoying. Papa's is a TINY restaurant that is always crowded for a good reason: location.  OK, and the food. It's simple Italian (no fancy dishes with a bunch of different ingredients), but it's quite tasty and very filling. The pizza is a big draw, but we were there to carb-load, so we both had the spaghetti.  I ordered mine with sausage, and was mildly surprised to see an actual huge sausage link in the mounds of noodles (instead of being cut in chunks).  But it was soooo good. The service was awesome. There are fewer things more enjoyable than having an Italian man flirt with you while feeding you. They even gave us a free dessert (which was equally delicious) to apologize for our longer than anticipated wait. Yum! And they have complimentary bread. Always a plus.",0.9871,0.813,0.162,0.025,0.4964285714285715

Yum. SIX DOLLARS Man alive that's good lunch!  Even has an outdoor area.  Mama Mia Papa Milano is my favorite!",0.7243,0.767,0.158,0.075,0.6642857142857144
2006-05-03,3.0,"I went here based on the recommendation of a good friend.  Overall, dining here was a good experience.  The food and service was good but not very exciting.  They've some really good soups and pastas, however, their gnocchi falls short - La Scarola and Tuscany did a better job.  Prices on their fare is reasonable and portions were a good size. The location is in the hoppin' Rush Street area so there is plenty of things do see and do after your meal.  Papa serves up a fast Italian meal if you're on the go and want to jump back into the hustle and bustle of Rush Street.",0.9347,0.788,0.179,0.032,0.4319526627218935
2006-03-17,3.0,"We have always wanted to go to this restaurant and finally made it there tonight. I was really taken back by the atmosphere. I thought that the place was going to be a lot bigger then it really was. It is almost like a diner for Italian food. Although it is an Italian restaurant I did not see one Italian person which makes me question it's authenticity. That being the first impression, we sat down and were given water instantly and greeted by our waiter who was very nice. Shortly after they brought us warm bread which was pretty good. Everything seemed good until I saw the prices. Although they weren't outrageous they were pretty steep. Basically any meat dish such as Chicken Parmigiana is going to run you about $15-18 and a spaghetti type dish will run about $10-$12, although my girlfriend got alfredo and it was $14. I had the lasagna and I must admit that it was pretty good, but not amazing. I would say it was above average, but not far above. My meal came with a small salad and once we ate all our bread they brought out another basket, which was nice. One thing that always kills me is when restaurants don't give free refills on soda. I can understand if you are at a nice downtown restaurant not giving free refills, but not a place like this. (in case you were wondering a soda is $1.50 each). Overall the the good evened out the bad, making it average. Good, polite service, better then average food, but not so good prices, with a questionable atmosphere. I would say to try this place at least once and see if it's for you. Hope this Yelps!",0.9636,0.754,0.166,0.08,0.5582687338501292
2006-02-16,4.0,"All I have to say is the sauce makes this place.  The service was good and atmosphere is nice but the food is great.  I would have liked a little larger dish (I am a big guy, thus I eat a lot) but the portions were good.  Plus the cost was very cheap for the area.  I would have paid double for what I ate around the corner from here.  I ate:  Veal Parm with pasta (also comes with a free salad and side of peppers) - this was the best veal I have had in a while  cannoli - this was amazing, filling with cream throughout topped with green pistachios on the side... very good  I drank:  cabernet sauvignon",0.9901,0.725,0.275,0.0,0.5893333333333334
2005-12-13,4.0,"Papa was a rolling stone... Ah, Papa Milano. Sounds like a cheesy, touristy name, but this place is great. Maybe not totally authentic in the old world Italian sense, it still brings to mind the nostalgic idea of an unpretentious Italian restaurant from decades past. No frills, just red sauces and big portions.",0.6808,0.825,0.127,0.048,0.40499999999999997
