And the guy at the door had a white wig, a huge faux fur coat, a veil and underneath the veil- a moustache.

Monday night is THE NIGHT to be there, if you're a house head like me. Boom Boom Room Mondays have been going on for a while, and by a while, I mean, years--many years. Seriously, the folks who run Monday nights know what they're doing and they bring in a lot of talented DJ's every week to feed our insatiable appetite for house music. When you arrive, you are greeted by doorman Byrd Bardot, and two club kids, Sal-E & Jojo, who put some serious work into their makeup and outfits for the night. If the guys at the door are put this much work then you know the guys behind the decks are sure to put in some serious work! Monday nights here are always a great time regardless of whether you roll with a small group or a large crowd. The crowd is pretty diverse, the drinks are good, the tunes get ya movin, and it all feels right! You can chill at the bar when you walk in, or go to the back room and dance to a set by one dj, or go to the main room with a full on club/stage/lighting set up and get your dance on in there. Both rooms have bars so you don't have to go far to quench your thirst after some serious dancin. When you come to Green Dolphin Street, just make sure not to get too crazy. I've seen some questionable behavior between patrons and go-go dancers, and by questionable behavior, I mean, patrons putting money in the dancers pants using nothing but their there mouths! :O I highly recommend Monday nights at Green Dolphin Street to all my fellow house head Yelpers.

I say to ANYONE going to Green Dolphin, be sure to ""Steer clear"" of a bartender - (near the boom boom room) - named DANI; she's very pushy, rude, and should definitely retake customer service 101. I couldn't believe the attitude she gave me for simply asking a question. Totally a liability to this place!!!!  And for those wondering what occurred-- I went to the bar where no one was waiting on a drink and simply asked her if I should order there or go around to the other connecting bar nearby. She SHOUTED ""What?"" in a very repulsive manner as I repeated the question very politely. She then gave me a nasty look and asked if ""I had ever been to a bar before."" Quite the opposite response considering I was a customer asking a simple question. I replied to her that I actually work in the industry - a bar / lounge in River North as a matter of fact and that she needed to check her attitude.  Don't get upset with customers because NO ONE was purchasing any drinks from your bar. It would probably have something to do with your vile and crappy demeanor.

Brides know that there is a decent amount of interaction between your party planner @ your venue & you.  I worked with Jessica and found her really accommodating -- she got back to all of my zany detail emails very quickly -- I found that while planning a wedding this is very important -- and she was not at all demanding throughout the planning process.  She has a calming but ""get 'er done"" air about her that can only comes w/ years of experience and I felt very comfortable leaving the decorating, the flow of the evening, all of it -- in her (and her staff's) hands.   We hosted 160 guests, full sit down dinner w/ a cocktail hour and the price was comparable for the city; we reserved the Atrium & the Club Room. I really was trying to be budget conscious and I feel like the quality of the service, food & ambiance was worth the $$.  The things that really appealed to us were: 1). SPACE -- there is a lot of room @ Green Dolphin and we are a crowd of club goers, not wall flowers -- a proper dance floor was important to us  2). SOUND -- if this is important to you; rest assured it's top notch and you just pay the tech a small fee for the evening  3). FOOD -- just as there were club goers in the crowd there were also food snobs -- we can't help that we have good taste! I got compliments for days on the food. Special thumbs up to the mini chicken pot pies & the beef tenderloin.  4). PRETTY -- Our photographs are fantastic!!!  The rainy day forced the ceremony inside but having 2 spaces with soft lighting is really great.  Feel free to contact me & I can send a link to our photos if you'd like to take a look.  5). PARKING -- lots of family from the burbs; nothing beats a FREE parking lot adjacent to the building. Also, no problem getting a cab after the reception. My single complaint of the evening is that dinner service was a bit slow BUT they made it up to us by letting us continue the party in the Atrium when they had to open the club room to the public at 11pm. In a nutshell if you're looking for a space to get married that's not traditional but still has ""wow factor"" (not to be all David Tutera), that you can personalize (a lot or a little), that will impress your grandma and your hip cousins alike ... check out Green Dolphin.

2009-10-29,4.0,"I have heard of Green Dolphin Street and I have always seen it passing by Ashland and Webster and have never stopped in. The Boom Boom Room Mondays have been going on for years and years and I still have never had a chance to check it out. On Monday I rolled into The Green Dolphin for their Boom Boom Room Halloween Party and was greeted by two doormen and I was luckily on the guestlist which was on both Facebook and you could e-mail in an RSVP to avoid paying cover. Outside there was also valet parking with a private lot and some easily accessible street parking. Inside, the first room had some dining tables and was wooden and dim. It kind had the old school Italian restaurant feel to it and I easily grabbed a drink. The room directly to the east of the first room had a sports bar feel with large TVs and people munching on some food. This room was very big, but very empty at 9pm, so we rolled onto the third room. In the third room the DJ was spinning and the walls were lined with windows so you could see outside. There was plenty of room to dance  but for some reason there was a carnival strength hammer game thing taking up insane amounts of space in the middle of the dance floor. This thing totally blocked the dance floor but people danced around it anyway. The third room had a club theme with laser lights and strobes. There was space for go-go dancers, but unfortunately they were all dudes in their underwear that night, so did not appeal to me. There were plenty of people in costume dancing and I was not bothered by the six foot tall drag queens.  Overall, Green Dolphin is a happening spot with great music and plenty of room for everyone. Don't try to get here at 9pm because you'll be disappointed with the number of people in the place, but it will pack up by 11 or so. I like that Green Dolphin tries to be a little bit of everything and has enough room to pull off the execution.

2009-06-25,3.0,"This review is primarily focused on their wedding services. While the fiance and I have chosen to go with another reception location, Green Dolphin Street was the only other location we seriously considered.  We are planning a smaller reception and they have a nice room in the back that connects with a pretty out-door area overlooking the Chicago river. The mixture of outdoor and indoor space was key to us, so this was a major plus. Also, outside there is a really cool porch AND a dock. Believe me, the idea that we could leave our reception by boat was a major turn on. Also, their team of event coordinators are nice and seem to be very on top of things.  The down side- the price. While they definitely aren't the most expensive place out there, but they are not exactly budget wedding friendly either. I'm sure that if we had just fallen head over heals in love with the location we probably could have worked something out with them since they do seem easy to work with, but we actually ended up finding a location that we loved more (and was cheaper!) Even though we aren't having our wedding reception here, I would definitely recommend it to any bride to be who is looking for something a bit more original than a hotel ballroom!",0.9907,0.791,0.186,0.023,0.5775089605734768

That said, I love it.  The atmosphere, the music, the whole experience.  The music was great, and the there was a hilarious standup comedian who kept the audience entertained between sets. The crowd is great too - the average age is maybe late thirties, and everyone is stylish and too cool for the skanky club scene.  Basically, it's a place a 26 year old like myself can take her parents and her college age cousin and have a fun time.   Would definitely come back.",0.9929,0.745,0.246,0.009,0.5781249999999999

This is my second time at ""The Green Dolphin Street"" and the first time was much better. I refused to pay $20 for a self park spot that looks like your car is in danger from someone ramming into it. I rolled the dice and parked down the street in an open lot (It was worth it!) I get to the door and my name is on the list but the price for entrance is what? $30! That is a steep price in this economy. I thought the young lady was joking when she said the price. She said something about that is ""Fridays"" price.  I finally enter the club and is sorely disappointed but it was I doubt that they give refunds. I paid $5 for a Miller Lite! That was pricey. The floors were sticky especially the giant dance floor that was packed like they were giving something away free. I couldn't stand it anymore and had to leave after my friend got a drink dumped on him (on accident) and that was the only thing there to cool him off. There is either very little or no AC in this place. It is so hot that they held doors open. The temp. outside was in the 40's but inside it felt like an oven.

I went to meet up with a friend (whose friend used to work there), so they wanted to hang out here. I didn't know much about the place, so I said fine and was on my way. I get there at like 9 or so on a Saturday, and the first thing I see is that the crowd is probably a good 20 years older than me. I don't mind a mix, but this definitely seemed a bit...well, old. I walk inside and am greeted with a ""Hey sweetheart,"" from the giant Italian dude working the door. Uh..hey. He's holding a drink so I ask him if he wants to see my ID, and he's like, ""No, but I will need $20 to get in the door."" I start laughing, because I assume it's a joke. It's not. I immediately walk back outside to call my friend, because there is NO WAY I'm paying $20 to get into this bar. Her friend graciously tips off the bartender that I'm with her, and I'm in.  The crowd is older, and there is a loud band playing covers (I thought it was a jazz bar, but maybe not on a Saturday). They suck. Beers cost $5 for a bud light. I can't bring myself to ask what a martini costs. The bartenders are cool, but that's probably because I was with one of their friends. Thank god. The band gets worse and worse and suddenly two dudes jump out on stage and start rapping, Really? All of a sudden, at 11 sharp, the whole bar changes into kind of a Hispanic night. It might've been fun to dance, but by that time, I'd had enough and couldn't afford any more drinks. I climbed into a cab and headed home.",0.9895,0.78,0.173,0.047,0.4448275862068965

2008-12-18,4.0,"This review is for a party package on Saturday night, 11/15/08.  After citysearching, metromixing, yelping and through word of mouth, my wife and I finally decided on Green Dolphin Street to book a party package. Her birthday was on Saturday and wanted to celebrate by dancing and partying with friends. We had 35 people ready to party. I booked a birthday party package online at  oneworldchicago.com .  Background info on Green Dolphin Street birthday party packages: With the $50 birthday package you get a round table that seats 6-8 people, a decent size 9-inch round cake, and free entry for your guests if they get in through the VIP line from 11pm-12am. (I would recommend being in the VIP line by 10:30 pm if you want to get inside by 12am. The VIP line gets long pretty quick and it takes a while, about 11:10pm before they start letting people inside, especially if there is a concert that night, which there was on 11/15. But I understand it takes a while to breakdown the concert equipment and setup the dj equipment and get everything prepped up for the club) After 12am, your guests pay $10 for entry. If you're lucky, you can request a table on the main dance floor, and actually get it...we sure did!  ...and back to the review... My wife's best friend booked a package to get another table to accommodate more people and requested to have it near our table. So, we had two round tables on one side and a comfy booth style bench on the other, right next to the ""Liquor"" sign bar. And two cakes!! What more could you ask for?!  Also, if you have any concerns, questions, comments, Manny, the party planner, is available throughout the night. I didn't actually meet him, but I was asking questions through texts and he responded within 10 minutes. For example, it was about 12:30 and I asked about the cake...5 minutes later, he text me back saying that it should be at the table in a short while....5 minutes later...the cake arrived in a box with some paper plates and a cake knife!! Sweet!!  I would say if you have a group of people, want to dance but also, want to have somewhere to sit down, get the party package at Green Dolphin Street. I would recommend hosting a party here for a good time. Drinks The package does not include drinks, but for a screwdriver and a jack and coke it was $15. Not bad...it could be worse....it could be $15 for just one drink! Drinks are ok; it depends on who you get as a bartender. If you stick to beer, you are ok. If you get simple drinks like jack and cokes or screwdrivers, you'll be ok. This is the only reason I'm not giving it five stars. My drinks were kinda shitty, but still drinkable and allowed me to get a nice buzz.  Ambiance This particular Saturday night...it was about 65% latino, 15% African American, 15% white, and 5% other (Asian, Middle Eastern, European). Since, our 30+ people (cuz that's how we roll, bitchez!!) were all of mixed heritage we were fine. If a mixed crowd makes you antsy and insecure, then don't bitch about it when you get here.  You are going to find your meatheads, shitsacks, and douchebags here, as with any club. But you will also find people who don't bother anyone else and tend to stick with their group...safety in numbers. I did not see one fight break out throughout the club. The security are on top of their game and actually doing there job here and making their rounds going through the crowd.  Yes, there is a dress code. Girls, you're ok with wearing jeans with a club top. You will be let in unless your all ""thug-bitch"" with chach aquanet-hair, spider leg-eyelashes, hoochie black lipstick, and baggy clothes.  Guys, don't look thugged out and you will be let in: make sure your jeans are not baggy, you're not wearing a big T-Pain chain, cap or tshirt. Better yet, wear dress pants and a collared shirt and you're a shoe in. Speaking of shoes, don't wear sneakers, or skechers or timbalands or your ass will out in the cold and Shit outta luck (SOL). Wear some sleak and cool dress shoes. Dress to muthafukn impress!  Yes, it is fk'n loud... it's a dance club, not an uppity pretentious frou frou restaurant. If you want to have some witty conversation about your blog, take your lame ass to a lounge! If you want music that makes you want to shake your ass, while inebriated and yell ""Oh, shit, remember this tune?! Yeeeeeeeeeah!!""...then this will happen here. Also, it gets kind hazy when they start the fog machine, which is cool when you are inebriated.  The décor is cool. I remember it was somewhat dark wooden accents and it surprised me that it was a large area....the main dance area is pretty large and the salsa room is pretty spacious as well. There is a coat check, $2 per coat behind the entrance bar.  Music Top 40, Hip-hop, rock, triphop, house, and rock mashups. DJ Flipside was there at 2am doing his thing. Freakin' awesome!

2008-08-29,4.0,"I've been going to Green Dolphin Street for years for any number of reasons. The first time I was introduced to GDS I didn't even know it was a jazz club. I was there with a bevy of other poseurs for a GQ magazine event. Unfortunately the faux ""gold"" sponsoring vodka made me feel as if I'd been hit by a mac truck the next morning. It was not a good thing, but the service during the event and the venue itself intrigued me enough that I knew I wanted to go back ... and at least hear some great music and drink REAL premium liquor. I've been to other corporate events, private functions, birthday parties, birthday dinners and simply for a night of dining. The huge space is remarkably intimate, or can be, due in part to the different areas that fill the space. I'm always a sucker for Pan-seared Scallops and GDS does them as well as anyone. The accompanying roasted saffron corn sauce goes a long way to my desire for it. The sweetness of the roasted corn plays nicely with the sea sweetness of the scallops and somehow the sear is heightened by the heady saffron. The dish is rounded out with buttered endives and an oil of chervil couli. I also appreciate the care taken in roasting vegetables for Roasted Vegetable Fondue. The fondue itself is an unctuous sauce of three different cheeses that complements that caramelization of the perfectly roasted seasonal vegetables.  Steak is the name of the game at this venue, take your pick from Chateaubriand Diana for Two [impossible to resist for an anniversary] or Peppercorn Filet; a personal favorite, however, is the Caribbean Steak, skirt steak marinated in ginger, soy and spices and grilled to your specifications. Sides are on the side, so to speak, and come in small or large. Standards include vegetables and starches, but the Truffled Mac - n - Cheese is the route to go here, particularly if you get he Peppercorn Filet. Garlic Potatoes Moussaline are another fine choice. For dessert, the Chef's Tasting Surprise has been a disappointment on more than one occasion; opt instead for Brandy & Banana Crepes or Chocolate Liqueur Crème Brûlée. Check out the website for information on shows and be mindful of the dress code which can be strictly enforced, depending on who the maitre d' is. Better safe than sorry.

My boyfriend at the time was wearing a freakin' $100 Lacoste polo and I had a Chanel purse...and we can't get in?!) Anyways! We got in for free and it was pretty empty when we first got here around 11pm. The bar itself is nothing too special, just big open rooms with some bars and few tables to sit at. However, there is an outside patio that is right on the river, which is quite nice. The DJ was spinning some pretty good House...which isn't my favorite but it's better than Techno. The place soon filled up and all these people were busting out their house dance moves and what not. Most of the dancers were really good. Especially the Asian girls...they were really busting out the footwork! People were break dancing, legs flying in the air...I thought I was about to get kicked in the head!!  The place started to get really packed and around 12:30 or so they opened up a room right off of the entrance that was filled with strobe lights and smoke, etc. The music was definitely bumpin. There were some fine guys there for sure, and some gay and lesbian couples too. It was a pretty interesting mix of people.  Sadly, I had to work the next day so I couldn't get really drunk and stay out late. But it is open until 4 on Mondays, which is awesome.

MUSIC: Excellent music if you like jazz (band playing that day was ""yoko noge and the jazz me blues band"").  Cover fee on Friday was $15 (i think the price depends on which day you're going, no cover fees on Tue, Thu, Sun).

I haven't checked their wine list. Boom Boom Room on Monday night there used to be off the m'freakin chain. The few times I went within the last few months though, it has cooled down. Still more hoppin than anywhere you can go on Monday, but just a little less packed. I was told that the Music 101 (house/electronic music organizer) had split up with the Boom Boom room music promoters and set up their own Monday party now at Vision.  When Music 101 and Boom Boom were combined, the place rocked with two rooms. The back room, which is somewhat of a tent enclosed area had more downtempo house. There would be great break dancing and rave dancers doing some tight moves in the center of a circle of people watching and cheering them on. No other atmosphere like this anywhere in Chicago. Even without Music 101, the place will probably still be bumpin on Mondays. Especially when Summer kicks in. If you like a Crobar-type club atmosphere, you may be disappointed. Not to say nobody has ever gotten any action at Boom Boom, but the crowd is definately more about dancing, than 'hooking up"".

The service staff looks and acts very professional. We started off with some Evian water and I had the pinot noir while the bf got a guinness; both were tasty. One thing about fine dining is that I always feel pressured to order an entree, but being vegetarian, I'm very limited on my options. I was toying with the idea of ordering the chicken, as it was free range. There was also the option of the Mahi Mahi or the Ahi Tuna Loin. I decided to skip all those and go with the North Beach salad, which also had chicken in it. The bf got some sauteed mushrooms and scallops, along with some asparagus. All was pretty good, although I was hoping for more from the chicken as I so seldom eat it.  In the middle of eating, this man comes up and says he wants our honest answer/opinion regarding whether or not we would be willing to move to a different table on account of the hostess seating us in a reserved party section. He said he would buy us dessert, even. Okay, we say. I try to speed up my pace--I'm quite the slow eater. He comes back saying he's sorry, but he needs to move us now, and he will even throw in drinks. Shortly after moving to our new location, I got up to use the bathroom. Ugghh!!!

It was almost 5 minutes until we flagged down our waiter and then he gave us the names of the cheeses etc. Our ceasar salad followed and we couldn't detect any dressing on it. So, after another 3-5 minute wait, we managed to get our waiter's attention and have some extra dressing brought to us. It was a very good salad after we added the dressing. The biggest dissapointment was that when I made the reservation on open table, I did note that we were celebrating a birthday. I then verbally reminded the hostess when we got there and she said she would inform our waiter. Well, we ordered dessert and ... NOTHING. No candle, nothing. I was realy not pleased.

We had a dinner reservation at 9:30 but upon entering the place, there was a great band playing in the main room so we stood at the bar and had a cocktail so that we could listen for awhile.   Some people were dancing and others were clustered around small tables set up in front of the stage.   It looked like an old time dance/music hall. The bar was beautiful with old wood paneling and the drinks were perfectly poured. Moving into the dining room- it was a bit more formal- white linen table cloths, green walls and art deco inspired light fixtures.   Interestingly enough you could not hear the music from here which was a little disappointing as I guess I thought we were going to be able to eat and listen to some jazz.  (I asked about this and was told there is the formal dining room that we were in and if you want to eat and listen to music, you can order from the ""club menu"" in the main room- simpler bar food is how it was described) The food was good and the service attentive.  We ordered simply; steaks and the standard side fare which was all good.  The standout was the ""steak and a cake"" which came with a crabcake that was very good although it could have had a little less breading on it.  The heirloom tomato salad (caprese) was delicious.  They also have a nice wine list including some reserve labels.  We had no less than 3 people waiting on us and all were personable and pleasant even though we were the last table of the night. After dinner- we wanted to go back into the main room to listen to the music but as we ventured back to the main room, the whole bar had undergone a transformation while we were eating.  Gone were the tables and chairs,  gone was the glassware.  In their place in the large front room was now a dance club  and in the back room salsa dancing was underway.  Drinks were now served in plastic cups and the average age had dropped by 15 years!  When I asked the manager about it- he said that it was a weekend thing that they ""turned"" the bar at 11:00pm, but the good news was that we could stay and dance til 5:00am.  FIVE AM???  Who knew? My expectations for this place were very different from what I experienced.  While I thought it was a jazz club (and I am sure it was back in the day) it now has to turn into a dance club to survive.  The lines to get in went all around the building and with a $20 cover on the weekends and pricey drinks, I suspect they are doing okay.  I need to go back on another night to see if I can better match my expectations to the reality of this place.  I know it's a place for great music- I just need to find it and it is obvious that late on a weekend night is not the right time.

However, the food is ridiculously overpriced. $12 for a cheese plate which contained four small bits of cheese that were not even that good. Yikes! Another one of those restaurants that thinks they're so high class that they're gonna charge high class prices (also see Reza's). Unfortunately, the complete lack of innovation in their food cannot justify their prices. The food is quite good but pretty traditional; for these prices I want to taste something new.  We sat first in the restaurant area which was very nice and while ou could hear the jazz from the jazz lounge, it was at a good volume for conversation. Then we moved down to the jazz club area which is very large.

2006-04-30,5.0,"I went to the Green Dolphin Room restaurant and club last Wednesday for a meal and to listen to some swing jazz!! The reason for the evening was that my Dad was visiting from UK and is keen on swing jazz and had heard that Chicago was the place for this music. Not being a genre of music I know much about I had to enlist the help of my wife to find and book a venue that would play decent music and have reasonable food.  Green Dolphin St fits that bill. The food whilst not exception is pretty well cooked and served. The bill is slightly heavy given the quality but it is worth the food being a little expensive for what it is to enjoy a great evening. If you eat you avoid the $20 cover charge. The band playing were The Rhythm Rockets, they were great, got everyone dancing and jiving about and what's more they play in Naperville to which suits me better.
