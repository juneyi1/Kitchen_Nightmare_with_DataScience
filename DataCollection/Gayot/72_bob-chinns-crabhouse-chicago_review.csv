They also have a room for private parties in the back.  The decor is great, not too cheesy.",0.9892,0.592,0.408,0.0,0.6486363636363637

The portions are huge, but they're so tasty you won't have a problem eating it all up! Check out their bar specials on weeknights -- they have soemthing different all the time.",0.9046,0.756,0.244,0.0,0.77
