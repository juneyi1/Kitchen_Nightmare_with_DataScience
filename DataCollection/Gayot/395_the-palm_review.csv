2017-07-27,2.0,"We arrived at the restaurant about 5 minutes early for our reservation and were seated.  After about 5 minutes, the server (Adam) came to our table and asked if we wanted drinks.  My wife asked for a black napkin, and we ordered drinks, two iced teas.  This immediately seemed to change the attitude of the server, who after an additional 10 minutes returned to take our orders, no drinks or bread with him.  We reminded him about the iced teas and black napkin.  We were with another couple also an 837 member with whom we have dined at your Chicago and the now closed Northbrook location many times.  Our two wives ordered prime rib; My friend's wife was very specific in saying she didn't want hers put on the grill to make it medium, just wanted it off the roast, but medium.  She stated this at least three times.  The bus boy brought water and we asked for bread; it was now almost 20 minutes after being seated, and finally he brought the bread.   About ten minutes after taking the order, Adam returned to say there was only one prime rib left.  My wife said to give it to our friend and ordered a bone-in rib eye.  By this point, we were wondering if Adam was ignoring us, but after another ten minutes, our salads arrived.  After eating the salads, we waited about fifteen minutes for our entrees.   While waiting, another table that had arrived after we did received their entrees from their server and were having their lobster cracked.  Our entrees arrived, the prime rib was obviously reheated on the grill or oven, and there was nobody to crack our lobster.  Adam tried to justify that the prime rib wasn't on the grill but was covered when placed on the grill. She returned her meal and lost her appetite.  While this discussion was taking place, nobody came to crack our lobsters, so I went to the front and spoke to the two manager/maître D's and asked for someone to come and crack our lobsters.  By now they had been sitting on the table for almost ten minutes.  Someone came shortly after to crack them, a very nice bus boy, the only person who treated us well all evening. One of the managers came over and listened to our concerns regarding the service and the food, and kept saying OK.  Then the general manager Phil came over and basically was making excuses and getting upset with us.  I showed Phil a section of my lobster that was a combination of meat and black liquid that was very unappealing.  I have eaten lobster at the Palm and elsewhere and never had this black liquid mixing with my meat.  There is always black that is inedible, but it is not liquefied and mixing with the meat of the lobster.  Phil came back later and said your meal is on us in a snippy voice and walked away. This wasn't our first visit to this restaurant, but will be our last, in fact, we have been eating at the restaurant for over 20 years.  Poor service, poor food, and arrogant management are not acceptable.",-0.8851,0.918,0.031,0.05,0.40272988505747126

This is a great place to come for a business lunch during the day. I'll definitely be dining here again. * Chicken Parm is suppose to be a signature dish of The Palm so I had to try it. It was a generous portion size and tasted delicious. Had the right cheese to sauce ratio. 4 stars * Sea Bass was the fish of the day and it gets two thumbs up. 4 stars * Lobster Salad was beyond amazing.

2017-05-29,1.0,"This was the most disappointing meal of my recent Chicago trip -- by far. I went for lunch while attending a convention at the Grand Sheraton across the river. Had the lunch special with a salad, filet medallions, half/half veggie choice (half cottage fries, half onion strings), dessert (which I never got) and iced tea. The whole bill was around $40. The good things: *The blue cheese salad dressing was the most delicious blue cheese dressing I may have ever had. The starter salad was delicious, as a result of that awesome dressing that was obviously made in house.  The bad things: *The food other than the salad. The steak was not tasty at all. Very chewy and flavorless in spite of the medium cooking temp. Ate one of the two medallions and called it a day. Weird that the sautéed onion/pepper steak side comes out on a half piece of soggy white toast. The half cottage fries, half onion strings selection was plugged as a house speciality, but there wasn't anything special about them. Same quality/flavor you could get at any neighborhood bar.  *The service. My server wasn't attentive. Another server I saw seemed to be a lot more attentive, friendly, and present for her customers. (I was sad I didn't get that server.) I had an empty iced tea glass for most of my meal. I didn't feel like a priority with the slow, inattentive service. After I pushed aside the leftover steak and side, I explained to my server that I needed my check quickly and my dessert (which was included in the lunch special) to go due to the short time I had left to eat (I had to go back to the conference). She seemed to understand and brought my check immediately, which was great. But then after 10+ minutes and not seeing her again, I just couldn't wait anymore -- had to get back to my conference. I told the table next to me they could have my dessert when/if it arrived.  *The decor. It doesn't transmit the feeling of ""upscale restaurant"" to me. It communicates more of a bar/sandwich/family restaurant feel, at least in the part of the restaurant I was in. I appreciate that the way it looks is probably a tradition, but there is a way to respect your past, not look like a trendy restaurant, and still reflect the fine dining theme in your decor (see Bern's Steakhouse in Tampa, FL).  *I maybe should have left after I was initially seated by someone who didn't speak to me at all while guiding me to a table until I asked him how his day was going, and even then he seemed to want to be anyplace other than at that job. I wonder if there is a staff morale/training problem? Won't return.",0.9411,0.868,0.081,0.052,0.44743935309973043
2017-05-18,4.0,"My husband and I were recently married and because we didn't take a traditional honeymoon, we decided to spend the weekend in Chicago at the Swissotel for a ""honey weekend"". We chose to dine at The Palm for our dinner date because of it's convenience being at the hotel. We also knew going into our weekend that we were willing to splurge and we certainly did with this dinner.  We started with an apple martini for my husband, a glass of pinot grigio for myself, and the calamari appetizer. It was a large portion and very tasty. I didn't care much for the marinara sauce that came with it though. For our entrees I had a weekend special.. $49 for a small lobster tail and the 9oz filet. Considering the regular menu price for the 9oz filet alone is $48.50, this was a great deal! The lobster, which came with drawn butter, was delicious and my steak was (mostly) cooked to my liking. I ordered medium rare and it came a little over that, but it was still very good, although it was underseasoned. I am not one to typically add more salt to my food, but really felt like I needed to with the steak. My husband had the 14oz filet and also felt his was underseasoned. He also ordered his steak medium rare and while I found mine to be slightly over, his was cooked much under, almost to a rare. He didn't mind too much though and said it was still good. For our side dishes, we ordered a shared portion of the au gratin potatoes and an individual side of creamed spinach. The potatoes were a big hit. They were delicious! Unfortunately the spinach was just blah. Again, underseasoned and just not impressive. For being a ""signature item"", I expected more. The individual portion size is on the larger size, with the shared side not being much larger. It was still plenty for us though considering all of the other food we had ordered. We were offered a dessert menu, but chose after dinner drinks instead. My husband had an apple martini and I had a french kiss martini from the drink menu. He liked his; I hated mine. Mine was supposed to be made with Chambord Raspberry Liqueur, Kahlua Coffee Liqueur, Bailey's Irish Cream, and fresh-brewed espresso, but all I tasted was coffee. And I like coffee, but it was just too much.  When we received our bill, we were pleasantly surprised that our after dinner drinks were complimentary to celebrate our recent marriage. Super nice gesture! Even after the $29 in drinks removed, our total with tip still came to $220. Much more expensive than we will ever normally spend on a dinner.  The service was attentive, and our waitress was super nice. Our food came out quickly, possibly a little too quick as we wanted to enjoy our evening, but I never felt too rushed either. I didn't care for the pushiness of joining the club they have there, but I assume that's just a requirement of the job. I also didn't care for the decor with the characters all over the walls. It somehow made it feel less romantic and fancy.  Overall, it was a really good experience. Because it's an extremely rare occurence for us to drop that kind of money on a dinner night out, I don't think we would return. And if we were willing to splurge again, I think there are other places that we would like to try for a similar price point.",0.997,0.811,0.146,0.043,0.5422310510002817

That is after all most important. I had the NY strip, cooked perfectly, very good. Hash Browns were great, salads fresh and good, no complaint about the food. The ambiance however is bad. Kind of dead, no feeing of a fine Chicago Steak House. Service was good, but it felt almost overly good due to so few people in the restaurant.  The atmosphere is more chain like middle of the road place than a fine dining steak house.

For dessert, I had the cheesecake.  That was probably the best part of the meal.  I really liked the raspberry sauce on it.   Overall, the food wasn't great but the biggest issue I had was with the presentation and plating.  It was EXTREMELY sloppy and inconsistent. I had two co workers who ordered the chicken parm.  One of theirs literally took up the whole plate while the other was tiny.  We couldn't help but laugh.  Also, it looked like none of the plates were wiped if sauce was splattered all over them.

The chicken was tasteless the sauce was okay. About half way through my chicken I got this large crunch in my bite. Though hmm okay random but just swallow and move on. Well the next 3 bites has the same crunch so I spit out the pieces and layer on edge of plate for the chef. Once waiter came to remove plates I explained to her that she may want to tell chef about it. Waiter came back and said the chef said it was a peppercorn! I'm sorry I am full aware of what a peppercorn is and this was not that.  No discount and no visit from the chef to table nothing.

The clam linguine. $26.00, The noodles were cooked right but I thought that the clams were very tough and the sauce could have had more favor.

We walked in and decided to have dinner at the bar. Mike, the bartender, came over and greeted us right away. He made recommendations accordingly for both food and drinks, he was really friendly, very attentive to our needs, and, most importantly, very knowledgeable about the items on the menu. He also mentioned that he's been working there for over 7 years! This tells me that the Palm must really value their employees and treat them well - impressive. We ordered some drinks (one was an EXCELLENT red wine recommended by Mike) and the other was an Oktoberfest beer. No mixed cocktails for us that night so, unfortunately, I cannot speak to the quality of his mixologist skills.  We ordered the Prime New York Strip, charred, and the Three Cheese Potatoes Au Gratin. Wow, the steak was amazing. It was cooked to perfection just like we ordered, medium rare in the middle and charred on the outside. I was told that this is hard to perfect by my friend who wanted to order it this way. I had never had steak like that but I'm certainly a fan now. The potatoes were equally tasty! Cheesy, carb-y goodness.  Though I do not think this is the BEST steak I've had at a Chicago restaurant, it's definitely the best in this specific neighborhood. Overall, a great meal indeed!

2015-07-12,2.0,"The service was abrupt and brash. During the entire extent of our dinner, employees were literally running throughout the restaurant. Two plates (not ours) were dropped in a ten minute span, for example. This wouldn't have been okay at a fast casual spot (which this place looks a lot like until you get your food), never mind an eatery where a steak for me and a piece of fish for my guest cost about $100 total. It was a 'whirlwind' experience of the worst kind, and I still can't understand why the employees were in such a hurry. The only concession being that I didn't have to spend all that long in the booth, my back supported by bare wood. The food was amazing but expensive. The seafood was expensive compared to the seafood places I've been to in Chicago and the steak was expensive compared to the steakhouses I've been to in Chicago. Mostly, though, we were just left chuckling after the bizarre service. Usually when you pay this much you are paying for atmosphere, service, and (perhaps) prestige, in addition to quality of food. Not here. I often see reviews were people complain about receiving inferior levels of service after not ordering alcohol, and I suspect that to have played some part in the service I received here. Judging from our waitress's response to us not ordering cocktails, I was quick to go on the defensive and mention that I wasn't yet 21 when she asked if we'd like wine with dinner. That wasn't successful though, because she didn't once check up on us until our empty plates had been taken away.",-0.829,0.849,0.065,0.085,0.5793209876543209
2015-07-07,2.0,"I actually really liked this place. Except two things. Price and snobbery.  It was attached to our hotel. Extremely pricey for what you get. I am not being frugal when I say pricey either. 3 lb lobster? 75 bucks. Um, why? I mean come on. Filet mignon normally goes for around 45-50 at a nice restaurant, their's? 68 if I recall correctly. Want a side? You purchase them separately. The cost of your food item which is already high does not include anything else. That said, I ordered crab cakes for 60 some dollars. It came with chopped mango, and in fairness it seemed like freshly pulled crab meat. They were tender, flavorful, not salty (as they can tend to be), and didn't taste like they sat in a fryer. I was pleased. My boyfriend got the Veal Parmesan. Again, just the veal, no pasta. 47. He loved it. Tender, flavorful. We split a side of goat cheese mashed potatoes. Again, very good. Goat cheese complimented it very well and it need no gravy, a perfect stand alone side dish.  We got the mixed drinks which were also very well blended, tasted better then most places I've been to. Easy down, but the price for the amount you got (maybe 4-5oz?), again hard to swallow.  We brought a key lime pie home to eat later, it was delicious. However, one thing that really put us off besides the daylight robbery prices was our waiter. He seemed to ignore us. Granted we were dressed in green because we were enjoying the St. Patrick's day river dying and parade from earlier, but I got the distinct feeling that he didn't appreciate us being there. It was just us two, eating quietly. We weren't some rowdy college spring breakers that were running around in the lobby across the restaurant in the hotel. He never came over to see how we were doing, nor refilled our drinks, and seemed to cater to the two tables next to us without fail. I'm not sure if this was punishment for asking the price of the lobster (which wasn't marked), but we tip 10-20% without fail depending on service, I think he was under the assumption that we were cheap skates that couldn't afford to be there. That kinda of ruined some of our experience honestly.

On a positive note, again my businessman's lunch was a great deal, my chicken parmesan entrée was delicious, the side of vegetables (zucchini and squash) was also delicious, and the other restaurant personnel were exceptionally friendly (they smile, they say hi and they clearly remember me even though I never understand how they remember me from prior visits).",0.9876,0.724,0.221,0.055,0.5323796791443849
2015-06-30,4.0,"Review is for lunch only. The Palm is an old-time steakhouse that is intent on mixing the traditional steakhouse feel with a chummy vibe.  To that end, they have waiters in white jackets juxtaposed against caricatures of clients of the restaurants (more on this in a moment). Lunch here is great.  The burgers are thick and substantial, with a generous helping of fries.  At $15 it offers good value for the size/quality.  The salads are also good.  The ahi tuna salad ($20) was great -- the fish is sliced thinly (like smoked salmon) and a generous portion is layered on top of the salad.  A nice change from the standard piece of grilled tuna that is usually a bit dry.  They also offer a 3-course meal for $24 which is a nice value for those with big appetites. Service is professional, as befitting a steakhouse of this quality.   What didn't I like?  I'm not a fan of soft drinks served out of small glass bottles.  While I understand that they can charge more for refills, it is also environmentally unfriendly.  Also, back to the caricatures...it was a little unnerving to have Bill Cosby smiling on the wall.  The dude is alleged to have raped about 30 women...time for his portrait to come down.",0.9791,0.781,0.171,0.048,0.4601495726495726

Veal martini smothered with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  Good feedback from company on Chilean Sea Bass.

Dessert was the flour-less dark chocolate torte with creme anglais. Rich & bitter sweet.

Since Bergoff's closed can you remember any restaurant, anywhere, that didn't serve you for a paycheck or a tip, but because they were pros?  I can't.  Can you recall a place where in the city, in recent times, where the management, all of them, walks the floor all night casually, again not for a check, but because they love what they do, asking how things are?  I can't.  Can you remember bartenders that were pros?  I mean real pros?  Bartenders who brought their A game even if no one cared?  And didnt let a shite crowd take them down?   If you can't I just saw it.  I haven't been to the Palm in 9 months and I am a moron.  There really is honor in the restaurant business, people who earn an honest, and good living, because they are pros, all stars in fact.  This is so rare, a lost art, and when my wife and I hit the Palm Saturday 11/23 it was game time. Do you remember the last time you saw a service symphony?  People who cared, up and down, people who loved what they did, loved the drinks they made, made menu recommendations because they know their work not for tips, but for love?  It was so great to watch this place play out in a sort of symphonic melody and bring their A plus game throughout.   A great meal, and a great time after at the bar.  I can't say enough, and this review is so long I said too much, so one quick example and I will leave you alone, finally.  We had an amazing meal, augmented by a server who heard my wife and I debating red v. white wine and came back with two carafes of amazing wine saying you are both right. then we got to the bar after, and there were some complete imbecile school board convention people being mean to a bartender who brought an a plus game.  Their issue?  Every third drink should be free. Really, when this is not a bartender, but a true craftsman, a real artist, who was probably under charging for some amazing drinks.   What I found totally amazing, so awesome, was shaking off a couple of morons trying for free drinks our bartender was polite, funny, engaging, and amazingly creative, and we had a blast.   I will not be a stranger.  Unreal good lobster, an amazing filet, creamed spinach to die for.  I get it, you can get this somewhere else.  But served by pros?  People who like what they do ?  Who know their industry?  Doubtful.  This is a great place, and an even greater crew.  Please try this place if you havent, and ignore the next big new thing if you have, just this one time.,.  What an amazing experience.",0.9995,0.682,0.258,0.06,0.5574162114340684

The Palm is not my top choice for a hot date or a girl's night out as it still has an air of ""boys club"" to it no matter what city you're in (surely intentional?), but its great for business meetings, and any other time you really don't want to put much thought into where to go, but want to know exactly what to expect with a solid meal and solid service.",0.9028,0.804,0.146,0.05,0.4475925925925926

It was quite a big sandwich, was very filling and very good!  My boyfriend got the 3-course power lunch, which was very tasty and filling as well. The first course, a mixed green salad, was your standard salad - no complaints. He ordered the Atlantic salmon fillet as his main course which was very good, served with fries/friend onion strips and a mango salsa. We chose the NY-style cheesecake for dessert which was extremely rich topped with a choice of fruit.  This place was great to be at on a Saturday afternoon drinking wine and having a great lunch!

First of all the service was terrific!  The bartenders Michela and Antonio were on their game, making me the perfect dirty martini and even accommodating my late night requests for ice cream and port (a little indulgence of mine!)  You can't help but notice the walls are covered with caricatures of local people who visit often and with enough visits- you, too, can have your face smiling down at others in the bar!   Just ask the bartenders how!  The dining area is typical Chicago old school steak house with it's dark wood tables, white table cloths and servers who know their stuff.  If there was a hiccup with me- it was when I asked if there was a special and the server went through this amazing description and then at the end of her soliloquy she tells me I can't have it unless I am an 837 member (their frequent dining club).  My advice- save me the time and description in the future and only tell me what I can eat!   But that hiccup aside- our food came up quickly and was perfectly prepared.  For our starter we had the shrimp in a lemon sauce (3 to an order but they were great in accommodating our request for 4 so it was easier for the two of us to split it)  For our entrees- we split the bone in strip and the ahi tuna grilled.  The nice part here was that they split it in the kitchen for us so there was none of that hassle at the table. And for dessert?  The key lime pie was tart and creamy- just like it should be. The wine list is quite nice (even by the glass) and the manager stopped over a couple of times just to make sure all was well. There are plenty of steakhouses in Chicago to choose from.  I had forgotten about the Palm but you can bet with the great service I received, I will be back.  Even if it's just to have a night cap with a couple of the friendliest bartenders around!  Thanks Michela and Antonio for making my visits so memorable!",0.997,0.809,0.168,0.023,0.5549231150793651

2013-12-25,3.0,"The Palm in the Swissotel - Chicago, Illinois ... 3 stars: Rated by Chicago Magazine as one of the Top 10 steak houses in Chicago. Went on Christmas Eve and had a very nice time. Would be a 3  1/2 star review if allowed, but 3 will have to do because of a few little things.  Great location on the first floor of the hotel. Access from outside or inside is easy, valet parking at the door. All the staff were wonderful. As you come in you are greeted by the long bar where you can settle in or even have your meal...nice setting. The restaurant rooms are next to the bar and the ambiance is very cozy. Numerous pictures of Chicago glitterati adorn the walls. If you spend enough money in food and beverage at a Palm restaurant, you can have your caricature put up on the wall of that location - cute touch. So what kept the rating down? It was really simple little things, because if you are going to charge 5-star prices you have to have a 5-star operation in every way. The food was very nice at this pricey steakhouse (i.e. $100 to $150 per) ... YET - 1. The wet-aged steaks were very tender and perfect temperature, but they lacked that char one usually gets on a prime piece of Midwestern beef. Two of us split a double-cut NY strip - nice size and butterflied to have it pink but there was little char on the outside - it was more just grey. 2. One of our party had two glasses of red wine - different reds and the waiter simply poured the second into the same glass as the first. 3. Waiter forgot the soft drink one of our party requested. 4. Bathroom is about a mile away. 5. Mixed drinks weren't very generous.  The rest - Delicious bacon-wrapped scallops...very nice shrimp cocktail...nice creamed spinach...perfect three-cheese au gratin potatoes...excellent bread...bone-in filet was very good, albeit a tad overdone...wonderful 3 lbs Nova Scotia lobster. Nice wine selections, many by the glass or bottle. Dessert selections made for a nice sweet course - no surprises here just the usual. All-in-all this was a fun experience.

I personally prefer more lobster in my soup but it was still a nice touch.

The others enjoyed their sandwiches and the little one at our table ate 4 pieces of the sourdough and the pumpkin? bread from the bread basket. Serving sizes were decent. Prices were reasonable.

I kept thinking perhaps the Palm was a big deal in the 80's with yuppies.  I could just see brokers with pin stripe shirts and movado watches enjoying this venue.  The celebrity caricatures are mixed with wealthy clients, usually families who have bought their painting on the wall firmly establishing themselves as a-holes.  Congrats Feldman family. Our waiters first language was not English.  I think the entire table missed his entire run down of the especiales.  Nothing against him, great staff, but I could not understand a word he said all night.   The big question, how was the steak.  It's why you come here, its what their reputation is really based on.  I ordered the New York Strip, they also have a bone in rib eye and filet that were recommended.  I have to say the steak was just ok.  Slightly better than a chain steakhouse, but pales in comparison anyone who buys a good cut from a butcher and makes themselves.  I would compare it to a steak at a wedding or maybe an Italian restaurant not know for their steaks.   The Palm was probably great when Miami Vice was the hot new show, but today the Palm is an overpriced waste of a night out.  So many other choices, in better locations, better decor, better staff, and a much much better steak.",0.992,0.795,0.181,0.024,0.4783389450056117

For obvious reasons I stuck with champagne and decided to skip the food offered. The portion sizes that everyone got  were so large that it was a complete turnoff for me. The lobsters were the size of small dogs. So each person was presented with a plate containing an oversized lobster and a steak. I'm not a vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination but it was disgusting. I tried a piece of my sisters lobster...it was like chewing rubber. Quantity over quality is the theme here. Typical sides were present. I had that bite of lobster and spent the rest of the time getting buzzed on champagne. The waiter was uncharismatic. I was bored. I took a few laps around the restaurant to see what the crowd was like. Old hotel guests at the bar.  Couples on dates..the guy probably trying to be impressive by taking her to the palm when in reality its cliche and boring.  There are SO many other better steak places (if you must have a steak place) in chicago.  I returned to my party, after finding no one interesting to talk to. The dinner dragged on. Dessert and coffee were ordered. Because after gorging on meat and complaining about how stuffed you are the logical thing would be to order oversized portions of dessert and coffee. The most logical thing for me at that time was to keep sipping champagne and hope this all ended soon. It eventually did. Valet took forever to get the car.

Since we were coming from River East 21 (just couldn't do sushi after a movie for the millionth time :-p) and were hoping for something different. When we arrived (it was around 3:00, we had forgone lunch for some popcorn, but were definitely hungry for a late lunch) we were greeted rather coldly by the hostess. We asked to see a menu and she couldn't have seemed less interested. Once we decided that we were going to dine here, she promptly seated us. First off, the decor. When I walked in, I wasn't sure if I was in a cool, classic steakhouse with the mahogany benches or a TGI Fridays with a lot of mixed, tacky drawings on the wall. The drawings were a mixed bag of local Chicago celebrity caricatures and some olde time-y caricatures (think 1940's). Whatever. Secondly, the appetizer. We ordered some ahi tuna. Wow. I think this was the WORST ahi tuna appetizer I've ever had (and I've been to some pretty funky mid-western ""sushi"" restaurants in my day). My dining partner and I simply couldn't get past the first bite.  Third, the entrees. I was a little annoyed that the sides to the steaks were a la carte. But whatever. Again, when I go to a hotel restaurant, I know what my wallet has committed to. What WAS annoying was that none of the sides were exactly appropriate for a hot summer day. Really, goat cheese potatoes, 3 cheese potatoes, etc? You can't adjust that for summer months? The fillet I got was actually quite good! Very well cooked and hit the spot.  Lastly was the service. Our waiter seemed cool, but it took FOREVER to get the check. Now at 3:30 in the afternoon with MAYBE 10 people in total in the restaurant, this was just unacceptable. I can only imagine what it would be like on a BUSY night. There are plenty of other steakhouses in Chicago, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

The entrees were varied but all were enjoyed- three steaks, a filet (mine- yum!), a rib-eye (hubbies) and the New York (sister Teresa S) were all cooked to perfection. Teresa ordered the chimichurri sauce which contained tomatoes (odd!) so they switched it for the brandy peppercorn, which neither of us really needed as the steak was fine on its own. The rest of the crew ordered the chicken parmesan (demolished by the uncle), the ahi tuna (loved by the friend) and the ladies had the lobster Cobb salad, which tempted me as well.

2011-05-25,4.0,"I recently planned a surprise party for my best friend here. I invited 8 other girls, including myself and called 3 days before to make a reservation. I knew my chances of actually having a table were very slim, especially for a large group, but luckily I was able to reserve a huge table with an amazing view of Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier. I asked the girl on the phone if they could do anything ""special"" for the birthday girl, besides ordering her first drink (she was turning 21), and they told me they could get us a free complimentary chocolate cake + candles. Great, right!? The day of the party came, and everything looked great. Tables were pulled together and enough chairs for everyone. Our view was great and we were all seated by a huge window. Planning a surprise party is hard, especially when so many people are invited, and time is crucial.  The good: The food was delicious! Our waiter started us off with what seemed like a starter tray, which included one shrimp, one tuna, and one crab meat for each plate. All three items were delish, but the tuna was my ultimate favorite. Later on, 3 of us ordered appetizers (which are quite huge and were enough for 9 hungry girls) and they were all delicious. I believe I ordered the fried asparagus which was yummy. Our other two appetizers were the mushrooms and fried potato with cheese. I can't pick a favorite out of these, but the mushroom and potato are definitely the best appetizers. When it came to ordering our main dish, every girl picked what they wanted, some ended up getting steak burgers, while other had the veal. I ended up getting the mixed green salad, which was great, no complaints here. I figured that with the appetizers I would fill myself up. The bad: When we began ordering, we asked the waiter for separate checks. Each girl wanted to pay for what they ordered, and we also wanted to all pitch it for the birthday's girl order + drink. When the bill finally came, we saw this huge amount in one single bill. No separate checks were brought, and we were really confused. When we asked the waiter for our options, he said he could divide the amount into 9 people. Great. He came back with 9 checks of about 40-70 dollars each. He said there was no way to divide the checks fairly, because the appetizers were for all the table. This caused a lot of confusion because people ended up paying MORE than expected, and some girls were paying more than others. In the whole midst of confusion, the chocolate cake that was supposed to be FREE got charged... so we go back to the waiter and ask for everything to be revised. The waiter ended up telling us there was no way to split the bill equally, so we all ended up paying more than we would have liked. I had water + appetizer + and a salad, and my amount could have been less than 30, however, I payed 55. It was just an unfair situation that the restaurant could have handled better.  Overall, lesson was learned. This place is nice, elegant and has delicious food (which is why I'm still giving it a good rating). However, if you are coming with a big group, make sure to get separate orders and better yet, make sure you have credit cards and financially stable. Don't bring people who can't afford more than a $30-50 meal here, or you will experience a lot of awkwardness. This place is pricey, and throwing a dinner party with a bunch of college kids was a bad idea. Other details: -This place is connected to a hotel lounge/lobby place, so it is an alternative option to hang out here before/after your meal. - They also have a bar. - The bathrooms are extremely clean and big, however, they are on the second floor, so prepare to go up a good flight of stairs (don't know if they had elevators) but it was only bothersome because 99% of the girls were wearing heels. - A great place to take pictures, the walls are very interesting and you can't get bored of looking at them. - Very fancy atmosphere, you can definitely go casual but the majority of people were in dress pants, skirts, dresses, ties, or nice jackets.",0.9994,0.723,0.225,0.052,0.5925710594315244
2011-05-10,2.0,Whoa. I really REALLY should have paid attention to the bad reviews of this place. They were so spot-on. We were at the Swissotel for a conference and had planned originally to take a client to The Chicago Chop House....we decided to stay close and go to The Palm. Ugh. It's a nice place but the service was so exceptionally SLOW and drawn out- it took FOREVER to get anything! And then the little service touches that you expect virtually anywhere were just gone here- our meals were finished with our napkins on the table and busboys and servers walked by TONS of times and never picked up our plates. We had to ask for the plates to be picked up! The food was ok- nothing to write home about- nothing bad mind you but nothing even worth saying YUMMY to. VERY disappointing.....I would really never come back here unless I was stuck in a storm and had to eat. Seriously. And clearly this restaurant never checks out Yelp or maybe they'd wake up and smell the coffee. DANG.,0.2696,0.845,0.072,0.083,0.45238095238095244
2011-05-01,2.0,"I always find myself seated in The Palm after 8pm. This always works to my disadvantage. I typically go here for just for the desserts which is a reason why I always get here so late. I am enamored by their chocolate cake and their New York Cheesecake and I always pair it with a Moscato. Unfortunately, if you're young and just there to get dessert, these kinds of restaurants often overlook you. Kind of like an 18 year old walking around the beauty counters at Bloomingdales or Nordstrom--no one really cares about you unless they know you've got money to spend. I've almost been embarrassed by how slow the service is at times. I know that they can often be attending to some big parties upstairs, though. I've seen other customers (yeah, the ones with money) yell at staff about the service before.  Their menu is okay, nothing extensive, a lot of items are pricey. Decor is always amusing, I love seeing the faces of people around town or people that have dined in. It's got that spunky/upscale vibe to it. I can't really recommend anything on the menu because I haven't consumed anything from here besides sweets. If you've got a sweet tooth, definitely head here to get your fix.

2011-02-25,1.0,"After arriving we were visited by our scarcely seen waiter.  The restaurant was empty with the exception of one table of two patrons and a pair at the bar.  The ambiance left much to be desired and everything wonderful is left up to your imagination - if you imagine that you are in a very exclusive steak house with beautiful decor, charming details and distinctive artwork you are truly putting your mind to work and your imagination is in overdrive.  The antiquated decor at the Palm was very unappealing on the eyes; do not be fooled by anyone suggesting that you would enjoy staring at the walls.  But, if you enjoy looking at old dull wood then this just might be your scene.   The two of us ordered filet mignon with half & half (cottage fries and onion straws) and asparagus.  I ordered my filet medium which means the middle of the steak should be hot and red with pink surrounding the center.  Instead the steak was delivered to the table rare and ice cold throughout.  It was lightly browned on the outside and raw on the inside.  I asked the waiter whether or not the filet was cold on purpose.  Although, he did not respond to my question, he offered to warm the steak. It is pretty pathetic to have a steak served ice old in any infamous restaurant on the level of ""The Palm"".  I accepted his gesture at making my meal edible but halfway through the wait I opted to take everything to go.   Once I got home and heated up the food I found the steak to be very bland in flavor.  The chef did not add any salt, pepper, herbs, spices, or seasoning at all to the filet mignon.  The waiter threw in an order of something he said they whipped up in the back because they did not have any more potatoes and onions ready.  The whipped up starch was a poor excuse for macaroni and cheese, it was also tasteless. After eating half of the filet mignon I could not force anymore down.  After several hours the filet turned into beef jerky.  Now, I know how to make homemade beef jerky. First, buy filet mignon at the Palm and then let it sit for several hours. Aha, now you have Palm Beef Jerky. The best thing in the to-go bag was the fresh asparagus.  It was bland but that is to be expected, although I would have preferred them tossed with garlic.  The Palm did not meet my expectations and I am shocked at the quality of food served at this famous and pricey restaurant.   I paid $18 to park in the garage after ""The Palm"" made me aware that they do not provide parking validation or parking discounts for patrons.

I used opentable to book a reservation for 6pm last Saturday and even though we arrived early, we were seated right away. There were only a smattering of people throughout the restaurant and our waiter (and assistant) were very nice. The service was excellent, but I also expected it at a place like this.  It happened to be restaurant week and there was an associated menu with a variety of appetizers, entrees, a single side and 2 desserts to select from, all for $32. This was a great deal as a normal filet runs for $41.50 and that doesn't include appetizers or side dishes.  We both had the lobster bisque, I had the 9 oz filet (med-rare), my friend had the sea bass, and there was some combination of potatoes and thin onion rings as the ""side"" that neither of us really ate. The lobster bisque was very average. Not bad, but not good either. The steak was delicious and properly cooked, served over mushrooms and fries covered in blue cheese. Very tasty! I also had a taste of the sea bass and though good, there was nothing exciting about it.  At the end of the meal, we decided to forgo dessert as we didn't like the restaurant week options of key lime pie and cheesecake. Our waiter was nice enough to talk to our manager and offer the tiramisu or the creme brulee as a substitute (and yes, our waiter did receive a huge tip!). We both happily tried the tiramisu, which was delicious, but again, not out of this world. All in all, the food was good, but not great. We got a fantastic deal given the fact that it was restaurant week and also trimmed $50 off the bill with the gift certificate, but I can only give 2 stars as the quality of the food did not match the actual price to eat there.

The host at the front questioned us like 3 times about our gift certificate even though I had put it as a comment on our reservation through Open  table.com . I just felt like he was badgering me about it. My sister got it through her company, and he kept pestering me about where I got it. I explained like 3 times. It just made me feel uncomfortable. Then we sat down and immediately noticed there was no Restaurant Week menu. We went ahead and ordered our drinks thinking maybe they would bring it with the drinks. I ordered the cheapest glass of cabernet ($7.50). The waiter, I guess in an effort to upsell, told me that the wine was not good and recommended a much more expensive glass. If it's not good, why is it on the menu? I can understand saying something like ""good choice, but my favorite is .... if you are interested"" NOT ""oh, you don't want that, you want to get this, that is not good"". I stuck with my original choice which was actually pretty good afterall. That was very strange and made me feel weird having to defend my choice of wine when he was obviously trying to get me to order the more expensive option. When our drinks arrived still without the restaurant week menu, we asked for it, and he had to go get it. So by then we felt like they were really trying to make us feel like cheapstakes. So then we ordered off the Restaurant Week menu (appetizer, entree, side to share, and dessert for $32/pp). The waiter kept badgering us to order a vegetable side (at an extra charge) ignoring our polite ""no's"" -- what was wrong with this guy?? I had the Lobster Bisque, and Paul had the Cream of Asparagus to start. Paul's soup was cold when it arrived, and he had to send it back to get a warm bowl. My soup was disgusting. The lobster bits in it did not taste fresh, and I was afraid I would get sick from eating it, so I did not eat more than a couple bites. The Cream of Asparagus was fine once it came back warm, but nothing special. Paul got the Steak, and I got the Crab Cakes as entrees. The steak was tough and overcooked. The crab cakes were okay but were lacking in crab meat and overly creamy. There was only one option for a side of Fried Onions and Chips which was good but obviously unhealthy -- in fact the fried onions were the best thing we had all night.

2008-12-10,4.0,"One of my favorite steakhouses!  I like the original in the dearly departed Mayfair Regent but this is a nicely appointed heir apparent.  Located in the Swiss Hotel, its usually chockablock with visiting European business men and BA flight crews at the bar. The cocktails are fantastic and made in the time honored Chicago tradition of heavy handed pours with no nonsense garnishes.  But people come here for the food.  And yes its a chain (I believe the original one is actually in NYC) but it has plenty of Chicago flavor to make it a player in the steakhouse epicenter of the world. Lets start with the filet.  Tender, juicy succulent.  Sides as big as your head.  Seriously.  Share them.  And don't fill up on appetizers and sides because you will be kicking yourself, either that or unable to walk out.  The potatoes au gratin are divine as is the creamiest creamed spinach I have ever had.  Feeling fishy?  They have a huge seafood selection that should accommodate even the pickiest of fish lovers.  I've tried bites of freakishly large lobster  and some of the best tilapia around.  Decent calamari app.  My favorite part of this adventure is guessing who is who in the caricatures on the wall.  Some are spot on, some absolutely ridiculous.  Always makes for a fun-waiting-for-your-table game, especially if you are familiar with bold face names......",0.9939,0.72,0.229,0.052,0.5968944099378881

2008-04-01,2.0,"I have been to the Palm about 30 times, since I work next door. They brag about their steaks AND all of their seafood, so I think it is fair to evaluate them on both.  The steaks are fine, but not special by any stretch. Their fish dishes are quite good ONLY IF they do not have any sort of batter or breading. For instance, salmon is uniformly good. If there is a batter or breading, it will always be unpleasantly soggy. The veal parmesan is always burnt. Every time. The steak salad is good, but the onions are quite strong and they use too much dressing, so be prepared. The tuna salad is very good. However, the seafood trio looks like a 1950s nightmare. Three types of mayonaisse-based salads are dropped on a bed of lettuce from an ice cream scooper. Nasty, and they all taste the same. The bisque is overrated, although the soup of the day is generally quite good. The spinach florantine in particular is good. I have never really had bad service at this place. All in all, the Palm is getting a lower rating because it costs too much to have to know the menu inside and out to get a decent meal. Everything should be good.",0.9902,0.762,0.195,0.043,0.5620186335403726
2008-03-12,3.0,"Went here for lunch today and was generally pleased. I ordered an Ahi Tuna Salad, but was dismayed that it came with a ton of almonds on top. The menu said nothing about almonds on the salad or I would have been sure to request that they leave them off as I am allergic. I hate sending food back and it could have easily been avoided if the description was accurate. I even tried to pick them off but there were just too many. They were very gracious about replacing the salad, but again, it could have easily been avoided. Restaurants, I beg you, if you serve an item that contains nuts, please mention that in the item description. So many people these days have allergies, and it causes unnecessary food waste when things have to be sent back. We also split a side of three cheese potatoes, but for $9.00, I expected a larger portion. They were very good though. The crème brulée for dessert was fair, but the sugar was excessively burnt and left a rather bitter taste.

My large starter salad had lots of fresh blue cheese on top and my steak was cooked to perfection - I'm not usually a steak eater, but this will now make me crave it.  The potatoes au gratin was amazing as well. We were seated in the back by the kitchen - probably because we looked like trash compared to the business folk dining there - but were treated with wonderful service.  BUT - they kept flashing that desert tray in my face every time a patron finished their meal.  It was torture.  So I gave in to the cheese cake, my true weakness.  And it was completely worth it.  It was rich with a sweet graham cracker crust.  Put cheese cake factory to shame!",0.9814,0.699,0.235,0.066,0.4419047619047619
2007-09-05,4.0,"Today, I'm pretty sure that I met the bar-friend of my life at the Palm. Maybe I'll review the steak later when I actually eat some or maybe one day I'll try the lobster dinner for two because that looked astounding, but right we're going to talk about the bar. I suspect, like most steakhouses, people don't just eat at the bar, but this is a special bar. An eclectic bar filled with gentle professionals. Before 4pm, they're all business with their coffee and steaks, but once it's after 4, the scotch rolls out like so much childhood memories from a slip and slide. They have a really extensive menu of scotch, and I don't really drink scotch, but I watched my friend put away a couple of glasses of 12 year, 18 year, and the man next to me some 24 year.  What was really amazing is that everybody socialized. Here you have 2 kids who like retired bike messengers complete with oil stained rolled up pants and lazy eye glares talking it up with CEOs and ad execs over scotch what's wrong with the Sox this year and hoping that Lilly could keep up his pitching enough for the Cubs to maintain their 4-1 lead. We talked about Zambrano and his poor performance since signing his new and hefty contract.  Maybe it's baseball, or scotch, but that was an unexpected and friendly atmosphere that I'd never expect from a bar where the majority of the patrons dropped $200 each on meals and drinks.  This place isn't just classy because of its price tags, the food they serve, or the hotel attached to it, but because the people there are awesome from the waitstaff to the patrons.

We ordered a number of appetizers which were good, probably the best part of the meal.  The crab cakes and lump crab meat dishes were well done, but our fried calamari was somewhat mushy and overly greasy.
