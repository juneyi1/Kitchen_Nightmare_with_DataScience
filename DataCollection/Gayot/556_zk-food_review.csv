2008-06-23,5.0,"I can't believe I haven't written a ZK Food review yet! Their food is so fresh and good... It's a great lunch spot. ZK Meatloaf, Chicken Chili, and (my personal favorite) Turkey Reuben are amazing. Their Mac & Cheese rivals the best. We always get the same nice waiter when we go in there. It's great food, great service, and it's on the Rewards Network. How can you lose?",0.9814,0.631,0.338,0.031,0.6604166666666667
2008-06-11,4.0,"right place. right time.  The 6 corners can be a bit...overwhelming. Helter skelter traffic patterns, screeching busses from 6 directions, el overhead, flashing lights, marquees, shops, hoards of people, lightening fast bikers...whew, I mean really. Even living in this fair city for as long as I have, it can be a bit much... I found myself at the infamous 6 corners recently. Befuddled, without direction (a rare oddity in my life, I'm always supposed to be SOMEWHERE), with an hour or two to kill, an empty stomach...and a desperate need for Diet Coke.  A quick few steps north on Milwaukee...and ZKfood found me. The perfect place for quick lunch, some work, a fantastic cobb salad and an ice cold DC...away from all the hullabaloo.  Really, it's almost down right serene. Funky art, soothing colors, friendly staff, great food, even better prices...The tables are set up in a way that encourages solo dining (which I am a huge fan of), so that it's open, yet well situated to peek about... Step a bit north...out of the crazed, methodical mess...ZKfood's got some good stuff for you, I'm sure :)  Also noticed they serve brunch...with the ""Wicker Park Wait Time"" connundrum on the weekends, might be a good spot to check out...",0.987,0.743,0.206,0.051,0.6120135688684077

BUT I shouldn't have ordered the meatloaf sandwich. It said BEST EVER in the name and I should've known!  It was very bland and had way to much tomato chutney on it, it was served on a country bun and came with a side of summer pasta salad which was light and good.   I know I will give this place another try and try an actual entree rather than a sandwich.  I'll also try and enjoy the outdoor seating, it started pouring when I got there so I stood inside.",0.9749,0.8,0.187,0.013,0.6426470588235292

I had the Sloppy Joe's and it was tasty, served on two toasted buns a little larger than a Slider. Mixed greens salad on the side kept my lunch half way healthy and it was nice and fresh.

I do not know why more people aren't coming here for dinner...although it is primarily a breakfast/lunch spot.  That being said, I love quiet, intimate restaurants, so I guess a part of the draw for me is that i don't have to raise my voice in oder to have a conversation here.  I had the white hot chocolate and it was perfect., and their sides pretty much rock (spicy mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, veggies, caesar salad etc. ) Yippee!",0.9117,0.866,0.134,0.0,0.5681818181818182

2007-11-13,4.0,"The first time I ever tried meatloaf was in my elementary school cafeteria.  It was an unpleasant experience that confirmed what I'd thought all along... American people eat weird food.   Then tonight, as I sat in ZKFood, the meatloaf asked me for a second chance.  So I ordered it.  And it was amazing, with a little kick.  But then again, I've never been disappointed here.  The food is consistently good, the servers are awesome, and the prices are reasonable.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because I hate TVs in restaurants.  It takes attention away from me.",0.7817,0.781,0.141,0.078,0.6955555555555556

2007-08-10,2.0,"The food is OK.  The service was OK.   But I can't get over the TVs.  They're loud.  Even if you're the only ones there, they won't turn them off when you ask.  According to the servers, the owners insist that they be on (though if they aren't around the servers will mute them).  If it were a sports bar, it would be different.  But it's a restaurant. All the noise just ruins it for me.  During brunch, some news network is BLARING.  I can't eat through that racket.  As the Grinch said, ""One thing I can't stand is the noise, noise, noise, noise! "" There are a lot of restaurants in the area that provide the same food for the same amount of money.  It's so close, I'd go all the time.  But not with those TVs.",0.5037,0.933,0.045,0.021,0.48125

2007-07-22,4.0,"I had lunch here 7/20 after nibbling on a scrumptious cupcake the night before at an Akira event. I love a good cupcake so I had to investigate further. The service was slow and awkward, but our waitress meant well and it was clear that she knew she was off her game. I ordered the chicken burrito (which eventually came after first being presented with a mammoth-sized ceasar salad). My friend had the chicken avocado sandwich that she couldn't stop talking about. My burrito was quite good, but a little bit cool. I also had a mango smoothie, which was also good but not worth $5. The food itself was very reasonable priced and a good value. I had enough to take home for lunch the next day. The cupcakes were--as expected--wonderful. We ordered half a dozen split between chocolate and vanilla. There was a lemon option but that didn't seem appealing. Big, rich, and $2...a very good value.",0.992,0.719,0.262,0.019,0.5309722222222221
2007-06-11,3.0,"This place is solid! It didn't dissapoint me but it didn't really wow me either.  The service was good. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly.   I had the the ham and swiss cheese omlette with an english muffin.  The potatoes were very good and the omlette was decent.  It seemed to be ham off the bone but there was not much cheese in the omlette though. The coffee was very good.  It was a darker, more robust flavor with some earthy undertones. The english muffin was very good too as it was not your typical store bought kind of muffin. I tasted my sweetie's egg white denver omlette and it was kind of bleh.  I guess I like the taste of my eggs with the yolks. She liked it so that is the important part! The prices were not bad, considering the area that it is located. This is one of the places I would not go out of my way to pay another visit to, but if I am in the area it will a spot I know where I will have a decent meal.",0.9861,0.786,0.185,0.029,0.567

Then all of a sudden, I'M COMPETING WITH THE TWO LOUD TELEVISIONS WTF, MAN. As long as we're talking about Maslow, televisions blaring the idiotic rantings of Da Mayor in an overpriced restaurant with unpolished service are good problems to content with, but I'll pay for better next time.",0.8862,0.597,0.242,0.161,0.621875

You should check it out...  And I've heard the cup cakes are to die for.  But not so sure that I really want to try them, I'll just be a conformist and agree with the popular consensus.",0.9317,0.749,0.176,0.076,0.6181944444444445
2007-05-09,4.0,"I have had good service each time I've come here, which totals about six times. I love the ""build-your-own"" salad option they have. All the ingredients are fresh, and they make the salad right in front of you. If you don't want any of the meat options, they will substitute a couple other items. I load it up with the marinated mushrooms, red onion, pumpkin seeds, crispy asian noodles, carrots, etc.  The decor is clean, but still has a dinerish feel to it. I haven't tried any of the other food items, but everything sounds good. They also offer some sweet treats.",0.9299,0.84,0.15,0.01,0.4487012987012988

I had the chicken avocado sandwich, and while I was full from the first half, it was simply far too scrumptious to put down... So I consumed the second half and felt stuffed like a Thanksgiving Day turkey.  But was it tasty!

But your going to go here for the food not the name.  This isn't a health food place, its comfort food, which normally isn't healthy. My favorite thing I eat that night was the Spicy Mac & Cheese. The fish tacos and salad were tasty but nothing to write home to mom about. I may try them for lunch sometime soon because the sandwiches sounded great.

2007-01-14,3.0,"Solid three stars. First of all bad service- we waited around 15 minutes for anyone to come take our order, and when she did we noticed another table being served breakfast foods so I asked if they were still serving brunch. She said yes and went and got us breakfast menus (we were within normal brunch time, they weren't making a special accommodation for us). The restaurant was mostly empty so it was kind of strange we hadn't even been given the right menus. The food was solidly okay. It seemed strange to me that they made note on the menu that they offer a vegan soup every day but the only vegan sandwich (the menu is salads, sandwiches, and sides) is PB&J. This and an eggplant sandwich are the only veg main courses on the menu, besides salad. The eggplant sandwich was tasty but not worth coming back for. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito which he liked, but nothing outstanding. He did say it was better than the one at filter that he sometimes gets. Also I felt that this place was often overpriced or had strange pricing. I considered getting a soup and side but at $5 and $3.50 respectively it would have been much more expensive that the huge sandwich with salad that I got for $6.25. Also I wanted coffee but the lattes were $4.10 plus 80 cents extra for soy milk! No thanks. Seems like this place would be an alright place for lunch if you eat meat. If you don't, don't waste your time.",0.8163,0.821,0.099,0.08,0.45612874779541435
