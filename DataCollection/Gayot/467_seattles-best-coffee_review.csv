I originally walked out of the line when I realized that the coffee vendor was no longer Starbuck's, but it was raining outside and I was far too lazy and bummed out to go out of my way for coffee. They had a sample tray of the Iced Marble Mocha out, I took a sip and was instantly sold. When I received my very first cup of it, it got even better. The Marble Mocha was loaded with their sweet whipped cream, shaved white chocolate flakes, and a small stick of chocolate. Instant euphoria I tell you. Loved every drop of it. When it was all gone, I kept on sucking at the bottom of the cup for more. I told myself that I'd never return to Starbuck's every again even though Starbuck's basically owns Seattle's Best, but it's impossible considering how rare they are and can usually only be found at Border's....booo. Anyway, just wanted to express my love for this chain. Hope others feel the same way. Definitely try the Marble Mocha. You'll love it.",0.9934,0.755,0.212,0.033,0.551
