2006-04-07,3.0,Strega Nona has insane specials where they just give away food and wine for nothing- It seriously makes me think it might be a front for some other operation. Update: Seems like this place has changed its name (maybe owners too?). I haven't been back recently so I don't know if it is any good.,0.497,0.833,0.12,0.047,0.48194444444444445

2005-09-29,5.0,"This neighborhood Italian joint is a cute little eatery near my house that never disapoints--and really works for everyone. I've taken my parents here for a quiet dinner and also enjoyed it with girlfriends and lots of wine. The food here is delicious (I'm a fool for the Farfalle Fontina) and with $5 pasta on Mondays you really can't go wrong. The service here is always awesome as well - I mean, how can you not love the waiter who shimmies your Cosmos over to the table? I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes their pasta fattening and delicious, their martinis strong, and their stomachs full.",0.9793,0.688,0.263,0.048,0.6315104166666666
