I didn't catch that"" all night.  It is nearly impossible to have a conversation with how loud it gets in there.  Food was decent, but a half step below Antiprima in my opinion.  Everything was cooked well, although the main dish of short ribs and soft polenta was over salted.  Everything else was good.

I had the worse stomach pains all night after dinner that night until I finally vomited after 8 hours of constant pain. It literally felt like I was being punched in the stomach. This place is a nice restaurant and the service is pretty good as well, but I wouldn't risk going back just because I don't want to go through that painfully awful experience of eating something that is going to beat me up all night and make me pay $75 for it.

However, the food was just OK at best-- and there was no house wine.  Anti-Pasti: Bread, with no dipping sauce. We had to ask and then it was still just olive oil. I would have appreciated some vinegar and Parmesan.  The brussel sprouts were flaked apart and deep fried. Tasted OK, but greasy. I was looking for a more hearty veg.  Everyone raved about the octopus. It was again only OK- rather salty and lacked flavor.  For dinner I ordered the Italian sausage pasta.

The restaurant is on the smaller side but is rather cozy.  I would however recommend reservations at peak times (they are on opentable). Azzurra does traditional Italian with a modern twist. For appetizers, I did the octopus and my husband did the meatballs.  We both liked our appetizers so much that we barely shared.  The octopus was tender and had nice acidity.  My only gripe is a small detail of unevenly distributed chilis because it led to some very spicy bites.  The meatballs were exactly what you expect in a beautiful sauce.  We ordered the mushroom ragu and orechhiette pastas.  Of the two, I preferred my ragu but both were very good.  You can tell that the pasta is made in house and is hand cut. The pasta had a great texture. For the entrees, my husband did the short rib polenta dish and I had the squid.  The squid was perfectly cooked and complemented well by the fingerling potatoes. There was not much conversation as we thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Service was also very good.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful in making recommendations.  He was attentive but not overbearing. I was also impressed by the waiter's and the manager's (Joseph) level of service.  There was a difficult table next to us who claimed food was not hot (after it sat on their table for a long time). I wanted to tell them they were being rude.

We had a wonderful time and I recommend it to anyone looking for a non-pretentious, but classy dinner! Looking for a last minute reservation, we had no issues getting one via Open Table. We were seated at a great table, right by the open window. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. He was exceptionally helpful in determining how many dishes to order, although he may have underestimated how hungry we were. To start, we shared the burrata on special, which was creamy deliciousness. Highly recommend. We also went with the grilled octopus, arancini, meatballs, and dates. While all of these are familiar Italian small plates, Azzurra does a great job of making them unique dishes. We did have to order multiple orders of some of these due to our party size. For dinner, we shared three very different pasta dishes. The orecchiette with italian sausage and rapini was incredibly flavorful. We also enjoyed the gnudi and tagliatelle. I would say which was our favorite, but the five of us were split pretty evenly between the three, so I would say you can't go wrong! We had a few bottles of wine with dinner, all of which were reasonably priced and went very well with our meal. Overall, awesome girls dinner. Easy to make a reservation, shareable plates, and very cute atmosphere. For a LOT of food and wine, I think we each spent around $35.

2014-06-09,3.0,"I'm kind of surprised by how high the reviews are for Azzurra.  I think that 2.5 stars would have been a more accurate rating, but since we can't do half-stars, and 2 seemed a little worse than it was, I gave it 3.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner over the weekend because I've read good things about the restaurant, but we were a little disappointed. We waited at the bar for our table, and decided to order a couple of drinks, but we were surprised by how limited the liquor selection was. When we sat down for dinner, we were given a basket of bread and breadsticks.  The breadsticks were actually quite good, but the bread was a little dry, especially considering Azzurra doesn't offer you any oil or butter to go with it. For dinner, we ordered the meatball appetizer, my boyfriend ordered the penne with goat cheese, green beans, sundried tomatos & basil pesto, and I ordered the cavatelli with country tomato, pesto & parmigiano.   The meatballs were probably the best part of the meal, and we enjoyed the sauce they were served in.  My cavatelli was good, and the pasta was homemade, but it could have definitely used a little more tomato.  I expected the sauce to be a little more like the marinara the meatballs were served in, but it was more like an oil with a little tomato and pesto mixed in.  My boyfriend's penne was unfortunately very bland.  It had very little flavor, and could have benefited perhaps from some grated parmigiano, but just like the oil or butter for the bread, no cheese is offered for your pasta.  In addition, the portions were pretty small for the price. Azzurra wasn't a terrible restaurant, but we weren't very impressed, and with so many Italian restaurant options in the city, probably won't be back.",0.9812,0.807,0.136,0.057,0.553876984126984

2014-04-20,4.0,"Four of us dined here for dinner on Easter.  It was the first 75 degree night since the polar vortex so we were seated next to the open window.  The beautiful night was perfect for hipster watching.   Unfortunately we were all hurting from the previous night of boozing so cocktails were avoided. Bread sticks and focaccia were brought to the table sans butter or olive oil.  The bread sticks were incredibly flavorful. We shared the burrata appetizer.  The apples that came with it were a perfect match.  Divine. For entrees, we had the tagliatelle, orecchiette, cavatelli, and lamb.  The pastas were homemade and cooked perfectly al dente.   We shared the tiramisu and the cheese plate.  The tiramisu was delicious.  However the cheese plate had a lot to be desired.  It arrived with a plethora of pecorino, parmesano, gorgonzola, and fontina.  However there were no other usual accompaniments; no bread, no marcona almonds, no jam, no fruit.   Cute restaurant, reasonable prices, good food!!",0.968,0.716,0.188,0.096,0.6455882352941176

2014-04-07,4.0,"This is an exciting find! I find lots of value here in the price, authenticity, flavors, creativity, attention to quality, hard to find offerings and service. A REAL, legitimate, creative, and excitingly Italian place in Wicker Park. I came here last night with friends for my birthday. The bartender and manager both treated me like their only customer. Everyone was happy- and that means a lot since all of my friends are from Italy or just foodies. The highlights are the service, the exciting list of appetizers which are hard to choose from, the delicious entrees and house-made liquors. Where else can you find moscato grappa, let alone NOCINO? I can't even find nocino easily in Italy! I will be going back just for that while it lasts. They also have delicious fig infused grappa, and (although we didn't try them), limoncello, arancello, and laurel liqueur all made in house. Honestly, I chose it because it looked good but also because they had a bison flank steak on the menu, which they took off two days before we arrived. I settled for a delicious rainbow trout, which I hope never escapes like the bison. Wines were good- the prosecco and rose were top notch and well priced It has a cute atmosphere with whimsically-placed gramophone horns hanging from the ceiling holding antique incandescent light bulbs. I suppose it could be warmed up a bit, but I don't care. The food was great. One star slipped away because I walked in on Sunday expecting what I had seen Thursday or Friday on the menu (the bison steak) and it wasn't there. I also feel the rest of the decor didn't match the creativity and character of the ceiling. Something was ""on the cusp"" in the ambiance, perhaps a mix of lighting and music selection and music volume could have made it a bit more intimate. I'm no expert on that but I can just say it had a bit of a lunch feeling even though it was dinner time. I loved it though and I will be back with my wife many times.

So we gave it a try.  Although I wondered how this compared to the lukewarm review by the very same magazine that referred to the entire menu as ""bland"". The location and ambiance is awesome in eclectic Wicker Park while the parking is anything but.  Yeah it's loud but so what?  My husband was on the verge of taking us home as we simply could not find any street parking. Dinner started with a platter of bread and tasty breadsticks.  What was odd is that I had to ask our server for butter and olive oil for the bread.  Who eats dry bread these days?  The olive oil, when it arrived, was nonetheless good enough to drink. Based on a recommendation from our server, we selected a bottle of an amazing grechetto.  Appetizers included the creamy mushroom forgo and the crunchy polenta fries both of which were quite good.  We also tried the carrots which was salad based; this was just ok. Main course for me was the Gnocchi but this was really ""bland"".  It was not a large dish but I had a tough time finishing it.  Just too dull a dish.  The other two in our party had the spaghetti which wasn't too inspiring either. Dessert consisted of the chocolaty zuccoto and also the tiramisu which were also just ok.  Highlight though was the pistachio liquor Dumante - I highly recommend it.  I bought some at Binny's afterwards.

My friend and I both ordered apps and a pasta main.  I had the grilled octopus salad which had an unwelcome surprising amount of red onion.  I had to pick the octopus out to eat it.  The octopus was fine, it was cooked fine.  Note that it's not grilled.  Or at least it didn't seem like it.  While I was on the back end of my octopus salad, the pasta came out and it was really awkward because the server just placed the pasta on the table.  Shouldn't he have waited til we were both done with our appetizers? So I had to hurry up and finish the salad so I could eat the pasta while it was warm.  Flavors were good but there was a good amount of unwelcome chili flakes that I was not prepared for in my orecchiete.  I went back and looked at the menu and there was no mention of this.  I'm sensitive to this flavor so I had to again, pick through my meal.  Now, the pasta is cooked wonderfully and my friend also loved her pasta sampler plate.  For me in particular it was a bit too hot.

2014-03-23,4.0,"After two visits and a confrontation with what is quite possibly the most polarizing Bloody Mary in the city thanks to the inclusion of black pepper and Parmesan infused vodka, I feel prepared to comment on a decidedly welcome addition to Wicker Park. Let's keep it simple - the pastas are delicious. Slurpable house-made noodles coupled with sauce you'll throw down with your significant other for sopping rights thanks to bread just made for wiping the plates down with.  The carbonara is a classic done more than right - egg yolk breaking into the creamy porky sauce in a silky unctuous mass of delicious richness sure to raise HDL levels across Wicker Park. The small plates are all done up simply and are just large enough to share. The grilled radicchio (probably the world's most underrated roughage) and lamb meatballs both stand out for satisfying interplay of texture and perfect bitter char playing off the sweetness of tangy sweetness of vinaigrette and tomato, respectively.  Brunch is a bit of a weird beast - the aforementioned Bloody Mary's Parmesan funk clashes in a big way with much of the menu, but the pickle garnishes are delicious, and the polenta fries are lincoln log-like sticks of awesome that pack a salty savory punch well worth burning your tongue for. Though building wee parm-dusted structures with them whilst they cool is good times too.  Service is more than adequate - servers are friendly and eager to please. Special requests are sometimes confused though, and they could be much better about communicating when specials and ingredients run out before you bust out your order and have to face the soul-scarring disappointment when there's no more spicy giant beans. The music selections are a little hit or miss at brunch, but there's someone a little smarter about the atmosphere dictating the playlist in the evenings, ensuring we don't have to face Katy Perry while throwing back tasty pork shoulder ragu.",0.9943,0.733,0.21,0.056,0.535

2014-03-17,5.0,"I took my best friend to Azzurra Eno Tavola as a special treat this past Saturday. Have to say it was one of the best meals I've had over the last 5 years. The cocktails, service and especially, the food, were spectacular.  Jonathon was our waiter for the evening. He was both friendly, humorous and efficient - great combo! He started us off with two of his recommended cocktails, the Vimini and the Sangue e Sabbia -both served in 1920's cocktail glasses. The Vimini which consists of infused Heaven Hill, lemon, simple syrup and Lanbusco was my personal favorite. The infused alcohol had a wonderful mulled wine-spicy earthiness to it and seemed perfect for a very cold snowy night. The Sangue e Sabbia had hints of sweet and bitterness in equal measure and was also wonderful.  Having come with rather large appetites, we ordered the pancetta-wrapped, gorgonzola-filled dates with a balsamic reduction and the grilled marinated shrimp on a bed of escarole with a spicy Calabrian vinaigrette. The dates tasted like delicious savory candy - best I ever ate. The marinated shrimp were grilled to plump juicy perfection, obviously very fresh with a bit of a kick from the sauce which gave the dish a little more complexity. For the next course, we had the cauliflower soup. Though oftentimes wary of cream-based soups, this one was a perfectly balanced blend of cauliflower and cream with a homemade large bread crouton on top with a light basting of pesto. If you like cauliflower, you have to order this soup. The balance of flavors was outstanding. As for the main course, Jonathon again assisted us with our choices. Per his recommendations, we ordered the chianti-braised short rib with brussel sprouts served on a bed of soft polenta and the seafood risotto. Again, both were beautifully prepared and cooked to perfection. The short rib melted in your mouth with the chianti-au jus reduction infusing the meat with an incredible taste. The brussel sprouts worked very well with the short rib as did the polenta. Perfection! Finally, the seafood risotto consisted of lobster and shrimp with an incredible sauce that picked up the flavors of both seafood items. The two dishes together complemented each other very well.  Too stuffed to order dessert, we instead ordered glasses of their pistachio liquor. What a great way to end the meal with an Italian digestivo.  Can't end the review without again noting how warm and welcoming the wait staff was. Their friendliness seems to be infectious. We ended up chatting with a few of the patrons in the restaurant including a very proud grandmother who was introducing us to her 6 month old grand daughter.

2013-12-09,3.0,"Had quite an uneven experience here, with the final verdict resting on ""take it or leave it"". The night started off quite offputtingly with a series of missteps, one being the complete lack of efficiency in terms of seating our party, compounded quite disgustingly by the 2 cocktails we ordered while we watched the debacle of hostessgate unfold before our eyes. Now, it's only mildly annoying when a restaurant doesn't seat 2 of you until your full party of 4 hasn't arrived. But, once said brigade had arrived, being told that the wait would be a ""few minutes"" on more than one occasion yet watching the hostess seat walk-ins ahead of you starts to make you question why you braved the 3 minute walk from your condo only to get treated like a Gold Coaster who thought it might be ""adventurous"" to take his witless band of gaijin dudebros  to koreatown for DIY bbq. What made this wait more excruciating, in the most literal of ways, were the cocktails which we foolishly thought would have been tasted even once before they were stamped on the menu. oh, to be so wrong...Of the 2, the better one reminded us of watered down kool-aid enhanced by a sani-wipe that had been left soaking in the pitcher, while the clear loser was the padrino concoction that clearly had not been clearly mixed at all, as the first half of the drink was pure whiskey, while the bottom half was the sweet, sweet amaretto that would have made the entire experience a notch above horrifying. Onto the meal itself, which thankfully rose above the level of the cocktail menu. On the pleasant side were the kale salad, short rib pasta, arrancini. Prepared well, good flavor, solid portion sizes. On the down side was the grilled octopus, which was overpowered with red onion and diced bell peppers to the point of rendering the normally tasty crustacean to nothing more than rubbery filler. In addition, the orecchiette was nearly inedible because the chef deemed it necessary to crop dust the dish with enough red pepper flakes to render not only our palates completely useless, but our ensuing conversations equally worthless as the only phrases we could muster for the rest of the meal were variations of, ""holy shit, this is really hot!""  In the end, I'll probably give this place another try based on the food items which were executed well, but needless to say, i'll be sticking to the beer/wine going forward. I'll also give them a slight pass for the seating issue, bumping it up to a 3 star experience overall.

Warm and inviting decor with little touches that make you want to look around for a bit to make sure you catch them all (look up). Clever little bar in the bar with crafty cocktails. Our server was welcoming, charming, and provided great explanations to the wine and food. Had a glass of both white and red and they were fabulous choices - great compliments to the food and great on their own - very easy. Get the crispy polenta OMG the texture and sauce took me to church. And I can't write enough about that orecchiette. When I go back, it will be hard to order anything else but I must try everything. I must.",0.9762,0.745,0.246,0.009,0.6506613756613757

2013-11-10,4.0,"A great new find in Wicker Park.  Tried going to the Bongo Room for breakfast at 9:30am.  There was a line for over an hour so decided to go across the street to this new spot and what a delight.  They let us in thirty mins before they were open which was especially nice since it was freezing outside.   The service was fantastic, I'd give it a 5.  Everyone is uber nice and helpful.   The food was only a 3.  We ordered the following: 1.  Eggs Benedict - ok, over salted.  the procuitto was delicious and eggs perfectly cooked 2.  Strata - a little dry and over salted as well.  a mix between a quiche and bread pudding.  I put syrup over it which made it a good savory sweet meal 3.  Polenta Cakes - their version of pancakes.  very fluffy and delicious homemade preserves 4.  Polenta Fries - well cooked but also over salted Overall the meal was pretty good just wish it had a little less salted....everyone else I was eating with agreed.   Would def come back to try out their dinner options.",0.9887,0.77,0.224,0.006,0.5898303030303029

2013-10-29,4.0,"A lovely little gem in Wicker Park! I liked the large windows at the front and the ceiling is a great interior detail, although if you're planning for a quiet date night it does get a little noisy when the room is full.  As for the food, the portion sizes were refreshingly realistic for a person to eat, and at a fair price point. I walked out full without feeling grossly over-stuffed. For an appetizer, the Grilled Octopus was amazing! We ordered it because we heard the table next to us talking about it, and we were not disappointed. As for entrees, I ordered the Lamb Shoulder and my husband ordered the Short Ribs. The Lamb Shoulder had good flavor and was cooked to perfection, but the Short Ribs were definitely a standout. The meat was exceptionally tender and the brussel sprouts were a great side for it. The food is not the ""red sauce"" type Italian, the flavors were great and it felt like home style Italian comfort food. The house made Limoncello was dessert for me along with the lemon pana cotta, which was also outstanding for those who like fresh lemon desserts.  This is definitely somewhere we will return to, as it is a cozy place and perfect for a cold winter evening.",0.9956,0.743,0.247,0.01,0.5442012288786482
2013-10-28,5.0,"Well done, folks! My first experience (of many, I expect) at Azzurra included a charming, stylish, cozy setting, and terrific food and folks. I was there for brunch. All of the staff were super busy, but friendly and helpful and on top of their game. I had the polenta griddle cakes. They were wonderful, and the bacon was super light and crispy. I also had a bloody mary, which didn't last long - deeelicious.",0.9764,0.632,0.325,0.043,0.6284313725490196
