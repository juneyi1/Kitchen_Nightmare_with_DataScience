It's basically a historical establishment in Chicago and with this type of food competing with the newer up and coming restaurants it needs something additional.

2017-05-09,2.0,"What a let down to have dined here!!! I spend weeks researching the better restaurants in Chicago, and narrow it down to a select few, and for various reasons I chose MK. Boy did I make a mistake. For many reasons..... First off, service....it was barely offered, and when it was, it was both condenscending and patronizing​. Not just from our waiter Sergio, but from the maitre d' who attended (sic) to us for our drinks in the lounge before dinner. The maitre d'/host was obsessed with one of the female guests, to the detriment of the rest of the guests in the lounge.  We had to ""ask"" him to get us another cocktail. We finally get seated...our server had an imperious attitude throughout the night, doing us a favor, and priding himself on his wit. Three times I had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled, while we ordered two rounds of wines. Food....very tasty, but small portions bordering on miniscule, for the prices paid. Chef present....yes, for more than 1 hour, the chef was talking with one female guest in the lounge.....who was in charge of preparing our (and the rest of the restaurant guests) meals???? So, for $220, my wife and I were not treated with respect, nor felt we received good value for what we received. This restaurant is living off its reputation, earned years ago, and takes its status, and customers for granted. I could not even rate this experience ""average"", nor would I recommend to any of my friends to dine here. Thus, two stars.",0.9311,0.889,0.077,0.033,0.42614379084967335
2017-04-30,2.0,"I went here on two occasions 9 months apart. The first was perhaps one of the best meals and best service I've ever had in my life - for my boyfriend's birthday, just the two of us.  The latter was an embarrassing, rushed, overpriced, shitshow of a meal and I am still apologizing to my dad for dragging them him here on his first visit to Chicago in 20+ years. The only reason I've given it two stars is because, no, none of us got food poisoning and I guess the building did not literally burn down while we were there (small wins!), but the two experiences could not have been more different than night and day. Let's start with the first time: the service was impeccable, he neither harassed us the entire meal nor did he totally abandon us - if anything, he enhanced the meal and our experience there, appearing only the instant we had questions or needed something. the server came by and showed us a special wine list that was comprised of wines where they only had one bottle of each left in stock and thus, they were 20% off - I thought this was so considerate to point out when he so easily could have pointed us to the most expensive bottles or just not even let us know that such a thing existed. The food was also impeccable - we split three apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine, two desserts and two dessert cocktails...not a single thing was mediocre or bad. The second time, everything we ordered was swimming in a butter bath - the fish included (ick). We even mentioned that my dad does not really like butter, if they could please go light on it, yet it still arrived with a solid centimeter or two pooling around the bottom of the plate. We asked about the wine-list addendum that we'd been brought on our previous trip and were told that all they had was on the menu - our server had not heard of such a list and looked at us like we each had two heads (sorry for asking, i guess??). We ordered a bottle and moved on with our lives, as one does, and ended up pouring for ourselves the entire night as our waiter didn't really take a moment to do anything but take our orders and scurry by our table quickly without making eye contact from that point onwards. The bill was easily north of $300 that night and at that price point, I expect good service and good food - neither of which we received that evening. It's sad because I really did want this to be my Chicago go-to ""treat yourself""/celebratory spot - but with so many other good restaurants in the city, I'm not sure it's worth a third trip.",0.9678,0.843,0.096,0.061,0.506227729186913
2017-04-28,2.0,"I've been to MK maybe 10 times over the years.  It is not new, not trendy and not in a trendy area.  The menu has some of the same stuff from almost 20 years ago, so that can be good or bad depending on your perspective. Though they have claimed to remodel, the dining area looks almost the same as it did 20 years ago. When I went to book for 2 people on a Thursday night on Opentable 6 days in advance, there was nothing for 7:30.  No problem, I booked for 8.  When we arrived at 7:50, the hostess told us we would be seated at 8 and could go to the bar.  The restaurant was 80% empty.  By the time a big party left shortly after 8, the restaurant was 90% empty.  This was very frustrating/aggravating and set a bad tone.   The food was a 8/10 and service a 7/10, but the whole reservation and seating situation made me mad and my rating reflects that.  This is not a cheap place (I spent over $300 for 2 people) and being told to wait when the restaurant is empty is not acceptable to me.

2017-01-13,1.0,"Dined at this restaurant last night, and let me just say I will never be dining here again. We made a reservation about 3 months ago for a monthly supper club and had to reschedule a couple of times due to schedule conflicts. Not only do they have a hefty cancellation fee, but they are not accommodating in the least. Regardless, we rescheduled for January and decided we would suck it up and go. Middle of December, they charged a cancellation fee that I noticed on my credit card. When I called in, 3 separate times, they finally said that they made the mistake on dates and were going to process the fee off of my card, stating this could take up to 3 weeks until it won't show up there. As it is week 4, I decided to bring it up when we went for our reservation as it was still on there. The general manager who was working was extremely rude and inconsiderate. He did not believe me when I told him that my card was mis-charged and said that it was ""strange because that is not our protocol it should only have taken 3 days so where did I get that information from"". I agree, it should not take this long to correct YOUR mistake. Regardless, I told him that this needs to be taken care of and it should have weeks ago. He continued on with a quizzical look asking who I spoke with, why couldn't I remember his name, etc. He said that if its not off in another 5 days to call him. Needless to say, I will be calling them back, along with my credit card company. HE WAS THE WORST. Beyond that issue, the food itself was mediocre and the service was even worse than that. We were not paid attention to the entire time we were there, taking 15 minutes to be served drinks, and even longer for food and our check. All in all, not planning on going back here ever again. They might need to re-think their customer service because it was extremely disappointing to have to dine at this restaurant after all of these issues.",-0.9786,0.859,0.037,0.104,0.5482456140350876

The food, as always, was tremendous.  I started with the octopus, as satisfying as ever, with a little creeping heat to counteract winter's chill.  They humored my request to order a la carte the sirloin steak from the prix fixe menu.  It came with black trumpet puree, fried salsify, and baby leeks; it was utterly delicious; and it was absolutely enormous.  The size stunned me when the entrees arrived, and in fact I had to leave three or four bites on the plate because I was stuffed and dessert was still pending.   I enjoyed several bites of my wife's excellent salmon, which included (I believe) soy, mustard, mushroom, and bok choy components.  We also shared the brussels sprouts, our mutual favorite vegetable, and a risotto which we deemed a bit pedestrian compared to the other food. For dessert we debated a pear/maple/pecan invention versus the ""cake and shake"", choosing the pears after a discussion with our server.  I love pears and feel that they are underserved on dessert menus; and, while everyone loves cake and milkshakes, you can get those anywhere.  Our server seemed excited for our selection, then lo and behold, he brought out both desserts and comped the cake & shake as an anniversary gift.  Delightful.

I know they've been around for 20 years and maybe that's just what they're going for, but I think the industry standards have evolved. The restaurant was fairly empty but not surprising considering it was a Wednesday before thanksgiving. The crowd that was there consisted of a fairly older generation. The food itself was just alright as well. Not sure if there was a tasting menu, we were never offered one. We started with the crab toast and endive salad. Crab toast was good and endive salad was average. They were nice enough to split it in 2 for us without us asking.  For dinner we got the risotto and chicken. I absolutely loved my risotto but it was a fairly large portion of the same thing after a while. The chicken itself was moist with crispy skin, but on the saltier side. The Brussels sprouts and potatoes under the chicken were very average.  Finally for dessert we got the S'mores dessert and that was pretty darn delicious. I expected more of the food to be like that. Small intricate portions, slightly artsy, and delicious. Instead, we got very average looking and tasting food.  The service was pretty great overall and very proper until close to the end of our meal. They didn't refill our wine or water during the dessert portion so not sure what happened there. But everyone was very nice and made an effort to make my bf feel special for his birthday.

None of the ingredients or flavors really shone in the dishes that we got. There are many other restaurants in this price range that present much more thoughtful and, frankly, tasty food. We ordered the crab toast, various vegetable sides, the fries, and trout. The toast was pretty forgetable. There was nothing about the topping that made it special- I could've eaten the dish at a more casual/inexpensive restaurant (and still, perhaps, been unimpressed). The vegetables were reasonably flavorful, but also on the oily side. The truffle cream that came with the fries was nice. The quality of the fish was also nice, but I found the prepararion, again, too heavy/oily. I got some sort of cake for dessert that was fine but, like most of the meal, unexciting.

The staff was great and on top of things. Making sure our water was filled, cleared our utensils after usage, clearing our table, and making sure it didn't have food remnants and crumbs. Our server was knowledgeable of the food and drinks and was informative. I appreciated the professionalism. Now the food was not super impressive. The most impressive was the deconstructed s'mores. We got an a complimentary amuse-bouche which wasn't that amusing. It was too fishy for me and I like seafood. I think, if it had a mixture of some lemon zest and some dill it would have decreased the overwhelming fishy-ness of it.   The crab on toast was pretty good. Had a good texture. Nice crunchyness to it the toast wasn't over done. It was good.   The octopus appetizer had a char-grilled flavor to it which was nice. The texture of the octopus was really tender- the first time ever tasting that kind of texture. If you like fishy-ness and seafood this will be a good dish. If not, avoid it. We got the truffles fries which was good. The fries itself had a nice sweetness to it and the sauce gave it the saltiness. I would dip the fries instead of dousing it as it would be way to salty. We also got the tuna which was good. The only unfortunate part was the shitake mushroom was too salty. It was almost as if the mushrooms were salted to drain the extra moisture and then as it was being cooked more salt was added. If the shitake wasn't too salty each component of the dish would have worked beautifully together with the texture complexity. The puree was beautifully done and tasted so good and creamy. I loved the sear of the of tuna and the peppercorn. I love shitake mushrooms and was saddened that it was too salty to eat.  The dessert was good - deconstructed s'mores I recommend. Was appeasing to the eye and taste buds.  As a palate cleanser we got a home made jelly and cookie kind of thing. Eaten together it reminded me of Fig newton's, but good Fig newton's not the store bought kind. I did enjoy the flavor and texture - not having that artificalness.

The pea soup is chilled and minty, but there most certainly could have been more crab.  Underwhelming and just crabby pants.  Soup was grainy. Tuna is peppercorn crusted yellowfin, seared rare, spinach (slightly sweet and packed with flavor), shiitake mushrooms, potato puree, and a red wine syrup.   Tuna is mild but so overwhelmed by the peppercorns, that I can't taste the tuna properly.  The cherry sauce mellowed out the burning taste of pepper in my mouth with its sweetness, but it was overly sweet like a dessert sauce.  Poor execution.  On fire mouth.   Fiddlehead Ferns with pickled asparagus, I opted for the no shisito pepper due to my allergy.  Mostly tasted good, some a bit on the charred side.   I then chose a Mula Fresca to cleanse my overheated palate.  Chinaco Tequila, triple sec, Strawberry puree, and balsamic.  Powerful drink, but I think I'm ready for dessert.   24 Carrot Gold - Carrot cake, whipped cheesecake, candied pepitas, crystallized ginger, and glazed carrots.  Not exactly a spring/ summer menu item, more of a fall dish, but who doesn't love carrot cake done right!  It was deconstructed torn pieces of cake, and just pieces of the other accoutrements placed sporadically on the plate.  Presentation not thought out, but tasted good.",0.9743,0.833,0.112,0.054,0.4804761904761905

2016-07-14,5.0,"I recently went to MK for a graduation dinner with my family, and it completely exceeded my expectations. MK was the perfect place to go for our celebration, and I am incredibly grateful to both Chef Erik Williams and our server Jesse for an incredibly memorable evening. At the start of the meal, I informed Jesse that I had numerous dietary restrictions. Since the restrictions are new for me, I'm still a bit uncomfortable about listing them off and worried about being an inconvenience. Jesse very warmly said that they would have no problem accommodating my restrictions and requested that I list them all for her. She took careful notes, which she subsequently presented to the chef. He later came out and informed me that he would take good care of me but asked for our patience, as things would likely take a bit longer to prepare as a result. Well let me tell you, they took fantastic care of me! Not only did they help me select dishes that I could eat, they also prepared different versions of some of the appetizers my family ordered so that I could enjoy them, as well! I had no idea they were going to do that and simply expected I would not be able to enjoy those dishes - I was blown away. And since I couldn't have sugar for dessert, they brought me out a plate of berries with a congratulatory message on it. I felt so welcomed and cared for, and not at all like a nuisance -- and I got to eat some amazing food to boot! Every single dish we ate from the amuse-bouche to the dessert was fantastic. I can't highlight any particular dish because I would gladly eat them all again (though I do recall my sister saying that her s'mores dessert was one of the best desserts she'd ever had). Additionally, the presentation of the meals - and especially desserts - is exquisite. All in all, going to MK was an outstanding experience, and I couldn't imagine a better place to have celebrated my graduation. Thanks so much to Jesse and Chef Williams and the entire MK team for making the night a memorable one!",0.997,0.75,0.202,0.048,0.6460323472823473

It took a solid 5 minutes from seating to receive water and another 5 for any sort of waitress attention. The restaurant was empty and we were a party of 2. At cheaper places, this is acceptable. Here, it's not.  We had the tasting menu with wine. The wine pours were light and the pacing was slow and off. We would receive the wine well in advance of the dish. With such a light pour, we were left staring at it until the food came. I bought a bottle of wine a couple courses in so we could actually enjoy some wine.  The food was forgettable. Mostly fine. Nothing incredible. The lamb was poorly seasoned and improperly cooked. I left most of it on my plate. The waitress did not ask me about it. In most restaurants, that is fine.

Wine pour was so small for a no-so-great chard....way over priced! Manager responded explaining that he spoke with the staff and they worked on reducing the salt in their preparations.  He never addressed the portion size issue on food and wine.  Did absolutely nothing to make up for our bad experience.  All he had to do is look up how often we have dined there over the years.  Guess keeping repeat, faithful customers is not on their list anymore.  All the manager repeated twice in emails was, please send your phone number so we can have a conversation and discuss these issues.  I didn't need to waste more time with the issues as they were all listed in my email to him.  Absolutely no attempt to make up for a bad experience. Service and ambiance are both fantastic, that is what kept us coming back.  Current chef is a very nice guy who we met several times.  But in the past year dining here, portions are getting much smaller and prices are going up.  They are taking advantage of their reputation trying to make higher numbers.  Sad.....used to be a guaranteed excellent dining experience.  Won't go back.",0.5608,0.861,0.079,0.06,0.5269135802469136
2016-06-26,4.0,I pick this restaurant on a friends recommendation. We went here on our anniversary night. We arrived about an hour earlier cause traffic was nil to nothing. We asked and they accommodated us for an early dinner. The place is super cool inside with some exposed beam word. They have added some new supports to help hold the old wooden beam together. Now we were seated on the second of 3 levels. We could see the whole place and that was really nice. Our server was super nice but she has memorized the script. What is in every dish and could answer most questions. When I went ff of that and asked a few different question about a dish or the preparation of certain parts she got flustered.I went for the tasting menu and the wife went with a few of their normal dishes. She started us out with some fried green tomatoes. Now we are from the south so they gave it their best shot and they were tasty but. We moved onto some blue plate oysters that were mixed in with a tangy sauce. We when thou course after course of pure yumminess. The cobia dish was one of the highlights of the meal. The wagu beef ribeye was also way up there on the yumminess factor. So of the lows were the fried morels with a seared asparagus and field peas. The morels were way overcook and really crunchy almost hard to eat. We also went in for their famous frites or french fries with a truffle butter. They were under cooked and limp. Maybe that's the way Chicago likes them but not this couple from Florida. They did however bring out a couple of really delicious dessert with Happy Anniversary wrote on the plates. It was a good meal and we enjoyed the most of it. We just had some better meals during our stay here in the windy city.,0.9941,0.829,0.156,0.015,0.48091100076394194
2016-06-03,5.0,"mk The Restaurant was on my Yelp's bucket list for a long time.  I finally had a chance to experience the restaurant during restaurant week.  The ambiance is very contemporary and upscale. There was a lot of open space with exposed wood beams throughout.  I especially loved the upper mezzanine area where you can relax and enjoy the view of the restaurant. The table started off with complimentary smoked salmon.  The waiter stated it was to start off our meal so it can open up our palettes.  The bite sized smoked salmon did just that.  It made me wanting more.  The salmon was fresh and velvety which just melted right in your mouth.  We also opted to order the shrimp toast, shrimp on a toasted baguette with truffle cream (which was not on the RW menu).  All the ingredients played well with each other.  Fresh shrimp and truffle cream....who wouldn't enjoy that combo? From the restaurant week menu, I ordered: Butternut squash soup: cumin scented with smoked mussels, spiced pepitas, and sage.  I was a little hesitant to order this since there are a lot of spices going on, but fortunately the spices wasn't overwhelming.  The soup was smooth and creamy, the mussels were cooked perfectly, and the pepitas tied everything together with the crunch. Haddock: pan seared with salt roasted marble potatoes topped with pimenton hollandaise sauce.  The haddock was perfectly cooked.  It wasn't rubbery and flaked off with the touch of a fork.  I'm not a huge fan of hollandaise sauce since it can be overwhelming sometimes, but it paired well with the fish. Chocolate Cremoux: almond toffee, whipped mascarpone, and coffee ice cream.  This was a great way to end the meal.  There was tons of flavor and textures which worked great with each other.  The chocolate wasn't too rich, the mascarpone was light and airy, the coffee ice cream was refreshing, and the toffee gave a crunch. This experience was truly amazing.  The service was spot on.  Our waiter was informative, attentive, and witty.  I'm so glad to see mk didn't cut corners when it came to restaurant week.  I can't wait until the next time I return.  Definitely highly recommend!",0.9954,0.804,0.168,0.028,0.6512108843537414

I have to mention that my friends and I have similar tastes, so we all gravitated to the same items on the menu. We first got a special drink made with rhubarb (our favorite) to toast our trip. The drink was tasty, although not much different than other fruit drinks mixed with some bubbly. We all opted to have the three course price fixed meal. You choose from two appetizers and two entrees, then get a special dessert. Some of the items available on this menu did not appear on the regular menu, so if you wanted those items, this seemed like the way to go. Our appetizers were outstanding (2 of us had ravioli, and the other had split pea soup). We all ordered the trout and it was a let down. My friend identified the problem as too much salt on the fish. My potatoes (served on the side) were under-cooked. The dish was edible, but not what we expected given the quality of the appetizers. The dessert that came with our meal was a rhubarb cobbler (again, our favorite).

The restaurant was quiet on the night we were dining.  But even if it were more packed, I think the set-up of the place allows you not to feel claustrophobic, something a lot of restaurants have issues with these days.  The wait staff was perfect- knowledgeable, funny and non-intrusive.  I was able to have all the conversation I wanted without needing to start my sentences over. We ended up being able to participate in the 4 course chef's dinner ""customized"" to our tastes.  I had previously told the chef that my date and I enjoyed fresh and clean flavors, not to be shy with vegetables and to include a form of red meat but a lot of fish.  The food was brilliant and the flow from our first course to the last was definitely well thought out (including the wine pairings).  I think I was most impressed by the MK's willingness to be bold with their flavors and to really celebrate new american cuisine by incorporating uncommon ingredients from around the world (i.e. fiddlehead ferns (!), bison, and black sesame). The night was ultimately a great success, and this restaurant is definitely a place to try if you're not into 4 month waits or small portions.  I would recommend that people try the tasting menu with wine pairings and come extra hungry.  Looking at the menu on their website now, it might not be exactly what we got, but it is sure to please.",0.9974,0.779,0.216,0.006,0.5280583613916947

Not the biggest deal since technically they were only 10 min late for our reservation, so more annoying than another else. Also seemed like a tactic to get us to order drinks before dinner since I saw them do this with everyone that arrived. I did order a drink, but not until seated. Had the raspberry vodka drink, which was good, but left a cough syrup after taste.  Now onto the meal. We went with the tasting menu and am really happy we did. We left feeling full, but in a good way, not like I was about the burst. Started off a little starter not on the menu. Nice little smoked salmon tasting. Followed by the real starter, deviled quail eggs with smoked roe on top. The roe and the smokiness was amazing with the subtle egg. The next dish was prosciutto with ricotta and frisee. Working for an Italian company, I've had my fair share of prosciutto and this was definitely some of the best. Next had the king crab which was awesome. Can't go wrong with king crab. Followed by my absolute favorite, the Kobe. The steak was seasoned so well with a nice crust on the outside and medium rare on the inside. Perfection! If they could just give me 10 more plates of that, I would have demolished it. We decided to also have the cheese course. Good, but unmemorable. Lastly, the dessert, chocolate ganache with coconut sorbet on top of cookie crumbles. The ganache is so rich, but when eaten altogether, amazing since the coconut sorbet is more subtle and offers the perfect balance. I highly recommend coming here and doing the tasting menu. One of the best I've had. Thanks MK!",0.9988,0.696,0.289,0.015,0.5365972222222223

We ordered the cod fritters appetizer and the flavor was just ok.  Needed a spicy sauce. I ordered the short-ribs and the dish was FABULOUS and moderately priced at $28.  He ordered the bison, which cost $48, and it was really salty.  Bison doesn't have much flavor, but they over compensated by putting on too much salt.  And it wasn't worth the price.   The truffle fries were really good.  The non-alcoholic drinks were better than the alcoholic drinks. I really loved the dessert. I got the s'mores and it was great.  He ordered the cake and shake.  He loved the shake, but the cake was just ok, not great.    The wait staff was outstanding.  They wrote Happy Birthday on my husband's dessert plate and that was a nice touch.  They also customized the menu with his name.  Again, a nice touch.  They gave us a $15 coupon, so we'll probably use it to return for dessert only.  I liked it, but for my husband it was just so-so.

Our server, Jessie, was pleasant and solicitous without being too hovering.  My sister and i ordered the special 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairings for $120. We opted for the cheese course which added another glass of paired wine for $5 (a great deal) All the wines were well paired except for the salad course, of which the chosen wine too fruit forward for my liking. The portions were large for a tasting menu and the food was very innovative. Example: Alaskan King crab, citrus poached fennel, shaved watermelon radish, saffron aioli and fennel pollen. Delish! All the seafood was very fresh.

We had a 7:30 reservation and the restaurant was fully packed.  Between the two of us, we both ordered the shrimp for the appetizer, the short ribs and the haddock for the main course, and the chocolate dish and bread pudding for dessert. Each shrimp appetizer came with three perfectly sauteed shrimp with dill pasta and parmesan. The pasta was really pretty but the shrimp was the star of the dish. For the main course, I found the haddock to be a overcooked and very salty. The short ribs were just okay. The flavor was decent, but the meat itself was a little tough and it honestly felt like somebody just threw a huge hunk of meat on my plate... The grits and kale that came with the short ribs, however, were delicious and cooked very well. Lastly for dessert, came the chocolate mousse with coffee ice cream and the bread pudding with fruit and walnuts and vanilla ice cream. The chocolate mousse was decent- it was a little too rich for my taste, especially after such a heavy entree. The bread pudding, however, was not too sweet and was very balanced. The fruit was a great addition and the candied walnuts added that perfect crunch.  Overall, I'd give the food at MK a 3.5 stars. Maybe the kitchen was having an off day, but the haddock and the short ribs were slightly disappointing... I'm bumping MK up to 4 stars for the exceptional service. The servers were extremely attentive, offering us plenty of bread and repeatedly filling our water glasses. Our waiter even kindly brought out doggie bags and joked with us throughout the night.

It makes it feel quiet and relaxing for dining. I also enjoyed that we could talk to each other and hear each other. Not a loud restaurant at all. Overall impression, the food was OK and did not match the prices. We spent over $400 and I felt I could have eatn a bit more. I also hate when a restaurant serves you at $13 beer (not even the whole beer) when it really costs $8 elsewhere. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful enough. My fiance felt she was a little snobish and not very personable. She did help us through the menu and choosing dishes for the table. As a group we thought we would have the bright idea of ordering several of the small plates and then between the couples share an entree. This was probably a wrong move. The small plates are really small. Not for sharing at all. The entrees were also pretty light. The small plates that came out were the Kale, risotto, tartare and  octopus. First the Kale, it is the largest small plate we ordered. Lots of kale with Bartlett pears for a sweet factor. I hate goat cheese and surprising I did not taste any one the salad. The tartare is three very thin small pieces of Hamachi, which I could hardly taste. The risotto was a beautiful creamy white pile with the black truffles as contrast on top. It looked really pretty and  would have hogged this and cleared the plate in two bites. I had to be nice and share with the rest of the table. We are told the octopus is MK's specialty and that they are known for it. So, we took their word for it. This was the last dish we cleared because nobody at the table wanted seconds. I am not a huge fan of octopus and expected that the way the dish was explained to me, once I tasted it I would love octopus. Nope, not so. Moving on to the entrees. It took a while for them to arrive after our small plates were removed. We all went through another beer. Good ploy to get us to order more alcohol. Again, on the recommendation both of us ordered the Tuna. Again, this is one of their main stays and specialties. The tuna was pretty good. A little too much pepper on the outside. It made my mouth burn. If I brushed some off, I was able to enjoy the tuna more. When I took a bite of the tuna, mushrooms with the red wine sauce it was an amazing flavor combination.  There were a lot of great sounding entrees on the menu.

The risotto, sadly, fell from the mark a little bit - it just wasn't too flavorful.  But my soup was delicious and my friend's gemelli was delicious - meat sauce and excellent pasta.  Then the mains came around.  I had the bison steak - lean and very well seasoned and flavorful.

When I read some of the bad reviews they were all about how much it cost so I have to admit, at first I thought people were just being cheap. Well, I have to admit I was wrong , it really is this restaurant's fault- they are ridiculously overpriced and rude.  I went for my friend's birthday and when we first sat down the waiter proceeded to pass out champagne glasses. No one ordered them so I asked if it was champagne because the birthday girl and the majority of the guests do not drink alcohol for religious purposes. The waiter then stated, ""no its lemonade/san pelligrino, I know boring right?"" How rude to call a paying customer boring for not drinking. I replied with ""Could I have real champagne instead just for me and my bf?"" He said yes and I didn't realize til I received the bill that he charged me $20 per glass for the tiny flute of champagne and $177 for the lemonade/san pelligrino. They never even ordered the lemonade and so I assumed when I asked him I was requesting the champagne be complimentary as well. Then to make matters worse, we brought a cake for her birthday and they charged $180 to simply cut the cake! No, I'm not kidding- one hundred eighty dollars to cut cake that we brought. So unethical.  Then we asked to speak to the manager who did nothing when we explained that we were not informed of these prices ahead of time. He only took off the lemonade because they did not order it. How sneaky though to try to serve a birthday party lemonade and water and charge them for it.  Then, we called and asked for the owner and managers email. They refused to give us the owner's work contact email, so we emailed a different manager to explain what happened. This was a month ago and we were never contacted with an apology or explanation. The food was nothing special and the valet was nowhere to be found when we arrived for an extended period of time. Customer service is awful. Definitely do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. And if you go, ask how much everything is before you get it and check your bill.

We started with the heirloom tomato salad and it was probably one of the freshest and most flavorful tomato combinations I have had. MK prides itself on using only the freshest and most seasonal ingredients and you can certainly taste this in each dish. The goat cheese dates were also delicious and were a sweet way to start our meal.  For my main course, I ended up getting the tuna after much deliberation. I was very happy I went with it though- the tuna was perfectly seared and I loved the shitake mushrooms on the side. For some sides for the table- don't miss the pomme frites and and grilled rapini with honey. The rapini was surprising with its contrasting bitter/sweet flavors-it was very creative.  Save room for dessert and I would recommend the sampler where you can try a little taste of everything.  The service was impeccable and the decor is very modern but also inviting. There are some usual art pieces which you can read about in the menu-it adds something extra to the overall atmosphere and experience.",0.9965,0.754,0.235,0.011,0.6096031746031746
2015-11-08,5.0,"In short, MK was hands down absolutely amazing.  From the moment we stepped foot inside, we were treated so well (it didn't even matter that we looked like two teenagers!) I wanted to give the bistro suppers a try given that the menu for that particular night looked delicious. From the first intricate slender breadsticks to our very last drop of coconut brownie dessert, dinner was homey, yet innovative. It truly met my expectation of what a bistro supper should be like.  I can't even pick out my favorite dish of the night as all the plates were so fantastic. The roasted golden and red beet salad was super tasty and was complemented nicely by the watercress. The chicken pot pie really brought me back to my childhood with the pie crust on top baked to absolute perfection. Finger-licking good. To top it all off, dessert was the BEST cheesecake I've EVER tasted. It was made with fresh vanilla beans, the world's MOST DELICIOUS graham cracker crust and topped with a refreshing mixed berry compote. No joke - sweet, savory, sour - you got all of that in one small bite. Please put this on the regular menu for dessert! Thank you to the wonderful chefs in the kitchen - all the creations were delicious! Extra plus: in between every main dish, our waiter Nico surprised us with small complimentary bites from the kitchen: first, a small beet salad bite; second, crab cakes; third, a coconut brownie and orange gummy bite. Extra extra plus: we had also ordered the frites from the bar menu (okay, fries with TRUFFLE CREAM - do yourself a favor and get these!!) and at the end of the meal, we also learned that they threw it in as a complimentary appetizer as well! I was absolutely floored by how wonderful the service was from start to finish.  Finally, a special shout out to our waiter Nico who was just such a sweet and very professional guy. He took care of us, made us feel right at home, popped by to check on us at all the right moments, and was just a lovely person to be around. **Edit** I recently tuned into Food Network's Guy's Grocery Games and watched Chef Erick win! So amazing. Congratulations Chef and I am sure the folks at your church will do amazing things with that money. Happy Thanksgiving!",0.999,0.707,0.281,0.012,0.5379381092495845
2015-10-28,4.0,"So I made reservations  here for my two year anniversary with my girlfriend. It was going to be a lovely night until it started raining on our way there. We were able to push back our reservation due to traffic, which was nice, and the valet guy was very quick to help us out both going in and leaving the restaurant. When you first walk in, it feels almost like a private food club, but the waiters were very friendly and it was easy to become comfortable in the setting.  As for the food, I knew it would be high priced and small portioned, which is everything that goes against what my taste-buds believe. However, everything that came our way was 100% delicious, and satisfying... to a point. Salumi was our appetizer. I ordered the Halibut and my girlfriend ordered the Falafel. I've loved Halibut forever and their purple peruvian potatoes complimented it quite well. As for the Falefel, the waiter said he never liked Falefel, but the one from the restaurant made him a believer, as did it to my girlfriend.  Overall, I would only go here for a special occasion. I would also never go with a group. If you want to get full without spending your entire paycheck, this, unfortunately is not the place. If you want a place that respects and can acknowledge your preferences and give you everything you need to know, this is your place. But as fancy is the scenery was, it was a bit loud for your typical fine dining; also felt a little crammed. Valet wasn't super nice, but it was quick and effective.

We got the lobster soup for appetizer - 4.5/5. Soup is creamy and tasty, took half a point off for the small portion. We got the market fish and the duck for main course. Market fish (5/5) This is the whole fish. Fresh, tender fish meat and crispy skin - perfectly cooked. Highly recommended if you love seafood. Roasted Duck (3.5/5) The duck is okay, my wife and I both think it was too salty. End up packing this home. Dessert - The killing me S'mores is really good (5/5). I think this is a must-get. The dark chocolate is very tasty, not sure if it was homemade or not.  The chocolate cake and shake (4/5) is really just a piece of regular chocolate cake and a very small milkshake. And I want to point out that the service is amazing. Very attentive server and he also bought us some free sample food. Decoration is special. Great location near the Chicago Brown line.

Unfortunately, our experience did not meet expectations. The restaurant does have a pleasant atmosphere and decor. However, some of the food was disappointing. The pumpkin soup had a very mild taste and lacked character. The octopus was surprisingly spicy and the spices overwhelmed the mild taste of the octopus. The risotto was average and a little on the soft side. The quail was very good. The bison filet was great and done just right. Serving bison with kale seemed to be a poor match. Not sure how many people ordering bison are enthusiastic about kale. The deserts may be a hit with kids and teenagers, but no one in our party found them worth getting.

2015-10-12,2.0,"The food was good but underwhelming. We were a party of three anxious to dine at MK because of all the positive reviews posted on the internet. We started off by ordering several selections from the appetizer and small plate menu. Fritters, figs, crab toast and the very popular grilled octopus.  Interesting but lacking that wow factor. The octopus was tender but it was  difficult to get past the char. I would liken it to eating a marshmallow that fell into the fire. For our main course my wife ordered the whitefish /lobster while my aunt and I had the roasted peaking duck breast. The whitefish/lobster was tasty and the lobster portion was very generous. The duck on the other hand lacked seasoning and had zero flavor.  You had to smother it in the blueberry reduction but at that point you might as well be eating Salisbury steak.  The service, with the exception of our server Sergio,  was excellent.  Most reviews rate the service as excellent. Maybe it was just an off night for Sergio, who seemed more interested in conversing with the patrons at the bar than tending to his tables. Three times we had to ask someone to find him for us.

The striped bass and seafood mix and broth for our entree were killer and the dessert coconut macaroons and mini brownie bites were out of this world.

2015-10-01,5.0,"WOW. There's no other way to start out my review of MK The Restaurant than with such an impressed interjection!  MK went above and beyond my expectations for making a special occasion really special. Despite any minor complaints, MK overwhelmingly delivered us a really fantastic experience!  Things I loved:  -The host was awesome. He immediately wished us a happy anniversary when we got there, and he later checked in with us to see what desserts we wanted. He asked the kitchen to bring out an extra shake for us, so we actually ended up getting 1.5 complimentary desserts, which was very generous of them. He also was happy to take our picture before we left (our waiter was too busy).  -The salmon amuse bouche was OUT OF THIS WORLD. And I hate fish.  -The pomme frites were outstanding, and honestly the best I've ever had in the city. Yes, even better than the fries I've enjoyed at Au Cheval and The Publican. MK definitely takes the cake. The fries were not cooked in canola oil, but something that doesn't taste as horrible (maybe a nut oil). The truffle cream sauce was the stuff of gods. Very tasty. Very generous portion.  -My duck entree was also tasty (just not on the same level as those pomme frites).  -Complimentary champagne before we perused the drink menu. We weren't planning on drinking more than one drink anyway, so we saved $30 in the cocktails we would have ordered.  -Both of the desserts had ""Happy Anniversary!"" written on them, which was such a kind gesture. We've celebrated occasions at fancy restaurants before, but none of them did that.  -We overall felt like we weren't the only ones celebrating our special day; MK was right there celebrating along with us. Very special feeling!  Minor complaints:  -The cake and shake dessert did not have any ""wow"" factor necessarily. It tasted like your everyday cake and vanilla bean milkshake. I wonder if the food quality not being quite up to par is a reason it does not have a Michelin star. (But that's all fairly arbitrary anyway; I know I put too much stake in the Michelin ratings at times.)  -Our server, Sergio, was a bit hot and cold. When he did come to our table, he was very over-the-top (in a good way) with ""Here is complimentary champagne because you are celebrating a VERY special occasion, your anniversary"" and he also shook our hands and gave us his business card at the end of the meal. However, he got really distracted with a table of eight, and his attentiveness significantly dropped.  -Crumbs from our meal were left on the white tablecloth the entire meal.  -There was a plate with a lime on it sitting behind us that clearly was from someone who had dined earlier and no one had noticed to clean it up.  Overall, this was a truly OUTSTANDING experience by which all future dining experiences will be measured.",0.9989,0.725,0.238,0.038,0.5670753375977259
2015-09-29,5.0,"MK gave us a really special one-year anniversary dinner. We arrived for our Monday 6:30 PM reservation and we were were immediately congratulated with a ""Happy Anniversary!"" We've dined at a bunch of fine dining establishments for special occasions, and this was the first place where this happened. We were originally going to be seated at table 41, but then he asked if we would prefer to sit somewhere more intimate in a corner booth so we could sit next to each other. Having never sat side by side at a fancy restaurant before, we took him up on the offer; we were not disappointed. We were also greeted with anniversary congratulations from two other MK staff as we walked to our table, which felt very special.  Our server, Sergio, brought us champagne on the house to ""celebrate the very special anniversary."" He also brought us menus (for the tasting) with ""happy 1st anniversary!"" written at the top. A personalized menu was also something we haven't experienced before, so we really appreciated it. We opted out of starters having eaten late lunches, so we began by ordering entrees. I ordered the walleye/lobster dish and my boyfriend got the duck with the pomme frites. While we were waiting, we enjoyed the amuse bouche salmon bite. My boyfriend despises fish, but he really enjoyed this, which is saying something!  This was honestly the first time I've ever had walleye (I had only ordered the dish because of the lobster, which I know I enjoy), so I can't fault MK for it, but it was not my favorite fish. The sauce and seasoning definitely helped mask that ""fishy"" taste that I dislike so much, so much so that I actually got through half the dish before tasting anything unsavory (to my palette). The lobster was delicious, and I wish there had been more of it, as the walleye overwhelmed the dish. Despite all of this, I would still venture to say it was a ""good"" dish, although I would try a different dish upon dining here again. We shared the pomme frites and they ended up being the highlight of our meal! For $9, we got a pretty large portion and the truffle cream was outstanding. We tried our best, but couldn't finish!  The manager/host dropped by our table after we finished our entrees, and asked us what we were thinking for dessert. We said we decided on the cake and shake and (when asked) stated our second choice was the s'mores dish. He said they would bring us out an extra milkshake, which was really sweet. They brought us out both desserts with ""Happy Anniversary!"" written on the plates. Sergio dropped by and noticed that the kitchen had only brought out the two shakes (but not the cake), so he had that brought out. It was a very sugary, delicious feast. I have to say that the chocolate cake and shake weren't anything special necessarily, but were still delicious (and cute). My favorite was the ""You're killing me s'mores"" dish.  On our way back to the parking garage, we tried to figure out why MK doesn't have a Michelin star. This was our first upscale Chicago restaurant not to receive one, and it was a bit baffling. Perhaps the Michelin reviewer was also unimpressed by the walleye! Regardless of some little particulars (and that's only me completely nitpicking), we received great service and a very special anniversary meal here.  The final bill with tax and gratuity was $130, which was VERY reasonable for a $$$$ restaurant. We have certainly paid much more for places listed as $$$ on Yelp. We left very full (and with leftovers!), satisfied, and pleased with our choice of MK for our anniversary dinner.",0.999,0.757,0.201,0.042,0.6189157509157509

A bit pricey but all in all a nice place to bring a date. I hate to say they lacked originality because everything was so good.  We were planning to eat and MK back in July for my birthday but the restaurant canceled our reservation because they were filming ...maybe it was Empire I have no idea... Out of the kindness of their heart they gave us $100 voucher.  Starting on the right foot we arrived at our 730 reservation for a party of two and we're seated promptly. They set us at a table that would be normally for four people which was nice so we had extra space but it was near the bathroom which was minus. The restaurant was full of couples enjoying their own wine and small talk. I ordered a glass of Malbec and my wife ordered a cocktail which had pomegranate in it. The wine was very drinkable from the beginning and my wife really love the cocktail.  They had a tasting menu which we saw a lot of tables order but we decided to order a la carte which worked out to be about the same price but we got to eat what we wanted. Before appetizer came out they provided a free plate known in Korea as service which was a single bite of shrimp and squash. Not memorable but it was a nice gesture.  My wife measures a restaurant by the quality of their bread and the bread was excellent. They had French bread some other bread and focaccia. Eat the focaccia. For the appetizer we ordered crab toast as well as a foie gras plate. The crab toast had a lot of crab which was nice and the foie gras was a good portion with some lovely topping of arugula, apricots and nuts. The bread they serve with the foie gras reminded me of a fruitcake biscotti, which isn't necessarily bad given the richness of foie gras.  For the main course my wife had the halibut for the hell of it and I had the bison but I like to call it m. bison (street fighter reference). The halibut was light and fresh and the bison was expectedly lean and cooked to a perfect medium rare. We also had some pomme fries that was a yummy Susie's style fries cut with some truffle oil and truffle aioli....yummy but got a bit salty near the bottom (which makes sense). The non-waitstaff really cared about what they were doing, they gave me a lot of water which I like and they also asked if our french fries were too salty because it was a problem earlier in the night.  For dessert we had panna cotta and an interpretation of a deconstructed Smore which was the highlight of creativity with a Graham cracker ice cream.  With the check they also gave a small cookie and a small brownie complementary which made me from full to mega full.   While there were a few minuses all in all in enjoyable evening which I would recommend and probably eat at again. A bit pricey.  ps they played good music including a smooth version of no diggity.",0.9984,0.766,0.192,0.042,0.5518
2015-08-22,2.0,"Wow - I literally feel like we were selected for a poor dining experience - as in, the opposite of they see a restaurant critic and give them an unnaturally good experience - we had an unnaturally bad experience.   It started when we walked in (on time) for our 8PM reservation and the host told us that it would be about 15 minutes until our table was ready.  Fine, this happens not infrequently.  We were told we could wait in the lounge area, and proceeded there, where absolutely no one came over to greet us or bring us a menu for over 5 minutes.  Finally, we gave up and sat at the bar.  The bartender immediately said, ""oh, we can bring you guys menus over at the lounge if you want"" ... we looked at each other as in ""yeah, tried that and it was a fail"" and told him we would stay at the bar.  He took our order (two sodas, since we were planning to have a bottle of wine at dinner and had already had cocktails elsewhere, and also the truffle fries).  I understand that if the bar was full he might have wanted to keep seats for customers ordering drinks but (1) there was literally ONE other couple at the bar and tons of free seats, (2) it was not our fault we were kept waiting and (3) we ordered food so it's not like we were just drinking water.  Anyways...after over 20 minutes (sitting directly in front of the host stand, I might add) we had not heard any news about our table NOR did anyone come over to apologize for the continued wait.  We finally broke down and asked.  We were eventually escorted to our table around 8:30.  After looking at the wine menu, we had a few questions.  Our waiter tried (and failed) to answer them and after several minutes of muddling through, he finally offered to bring over the sommelier.  Now, if a restaurant is nice enough to have a sommelier, I would expect that he would have offered to bring her over first thing instead of trying to give us (bad) advice about the wine on his own.  Anyways, after over 10 minutes she had not come, and he checked back in and seemed surprised that she had not been by yet.  After another 5 or so minutes (so 15 minutes after he offered to get her) she came over, gave some decent advice, and then it took another 15 minutes to bring the wine (again, our waiter circled back after saying that the wine would be ""right there"" and seemed surprised that it had not arrived after 15 minutes).  So basically it was 30 minutes from sitting until we got the bottle of wine.  Also during that time, I saw the person with the bread basket LITERALLY look at our table, and then LOOK AWAY without bringing us bread!  After he had already offered the table next to us their second serving of bread.  Finally we asked about the bread, and after another 10 minutes or so we received it, without any sort of apology. At this time, it had been so long that we decided to skip appetizers and just order a main course.  I ordered the falafel (the only vegetarian main course available) and my husband ordered the tuna.  His tuna was pretty decent, and probably one of the few reasons I give the restaurant 2 stars instead of 1.  My falafel was greasy on the outside, but the middle was fairly good (nice and light).  The accompanying vegetables were too oily and somewhat soggy, which was a disappointment AND left me feeling hungry....basically I had truffle fries and bread/butter and some greasy falafel for dinner.  Ugh.  We were quite disgruntled at this point and took a look at the dessert menu but decided to leave and go elsewhere to finish up the night.  The ONLY thing that was prompt about service the whole night was how quickly our waiter brought the bill!  And, unlike in most nice restaurants where even if you do not order dessert they bring a small sweet with the check, there was none of that here.  We were basically made to feel that the sooner we left, the better. Lastly, for those who wonder if we presented ourselves poorly and that's why we got bad service - not so.  We were well-dressed (my husband in a jacket, shirt, and nice jeans, and myself in a pretty nice dress - the same one I wore when we went to Jean Georges in NYC) and we also were polite and respectful to the staff.  Additionally, we were having an intelligent but not inflammatory conversation and did not talk excessively loud (i.e. we were basically the opposite of the annoying guests that talk walk into a nice place in rumpled clothes, drink too much, and about controversial political topics in a loud and disrespectful manner).  I would definitely NOT return here when there are so many choices in Chicago.  What a disappointment!  Luckily, the night was saved by the amazing cocktails at Violet Hour (had one before coming to MK) and we finished the night up at our other favorite spot, Watershed (will be writing reviews of both places soon).  But I definitely would not suggest MK - perhaps we had an ""odd one out"" experience since it otherwise seems so popular, but we were definitely VERY disappointed.",0.9963,0.839,0.113,0.049,0.5589992702061667

It's not often you bite into seafood when you're so far inland and you can literally taste the sea. It was so fresh and flavorful!  Next were entrees: My friend had a 7oz filet that was to die for. She kept closing her eyes and chewing really slowly so I KNOW it blew her mind. Hah! I'm a seafood girl so I went with the whitefish topped with lobster. Melted in my mouth like butter. Absolutely delicious. Finally, dessert. She chose a peach blueberry crumble that she pretty much ate with her eyes closed out of bliss the whole time.  I was brought ""You're Killing Me, S'mores"". A dish consisting of dark chocolate, flambéed marshmallows, graham cracker ice cream, and Spanish peanuts. Like a deconstructed s'mores. ""Happy Birthday"" was written in chocolate sauce along the edge of the plate! The taste was DIVINE and I wish I could recreate it! Before the bill arrived, there were two complimentary treats sent from the kitchen. An orange chocolate truffle and a blueberry fruit chew. Both were perfect!  I would come back in a heartbeat and I will be recommending this place to everyone looking for not just a meal, but an experience! Thank you, MK!",0.998,0.701,0.263,0.036,0.5689123376623376

Definitely up in the 1-star Michelin range too. Ambiance seemed fancy, but they only have a business casual dress code so it didn't seem too stuffy here. Coats not required here. Awesome!  So with their special NYE tasting menu, I also opted for the wine pairing which went well with each course. For this evening I had the oysters, scallops, wagyu beef and some citrus dessert.

2015-06-02,4.0,"This is a really tasty restaurant, came with a colleague and we enjoyed -- but since it appears to be trying to be incredibly upscale and elegant, I did notice a few things that really kind of dinged a star off. started with an amuse bouche -- cured salmon. it was really tasty, and I don't normally like salmon! the bread - there were 3 options - a focaccia, a sourdough, and a baguette. I tried both the focaccia and the sour dough, and both were very tasty, fresh, correct amount of softness. Served with soft butter that was really tasty - my coworker commented on how good the butter was. appetizers: - i had the english pea risotto. it was out of this world delicious. not too large of a serving, so you're not filling up, but so tasty, so light, i could have eaten a vat of it. - colleague had the endive salad, sans cheese. it was okay. she didn't bother to finish it. - a note on the service: our waiter was incredibly nice and attentive throughout the evening. We always had full water glasses, and he gave several good recommendations on the menu. That said, I have a high bar for upscale dining, so I couldn't help but notice that he removed my risotto dish, as I was finished, before my colleague had finished eating her salad. That is a huge no no, as it makes the other person feel like they either need to stop eating, or rush to finish their appetizer. Also, when he did this, the crumbs that had been left on the table in front of me from the sourdough were revealed...but he did not do anything to remove them. I'll note that later in the evening when the entrees were removed, and a stray french fry piece was on the table, his little scrape-y thing did make an appearance for him to get that and crumbs off the table. So why not earlier with the bread crumbs? entrees: - i had the chicken dish. it was pretty good. potato puree in particular was tasty, chicken was not dry, prepped in 3 ways, way too much for me to finish, but on the whole very tasty. leeks not as much, for whatever reason. - colleague had the whitefish with lobster and appeared to enjoy it. looked a more reasonable portion size than mine. - we also got a side order of frites with truffle sauce...these were pretty fantastic. really tasty. 1 order would be plenty for 2-3 people -- we didn't finish the order we shared. desserts: - i ordered the strawberry fields forever. it was highly disappointing. the pine nuts added nothing to the dish. the strawberry sorbet was okay. the vanilla lavender panna cotta was fairly tasty - I like when you can see the vanilla beans in it, and this did not disappoint. what did disappoint was that the strawberries were not fresh - they were noticeably of the frozen-and-thawed variety, which changes the texture, and was just incredibly disappointing and not tasty. its june, why aren't you using fresh strawberries? - colleague got the chocolate cake with shake. she was really disappointed by the chocolate cake - I guess just not her style/flavor profile. I didn't try it. she did enjoy the shake that came with it though. on the whole, I'd say it was a very tasty restaurant, with just a few things that they need to do to improve to 5 stars. colleague agreed that she enjoyed, but felt that she probably wouldn't come again on her own dime - she would save this for business meals being expensed. I would probably agree - if the entree and dessert had been as delicious as the risotto i would have no problem bringing my husband for a special occasion, but as it stands now, I probably wouldn't return on my own dime, but would give it another chance on business travel. pricing felt reasonable for the quality - for the two of us to dine, with no alcoholic beverages, the meal came to ~$150 pre-tip.

However, maybe the lesson is to not order seafood when you aren't on the coast. Being from MD, I was excited to order the MD soft shell crab cake. It was so heavily battered that I could have been eating fast food fried clams. The endive salad was terrific - we didn't order it but it was brought to apologize for the long wait to get our orders (that was not a problem - it was a leisurely social dinner). However, the tuna was terrible, not at all fresh. The fries, which seem popular on the reviews, were definitely not the best either.

We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance and asked if it was OK to bring a baby in a stroller. When we made the reservations they said it was fine as long as we reserved for one extra person to ensure there would be space. We made a reservation for 5 (4 adults and 1 stroller). When we got to the restaurant the hostess told us that they would be unable to accommodate us because thy did not have enough space for the stroller. There were several open tables (though they said the dining room was full) and the table that was going to be ours had more than enough room around it (it was a corner table). We asked for the manager, who is also the owner- Lisa Kornick. She was extremely rude and said, again, that they had no space. After explaining to her that we had explicitly made the reservations for a stroller, she said that she didn't want the baby (who was quietly sleeping) to be anywhere near other tables because if she cried, she would bother them. We ended up having plenty of space and she slept the entire dinner. If you have never been, the restaurant is very loud (NOT a quiet place where a baby crying would be bothersome) and there are always many children (there were at least 3-4 when we ate last night). I was very disappointed in her unwillingness  to accommodate us and it is clear that they discriminate against people with babies. Will not be going back.

We were lucky enough to chat with Michael (the Owner/Chef) before we ordered, and he customized a ""Tasting Menu Plus"" for us. That was perfect because we wanted to try everything on the standard tasting menu, but a number of different items on the a la carte menu also caught our eye.

2015-05-06,5.0,"You forget, sometimes, what a gem this restaurant is and how it has stood the test of time (15+ years, I believe). Well, last night I was reminded of the genius that is Michael Kornick coupled with the support staff that operates like clockwork.  First, some kudos to the staff. Chris was our server; he is as genuine as they come and no doubt creates the kind of atmosphere that makes you love the dining experience before you've had a sip or a bite. We never felt rushed. And he was always there with suggestions - a few I would have ruled out by their description on the menu, but we are thankful we followed his direction. Sandra is the sommelier and she couldnt have been more welcoming. We would have gone with something simple and white, but she suggested a wine we had never heard of and went with it (sorry, I don't remember what it was -- had too much). It was the perfect recommendation and she was respectful of our price point. We expect big things from this woman; she's a true asset to the MK name. I would also like to mention Jesus, a manager, who has been with MK for several years and made it a point to come over and introduce himself; he also brought out a few complimentary tasting desserts to cap off the night. The guy made us feel at home, which is how it should be. All in all, my girlfriend and I were treated like royalty, which is how I imagine everyone is treated at MK. The whole experience put us in the perfect mood.  Ok, now the food. We had the quinoa fritters (Chris' recommendation), the octopus (a tinge spicy but probably some of the best octopus we've ever had), the whitefish/lobster combo (can't go wrong) and ""you're killing me s'mores"" for dessert (a deconstructed s'more). The food was on point.   If you are in the market for a timeless, polished restaurant for a date or with family, don't let this gem fall off the radar in your quest for the newest, most trendy bistro.

2015-04-23,5.0,"I only have one night in Chicago. Based on some reviews and the recommendation of the concierge at the hotel, I'm about to embark on MK's tasting menu. The menu seems to be spring based with a vegetable / seafood focus. I've started with a well made old fashioned and had a solid amuse of roasted beets and tarragon.  I'm sat at the bar so I don't look like Billy-no-mates at one of the tables, and to be honest I'm not sure the bar is geared up to serving food. I had a little wait before I had a drink order. My wine pairing has sat on the table for 5 minutes without a dish to accompany it. But they're probably better geared towards serving food in the tabled section so I won't knock them for service.  Unless my first course doesn't arrive soon.  OK. My second course just arrived which makes me think the beets were a first course and not an amuse. That means my wines are off order. If I have wine pairings I want to make sure they're with the right course.   Wondering where my soup went to.  Asked, and they are indeed off order. I'm comfortable and the old fashion is still doing it's job so not feeling like the mess up is impacting the experience yet.  I'm going to judge on food.  So far I haven't had any. Except my beets. Which were good.  OK. Garlic soup with King Crab is very good. Not overpowering in the slightest but also not over roasted which could add a monotone aspect to the soup. Good base of garlic which allows the other flavors to layer on top without having to complete. King crab was good, but didn't show as well as some more simple crab dishes. Doesn't set you up to destroy other courses with the garlic. Wine was well paired and found itself in a crisp refreshing place that only a rose will get to with certain flavors.  I've been served my second wine and am anticipating some artichokes. I'm holding off on tasting wines until I get food and would prefer they were served at the same time.  Standards, and the temperature of a well chilled Riesling, should never be allowed to drop.  Wow. Artichokes arrived and in all honesty tasted like eating a lemon peel. UNTIL you drink the wine with it. Holy guacamole. That's a strong dish. The floral elements of the plate include herbs and citrus. I'm a little speechless. Some deeper nuttiness to provide a low undercoat to the flavor.  Really well thought out and the soft crunch of the artichoke suggests well executed.  I have my third wine pairing, but not third course. An equivalent to a burgundy I'm told, that means I'm excited. When drinking white I'm most fond of a Chablis and like how they pair with a stronger seafood. I can't remember what course 3 is, so we will see.  So I got some halibut. Haven't had the scallops yet. The restaurant manager just pointed out we may be off again.  In fairness, I'm happy to hear this. I thought I'd be wasting the white burgundy with halibut. I'm excited to see how it works with scallops.  Therefore a little pause again.  Let's see whether the food saves the day again. Surely they can't keep impressing.  Yes they can. Scallops are ridiculous. It's not that they come with a braised morel mushroom side, or a tasty herbaceous beurre blanc. It's how darn well the scallops are cooked. Also, who uses braised celery in a dish like this? These people. And damn they use it well.  On second thoughts it may be the beurre blanc. I just dipped my finger in and it's pretty tremendous. Deep flavors. Nope, the cooking of the scallops... Got pairing number four. We've gone red, but like I say the food is mainly seafood based. So I'm expecting this is where the halibut comes into play.  Not halibut. Soul. With a roasted cauliflower and Australian  black truffle.  Good or great? Flavors? Good. Idea? Great.  I was bemoaning the lack of meat dish on the tasting menu and now I see why. That took it's place. The roasted cauliflower added a base to the flavor which, when paired with the soul and the truffle was really good. Like I say, not a great dish, but well cooked and well conceived and fit beautifully into the meal.  I think I'm onto dessert. I want to be onto dessert. I'm feeling a bit full. I think I'm getting crepes.  Forgot the cheese course.  Good cow milk creamy cheese that fits well with the other courses. Paired with another Riesling.  Scratch dessert. Too full. Nope, just delivered. Good flavors but I make a better crepe.  Honestly don't care because I feel replete from an amazing dining experience. They waived the wine pairings based on the previous mess ups. By no means did they need to because I came here for good food. Exactly what I got.  Great all around.",0.9989,0.746,0.184,0.07,0.5256190476190474
2015-04-20,4.0,"We went there for dinner and an anniversary.  They printed a message on the menus for our occasion..a nice touch.  The food was good. Started with bison sliders, which were very good. The whitefish and lobster was better than the steak.  Every dish that had a sauce of some sort (lobster, chicken and the sorbet) were all great.  A ton of flavor in the sauces and potato puree. The food wasn't mind blowing at this price range.  The real star here was the dessert.  The cake and shake dessert is a fun dish with very good flavor.  The best dessert here and possibly one of the best I've ever had is the S'mores dessert...it's deconstructed and packed with flavor...so much depth in the chocolate and the Spanish peanuts really add some texture.  I don't know if I'd go here regularly for the meal, but definitely for the dessert.

He offered helpful suggestions for the entrees, and I ordered a delicious steak that was almost the best I've ever had in the city, and I've had a lot (I have to say it comes in close second to David Burke's).  The desert was even better than the meal, and I'm not normally a desert person. It was a delicious (and beautifully presented) chocolate and ice cream dish with nuts.

Here's what we ate: Crab Toast Oysters Tartare Duo Bison  Lobster/White Fish French Fries Seasonal Citrus desset (Corn Cake with Marscapone Ice Cream) Cake and Shake The crab toast was phenomenal (like a really delicate crab salad on very crunchy toast), I wouldn't change anything about it. They Oysters (from some place off the coast of Prince Edward Island) were the best I've had in Chicago. I thought the tartare was a disappointment (the tuna was minced very finely and given a very strange texture), but it was not bad, per se. This was my first time eating bison and It was beautifully cooked and the sauce on the plate was delicious. I thought the white fish/lobster plate was also good, though not particularly memorable (it was my boyfriend's plate though and he thought it was memorable).  I'm not sure what they cook the french fries in, I'm guessing some kind of animal fat...because I forsook all of the potatoes on my bison plate to eat the french fries instead.  The corn cake dessert was delicious. I think the Corn cake was the best cake I've had all year and the ice cream it came with was good.  The cake that came with the cake and shake was okay, but the malted vanilla shake it came with was PHENOMENAL. Probably the best milkshake I've had in my life. Very very good. If they served that shake with the corn cake, they would change lives. The fresh baked bread  and butter they came around with was also good, as was the amuse buche.

And more importantly, the food gets similar treatment.  I had hamachi crudo and a bison steak with sunchokes and fennel, all of which were delicious, in a very simple way.  The fish had a great texture and flavor.  The steak was extremely rare and extremely tasty.  The vegetables were just very simply handled.   Indeed, if I had a complaint, it would be that sometimes it's actually okay for a restaurant not to be gentle to an ingredient -- to cook it a great deal, to combine it, to flavor it intensely, or to to transform it into something else.  Indeed, at this price point one might reasonably ask whether they've really done anything that difficult or interesting to the admittedly delicious ingredients. At the same time, I've been to so many places that do horrible things to otherwise innocent and delicious ingredients that I'm hardly going to complain about a place that is gentle to them.  As has been said in another context, MK might be the ""librarian who talks too softly.""",0.9889,0.727,0.197,0.076,0.6981746031746032

2014-12-30,3.0,"I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend tonight. I had high hope of this place but turned out to be very disappointing. We ordered crab toast which was fine, the crab and the truffle cream was good combination.  The second appetizer we ordered was two tartares; the tuna is lack of taste and the celery remoulade on top didn't help to enhance the flavor of the tuna or made the tuna taste any better. The Moroccan olive on the side is only source of saltiness. The second tartar was Atlantic fluke which is the worst tartar ever; it was so fishy which is the worst thing can be happened in a fish dish. There were some fennel with this tartar, again, it didn't help to make the fish taste any better. It seems like the chef tried so hard to find ingredients to pair with the fishes but it didn't come out right. We ordered two entrees, whitefish with lobster and bison. Let's start with the whitefish with lobster; the whitefish was a joke! It is like I'm chewing a piece of fillet with fish texture but without a taste fish and I cannot taste a hint of freshness of the whitefish. This dish also came with couple pieces of shrimps and they were just some low grade small shrimps which really not worth to talk about. The broth was so salty, it almost covered all the flavor of the seafood. The lobster was the only thing that was ok for this dish. My advise for the restaurant is to order better ingredients, if the ingredients fail then your dish cannot be any good. I guess people willing to go to MK wont mind paying extra few bucks for a better quality of food.  The bison was flavorful and cooked right. The dessert was surprisingly good after all the disappointment. We ordered the bread pudding; it was warm and not too sweet. The chai tea ice cream was delicious.  Conclusion, the service was good and the food was meh..... All the fish dishes failed!! Price and quality doesn't match. Please order better ingredients to serve your customers if this the price you want to charge. There is a lot of room for improvement for the food.",0.9449,0.733,0.153,0.113,0.5275170068027212
2014-12-29,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences of my life. The past three years I really struck out when it came to my much-celebrated birthday dinner.  Bouts of high prices, OK food and less than stellar service pretty much set the bar low for whatever restaurant I chose to ring in another year of my life. And to be honest, MK was not my first choice, but it was one of my choices and I was excited to try it. We arrived for our reservation at which point the host, coat room attendant and another waiter all wished me a 'happy birthday'.  This is exactly how rumors spread!  They had secured a corner booth for us which would have required side-by-side eating with the SO; I prefer to look people in the eye when I eat with them so I asked for a regular table.  Thankfully my foresight was 20/20 because the cozy booth in the corner would have offered a direct view into a boisterous group of 8. Our waiter (name forgotten - sorry!) was super friendly and brought out both the regular menu and their seasonal tasting menu, complete with a ""happy birthday damian!"" on the top.  The tasting menu looked intriguing but I had been battling illness (read: hangover) and did not think I could put forth the effort I assumed would be required.  I had my eye on the tuna and wanted the brussels sprouts to start; SO went with the soup and the whitefish/lobster.   Bread service came around and of course I took a piece of each - a baguette, multigrain, and a focaccia - to cover in their delicious butter and sea salt spread.  I am a sucker for the free bread anywhere and fortunately they only came around once so I did not spoil my meal. And on to the apps.  Phenomenal. The brussels sprouts came as a healthy portion and could have been split between 3 or 4 people.  The menu did not say it contained prosciutto but I could have sworn it was in there.  So good!  SO's soup looked great but I am not a lobster fan so I did not indulge.   And as we finished those, the mains came out.  Divine. The presentation of the tuna was perfect and the taste was even better than it looked.  I actually ate the meal as slow as possible so I could savor every bite.  I did take out the mushrooms since I am not a fan and gave them to the SO, since he could eat mushrooms all day.  I tried his whitefish and really enjoyed it, but I still think the tuna was the star of our table.   Because it was my birthday, the waiter surprised me with his offering to buy me a dessert.  While I normally do not do dessert, calories and being full do not count on your birthday so I perused the menu to come up with a few choices.  Two can play at the ""surprise game"", so I told the waiter to surprise me with either the 'how bout them apples', the 'you're killing me s'mores' or the 'ice cream, you scream'.  Deep down I really wanted the s'mores and he must have seen it in my eye because a few minutes later he brought it out for us, decorated with a candle and a 'Happy Birthday'.  I blew out the candle since my wish was already granted - an amazing birthday dinner.  And omg, it was good.  For the love of God, please save room for this. I didn't pay the bill so I can't comment on the price but I can say that it is a little pricey but completely worth it.  I have gone on and on and on since last Sunday about how it was one of the best dinners I have ever had and have already made plans to brings friends there.  Cause yeah, I'll definitely be back.  Next time, the tasting menu!",0.9991,0.758,0.205,0.037,0.5002591673559416
2014-12-23,5.0,"This is the Yelp review I have always wanted to write because of how great everything was. Where to begin, here it goes...The amazing service started the moment we walked in with a coat check and greeting by hostess. We were seated at the bar while we waited for our reservation time. We were given a perfect amount of time to have one drink in the bar (not asked to move with drinks in hand, which can be awkward in a fine dining restaurant). The key part here is that I had put in a request on  opentable.com  for a couple of things. We were celebrating our recent engagement and trip to a Bulls game in the city (buck list!). I requested a quiet table for two which we were sat at and quickly acknowledged. The waiter (I need to figure out his name because he deserves a promotion or raise or something, definitely someone I WOULD LOVE to have representing my Company) was great. He offered our menus in a approachable manner and over the course of the meal offered valuable, honest and specific advice on all the dishes. It must be something they train well because everything he described was right on when it came to tastes and textures. I will shorten my review here and just say the stand out dishes were: octopus marinated in red wine and then charcoal grilled. As someone who has eaten a shitload of ""tako"" (octopus in hawaiian) in a myriad of ways, this blew my mind. Something I definitely will be taking home with me.  The next best dish for me was the duck....i have had duck 3 times and this time made me a believer. Top 3 best cuts, best prep and most tender of any meat cuts I have ever had...it rivaled the freshest tenderest venison or even fish...just a great dish. We also had a hamachi crudo, duck fat fries with truffle aoli, crab toast (wonderful and great change from our sweeter milder dungenness crab on the west coast) miso salmon (very well prepared) and a complimentary apple cider gelato or ice cream to die for!! Essentially they gave us 2 orr 3 free dshes as well because of anniversary. A 7 course meal essentially for less than $200 for 2 people with drinks--I am all about it! Seriously this was up there for me with Gary Danko in San Francisco and other fine places in the Bay Area and beyond.

2014-11-25,5.0,"Excellent. This is the best restaurant experience I've had in years. My fiancé and I visit Chicago (from Los Angeles) every year or two, and enjoyed our first visit to MK, and will make it a priority to come back during every trip to the windy city. I initially decided to try MK because it's pretty close to our hotel (The Godfrey) and it got good reviews / the website & menu were very appealing. I also noticed they offered a bistro supper Sun-Tues for $30/pp for 3 courses, and that sealed the deal. (over-indulging by eating out every meal for 4-5 days can get old, so we welcomed the chance to try several smaller portion courses for a bargain price!) The meal and service blew us away! Firstly, the space is beautiful. It's tasteful and understated. The chairs are comfortable. The hostess was friendly and professional. Our servers / busboys were perfect - a nice balance between being polite, accommodating and instinctually knowing our needs. It's formal without being stuffy. The sophisticated atmosphere and attention to detail was appreciated. The cocktails were outrageously delicious... and potent. The bartender rocks! What more can I say? (We didn't have wine, so I can't comment on that.) The food was divine. Our bistro supper started with pork rillette. Now pork rillette is not something I order often, but this was far and away the absolute BEST rillette I've ever had. My fiancé and I were fighting for the last bite. And the pickled onions and cauliflower garnishing the dish were perfectly tangy with the rich meat. The main course was duck confit with wild rice and baby carrots. The duck leg was off the charts delicious - perfectly cooked - moist and tender - crispy skin... honestly, it was orgasmic, as were the veggies it came with. Dessert was pumpkin pie with cranberries, pepitas and graham cracker crumbles. It was lovely. Even the bread they served with the meal was excellent.  ...Oh, and they brought us an order of their truffle fries. (I'm not sure if they actually came with the dinner, or they just sent them to us complimentary...) O.M.G. I've certainly had a lot of good fries in my life, but these were THE BEST EVER. I mean ridiculously yummy!  Everything about this meal, from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food gets 5 stars. We'll be back.",0.998,0.764,0.213,0.023,0.5905322636300897

2014-11-05,1.0,"Reading over all the past glowing reviews of MK it feels like I was at a different restaurant. Somehow we missed out on the great experience everyone else has had.  We scheduled a business dinner for 10 and unfortunately our experience was disappointing. Our arrival was great - the valet is fast, inexpensive and convenient and the hostess made us feel welcome.  The problem is the restaurant smells of moldy basement that morphed into urinal cake as we walked back to our table. I could see my guests wondering what kind of place I had taken them to.   Our server was efficient and out going but a few guests commented on his over the top descriptions and apparent efforts at up selling.  It felt out of place. The food went from bad to simply uninteresting. I had a pasta dish that consisted of heavy raw pasta that had congealed on my plate.  I tried to give the dish the benefit of the doubt - perhaps it was the chef's innovative concept for pasta but the second doughy mouthful was more than I could take and I sent it back. Whitefish and lobster followed and it was simply uninteresting. It was served with a nice broth that clashed with the flavors of the fish? The bread pudding for desert was probably the highlight but at this point I wasn't interested in our meal. The staff did all the right things in response to my sending back a dish and then the chef came out to apologize. I asked him if the pasta was undercooked, did I misunderstand his intent for that dish. He said it was under seasoned?  Under seasoned? - no it was a gloppy pile of raw dough!  Clearly someone needs to take charge of this kitchen. They have a great staff who deserve a better place to work -minus the smell.",0.9633,0.799,0.128,0.072,0.4840326340326341
2014-11-02,4.0,"A solid 4 star for me.  Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.  Unlike the other reviewers, I found the crab toast to be a bit fishy last night.  Not what my palette was expecting.  Shrimp appetizer was delicious and portions were nicely separated into two for us.  As for entrees, we had the Swordfish and White Fish + Lobster.  I loved the swordfish and the flavors were spot on for me.  I tasted the whitefish and that was a bit bland.  Dessert we ordered the apple and this big chocolate dish.  Apple dessert was out of this world.  I'll return just to eat that again.  The chocolate one was ok.  The trio of flavors was just off - I don't even have a description for it.  However, even though we told our waiter that the desserts were good, he quickly came back with a redemption chocolate dessert on him, stating that he wanted to end our evening on a high note.  It  was this caramel chocolate dessert and it was delicious.  Didn't beat the apple one, but delicious.  We really appreciated this effort from our waiter, and it shows that he knows and cares about his diner's experiences.  Thank you.",0.9815,0.845,0.149,0.006,0.5008823529411764
2014-10-31,4.0,"In full disclosure MK and Michael Kornick himself reached out to me after my initial review to invite me back to the restaurant. I was very impressed with how responsive and attentive they were - big props for that, and it must be why they continue to have such high ratings by responding to their customers. Below is the review for my return experience - be prepared...it's LONG! :) Overall we had a much improved experience. A lot of the issues I had (over salting, awkward service) were addressed. This is a breakdown of what we had: Starters: Kumamoto - My fav oyster so I always get it. It doesn't disappoint! Figs - Can't go wrong here, perfect balance of bacon as well Pumpkin Lobster Soup - Done the way it should've been done last time! Very tasty, perhaps last time the pot had been cooked down too much because I also remember it having a thicker texture Octopus - This is a MUST TRY ON THE MENU. perfectly cooked, the texture is amazing and a great smokey flavor. Really outstanding. Fettuccine - Flavor was great with the parmesan and wild mushrooms. The pasta was a little over-cooked for my personal taste (I like it a bit more al dente). They kindly split the plate for us since we shared which was nice! Entrees: Bison Steak - Delicious.  And the duck....while I wanted to try other things on the menu I really felt like i needed to give the duck another chance.I had ordered it and when the server asked what temp I said whatever the chef recommends. He says ""medium rare,"" i say ok. When it came it looked too heavily seared on the outside and too raw in the middle and extremely chewy as a result.  Executive Chef Erick Williams was a dear and came in to check on us so I told him the issue. He recommended the duck be cooked medium - so I think we found the problem! Medium rare was NOT how the chef recommended it! I didn't want him to cook another plate for me but he insisted on it and the new plate 1) looked gorgeous and 2) the duck looked completely different. Especially with harder to cook meats like duck and other game I always try to ask for the chef reco because cooking style and meat can vary. Looks like the main mis-step here was the server defaulted to what he thought the diner wanted vs the chef's actual reco. Well, the new dish was so good we literally finished every single bite. The duck was slightly underseasoned but the greens/carrots/squash served with it were saltier so eaten together it was a very good balance. Dessert: Cake and Shake - delicious! The cake was gorgeous and the shake was delish (along with whatever chocolate nut toffee candy was on top of the cake). Lisa Koenick also came by twice to check on us. We had a fabulous conversation about how important it is for restaurants to learn from their customers and they see to have a great system down. It would've been better if I had addressed my issues DURING my meal but I was on a business dinner with my boss and didn't want to disrupt our meal.

2014-10-31,5.0,"My best dining experience, probably ever!   Excellent first impression/hostess Excellent cocktails Excellent bartender interaction Excellent service Excellent food I've dined at other restaurants that excel at one or more of these elements, but never a restaurant that has them all nailed to perfection, and with a natural ease.   Although we were from out of town, we immediately felt at home.  We had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table, but the bartender, although very busy, chatted with us, and recommended drinks based on our taste preferences.   After we were seated we were greeted by Tino, our waiter.  What a gem!  He was warm and friendly, gladly providing suggestions based on our preferences.  I won't go into the flavors, and preparation of the food... you can check out the menu online.  However, I will say that all of the flavors of every dish were well balanced... starting with a great presentation and aroma.  Every dish we tried offered some kind of subtle surprise... a little extra something that gave it a ""wow"" factor.   *I think truffle must mean ""heaven"" in another language.  There was just enough truffle in the crab toast and truffle aioli to make us feel as though we'd had a taste of heaven.   The service couldn't have been better.  By the end of the evening it felt as though Tino was a friend of ours.  He brought us an amuse-bouche complements of the chef, and seemed to anticipate our every desire... even bringing both of us another of our favorite cocktails, but at different points during the meal.  Wow Tino, Wow.   I could go on and on, but if you're like me, the odds are you're reading this because you're looking for someplace to have a nice dinner within the next few hours.  My advice?  Go to MK.  Booking a reservation through Open Table couldn't be easier.   One more thing... if you're looking for a place to ""pop the question"" this would be IT.  Request a private corner, and let them know your plans.  Believe me, this place will make YOU look good.",0.9976,0.768,0.217,0.016,0.617452380952381

We asked to sit on the upper level mezzanine area, where you can oversee the entire restaurant. It's fun to people watch and just enjoy the view from there, so I highly recommend it. You can see all the dishes that people order, too. That was something I was happy about, because you eat with your eyes (and nose) first right?

There are large chunks of real, fresh crab meat in there! Perfect appetizer for your meal. I highly recommend it. The baby octopus is grilled over hardwood charcoal and served with nichols farm summer squash, romano beans, charred shishito peppers, garlic crème fraîche, garlic root, pimenton.

2014-09-15,4.0,"My husband and I received a gift certificate for MK for our wedding, and finally got around to dining here on our 4th wedding anniversary.  This is definitely a lovely place to go for a special occasion. We dined on a Sunday night and the restaurant was 1/3 full. We were seated in the raised area to the left, in a booth/table combo next to other diners. This was perfectly fine, but it didn't feel very intimate. The people next to us were being pretty loud and all I could hear were there conversations. Considering the restaurant was fairly empty, this was kind of a let down for a ""special occasion"". It was August and it was FREEZING where were sitting too. It was definitely a cooler evening, but the AC was up way too high. We ordered a round of cocktails and the fried stuffed olives appetizer. After this I mentioned to our server (who was fantastic) that it was really cold and I thought maybe I was sitting right under the AC. They promptly moved us to a more romantic table overlooking the rest of the dining room which was also much warmer! The service from start to finish was fantastic.  Since it was our anniversary, we did the tasting menu, which was Sonoma themed. I wasn't sure about some of the items but decided to just go for it!  Our courses included -  Fried olives appetizer (ordered off the menu, not part of the tasting menu) *these were amazing, and we don't even like olives! kona kampachi  crudo of kampachi, pickled garlic scapes, petite sorrel, radish *this was delicious! torchon  cured hudson valley foie gras, swiss chard, hillside orchard peaches, lamb's lettuce, pumpernickel toast *I'm very glad we tried this, but we decided we are both not huge fans of foie gras swordfish  grilled swordfish, chaterelle mushrooms, smoked eggplant, confit shallot *swordfish is one of my favorite fish. this was ok, it was VERY smoky tasting beef  prime dry aged strip loin, wilted spigarello greens, marble potatoes, brown mustard, rosemary reduction *I was most excited for this dish, as admittedly I'm a huge steak fan. I thought it was very blah and definitely not one of the better steaks I've had. A few more potatoes would have been nice as well.  picolo  triple creme cow's milk, andante dairy, Petaluma klug farms mixed berry compote. *Loved this, but you can't go wrong with any cheese :)  apricots honey rye cake, apricots, fennel, goat cheese, apricot sorbet *we are both not huge rans of rye, but we were surprised how well the rye went with the apricots. it was delicious. The best part is we did the wine pairings. Each wine was amazing and paired perfectly with the course. I tend to stick with ordering very big dry wines and am glad I tried some other types of wines out. Overall we would go back and maybe just order off the menu. I would do the tasting menu with wine pairings again in a heartbeat, but there are other restaurants on the ""bucket list"" I would prefer to try first for this price point.  I only gave it 4 stars because honestly, I was not BLOWN AWAY for the price.  I would still recommend it and would go back.

2014-09-14,5.0,"when my wife and I wanted to have one last dinner before leaving Chicago after 14 years, we picked mk.  while I wouldn't call us foodies, we do enjoy a nice dinner now and then. every year we pick a really nice restaurant and treat ourselves (trotters, grace, tru, everest, schwa, etc).  and while we have loved every one of those experiences, for some reason we're never happier than when we walk out of mk.  the food is fantastic, they have their staples that have been on the menu since the beginning but are always trying new dishes. (their newest appetizer the crab toast was out of this world) but for me though, what sets mk apart are the little touches. for example, one time there were five of us dining and we ordered an appetizer that only came with four. well when the appetizer arrived, there were five on the plate. we didn't ask them to do that, they didn't tell us they were going to do that, they just made it happen.  or one time when I ordered the tasting menu and my wife didn't. they brought her a little something with each course anyway so that she didn't feel left out.  one night we liked the rosemary ice cream so much that when the server came to clean our plates we joked that we were still waiting on our ice cream.  after we paid our bill, they brought us each one more little scoop.  or when sitting at the bar for a nightcap and I finish my glass of wine before my wife, the bartender gives you another dash of wine so you're not sitting there empty handed.  you could argue that a lot of places have nice touches like that, but there's a consistent experience at mk, one that always feels like in some little way they just want to go a little above and beyond what you expect.  I don't know why, but every single person working there genuinely seems to be enjoying what they do. the servers are extremely knowledgeable about the food and the wine. and the food is delicious.  cheers to Michael and Lisa - you've really got something special going there.",0.9936,0.841,0.146,0.013,0.5640319450664277

The tuna tartare duo had one excellent one and one 'ok' one. I loved the grilled octopus, simple but flavorful. The arctic char was cooked perfectly but way too salty.

I'm a huge sweets fan (reminded me of the one I had at boka). Now that I've had a little bit of everything im for sure coming back here to order a la carte! Our server was excellent as well. Everyone was great. Forgot our servers name though... :/ . this place kinda makes you feel like you're on a cruise ship haha kinda cool **my friends didn't like the lamb on the menu so they were nice enough to sub it for bison !! :),0.9948,0.655,0.332,0.014,0.6894444444444445

We share the fries with truffle mayo because they were highly recommended by our server. Nothing special, I could have done without them.  I had the gnochetti as a starter. The portion was tiny but so fluffy and soft.  For an entree I ordered the chicken, and it was a little too salty for my taste.  For desert I had the Bear-y Down, Chicago.  The silky lavander honey ice and moist rice pudding cake was absolutely havenly.  MK has delicious and beautifully plated food, top notch service, and beautiful ambiance.  Although it is pricey, it makes for a great choice for special occassions.",0.9882,0.758,0.229,0.013,0.6234303350970017

Fresh oysters, awesome appetizers, and hard to find wine really brought home the bacon.  However I ordered the daily special which was filet of beef topped with foie gras, and while my steak was perfectly cooked it  and the foie gras was WAY under seasoned. When I say that, I mean it lacked any salt whatsoever. That is huge no-no for me when it comes to dining out. I don't need food covered in a fancy foam or accompanied with a smoke filled balloon; but meats must be seasoned. Not only that but that was the ""special"" it should have been the best thing at the table, sadly it wasn't.  Overall I liked the dinner I had there, it's definitely worth a try, but it's not one of those places you want  to drop a couple hundred dollars more than once.",0.9224,0.788,0.151,0.062,0.5618596681096683

The plain brick front with simple MK loco on the front could be missed if you are not paying attention. Even though we were 10 minutes early, the hostess was able to seat us right away. All of the items on the menu looked like they were worth a try, but both of us went with the 6 course tasting menu, with pairings. All of the early courses are seperated with your choice of three different breads. Don't panic, you will be able to try all three.  The wait staff did an excellent job of spacing the courses so you were never overwhelmed. The wines paired perfectly with each course, and the staff was very knowledgeable in both the wine and food. I never felt like they were parroting back what they had been told to say, they truly understood why everything was served the way it was. My only complaint with the food is that we couldn't decide which course we liked best. The restaurant filled up while we were there, but it never seemed loud or crowded. We had no problem holding a conversation, nor did we feel like we were in the middle of the conversation of the table next to us.

One of those places you eat slowly, not only to savor the taste, but count those dollars you are happily spending. Worth every expensive penny.  A sommelier helps you choose your bottle, cracking jokes and telling a tidbit of info about the choice. The server had their favorites, selling us the best entree, beer, and desert.

2014-07-12,5.0,"This restaurant really blew me away. I knew I had to write a review as soon as I got home! Where to start.. We drove up to the restaurant and valet. The neighborhood is a bit more west from Gold Coast but is not too far out of the way. The exterior does not do the interior justice (better this way, then it will remain our secret!) We were immediately greeted by the host and sat at our table (make a reservation before you come. You can also request a specific waiter/waitress prior to coming for the evening). After we were seated, our amazing waitress came over and told us about the specials and how the menus work. I recommend the a la carte menu because you can truly pick and choose what you want to get! We were a group of three. The final bill was around $450 (before tip), so I would say that you should come with a heavy pocketbook in hand! NOTE: Whenever we go out to eat, we tend to order a ton of appetizers, desserts, sides.. just to taste everything. If you were to go and order only a few things, you could keep the bill under 200 for two people.  Before we ordered, we were brought a sampling plate of the chef's special: a small salmon tartar with fennel and beats and a violet mustard (?) sauce.  STARTERS: We ordered the crab toast, gnochetti, asparagus salad, endive salad, and poached artichoke. Each and every one had a unique flavor profile and was delicious. The portions were generous but not over the top- perfect to share. I would highly recommend the crab toast and the gnochetti-- they were the winners at our table! A lot of the ingredients are not what you would order at a normal american restaurant (ie: foie gras, hen of the woods mushrooms, guanciale, but wow are they to die for!)  MAIN COURSE: Duck, Fish & Lobster, Asparagus, Pomme Frites with truffle cream. The lobster fish we could've done without. The duck was outstanding as was the pomme frites! I would have also liked to try the tuna.. the table next to us ordered it and it looked outstanding.  DESSERT: We ordered the cake & shake, rhubarby baby, and another three-part chocolate dish with chocolate ganache, pretzel, caramel, flourless chocolate cake, mascapone foam. All of the desserts were delicious! I would recommend the rhubarby baby because of the delicious in-house prepared rhubarb sorbet. I mentioned that it was my birthday recently and they brought out a candle with a happy birthday written on the plate with chocolate. Our waitress also gave us a $25 gift card to come in and dine with them again. She was knowledgeable about the menu, the wines, and was overall a fantastic person! Her last name is Gold but I cannot remember her first name. When you call to make your reservation, request her for a special night!  Overall, our wait staff was incredible, the food was outstanding, and the interior is luxurious! It would be a bit stuffy but thankfully they played popular songs (cue Nora Jones, Frank Ocean, very soft music with a bit of a younger feel). I will definitely be going back again!

I stumbled upon this restaurant while trying to plan a lovely dinner for the two of us while we were out in Chicago on vacation. To start, the service while waiting was impeccable. We were given notice that our table was just about ready for us, and we are welcome to sit in the (very comfy) lounge area and have a drink. Those, by the way, were fantastic.  Once our table was ready, the hostess offered to carry my wife's drink up to the table for her. Once at the table, the hostess pulled out my wife's chair, and allowed her to be given the menu first. Throughout the night, she was treated first, as it should be.  Promptly after we were seated, our server was with us and taking down our order.  Before the food arrived, we were given a small (but incredibly flavorful) bit of salmon tartar. It was plated very well, and was absolutely amazing.  The food came extremely quickly, and was cooked to perfection. I got the filet mignon special, which was resting on a small potato cake, with a red wine reduction sauce. It was topped with a seared foie gras and black truffle on top. To die for, to say the least.  My wife got an amazing chicken dish, which was accompanied by a minted pea and mustard violet sauce.  To finish up, we had the ""Ice Cream, You Scream."" This was three types of fresh made ice cream and sorbet, which included chocolate, vanilla, and a cinnamon/graham cracker flavored one. Along with these came a chocolate chip cookie, a snicker doodle, and cinnamon oatmeal raisin, and a sugar cookie. All of which were made in house. Absolutely delicious.  Last up was probably the best cappuccino I think I have ever had.  With the staff being beyond friendly, the prices being very competitive, the food being simply outstanding, and the atmosphere of the restaurant being very quaint, this was a clear 5-star restaurant.

For dessert, we shared the pineapple express and a selection of sorbets.  The pineapple express was decent and about what we expected.  I chose the sorbets over the ice creams because I felt that for $10, I should receive more intriguing scoops than merely vanilla and chocolate.  The sorbets were okay, but not worth the cost.

One of the best and most unique salads I've had in a long time. The 2nd course was also good; the ham was falling apart tender and that picked ramp relish was heavenly! I was surprised by how much I fell in love with the black kale and garlic. I inhaled it and wanted to keep eating it...and I do not like kale!!! The dessert was a bit disappointing, which is hard to write because the pastry chef even came out to our table and greeted us, then explained the dish to us. The waffles were a bit plain and not crunchy enough and the addition of granola to them didn't do much. The rhubarb compote was good and tart, just as I like it, and the ice cream was just fine.

We really appreciated the gesture, as they offered us the dinner, but I am sorry to say I still think the Sunday night supper at mk is NOT a good idea. The food was very disappointing and so was the wine. I saw our server opening the bottle and smelling it before pouring us a glass --- that felt uninspiring at the very least. I have been told by the manager that the Sunday night supper aims to provide a casual, cozy environment for a family-style dinner so this time I went in with these expectations. My impression, upon 2 visits, is however very different. We were seated in the lounge area on a high, slightly too small bar table. Not what you have at home or at your grandma's, right?  The noise level is moderate so we couldn't enjoy conversation so much and when the food came, we discovered it was prepared without much care nor flavor. Not family-style, just cheap.  Here is the menu: asparagus with watercress and French feta cheese crumbles, veal schnitzel with spaetzle and green peas and a rhubarb crisp. That's not what I call a family-style dinner --- unless your mom is German I guess and you grew up eating spaetzle. Or French feta. It felt like a weird mixture of wannabe haute cuisine with 2nd-quality ingredients. Anyway: the asparagus was soggy and looked old (the tips were not firm), the meat was a bit too oily and not crispy, the spaetzle were mushy (I really did not like them) and the dessert was not crunchy at all. It also came out lukewarm, like it had been sitting on a counter for some 15 minutes. Honestly, I was so disappointed.  To sum up, at mk they have nice people who care about customers, no doubt. Judging from other reviews, they can also cook very well when you pay a substantial amount of money (I peeked into their menu and all their entrées are between 38$ and 50$.).  However, if you are looking to dine in a comfortable familiar setting for 30$ (food) + 16$ (wine), well, my advice is ""look somewhere else"".",0.9027,0.812,0.109,0.079,0.48855042016806716

2014-04-27,1.0,The only nice thing about this place was the interior.  Even that wasn't that great.   Interior= 3 Feels like you're dining in a large corporate office. 3 levels of dining which was neat.  Felt very clean so that's good.  Food= -1 Ick.  We had some bison appetizer which turned out to be a raw appetizer.  I did not know that when we ordered it.  I think my date thought it tasted OK.  We ordered Salmon as well as Chicken which we both thought were very salty.  Food was over priced for bite sized meals.  Customer Service / Ambiance = -1 Our server was pretty snobby for some reason.  She noticed I did not like the raw appetizer and her expression immediately read you don't fit in here.  The ambiance had such a...snobby feel and she helped to enhance that.  It was not a very welcoming place.,0.9257,0.774,0.159,0.067,0.5976030219780221
2014-04-21,5.0,"Where to begin..... Mouth-gasm.... Best word to describe this swanky little place. The atmosphere was great! The server, Steve was knowledgable, our pastry chef was right on the money with desserts and the food ... To die for.  Started off with some cocktails that were perfectly strong... Not overly sweet - just right.  Next to appetizers.. Oysters, octopus, fettuccine and carrot soup. Probably the best spiced soup I've had in awhile ... It hit the spot and engaged every taste bud for what was to come. Entrées- chicken... which was so rich and flavorful I couldn't stop eating it.   And the Lobster/fluke was gobbled down by my husband. Order the frites and you won't be disappointed.  Dessert- unbelievable, decadent and so rich! Best s'mores hands down in the city and Pineapple Express was so tropical and exotic.   At first, we were skeptical, especially with the smaller portions but the start you off light and each meal seems to get bigger and bigger. Toward the end I thought I would have to be rolled out of the place after receiving cute, tiny, tasty cookies with our check. Was it expensive? of course ! Not something you eat out every night but well worth the money. I guess you appreciate places like this when you don't general eat food like this on a daily basis and you learn to love the effort put into what's coming out on that next plate.

2014-04-21,5.0,"I came here last Friday with 5 other family members to celebrate my Aunt's birthday! We all live in different parts of the US (CA, AZ, TX) so we were visiting (all but one of us), and we were blown away by the outstanding food, and the amazing service! Our server was SCOTT and he definitely made our experience that night AMAZING! He was extremely attentive, and took his time while going over the entire menu with us. My cousin is a vegan, and he took the time also to sit and talk with her about all of her different options, and things that they could put together for her which was very much appreciated. If you are a vegan, you know that your menu is usually much smaller! My family is very big on wine, and when my cousin stated that she could not tell the difference with a certain wine, the server then brought her a glass of different wines to try for free!...just so that she would have a better understanding! That scored some big points with my family since we are all wine drinkers! They also had a special ""tasting menu"" printed out for each of us with a little shout out at the top for my Aunt Debbie, whose birthday we were celebrating! It was a nice little touch! Everything that we ate there was sensational! Some of the items that I specifically remember trying were: GNOCCHETTI, SEARED TUNA, CAVIAR. I know there was more that I tried from the tasting menu that I loved, but I can't remember right now unfortunately. Really though, it was an overall wonderful experience! The ambiance and music were great also, and we had a very positively memorable experience there! I live in Orange County, and have already been telling everyone about it! I definitely hope to dine there again when I come back to Chicago to visit my sister! Thank you, mk!",0.998,0.771,0.221,0.008,0.5390544217687075
2014-04-21,5.0,My husband and I came in here for a date that we earned on  howaboutwe.com . We came in and were greeted by two hostesses that were very friendly. One directed us towards the lounge and let us choose where we wanted to sit. For an Easter Sunday evening at 7:00 p.m. the dining room and lounge area were almost half full. It was a  light chattery environment as we sat down in the corner.  We were greeted by our host who presented us with two 'how about we' menus that featured our 3 course shareable meals and he explained all 3 with detail. We chose the chardonnay instead of Malbec for our half bottle of wine. We were also given the 'bar bites menu' all ranging around 6 dollars all all looked delicious but we passed.  All our food was great but the cheesecake was our favorite and the service was impeccable. Definitely provided that fine dining experience. Every one was personal and knowledgable about the food at the restaurant. Our waiter also explained who the pastry chef and main courses chef was and I could tell he really enjoys working there.

2014-04-17,5.0,"I remember shortly after moving back to Chicago, having two nice dinners with my family - the second was at the now-closed Crofton on Wells, the first was at MK Chicago, Michael Kornick's original outpost before he began his DMK empire.   I distinctly remember sitting upstairs, being impressed by the room and food.  Of course, I didn't have a blog then, so I can't remember for the life of me what I ate. Fast forward nearly 11 years - I had been to a dinner event there, but really hadn't dined there again until this week - my fiancee had bought a Gilt City voucher for a custom-built four course meal.  The gist of the voucher is that you answer a questionnaire about your likes, dislikes, etc and they build a menu for you - being easy, we essentially told them to do what they wanted and walked in to see what the kitchen drummed up for us. The menu starts with an amuse bouche - a slice of peppery salami, served with cornichons and white asparagus atop a fava bean puree.  A bunch of subtle flavors dominated by the pop of the salami, this was a good way to start the meal. The first course was pretty impressive.   A duet of tartares - on the left, a salmon tartare served with salmon roe and topped with a creme fraiche that had a hint of citrus to balance the saltiness of the roe.  The tartare itself was perfectly chopped and textured and beautifully presented.  On the right, a tuna tartare topped with a ""crust' of finely chopped celery remoulade with a side of finely chopped Moroccan olives.  The salt from the olives was a bit overpowering, but the tuna mixed with the celery was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. Next up are some perfectly seared diver scallops.  The bed is a nest of shaved spaghetti squash mixed with earthy, flavorful hen of the woods mushrooms and finely chopped pistachios.  The scallops were lightly salted, nicely seared and cooked to a good tenderness.  I'm a big fan of spaghetti squash and it worked well with the pistachio flavored vinaigrette. From sea to land we go, a small portion of sliced bison ribeye - cooked on the perfect rarer side of medium rare.  The bison itself didn't have a huge gamey flavor, and lacked a deep beefy flavor in general.  The salsify gratin was interesting, but didn't do much for me.  There was also a smorgasbord of sauces, a fairly mild broccoli rabe pesto and a robust sherry sauce.  I think one or the other would work well here, but both together seemed like overkill.  A good dish, but maybe a bit too much going on. A meal at MK is not complete without trying Michael Kornick's pommes frites - just a bit thicker than ideal for me but perfectly cooked, crisp on the outside, soft but well cooked in the middle.  And the truffle cream served with may be one of the best dipping sauces for fries ever - a medium thick consistency dashed with a perfect amount of truffle to give it that distinct truffle flavor without being overpowering. So we move on to dessert - and we get two!  The first, affectionately named the pineapple express (no, it's not Denver...), was a nicely flavored brown butter tart with hints of pineapple topped with fresh sliced pineapple dotted with dashes of chiles and jalapenos to give it just a bit of a subtle kick.  The lime-coconut sorbet was awesomingly refreshing and balanced out the dish nicely. The second dessert, called ""you're killing me s'mores"" had almost all my favorite dessert elements - a perfectly scattered mixture of textures, flavors, and temperatures.  In the middle, a rich piece of dark chocolate ganache, surrounding by decadent torched marshmallows, served just at room temperature and contrasted by the rich graham cracker ice cream.  The chopped peanuts that are sprinkled throughout the dish are subtle, and maybe a bit unnecessary but don't detract from the dish either. I was feeling a bit under the weather, so I went light on the wine pairings - so using the voucher wasn't a phenomenal deal, but we definitely feel like we got our money's worth.  I walked out pleasantly full and stuffed, but with enough energy to walk home afterwards.  MK executes well - they may suffer from overindulging in the number of ingredients on certain dishes, but for the most part, dishes are well executed and artfully presented.  The fries in themselves are almost worth a return trip, and are up there with the best fries I've had in the city.  .   Service was friendly, helpful, and just laid back enough to make it comfortable - a tough balance to find at a fine dining restaurant.  One of the sous chefs came out to talk to us during the meal - also a nice touch.   At the very least, I don't think it will be another 11 years before my next trip.

2014-04-16,4.0,"I went to mk with my husband and a couple of friends for a Gilt City deal--a customized 4-course dinner with wine pairings.  It was a pretty fun setup--they had us fill out a short survey with food preferences ahead of time, then when we arrived each person had a personal menu printed out for them.  I am pescatarian so I had a different menu from the other 3.  The others had the same selections for everything except dessert--one friend had a different dish than the other 2.   To start, the service was very good.  The hosts, server, and sommelier were all friendly and helpful.  The sous chef came out to check on us a couple of times, which was fun.  That was actually part of the Gilt City deal.   3 at the table ordered cocktails to start.  I got to taste them and they were nicely balanced, springy, and featured vibrant flavors--1 of them was an usual gin-based drink that contained carrot juice, and was garnished with the tiniest little baby carrot I've ever seen.  The root was only about 1 cm long.  Adorable.  The amuse bouche was a mix of wonderful, lightly pickled vegetables--a refreshing way to begin the meal.  Next, we all had a duo of tartares--tuna and salmon.  This dish was a fun mix of flavors, textures and colors.  I only wish there had been more of it!  Next I had baby octopus with fennel agrodolce.  It was quite a lot of octopus, and I thought the acidity of the agrodolce was refreshing with the grilled octopus.  They included an octopus head--kind of unusual.  I always wonder what restaurants do with all the heads, since you so rarely see them on the plate.     My main dish was a poached lobster and fluke dish with fava beans, black kale, and a spring onion nage.  The lobster was cooked absolutely perfectly!  Again, I just wish there had been more.  The fluke was kind of overshadowed by the rest of the elements in the dish, particularly the lobster.  Maybe it would have stood out more if there had been a distinguishing texture or flavor--a crust of some kind, maybe?  The contrast between something crunchy and the nage would've been good. Dessert was dreamsicle-themed.  I love the pairing of vanilla and citrus, so I was pretty excited.  It was a playful combination of flavors and textures, with cake, granola, meringue, sorbet, and fresh grapefruit.  In keeping with the rest of the meal, it was light and sunny and, despite the wintry citrus, felt like a celebration of the beginning of spring. I thought my menu was very well put-together.  The dishes were all selections from the regular menu, but I enjoyed letting go of control a little and allowing the chef to orchestrate the meal.  It was a joyful, light progression and I enjoyed it a lot.   The guys had a fettuccine with lamb ragout and merguez that they all agreed was their best dish.  The main was a seared duck breast, which they all said was good, but slightly disappointing.  I think it was prepared well, but duck breast just isn't a favorite meat of any of them.  Knowing their tastes, I think they would've enjoyed some kind of slow-cooked meat more.  They also said that the lentils that came with the dish were very salty.   We ordered an order of their famous frites with truffle aioli to share (though we asked the server and they are fried in some kind of animal fat, so beware).  Apparently those were really good.  The aioli was nice and truffly, as it should be.  We also got the mix of spring vegetables to share.  It included green asparagus, pickled white asparagus, sugar snap peas, and fiddlehead ferns.  All the veggies were lightly cooked and very fresh.  I think they guys enjoyed having the veggies to balance out their meat-heavy meals. The wine pairings were all done very well.  The wines were not expensive by any means, but they served to complement the food nicely.  One small quibble was that the sommelier didn't quite explain the difference between ruby and tawny ports correctly.  He poured a ruby port with the guys' desserts and that started a short port discussion.  My husband loves port and knows a good amount about how it's made, so it's too bad that the sommelier wasn't more knowledgable than he was.  But again, that's a small quibble.  The main thing is that the pairings were really good. I thought that the deal we got was terrific, and such a fun way to try out a new (to us, anyway) place.  I didn't realize that they've been around for almost 16 years.  I looked at the dishes we had on the a la carte menu, and even though they were really good, I think the a la carte pricing is a bit on the high side.  For example, my lobster/fluke dish was $38!  Yikes!  I'm not sure if they sized down the portions for this special deal.  I kind of hope they did, in a way....if I were paying $38 for that plate, I would have been pretty disappointed in the amount of lobster.  I don't expect a mountain of it, but it was a pretty small portion. All in all, I am really surprised they don't have a Michelin star.  They do deserve one!",0.9991,0.811,0.17,0.02,0.5895035577848077

2014-03-27,3.0,"No matter what I think about the food, all I can really focus on here is the price.  And, if you are spending your own money here (i.e., no deals, GCs, vouchers, business accounts, etc.), you are telling the world you are balls-out rich. My wife and I stopped by this week for dinner.  Bottom line, $35 for gnocchi is hilarious, and there was no way I was going to eat $35 gnocchi that delivered on the price promise.  It was just okay, certainly not at the quality of places like La Scarola or Piccolo Sogno and then it was double the price of those other fine Italian establishments.  The meat (boar) was seasoned and cooked well and fell apart in my mouth...but again, $35 for a plate of gnocchi (and this is a half-order, size wise) is unbelievable. My wife got the skatewing, and that was a little better, but also something like $32.  For whitefish, that is a lot of cash, and it wasn't like this was a crazy-large platter.  Very tasty, light, the white beans served with it were tasty...but not $32 tasty. The MK anniversary cocktail was great...but $14.  And it wasn't at the level that Violet Hour, CH Distillery, Trenchermen or other places has given me.  My wife's glass of white wine was $14, easily the most expensive single glass of wine I've had in Chicago in a while.  The s'mores dessert was great. The best thing at MK was the rosemary focaccia bread, the fast service and the cool-looking space.  But for these prices, there are many other great options in the city.",0.9885,0.824,0.154,0.022,0.4981349206349206

To start, my fiancé and I shared the Crab Toast from the Small Tastes menu and an Endive salad. Both were beautifully plated and offered familiar flavors with a fresh twist. Our bread plates were regularly filled with our choice of French baguette, sourdough, or focaccia. We sipped wine--Zinfandel for me and ABC Chardonnay for my fiancé. (The Chardonnay was our mutual favorite and it paired well with both of our meals. ""Buttery"" doesn't begin to explain the flavor and smoothness of this Santa Barbara wine.) Before our entrees arrived, we were served a complimentary fluke ceviche amuse-bouche, garnished with a sliver of kumquat. Our server Nicole was delightful and informative. She greeted us with contextual information about the restaurant and the chef, Michael Kornick, who sits on the Bison Council. As admittedly odd as this factoid sounded, it remained in my mind when it came time to order our entrees. I opted for the Gnocchi, which turned out to be a generously portioned marriage of tender pieces of (you guessed it!) bison with the most incredibly doughy dumplings. Melt. In. Your. Mouth!!!! The texture was HEAVEN.  The Gnocchi is a dish I hope MK never, ever, ever, ever removes from their menu.  By the end of it, I couldn't possibly entertain the thought of dessert.

We ordered a la carte: sweetbread and two tartares as appetizers; for entrees, I had the gnocchi with short rib, he had the salmon, and a side of truffle fries to share; for dessert, we shared the cake n' shake.

When the table next to us was ordering drinks, I watched, and our waitress didn't card them, so it didn't seem like it was a restaurant policy.   -MOST IMPORTANTLY, while the dishes we ordered looked amazing, the food was not to what we expected: the savory dishes ended up being very salty, and the sweet dishes and sauces were almost too cloying. We both ended up drinking 3-4 glasses of water each throughout the course of the meal because of the heavy seasoning.

The service, from the way we were greeted at the door to our waiter and the help-staff, was excellent.  We wanted to try a lot of different dishes (I am a chronic over-order-er) so went the small plates route instead of large entrees. The Crab Toast was truly a treat and it comes in 4 pieces so perfect for 2 people to share.  The Grilled Baby Octopus was delicious as were the Two Tartares and the Butternut Squash Ravioli (lightly seasoned with Cinnamon).  We capped that off by splitting the Market Salad (also very good).  Next time, we'll attack an entree or two but for this night, the amount of food was just right and so was the restaurant.

We were called early to our table and we're immediately met by our server, Mayan, who presented us with our very own ""Happy 20th Anniversary!"" menu. We both ordered the tasting menu with pairings ($135, or $90 without pairings). Neither of us cared for the chicken consomme which was extremely bland. My husband, who never uses salt, reached for the salt a couple of times to enhance his soup. Aside from that first course, each course that followed was delicious, perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. We passed on the chocolate course and split a cake and shake because we had heard so much about it.  Mayan was very knowledgeable about the wines that were served and was a fabulous server overall.

MK is the ultimate experience.  We came here last night for my birthday. We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  It was decided that we were going to just go big and each order the tasting menu with wine pairings. Sometimes you just have to celebrate. Here is what that entailed: 1. Oysters. OH MY GOD. We got three kumamotos (some of my fave oysters), and each were paired with a different ""garnish"", if you will. My favorite was the bacon mignonette, the fiance's was the citris creme fraiche and salmon roe. All three were delightful.  2. Chanterelles with asparagus and truffle. Um...what else do you want? It was heaven.  3. Lobster. YES. Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. There was a very generous helping of lobster in my bowl and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. There was a corn sauce that came with it. My fiance doesn't do well with shellfish, so he was given Monkfish instead. It was prepared exactly the same way and was delicious. As close to lobster as you can get. 4. Pork. We also opted to add the truffle frites with that (it's my birthday, go big or go home!). The pork was simply incredible. It came with spinach and was just...wonderful. The frites paired quite nicely with this dish. 5. Cheese. It was this insanely flavorful and delicious blue cheese with pickled peaches and a cranberry toasted bread. Insane.  6. Finally, we had a cherry tart for dessert with creme fraiche sorbet. Lovely. The wine pairings were PERFECTION. Our server explained each wine as it came out, the region, flavors to notice, etc. It was literally like he was putting on a show for us (in a good way). He was polished, attentive, and knew the menu backwards and forward. To say that it was good service would be a gross understatement.  I will be back.

I was running 5 minutes late but when I got there I found my parents had made friends with the bartender and ordered drinks. The hostess let us take our time and then seated us when we were ready. Once at the table we were served an amuse-bouche of salmon roe and crème fraîche. It was a delicious bite and luckily I got two since my mother doesn't like crème fraîche. We ordered the crab toast for the table as well. It was crab meat, sweet corn, truffle cream, and chive blossoms. It was essentially heaven in two bites. For my entree I got the yellowfin tuna. It was cooked perfectly and the shitake mushrooms were some of the best I've ever had. My mother's chicken was also incredibly good, wonderfully moist and loaded with flavor. I was told that the pomme frites should not be avoided so we had those too. I want their truffle cream bottled up so I can put it on everything. It was AMAZING! Finally no meal at mk can not include dessert. Mindy Segal started a proud pastry tradition here and Lisa Bonjour has continued it proudly. We shared the s'more dessert as well as the cake and shake.

The restaurant itself seems to be in a quiet block away from the hustle and the bustle of the city.  When you step inside, it's quite chic and modern, great space, and all the hostesses and the servers were quite oh-so-friendly (extremely friendly in to the point you question if they're that dazed!). However, I enjoyed my meal. Through the chef's compliment, we were served with some crispy baguette chips with a cod paste - a nice balance of cod with seasoning - reminded you of tuna, but a cod version. A good mound in which there was some left over for the warm bread they serve you. The pat of butter came with some sea salt splattered on time, so a great salty bite with your bread. I started off with their Octopus, in which is supposedly their 'signature' dish. It was a baby octopus grilled over hardwood charcoal, with a side of braised escarole, garlic confit, saffron and meyerlemon puree. The octopus itself was cooked perfectly, and the escarole on the side reminded me of the non-spicy type of kimchee - awesome complement, and not citrus-like as most of the other octopi I've tried. I enjoyed it quite much. I also ordered the Gnocchi, which were ricotta gnocchi, chanterelle, and trumpet royale mushrooms. The gnocchi dumplings were pillow-y soft, the sauce was not overwhelmingly creamy, and there was a great ratio of the dumplings versus the mushrooms. No need to add salt or anything to this dish - perfectly seasoned. My friend had the Salad, which was Belgian endive, french green beans, apple, watercress, Roquefort cheese, and toasted pecans - fresh and light. For dessert, I had the 'Two Bananas Walk Into a Bar,' which was banana souffle cake, toasted marshmallow fluff (house-made), macadamia nut crumble, dark chocolate sauce, and a scoop of malted banana ice cream. The marshmallow fluff wasn't much of a fluff but a smear across the plate. The banana souffle cake was moist, and tasted like a wet banana cake. The macadamia nut crumble was too overly sweet, more like a graham cracker crumb gone wrong; the malted banana ice cream was refreshing, but definitely needed more to complement the cake. The drops of the dark chocolate sauce were scraped to get the flavors going. You have a choice of ordering the items on the menu appetizer-sized or entree-sized, depending on how much you want to pay out. Service was quite efficient, respectful, and nice; bathrooms are clean and they smell nice, too. +Octopus +Gnocchi +'Two Bananas Walk Into a Bar' +friendly staff",0.9978,0.765,0.197,0.038,0.5513257575757575
2013-07-16,4.0,"MK has a special place in my heart bc it was the very first restaurant my husband brought me to when we first moved to Chicago about 7 years ago for my bday. I remember the restaurant being packed, with a vibrant bar scene. It was sad to see how quiet the place was this time around :/ We had forgotten about MK until a friend of ours gave us a gift card.  So glad he did because I was reminded what a solid place this is.  Really enjoyed our dinner.  I started w the rabbit which was pretty good and I think we both got the wagyu for our entrees which we loved.  Experienced pretty good service, not great but still good. And even witnessed a cute lil marriage proposal at our neighboring table.  I think MK is a perfect place to bring someone on a first date :)",0.9848,0.703,0.252,0.045,0.6994588744588746
2013-07-15,4.0,"BF and I went here for dinner, didn't have hard time to get a reservation but when we actually got there it was full. atmosphere & decor: 5/5 Modern decor and definitely dressed-up like atmosphere but wasn't as stiff or something. It was perfect for a date night and I'm pretty sure it will be a good trip with a group of friends too. Service: 4.5/5 Our waiter seemed like he knows the stuffs on the menu, was RELATIVELY attentive even though the restaurant seemed pretty busy. Not the best service I've experienced, but was fairly good. Food: 4/5 For an appetizer, we shared the grilled octopus. It was delicious, I would give it a 4 out of 5. For entrees, BF had the medium-rare lamb chops and I had the seared tuna as our waiter recommended while I was debating between seared tuna and the white fish. My tuna was one of the BEST seafood dishes I've ever had. It was just perfect. If you like to order seafood as a main dish, and if you love seared tuna, go for this one if you're not sure whether to get the tuna or the whitefish which is one of the most famous entrees at MK. I didn't regret a bit. HOWEVER, the lamb was somewhat disappointing. It wasn't horrible or anything like that, but for the price and the reputation that MK has, it wasn't the best lamb dish. After experiencing the lamb from Mexteco, it might have been a dangerous choice though. Along with the entrees, we felt obligated to order THE pommes frites with truffle cream. Although it was very tasty, I don't think I would pay $$$ for frites... It's just my opinion;) BF loved it actually and he said he would come back just for this and the atmosphere.

2013-07-06,5.0,"MK was one of those places whose websites I visit when I'm laying in bed at midnight unable to sleep and need something to fancy about. There's something about the way they present themselves that really did it for me. Not to mention I see their big old sign every morning on my way to work via Brownline - they were clearly playing with my emotion! When he brought it up that we should try MK, the child in me did a little dance - out of all the restaurants on our must-try list, MK was among the top.  Our reservation was on a Sunday night, there was a decent crowd still! Our table wasn't great, which was such a shame because I really liked the interior. Our server came over and introduced herself immediately, and turned out we had 2 servers for the night, and a busser. I'm not sure if this is how they operate usually, but I didn't mind. Again, we debated between the tasting menu and a la carte, and per usual, we went with ordering a la carte, since we usually get to try more that way.  To start, we had - Tartare: it was alright. I didn't like the celery flavor on one of them, and frankly, I don't like tartare but I never had the heart to break it to him since he loves them. He seemed to really enjoy it, so I'd say it was good.  - Salad: Wonderful - the blue cheese and pecan worked magic. Great way to start! - Octopus: I was excited to try this. It was good, but I thought it was a little burned - which I understand they use charcoal, so it might be part of the reason why. I personally like it, but he didn't.  - Sweetbread - this wasn't on the a la carte menu but we asked for it anyway. I wanted to try it. Tender and lovely.  - Morel: he loves morel, and our server did a good job selling it to him. This was delicious. Perhaps the best out of all the starters. The pasta was sooo good and the seasoning was light yet powerful. Order this dish!  Ok, a little too much, I agreed, but I wanted to taste so many things, and I hardly had anything to eat that day so I had an excuse. They did an excellent job with the pace of our meal - the food kept coming out in perfect timing and they divided most of our dish into 2 for us. After each course our plates were refreshed. Great service.  But we didn't stop after the starters. For our main course we had: - Salmon: I considered this dish ""Asian-inspired."" The salmon was served with bok choy and soy sauce vinaigrette. Salmon was on point, and I liked it. I didn't love it, and he actually was just alright with it - he didn't think it was anything special! - Bison: he ordered this per our server's suggestion, and loved it. The meat was too red for me. I hardly had any of this dish. I usually don't eat meat, so he finished it for me! - Truffle fries: we actually didn't order this, but our server just told us she'd bring out a half order of truffle fries if that's ok with us. I mean after putting in 7 dishes for 2 people, what difference can 1/2 order of truffle fries make? I thought so. This was good, but i think by this point we've done enough damages to our palates that the fries didn't wow us!  We also had the anniversary cocktail, the prosecco, and the margarita to drink. Anniversary cocktail was amazing, prosecco was good, and margarita didn't do much for me - the eggwhite wasn't my cup of tea. And for dessert, he had the rhubarb-y tuesday while i watched - I was about to explode. Dessert was good, although I'd recommend getting something with chocolate.  The bill came out on the high side but with the amount of food we had how could it not? Service was flawless. He was in love with our server (he said she reminds him of one of his old teacher - warm and sweet). In the beginning I thought things were a little stiff and pretentious but it eased up in the end.  It would have been perfect if they offered to get us a cab - yet neither the valet nor the hostess cared to ask  (which they weren't doing anything so I thought they should make themselves useful).",0.9989,0.779,0.177,0.045,0.5329486772486776

She disappears for several minutes, returns and asks for the voucher so that it can be verified.  (Just in case I found it outside, or something, I guess.)  She then counsels me that ""tax and gratuity are not included.""  I asked if a manager was available.  Better - one would think - the owner was there.  She surfaced, voucher in hand with the most perplexed look I've ever seen.  We sat, I explained just how annoyed I was and how any confusion could have been cleared up if someone had called me earlier in the day - before I drove halfway across town AND paid for parking.   She babbled on about not having experience with these vouchers, the company should have called her, and some other nonsense before eventually agreeing to honor the voucher that clearly says on the front that the face value NEVER expires.   Since I prefer my food to be prepared with love, served without attitudes, foreign objects, body fluids, etc., I declined.  mks clearly missed an opportunity to live up to their reputation for great service.  And they will never get another opportunity with me.   I phoned the company where I purchased the voucher and demanded a refund.  Oh, and to add insult to injury, mks had already marked the voucher ""redeemed.""  Give me a break....",0.975,0.811,0.118,0.071,0.47311507936507935

While my servers seemed nice, they were rushing me.  It was as if 1 hour was the max time I could spend on my dinner.  I had to tell them I needed some time before I ordered dessert.  Add to this the poor attitude of one of the hostesses (until the end when she tried elicit a good opinion from me of the place), and I was totally underwhelmed with the whole experience.

2013-03-02,4.0,"In Chicago to celebrate our anniversary, my wife and I spent our first evening dinner at MK.  We couldn't have been happier. With the cold wind blowing and snow showers showering outside, it was wonderful to walk into the welcoming warmth and ambiance of the room.  We were seated promptly after giving our coats to the hostess, and I left special care and feeding instructions for my gray wool fedora. Drinks were ordered and arrived promptly. My wife had a celebratory Cosmo which she deemed spectacular as far as Cosmos go.  I decided to fore-go my usual Negroni and ordered a Vesper martini having seen both a bottle of Lillet Blanc at the bar and Cocchi Americano on the drink menu.  It was cold, tart and superb. What followed was a wonderful meal.  Unable to choose between the tasting and a la carte menus, we were able to choose from both of them to our hearts (and stomachs) content. The prawns (three, one with head on) with hearts of palm and saffron butter were succulent, while the grilled octopus with the golden raisins in the aioli gave just the right amount of sweet counterpoint to the rich smokiness of the meat. Our mains were the striped bass for my wife and the veal porterhouse for me, both featuring trumpet mushrooms.  We were in heaven with each bite. We were stuffed, but our server Tino was nice enough to deliver two perfectly almond shaped dollops of ice cream to round out our meal and put a nice cap on our first dinner of our anniversary Chicago getaway.

Definitely a candidate for a Michelin star, and the first time I ate here it was my favorite meal, but since I've eaten at 3 Michelin starred places, I can see why this place may be just a half notch below.  Pros: -PHENOMENAL service. Absolutely unmatched. -Appetizers & Dessert -Wine list -Frites Cons: -Entrees are disappointing compared to apps & desserts. The entrees are pretty typical steakhouse fare, and much less inventive and interesting than the appetizers. Tend to be very high quality pieces of meat but not prepared in any special way, and pretty much all served with a rather insufficient sauce and unappetizing spinach.

2013-02-01,4.0,"I'm not big on surprises. I think it's the control freak in me that hates to be left out of the decision-making process, but I'm working on it. I found out where we were dining about 30 minutes before we left for dinner. Not enough time to scour the menu, read some reviews, or anything else I normally would do - jut enough time to check the dress code and put on proper attire (dressy FYI). When we arrived at MK, we were warmly greeted by the host and offered our choice of regular or banquette table. Personally, I think the banquette tables are much more intimate. The interior is simple, yet elegant; rustic, yet modern with sleek white lines, exposed wood and brick; all setting the tone for an intimate experience. Overwhelmed by the wine list (book, really), we went with cocktails to start. I enjoyed the 10 Year Anniversary cocktail with grapefruit, St. Germain, mint and citron vodka, while he enjoyed his On Top of Old Smoky - a double rye, chipotle peppers and orange bitters. My date had done his homework and suggested we start with the scallop appetizer. Our server split the appetizer onto two plates without us asking, which was much appreciated. I liked, but did not love the scallop appetizer. Served with grapes, marcona almonds and a chimicurri - I much prefer large scallops to the bay ones and felt they got a bit lost in the accompanying ingredients. For our entrees, we ordered the striped bass and sturgeon with the intention of sampling each other's meals. We also got a bottle of the Four Graces Pinot Gris to enjoy with our meal.* Of the two dishes, we both agreed that the sturgeon (my dish) was the winner and resultingly, I didn't do a whole lot of sharing. My sturgeon, a meatier textured fish, was paired with truffle scented sunchokes, pearl onions, and red wine sauce. The fish was so moist and flavorful, we both let out involuntary grunts of delight upon our first taste; I wouldn't hesitate to order this dish again. The striped bass was good too, but paled in comparison to the divineness that was the sturgeon. For dessert we split the cake and shake; a decadent chocolate layer cake accompanied by the most adorable little vanilla shake. Service was friendly, helpful and attentive the entire evening. Our wine glasses never languished even though our bottle was chilling well away from our table. We had a late reservation and ended up closing the place down, but it never felt like we were pressured to move things along. It all made for a most enjoyable dining experience.  4. stars: If all surprises were like this, it would be easy to reconsider my stance on them. *Wine bottles were 50% the Thursday we dined.

I went with a group of couples and we started with cocktails in the lounge.  The waiter was very rude to one of my friends when she wanted to send back a cocktail she didn't like.  The cocktails were $13-$16 each, and no one in my group was impressed with the drinks they got.  The $16 Manhattans arrived in tiny glasses, used regular ice, and weren't good. The food and wine and dinner were good, but so expensive.  Our waiter was obnoxiously over-involved in our table.  We were trying to eat and have our own conversations, but the waiter kept coming over and trying to joke around with us.  I like friendly service, but I don't go out to a nice restaurant to be entertained by the waiter.  His jokes often made us feel uncomfortable, as it was hard to tell if he was serious or not about things like the kitchen only having 1 order of a certain dish left. I don't plan on going to MK ever again.  We spent $200 per couple and I would have much rather gone to two $100 dinners where the food would have been just as good.",0.6987,0.707,0.151,0.141,0.6074673992673991

Mk is located a little away from the hustle and bustle of river north area saturated with other restaurants and is in a beautiful building with open loft seating, timber ceilings and a sleek modern clean decor. Right up my alley. Parking is no problem whatsoever. We came in from the burbs and were about 20 min earlier than our reservation and it was no problem getting seated right away. Wine list was great, I was maybe slightly saddened to hear they had no Sauvignon blanc from New Zealand ( I am obsessed with this after a recent nz trip) but happy to try a bottle out from Cali. It was delic and ended up being great with our food. We opted out of the tasting menu option although it was tempting that you could pick and choose from the tasting menu if one thing struck your fancy. I went with the arugula salad and hubby went with the scallops to start. When the first course came out I really didn't know if my husband would stop eating the bread. He even looked at me and was like, you can make bread at home, right?  Please?  Ridiculous. Anyhow, my arugula was perfect with a light lemon dressing and creamy nutty goat cheese to pair. Such a simple concept salad with perfect flavor. The scallops also hit it out of the park with beautiful mushrooms on the side. Oh and I'm forgetting the literally tiny deviled quail egg and mushroom bite that came out before. Excellent across the board. On to the main course. Here I have to tell you how much I love chicken. Ok I know there was duck and fish and veal on that menu but something about The potential for a perfectly cooked roast chicken on Christmas Eve just seemed so satisfying and maybe plain for a fancy restaurant but I was willing to take that chance. And it did not disappoint. My chicken was perfectly cooked and fabulous. The crispy salty skin and the moist juice meat, wow, delic. I will likely never be able to cook chicken like that. My husband had the venison which he ate every last drop. so good. At this point we realized the meal was just getting better and better with each course and we couldn't wait for dessert. We were torn between basically all the selections. They all sounded fabulous. I was pretty full at this point so we opted to share. Our waiter passionately recommended the bread pudding, a seasonal item, so we said ok sounds great. wow, great recommendation!  It was pear bread pudding with cranberry with a caramel sauce And was it heavenly a perfect Christmas Eve dessert.

After asking about any dietary restrictions, which I have, he then asked us if we needed to be out the door by a certain time. I have never had a waiter ask me this before, and as we did have plans later on, he made sure we were done when we needed to be.  On top of this,  the special touches that the staff took for us would make me enthusiastically recommend this restaurant to others celebrating a special occasion. These special touches included: a customized anniversary greeting on our menu, complimentary proseco, another anniversary greeting on our dessert plate, and everyone from the hostess to the back waiter to the coat check person wishing us a happy anniversary. Our waiter was phenomenal, especially in assisting us choose a bottle of wine, and we ended up tipping 25%, which we have only done once before, as we really felt he went above and beyond.

The hoary, grizzled veteran MK--this ancient warhorse opened way back in the Twentieth Century, in 1998!--still takes reservations, though.  And it had great reviews on Yelp, Zagat, et al.  And we saw a bunch of reviews extolling MK as a romantic spot.  And it has one of those crowd-pleasing ""New American"" menus where every damn thing sounds fantastic. So we made the selection.  As it turned out, the reservation was a good thing because a cold rain was falling almost sideways.  And the reviews are pretty much spot-on except for the romantical angle:  MK is attractive enough but seemed a bit more of a  power/business scene and a source of tax write-offs than what I would think of as an anniversary spot.  It is big and and bustling and stark and slick and, although modern, maybe already starting to look a a tiny bit dated. Anyway, the food was pretty much uniformly terrific:  For starters, we shared the beet salad and the grilled baby octopus, which set a high bar.  Both were beautifully composed and had a bunch of well-balanced flavor components, and the octopus was just about perfectly cooked.  The entrees, arctic char and rabbit, were both really good-looking and delicious and just about perfectly cooked also, although perhaps a little bit oversalted.  And somehow the rabbit dish could have somehow used just a little more punch.  The dessert list has some silly names (""Sweet Thang,"" ""Banana Popstar,"" etc.), but the ""Chocalate Duet"" (dark chocolate semifreddo, salty shortbread, nut brown ale ice cream) was great. Why not five stars?  MK is not the most expensive restaurant in Chicago but it seems a hair on the high side for food that was consistently excellent but did not quite take it to the next level.  Plus, the rush:  This is apparently not a restaurant that values a leisurely dining experience.  The power diners probably appreciate each course coming immediately on the heels of the last, but, try as we might to savor our food, we got pushed through our dinner in well under two hours.  (Aside from this, Julio was a very professional and engaging head waiter.) MK is very appealing and seems like a dependable, consistent choice.  I'd definitely go back.  But not after first trying, in my dreamworld, about 40 or 50 other high-end Chicago restaurants that we haven't been to (and even waiting in some lines).",0.9971,0.834,0.15,0.016,0.5343195108984581

To put that in perspective I eat out every day. The food was very good but nothing otherworldly. Then again that's not what this place is about. The food was rock solid and the technique for all dishes was spot on. We started with oysters, octopus, and the kale salad.  For entrees we had the Arctic char, and salmon. To accompany those we had the brussel sprouts. Don't get me wrong it was all very good but the Brussel sprouts were a true standout. Everyone and their mother has Brussel sprouts with bacon/pork belly. But all too often they are over cooked and get that hit of sulfur either becoming wet mush for too crisp. MK's were truly perfect. They had a nice caramel sear, and were cooked through but neither dry or mush. Another misstep that many people do is the pool of pork fat in the serving dish. It was apparent the bacon in MK's version had been cooked independently and then added to the dish removing all possibility of the sprouts being oily and over powered by the smokey bacon flavor. To punctuate a great dinner. The valet had the car running and warm the second I stepped out on the sidewalk. Mind you I still had the ticket in my pocket and hadn't even given it to him.

Luckily, though, I didn't have much time to people watch as my date was great and the food definitely gave us something to talk about. We weren't too hungry, which is a shame as the entrees looked delicious. Instead, we ordered a couple appetizers, each, paired with a couple glasses of wine. We had the butternut squash ravioli, scallops, tuna tartare with celery root remoulade, pumpkin soup, and a crunchy tart side that I have no name for.  I think my two favorites were the pumpkin soup and the scallops. The soup has that warm winter flavor that is balanced with apple and ginger pieces. They do a great job with their scallops - most places cook their scallops to taste fishy but feel meat-y. MK's scallops own their undeniably fishy feel. There's that nice rawness to the meat of the scallop, and the texture is soft and smooth. The scallops were so good that they became the first scallops that my scared-of-food friend ever ate, finished, and asked more for.  We had two glasses of wine, each, and so should you...two at the very least. The wine menu here is impressive. Not a list but a book of wine - every kind, every region. Total bill per person: mid $70s.",0.9882,0.797,0.156,0.047,0.634345238095238

If you leave them a request while booking they will follow through with that request. Two months ago I stated it was a birthday and sure enough when we sat down a personalized  ""Happy Birthday"" was on the actual menu! And that was only the beginning of the comfortable, attentative service MK has. They do not have a large menu of choices, but they don't need it. The butternut squash ravioli was absurdly delicious. They salad was the freshest thing I've ever tasted. That artic char dish and the chicken dish were perfect. And then the peanut butter and jelly dessert - which was not really peanutbutter and jelly of course but still tasted spectacular. Our waiter (and all the staff there) really really really know what they are talking about. It seemed most of the staff have been there since the restaurant's inception 14 years ago. The pastry chef even came out and explained to us how she makes the peanut butter and jelly dessert. Overall this is an extremely valuable experience and one you don't want to miss.

We had oysters, octopus, Veal, Pork Chop and half order of the fries.  Oh and some freebie tasters from the kitchen.  I love it when a restaurant gives freebie tasters!  I live in NY and we eat out a lot...from expensive to cheap eats so it's not like I was just wowed because I got freebies.  I personally feel that when a restaurant does that it just makes customers feel welcomed and thanked for dining at that particular place. Anyways...our meal was AMAZING!  The food was perfectly cooked.  I'm a well done kind of person (I know...horrible right!).  The first thing I always judge about a restaurant is service and then if they make what I order the way I want it.  I had the pork chop...it was well done (not pink on the inside) and it was still JUICY and tender!  Hubby had the veal.  He ordered medium well and it came out perfect.  I even  stole an end piece and was amazed!  The oysters were fresh and the octopus soooo good!  The fries are to die for!  If we weren't so stuffed we would have ordered dessert.  Even though we didn't they sent out a freebie at the end of the meal!    I do admit the cost was a bit pricey BUT I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Chicago.  The level of service is what really makes a restaurant.  Leslie and Enrique were awesome and definitely contributed to making our night wonderful!  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!",0.9941,0.796,0.191,0.012,0.527173579109063

The desserts are usually outstanding but none of their new additions rival the very first dessert I had here: rhurbarb open face tart with streusel, rhubarb shake and other deliciousness. It pains me to say that I was disappointed with my last visit here as the short ribs were dry and fatty and the sweet potato dessert not that great (better than most places but still underwhelming as compared to my previous visits).

The food at MK is locally sourced (for the most part) and has a large variety of seafood available.  I also can't forget to mention that they have truffle fries available as a side dish to the dinner courses - they were very tasty and did not skimp on the truffle oil.  A seasonal tasting menu is available as well - this included options from the menu (which they allowed you to substitute if you have a food allergy or preference). Our meal was fresh and flavorful.  I had the white fish and lobster dish which was fantastic - the sauce that accompanied the fish and lobster was rich and added to the flavors of the fish.  I enjoyed how the fish, vegetables and sauce complimented each other throughout the meal.

I went for dinner at 6p on a Thursday and was pretty suprised to find we were the only ones there.  I was there with my boyfriend, but if you were on a first date or with someone you didn't know it could be a little awkward.  Our server, I think his name was Julio, was awesome. So personable, didn't rush us and made the experience fun. I think the service is the ""above average"" part of MK. We each had 1 glass of wine. If you're really into wine, this wine list is for you. It's very extensive.  Food Octopus: Great flavor. The sauce is amazing and unlike any other thing I've tasted. This was the best food of the night. Goat Cheese Ravoli: Exactly how it sounds. I would have liked some other flavors in there. I thought it was a little plain Frittes: I thought they were fine. The closest thing I could think of was McDonald's Frys... but thicker. I don't see what the hype is about. The aoli was okay, but I've had better. I thought the frittes at Girl and the Goat were much better.  Corn: I enjoyed this. It has a lot of spice and I'm a big spicy lover.  Duck: My BF got the duck, which was the special of the night. I thought it was pretty good. Whitefish and Lobster: This was the main entree I got. I thought it was good, but nothing stand out. I wouldn't get it again. It wasn't piping hot when I got it and I wish it was. The whitefish had some decent flavor. I thought the lobster was a little dry... if that's possible.

Let's start with the important stuff - THE WINE.  The wine menu was extensive and wonderful.  Over the course of several hours, we had two wonderful French Bordeaux (Chateau Lafite-Rothschild & Chateau Latour) and one amazing blend from Washington State.  Every bottle was perfect.  Good wine sets the tone for a great dinner. First we ordered several things of the a la carte menu.  There were three of us and we ordered more than we needed.  The half dozen oysters were French Kiss and they were splendid - very fresh.  The pasta was filled with creamy goodness and left us wanting more.  The tuna tartare was good - but not amazing.  The baby octopus had a steak-ish flavor as it was grilled over hardwood charcoal and served with picked fingerling potatoes.  After a few bites - we moved on to other things.  I'm pretty sure I'm missing a few dishes ... and that's embarrassing. For dinner - we ordered way more than we could ever eat.  There was a kobe flank steak special that was superb - probably could have made a meal out of this dish alone.  The peppercorn crusted yellowfin tuna was seared rare, but was just mediocre.  Not let down - just not impressed.  The standout entree was the whitefish/lobster dish.  It was pan roasted Lake Erie whitefish and poached Maine Lobster with mung bean sprouts and mushrooms - all in a red curry broth.  It was amazing.  So good we were almost fighting over the portion. The good food was so good that it far outweighed the just okay food. Our server was phenomenal.  They work as a team and we were never left wanting. On their website -  mkchicago.com  - they state - ""That food is a metaphor for the good things in life.""  I could not agree more.  In fact, the experience we had at MK last week made for a very good night and one we'll remember.

You can joke around with the servers (unlike some fancier restaurants) but they are also very professional and knowledgeable. Also, the first time I came here was with my boyfriend on my birthday, and they had printed menus that said ""Happy Birthday Tal."" Very nice touch that definitely made me feel special. Cocktails: very creative. The ""cucumber"" is very light and refreshing (cucumber vodka, coconut water, and lemon)- very nice, strong drink for starting off the night in the lounge. I also had the Moscow Mule, which was good, but kind of tasted like something I would have with brunch; kind of sparkling almost. Anyway, you can't win them all. Food: haven't had one thing here that I didn't like. The tuna is delicious, and I don't even like tuna. The mushroom fettuccini is homemade and is one of the better pastas I've had, with a really unique sauce (and I generally don't find pasta unique). The salmon is good, but not as good as some of the other things on the menu. Duck breast was perfectly cooked. Pommes frites with truffle sauce are also delicious, but a few tips: it's pretty large, so order the off-menu half order. Also, they are cooked in beef fat, so if you're vegetarian, keep that in mind. What I like most about this place is that, unlike many other restaurants of the same caliber, I actually left feeling full both times, so much so that I passed on dessert (even though there is always that little pocket of space).  You really can't go wrong with this place- everything is great and the place is just so cute. Definitely recommend for any special occasion.",0.9989,0.692,0.297,0.011,0.6276035196687372
2012-06-21,5.0,"I absolutely loved MK!  Came here with my parents and we loved how it was nice and classy without being pretentious like a lot of the hot spot big namers downtown. The restaurant was roomy and we never felt claustrophobic or packed like sardines (nor rushed during the meal).The service was very friendly as soon as we walked in and continued to be top-notch the rest of the evening.  And of course, the food. First off, I have to say it was nice to go to a lovely restaurant and pay $$$ and actually get enough food to fill satisfied. It's good-sized portions here, none of that here's a bite and we're charging you an entree crap.   The chef prepared a cute little bite-sized tomato and cheese creation to start the meal, and of course, there's the customary selection of breads with a very tasty salted butter.  For appetizers we had oysters from Vancouver and Virginia, which were very tasty.  For entrees we got the whitefish/lobster, pan-seared walleye, and grilled salmon.  The whitefish/lobster was like seafood heaven on earth. The lobster and the whitefish were both cooked nice and tender. The oyster mushrooms and pea risotto was the perfect addition, and the red curry broth gave it just the right about of kick to not overpower the natural flavors of the ingredients. I mean, I could seriously eat this every day. The pan-seared walleye was also good. I've never had walleye before, but I would say it's a good meat-lovers' fish. The pieces flaked off easily and the dish just had a great combination of flavors. The grilled salmon was also pretty good, although since salmon is so common I would recommend trying something you wouldn't cook at home on a regular basis. The sauces were tasty and the salmon was grilled medium as requested. And before I go onto dessert, a note on the cocktails - I got the whisky tango, which was strong just as I like it, but also had a nice kick of tangerine flavors which made it even better.  Dessert: we got the ice cream selection of vanilla, banana malt, and mango sorbet. Tasty, but nothing extremely special. What was amazing though was the Cake and Shake. It was a mini vanilla shake and a slice of a very decadent chocolate cake. And I mean chocolate in every way. The chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, chocolate hot fudge, chocolate pieces on top, chocolate chocolate chocolate heaven. We left very, very full and extremely satisfied.

He actually grunted when we asked if he had a more private table (we were celebrating my wife's birthday). The atmosphere was heavy and melancholic. It was Friday night 9 pm and felt as if it was 11:45 pm on a weeknight and they were ready to close and leave. The food was OK. We shared the Pasta and Tuna tartar for starters. The Pasta wasn't bad but was very oily and plain. I had better tuna at the cheesecake factory. For entrees we ordered the Veal porterhouse. It was pretty good. Definitely not a Wow. We also ordered an 8 dollar side of French fries that were no more than hot dog stand quality. All this time we tried to ignore the waiters chatting loudly in Spanish and laughing at a nearby corner. We decided to cut our losses and asked for the check. 134 $ before tip (+10$ for the valet). Plenty of great restaurants in Chicago.

I never say ""no"" to french fries and the truffle cream was yummy, but not over-the-top rich.

Having experienced a very ""alcohol-forward"" evening, already, we we glad to see that half bottled were available for dinner.  We ordered a half of the Ridge Red Zinfandel and started with the Gnocchi, after an amuse bouche that was very tasty.  These Gnocchi were special.  They were so light and airy while retaining a substantial feel, the came with an egg on top.  Upon breaking the egg and mixing the velvety yolk with the tender gnocchi and the parmagiano-reggiano and basil, the dish soon elevated to a top 5 spot in my memory for starters.   We also tried a half order of the house fries.  Unnecessarily carbolicious but, wonderfully indulgent.   Dinner was tuna for the lady and rabbit for me.  The rabbit was prepared so that it could be eaten without aid of a knife.  The tuna was lightly seared and would flake off in small even tiles from the rest of the meat, just the way it should.  The polenta on my dish and the kale served as texture and flavor contrasts to the pancetta wrapped loin.  The real challenge of the meal was taking time to enjoy it.   Finally, for dessert, Cake and Shake for 2 (1 cake/2 shakes).  This was an event.  The cake was dense, rich and not too sweet and the shake was thick and rich completely worth it.    My wife actually reserved some fries to dip in her shake, an old standby.  If you've ever done the shake and fries trick on a fast food level, consider elevating your game.  I also hope that MK considers this as an option because their version is mind-numbingly delicious. We closed the place down that night and weren't rushed out at all.  This experience rose to the occasion worthy of a celebration of a wonderful year with a beautiful woman.  That makes MK ""As Good As It Gets""  in my book.",0.9958,0.813,0.159,0.028,0.5347635582010583

I really loved the flavor of the lobster and whitefish which I ordered for my entree. One of my friends who ordered the same thing thought it was a tad bit salty but since I like salty, I thought the salt level was fine for me. My other friend's walleye was good but way too salty (even I thought so).  This helps me transition to the service... So service was impeccable the whole time and really accommodating. When we mentioned the salty walleye to the server, he said that he can get us a new dish but we said that was okay and we just wanted them to be aware. But to make up for it, he brought us each a glass of moscato, an extra dessert and a milkshake for each of us that comes with the cake and shake.  I really love restaurants that go the extra mile for their patrons.

I've been to some great restaurants in Chicago, but this may just be my favorite. For our three year anniversary, my boyfriend took me here, and as soon as I sat down I was greeted with a menu that said ""hers"" and had basically all my favorite foods on it. My boyfriend had a menu that had all his favorite foods on it. WHAT? How is that possible, this place is magic! So I found out that it was not magic, but very close. Apparently they have an option where you can tell the restaurant what foods you like, and they will create a special menu for each of you. And I have to say, what I ended up with was the exact food I never knew I wanted.  Started off with a little pastry with duck confit and avocado. It was a tiny little taste explosion in my mouth. At first I was admiring the pastry, then I tasted the avocado, and then oh my goodness there is the duck. Perfectly blended together.  First real course was bass, which to my surprise was served sashimi style. Did not know you know sashimi bass, but most definitely approve. It had hints of ginger, some coarse sea salt, arugula, and I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful these things taste together. Want more.  Next course, fettuccine with wild mushrooms. I am extremely picky about the texture of all noodles I eat, and I will tell you right now, the noodles are homemade and made perfectly. Al dente, I'm told it's called.  Third course was shortribs. I was a little skeptical at first because I'm not really big on large meat courses, and at first it looked like just three huge chunks of meat on my plate. HOWEVER, it was so tender that I didn't even have to use my knife, and the meat just melted in my mouth. The potatoes were also extremely excellent.  Last but CERTAINLY not least was my dessert, which was just a ton of different kinds of chocolate. I ate a bombe and I'm not exactly sure what was in it (some kind of mousse?) but so awesome. This was paired with mexican chocolate ice cream and some kind of cream that tasted like cookies-and-cream. Soo delicious. Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate, my favorite.  Overall, kudos to boyfriend for knowing what I love to eat and kudos to MK for making the best possible version of that meal.

Everything that we ordered was split in the back which was such a nice touch.  We started with the fettuccine and wild mushrooms.  The pasta was perfectly cooked, the mushrooms earthy and the flavors were rich.  A great start to the whole meal.  We followed with the arugula salad that was light and clean.  For the entrees we split their Red Thai Curry fish and the venison.  The fish was fresh, followed with a little heat, and in a light aromatic broth.  Absolutely delicious!  The next course was the venison with the side brussel sprouts and pancetta, along with their famous pomme frites w/ truffle dipping sauce. My cousin is a person who categorizes venison with lamb, veal, and any other exotic animal not to be eaten.  She promised me she would try the meat but even she was hesitant in her own challenge.  She took her first bite and she was converted to a venison lover.  We both ate the whole dish.  As for the pomme frites, they were perfectly paired with the truffle dipping sauce.  It smelled heavenly and it tasted divine.  I know if I could make that a perfume I would wear it well.  Throughout dinner the service and waiters were always attentive and knowledgeable of their menu.  The two waiters that made our experience memorable were Enrique and Sergio.  Sergio went above and beyond and recommended a great glass of wine with every plate that paired perfectly.  They really do have a very nice selection of wines.  So after being completely stuffed and ready to be rolled out of there, we were told we had to make room for dessert.  We contemplated for about a second and went with the Two Bananas and Mucho Chocolate.  Both were delicious but the memorable note was the Mexican hot chocolate ice cream with the chocolate bombe. It tasted just like how my abuelita made it.  All I needed was a bolillo to make a mexican ice cream sandwich.     I definitely will be making the stop here on my next business trip because the food, the service and the staff made it so memorable.  If I lived in Chicago, I would find a reason to celebrate here all the time.  Cheers!",0.998,0.793,0.192,0.015,0.5980072463768115

I have lived in Chicago for the last 7 years, and I can honestly say that of all of the restaurants that I have been to, MK is the BEST that Chicago has to offer. I tend to be a little bit picky when is comes to how my meals are prepared and presented, and I actually felt as if the plates were a piece of art work, and tasted even better. My parents and I both agree that after every single bite, there was the wow factor. The plates were incredibly savory, and we were in anticipation as to what was to come next.  My parents had the whitefish/lobster, and I had the fluke plate. We ordered sides of mushrooms, oysters, and the almost ceaser salad. The presentation was beautiful, and the food was even better. Of all of the restaurants that we have been to in NYC, Detroit, and Chicago, this one is the best. Our entire ride back to my home was about how amazing the food, and service was tonight. It was definitely an experience that I will share with my friends and colleagues. Chef Williams, Chef Galzin, Evan and the entire staff were incredibly hospitable, especially since it was my Mom's birthday. My parents will never forget the time that they had at MK, and want to visit it again the next time that they come in to Chicago.

Food, service and atmosphere were all exactly what we were looking for on a nice date night. The ambience both in the small lounge and the dining room is visually appealing without being too trendy, and relaxing without being too fancy. We were seated at a two-top on the mid-level so we had a nice view of the whole restaurant. I visited once before and was seated on the balcony which was even cooler, if you can request it. Service - the servers work in teams of 2, and are quite friendly and good at giving recommendations. We also had other visitors to our table who would pick up an empty plate once in awhile and chat with us. The only server we had that wasn't top-notch was the guy who brought out our desserts - he must have been in a hurry and didn't describe anything, just set the plates down (I guess we had been spoiled during our other courses, when our servers explained the dishes' components upon delivery).  And now, most importantly, the food. AHHHHHH, so delicious. They dropped off two little amuses at the beginning: some kind of foie gras concoction (I couldn't sample due to pregnancy but my husband loved it) and a mini smoked salmon bruschetta which was to die for (yeah I know technically I shouldn't eat smoked salmon either, but I had to cheat, it looked so beautiful!) I had a simple arugula salad with goat cheese for my starter, and my hubby had the octopus which he loved. I'd had it before and can also recommend it. I had the fluke for dinner - perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of sauce on the plate. Accompanying root vegetables were perfectly seasoned as well - I felt like the dish was created just for me that night because everything hit the spot. Hubby had the whitefish/lobster, which has an Asian flair to it, and also loved it. We decided to be super indulgent and get 2 desserts: the ""Cake and Shake"" and ""Two Bananas Walk Into a Bar"" (I love their dessert names!) Cake and Shake was good, but larger than I'd imagined, so I overdid it a little. I'm usually not one for milkshakes but I made an exception for this one - so light, not too sugary. The Two Bananas was honestly one of the most creative desserts I've seen - so many different components of the dish just really came together.

The amuse - it's like they knew I love smoked sturgeon... The octopus was awesome, that woodfired grill flavor really came through and I loved the lemon peel and the raisins. Great. The shortribs (special) were amazing!! so tender and I loved the carrot and celery aiolis, it was like a dressed up version of grandmas pot roast, complete with potato galettes, which were like the best case scenario of a one-night-stand between latkes and tater tots. I could have had a whole plate of those.  I have to mention the salmon because, when I saw some of the menu items (including this), I was like, ugh how late 90s/early 00's nouveau American. The salmon with the asian flavor, the roast chicken, the seared tuna with the flavored mashed... blah blah blah. But, there is a reason this cuisine was so popular - it's delicious! Salmon normally puts me to sleep, but this one was exceptional - perfectly cooked, great kick from the mustard... just great.  The cake and shake was out of this world. I'm not a dessert person, but this won me over. Cocktails were also awesome. 10th anniversary (st germain, grapefruit, mint) with gin instead of vodka - per our server - was excellent.

The giant MK is the first thing you see, written huge and plastered on the side of the bricks from the outside. Someone with very good taste treated me to a birthday dinner here, and I have been a handful of times since. It's beautiful. It's also $$$. Inside is a two-level, impossibly high dining room with some huge abstract art, cool lighting, and really modern furniture. It's got personality and design going for it. The chef puts out seasonal mini palette-starters that are really thoughtful. The one I remember is some type of salty asparagus soup and it was perfect. I've had gnocchi with kale, mushroom pasta, arugula salad with rosemary lemon dressing. All were fantastic. My date did pork shank, I had wagyu. Everything was beautifully crafted, tender, perfectly cooked. This guy gets flavors and that's all there is to say. The cake and shake is one of the simplest, most perfect birthday desserts I've ever ordered. It's a vanilla bean mini milkshake and a tiny bit of cake. It's so easy it seems ironic - except it isn't. But it's more than just the food, which is why it gets 5. The experience of being here is really wonderful. People all dress up to come here. The waitstaff is smart and cool and meticulous.

Two friends and I came here after purchasing a Gilt City deal that allowed us to provide food likes and dislikes for the chef to create custom menus for each of us. My menu consisted of an arugula salad starter (baby arugula, shaved fennel, pine nuts, humboldt goat cheese, lemon vinaigrette -- I asked for a blue cheese in place of the goat cheese); a house made fettucine with seasonal and wild mushrooms, pecorino, and thyme; a whitefish/lobster combo -- seared lake superior whitefish, poached maine lobster, french green beans, fennel, fingerling potatoes, littleneck clams, and bouillabaisse broth; and ""mucho chocolate"" for dessert -- guanaja dark chocolate bombe, cajeta mousse cocoa, guajillo, almond, rice milk, and mexican chocolate ice cream.  The arugula salad -- lots of arugula, not a paltry starter at all. Not soaked in dressing -- great way to start the meal in addition to homemade breads.  The pasta - my favorite dish of the night, and of all the other dishes I sampled from my friends. The pasta was freshly cut, thin, and the cream sauce was strong, rich, but also light.  Whitefish/lobster -- I'm not a huge fan of whitefish, loved the lobster, and the fish was cooked well so points for that. The attention to detail was most evident with this dish -- little clams and small finely cut green bean was scattered throughout.  Dessert - Most inventive dish of the night. Strong ice cream. Would recommend the ""2 bananas walked in"" dessert over this one. Wine pairing - No complaints. Overall, the food was not super adventurous (not like Next or even Graham Elliot) but was extremely well prepared. Great attention to detail with regards to both presentation and flavor. Semi-small portions that hit the spot. Food itself is probably 4.5 but I docked points because the place was a little stuffy.

The house chardonnay, made by Au Bon Climat especially for MK, is a delicious wine, on the lighter side for chardonnay but with just enough muscle to pair well and not overpower the food.  Yum!

2011-12-15,5.0,"I think I might have found my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. The food I enjoyed on my recent visit was every bit as excellent as previous yelpers lead me to believe it would be. I was happy to find that the portion sizes were adequate: not too little, not too much. My co-diner often leaves hungry while I'm often stuffed and I think we both left just feeling full - which is a difficult thing for a restaurant to accomplish, especially when we both order the same entree. But the thing that I truly enjoyed about my MK experience was the service. From the first moment of contact - making the reservation - everyone was exceedingly nice. They weren't nice in a creepy, I'm just doing this because I have to, sort of way, but in a way that was fairly genuine - showing that they take service seriously. And, while we were there there was a very slight issue with our food, which we were happy to overlook because everything was so great and it really wasn't a big deal, but when the issue came to their attention everyone on staff made sure that an apology was offered. Really, it was by-the-book service, but it was basically the first time (in ages) that I've received good service in a Chicago restaurant [note: after dropping out of culinary school I couldn't eat out for several years because I was so appalled by the lack of service, so it really does take a lot for me to compliment an establishment on their service].  Another plus: while this is a more ""upscale"" restaurant, there is very little pretension - a welcome experience! So many blase restaurants in this city have servers and bar tenders with attitude & it's really just a big turn off. This is a restaurant that my mid-western mother would find ""fancy"" and yet would feel completely comfortable in the atmosphere.  If I ate there every week I might get tired of the food, but as a location to have a ""nice"" dinner out I highly recommend it and doubt that it could be a disappointing experience.",0.9865,0.78,0.159,0.061,0.5556181379007464

The space is very nice and contemporary.  Our duo of servers were very good (though we know a chef at another restaurant in town and I think he told them to be nice to us).  The table next door didn't seem to quite have the same level of attention and courtesy.  Still, it shows that if the servers try, they can do a really good job.  Overall, a very good experience at MK.  Too bad Chicagoans are ""over"" it.",0.9932,0.757,0.216,0.027,0.6326992143658811

This might be the type of place you try once, but nothing about it would make me want to come back. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy, not the most desirable part of town, very deserted. Let's continue on to atmosphere--a bit dark (romantic you might say) but then spotlights on your face at the dinner table. Energy level of the crowd on a Friday night, low and kind of on the older side, kind of boring. I think we were the loudest people there and we're not that loud.  This ""impeccable"" service I've read about in other reviews--can't say that we experienced it. Our server was over-bearing and kind of creepy. She would hover over us and ask if we needed anything and we would say no and she would stand there and hover some more, and stare, and then hover some more, before she would get the hint and move along. She gave us a 30-minute run-down of the specials and menu, which put every single one of us to sleep. I just needed to know what's good--not every single ingredient in every single dish. Then there's the food, which for the most part is very bland and boring. The best things we ordered were the truffle fries and the side of the Brussels sprouts. And if those are the best things on your menu, that's kind of sad. The tuna and the whitefish and lobster were bland and tasteless. The swordfish was slightly better. Between the two appetizers, the mini scallops were tastier than the ravioli. Dessert was also disappointing. We ordered the ""two bananas walk into a bar""--and again, I was expecting fabulousness, but got boring blandness. I know every other review on here says to order it for dessert, I'm telling you not to. Go with the chocolate cake instead--much better. Even the malt shakes were average--cute in mini glasses with mini straws--but still average. Then there's the bill--not only was this meal unnecessarily overpriced, but they added 20% gratuity to our party of 5!!!

Our entrees were also great.  I had the seared arctic char, and he had the lobster/whitefish duo.  My char was perfectly seasoned and seared, and the peruvian potatoes and salsa verde were perfect accompaniments.  His lobster/whitefish was an interesting take..very Asian-influenced, not your usual buttery gluttonous lobster, but amazing nonetheless.  We added a side of frites with truffle aioli, which was outstanding. We toyed with the idea of not doing dessert, but then remembered that you can't do a birthday without cake, so we did the cake and shake duo.  I've never had a vanilla shake quite like that, and I'm glad I haven't, because if I knew where to get shakes that tasted like that, I'd be 800 lbs.  The cake was perfectly suited to go with the small shake--chocolatey, but not in an obtrusive way.  It was the perfect complement.",0.998,0.732,0.24,0.028,0.7108294930875576

We thought the food was pretty solid but not incredible.  I have to commend MK for agreeing to my request (in advance) to try the bison.  True customer service is clearly the focus here, which I find quite unusual in the fine dining scene (at least to this extent).  I can not thank MK enough for being so agreeable and welcoming. We tried the arugula salad and corn soup for apps (sweetness of the corn and freshness of the arugula were real standouts), seared bison and the salmon for entrees, and the chocolate cake and cherry dish for dessert.  Overall the food was good and you could happily tell the restaurant emphasizes local product, but we both found the meal way too salty.  It's one thing to order a salty dish but we felt the high amount of salt in almost everything began to overwhelm the meal and the other flavors.  The butter that accompanied the bread had added salt crystals on top, my gin martini had a fully salted rim, the sear on the bison tasted only like salt and the greens and mushrooms accompanying the bison and the salmon tasted like pure salt.  I happen to really like salt but this amount was excessive even for me.  We also thought the cherry dish was too uniformly candy sweet in flavor and could have used some acid, or maybe tart cherries (as opposed to sweet).   We will return but will hope for a little more balance on seasoning next time!",0.9964,0.778,0.208,0.014,0.556153846153846

The NY steak was cooked just as I had ordered it (medium rare). Her halibut was perfectly seasoned. The waiters were on top of their game in being sure to refill our water glasses and asking if we wanted another glass of wine. The ambiance was great as well. A nice intimate environment.

2011-09-04,2.0,"Rave reviews and host of an Obama event this past April...I really wanted to like it.  Best points: The restaurant itself is unpretentious and relaxed, even if qualified as an upscale place. Service is great, though a bit rushed, and desserts are unique and tasty. Downsides: nearly every entree was immemorable and/or unimpressive. Sad! For the price point, consensus for the group was that it wasn't worth it.  Appetizers: we had the oysters (the best appetizer on the menu)--mignonette was delicious. The two other appetizers we had, gnocchi and tuna tartare, weren't bad but nothing I'd ever order again.  Entrees: I ordered whitefish/lobster. The lobster was very tasty, but the fish and beurre blanc bland. I was also able to try the salmon and veal entrees (both grilled over charcoal); the salmon was especially disappointing, although the veal was good, albeit too heavy on the salt. Didn't try the tuna, but the person in our party that ordered it seemed to enjoy it. On the special/seasonal menu there was also a bison plate, which was lean and decent in flavor but after a few bites not compelling enough for anyone to finish. BEST thing on the menu? Those truffle fries. We had 2 orders and finished every last bit. Desserts were yummy. Went with ""that's just peachy"" (cake was really good), ""it's da bombe"" (tart raspberry ice cream, mm), and ""sunny and blue"" (can't remember much about this one, unfortunately, though it was good).

We look ridiculous, but the waiters and servers don't care and seem to love us even more. Everyone in the restaurant was wearing beautiful clothes, and the ladies next to us had Nicole Miller bags if that says anything.  Now on to the food: we had sugar-cubed sized pieces of watermelon with feta cheese and jalepenos for a complimentary dish before the appetizer. Appetizer: gnocchi with spinach, and a sunny side egg on top. This may have been our favorite dish. We literally licked it clean with our fingers and with the complimentary bread which is DELICIOUS especially the medium brown one. The square piece of bread was pretty gnarly, it just had too much salt. Entree: We split every dish because we were on a budget. It was still big enough split amongst us! We had the snapper with sea beans and white asparagus with green sauce. Spectacular. Dessert: Cake and shake. The chocolate cake with gooey chocolate in the middle was to die for, but the frosting was just okay. The cute milkshakes (vanilla) were the best goddamn milkshakes I have ever had.  For a complimentary post-dessert dish, the pastry chef gave us two small strawberry puree jelly things. Loved them..

Don't expect calamari - this is the real deal.  We also shared some of the ravioli, gnocchi, and scallops - all were tremendous! For the main course, the waiter recommended the seared ahi tuna - stating it had been on the menu for years.  I have to be honest - it was okay - not great, not bad, just okay.  Nothing special - I would recommend going in a different direction. Finally - desserts!  We tried quite a few - and I can say that these were awesome.  I would highly recommend the cake and shake (literally comes with a mini vanilla milk shake).   MK is a good high-end restaurant that is worth a visit, but it is not going to blow you away.  That being said, you will leave feeling full, happy, and glad you tried it out.

As it was our first time at MK, our server, Leslie, went over the menu with us and highlighted a few items that she felt were the best. We decided to trust her advice and she did not steer us wrong. Drinks: We arrived early and had a round of cocktails at the bar as our table was being prepared. My wife selected cucumber martini which was delicious and a great way to kick of the meal; we will have to try to create this concoction at home it was so good!  Appetizers: I had the octopus which was very uniquely prepared; in the past I have found octopus dishes to fall short of expectation and have too much of a rubbery consistency but the way they marinade and prepare the octopus it is actually tender and full of flavor; I was able to cut it with my fork. My wife went with the goat cheese ravioli which also were outstanding. Entrees: I had the veal chop which was very good, but nothing extraordinary. My wife went with the tuna dish which was excellent; I had a few tastes and may opt for that dish next time. It was cooked perfectly; just seared a tad on the outside and raw in the middle. I really enjoyed the accompaniments to both dishes as well, but my wife found the red wine reduction a bit to sweet for her palate. We shared the pomme frites with truffle sauce which were heavenly. Those alone are worth going back for. Desserts: We started out with a cheese course (you pick as many as you want from a menu for several cheeses). We tried a couple and both were quite nice (Midnight Moon and Pleasant Ridge). We then both had the Banana dessert which IMHO was one of the best desserts I have had.  I am not a chocolate sauce person and requested caramel sauce instead and they happily obliged. I definitely will do this same dessert next time. The desserts all had fun names as well.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and is attractively decorated.

They make their own sparkling water at the restaurant that was very enjoyable and refreshing.

Gracious without hovering, efficient and smooth. We marveled repeatedly at the competence and flow of the entire staff that night. The food: superb. Shared the arugula salad and a crab special to start. The salad was perfection. I never say that about a salad - but it was a hang from the rooftops kind of salad, the kind I envision people might beat their chests over in a different time. The crab...succulent and dressed beautifully with microgreens. My dining companion had a food allergy and the kitchen recrafted a dish specifically for her, taking her needs into consideration. This after careful deliberation in the kitchen, per Erick and Sergio, and an equally careful explanation tableside. We very much appreciated the thoughtfulness put into the preparation of our meal. Followed our starters with the whitefish/lobster combo and the off menu filet...both in ample portions (neither of us could finish) and bursting with flavor. Really amazing presentations on the plate and delivery, both. We lingered over our dinner and then ordered the cake & shake for dessert. Best pint sized - or otherwise - vanilla milkshake I've ever had coupled with a decadent multi layered/flavored cake. Finished off our meal with a glass of moscato, savoring our dining experience.

Food arrived on time and dishes were cleared immediately. We wanted for nothing.  After our server's strong recommendation, we started with the octopus appetizer. We indicated we'd be splitting it, and without our asking, it arrived split onto two plates for ease. The grilled octopus was, indeed, quite good (though, admittedly, I'm not sure what could be done to an octopus to make me dislike it).  For my main course, I had the tuna dish. I'd selected it shortly after being seated and was happy to learn it was one of our server's favorite dishes. The chef generally prepares it rare, but I was able to get mine medium rare. The peppercorn crusted fish was served atop a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, spinach, and red wine sauce. It was perfectly done - the crunchy peppercorns the perfect complement to the tender fish.  I must pause to note that the portions were enormous. I know it's a common cliche that nice restaurants serve elfin portions. Not so at MK. I had all the tuna I could possibly eat, shared some with Boyfriend, and still had some remaining on my plate. On top of all that, we'd ordered the fries (they are served with truffle cream - one should never turn down something served with truffle cream). I could not. stop. eating.

We were brought complimentary butternut ravioli which were amazingly cinnamon-y and melted in your mouth. I honestly think the pomme frites were just OK, a bit dry. The whitefish w/lobster was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I thought that a combined entree w/2 proteins would mean less of each protein, but it was really more like eating 2 entrees. My boyfriend loved his roasted chicken which was also a generous portion. We had 2 waitresses tag-teaming the crap out of our table, anticipating every need. We barely had room for dessert...but ordered 2. My bf claims that the milkshake in the ""cake and shake"" was one of the best milkshakes he's ever had (and he looooves milkshakes :).

2011-04-21,5.0,"A meal fit for the leader of the free world, or simply a happy couple celebrating 11 years together.  Last weekend we celebrated our anniversary at one of our favorite restaurants in town, MK. It's probably been a few years since we had dined here and we were glad to be back.  I really like the layout of this establishment. There is a nice bar/lounge area up front. Tables don't seem too packed together. They have a great private dining room for special events. We always request and get a table upstairs where it is a little more romantic and quiet.  We were greeted with a ""Happy Anniversary"" by the host and taken to a great table up top. We were presented with personalized menus and off we went. The menu hadn't changed much since our last visit. There were some new seasonal options. I've got no problems with that as they have more than enough to choose from and everything is perfectly prepared. We shared a few appetizers to start, the crab salad and the arugula salad. King crab is so fantastic and that dish probably had at least an entire leg of crab in it. The arugula salad was peppery goodness of baby arugula, shaved fennel, pine nuts, Humboldt fog goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette. We loved that goat cheese and it was an excellent salad. For our entrees, my wife got the tuna that she always gets here and I passed on the tempting duck to have the venison. My wife's dish was peppercorn crusted yellowfin tuna seared red, spinach, shitake mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes and red wine syrup. It was a huge piece of fish, seared well and blood red. I got to try a lot of it and it was outstanding. My venison was a farm raised loin, served with buttered cabbage, red onion jam and anise reduction. Again, a large portion of probably seven to eight slices. I loved it and had no regrets with my choice. Our bottle of California Pinot Noir nicely complemented our dinner and was paced well throughout. We decided against stuffing ourselves with their sinfully good pomme frites in favor of dessert. I'm glad we did. This may be the best dessert menu I've ever seen. Everything looked so very good, we couldn't choose just one. So, we had Bert's waffles-warm sourdough waffle, maker's mark caramel, vanilla-bourbon spiked pineapple, pineapple mousse, hickory nut praline and brown butter ice cream as well as the two bananas walk into a bar-banana souffle cake, toasted marshmallow fluff, macadamia nut crumble, dark chocolate sauce and malted banana ice cream. See why we had problems? They were both every bit as amazing as they sound. You're going to want to save room for dessert. We made short work of both of them while sipping on coffee.  Just about that time they showed up with flutes of champagne for us and again thanked us for celebrating at their restaurant. That leads me to the service, which was spot on and flawless. It was such a nice and unexpected touch. They made us feel special on our big night and I guess that was just what I was looking for. And get this, our waiter even shaked my hand on the way out and the host again congratulated us. The front of house execution matched the stellar work of the kitchen, nicely done MK.

The dining room is cool... it is in this old building with a upstairs loft like place, just a really cool building that has a little character. It is not snooty inside, nor were the servers. I will have to say it is pretty upscale in the prices and the quality of food. We went there for Chicago Chef week where there was a prix fixed meal for $33. That was quite a deal considering that most of their entrees were at minimum $33. I however opted to order from the main menu since I didn't really need a dessert or an extra appetizer that night. The choices were a little limiting, but the others in my party seemed to enjoy them. I ordered a fish/lobster dish that was fabulous. And of course I had to try the pomme frites with truffle sauce... so delicious! i could have just eaten that all night. I definitely would go back to MK if I had a little extra cash handy.

Four of us went for Chef's Week and were greeted by a very polite hostess, and then got some assistance ordering our drinks at the bar from the helpful bartender there. Good start. Heck, even before that, when you walk in you'll notice how beautiful the interior is. This is one of the nicest looking restaurants I've ever been in, especially the balcony area. The food and the waiter were both disappointments. Our waiter wasn't rude, but he never smiled, always seemed rushed, and just didn't seem to care that we were there. We all got the Escolar (super white tuna, olives, lemon, etc.) appetizer which was exceptional. The fish was extremely fresh, and the flavors were all just powerful enough. Our main dishes were a letdown. Most of us got the Veal, and, well, it was okay. Don't get me wrong, the cut of meat was excellent, and it was very well cooked, but that was it. I could have headed down to Paulina Meat Market and cooked up this veal myself, and I possess only a very basic culinary ability. There just wasn't much done to enhance the flavor or dress it up with a decent sauce or side. For dessert, they had a chocolate brownie that was pretty hard and dry. Not a good way to end the meal. On the upside, the wine pairings were all excellent, especially the dessert wine which was a sparkling muscato that wasn't overpoweringly sweet. MK isn't bad by any measure, but nothing really impressed me. It was just okay, and that's why I think three starts suits it perfectly.",0.9919,0.728,0.204,0.068,0.6250375375375377
2011-04-03,5.0,"Terrific food, fabulous service, big space. A best-in-Chicago-list appetizer - the grilled baby octopus.  The grilled baby octopus is a regular on the menu, so you can expect to be able to order it. And you should. Baby octopus has a unique texture. When it's tender and grilled, it's at its best. At MK, they do a dry rub with some spices that perfectly add to the octopus. If you enjoy seafood, this will be a memorable dish.  The pommes frites are good, and the truffle oil dip on the side allows you to only have as much truffle oil as you want. Great strategy.  The wine list is long, with few bargains. That no doubt reflects the clientele - more suits in here on a Wednesday evening that I've seen in years. MK is a major client entertainment spot, as it should be.  I also had a Mediterranean sea bass that was excellent only because of the preparation. Served whole and not overcooked, this rather ordinary fish tasted like I was at a table by the oceanside. Straightforward but creative side vegetables added well to the dish.  The service has to be commented on. It was excellent. One item I was considering I was warned off of because the preparation wasn't what I liked. The waiter bothered to ask and saved me. All through the meal our conversation with the waiter was engaging and food oriented. The manager stopped by too.

While presentation was great in a glass lined with paper, the fries quickly turned soggy with accumulated condensation. The salad was fresh and not over-dressed, loved the contrast of sweet beets and peppery arugula. The skate was cooked perfectly but I found it a tad salty and greasy (and I love skate!).

2011-03-28,4.0,"MK has been pretty high on the list recently so I was glad when we called at 7:30 and the hostess on the other side confirmed that they could take us at 8.  Maybe it was because the place has been open for 12 years and it's no longer on the 'hot' list.  Plus, it's not like it was a Friday or Saturday night.  I actually prefer to dine out on a Wednesday or Thursday night.  Way less people to deal with and I don't have to feel like they're waiting for me to get up so they can turn my table.  (People who are oblivious to this make me nuts.)  I like to take my time at a restaurant.  I'm totally that 3 hr diner. Anyway, on to the point.  Dinner was lovely.  There were a couple of items that were out of this world and a couple that were good but didn't strike us as incredible. I'd say the scallop appetizer falls closer to the former category than to the latter.  I don't know that I've ever seen a sear quite this beautiful on a scallop before.  The interesting part was that it was seared only on one side, but the deep golden brown crispiness ran halfway down the side of the delicate meat.  The inside was melty at rare.  In fact, my eating partner was almost a little put off with its rareness, since a med-rare temp is on that he's come to expect as 'correct'.  For me it was perfectly done.  The caramelization was there, the texture was there and the flavor was there.  It left nothing to be desired.  Its accompaniments were secondary to me as it was difficult to get past the perfection of the bi-valve itself. Next was the fluke with Brussels sprouts, beets and bacon butter sauce.  Yes, you read that correctly... bacon butter sauce.  Now, normally I would put such a sauce into the 'cheater food' category but I think I must make an exception here.  It was rich and deep, as to be expected, but it was also bright and round, making it more than the addition of fat for flavor.  And it was not over used.  Only a reasonable smear on the plate allowed for its addition on our terms, when and where we wanted it.  It played its role well by enhancing the fish's own flavor, rather than overwhelming it.  I did wonder about one component on the plate, though.   Why were the red beets were cut into a small dice while the yellow ones were large diced?  Maybe just to entertain the eye?  I'm not sure, but who am I to question someone else's artistic creation when it did not harm to the dish.  Overall, a very satisfying, nice dish.   I think that with such a strong start and generally high expectations of the restaurant in general, we were expecting to be wowed by every dish.  And with the veal porterhouse, we just weren't.  I mean, it was good, just not dance-in-your-seat good.  It was clearly executed properly:  again, good, solid sear and a perfect medium rare.  Its broccoli rabe accompaniment was a no-frills, true expression of the leafy vegetable.  Its peppery-ness was uncompromised by other ingredients and its pleasant tenderness told that it was cooked just beyond the simple blanching that its bright green color suggested.  And, unfortunately, the aged balsamic sauce lacked a depth and roundness.  It seemed thin and just didn't do it for me.   The third item on the table at that moment, however, REALLY did it for me.  That was the order of fries with truffle dipping sauce.  Wowza!  Incredible.  Perfectly crispy on the outside, they were tender and meaty inside.  And that little ramekin of heaven sitting next to them was no ordinary truffle aioli.  This was looser that I expected from an aioli, so much so, that I assumed it was a hollandaise base.  When I inquired to the captain, he informed me that it was, in fact, made with oil rather than butter.  Not that that determines its consistency, just that we've been conditioned to assume that an aioli is tighter than a hollandaise, and I suppose that technically, it is.  But one can stop adding oil to an egg yolk whenever one wants, making for a looser textured mayo.  I have a hard time believing that there was no butter at all in that pool of lusciousness, though, but either way, who cares?  It was amazing. And maybe you can imagine my excitement, stuffed as I was, when I returned from the restroom to find that our table had been marked for dessert.  That sweet man had ordered us something sweet!  My favorite part of cake and shake was definitely the shake.  This was no ordinary vanilla milkshake.  It had so much true vanilla bean flavor that I had to keep going back for more in an attempt to understand it.  I would have been happy if that was the only thing in front of me even though the multi-layered chocolate cake was certainly nothing to scoff at. Everyone at MK was so friendly, from the Valet driver, to the manager.  It seemed like each person went out of his or her way to be kind, but in a very genuine way.  Technically, the service was very good, although if I wanted to nit-pick, I could, but I don't because of all of the lovely people who were involved....",0.9994,0.774,0.179,0.046,0.5661129654353951

Given the near-flawless reviews of service at mk, I was really surprised by this. I did appreciate the meticulous attention to food allergies (I have a bad peanut allergy so it was nice to have them ask vs. have to go out of my way to explain it). The food here was delicious, but the portions for chef week were very, very small. Though I suppose when you're eating at a restaurant that is typically $100 per person without alcohol, a small $33 three-course meal is understandable. Regardless, the point is: if you have a huge appetite, don't eat here for chef week because you definitely won't be sated. Go with the full-sized portions. I ordered the escolar, the skatewing and the chocolate brownie. Again, delicious, but I was done with each plate in under 5 minutes. People-watching is superb here, and reservations are a must!

I've had fantastic truffle fries at Rockit Bar and other places.  Our service at MK was a little spotty, maybe it was just that there were too many servers filling in for our main server. We saw our main server a few times but other servers kept stopping by to take multiple drink orders. Shouldn't they each be in charge of once aspect? Service wasn't bad it was just jarring. The food was good. I had a chicken dish with a great sauce and my husband had fish that he enjoyed.

2011-03-27,2.0,"Hm. Came here on a Saturday night expecting great things, but was left somewhat wondering.  Restaurant was crowded by ~7pm, and the ambiance of the dining room changed as the evening settled in (we arrived early for a 6:30 reservation and there was plenty of sunlight from the ceiling windows - by 7:30 it was dark and romantic inside).  We ordered 1 chef's menu (hamachi/sushi type appetizer; veal and spinach entree; and brownie dessert), and also ordered a la carte the grilled octopus, and whitefish & lobster main.  Amuse bouche courtesy of the kitchen was a cooked codfish randade (think the spanish tapas made into a warm spread for toast).  The veal came out super salty and we actually sent back - the 2nd however was only a tad less salty but came out well done (when we had ordered medium).  Staff was super nice and we just let it go.  Whitefish & lobster was well cooked however nothing extraordinary.  They were nice enough to comp us the cake & shake dessert (buttercream chocolate cake and malted vanilla shake).  Staff was super nice, however having 4 wait staff (2 main servers, the maitre d, and the water guy who was nonstop) was a bit overwhelming for what should have been a pleasant and relaxing dinner.  Also, timing could have been better as they served us our entrees literally 2 seconds after clearing our appetizers.  Understand it was a busy night however would have appreciated a little break between courses.",0.9966,0.761,0.231,0.007,0.5089285714285714

Flavor and service are obvious top priorities at MK.  Each course introduced combinations that bordered classic and contemporary.  A play on hamachi sashimi, for example, was garnished with what I can only describe as fried olives and garlic: a seemingly simple profile yet one delivered with a sophisticated hand.        Our server mentioned that he's been with MK for 12 of its 13 years in business.  The knowledge and care that he took with our experience easily support his tenure.  Our conversation never felt forced or stuffy, and his presence at the table perfectly balanced our needs.                 As for other reviewer comments on prices, it makes me happy to know that I will reserve MK for special occasions.",0.985,0.765,0.202,0.032,0.5300099206349206
2011-03-24,4.0,"MK is one of my favorite restaurants and tends to be my first choice for celebrations/special occasions. While the contemporary American food is excellent, the hospitality and customer service are outstanding. When making a reservation, if you tell them you are celebrating a special event, they'll print a message at the top of the menu: happy birthday, congratulations, etc. It's little details like that which elevate the dining experience at MK from fantastic to phenomenal. The service every time has been wonderful. The servers are knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.  The bussers are on top of everything as well. Not to be overshadowed, the food is delicious. The cuisine is new American but not as progressive or cutting edge as places like Blackbird or Girl & the Goat. Not so intellectual nor difficult to grasp your mind around. The highlights at MK for me are the appetizers and the desserts. I recommend the seared scallops or grilled octopus appetizers. The signature banana dessert is awesome. Although you might not think to order fries at this type of restaurant, I highly suggest giving them a try. They're fried in beef fat and served with truffle cream. Fresh, hot, crispy outside, tender inside. My favorite fries in the city. Request a table on the second level. Sorta fun to observe the dining scene from above. Tables are well-spaced so you aren't sharing your meal with your neighbors. The noise level is conversation friendly, which makes MK a nice choice for a date or reunion with longtime friends. Furthermore, the atmosphere is relaxed and you don't get the sense that your server is trying to turn your table for the next guests. The crowd seems to be late 20s through 40s. Business casual attire. Free parking on Franklin Street right across from the restaurant and in other random portions of nearby streets. Highly recommend.",0.9976,0.738,0.248,0.014,0.564837926301341
2011-03-24,5.0,"I visited MK again for dinner this week and had to update my review. This is definitely a 5-star restaurant.  I visited with a work group for a celebration dinner.  We were seated on the second level in our own little area.  The table was beautiful, the restaurant was beautiful.  The room is cozy and warm with exposed beams, crisp white tableclothes and a nice combination of tables around the restaurant.  I especially like the second level, but seating in the main area is also nice.  Atmosphere is a 5. The food was phenomenal!  We had a salmon amuse bouche that was really delicious.  Then, the table had oysters, the ravioli, scallops and tuna tartare.  Everything was really flavorful, beautifully presented and I could have eaten a ton of all of these items.  For dinner, I had the whitefish and lobster - so delicious (though, one bit of lobster was a little chewy...).  All in all, though, the fish was delicious, high quality, and a good sized portion (not too big, not too small).  Everyone polished off their entrees, so I'm guessing, like me, they would give the food a 5. For value, this is a pricey restaurant.  They are participating in chef's week, though we did not participate in this.  Entrees are in the $30-$40 range.  However, they were all high quality and delicious.  The wine list is pretty expensive, with everything over $10.  Overall, for this, while it is a high-end restaurant, I feel value skews a bit expensive, so a 4 for value. Service is top notch.  We never had to wait for water refills and our food and drinks came out prefectly spaced.  Everyone was extremely nice and helpful with the menu.  When I went to the restroom, they walked me there since it was downstairs and a bit to the side.  I thought this was a nice touch, though I usually don't need to be escorted to the restroom.  Service is definitely a 5.  I feel like everything ran so smoothly that the service must have been flawless. Bathrooms were clean, large, and nicely appointed.  The bathroom fit the feel of the restaurant - a 5. I would definitely return assuming my budget allows!",0.9988,0.737,0.26,0.003,0.6286038961038959

Our entire evening was very nice at MK.  We had a party of 8, and everyone enjoyed their food.  We tried a few apps, and they all were great.  No real standouts, but everything was good.  I suppose my favorite was the tuna.  The cheese plate was also very nice, but the raisin toast with it was a turn off, so I rocked the regular bread. Other than that, their Pomme Frites were very tasty, and the truffle cream was nice and not overpowering.

The food is great - it is not pretentious, it is not ordinary, it is not overly expensive and offers just the right amount of up-scale flair at an affordable price to be the perfect option for both business outings as well as for a date night.

From start to finish, a complete attention to detail is truly obvious with this operation.  From the phone calls, to the arrival, to dinner and service, to speaking with the chef post meal.  The chef summed it up at the end of the night; ""We're here to provide for you, the guest.  Let's say you don't like something.  My question shouldn't be 'Can I get you something else?' Instead, how about 'Can I do something differently so that you'll like it.""  If you notice, it's slightly different, but makes all the difference in the world.  It's saying ""Sure, I'll cook that steak well done if you want it, you paid for it, and I want you to enjoy"" and while this is possibly a bad example, it sums it up.  He used the example of a sauted dish, and while everyone raves about it, if you want it grilled or fried, why should he tell you no?  However, what I find, is someone like this is typically their own most critical judge, and if you let them do it how they like, you're golden!  Get a good product, prepare it well and to your customer's liking and give great, inviting service, and people will support you.

2011-01-08,5.0,"How refreshing... A restaurant that doesn't fit the Gastro-Pub, Molecular Gastronomy, Steakhouse, Mexican Hipster genres that have swept this country's dining scene. There was a time when restaurants were simply the dreams of a couple madly passionate about food and service. One worked the stove while the other charmed the guests. Restaurant MK is such a place. And what a lovely place it is. The restaurant is located on a very quiet street. The surrounding landscape feels industrial even though it is not. This provides a really nice contrast for the restaurant which has very dramatic windows which invite the curious in for a closer look. I have wanted to dine here for nearly two years and I finally did. I was impressed by the warm and knowledgeable staff. The food is straightforward but very well executed. I recommend arriving early for a drink at the bar. It will give you an opportunity to appreciate the beautiful city behind those magnificently grand windows that line the front of the restaurant. The actual dining room is open and airy. The space has the appeal of a big city loft. The lighting is good and the dining room has staggered levels which makes for clandestine people watching. I ordered the Seared Foie Gras with spiced Kuri Squash and port Grilled Bison with heirloom carrots and pommery mustard My gf ordered the Ricotta gnocchi with kale, bacon, and parmiggiano cheese Prime NY Strip with trumpet royale mushrooms and red wine sauce The food was absolutely delicious and 100% everything you anticipate savouring.  I think the beauty here is that the food and service reflects a very pure devotion to simplicity and perfection.  At the end of the meal, the owner (Chef MK's wife) graciously thanked our party for dining. Again, this type of appreciation from an owner is such a refreshing experience. From start to finish, this was a very positive experience and my gf and I cannot wait to go back.",0.9982,0.746,0.244,0.009,0.5842293060474879

2010-11-03,4.0,"Your 3 line review: Food was amazing and well refined.  Service was great.  Price was a little high for the overall experience. Everything Else: Let me stress that if you don't mind throwing an extra $50 at a meal this place is probably a 5-star for you because the food is still REALLY REALLY GOOD.  The drinks were amazing and the service was probably the best I have received in Chicago.  The space is laid out to make every table feel special and the decor is amazing. The seasonal specials were excellent and everything was artfully prepared with a level of refinement that was refreshing and kept any course from bogging down the meal.  Amazingly fresh and tasty food throughout the meal.  The only let downs were the two things that came highly recommened; the octopus (ap) and the frites (side). Octopus - nearly void of flavor, though well prepared and beautiful, I was not impressed with the flavor which did not absorb into the dish. Frites - no better than most hot dog stands; and the truffle cream was just too much for me.  I was hoping for more balance with the taste of the fry itself as opposed to it just being a vessel for the cream. The sweets were amazing and the four of us split three and were upset we didn't have room to try more.  The infused ice creams (all of them) were worth every bite.  And if nothing else, we will be back to MK to get drinks and dessert if not another meal. So why lose the 5th star - comes down to this.  Last time I paid this much for food I had nothing (literally not a thing) bad to say about any part of the experience.  When it comes to this level and price of dining - there is just a higher standard to be met. Additional Highlights: Service and consideration of all guests is held so high here that even after one in our party finished 1/2 his drink, the waitress could sense he did not want to finish and brought him another of his choosing on the house.  Similarly when half of us ordered desserts pared with wine, the servers brought complimentary wine for the other diners in our group.  This is the kind of thing that makes me forget about the cost of my meal - there is no price you can put on this kind of service.

2010-10-27,2.0,"Two and a  half yelp stars. Dined at MK last night for a birthday dinner. The restaurant itself is nice and cozy. They have an upstairs dining area which allows you to look out into the entire restaurant. The bar is right at the entrance of the restaurant and is set up with lounge chairs and tables.  We started with the tuna (their version of tuna tartare), gnocchi, pasta (house made noodles with mushrooms), and octopus. My favorite out of the four was the octopus... everything else tasted fine but there was nothing spectacular about them, any of them.  For our entrees: Out of us 6 girls, 2 ordered the ny strip, one ordered the duck, one ordered the salmon, and I ordered the veal (based on our server... that was her favorite dish). Sadly, my favorite was not my own dish but the ny strip. I actually barely touched my own dish because it was just okay. I really enjoyed the NY strip... It was very flavorful and you really get the taste of the hard wood charcoal. I also enjoyed the duck.. it was a good size and perfectly cooked. The salmon and the chicken tasted fine but again, nothing special. We also ordered the pommes frites with the truffle cream but they were just okay. The fries were actually kind of soggy and cold. Given that there are so many restaurants nowadays that are known for their pommes frites, I would say to skip ordering the pommes frites from MK (just a waste of calories).  Then dessert! Six girls at dinner.. we have to order dessert! Because it was a birthday dinner, they were nice enough to send out a free ""cake and shake"" dessert for the bday girl and free shakes for all of us at the table. We also ordered the ""two bananas walk into a bar"" and ""a pumpkin named pierre"". My favorite of the three was the ""two bananas walk into a bar""! If you like bananas and smores, this will be a good pick! The banana soufflé melted in my mouth and the toasted marshmallow fluff with the chocolate sauce was delicious!  The pumpkin dessert was too much pumpkin for my liking. cake and shake was a good classic chocolate cake and ice cream twist.  They also have pretty good wine list with some that are very decently priced. We were able to order a bottle of the J Brut Rose for around $50 and a bottle of Groth Sauvignon Blanc for about $60. Not bad prices for the type of restaurant it is.  Overall - Given that they're contending with some heavy hitting restaurants in Chicago, I had  my expectations set pretty high. The food is okay... there's nothing that was horrible or bad but there was nothing that really impressed me. For the price tag of about $120/person, I would expect the food to be better. They're trying to play with some big players out in the restaurant world with the type of menu they offer and there's just so many restaurants out there with amazing food for that price point. The service was great and there was nothing wrong with anything, but I would rather spend the $120 at another establishment with more memorable food.

There about 4 other couples sitting around the lounge area also waiting to be seated. They all probably also had a 5:30pm reservation like we did. All the tables looked like they were all ready for prime time but I guess MK wanted the clock to strike 5:30pm before they officially ""open up"" the restaurant. To start off the night, we shared a bottle of Bourdeaux and our server poured the wine into a decanter for us. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He was very familiar with the menu and was confident in describing the menu as well as offering suggestions. There was a prawns dish on special and our server said it is prepared medium rare. My fiance asked if it could be prepared rare (he loves rare shrimps especially on sushi nights elsewhere) and our server went to check with the chef if that could be done. Minutes later he returned and said that to be on the safe side, medium rare was what they could do. We appreciate how helpful he was. We told our server we wanted to order several items and share them. He said ""You can do whatever you want"" gave a little laugh and continued ""... except for the prawns"". We started off with half a dozen of oysters and the surf and turf appetizer. The surf and turf has a fantastic and creative spin to it. Move over, boring surf and turf. MK's version for the win. The turf portion was beef carpaccio the surf portion was cured salmon. We also ordered the prosciutto with summer melon and our server said he would split the servings up into two plates for us. Now on to the main courses. We had the oven roasted whole fish with the head and tail included but the fish was deboned. As recommended by our server, we also had the lamb rack which came with 4 lamb chops done medium rare. The lamb was extremely tender and we loved every bit of it. Because the lamb came with some fat too which we didn't eat, the portion ended up being just nice especially when we still had the whole fish to devour. We had so much food and we were getting very full. I'm not sure what happened but for dessert I had the entire Two Bananas to myself. On the menu it sounded so good that I decided I wasn't sharing no matter how full I was. Ok, to be fair, I did ask my fiance if he wanted to share but since he isn't much of a dessert person, he ordered two selections of cheeses to go with the remaining wine he had. My dessert was phenomenal and I went bananas (literally): Banana malt ice cream and banana souffle cake, accompanied with a charred marshmallow and a few drops of chocolate sauce on the plate for embellishment. The cake was light and spongy, almost like a chiffon cake. I think that was the best thing that happened to me that night. Oh yes, and we still had room for espresso drinks. Yup, I'm not embarrassed to say this: we live to eat.",0.9987,0.807,0.176,0.017,0.5814302248677249

Personally, we didn't really get the hype.  The food was good, but it wasn't amazing, like we were expecting.  Perhaps reading the Yelp reviews set a high bar which we were sadly never able to overcome. We ordered the tasting menu, and let me forewarn you, it is VERY LIGHT.  As in, you should order other things to supplement your meal.  Which we did, because our waiter kept trying to sell us on the fries.  ""You want fries with that?"" is not really what I expect to hear from a 4 or 5-star restaurant but this is the spiel we got. Long story short, MK was an OK meal, but we won't be going there again the next time we're in Chicago.",-0.2319,0.862,0.073,0.066,0.4302083333333334

The service is amazing, the food delivers magic to your senses of taste and sight. I took my mother to Chicago for the weekend a few weeks ago and the staff at the Park Hyatt recommended the place. As you can see many others on here agree that this place ROCKS! The only thing that I don't like is the fact that I live in the Washington DC area and can't come more often. I would like to make it in on a Thursday for their ""MK hearts the Market"" Dessert and Cocktail Pairing. For $15 this is a steal!  I'm returning to MK tomorrow night and can't wait. I would recommend this place to anyone, and spoke highly of it to those at the Park Hyatt. This place would be a great setting for a special meal but is a perfect excuse to go out for any reason - It's not pretentious or stuffy.

We had dinner reservations around 5:30PM (kind of early but was on a tight schedule) and it was surprisingly empty (just a few people here and there but I guess people in Chicago don't do early dinners!!). We were seated at the top, overlooking the restaurant and our waitress was fantastic, she explained the menu to us and recommended several dishes, she was prompt and professional. For our appetizers, we had the chilled oysters, sweet alaskan king crab, and baby octopus.  The oysters? Sweet and tangy  (the sauce was addicting) and you can tell its Grade A oysters. I believe the waitress told us they were from Great Britain?  (Correct me if I'm wrong). Sweet Alaskan crab? Oh gawd, so moist and juicy. And the best was the baby octopus, you can barely even taste it , it tasted like fried sweet goodness. It was so tender and I have no idea how the chef makes it like this, its amazing!!! You gotta try one of these appetizers, it will blow you away. For my entree I had the veal and had my aspharagus replaced with mashed potatoes (yum my favorite). My veal was phenomenal! It was cooked so perfectly to my liking and the meat was very juicy in savory balsamic vinegar. I am in love with veal! My mash potatoes were soft and creamy and went well with my veal. Our table also got the pommes frites with truffle cream and yummmm, these pommes frites were so  good, not like regular fries but even better!  It was my bf's mothers birthday and at the end they brought her a piece of cake w/ice cream and it said ""Happy Birthday w/her name"". It was really sweet and I was pleased they didn't mess up or forget her name (you know how some restaurants are). The cake was so delicious! It went so well with the ice cream, omygosh I was so full from this ginormous dinner. Btw, towards the end of our dinner, this place was packed!  I would recommend this place to tourists or a Chicagoan who wants to try a new restaurant.

2010-08-16,5.0,"I've only been in Chicago for 10 days, but I've already found a restaurant I can consider a go-to for fine new American dining.  MK succeeded on all levels, from the awesome service to the amazing food.  I certainly was not expecting that much before coming here, but I'm a believe in MK now after having spent a nice two-hour dinner here. Started with the baby octopus grilled over hardwood charcoal.  This appetizer was amazing.  Octopus is a difficult thing to cook - if you overcook it even slightly, it becomes too chewy and just tastes bad.  Everything about this dish was great - it was seasoned well and you could taste the hints of wood from the way they cooked it.  The texture and chewyness was perfect.  Awesome dish. Also tried the alaskan king crab appetizer which was also delicious.  Not too salty and pairs perfectly with the avocados and jicama.  Delicious. The main course also knocked it out of the park.  Had the whitefish with lobster combo, which was seasoned in a red curry broth, which provided this seemingly American dish with a subtle hint of Thai influence.  The fish was cooked to perfection, while the lobster was just fine.  I don't even think this dish needed the lobster - the fish itself was delicious.   Also tried part of the seared tuna that is apparently a staple dish at MK.  However, my friend and I were not impressed with the tuna.  There was a bit too much pepper which took away from the flavor of the fish.  This dish was probably a bit disappointing, given the amazing appetizers and my amazing entree.  However, not bad enough to turn me away from coming back here again. The dessert was good.  At this point in the meal, I was already so full that I didn't want to eat much more, but go big or go home.  Had the ""two bananas walk into a bar"" [insert corny joke here], which included a banana souffle cake, toasted marshmallow fluff, and malted banana ice cream.  Pretty good, but you have to like bananas if you are going to enjoy this dish. Service was great.  Cute waitress, no complaints.  $90 a person with tip and tax, after one drink.  Game on.",0.9987,0.679,0.261,0.06,0.5949855699855701
2010-08-13,5.0,"This is my favorite new American/Western restaurant in Chicago.  Went here for a 9:30pm Monday dinner reservation and LUCKED OUT with free food from the kitchen. Because it was so late at night, the chef sent out free appetizers and a side dish of delicious buttery brussel sprouts, as well as some chocolate at the end of the meal.  The restaurant was a lot more casual (and smaller in size) than I had imagined. Even at 10pm on a Monday, there were a lot of diners! The talking quickly gets pretty loud if you're on the lower level.  I'm not a fries person but the MK truffel fries is truly memorable. Even without the truffel dip, the fries itself is nice and crisp on the outside, soft 'n steamy on the inside, salted to perfection. Mmmm My main was white fish with lobster. It was quite a decent portion size (large) and I devoured the entire thing. I shared a bite of lobster with my date and we both thought it was delicious. I'm glad that MK's food isn't stuffy old classic American food - the kind you get served at at all the OTHER restaurants. They take a dish for a spin, but not too much, and everything on your plate is cooked to perfection.  Obviously, service is impecable. Swift, attentive....all of it. The only downside I suppose it the price-tag. For an ALL OUT dinner for 2 (but with no alcohol), we spent $150 including tax and tip. But I was so full I couldn't move by the end of the meal.

My manager and I decided to start our experience with some cocktails, while we waited for our boss to complete a telephone conversation.  My specialty martini was referred to as MK's 10 Year Anniversary Cocktail, which contained a refreshing mix of Belvedere Vodka, St. Germain liquor, grapefruit juice, and mint.  The sweet nectar kicked off the evening, which later progressed through a haze of decadent barolos and amarones, courtesy of my extravagant boss.  We attempted to balance our alcohol consumption with snacks pulled from the diverse bread basket, which included white rolls, slices of wheat dough, and crisp pita chips. We then began our comprehensive meal, starting mine with a Baby Octopus appetizer.  The tasty tentacles were charcoal-grilled and served with braised peppers and leeks, all topped off with a drizzle of olive oil.  I then enjoyed my entree of pan-seared Arctic Char, which was accompanied by a Mediterranean blend of artichokes, cippolini onions, a kalamata olive tapenade, citrus oil, and parsley.  My boss' Yellowfin Tuna was massive, but the portion was disproportionate to the lack of flavor provided by the fish.  Though it was crusted with peppercorns and topped with a red wine glaze, it remained rather bland.  The dish also included spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and garlic mashed potatoes, which were well-chosen compliments.  My manager's Prime New York Sirloin was the best of the bunch with its perfect grilling, coating of red wine syrup, and earthy sides of sugar snap peas and oyster mushrooms.  The three of us also decided to sample some additional accompaniments, such as the hearty blend of ramps, peas, fava beans, and Pecorino Romano.  Our other side dish consisted of sautéed seasonal mushrooms and balsamic-braised pearl onions.  Though we were all reasonably satisfied and enjoyed our meals, we agreed that each dish had been served at room temperature rather than warm.  This fact tarnished our impressions and left us with mixed feelings.  We felt that MK had all of the makings of a fabulous fine dining restaurant - an interesting menu, beautiful decor, etc. - but needed to be more polished in order to achieve its full potential.",0.9937,0.87,0.116,0.014,0.5068985776128633

We got the 6-course tasting menu featuring prosciutto, mushrooms, rouge, bison, cheese, and chocolate. I can't pick a favorite. Great flavor combinations, beautiful presentation, and everything was made with perfectly-cooked, fresh ingredients. I was really hungry, so I managed to eat everything, but my friend had some trouble near the end. We had a lot of food between the tasting menu, the truffle fries (spectacular btw), and the asparagus (compliments of the chef). Service was also top-notch. I was impressed with how well Julio timed his visits to our table, and I also can't complain about the 3 extra wine tastings he poured us to complement the different courses. He suggested that next time, we get the wine pairings with the tasting, so I'll definitely have to do that whenever I find a couple hundred bucks lying around. The decor is also nice.

Service Or server was so friendly and down to earth I wanted to invite her to sit with us for the rest of the meal!  The manager also visited each of the tables and invited us back in the future in a sincere manner.  Decor The ambiance is what first hit me in the restaurant - i love the urban loft feel that is clean and elegant, but also relaxed.  We were seated in a booth in the balcony/loft which gave us a nice view of the rest of the restaurant.  This would be an incredible space for a wedding in the colder months of Chicago.",0.9886,0.845,0.155,0.0,0.5115740740740741

2010-05-15,5.0,"I'd first been to MK back in 2001 on company dime...but it looked new to me when walking in.  I loved the setup of the restaurant, the high open ceiling space, wooden beams, especially the greenhouse-like glass ceilings.  Just very spacious and airy and comfortable.  The restaurant was bustling, slightly on the loud side but not terrible. Service The sommelier seemed a bit stiff (but aren't they all?) initially, but ultimately recommended some excellent wines for the table, including a great Melville pinot noir.  Our server was very cheery and happy, made us feel very welcome. The Menu and Food Not particularly extensive...and on first glance, all the typical ""New American"" type dishes are there - couple of fish, pork, chicken, various steaks cuts.  But the food is nice!  I had bites of both the bison (available as a standalone item from the tasting menu) and veal and both were delicious.  My whitefish/lobster combo had a very generous portion of fish with wonderful texture plunged in a spicy, almost coconut curry flavor sauce.  The lobster was probably more like the size of a prawn, but was a nice mix with the fish and I couldn't complain about the price ($32).  Only after the fact did I read on yelp that the baby octopus was a signature dish - eat it!  It's got a nice smoky taste from being cooked on a charcoal grill .  The pomme frites were nice too...NYC quality with a heavenly truffle cream.  Even the bread was great, especially the multi-grain small pieces.  Great date place, good group place, decently easy to get a reservation and street parking since it's a bit aways from River North.  I think the best part is how nice the staff is.  ""Thank you for coming"" from multiple employees as we left not only made me feel important, but more than that, gave me the feeling that they truly enjoyed having us dine at their establishment.  I'll be back with the gf.",0.9991,0.69,0.303,0.007,0.6235677530017152
2010-05-14,5.0,"My husband and I went to MK to celebrate the end of his first year of grad school... any excuse to celebrate, right?!  Reading the reviews of other Yelpers, I requested a table on the upper level.  We were seated in a corner, which I wasn't thrilled about, but it actually turned out to be great.  After weeks of husband being MIA while wrapping up his semester, it was nice to sit and talk with no one around us. While we perused the wine list, we ordered a few cocktails - I had a champagne cocktail that was infused with chartreuse and cucumber.  It was refreshing, and very tasty.  My husband had a berry mojito which was also very good. We both decided to order the Spring Tasting Menu, but our served went over the night's specials anyway.  I love hearing the specials, and they sounded so good that we ended up adding two dishes onto the tasting menu. The first course on the menu was a prosciutto salad with dressed bitter greens, pickled apricot and pistachios.  It was a great, light first course.  Then came one of our add-ons from the regular menu.  We split the red-wine marinated, grilled octopus and it was insanely good.  It was cooked perfectly - so tender and had a wonderful smokiness imparted from the grill.  When I asked about the preparation, the waitress was pretty knowledgeable and even mentioned that the recipe is on their website* The second course of the menu (technically our third course) was walleye with fava beans (love!) puree and new potatoes, which was all perfectly executed.  The next course was a single rack of lamb, served with red quinoa and green almonds, which I had never had before.  Our second add-on, the pommes frites with truffle cream, were served along with the lamb. Then our waitress offered to put together a complimentary cheese course for us.  Yes, please!  Finally, we ended our meal with a buttermilk panna cotta, valrhona dark chocolate ganache and emulsified olive oil.  I am partial to savory or not-so-sweet desserts, so this was a great course for me.  Our dinner at MK was probably one of the best I have had.  I generally find something I didn't like in the dish as far as seasoning - needs more salt, acid, etc., but each dish at MK was perfect.  Our waitress, Leslie, was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and how the dishes were prepared.  The final bill was pricey, but I actually thought that it was fair for the quantity and quality of our overall meal.  MK is the perfect spot for any special occasion or celebratory dinner! *I couldn't find the recipe on-line so I called the restaurant.  I was connected with someone who let me know that they no longer offer recipes on their website.  Boo!  She was nice enough, however, to e-mail the octopus recipe to me.  It was such a wonderful dish, and I cannot wait to try it out at home!",0.9987,0.769,0.2,0.031,0.5246999491736334

The restaurant itself is swanky,we sat in an upstairs seating area that over looks the restaurant and a skylight that made the mood even more romantic.  They used a team server approach, three different servers worked our table throughout the evening and I can't say that I minded at all. The transition was seamless between the three and the servers never questioned what dish went to whom.  We shared the pommes fritte and tuna tartare to start. They were both fantastic. Perhaps not the best mixture, but I would highly recommend both. Isn't a meal more enjoyable when you ask to split something and two plates appear, so you aren't awkwardly trying to cut the dish in half? Another point for MK.  All in all the meal was precise.

2010-04-11,5.0,"Wow! My wife took me here for my birthday this year, and the overall experience was amazing.  My flight got in to Chicago earlier than expected so we decided to go to the restaurant before our reservation. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks. I had a two Old Fashioneds - easily the best I have had. The bartender made it with Basil Haydens 8 year, bitters, raw sugar and brandi soaked cherries. Amazing! My wife had two glasses of wine that she enjoyed very much. After the drinks, we were taken to our seats. I am pretty convinced we had the best seat in the house. Top floor overlooking the entire restaurant.  Our servers were amazing. They immediately took our drink orders, recommended specials and brought us out bread with house made rock salt butter. That was followed up by a complimentary starter of salmon tartar.  My wife ordered the strip steak with oyster mushrooms and snow peas in a red wine reduction. Very nice crust and was cooked to perfection. I ordered the early spring tasting menu and it rocked! Started with a Nantucket striped bass crudo. Very fresh, light and well seasoned. Next, I was presented with 4 whole Madagascar prawns. These were the largest prawns I have ever seen, pretty much little lobsters - and they were cooked to perfection. Then, the kobe sirloin with asparagus, shallot and  wasabi sauce came out with my malbec. Very tender piece of meat. Maybe could have used a touch more salt, but the flavor of the beef more than spoke for itself. Finally, for dessert, we shared the trio of brioche doughnuts, dolce du leche ice cream and Mexican hot chocolate, as well as a hibiscus semifredo with a poppy seed crisp and pound cake. Also, because it was my birthday, the servers brought out two complimentary glasses of prosecco di asti and a tasting of confections from the pastry chef. From top to bottom , absolutely wonderful.

2010-03-02,4.0,"I've been meaning to go here for drinks since the time John Kinder was featured as the mixologists to look out for in Chicago. I had a bourbon cocktail and it was deceptively strong, but smooth as silk. I was served by a bartender that just moved to the area, but his skills and flavor adjustments were spot on. He was also nice enough to comp a mocktail that we ordered. My only complaint about the menu was that the cocktail prices were hovering at $14-15. Even for Chicago, that's really pushing the envelope. I put in a total of $37 for two cocktails. I think some hard working people probably want to beat me upside the head for burning that kinda cash. I try to be conscious of value and finding the best product for the lowest price. Thus, I will sanction MK and will blow all my money on the likes of VH, Sepia, Drawing Room, and Boka at $12/pop...

Our tastebuds must have been so accustomed to the fresh fruits, seafood, non-steroid pumped meats and dairy, as everything about this meal tasted so overly salted. I may have made the first mistake ordering a Veal Porterhouse instead of the typical Sirloin.  The Porterhouse was good; however overly salted and fatty.  You never see cuts of meat that large overseas and it makes you wonder how they get the animals so large in the Midwest.  We did receive an amuse of ground cod that was tasty, however, again, overly salted.  The bubs seared tuna, our scallop appetizer, and truffle fries were all very wonderful and appropriately seasoned.

The decor and atmosphere is modern and comfortable.  The staff were the most attentive we've ever experienced from the hostess who took our reservations and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion to our server and the gentlemen who cleared our plates and refilled our drinks.  Anticipated our every need but were not intrusive.  Mid way through the meal when my wife accidentally tipped over her pepsi (in her defense she is a little clumsy, being pregnant) the server at the table next to us who saw it happen immediately grabbed a tray and additional napkins and had it cleaned up before we knew what happened.  She also immediately had my wife's entree replaced with a brand new one because there were a couple of drops of pepsi on the plate.  Something that was not necessary but very much appreciated.   We had the ravioli for our appetizer which is highly recommended (the mascarpone cheese oozed out and was divine) and I tried the lobster bisque which was fantastic.  My wife had the seared peppercorn crusted tuna with wilted spinach and garlic mashed potatoes and it was very tender and had such rich flavor (even with it being cooked to a requested medium).  I had the veal porterhouse with green peppercorn sauce which melted in my mouth and was the best veal I've ever had; highly recommended!  The broccolini was cooked to perfection.   We skipped desert as we were headed to Hot Chocolate for desert (something I wish we hadn't done after a below avg experience @ HC and the rave reviews others have posted about MK's cake and shake).  Even though we skipped desert, our server brought out complementary mexican hot chocolate and made our evening with Happy Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate.   The service was unbelievable and the food was exquisite!  We will def be back next time we're in Chicago! I've also seen MK described as expensive; it wasn't cheap but we have eaten at 4 & 5 star restaurants in most of the top cities in North America and western Europe and I think MK is one of the best values for the level of service and quality of food that we've experienced.",0.9963,0.838,0.154,0.007,0.52148717136522

CORKED!   Yada, yada, yada.  We got a new bottle of wine.  The food was fairly amazing.  And we left very happy.  But you, pompous wine dude, knocked this from a four-star to a three-star experience.  And on my birthday!  You, sir, should be ashamed! ...try the venison, foie, and cake and shake... ...that is all.",0.9567,0.787,0.136,0.077,0.4478977272727273

MK lived up to all my previous expectations of remembering how good it was, and then some. I love the interior style, which is sleek, modern, and even has a balcony with tables with a nice view of the lower level. MK isn't large but isn't terribly crowded either, with many of the tables fitting into quiet little nooks. They had lights on the balcony for the holidays. Our waiter, Julio, was incredible! He was charming, witty, and had an incredible sense of humor. He noticed the little things, quickly responded to requests, and happily took photos of my family for my camera-happy mom. He then posed for a picture we took of him! He interspersed some basic Spanish into the conversation, which is expected out in California but confusing to my Chicago-based family, none of who speak a word of Spanish. It was hilarious! The food was absolutely delicious and served at a lingering pace. I had the whitefish / lobster combination, which was wonderful, as was the cake and shake, a modern twist on a classic dessert. You also can't come here without ordering the fries, which come with a delicious horseradish sauce. They also had an extensive selection of wine, and they were happy to honor the 10% off of bottles of wine on Thursday night, even though it was a holiday. That takes a little cut out of the prices here, although there's no denying this is an expensive restaurant. It's so wonderful, though, that it's worth the splurge.

Ambience - spacious, lively without being noisy (a difficult balance that mK strikes wonderfully).  I prefer the tables upstairs for couples; the tables on the main floor are best for groups. Wine list - a definite strong point for mK.  The list is extensive and well organized.  The sommelier, Patrick, is helpful and truly listens to your feedback.  Be clear about what you're looking for, and he will take it from there. Food - excellent.  The dozen or so entrees I've tried have all been delicious and well portioned.  May be a touch pricey, but you are rewarded with a superb dish.  TIp: splurge on the appetizers.  They are well priced and also come in decent portions, an excellent way to savor some of the great tastes on the menu while staying budget-conscious.  The grilled octopus and ravioli are favorites.  Save room for dessert - you'll be glad you did.  The cake & shake is a must. Service - the real highlight of a night at mK is the people who help make your evening special.  Everyone I've had the pleasure of getting to know at mK has been a delight.  The staff is well educated on the menu, attentive without being overbearing, and happy to go out of their way to make things perfect and memorable.  They are especially adept at tailoring their service to the mood of your party; whether you are conversational and looking to engage them, or would prefer a more private affair, they do not disappoint.  For those who have the pleasure of visiting mK every so often, I guarantee they'll make you feel like a regular, someone they look forward to seeing.  Consider it a special treat if Sergio and/or Enrique look after your table when you're there.  They are truly the most professional, gracious, friendly, caring people I've ever met in the restaurant industry.

Still, the roots of Michael's approach is in the food, and (at the time) Todd Stein was at the helm of his flagship restaurant (a change formalized at the end of 2005), Michael, of course, had nothing to worry about. Todd won a number of ""Best New Chef"" awards for 2005 (odd, since he's been in the industry for a while, and even Chicago before, but who is he to argue with a little press?) and they were well deserved. He keeps his food simple, but with a robustness of flavor and a solidity of presence. His line is well-trained, consistently turning out dependably good meals - and as a catastrophe with a recent fellow diner's sweetbreads showed me, Todd is not above stepping in on the line himself when something has to be corrected. Todd is a fan of preparing foie gras and he does it right; he also makes sure to stock a proper sauternes or two to pair it with. They often have good solid Italian and French reds there, even by the half-bottle, and fairly reasonably priced at that. His sauces are often intense, even heavy, but always complementary to the main ingredient at hand. Todd's philosophy of dining carries over to his whole restaurant, and I think it serves him well: ""Use great ingredients and treat them well. Respect is key. Dining isn't just eating. It starts from the moment you walk in. It includes the service, the flatware, everything."" That's the case at mk; the service is dependable, friendly, and in all ways engaging. The room has a bit of a New York feel to it; it's large, open, with broad strokes of black (but not drearily so) and soft uptempo ambient or synth music in the background. The menu is reductionist, tongue-in-cheek, with all-lower case dish names like ""lobster"" and ""lobster again""; desserts are handled similarly (if slightly more loquaciously) by the talented Kate Neumann, with dishes like her signature ""one banana, two banana"" and ""cake and shake"". David was our absolute favorite waiter there (he since moved on to Blackbird and other restaurants), and (wherever he is now) you would do well to sit with him; his suggestions are nearly always dead-on, he remembers your preferences and knows a palate after he starts to work with you, and he's a lot of fun without being at all overbearing. Oh, and trying the pommes frites is worth it, but do yourself a favor and order an extra truffle cream from the start. You'll each want one, trust me, and it only comes with one to start. Pros: Solid, intense food, changing menu, excellent chef history (I don't actually know the new one), great service. Offers foie gras, morels, and other ""exotic"" ingredients that make life worth living. Cons: Food can be a bit heavy for lighter eaters. Not inexpensive. Summary: A dependably good restaurant with a touch of New York, right here in downtown Chicago.",0.9986,0.79,0.195,0.015,0.4791943047991435
2009-09-10,5.0,"I was really excited about coming to MK after reading all of the reviews; word on the street is that this place is awesome.  Mk totally lived up to what I hoped for: a delicious meal.  The staff was very friendly and not at all pretentious.  Everyone that we encountered from the host to the wait staff treated us like royalty, even though it's probably pretty obvious that we are not high rollers.  The layout is really open and the bar area is upfront near the entrance.  Came here with a friend on a Wednesday evening and ordered some cocktails.  Highly recommend the 'Gin and Juice' (go ahead, sing some snoop dog to yourself, I did).  We split an appetizer (grilled ocotpus) and ordered two entrees (the bison and tuna) and 1 side of pomme frittes.  It was my first time having grilled octoups, it was really tender and flavorful.  The kitchen sent out some other dishes for us to try, on the house.  They included a salad with blue cheese, apples, and pecans, as well as a side-dish of zucchini and squash.  Both were yummy!  The waiter was happy to split the salad and octopus appetizer between the two of us.     Oh, I can't forget dessert.  We shared the 'two bananas walk into a bar' and it was absolutely heavenly.  I wish that we wouldn't have shared it because I could easily have inhaled a whole one by myself.  A small tray of miniatures was brought out as the final item, with lemon jellies, brownies, and shortbread cookie.   There are some fine dining places that you go to once and enjoy, and then there are other places that you want to come back to more often.  MK is going to be an often place, for sure.  Shout-out to MK, please keep gin and juice on the menu!!",0.9959,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.5941269841269842

2009-07-25,4.0,"Everything about MK feels exclusive. And not in an ostentatious way, but from it's gritty location to its unassuming exterior, one might start fretting over not remembering the password to get in.  It's unquestionable that the food is the star of the show. And people are willing to drop big, big bucks on kobe and crawfish. Hundred dollar bills fly about like ticker tape, but even if you lack name brand and karats you are treated with respect. At least until you're seated. I went here for my 30th birthday, with my two favorite people, Marc and Mom. We sat for hours chatting, marveling at the crowd, the sweets, the savories. We wanted to put MK in our top five dining experiences (Crush in Toronto still leads the pack for me), but what makes it more top ten is the service. There was nothing about MK that went above and beyond. If you want to rival five-star restaurants in the city you have to do more than just check the box on making a fantastic meal. Service only glinted, it didn't shine. Our waiter was visibly irritated with his staff, and though our runner more than made up for his attitude, we were feeling a little left behind.  Maybe we should have ordered a bottle of wine? Lost 60 pounds and shown some cleavage? Stopped by David Yurman on the way in? I don't know what he wanted from us, but I know the relationship was more give than take. But the chef is getting it right, and he ought be lauded. Praise be for the truffle fries.

I am pregnant, and once I mentioned this, the waiter remembered throughout the evening and altered his suggestions to me by what he knew I could/could not eat (ie; shellfish, alcohol, etc.). By chance, there was a leak where a few drips of water was falling on us and as soon as I said something, an army of people came to change our table immediately, moving all of our items into the correct order and replacing our silverware and napkins. They were extremely apologetic and made up for it with an after dinner drink and dessert. The food was absolutely amazing! Our friends who had dined there prior were treated extremely well and recognized by the staff. My husband and I will dine here again in the near future for sure.

2009-06-29,4.0,"I'll keep it simple. Went here with three friends on a Saturday night early res 6.30.  We had the pomegranate mohitos which were mediocre and followed it with dinner from the  tasting menu ($45) and the accompanying wine flight of half glasses ($26). There was an amusebouche to start which was a orange butter topped some vegetable substance that was forgettable and a wonderfully fresh piece of salmon.  The fish and citrus was fantastic. One of our party doesn't like fish even appreciated this. First course was tuna with sea beans, charred scallions and white soy.  Good salt and onion to balance the fish. Second was porcini mushrooms with parmigiano-reggiano and arugula. Actually the arugula was there more for color I believe. The cheese and porcini's went beautifully together and were complimented by a fantastic Pinot Noir.  Great earthiness all around.   Third was bison which was cooked to perfection at medium rare. a touch of blood, tender and delicious. Well pared with a Cabernet. Fourth- Dessert fell flat. A lot of good flavors but some how the chocolate was a little over powering for the other flavors - which were good mind you but hard to find. Additionally the chocolate tasted more like milk than dark and I was really looking forward to dark chocolate to off set the berries.  I suppose this is all about expectation.  This final course was served with an extraordinary creamy cherry. Portions could have been larger. Left feeling mildly  sated but i could hear my hunger for more tasty morsels and in my mouth and my stomach whispering for more. We followed tis up with wine and cheese over at Bin 36.  Service: Perfectly well executed. I had no wants or complaints.  Space - a little tight on the top floor but the view  of pretty people below was quite nice.  Price - we all paid about $100 each with tip.

2009-06-24,2.0,"Unmemorable experience - considering the cost and unimpressive food, we left disappointed Cool, comfortable atmosphere makes for a casual cosmopolitan setting. We loved the bar/lounge area and the giant skylight above the dining area  the wood ceiling enhanced the overall atmosphere. The design, décor and architecture of the restaurant was my favorite part of the dining experience. The service was fair at best.  Although the servers were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, numerous times I had to wave one of them down and  ask them to do something that should of already been done. Our dinner plates where left in front of us a unusually long time after we finished our meal.  Lots of water and repeat coffee requests. We felt rushed at times and at other times received no attention. They seemed like they just did not care.  This next issue was a bit bothersome. There were 3 of us in our party we all had first courses and entrees but I was the only one to have a second course( I love to eat ) in the middle of my second course the waiter brought out our entrees when he saw I was still on my second course he continued to walk by and returned to kitchen. It seems their timing was a off and although I don't think it effected the food to much I don't want something like this happening at a expensive high end dinner it seems more a rookie restaurant mistake. THE FOOD First course - Foie Gras - I remember the first time I tasted foie gras my eyes rolled into the back of my head and I said oh my God. Since then I have considered the increased risk of cardiac arrest a fair trade off so I could experience the rich creamy bold melt in your mouth flavors of foie gras. I did not experience those feelings with the Foie gras at MK. Although it had a nice presentation the foie gras did not have that explode in your mouth flavor it is known for. Lastly the foie gras had a stringy texture which I think has a issue to do with the grade or cleaning. Tuna Tartar - Nothing special at all a huge serving looked to be almost the size of a hockey puck. Served with cured olives that totally over powered the tuna. Not much interesting and seemed wrong flavors were paired together.  Rather than being neatly cubed, the tuna was in randomly sized layers, many too large for a single bite. Second course - The Lobster Soup - The soup was served table side with the waiter pouring the liquid into the soup bowl that contained the lobster and other components. I love table side service so I enjoyed this but the flavors were one dimensional and not leaving me wanting to get every last drop before the waiter removed the bowl it was not that special taste that makes you go MMMMMM in a public place. The soup was listed on the menu as lobster medallions which got me excited and what drew me to order the soup but when it was served the lobster medallions were only small lobster pieces not medallions at all. Main Course- Sirloin Steak with wine Syrup - This is my favorite cut of steak I ordered it just under medium and it came out to the correct doneness. At a cost of $48 I expected nothing but the best steak. Price wise $48 is on the high end of the scale for this cut of meat and actually priced higher then most of the best steak restaurants in the city and even country. When the steak arrived it looked beautifully charred contrasting the red wine syrup it was resting on but when I cut into the steak it did not look juicy or moist or have that flavor full look great tasting steaks have. When I bit into the steak it did not melt in my mouth it was tasty but not a great steak. My favorite steak is the Bone in Kansas city strip at Tavern On Rush which price wise is $42.95 and melt in your mouth tender delicious and oozes with juice and flavor when bit into every time I have had it.  Side Dishes Pommes frites with truffle cream - Awesome crispy potatoes cool presentation in a tall glass with white paper to make a cone so the fries cascaded over the side . The truffle cream was wonderful if I ever drown I want it to be in the truffle cream sauce. Id die with a smile on my face for sure. Don't miss these Caramelized Brussel Sprouts with Truffle - Very good even the people that normally throw them under the table would like these. I think a restaurant at this level and price needs to be on its game all the time. Any mistakes that might be made are so small they are forgotten because its the great things that are remembered about the meal. unfortunately this was not the case.",0.9989,0.771,0.171,0.058,0.5020896563753705

We were seated upstairs at a table that gave us a birds eye view of the entire restaurant.  The room is elegant and comfortable.  There is space between  the tables so you can have a private dining experience and not worry about  other diners sitting too close,  (Make sure to ask for a spot upstairs when you make your reservation.)   After we were seated, the manager, Patrick brought us a delightful cocktail to celebrate our Anniversary.  This was such a lovely way to start our evening together.  The service here is top notch.  The staff is obviously trained to be helpful without being pushy.  They are very attentive without making you feel harassed.    Our server was wonderful !  She guided us through the menu, offered suggestions and even pointed out things that would  ""blow our taste buds"" away.   Every suggestion that she made was spot on !!! I had the octopus to start.   It was a little spicy, but cooled down by a tart meyer lemon sauce.  So good !  It was the BEST I have ever had !  I am pretty sure that I made yummy noises while eating it....  My husband had a lemony ceasar salad that was very  refreshing.  It was good, but he wishes he had been more daring and tried something new.  For our main course, I had the Snapper and my husband had the sirloin steak.  My snapper was delicious.  It was fresh and moist and seasoned perfectly.   My husbands steak was in a league all it's own.  Hands down this was the most delicious steak We have ever had.  It is charred on the outside and served in a wine reduction.  The meat is tender and juicy and so flavorful.. This steak is worth every penny of the 48.00 !!! We ordered the morel mushrooms and the pomme's frites with truffle aioli.

For desert  I had the rhubarb  cobbler with the honey ice scream and my husband had the mini vanilla malt milkshake with cookies.  When they served us the deserts we were surprised with  the thoughtful way they had written Happy Anniversary in chocolate on the top of the plates.  My rhubarb was tart and tasty and the honey ice cream was heavenly.  My husband wanted something small, so they offered him the mini milkshake with out the cake.  The milkshake was served  with two tasty little cookies and was absolutely sinful !  A perfect ending to an absolutely  wonderful meal.

2009-05-25,5.0,"I think yelp needs a different rating system for restaurants.  They need a special ""10 Star"" rating for places such as French Laundry and Alinea which shouldn't be in the same category as anyone else.  99% of other restaurants for me would fit into the usual 5 point scale.   However in my opinion, MK would deserve 8 stars. The ambiance, decor, vibe, lighting, seating, artwork were all just ideal for me.  It's such a beautiful and lively place without being loud or overcrowded.  I like the smart casual theme versus other places that tend a little more to the stuffy side.  MK is by far my favorite in Chicago in terms of ambiance. The wine list is out of this world.  I found numerous favorites, they have great coverage of all the best varietals and regions and with reasonable prices. The service was simply flawless.  On a par with Trotter's and Alinea.  Our server Tino was helpful, attentive and knowledgeable, efficient and friendly.  Couldn't ask for better. Also, the servers and other staff were professional and unobtrusive as one would hope. The food was sensational.  It is one of those menus that just tickles me where I itch.  I could have ordered any of 8 starters and almost all the entrees, which is very rare for me.  Since we were having a phenomenal White Burgundy, we opted for mostly seafood.  Our appetizers were each better than the next.  And my pepper crusted yellowfin tuna was the best tuna I've ever had.  Everything on the dish was in perfect harmony.   Finally the bill was WAY less than I expected for the amount of food, wine and the high quality.    I was also impressed that they have a $45/per person three course chef's menu.   I look forward to trying that out. All in all, I think MK is my new favorite spot in Chicago.  Yes, I think Alinea is the best there is for special occasions or for a transformational culinary experience, and yes I think Les Nomades is the best for an intimate and romantic French dining experience.  But for a lively, fun place where you can get a world class meal with world class wine at a very reasonable bill, MK is it for me.   I hope to be back many times over the next year.",0.9981,0.763,0.225,0.011,0.5122458575906853

2009-05-21,3.0,"Let me start off by saying that I really, really, really wanted to love MK. Being in charge of finding a place to celebrate our wedding anniversary I chose MK after reading all the glowing reviews on Yelp and after seeing the restaurant showcased on ""Check, please."" First, the positives.  I had the MK 10th Anniversary martini to start the evening and it was nothing short of divine.  The bartender, or shall I say, mixologist, clearly knows what she is doing.  The martini tasted fresh and summery and showcased a perfect grapefruit to alcohol ratio. Overall, we loved the ambience of MK.  The decor of the restaurant was modern (without being too stiff or pretentious) and airy with high vaulted ceilings.  Kudos to the owner for his impeccable music taste.  Apparently, the music that was playing all night was from the owner's IPod: mainly down-tempo electronica with a lot of Bebel Gilberto and Thievery Corporation.  Loved it. The butter MK serves with their bread basket transforms ordinary bread into an almost religious experience.  I very rarely eat butter, but I could not stop slathering this rich, sinful goodness onto my bread and savoring every carb-tastic calorie.  Unlike the hard pats of butter or the round scoops of butter you get at most restaurants, MK serves a square of butter that is so soft it would not surprise me to hear that they have an on site butter churner.  The butter is sprinkled with sea salt and yields easily to the most timid knife.   So indulgent, and so good. Now, on to the negatives which, unfortunately, revolves around the most important component of a wonderful dinging experience: the food. I could not believe how salty the majority of the dishes were.  I had read a few other complaints about the saltiness but I was hoping they were fluke occurrences.  Not so.   The goat cheese ravioli appetizer was good, but it would have been so much better if the goat cheese didn't have to compete with the overabundance of salt in the dish.   My entree, the seared tuna, was good, but I could not get over the saltiness of the accompanying greens or the gritty texture of the food.  Every time I bit down on the greens (i believe it was spinach), I felt that unpleasant grittiness in my mouth that often occurs when there are small stones or sea grit in scallops.  The garlic mashed potatoes were wonderful, as were the accompanying mushrooms, but the overall dish was greatly disserviced by the texture of the food and its saltiness. Not everything about the food was negative.   The grilled octopus appetizer was savory and delicious.  While the octopus was a bit over-charred, it was very tender and melted in our mouths.  The bok choy nestled underneath the octopus was perfectly seasoned. My husband had the prime NY sirloin which was very good and perfectly cooked.  But, for 48 dollars, that was to be expected.  It would have been nice if his sirloin had been accompanied with a more substantial side (i believe he got a few mushrooms and some spring onions?). The service was also...fine.  Nothing spectacular.  We had to wait too long before our waitress took our drink order and both the sommelier and the waitress seemed to spend a disproportionate amount of time catering to the every whim of the table next to us:  A couple of old white guys who clearly had more money to spend than we did.   All in all, it was a ""fine"" experience...but when we are paying over 200 dollars for our meals, the experience should be much more than fine, it should be stellar.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the city where you can get the same quality of food for a fraction of the price.   And unfortunately for us, the saltiness of the food and the overall ""average"" dining experience will probably keep us from returning.",0.9973,0.807,0.146,0.047,0.517031746031746
2009-05-11,5.0,"I came here for my ex's birthday dinner (my treat) and I have to say, it's probably one of the top 5 meals I've ever had. Everything was memorable. Appetizer: Scallops - the scallops were cooked perfectly, a little bit raw in the middle, seared to perfection on the outside. It was garnished with peas and some other sauce. I'm not a huge fan of peas, but these freaking peas were delicious! They were huge, crunchy, and buttery. Main course: Kobe beef - Delicious! tender and juicy. Side dish: Fries with truffle aioli - Wow. the aioli sauce just brings the fries to a different level. It's great to just try to the fries without the sauce and once you dip it in, everything just changes. Dessert: Malt Milk Shake with Three layered Chocolate cake - Exquisite! The malt milk shake was something out of this world. I've never had a milk shake as creamy, malty, vanillay as this one. I can't put my finger on what was done to set it apart.  Overall, every course was memorable and eyebrow raising. The service that night wasn't great, and the decor of the restaurant was nothing to be a fan about, but the food, the food was stellar. Would I come to MK again? Definitely, but only when I have the money for it. (also, when I made reservations they asked if it was for anything special, so of course I said it was for my ex's bday, and they brought out the dessert with a lit candle for him.)",0.9838,0.792,0.145,0.063,0.6278826246217549
2009-05-07,5.0,"I took my husband to mk for dinner this week to celebrate his birthday and couldn't have been happier with the choice.  Honestly, this meal was in the top five dining experiences I've ever had.  Scratch that, top three.  Note:  I'm a picky, picky bitch who can be dissatisfied in an instant.  mk has a modern urban feel, with brick walls and a lovely lofted area that has roughly 10 more tables.  Since we arrived right on time for our reservation (valet parking for $10 if you can't nab a meter spot nearby or are running late), we were seated immediately, but there is a bar/lounge area where I wouldn't have minded waiting at all.   We were in a great spot along the rail of the loft, overlooking the restaurant.   Sergio, our server, greeted us promptly and gave us time to look over the wine list and menu.  I can't say enough about how wonderful Sergio was personally, and how exceptional the service was overall:  wonderfully paced, attentive without ever being obnoxious, knowledgeable without being at all pretentious.  I loved that he could give detailed feedback on dishes we asked about, was well informed on wines they offered, and had a demeanor that was inviting and calming.   I would request a table in his section again.   We got the party going with specialty drinks:  mk 10th Anniversary martini (me, and I loved it) and an Adlib (him, and it was rum heaven).  With Sergio's input, we decided on our menu.   Our first course was compliments of the chef:  a King Salmon tartar amuse-bouche.  I don't eat salmon, but my husband eagerly snarfed them both down and the look on his face said it all.  From his feedback, ""citrusy, clean, awesome."" We moved on to the next course:  Goat Cheese Ravioli.  Holy shiznit.  It was perfection.  The perfect balance of the creamy delicious tang of both goat cheese and talegio.  Each bite melted in my mouth.    Next up was the Belgian endive salad with apple, watercress, green beans, blue cheese, and bits of toasted pecans.  I'm not sure what the dressing was on this salad, but I'm certain it contained crack.  Wow. Divine.   My husband, who is never served seafood at home, went the expected route and ordered the whitefish / shellfish dish.  A shellfish broth was poured tableside on a beautiful dish of whitefish, poached lobster, mussels, and clams in the shell.  He raved, and I trust his palate.   Based on Sergio's feedback, I was pumped to get my New York Strip.   I ordered my steak medium, which no one seems to get right, and I could've cried when I saw the color of my steak- char on the outside, pink throughout, then a hint of red in the middle....   ::angels singing::  It  was tender to the point of melting in my mouth, and plated with a red wine reduction that was heavenly...notes of cherry, sort of sweet but still sour. Perfectly balanced flavor that was an ideal compliment the cut of meat.  Served with sugar snap peas and cipollini onions.  Wonderful with the bottle of Sharecopper's Pinot Noir we ordered (all bottles under $125 are 10% off, and this one was $56.  Great wine list, but I'd like to see more options under $75).   Is it wrong that I'm still fantasizing about the pommes frites and truffle cream?   We were stuffed but contemplated dessert.  While we talked, drank, and discussed dessert, our very astute server let us know that he asked the kitchen to prepare a special birthday dessert for us...on him.    Holla!   Minutes later we were presented with ""two bananas walk into a bar""-  a scrumptious  banana soufflé, banana ice cream, toasted marshmallow, macadamia nut crumble, and chocolate sauce.   Perfect end to a perfect meal.",0.9993,0.759,0.211,0.03,0.5815194552036658

Apparently, not many people need to eat on this day at this hour in Chicago, as was evidenced by the two other occupied tables at the restaurant. I am always skeptical of an empty restaurant, regardless of the hour, but MK delivered on its reputation. They have an excellent wine list, and we took advantage of their discount wine program, 10% off of bottles under $100, 25% off of bottles above. We enjoyed a Merlot from Sonoma that is very difficult to find, and we were quite pleased to have it for less mark up than usual. The food at MK was really, really good. I began my meal with pillow soft ricotta gnocchi sauced in woodsy, buttery mushrooms and the Venison I had for my main course was perfectly cooked and thoughtfully prepared. My husband raved about his hamachi and kobe sirloin as well (although how can one screw up kobe sirloin?) Dessert was amazing, a banana dessert that had us scraping every last streak of sauce off of the plate. We seriously considered getting another one. The one thing that irked me about MK was the service. I felt like the two girls waiting on us were on uppers. They behaved strangely, lingering at the table after we had said we needed some time with the menu, and speaking to us like we were either in kindergarten or mentally impaired.

Okay so now onto the good stuff.  The host was very nice and we didn't have to wait to be seated.  (we did have a reservation, but you know how that goes)  We got taken to our seat and seen by our waiter as soon as we got settled.  Our waiter's name was Toni - I think.  He was great.  Really personable, older gentleman, and totally not snobby.  In fact, as nice as this place is nothing and no one was snobby or uppity at all.  That was such a relief.   Okay so we ordered the Fixed Price menu for $45/ person.   I was really surprized at how reasonable that was, especially when many entrees in the menu were in the $30 range.   We got the bread basket first which had really delicious homemade fresh bread that we loved, then we got a little complementary small plate that had shrimp and cinnamon and something else, really good.    Next as part of the prix fixe we got the pumpkin soup.  At first when they brought it out I wasn't so sure it was the pumpkin soup as it looked like just a bunch of raw pumkin pieces and green onions at the bottom of a bowl with some foamy stuff on top.  Then they poured the soup into our bowls simultaneously out of little pitchers.  Best pumpkin soup EVER!   It really blew my mind.   Next we got the scallops which were perfectly crisp on the outside and then totally and literally dissolved into your mouth.  I really couldn't believe how soft they were inside.  It was like they dissapeared every time you took a bite.  We were really impressed by these.   For our entree we had the duck.  It was really great and had cloves and cinnamon and really amazing.  I was REALLY full at this point.

We got the seared scallop as an appetizer (comes on their tasting menu but they made sure we knew that everything was customizable, so the tasting menu items can be ordered a la carte, and the a la carte menus can substitute other items on the tasting menu.. how great!!).  The scallop was tender and seared perfectly and came with a lemony sauce and on top of some crispy proscuitto and mini cubes of roasted potatoes.  The potatoes were a bit undercooked for my tastes, but overall a great dish. For the main course, I got the seared yellowfin tuna that came with delicious savory garlic mashed potatoes and spinach and a sweet red wine sauce.  I all but licked my plate (classy :D).  My sister got the salmon that came with shitake mushrooms and bok choy.  Not a big fan of salmon myself but she enjoyed it and I liked the Asian-y sauce it came with. We also got a side of pomme frites with the white truffle sauce, and they were so good!  Yes, they're french fries, but 1. they were good french fries (and salted perfectly!), and 2. the truffle sauce was wonderful (when they first came out I thought I was going to end up asking them for ketchup, but I didn't have to lol). I ended with the warm brioche banana bread pudding with the dark chocolate sorbet and the salted caramel sauce.  Pretty good, but the bread pudding wasn't the best I'd ever had (not rich enough maybe?), and the sorbet, if you don't like your chocolate dark, don't try it (I do so this wasn't a problem for me really). I don't know if I'll be back because it was pricey (about $70 pp inc. tip/tax) and there are lots of places I want to try and nothing to me was so craveable that I NEED to be back.  Nonetheless, all in all, it was a FANTASTIC dinner, I found nothing wrong with it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to eat with great service and food!

2008-10-24,5.0,"Phenomenal. Simply perfect. After years away, I went back to Chicago for work and dragged two friends to MK, hoping that it was as good as I recalled, seeing as we were forsaking the rest of Chi-town's dining options. It didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is classy without being stuffy. Jeans fit in as well as dressier clothes that the price tag may imply. The loft space and random music piped in keeps it comfortable for the average diner.  The meal was simply perfection. From a prompt table to pleasant hosts and waitstaff, the intro just set the tone.

Lightly fishy with crisp crackers for spreading, it was a great entre to chef Erick Williams.  Our appetizers were: Tuna tartare - an MK classic, it was as good as ever, served with a bit of chopped olives and a remoulade which would have been on top, but contained the allergen, so was served on the side.  A special appetizer comprised primarily of prosciutto and burrata cheese with some arugula. The burrata was creamy and smooth, and a perfect foil to the salty toughness of the meat.  The butternut squash ravioli. Scented with cinnamon and crispy sage in brown butter, this could be one of the best apps ever. We all said it could have been breakfast, dinner, dessert and we still would have loved it.  Our entrees were also good. I had the Berkshire pork chop special, that was flavored with a great rosemary sauce/jus and gigante beans that ate like potatoes. My companions had the Bison and Veal, each of which was prepared exquisitely. We all voted the pork the best, and I could see it landing on the regular menu.  Dessert was a treat. Prior to eating, Amy Sampson, the pastry chef, came over and checked on us. She helped guide us to a couple of options, and suggested a set we hadn't really thought of - her favorite, the Nuts For Chocolate and a serving of the Concord Grape Gelato, which is served over thinly sliced Bartlett pears for a really unexpected taste.  Phenomenal.

It's a gloriously gorgeous restaurant -- sweeping, curved lines in the architecture, beautiful black and white paintings hung over exposed brick -- lovely service and artfully presented food...

2008-06-02,5.0,"Possibly, and I say this with no exaggeration, one of the best meals I have had in a very long time.  My husband and I wanted to get dressed up for a night out to celebrate our 1st anniversary. We wanted great ambiance, wonderful service, and excellent food, but we didn't want to break the bank. After checking yelp and scouting menu prices, we settled on MK and I couldn't have been happier with the experience! We arrived early and sat at the bar for a drink. When our table was ready the hostess walked us over, carrying my martini for me (a little extra step that set the tone for great service). Our server came over and intriduced himself (and dammit I can't remember his name) and let us know he'd be working with another server, Sergio. He left us to finish our martinis and peruse the wine list and menu.  Then the sommolier came over....and things got a little less great for a second. Here's my side rant #1: - I don't know all that much about wine in the ""I know all about this winemake, the winemaking process, and that the soil was especially great in Alsace in 1994"". I know what I like, and I know myself enough to know that I will generally enjoy a $30 bottle just a much as a $75 bottle, and that in a nice place I expect that even the cheapest bottle must still be pretty good.  - A good sommalier should find out what the drinker likes, his/her budget and make reccomendations while not ever making the drinker feel bad about his/her knowledge of wine, choice of dinner entree or budget. Okay, so this sommalier was a mile a minute. She didn't really care what we liked, she cared what we were going to eat. Dan said we planned to have white wine as I was getting the whitefish, even though he was getting the bison, which he'd never had before. Her response was that it was ""just a steak"" and then she mentioned two half bottles and quickly said she'd bring them over. NO, please wait. Do not just bring me something without making sure it's okay, especially because upon checking the list I realized that it would have been over $70 worth of wine. I told her our budget was under $50 and she left us to talk things over - we never saw her again.  We picked a $40 Italian white wine that was perfect. We started with the butter lettuce salad, which was good, and the grilled octopus, which was fantastic. We also shared an order of the frites with truffle cream. Wow, that sauce was amazing. It was all I could do to keep myself from licking the ramekin. The service was so professionial yet down to earth that I feel like if I had the reaction would have been less ""show some class, this is MK!"" and more ""that stuff is good, huh?"" With all that I decided to go with the appetizer butter poached lobster instead of the whitefish and lobster entree and I am so glad I did. It was the perfect portion of perfectly cooked lobster atop an amazing risotto. Dan had the grilled pork, cooked medium rare, and absolutely delicious. As we were finishing our meal, we polished off the wine, and our glasses were refilled on the house, so that we'd have wine to finish our entrees with. Nice touch.  We decided to splurge on desserts and went with a chcolate martini and the ""cake and shake"" for me and a glass of port and some creme brulee for Dan. We were also brought out a small plate of cookies and glasses of Muscato d'Asti on the house! The wine was great and the desserts were decadent and delicious. My cake was rich and chocolatey and the tiny vanilla milkshake was creamy and wonderful.  The pastry chef stopped by inquire on how we liked the desserts, and the manager, who brought over the muscato, was interested in how things were as well. When we expressed our dissapointment with the sommalier he seemed genuinely concerned.  With the exception of the service of the sommalier (and the service of all the other staff more than made up for it) everything was wonderful. The food was amazing, and the price is quite reasonable for the quality (we paid $180 for salad, appetizer, frites, wine,  my appetizer dinner, Dan's entree, 2 desserts, port and martini).  The ambiance was quite nice, but (side rant  #2 coming up) would it kill people to dress up? I'm spending $200 on dinner, I want to wear a cocktail dress and not feel out of place. I was annoyed that the couple next to me had on jeans, but  I got over it and as the night progressed the other patrons seemed to get more dressy. The service was impeccable and the staff seemed to geniuinley care about our experience.  I can't go out for a $200 dinner very often, but when I do MK will be at the top of my list. Or I may come for an appetizer, drink, and some of the amazing frites at the bar.",0.9994,0.758,0.195,0.047,0.5937749287749285
2008-05-16,5.0,"I was heartbroken by not having the opportunity to dine again at MK during a recent visit to Chicago.  This is that rare kind of restaurant where the experience is so enjoyable that, even six months later, this diner still fondly recalls the food, wine and environs.  It's that good!   MK is formal without being formal.  It's housed in an open, restored old row building.  If possible, seek out a table on the ""terrace"" so as to take in the action below as well as have unobstructed views of the space including the artwork, exposed brick walls and beam ceiling.   The service, like the dining room, is professional without being stuffy.  Our waiter, Armando, was both charming and knowledgeable, and helped identify the standouts on the menu.  My dining companion had the sumptuous lobster bisque.  My tuna tartare with avocado and fermented black bean sauce was the epitome of fresh and flavor.  We both had the New York strip finished with a red wine sauce that lived up to Armando's claim on being one of the best steaks in town.  No matter what, don't miss out on the pommes frites with truffle cream.  In fact, cast any guilt aside and order extra truffle cream!     Similarly, Josh, the restaurant's sommelier, was insightful and engaging.  He counseled us away from a Turley zinfandel we originally thought of, suggesting that it was too young to pair with the aged sirloin we had ordered, and instead introduced us to a Betts & Scholl syrah that was phenomenally big and the perfect accompaniment to the beef.   (As a side-note, kudos to Josh for proactively decanting the wine.  It's become a pet peeve of mine: I don't feel that I should have to ask that the wine be decanted in high-end restaurants.  Yet that's exactly what I had to do at a recent meal at Emeril's.) Instead of the typical sweet ending, we chose to sample MK's thoughtfully sourced and presented ripe fromage.  The cheese board consisted of both bold and sublime selections with the appropriate accompaniments.  Paired with a glass of port, it was the perfect coda to a glorious experience.   Perhaps that's why I felt so disappointed in missing the chance to dine here again.  MK makes dining an event - something special.  Next time, next visit...   (sighs)",0.9903,0.811,0.144,0.045,0.4572624743677375

I was there last with a group of work colleagues for a thank you dinner-- The service was went from obtrusive to non-existent and our waiter was not elegant or super personable.  Had I not been there with a bunch of people I probably would have been more annoyed. My food was good-- obviously not great because i can barely remember what I had.  I had lamb for my entree all i remeber is  I ordered it Medium Rare...it was more medium but I was starving. The sides were pretty good and it was fun to have such variety since we had so many people.   I was the only wine drinker in the bunch but thankfully they serve splits so I had a nice bottle of pinot noir.  Which was good...but i remember thinking over priced...but whatever. There is better food in the city at this price point but I think they probably give a consistent experience so I would never dissuade someone from coming here....just wouldn't be back on my own accord...,0.9543,0.797,0.14,0.063,0.5766666666666665

They also serve a basket of warm bread with a butter dusted with rock salt, this in itself  was delicious enough. Our main course was Bison and the Pork Chop. Both prepared perfectly, especially the bison. Highly recommend ordering that if its still on the menu. I also ordered a side of Potato Frites with the meal. It came with a Truffle Cream Sauce dipping sauce. I could eat that everyday!! Frites were perfect, brown and crunchy outside, soft inside. At this point we are ready to burst out of our pants.  But I couldn't leave without trying desert. So we ordered the Banana Brioche Bread Pudding.

I'd had hamachi before and was especially excited about it, but imagine my surprise to have 4 thick cut slices, lightly seared, and laid atop vegetables bursting with flavor.  I was literally in food heaven for the first course, but this level of quality in terms of taste, presentation, and exotic flavors continued with all the other courses...it was just amazing how everything was cooked just right.  The presentation of the walleye was especially elegant, with the onion broth being poured on the dish tableside. Among the four of us, we shared one cheese plate before the dessert.  What amazed me about the cheeses is that each was served at exactly the right temperature to expose the flavors.   And the dessert (orange blossom pavlova) was a great way to end the night, it was light, but bursting with flavors...accompanied with fresh blueberries and really tasty blueberry sherbet that I want to go out and buy (which is probably impossible because it's homemade). Service was attentive, but not pretentious at all.  I liked it how the specials of the day were presented on a card for us to peruse, instead of the server reciting a script.   Our server also provided excellent wine recommendations, was honest with his knowledge, and open to working within our desired budget.  Atmosphere was great too, we were seated upstairs which was a bit less crowded than downstairs, so request seating there if you want to enhance your expereince.

We shared the cake and shake for dessert. They did put down ""happy birthday"" on the plate with a candle on top of the cake when they brought out the cake.

Now on to dessert. My fiance let them know it was my bday so they came out with the cake and shake dessert. They wrote ""Happy Birthday Andrea"" on the plate in chocolate sauce, which was a nice touch...anything with chocolate sauce is a nice touch in my book! The cake itself was a bit rich, but in a good way...and even my fiance couldn't help but finish it with me and he's not even a dessert person.  And that vanilla shake sure was good as well! If I had one complaint it would be that the service was a bit slow, especially for a Tuesday evening, but just the fact that every waiter seemed to wish me a happy bday as I walked out the door made up for the wait.

I ordered my standard french martini to start the night off (we had requested an upstairs table and a little wait in the comfy chairs with our martinis before being seated in the more casual loft-style upstairs area). The first thing that I noticed when I opened the menu was that it had a couple of tasty looking martinis that, while I was enjoying my french, I wished I would have known to try them instead. We each ordered appetizers which were delicious: corn soup with lobster (me) and a pasta dish and salad for the other two.  All very good and really whetting my appetite for the main course.  I had the veal off the summer tasting menu and filet and a pasta dish for my friends.  They were just the right size for everyone to have their fill, try the others and find a little room for their specialty side - the pomme frites with a truffle cream sauce.   By this time we had finished off our lovely bottle of pinot gris and were ready for dessert!  Again, all got passed around and all got finished off in the blink of an eye - one creme brulee, one berries with spritz cookies and one peanut-buttery dessert that tasted like a Reese's Cup (and, added bonus, was garnished with pretzels in chocolate and caramel - I think that was my favorite part of the whole night. I additionally had to try out a martini that I had been eyeing earlier - the cucumber.  This would have been a better choice as a before dinner drink as it really did taste like cucumbers (it was like eating a Buttered Popcorn JellyBelly in that it tasted like what it was supposed to....but who wants a popcorn jellybean?)  It was well executed but not the right choice for our sugary desserts.  That one got switched out for a Watermelon Sizzle and hit the exact right note.  Even typing that out makes me crave another...mmmm.... I also can't leave out mentioning our waiter.  Robert was the perfect waiter.  Very attentive and the perfect balance between professional and friendly without being at all overbearing or too sterile.  Talking to him throughout the evening was icing on the cake.

The salmon too was quite exquisite, as was the specialty martini I had while waiting for our table (which wasn't long may I add). By the time I was done with that drink I was already buzzing a little to boot! (Take note: Cheap date over here! Haha!) My companions and I ordered almost all of the desserts on the menu (we are sweet tooth ho's) and ended up being a little disappointed. How can such a fine savory meal not culminate with an equally scrumptious dessert? Needless to say, these were good, but not great. And that is why I deduct a star. Yeah, the single sink in the restroom kinda sucks, but I wasn't too fazed by it. What did bother me some though was that the tables were a little too close together. So close in fact that every time that people from the older group next to us had to use the restroom (quite a few times let me tell you),  I would have to stand up to let them through. Don't judge me now! Of course I let people through and do all that nice/polite/common sense stuff, duh! But when you are in the middle of a wonderful meal and you have to be continuously interrupted, it gets a little annoying.",0.8035,0.845,0.097,0.058,0.5423963133640552

My fianc and I were looking to celebrate a promising week of working out by going out for an overindulgent dinner.  (Funny how that line of thinking works.)   We made a 9:30 reservation and inquired as to the restaurant's position on byob.  We'd been holding on to a special bottle and were pleasantly surprised to be allowed to bring it in for a ""reasonable"" corkage fee.  I would not normally consider $35 as reasonable, except when the restaurant is charging 6x what we originally paid for the bottle. After reading a previous poster's suggestion of asking for the upper area, we did so, and were accommodated.  It's a beautiful space with gorgeous wood beams and high ceilings.  We had a huge banquette table for just the two of us and settled in to the corner.  The waiter made us feel good by oohing and ahhing over our wine selection and got the evening off to a great start. We started with cocktails - some fancy bourbon for the man and a kir royal for me.  Then the grilled baby octopus and artichoke soup - both were fantastic.  My soup was silky smooth, rich and HOT (a wonder other restaurants don't follow suit) and served with a perfectly cooked pair of mussels and the octopus was fantastic.  When I asked about the prep our waiter informed me that the restaurant website actually posts various recipes and the octopus was currently featured - I have yet to try it as it looks fairly daunting, but will hopefully one day give it a shot. Our entrees were wonderful - NY strip prepared better than I have ever had in my life and a very interesting and buttery bison filet.  Simple prep but wonderful flavor - my mouth is watering thinking about it.  We shared a side of the truffle fries - getting to be a clich but too good to pass up ... the truffle dipping sauce was out of this world. Dessert made the meal - we had a crazy concoction of peanut butter mousse, chocolate ganache, pretzel sticks and gooey caramel sauce.  It was like the pastry chef could see inside my sick, sick mind and made a dessert especially for me.

(Good mojitos too!) I had the filet, halibut, tuna, duck, trout, and they were ALL delicious! The pomme frittes with truffle oil sauce is a must try.  Their tomato salad is also delicious, and I don't even like salad! Last time I came, we tried everything on the dessert.. my fav is the one banana, two banana.  The cake and shake is a unique concept with a piece of cake and a tiny milkshake jug with a straw.  The last time I came here was for my bachelorette party dinner with 10 other girls. MK was so accommodating even though we were being loud and obnoxious on a Sat night.  They gave us EACH an amuse bouche of prosciutto and arugula (PLATTER), and the sous chef Stephen Jones also came out to talk to us.  Hopefully next time, Chef Michael Kornick can come out to greet us :)!  The best part was that for 11 girls, 2 bottles of wine and drinks, desserts, it was ~$60 per person.  MK is so reasonable and worth your money. I'll definitely be back. ********************* UPDATE: (2/2008) I've obviously been back since, and had the Winter Degustation menu.. I made reservations via OpenTable (since we're considered ""VIP"" now).  Not sure if it was b/c of that or not, but we got the best seats in the house on the balcony (it WAS a Monday night, but STILL!), and service was impeccable.  Our waiter throughout the night was led by Jorge, and he was SOO attentive and awesome.  We looked at the awesome wine list, I mean wine BINDER, and lo and behold, we see Rombauer on the menu -- a vineyard we visited in Napa..  It was a 1/2 bottle Zin and we had to order it   We ordered the scallops and truffle fries.  Before those came out, they brought out an amuse bouche (as usual) which was different prosciuttos -- duck, pork, beef, with fennel. It was so tasty!  We then had our scallops, which were by far one of the best I've had -- they cut it into smaller pieces, but the prepared it so well.  I'm not a huge fan of their truffle fries, but I had to order it b/c it was my husband's first time there.  I feel that their truffle fries tend to be a bit overcooked, and I prefer the ones at HB.  Anyway, onto the important stuff... the food there is consistently good.  This is one restaurant where I feel I can order anything, and it not only will be delicious, but it's rich in flavors (containing many layers and combinations of flavors), and each dish is really unique -- unlike each other, and unlike any dish that I've tried.  The degustation menu consisted of prawns, then monkfish, rare/med-rare duck breast (SO GOOOD.. one of the best duck dishes i've ever had, better than peking duck), and bison, also prepared medium rare.  I had the bison while my husband ate his ny strip, and the bison was SOOO tasty and flavorful - 10x more rich in texture and flavors than the steak! I could eat bison everyday if it were prepared this way!  In between all my dishes, Jorge and his staff were so attentive and brought out an extra plate and set of silverware so I could share my plates with my husband -- talk about service.  Later towards the night (while we were about to order dessert), our table next to us sent a round of prosecco. What a night!  We finished that with sorbet, to wash down all the meats we've devoured that day, and they brought out a plate of ""Congratulations"" cookies and a $25 gift certificate, all complimentary, b/c I mentioned that we were celebrating my husband's completion of part 3 of his CPA exam.

This man held court all night, shaking hands, posing for pictures, signing cards, giving cards out. If that does not a great dining experience make, I don't know what does. But seriously...MK...where do I begin? I ate at MK for the first time four years ago...and hated it.

But last night was remarkable...not great, but so much better than that first time. Here's my capsule review: MK is not going to change the world with its approach to food. It is typical fine dining fare -- the best hits of the fine dining world, well prepared but missing that certain something that separates a good restaurant from a great restaurant. In MK's case it is small details: a lack of textural contrasts on a plate; muddied flavors, buried under oils or butter or aioli; a piece of meat, not cooked to the correct temperature. The details are seemingly minor but make all the difference in the enjoyment of a meal. The staff is friendly and helpful -- in our case, when our server forgot a drink, she comped it and brought it out later. Wine service was careful and doting; the sommelier was unpretentious and concerned.  One note: I really disliked the ""Truffle Aioli"" that was served with the pomme frites...truffle oil and home made mayo are a horrible combination. The flavor contrasted with an earlier dish we ate that was made with fresh Perigord truffles -- they were mild, slightly earthy, and pleasant. The truffle flavor in the Aioli was punishing and sharp.  If there's one thing I wish restaurants would get rid of, it would be truffle oil. Hear me, MK?",0.9746,0.759,0.152,0.089,0.4888674388674389

It reminds me of the lofted space in DC Coast in Washington, DC.  As for food, the tuna was excellent; i've also had the halibut. If there is a weak point to the restaurant, it is the desserts - they are not ""to die for"" but they do have moscato for after dinner drinks so just get your sugar that way. :) UPDATE: Had dinner at MK recently. One of the only places that I ever get a good table (for some reason I get crappy tables at restaurants wherever I go) but I don't know if I'm going to be going back there for awhile. Business partner and I took our SO's there for a celebration of multiple things. As we were enjoying coffee and dessert, the manager of the restaurant told us there was another 4-top waiting for our table, they were very discriminating patrons and very specific about the table they want to sit in, so could we please leave and go to the bar. This after dropping over $500 which maybe isn't so much these days.  Admittedly, we were 30 minutes late for our reservations, but come on; asking people to leave?   I've referred MANY MANY people to MK for a special occasion, I may still but now it will be with a big fat asterisk.",0.9841,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.5532142857142857
2006-04-19,5.0,"MK has been around awhile, but I finally had the chance to try it (twice!) this past year. The ambience is very modern urban, but still warm and cozy. It has a real lofty feel with huge floor to ceiling windows and exposed brick. I haven't sat upstairs yet, but can imagine the view over the restaurant would be pretty cool.  Although they have a pretty eclectic menu, the NY strip my date had was still cooked to perfection with an amazing sweet reduction sauce. I've had the lamb, as well as the ahi tuna (I think here I preferred the ahi tuna if I had to choose). The starters were some of the best I've had as well: a salad with mango and cold lobster with a tangy vinaigrette was awesome as well as the butternut squash with brown butter and sage. Oh and the frites with white truffle oil are a standard. The one thing that still stands out is the bread/butter presentation - it's the creamiest butter I've ever had, and they give you a big square slab sprinkled with sea salt - yum!",0.9951,0.744,0.249,0.007,0.5678947368421053
2006-04-17,5.0,"Every time I eat here, it reaffirms that MK is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. From the service (two waiters per table) to the food, it is unbelievable. You're able to order a la carte off the tasting menu in addition to the regular menu. The fish is always fresh, meats are cooked perfectly, and the presentation is just beautiful. Desserts are also great - try the Cake'n'Shake or the Peanutbutter Cup.",0.9661,0.76,0.24,0.0,0.6564903846153847
