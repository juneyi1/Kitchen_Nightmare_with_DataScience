2008-05-31,5.0,"How sad I was to discover that my favorite Mexican restaurant had closed.  I moved to DC in August 2006 and from reading the reviews on Yelp I see that is when Platiyo took a turn for the worst. Like another reviewer, we always received such wonderful, personal service from the waiter/host with the thick black glasses.  The food was always great...especially the daily specials (mole) and brunch. I was always surprised how many people eat at El Jardin down the street (such bland, second-rate food).  I find Caesar's (at Belmont) food to be quite boring as well, but I understand the allure because of the monstrous margaritas. I will always remember Platiyo in their heyday -- around 2005!!",0.3441,0.864,0.082,0.054,0.5782679738562092
2008-02-07,2.0,"Platiyo, I'm glad theyre closed: I was reading the other reviews and thought perhaps that I had the wrong place. I did not find the service great. They were very slow and forgetful. The pop had a funny taste and the food was bland. I will give them credit for having different Mexican fare on the menu as opposed to the usual tacos and enchiladas that every other one of the hundreds of Mexican restaurants in the Chicago area has. I enjoyed seeing different items with interesting ingredients. The ambiance and decor was wonderful - artsy and more upscale than the typical decor in the other Mexican eateries.",0.9504,0.768,0.186,0.046,0.5126515151515151

2007-06-25,1.0,"Well I am tempted to give this establishment more stars because (a) I was DRUNK off mucho tequila, (b) my party of 8 didn't pay for anything and (c) it was actually damn amusing.  Well I made the reservation for 8 the week before for 9PM; we waited 45 minutes to be seated yet had margaritas in the process so it wasn't that bad. I have had 5 birthdays here collectively between my sister, myself (2 birthdays) and a friend and the experience was never this BAD. Hugo, the Manager did present 2 bottles of tequila as he always does. But looking around I am noticing more tables w/ bottles of tequila decorating their dinner-less tables; that's their trick. Not that I am complaining -- doing rounds of tequila shots helps get your mind off things but waiting 45 minutes for  a glass of wine then the waitress forgot to put our order in so they kept giving us things we didn't ordered but said to take them anyways since the table they were intended for had walked out due to the LONG WAIT.   We waited over two hours for appetizers which were awful and not done well but they did comp the entire bill and got me drunk on my birthday -- and isn't that the point of birthdays though.  As for a restaurant it's awful, for a bar -- not bad.. I think I have celebrated my last birthday here and I would recommend having no prior engagements if you choose to frequent Platiyos and planning on cabbing it or having a designated driver isn't a bad idea either.",0.3869,0.799,0.109,0.093,0.5641666666666667
2007-05-15,2.0,"I used to love this place.  When it first opened, we were so excited to go here and did so pretty regularly.  The food was always awesome with service to match, but in the last year it has just started to suck.   My last two experiences were unbearably miserable.  And that's coming from a overly-patient former server type.  The food and drink were fine, when we could get it.  The service however was some of the worst I've ever witnessed.  Likely won't be back.",-0.7035,0.742,0.12,0.138,0.5281135531135532

Second time, we came during winter and they had a mariachi group playing songs for people. I felt bad for the couple behind us - because they must have played eight songs for them, and when they're playing so close, you can't even hold a conversation over them. They came and played two songs for us, and then left, fortunately. The service was fast to the point of annoyance, I would take a drink of water, put it down, and it would be refilled ten seconds later.  All in all, there are way better options for Mexican in this city.",0.9556,0.785,0.177,0.038,0.38814814814814813

2007-02-13,3.0,"I can't say that this place is horrible,but it didn't win me over either.  Just status quo.  To preface, I grew up in South Texas and as a Homesick Texan I am always looking for the best enchiladas, corn chips, salsa, and flour tortillas....not the thick rubber kind you get in the midwest! Don't get me wrong I love Chicago, but they seriously lack in good TEX MEX which is different from regular Mexican Food.  Can't explain it-it just is.   I went with one of my girlfriends to catch up on the day's Hot Gossip of the death of Anna Nicole Smith.  The margaritas were good.  The chips were a tad stale, but still went well with my rita.  The service was nice and prompt and we did not have to wait forever for our food.  I got the vegetarian tostados which were just good.  None of the food blew me out of the water, but I wouldn't shy away from going again.",0.9286,0.753,0.161,0.086,0.5628582202111613

My burrito was drowned in this thick red sauce that if you ask me really had no flavor besides tomato paste. The service was really slow which was annoying since there was only us and one other couple in the whole place. Also, make sure you dress warm. The place was FREEZING. I mean I seriously felt like I was dining in an igloo. We were even sitting in front of the fire and were still cold.

2006-08-12,1.0,"My first BAD review that I'm posting -- Avoid this place now from this point forward -- they lost their chef, sometimes have their manager subbing for the current cooks who often do not show up (!??), and you will have waits that make Hell's Kitchen on FOX look good. Last time we were there, we waited over an hour after getting our margaritas (which were good -- there's the one star), before being told by our waiter for the 457th time that our appetizers (a soup and a salad!!!) were coming 'soon.' We got up and left. Forget it. With babysitters and time being precious, who needs to wait over an hour for a soup and a salad? And how long before entrees??? We went next door and pleaded with the nice folks at Mia Francesca (my wife Jacky's favorite restaurant in Chicago) for a table, and they mercifully obliged. That's where we found out the gory details from their staff (who shall remain nameless -- don't want to shoot the messengers)...the truth? nobody is running the Platiyo ship anymore. With a variety of Mexican and Latin restaurants in Chicago that would make ANY city in America jealous: Texas and California cities included, why should we all try to 'force' this restaurant to survive just because it once was good, and we want to 'will' it to be the same? Skip it -- go to the countless other restaurants worth the salt on their tortilla chips...",0.883,0.834,0.098,0.068,0.4833333333333334

2006-06-28,2.0,"I actually didn't have a great experience at Platiyo.  We went here for a Girls' Night Out, thinking, ""Ooo!  Tequila!  Margaritas!  A nice round table & some fun conversation!"" Well, we had made a reservation over a week in advance, even calling the day before to make sure it was still being held.  Yep, they assured us. When we got there, we waited for well over an hour for a table to open.  They were giving open tables to people sans reservations.  Riddle me this:  What's the point of having a reservation if it's not RESERVED? Finally we were seated in an extremely high traffic area.  Fine, whatever, at least now we were sitting down.  We got our drink order taken.  THIRTY MINUTES LATER, after flagging down our server twice, we finally got our first round of drinks & had to remind him to bring some chips & salsa.  We ordered our meals. ::for those of you out there keeping score, it's now 1.5 hours AFTER our reservation time:: Twenty minutes later, we got our chips, but without salsa. Five minutes later, salsa. By this time, we were finished with our first round of drinks. ::2 hours after reservation time:: One of the women in the party had to leave.  She had allotted two hours for dinner, thinking she'd leave time to order, eat, & have enough time to talk to the gals.  She had to run up the street to get fast food before she took off. Another woman in the party is a local sous chef.  She went up to the hostess & asked for a manager when, after another half hour, we still hadn't received our food & the server seemed to be ignoring our table. ::2.5 hours:: We finally received our food another half hour later after we threatened to leave (miraculously it appeared!) & really, was it worth the wait?  No.  Was it exceptionally tasty?  No.  Was it any better than any other Mexican restaurant that we could have gone to in that neighborhood?  No.  I mean, it was okay ... if I had a different experience & didn't have to wait so freaking long - ::3 hours:: - to get our food, I *may* come back, but with all the options available to us, I'd say that Girls' Night Out was a bust.",-0.5652,0.851,0.081,0.067,0.4290277777777777
