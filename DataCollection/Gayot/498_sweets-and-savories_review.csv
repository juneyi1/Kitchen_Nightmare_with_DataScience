There was no ""Welcome"" or ""Good Morning"" or nothing. We walked in and were seated.  So the food is okay. Not great and not outstanding.

Once our food came we were less than impressed.  The eggs Benedict that we both ordered was cold.  I felt like a small child pushing the food around on my plate so it appeared that I ate most of it as to not offend the lady.    By the end of the visit we could do nothing but laugh.  It's a Living Social rite of passage I guess.  I can only hope that my Yelp review will serve to give you other S&S patrons something to read during your long visit.",0.9163,0.838,0.094,0.068,0.5115740740740742

2011-07-24,1.0,"Nearly earned two stars for the comedy value alone!!! That seems to be their new business model; a dinner and comedy show, where the awful service and food IS the show. Seriously, if you decide to use your Living Social voucher, make sure to go expecting to laugh at the atrocity that is this place.  ***SHOW SPOILERS BELOW**** Joke is on you #1: Make reservation online! Yes, they'll TAKE your reservation online, but not HOLD the reservation. HAHAHA. Unless you call, their ""system"" doesn't update with online reservations. Hehe, haha.  Joke #2: Arrive to see empty tables, wait 20 minutes to sit! There are two ""servers"" and no hostess. Be sure to show up on time, see roughly 8 empty tables albeit with dirty dishware, and nobody attempting to clear them off. Instead, be told by Server 1 that he'll be with you in a minute, then 10 minutes later by Server 2 that it will be 15-20 minutes because the ""kitchen is backed up.""  Tip: Do not attempt to sit at a dirty table. Instead, stand by the door to do a little do-si-do near the hostess stand every time someone enters or leaves. Also, be sure to overhear the disturbed exclamations of the people that enter after you. Joke #3: Get seated ""over there,"" with used, paper menus, and order! Yes, we were directed by Server 1 to sit over there. Thanks, we'll laugh all the way to our seat. Oh, thanks also for the funny looking menu with a dollop of syrup. Although we had been perusing the menu while standing at the hostess stand for 15 minutes, sure, we'll wait 20 more to order. Tip: Read the recent reviews on yelp before ordering. Make sure to order something from the prix fixe menu that you think a five-year-old would be able to prepare adequately....and expect to receive everything you order. Joke #4 and highlight: Surprise! HAHAHA. Wait for the first option of the prix fixe menu -- a sampling of various pastries, but not get any. Rather, listen to the table next to you ask for the pastries and be told they have ""ran out."" Of course they have ran out, it's only 11:30 on Sunday, with a second wave of brunch-goers scheduled to arrive at 12:45. If your comedian is doing a good job, he'll probably have failed to mention that there were no pastries remaining when you ordered. Oh the hilarity! At least our bill should be reduced... Joke #5: Receive entree, watch wife eat one bite and be done! Okay, so I didn't share my tip above with my wife (I'm such a jokester). She instead ordered....a burger! Surely, that's not a food a 5-year-old could prepare well. She does make the wise decision to have it prepared without the pate spread.  HAHAHA, there it is! Atop the burger sat a large glob of pate spread! She smears it off, takes a bite of the burger but no more. I eat my most of my omelet because who could mess up an omelet? Wife offers me a bite of the burger several times, I decline every offer, then make an unwise decision. How bad could it be? Horrendous, rubbery and with a terrible aftertaste, but so funny! Secondary joke: Chuckle lightly when your server knocks the toast from your plate and on to the floor! Joke #6: Listen to Server 2 respond to irate customer over joke #1! Someone had the gall to show up to the restaurant expecting a nice French brunch and not a comedy show. I'll be honest, this was rather uncomfortable and I did not feel like laughing until after I left the restaurant.  That patron was dressed for church so perhaps she was not ready to laugh so early in the day.  Final joke....the joke is on them! Of course the Living Social voucher did not cover the whole bill. A cup of coffee is certainly not offset by the lack of pastries.

2011-07-18,1.0,"Sweets & Savories was so bad... How bad was it?...It was so bad that I almost didn't bother writing this review because I thought the restaurant might close before I could post it. Just incase you don't read until the end of my review, Sweets and Savories is so OVER PRICED... How over priced is it?... its so over priced the cheapest thing on the menu is a mediocre $17 hamburger that didn't even come with fries. Seriously you could dine most anywhere in the city for the prices they are charging.  In fact, the extreme prices offset any benefit the place being BYOB. When we arrived at Sweets & Savories there was already one couple waiting ahead of us in the tiny entrance hallway. The entrance is probably about 3 feet wide by 6 feet long.  When you walk in the door the hostess  stand is right in front of you like a barricade. The first problem is there was no hostess.  So we had to wait about 5 minutes before 1 of the only 2 people working in the front of the restaurant greeted us and checked us in for our reservation. She asked that we give her a minute to set a few tables. The restaurant has maybe 25 tables and 4 of them were empty when we arrived.  Being that they were covered in old napkins, used dishes, and empty bottles of wine, we obviously wouldn't be seated.  No one was clearing tables and the servers were making trip after trip back to the kitchen empty-handed.  There was no bus boy or any other employees working the front of the restaurant other than the 2 servers.  The tables just sat, vacant and dirty.  Even though the 2 servers were handling everything for 20 or so tables of guests, including drying glassware by hand, they didn't move with any sense of urgency.   We still were standing in the entrance area when 2 more couples walked in.  After a few more minutes, one of the servers checked them in for their reservations and asked them to wait while she cleared some tables.  By this point, 4 couples had shown up for their 8p reservations and it was now 8:30p and none of had been seated.  Seated patrons were trying to leave, but the servers were not taking payment in a timely fashion.  So guest after guest got up and brought their credit cards over to their server and an effort to speed the process.  Quite a few more tables had vacated, but they remained empty and dirty as we waited with all of our new friends in the tiny entryway.  We actually asked if we could sit down at one of the dirty tables just to make space in the entryway.  Our request was categorically declined.  It was so crowded in the tiny entryway that it reminded me of the scene in Animal House when the band gets detoured and walks into the dead end alley. We stood in the tiny entrance of the restaurant with 6 other people for 30 minutes surrounded by vacant, dirty tables and servers refusing to clean them.  Another table stood up to leave.  As the women patron walked by she said, ""Don't waste your time.  It's not worth it!""   Finally, we where seated.   Nearly 10 minutes passed and we still hadn't been visited by a server.  So we asked the server at the bar if we could have an ice bucket for our wine.  After all, the wine had been off ice for almost an hour longer than expected!  He said, ""Sure,"" but it still took another 5 minutes for him to refill and deliver the bucket that was sitting on top of the bar right next to our heads.  Shortly thereafter, our server came by and from that point on she took relatively good care of us.  One other thing that really bothered me was that the dirty tables where never cleared.  We sat next to used dishes and old napkins all night.  The place was just loaded with dirty tables, like little accidents all over the restaurant.! The Food - A Rip Off & Mediocre at Best We started with the mussels, priced at $10.  The dish arrived with a mere 6 mussels upon it.  My wife and I were stunned!  Even at a small plate restaurant, you would get a good pile of mussels for 10 bucks. Nearly $2 per mussel is truly a rip off.  That's more like oyster pricing!  Especially since the preparation was just a pile of pressed garlic, salt, and olive oil beneath the 6 mussels.  The garlic was so over powering that it actually burned your mouth like a pepper.  And to top it all off, they served the dish with stale, cheap-seeming French bread. I had the burger came on a jewel like bun and nothing else on plate and small. I ordered fries on the side total 22 bucks. tasted ok but so many other dishes I would get for that money other places. My wife had the lobster risotto.  It looked pretty lonely in the big, white bowl and was luke warm when it arrived. The presence of lobster was miniscule.  The flavor was good, but it tasted more of cheese rather than lobster.   Also, I don't think it was made fresh to-order, but scooped out of a pot then warmed in microwave because the center was hot like lava and the rest of the dish luke warm.

2011-07-17,1.0,"Normally when I write a one-star review, I do so eagerly.  I want to rip the proprietors of the restaurant a new one and do my part to ensure that no one else falls victim to the catastrophe that awaits within its doors.  However, when writing this review, I feel more sad than angry because I remember how good this restaurant used to be and could be again if anyone gave a f**k. The review itself is going to echo the sentiments of the vast majority of recent posters.  If I hadn't bought the (original) Groupon, I wouldn't have stopped in.  I was tempted to buy the latest Groupon; thank goodness I didn't. I love the look and feel of the restaurant; warm earth tones on the walls, comfortable chairs, tables nicely spaced, well lit - not too bright or too dark.  The location has been criticized by some, but I like it.  Free street parking is plentiful if you time it right. Now the bad part - the food.  Cucumber in the water is a very nice touch.  Bread and butter was served quickly.  The bread was old to the point of almost being stale.  An ominous portent of things to come. I chose the asparagus and green pea risotto as an appetizer.  I'm no expert on risotto by any means, but I enjoyed it.  However, there was no asparagus in the dish that I could discern.  The presentation left something to be desired.  I'm not a stickler for such things, but the plate looked like a lunch lady at a cafeteria spooned the risotto out of a tray and plopped it into a bowl. I picked the seafood stew as my entree.  To all future customers of this restaurant, DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH!  Menu description - Seafood Stew, Mussels, Scallop, Salmon, New Potatoes, Lobster Tomato Broth.  Two medium sized mussels, a small scallop sectioned into three or four pieces, and a couple of small pieces of diced salmon a starving cat would have been hard pressed to find.  The dish consisted almost entirely of potatoes.  They weren't new potatoes, they were russets.  Russets that were on the verge of rotting.  I've cooked several potatoes that were almost rotten to avoid throwing them out.  They have an unpleasant aftertaste which was noticeable in this dish.  It was a disgrace and never should have been served.  I informed my server of this.  He apologized.  I didn't expect the restaurant to do anything about it, especially since I was a Groupon user. Pear tart with vanilla ice cream was my dessert.  Jewel or Dominick's, that is the question?  Definitely store bought.  Note to the owner:  if you're going to buy store bought ice cream, could you at least buy the better stuff? Service was good.  I could go on a lengthy diatribe about FOH service, staffing issues and telephone difficulties, but this review is long enough and these points have been brought up by others.  I was surprised to find a hostess AND server working simultaneously.  I tried eating here earlier in the week only to be rebuffed, and it seemed like only one person was working in the dining room. Groupon should never have agreed to another deal given the tenuous status of this restaurant and the volume of complaints I'm sure they received over this deal.  I recommend to those who did purchase the latest deal that they get their money back now or wait until the restaurant closes for good to get a refund.  I cannot see this business staying open through the end of the year unless drastic moves are made. One last thing - none of my food was cooked to order.  The food came out so quickly, my head was spinning.  The seafood stew was finished in - wait for it - the microwave!  (I could tell because some of the shards of scallop had an uneven temperature.)  I was in and out of the restaurant in just over half an hour!  I like to eat quickly, but that is ridiculous! I used to really like this restaurant.  I wasn't as mad as I should have been because the money I paid for this substandard meal was spent long ago.  If I had to pay out of my pocket or pay full price, I would have been livid.  I've read about the troubles here on Yelp and elsewhere, but I didn't fully grasp the magnitude of the problems until I dined here myself.  I feel bad that this place has fallen so far.  This is one time where I hope a one-star business can somehow resurrect itself to its former stature.  I'm not holding my breath.",0.7884,0.792,0.109,0.099,0.5603966100234755
2011-07-15,2.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this place. My boyfriend and I decided to finally make it out and use the groupon we had bought last year. I called ahead in the afternoon to make a reservation only to get a voicemail telling me to leave a message to make a reservation, I was a bit skeptical but followed instructions anyway. We arrived at our supposed 7:30 reservation to a less than half full restaurant with two serves frantically running around, only to be told that they had been booked for a week and we didn't have a reservation (thanks for the heads up) but we could come back at 8:30 as they had a few cancellations. Since our groupon was expiring, we felt we didn't really have a choice. They do not have any sort of a waiting area so we had to just kill time for an hour. We arrived back at S&S at 8:20, to again, a half full dining room and asked if we could possibly be seated a few minutes early. We were told by one of the servers/busers/hostesses (the 2 girls were doing everything) that they were experiencing a ""rush"" so we could sit down but would have to wait a few minutes to be waited on, assuming this meant only until our actual reservation time, we took a seat which by the way was entirely too close to the couple next to us and lacked any privacy at all. As someone who has previously worked in the food service business, 10 2-tops for 2 servers is not a ""rush"", but anyway... 30 minutes went by without a server even acknowledging us and taking our order (she came over at 8:50). While their menu did sound very unique (I really wanted to try to Lobster Risotto or the Lamb Shank), I was really hesitant to spend any more money than I already had spent on this place after the reviews I had read on hear and the service we had received up until this point. We were taken aback by the over priced menu- $17 for chicken and mashed potatoes??? 15 minutes later, we had to ASK for bread, which by the way was NOT homemade but store bought, most likely from Costco or Dominicks. We waited a total for 30 minutes for our food, an hour after we were sat.  The reason I gave the restaurant a 2 instead of a 1- the food really wasn't bad. Even though we just got the chicken, all other aspects of the evening aside, I did enjoy the chicken, the gravy was quite good, however the mashed potatoes might have been from a box- they lacked any sort of creamyness. Also, I will say S&S is a really cute place. Had the bread and mashed potatoes been homemade, the servers more attentive, and the ambiance better (they had the lights turned up like we were at Denny's and a radio station playing Adele and Coldplay instead of French or even more evening type music). Honestly, all they needed to do was hired a third person to work with them- be it a busser or another server- whatever. While this is a small place, they were incredibly understaffed (2 servers and 1 chef) or else stop selling groupons. They are not prepared to handle the volume of business a groupon brings, which by the way, there was another one today... When we purchased this groupon, they had decent reviews, but unfortunately because of their lack of preparedness all of the recent reviews as terrible. Unfortunately, I would say, don't waste your time. Lacks ambiance, attentive service, and quality food.

The portion sizes were small. I wonder if they just doubled the prices of everything for the groupon. We had dinner at 6pm. We were offered nothing to drink besides our cucumber water.  My mother had to ask for a diet code and then both of us were never asked again.

2011-07-15,1.0,"I am not sure that I've ever had such a bad restaurant experience.  I went to S&S last night to use a groupon. I'd been there before, but since the last time, they've changed their menu to be prix fixe. However, when using a groupon, you can't get the prix fixe meal. Which is fine, except everything is priced ala carte and is still portioned like it would be for a prix fixe meal. For instance, the $10 mussel appetizer only has 6 mussels.  But, the mussels were at least tasty. And even though I had to keep asking for extra bread to dip in the mussels (which apparently can only be doled out in 3 inch segments), this was not horrible.  I ordered the lamb shank with couscous and my husband ordered the steak and frites. He asked if the fries could be replaced by a veggie and was told... ""we really don't have any veggies... "" WHAT???!?!? How is that possible?  I get my lamb-- it is fine. It is not $34 worth of fine. It is literally just the shank sitting on top of 3/4 cup of plain (if not slightly crunchy) couscous. Nothing in the couscous, no flavor, no veggies (well, they don't actually have veggies here) nothing. And no side dish. Definitely not $34 worth of food.  My husband's medium rare steak is shoe leather. He asks the waitress if this is his, since he ordered his medium rare. She says there must have been confusion in the kitchen and offers to bring another one. She returns with a steak that looks more like seared ahi tuna. It is inedible. But, she does not check in on us again until she needs to give us our check.... even though we are seated at the table right next to the kitchen.  When she finally returns, she looks at the sad uneaten steak sitting in front of my husband and asks, ""did you not like the steak?"" He says no, neither were properly prepared. She resond...""gosh, that's too bad."" While she does offer to comp us dessert, a better offer would be to have taken the $34 uneaten steak off of our bill. She does not offer to do that. We leave. We will not be returning.  There was a time that S&S was a nice little neighborhood place.

First let me say that I used to love this place. My wife and I often go to Facets & I was there THE DAY this place first opened. Walked through the door...the chef came out and greeted us with some freshly made chocolates. I came back, and back, and back to S&S. I LOVED the Kobe Burger. In short, if you haven't gotten it yet...I was hooked. Yeah...Sweets and Savories USED to be a 4-5 star. Lately though, not so much. I've been there twice in the past 2 months. Bread...day or two old. Apps...uninspired. Meat...overcooked. Both times, I've been willing to forgive. What REALLY killed it for me was the dessert. I ordered the pear tart, and it was delivered to the table frozen like a brick with some pretty glaze dribbled on the side. This place used to be famous for its desserts; now they're just phoning it in to be honest. What doubly killed it for me was the service. S&S used to have, even if I was unsatisfied with a meal, some pretty darned good service. That's gone. When I complained about the tart (which I want to be very clear about...I didn't take more than a couple of bites of), the waitress said ""well, it's made fresh."" BS, BS, BS, BS, BS. No offer to replace, no offer to comp, no lie. It might be made fresh (in house...in some factory), who knows/cares? It was frozen when it was delivered to me. Why do I finally write after these many years? I saw another Groupon today for Sweets & Savories. Yeah, I'll pass thanks. You should too.

2011-07-14,2.0,"Sorry Sweets and Savories - I was not impressed. I visited Sweets and Savories recently with a groupon and my first experience began with attempting to make a reservation.....""Please leave a message..."" ""mailbox full"".  Seriously?  Either there are hundreds of people attempting to leave reservation messages, or they never check their mailbox.  Thankfully, after my 3rd try, I got a real person and made a reservation.... I was seated promptly upon arrival even though my entire party wasn't there (which was nice - THANK YOU!).  However, even though my wine was taken to be chilled, and water brought, I didn't get greeted otherwise.  No one came to ask if I wanted to order an appetizer, or open my wine, they just ignored me for 15 minutes.  Then, one friend showed up (still no one came back), and it wasn't until the 3rd person (out of 4) came that anyone sort of wandered by the table.  We flagged him down to try and order (and get our wine). Finally, we ordered....I started with tomato/bread soup, which was pretty good.  It was the consistency of marinara (which they warned me about), and was tasty, though, not spectacular.  Next up was the burger.  The burger sounds delicious on the menu - but for $17, I expect a side dish!  This was a little, lost burger on a plate.  And, $17???  With NO fries?  Seriously?  I ordered them separately (for another $7 - really?).  I was super disappointed with this - I can go to the Four Seasons hotel and get a burger WITH fries for this price.  Also, the burger wasn't that good.  It was ok, but not great.  Coming from someone who eats burgers all over the city, this one wasn't one to come back for.  Food - 2, Value - 1 One friend had salmon, which she stated was a bit overdone.   Service, while friendly, was so slow.  We had to not only flag someone down to order as mentioned, but we had to find the server behind the bar to get our bill.  It took 2 hours to eat dinner, and it should have taken less time.  This may be because there seemed to be only 2 people working the entire restaurant.  They were very very nice, but very busy and a bit frazzled.  Service - 2. The atmosphere is nice, though it's a bit of a squeeze walking through tables.  The bathrooms were clean and ok.  Bathrooms and atmosphere - 3.   I was so disappointed as I really had been wanting to visit here and I didn't have a great experience.",0.9736,0.782,0.131,0.088,0.5670617283950615
2011-07-13,1.0,"The recent yelp reviews are pretty accurate on what this restaurant has become. Even after reading the horrible reviews, we had to use our groupon so we made a reservation and came in to eat. We probably should have just ate the groupon worth but I wanted to give this place a chance so we both ordered appetizers with our entrees. The bread is like the reviews say. It looks like some old bread from Dominicks. I mean, I even like bread from Dominicks... when it's fresh. This looked like it was a couple days old and they cut a strip of butter and slabbed it on the plate. I mean... come on...  I got the Wild Mushroom Polenta Gnocchi. Three things that I love. Unfortunately it was luke warm and just disappointing. I smelled something burnt and noticed it was my gnocchi . They tried to hide it under a massive amount of gravy that was surprisingly flavorless. $9 for three pieces of gnocchi... hmm. skip. I was scared from all the bad reviews so I decided to get the New York Strip. It came on a generous bed of fries that was quite nice. The steak itself however was medium to well-done despite my medium rare request. The outside was barely seared so I'm wondering if they just decided to steam it.... The ""sauce"" on top had a strange aftertaste and i had to wipe it off. All in all, for a steak worth $26, I should have just gone to the market and gotten myself a Filet Mignon because I could have cooked it much better than this. My bf got the lobster risotto.  That was actually kind of decent but it was the first and only time I've ever said, ""man... that's a little TOO much butter.""

My only two complaints - first, it was difficult to try to make a reservation.  I called multiple times and left a message, but no one picked up.  I tried to make a reservation online, and the site said it worked, but I never entered the number in our party, so I don't know if it actually did anything.  However, we decided to just head up there anyway even though we weren't sure about whether we had a reservation, and were seated right away...There were only about three or four tables full for an 11am Sunday brunch, which was odd, but worked for us!  The second issue is although the staff was incredibly friendly, they were also a little bit slow.  This didn't bother us too much, as we didn't have any other place to be, but it might cause an issue for some.  Since I've only been there once, though, it could have been an anomaly of the day, or partially due to the fact that shortly after we arrived, a rude and needy birthday party was making a lot of demands of the staff.  Regardless, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and we'll be heading back for sure!",0.9794,0.773,0.15,0.077,0.528291446208113

Every time we had house guests, we took them here. Last night, we took a house guest there to share one of our favorite spots. To my despair, there were dead flies, live mature and immature flies on the windowsill. Alas, that was not the low point in the evening. To start, we were greeted with overused, wrinkled, dirty, menus. The server seemed unconcerned about our uninvited guests. We tried to put a good face on it, for our guest, made our selections and waited for our wonderful dinner to begin. The starters were not up to par with our many previous visits. The risotto was a luke warm, mass of goo. No flavor, missing any of the care that was taken in the past. The gnocchi was awful. It did not taste like anything. There were virtually no mushrooms, it was also barely luke warm. The mussels were sad, 6 for 10$ sitting on an ""sauce"" of chopped, undercooked garlic. Wow.....but it only got worse.  I always order the scallops and goat cheese grits, and did so this time. What I got, for $24, was 1 scallop cut into 3 pieces on a mountain of grits overcooked and rubbery. At this point, I had to say something and sent it back. My husband ordered the $17 burger, cooked medium, it came out passed well done...it was cold and hard as a rock. He was too hungry to wait for a replacement. After 15 minutes the entree returned, only slightly better than it's first visit. So sad, after spending $115 I was embarrassed. Our guest tried to be nice, but had a terrible time and felt badly that we had spent so much money on such a bad experience. S&S, you lost us for good.",-0.9222,0.779,0.091,0.13,0.5805555555555555
2011-07-11,1.0,"Groupon or not, this was one of the worst, if not THE worst, dining experience of my life.  I had wanted to try this place since it opened and got such rave reviews, so I jumped on the Groupon offering.  My mistake! I called on Friday night at 9pm to make a  Saturday reservation; got the voicemail, which was full.  Tried again at 9:45, got a person who was very helpful making a reservation for 5pm on Saturday.   I arrived at opening.  The host/server was very helpful and professional.  I was seated and given water with a cucumber slice; nice tough.  The original server did not have my table, so a friendly woman answered my questions and took my order.  She also brought bread and butter.  This is where things went downhill. 1.  Bread and butter:  lowest grade baguette slices; probably from Dominick's or Jewel.   2.  Appetizer 1 (brought simultaneously with Appetizer 2, FYI):  Mussels in wine sauce:  the $10 portion consisted of SIX (6) mussels, one of which was closed and inedible.  Appalling to have $2 mussels!  The sauce was mostly jarred garlic. 3.  Appetizer 2:  Polenta gnocchi with wild mushroom ragu on a fontina fonduta for $9:  The three (3) gnocchi were dense and flavorless.  There were FOUR (4) pieces of mushroom (that's PIECES, not whole mushrooms), and they were domestic button mushrooms, not wild (I'm a biologist and cooking instructor, so I know my mushrooms), and lacked the flavor promised by wild mushrooms.  The fonduta was thickened with raw flour, and was very unpleasant. 4.  Entree:  Scallops over goat cheese grits with a green pea nage:  My server said this entree came with 3-4 scallops, for $24; pricey, but could be appropriate if done well.  What I got were three PIECES of scallop, and I'm sure one large scallop was battered (amateur move), pan-seared, then split in half, and one half was again halved to give three pieces.  Only one side of each piece was seared, and two of the pieces had SQUARED edged!  Again, as a biologist, I know scallops don't come in that shape naturally, so they were manipulated in the kitchen.  While the scallops were hot, the goat cheese grits were lukewarm; leftover?  And the green pea nage was a puree, not a nage.  AND NOTHING HAD FLAVOR!  Even the scallops had no scallop flavor.  VILE AND DISGUSTING for $24! Tax was calculated on the pre-Groupon discount, which is illegal.   So, with tax and a tip on the full ""value"" of the food, I was out another $20, when the three dishes I received weren't worth $20 in the first place.   If you haven't used your Groupon, don't.  If you don't have a Groupon, just stay away.  This place should just shut its doors and quit insulting people.",-0.9833,0.866,0.04,0.094,0.5323420731315469

2011-07-07,1.0,"Being in the trade, my girlfriend and I were looking forward to this dining experience, but ultimately were very disappointed. The food was merely passable and, although the service was very good, the portions are small and, overall, the menu doesn't justify the price.  We began by ordering a salad and a wild mushroom/gniocci appetizer. Both arrived in timely fashion, but we were surprised by the scanty portions. Three very small gniocci ($9) were pan seared to a perfect outer crunch with a chewy center, accompanied by a few wild mushroom bits in a creamy sauce that was delicious, but left us wanting more.  We actually sent back the arugula salad, commenting that the meager handful of greens with a sprinkling of grated parmesan on top was hardly worth the $9 dish we expected.  The server was very gracious about taking the salad back and removing it from our bill, however that was only the beginning of a series of mis-steps on the restaurant's part. The lobster risotto ($18) entree arrived first, soon followed by the seafood stew ($22.) The risotto was very creamy, flavorful and the sauce was well balanced, but the chef missed on the rice, which should've been a little more ""al-dente"". Not a bad dish, but the lack of lobster chunks made the price a bit ridiculous, even though the portion was right. The seafood stew was another matter entirely. The plate arrived with 90% potato chunks and only 2 mussels with some very tiny bits of a nondescript scale fish. We were getting a little angry by this point, feeling like we'd made a really bad decision. This was completely unacceptable, so we had a little talk with the waitress, expressing our concern. We asked her to have the potato and seafood ratio reversed and we were very clear about having her tell the chef that we were really unhappy. The waitress was unflinching and a real sweetheart about it....we made sure to compliment the good things, especially her service. In 10 minutes, she brought out a revised dish.  It would've been fine, but even the revision was hopeless. Yes, the seafood portion was adjusted properly, but what a lackluster flavor! The sauce was too new--it hadn't had an opportunity for the herb and spice flavors to meld, so the acidity was very noticeable and ruined the whole thing.  Again, not to take away from the service...our waitress was good-natured and efficient and came by to check on us frequently, but there was no point in saying anything more about the entrees. After dinner, we shared a fallen chocolate souffle cake with a raspberry sauce drizzle for dessert, which was good, not great.   When the bill arrived, we were reminded once again of the owner's greed. We had a Groupon for $40, which was deducted from our total, however, tax was added prior to the discount, which is a huge no-no!! According to the law, a business cannot tax on amounts they haven't collected. We brought this up to the waitress and she told us they always add the tax to the retail amount. We showed her the link on our smartphone with contrary information regarding this issue. Instead of re-running my credit card for the proper amount, she stuck a five dollar bill in the check folder and said, ""I hope it's alright if I just give you the cash back."" At that point, we were concerned that she'd taken the $5 out of her own pocket just to be rid of the problem. Of course, we tipped her on the pre-discounted bill, but we did it with cash because we thought the owner might not give her the full tip if we put it on the credit card. Given everything else he skimped on, why should we believe he'd be fair with his servers? We'd give this restaurant a big ZERO for number of stars...if only we could!

I had the lobster risotto and my friend had the pork tenderloin. The lobster risotto came out lukewarm at best so I asked them to heat it up for us. I tasted my friends pork tenderloin and I am pretty sure that the pork tenderloin was not made fresh for his dinner. I really felt that it was leftover from the night before and reheated. After my risotto came out cold, I wondered the same thing about it...a reheat from prior night. We were very disappointed!

I have been there twice now in the last month (yes, I know: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice...), and both were deja vu experiences of disaster. For starters, the restaurant has a staff of ONE.  So when we walked into the relatively abandoned joint (2 tables our first time; 6 tables our second), the host was also the waiter, who was also the receptionist, who was also the bus boy, who was also the cashier.  And I'm not totally convinced that this jack-of-all-trades was not also quintupling as the cook, since the clanking noises of cookware from the nearby kitchen may have very well been caused by the proverbial tumbleweeds rolling through.   The service was sub-par, and that's taking into consideration his multi-tasking.  It's BYOB, so there is no real motivation for the restaurant to let tables continue to sit and drink away.  Both times, we weren't even approached with so much as a bottle opener for 15 minutes. To be honest, the food wasn't that bad.  I had the steak frites the first time, and it was actually good.  I had the burger the second time, and that was decent too, but no better than Five Guys.  But for $17 ($10 on Wednesdays), the burger, bun, and a sprinkle of duck pate is all you get.  It doesn't come with fries or any other sides, and don't even think about asking for cheese, because apparently it qualifies as neither a ""sweet"" nor a ""savory.""   But still, if you're a foodie and simply want to check this place out, then I have one recommendation (other than to recommend you against it): Hurry, because those ""tick...tock"" sounds are getting louder.",0.299,0.879,0.064,0.057,0.39824016563146997

I got the wild mushroom and fontina cheese omelet which was very tasty and well made. My boyfriend got the Breakfast Risotto which we both thought was fantastic! Very rich, made with pancetta, cheese served with poached egg on top. It was cooked very well, which is hard to do when making risotto, and the flavors (while very rich) came together perfectly. I really enjoyed this place.

The food wasn't anything to brag about, but it also wasn't horrible.  The waiters were attentive and humorous, and you could really tell they were trying to make it a good experience.   We had NO trouble using our voucher, and only had to pay the additional $4 for tax.  All in all, not something I would want to pay $32, but was definitely worth the $16 for both of us.",0.9432,0.751,0.164,0.084,0.5901041666666667

Several people walked in without reservations and were turned away. There were only two waiters, so we waited a bit for a waiter to come over to take our order.  The brunch menu was prix fixe. We ordered coffee. The waiter brought us a plate of pastries, which consisted of a cinnamon roll and two blueberry muffins. The blueberry muffin I had was tasty and not dry at all. I also had the butternut squash soup, which was amazing followed by the salmon hash, which was lovely. My husband had the salad and the French toast, which he liked. We ordered a side of bacon and a fruit salad. Everything was great. I was expecting a terrible experience based on the previous reviews, but it was anything but.  After the voucher, we paid $12 for our two extra sides.

2011-03-22,1.0,"Short story: Couldn't get reservation until 11, but place was empty; Groupon not honored; waitress was very professional, but manager was downright hostile; sweets were dry and nasty. We got up and went to Toast and had a delicious meal. S&S: 1st restaurant we've walked out of in ages.  I never like giving 1 stars. Hell, I'd much rather give a 3 star and hope it was an off night. You really have to deserve a 1 star. S&S? 1 star.  I echo what other people have mentioned: it appears this place has gone downhill very quickly due to money problems. The Groupon may be a bait-and-switch....watch out! And the manager made things much, much worse. We called on Friday to make a reservation using our Groupon for Saturday brunch. Not a problem. The hostess informed us that their first available table was 11am and that Saturdays were extraordinarily busy. Having heard about the popularity of S&S, coupled with a groupon, we could completely understand. Running errands that morning, we popped in around 9:30 to see how crazy the place was. There was nobody. The manager had just gotten off the phone telling the caller that they were packed and to show up around 12pm (Red Flag #1) and asked us for our reservation. After 5 minutes of searching, the waitress took over and seated us near the windows. Very attentively, she asked us for our beverage orders and informed us we could do either ""fixed price"" or ""a la carte."" Looking around, S&S was an odd assortment of classy dining furniture along with run down walls desperately needing a repaint and sparsely hung paintings. The menus were wrinkled up cheap paper quickly printed with a number of errors while the tables had crisp paper and linens. Very odd. The pastries arrived with our coffees. They were chalk. I kid you not. Chalk. Handling them, they began to disintegrate (Red Flag #2). Read other reviews - this is a recent trend with S&S. Looking over the menu, we began to wonder how squash soup was ever a brunch item and if the duck liver pate burger would be as succulent as it sounded...maybe we should stick to something safe like the bacon risotto? (Why was this a dinner menu?) We moved on to ordering and informed the waitress that we had a groupon. She immediately said, ""they can't be used for brunch."" We showed her on the groupon that it said ""cannot be used on Sunday or fixed price"" and that we'd order a la carte. She smiled politely and said, ""I'll get the manager. I'm so sorry."" The manager came over and asked what the problem was. ""Well, we have a groupon and...""  ""Nope. You cannot use a groupon for Saturday brunch."" ""It says on the groupon no Sunday brunch."" ""No, no it doesn't. It says it very clearly. I've read it. Saturday brunch - no groupon! Anything else?"" Ok, look. At this point, had she said, ""I'm sorry. That was a misprint"" we would have said ""no worries - screw the groupon"" and stayed for brunch. But she had rushed over to our table, quickly become extremely defensive, and started to border on hostile for no reason. Add to it the red flags, we pushed. ""Actually, here's the groupon, ma'am. What are we missing? And when we called yesterday, why were we told it was fine?"" She skimmed it several times, continually re-reading out loud Sunday...Sunday...Sunday brunch before blurting out, ""Fixed Price. Saturday. That's all we serve on Saturday. No groupon. You need to read the fine print better.""  ""But we were informed you also do a la carte this morning...."" ""No. Saturday is fixed price. That's it. And no using your groupon. Or else we'd owe you money. Fine print, gentlemen."" And promptly left our table with us stunned. The waitress came back over - continuing to be extremely professional. ""I am so sorry about that. Do you need a moment?"" We told her no - we would be leaving - and would like to pay for the coffees. ""Don't worry about it. This happens a lot. No bill."" We thanked her and walked out, never to return. Seated at Toast in Lincoln Park, the difference was night and day. We got a table in 10 minutes, the place was packed, and the food was excellent. Save yourself the heartache and wait in line for Toast. Manager? If this ""happens a lot"" where people walk out angry, what is happening? 1 star.",-0.9924,0.795,0.072,0.132,0.45731968810916185

Up to today we've been fans of S&S, especially brunch.  We've brought family and friends and even considered having a shower here.  S&S was a regular on our brunch rotation so I was like a giddy little school girl when I saw a Living Social for its prix fixe brunch.  It had been a couple of months since we had been there, so we were totally excited about the reservation we made for Sunday. Certificate in hand we entered S&S and were seated at a nice table by the bar.  My boyfriend uncorked our bubbly as we waited anxiously for the delicious tray of sweets that is included with the brunch.  Our waitress set down a plate of treats that lacked the usual goodies we've enjoyed at S&S.  The amazing coffee cake along with the scone and palmier - gone.  The updated treats included a small blueberry muffin, cinnamon roll and a couple small, dry cinnamon pastries.  In unison, my boyfriend and responded much like Scooby Doo, ""Dha-whaaa?""  The muffin was dry and the cinnamon roll (usually awesome) was quite average (I think the kind you can buy in the can at the grocery store are better!). The menu was also a disappointment.  A number of our faves had been removed, including the lobster hash.  I understand that lobster is a seasonal item, but we got the feeling that the menu had been ""tweaked"" for the release of the Living Social certificate.  We decided on the following: Arugula Salad- We both ordered the salad and felt it was way underdressed.  Tasted like a plate full of plain ole' arugula. Eggs Benedict - Had to send it back because my poached eggs were ice cold.  The English muffin was also on the soft side (could have used a minute or so more toasting). Risotto - Terrible.  My boyfriend turns to me and asks ""is risotto supposed to look like this?""  As he is asking the question he scooped out a spoonful of the mystery meal in his bowl, turned his spoon upside down and shook it back and forth.  Look out Gorilla Glue; you've got some competition in town.  Needless to say, he sent it back.   Both our waitress and the manager didn't seem surprised by our complaints.  They offered to take my boyfriend's meal off of our bill but it was a moot point as we were using the BOGO Living Social.   We both bought 2 of the Living Social certificates and we've decided to return the unused ones.  S&S has taken serious turn for the worse and we believe it's started the downward spiral towards a serious decline.  As our previous review lauded S&S, we wanted to let ya'll know that something very, very different is going on here....something I don't care to partake in again",0.5095,0.869,0.072,0.059,0.5177342633725613
2011-03-21,3.0,"I really, really wanted to like this place. I recall coming here a few years back for dinner and seem to remember that it was good. Well, yesterday we arrived with our Living Social deal in hand to get the pre-fix brunch for two.  The restaurant is completely under-decorated. In fact, other than a few oddly placed pictures and posters, the place might as well be as barren as a barn. We were seated towards the back and within 5 minutes of arriving another couple was seated at the table next to us. The tables were about 6 inches apart and needless to say, our conversation was apparently too loud for our neighbors because they promptly asked to move. Now sitting somewhat alone, we were served with the pastry plate. Dry and ostensibly stale cinnamon rolls, over-cooked mini blueberry muffins and some sort of mini, mini elephant ear pastry. After getting our coffee, the pastries went down a little easier but we had to ask our waiter twice for the coffee cream. I next had the arugula salad which was nothing more than arugula leaves, undressed, with shaved cheese. I notice several tables where whoever ordered the same salad just couldn't finish it. I like the peppery greens so I wolfed them down. My husband had the squash soup but what an odd food choice on a warm mid-march morning. The cinnamon, squash combination is reserved for winter in my mind. It tasted just alright.  I finished off breakfast with a mushroom omelette and it was quite good. It didn't come with toast and I ordered a side of it for $3 extra. Too bad it's only ONE piece of toast for $3. The hubby had some potato, asparagus and salmon dish with a poached egg. He didn't seem a fan at all. He also had the $3 toast piece on the side.  After our discount, we paid $7.50 for just two pieces of toast. What a rip off.

2011-03-19,2.0,"My wife and I have long been fans of Sweets and Savories. We've taken many out-of-town guests there, including a couple larger groups. Sweets has always impressed with their warm service and excellent value. Also, while I'm sure David Richards has earned much of the bad ink spilled about him, in our experiences he has always been gracious and generous, comping us a plate or a dessert on a number of occasions. The prices have increased, but I always felt that the value was so good that we weren't deterred by the increase to 36 dollars for three courses.  So I take no joy in writing about how far they've fallen. To start off we ordered the mussel appetizer, the pea and mushroom risotto, and the polenta gnocchi (I always sub an app for a dessert). The mussels were rubbery and their sauce tasted of uncooked wine, we could barely finish it. The risotto featured flavorless, clearly frozen peas, and a lifeless white sauce that drowned the risotto into a bland, mushy pile. The gnocchi had decent texture, but the butter sauce was unremarkable. Sadly, this mediocre offering was the highlight of the meal. Then came the entrees. The butter-poached lobster risotto, something we've ordered at least 5 times before, had a fraction of the lobster we're used to and was identical in flavor and texture to the risotto we had as an appetizer. My wife was visibly shocked by how much worse the lobster risotto was than before. The pork tenderloin was served cold with a from-the-bottle quality, cloyingly sweet barbecue sauce and a dense, hard, corn cake that was cold like it came straight from the refrigerator. This one we couldn't finish. When the waitress came to ask how the meal was, we could barely muster a kind response. We begrudgingly ordered the meyer lemon tart for dessert. It tasted like it was bought at the Jewel down the street. I sincerely hope this doesn't mark the end for one of our favorite restaurants. Perhaps they've had some turnover in the kitchen after their hiatus in late January.

First thing I noticed: the brunch prix fixe is now $16, not $14 as previous. No biggie, I had always thought $14 was super cheap for such great food. But... It was not awesome today. Pastries were okay, not as good as I've had before, maybe even a little stale.

I may not be the gourmand of gourmands, but I'm pretty sure most people would notice the difference between butternut squash and tomato soup.  Anyway, I had eggs Benedict for the second course - fine, nothing super special.

Def make reservations though and it's not a big place at all. They serve you cucumber water with your brunch, some pastries and a choice of a few different little starters...I chose the salad. Then the main entree came out which the chef himself served us! He explained the dish which makes it all that much more fun. I got the brunch risotto and I had never had anything like that. I am a risotto junkie...totally addicted and love them so when I saw this unique one with egg yolk and bacon in it I had to try it.

Service was SLOW (took 1 hour for our entrees to come out after we ordered!!!), our appetizer order was taken down wrong, our soup entree came out lukewarm, BUT everything else was ""decent"".  Bread basket would've been awesome if the bread was hot and the butter wasn't rock hard, but hey, there's beauty in simplicity too I guess. Mussel appetizer was highlight of the evening. For $9, we had at least a dozen mussles cooked to perfection. Swimming in a white wine, onion, garlic, butter, and cream broth, we actually asked for extra bread to soak up the sauce! Red and yellow beet salad - we asked for no goat cheese but the waiter forgot. The salad was small, only 3 chunks of beets and they seemed to have forgotten the yellow beets. :(  Seafood stew - was not a stew...it was a brothy soup.the portion size was no bigger than the appetizer mussels. While flavorful, there was literally a 1oz piece of fish, half a scallop, and 5 mussels. Pricey for the amount of food you get for sure. Burger - The truffle mayo was the highlight of the burger. They could have used additional toppings...CHEESE being one of them.  Frites  on the side - delicious! Hot, perfectly fried, well-salted.

How can a French restaurant make changes to their menu and remove French Onion Soup and the French tart? It was replaced by Roasted Cauliflower that they didn't have nor the French Lavendar Trout,nor the Milk Chocolate Walnut Pie. Their excuse? New Years Eve. If you can't restock your refrigerator, don't open the restaurant. The soup was celery root..tasteless. The steak was tough. Very disappointed. I won't return.

Lo and behold, there was a mandatory prix fixe...an $80 one! Now, if I'm going to spend $80 on a meal, it's not going to be at Sweets and Savories. There are just so many other places where I'd rather spend that amount. Besides that, when one of our group went to haggle with the waiter, there was no attempt at trying to work out an understanding. The restaurant was half empty as it was, and we thought they'd be more interested in knocking some money off the price tag in order to keep our business. Well, were we ever wrong! At one point, the waiter called my friend that made the reservation a liar because she wasn't aware of the prix fixe. Supposedly everyone who reserved received phone calls confirming the $80 meal (she did not). And supposedly, the $80 meal was advertised on the website for the last month and on opentable (none of my group, who had all looked at the website, saw the so-called advertisement). Now, if this information was advertised, why did everyone need to get a call confirming the prix fixe? Sounds like the liar was S&S.

The risotto was undercooked and when sent back it was returned the same state of crunchy underdoneness but soupier.

2011-01-02,1.0,"I do not typically post on Yelp, but we had such a horrific experience at Sweets & Savories on New Year's Eve I am posting because I do not believe restaurants should get away with treating people like S&S treated us. After my group and I were seated for dinner, we were shocked to see S&S was serving a $80 prix fixe menu.  We were not notified of this in advance - It was not posted on the website, it had not been stated in the reservation confirmation email from Open Table, and it had not been mentioned to me when I called the restaurant to up our reservation to 8.  Keep in mind this is a BYOB that has a nightly $29 3-course prix fixe menu, so $80 for 5 courses of basically the same foods is a complete rip-off! When we asked our server about it, he was very unapologetic and said the chef had made a decision to change the menu weeks ago and all parties had been called and notified.  I insisted I had not received a call on my cell phone (the number associated with the reservation), and he became very defensive and said either I was lying or the host (who was standing right next to me) was lying.  I said it also could have been a simple mistake that I was not called.  He said I must have missed the message.  We asked if, as a compromise, we could order a la carte or take out one of the courses to lower the price.  He claimed he called the chef David Richards (who was working in another restaurant that night) who had told him our only options were 1) eat there and pay $80 per person or 2) leave and be charged $25 per person.  Since there were 8 of us, he said the smart thing to do would be to stay and eat.  At that point, he walked away from me to emphasize the discussion was over.  We made the decision to walk out without eating a thing.  Luckily, Via Carducci, a fantastic little Italian place down the street was able to accomodate our group at 9:30 at night on NYE and we had a great meal. If Sweets & Savories does have the audacity to charge my credit card after the way we were belittled and bullied I will contest it, and fight it legally if I have to.  We showed up for our reservation, and would have stayed and eaten had we been able to work out a compromise.  This restaurant does not know the meaning of customer service, and I urge you not to support it with your business.  There are plenty of other great affordable dining options in Chicago.",-0.8245,0.808,0.087,0.104,0.5097215541659986

Many of the dishes were cracked, and a poor man in the table by us fell off his chair when it broke.   The pumpkin pancakes were fine (I like Orange's pancakes better), the tomato soup tasted like it was made from canned tomatoes, I was told that the risotto was good (not amazing), and that the burger was very good.  We had a great dinner around six months ago, and I hope the restaurant gets back on track.",0.971,0.746,0.182,0.072,0.5081372549019607

Surely, I cant expect the world from a public restaurant.

Specifically speaking, one of their waiters - a 5'9"" baldish guy with moustaches ensured that I can't expect normal behavior from an eating joint which is smaller than a pot used for defecating.

2010-11-01,4.0,"Before I went there, I was very skeptical.  After reading all the negative reviews on food, service, and reactions from waiter to Groupon, my expectation was very low.  After eating there, I give this place a solid 4, and I'd give it 4.5 if there were half stars.  We went there on a Friday night for dinner and I had a groupon to use.  The service was a bit slow in the beginning, but the waiter was very attentive after that.  He asked me if I had a groupon and asked me to write the email address at the back. No complaining or bitching.  I had some mushroom, corn grits, and truffle oil as starter--it was amazing, the flavors were balanced and corn grits were very yummy.  Bf had some tomato soup, which was the only average dish we've had that night.  For entrées, I had the lobster risotto and bf had the sea scallops.  The lobster risotto was perfectly cooked and had large chunks of lobsters in it.  It was one of the best risottos I've had.  Sea Scallops were also very delicious, well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  We also had lobster mashed potato as side.  Again, it was THE best mashed potato I've had.  It might have to do with all the large lobster chunks in it, or it was just simply perfect. For dessert, we had their special, pumpkin cheesecake.  It was unique and yummy too.  I would recommend go there with small parties as the place is a bit small. And I think most of the complaints on services are from large groups of people.  I'd totally go back and eat the lobster risotto and mashed potato again.",0.995,0.754,0.192,0.053,0.5079188712522046

Then for the final choice, I chose the lobster hash... butter poached lobster with potatoes and onions and 2 poached eggs on it.  The lobster was overcooked and rubbery.  Some of my potatoes were overcooked as well... not just charred on the edges... but BURNT to hard little pieces of inedible charcoal.  Yucko.  The hubs ordered the breakfast risotto with bacon, onions, and a yolk, which the waiter mixed in the risotto for him.  Very tasty but very rich.

2010-10-25,4.0,"I came close to breaking their record. One customer ordered 3 brunch specials in ONE sitting. Sadly, I only ordered 2. I could have done 3, but I think my guests would have been horribly embarrassed by my gluttony.  A group of 7 of us had reservations for Sunday Brunch. A couple of us came early and they seated us right away and gave us our drinks and started us off with a plate of their ""Sweets"". The iced tea was nice and flavorful as well as the coffee. I think it's a positive sign that a small establishment like this runs out of coffee, this way you know the next cup is a freshly brewed cup even if you have to wait a little bit.  So, to explain my gluttonous intentions, you need to understand that they offer an incredible deal for brunch. I mean yes, it is about the ""deal"" but in this case, it's much more about the FOOD. Kobe Beef Burger with Foie Gras Pate? Butter poached Lobster hash? Grilled Salmon eggs Benedict? This is only to name what I can remember after the food coma set in...... It was not humanly possible for me to just pick ONE - I had to give in and chose TWO. Yes, TWO brunch specials for myself! The Burger and the Lobster. I shared the lobster with the table - I thought of it as our other side dish. The burger was amazingly flavorful and just simply luxurious. The lobster has was also flavorful - simple flavors, but very powerful and effective on the palate.  They have the BEST brunch deal in the city that features some of the best food as well. $14 for a plate of sweets (muffin, walnut cake, scone, cinnamon bun), choice of soup or salad, main entree, coffee or tea. Yes. $14. Finally, I found our server, Joaquin, to be prompt and courteous. He had a sense of humor and we all got it. Humor is subjective, so I guess not everyone will be on the same page. The space is small and they were able to accommodate a last minute addition to our group. There was another large party that took up most of the restaurant, so the place felt cramped.

Our second course was brought out before most of us had finished our first course, and one person had eggshells in her dish.

2010-10-16,1.0,"Had dinner here with a group on sunday 10/10/10 I really think the wait staff went out of their way to not provide service. The other reviews are spot on with their descriptions.  I found the whole waitstaff to be uniformed, poorly educated about the menu, rude and just have odd behavior that should not be tolerated by whoever is in charge of this place. They lied to myself and the other people at my table several times and rushed us out the door.  I could babble on and on about messed up orders, missing plates, lack of silverware, cold food and the plan unprofessional environment that is mentioned in most of the reviews of this place that we experienced during our meal as well. I will sum it up with this:  I made a reservation through ""opentable"" and because it was for 5 people I was required to use a credit card to secure the reservation. That was fine by me and I understand the reason for such a request. So I used my AMEX and it was no problem. When the bill was presented in a check holder that had printed on it ""we accept american express"" and we tried to pay with an american express, we were refused. A sad little man in a dirty uniform and dishwater blond hair who is either from europe or has a bad lisp said ""we don't take that card"" in his most superior tone he could muster. He then stomped off away from the table. That was just the icing on the turd of a performance from the whole staff.  All we could do was laugh at him & the other sad little fools who pretend to be something they are not: classy & professional. No we did not ask to speak with the chef or the owner or anyone else who could be held responsible for this bad experience. And no we didn't use a coupon or a groupon and we did leave a tip because being a pimp just isn't the right thing to do after all. We just laughed and shrugged. To do otherwise would be like running down a cabbie who cut me off in traffic. It wouldn't change anything or fix the problem. I did give ""opentable"" an honest review and I did check the box that allows S&S to contact me. They haven't as of yet and it is safe to assume that if they cared about repeat visits or improving there image they would have followed up. I will not dine here again and if someone asks about this place I will not recommend it unless I really don't like him or her.  As far as the food goes: weak is all I can say. The food is creative but was hit and miss. Might have been better if they weren't out of several dishes. Also a fun little FYI if you do try this greasy spoon check out the plates and cups.

2010-10-13,1.0,"Worst place ever! Have never been treated so awfully in my entire life.  I went to S&S with my two girlfriends. One of them had a card from public radio what allows her to buy one entre and get another one free. One of the first things we asked the waiter when he came by was regarding her promotion and how it would work with a prix fix. We were told, in a rather condescending manner, that her entre would be free, and my friend and i were free to order what we wanted. He then, also condescendingly, told us that her promotion would not work with a groupon. Which is fine, because we did not have one.  So, being fully aware of the promo my friend had, waiter took our order for two prix fix and an app (fries) and one entree. All seemed to be good. He did not mention any problems at that point.  When the food came I was rather disappointed. My sword fish was WAY over cooked and extremely dry. The sauce was sooooo overpowering (tomatoes and sausage) I could barely taste the fish. I have to say, however. that braised ribs were rather tasty.  So far, decent enough, even with the condescending waiter. Tall, bold guy with a goatee. and from reading other reviews, i think quite a few people have had an issue with him.  Now comes the ""fun"" part. When we asked for the check we were informed that my friends promo does not work with the prix fix. A little surprised, but still not worried, i politely asked the waiter why we were not told this at the time we placed our order. The crucial part of this story is in his answer, which was, ""I should have told you, I completely blanked, my mistake."" Thinking that he acknowledged his own mistake (and trust me, i fully understand that misunderstandings happen), he, even more condescendingly and now rudely, told us that we will be charged as if everything was a la carte.... hrm.... had we known this from the get go our order would have been completely different.  Still giving him the benefit of the doubt we asked for the check. He proceeded to just sit it on the table as he was running past us. No ""here you go"", nothing. AAAAAND the bill was NOT what we were expecting. He did not make any attempt to correct the situation and charged us to the fullest. Now it became a matter of principle. I asked to talk to the chef. ... Not a better person. He would not stop by even 15 seconds to listen to me, and then proceeded to question me about what happened. My bottom line to him was ""your staff admitted making an error and yet failed to either correct it or at least apologize"". At that i was sent away....  i used to work in service industry, and trust me, i know that the customer is NOT always right, but i have never felt more disregarded and almost despised in my life.  Check #2 arrives, now corrected. The waiter DROPPED it on the table, yet again. no apologies, NOTHING. Guess who did not get a tip that evening. Had he been less rude, and maybe uttered an I'm sorry that was not half-assed, we would have tipped. After all. there is a right and wrong way to handle a bad situation. He did not take the high road.  Half way down the block from the restaurant i heard screaming behind our backs.... The waiter ran out of the restaurant to scream profanities at us as we were walking away....  Not only would i never go back there, but I would tell anyone who would listen not to go either. I considered calling the owner/manager, but from some of the reviews it appears to me that he isn't much better.  BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD",0.921,0.807,0.109,0.085,0.5580189255189255

The prices are high by the plate, but I went with the $10 deal for an American Kobe burger topped with foie gras.  The prix fixe option also seems reasonable.  I ordered the burger cooked medium (the chef recommends medium rare).  I'm a bit divided on the results.  The beef was far and away the most tender, juicy meat I've ever had.  But it didn't taste like a burger.  I know that's supposed to be the point, but I just didn't find it as satisfying as a typical burger.  I also thought that the taste of the char on the outside of the patty overwhelmed the meat somewhat.  There was  a tangy truffle mayonnaise that came on the side.  I put a smear on and didn't taste it at all.  Nor could I really taste the glob of foie gras on top of the meat.  With those being the only toppings other than a single leaf of something green, the whole thing was a touch boring. For dessert, I was divided between the apple tart tatin and the blackberry cobbler.  I took the waiter's recommendation and went with the cobbler.  I shared with my girlfriend, which was fortunate since the thing was quite large.  The flavor was just what you'd expect, nothing special.  I've probably been spoiled by the absolutely perfect peach cobblers at Smoque.

Turns out everyone decided to do either the Prix Fixe or the Burger deal so the first girl went to order her Prix Fixe and the guy cut her off and said she couldn't do that with the Groupon.  I told him we decided not to use it and he got a little huffy and said he had to go back and take it off our bill.  Not really my problem since I explained myself up front and you jumped the gun. I got the burger cooked Medium and it was still pretty pink for my liking.  A couple people got Medium Rare and it was really pink but that's what the chef recommends I guess.  It was good but not life altering.  The fries were really great, we ordered two for our table of six and that seemed to be a good amount.  I could have taken down one order myself but I would probably regret that a couple hours later.

2010-09-02,1.0,"My fiancée and I were excited to celebrate her birthday at Sweets & Savories as we had been eying the restaurant for some time and had a Groupon to sweeten the deal.  Unfortunately, the only good thing about the dinner was the beer and wine, and we brought that ourselves. The food here was very disappointing.  I got  the steak frites and my fiancée got the burger.  My steak was not cooked well (more on this later) and was slopped on top of a mound of fries, making it very difficult to cut around all the tough chewy fat that polluted the strip.  I recognize that NY Strips have more marble than other cuts, but this thing was loaded with disgusting amounts of fat.  The fries weren't bad, but they were soaked through with grease, to the point that I probably ate like 6 of them.  Overall, the greasy, fatty plate made me lose my appetite after the first couple bites.  My fiancée hated her burger, despite being very excited about it from all the good reviews.  Grease was literally pouring out of the meat, and her bun was soaked after just a couple minutes.  I thought she was going to be sick.  The toppings are fairly lacking on the burger as well, and no sides are offered with it.  Our dessert was pretty good, so you can chalk the one star up to that.  But honestly, just about anything would have been good after the entrees that we suffered through.  The most glaring flaw at this establishment has to be the service.  Our waiter (a bigger guy with a goatee) was the most condescending, uncomfortable, and unhelpful server that I can honestly remember in all of my dining experience.  We attempted to be friendly and polite with him multiple times, and in return we received a cold attitude and short, useless answers to our questions.  He turned his nose up at us as soon as we mentioned our Groupon, as if we were terrible people for utilizing the service.  We got the shaft on bread at the beginning despite every table near us getting some.  I asked about the possibility of adding cheese on their burger and he said ""Why would you want to ruin the burger with that?""  Excuse me, but from where I come from (America), cheese is what makes a burger good - and when I am considering spending $17 on one, I expect to not be ridiculed for my preference.

2010-08-23,3.0,"I bought a Groupon for Sweets and Savories, and my boyfriend and I decided to come here for a Sunday night date. We got the endive salad, which was pretty good. The scallops entrée was delicious -- the scallops were tender and perfectly cooked. However, my boyfriend's salmon was burnt to a crisp on the outside and just did not taste like it was cooked correctly. The best part of the meal was the fig tart that we ordered for dessert. Figs were used in replacement of apples, but I think it would be amazing with any kind of fruit. Generally, I feel that the food was not worth the price tag. Even with the Groupon, I felt that the final bill came out to more than what the food was actually worth. In addition, the waiter was... I wouldn't call him outright rude, but he was rather condescending. For example, as he seated us, he curtly told us that it was BYOB and that we could run to a liquor store down the street if we wanted anything. I felt uncomfortable every time he came around to refill our water or bring us more food. Overall, I'd give the place somewhere in between 3 and 3.5 stars. As in, it was decent experience and the food was mostly good, but I'm not completely in love with this place and I probably wouldn't go terribly out of my way to come here again.",0.8326,0.829,0.103,0.069,0.5922705314009661
2010-08-17,4.0,"Needless to say, I was quite excited about the idea of a French bistro with a brunch prix fixe menu for under $15 that included three courses AND coffee! Add to that it's a BYOB (bottle of Layer Cake Shiraz) and I'm in heaven. The ambiance is quite simple, but works for the aesthetic they're going for--the music is old and new French pop (think Edith Piaf intermixed with Link Up). There is a lot to love about this place. The menu doesn't have one unappealing option, the pastries served with every meal are quite delightful and the coffee isn't crap. I think each restaurant experience is different based on innumerable factors--some out of control of the serving staff, chefs, etc.  For example, when we sat down at our table, our waiter came over and asked for our orders right away because a large party was sitting down after us and he didn't want us to have to wait. Thoughtful of him--but also led to a disjointed brunch experience. Our pastries were served with the first course which was very promptly followed by our entrées. Rather than desert our first course (a potato vichyssoise) in mid-spoonful, we finished and by the time I got to my entrée (a heirloom tomato Benedict) it was cold.  While the staff focused on serving the larger party, our coffee cups sat empty--again, we were not ignored or served rudely--it was just the luck of the draw regarding timing. What I hope happens is that despite their size (super small place) folks at S&S will find a better way of handling a rush so that the smaller tables aren't overlooked or given a different experience.

2010-08-13,1.0,"I recently hosted a bridal shower at the restaurant with another bridesmaid.   I used to do events for a living with average pricing to 5 star restaurants. Here is a quick overview. food - I would give a 2-3 star. decor- 3 star service- if I can do ""0 STAR"", I would.  We have hosted the shower on a Saturday. Normally I would always take my time to greet the servers as I always appreciate their help for our function and let them know what I would like to do for the set up.  Strangely, the servers didn't seem to want to be greeted. When we asked to have the front table to be used for placing gifts, the servers insisted on putting them in the back, because they have already set up the silverware at the front table for their 5pm opening.  They were inflexible to our needs and reluctantly removing the silverware on the front table we requested to use.    We rented out the space from 2-5pm, and they let outside guests trickle in before 5pm and disrupt our party.  Overall, the food is good if you are just looking for good food with poor service.  As for the ones looking to host a bridal shower here, I would suggest you to look into Jane's restaurant. Unless, you are willing to put up with renting out the space while the servers are not going to let you use the space/table, rude service to guests and let outside guests disrupt your party before your reserved time slot is over.  oh, did I mention the manager of the restaurant David also called me and said my expectation is higher than what S&S can offer, and ask me to go somewhere else in the future?  I used to do events for a living, this is the first time I have come across a restaurant like S&S.   Try Jane's or other restaurants. :) trust me.",0.9656,0.868,0.099,0.033,0.4066666666666666

It was sorely disappointing to find out that it was no longer being offered, but the $29 prix fixe meal is no bad deal either. My only issue with S&S is the service. My friend and I walked in on a Tuesday night to be met by rude staff service (he looked us up and down before even saying hello) who despite the half empty room behind him, claimed that since we had no reservations, we would have to wait an hour until 8 p.m. when he could maybe fit us in. Whatever, we're flexible. My friend and I went across the street to McDunnas (THEY are nice) where we had a few drinks before heading to S&S. We came back to see the SAME HALF EMPTY ROOM.

I don't know what they are or where they come from, but they taste how my dog's paws smell--so could you keep them out of my mayonaise! Ewe. I literally threw up at 2am, and I will forver insist it was the truffles. I tried to like this stuff, but it just isn't in me.  That said, the creme brulee was perfect and the chocolate fallen soufflee was really, really good. I may not know about truffles and pate but I know about chocolate soufflee.

But the french fries, I mean, sorry, pommes frites, were delightful with the bit of sugar on them, but when I asked the waiter to add them to my order he rolled his eyes and looked annoyed.

Only one item did not include eggs: banana pancakes ... the other ""non-egg"" dish was French toast. the first course is actually a small plate of 5 sweet treats, including a very yummy scone and palmier .. the others including a cinnamon roll that was rather dry and tasteless. the second course had three choices; i chose fresh fruit and the melon and pineapple were delicious, but the strawberrries were not very good.   I tried the risotto with bacon and egg yolk and it was quite tasty.  the coffee is very good and i was given ample refills on this and lime-laced ice water.  I sat at the bar since I was a solo diner and all went well, except my plate of risotto sat for nearly 20 minutes before it was cleared.

A big plus is the byob option - which I am told makes this a very popular dinner spot - so make reservations in advance.  But you can also add some sparkle to your brunch and byo bubbly for mimosas...which I just might have to do the next time.  I will definitely be back!",0.9874,0.849,0.136,0.014,0.42324561403508776

It took forever to get water and coffee, then it took forever to put in our order. When we asked our server for a coffee refill he acted a little put out, and never gave us a refill. We watched him give the table next to us coffee, then swiftly return the coffee pot to the kitchen. This is particularly annoying to me and my companion because we are both in the service industry so not only do we NEED our coffee in the morning, but we are also pretty good at keeping up with orders and oh, I don't know, maybe apologizing when we forget something?

Sweets & Savories is a bit off the beaten path, which means it's unlikely this will be our regular brunch spot when we pass through Chicago - but they DO take reservations, which makes getting brunch with a bunch of friends on a holiday weekend about 1,000 times easier than any other place we've been in the city.  Two thumbs up!",0.9866,0.798,0.153,0.049,0.5071794871794871

I casually mentioned this and he responds ""I am very happy for you that you have not had this issue, but it's Tuesday and we book three weeks in advance,"" in the most inappropriate way.

2009-12-09,2.0,"We had heard such great things about Sweets and Savories and finally got to try it last night on their half price menu night. Overall, service was horrible and if we had paid regular price for the food I would have been very upset. However, for the price we paid plus the fact that it's BYOB, it was an okay evening (minus the service). It took our server almost 30 minutes to even approach our table, we didn't even have water in our glasses. At one point we got up to ask for an ice bucket for our wine, never showed up. We finally asked again 15 minutes later and got one. The service level is definitely not at the level it should be based on their price point. On half price night, maybe surly waitstaff is what you get. Since it was half price night, we went crazy and ordered a ton of items. There wasn't too much to complain about, the food was fine, not extraordinary, but fine. The steak was extremely disappointing however. It was ordered as medium rare, came totally rare (which was fine), but it was so tough that you couldn't even chew it. The kitchen must have some problems cooking meat to certain temperatures, because whenever the waiter asked how we'd like something cooked, we'd respond with our preference, and then he'd say that it would be more red than what we ordered. For example, we ordered the steak medium rare, he said, that will come out very red and similar to rare. Well, if I ordered medium rare, why would our steak come out rare? That happened when we ordered the burger and the steak, strange. We all ordered dessert and they were pretty good.  I think Sweets and Savories would be a lot better if they invested a little more in their wait staff and service. The food can stand alone, although at the regular price point it probably would have been disappointing.

I think that this place might have given them pause to stay. I came on Wednesday when the Kobe beef burger with foie gras is $10 dollars. Obviously, we all got that and the burger was of course, delicious like it always is. However, the other items we ordered were simply amazing. The mussels and sausage were great, the mussels were the right consistency and the mix of the salty, slightly spicy sausage and the sweetness of the tomato sauce was excellent. Decorum was the only thing that kept me from simply digging into it with the small loaf of bread they gave with it. The Gnocchi/escargot was the other appetizer we ordered. I liked it, I always love escargot and the gnocchi was a good mix of texture.  I think I gushed about the burger in my previous review so onto the sweets. The three of us split three desserts: Chocolate cornmeal pie, Meyer Lemon curd tart,  Pumpkin cake. We started out with the lemon tart, so good! The lemon was slightly sweet as well as being tart and the raspberry coulis was a great accompaniment. The pumpkin cake was also delicious and so seasonal, the creme anglaise was also another just divine. After this, I convinced my friends-it didn't take much to get another dessert. The chocolate cornmeal pie, was like a brownie but the pb cream just made it.

We went back and forth on what time we wanted to meet for dinner and the person over the phone was very understanding but let me know that there was another reservation at 7, so as long as we were done by then, we'd be fine whether we came in at 5 or 5:45. We ended up getting there at 5:45 and the waiter kindly reminded us of the 7 o'clock reservation. We were fine with that and placed our orders for 3 burgers immediately.  We popped our cork and started on the wine that we brought when the waiter brought us a complimentary plate of the butternut squash risotto. We scooped up every bite and sat in glee. When our burgers came out with our two sides (we ordered the frites and truffle mac n cheese) we were surprised when the waiter brought out yet another platter of frites. Talk about overloading on spuds! The chef said one order of frites was not enough so he sent us out another order. At that point our stomachs were well stretched out but we kept eating and giggling over what fatties we were.  Around 7 the waiter cleared our plates and were ready to leave when the waiter asked us to move to the bar for dessert. We weren't planning on ordering any, but he said they wanted us to at least have dessert! Our table was cleared and set for the other table and we got comfy at the bar. Then the waiter brought out a huge slice of lemon tart. We all practically melted at the kind gesture! Then the pastry chef came out and said it was the easiest thing to make and to check the recipe out on their facebook page.

2009-11-24,3.0,"Four stars for the food, two for the service - so I'll average this at three. I've been to Sweets and Savories a couple of times now, and it's best to visit on one of their specials nights - on Tuesdays, the entire menu is half off, which is an amazing deal, and every day there's a $29 prix fixe (one day I'm going to make a list of all the restaurant specials in Chicago - there are so many right now! At least one good thing came out of the recession...). Come here for the food - overall, it's excellent. One standout item was the blueberry risotto - it sounds strange, but it's surprisingly good. The friend that I made the last trip here with has been raving about it ever since.  Chocoholics take note: the dessert menu is strangely devoid of chocolate. It's not that there isn't any, it's just that there are very, very few chocolate options. As someone who isn't terribly interested in dessert unless it's made of chocolate, I found this disappointing. The addition of a chocolate mousse or something along those lines would make for a much stronger menu (for me at least). Make a reservation: If you don't, the staff will look confused for a good ten minutes even if the restaurant is empty and barely any other diners walk in. It gets to the point of being a little off-putting. Service ranges from passable to bad. On my first visit, the service was sub-par. My friend ordered fries - which, by the way, look amazing - and found them much too salty. I think the kitchen was having an off day, since he generally adds more salt to his food than I think a person should consume and I've had those fries since on other occasions. When he sent the fries back to the kitchen untouched (mind you, this was the only time in 4-5 years I've seen him send anything back - he's not a picky eater), our server did not ask what was wrong. That's a huge mistake - I've worked as a server, and you always ask what's wrong with the food when a customer looks unhappy and sends it back. Not only did the server not ask, the fries also appeared on the bill. I didn't want to make a fuss with the manager about it and paid the bill with no questions, but we both found this a bit disconcerting. I should also note that their website is terrible and rather out of date (it's currently listing a truffle special from June). The bottom line: make a reservation and come on a Tuesday. It's worth visiting for the bargain food prices on that night, and the food is generally quite good.",0.8513,0.798,0.111,0.091,0.47745869776482014

I got a sampling of the sausage and mussels, onion soup, and risotto, and I must say, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with the appetizers here.  I ordered the steak frites after reading a lot of complaints about the other dishes here on the yelp. I must say: I had entree envy. The steak was extremely disappointing. I was warned by the waiter that ordering it ""medium"" would mean pink-red center, which I was happy with. I ended up with a medium-well steak. Sounds too complainy? I don't think so. Steak should be cooked how it is ordered, no matter where you are.  The frites were pretty gross. Salt, salt, salt. And I love salt, but seriously, too much salt. Combined with an overcooked, dry steak, and yes, very disappointing.  The chocolate pecan pie was pretty good, but of course by the time dessert roles around at a BYOB, can you trust your taste buds anymore? Nonetheless, I would be pretty happy with another piece of that pie this morning. My least favorite part of pecan pie is usually the goo, but this pecan pie was great because (1) there were plenty of pecans, and (2) the goo was filled with chocolate! yay!

Our reservation was at 6pm. We sat down right away (a plus), but were put right next to the front window and it was cold for the people sitting on the window side. Everyone decided to go for the prix fixe menu as it was 29 dollars.

Appetizers were rather slow to come out, were finished with them about 1 15 minutes in. Entrees were brought out over an hour after ordering them. Some of them were good (lobster risotto and pork) the amberjack was fishy smelling and the swiss chard had too much salt and lemon and were almost inedible.

The value is still great and most the food was pretty great, but there were some misses.  First off, after studying the menu for 5 minutes and making our decisions, we had the server come over and tell us there was no lobster anymore, and they were running low on scallops. Well, that eliminated two of the items we were going to order. So, we spent another few minutes figuring out our game-plan. My boyfriend ordered the escargot apptizer, and she said she forgot to tell us they were out of that too, but they could do the dish without it...the gnocchi sounded good, so sure, why not. They were able to scrounge up a few scallops for me for my entree. There were some wonderful stand out dishes. The scallops with foie gras risotto rocked, the vegetable tart was great and the berry cobbler was really good.  But, it wasn't just the fact that they ran out of this stuff that irked me, it was that our server was soooo flaky about it all. She was unable to offer other suggestions or give me any feedback or guidance when I was torn between a couple of dishes. I mean, she was really pretty bad!

I believe standard rate is $17, so this is a fantastic deal. A friend and I went on a Friday night, and the server was not drawn back when I pulled the certificate out (I always cringe when I present coupons/certificates as I assume the staff immediately thinks ""there goes my tip""). The burger itself was very tasty. The foie gras on top was blackened and the meat was a nice medium rare. The truffle mayonnaise might have been the key to this dish, and it was very subtle but added just the right amount of flavor to complement the burger. We also ordered the roasted vegetable tart, which was good but not great...all in all the meal ended up costing around $25 w/tip and we shared a bottle of wine (no corkage fee!!!!). - 5 star experience Deal 2: On Tuesdays EVERYTHING IN THE RESTAURANT IS HALF OFF. A friend of mine walked to the restuarant with 2 (yes 2) bottles of wine and an expectation of a large meal. We ordered the roasted beet salad and the asparagus risotto as appetizers and both were EXCELLENT. The restaurant has amazing risotto. For entrees my friend ordered the duck confit and I ordered the steak frites. Both of our entrees were less than desirable. While I forget his comments on the duck, both the quality and preparation of the steak were unsatisfactory. The meat was very fatty, and the cut was nothing close to the rare I had asked for. We finished with the chocolate cornmeal pie...you must try this if you go. It was absolutely delicious, both in texture and taste. Overall I think our bill came to around $34 without tip or something ludicrous like that. We tipped well even though the service was somewhat shoddy (she had forgotten one of our appetizers and wasn't available to be reminded for quite some time). - 4 star experience. The restaurant itself is very small and ""personal"", meaning you're going to get to know the other patrons very well by the time your meal is over. They stack a lot of tables in a very small area, and there isn't really a table in the room that could offer even a shred of privacy. I don't  mind this as much as others, but if you're expecting an intimate experience I would go look elsewhere. Goods: Tuesday night offers an unbelievable deal. I'm not sure you can find the type of food with these prices anywhere in the city. What tips the scale is the BYOB no-corkage fee. This makes a good deal unbeatable.

I'm writing this because we had an AWESOME time.  We stopped in on a weeknight, and the birthday girl's fiance had made reservations.  I have to give Sweets & Savories a shout out here because they were ready for us.  They had a swarm of waiters on hand to take care of everyone, and although we ordered a ton of different things, our food came out quickly and everything was cooked well.  A lot of people took advantage of the prix fixe menu ($30?) for an app, entree, and dessert.  Since it is BYOB, I think we saved the waiters a lot of heartache by bringing in our own wine.  Additionally, the waitstaff was really jovial and easy to be around. They seemed knowlegable about the menu and generally seemed to like their jobs. Of the dinners I've been to with more than 6 diners, this was by far the most enjoyable.  Perhaps it was the company, but the service was stellar, and that really took things to the next level.

I thought the brunch was pretty awesome, considering you get three courses for only $14! The basket of pastries is a welcome sight when you're having a late breakfast that merges into lunch. I'm not a big fan of raisins/currants, but the scone was definitely my favorite. For my ""starter"", I went with the carrot ginger soup, and the heat from the ginger was so subtle and fantastic against the sweetness of the carrot. I chose the bacon waffle for my main, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the bacon was actually inside of the waffle, as opposed to lazily thrown on top. And who doesn't love some bacon in their waffle with some maple syrup poured on top? One of my friends got the bacon risotto with a fresh egg served on top, which the server quickly pours onto the risotto for you to stir and cook in. I tried a bite, and it was deliciously rich and smoky. I really liked it, but would have probably gotten to the bacon risotto overload after a few bites. Might be better as a side.

So we ordered appetizers (again).  Having taken our appetizer orders, he immediately started storming off again.  Thinking we were best off ordering everything considering the speed of things, we had to get up and grab him back so we could order our actual dinners.  This we did, to curt and outright rude behavior.

For the first course I got the carrot & ginger soup.  It was cool, not cold.  I thought it tasted very good, but was kind of rich, so I only had about 1/3 of the soup.  My friend got the fruit plate, it was a very large bowl of mixed fruits - pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries.  Main entree - both of us got the duck confit hash with 2 poached eggs on top.  It was okay, nothing spectacular.  Not the largest portion.  The eggs were perfectly poached, the potatoes were okay, the duck was a little dry.  The lemon hollandaise was very good.  Needed salt.  It would have been better with a piece or 2 of toast to pick up the juices.

Every option is a winner. Reservations are a must, a day in advance is good, but make sure to get some assurance from whomever calls you back to confirm the time. It's so silly but twice now I've had more than one person call me back regarding my reservation and in the end someone fucks up the reservation time. This last time they bumped me fifteen minutes later and in the end I was waiting thirty minutes for a table. That shit gets annoying quickly. No accountability for the time issue, look at me in the eyes and apologize please. Most just pretend that time isn't an issue. Still, the brunch was exceptional. I think they have gotten rid of alcohol? This time round brunch was $14 and the menu prices coffee and tea. I think I remember someone telling me that they are BYOB now. Too bad, a mimosa with brunch hit the spot. Things remembered most: Lobster hash came with premium portions of lobster. Potatoes were just meh. The plate of rolls, scones, & etc all tasty and decadent, you will remember the sweet roll. Smoked bacon risotto is a must, if you dig risotto don't pass up this one. Sweet potato bisque is sweet and light. (I smuggled in my own spices for a kick, it was even better. Cayenne pepper to go) Bruleed Oatmeal., Like the other reviews state, it's a tiny spot with seating for 2, 4 in the window and longer tables further into the room.

2009-04-26,4.0,"Prix fixe Sunday Brunch is a beautiful idea, especially at a French-influenced spot like S&S. For $14 you get two courses and a plate of goods, plus complimentary coffee/tea. A recommendation on the order of ingesting the baked goods plate: 1. The scone - sweeter than your usual, even the non-fans will enjoy it, and it's a good start. 2. The muffin - a little sweeter, ideal segue into... 3. The pecan cake. the icing is yummy 4. The palmier - sweet and flaky, yet light, this breaks up the transition from cake to roll (both heavy items) nicely. 5. The sweets roll - a delicious cinnamon roll, enough said. (If you can only pick a few, skip 2 and 3.) Onto the first course. I had a baby arugula salad, tossed with pecorino, lemon and olive oil that was perfectly savory - a true example of how keeping it simple with a few ingredients can be executed well. Nothing mind-blowing, but still pleasantly paired. My date had the bruleed oatmeal, which was everything you would imagine. Second course - the Big Kahuna. I had the butter poached lobster hash with poached eggs and lemon hollandaise. One bite took me back to the days of alaskan king crab legs with drawn lemon butter at the country club - no joke. Small critique: the potatoes were cold by the time they got to me, which was a little disappointing.  The date ordered the soft scrambled eggs with black truffle over toasted brioche. Cultural Culinary Anecdote: Americans and French treat breakfast eggs differently. We tend to make scrambled eggs at home, and order featured omelets at restaurants. The French make their omelets at home - then go out for oeufs brouillés - soft scrambled eggs. It usually involves straining out impurities and then cooking over low heat in a double boiler. Sweets & Savories follows in this classic tradition's footsteps perfectly - I'm not sure exactly how their soft scrambled eggs are prepared, but the eggs with black truffle were delicious. Even though I was beside myself with fullness, I managed to sneak in a few truffle-laced bites of heaven. Side note: some restaurants sprinkle some herbs on all of their dishes - parsley is a usual signature garnish of some Italian restaurants. S&S's is chive. I loved their freshly roasted French coffee. And heads up - the amount of food is filling enough that you won't need other drinks of any sort with your meal.

I got the seared sea scallops over foie gras risotto.  Normally you wouldn't think to combine foie gras and risotto together, and this was no exception.  It tasted fine, but it was mushy and the foie gras flavor was lost in the creaminess of the sauce.  The sea scallops were a little too seared and were in danger of being burnt.  My friends got the lobster risotto though and they cleaned their plates.  I got the sticky toffee bread pudding for dessert, and it was totally burnt.  My friend's was also burnt, so at least I knew they were consistent.  The Belgium chocolate cake was much tastier, though a bit on the heavy side.

Service was exceptionally poor with a wait of more than 20 minutes for a cup of coffee. It was very clear that the shift was understaffed. We ordered a couple of mimosas only to be told that there was no more champagne and that we needed to order something else.  Having looked at the menu, we ordered the sweet potato soup to start. This was also not available and was substituted by a tomato coulis.  Just as we settled for the tomato soup, we were informed that the soup option had changed yet again, this time to a sweet onion.  We then ordered the chocolate and banana pancakes and the steak and eggs.  Shortly after our order was taken, the server came back to let us know that now the kitchen had run out of pancakes.  You can imagine our frustration. There was no management on duty to address our concerns which is why we wrote this letter. The food was good but due to our negative experience, we do not have any desire to return.

The duck fat frites were okay, not amazing but the mango chutney dipping sauce was interestingly delicious ($8). The sauce evened out the saltiness of the fries.

They had a three course prix fixe for $29 which was a great deal...but to the food: Caprese Salad: Huge portion with large pieces of mozz and tomatoes...fresh, but waaaay oversalted Steak Frites: Cooked well, but the meat wasn't a great cut as there was much inedible grizzle' however, was large enough and a good entree...fries were meh Kobe Burger: Could not taste the Kobe quality meat (still am unsure of the actual validity of this at many restaurants, with labeling laws etc) Anyway it was cooked well, the foie was fantastic, and the mayo and bread was great as well....BUT, although everything was great I didn't feel the extra stuff made the burger better necessarily. When compared to a standard burger at Kumas (which obviously has a lot going on) it didn't live up to the expectations. All that said it was still a treat and good deal at ten bucks.

We asked for a glass and they had a few and we got one...the date another after that. The pours were not big at all...fine....but the bill came....$14 a pop! Ridiculous.

2008-07-11,3.0,"What a disappointment.  I've been wanting to try this place for months and months after hearing so many fabulous things about it.  When a chef is celebrated to the level of Grant Achatz and the like, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect an exceptional meal.  I mean, I wasn't expecting an Alinea-esque experience or anything, but last night it really felt like this guy was just phoning it in. We walk in for a 7pm reservation and, but for the lone server/bartender (I don't think they even had a busser), the place is empty.  The menu has VERY little selection (NOT what or as much as you can see on their web-site right now).  Usually I find myself torn between several options that look really appealing when dining in such a place.  Here I was trying to find the lesser of of 3 evils to choose from...there wasn't much and it didn't look appealing.  They offer a three-course prix fixe dinner for $29: salad/app., entree, dessert.  This seemed like a really good deal so we opted for this...yet another example of ""you get what you pay for"", I guess (though I can think of at least a dozen more gratifying ways to spend $30 in the sea of selection that is Chicago restaurants). I started with the arugula salad: baby arugula, baby spinach, tossed in a light citrus dressing and some fresh Parmesan.  Seriously?  That's IT?!?  Not even an offer of fresh-ground pepper (which it desperately needed)?  I make better salads out-of-a-bag at home.  I had the pork tenderloin filet entree (I usually try to order fish when we go out 'cause my husband doesn't like it so I don't prepare it at home, but they only had salmon with mustard and lentils - eeew).  This was probably a 3oz hunk of pork, bloody inside (I know pork isn't a dangerous meat anymore but eew!) wrapped in a strip of soggy bacon.  I HAD to send the dish back to get cooked some more.  I don't give a shit if chef thinks I'm some sort of Luddite, I'm just not comfortable with eating pork rarer than I like my beef.  The pork rested atop a pool of cream of wheat (it was supposed to be polenta), drizzled with some sort of bbq-flavored sauce and a balsamic glaze. First-off, it's summer, BBQ season.  BBQ is EVERYWHERE.  Hell, we grill out at home almost every night.  I don't come into a joint like this to get some fancified version of what I'm already eating a whole lot of this season.  You know what would be cool?  Save that concept for January when it's cold and snowy and we're aching for anything that smacks of summer.  Next, polenta is supposed to be substantial and have a firm mouthfeel, not runny like the breakfast gruel of my childhood.  And what's with all the parsley garnish on everything that I have to pick off?  Isn't that at least ten years past passe?  Why not garnish a dish with something that is not only palatable but enhances the combination of flavors in the dish?  Even a Luddite like me can figure that out. My husband started with the vichyssoise which was light, frothy and delicious.  He had the Kobe beef burger for his entree.  It was good...but not $20 (normal menu price) good.  If I want an exceptional burger I'll go to Kuma's and pay less for better.  He had the Toffee bread pudding for dessert...this was pretty good.  Since i don't have much of a sweet tooth and it was the best thing I'd tasted all night I had the vichyssoise for dessert. All if this adds up to a 2-star review from me but the service was pretty good, especially since that part of the experience was a one-woman show.  Plus, she gave me a great wine recommendation that I will be looking for retail.  Add to that the truffle-honey butter and the artisan bread basket offered before the meal and I can safely add a third star.  I purchased a  restaurant.com  certificate for this restaurant in anticipation of trying it but accidentally left it at home last night.  If I didn't still have that, I don't think I'd bother trying this place again...there are just too many great options out there. And a note to David Richards: dude, if you need a summer vacation, close the restaurant down for a month and TAKE ONE!  No one will begrudge you that...  But half-assing it 'cause it's a slow season for you?  That's a recipe for disaster in your business.",0.9974,0.781,0.151,0.068,0.5369965647950722

It proved a delightful choice. It's a bit nondescript in terms of being an unobtrusive storefront close by the intersection of Fullerton and Ashland (so much so that I initially walked right past it). However, on the inside, it's all dark, urban polish. The menu changes with great regularity, but it would appear the Kobe burger is a standby. Disappointed that the sweet potato bisque you might see on MenuPages was not on that night's slate, I started off with the arugula salad, which was fresh and had the proper peppery flavor, and was delightfully offset with a lemony oil and a dry white Italian cheese. For the main course, I went with the beef tenderloin, which came properly medium rare--a bit of 'blue' and a bit of blood, a joy to see, and better still to carve up and enjoy. The waitress thoughtfully made certain that the sauce was gluten-free, and it came with a delicious lobster-mashed potato blend on the side. My friends selected the cod with artichoke and the burger, with an order of the duck-fat fries for the table--tempting fate, I noshed a few without a reaction, and enjoyed the succulent joy of the best fries imaginable. We washed it all down with a recommended bottle of California zinfandel. There was no arguing that we were content and well-fed, and I had managed to set my troubles aside to properly indulge my senses of taste, smell, and joie de vivre. If there's a wrinkle to Sweets & Savories that might rub some of you the wrong way, it's the amusing blend of snootiness and a patronizing tone affected by the staff.

Had a noon reservation and was seeted promptly.  The hostess was accomodating when we asked for a table away from the door - I felt like that was probably a sign of good things to come. The brunch menu is a prix fixe.  You get an assortment of pastries/muffins/cakes, choice of drink, choice of 1st course, choice of main menu.  I had a mimosa, 1st course was bruleed grapefruit and main course was bacon risotto with egg yolk.   I thought the plate of pastries etc. was great.  There was a nice assortment, and it was plentiful.  My personal favorite was the scone.  It was pretty moist and very tasty. The bruleed grapefruit was the weak link for me.  Essentially, it was a grapefruit, with just a minimilist amount of sugar, then shot with the brulee flame. Was it good?  Sure.  But only because I like grapefruit. The bacon risotto with egg yolk was excellent.  The portion looked small at first glance, but it was so rich that I could not have eaten much more, even if I wanted to. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the pace.  We had a drink + essentially 3 courses and were done eating by 12:30.  That is fast.  Our next courses were coming out pretty much on top of each other.  Then, to make things worse, we waited 20 minutes after we were done eating to get our check and pay.  I would have much preferred to have those 20 minutes mixed into my meal.

Fourth course: beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and blue cheese sauce.  Out of this world fantastic.  They never asked how we like our steak, so I guess they just assume medium to medium/rare is what people want.  Worked for us. Intermezzo: arugula salad with lemon and grated parmesan.  Weird.  I guess it is 'french' to have your salad after your main course and apparently I am not a francophile because this was just weird for us and we didn't eat it.  Dessert: chocolate souffle cake with fresh raspberries and homemade ice cream.  Delicious!  Just as good as it sounds. 60 bucks a head.  Waitress told us Mondays they have the tasting for 10 bucks off and you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  So this would be a great deal for you Monday diners out there.  Overall a very pleasant dining experience.",0.9945,0.755,0.196,0.049,0.5532300178454025

Their duck fat fries are also big enough to split between 2-3 people, although you are sure to be competing with your dinner mates to see who gets the last one, they are delicious. Two burgers + 1 order of fries was $26. Can't beat that price. We also ordered an arugula  salad (that was just OK for $10) and 1 glass of wine, 1 cocktail, and a bottle of water for $31. So drinks and salad were $41...! Pricey! So I wasn't crazy about that. However, I really don't mind because the burger and fires were totally worth paying full price for. Additionally, our sever was very nice and pleasant...and although we only ordered 1 dessert to share, they gave us two...just because.  So that was a really nice surprise.

I went here with a friend on a Wednesday to take advantage of the $10 Kobe beef burger deal. My friend and I had bottomless tummies (or eyes that were bigger than our stomachs), so we ordered the duck fat french fries and macaroni and cheese as sides to our Kobe burgers. I'm sure our waiter was laughing at the two tiny Asian girls who were ordering all this food!  Anyway, the food was delightful. The Kobe beef burgers were juicy, ginormous, perfectly seasoned, and - best of all - topped with foie gras! I could only finish half of my burger, which seemed like one half too much already! The macaroni and cheese was a tad too cheesy (and salty), but it was perfectly balanced with the duck fat french fries. The french fries also came with some apricot-like ketchup, which was surprisingly good. My friend didn't like it, but I actually loved it! It reminded me of banana ketchup (shout out to the Filipinos who know what this is).  I plan to come back another Wednesday when I have a hankering for some MEATY goodness.

Well, the appetizer did not disappoint.. I wanted to finish it, but the portions were just too big for me to have enough room to enjoy my entree, the lobster hash.  The lobster hash, too, was tasty and yummy - not too greasy, just enough flavors.  I ended the gorge with a nice cup of coffee.

Every refill was at least a five minute wait and it took about 20 min to place an order.  The cooks, bartender, etc were really friendly and kept coming over to say hi- but the actual server was terrible. The worst part was, when we got the bill, he charged us $20 a person. Yes, it's only a dollar, but the thing is advertised at $19. So i went up and politely asked, Is the brunch $20 or $19 a person? and he goes, ""Well, it's $19, but it's just easier this way to calculate."" WTF???? I couldn't believe it. If you're going to charge me more at least lie about it-seriously. I don't know where the ""attentive"" staff went that everyone was talking about but they need to re-hire them ASAP!

Also, the orange juice was no better than store-bought concentrate.  Definitely NOT what I was expecting from a place with a prix-fixe brunch menu.  Oh yeah, and the brunch menu (printed on a Word doc) included mimosas, but they didn't have any.  Why they didn't just reprint the Word doc I have no idea! My last complaint was the food.  I chose a bruleed grapefruit for my first course.  Too bad they barely even cut it.  Try eating an uncut grapefruit with a giant soup spoon!  Not fun.  Bacon risotto for second course was flavorful but very salty, and I couldn't even eat the hash browns because they were so doused in salt! OTHER THAN THAT, there were a couple nice features.  Overall, the $19 prix fixe was a reasonable value and the items on the menu (minus store-bought OJ and WAY too much salt) were interesting and tempting.  I also enjoyed the plate of pastries they brought to the table -- a nice substitute for a routine bread basket.

Next was risotto, flavored with blueberries.  Very good, but again, barely warm, and was very heavy and creamy.  The server, once he actually got around to us despite having NOBODY in the restaurant, explained that the blueberries were ""fresh from the farmers market"".  Whoop de do.   The risotto was served with Duck Confit, which was good and also added to the theme of fat, fat, and more fat.  Swimming in fat. Finally, dessert.  When I made the reservation via opentable, I added ""Celebrating her birthday - looking forward to another great evening!""  So the desserts come out.  One with a candle lit.  Guess who gets the candle?  Yep, me, not her.  Unreal.  I did my best to not embarrass the server, but I was not going to go as far as pretend it was my bday.  I only do this with her b/c she gets a kick out of the candle, etc.  They asked me if I wanted a glass of port, kinda to make up for the gaffe?  Come on! I am not sure what is going on here, but the service was AWFUL.  First of all, I hate when servers fill up your water glass when you take a sip.  Annoying.  However, this was the opposite.  I literally had an empty glass for 10 minutes.  The table next to us looked as if they were going to leave, as they were still waiting for their drink order.  They comped one of the drinks, but it shows that they knew that they messed up.   Also, there were 4 or 5 empty tables.  Out of 10 tables.  At 8pm on a Saturday night in Lincoln Park.  Something just is not right with that.  What happened?  Reading the previous reviews, it seems like they hosted a yelp event?  Was this to spark good reviews?  Whatever great service was felt on that night, those servers and chef had the night off tonight.  No, not possible on a Saturday.  Then again, with the place half full, why not give some people the day off? This is an edit to my previous 4-star review.  I have told many coworkers, friends, etc about this place and how great the food and service is and the experience is just perfect.  Now I secretly hope they do not go until S and S gets their act together. We are not that picky, and she works in the restaurant industry as well, so we know there are challenges to running a great place.  Simply put, this place is better than the service that was given, and the food was just blah. $30 bottle of wine (standard), $181 total, so $75 per person, for this experience.  We were let down by this place, and I am not sure I will go back.  I work too hard for my money to see servers and chefs not live up to their end of the bargain.",0.9964,0.788,0.148,0.064,0.530607263107263

So, the BF and I decided we needed to treat ourselves to their brunch. Well, this was the best idea we have ever had. It was amazing. Starting with fresh pastries that were made that morning in house (I asked!), which were so tasty. I love breakfast breads, and sweets - so this was my favorite part to be honest. We got to sample a cinnamon bun, a date scone, a chocolate muffin, and a couple of other things that I don't recall, but from bite one my taste buds were moaning with delight. Next I had the grapefruit bruelee - fantastic and fresh. And to finish it off I had the lobster hash topped with a poached egg. It was so good - rich and tasty with out being too rich. Some of the best flavor I have ever had.   The same servers were here that were at the tasting event - both so nice and gracious. S&S is lucky to have such great professionals working with them - there was no pretension when I asked silly questions (like what was the egg poached in - water and balsamic vinegar - so good!), and everything was delivered with a warm smile!

2007-09-03,5.0,"I came here with my family for my birthday dinner and everything looked so good that we had to get the 5-course tasting menu. First course was a tomato water with olive oil and diced bell peppers, served in a martini glass.  Doesn't sound like much, but tasted really great.  It was a perfect summer dish, cool and refreshing. Next came a cod dish, the details of which I can't remember to well.  It was served over a tomato stew, with a couple of sauces.  Very tasty, and made my cousin realize that she likes cod. Third course was an asparagus risotto.  I love risotto.  I'm not too keen on asparagus.  The risotto definitely won out in that contest though.  It was delicious.  Almost made me wish I had ordered a full serving of it from the a la carte menu. Fourth was the meat course, lamb with a port reduction together with some spicy lentils.  My mom, the semi-vegetarian was served salmon in lieu of lamb.  I know this was the favorite dish of many at the table.  The lamb was beautifully cooked, and the reduction perfectly complimented the flavor.  I really enjoyed the lentils, which were prepared in a way that almost reminded me of really fancy baked beans.  Perhaps that's just me struggling to describe a food I've never had before, though. Last was the dessert course.  Here it became clear why ""Sweets"" comes first in the restaurant name.  We had a party of 6, and they brought out 6 full size desserts for the table to share.  I won't go into detail on all of them, save to say that they were all very good.  The rich chocolate cake and the cardamom cake were my favorites.  The bread pudding forced my dad to reconsider his opinion that he didn't really like bread pudding.  I have a monster sweet tooth, so perhaps I'm not the most objective, but everyone there agreed the desserts were excellent. The restaurant is not in a terribly prepossessing neighborhood, and when we first drove by, I actually didn't see it without a second glance.  Perhaps this has contributed to why the dining room was fairly empty while we were there (at 8pm on a Saturday night).  I found that to really be a shame, because the food was so excellent.  The waiters were also incredibly friendly.  I would definitely recommend trying this place out if you get the chance.",0.9989,0.686,0.267,0.048,0.5099999999999999
2007-09-02,5.0,"Hands down, this is my new favorite restaurant of all time. I've been meaning to try this place for some time now.  I was so sad when I found out that they would be hosting a Yelp event on the 4th and it was already booked up.  Tonight was date night...so we figured it would be the perfect opportunity to try them out since they are minutes from the theater. Rock star parking...can it get any better??? Decor is subtle, classic, and comfortable.   Gregory, our waiter, gets 5 stars alone for friendliness, attention to detail, humor, and service.  I am a huge coffee drinker so it is important for me to state that he understands sugar, cream and coffee ratios.  I was given a fresh cup, not refilled cup every 15 minutes.  That alone earns him 5 stars. We had trouble at first with deciding on what to eat.  Everything sounded incredible.  We opted for the 5 course Tasting Menu.  It's a bit pricey, $65 a person, but Gregory assured us that we would not leave hungry, so that sealed the deal. The artisan breads are to die for. They were paired with peach butter.  We were also given a delicious glass of fresh tomato water infused with olive oil and finely chopped red pepper.  We loved it! 1st course was the best, most perfectly cooked piece of cod that we have ever had in our lives.  The presentation was beautiful, the sauces complimentary. 2nd course was a perfectly seared jump scallop atop yukon mashed potatoes, with pulled tender short rib.  I was already stuffed, but could not stop! 3rd course was an amazing rare seared rack of lamb with chickpeas and beans.  When no one was looking...I snuck the bones to my mouth...I couldn't resist it!!!! 4th course was the best, creamiest and rich duck liver risotto with a balsamic reduction. I was ready to call it quits...all of it was orgasmic!!  The sauce pairings, the presentation, the portions....I think that my eyes were rolled to the back of my head. Gregory surprised us....with 2 insane desserts for our 5th course. A Lemon curd cheesecake with fresh berry sauce and a hot brownie fudge cake topped with ice cream, 2 kinds of chocolate and blueberries. This was an experience, some of the best food and service that we have ever experienced. The Chef is a brilliant genius.  Definitely worth the price.  We are planning to go back in a few weeks to celebrate my husband's birthday with friends. P.S. We had told Gregory that we had a movie to go to before ordering, and he timed everything perfectly....so perfect to be honest...that we had time to run to Target to buy a change of clothes.....Neither of us could breathe in what we were wearing after that incredible meal..we almost skipped the movie...I wish that we had!! 11/18/07 Update. I'm sad to say this, but I'd only give their brunch 2 1/2 stars.  Service and food is not as stellar as it is in the evening.  Maybe it's just that we were spoiled by Gregory.  They have raised their prixe fixe brunch menu to $19.75.  All of the good stuff is an additional $8.  We chose Bloody Mary's as our beverage.  It was not flavorful, spicy and missed the oomph that a good Bloody Mary is often associated with.  They were also out of Bruleed Grapefruit so we were only left with the otpion of Tomato soup or a salad.  I understand that the soup is made out of the juice of fresh tomatoes, the drizzle of virgin olive oil gave it a nice consistency, but it too was bland and boring.  The pastries were good, but not much different from the ones that Alderman Tom Tunney used to serve when he ran Ann Sathers.  For an entree we chose the Chanterelle mushroom omelet, the Eggs Benedict with Canadian ham, and the lobster claw hash.  The lobster claw has was by far the best and noteworthy of all the entrees, but it also cost $28.75. The Eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked, but I thought that it was not worth the hefty $19.75.",0.9991,0.755,0.198,0.047,0.6216176920722375

It was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and I liked the arugula and the brioche roll, and the pate was a nice touch. It was a tad salty, but overall, it was well put together and my server was really friendly and attentive. Why, you ask do I give three stars to such a pleasant experience? My answer, fellow plebeians, is truffle oil.  Truffle oil is like faux-cashmere. At first, you think it's real cashmere. It's all soft and warm and you can't believe you paid so little for it. You love your faux-cashmere and cuddle with it and want to wear it everyday. Then you realize that very cashmere that you love so well has given you a rash and you're itchy all over. You want to return the cashmere for cotton but it's too late because you already have the rash. After eating truffle oil I get this foul chemical taste in my mouth and I'm seriously tasting it right now after consuming so much of it last night.

We did not stay for dessert as I needed to catch a show, but honestly by that point I do not think it would have even been worth the price.

2007-08-02,4.0,A fabulous destination dining restaurant. Come here to celebrate something special. I came with friends for the $10 Kobe beef burgers (usually $20) on Wednesday. I came expecting not too pay too much for dinner but was tempted by the other savories (and sweets!) on the menu. The lobster mashed potatoes are heaven. Big chunks of lobster in creamy whipped potatoes stand vertically in a potato case. Divine. I was  mopping up the potato with anything else I could find. The duck fat fries were good as well but if you're deciding between the two I'd splurge for the $14 potatoes. The seasonal beet salad sounded good but my beets were tasteless. Thank heavens for the cheese on top of the salad and the arugula. For dessert everything sounded indulgent. I went for the cardamon honey cake with fresh figs which was moist and an excellent choice. The space itself is small but cozy. Again a perfect spot for a romantic dinner or special occasion.  The servers were all very nice but a little too gregarious.,0.9961,0.7,0.3,0.0,0.5956766917293234

Went with 5 of my friends to try the prixe fixe brunch menu; oddly enough, the place was totally empty at 1pm on a Sunday.  The food was just alright, I was not terribly impressed but perhaps my hopes were too high?  The scones and pastries were standard, nothing too exceptional.   Between the five of us, we were able to try the baby arugula salad, the ginger carrot soup, and the bruleed grapefruit starters.  Only the grapefruit stood out, in fact, it was the favorite part of my meal!  Incredibly juicy and sweet with a candy/bruleed crust on top, accompanied by some sort of soda which you mixed with the grapefruit juice after devouring the pulp.  Yum! Unfortunately, the brunch entrees were less inspiring and they were out of two different items (out of 8 options).   I found this sort of odd since there was no one else in the restaurant nor was it exceptionally late in the day.  I ended up with some permutation of eggs benedict with over-poached eggs and over salted food.  My friends didn't fare much better, I think the only satisfied customer was the brioche french toast.  The brunch risotto had a cute presentation but wasn't all that tasty and the creme fraiche eggs were...gross.  The duck fat fries came out cold; a new hot order wasn't much better.  In addition, the entrees took forever to come out and one dish was actually forgotten.   2.5 stars because the waiter was obviously embarrassed about the whole situation but still tried really hard and that amazing bruleed grapefruit!",0.9528,0.778,0.132,0.09,0.6281175390266299
2007-07-31,4.0,"I first tried Sweets and Savories a couple of years ago for a Valentine's tasting menu.  The menu was offered for several days in advance, so we were delighted to have the choice of coming on a weekend, even though Valentine's was on a weekday that year.  The fact that it's been two or three years since the first time and I can still remember parts of the meal should tell you something right there.  We kept saying we should try that place again, but somehow, never got around to it. We returned to Sweets and Savories last week before going to a show, and happily, not much has changed.  The menu is small but solid, the waitstaff is attentive but not particularly friendly, and the food is pricey but well worth it.  I panicked about two things unnecessarily-- one, that we would have needed a reservation and/or prettier clothes (nope), and two, that we should have brought our own wine, but again, no problem.  The restaurant is small, but has a pretty nice bar with a limited yet tasty selection of wine and beer.  To eat, I decided on the Lobster Risotto (I think it was an appetizer), worrying about my wallet..  $14, and the amount of lobster in there was astonishing.  The white truffle oil made it a very elegant meal, and even though I initially deflated upon seeing the plate because I thought it wouldn't be enough to satisfy me, it was so rich that I ended up with a few bites to spare.  My friend had the legendary Kobe Beef Burger that he'd been fantasizing about since visiting the restaurant a few years earlier. Unfortunately, it was not a half price night for the burger, but neither the $20 price tag nor the ensuing heart attack bothered my companion much, judging from the happy noises he emitted while devouring it.  I managed to steal a nibble, and it was a bit too dense for my liking, but I suspect he was thrilled at leaving a nice restaurant feeling stuffed, which isn't always the case, 'specially for guys.  Oh, and the duck fat fries were also perfectly delicious--I had half a mind to stash them in my purse for later munching.

2007-05-05,5.0,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago.  The prix fixe tasting menu is absolutely phenomenal...and such bang for the buck.  Brunch is also amazing.  The service is impeccable and often the chef sends over little 'extras' just because.  The atmosphere is cozy, but the bathrooms could use a little work.  The only problem I have with writing this review is that others will find out about this hidden gem and will storm the doors.",-0.0387,0.898,0.056,0.046,0.7303030303030303

2007-04-04,3.0,"After reading some of the negative reviews here, I'm worried that S&S may be losing it's touch and some of it's clientele. No water? Rude wait staff? Thank God the food is consistently good. When the food goes, the establishment goes with it soon after. I haven't been here in a while, so I'm leaving my original review as is (below). I really hope S7S survives and does everything they can to make the dining experience the best they can so as not to waste the efforts of an obviously talented chef. French done well. Could get loud. We dined on a Tuesday night, not more than 10 diners, but the one room dining area held noise. If even one person is smoking, consider it all ""smoking"". We were lucky and didn't experience any smoke. The food was fantastic. Perfect portion sizes. They don't fill you up on free crap before your meals arrive like most American eateries. This place and I think French cooking in general is about real appreciation of the food. The best way to experience this is to retain your hunger and desire throughout the night. Its a respect for the food and yourself, a synergy balanced perfectly here.         Two of us shared the tomato bread soup and a nicely chilled bottle of white wine. Entrees of beef tenderloin and Halibut were excuisite, organic and perfectly prepared. Wow!       The only low mark I had was the dessert. French should do creme brulee much better. The ramican dish was better suited to a small souffle (too deep for creme brulee). A bit soupy and the top was burned. More like homemade vanilla pudding. The complimentry chocolate truffles were nice especially since we didn't opt for the chocolate cake dessert. That would have been too much after a nice, lite meal.      I enjoyed this experience thoroughly. Pleasant wait staff (no annoying busboys to interupt the mood), and she was well versed about their wine offerings and drink menu. Very comfortable ambiance. Parking on the street was OK, but it is a busy intersection. leave enough time to make your reservation.     I'm hooked.",0.9987,0.666,0.282,0.052,0.577659574468085
2007-03-02,4.0,"After having 3 completely different experiences at Sweet and Savories, thought I should share with fellow yelpers.  First time was the Mothers' Day brunch: wasn't so impressed.  Drink was alright, pastries weren't even warm, food was good however. Second time was a Monday night prix fixe special.  That was really impressive.  Besides bringing our own bottle of wine, we were lucky enough to sit next to a wine distributor who brought in at least 6 bottles and willing to share with fellow diners.  What a treat!!  My hubby doesn't like cooked fish, and chef was very accomondating.  The fish course was replaced with a meat course.  No complain there. Last night we went there the 3rd time and had a la carte menu.  Loved the kobe beef foie gras pate burger with duck fat frites.  I agree with Mark S. that it can be my last meal on earth.  The short rib was fantastic too!  The few glitches were their dinner menu was not very readable as their printer ran out of ink, nearly 1/2 of the reds by bottle were out of stock, no creme brulee as the torch broke, only 3 white 1 red were available by the glass.  All in all, food is fantastic for dinners, but the operation can be run a little smoother.  Still would go back over and over again!",0.913,0.835,0.114,0.051,0.4647321428571429

The lobster risotto is pure heaven...the flavors just pop.  I will go back for that and that alone.  I also ordered the Mahi Mahi which came on top of more risotto...a bit too heavy to eat risotto for two courses, but it was my choice, so not a fault of the chef.  My beau had the infamous Kobe burger and enjoyed it very much...although he said he would have liked it cooked a bit more...just personal preference.  We shared the duck fat frites - YUM!  And finished with a milk chocolate pecan pie a la mode...

2007-01-05,5.0,The Kobe Beef/Truffle Mayo/Foie Gras with Duck Fat Frites would be my last meal. It is absolutely decadent.  The other menu items are wonderful as well and I would highly recommend their tasting menus and Prix Fixe menu. The only drawback is location.

2006-12-15,3.0,"I had heard so much about this place, that I couldn't help but be a little disappointed.  I went on a Wednesday when the infamous kobe beef burger was on special for $10 (usually 17).  This burger boasts a 3 inch thick patty of ground kobe beef, topped with foie gras, and truffle mayonaisse.  Well, the only comparison I could make is that it is like eating deep-fried cheesecake baked into a chocolate cake on top of an ice cream sundae...a little too much of a good thing  After finishing less than half the burger, I kind of felt like I ate a stick of butter.  I think it's probably better to spread those ingredients over several different dishes.  But, I would definitely try this restaurant  again, the prix-fixe menu gets a lot of raves as well as the goose fat fries, two things I didn't try.  Also, the ambiance is cozy and the staff is very nice, and the by the glass wine choices were delicious!",0.9872,0.758,0.212,0.03,0.5633219954648526
2006-12-01,3.0,"I was in Chicago for the weekend and this place was recommended to me by someone whose taste buds I respect. I went on a Friday night, but, given that the winter's first snow storm blew in the night before, not many people were out and about and the restaurant had a fairly slow night. Which was just as well because we had a nice and luxuriously slow meal over the course of 2.5 hours! This will be a fairly pricey meal. The tasting menu set us back 60 dollars a pop, then add on the wine and coffee and tip and you're looking at a 200 hundred dollar meal. For my money though, it was a lovely lovely dinner. We had Prince Edward Island mussels, scallop, sea bass, tender and falling off the bone beef short ribs, arugula salad, cherry sake sorbet and finally the warm, dark chocolate fondant cake. The chef is big on sauces - sauces that pop, combinations that you wouldn't think would work, sauces that make you think. Everything was delicious. I did feel though that the risotto and the grits that came with the sea bass and beef respectively were too salty. The service was excellent and the ambiance made for a very romantic dinner. You could tell they pay attention to detail - e.g. the double layered table clothes.  I do have to take off half a star though for the extremely bad cappuccino they served me at the end. It tasted like a mediocre shot dumped into a large ""mocha-style"" cup with another two shots of hot water added to fill in the volume. The cup of coffee I requested as replacement was much more serviceable. Heh, I guess I'm spoiled in the coffee area...",0.9845,0.816,0.138,0.046,0.5479717813051146

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. The food is fresh and imaginative. It is intimate and cozy. No pretention whatsoever.
