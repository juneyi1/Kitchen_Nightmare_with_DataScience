Everything was visibly and edibley fresh which I greatly appreciated. Sweet corn cake, brown sugar-bourbon ice cream, milk jam, smoked almonds $8 - This sounded much better on paper than it tasted going in my mouth. Sadly, the corn cake was a bit dry and I didn't find it had much flavor. Overall just an okay dessert and the crazy part of it all is that between two of us, we didn't finish this dish.

Next was the beef tartare (5 star) with generous truffle shavings, homemade pickle, and egg yolk - YUM!  This gave a complex flavor array that could be enjoyed in multiple different combinations.  The homemade designer pickles were the best I've ever had.   The truffle dessert (4 star) can be broken into a single truffle for $2.50, dark choc truffle with ginger cream.  Delicious!

What I'm looking for in a ""night out,"" is a meaningful experience.. an evening spent with quality people, accented by unique food, drink, atmosphere, and service. I value real food, grown by real farmers and cooked up by food-passionate people. Apparently, however, those values hadn't yet carried over into my wine choices.. until last night!  Our server, whose name slips my memory, took my open-to-suggestion-ness and examples of the kinds of wine that I like, as a window of opportunity to gently school us (.. err.. me;)) on modern-day wine-making, what makes it not-so-fantastic, as well as sharing some examples of natural, quality wine, and even suggested a chapter from the book, ""American Terroir,"" called ""The Farm Girl and the Pole Dancer."" Perfectly ironic. He has now forever changed my perspective on wine! He even brought us two wine glasses and the remainder of a bottle (that would not be finished as they are closed today), to share amongst ourselves. He said it would go well with all of the food we were eating and told us all about the wine, the meaning of the name, how it's made and the wine-maker. It was absolutely lovely. Babiole. While many servers in today's hiptastic world may have chosen to judge my cluelessness and apparent unrefined taste in wine, along with my lack of bangs, oxfords, and a bun, and have likely blown me off, he really just cared about sharing information, passion, good food and wine.

Food wise, here's the road we went:  (and keep in mind, there were 4 of us, so the bill was actually almost $300 for what I""m about to say + drinks) Starters - rabbit terrine dish, beef tartar and olives.  All good, friends raved about tartar but I'm not much of a fan.  For $6 the olives are a great deal.   Dinners - Rabbit leg, wild boar pasta & mussels & everyone was happy with the entrees.  I wish I would've gotten the boar pasta but my waiter talked me into the rabbit.  Again, good, but boar was better and cheaper.   Desserts - Both incredibly forgettable to me and both had a weird amount of almonds on them.  They were truly so unimpressive I can't even go beyond the description of ""the chocolate one"" and ""the one with the super soft cake on the bottom"" (I will say I'm not a huge dessert person, I'd rather start over and get more olives!) I really did like the food but service was another factor.  And to be honest, service personally wasn't even horrible (let's be clear, was not great either), but when you see your waiter shitting on the bus boy on three different occasions, you tend to judge the service.  Also, we were told 45 minutes for our reservation and waited a lot longer and went up 3 separate times to ask for updates.  The host was nice and bought us dessert but with the length of time we waited extra, that was another round of drinks, which did not equate in cost to the free desserts.",0.9837,0.738,0.167,0.095,0.6060185185185185

Then the second item that the waiter raved about, he forgot to actually send to our table and charged us for the other item that he mistakenly sent to us.  We also had to walk up to the bar to ask for our server to come back and actually bring us our check after we hadn't seen him for over 15 minutes. Then finally, (this should never happen at a place classified a ""wine bar"") my last glass of wine had an obscene amount of sediment in it.

I didn't feel like I was putting anybody off, or making a big deal about my diet choice either which really speaks to their level of customer service.  All of our food was fantastic, and our server even comped the dessert wine since it was my birthday. Really put a cherry on a fantastic night.  The second time I was there, I went with my boyfriend. We had an equally fantastic time! We ended up having the same server (so once again excellent service, wish I knew his name!) who recommended a fantastic white wine to pair with my sea bass (pescatarian now). Boyfriend had the wild boar ragu which he thought was also amazing.  Dessert is a must here! I can't rave enough about this restaurant.

After poking around the interwebs (and waiting til really last minute to make a reservation), Telegraph seemed to have exactly what I was looking for - great wine list, delicious food and a fun vibe for a night out.  So, we made our way to Telegraph on Saturday night. After plotting over the online menu, we had decided what we wanted to order. And yes, I know that things on the online menus are ALWAYS subject to change,  but I was REALLY looking forward to the kale salad. Which wasn't there. It was replaced by some grilled lettuce & buttermilk dressing salad. HUGE let down for me. Especially after the husband ordered a beer from the draught list that was ""not actually on tap yet, we are waiting for the Oktoberfest keg to run out"". Really? Then don't have it on the menu. Two strikes on menu let downs and we hadn't even ordered yet.  Another huge let down? When I finished my first glass of wine, which was decent, I ordered a glass of the same thing. I got something totally different. Not a huge issue, but if they ran out of the first wine, MENTION it. Don't assume I won't notice. Oh well. The food was good, but not enough to overcome the letdown of the menu & somewhat blunt/dissappearing service we seemed to get.  The atmosphere itself was nice. It's a happening place with lots of conversations going, which can get loud if you are looking for a quiet place.  Also, don't order the rum truffle dessert for your birthday.

A couple of months ago Telegraph was doing a North Carolina tasting menu, and I opted for the middle dish, shrimp and grits.  I've been on a big shrimp and grits lately and this was excellent; as good as the version Jared Wentworth does at Longman & Eagle and Dusek's, and as good as shrimp and grits I've had at New Orleans.  I don't know whether this will become a regular menu option, but they did have a Spanish preparation of prawns, which while much different in flavor looked just as delicious when our neighboring diners ordered it. Other excellent options include octopus salad, and, when they have it, venison.  But if you, like me, have stayed away in the past, Telegraph really turned a corner in 2013 and are worth another look.",0.9676,0.863,0.126,0.011,0.4638000888000888

We were floored at the fact that we seemed completely non-existent to the waiter as he ran around to all the other tables talking and helping them.  Did we do something wrong we thought?  My boyfriend spoke to the manager afterwards who didn't have much to say at all, so we left there pretty mad and very disappointed.  Would I go there again?- Maybe.  I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt but if I do go back it probably won't be for a long time...",0.9379,0.836,0.102,0.062,0.5393790849673202

He came back a couple minutes later and gave me a full glass of my selection, but everyone else at the table got the leavings of the glasses offered to us to try.  Ugh.  I've never had this happen at any restaurant and even though we were a family, I don't want to be sharing wine from a communal cup.

There were long waits between courses and no explanations/apologies from the waiter. Our party was 3 couples.

Five of our party ordered the wine dinner -- 3 courses with wine pairings from Sicily. At $50, it looked to be a great deal. i ordered a roasted carrot starter and braised rabbit pappardelle. Nice flexibility that the waiter allowed 3 of our group to swap out the beef tongue starter for something different. All the starters were good. The beef tongue was very tasty. The roasted carrots were good, and a surprisingly large portion. After that though, things began to go downhill. The wait between the starter and second course, a lamb dish, was noticeably long. No explanation from the waiter. When it did arrive, it was good. After very long wait -- during which the waiter did come by and say ""Your dishes will be up soon"" though we still had a further 5-7 minute wait -- the pasta dishes arrived.

Our waiter was new, which is fine, but he at times made the evening awkward and uncomfortable as he would stand next to our table and not saying anything. It was especially weird when we were all in the middle of a conversation and would catch a glance of him just standing there staring. He did not know the menu and was unable to explain anything to us besides a few things he had tried in the past.

Decor: Nice place, well appointed, comfortable Waitstaff: Young guy, seemed very inexperienced, not sure if it will improve with practice.  F'rinstance, we're about 40 years older than he, yet in making some carual conversation with him, he kept denying some things we remember about Logan Square over the years.  Not really a big deal but doesn't set the warmest tone.  If he doesn't know something, I'd rather have him say that.  Again, we were just making conversation to get started, not quizzing him.  He was pretty hit or miss showing up to the table.  Bus staff was good. He also did the one thing I cannot stand.  When I ask staff for a choice between 2 dishes, just tell me what the hell you would have.  I know they are different (don't say that), I know the description (I can read), I know all the chefs dishes are delicious.  Sheesh.  Again, I'm chalking these things up to inexperience but maybe the chef can teach him.  When I asked ""is this wine sweet"" the answer is not to point me to a sweet wine, which I didn't want, the answer is yes or no.  He was at least sharp enough to read my dinner partner's reaction to the mussels and comp the dish (see below) so points for that. Now the food. We started with a signature gin cocktail, glass of Muscadet and then a bottle of sparkling Vouvray for the whole meal.  All very good although the Vouvray could have been a little colder.  Too bad they couldn't spring for champagne flutes but times are tough.  Regardless, no points off for that.  All in all, very happy with the liquor. Starters:  country pate and oysters. While the pate had nice flavor, the consistency was odd.  Very dense even in texture.  Best comparison is a roll of summer sausage squared off and sliced.  Again, not terrible, but not the taste or texture I usually l expect in a simple pork pate.  Maybe I should've asked if they make it on site. The toasted brioche-like bread was ver nice.  The oysters had a good flavor but an unusually soft texture and almost a film coating them which I'm hoping wasn't because they were getting on in age.  They smelled and looked fine.  They came with a weak mignonette that I thought could've used more acidity and pepper.  Speaking of acidity, the lemon piece with the oysters seemed pre-zested.  Again, I know times are tough but that seems a bit too frugal.  I wouldn't want to think they are cutting corners. It was tough to decide entrees, several things look good.  My dinner partner got mussels, I got the green bean/soft boiled egg salad and 3 cheeses. The mussels were kind of chewy and the flavor seemed ""off"".  Any other mussel eaters will know what I mean.  The cooking liquid was good, but not good enough to finish the bowl of mussels. The green beans in the salad seemed raw.  I think even a 30 second blanche would have brightened them up in color and flavor.  Egg was perfect (mollet), viniagrette tasty. The cheese I would give good marks to but there was one (sorry, I forgot name) served with a relish that must have been made of habanero peppers.  Thank god I had it last because it would've ruined the rest of the plate.  Couldn't finish that cheese. For dessert, I got Junior Mints at the theatre. In sum, if somebody asked to go here/meet here, I'd be OK, but not particularly inspired to go back on my own.

We ordered 8 plates to share among the table (there were six of us)...keep in kind that we ordered all 8 plates to share, so they should have just come or whenever they were ready..  First two plates came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Then the plates are cleared.....and then we wait 1.5 hours for the next plate to come!  I complain about the wait to our server (who also wasn't that great and who only stopped by once during our 1.5 hour hiatus bc we asked the busboy to flag him down so that we could order more drinks) and he just said the kitchen was backed up.  I have a feeling the server saw us as a six top with guaranteed tip, hence blowing us off...or he's just really bad.  At any rate, the remaining six plates basically come out all at once.....poor timing.  The grape leaf wrapped fish was raw in the middle, so we had to send back.  The potatoes in the sirloin dish was raw.  The salad (which came at the very end of the meal....something the server played off as intentional) was totally doused in vinegar and was inedible. Pretty sure there is a new kitchen staff.  Our server was really underwhelming, too.  Considering he wasn't serving us any food for 1.5 hours, I honestly have no idea what he was doing since he never stopped by.  Took me 40 min to get another beer. The manager came by upon my request and he was deeply apologetic and comped the meal, which was fair given the circumstances (service was so bad, however, that some family members were still upset that a dinner could be ruined that badly.....it was worse than free).  I left a 20% tip, but only bc the busboy was great and didn't want to stiff him.  The server deserved little....he was (albeit polite) extremely inattentive and aloof.  Not sure I'd ever come back for dinner.  This might be a spot for a drink and an app, but they can't handle a dinner service....consider them to be more of a bar than a restaurant.  Longman has much better service despite the longer wait.",-0.7726,0.851,0.066,0.082,0.5649834661462569

I came back again this week with my boyfriend and a travelzoo tasting voucher.  It was one of the top meals we've had this year so far.  We were blown away.  The only complaint I can think of is that my unfinished plate and wine was removed when I stepped outside for a min to say hello to a friend.  I know I had a few more bites and sips left!  But that is small and it was 7 courses.  I didn't leave hungry. We started w/ oysters and bubbly.  Fantastic!  Then some beer and crustinis.  They had to make some adjustments b/c I don't eat pork but it was in our favor.  I had this warm escolar which knocked my socks off.  I wanted 100 more.  And a smoke anchovy which was not at all like the salty fish that you get in a caesar salad.  My boyfriend liked his ham ones too.  Then shrimp and polenta which was creamy and sour in the right places.  Very rich and yummy.  Then some black pasta which was when I dipped outside for a min.  So the cheese was great but we don't know what kind it was.  The hearty bread that comes with it is great by itself!  And finally rhubarb bread pudding with a creamy sauce.  I was dipping the cheese bread in that sauce!  The dessert was served with a raspberry eau de vie which I enjoyed on its own but it sort of clashed w/ the dessert for me.  My boyfriend called it fire water. I will definitely be back.  We told our main guy that we wanted to do it all again but he said we probably can't b/c they're so seasonal.  I like that!

My wife and I went here for a date night while grandma was watching the baby.  We were seated immediately in a dim but not too dark seating area with high top tables and a small bar to sit at.  There were several other couples and one group of 4 so it was not dead but not crazy busy either.  We were immediately brought menus and water.  A second server came and took our initial drink order while we looked over the menu.  We decided to go for the 4 course dinner with wine pairing which was priced very reasonably at $55.  With every glass of wine we received a brief description of its origins and what types of flavor to expect.  The wines were paired quite well and complimented the flavors in each course very nicely.  After our third course the waitress informed us there had been a mix up and they had not started our final course yet but it would be up shortly.  She had brought us an olive sampler and topped off our wine free of charge to hold us over.  My wife and I looked at each other and said.. woo hoo!  We didn't feel like it had been very long since our previous course but they kept insisting and even topped off our wine glasses once more before bringing the final course.  We left feeling as though they had gone above and beyond to ensure we had the best experience possible.  The food had been amazing and when we commented on the flavor of the coffee rubbed steak they brought us out the rub recipe written on the back of a menu.  Definitely will be going back here and bringing friends and family.

We were bummed that at 9pm, several of the items on the menu were sold out.  While this means high turnover and thus very fresh food, it's still disappointing not to get a dish you had previously honed in on.  We started with a cheese plate and oysters.  The cheese plate was arranged extremely artistically, and the various cheeses were delicious, especially when paired with the various fruit jams.  The oysters however were a miss.  Not only were they expensive, but they were also somewhat flavorless (perhaps a little too clean).  And they weren't shucked all that cleanly.   The wait for our entrees lasted about 45 minutes, which was odd because by then much of the restaurant had started to empty out.  I ordered the poached flounder.  When it arrived, I was a little surprised because it looked like an item off of a tasting menu.  Very small morsels of flounder.  (almost appetizer-esque).  They tasted just ok (craving a bit of acid for sure).   Nothing was horribly wrong with the food, but except for the cheese plate, it also wasn't terribly inspired.  High prices, trendy atmosphere = high expectations.  Telegraph did not meet them.",-0.5857,0.854,0.068,0.078,0.625552054154995

2013-03-02,4.0,"When a friend suggested this for dinner on a recent Wintry night, I jumped at the chance to go as Telegraph has been on my list for awhile now. He had made reservations but given I was the first to arrive, I took a seat at the bar to wait and to begin to explore their interesting wine list.  While I consider myself to be fairly schooled in California wines, Telegraph's claim to fame is a unique list of European wines produced by small, often family owned vineyards.  So there was nothing on the list I knew well which just made the experience so much more interesting for me. The bartender was great.  He offered me up a taste of something pretty close in to what I asked for which was a big Cab, and while the taste of the red blend was good, it was not going to take me on any kind of taste adventure.  So when I asked him what he suggested, he pointed me toward the ""Foradori"".  This was a lovely wine, big almost Syrah like.  So I was a happy camper while I waited for my friend to arrive. Once he did- they showed us to our table which was in a room on the other side of the bar.  A great choice as it was at least 10 degrees warmer than the bar and while the decor isn't fancy- it's a comfortable setting. We ordered simply- since my friend had been here before, he took hold of knowing just what to order.  The mushroom tartine to start was quite good and came with a red egg to break and sop up with the bread.  Delicious! For our entree, we split the meat plate which had a variety of grilled meats on it as well as quail.  Also quite good.   But the real winner for me was the side dish that we ordered.  This vegetarian dish could have been an amazing entree as the smells that wafted up from it had me drooling when it arrived at the table next to us.  The base of cannelloni beans in a smoked tomato sauce with fennel and sunchokes was amazing!   I seriously wanted to lick the plate, although I am quite sure my dining companion would not have been too pleased to see me do that!   Service was spot on and I filed away this place as that perfect place for great wine, a great dinner and some great conversation given even full it never got too loud to talk. If you drive- they have valet on the weekends (or so I was told) but if you go through the week you may struggle a bit as most of the parking on the surrounding streets is permit only.  If all else fails- know that there is a paid parking lot across the street.

Service was impeccable, our server was very knowledgeable about the wine list but he also brought the wine buyer over to provide further insight and recommendations when we were playing with a few different options. All of our dishes were excellent. The octopus was very well prepared, tender, and delicious - some of the better prepared I have ever had. Their soup special was very impressive, delicious seafood broth, baby scalllops, clams. The sourdough tartine with chevre and blueberries was a great combination of flavors with an equeally pleasing presentation. We also had the seared venison loin and beef bourguignon. Both of these were impressive and delicious as well then we rounded it out with a plate of cheeses that were fantastic.  I struggle with giving Telelgraph 4 or 5 stars. I settled with 4 because I'm saving 5 stars for something over the top that completely blows me away.

Food does some great plays on Spanish food.  Perhaps the hipsters in the hood think Spanish cuisine is based around Uncle Bens Rice and Shrimp which may skew their pallets.

2012-12-16,1.0,"Why is this restaurant named Telegraph?  Is it because I felt like our waiter was trying to decipher Morse code to ""get the hint"" that my friend and I were underwhelmed with the quality of the service and the food?  Or maybe because if management told the truth and named the restaurant Passenger Pigeon, no one will go there? The evening was off to a promising start: the wine list piqued the interest of a Spanish oenophile such as myself - listan prieto from Tenerife and some of the nicer Rioja wines from Lopez de Heredia.  Our waiter seemed accommodating and friendly enough, asking if we had any questions about either the wine or the menu.  Maybe this particular waiter thought that my friend and I didn't need bread due to our already ""feminine builds"", but the two of us were slightly annoyed that everyone around us received some pre-dinner carbohydrates and we didn't.  But because we each planned on eating a three course dinner, we didn't pay much mind. As an appetizer, I ordered the pumpkin soup.  The presentation was artistic and interesting - the venison tartare was placed along the diameter of the bowl and the waiter poured the soup such that the formation was like a half moon.  The pumpkin soup was a flavorful blend of spices with the odd gherkin or two for garnish.  The venison was tender, not overly gamey, and paired nicely with the soup. My friend didn't look too enthused though - and as I tasted her sourdough tartine, I understood why.  The dish was just overdone with goat cheese to the point that I couldn't detect the taste of anything else.  And this is coming from someone who loves cheese. For my main course, I had the braised Spanish octopus (no surprise there!).  To put it nicely, Telegraph's rendition of one of my beloved Galician dishes repulsed me.  It wasn't the cauliflower garnish or the chickpeas that completely drowned out the flavor of what should be something tender, delicate, and simple.  Instead, it was the octopus drowning in a caper viniagrette paste - the flavors were just too strong and the octopus just too rubbery to make this dish worth finishing. And then there was the dessert.  Nevermind that it took 15 minutes to place our dessert order.  Why, oh why, did Time Out Chicago list the Hot Buttered Rum Cake as one of the Top 100 things that they've eaten this year?  I could drink a handle of rum, eat this cake, and still not find it appetizing in the slightest.  For starters, the cake itself had a stale taste and texture - it reminded me of the bread that you would use to make French toast or torrijas because it absorbs whatever you're soaking it with.  The rum and butterscotch could not salvage such a bland cake. My friend probably had it much worse with her ice-cold chocolate brownie that had the consistency of stale marzipan and the waxy chocolate flavor of cheap Easter candy.  The two of us each had a bite of our respective desserts and stopped eating.  (My friend and I are the types of girls who never refuse dessert and always lick our plates clean.)  Our waiter stopped by, another 15 minutes later, to ask if he could clear our plates.  He didn't even ask whether we enjoyed the dessert, if there was a problem, etc.  My friend had to let him know that the dessert was inedible.  He unapologetically scoffed and stormed off. 10 minutes later, we were able to get our waiter's attention to receive the cheque.  He threw the bill down on the table and brusquely said, ""I took the desserts off of the bill"".  Gee thanks, man. This was one of the few times in my life that I have tipped a paltry 11%.  I have been to many restaurants in Chicago where the food is atrocious, but the front of house service has typically been pleasant and welcoming.  For such a highly rated restaurant that gets so much positive press, I expected much better from Telegraph.",0.997,0.813,0.143,0.044,0.486443137575213

Seems like the same goes for the staff. Telegraph is great for a girls night out, a date night, or really any occasion!

It wasn't bad by any means, but nothing about it made me want to order it again, and for $14 for a tiny pour, it's not worth the cash in my opinion. I'm a huge fan of their cheese selection, but was also again disappointed with the tiny amount of cheese you actually get. Regardless, the three our server recommended tasted great and were quite unique!  For my entree I had the Amish chicken (with shitake mushrooms, pickled pumpkin, carpano antica vermouth, and spiced brioche buns.) I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor of this dish, but the chicken was cooked perfectly and the pumpkin was a great touch. The brioche buns were hard and without much flavor, and I just found the dish a little mediocre. My friends ordered other entrees though and were huge fans, so you're bound to find something you like. When it comes to desserts I always want to try everything, so we each picked one... my choice? The ice box cake. Chocolate wafers, white chocolate/banana mousse, crushed pistachio, and banana bread ice cream. It was really great!

2012-11-11,3.0,"I will start this review off by saying that I had wanted to dine at Telegraph since it opened and had high expectations. So when our anniversary dinner happened, the bf surprised me with dinner at Telegraph. I was hungry and ready for a mind-blowing meal. We walked into the dimly lit restaurant in Logan Square and as soon as we were seated I realized how loud it was. We had to shout to talk to one another, but it added for a more lively environment. Our waited recommended a great bottle of wine and helped us choose some dishes to share. We love oysters and started with them. Artfully arranged on a plate, this was a gorgeous looking appetizer. Unfortunately the taste was so incredibly fishy that I could barely eat one. As someone who appreciates good oysters I was disappointed. Especially for $15-18 dollars this was not worth it. We continued our meal with the grilled octopus. The plate arrived and was once again gorgeous. I soon realized that the dish was dominated by chickpeas with about 4 pieces of octopus. Another rip-off in my mind for the high price we paid. The octopus was cooked well, but there was not nearly enough. The beef bourginon was next and it was a decent portion, but once again nothing spectacular. The flavors weren't very complex and the meat seemed like something I would be able to create at home.  My favorite part of the meal at Telegraph was our last dish. We ordered the pork should that was accompanied by a pasta. It was rich and complex and everything I would have expected from a restaurant with as much hype as Telegraph. I wish everything I ordered that night were as delicious as the pork shoulder.  Overall I was very disappointed with my time at Telegraph. Besides the food that I didn't care for, the prices were high and we felt very rushed.

The servers all seem to know their wines very well and they do a fantastic job helping you narrow your choices. For a place so focused on wine, I am a little surprised that they didn't have flights on the menu, but they do have discounts on carafes for some of their higher end wines. This works best in a small group as you can all get a glass of something a bit out of your normal price range. Where I think Telegraph falters is in the food. Their food is very good, but its very overpriced given the quality. I tried a few of their small plates and I wouldn't have been terribly disappointed if I hadn't spent so much on them.

Our fun personalities made it a good evening, but ultimately everything about the drinking/dining experience was just ok.  Oysters were very good (and a good deal at $1/ea from 5-7pm).   Wasn't familiar with most of the by the glass options, so thought that was a bit limiting but asked the server for suggestions for red, but didn't love them.  He seemed a bit smug and he and the food runners wanted to clear our cheese plate before we were finished - about 5 times in 15 minutes, all while there was cheese still on the plate.  I actually asked one of them if they were running out of plates.  Perhaps...but more likely they were just trying to clear us out which seemed to be confirmed when one of the hosts kept leaning over our table staring at us.  He, and not our server ultimately gave us our bill.

And while it wasn't bad, it definitely wasn't up to all the hype by a long shot to me.  I made a reservation, but they were ""full"" until 8pm. That's fine. But when my friend and I got there, the place was half empty.  But whatever, I don't work in that industry, I'm sure it was packed earlier... Anyway...  Service: The service wasn't very good- our waitress seemed shy, and very quiet. Much too quiet for a noisy restaurant. She didn't come to our table for about 15 minutes after we were seated, or tell us anything about the menu, or what wines we could pair with our apps or dinner. She never checked on us during our meal. I don't think she was too busy, I'm not sure where she was or what she was doing. I'm sure she was very nice, but I'll never know. It also took about an hour from the time we ordered our dinners (which was after we were served our appetizer- weird) until they were finally delivered to us.  Food: We started with the green olives, salumi, pickled peppers, white cheddar curd appetizer. It was a bowl of olives with a few scraps of the other items thrown in- a negligible quantity, and served with garlic bread. It was good, but not impressive.  My friend ordered the braised spanish octopus, bay scallops, marinated chickpeas, roasted cauliflower, poached egg, and LOVED it. It had tons of flavor, and just the right portion.   I ordered the seared black cod, manila clams, p.e.i. mussels, iberico chorizo, conchiglie pasta, tomato, spanish cider, kohlrabi. I was underwealmed, to say the least. The fish and seafood were cooked perfectly, but it didn't have any flavor. At all. I found myself searching around for salt and pepper, but there wasn't any. It was drowning in tomato sauce too. And I'm pretty sure there wasn't any iberico chorizo in my dish, and I think there were 4 pieces of the pasta. It was hard to tell, everything was just so bland, it all tasted the same.   Because it was my birthday, I felt I needed to get a dessert. But nothing looked appealing to me on the dessert menu! I ended up getting the caramel apple pie, cheddar cheese crust & tuile, hazelnut streusel, cinnamon whipped creme, vanilla sauce. It was a mini apple pie with a cheese cookie-like thing sticking out of it. It was ok, but not great.  Wine: I actually had to stop our server to ask if we could order wine after we'd ordered our dinners. At a wine bar. I showed her which one we were thinking of and asked if it would go with our dinners, and she shrugged and said that it should. Huh? It was a Hungarian Weninger (?) red wine, and ended up being just ok, not great.

2012-10-14,4.0,"This is a nice little wine bar in Logan Square with dark wood paneling and trendy wineglass-shaped globe lamps over the bar. They have an interesting list of whites, reds, rosés, oranges (made from white grapes that have been macerated in contact with the grape skins), and dessert wines.  We started out with a bottle of the 2010 Casa de Mouratz Biotite Vinho Verde from Portugal, a white with just the right touch of tartness, which went great with the cheese platter and the seared veal sweetbreads (which are actually animal organs like the pancreas or the thymus. But don't let it scare you off - they taste great). The 2010 Pierre Breton Franc de Pied, a Cabernet Franc from France, was a nice complement to the braised pork bellies and the pork and beef meatballs, which came in a hearty tomato roux sauce with chunks of gordal green olives.  For dessert, my husband and I split the malted chocolate mousse, in a luscious amaretto stewed cherry sauce with chunks of white Rocher chocolate, and our dining companions had the caramel apple pie. The desserts can be paired with recommended liquors on request (and for an extra price).  BTW, the food here is served ""small plate"" style, so if you have a large appetite you might want to get several dishes since one probably won't be enough for you. The four of us shared four dishes and two desserts, and we were more than satisfied.  If you're on a budget, though, you may have to spring for only one dish and a few glasses of wine, then go someplace cheaper for more food. The only drawback to this place is that it's a tad pricey for such small portions (the tab came to over $160 per couple). Apparently Telegraph uses local, organic meats and produce and naturally-made wines, which probably accounts for the higher prices since they cost more to produce.

2012-08-11,4.0,"There are, obviously, a lot of restaurants in Chicago, enough so that there's really no point in attending any one twice. In order to merit repeat patronage, a restaurant needs a winning combination of amicable staff, inviting interior, accessibility, and of course, excellent food and drink. Telegraph is the rare establishment that meets all of these criteria.  Let's start with the decor, about which I only comment if it is horrendous or excellent; Telegraph, with its nonsense-free lamps, wooden tables, floor, and bar, is the latter. The space tells prospective diners right away that it's all about great food and wine, no frills. Olives ($7), served with generous portions of grilled bread, salami, and hard cheese are pretty much a standard offering at Mediterranean restaurants, but still, this was a very good iteration. Foie gras ($20) is served in seared form rather than pate form, and comes with grilled pineapple and coconut; the foie is heavenly, and the accompaniments are a welcome change from the standard currant and/or onion marmalade, although the coconut does feel a bit odd. Tuna ($16) is served poached Nicoise-style, with a soft-boiled egg, a boiled tomato, pickled olives, frisee. The accoutrements surrounding the fish were very good takes on the traditional Nicoise flavors, especially the egg (with deliciously runny yolk); however, the poached tuna was a little overdone, and as a result, fairly dry. This was the closest thing to a disappointment we experienced all night, and probably kept Telegraph from 5 stars. Pork belly ($18) picks up the slack and then some; a generous portion of surprisingly lean belly is served simply, with piquant chimichurri and a mild sweet corn puree. This was a nearly perfect dish, which is subtle but still packed with flavor. Telegraph also has the best ""blue plate"" special in this city (though I'm admittedly no connoisseur of these): before 7 PM, oysters are $1, with surprisingly good variety (some large and meaty, others small and creamy). Pain perdu dessert ($8) is an absolute homerun; it smells incredible, and is served with fresh peaches and blackberries, peach-caramel compote, and peach grass ice cream. It may sound like too much peach, but each element encapsulated a different element of the fruit. In particular, that ice cream (which almost seemed to be infused with peach rather than directly flavored with it) might have been the best I've ever had.  Wines are all old-world (glasses $8-$14); we tried a few glasses, all of which were recommended by the excellent waitstaff to go with our food. Beer list is short but sweet, again focusing on imports (an offering from Dupont, as well as the Diversey and Lille collaboration between a French brewery and Two Brothers). All in all, Telegraph pretty much does everything right that I want a restaurant to do right. If I lived in Logan square I'd probably be back weekly for wine and oysters; as it is, I envision this place making it into my rotation of regular haunts.",0.9976,0.775,0.181,0.044,0.547150963790308

2012-07-17,4.0,"Yup, Telegraph was as good as advertised. It has received a lot of attention and was on Chicago Magazine's Top 20 for 2012. The theme is euro wine bar with american food, and the setting is awesome with wood everywhere, clean lines, very knowledgeable and friendly staff and plenty of choices for food/drink. The menu is simple with just four relatively small sections: hors d'oeuvre, fish, meat and cheese (and dessert of course). However, the relative small size of the menu is more than made up for with high quality and interesting flavors throughout. The first main decision is wine, and there is no shortage of options. I don't mind that they avoid the 'flight' style of wine bar - just order a glass or bottle and explore the variety of options. I got the lucky invite to join Doug and Mish Malcom on this adventure and we started the night by making another friend named Judith. She just happens to be an Austrian wine from 2009 'judith beck' (a great springtime red, medium-full bodied, w/dark rhubarb, leafy greens and peppery spice). It was delicious and perfect for the occasion. We enjoyed the small plate style and ordered a bunch of stuff and one thing twice (meatballs!). Oysters were only $1 each so we did a half dozen in addition to trying the baby kale salad (their version of a caesar), pork and beef meatballs, seared scallops, housemade fettuccine with rabbit, and finally olive oil poached albacore tuna (and we also ordered another round of meatballs for good measure).  We had a lot of favorites - great meatballs with awesome olive sauce (and I dislike olives), tasty oysters, really good salad (with a pickled egg too) and a delicious scallop dish with a fun and refreshing grapefruit foam/slices. The tuna was the worst dish - pretty bland and dry, and the pasta with rabbit was just ok (I didn't love the pasta texture) but the sauce was nice. All said we had a great meal and a great time drinking two bottles of wine and ordered food to try a lot of different things.

2012-07-07,4.0,"I came here with my girlfriend after my date canceled on me. And thank god he did! The chump had lost his id, so my night was headed into byob-ville. Thankfully, my friend stepped up and we went out like adults. So, having said that, I read a ton of reviews on this place, and most of them are spot on. The wine list is extensive, and the staff really know what they're talking about. My friend and I had decided on an ""orange"" wine (those exist?!) and consulted with our server. He basically grilled us on what we wanted, and then suggested something completely different. We decided we'd take his suggestion and were not disappointed. What he suggested was the 2010 Bellotti. It's a delicious crisp clean white. Which is funny, because neither of us is a white wine person. And we both said as much after we finished the bottle ""Funny, I usually don't drink whites when I'm just having wine with a girlfriend, but this was fantastic!"" So, after that we both went for a walk on the wild side and just ordered a glass of whatever sounded good. I got a glass of of the Matin Calme Grenache Blanc -which was our original choice until our server described it as similar to kombucha - at which point we decided maybe we should go with his suggestion. Anyway, it was amazing. It's a little.. organic, it had sediment, I don't mind things that get a little messy so I loved it. My friend has a glass to the nv valli unite. Also delicious.   I wouldn't describe it as cute and homey, as it was pretty crowded and lively as we walked in, and the hostess said that this was a slow night. The atmosphere here is a little more casual than I would have thought. It's not a typical wine bar in the way that you imagine a wine bar as being very quiet, demure, possibly with soft music, and tinkling laughter. This was definitely robust, lots of loud laughter, voices, and background noise. I think this is actually preferable, I feel like the very quiet very low key atmosphere makes me feel akward about laughing out loud.

The ambiance is perfect for a date, low lighting, candles, groovy music that's subtle enough to be in the air but not intrusive. Initially we thought we'd just have a drink. I ordered a glass of wine recommended by the bar tender, it was very good, fruity and smooth and $10 - seems reasonable. The man ordered a martini which sadly did not come in a martini glass? Maybe cause he's a man?? Then we decided we'd try to cheese flight for a snack and bottle of red. The cheese, admittedly pricey, $35 for 6 ""slices"" was delicious! I loved them all!! The plate came with some hot buttered toast and lots of accompanying nibbles, apples slices, cherries, honey and some kind of sweet nutty jelly that may have been prune or fig?

I had tried to eat here a couple of times before, but it was always on the weekend and the wait was 2+ hours, which I wasn't willing to do. This time, however, we came right after work on a weeknight and had no problem getting a table. In fact, the place was pretty much empty. I don't drink wine, but the waiter seemed very knowledgeable and recommended several varieties to my friend. I ordered a Tom Collins and the waiter asked me what it was. That seemed like a potential red flag. Fortunately, the bartender knew exactly what it was because my drink was superb. We started with the creamed swiss chard tartine with roasted cauliflower gratin. It was pretty good. My only problem with it was that it seemed overly salty to me. (I'm not sure why, but I feel like every time I go to a nicer restaurant, they salt the hell out of everything.) For the main course, I had the house-made squid ink bowtie pasta with sepia chorizo, spring peas, tomato concasse, white wine, and shallots. While this dish tasted great, it was quite small. The tartine appetizer was bigger than this main course. Also, the bowtie pasta was cooked unevenly. Some pieces were al dente and others were almost crunchy in the middle at the ""tie."" My friend had the whole trout, which seemed to be a normal size for an entree. She said it was quite good. Aside from the food, the space is nice. The music, however, was a bit bizarre. When we got there, they were playing some sort of extremely loud punk music. Considering there were only about 5 people in the place, it was way too loud.

We asked if there was anything else available and they brought us to a table near the windows in the second room. A little chilly but at least we're back to being good. Our waiter was really impressive. He knew that wine list backwards and forwards and backwards again. Down to the most pedantic details. The g/f started with the salad which was nice and light but a little overdressed. I went with the snails which were really awesome. For entrees, she went with the duck and sweetbreads while I ordered a peppery sausage pasta. Both were really delicious but her duck and sweetbreads totally blew my mind.

But everything we ate was delicious. We started with the swiss chard and cauliflower gratin, which was spectacular. We also had the green olives, pickled peppers, cheese curd salad and that was also delicious. We split the arugula fettucine with peekytoe crab and babyneck clams, which had a surprising heat to it. It was a welcome spiciness, though - the dish was great! And we also enjoyed the cheese platter and the bittersweet chocolate cheesecake (that came with cookies that melt in your mouth). So, as I said, the food was fantastic. And the gentleman who brought our food out seemed to really know alot about what he was serving and seemed passionate about i. I definitely recommend it. However, the reason I'm only giving this 2 stars is because of our wine server (not sure if he's a sommelier or not). Being passionate about what you're serving is one thing - being condescending is another. I was with two friends and we all agreed that he was talking down to us. Each time we ordered a glass and he walked away, we all sort of hung our heads and discussed how stupid he made us feel. Before ordering my first glass of wine, I mentioned that I noticed there were no New Zealand whites on the wine list. He told me ""in order to make it onto our wine list, you have to have been producing wine for over 100 years. We don't carry 'New World' wines."" I chuckled and said that the reason I noticed it was because I usually prefer a white wine with the minerality of a New Zealand/Marlborough white and he replied by telling me that ""88% of wines in that region are made by robots, we won't carry that sort of wine"". Okay, so that's what I was to be dealing with. I reviewed the options for red and he tried to help me. I say tried because instead of being helpful, he seemed frustrated that we weren't wine connosieurs, but rather casual wine enjoyers. After one particular glass, he came over to ask how I liked it (after he had told me when I ordered it that I wouldn't like it) and I told him that the bouquet and initial taste almost reminded me of a port wine but then it finished very differently. He stood there for a minute with a look that said ""lady, you're off your rocker"" and I'm pretty sure he rolled his eyes. Then he picked my glass up and smelled it for himself, as if to say ""I'll be the judge of that"". My husband and I go to many wine classes and tastings. We enjoy learning about wines and their nuances. But I have never been embarassed to ask questions about the wines I'm ordering and I definitely was here.  Additionally, I didn't feel that the wine list was anything to write home about. It had some interesting selections, and I really did enjoy the wine I had, but it's not as inclusive as I would expect a dedicated wine bar to be.

And they pretty much did everything right. The postage stamp pasta dish with braised cheek was rich and hearty, My hangar steak was perfectly prepared and just a nice balanced dish. Nice little wine list and some interesting choices by the glass al very reasonably priced. Only food issue I had was with the trout...to me trout doesn't need much saucing, its not a thick enough fish to load up with a sauce...and I think is best simply buttered and a bit of lemon. The Rushing Rivers trout they were doing had a very nice sauce, great flavors, it just made the trout a delivery mechanism for the sauce...as good as the sauce may have been. Anyway, small detail.

First, some really delicious, and inventive dishes are being served.  Last night's hanger steak with Epoisses cheese sauce, bacon, mint and tart apple?  Fantastic!  So good it got me yelping again!  Salads and small plates have been equally impressive.   The staff is really pleasant.  Friendly, calm, normal.  They match the wonderful decor in a way!  Love that.  On weekends this is a real feat given how busy it gets. They offer older wine vintages on special, which really sets telegraph apart as a more serious wine spot too.  And I love their stemware. I give them credit for sticking to their guns and focusing on European wines... as you'd expect, lots of more acidic, old world styles.  And of course, you'll find your hip ""off the beaten path"" wines like chinon's, vouvrays, morgons, etc.  Nothing wrong with that! Telegraph falls just short of 5 stars for me for a couple little reasons.  First, twice on busy nights dishes from their fryer have been disturbingly greasy, like food at a carnival.  Both were obviously misses for me, but minor overall. Finally, as hard as I try, I just don't love their wine list as much as I'd like to.  I've now typed and retyped 10 paragraphs trying to explain why... it's too much work to explain without making it a bigger deal that it deserves and sounding like a douche.  I'll just leave it as a four star list for me, which is very good!  It's certainly not for everyone though, but that's a good thing.

2012-02-13,5.0,"Telegraph just gets the details right. Clean, subdued, minimalist decor, painstakingly chosen wines severed in beautiful crystal stemware, savory gastropubish food, and service that rivals a 5-star hotel...I think I've found my new weekend destination in Logan Square! Lucky for us we stopped in at Telegraph around 7pm after the Feb '12 Yelp Elite event at Roka Akor (props to the Chicago Yelp Squad and Johnny T. for yet another amazing event) looking for a good glass of wine and a place to simply chill at the bar. After a conversing with our bartender, I settled on a glass of the Domaine Karydas red, which I must admit went against my best judgement because it was a Greek red wine (this does not need to be explained) and second, it was described as have bordeaux-esque character, something that seems impossible for any region outside of France and Napa Valley. I think she could tell I was a bit skeptical, so our bartender poured me a taste of the Karydas and a Spanish red, and I was blown away by the Domaine Karydas. It was medium bodied, with soft, jammy edges, lush texture, a bit of raspberry and a dry tannic finish. It didn't have the bold, heavier body and firm tannins  that a good Bordeaux displays, but man that was a delicious glass of wine, and seemingly a bargain at $10 a glass. In fact, it wasn't just the glass that I liked about it all, but the fact that Telegraph introduced me to a spectacular wine that I would have never found otherwise...a wine that defied conventions and my assumptions about wine. After a glass, we decided to stay for dinner and ordered both specials that night. A lamb burger topped with whipped feta served on a brioche bun and a salt cod and pea spaghetti. Both dishes were executed perfectly and had just the right amount of attitude without going too far in one direction where the dish became unbalanced. What stood out about the lamb burger was the bun...a slightly dry and flaky biscuit-like texture that complimented the leanness of the lamb and the creamy whipped feta. I must say that I enjoyed this burger more than some of the heavily touted burgers at Kuma's, which I admit is heresy to say in Chicago. The spaghetti was just a comfort food dish with soft white wine sauce and sauteed cod, it seemed like it was more of a homemade ""mama's special Monday night dish"" than a modern American gastropub experiment. I think that's what characterizes Telegraph's style...they seem to stay more true to the intentions of the dish rather than throw as much of ""hip"" ingredients like kale, and pork belly, and foie gras, and bourbon, and whatever as they can muster. Overall our meal at Telegraph was superb and our bartender was absolutely delightful, she was very knowledgeable about wines and her descriptions were spot-on.  In fact we originally intended to just have a glass or two before dinner, but enjoyed our time so much, we ended up staying for dinner. Telegraph has gotten all the details right and should be on the top of the list of wine bars/restaurants to try for any fan of Longman & Eagle, The Bristol, Girl & The Goat and the like.",0.9977,0.839,0.148,0.013,0.495004995004995

Long story short, visited here on Friday with my wife and everything was right on.  Food was A caliber.  My wife's a well known chef and dreamed about this food the following night...lol.   Small menu, but everything listed is quality and for serious tasters.   Wine list was great.  Not a lot of Nebbiolo in this city so seeing this on the menu was a delight.  The Ferrando was outstanding.   The ambiance of this place screams nice date scene.   Very cozy, nice views, color patterns and old world lanterns were amazing.  Also, the portion size was made for humans.  A lot of places here have huge animal size plates so I was very pleased to see that I wouldn't walk out of here overstuffed.   Only thing that prevents a 5 star here is my personal preference for a larger menu.  Rootstock has a similar vibe and I love that place as well, but I'd love these guys to add a duck or lamb option.  Meats and cheeses feel ripe for starters as well.

2011-12-23,5.0,"I love wine, and have been known to buy a lot of it and drink it. I do not keep a wine cellar and unlike my friend in NYC who is a banker, I do not invest in wine. I always try to follow the mandate that wine is for making a party of life, making a bacchanalia out of meetings with friends.  We had the 2010 cabanon, sauvignon blanc, oltrepo pavese, italy which the whole table loved. I am a fan of ordering two bottles (white first, then red, and perhaps a third sweet wine or grappa after dinner). I tend toward a sauvignon blanc with the opening courses and salad before moving to red with the main course. I am not fixated on the traditional pairings, but tend to follow them.  We then shifted to a Spanish red suggested by our server which was good, but did not pack too much of a flavor punch so we switched to the 2008 sesti, 'monteleccio' sangiovese, montalcino, italy and were very happy with this wine. In this place, I might even say that this would be my go-to wine. There once was a time when I had an expense account and I would have gone for the 2009 philippe pacalet, gevrey-chambertin, burgundy, france which is a personal favorite, but these are lean times in the city. Gosh, I had to say that my friends had to kick me under the table when I started on about Gevrey-Chambertin, helicopter rides, and dinners in New York and Princeton. But, alas, what we had was perfect.  Ok, enough of this wine crack.  This place is in a great location in the heart of Logan Square. In fact it is on and overlooks the  Illinois Centennial Monument at Milwaukee and Kedzie. I always wanted this space to be something like Telegraph.  You walk in and see a nice upscale wine/bar with nice dark colors and good muted lighting. We had a large table so they put us in the section on the other side of the wall which was perfect. We were a rowdy crowd of about 9 people and we had a nice mix of first courses, and main courses - everything from oysters on the half shell to creamed black kale tartine, roasted cauliflower gratin (favorite!). I was not so blown away by the berkshire pork loin tartine, but otherwise all the starters were great. For main courses we seemed to have a consensus that the half chicken and the rabbit stew were the biggest hits.  We had a smash, and since my friends and I are like wild animals after pre-dinner drinks and bottles of wine everyone around us - even the couples trying to have a nice upscale date next to a party of maniacs - was friendly and only looked a bit concerned when a friend knocked her chair down. When talking I smashed a wine glass and my friend asked the server to take a picture of it, and she actually was being mean to him, but he just laughed and was very kind.  Our servers were great and were on the ball all night. We were so happy they were nice to us as the wine flowed and the Bacchanalian revelry overpowered a few at the table! Yes we were that table! But, why not? Isn't this the city of big shoulders? Are we not the vulgar city that spawned Bellow's and Algren's best novels? We are, and why not own it?  When it was all said and done we had an amazing party and it was all very affordable thanks to my skipping the Chambertin.  Now, if we had ordered that class of wine or if they had it, a Luigi Einaudi Barolo ( a friend's family estate) we would have behaved ourselves.  We drank the wine, and had a good time, and I would like to thank the servers and staff for being nice to a table full of crazies.  Wonderful time.    I love Chicago. And.

Around the corner from the highly-acclaimed Longman & Eagle, Telegraph totally stands on its own merit.  completely happy with our experience! went on a rainy fall-transitioning-to-winter night.  we had reservations for 630 on a sat night and was seated immediately.  we sat in the bar side of the restaurant, the decor was rustic, made us all feel homey. highlights: surprisingly, for a wine bar, the food was AWESOME. only downfall for one of our friends was everything had nuts in it and he's highly allergic, but i suppose that's his problem. just trying to keep him alive, that's all. - best: foie gras. buttery, straight up foie on toast- the best way to eat it.  also a slathering of duck confit.  the toast was buttery and delicious!  AMAZING DISH! - just as good: rabbit, tree nut bolonase pasta.  hand made pasta, savory, with a herbaceous flavor - flank steak with crawfish: cooked perfectly and great flavor wine/beer choices were interesting, varied.   can't go wrong with this place.  great addition to the neighborhood.",0.997,0.639,0.324,0.036,0.7152631578947369

2011-11-11,4.0,"I went on a thursday night with a reservation for a party of 5. Had drinks at the bar first while waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. The drinks were quite good and reasonably priced but I did think that the glass they served prosecco in was not adequate as it was close to a martini glass (the opposite of a flute) and the bubbles did not last long at all. For appetizers we went with the roasted beets and the olive salad. The beet salad was good but there weren't a lot of beets in it and they were all at the bottom. I also thought that the size of the pieces of lettuce were ridiculous as I ended up having to cut them down myself. Very tasty though. The olive salad was a bowl of olives with a tiny bit of cheese, salami, and pickles peppers in it but it was predominantly olives. It also came with a side of bread that I can only equate to texas toast but much higher quality. (The dishes were 10 and 6 dollars respectively) For the main course we ordered two of the vermillion rock fish, two of the grilled amish chicken, and one angel hair pasta. (I had the pasta) I did not try the rock fish but the portion seemed pretty small. The chicken on the other hand was a large portion size and quite delicious. (Both were priced at $19) My angle hair pasta was delicious and included veal heart (which turned out great)($17). All in all the food was delicious but the portion sizes were kind of hit or miss. To me the chicken was well worth the money where as the rockfish was either a tiny fish or it was half of a fillet, both for the same price.",0.9865,0.845,0.125,0.03,0.5419610855094726

The dessert of choice for me was the panna cotta which was really good as well.  Of course I went with friends and ate off their plates as well.  The beet salad was pretty good, as was the olive platter.  The hangar steak was absolutely wonderful, I think next time I go, I will have a very hard time deciding between this and the Amish chicken and might just have to get myself 2 entrees :-P  The angel hair pasta was ok, but my friend got it without the veal heart so I'm not really sure what the full effect was supposed to be.  As far as the wine is concerned, I had the Ferrando which I loved and had several glasses of.  My friends had a few things from the etc section which I wasn't a fan of.  Our waiter was slightly pushy and annoying, but overall, I had a great experience here and will be back!",0.9972,0.702,0.257,0.042,0.6041538658474144

We ordered martinis, which were terrific, although I would've like if they had blue-cheese olives. No big deal though, I can survive.  I order the foie gras as an appetizer for the table, which was excellent. I really enjoyed the texture and the sweet after-taste. I then ordered my entree(Grilled Octopus), which was extremely underwhelming. The dish sounded amazing, but when it came, it was a few pieces of frisee and a couple clumps of tasteless octopus. It was about enough food to satisfy a hamster. I was especially irritated that it cost $16 and my friends were given dishes that cost about the same and were substantially larger.  We complained to the waiter (Matty) about the portion sizing, hoping he could come up with some way to satisfy us. However, we were met with the usual ""hipster arrogance"" and were told that the dishes have different portions and are priced accordingly. Unfortunately for Matty, we're not idiots and know what an entree should look like. We would have at least liked to have been offered something on the house/discounted/free side etc!

My husband, who has a gluten allergy, has never had trouble finding anything to eat at Longman and Eagle, Purple Pig, Bristol, Gilt Bar, Girl and the Goat, or any other Chicago wine bar/gastropub establishment. Honestly, I just thought it was really weird when the waitress said that the kitchen couldn't accommodate. Last-- the foie gras toast was horribly burnt-- Ridiculously black toast.

I could be in a dress or in jeans and not feel out of place. I'm under the impression the menu changes every few weeks, as ours was dated Oct.6.. We started with this peach salad with black eyed peas that made us exceptionally excited for the main course.. We each got ocean trout, which I don't know if I have ever had done so damn well. I mean, holy shit. Lick the plate, indeed. Served on top of baby potatoes and Brussels sprouts, I'm inclined to return so I can eat it again before it disappears. We split the panna cotta for dessert which, again, blew our tiny taste-bud minds.. holy crap. We didn't drink much. But the wine list (of course) was extensive and beautiful, and the descriptions were clever and carefully crafted. Actually describing what you would be tasting..

Get a table by the window for a nice view of the square.  I learned that wine, whether white, red, or sparkling, should usually be served at around 56 degrees. I was drinking an Italian red and it was delicious served slightly cooler than room temperature, as I'd always been told was proper. My boyfriend drank the single barrel rye and loved it. He said it tasted like fall. The nectarine and pine nut salad that came with the cheeses was to die for. But the best part was the tampered honey that we were told to drizzle over the blue cheese. Seriously, the best bite I've had in a long time. And the coolest part is, the owner just picked up the honey from a roadside stand in Michigan, according to our server. The fresh flavors of locally sourced ingredients was so apparent. And all we had was the cheese plate!

Started with the whitefish and corn tartine which was big enough for 2 to share and quite tasty; great melded flavors and texture.  Main courses were the steelhead and monk fish, both excellent.  Portions are decent in size, wonderful flavors, fresh ingredients, creative and well-prepared.  Dessert was the only disappointment.  Should have risked the corn panna cotta but instead went with the chocolate torte.  Ordinary and reminded both of us of the Sara Lee iced brownies we used to eat as kids, and that is not a complement. Service was a bit too leisurely, especially considering the lack of a crowd.  Very interesting and unusual wine choices and nice touch that they have the option to share a half carafe of several wines that only come in magnums.  After dinner we wandered up to Longman & Eagle which was packed to overflowing.  Have dined there and liked it very much but don't understand why the foodie herd is not down the block at Telegraph.",0.9917,0.775,0.187,0.038,0.5889236111111111

My husband is not a fan and was hesitant, but it was SO delicious that he helped himself to seconds, possibly thirds! I could've eaten an entire vat of that cauliflower, it was so good! It actually outshone the olive salad that my husband got and I dig a good olive salad.  At this point, I was already starting to get full, but we soldiered on to the entrees. I had the pan roasted powell river steel head with brussels and potatoes, both sliced thinly, garnished with citrus. It was EXCELLENT. My husband had the flatiron steak with cabbage slaw, also fantastic. I think I read a review in which someone was underwhelmed by the steak, but it truly was delicious-very tender, and the slaw had a nice tang to it.

We were given a 25-30 minute wait time, so we gave the host my mobile number and walked to the square to enjoy some live music.  We ambled on back to Telegraph about 25 minutes later and were told there was still one party ahead of us, but that we were next and many tables were on their final course. Fine. The next 20 minutes were spent trying to ignore a perfectly empty table for two right in front of us as the host seated no one and servers brought out app plates and utensils.  Finally, the host walked up to a couple who had been seated at the bar THE WHOLE TIME and told them she could seat them now and lead them to the empty table.

I would happily sit at the bar here, have a glass of wine and relax. Being a wine bar with good pedigree (same owners as Webster Wine Bar) there are of course some delicious options, and the list of affordable wines by the glass is refreshing. The bartender was very helpful in making a selection. The hostess was also very nice and I was surprised when she told my party of 6 it would only be a 15 minute wait for a prime real estate table in front of the window (bonus!) The menu has some really nice local produce and offers some more inventive items. I loved my salad with peaches, endive, black eyed peas, green beans and tomatillo vinagrette - it was refreshing, had a lot of texture and had me searching for any remaining morsel. I'd asked the waitress what she'd recommended (usually a good idea) and she said without a doubt the flatiron steak. With all the other tasty items on the menu, I would probably not recommend the steak as there is nothing particularly interesting about the dish in comparison to bites I sampled from friends (the buccatini pasta with clams was bright and delicious). Service. Ugh. Everyone had seemed oh so friendly - the hostess, the bartender, the busser...and then there was our waitress. You know when someone right off the bat decides they're not going to like you? That's pretty much what happened with our server. She got flustered that some of the party didn't like their cider drinks (too much like vinegar) and she basically shut down on service 101. She asked if 6 of us would be sharing one order of pasta (huh?) before going around the entire table for our orders and then forgot to put in my steak order. All the entrees came out piece meal instead of coming out together or just minutes apart. By the time I got my entree some of the people at the table were already done eating. The steak was kindly comped, but our server was over and out.  I will probably go back, but I think I'd come back again but with a much smaller group.",0.977,0.859,0.112,0.029,0.5628103378103377

The olive salad with salumi was a giant bowl of olives with a few slivers of meat, the pasta with clams and sausage had exactly 3 clams and 3 pieces of sausage. Based on the reviews at my table of the other entres, I think that was the best thing on the menu.  The other annoyance was that they kept running out of things. The sturgeon was off the menu by the time we ordered and we were told that we got the last flank steak. Then for dessert the pane cota was gone so we were forced to order the only other sweet dessert option on the menu, which was a chocolate cake with nectarines. The fruit tasted like canned peaches and the cake was dry. With such a limited menu to begin with, you really can't start running out of things at 8 on a Saturday night.

I knew going in there that I wanted a bottle of the Movia Lunar.  We had had it in Las Vegas a few years ago at a Mario Batali restaurant at the Venetian.  Ever since then, the frustrations have only mounted as I've tried to find that wine in Chicago.  I have ordered it as a gift for my aunts in the interim, and one of them said it was the best white wine she'd ever had.  I was not going to be denied a bottle of this wine, not on my birthday, that's for sure.  It was the kind of wine that gets better with every sip.  I've had a lot of wines that get tired by the last sip, mind you.  And it paired so well with the dishes we had.  The wine really carried the night, to say the least. Oh, the food, you ask.  We started off with the pork loin tartine, which was incredible, and a perfect match with the wine.  That was followed up by the peach salad.  We then split the bucatini pasta and the Amish chicken entrees.  Again, great matches with the wine.  The sausage in the pasta dish and the honeycomb vinaigrette glaze on the chicken especially, it just didn't get any better. After all that food and that incredible bottle of wine, it was time for dessert.  I knew that I wanted a glass of the Terrantez madeira.  I have had the main four noble grapes of Madeira before, and had always wanted to try Terrantez, one of the nearly forgotten grapes of Madeira after the phylloxera epidemic in the late 1800s.  I've heard people rave about this grape.  Honestly, it probably wasn't meant to pair with the desserts offered at Telegraph, but that should not deter anybody from ordering a glass.  It stands by itself quite well, thank you. Let's not forget the desserts themselves.  The corn panna cotta dish was superb.  The spicy bacon streusel bits carried the dish very well.  The cheese platter, wow.  I don't know what the three cheeses of the night were, but I know that they were from cow, sheep, and goat, respectively.  There were a few other accoutrements on the platter to add to the cheeses themselves.  Great presentation, and we wouldn't let them take the plate away until it was completely picked clean. Yes, this is a wine bar, but the food is a real reason to come here even if you don't care about wine.  And if you do care about wine, and I certainly do, you will be happy to know that this place cares about wine more than any other place you've been.  I think there was a real purpose behind every selection on that list.  I've always wished I could find places that carried a fascinating and comprehensive list that doesn't seek to gouge the customer first and foremost, and I finally found it.  It will be fun to go back to Telegraph again and do something completely different.",0.9973,0.821,0.154,0.025,0.5832063492063493

The food was okay, but not great.  We had the tomato tartine, which was essentially sliced tomatoes on toasted sourdough.  The grilled vegetables was corn and green beans on sourdough, which was not very exciting.  The sturgeon was served with a puttanesca-like sauce with pickled green beans and sliced oranges...I could have used some more instruction as the citrus element really threw me.  The cheese plate was good, served once again with sourdough bread.  The cheese itself was fine, but they served an herb infused honey on the plate that was spectacular.  Definitely the highlight of the evening.

As for the rest of the food... I didn't try everything our table ordered, but my friend was gushing about the grilled cucumber salad and my chicken was delicious- the fried lemon slices were a unique touch and I could've eaten the fruit glaze with a spoon.  Portion size was not an issue with anything we ordered.  It's a shame we didn't leave room for dessert.  I can't wait to spend the cooler months here cozied up with another fun glass of wine, a cheese plate and a friend.",0.995,0.782,0.188,0.03,0.5004768668831168

Gone are the days in college where you could make up a sad but college-y excuse about finishing a bottle alone (or sort of alone).

2011-08-01,4.0,"Temptation abounds on both the wine list and the food menu.  I liked the interior, warm dim lighting, a large wood bar which looked very inviting and a knowledgeable staff that welcomes questions.  And what we liked most, a relaxed, no rush atmosphere, I would feel very comfortable stopping in for a glass or 2 of wine and cheese plate.  We arrived hungry for an early Sunday dinner, about 6:30; the bar was the hub activity.  Here's my only problem, if you do go hungry and dine out as often as we do, be prepared for the bill. We each had 2 glasses of wine, 2 first courses and 2 second courses, the bill with tax and tip came to $150.   For my main course I had the grilled lamb saddle with oysters and cherries, the combination was amazing but I question the value of this plate at just shy of $30 and the same ratio applies to very tasty grilled  1/2 chicken with rapini at $17.  This is a wine bar and I would like to see more inventive and interesting dishes but at a lower price point.   My recommendation - get your ass over there, try some very interesting wines by the glass and as I said the menu is tempting and worth a try.  We will be back, but I can't hit this place up as often as I'd like on an empty stomach.",0.9267,0.79,0.14,0.07,0.5168095238095237
2011-07-31,3.0,"I want to love Telegraph, I really do.  I am SUPER excited to have a wine bar in the 'hood, and I'd peeked in the space as they were finishing it up and I love the look. But I went.  And I wasn't thrilled.  Mind you, I didn't dislike it, and I will absolutely give it another chance.  But things could have been better. First thing, it was hot in there.  I don't mean kinda warm and crowded - in fact, the place was half empty when I arrived.  But it was HOT.  I mean, everyone who sat down starting fanning themselves with their menus.  I thought maybe I'd cool off, but I was still perspiring when I left close to two hours later.  Now, I get that Chicago's been surface-of-the-sun-like the past few days, but I shouldn't sweat through my meal.  Please, look in to the a/c situation. Also, while the tables look super cool, they have legs that sit between yours (as opposed to being a pedestal or you having your legs between the tables legs).  Sounds like a silly complaint, right?  Try maneuvering around them - I noticed a number of people having some issues with it.  I can imagine trying to wear a skirt there. As for the food and drink - the food was quite tasty, and pretty good size portions.  My friend and I split a tartine (the one with a bean spread and fried squash blossoms), an entree, and a dessert.  The tartine knocked it out of the park, and our steak and fries were solid.  The menu has only two desserts - cheese plate and a pound cake/ice cream thing.  We did the pound cake and it was ok - it was super super heavy though. I very much liked the wines that I tasted, but I was pretty startled by the prices.  The bulk of the wines were $50+, and that's a lot for the Square (and me personally).  I get that they're trying to find smaller, more niche/less known wines and it's a cool concept, but that's a shock to the wallet. Like I said, I am sure I'll be back, though I'll wait until it's under 90 degrees outside - not taking a chance on sweating through another meal, sorry!",0.9969,0.755,0.21,0.035,0.5428924162257497

2011-07-31,2.0,"At first glance, this spot is great!  Great atmosphere, interesting lighting, two rooms with unique bars.  The service was excellent, really friendly and knowledgeable the bathrooms were nice as well.  Love at first sight!....then we got to know each other...  First off the beer pours and wine pours are relatively small.  They try to conceal this with their funky glassware, but  no, you  don't get a lot for your money. This goes for the food as well, the value proposition compared to restaurants of the caliber that they are trying to be is just off.   On to food....sigh.  I was really excited for the food upon reading the Yelp reviews, as well as all of the write-ups that Telegraph has  recently received.  Upon 1st inspection of the menu  I thought to myself  ""what am I going to eat...nothing jumped off the page"".  So, we decided to try one item from each section the menu.  Here goes: - Ham tartine...S.A.L.T. was all I could taste.  I'm not sure if it was just the saltiest ham ever (looked suspiciously like Jewel deli ham) or if it was salty ham that was then salted, but this was really not palatable.  If I wasn't starving, it wouldn't have been eaten.  It may be the saltiest dish I've ever eaten and it was overwhemlmingly...bad. - Salmon crostini (not sure of the actual name of this one).  Sigh - I love smoked salmon.  This one had absolutely no flavor.  Really...no flavor. - Lamb saddle - now, I don't really know my meat cuts, so I have no idea what this is really.  However, this dish got the best quote of the evening... ""I've never had a piece of meat that was cooked so rare and was so tough at the same time"".  Seriously...really tough (maybe it's the cut, who knows).  This dish was paired with cherries and oysters which I thought seemed odd upon ordering, and this was confirmed upon eating. - Ok, on to the cheese. How can you mess up a cheese plate? Seriously...  There were three cheeses (goat, cow, sheep), honey, toast and a fig preserve.  Oh my, we couldn't even finish it.  So, none of the cheese really had any flavor (I really rarely ever met a cheese that I didn't like).  The cow's cheese was the best, but that's not saying all that much.  The fig spread had peppers in it.  An odd choice in my opinion.  Even without these, the flavor was strange.  My largest complaint with this one, however, was the toast.  Yes, the TOAST?  It was terrible...I love bread - all bread, but this I couldn't even eat!  It had an odd flavor, was too salty and half burned. The great atmosphere and service won't bring me back back to eat.  I would come back for the bar, but definitely not for food!",0.9888,0.76,0.149,0.091,0.46472222222222226
2011-07-27,4.0,"I went here last night after all the buzz I've been hearing on Daily Candy and PopSugar. I met up with a friend at around 9:30 and it was pleasantly low key, dimly lit, and wasn't crowded at all. We ordered the sparkling red wine: quacquarini,  vernaccia nera secco, Serrapetrona, Italy for $11/glass. It was ""a  unique, triple fermented dry red sparkling, an extraordinary red  meat pair."" Although I didn't have any meat with it, it was a very good, full bodied sparkling red wine. Always a nice treat. I then ordered the 2009 damien coquelet, gamay, chiroubles from Beaujolais,  France for $9/glass. It was described as a rich, tannic, kinda barnyardy wine. While barnyardy doesn't sound terribly appetizing, it was actually delicious. Would have paired very nicely with food, which I fully intend to try the next time. Service was very attentive. It was a pleasant evening and I love the new wood smell in the place! Feels very rustic and homey.",0.9904,0.753,0.235,0.012,0.5333799533799535
2011-07-27,5.0,"I've been twice in the past 4 days. Easy location, dimly lit which lends itself to a sexy vibe. I love the wood bar. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it feels good. Oh, and the chairs are really comfortable, which makes it easy to sit at said bar for hours and work through a large part of the wines by the glass.  The wine list has a unique selection of lesser known varieties. So far I've tried every white by the glass and was not disappointed. Wines are fairly priced and the food...order the toasted cake. It was perfect (topped with a raspberry-rose-lemon ice cream, favorite part). The olive salad and sweetbread pasta were also my favorites. I love that the food was not an afterthought to the concept.  Definitely make a point to go to Telegraph. Hopefully Dylan is behind the bar; I remembered him from Webster's.

2011-07-18,5.0,"Until recently I thought Telegraph was the way old timers texted each other. Imagine my astonishment when I received a text from an older chum suggesting this place.   I responded with an ""S.O.S"" because I was in desparate need of an attitude adjustment. Until they create a time release alcohol capsule, I suppose wine suffices. Telegraph is owned by the Webster's Wine Bar proprietors. So I already suspected I'd like it. As soon as we arrived I couldn't help being impressed with how dim, sleek, and minimalistic the atmosphere was. It's quite a contrast to Webster's, but not in a bad way. They're both attractive. I still like them both, they're just differently cute. As for the dranks. There's a much smaller wine list than Webster's (around thirteen or so) and it focuses heavily on old world, unique wines. We ordered a bottle of the Wimmer Czerny Sparkling Pinot Noir. This was an impulsive choice since we've never had sparkling Pinot Noir. I must say it was good, and I normally dislike red wine. Besides the wine, there's beer and liquors available. But. . . Even if you aren't there for that, the food is quite good. How could it not be with former Avec sous chef John Anderes at the helm? We ordered: Green olive salad with salumi toscano, grilled papadew peppers, and cheese curd. Fantastic. It tasted great with red wine. Black grilled lamb saddle with dune shadows oysters, cherries, pumpernickel, and ginger. Overwhelmed!!  I love the marriage of the sweet with the savory and the lamb and oysters were a great match (I guess Paula Abdul and Mc Skat Kat are RIGHT! Opposites DO attract). Grilled Sirloin Steak with aus jus, kale pesto, and potatoes. Whelmed.  It was satisfactory. But almost every other item on the menu was much more inventive and exciting.

2011-07-12,4.0,"I'm optimistic.  Since moving to the neighborhood just a year ago, things have really continued on the upswing.  The hipsters may be dismayed, but gentrification is slowly creeping up Milwaukee Ave.  I'm really happy to see a wine bar go in.  Yes, we had Ciao, but it never occurred to me to utilize it as such, although I do stop in from time to time.  I love Azucar, but sometimes the food leaves something to be desired.  (Ummhhh, little note to Azucar, start buying your bread from La Boulangerie instead of Turano.) But, I digress .  .  . Longman & Eagle, has awesome food but specializes in bourbons and beer.  And is so overcrowded.   Welcome to Telegraph!  I went and had a great bottle of Bourgogne and two appetizers, the ham tartine and the cured salmon.  Both were very good.  A little heavy on the bread on both, but toppings were delicious and I very much appreciated the thoughtful addition of salmon roe to the cured salmon.  Service was good, a little hovering but understandable for opening night when I went.   I do have a little note of advice about that chef's table in the back room.  I know that chefs, especially opening chefs having romantic notions of well-heeled dinner parties with 6-10 courses, each loving crafted and described.  But this is Logan Square.  Unless that table is booked, please open it up and make it an extended bar.  It's going to happen sooner rather than later anyway.  Also, put some bar stools by the back bar, yeah, it might get a little tight for service but when you come in for just a drink and the bar is full, you kind of feel stupid sitting at a table and just ordering wine & apps.",0.9971,0.749,0.224,0.028,0.5671904761904761
2011-07-12,4.0,"Wine bars. What are they? How do they differ from just another restaurant with a notable wine list?  Well, Telegraph may be the answer to this question.   With the owners coming from Webster's wine bar and Bluebird, a clear perception was definitely in mind for this rustic Logan Square addition. Straying away from it's siblings' global and biodynamic wine menus, Telegraph focuses on smaller European wineries who still hold up to their heirloom traditions.  When glasses are averaging in at $9, there shouldn't be any issues when ordering 2 or 6 glasses during the course of your stay. Remember, these wines are all very unique, now is not the time for reservation.  Oh yeah, and they don't take them! Prepare your palate for the light, fresh sardine tartine by starting with the dry sparkling Wimmer-czerny blanc de Noirs. Then onto the first course with Guy bossard's muscadet and perfectly prepared sweetbreads with citrusy ""mouse tail"" pasta.  This is when you come to realize... that's right, chef Anderes did come from Avec. Bring on the next course of Lamb saddle then the cheese plate, and might as well toss in the Gamay and aszu 6 putonyos from Hungary.  If there is one pairing you appreciate the most out of this meal, to your surprise, it's the cheese and aszu 6.  Both the cheeses and wine contained deep earthy notes, ensuring you that this wasn't just picked up at the local grocer and tossed onto a board. The beer and liquor list should also be recognized.  Craft imports from Belgium and England, and hand selected liquors completes this short and thoughtful list.

My meal there tonight tells me they're doing things right. The wine list has over 20 old world wines by the glass, all interesting and reasonably priced, but I suppose you'd expect that with the Webster Wine Bar heritage.  I tried 5-6 of them and was amazed at the variety and uniqueness.  The bottles available were more of the same, only better, and a few available in large formats. As good as the wine is, the star is the food.  The entrées were mostly in the teens, with 1-2 over $20, and my personal favorite was a sweetbread starter with rhubarb, along with a salmon crudo.  There were some things that were exceptionally inventive, like a grilled lamb with oysters, bacon and cherries.  Eat at the bar (it's long), tables, or I think the best place is probably one community table.  Amazing.
