2012-10-14,1.0,"We made a reservation on line and when we got to the restaurant the maitre de had no record of it.  Despite pulling it up on my phone and showing it to him he said he couldn't accommodate us.  We asked if we could sit at the bar and got two seats there.  We then made the mistake of telling him we had a Groupon and then were told he wouldn't honor it because we didn't make the reservation by phone.  He was loud, obnoxious, rude and incredibly dismissive.   We had two glasses of wine -- both were awful -- exposed to too much air and were cheap tasting despite the $9 price tag.  We had the sausage appetizer, one of their signature dishes, and it was greasy and heavy.   The service was mediocre and a 20% tip was automatically added to our tab without our permission.",-0.9385,0.887,0.0,0.113,0.7125
