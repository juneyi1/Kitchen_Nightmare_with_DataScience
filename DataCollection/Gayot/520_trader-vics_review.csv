2007-01-29,5.0,"I cannot believe Trader Vics closed! When I attend conferences in the Palmer House I ALWAYS dined at Trader Vics.  They started serving free hors doerves(sp) and the food was really great.  I met my out of town best friend here and we had a fantastic dinner! However, the location may have been less than ideal. It was located in the lower level of the Palmer House and it was not that easy to locate. I hope Trader Vics will re-open in a more accessible location.",0.9709,0.701,0.253,0.046,0.5625

Like Kona Kai before it, the Chicago Trader Vic's will sadly be closing its doors as of the New Year. Now there are talks that the owners of Harry Carry's restaurant will reopen Vic's in another location in 2007, but nothing is guaranteed.  As they say in the islands, ""hang loose and suck 'em up."" Hit this place during Happy Hour on a weeknight for the best drink specials and gorge on the complimentary appetizer bar. Lord knows, the food on the menu is outrageously priced and is anything, but authentic. Stick to the drinks and take the train home. Thanks for all the great memories down in the Palmer House basement!",0.9568,0.751,0.173,0.076,0.5566109816109815
2005-11-15,4.0,Immortalized in song by Warren Zevon and loved by so many Chicagoans and tourists. This place is certainly unique. It's been around almost 50 yrs. Going inside is like visiting a different world with it's tiki stuff all over. You gotta get their mai-tai(s).,0.8316,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.725

2005-09-15,4.0,"A hidden little alcove in the loop where you can hide from the everyday madness. This is an original, and it feels like nothing has changed for 40 years, but that's a good thing in this case. Fantastic drinks that are huge and dangerous. Good food too. The atmospere is one-of-a-kind-straight out of the South Pacific.",0.91,0.63,0.265,0.104,0.675925925925926
2005-09-10,4.0,"Trader Vic's isn't just any tiki bar. It's one of the originals, dating back 70 years. This particular one opened in 1957. While it lacks the fire-dancing or vivid kitsch decor that the tiki place by the airport used to have, the food is decent. It caters too much to bland tourist tastes and not enough to actual Polynesian cuisine, but the Calcutta Curries make up for it -- a fabulous blend of potatoes, onions, cucumbers, apples, pimentos, carrots, madras curry and meat or seafood, you get a tray of condiments to choose from, including sunflower seeds, raisans, banana, coconut and chutney.  I just add them all -- yummy. $5 drink specials Tue-Sat, including Polynesian Punch, Mauie Zombies, and of course, the Vic-invented Mai Tai.",0.8807,0.929,0.071,0.0,0.5229166666666667
