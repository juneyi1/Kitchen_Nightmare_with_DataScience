2016-12-06,3.0,"I am sad to have to drop a star off of my last review but I feel it's necessary after my visit here Saturday night. I have come to love this place and always make sure to dine here when in Chicago.  I had made reservations ahead of time having remembered long lines, and seeing that it was Saturday I thought it would be a good idea. They called to confirm and I thought we were all set. Upon arriving we had about a 10 minute wait, which is understandable, these things happen. I was disappointed with the reception received from the hostess, very cool and not too inviting. She hurried off after telling us we would need to wait (she didn't specify how long) and when she came back a few short minutes later she asked me my name again.  Didn't make me feel valued as a customer. Whatever, she was having a bad day. We were seated in the lounge area, next to a large noisy party. Definitely not the same atmosphere I remembered on previous trips when we had been seated in the main dining area. The curious thing about all this is the fact that the place really wasn't busy considering it was a Saturday night.  It still gets 3 stars because of the quality of the food. Everything is so fresh tasting. The salads are great and are a perfect segway into a delicious pizza or pasta. This night we chose one of the white pizzas.... Wild mushroom and smoked mozzarella.  I love mushrooms and was very disheartened to find there was only 1-2 per slice. When you advertise the pizza as being a wild mushroom pizza it sounds as if there might be more than one variety and for a place with this caliber of food you would expect more.  This is the reason I dropped a star. The hostess was much friendlier on our way out and when she asked how everything was I was honest and mentioned the mushroom debacle. She looked genuinely surprised and told me to mention that the next time I dined there.  That's still up in the air, with all the great places to eat in Chicago I'm not positive there will be a next time.",0.9946,0.77,0.17,0.06,0.4864243766569347

I made eye contact w/our server 5x, but he didn't get a hint to come take our order until my friend said something.  In terms of the food, I would say Osteria La Madia gets 4.5 stars. I had the Frutti di Mare pasta, which was delicious, but the thin-crust prosciutto pizza we ordered wasn't anything phenomenal. The bottom of the pizza was a bit soft/soggy, and I was hoping it would have been more crisp. The bottle of wine we had was great. The ambiance of the restaurant is very lovely and romantic, and even a bit trendy. I particularly liked how they chose to display their wine at the front of the store, as well as how you can see the chefs making pizza (depending on where you are seated).  I asked if the server had affogato, and he said ""is that an espresso with vanilla bean gelato?"".

2016-08-07,1.0,"Let me tell you about our experience: My wife and I arrived around 815pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant looked about 70% full and they say us fairly quickly. We were a bit indecisive picking a glass of wine. The waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the wine menu and so we tried a glass and ended up ordering another. We had a few questions on the menu (it is the second time we had been to this restaurant and the menu had changed). We were informed that the ahi tuna bruschetta was like a tuna poke bruschetta. So we ordered the Ahi tuna bruschetta and 2 pizzas. Our general experience up to this point was slow, frustrating, unhelpful, and every question felt like it was being met w resistance. Literally 40 minutes later our bruschetta came out (we did not see our waitress for that entire time in between). It was not a tuna poke just 3 pieces of tuna on top of 3 crostinis. The presentation, taste, and overall time to get our food was terrible for what we ordered and incredibly slow. We asked the waitress if she had put in the pizza order yet because the appetizer had taken a while to come out. She said she had not because she was waiting for the appetizer to come out. She then proceeded to tell us about a big party that was at the restaurant who ordered a lot of food (mind you the restaurant is about 60% full at this point). Again the service unhelpful, unauthentic, and there was yet another excuse for a question we had. So we asked to see a manager. The manager came over in the tiny little corner we were in with 4 tables of people around us and asked (in a fairly loud voice) ""I understand you are upset that the service has been slow"". We proceeded to explain that the service has been slow, that we felt like every question was met w resistance, that there was just an overall lack of sincerity in our experience.  Without saying so much as I apologize, he caught us totally off guard and goes ""can you give me specific examples of questions and the types of answers you have been receiving?"" Caught a little off guard I was happy to explain the wine choice, appetizer choice, 40min in between ordering and getting our 3 pieces of tuna, and the general tone, attitude, and resistance we received from the waitress. He then said ""oh I am sorry you feel that way what is a fair way to make it up to you?"" So we just asked if we could take our pizza to go. He then again apologized and we responded with ""yes we are disappointed this has been an awful experience."" This is when shit hit the fan. The manager goes, in no exaggeration ""whoa, whoa, that is completely different than what you first told me"". Again, caught a little off guard and get increasingly frustrated and upset we told him that that was exactly what we explained to him. We are now making a scene in front of this entire part of the restaurant and the manager is still speaking loudly with no regard to the other tables around. This manager literally had an excuse for everything that was happening citing the kitchen being backed up, the restaurant being completely full, etc. So we just asked for a check for the 2 drinks and the appetizer. Mind you it is now almost 930pm and we had been there for over an hour. I have never ever experienced such an awful display of customer service in my life. The way that the waitress miscommunicated to the manager our initial complaint, the manager's lack of sincerity in talking with us, the unauthentic nature of his attitude, tone of voice, lack of willingness to help, and excuse for literally everything that we had to say, as well as making a scene in his own restaurant was infuriating and disappointing.  The manager, at this point, did not know how to handle this situation at all, tried to apologize again (little late for that) and so we asked if he could just go get the check. As he walked away the table next us grabbed him to speak w him. Their bill was incorrect and they waited over an hour for their entrees. He immediately apologized and offered to take it off their bill.  He brought us our bill for $40 for 2 drinks and the appetizer which we paid and left. I can't emphasize enough how poorly this situation was handled. It was truly one of the worst displays of customer service and experience that I have ever seen in my life.

The bread it came like, basically a naan, was good though. The tuna bruschetta was just raw tuna on baguette. The tuna was good but it wasn't really anything special. My boyfriend and I split carbonara and wild boar bolognese. The bolognese was out of this world good. The carbonara was served with two egg yolks on top, but the pasta wasn't quite hot enough to get that creamy carbonara result. I also thought there weren't enough peas or pancetta. The service was also slow and the waitress never refilled my wineglass, despite refilling my boyfriend's several times.

They had a pretty limited menu; I couldn't believe they only had 4 pasta dishes (you're an Italian restaurant right?) and if there were any specials my server didn't tell me about them. Their saving grace was their wine menu which I will say was impressive although not too many of them were available just by the glass. I went with the pea and parmesan risotto which was warm (not hot) and probably re-heated, extremely soupy and lacked any seasoning whatsoever apart from the cress on top which I didn't like at all. There wasn't even a hint of parmesan and my server never offered any to grate on top or any black pepper to grind which any decent Italian restaurant would do. I may have chosen badly from the menu with this dish but nothing on there was inspiring me and I wasn't getting any help from the server. It's clear to me why it was so easy to get in here and yet RPM even has a line to sit at the bar - in future, I'll happily wait.

They let us stay as long as we wanted - which was wonderful since we all came from different areas of the state.  My nephew organized the entire party, with the requirement that the prosecco kept flowing the entire time. The staff was very good at filling up glasses and opening new bottles. Cinnamon rolls and donut holes were present on every table before we even sat down. Appetizers were brought out as we were just about to sit down. The waiters and waitresses were friendly and courteous. Getting our food was a bit of a problem. They took our orders and then the wait began for the food.  The first table got their food in a timely fashion. Our table did not get food till after the others were done. I understand they had other patrons in the place...but really...our food should have been timed better. The pizzas were baked fresh in a huge pizza oven. These should have taken only 4 -5 minutes to cook and the ovens should be able to bake more than 1 pizza at a time. Knowing that you are having a party of about 30 people, they should have been better prepared in the kitchen. Appetizers that were pre-ordered were very tasty. The pizzas had a great crust and good toppings. The pepperoni with truffle oil was a bit too greasy. Maybe the truffle oil should have been put into the crust instead of on top of the pepperoni oil.  The pressed brioche panini was very small. If we did not have appetizers ahead of time, that sandwich would not have filled anyone up. The brioche french toast looked marvelous.

I was pleasantly surprised that a semi-fancy River North establishment provided delivery, even if it was through a 3rd party. The meal was delivered 25 minutes after it was placed, and during peak hour. That blew my mind. Now...onto the meal itself. We ordered the Cacio e Pepe (house-made spaghetti), Tagliatelle all' amatriciana, and tomato and bufala mozzarella fondue, which is more like naan and a side of tomato sauce w/ a large piece of mozzarella floating on top. You can choose between small and large for the pastas, and got small for both. There is a price difference of $6. I guess we should've ordered one large to compare the portions. Anyways, small was more like child portion, or anti-pasti size. There were tiny bits of bacon in the tagliatelle but everything else was straight up tomatoes/tomato sauce, cheese pieces, bread, and pasta. The meal that cost maybe 3 dollars to make ended up being over $54 dollars w/ tip and delivery charge. That is why i say i had the most expensive Italian meal of my life.

The grape and taleggio pizza was great, but the pork belly pizza fell flat. The dessert was sort of a joke- ""zeppole"" with gelato and Valrhona chocolate sauce is basically nothing more than a limp Krispy Kreme sliced in half and filled with crystallized ice cream and a weird spot of what I assumed was frozen chocolate sauce.  I think the part that really made this meal hard to enjoy was the fact that it was about 80 degrees out with high humidity and they had the whole front of the restaurant open with no AC on. I mean you've got a pizza oven in the back! The restaurant was absolutely sweltering. Toward the end of the meal my mom actually had to leave and walk back to my parents' place because she couldn't take the heat anymore.

2015-05-01,3.0,"Perfectly located downtown this restaurant had the most amazing looking menu - I wanted to try everything! Some of it shines and some of it was just okay.  Firstly, the ambiance and decor is great, as was the service. We were lucky enough to be seated in the small back room with only 3 tables so it was much quieter than the noisy main dining room. We each tried a local craft beer and liked them both. And we built our own cheese plate which was the star of the meal. We tied the farm cheese and the taleggio. Both were great but the farm cheese blew us away - so creamy and yummy! And it was served with the most amazing bread- made to order. It was more like a calzone with no stuffing. So good! For entrees hubby ordered the pappardelle with wild boar ragu which he said was good but not great- he wouldn't order it again. Our server told him the he should order the larger size since the smaller one was really more of a tapas size. The larger size was a good medium sized portion. Based on this I decided to order several appetizers and sides. Weirdly the portion sizes on these were MUCH larger than his pasta which felt very out of proportion but also meant I ordered WAY to much food! I got the following: - tomato and cheese fondue - this is not fondue. It was a yummy tomato bisque with a tiny amount of cheese grated on top and served with a GIANT calzone- bread. Yummy but not what I was expecting. - grilled artichokes - these were great but it was four quarters of a huge artichoke which meant a very large portion. Cooked well and served with a dipping aioli that was good but didn't add much - I ate the artichokes plain and was happy - side of heirloom carrots with honey - this looked very pretty with multicolored heirloom carrots, and the honey sauce was good but the carrots were not evenly cooked  - some were perfect some too crunchy. I ate a few and left the rest. So now, the next day, I am still stuffed. I ate about half of the food I ordered and even that was way to much.

We split lamb meatballs and burrata for appetizers...definitely recommend. For dinner, we split a triple pepperoni pizza. My boyfriend got a Brooklyn lager that he was thrilled about, and I got the Thai Tea cocktail that comes in a small bottle that I got 3 servings out of. Everything was great. Cons: The bathrooms are single-style, down a crowded hallway. If someone is in there you are stuck pressing against the wall while people come through. Although, the service took away the one star. The hostesses were great and our waiter was knowledgeable. The restaurant was completely filled, and the location of our table was kind of hidden. So, we felt like the waiter wasn't as attentive as could have been... our table was probably looked over.

My friend had a pasta dish, that was more expensive than the pizza and was absolutely not a fair portion size for the price. She said it was tasty, but we both were surprised at how small it was for $21. The worst part of the experience was the large family dining near us. I watched carefully, and as far as I can tell, not one employee reprimanded them throughout their visit for the multiple children that were running around, wrestling, and going up to other tables and talking to the guests seated there. I asked our waitress about it, and she didn't say anything because they were about to leave by that point. It's so disrespectful of families to have out of control children in this kind of setting, and it's the responsibility of the restaurant staff to stand up for other patrons. This family was loud, and the kids were way too old to behave this way. There is a big difference between a crying baby, which is very hard to deal with, and a seven year old knocking his 3 year old cousin or brother to the ground repeatedly in between tables of guests.

I decided upon the salad and fennel sausage, onion and gorgonzola pizza.   The salad consisted of little gem lettuce, it feels and tastes like a butter lettuce and looks like romaine  lettuce, roasted tomatoes and a house dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh with dressing on every surface of the lettuce, yet it wasn't too soggy or overwhelming. It was simple and delicious! The pizza was piping hot and a great alternative to Chicago deep dish. All three toppings stood out. The gorgonzola really mellows out in the wood-fired oven. I was worried it would be overwhelming.

2015-01-01,2.0,"I would have given this place three stars, if it weren't for how incongruously expensive our bill was compared to the mediocre quality of the meal. I cannot make an exception for the fact that it was New Year's Eve. For a $75 per person Prix Fixe Menu, a restaurant should have it right.  The beginning was relatively innocuous with a bottle of Nebiolo d'Alba Ochetti and duck confit arrincinis, which were actually quite good. The restaurant had another saving grace in its service, as our waiter and his supports staff were very polite and diligent. However, next came a shared beet salad that was okay and only filled a meager bread plate. Then the shared pizza, which I assume was meant to be a  Neapolitan-style, thin crust pizza. It tasted like Digiorno's or Amy's frozen pizza, which I wouldn't mind if I was scrounging for something to eat at home and didn't feel like cooking. The crust had that thick, doughy texture, instead of that Neapolitan floury, crispy but still soft texture. And, anyone who knows pizza can tell you that the crust is a huge part of what makes any great pizza. But, the entrees and the ""dessert"" were the most insulting.  My girlfriend ordered the scallops and I ordered the wild boar bolognese. Bolognese of any kind is one of my favorite Italian dishes of all time. I have eaten it in several amazing places and have made it, as well. And, I especially am fond of wild boar bolognese. Therefore, I regret to inform those reading this review that the wild boar bolognese was an ABOMINATION. The meat was ground, overcooked to dryness, and tasted like it came from Taco Bell. The bolognese was watery, tangy, and generally foul tasting as if it were made in a high school cafeteria or out of a bottle. Admittedly, scallops are difficult to cook. If over-cooked for even a minute, they will become balls of rubber. However, these tasted undercooked and bizarre as if they had been previously over frozen and tasted gooey in the middle. My girlfriend later felt nauseous right after dinner.  I returned the bolognese of which the waiter seemed to be very understanding. I opted for the steak dish instead, which was recommended medium-rare. It came to me medium to medium-well. Kind of tasted like Salisbury steak, but it was edible. However, the final slap in the face came from the ""desert"" and the manager's attempt to save face with a free glass of very awful Cabernet. First, the dessert was just a bite size cube of chocolate. Nothing says, ""thanks for your patronage, now go die"" like being told desert was included in a $75 Prixe Fixe menu and then getting a meager bite-sized morsel. As far as the free glass of wine was concerned, the manager offered Casillero de Diablo which I used to buy in college for $8 a bottle before I knew anything about what good wine tastes like. It tastes like fruity, death by head ache in a bottle.  All thing considered, the service is great, but the food is very mediocre and over-priced.

2014-12-10,4.0,"This is my friend's absolute favorite pizza place in Chicago and I was glad to get a meal here on my short visit! La Madia's definitely got a cool, sleek vibe. The lighting is dim and you feel like this could easily be turned into a happening lounge late at night with its modern, tasteful decor and a bar area that looks like the place to hang out. Yet you the kitchen is pretty visible, mostly out in the open, separated from the tables by a low counter. I had a full view of the pizza oven.  Our reservation was for 5:30pm on a Monday night, which was unnecessary as only a few other tables had customers. We had a very professional, responsive, and efficient server, and overall had a great dinner here. PIZZA * Parma Classic (red. arugula, prosciutto di parma. $19) - 4.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… The best pizza of the night in my opinion! I tend to like reds so I may be biased, but even for a red I thought the prosciutto was sharp and complemented the arugula and fresh tomato sauce really well. Their crust is thin and soft with a crisp, though not quite as fresh-out-of-the-oven as I'd prefer. The outer crust could've done with being a little more stretchy when I pulled it apart, but this is me being picky on a 4.5 star pizza! * Wild Mushroom (white. smoked mozzarella. $16) - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… Not a huge fan of white pizzas, and not a big lover of mushrooms, so this wasn't a winner for me flavor-wise. But it was well made and I will say the mushroom wasn't too overpowering and had a fairly well-balanced flavor. Overall I found it a bit bland though. * Moroccan Spiced Lamb Sausage (white. mint pesto. $17) - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… This was my pizza and it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped! The sausage wasn't very spicy, and its texture was a little chewy, reminiscent of chain-restaurant delivery pizza.  ENTRÉES * Tagliatelle (foie gras meatballs. $14 half) - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… This was exciting for me because foie gras isn't allowed in my home city of SF anymore. I couldn't really taste the foie gras to my disappointment though - if I hadn't been told what this was, I would have thought it was just regular meatballs. The tagliatelle was not as wide as I've had at other restaurants, but had a texture that was balanced between being soft and al dente. I found the sauce to be a little plain, and rather watery. It was nice to have the option of a half order. Menu:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…",0.974,0.84,0.115,0.044,0.4652101570745638

First off, this place is extremely loud!  Very difficult to hear the person you are dining with because it's so loud! I thought the food was average at best.  I didn't have pizza but I think it's what this place is known for.  I ordered chicken ravioli which was very bland and unremarkable.  I honestly think I could buy the prepared ravioli in the grocery store with a prepared sauce and it would be better!  I did think the arugula salad was good and the wine list was impressive (which is why I'm giving two stars) My partner also wanted one of their specialty cocktails, and they were out of one of their ingredients.  Seems like a lack of preparation for a Saturday evening. The most ridiculous aspect is the restroom situation.  There are two single restrooms - one general restroom and one women's room, which means the women seem to cut in line and does not make for an equitable situation for all customers!  Not sure why there wouldn't be a dedicated men's/women's room and why there aren't larger facilities for a fairly large, modern restaurant. I asked for the manager as I wanted to express my concerns and was greeted by one of the chefs, I believe.  He was quite dismissive about my concerns.  I know I look young but have traveled extensively throughout the U.S. and worldwide, for both business and pleasure, having numerous dining experiences.  Unfortunately, this will not be a place that I found to be memorable.",0.9795,0.779,0.151,0.071,0.6338718820861678

The noise level is manageable.  We sat at a round table, and I did not have trouble hearing or talking to anyone.  Our waiter was a bit soft spoken, but the echoes of clanging in the kitchen did not distract us.  Music played somewhat softly in the background, the club beats drowning out neighboring diners' voices. The food at La Madia is phenomenal.  I may never forgot how delicious their pizzas are.  Dominic P. and I shared the Triple Pepperoni (with white truffle oil) and the Taleggio & Roast Grapes.  Both were delicious, and the aroma of truffle was appetizing.  The crust is thin, but not soggy, and the edges were chewy and slightly charred in spots but not at all burnt.   Pizzas serve 1-2 people, depending how hungry you are.  Most of us ordered pizzas, and only one finished their whole pizza.  We had four slices left (of two pizzas), which made for a nice light lunch the next day. We also ordered the Italian Lettuces salad, but I wasn't a fan.  The salad needed more salad dressing and cheese.  Most of the lettuce was dry, and I had to wash it down with big gulps of water.  Skip the salads and go for the pizza! The wine list is the perfect size, and I chose to have their ""Pour of the Week,"" which is offered in both a red and white wine.  The Pinot Grigio for $6 was a great deal and a tasty wine which complimented the pizzas well. I love La Madia, and I would definitely go out of my way for their food.  For two of us (shared a salad, two pizzas, and two drinks), we spent  just over $50 before tax & tip.  That may seem a bit high for pizza, but this is quality pizza and not your local carryout joint.",0.9865,0.852,0.12,0.029,0.44104575163398685

The crust is tender and chewy so you don't see people throwing away the pizza bones like at some pizza places. They offer a nice selection of red and white pizzas so there's something for everyone. They have traditional and simple options but also more unique, complex pizzas.  My favorites from dinner last weekend:  Housemade lamb sausage, mint pesto, and fresno chilies.  Pork belly, kale, caramelized onions, and garlic.  Carbonara with guanciale, leeks, and eggs.  Everyone raves about the pepperoni pizza with truffle oil.

The thick cut toasted bread that accompanied the mussels was perfect to sop up the extra broth. I would order this again.

In fact, my fiance and I spent more money on our drinks with lunch than we did on our little luncheon (and we paid the additional $2 for it too).  *shrugs*  Priorities, I guess.  Plus, he wanted wine and I wasn't about to leave him drinking alone! For lunch, we shared the organic mixed greens salad, cracked organic egg pizza with prosciutto and black pepper.  The salad came with cucumber, crimini, tomato and herb vinaigrette. The salad was just OK and definitely not something to write home about.  It had an overall bitter taste to it since it had frisee on it.  Also, I guess I'm just used to eating salads with more on them so this felt a little too plain for me.  I wish my fiance and I would have sprung for a more adventurous salad choice. The pizza was fantastic!  Sometimes, it's good to change it up from the deep, cheesy deep dish that's part of Chicago's claim to fame.  I really liked that it was a white pizza.  Let's be real here.  You eat pizza for its cheesy yummy goodness not that sauce.  The addition of the salty prosciutto worked really well with the egg.  My only gripe was that you'd essentially pull off the entire strip of prosciutto when you took a bit of it.  The way it was arranged didn't give you enough meat for every bite.  Nonetheless, delicious pizza and I'd definitely eat it again. The Wisconsin Electric cookies were the perfect end to the meal.  They are butter cookies topped with candied lemon rinds and powdered sugar.  They were also served warm.  My only gripe was that I wish they were either larger or that they served you more of them.  I could have downed handfuls and wanted more. As for the beverages, they do a great job selecting a wine to go along with your pizza if you are into wine.  My fiance tried the one that paired with our pizza (a pinot noir) and he enjoyed it.  As for me, I tried the Crimson Crush cocktail (Citros Vodka, Pomegranate Juice, Fresh Lemon Sour, Muddled Mint Leaves, Gomme Syrup, Soda Water).  It was very delicious and is perfect for a hot, summer day.  It was a tad too strong for me, but I am such a lightweight. Our server was polite and friendly though she didn't check up on us that often.  We were given a carafe for water so there was no need for her to come back with refills.  The ambiance is modern and chic yet warm and inviting with dark wood tables and green and white accents. I'd definitely come back for lunch.  The price is right.  They even offer an $8 valet so you don't get gauged parking your car in a garage.  And, it was pretty dead on Saturday afternoon around 12:30.  Everyone must have been dining at more brunch type places.  That was a win for me since I was actually able to converse with my fiance.

2014-07-01,4.0,"Stop if you're a tourist looking for deep dish pizza.  The thin crust Neapolitan pizza is its polar opposite.  But if you're looking for accommodating host or waitress and good, decently priced food, then this is the place.  Plus, it doesn't seem to be that frequented by tourists, so if you want to go where the locals go, this seems to be such a place. We had been seated and given menus.  When our waitress saw our somewhat crestfallen faces, and I explained that we had hoped to try some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza, she was more interested in our happiness then us eating something there and not being happy - and so made recommendations on where to go have some.  But having walked about a mile in the sauna-like weather, we decided to go with her appetizer recommendation and have a salad.  Then, if we felt energetic enough, we'd go for the deep dish. But then the spinach and taleggio fondue (with a drizzle of truffle oil) came with its big (assumedly housemade) puffy bread accompaniment.  Wow!  Delicioso!  And the HUGE butter lettuce salad (palm heart, radish, almonds, and lemon chili dressing) we shared also won a big thumbs up from hubby.  (He pronounced it not salad-y.)  I thought it was a bit on the bland side and that it could have used a teensy bit more dressing, but liked the flavor combinations (and was scheming to figure out to make it at home). Well, after this, we felt, ""hey, we can still say we had Chicago pizza,"" so we went ahead and ordered the goat cheese, a white pizza with leeks, garlic, and pancetta.  Quite tasty; the combination seemed pretty perfect, with the pancetta adding a bit of color.  Plus, we got to use up the rest of the fondue as we dipped our crusts (and sometimes whole pieces of pizza).  Since we didn't have a fridge at the hotel, we ate the whole thing.  Which, fortunately or unfortunately, killed our ability to enjoy dessert, which looked also inviting. The ambiance was relaxed and was honestly anything one wanted it to be.  Close to where we were in the booth were two couples and an extremely well-behaved and charming toddler.  A few couples.  Two friends.  The noise level was actually not the general roar that we had encountered at other near-packed establishments.  And the decor was modern with lime green accents; quite pleasing to the eye. So while we'll be sure to come back to Chicago and try some famous deep dish pizza, we'll also be back to try some other pizzas - and some of the interesting-looking pasta.",0.9949,0.822,0.147,0.031,0.5064197530864198
2014-06-20,4.0,"La Madia is a great near North restaurant nestled among a lot of other really good ones, so I think sometimes it's overlooked. But among my friends, it is regarded as being a really good spot for girls' nights, business meals, and dates alike. I really love coming here with girlfriends for vino and pizza that is a little fancier than Malnati's or other Chicago favorites, but delicious nonetheless.  The wine list is really great - I actually haven't tried any on there that I didn't love. The appetizers are really good - especially love the Pizza Fondue that I tried for the first time last night - a bubble of pizza dough to dip in cheesy red sauce.  Usually when I go with friends, we split a salad and a couple of pizzas. One that they are known for, the Tallegio and Three Hour Roasted Grape Pizza, may sound odd but it's such a delicious marriage of salty and sweet that you will understand why it's one of their signature items. Also can't go wrong with the standard margherita but I have tried and loved the Spinach and goat cheese, the kale and pork belly, and a number of the other awesome pizzas.  Bottomline, they have really delicious and creative ingredients that they put atop their chewy amazing crust and I don't think any of the pizzas could turn out bad. They also have some semi-private rooms incase you are interested in planning an event here, which I'm sure party guests would go crazy for! I definitely keep it in mind for parties and such.

I left the experience without much to say about it, though. I DO want to try it again...because I love the idea of La Madia so much. The ambiance here is really nice. The waitstaff is welcoming and very happy to make suggestions. My boyfriend and I took the suggestion and got one red pizza and one white (even though when I eat Italian style pizza, I think you should go white all the way). We ordered the triple pepperoni and the taleggio and grape pizzas as well as some wine to slurp it all down with.  We really enjoyed the wine and (odd as it is to note) we liked the wine glasses it was served in (we got both red and white). When the pizza came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. The taleggio and grape was tasty, but after a couple bites in, the cheese started to feel kind of hard and not as fresh as I had hoped. We really enjoyed the triple pepperoni pizza, but there was a quality to the crust that made it taste more like a delivery pizza than others I've had at similarly styled restaurants. We were kind of bummed. Overall, for the price range of the restaurant, I thought the ambiance and service were just right. The food, however, just wasn't that good. I want to try it again, to see if maybe this was a fluke. I might not get the wine next time, though, because the bathrooms are single stall. I think that's a poor choice for a restaurant that serves alcohol, but it is what it is. Be prepared to wait for the bathroom if you need to go.",0.8919,0.861,0.096,0.044,0.4118923611111111

My lunch partner did not think it was worth the price for such a ""little"" pizza (he polished off his whole pizza and drink and it cost over $23 w/o tip) and made me stop into another pizza place that sold the hugest, greasiest pizza slice I'd ever seen for $4.95 a slice on the way back to work...  Bottom line, I would come back to this place. Decor was clean and modern, it's dead-ish on a regular work day for lunch, and I did like what I got.

We started off with the beet salad and the chopped Italian salad. I really liked the beet salad. I'm usually not a huge fan of beets but La Madia has it down. The Italian chopped salad is great too.  We then ordered Spinach & Taleggio Fondue with white truffle oil. The green color of the dipping sauce made me a little apprehensive at first.... but it was fantastic. Our waitress advised us to save the left over sauce we had for our pizza. Great advice. Everyone was a fan of the spinach and telegio sauce. So good.  We ordered the triple pepperoni pizza with white truffle oil and a margarita pizza. I personally liked the margarita pizza better than the triple peperoni. I felt as though the crust of the pepperoni pizza got soggy because all of the grease. That's understandable though. I also felt like the only thing I tasted was the peperoni. If you are a huge fun of peperoni this is most likely the pizza you should choose.  Also they have a wine pairing with each of their pizzas which is pretty interesting as well.

The restaurant is casual and stylish, and it's nice to see an affordable but trendy place in the area.  It's a relief from the expensive River North scene! We started with a bottle of wine - they have a pretty big list and denote which ones are organic/sustainable.  Lots of Italian wines.  Several under $40 but don't think I saw any under $30.  Then we shared the beet salad, which was very beautiful with both red and golden beets.  It was delicious and fresh, with nice dabs of goat cheese amongst the dark greens.  Definitely share a salad before you move on to pizzas! Pizzas are 12 inches and divided into 8 small slices each.  We got 2, the Triple Pepperoni and the Lamb Sausage with mint pesto.  The former was a red pizza, the latter was a white pizza, and the menu is divided to specify which is which.  The pepperoni pizza was great although a bit greasy.  Lots of meat which was crispy around the edges.  You could smell the truffle oil as soon as they put it down.  The lamb sausage was also delicious and creative, the mint pesto added a really nice touch.  Pizzas are served with red pepper flakes and parmesan alongside.  The crust was appealingly crisp.  So nice to have a thin crust pizza in a deep-dish town!  This was the perfect amount of food for four girls and we really enjoyed everything.

2014-02-03,4.0,"The menu at La Madia in River North has a great selection of starters and salads, pastas and mains, but the highlight here are the pizzas (with the caveat that I actually haven't had the pasta or entrees here, but should plan on making a trek just for those).  As you walk in, you can instantly smell the aroma given off by the wood-fired oven in back, and walking by tables, one can spot dishes that focus on extremely fresh ingredients.  The pizzas are split into ""red"" pizzas topped with tomato sauce, and ""white"" pizzas that focus on the ingredients only.   My date opted for one of the reds, the housemade fennel sausage with sweet onions and mozzarella.  The pizzas at La Madia keep the dough simple and thin, cooked with a perfect wood-fired char on the crust but a nice doughy consistency on the inside.  The sausage was flavorful and the remainder of the ingredients balanced out the pie nicely.  The sausage itself lacked a bit of spice, but that was easily corrected by adding a bit of crushed red pepper.   To contrast, I went with one of the whites - the cracked organic egg, prosciutto, and black pepper pizza. Thankfully, mine was cooked with a bit more char on the crust (I prefer mine with a nice crisp - Sara enjoys a bit more chewiness).  Surprisingly the egg emparted a deep flavor to the dish to replace the usual presence of cheese, and it offset the saltiness of the prosciutto nicely.  Sprinkled with some black pepper to add just the right amount of kick, this may be one of my go-to pies in a pinch.  My only complaint was the full size pieces of prosciutto made it difficult to avoid grabbing the whole piece of prosciutto in your first bite of a slice - I would definitely suggest to cut the meat into slightly smaller pieces to disperse it a bit.   Overall, La Madia focuses on traditional, fresh Italian ingredients and is up to par with the top thin-crust, wood fired pizza joints in the city (Piece and Coalfire immediately come to mind).  With the Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza on the menu at Piece, we'll probably be making a trek up to Bucktown in the near future to compare, but you can't go wrong if you're looking for pie in the River North area.   pics up at my blog:  eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.9912,0.818,0.137,0.046,0.5196560846560845

Pasta was the choice of the evening -one was a special with crab, another was the chicken/spinach ravioli in a brown butter sauce, and lastly pappardelle with tomato and chicken ragu.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees, but no wows or crazy good emerged from the lips of the diners.  It was a solid meal.  Glad we checked this one off our list, but chances are there will not be a repeat as there are just too many other restaurants to explore.",0.9941,0.731,0.244,0.025,0.5489880952380952

He even overheard that it was my birthday and brought a dessert - and my friends hadn't even told him! What a great gesture. I'll be back again.

2013-09-15,4.0,"I am teetering on whether to give them 4 or 5 stars, so if this were a 10 star system, I'd give them a solid 9.   This is my first time there despite my intentions to get there months ago.  I'm sorry I waited so long.  So far, this is literally some of the very finest pizza I've ever had. I qualify it because I've only had one pizza, and I think I should try a few more before giving it an absolute rating.   I had the Triple Pepperoni Pizza.  I honestly had no idea what to order since all the pizzas looked so so good.  So to decide I simply asked what the server what was the most popular and he said it was this one without hesitation.  It did not disappoint. The pizza had pepperoni on every inch of the pizza without overpowering the other flavors of the pizza, including the truffle oil.  I was skeptical about putting truffle oil on a pepperoni pizza because of this.  The chef-owner shows his European training by knowing how to combine flavors subtly and proportionately.  The result is that I tasted great pepperoni which combined with the incredible flavor of truffle oil.  So good! The crust was perfect. A fire oven makes a crust that complements and doesn't take over the pizza.   Because my date wasn't drinking I felt it inappropriate to drink in her presence so I had some very refreshing, fresh Lemon-Pommegranite Lemonade.  It was served beautifully and tasted wonderful, not too sweet. It complemented the pizza.  My one complaint, $5 for an 8oz juice?  Really guys? REALLY?????  Seriously?  It was a rip off of the highest calibre.   The ambience is fantastic.  It is hip, cosmopolitan, fun, serious without being formal.  It's a fantastic place to enjoy a pizza.   Now, if you wonder why I don't complain about the price of the pizzas, they may or may not be overpriced, I don't know.  Nothing pisses me off more than people who THINK they know what something should cost and when it doesn't they complain it is overpriced.  Ugh!  Morons!  I know these guys use fresh ingredients, truffle oil is EXPENSIVE, fresh basil is EXPENSIVE, good meats, pepperoni, prosciutto are expensive!  So to pay $17 for the pizza I had may have been reasonable. The service was barely adequate, but nothing to be too worried about.   Patronize this place.  There's a definite difference between chef-owned restaurants and the rest.  The passion for food shows.",0.9842,0.823,0.131,0.047,0.5965029761904761

2013-06-30,4.0,"Literally my last meal out before I drove out east was at a long time staple of the River North scene that for some reason had always evaded me. Perhaps that's my fault for always seeking out the new without spending as much time on the staples. Either way I was thrilled to try it out before leaving and having friends Kate and Jon show me the way with one of their neighborhood favs. The other awesome aspect of going with friends that know the place is that I could sit back and relax while they did the ordering. And they chose well.  We started with a grilled artichoke, that had some delicious seasonings and dipping sauces. Artichokes have always been a standard feature of any summer dinner growing up. My mother loves to make them simply steamed so any comparison to childhood memories are hard to make but La Madia does a nice job - a good way to wet the palette. The main course was pizza. All kinds of pizza that I didn't choose, but ate too much of. I don't remember the specifics or which one I like most because they were all delicious. I think one was a pepperoni and truffle oil, one had goat cheese and bacon and I know the last one was tasty with hot peppers. They come out fresh and hot, super thin cust authentic style and ready to go. Even though they have a solid take-out business, these are not pizza's I can see doing too well away from the over and transport over long distances. Even by the end of our meal I noticed that they cool off fast, and the thin crust can lose its firmness with the tasty oils and cheese doing their work. So just eat good and fast! We finished off the night, after over eating pizza, with a surprisingly amazing little dish of chocolate polenta cake. Never would have thought of that but it tastes great. Must try. Aside from having a very good pizza oven and a nice wine selection - I think the most understated aspect of La Madia that makes it successful is the ability to truly make it an every night, neighborhood restaurant. It's family friendly, inviting, broad options of other Italian items on the menu, and affordable - easily a place you could call home, or come by yourself, etc. Not sure how I made it living in Chicago without ever trying La Madia, but better late than never, and now I know where to go for good thin crust pizza when I visit!",0.9986,0.757,0.229,0.014,0.5647335398805988

I would've never thought to put grapes on a pie.  The sweetness of the grapes balances out the bite of the tallegio making this a delicious pie to enjoy.  Very nice combination, unlikely as it would be. Carbonara - I was very curious to see how they would make this one.  Seeing that I've been making a lot of pies lately, learning how to crack an egg onto the pizza to create such a lush, velvety feeling of egg yolk combined with the chew and crisp of guanicale... I knew this could turn out terrible or wonderful.  I""m glad it was the latter.  If you're like me and like mixing your egg yolk into different dishes (over easy eggs on sandwiches, in rice, in pasta, etc.)  this is right up your alley.  Two over easy eggs on top cracked on midway through the cook, and finished from the heat of the pizza, then carefully cut so that the yolk covers a bit of every slice... man, this was soo good. Verdict:  While the dough doesn't have the rise I""d expect of Neapolitan (which to be fair they don't necessarily claim they are, but closely imitate), their traditional pies are enjoyable.  It's their perfect execution of some of the more innovative flavor profiles that make them stand out and gain the extra star since my last visit, paired with our superb service at lunch.

I'd say half the time, we have fantastic service, and half the time we don't. The deal they have, however, is good enough to put up with the not-good service at times. For dinner? Not so much. My parents were in town and I was entrusted with making the dinner reservation for us to celebrate their anniversary. Honestly? It was not good. Despite having a reservation, they tried to seat us at the first table when you walk in the door. You know, that table that is left open for people that don't make reservations? The one that gets the cold air from the front door and the people bumping into them? I'm not a diva, but I wasn't going to let that fly. They were able to accommodate with another table (with minimal grumbling), so I thought we were fine. Not so much. Our server was absent for much of our meal. We had probably six different people attending to our table that did not return if we requested something. We requested ice for our sparkling water (never received it), parmesan/red peppers for our pizza (never received it). When my husband and mother wanted another glass of wine, they had to physically flag down our server. It was kind of embarrassing for me, as I had made the reservation thinking my parents would really enjoy it. The triple pepperoni pizza (the best, in our opinion) was good, but tasted as if it had been sitting there for a bit. It wasn't fresh. The pork belly pizza, on the other hand, was not very good. I liked the cheese on it, but that was about it. The crust was soggy, and the entire pizza tasted entirely of carmelized onions. Just....no. Not good.

An appetizer, salad, pizza and dessert.  Our table opted for two of each of the fondues for the appetizer portion of the meal. They were both delicious. The pizza fondue had an almost vodka sauce like component to it, it was definitely not your average pizza sauce! The spinach and cheese fondue was literally out of this world, it was so yummy I wanted to drink it. Additionally the portion sizes were enormous. Something I definitely hope to go back for.  For the salads we all opted for the romaine salad with creamy mustard dressing. A bit boring but no one could say no to creamy mustard dressing and crispy pancetta with shaved Parmesan. Our lack of creativity in ordering this course paid off because we all loved the salads and couldn't get enough. For our pizzas we ordered the cheese, sausage, pork belly and artichoke. I tried all but the cheese and they were delicious.  Unfortunately by the time the pizzas came we were all quite full and couldn't eat much. I was a big fan of the pork belly pizza but really enjoyed all of them. Helpful hint: if you order the fondue as an appetizer keep whatever is left over for dipping your pizza in!  When it came time for dessert three of us ordered the crostada and one orders the gelato. All were good but lots was left over because we were so stuffed!  While the food is outstanding I also cannot go without mentioning the ambiance and service. The place has a trendy but intimate vibe to it. I think it would be a great place to go on a date for dinner or drinks. The bar is also very nice. With that said it is also a good place for a girls night out, especially because of the large portion sizes and ability to share.  The service was fine but not exceptional. We were slightly peeved when a server took my dining companions boxed up leftovers and threw them out when we were not looking. We asked about them and were given a fresh pizza but had to wait an additional ten minutes for it, fine but still a bit annoying. I also didn't love our server.

And as a suburbanite who only ventures to the city on the weekends, I select my spots carefully to get the most bang for my buck. La Madia's $33/person four-course dinner was well worth it for me and I would certainly return without that special. My husband and I met up with two married friends from out of town last night who had just happened to experience Ann Arbor, Mich.'s Restaurant Week last weekend. As self-proclaimed foodies these people were looking to be impressed, so I had hoped I made the right decision with going to La Madia. Right from the get-go when ordering a bottle of wine to share, my gal pal in the couple was happy to see a huge selection with some affordable bottles in her preferred year of 2008. As for the food, I'm going to have to do a quick-hit list of highlights because of how much we tasted from each other's choices in our two-and-half-hour long feast: Starters- *Spinach and Taleggio Fondue with Truffle Oil and Pizza Bread: When this came out, it looked like a ginormous calzone next to a pot of creamy pesto. To our surprise, when we ripped open the bread, it was crisp on the outside and light, fluffy and empty on the inside, with steam emitting as if it was just baked. It was like dipping pita bread or naan into the pot of melted herby cheese. *Seasonal Wild Mushrooms Bruschette with Whipped Ricotta and Marsala Glaze: This was more of a small bite portion. It was the perfect match of sweet and savory. Salad-  All of these seemed to be decent size portions with bright veggies. *I LOVED my Heirloom Beets Salad. The beets were ultra fresh and juicy, pairing well with crunchy almonds and smooth, creamy goat cheese. Entree- The stars of the show are obviously the pizzas we had. Among the Triple Pepperoni, Smoked Porkbelly and the Summer Squash, I absolutely adored the Triple P. *The thin crust was super light with flavorful tomato sauce and just the right amount of cheese (I hate when there's too much cheese). But the rich and spicy thin-sliced meat on top with a drizzle of (more!) truffle oil is really the combo of ingredients that set this pizza apart from the others. Desserts- *Bittersweet Chocolate Tortino- Very dark chocolate cake (a bit dry but still packed a punch of rich flavor) with slivers of almonds on top and a creamy ganache center paired well with the other dessert choice I liked... *Gelato of the Moment- This happened to be Chianti (perfect for our wine-loving friends). Not as rich as I thought it would be - more like fruity ice cream, but still refreshing on the palate so I'm glad I got it. Overall, I would definitely return to try other items on the menu. This spot is a hip, modern pizzeria with solid, consistent service despite how crazy busy it got through the night. (I'm talking every table occupied with about 15 people waiting around in the bar and hostess stand area.) So definitely make an Open Table reservation when going during the weekend. I'm sure it's busy regardless of Restaurant Week!",0.9957,0.855,0.133,0.013,0.531489197530864
2013-01-14,4.0,"Did not have super high expectations from La Madia before going but was delightfully surprised by the tasty food! Called for table of 4 around 6 on a Saturday and were told it was a 40 min wait or we could sit at the ""pizza bar"" with complimentary glasses of prosecco. Sign me up! Upon arrival, the pizza bar was literally just 10 tables bar-style in front of the kitchen. For the future, I would only do this type of seating for 2 or 3 people because bar seating is awkward for 4 people trying to have a convo.  As for the FOOD, smallish menu but packed with all sorts of delicious pizzas, small assortment of entrees, pastas, apps.  We got mixed greens salad (very fresh), a red pizza with a spicy pepperoni sausage banana peppers and onions, a white pizza with pork belly kale and carmelized onions, and a italian sausage gnocchi.  All the flavors of everything were really great and fresh. The gnocchi surprisingly came with a super tasty pork broth so it was deeeelish.  Service was great too, bill came out to be like $70 after tip, not too shabby.  If you're in the area, check out La Madia for great modern italian!",0.9916,0.771,0.193,0.035,0.5112878787878787

The pizzas are thin crust and made in a wood oven with delicious, super fresh ingredients.  But beware, at peak times if you order a pizza you'll be in for a wait because the kitchen often gets backed up on the pizza orders.  I also have been very impressed with their pasta dishes.  Hands down my favorite thing to eat at la Madia is their short ribs over vegetable risotto.  Yum!   Make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday because it can get really crowded.",0.9817,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.6927350427350428
2012-06-24,5.0,"Giordano's, you have some competition for my love. When I first moved to Chicago from Brooklyn, I was flabbergasted that anyone would try to say that their pizza was better than Brooklyn pizza. Then I had Giordano's and my world was never the same and I then understood the meaning of an addiction. Recently, a friend's suggestion to meet for dinner at La Madia upset that dynamic again. La Madia is on like a light! We, four of us, started with a pizza bread fondue that was worthy of an encored. The marinara sauce was perfect for sopping and the bread reminded me of Indian bhatura bread but without having been fried. Just all about love. We had a pizza with grapes on it. Being pescatarian, I am open to anything that panders to my vegetarian palate, but a grape pizza sounded a bit too exotic. After we had polished every slice, it was clear that I could wrap my mind around such a pizza and my finger around slices accordingly. The pepperoni pizza with truffle sauce, but minus the pepperoni, was next and I was again reminded of Brooklyn pizza. Granted truffle sauce is not common on Brooklyn pizza, I folded the slices that I had and smiled as I gnashed away on the slices that I had. Complete satisfaction. Can't say that I will chance going to any other specialty pizza cafes because I don't want to fall out of love with pizzas. La Madia raised the bar for pizza in Chicago. Anything that gives Giordano's a run for its money is stiff competition. Take it from a Brooklynite who appreciates pizza.",0.9912,0.833,0.156,0.011,0.46969696969696967

2012-05-24,4.0,"It's a shame that it took me so long to return to La Madia, since they have two of my favorite things on their menu:  a beet salad and a calzone. Two calzones, actually.  I eschewed the house-made fennel sausage variety in favor of a slightly healthier chicken and spinach.  Big thumbs up.  They don't put any sauce in their calzone, but they do serve it with a generous side-cup of their cheesy, aromatic marinara, which matches up very well.  The proportion of crust to fillings is so important in a calzone, and La Madia nails it.  The crust comes out puffed up high on the top for an interesting presentation, but the consistency is light, thin, and chewy, and the totality of the crust is in perfect balance with the rest of the calzone.  Overall this calzone scores very high on my list despite its departure from traditional ingredients and construction. The beet salad was pretty standard, which is to say enjoyable even if not interesting. I also ordered a Not So Old Fashioned cocktail, which turned out to be not so interesting.  Shrug. I will definitely keep this place in mind for weekend lunches downtown--or whenever I get a calzone craving.",0.9918,0.793,0.197,0.009,0.5543466666666667
2012-05-11,4.0,"3.5 stars for me, but I'll round it up since the dinner was one of the only non-wallet busting meals I enjoyed in Chicago.  My bestie and I had planned on visiting the very popular Purple Pig this particular Monday evening, but alas no reservations equals no seating for 2.5 hours. Yes, you heard me right--it was a Monday. I'll have to save the Purple Pig for another time, but La Madia was another option within quick walking distance.  We were starving, so you could imagine my happiness to walk in and be seated immediately. Yes! No chaos, no over-hyping, just great pizzas, salads, apps and vibe. To start we both ordered Prosecco and the roasted artichokes. I was surprised to see two, big 'chokes come out! Typically in big cities you pay big buck for teeny portions, but not here! I got right down to ripping, dipping and scrapping the tender leaves with my teeth. They served these treats with a oil-based dip, a creamy aioli-like dip and wedges of lemon. Perfection.  After much deliberation, we decided to share a salad and a pizza--a great choice. The salad was a three romaine chop-like mix with walnuts, gorgonzola and a mustard dressing. It was just OK. I couldn't really taste the dressing (at all), but the salad was wet like it was covered in something--I'm assuming it was oil. The pizza was very good! Chewy, thin crust, just how I like it and covered with a marinara, prosciutto, arugula and big parmesan shavings. I've add similar, better pies in Cleveland, but it was still delish.  All said, I would certainly come back to dine here when I'm in town. The pizza reminds me of Bar Cento in CLE, which brings me some familiarity while not breaking the bank.

Romaine salad was terrific, the pancetta bacon-o's made it. The arugula salad was also spot on, we enjoyed it very much.  Pizzas - the egg and guanciale was ridiculous - garlicky and awesome.

I have mentioned the good (if over-priced) wine list, but this is ridiculous!! $19 for a corkage fee??? Many places I've eaten will waive a corkage fee if you buy another bottle. AND, this is in a town where there are hundreds of BYOB's?? I don't mind a 100% markup from retail (they buy wholesale!) but they're charging 3X retail! Come on La Madia!

2012-02-11,4.0,"""The Cupboard"" - Google Translate, on Italian setting We wanted to try something new (to us) in the River North area and found La Madia. Gourmet pizza sounded appealing at the time so why not? La Madia is very cozy and cute - their seats are Paul Smith (check out their website!) We decided to go for an appetizer, a salad, a red sauce and a white sauce pizza, and a shared dessert. - Our appetizer was the Pizza Fondue, which was steaming hot bread with tomato sauce on the side. It was good - though it was hard to taste the cheese in the advertised ""cheesy sauce."" - The Nichols Farm Heirloom Beets salad was excellent; I didn't knew about different, lighter beets (I thought they were tomatoes). Portion is reasonable, and the beets are sweet and delicious. Add the almonds and the goat cheese, and it's a great all-around salad. - Red sauce pizza: the Housemade Fennel Sausage & Sweet Onions was pretty good, somewhat normal-tasting pizza because of the standard tomato sauce + cheese + sausage combination. We got what we ordered, and it was a nice contrast to the white sauce pizza. - White sauce pizza: the Taleggio and 3-Hour Roasted Grapes basically was taleggio cheese on a thin crust with raisins. I prefer red sauce, but this was nice to try. Plus, how easy it is to talk about the background of 3-hour grapes. - Dessert: the Caramel Apple & Sweet Cream Crostata, Caramel Gelato was a last minute decision which was basically a crispy incarnation of apple pie topped with ice cream. It was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. A nice touch to the end of a meal. We had a great time at La Madia's - I later heard that their mussels are amazing in case seafood is up your alley.

2011-12-17,3.0,"Every November we celebrate our committee's hard work by having our meeting at a downtown hotel the week before Thanksgiving and taking them out for a nice dinner out. We are usually a group of 25 (or so) and our past venues have included Sullivan's, Amano, Prosecco, Quartino's and now La Madia.  I will start by saying the service I received was wonderful. Emily the private dining coordinator was pleasant to work with and made everything a breeze for our party of 28. My only criticism was the lack of follow-up after our event as I did have a few comments I would have liked to have passed along but I suppose that is what Yelp is for, no? The restaurant is rather loud. While we did request a private space the only space available for our rather large group was the ""stage area"". It still in the main dining area so if you are considering this space, keep it mind that it will still be loud making it difficult for your guests to converse. The service was a little spotty. It seemed like it took a little longer than usual to get and receive our drink orders. At the end of the year, we sometimes really like to toss a few back and CELEBRATE but the drinks were not rolling in fast enough to achieve this....a shame since we purchased a bar package.  The food was pretty solid. We enjoyed the variety that was brought to our table. The dining & bar packages they have are extremely affordable. Bread and oil is brought out to every table and they will bring you more if you ask. We we're brought out some apps of carpacio, warm nicoise olives and bruschetta. Warm olives? A revelation! A couple of salads followed the appetizers - an arugula and a beet salad. I love beets so it's usually always a win/win for me.  Starter courses were followed by three types of pizza. Two reds - fennel sausage & onion and margarhita and one white - shaved artichoke. They were all quite tasty. Entrees were up next - tagliatelle americano a chicken milanese. Both of these dishes were tasty enough but nothing you'd go ""ZOMG"" over. Of course we finished up with dessert - a chocolate bomb sort of thing and crostino w/vanilla ice cream. Both satisfied.   The total for the food and 2 hour bar package was around $65 per person. See what I mean about being affordable? La Madia is totally doable on a budget. I just wish this place had not been so loud and that the dining service had been a little more attentive. I do not think that the food was totally comparable to the other venues we had tried in the past but I definitely would not hesitate to come back on my own for a slice (or five) of their homemade 'za, some warm olives and a couple glasses of vino if in the area.

Overdone scallops drowning in polenta that was tepid. Not impressive. I ate it, but I did not enjoy it. Had I been eating pizza that night, my life would've been better. Surely the wine and salads were great (despite them bringing only one instead of two salads, and us having to adjust to get another one to the table).  The service was fine.

Wandered around the neighborhood and found La Madia almost empty. Great outdoor seating and a cute interior. We were sold. They have an extensive wine list. The husband ordered a glass of Fournier and I got a Tamellini. Perfect for summer outdoor dining. We decided to order the luncheon for two: a selection of beginner, one pizza, and two cookies.  For a beginner, we split the heirloom beet salad. Soft slices of beets served with watercress, salt roasted almonds, and gorgonzola. Excellent salad. For the pizza, we got the triple pepperoni pizza made with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, topped with white truffle oil.  The pizza is the best I've had in Chicago. The experience can to be compared to the times when I like to be dominated by someone who is quite unassuming. Like that one aggressive guy who looks and acts innocent until he starts riding you like a rodeo cowboy. La Madia pizza is like that. This is how it would have went down, if the pizza could speak: Me: Hmmm... I am skeptical. Can you stand up to a NY-style pizza? La Madia Pizza (LMP): Just try me. *LMP gets naked* Me: Damn, this is good pizza *LMP pins me down and starts riding me like a cowboy* LMP: so, you think Chicagoans can't make a pizza huh? What do you think now? You little b*tch!! Me: Yes! Yess!! Yesss!!! LMP: You want some more? Here, have a few more slices. And while you are it, sprinkle some of that parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes Me: *moaning* yes mmmm, yes.... this is f*cking awesome. LMP: So, what do you think? Was that a pretty good ""ride""? Me: Hells yeah!! LMP: Now you know, b*tch! Me: Yes, I do! LMP: Why don't you come here next week and we will do this all over again. I may bring some special toys for you next time. Me: oooooh, I am all excited. So yeah, I have another session planned with LMP. Next time I am going for a 3some. I will order two different pizzas.",0.9933,0.769,0.163,0.068,0.5841080876795164
