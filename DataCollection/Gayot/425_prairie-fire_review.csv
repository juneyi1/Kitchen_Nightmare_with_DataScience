My only nit was the over-naming of the produce.  I mean, we get that it's local (and like that), but half the menu was taken up listing the farms.  We haven't heard of them and, frankly, don't really care about which farm raised our grilled pumpkin (which was incredible, and I usually don't like pumpkin).",0.7493,0.832,0.122,0.047,0.4991666666666667

The music was so awful as to be distracting.  I felt like we were listening to someone's playlist from 1995 - the theme from Friends, Counting Crows, Red Hot Chili Peppers, to name a few. Uninspired decor.  Trains rattling overhead.  Combined with the bizarre musical selections, it was downright depressing. We had a 5pm reservation pre-opera.  We showed up a few minutes early and were told they hadn't opened, perhaps we'd like to enjoy a drink at the bar.  No problem.  Except one table was already seated, the bartender was nowhere to be found, and the hostess seated two other tables, then chatted with a co-worker for 5 minutes before asking if we'd like to be shown to ours. Again, the food was good but for the price, I expect the whole package - excellent service and MUCH better atmosphere.  Our bill was $142 before tip for 2 people.  (A starter, entree, dessert, and 2 drinks each - and one of those entrees was only a burger.)

However, nothing about this place really excited me. When Powerhouse was here, I felt like is was a great new place in a somewhat quiet part of the Loop to go.

I'm not sure what the problem is, but they just don't seem to attract business. The location is great and they seem to have a reasonably capable bartender. But they're just not getting any bar business. Or dining room business. So maybe it's all about the patio? In any case, we didn't want to sit on the street, inhaling diesel fumes. At the bar, we had cockails (peach mojito and cosmo respectively). The drink ingredients were top notch and the fruits came from real fruits, not concentrated juice.They also had Gruet, which is my favorite American, non-American sparkling wine (really, it's champagne).

Paired with goat cheese and crushed up walnuts, it was very fresh and light tasting. My date had the Terrine of Amish Blue Cheese salad and he absolutely loved it. The log of blue cheese on the plate was enormous and it was rolled in crushed pistachios with some grapes throughout. Um, AMAZE! I of course had to steal a bite and it was a very light and creamy blue cheese. Delish!  For our entree's I ordered the Ahi Tuna. O-M-G. It was obviously slightly seared on the outside and served with mushrooms and bok choy in this sauce that was out of this world. It was a mix between a spicy soy sauce with sesame. The sauce was by far the best part of the dish. It was just so delicious. My date had the Crispy 1/2 Duck and his was also out of this world. The duck was cooked perfectly and wasn't too dry. It was served with a corn relish on the side, which complimented the duck very well. We ended up dipping some of his duck/the crispy skin in my broth and we were in heaven!  OK, now comes the best part of the meal...the dessert. We ordered the Warm Sticky Toffee Date Cake. The description says enough. It was served fresh out of the oven and the cake tasted just like a banana bread with a scoop of ice cream on top with a sticky sauce underneath. It was out of this world. I cant even put into words how delicious this dessert was. It was so good we discussed it hours later because we couldn't get it off our minds.  I would definitely recommend a night out at Prairie Fire. The food is spot on and the desserts are amaze. Our service was pretty good as well, although my date was a little creeped out by our server.

Modern and comfortable with low ceilings and big booths, but hotel dining. Not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. It can also get pretty loud in here quickly, though there is a private dining room for special events. The menu itself all sounded great from what we read but the server was not particularly helpful. I'm one of those people that always asks the waiter/waitress for a recommendation but he wasn't biting. On top of that he stood at several tables with his hands on his hips.

The food was delicious, nothing was particularly unique or innovative, but it's hard to mess up brunch.  The portions were hearty, yet nothing was too greasy or heavy, everything was very light, fresh and green. On the negative side, the service was slow and our server was totally strange.  He referred to everyone as ""dude"" or ""my friend"" and seemed really nervous when we had questions.  I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was his first day, but on top of his overly-casual lexicon, he never took our drink orders, waited forever to finally take our food order, and never came to refill coffee/tea.  My friends and I are pretty laid back 20-somethings, so we're used to a casual atmosphere, but even this made us uncomfortable. All in all, the food was fine, but you could probably get the same omelet at your local neighborhood restaurant (with better service).  I have no major complaints, it's a great spot if you find yourself in the west loop, but it's not worth traveling for.",0.9836,0.694,0.194,0.111,0.5512825208979055

They were out of the soup of the day, the butternut squash bisque.  It's 8:30 on a Saturday night and you are out of one your specials?  I had the crab cake which was good, clearly fresh and all crab.  Then I had the parmesan crusted tilapia on creamed spinach which was pretty boring and the fish was slightly overcooked.  I then finished with the Blueberry crumble wondering where they got blueberries this time of year.  The  server responded with ""the border of Indiana and Kentucky.""  What?  It was good.  My boyfriend had the spinach salad with pea shoots which was really good.  Then the brisket which was dry.  He had the banana cream pie and loved it. I will acknowledge that it was Chef's Week and they offer a limited menu so I was not able to choose from perhaps their more specialty dishes and if I ever go back I will try one of those dishes.  The menu looked good and the prices were reasonable.  I am just not sure that I want to go back to try the rest of the menu.",0.9916,0.807,0.153,0.039,0.556900352733686

Prairie Fire is Awesome with a Capital A. This swank little eatery is offers everything you need for a wonderful dining experience, delicious food, top notch service and a fun atmosphere. To me, there is nothing better than being in a packed restaurant surrounded by people who are enjoying themselves. My wife and I were surrounded by nothing but smiles and laughter throughout our whole meal. In my humble opinion, the difference between a good restaurant and a great restaurant is the vibe. You can literally feel that fun vibe at Prairie Fire when you walk in the door.   The food? Well that's where Prairie Fire really shines. We ordered off the prefixed, restaurant week menu. This menu had something for everybody. As my appetizer, I went with the Chorizo Pizza. This generous portion of Za was loaded with Chorizo, or as I like to call it, the Mexican Nectar of the Gods. This take on Neapolitan Pizza is wonderful.   My entree can only be described as Drool-o-licous. I ordered their signature, beef brisket that's served on a bed of mashed potato's with carrots and peas. The meat was tender, juicy and marinated to the nines with flavor. The potato's were creamy and delicious. This dish was so good that I actually ate the vegetables, and I hate veggies more than a kick in the groin.   The desert was a perfect example of why the rest of the world hates America. The double chocolate cake at Prairie Fire is pure decadence. We are talking a sugar coma from hell. With every bite I could feel my blood sugar rise. By the time I finished it, I was in severe need of a insulin shot. Not that I'm complaining, the desert was amazing.   The delicious bottom line on my visit the Prairie Fire is: Amazing food, great service and wonderful people make this fabulous eatery a place that I can't wait to return to.

I then had the fish, which was salmon that night.  A very nice cut of fish, flaky, excellently seasoned.  It came on a bed of mashed potato and some kind of vegetable - I couldn't determine whether it was parsnip or white asparagus?  Either way, it was good!  Andy had the brisket, which came almost like a stew over mashed potatoes.   For dessert, I had the pie of the day which was cherry (and the last piece too! After that they changed it to lemon chiffon or something like that).  The crust was awesome - very flaky and light, with a nice tart cherry filling.  Andy had chocolate cake which was good, but not compared to my pie!  My one issue with this place is the decor. It is oddly bland and reminds me of dining rooms in mid range hotels. In fact, the hotel restaurant we went to for Valentines Day (Lockwood) was WAY nicer than this.  This is very pedestrian with the grey carpet and cream walls.  And the artwork (more like stock photos mounted on foam core) are pointless, as well as the lights with the covers that have the fire print on them.  They have a nice base with the furniture and lighting, they just need to amp it up a bit.",0.9897,0.814,0.165,0.021,0.6095238095238095

I have been to the best veggie restaurants, and nothing compares to this potpourri of vegetable dishes. (You could also do the dish as ""vegan request"", but I can't vouch for the vegan style.) Beyond vegetables, let me sum it up using the measure of a truly excellent restaurant: I never tried a dish here that I didn't love. Granted, I do not find the steak to be a value, but you get what you pay for grass-fed beef. Yes, it is expensive, but the alternative is a lot costlier to mankind (and cowkind). All the other meat and fish dishes are just incredible in their own way. I do not find the atmosphere here 'stuffy', per se, though you do read a lot about this as an issue in other reviews. Let me say that unlike a lot of downtown/River North eateries, you can actually have a conversation here. So if you are just not the type of person that has anything interesting to say, or if you are begging to tune out your dining companions, then you will hate this place.

I should have followed my instincts and turned around when I saw the restaurant 1/4 full on a Friday night at dinnertime, but my girlfriend and I were cold and hungry, so we decided to give it a shot anyway. First of all, the decor is ridiculously cheesy, and not in the cute, kitschy way. I get that it's called Prairie fire... but does that mean that there needs to be 10 prints of actual prairie fires surrounding me while I dine?

Really, don't walk in unless you're a post middle-aged white guy -- and I say that because we were literally the only females there not accompanied by men. Definitely not a gay friendly place, to say the least. My girlfriend ordered the chorizo pizza, which is a great idea in theory, but in reality just a small, pale, sticky imitation of a pizza with chorizo sparingly drizzled around it. Seriously, you can't even taste the chorizo. The saving grace was the sour cream plopped on top, but who wants to pay $10+ for bread and sour cream? (And calories, for that matter!)

2010-11-18,4.0,"Admittedly, I was not in the best mood when I walked into Prairie Fire today for lunch. You see, I had noted the address wrong ( I thought it was 115 N Clinton). This may not sound like a big deal, but I took a cab there and gave the driver the address. When we pulled up, it was a CVS Pharmacy. Obviously I realized I was not at the right place, but not knowing where to go, I got out of the cab. Then it occurred to me that it might be 115 South Clinton that I needed to go to, so I started walking there. Again, it wouldn't be a huge big deal if I hadn't recently relinquished my crutches and still walking very gingerly. Anyway, when I got to 115 S Clinton, it was a Panda Express. Now I'm crabby. I texted a friend for the address, but then duh, it finally dawned on me to call the restaurant. Turns out it was 215 N Clinton so now I had to hike another 4 blocks. Taking a cab wasn't going to work because Clinton is one-way going south and I would have had to go way out of my way. After all that, I arrived 10 minutes late and I detest being late more than just about anything, so I was crabby when I arrived to meet my ex. He jokingly asked for separate tables when he saw the look on my face, but I knew once I had some food in me, I'd be as good as new. The decor inside is sleek and modern, with lots of wood and ambient lighting. It had a lot of warmth. Naturally I looked at the menu ahead of time. When we sat down my ex asked me if I knew what I was having. Then he asked me if I knew what HE was having. This was funny because I always insist on ordering for both of us because I am very bossy when it comes to food and he still goes along with it. We (well, I) decided to order a mish mash of stuff: guacamole, spicy chicken wings, sweet potato fries, and a cobb salad. It was a random assortment but I wanted to try a bunch of stuff and those all sounded good. The guacamole came out first and it was a huge portion. The chips were fresh and warm and crispy; and the guac had a nice kick to it. The rest of the food followed and we dug in. The wings were good, but they weren't all that spicy and they could have been cooked just a touch more, but it's not like we were close to eating chicken sushi or anything. The sweet potato fries were out of this world. The cobb salad looked great, and was supposed to have come with dressing already on it, but when we started eating it, it was really dry. The server insisted that the dressing was indeed on it, but brought us more. We enjoyed the salad very much; it was fresh and had all of the traditional cobb salad components. Since Sarah Stegner (the chef/owner) restaurants are known for their pie, I wanted to save room. I was secretly relieved that the only pies they had that day were pumpkin and pecan. I no can do pecan and I'll be ODing on pumpkin next week, so we nixed getting dessert, which was just as well, and got coffee instead. Even their coffee was delicious, albeit very strong.

2010-11-17,4.0,"I wish Yelp allowed half stars because this would definitely be a 3.5 for me. However, since I had such a pleasant experience and didn't pay a dime for it (business dinner) I'll bump it to 4.  So I went here with a huge group - 10 of us - on a Monday evening and they treated us like rockstars. The hostess took our coats, let us sit at our table before our entire party arrived (although we didn't) and she and the entire waitstaff were nothing but pleasant and lovely for the entire meal. The decor is nice - it's nothing special, but it's big and quiet and sort of dark but not too dark. They have these semi-creepy flatscreens with the sun setting on them, which was a bit distracting, but sort of interesting. The wine was delicious and I really enjoyed a Cabernet, which is not my favorite type of wine. Again, the staff was really helpful on this front and made sure to be attentive to re-filling our wine and water glasses. Food was great - and I ate a LOT of it. Started off with apps to share - the smoked salmon pizza, shrimp spring rolls, and butternut squash ravioli. The latter was absolutely divine, something I'd usually think of at a much pricier place, very nice surprise. Then I had the roasted beet salad, which was the lowlight of the evening - three huge (like genetically engineered) pink slices of beet that must have been soaked in vinegar for days. Not so great. Fresh scottish salmon cooked rare with red kuri squash and glazed carrots - delicious.  For dessert I tried the sticky toffee date cake and to be honest I wasn't that impressed - the toffee/caramel sauce was great, but I did not see one piece of date, and it was just like an enormous cake. All in all, service and atmosphere is great and the food is pretty good for how it's priced, but I wouldn't run back here or insist on taking visitors here (my mark of a truly wonderful place).",0.9987,0.678,0.284,0.039,0.6437477954144619

The restaurant consist of a linear space going back in a somewhat narrow fashion from the smallish entry area spilling into a somewhat larger (but still smallish) bar area (with a few seats at the bar and a few high-top tables) and then spilling into a dining area.  The service was efficient (without being rushed) with water glasses filled right after we sat, orders taken shortly after that and with our food orders coming out of the kitchen not too long after that.  The menu consists of a limited (manageable) list of appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees and seems to have a stylish comfort food-type vibe.  There are a few items (e.g., banana pepper and cheese appetizer and bunless hamburger that are also found at the sibling restaurant in the northern suburbs, Prairie Grass).  The brisket sandwich (masquerading as an Italian beef sandwich) was very good (as were the french fries) and very filling.",0.7902,0.907,0.067,0.026,0.3782539682539683

Prairie Fire was a convenient choice and a great meal.  We showed up like a couple of blue hairs for a happy hour meal. My wife had a work event here once before, but it was my first time eating at PF. The restaurant is sleek and dimly lit with dark wood, booths and screens showing nature scenes. There was already a decent crowd and we were greeted promptly by our server who kept us nicely paced throughout the night. The menu was interesting and very reasonably priced with apps around $6 and entrees from the low teens topping out in the thirties. There was plenty to choose from and a lot of seasonal and local options. We started with the Baked Feta Cheese, Spicy Banana Peppers & Tomatoes and the Citrus Marinated Beet Salad, ""Capriole Farm"" Goat Cheese & Toasted Hazelnuts. Like an idiot, I dove right in to the bubbling crock of feta and singed the roof of my mouth. I don't know what I was thinking with that jackass move, but it was pretty tasty. The beets were a nice tangy cool down. We enjoyed both of our starters. For our entrees Kris had the Center Cut Ahi Tuna, Seared Rare, Baby Bok Choy, ""River Valley Ranch"" Shiitake Mushrooms in a Spicy Soy Sauce. I think she gets this type of preparation about every other time she gets Ahi. But, she really liked it and I thought it was very good too. I had the ""Mint Creek Farms"" Handcrafted Lamb Sausage Grilled Fall Vegetables, Crumbled Goat Cheese, Pine Nuts & Balsamic Reduction. This came with lentils and grilled pumpkin. Portions were very big and this was a lot of food. The sausage was well seasoned and the sides were a tasty compliment. I was very pleased. For dessert we wavered between the sticky toffee date cake (it was date night after all) and the pumpkin pie. In the end, we got a few coffees and the pumpkin pie. It was a generous slice and was quite good. Our server was quick and timely with refills and had us out the door with more than enough time to get to the Bard's classic tale of star crossed lovers.

2010-07-06,2.0,"Prairie Fire is a restaurant with promise that doesn't work yet. To be fair, my 2 stars was based on a late dinner (9:30 reservation) so they might have done better earlier in the evening. Food was standard American fare. My party found everything tasty and enjoyable, but nothing wowed in any way. Entrees had the unfortunate tendency of midwest restaurants to go a little heavy on the salt and grease when the meal couldn't present the flavors on its own. Note: A little heavy, not inedibly heavy (as some other midwest restaurants do). For this you do pay good prices -- figure a meal with a few drinks and desserts will run $140-180 for 4. I think the food has potential, but needs to be perfected. Given the reputation of Prairie Grass I would be willing to give another try in 6 more months, based on the food. However, other elements which should be ready at opening were not. Our waiter was uncomfortable and inexperienced. Although he may simply have been tired. The decor is a confusing mix of sterile elements -- cushioned booths, hardwood tables without tablecloths suggesting a sports bar in a restaurant presenting itself as fine dining. Office ceiling tiles look like a money saver. TVs showing nature scenes in the dining area? Ick. The design gets an F. This is by no means a bad restaurant, but the food in particular needs more thought. One major rave: The desserts are advertised as a strong point, and with justification. A piece of cherry cream pie was exceptional. Perhaps this is best used as a dessert spot after a sushi meal at Meiji.",0.8207,0.783,0.122,0.094,0.5386243386243386

Because we had a larger party, we were sat in the back room with built-in cabinets, boring art, and really large tables that took every iota out of having a conversation without having to yell.  Did I mention we had a flat screen TV directly in front of our table?  I could of used sunglasses.  I also could have been convinced that I was in the basement of a nice house out in Schaumburg instead of what could be a terrific urban loft space with sweeping windows in the Near West Side/West Loop.

2010-05-28,3.0,"I just went back for Sunday brunch and it seems much more popular than when I went the first couple of times. So much more popular that we, for the most part, were left to dine upon multiple servings of excuses and apologies--for delayed and forgotten services--instead of brunch fare. It took over an hour-and-a-half for us (a party of three) to be served coffee, one cocktail, and three entrees! And that's just to be served. It took nearly two hours of sitting there before we were able to sign the bill and hit the road. We had to ask repeatedly for things like:  another place setting, one more glass of water, (the table had been set for two and they were repeatedly remiss in accounting for the third person), butter, refills of water and coffee.  The first cocktail took twenty minutes to serve and I was never asked if I would like another one, yet the empty glass was never removed. In fact, the only receptacle removed while we sat there was a container of syrup that was taken by a a busboy--without asking--and put upon another table of diners! Every other glass, plate, creamer, piece of silverware, etc. just sat there. An awkwardly unappetizing grouping. The best example typifying our entire experience might be when the waiter hurriedly passed by, while seemingly scanning our glasses and plates, and asked if we needed anything while he maintained full stride. Without stopping he actually answered his own question with an abrupt, ""No."" He had rushed by so quickly that I didn't hear me trying to point out that all three of my beverages (water, coffee & cocktail) were empty. And others at my table were lacking, too!  His flury of pantomimed activities, in place of actual service, made it seem as if we were in a Monty Python skit sending up bad waiters. Maybe it was just an off day or maybe their staff can't handle a full brunch-time crowd. In either case, it was distasteful dining.  I am just thankful that I was with patient, conversant people. In conclusion, I'm only deducting one star hoping that this was just one helluva bad day for Prairie Fire's entire service staff.

Its a nice space everything is nice and new feeling and its quiet. Another thing I love is the lemon ricotta pancakes. They may be the best pancakes I have ever had. I know that's a bold statement, but they are really that good. I also tried the banana bread french toast, which was also amazing. My boyfriend had some sort of lox and cream cheese omelet that he raved about. The coffee is good, the bloody mary's are good, the smoothies are good.

I thought we were in for a treat until meeting the manager.  She was by far the rudest person I've ever seen at the front of a restaurant.  She even stole the brunch menus out of our hands as we were deciding what to order and proceeded to sit 3 tables that arrived well after us.   Although she tainted our meal and will likely cause us to never come back, the food was good. Scrambled eggs on potato skins, eggs benedict, and lemon ricotta pancakes were ordered. The potato skins came out without cheese, but our friendly waiter corrected the problem and apologized.  Everything was good, but nothing special. Oh, Phil Vettel, if these were the ""lightest, fluffiest pancakes"" you ever had then you need to get out more.

I was especially disappointed when I dined at Prairie Fire for the first time this week.  I had touted it to my colleagues as a sure winner with Sarah Stegner involved and so much of the foodstuff from the local market vendors, like Mint Creek Farms. The menu was strangely limited - two omelettes (?) and a crepes dish, two fish dishes, a skirt steak dish.  The sides were mostly mushrooms or a green like swiss chard.  Many dishes had cheese as an ingredient.  Frankly not one dish pn the menu had much appeal, description or ingredient wise.  So I ordered an app - the duck pate with liquor-soaked prunes and mustards with cornichon ~ two criticisms = one never serves pate without small pieces of French or other crusty bread or a selection of crackers.  I got nothing ...  and the duck pate was a large unadorned slab of meat with a bland appearance and flavor..   While my friends claimed to enjoy their meal, no one cleaned their plate.  The bread was pale and unremarkable.

The service was great I thought.  But the food, well, I've had better.  I split the blue cheese salad as an app - it was great.   I chose the moukassa for the entrée (I think that is how you spell it?) and was told our server that it is an ""often overlooked dish but a fantastic choice"".  That should have tipped me off to what was coming.  It was served in a terrine and the cheesy topping had a film on it.  I cut into it and I could smell the eggplant and potato - so of course I was excited to try it out.  The dish was beyond bland; almost a border line bad dish. My BF got the lamb sausage with white beans and loved it.  So I'm not saying the food there is terrible; I just made a bad choice.  I might add that the menu seemed a bit pricey for what was offered?  Maybe I'm just bitter now.

The next time I return for dinner, I'll write an update!  The first time we were there, we just wanted to check it out as it just opened and we live in the neighborhood. So we sat at the bar for drinks. My Nordic Nectar was very good-- it was one of those chick cocktails. The bartender was very friendly. We asked for the food menu just so we know what items they serve and he also told us about brunch and showed us the brunch menu.  The second time we went back there for brunch. If you're expecting a typical brunch menu where you have a million options of breakfast foods like at other brunch specialty places, then you may be disappointed here. Prairie Fire's brunch may not be as extensive as Yolk or Orange, but it doesn't need to be. Prairie Fire has an adequate variety of brunch items and they execute it well. I had the corned beef hash with eggs and my fiance had the open-face smoked salmon omelette. We liked our food alot and our server was also very polite and attentive.  We went back there this morning for brunch again. I had the Signature Benedict and it was absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge fan of eggs benedict in general because hollandaise is usually too rich and creamy for me but the roasted tomato hollandaise that came with the Signature Benedict was so good. Also, I'm generally not a huge fan of English muffins because alot of the ones I've had are always dry but the ones that came with my benedict was light, well toasted and yet soft to bite. My fiance had the Italian sausage sandwich and he loved that too. And now, let's talk about the lemon ricotta pancakes which we shared. OMG. They were divine. You can ACTUALLY taste the lemon in the pancakes. The pancakes were also extremely light and fluffy. I felt like I was eating lemon chiffon cake! Our server was also extremely upbeat and friendly.

I ordered the Moussaka.  I've never eaten this before, but I will go back just to have it again!  It was layered eggplant, potatoes, shredded pork and Bechamel sauce with crusted cheese on top.  My husband had the goat sausage served with roasted potato wedges.  This was simple dish, but not a dish to be overlooked.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  For some reason I was expecting it be be dry, but when I took my first bite I was pleasantly surprised. The casing slightly popped when cutting it or biting into it and the juices inside were apparent by sight and taste.   The service was a bit slow and seem unorganized.  It took 15 minutes before we received more bread to finish our pate. As soon as the bread arrived our entrees were set on the table 3 seconds later.  So we were a bit confused as why they would push entrees on us when we were clearly not done with our apps.

2010-02-22,3.0,"Having eaten at the Prairie Grass Cafe in Northbrook, I was happy to see Prairie Fire opening up in the old Powerhouse space.  We went on a Saturday night. The space is still similar to when it was Powerhouse (which I thought was a little IKEA like, and lacks the ""soul"" of a restaurant I would go back to often) but they have added a bar in the front. Know that unlike when the entire building was Powerhouse that the New Line bar next door is not associated with Prairie Fire.  We were seated immediately for our reservation and handed menus. There were several specials for the day as well as a specialty drink and wine menu.  We ordered the baked feta cheese and banana peppers to start. It was good and a nice compliment to our drinks. For our entrees- I had the ahi tuna, my one friend had the Tilapia and the other the short rib as they were out of the beef brisket. All of the entrees were good (not particularly notable, though) and the Tilapia entree was HUGE! Two big pieces of fish that she could not even make a dent on.  Know that each entree comes with some type of side (either vegetable or potato) but if you want both- you will need to order it off of the a la carte menu. Entrees are reasonably priced with dinner and drinks for three coming in around $140.  My biggest issue of the night was with the service. Our server was inexperienced and we had to flag him down several times. He didn't really know the menu and had difficulty answering our questions. The bus staff was more on their game in terms of helping us get replacement flatware, and more bread to go with our appetizer as our server was often no where to be found.  While Prairie Fire is, as the rating suggests ""A-OK"", my wish would be that it finds it's ""soul"". The space just feels sterile, almost like a suburban family restaurant feeling versus that special ambiance that encourages you to linger. It's the same issue I had with the old Powerhouse restaurant although I thought it would work better for Prairie Rain. The service level needs to come up as well but that could just be new restaurant growing pains.  This neighborhood could use a nice neighborhood place. Prairie Fire has some of the elements right.

I have never eaten at P G and was looking forward to what they claim to have - the best burger in Chicago. Well all I can say is that it was mediocre at best. I liked the ambiance, the service, the fries that came with the burger but the burger itself was not particularly good. The burger is large, covered with blue cheese and is served without a bun. The blue cheese makes it extremely salty. Pushing the blue cheese off, the burger had minimal taste - think of a piece of meatloaf which tastes better because there are often other additives to the meatloaf. For me, the better choice is to go next door to New Line which I think has a better burger.

Considering that almost the entire surrounding neighborhood now consists mainly of younger professionals in their 20's and 30's, Prairie Fire clearly missed the mark on their market by moving into this location. The food is OK but this would probably be one of the last places in the area I would take a date or go out to dinner with friends as a 20 something person living nearby. It's more suited for a group of middle age couples out to sample some good food, drink wine and talk politics or stock portfolios. While the ambiance can be forgiven (who knows...maybe this is the group they are targeting-which would clearly be a mistake considering the type of people that live around here and the sh*tty economy), clearly ignoring younger people on one of the first nights the restaurant is open is a serious mistake. We saw the owners, chefs, bartenders, hostess etc...chatting up virtually everyone in the place except us, as we were probably the youngest people around by a good 10-15 years. I'm not easily offended, but I figured that a half empty restaurant on its second night open would want to inform people about the menu, drinks, etc...to spread the word and keep people happy. But that wasn't the case: We didn't even have anyone ask if we liked our food (including our waiter!).... This can all maybe be chalked up to it being brand new but the owners and serving staff would be wise to treat everyone the same regardless if you are wearing a suit or jeans because news flash...some of the younger people who live and work in the neighborhood do appreciate a nice meal out every once in awhile (and sometimes even often)! That's why we live here, not so we can go to some restaurant and feel like we are in Northbrook. I was REALLY hoping not to walk into the Powerhouse when I went in (stuffy atmosphere that can only be described as ""not fun"" and unwelcoming), but that was the same feeling I got -- let's just hope it doesn't suffer the same fate (My gut reaction is that it might). It is possible to have a restaurant that caters to a younger crowd that likes good food as well as the more ""foodie"" crowd because tons of places in and around the area have accomplished that very same feat (actually just blocks away on Randolph Street). Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the direction this place is going in. Despite enjoying my food, 'disappointing' is the best word I can think of. It's like they plopped a north shore restaurant right smack in the middle of the city expecting it to thrive. Despite living steps away, I won't be back anytime soon...unless my grandparents are in town or something, want to pick up a check, and don't want to get into a cab. And even then, we'd probably go to New Line next door or walk over to Randolph street.  (The stars are only for the food, but lets be honest: there is a lot of other great food all over the neighborhood that would be a better bet if you're not a surburbanite out with a bunch of couples). EDIT: Also, don't order the ""cookies and ice cream"" for $9 but instead run over to 7-11 across the street and grab yourself one tiny scoop of Hagen Daas and a few hardened chocolate cookies because thats what it essentially is. Then congratulate yourself for not being a sucker.",0.9986,0.768,0.19,0.042,0.43788664292696555
2010-02-09,4.0,"Welcome Chef's Sarah and George to the neighborhood!  I stopped with my partner for an early dinner on Saturday evening, we were looking for a casual dinner and decided to sit at the bar and order. Adam the bartender was welcoming and offered some insight into the menu offerings, we ordered the BBQ braised brisket and the sirloin burger with a bleu cheese crust. We were not disappointed; you have to try the brisket! We found enough interesting menu offerings to place this establishment on our to-go list again.",0.8919,0.838,0.142,0.02,0.6361111111111111
2010-02-08,4.0,"YAY!!!  Prairie Fire is finally here!  I was so excited when I heard that the people behind Prairie Grass in Northbrook were opening a 2nd location just steps from my condo.  It took a while but tonight was the official opening.  I just happened to call and someone answered saying ""yes, we are open"" so off I went.  I shared a beet salad and one of my friends had the tortilla soup.  The soup was delicious.  Great flavor and just the right amount of heat.  The beet salad was good.  A little too tart but still enjoyable.  I ordered the Boneless Half Chicken Marinated In rosemary thyme and garlic.  It was pan-seared until crispy, served with roasted honey-glazed sweet potatoes and braised seasonal greens.  DELICIOUS!  I would order that again and again and again.  One of my friends ordered the parmesan crusted tilapia and the other ordered the burger which was voted #1 by Chicago Magazine.  We had to send it back three times because it was not cooked enough.  I have never seen that happen before...but I guess third times a charm and it was fine to eat when it came back.  Everyone was so apologetic bringing over 3 desserts to make up for it.  If you love chocolate then you will love the chocolate mousse and the double chocolate cake.  I am not a big chocolate lover so I moved those over and dug into the banana cream pie that was oh so wonderful. I am looking forward to many more dinners there.  It's definitely a huge addition to the neighborhood.  WELCOME PRAIRIE FIRE!!!",0.9976,0.71,0.259,0.032,0.5392460317460317
