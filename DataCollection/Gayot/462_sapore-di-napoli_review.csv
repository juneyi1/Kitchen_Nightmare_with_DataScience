I'm not the best person to tell you where to get the best ""Chicago-style"" pizza despite the fact that I've lived here all my life, but this pizza will make you feel fulfilled in life...it's that good. I've tried their pasta (the bolognese fettuccine was just decent) and gelato (Nutella is un-friggin-believable), but you don't go there for that stuff. My favorite is the margherita. The dough is thin and chewy with an amazingly brick-oven style crust (even though it's not a brick oven), the sauce is light yet flavorful, and the toppings taste fresh-from-the-garden. They don't overwhelm you with copious amounts of cheap cheeses, and you don't finish the meal feeling as if you've munched on a stick of butter. I hate few things more than a greasy crust. My heart truly skips a beat when I get the chance to eat here. Their prices are a bit high to make it your weeknight go-to, and there are just a handful of tables inside, meaning long waits to eat in, but find an off night to go or carry out, and you're sure to be happy you did. I might not know what ""Neopolitan"" style is or who people say has the best ""Chicago"" style...but this pizza is ridiculously good. That, I'm sure of.

2011-11-15,2.0,"I honestly don't know where to begin with this review.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy the food and liked that it's one of the few non-Asian cuisine BYOB restaurants that I know of in the city.   I'll first start with the service.  My boyfriend and I stopped in on a whim while walking up Southport with the intent to grab a quick dinner at Schoolyard.  I live one block away and remembered Sapore was BYOB so I suggested we grab a 6-pack at the corner store and grab a pizza thinking it would be quick and cheap.  There were only a few tables with people at them, and we sat right down.  The server (who I think was an owner/manager) brought us a bottle opener for our beers and left us to look at the menu.  For a good 10-15 minutes.  We had to flag her down to put in an order.  We ordered a salad and pizza, nothing overly fancy - it's not an overly fancy place!  We sat and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally our salad came.  We ate it (and it was delicious, though not big and not worth $14) and then waited.  And waited.  And waited for our pizza.   Now is where things got really interesting.  First, the music got loud.  Like yell across the table at my boyfriend so he could hear me loud.  Everyone in the restaurant kind of looked at each other and I'm sure assumed they would turn the volume down.  They didn't.  Then I noticed another patron having words with the server/owner/manager.  I couldn't hear what they were arguing about because it was so loud.  Later the same patron got up and got really into it with the server/owner/manager lady (apparently he had been waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting for his food as well).  While I couldn't really hear what he was saying, I heard every word she said - told him to not tell her how to run her business and once his pizza was finished to not return to Sapore.  I don't really think he was very friendly to her, but I was still astonished by how she treated him, especially when completely visible to every other person in the restaurant.  I have never had a more uncomfortable/awkward dining experience in my life.  Also, I know she was having a rough night, but the server never once asked us how our food was, smiled, anything.  And we were definitely overly friendly to her.   Our entire dining experience took close to 1.5 hours, which for a salad, pizza and a couple of beers on a Tuesday night is FAR too long in my book.  The salad and pizza was good, but overpriced AND we were charged $1 for a side of Parmesan.  I mean, what pizza place doesn't have Parmesan?!  Maybe it's not authentic Neapolitan, but come on!!   So needless to say, a $10 six pack and $45 dinner later I highly doubt we will be returning to Sapore di Napoli again.   **I will say that the chef singing and dancing to the overly loud (""baby making"" as my boyfriend put it) music was the highlight of the evening, and maybe their way of attempting to distract diners from how outlandishly long the food was taking.",0.98,0.895,0.077,0.028,0.5079170274170273

The third pie was overcooked again, with the crust being almost inedible. The cheese was nonexistent and there was way too much sauce.

The bathroom is located behind the kitchen which is weird but not a dealbreaker.  One thing I did not appreciate was the server rolling her eyes at my friend for requesting water.  She did not see me witness this and could have also cracked a smile at us during our dinner/birthday celebration.  BYOB with no corking fee is a plus.  Fun to look at the Italy pictures around the restaurant and guess where they're from.

Others have also noted the prices, but I didn't see anything out of line as compared to other spots.  The 'rita was $12.50 and the arucola was around $17 or so.  And it's BYOB!",0.9601,0.861,0.124,0.015,0.5927112135176651

We ordered the Salsiccia pizza and it was soooo good!  Super thin crust, tasty sauce, minimal cheese, and large chunks of fresh sausage-it was perfect.   We finished off the meal with some pistachio and strawberry chip gelato that was delicious and the perfect way to end the meal.  Reasonable prices and BYOB, you can't beat it, we will definitely be back!",0.9961,0.672,0.305,0.022,0.6468253968253969
2011-09-15,5.0,"I have been born and raised in Chicago and although I love my stuffed and deep dish pizza, Sapore de Napoli's Neopolitan style pizza ranks as one of the best pizzerias in my book. Yes, it's contradictory of me to love this thin crust pizza but I can't help but enjoy the thin chewy crust and fresh toppings. I'm not going to start with the argument between deep dish and thin crust. This is outstanding pizza whether you are from Chicago, New York, LA, or even Kathmandu. This is Neopolitan style pizza done right. In terms of recommendations, you have to go with the Margherita. The Margherita is simplicity as its best - fresh basil, tomato sauce, and mozzarella finished with a good olive oil. The Verdure is also another good choice since it has fresh roasted peppers and eggplant. There are other pizzas topped with Prosciutto di parma or parma cotto ham that are also worth ordering.  Surprisingly, Sapore de Napoli is also the restaurant that converted me to adding anchovies to pizza. The anchovies that they use on the Napoletana have the right saltiness without the fishy after taste. If you never had anchovies on a pizza before, this is the right place to try it for the first time at.  Sapore de Napoli gets packed quickly, especially because of the number of regulars that go so frequently. I would recommend calling in advance for reservations or ordering to go. If you order to go, I wouldn't wait until you get home to eat the pizza. This is a pizza that you should eat immediately. Once you taste it, you'll know what I'm talking about.

It was pretty good and the marinara was delicious as one would expect at a pizza joint.   We ordered 2 pizzas for 3 people: the Salsiccia and the Pizza Bianco.  The crust and overall flavors were very good.  What disappointed me so much was that the toppings were very sparse.  For an average $17 per pizza, the toppings best be delicious and plentiful.  On a side note, I did see a pizza that looked like the same as ours on table next to us....but with double the toppings.  Perhaps my experience was the result of a freak inconsistency, but I felt ripped off.    Our service was pretty decent overall, and the atmosphere was cozy.  It is a bit odd that you walk through the heart of the kitchen to use the bathroom, but rent is expensive in Chicago, right?!",0.9941,0.758,0.203,0.04,0.5075700280112044

To the drunk hyena woman next to us, cackling and laughing hysterically every five seconds as if she's caught her reflection in a fun house mirror--please, please, for the mental sake of all those around you--lay off the wine. This 40-something single woman with deeply stained purple teeth, moving on after this dinner with two of her friends to meet some random 46-year old divorcee man at Coobah that she really, really liked was bullhorning her evening's plans between wine chugs and snort-filled laughs. Oh yes, I almost forgot, she also announced that next year she's be wearing a t-shirt for St. Patrick's Day saying ""half gaelic, half garlic"" -- because she's ""Irish and Italian--get it?"" The final topper of the evening is when she stopped a man picking up a pizza and actually tried to pick him up by saying, ""Don't I know you from somewhere? What's your name? And your last name?""

I am wondering if my taste buds are off because sadly I wasn't wow'd by anything here which is surprising since it is BYOB. In case you didn't know BYOB makes all food taste better. Don't get me wrong everything was good but I just don't see myself running back, you know down the block. It is quite small which is frustrating to me since that means there is really no extra room to stand while you are waiting for your table, no one likes people hovering over them while they try to dine! We got the Calamari Fritti which was quite honestly some of the biggest chucks of calamari I have eaten and the batter had a slight hint of pepper that was quite delicious. It was served with a marinara sauce that sadly didn't do anything for the dish. I wanted to try the Salsiccia e Cipolle with smoked mozzarella but unfortunately my dining partner does not like sausage, looks like its time for me to make some new friend eh? We ended up with the Cotto e Funghi: Tomato sauce, oregano, Fior di Latte, and mushrooms, topped with Parma cotto ham. The crust was good as was the pizza overall tough the mushrooms somehow lacked flavor. I can't believe I am saying this but Target has some Archer Farms pizzas that I pop in my oven pretty much every Sunday afternoon that are honestly comparable to these. Okay yes I know that a frozen pizza can't be compared to the fresh ingredients offered here but hey they are really good ! I heard they have good gelato so we saved room for dessert, though I don't know how because between me and my gal pal we ate the entire pizza.

I love knocking elbows with fellow diners fighting over every last square inch of valuable space in these close quarters (except the one time I had some dude's ass 6 inches from my face but I digress). Add some levity and bring some wine (if you forget there is a liquor store right at the corner), the staff does a great job of keeping the happy juice flowing throughout the meal. The wait, while not long, is always a killer as you can't help but fixate on everyone else devouring their meal. When the perfectly crisp crust and fresh toppings arrive the question is not how awesome it will taste but how much will find its way into my face.

My friend and I got to Sapore at around 5pm. Early. Old people early. We were the only ones there at the time. We were seated and served by what I presume is the owner or at least manager. Incredibly nice guy. He uncorked the wine we brought (oh, did I not mention that this place is BYOB yet?) and put in our bruschetta order. After we ate that up, we asked the owner's opinion on pizzas. We ended up with the cotto e funghi, a pizza with cheese, mushroom and ham. Unfortunately only half the pizza had ham though, as I was eating with a vegetarian.  The pizza was delicious. It's a very thin, Italian-style pizza. A lot of flavor to it. Luckily I had I was guaranteed at least half of the pizza because it was tained with delicious pig flesh, but I also had a slice of her side as well. In the end, that pizza was long gone. As the evening wore on, the wine got lower and lower and the small restaurant filled with more and more people. I babbled on about my recent trip to Africa until the owner finally stopped me and told us about the gelato for dessert. Now, never go to a restaurant thinking I'm going to get a dessert, but the wine must have lubed me up a bit, because both got a bowl. He had a lot of different flavors, so I just asked him to pick for me. He came back with a vanilla/raspberry mix. This guy is a pro, let me tell you. Very, very good.

This was one of the most flavorful and enjoyable meals I have had in quite a while. And, it's BYOB! That means, you won't have to go into hock to pay for all the deliciousness you're shoveling into your mouth. A few things. Make reservations. It's small. Like, as you crane your neck to see who's got the dragon breath that you smell wafting over your table and forcing you to go nose-deep into your food because, really, who's got breath that bad? Wait. What was I saying? Oh yeah. Small. As you look around, you'll only have to do so once because you're seeing everything there is. There are a few tables and the ones that are there are positioned close to one another. If you're of a larger bodytype, it may be uncomfortable. Bring patience. Small kitchen. Few waitstaff. This ain't Mickey D's. You will wait. Come with friends. Tell stories. Drink wine. Shut up. Wear stretchypants. Because you will have, at least, three courses (and an entire bottle of wine, if you're awesome). Since you're not paying for booze, throw caution and your wallet to the wind and live a little. Forget that you're eating meat and cheese. It's fancy-ish Italian food from the northern part of the country. Those folks eat that kinda food every day and they live to be 106 and walk up hills with boulders strapped to their backs. It's healthy. Ish.  I started with the prosciutto and mozzarella salad. It was heavenly. The salty pig combined perfectly with the creamy cow juice and when served over balsamic kissed greens? Magnifico! Molto Sexy! Cutting into the salad, I made sure to combine all three flavor profiles in every bite so as to maximize my ecstasy. Pizza was anchovy, fior de latte (fancy cheese), oregano, tomato sauce, and wood-fired awesomesauce. The Neopolitan pizzas are quite easy to take down by a single person and the secondary combo of salty and sweet gave me a DiVinyls moment. I ended the meal with gelato. DO THIS. Going for the salty-sweet trifecta, I had the chocolate caramel AND pistachio gelati. Together. And, after I finished, I rubbed my dead-sexy belly and shook my jelly. I would spend the next week wearing a garbage bag in a sauna but it was worth it.  It was SO worth it.",0.9646,0.884,0.084,0.031,0.498106575963719

The quality of their ingredients strikes me with every bite I take.  They've had a pesto pizza on special each time I've been, and the crisp crust with slices of rich, aged Parmesan reggiano atop each piece.  Despite my better judgment I've finished the pizza both times I've ordered it, even with sampling the pasta and pizzas my dining companions order.

Started with the Mediterranean Salad-nothing special but fresh greens and tasty feta-satisfied.  My husband and I shared 2 pizzas(12"" is only size offered,cut into 8 slices)-  Rosemary & Potato Pizza-popular in Italy but not a combination you see too often in the states.Very tasty.  Margharita- the classic pizza with tangy,slightly chunky sauce- good.  We thought the crust had good flavor and loved that even though this pizza is thin, it's still thick enough to be chewy!!!! We hate cracker like crispy pizza.  We had half a pizza leftover...Ended the night with gelato-not bad but not the reason you should come here...for that go to Paciugo!  Pistachio- pretty good.  Stratiacella-good b/c the little chips are small enough to melt quickly and uniformly throughout.  Burnt Caramel-Had ice chips it and it shouldn't have.  Almond Brittle-lackluster flavors-just tasted overly sweet with little almond flavor.  Service was good-only 1 waitress-but she does a good job caring for her tables. Owner was there and seemed very hands on, cleaning tables, delivering the bill, answering the phone, etc.  .  Overall a solid place to get chewy, not too crisp, thin Neapolitan style pizza made with high quality, fresh ingredients.

Next, the pizza is flawless Italian style pizza.  The crust is crispy and light.  The sauce had the right tang.  Finally, the cheese is milky and contrasts so well with the sauce. Though, you need to eat it fast - while its hot.  It is not as good when it cools.  One note - because the oven is so hot - the pizza cooks real fast and comes out quick. So, you have good wine that you brought a real good pizza.  So, far a good meal.  Then, BOOM, dessert just takes it over the top.  The homemade gelato - I cannot overpraise it enough.  Let me put it this way - I never split an order - and I always lick the bowl.  I do not care who is around or looking.  The fiore di latte is so creamy.  I always get it.  Then, any other flavor will be awesome - the hazlenut, the mint chip, the coconut - anything will be good.

It is always a pleasant surprise to walk blindly into a restaurant and have it turn out to be a warm, friendly, and quality establishment.  Sometimes to the point where it can make you overly biased in favor of the place.  So I waited a couple days to review Sapore di Napoli, because otherwise this would have been a 4-star review. As it is 3 stars still feels a touch low.  3.25 or even 3.5 would seem fitting for this place.  The lady who was running the place was very friendly, took care of us quickly and efficiently without making us feel rushed, and the atmosphere was convivial.   We ordered a Salsiccia pizza and it was perfectly cromulent.  Really enjoyed the crust, and the sauce had a tart sweetness to it that was different than most pizza in the city.  The Coke came in glass bottles, the way God intended it.  In retrospect the pizza was just above average, but at that moment it tasted amazing because I was cold and hungry. Dessert was good.  Another diner loudly and enthusiastically urged us to try the Nutella gelato, which we did along with a Mint gelato.  Both of them were nice if not amazing. I feel almost bad not saying better things about such a nice place.  If I lived near there, I would eat there a LOT.  If I were younger and going to shows at Schuba's regularly I would eat there a LOT.  Next time I go to a show there I will almost certainly go back for dinner.  This isn't a destination restaurant, but for those folks living nearby, you're missing out if you don't go here on a regular basis.",0.9901,0.804,0.156,0.04,0.494022869022869

The gelato was quite tasty, however we didn't realize the price of them until we got our bill: they were $7 each, which was a bit outrageous for one scoop of gelato, being homemade or not.

WHOOSH... I was off to Napoli for a couple of hours.   The interior of Sapore reminded me of a quaint pizzeria you would find in an Italian city.  In this vein, to go to the bathroom, you walk behind the gelato counter and say hi to people working in the back - OK, it's not quite the Copacabana scene from Goodfellas, but it's still a pretty cool vibe.  My date and I knew what we were there for: Pizza Margherita... no BS.  When going to a pizzeria for the first time, it's important to go standard so you can judge the quality of sauce, cheese, and crust on its own - unadulterated by other toppings.  The pizza was so delicious, an ideal BALANCE of ingredients, the crust finished nearly perfectly.  Just how it should be. If you've been to Napoli, then you know what I mean.  If you haven't, let me just say: try it, it's how pizza is supposed to be.  I would love an 'Nduja option on the menu!  I know it's Calabrese, but it's gaining popularity in Italy and you can now find 'Nduja options on menus all over the peninsula.  The only annoyance was a group of frat boy types who polished off significant amounts of beer and wine in a two hour period.  The place was very loud while they were there and my hot date and I had difficulty talking at times.  But loud restaurants seem to be the norm in Chicago.  This is an aspect of dining out in Chicago I am still not fully accustomed to after living in Manhattan for several years and spending 6 months in Italy.",0.9957,0.805,0.165,0.029,0.6168849206349206

2009-05-04,2.0,"This place is really close to my house, so it's hard to stay away. First, I'd like to say that the food is really tasty.  I love the arugula pizza with prosciutto.  It's delicious.  And they have actually improved the ingredient ratios on the pizzas.  But $20 for a single serving pizza?   My daughter had the penne with bolognese.  She liked it very much.  But $15 for a plate of noodles with meat sauce?  And here's the worst part.... on top of charging $15 for that plate of noodles with meat sauce, they charged an additional $2 for parmesan cheese.  It was a little dish (really little) with the tiniest little spoon.  It was really cute.  And I'm positive it was freshly grated.   But c'mon, I have never been charged for parmesan cheese in my entire life!  (And when they asked her if she wanted cheese, they made no mention of the charge... I just happen to look at my bill) I also ordered a small gelato for my daughter.  Two flavors, and the portion was really tiny... and it was served in a big styrofoam container.  I don't think the gelato price ($3.50) was out of the ballpark.... but give us a little more (there were literally four bites there) and don't make us dig down into the bottom of a large container. So... Sunday night dinner with my five year old.  We ordered one pizza, one pasta (WITH CHEESE don't forget) and one small gelato.  I'd like to point out that we ordered no apps, no salads and we drank water.   Total, including tax and tip:  $55 Maybe I'm just cheap, but that's crazy for a neighborhood place at Belmont and Southport.   So, four stars for the food, zero stars for charging for parmesan cheese... averages to two stars.",0.5497,0.878,0.067,0.055,0.5028129218451799

I was a little concerned for such a small place, but it was fine. The service was fine, and I thought our pizzas came out pretty quickly. I know some comments say it takes a while, but maybe because it wasn't very crowded they were quick to serve us. I was with one other person and we each decided to try our own pizza. I thought the prices were maybe a *tad* high, but overall for our entire dinner it seemed pretty affordable. I had the margherita, which was great, and my friend had a white pizza that had truffle oil and prosciutto on it. Mine was yummy and they liked theirs a lot too.

The upside was that they held our bottles of wine that we brought while they encouraged us to go across the street for drinks at Schuba's. They took our cell phone number and called us when our table was ready, which was cool.  We had the antipasto tray for an appetizer. The artichoke was great! A few of us shared pizzas for our entrees. I had the eggplant and zuchini pizza. Pretty good, great crust. For desert we had the gelato- pistachio to be exact. It was excellent.

2009-04-01,4.0,"Went here with my dinner club girls on a Friday night. It's a small place (about 15ish tables I'd say) but we got there around 7 and had no problems getting a table for 5. It filled up by about 730-8 o'clock though so I'd recommend getting there by 7 if you are starving and don't want to wait. However, with that said, I did notice that a couple of parties of 6-7 people came in during the 2+ hours we dined there and they didn't have to wait that long to get seated. Plus, they do have a little area with a bar/counter type deal where you can easily stand and have a drink while you wait. So don't let the small space deter you from coming on a Friday or Saturday!! Now to the food. Between the 5 of us we shared: - the caprese salad - OMG so delicious. I love love love me some caprese salads but what makes a good one is the quality of the mozzarella and it was top notch here. I wish I had gotten a whole order for myself but alas I only got a taste because I had to share, reluctantly. - bruschetta - it was good but not mind blowing. Although I'm not sure bruschetta ever is IMO. It did have a healthy dose of garlic on it so I give it 2 thumbs up since I am of the opinion you can never have to much garlic! Pizzas: - Funghi - pretty traditional with tomato sauce, mushrooms & mozzarella. It was good, not spectacular. The sauce could have used a bit more seasoning but I did like the abundance of mushrooms.  - Quattro Formaggi - this is a white pizza with about 4 different kinds of white cheeses on it. One word - fantastic. Not to many places do white pizza's or do them well maybe is more appropriate, but this one was superb. Another thing I was sad to have to share! - Arucola - another white pizza with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and a very thinly shaved parmasean cheese on top. I only had a small taste but it was very good. One of my dinner companions raved about it though. I think this was her favorite of the 3.  So, long post in short, I will absolutely be going back.

The waitstaff couldn't have been friendlier, but unfortunately they just couldn't save the whole experience.  The 5 of us each ordered something different, so 4 pizzas and one calzone.  We ended up waiting nearly an hour for our food to arrive.  The pizza and calzone combinations, though delicious, were about as filling as one of those 99-cent frozen pizzas from the grocery store, at about 15 times the cost.  The place got overly crowded real quick which was annoying, and I think they may have lost potential customers just because they couldn't fit them anywhere.   So yeah, worth a try, but I would advise getting food to go, and ordering a pizza per person.

(Ask Tiger Woods).  The appetizers are plentiful and I thought the salads delicious.  I've tried several of the pizzas, but opt for the Quattro Formaggi (cholesterol be damned!) as the cheeses are outstanding.  I've also sampled several other items on the changing menu and have particularly enjoyed the pastas.  Yes, they're known for the pizza, however their pasta is very, very good.  Expect a wait if arriving after 7:30.  I've never had pick up as we would rather sit, visit, dine, talk, relax and leave our cell phones off.  The owners are more than hospitable; going out of their way to make certain your party has a great experience.  This is the type of neighborhood place you hope lasts for years.  If you're not too high maintenance to mind a wobbly table, paper napkins and a bustling nearby kitchen and absolutely love authentic, fantastic Italian food, then this is the place for you.   Best of luck!",0.9972,0.696,0.298,0.006,0.48730158730158735

2007-08-26,2.0,"2 stars is being generous to this place.  The calamari was decent, but portions were tiny, and not worth $8.  Two of us shared the Quattro Stagioni pizza, which in theory sounded deliious: with artichokes, olives, mushrooms and prosciuttto.  Not only did it take way too long to come out, the crust was charred (read: black) on one side.  Still, I was hopeful, and excited to eat the pizza.  Visually speaking, the four ingredients were divided into four separate sections of the pie, and I was disappointed. The dough was tasteless/bland, and cheese was the same. I normally like prosciutto, but theirs was so-so... and all the other ingredients (artichokes and olives) were not fresh (probably canned).  We then tried the gelato (we got pistachio) -- it tasted a little minty and little like green tea, and it was half melted when the server brought it out.  Gelato on Halsted (Cafe Gelateria) is 10x better, and I'm never coming back to Sapore di Napoli.

2007-07-24,4.0,When this place is open it's great. Just call ahead because I am not totally sure of their hours. The bruschetta is fresh and garlic covered-you couldn't ask for more. The verdure pizza-my favorite. We also tried a special with mushrooms and white sauce-also filled with garlic and really good. The most important part after the great pizza is of course the gelato! My friend had mint chocolate chip and loved it-I'll take her word on it because I hate mint and therefore wouldn't try it. I had chocolate chip which came pretty close to the stuff I used to eat in Italy and if you have had that you know what I'm talking about.

2007-06-23,5.0,"Took the wife to dinner here on Thursday night. The teeny storefront was packed with geezers making their cicada mating buzz. The busboy vaguely suggested we might have a seat soon; a lil two-topper beckoned but one chair had already been geezer-jacked. A couple vacated their perch at the 3-stool granite bar so we parked it there, believing we'd have a table soon. Seating status remained a little vague for the next few minutes until il maestro dressed the busboy and hostess down in front of us for not letting us know when we'd be served. My wife was a little appalled at watching the discipline being meted out but I reminded her of what happens in Anthony Bourdain's book Kitchen Confidential. I think culinary genius needs heat, pressure and pain. And ever since the last episode of the Sopranos, naked aggression has been missing in my life. So I enjoyed the show. Anyway the skip let us know it'd be longer than 15 minutes until we were served. Hostess knew the specials well. I ordered a special pie with cheese, porcini mushroom, prosciutto strips and truffle oil (sigh.) Wife ordered verdure (veg) pizza with red sauce. zzz. We ducked out to buy a $6.99 bottle of pinot grigio at southport liquors (:15 secs walk, at southport and belmont.) We could see the pies being made like six feet in front of us, but without the fired hearth it's just not that interesting. Anyway the prep area is tidy and efficient and the high-tech ovens are stacked in an impressively compact fashion but for me, surprisingly, sitting near the oven at D.O.C. is a little more interesting. Know what? Doesn't really matter here! When they expand they'll probably add some more glam and drama in the kitchen for you ppl that need the whole experience. My pie was flawless. Confirmed, no soggy bay of naples in the center, didn't really miss it. Loved the crust. I ate half and took half in a box as we were racing an 8pm curtain at Chicago and Halsted. I didn't taste my wife's verdure but she liked it. Her remaining half joined mine in the box and we were out the door in time for the curtain. Nice job! The room had emptied out by the end of our meal and younger cuter couples started drifting in. Less din, more gentle romantic murmuring. Wish I could have stayed for gelato! They closed at 11pm but we were unable to make it back that night. Some other time! Two pies, two house salads + corkage came to $50 which I thought was a bit pricey. I overtipped, according to my wife and the server, who came back with a ""really?"" when I said to keep the change. Guess I was in a great mood because the food was so delicious, and they seemed to be suffering a little to keep things on track that night. Upshot. . .great pizza. . .cute + teeny room = stressy when packed, cozy when not packed.

However, I wasn't extremely impressed with the pizza.  Yes, I've spent lots of time in Italy so I'm not a typical Chicagoan that bases my opinion on pizza off of Gino's East.   Aside from being overpriced, the pizzas that we got here were overcooked -- dough was too tough and not light and chewy the way Naples-style pizza should be.  We ordered the antipasti special appetizer and it was $12 for a few slices of meat and some cheese.... yikes.  Had we known the price we wouldn't have gotten the special.   We didn't try the gelato, mostly because of the price -- $5!  Yowzas.   Anyway, staff is outstanding, food ok but overpriced, who knows if we just got a bad batch of pizzas, I would maybe try this place again.",0.4853,0.879,0.074,0.047,0.5039915966386554

The calamari fritti serving was a bit small for the price.  I can get a decent sized portion of reasonably good calamari at Pompei for an affordable price.  The pizza we ordered was ok.  Nothing extremely fascinating, plus I think it was a bit burnt, and the cook tried to hide it by chipping off the burnt edges before having it served to us. The place is owned and runned by a really nice and friendly couple.  Had a small chat with the lady owner.   Will make it a point to go back again now that they've had a few months to run the place and see how it's changed/improved.",0.9497,0.883,0.107,0.01,0.5133333333333333

After a fashion a few folks came in to place to-go orders...and then just as we were getting through, the place started to fill up nicely. And that's what I want to see...BODIES IN THE CHAIRS.

Just light, crisp, but the calamari was still wonderfully tender! And the sauce kicks ass too! We then had the Verdure Pizza...and it was terrific!  Roasted veggies atop the light and sweet pizza sauce...with just enough cheese to taste. If you're looking for Pizza more like they do it in Italy, you can't go wrong with this place.   And the owners are really nice people.  They were so conversational, and fun...and the gelato was the perfect capper for our meal.
