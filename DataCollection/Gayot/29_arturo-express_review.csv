I've tried a few different things from Arturos. I've tried their buffalo chicken pizza, which was super good. Not too greasy, good buffalo flavor, and a nice amount of chicken on the pizza. I've had their broccoli cheddar soup, which is my favorite. Super creamy, super flavorful. I've also had their Caprese sandwhich which is also very good and very filling. Their portions are pretty large for the price. I usually walk out of Arturos only spending under $10 which is an accomplishment for being lunch in the Loop. Overall, I really enjoy eating at Arturos.

2012-02-15,2.0,"I had the Turano today, their ""muffalato"" [sic], which I have to say was one of the most disappointing sandwich experiences I've ever had.  It was advertised (both written on their board and as displayed in their sample case) as being on tomato focaccia with an enticing chopped olive mix and promised to be very tasty.  Ten minutes after my order (not much Express in Arturo's Express), it arrived instead on a plain sub roll with a measly few sliced black olives and was... meh. Regardless of whether you're a fine dining establishment, an express lunch counter or a fast food restaurant, if you're out of critical ingredients to one of your featured items you either 86 that item or, at the very least, tell your customers what you're missing and  warn them that the item will not arrive as advertised.  Taking their order and their money and then handing them something other than what they ordered is not the way to do business. Although I was taking my item to go, I did notice that the bread was not right (it was a sub roll instead of the round focaccia I expected).  Upon asking the manager/owner? about the focaccia, he fessed up to being out and offered to make a different sandwich.  When I complained about not having the time, he did give me a card for a free lunch on them (the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1).  If it had just been the bread, I would have withheld judgement this time and let this slide without a negative review.  However, when I got back to my office and realized that the olives mix had been replaced by sliced black olives with no warning, I had to post. If I'm able to bring myself to try them again, I'll be sure to ask if all ingredients are available before placing my order.",-0.6903,0.895,0.041,0.065,0.46375283446712023

I told him I heard about Arturo's Chicken Pesto on Yelp, and he actually gave me a taste of the Pesto Pasta to go with my sandwich... Okay, let's get to the nitty gritty :: Their Chicken Pesto is awesome because the chicken itself is pulled (think chicken salad style) and mixed with the pesto sauce rather than it simply having pesto sauce on top of a chicken breast. This really brings the flavor home and makes all the other pesto sandwich makers look stingy. The bread is nicely toasted and the roasted peppers are the perfect accent.

Back to my original order - I had been craving a tomato, mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich since moving to Chicago (from NY) early this year but didn't know where there was an Italian deli in the neighborhood (I stumbled upon this one).  When I went in to order ANY ITALIAN DELI STAPLE, I was told they don't have prosciutto!  Really?  An ""authentic, old world Italian style delicatessen"" (so described on their website) that doesn't carry prosciutto?  Yikes.

First, the lettuce is freshity-fresh-fresh.  No wilted greens here.  Second, the chicken is seasoned with lots of fresh herbs and plainly grilled.  Third, the smattering of tortellini (not too many noodles, which is nice for the calorie counters in the house) filled with cheese provide just the right amount of silkiness.  And last, the dressing.  OMFG.  I swear, it's laced with crack or heroin.  That good.

2010-06-11,4.0,"When setting foot back on United States soil after my recent European trip, they didn't ask me at Customs if I had anything to declare.  But if they had, I would have stated proudly, ""I now hate Italian food!"" Now it's not for the reason that might come to mind.  Having real Italian food in Italy did not sour me on the Americanized version.  Quite the opposite.  The complete lack of flavor in every pasta that I got (the original Italian style pizza lived up to the hype) overseas made me crave the underly ingredianted, overly spiced, overly oiled, tomato pasty goodness of cheap American spaghetti (and mostacholli and gnocchi and, well, I think the point is made).   The thing is, they seem to think in Italy that Italian-American food is worse than it actually is; and, therefore, they can get away with anything in the big cities.  They're wrong.  There are even Italian delis that serve good food around here!   One is close to the food wasteland that surrounds my workplace. The first meal I had when I got back to work, therefore, to wash away the bad memories of Italian cuisine was this oasis of cheap ""Italian"" - Arturo Express.  Their pasta sauce is basically something out of a can.  But, darn, it's bene!  For $4.75 (I mean, that's only four Euro, try finding that in Italy) they slather a large ladle of the stuff over a huge plate of noodles and give you a cheap American roll to boot (they charge for the bread in Italy, the nerve).  Plus, and I know this is a given here but I have to say it anyway - they have FREE water WITH ICE!  And on Thursdays, the whole thing that would make an Italian faint but me cheer is buy one get one free (with or without meatballs). Not to say that I think all Italian food is pasta.  I tried some actual panini while I was over there as well.  And, let me tell you, give me Arturo's fake Italian-style subs over most authentic Italian sandwich any time.  The tomatoes and cheeses may taste better in the mother country, but Arturo piles their lesser Yankee cousins on sandwiches thick and tasty. And the best part is, picky eaters get to speak to them in English!  Would I seek out Arturo's on holiday?  No.  But, hey, if I were touristing at the Willis Tour, they would definitely be worth a lunch-sized vacation across the street.",0.9863,0.848,0.113,0.039,0.38859329446064145

It was a big sandwich, too - no sides needed here! We returned today, but alas, the pesto chicken is just that - a special.  Instead, I gave the pasta with broccoli and chicken a go.  It had a little red pepper kick that I wasn't expecting, but I enjoyed it.  And two very enthusiastic thumbs up for the Italian wedding soup I had on the side - so very good.   There isn't much to be enthusiastic about on this side of the river, but Arturo is a lone bright spot in the sea of chain restaurants.  Yum.

I have some faves but leave at a 3 star for the minimal healthy options (salads are pasta or meat- heavy with few veggies) and a smidge pricier than I'd like to pay for what I get.  BUT if I want to dare spend the afternoon at my cube fighting a food coma, I'll try their spinach lasagna. They do have a truly awesome marinara. And that's even with Venice Cafe just a 1/2 block away...  Most offerings include some kind of meat but I will from time to time indulge in the napoli sandwich (pesto, fresh mozzarella, roasted red pepper, basil- toasted) and back in my more carnivorous days, I enjoyed a chicken salad sandwich (or salad) that was mighty tasty (with black olives in the mix).

Now, you ask yourself, in the fatitude of this era, why do you want to eat pasta?  Well, at some point in your life, if you realize you should eat normal portions, no sugared soda (unsweetened tea or diet soda), and exercise, you CAN eat good food and save the 100 calorie can/box/tub/packet/bar for a nuclear winter event.  The tweet on that is,"" YOU make yourself fat.  Not the lunch, the clothes, or the stripes."" The sandwiches (chicken caesar, italian sub, hot and cold, etc), salads, pasta (lasagna, tortellini, pesto), all have good normal portions which taste excellent.  The other day I had the buffalo chicken hot sandwich - be still my harden heart.  It was loaded with chicken and had just perfectly toasted cheese on top on a crisp, not stale, italian roll.   So go in, get food, and don't eat the damn candybar in your desk.  Drink some water and walk around and you can eat here without thinking,""Will this lunch make me fat?""   Yeah, if you eat ten of them.",0.971,0.867,0.123,0.01,0.505982905982906
