I was glad they opened a full restaurant and was excited to try it out since they closed their small location. Menu is pretty much the same and service was real slow. We visited on a Friday night and they were not at all busy. There were only a few tables with customers. Our server was really nice but gosh awful slow. We only ordered two salads and it took forever and we had to get the hostess and ask her where our server was. The servers and hostess spent the night huddling at the door just talking away while I only saw one real server in the whole restaurant. The food was good, not much of a difference from their small location. I don't think I'll be coming back for a sit down dinner, I will be getting takeout from now on.

2017-07-15,5.0,"This is my first yelp review of a restaurant, ever.  I Live in California and I was visiting family in Chicago this week. I have worked in restaurants my entire life and I know when something special is happening. Blue Door Farm Stand is one of those places. I was just walking by and the lovely scent coming from inside grabbed my attention. I walked down Halsted and peeked into a few other establishments and I could not stop thinking about Blue Door. I went quickly back and sat at the counter/bar and I felt like family, right away, with Heidi, Tommy and Alana.  My lunch was memorable, to say the least. I had the Red Beet appetizer with some sort of tasty sauce underneath (I was thinking, maybe homemade Greek yogurt). It was amazing. I had their Seared Ahi Main Dish and I must say, it blew me away. I fish for Tuna regularly  and this tasted like I caught it off my boat and ate it on the spot. It was accompanied with the crunchiest/freshest green beans, cherry tomatoes and veggies imaginable, with a delicious green sauce. I also, felt like the portions were large, for the price. Considering the Lincoln Park location, it hits a home run. The decor is an architects triumph of: lighting, color and use of space. After my visit, I text all my relatives in the Chicago area and the Chef of my restaurant in California, to tell them of my experience. The Blue Door was on my mind all day/night after my first visit so, I went back again the next day for lunch and another go. Boy, was I happy again. For my second visit, I had the any 1/2 petite Salad(Kale and Brussels) with a cup of their Lentil soup. I must say, it was off the charts good, again. The 1/2 salad portion is surprisingly big and the lentil soup was delicious. They have great coffee (ask Heidi, I had like 4 cups) and their wine/beer selections are fantastic and hip/current. So, please take it from a life restaurant guy, support Blue Door Farm Stand and they can become a Chicago iconic place.",0.9944,0.853,0.147,0.0,0.4000423958757292

Once they sat me down someone approached my table and offered me water. I told him it wasn't necessary since I wouldn't be drinking it. About 7mins went by and someone tried to pour me water again, I explained t wasn't necessary- he then asked if there was someone else he was able to get me. I asked for an Arnold palmer easy ice. He told me he will get it to me shortly. About what felt like 10 mins later, he came back with my drink and asked to take my order. I asked for his suggests on salad and I went with it.  I ordered a hummus appetizer and then half sandwich and salad. I asked for hummus to come first and then my main shortly after.  It was a working lunch so I didn't mind the long wait time...for a hummus, something that gets plated with no preparation time.  It was alright, nothing special. When I saw how long it took to bring out, I spotted my waitlist and told him that he can put my meal through so it can come out whenever it's ready. Without hesitation he went and brought it. That simply told me it wasn't spaced out and everything was ordered together. My Ava sandwich was cold, it was good, but I'm sure it would have been better if it was hot.  The Brussel/Kale salad was delicious! I was very impressed with my main meal.  During the duration of my meal I received 3 Arnold palmers- each time only taking 3 sips per glass since it was all ice.  Once the check arrives I notice I was charged for 3 drinks. I was confused since refills are typically provided, there are only additional charges if served in a bottle.  When I pointed that out to the waiter his response is ""everything was correct, we brew our own tea so there is an additional charge"". Gotcha!  I will most likely be back since he food was great!

I wouldn't have minded the boring presentation or even the portion size if it had been tasty. It was watery and had a funny off taste -- like refrigerator, I'm not sure. But it was unappetizing and I should have sent it back.  The fruit plate was pretty. There were two strawberries on it that looked like they came from a farm and they were tasty.

One employee was short with me when I inquired about their cooking oil, and finally told me they use crisco olive oil. I was very patient and nice the whole time there, btw.... despite their irritated, rude attitude toward me. They made me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed for even asking about their food and ingredients, which is not good customer service... When my to-go order was ready (thinking it was prepared w/ 100% olive oil), I asked the person who handed it to me about the cooking oil, just to double-check, and he also was rude to me. He said ""we don't cook with olive oil...."" Turns out they cook with GMO canola oil. Didn't even get to eat my meal. So disappointed with this place. From reading about it online beforehand, I thought they had very high standards for all of their ingredients, since they do use some local produce and dairy.

It's a very rustic feeling inside, wood tables, homely bathrooms,  big bottles of glass water. The only problem with this place is the heat. It was like 15 degrees warmer in here than it was outside and it was 65 degrees out. Their kitchen gives off a lot of heat, and I left smelling like a kitchen, even 1 day later my coat still smells. Oh well. #worth.  Also for dessert we got the carrot cake and split it 3 ways. It was amazing, can't go wrong, and it's all MASSIVE, so you definitely need to split it multiple ways.",0.9869,0.748,0.189,0.063,0.49126984126984125

The sandwiches are pretty good, but I ordered one with a coffee and ended up paying $18--whaaaaa?

After ordering, we waited a bit but luckily snagged two seats at the bar top, in front of all the sandwich-making. I like the idea of the communal table they have there, but probably not for me. Space overall was very inviting. I got the tuna sandwich while bf had the gouda and ham. We also split an apple pie and bacon sammie. Sandwiches took a tad long to come. Since we were close to all the action, we saw some confusion amongst the servers, so that was unpleasant. We finally get our orders and they messed up boo's sandwich. However, the lady was nice and offered to box that one up, as she gave us the correct order, so we got a free sandwich. I enjoyed the tuna and everything tasted fresh. I like that it was a little different and had some string beans in there. The ham & gouda was pretty good too, as with the butternut squash soup.

I live around the corner and eat here all the time. Recently, there have been a couple of situations that literally, don't make sense to me. First of all, do not order soup as your entree at this place. Especially not to go. I ordered soup to go, which was 8 dollars, and received my small container of soup without bread. I asked if it came with bread and the manager said that it did not, that that is just something they have never done. I asked if it was possible to get some bread with my soup. He asked me if I wanted multigrain toast or a crostini. I said crostini, and he then asked me for $2.21. I literally thought he was joking. What kind of place charges 8 dollars for a bowl of soup and doesn't give you bread, crackers OR a spoon??? Offensive. I told him not to worry about it but that they should consider serving bread with their soup, LIKE EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT IN AMERICA, and he says, ""Ok, thanks, have a good day!"" Another time I ordered their most recent sandwich special, the avocado grilled cheese with tomatillo jam. It arrived, sans tomatillo jam. I asked one of the employees if I could have it on the side since it was missing on my sandwich. The same manager as the first incident came over and says, ""Oh, we ran out of tomatillo jam 45 minutes ago!"" I said, ""Ok, but it kind of makes the sandwich. What you gave me is just a few slices of avocado and 2 pieces of mild cheese? I'm pretty sure the reason the sandwich is interesting is because of the jam."" and he said ""Yes, it's too bad."" Clearly sensing I found this offensive, I HAD TO ASK if I could get something else instead. He asked me what I wanted and then replaced it. He apologized only when he brought the other sandwich, and very quickly. Another patron at a different table leaned over and goes ""That guy is an asshole.""  You can eat here, because the food is great, but GOD FORBID you have a problem or ask for anything additional or you will be made to feel like you are SO demanding. For a place with such high prices, you expect a little customer service.

I came in for lunch with a friend and ordered the kale and brussel sprout salad with a cup of the soup of the day. The soup was amazing: fennel, sweet potato and chicken. The salad looked great but was very bitter. It could have used more dressing or seasoning to combat the bitterness of the kale and sprouts.  My soup and salad combination cost $10, which I thought was a fair price considering the quality of ingredients. I also considered purchasing one of the cold pressed juices until I saw that they cost the same as my entire meal: $9.50!

Long version: We stopped by on a Saturday at 6pm and it was fairly empty so we thought we were at the wrong place but people began showing up after we ordered and sat down (you order at the cashier and they give you these cute little blocks with your number on it). The place was so cute with this rustic farm vintage feel. My fiancé and I ordered the grown up grilled cheese, cauliflower soup, the Brussels and kale salad, and the kale and artichoke dip. The grown up grilled cheese was the best grilled cheese I've ever had. It wasn't too heavy on the cheese and it was sweet which I thought would be weird but was amazing!! The cauliflower soup wasn't overly salty like some soups can be and it had a ton of flavor. The salad was good but didn't blow my mind- the dressing was what made it really good. Places like these can be hit or miss i.e. the atmosphere is great but the food is bad or vice versa, but this place really had good food. We spoke to the manager Chauncey (sp?) on the way out and learned that they had opened Feb of 2014 and that they always change their menus with the season and the food. We will definitely be back!

2014-08-09,3.0,"Blue Door Farm Stand was bustling when I went for lunch on a Saturday. But with ample seating and plenty of staff, there was no worries of not having a seat. I decided to try one of the grilled cheese sandwiches, a sandwich I don't often eat. I went with the ""Grown Up,"" which had gruyere, havarti, and swiss, plus basil and tomatoes and a rosemary honey. The sandwich was OK, really only OK, despite the terrific array of cheeses and bread from Red Hen Bread. The only flavors I really could taste were of the herbs, and the single, small piece of tomato was very flat. It's tomato season, and this is a farm-to-table themed place; how did I get a listless tomato?? Completing the nostalgic lunch, I got a cup of the tomato bisque. The soup was quite tasty. Lots of flavor, a bit of spice, and a terrific creamy consistency. I wouldn't have minded it being a little thicker, so that it stuck better to the bread of my sandwich. But the flavor profile made up for the light density, and I scraped out every last drop. The cafe itself has a bunch of other fun things to try: pastries, cheeses, meats, juices, coffee, and so on. I did not have any of those things today, though I will note with approval that they had Nordic Creamery butters and cheeses--a terrific brand. I think if I had time to go back before I left the city, I'd try a coffee, a salad, and a different full sandwich. I still trust that the meats and vegetables are fresh and high quality, I just was less than thrilled with my particular sandwich.

Produce is key at Blue Door - they take pride in many of their locally produced and delivered fruits and vegetables. In the salad alone, you can taste the quality. My sandwich blew my mind. Who would have though brushing the bread with rosemary honey would be so delicious? It was a sweet and salty combination to die for, a sandwich I'd honestly kill to replicate.

The Good: Breakfast Wraps--perfect size, incredibly fresh, and satisfies my cravings for a sinfully delicious egg, cheese, and bacon breakfast while wrapped in wheat so I can feel like I'm only eating 200 calories.   Chicken Salad--literally to die for.   Considering the raving compliments I always hear from fellow diners, the rest of the menu items are probably just as delicious. The Quirky: The décor is exactly what you would expect from a café named The Blue Door Farm Stand (TBDFS) nestled between the many high-end shops on Armitage Avenue--cute and rustic.  The menu is simple, relatively affordable, and seems to feature farm-fresh ingredients.  At the same time, it definitely caters to the people (women?) who can afford to shop up and down the Armitage/Halsted area.  I wouldn't consider this a bad thing, but there are certain things that they do that just do not seem to fit (see below). The Frustrating: Breakfast Wraps--I found out the hard way that they stop serving breakfast at 10:30 a.m.  I work second shift, and was soooo excited when this place opened up around the corner because there is a serious lack of breakfast food in this area.  After this initial disappointment, I continued to try to get my hands on one of those delicious wraps, once running in at 10:31 a.m., another time calling at 10:29 a.m., but both times I was completely turned down.  Seriously, are you a cute, fresh, and classy café on Armitage Ave., or are you a McDonalds drive-thru??  Definitely not a McDonalds, because a McDonalds employee would at least offer some french fries.  The staff at TBDFS will just give you a look that says ""Sorry! You're SOL"".  They lose a star for this. Aesthetics--While I appreciate the rustic theme, wooden tabletops can get really icky if they are not properly wiped down.  I moved away from a honey-laden table only to find ones with crumbs stuck in the crevices.  I brushed away the crumbs with a tissue I had in my purse (TIP: napkins and silverware must be picked up at the bar by the cream & sugar--they will NOT bring you any).  I'm pretty sure the bussers watched me do this, but they never came to wipe it off (again, is this McDonads??).  On a related note, the staff is extremely friendly, but not always as helpful as I wish they would be--I came here 3 times before I found the napkins.  I wish I could only dock a half star, but because some of the functionality aspects of this restaurant really bother me, I'll have to take a star.  Conclusion: All in all, this place is great and you should give it a shot.  I was really hoping that this would be a place that I could work into my daily routine, as the price is reasonable for an area lacking in cafés, but the logistics of TBDFS make it function better as an occasional stop rather than a regular treat.",0.9935,0.773,0.154,0.073,0.5236997321674742
2014-06-04,3.0,"Came by for dinner tonight; here's what I can tell, based on the clientele, the other reviews, and the chalkboard:  if you are a small female, or a male with a small appetite, and no matter what your gender you support the fresh/free-range/organic/natural market, then I think you are gonna love Blue Door.  Lots of great salad options, a few different sandwich/wrap options, cheese board selections and a wide range of desserts that appear to be made in-house.  There's a big space in the back plus the small seating area upfront, so lots of room...there's even a Goddess and the Grocer-style shop to buy items if you are on the run. I tried the Grown-Up grilled cheese sandwich...and that's my main criticism of Blue Door.  For $8, I got a pretty average grilled cheese sandwich, on some pretty tasty bread (Red Hen provides the bread, according to the menu) with something that added a little something special, which I learned later was a rosemary honey on the cheese.  The other ingredients were tasty but not mind-blowing.  But the SIZE of the sandwich was a joke.  I wish I was kidding about this, but after I had my sandwich and a bag of chips, I went to Brothers Beef nearby to pick up an italian beef.  I would say the Grown-Up was basically appetizer-size for a dish in Chicago. Now, again--if you are smaller, or come in not that hungry, OR come in for lunch (probably the best way to experience Blue Door, since they close early for dinner anyway), I think you'll be fine.  Just don't bring your 6'4"", 230-pound former linebacker friend to Blue Door, as he will probably leave hungry, or angry, or hangry.",0.9716,0.849,0.119,0.032,0.3506493506493507

Every single employee was friendly and helpful which made it an even more pleasant place to dine at.  Only complaint is that it closes at 8:00 pm which makes it hard for those who eat late dinners.  They were really nice and let my friend and I stay and chat while they were cleaning, so we didn't feel like we were getting ""kicked out"" because they were closing:)  Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a casual place to grab a bite to eat and want some healthier and fresher options.",0.9808,0.733,0.22,0.048,0.6339726631393299

I had the half portion brussels sprout and kale salad and half a ham and gouda sandwich.  The salad was delicious, I love shaved brussels sprouts, and there was a good proportion of sprouts, kale, nuts, and cheese.  The sandwich was perfectly fine, I just preferred the salad much more than the sandwich, so I would recommend getting a whole salad instead.  T he only thing that was frustrating was that I had to wait for silverware for quite awhile because it is self serve, and Blue Door wasn't keeping up with demand, so as soon as they put a few sets out, diners were grabbing them quickly and I had to wait multiple ""rounds"" of silverware being set out.  It sounds like this restaurant is fairly new, so I'm sure this will be sorted out soon.

I do wish Blue Door had some more breakfast options, but we ended up going with lunch. The restaurant is located in a very convenient spot on Armitage in an old house. The interior is decorated so well, like straight from Pinterest. They even have a map in the back outlining where all of their food comes from which is so cool! Sunny and I ordered at the counter and sat down to wait for our food. I have one complaint and reason for my deduction of a star. We waiting a reeeeeeally long time for two sandwiches. I think they might still be working out the kinks and not have enough runners, but we were both feeling very impatient by the time our food finally arrived. Blue Door's menu has a plethora of very appealing sounding items. While we waited, we saw large, colorful salads going by, and hearty-smelling soups. Sunny and I decided to share the turkey/cheddar sandwich on multigrain and the chicken salad. The turkey was fresh and the sandwich was melty and so tasty! The cheddar was tangy as well as the preserves on top. The chicken salad sandwich was even better. The chicken salad itself was smokey and phenomenal! I can't wait go to back and have this again. Both of our sandwiches came with huge kale chips that had some parmesan sprinkled on top, such a nice touch!  Overall, I can't wait to come back to Blue Door. The interior is really pleasant and their menu is full of locally sourced items that sound fantastic. Definitely recommend as a lunch option in the area!",0.9962,0.759,0.213,0.027,0.4829554043839758

I had soup and petit salad, my friend had a sandwich. It was the best sandwich he'd had.  There are 2 issues I can point out.  A minor one--the menu boards are on three walls. The food board is behind the counter, the drink board is closer to the entrance on the opposite wall, the soup board is at the end of the counter on a different wall.  The more annoying issue is you leave smelling like smoked bacon and the grill. They need a better exhaust system. I've experienced this at other cafes in Chicago.
