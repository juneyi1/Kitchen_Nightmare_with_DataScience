Their sushi meat was so BLAH and not marinaded/seasoned.  If it was, you wouldn't be able to tell. Their other entrees are just mediocre.  I had also their tuna tartare, and while the sauce was what saved the dish, that's always something to be WARY about when eating fish. It usually means the fish itself isn't that great.  Which was true.  Without the sauce, the fish was on the verge of getting old.  It wasn't fresh AT ALL.  Yes, it tasted fishy, which is a terrible quality for raw fish to taste like (means it's not fresh). So this is a rant, more because it's already closed.  But I'm glad it did, and I'm sharing my experiences.",0.9012,0.799,0.118,0.084,0.5110931174089067

One thing to note: this restaurant is closing!  They have a new chief, Jackie Shen who's from Chicago Cut!  The new restaurant will be called ARGENT they say it's ""a modern American approach to dining inspired by the past.""  I don't really know what that means but I'd be interested in trying it!   I'm really hoping they keep a good majority of items that are on their current menu especially the cookies!  I would come back just for those!

She said, ""Oh, let me go and check to see if your table is ready!"". She walks over to a table IN PLAIN VIEW of us and places two tables TOGETHER! There was no one sitting there since we had arrived. I believe she made us wait at the bar because this was the restaurant's ploy to have us and other client's start purchasing drinks at the bar before dinner! Needless to say, we were not only very hungry, but very insulted that they lied to us!  That was just the beginning - our server took half an hour to come to our table to take our orders and when our main entrees came they were EXTREMELY salty and not hot/warm at all. Another thing, we ordered the scallops and cauliflower appetizer and there were only 3 scallops in the whole dishi! What a rip off!

The ambiance is beautiful, modern and clean - and surprisingly empty. We sat upstairs by the sushi bar and had a beautiful view of State Street.

To start we went appetizer crazy - goat cheese squares at the waiter's suggestion (FANTASTIC!). I live and die by the rule that you always try the waiter's first suggestion as long as it's not price driven. The crab cakes and curried mussels were also delicious - i loved the coconut curry sauce with the mussels, not something you see often.  For a main course we split the dumplings - woah. Think gnocci in an awesome cream sauce - and did a ""pick 5"" of the sides for only $10.

For the entree course, I went with sushi, the Maguro Roll (blue fin tuna, shrimp tempura, creamy crab salad, avocado, and unagi sauce), and it was honestly some of the best sushi I've ever had. My wife had the Roasted Pheasant (in a coconut milk soup with lemon verbena, straw and shimeiji mushrooms). This was her first pheasant experience and this dish is her new favorite comfort food. This dish is perfectly crafted, every element complimented the rest so well. This is a chef's masterpiece! The bird itself was well executed. The coconut was so calming and all the tiny mushrooms were fun to eat. It had been such a great experience, we couldn't help but order dessert. I am SO GLAD we did.

Or how I've never even CONSIDERED using truffle butter on my own potatoes! And the free range chicken? Cooked to perfection. Juicy, flavorful, and doused in a wonderful slightly spicy, slightly garlicky sauce. Could've done without the skin, but that's easy enough to remove and it kept the juices intact. And on the topic of ""how have I never even thought of this,"" LETTUCE CUPS? Brilliant! I loved the chicken and herb blend they brought out, loved it even more when I squeezed some lime on it and plopped a mint leaf on top, and am forever grateful that the lettuce used was fresh, green butter lettuce instead of grody iceberg. To quote Jessica S. on the sushi, ""was not even close to the freshness and flavor that I would want an $18 roll to have."" My compadre got the Power Roll and, while she said it tasted good and she'd order it again, but there wasn't high quality to match the high price. And how could I forget the cocktail made just for me?! I told the waiter I wanted something with blueberries and lemon or lemongrass, who passed the news onto the bartender, who created me a custom cocktail with lemongrass syrup made onsite and liquor he had just gotten in from the distributor that day. The man clearly has a passion for his mixology trade, as he came out once I'd had a chance to take a few sips and asked how he did. The flowers floating in the cocktail were a supremely nice touch. Finally, way to go, Aja, for having a kickass foursquare discount.

I went on a Monday night and it was pretty dead inside which was shocking for a location right downtown. People need to go to Aja! It really is quite good! Plus the sous chef is super hot! :) We just did drinks, apps and desserts and everything we tried was fantastic. I started with the Blueberry drink which our super friendly server brought out to us. It was very strong and didn't hold anything back in the hard liquor department. For apps, we tried the rock shrimp, crab rangoon and dumplings. All three items were really good but the rock shrimp was a standout, Had a little kick to them and an interesting sauce I didn't quite recognize on them. Very tasty! The star of our meal show was definitely the Aja oreo dessert. I don't normally like white chocolate but the white chocolate mousse in this is fantastic and the cookies are to die for!

2011-09-11,3.0,"I had never heard of Aja until a few weeks ago; apparently, it's the sleek Asian-fusion restaurant in the lobby of the Dana Hotel. But thanks to yet another farewell dinner, I was able to visit and check this place out. Our table began with two crispy prawns wrapped in potato threads with ponzu and pea sprouts and mussels with coconut curry, fresh squeezed lime and garlic cilantro butter. We also split the ""aja spare ribs"" per our waitress's recommendation, and these were some delicious pork spare ribs that were falling off the bone tender, smothered in a rich hoisin barbeque that was less a spicy glaze and more a sauce that evoked thoughts of mole. We also got to try the hamachi guacamole with avocado-lime salsa, barrel aged soy. The taro chips accompanying this were light and refreshing and the crispiness provided a nice contrast to the ""guacamole"", making it a cohesive dish. I have to say that the ""Jade Garden"" wasn't quite a pearl. The cooked onion, mushy rice and cashew sauce made for a very unpleasant texture, like...savory mochi, and not in a good way. I'm glad to see they took it off the menu. Overall, the food was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. And in a sea of restaurants that are constantly innovating and doing just that, Aja gets sort of lost in the mix. Especially at the price point. But the ambiance is nice and the service is pretty attentive, so it definitely has that going for it.

The sushi menu offered a range of options, not like many other places that have an incredibly extensive sushi list, with 50% of the rolls having 95% of the same ingredients. The hamachi jalapeno roll was not too spicy, and the sauce and garnish on top really completed the flavor profile.  The Power Roll did not disappoint.  The maki pieces were also not gargantuan, like can be seen lately at many places.  I highly recommend both rolls. The seared sea bass is a good dish for one, or to share (with accompanying sides or sushi).  The sauce was a pretty strong sweet soy sauce, and the diced bok choy on top was a little crispy, and helpful to soup up the sauce. Cocktails were great too! The Blackberry, and the Sangria were excellent, and comparably priced amongst other restaurants of the same likeness.

Then we had the lettuce cups, which were nicely put together with an array of bibb lettuce, a bowl of well seasoned sauteed chicken and shiitake mushrooms with garlic and ginger, and served with lime and mint leaves.  This was probably the best item we got. For an entree, I had the ramen noodles.  I was working really hard to appreciate the ""aged soy"", but mostly what I got were some overly salty noodles served over a plate of flash sauteed broccoli and red/green peppers.  Definitely skip this dish.  My fiancee had the barbecued salmon, which was well cooked but pretty heavily covered in BBQ sauce and the delicate fish was totally overpowered.  The chinese mustard greens were a pretty neat novelty though.  Overall I just felt that the meal did not come close to delivering on its price tag, and the service was slow despite the restaurant being moderately empty.  The decor is in line with the Dana Hotel though... at least you have some fun walls to look at while you eat?

It was free-range chicken with a ""Korean garlic sauce,"" potatoes and carrots.  I put the Korean garlic sauce in quotes because being Korean myself, this sauce, was definitely everything but.  Everything was swimming in this sauce; the chicken itself was horribly dry and while the potatoes and carrots were tender, everything tasted of the garlic sauce, which was more peppery than it did taste of garlic.  The presentation of the dish itself was quite unappetizing--it was just chicken, potatoes and carrots covered in a bright orange/red sauce. A couple of friends ordered sizzling hot oil suzuki which I was able to get a bite of.  It is sea bass cooked with greens and ginger and I horribly regret not getting this dish.  The sea bass was pan seared to perfection and the greens and ginger added so much flavor to the dish. The service itself was HORRIBLE; it took him about 10-15 minutes to bring our drinks and when we asked for something, it took him another 10-15 minutes.   Luckily for him, we were a group of 8 and gratuity had been added to our bill.  The only good thing about this meal was the complementary dessert which were sandwich cookies which had a cream center between two thin chocolate cookies.  But they even managed to screw that up...we only were served 6 before our server came (10 minutes after they had initially been served) to send us another 2.

But unfortunately this has turned out to be a mistake. Aja that I experienced during Gility City dinner a few months ago was not the same aja that I experienced over this weekend. Firstly, food was ""alright"". The highlights were hamachi gucamole and the strugeon. Sushi was not the best sushi in town, honestly. We also had Salmon, which was not even worth mentioning.  We ordered mango cocktails and they were excellent. Kudos to bartender for that. And secondly, Service...tsk tsk tsk... Service at aja is possibly THE WORST SERVICE EVER since I have moved to Chicago five years ago. Our waitress, Karisa Or Kristen seemed like a sweet girl but I am not sure if she was interested in giving us  good service. One of my friends was very particular ( almost very picky) of unfamiliar ingredients and whenever we asked the waitress what's in this or that dish, she replied "" I am kind of new so let me go check with the chef"". And I am not sure if she forgot or just didn't care enough to actually find out what we asked, we found ourselves still waiting fifteen minutes later. At one point, we just decided to forget about our questions and just order. She came back later and asked ""Are you ladies ready?"" as nothing happened. We decided just to go on with our meal and forget about it. One thing that pissed me off the most was that the restaurant WAS NOT even that busy!!! Our waitress was just standing at the podium as we waited for our answers!!!A few seconds later we started receiving food that we didn't order. But somebody else came back , took it off our table and placed it on the table next to us-a very very awkward moment.   Another down pointer was when I asked a bus boy who brought our entrees for a new silverware, he pointed at another bus boy and said ""ask him"". Just two words : ""ask him"" and walked away. At that point we were like ""WOW"". To make it worse, our waitress never really came back and check throughout the meal until we flagged her down for the bill. No managers to be found anywhere to address the issue either. It really was an awful experience overall. We could not wait to leave the restaurant. Aja needs to definitely step up the game considering there are hundreds of other good places to go in downtown area.

They should only seat one large party in the upstairs.  As for the food, while my red chile ramen was good, it wasn't worth 18 or 23...so I wanted it with chicken instead of shitakes. The waiter said no problem, and my order was placed. Our bill came and we notice an item just listed as $5.00 and guessed that was my chicken. I would have been ok with this, but the kung pao chicken was $18, the sesame chicken was $18, and the red chile ramen (vegetarian initially) was $18. I can't warrant the $5 price tag for a few pieces of chicken, and furthermore not being told there would be an added cost. Sorry, but that isn't good service (and more on that in a minute). Overall my entree was just so so. It was literally ramen, and I can definitely make at home, for $4. The rest of the entrees were good, but definitely not worth the price tag. I'd rather go to Roy's which is much better, and right down the street. The food is average Asian, and you can find it at any other Asian restaurant in Chicago.

Too bad the food was mediocre at best. 25 dollars for an entree? 13 dollars for a cocktail? You better wow me. Cause' sweetheart we are in Chicago I can get a damn good hotdog for 4.  But I digress. We did a couple appetizers and mixed and matched a couple rolls and entrees split between three people. 200 dollars? say wha?  The hiamachi  guacamole was interesting. But it needed something, more seasoning, more acidity? something.  The rolls? Holy  cilantro batman, why on earth would anyone douse cilantro all over a beautiful piece of fish?(Plus in light of the radioactive water spewing in the ocean of japan, maybe advertising your fish is from japan right now not the best move, I hope I didn't eat radioactive fish O.o) Terriyaki chicken entree was 25+ dollars and I've made better at home ( I am a pretty damn good cook)  What a waste.

2011-04-06,3.0,"What's good about dining with family is that I get to try more food in one visit!  I came here just last weekend for my mom and niece's birthdays.  We reserved a deal online that allowed us to order off of a fixed menu at a fixed rate per person.  The fixed menu really just eliminated some of the higher priced appetizers and entrees but we were still left with quality choices. For the appetizers I was able to try the Aja Spare Ribs, Clay Pot Mussels, Chicken and Pine Nut Wraps, Hamachi Jalapeno Roll, and the Spicy Tuna Roll.  I just noticed that I named everything in the order I would rank them in!  The ribs were super tender and the mussels were full of flavor mainly from the coconut curry it was made with.  The lettuce wraps and the sushi rolls were good but nothing special. The main courses I tried were the Barbecued Salmon, the Charred Rare Tuna, and the Korean BBQ Hanger Steak.  My mom and sister had the Sizzling Hot Oil Suzuki (Sea Bass) but I failed to try it.  Based on their responses, the fish seemed good but they weren't happy about the greens it came with.  They were expecting some decent veggies but rather it was just lettuce of some sort. The Barbecued Salmon had a nice caramelized glaze to it which made it taste a little sweet.  My dad had the Korean BBQ Hanger Steak.  The sauce on top was great but the steak itself was overcooked which made the meat very tough.  My dad had them take it back and just re-ordered the oh-so-tender ribs he had earlier.  I would have done the same.  It was the best dish I tried all night. I personally ordered the Charred Rare Tuna but wasn't completely satisfied.  I think I had the notion that it would be like sashimi.  The char and the rare don't go together at all.  It basically just ruined the texture of the fish for me.  The best part of my dish was the truffle whipped potatoes it came with. For dessert I tried the Aja Oreo Cookies and the Spring Roll which were basically egg rolls filled with caramel apple cheesecake, fried and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Both definitely made up for my unsatisfying Tuna. To drink, I had the Sake Sangria which consisted of Sake and Sangria (duh) muddled with lychees, cherries, and oranges.  It didn't seem like a strong drink but it did creep up on me a bit! For a trendy and upscale restaurant, I don't think the service was up to par with its image.  The service was good but I had higher expectations. A good family dinner, nonetheless.",0.9904,0.827,0.123,0.05,0.5598214285714286

So delicious. The sushi bar on the 2nd floor looked amazing, but we were too tied up with the speed dating to be able to order any. I would love to go back and try their food though.

2011-03-03,3.0,"Aja is a restaurant that racks up a high bill very quickly.  So instead of a full-review of every aspect of our meal, here are some highlights that will have you spending your money on food that is actually worth it. Drinks: Unfortunately, all of the drinks we tried we're bad.  I have given up drinking Caipirinha's at any non-Brazilian restaurant.  Aja's Blackberry Caipirinha tastes exactly like Mastro's version: cough-syrupy. Their beer selection is mainly Japanese as well, so if that is your style, you may be OK. Appetizers: Worth Your Money Firecracker Spring Rolls - Very tasty (and I hate spring rolls) and fried to a perfect crisp.  The mustard dipping sauce is decent, but only apply a little of it because the flavor is really strong and can dilute the spring roll. Hamachi Guacamole - I know what you're thinking....another version of guacamole, and this is from an Asian restaurant so how good could it possibly be? Trust me, it's good.  I've had guacamole plenty of guac from all around the city (Carnivale and Zocalo are my favorites) and Aja's take on it is just as memorable.  It is served in a giant bowl but the guac itself is shaped like a rectangle and topped with yellow hamachi.  I don't know how raw fish on top makes it good, but it does!  And the taro chips they serve with it are the best ever. Not Worth Your Money Tender Greens - Lame, tasteless salad that only a dieting super-model could love. 18 Vegetable Salad - $12 for a random assortment of vegetables thrown on to a plate and doused in dressing is a pure waste.  Save the money for a side dish. Entrees: Worth Your Money Charred Rare Tuna - Phenomenal! Tuna is a hard thing to do correctly, and all you ahi tuna lovers out there who constantly suffer disappointment are in for a treat if you order this menu gem.  Perfectly rare tuna with the smallest sear on the edges lays on top of truffle whipped mashed potatoes (more on those later) and come with a yuzu chimichurri sauce that I could literally drink.  I would have licked the plate clean if their weren't women at my table with me. Korean BBQ Hangar Steak - If you love korean bbq flavors, you will enjoy this.  The steak is cooked to order, but the chefs seem to cook it one notch below whatever you request, so don't say I didn't warn you.  The marinade on the steak is what makes it memorable.  The tempura sweet potatoes that accompany the steak are horrible (more later on these too) so substitute them with the truffle whipped mashed potatoes and email me a thank you letter after. Not Worth Your Money Sesame Chicken - Way too much sauce and way too overcooked.  You could buy a version from your local grocery store and it would taste better. Sizzling Hot Oil Suzuki - When you think of sea bass, you think of a the plump, juicy filet that every restaurant serves.  At Aja, they still haven't gotten the memo that people like it that way.  Their version is pounded thin and without the oil it is soaked in would have no flavor at all. Desserts: Worth Your Money Cookies - The menu says cookies, but you actually get three whoopie pies.  Two chocolate cookies form around a sweet butter-cream/whipped cream filling.  Order this for a table of three and everyone will leave satisfied and not stuffed. Pineapple Cake - If you want to go out with a bang (both taste-wise and ensuring your pants will feel like they are about to burst), then please order this dessert.  Aja's version of this classic dessert comes with two pineapple upside down cake squares soaked in a caramel sauce and served with a giant scoop of dulce de leche ice cream on the side.  The cake itself is moist and the brown sugar crust on the bottom is fantastic.  Just try to avoid eating the entire thing...I tried and failed. Shaved Ice - Aja gives you a sample at the beginning of your meal (sort of like a palette cleanser) so make sure eat it all because once your food order is placed, the shaved ice magically disappears.",0.9984,0.769,0.175,0.056,0.5449907599907599

2011-02-23,2.0,"I am hangin between a 1 and a  2 and a 3 (Or I am just counting)...oh and the name of that place is Aa-ja, like saying Asia really fast. It's not Ah-ja or Ah-ha, although that second one was a great one hit wonder...just like some of the food/service here. I'll explain. Hope the name is correct...if not, blame our server.  Came here with friends for Restaurant week and I was pretty excited about the menu, especially that shaved ice slushie. No cold weather can deter this little lady from anything with the words ""shaved ice"".  The decor is shnazzy, simple, and chic. We sat near the fireplace in the back, which made the place seem a little warmer. The main dining room is on the entrance floor and the lounge/private rooms/bathrooms/Dana hotel front desk is on the second.  Before we ordered, we were served a refresher: a lemongrass granita. Very refreshing indeed, and fairly addictive.  Anyway, so we ordered the 18 vegetable salad and firecracker rolls for apps. Both were fairly good, the salad sure had a variety of veggies, although I didn't  make sure all 18  veggies were accounted for. Good crunch and dressing made the salad fun to eat. The firecracker rolls were pretty standard rolls with a ""kick up yo nose"" wasabi dip. So far, so good...service was on que, friendly, and helpful.  For the main courses, our party choose sesame chicken, korean bbq hangar steak and sizzling hot oil suzuki (sea bass flash fried).  The sesame chicken was lackluster, but the serving size was good. It was run of the mill stir fried chicken, and no crunch. The bbq steak was well marinated, but as our party ordered it medium rare,  the meat was on the well done side. The sweet potato fries that came on the side were delish, they were tempura fried, lightly salted and were MASSIVE in size and taste. My sea bass was also run of the mill Asian style fish with soy based sauce. I do appreciate, however, that the fish had a nice crisp on the top and that they did not skimp on the green onion/greenery to complement the fish. That's just my personal preference. Dessert...all three were delivered...cookies, pineapple cake and shaved ice smoothie. The cookies and milk were probably the best, since chocolate and chewiness and cream, well, can't really go wrong. The pineapple cake was ho hum, the cake part pretty dry. Alas, so the shaved ice smoothie...was scary. My expectations and my heart sank...basically boys and girls, it was a coconut-taro smoothie with boba. If they had done it correctly, hey, those stars may be lighting up above this review, well, maybe. The boba...were in disintegrated bits that should not have left the kitchen. To the credit of the staff, we did get a discounted bill because of the bad bits o boba.  Why 2-3 more falling stars from the rating sky? Because on a Monday night for four people (and 1 non solid food consuming kiddo),  three courses, took more than 2.5 hours. Our server, albeit, nice and helpful, was only timely during the beginning of our meal. He was MIA by the end of our dining experience, to the point where my husband had to stand up from the table, look in his general direction,....to get the bill. We were the dreaded forgotten table. To have my highly expected dessert ruined and no service...*sigh*",0.9909,0.796,0.145,0.059,0.6056766209308583

Oh the mussels were effing amazing.  They were HUGE.  These mussels were the size of small meatballs and the sauce that supplemented them was perfect.  If you are a mussel fan, I would visit Aja just for that.

2011-02-18,2.0,"So after reading many of the reviews on Yelp, I came here tonight for restaurant week.  The night started off well! We made a reservation and were promptly seated, but the waiter accidentally spilled water all over our table while filling up our water glasses. He apologized and tried to clean it up with a napkin, but unfortunately just ended up spreading the water all over our table. (Damn napkins!) He left, we assumed to get a better napkin...but...he never came back. Our waitress came over and apologized for the spill, but (we think) assumed he was taking care of it and disappeared. 10 minutes later, she notices our table is still went, and goes to get a rag immediately to help clean it off and take our order.  I got the firework spring rolls, the hangar steak and the boba (bubbles) tea for dessert. He got crab rangoon, ramen and the pineapple upside down cake. For a drink I just had water but he had a bombay martini.  The martini took forever. We got our appetizers before the drink was ready! He said the martini wasn't that great, and it was $12.  The firework spring rolls were deep fried (I must not have see nthat on the menu, I was assuming it would be in the steamed rice paper it normally is in), but they were tasty. The steak was good but it came with this tempura sweet potato side and cole slaw. Not a fan of the tempura- it was kind of cold- and cole slaw? really?!  The ramen was delicious though, and the crab rangoon, even though its essentially deep fried cream cheese, was delicious and surprisingly light. They ran out of pineapple upside down cake, so milk and cookies were ordered instead. I thought they were like the gross cousin of whoopee pies, but he liked them. The boba tea though was awesome. Some of the best I've had in Chicago yet!! Overall, the service wasn't that great, but our waitress was really trying, and lots of things were out of her control. The price ($100+ for the meal) was a bit steep for something not that great... unfortunately, I probably won't go back.

I love that they have added a lounge area for those who just want to relax and enjoy the company of close friends. The patio, also, have been a substantial improvement to the style of the place. It's always buzzing with energy during the summer and fall season. Now that it's winter, it's still a lovely sight to see while lined with lights that compliment the season. The two managers are very knowledgeable and personable when addressing any questions. I've even noticed them jumping in and assisting when the staff got overwhelmed with business; very reassuring to see. Many of the servers are on point as they make every genuine attempt to accommodate guests; always fun and friendly when making lunch or dinner recommendations for folks like me, who can often be indecisive when overlooking a menu-- of which, by the way, was recently revamped! Drew and Todd are awesome bartenders who add an extra spark to your experience. In recent conversations with them, I learned that they've been there since its opening; and it definitely shows from the care they invest in their crafts and your bar experience. I love the asian-style decor and wonderfully designed upper dining level that breathes life to the room.

I am also anticipating the spice line that he is developing.  A quick rundown of or noshes: Hamachi Guacamole- the lime salsa and aged soy gave it a little something different. I am a huge fan of both main elements of this dish, but the light flavor of the guac did not overwhelm the Hamachi, which was awesome Shrimp Tempura Unagi Maki- somewhat typical roll, but nothing wrong with the old stand bys Maguro/Sake/Kinmedai Nigiri- again, old standards done well K.F.C.- I was very excited for this one, sorry I dont remember the sauce but it was a great addition, as were the huge onion rings that came on top of it Hacked 5 Spice Duck- with the scallions in every bite its perfect Ginger Asparagus- there is crispy pork on top of this dish which gives it an overall smokey pork flavor. As we all know, bacon is my favorite food group, so I was very pleased.  18 Vegetable Salad- I am always hesitant about trying new veggies for some reason(go figure) but the mixture was great and the soy-rice wine vinaigrette was delish. PLUS its all from a fortune farm co-op, yay to being green!!! Sizzling Suzuki- Freaking YUM!!! The ginger and greens were great and added an awesome sweet and sour element to this smooth rich dish. Umami indeed.  Korean BBQ- The meat was perfectly cooked and the pickled cabbage slaw was a little spicy and possibly one of my favorite things of the night Sesame Chicken-A great stand by done in a great way.

This place pretty much fits that bill, however the food was good and service was nice. We started out with a few appetizers, the 18 vegetable salad, the chicken lettuce wraps and the tuna maki. The salad was great, especially when eating outside on a warm day. The lettuce wraps were good as well, as they came with a couple different ""sauces"" to add to the already interesting condiments. The Tuna maki was decent, but not anything special. For the main course I had their version of a banh mi (but with pulled pork instead). The flavors were there, but it just got to be a big sloppy mess in the end due to the heavy bbq sauce. It tasted good, but I probably wouldn't get it again...",0.8177,0.807,0.129,0.064,0.5652998236331569

I was staying at the Dana Hotel, and usually I don't eat at the restaurants in hotels (because the food is usually just ok and there are so many options to be had in any city). This time was an exception - I looked forward to coming in for lunch and dinner close to every day. I got addicted to the Bubbles dessert shake (yes, I craved one every night after I had it the first night. I still could go for one days later - they are just that good!). The salads are just to die for - super fresh, great dressings and filling. The mussels were just amazing with this super tasty sauce -- I think I ate close to 2 massive pieces of bread just to soak up every drop. The chicken wraps were downright delicious. Every meal was just great and the wine selection added to the experience to make it just fabulous. This place is great for groups - the portions are just tremendous and great for sharing. I wish there was more than just me on this trip - I wanted to try more things on the menu. And eating at the bar is also a blast. The bartenders are way cool and Drew is just awesome.

It kinda makes you feel like you're about to see a metal show, but in reality, you're about to eat some food while sitting down. Ronnie James Dio was not our server, which kind of sucked. I took a star off for that fact.  I had the glazed orange chicken, which was pretty good. The portion was too large, and I felt symptoms of obesity after eating it. It was a little dry, and I think I've had a similar dish at Panda Express for much less money.  The Lo-Mein noodles were pretty good too.  The service was interesting. We got our main courses in about 32 seconds after ordering them. My wife and I couldn't even talk about how our 2 year old was planning to quote: ""excrete on mommy"" which was supposed to be our pre-dinner conversation. It was stunning speed. Unfortunately, dessert and espresso took much longer. They couldn't figure out where to bring the oreo desserts.

Our server Joseph was as accommodating as one can be; we even had a bottle of champagne in courtesy of him! I don't understand how this place is still listed as a steakhouse but it is NOT! Their menu looked predominantly sushi to me, but I'll tell you what though, their sushi is the freshest that I've had in a long while. I used to judge sushi based on its presentation and creativity, and don't get me wrong, I still do. However, I've come to appreciate the simplest form of sushi as long as its fresh. This is due to warming up to plain sashimi where all you need is a dab of soy sauce to make me happy. Yes, this place has one of the freshest sushi and their maki selection--though not the most outstanding--are well prepared. I ordered the scallop maki and will vouch for its delightfulness. Other items didn't exactly strike me as original, but I'll take it. I had the Lychee cocktail and that was alright. Prices aren't outrageous here like most places in the area.

2010-04-03,4.0,"So I was walking the Magnificent Mile in Chicago on a Friday night around 8:00 PM starting to get really hungry. The dilemma: Walking the Magnificent Mile in Chicago on a Friday night and thinking I'll find a good restaurant without a long wait time. To put things in perspective, I was near Ohio and Ontario streets... prime tourist and shopping area. After checking out a few favorite places in the immediate area (and finding 30-minute to 1-hour wait times) I headed west toward State Street and began looking for something a little off the beaten path. I passed by Aja (pronounced 'Asia') and noticed some open tables outside and inside the restaurant. Thought I'd give it a try. Table for 1? (Hey, don't laugh. I eat alone frequently.) No problem... I was seated right away. My first fear, as a non-seafood eater, was that they wouldn't have anything for me on the menu. Aside from the sushi type offerings, they did have several non-seafood selections to choose from. I ordered the sesame chicken. Also decided to try the 'in season' blackberry Mojito since it appeared (by the pricing on the menu) that I was splurging a bit this evening. Before anything else, my server brought out a stainless steel bowl of shaved lemon ice being cooled in another covered container of dry ice. Neat effect. The lemon ice was to refresh the palate, I believe. The flat wooden spoon wasn't fully effective at spooning up the ice, but that's a minor thing. Next came a long thin dish of five pickled vegetables to sample while my main course was being prepared. I recognized the carrots, beets, and cabbage. All were pretty good. I practiced using my chopsticks on the veggies. The sesame chicken came out with a side bowl of white rice. I fumbled with my chopsticks, taking my first bite of the chicken and then said to myself, ""Wow! This is really good! Heck with the chopsticks, I need a fork!"" To that, I tossed the sticks aside and went to town on the sesame chicken. Really good sesame chicken! Large portion filled me up sufficiently. Overall this was a good choice for dinner on a Friday night. Location was out of the way from the major pedestrian crowds of Michigan Avenue. And though a little more pricey than standard fare, the portion of food and quality made it worth the trip.",0.9817,0.879,0.094,0.027,0.47998511904761904
2010-04-02,2.0,"I had an occasion to attend a private event for which Chef Josh Linton created a special menu and oversaw its service himself. I don't think I ever in my life have had such a meal --- the subtle interplay of taste, texture, spices and herbs, originality in both creation and presentation. I went to the restaurant, then, on a weekend evening, expecting at least a shadow of the special meal I'd had. It was nowhere to be found. A friend had had the tempura rock shrimp during a previous visit to the restaurant and recommended it. It's billed as ""spicy,"" however, on my visit it was so over-heated no taste but the pepper was evident. And mind you, I LIKE spicy, but I found this dish to be inedible. The crab rangoon appetizer was O.K., except for that spot in the middle of one of the dumplings that was still frozen(!). My husband and I both had the NY strip steak, sliced and served with chile-butter. The meat was wonderful --- fork-tender, buttery, perfectly cooked. The sauce, well, you noticed the word ""chile"" in there, right? Yet again, there was SO MUCH chile, and so much of the sauce on top of the meat, that the heat completely overpowered everything. We only were able to enjoy our steak by scraping the chile-butter off of the slices to taste the meat beneath. Even so, by the end of the meal our tongues, cheeks and lips were burning from the capcaisin.  We mentioned how the pepper and chile had gotten in the way of our enjoying the meal to the fullest and the waiter brought us a complimentary dessert of the in-house Oreo cookies. A nice gesture, even if dietary restrictions prevented my husband from eating them. Overall, we did not have the service issues others have noted. We arrived on the early side for a weekend evening (7 p.m.) and the place was nearly deserted, so we should have been well-cared-for. The dining room was picking up steam around 9, though, when we were finishing up, so perhaps that's the time of evening that the service issues arise. I would not choose to go to Aja again, esp given the price point, but having had the opportunity for a more ""pure"" experience with Linton's abilities, I have to assume there's something preventing his vision from making it through the kitchen and on to diners' tables. For what it's worth, that's a shame. Linton's wonderful; Aja isn't.",0.9948,0.838,0.143,0.019,0.5065079365079365

We were told that the menu was designed for sharing so that's how we approached it, basically picking five appetizers and five entrees. The sushi rolls were pretty good, the lobster mini-hand rolls very good. The ""big salad"" was very good. All of the entrees were solid, but the pork and short ribs stood out as excellent. The desserts were yummy, but huge - the ice cream sundae was obnoxiously large and the apple thing was pretty sizable. Everyone was able to have a good size taste of both. The espresso was one of the worst I've ever had - tasted like dishwater.

Maybe our waiter was trying t be unobtrusive and cool but at a certain point you want your drinks and you want to order and you want your food in a timely manner. We always had to seek him out and prod for the next stage of the meal. Maybe because we were seated upstairs and out of the flow we had this problem. (What I didn't like about being upstairs was that the hotel lobby was in eyeshot, so it felt like you were eating, well, next to a hotel lobby.) The final service annoyance of the evening was that they didn't tell us that a 18% tip was automatically added to the bill and only because of the folks at the table noticed that the math didn't add up did we ask about it. The reason? Because we were three couples and threw down three credit cards to split (who doesn't do that?), they added the tip. If it were one bill, they wouldn't have done it. Not a huge deal, but: kind of sneaky and this was a 15% tip night, not a 20% night.

Now that they solely feature all things Asian, it's all that and a bag of Dorito's, chile'. Cool Ranch! The design is minimal and clean. Being inside the Dana Hotel, you would expect nothing less. The day I came here, the fire was roaring and folks were chilling in banquettes, getting a serious eat on. My dining companions were already enjoying some wine, so I doffed my coat and joined in. As we swirled our reds, we supped on pickled...stuff. I wasn't quite sure what everything was. I know I ate a beet -- which was the last time that would happen. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. She walked us through the good, the great and the fattening. I loved it. A word of advice: if you are allergic to shellfish, beware. Most everything here is marinated in clam juice. Yes, even the non-seafood. It's not a problem for me (thank God) but if it is for you, be aware and ask questions. We started with a shared tiered veggies salad (pan-Asian) and lettuce wraps with chicken. Both were incredibly tasty. The tiered salad was gigantic. Three of us tore into it, and we barely put a dent into it. Do not order this by yourself. This is a treat to be savored by multiple people. The lettuce wraps were tasty, filling and very do-it-yourself. It was a nice, interactive way to share apps. For my entree, I ordered the pork banh mi sandwich (Vietnamese). It was slightly re-imagined in that it had some sort of sauce along with the sandwich. The pork was bar-b-qued and it was incredible. The sandwich was topped with traditional stuff (carrots, lemongrass and stuff) but there was also kimchi! Kimchi on my banh mi! And it was good! It really liked the intersection of flavors and thought it made a lot of sense. The sandwich came with fries and a green ranch sauce that was Japanese in origin (so I was told). I scarfed down everything. Seriously. If I cared about these things, I would be embarrassed.  But, I wasn't and I am not. It was incredibly good. If you have a hankering for anything Asian (they cater to all major countries), you have to come here and try something.

Granted, it was kind of funny because the person doing the interviewing had no clue what to ask these interviewees, but it was distracting as we were just trying to relax over some wine. Doesn't seem like the forum for job interviews. The next morning, we could barely get service to save our lives - and we were sitting directly next to the stand where the wait staff congregated. Which they did a lot. Hung out and talked about their weekends, their night before, etc. even as we were next to them trying to get their attention. I doubt we would have gone back had we not had breakfast vouchers for the next day. This was the worst by far. They brought blueberry cornbread to the table when we arrived and, because I have celiac disease, I asked the waiter, ""Can you check with the chef to find out if there is any flour in the cornbread?"" Not ""do you know"" or ""what do you think,"" but ""check with the chef."" He returns and says, ""No, ma'am. There is no flour in that cornbread."" I was super excited, took a huge bite, it was delicious, I took another. Waiter reappears. ""Um, ma'am, my manager says you shouldn't eat that. It does have flour in it."" !!!

All throughout the experience the 5 guys behind the sushi bar just stood there, some making food, some texting on their cell phones.  We were clearly looking for our server numerous times and no one ever tried to help.  No apologies, no food comps. I also felt it was too pricey.  The food was good (mostly) but the service and the disrespectful attitude make this place  a loser.",-0.9608,0.767,0.087,0.146,0.5469696969696969

They have no outside seating for more than a table of two. Again, being from San Diego, this is a crime. UGH. Rearrange some things and accommodate your patrons. I asked about a certain mixed drink on the menu, and whether the ginger flavor was strong. The guy tells me no, but he wouldn't recommend it if I'm not a big sake drinker. Hmm. Okay. So I ask about another drink. He says it's good, I'd like it. I take a sip and it is like sucking on ginger juice. Dude. Did I not just say I do not like ginger? So the menu...the sushi was okay. Not the greatest. The free-range chicken, good flavor. A little fatty. The baked potato-wow. Very dry. I mean I don't put anyhting on my potatos, but it wasn't light and fluffy. It was hard and, well a disappointment. It's a potato. Not a souffle'.  Soooo anyway, I just wasn't wild about this place, but the servers were really nice. The bar was an okay vibe, but there were just so many older men who wouldn't just let us enjoy our dinner. Yeah, I'm sure you're here to fly in the airshow, just like every other guy in Chicago, and thanks for telling me how hot we all are, but can I just please eat?

So, the next morning we came for breakfast. We ordered and got coffee and then waited. And waited. After about a half an hour, we think they served half our order to the table sitting next to us. 45 minutes later, we still had no food, and nobody had even come back to refill our coffee. And we were right in the middle of the front of the restaurant - it was impossible to miss us. At that point, we went to the hostess stand and told them we were leaving. No apology, just blank stares.  We went across the street to Bijan Bistro and had a great breakfast on the patio in less time than we spent waiting for our food at Aja. That's really just unacceptable.

I've had a maki roll both times I've stayed at the Dana (the Yellowfin Tuna one to be exact), and each time I've loved it.

2009-06-14,4.0,"Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by this place after reading some of the reviews....it was really pretty good - and yes, I'm a foodie, so you can trust me.  haha. So first we had cocktails in the bar downstairs.  I had the almond pear blossom which I loved!  It was strong, with a divine aroma of juicy pear.  It was just what I hoped it would be.  For dinner, my dining partner and I split a bottle of the Laurent Perrier demi-sec.  We've had it before and knew we liked it - good thing too, since our waiter said he usually worked lunches and didn't know much about champagne.  Still, at least he was honest, and he asked two other servers for their opinions before recommending that we stick with the Laurent Perrier.  Throughout the meal, our server had a very casual, joking demeanor.  I enjoyed it, but it was a bit unusual for such a pricey place.  He helped us make our maki selection and said we made good choices on the rest of our courses! We began with the spicy tuna maki, since the waiter said it was the most popular.  At first bite, I was a little ambivalent.  It was good, but not great - then my boyfriend scraped off the thick mayo on top and ate the roll without it.  He said it was MUCH improved.  I followed suit and agreed - the tuna and avocado were very fresh, and the mayo really wasn't necessary.  I think it was the ""spicy"" part of the roll though....usually in a spicy tuna roll, the tuna itself is mixed with spice, but in this roll i think it was regular tuna with a spicy sauce.  Once we scraped off the sauce,  it really was a good tuna roll.  But not spicy. Next we got the Asian Pear salad, which was excellent.  The arugula was mixed with dill and whole mint leaves, a surprisingly good combination, and scattered throughout with walnuts, pear, and gorgonzola.  The cheese and fruit were a perfect complement, and the dressing was delicate and sweet.  If you know you're eating a big piece of meat for your main course, this salad is a great start. Finally, we split two entrees - the slow roasted sea bass and the ribeye.  The sea bass was delicate and had the most delightful crust - honestly it reminded me of a potato pancake at first bite!  The dish had a light, elegant feel and the fish was extremely well-prepared.  The steak was also delightful - it must have been cooked at high heat since it had a char on the outside but was perfectly medium rare on the inside.  I loved that juxtaposition of flavors - the char with the juicy pink meat.  It was a good steak - I've had better at true steakhouses, but it was well-seasoned and cooked just as we asked.  Their steak sauce really tasted like it came straight out of a bottle - I'd highly recommend NOT using it. All in all, it was a very good meal.  It wasn't shockingly stellar, but it was very good, and worth what we paid (especially with our $100 gift card...haha).  Some of the sauces are poorly chosen, but then you simply don't use them, and you have a tasty meal ahead of you!",0.9993,0.731,0.255,0.014,0.5836341575091575

Anyways I enjoyed the soundtrack and the view of downtown Chicago was wonderful.  My server was lovely and once I explained my situation he advised on the kobe sliders.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it on sushi alone though. The menu itself was pretty intimidating price-wise, but that's what you get when you go to a restaraunt like that. I wound up splitting the ""steak for two,"" which was actually a great bang for the buck. I can't believe I'm saying that, considering what we paid for the entire meal! It was a cool expereince. I'd recommend it for special occasions or if you're trying to impress someone, but other than that? It's way too expensive. 4 stars for probably the only time I'll ever go there (unless someone else was paying).",0.9569,0.764,0.169,0.067,0.6090638528138528

2008-09-14,5.0,"My girlfriend and I had a late night dinner at Ajasteak last week. We strolled in around 10:15 expecting to have a quick bite since the kitchen closes at 11 but once we opened the menu, we couldn't resist doing it up. I started with their Lemongrass Gimlet martini and she, a Tangerine Mojito from their cocktail list. Both drinks were great, an perfect mix of flavors and alcohol, not too weak, not too strong, just right.  Our first course was one of the house specialties, Hamachi Guacamole. If you like sushi and you like guac, this is a win/win. The dish starts of with your basic guac and is then topped with diced hamachi(yellowtail) and finished with sliced jalepenos and micro cilantro, taro root chips on the side for some dipping action add the perfect crunch. I had never had an app that married these two unlikely dishes so perfectly. Second course we split the Icebereg Wedge, this isn't your typical wedge salad, this one's all about the bacon and when I say bacon, I mean porkbelly. The dish starts with a small pool of Japanese ranch dressing ( How cool is that?) a wedge of lettuce, and finished with thick sliced porkbelly. Amazing. And now for the main event! Third course: Slow Roasted Japanese Seabass ( Suzuki) served in a light soy/oyster sauce topped with a julienne of bok choy and fresh herbs. We paired up the 'Surf' with a little 'Turf' , the America Prime Bone In Ribeye. The steak came with a smear of the house AjaSteak sauce across the plate and a white truffle butter ramekin on the side. Both dishes were melt in your mouth good and flavors were accentuated by our Castle Rock Pino Noir. Finished up with the Midnight Dark Chocolate Cake dessert, came with bruleed bananas, a smoky caramel smear down the plate and a shot of banana/cinnamon milkshake which we poured over the cake itself. This one was rich and delicious, if I see burnt bananas on any dessert list, I'm in.   Mark my words, duplicate this order and you will have an amazing, comprehensive dining experience.

I should say the food on the menu sounded delicious making my already full stomach hungry all over again. Okay, let me get back to my drinky-drink. They had a decent selection of wine, but I opted try one of the cocktails. I ordered the almond pear cocktail, which consisted of amaretto, absolut pear, another ingredient I cannot remember, and a giant slice of pear in the middle. It was really tasty and not as potent as I thought it would be. My friend ordered one of the sake choices and was pleased with it. Prices for drinks (and food) were average in comparison to other similar places in the area...so no surprise there.    AjaSteak is on the first floor of this boutique hotel and the concierge and lobby is upstairs. The place has a lounge-like feel with a bar, and the crowd was plentiful for a weeknight. Because of the crowd, I was expecting to have to shout at/ to my drinking partner, which I am not to fond of doing. We sat at the bar, not that far from the dining area.

The waiter explained that they were aware of the negative feedback regarding the service, and have been working hard to iron out the kinks. Based on my experience last night, it seems as though they succeeded.  We started out with edamame and beef carpaccio. I really liked the beef carpaccio, but my date thought it had too much stuff on top. We ordered a few maki rolls...spicy tuna and hamachi. Both were great, but the highlight of the evening was definitely the kobe steak. Normally I'm not a big steak eater, but this steak was heavenly and melted in my mouth. It was very expensive though..$18/ounce. I could easily have eaten a pound. We split the chocolate cake for dessert, which was good, but we were both drunkenly hoping for it to have a molten center. Ah well.  As for drinks, I had a tangerine mojito to start, which was fun. They had a pretty good selection of cocktails...I wanted to try them all!

2008-09-02,1.0,"My review on Ajasteak is part of a comprehensive review on the Dana Hotel which can be seen here:  yelp.com/biz/dana-hotel-… Going into the restaurant, I had moderate expectations given that its fairly new and some of the reviews seemed ""eh"". We had an 8PM reservation and were clearly on time since we were just an elevator away. When we arrived, we were told they werent ready for us yet and to enjoy a cocktail at the bar - should be 15-20 minutes. I looked into what I assumed was the restaurant and there were only two tables out of probably 15 occupied and a few parties eating outside. I assumed there was another section of the restaurant that couldnt be seen from the bar area, but when we were seated in what turned out to be the empty restaurant I was BAFFLED. I ran to the bathroom when we were seated (have to take elevator/stairs to 2nd floor bathroom, none on restaurant level) - but the manager came to the table and apologized to my fiance for the wait - apparently they were extremely short staffed, backed up in the kitchen, and had a private party ""upstairs"". New restaurant kinks or shitty service???  The menu was on par with what I expected. We started with edamame (decent, but kind of flavorless) and the Kobe beef yakatori. I'm SO GLAD I opted for the Kobe beef appetizer as opposed to the $18 per oz entree as it was REALLY sub-par. It was served with mini-skewer/toothpicks to eat it with and kind of came across as something that would be served as passed appetizers at a cocktail party. Unimpressive.  My fiance ordered the sea bass which she generally loves.Sea bass isnt normally a ""fishy"" fish and it is usually hearty/fluffy. However, her piece was pounded so thin, it was almost laughable and it was drenched in the terriyaki sauce (which although tasty) seemed an intentional overpowering of the sub-par fish. I opted for the lamb chops and upon ordering told the server that although I enjoy my steaks medium rare, I prefer lamb cooked a bit more and he acknowledged my request - OF COURSE, the lamb came out pretty much rare and both chops had a big visible piece of fat through the middle. This was a $40 dish that was worth 1/2 that, if that. I ate it because at that point I was starving. We also shared the ""truffle"" mashed potatoes which didnt have a hint of truffle flavor and tasted more like the buttered flavor out of the bag instant mashed potatoes found at the local Jewel for $0.89. Dismal. Clearly, we didnt stick around for dessert.",0.9809,0.846,0.107,0.047,0.5008741258741259

But the food, compliments of my generous pal who insisted on treating for no apparent reason other than being a great guy, was awesome apart from my bias. The sushi was noticeably fresh. We ordered Maguro, Hamachi, and Unagi rolls, and the house treated us to edamame and spicy tuna. The wasabi was super potent and the best I've ever had. But my host sent back his Chilean Sea Bass. It was too fried and salty. They took that off the bill no problem, and having listened to what he had thought as to how the Sea Bass would be cooked, they brought him an out-of-this world piece of Black Cod -- also known in Yidville as ""Sable.""

2008-08-08,3.0,"I had dinner here last night and even now I wonder what went wrong as the evening started off perfectly (thus the 3 stars) but seemed to fall down as the evening went on.  Located in the new Dana Hotel, Ajasteak (pronounced Asia steak) is one of the recent additions to this neighborhood. First- the bar and restaurant are lovely.  Simple, minimalistic , with floor to ceiling windows and a second floor sushi bar that seems to float in the air.  We chose to sit outside as it was one of those perfect Chicago evenings that don't come around every day. The menu is that perfect pairing of sushi and steak- two of my favorite foods. We started with a couple of the rolls (spicy tuna and peekytoe crab) delicious, raw oysters, and the chile shrimp that was clearly a table favorite.  Had we stopped here this review might have had one more star. Before I continue- let me tell you a little about their steaks- you can get what they call American Prime beef which is priced competitively to other steak places in town.  But if you've got money to burn?  Try the Kobe beef.  Priced by the ounce, the ounce! (with a minimum 4 oz purchase) you could easily spend $72 for a 12 oz NY strip steak.  When I first glanced at the menu- I didn't read far enough down to see that there were more choices!  I was too busy doing the math trying to figure out how hungry I would be with only a 4oz steak! For our entrees we ordered a couple of filets and a New York strip and some of their incredible whipped potatoes. (As an aside- the potatoes alone are worth 5 stars!) Anyway- it was at this point that our evening stalled.  My steak was fine.  Perfectly prepared served with a steak sauce and this amazing truffle butter to put on top. Couple that with those delicious potatoes and I was happy.  But the two filets were way over cooked.  Ordered medium, they were both well done and chewy.   We asked the manager to send one of them back and he said that a new one would be out right away and that he would comp us a round of drinks.  Sounded good- but 20 minutes later when there was still no steak, no drinks and no sign of our waiter, we flagged down a food runner to go and find someone to help us.  When the steak finally showed up- this time it was rare- still not done to the right temperature.  How this is possible at an upscale ""steak house"" I am still wondering about?  They offered to cook it more but we just didn't have the time to wait again so we asked for a take out box figuring we could finish cooking it at home as leftovers. The service was inconsistent.  The hostess, and bartender were great.  Our waiter, however, was a bit surly.  He made us feel rushed up front and after a false start where he told us a ""fake""  name in case we didn't like the service (hmm . . .a portent of things to come?) he was missing most of the night.  If it hadn't been for the manager and the food runner- I am not sure how we would have gotten anything to eat.   This place has the potential to be really good. Great location, ambiance and chef credentials that give me pause to think they couldn't get our steaks to the right temperature. So stay tuned.  Maybe they will impress me all the way through my dining experience the next time versus just the first course.",0.998,0.814,0.148,0.038,0.5714817369579274

2008-08-01,4.0,"My four-star rating is largely based on how much the people I was with enjoyed their food. I have to say that this isn't the best place for a vegetarian, so take that into consideration when you read my review. They do some really interesting things with maki rolls. I ordered a set that was a combination of fresh fruit and veggies (including mango), and it was really interesting. I shared it with my sister-in-law and she also came to the 'interesting' conclusion. Neither of us were sure we'd order it again, but it was an experience. We also ordered the guacamole, and apparently I didn't read the menu properly because it came with a layer of tuna tartare. My dinner companions ate that part for me, and I focused on the guacamole. It was excellent, however it came with four chips. Four. I, and most of the other tables, wound up asking for more chips (so they brought out 3 more). I realize they make them there, but they've got to offer a few more chips unless they want the waiters to be running back and forth fetching them all evening. The rolls here were amazing. They had a pumpernickel roll stuffed with onion, and some really tasty multi-seed flat bread (which seems to be the trend in fine dining right now.)  The guys at my table ordered beef, and pork, and both were swooning! The meat here was very expensive, but apparently worth it. We also got a great sake, which they served to us in the square wooden boxes that I like so much.  We sat outside, and were right next to the sidewalk, so we had the occasional random passerby just stop and start talking to us. The decor inside and out was nice, and the bathrooms really lovely.  We were there on their first weekend, accidentally, and apart from the waiter clearly feeling way overtaxed (he was still very friendly), service was smooth.

2008-07-31,3.0,"I'm way behind on getting this review written. My wife, my brother and his wife and I went to Aja on a complete whim on a Saturday night because, as we walked around the neighborhood, they actually had empty tables -- outside! We'd failed to make reservations anywhere and so we were up against it. We went in, asked for a table, were told there would be a short wait, and so we said ""ok"".  Now I'll back up just a bit. Unknown to us, we were there on the first Saturday that they were open. Which, when we found out later, made quite a number of things make a lot more sense.  They had four hostesses! They came by to apologize for our wait to get a table about every 2 minutes, for the entire 20 minutes we waited to be seated. They'd told us up front about 20 minutes to get a table! Again, this is at 7pm on a Saturday night. Have you ever waited -only- 20 minutes, without a reservation, on a Saturday night at 7pm? Hell, a few weeks later we waited 20 minutes for a table at Weber Grill and we -had- a reservation! Other little things clearly needed to be honed with practice.  The reason the had empty tables outside is that they were short on servers and didn't to bury the one guy who was working the patio. Empty tables on a Saturday night on purpose?! Bad for the bottom line, which eventually leads to cutting corners in bad ways. Hopefully they've hired more staff. The guac and chips (with yellowfin tuna tartare!) came with something like -four- chips. We'd seen a tiny plate of extra chips go by to another table and were baffled -- until ours showed up. They do this slick presentation with the guac and chips, but it leaves very little room to include -enough- chips to -eat- the guac. Obviously they need to find a different plating method so that the wait staff don't start a riot about constantly having to make extra trips with second plates with three or four chips on them. I never order pork in restaurants -- too difficult to serve a piece worth eating in a culture so paranoid about undercooked meat that it just gets ruined. But since we had not planned on going to a place of this caliber, I wasn't really prepared to drop the cash necessary to enjoy the Kobe or Wagyu steaks. So I reluctantly ordered the chop. It was _excellent_. They actually dared to serve it to me a little pink! Since I have every confidence it reached an internal temperature well clear of the danger zone, this meant I could actually enjoy a piece of pork that wasn't dry as a rock without concern for my health -- thank you! It was served with a white truffle butter. I usually eshew any kind of sauces on meat. Meat should taste like itself -- at the prices you pay for a good steak or chop or seafood, why would you want it to taste like a piece of fruit or like mushrooms? But this white truffle butter was a perfect, subtle -compliment- to the pork's own flavor without getting in the way. The kobe skewers were excellent. The maki roll with kobe and kimchi was excellent. The house made kimchi and sweet pickles were excellent. The variety of rolls we were served were unusual and very tasty. My only regret about the evening was that my brother and I didn't act fast enough to save the $100 worth of steak we saw leaving the table behind ours, uneaten, before it ended up, we're certain, in the happy mouths of the cooks, bus boys and wait staff. Someone who simply wasn't that hungry obviously was in the wrong restaurant.  I would say that the coast is probably clear and that they've worked things out by now, but I can see other reviews here that are somewhat recent that still seem to indicate that they are struggling to fire on all cylinders.  I -hope- they can get it all sorted, and can begin to turn out a consistent, high quality product. All the elements are there. Ambiance, helpful staff, extremely imaginative and dedicated chef, premium ingredients. If they can get it together, I am confident this will become a ""must try"" destination in Chicago.",0.9964,0.799,0.136,0.065,0.48737234652897304

A few bad things:  1. We didn't receive napkins until we requested them even after we received our hors d'oevres.  I noticed it was the same for other tables.  2. ok, albeti a bit petty, they never refilled our wine glasses (we ordered a bottle).  3.  The sushi was anything but typical; $17 for a tuna maki?  Ok it was bluefin, but no ahi tuna maki was even available... 4.  My husband's ribs were COLD!  Not just not hot, they were cold.  5.  I had the crispy chicken, which wasn't crispy at all and tasted a little like it was cooked too quickly.  6.  we also didn't receive a bread basket or hot washclothes as we saw other people receive. A few good points:  1.  the staff was really friendly from hostesses to server 2.  the wine prices were a nice range.  3.  the salads & contemporary sushi did sound good and were fairly priced, although we didn't try any of it.  4.  they remade my husbands ribs and then they were really delicious!!  5.  the two side dishes of spinach & long beans were delicious!!  6.  my chicken was very tender and the skin was good. It will be quite a while before we go back here.  We were on our way to Quartino and really should have kept going onto there.  Good luck Ajasteak... you need to tighten things up.",0.9939,0.814,0.159,0.028,0.5490079365079366
2008-07-19,3.0,"Great decor and feel on the inside.  The large windows give it a very open feel.  We got to the table and were immediately told what drinks we couldn't have (2 out of 5 on the list), because they were out a certain liquors.  Okay, not a big deal, but after the server took a little longer to greet our table, the luster started to fade.  The great news is that the food was great.  I ordered the Deviled Eggs (which was great), and the 12oz Wagyu steak (which was perfect - one of the better steaks I've had in recent years).  For sides, we ordered the vegetable tempura and the double-baked potato.  All the food was great, but the service made the meal a little awkward.  The prices are a little high to make any flaws in service, and it was a little laid back for what you would expect ($72 for the steak alone).  So, I'm mixed on whether to recommend.  It is expensive, but if you've hit most of the steak houses in Chicago and want a different take, this place might work for you.  I will probably not go back again, unless I start seeing some better reviews.",0.9903,0.787,0.191,0.022,0.5323076923076923
2008-07-14,3.0,"The good... modern atmosphere,  beautifully designed restaurant.  The choices of steak, fish, sushi, Asian style sides were fantastic.   The $72 12 oz Wagyu New York strip was delicious.  So was the Nobu style Miso marinated black cod.  The ""Deviled Eggs"" appetizer was really good.  I wish they sell them by the dozen. The bad... our server took a long time to get to us.  The manager actually came and took our drinks order.  It was a Sunday night and it was not busy.   The ugly... in reading other reviews, I realized that we didn't get a bread basket nor hot towels at the end of the meal.  Two out of the five specialty drinks on the drink menu were not available because the they didn't have lemongrass.  It just set up the wrong vibe.  How far is Chinatown?  A $10 cab ride? Overall, we enjoyed the food a lot, but for the prices they charge, I think the service should be tightened up a bit.",0.8292,0.895,0.082,0.023,0.5704545454545455
2008-06-28,4.0,"Inviting and fresh, Ajasteak deserves its reputation for one of the hottest restaurants in the city.   It is certainly a perfect compromise for the sushi and steak-lover lovers (or friends).  The menu features a generous mix of steaks and sushi, along with creative appetizers that the server will describe in detail.  The food is excellent, the people-watching is entertaining, and the atmosphere is welcoming.  Try Ajasteak...you'll love it!

2008-06-23,4.0,"This is the perfect restaurant for my husband and me.  He and I both LOVE steaks but I have always been wishing for a Chicago steakhouse that also serves rice as a side dish... and we finally found a place that isn't obscenely expensive that has sushi and great steaks on the menu.   The menu consists of your typical sushi (maki and nigiri) as well as some ""contemporary maki"" that was different but sounded delicious.  We tried one---a bbq beef (I think) roll with mint leaves topped with kimchi.  It was good, not delicious, because the kimchi on top of the rolls were different from the kimchi they served as a muse bouche (which was yummy---not authentic---it was like a napa cabbage salsa---but still yummy) before we got our meal and it wasn't authentic either.  They also had other interesting rolls like an all fruit roll containing mango, papaya, etc.  We didn't try that roll but I will definitely check it out when I'm dining with my girlfriends.  They had a decent appetizer menu featuring fresh fish and salads (one to try next: Asian pear salad with gorgonzola---how can you say NO?) but we skipped it because the bread basket they brought out filled us up.  The basket contained, in addition to your standard warm rolls, a flat-bread with some kind of spices encrusted on it which my hubby thoroughly enjoyed, as well as a pumpernickel bread with caramelized onions stuffed in it---what a SWEET surprise! Now for the steak menu----as advertised, the menu features kobe (from the Kobe prefecture in Japan) beef that you can order by the ounce, as well as wagyu and other domestic steaks.  My husband ordered a steak (but didn't dish the extra bucks for piece of meat from Kobe), which was still very tender and DELICIOUS (they had a variety of steak/dipping sauces like chimichurri which my hubby enjoyed and looked fun) but I decided to order the braised short ribs instead... which was TO DIE FOR.  The short ribs were very tender and extremely flavorful.  The entree menu features some mouth watering aquatic items (for you ovolactopescetarians) like lobster, sea bass and miso glazed cod (one of my favorite cod preparations) as well as chicken katsu, if you are not in the mood for steak.   The menu also featured your typical steakhouse side dishes---creamed spinach, twice baked potato, etc. but all with an Asian twist.  They had a corn on the cob dish that we saw because our waiter screwed up and brought it to our table and my husband and I both wished that we had ordered it... but we were both happy with what we chose: the green long beans hoisin style (which was amazing but we couldn't finish it---too much of it) and the french fries with spicy mustard and lemon-flavored mayo dipping sauces (both yummy).   We only had room to try one dessert---the oreos.  I'm not even going to describe it.  Just go try it for yourself.   The bill came in a masu (a square wooden box that the Japanese used to measure rice during the feudal periods), which was presented with hot towels (totally Japanese-style but at the wrong time---it should have come BEFORE the meal, not after...) and a temporary tattoo of a Chinese character, which I thought were cute ideas.   Our overall experience was great and deserves 5 stars but I decided to give them only 4 because they put us next to the kitchen.  The restaurant is fairly small (seats about 50 on the main floor) but there were plenty of other tables they could have seated us at, considering we had a reservation (though we were a bit early for our reservation)---the place was fairly empty since we were dining so early.   The restaurant's service is still being perfected-----they just opened on June 16----so people who expect impeccable service should go to Tru or wait a couple weeks for things to get settled.    (One side note---we sat next to the guys that just opened up Zed 451, which I have yet to try but heard GREAT things, and they seemed to enjoy their meal as well!!)",0.9988,0.813,0.162,0.025,0.5203051643192488
