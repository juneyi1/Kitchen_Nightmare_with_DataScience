2014-11-24,4.0,"They weren't the best hot dogs in Chicago, and they didn't serve Chicago style hotdogs. They snapped too much. But they were addictive, and cheap. And their fries were the best. Never had better anywhere. I can't listen to the band Chicago without thinking of this place. Great donuts in the morning too. It's definitely missed.",0.1935,0.724,0.143,0.132,0.5555555555555556
2014-09-24,5.0,I was very young when I started going here. It used to be a treat when we were downtown and on the way home we would stop. I would beg to go. I loved this small little place that not many people got to go to. I wish it was still around. It was a landmark that should have never been torn down. I can not tell you how much it sucks thinking about it being gone. Very few picture i can find of this place. If the owners of this place read this I hope you understand how much your place meant to me as a child. It was a rare treat but it was one I always looked forward to.,0.7474,0.862,0.109,0.029,0.4538888888888889

Wish they could've opened a new location in the parking lot east of the station, or somewhere else in the neighborhood. It was such a great place, that I can forgive them for the piped-in Chicago music, and Chicago band memorabilia. Finding a cheap place to eat in that area has never been the same, since Demon Dogs closed.",0.8074,0.888,0.095,0.017,0.4970779220779221
2011-06-07,5.0,"Demon Dogs was a landmark, and is still the reigning champ for BEST HOT DOG in Chicago, and therefor the world.  The fries were cooked in lard which left little fat on the fries and added enough salty flavor for them to be the single most addictive things on the planet.  The hot dogs were all Viena Beef, were cooked perfectly and were all around works of art, especially before/after a cubs game.   The only reason the place was closed was due to an expansion of The Fullerton EL stop, which was only done in a failed effort to increase Metro capacity for an Olympic bid which was lost anyway because the Olympic committee are two faced idiots.   I would seriously put thousands into a rebuilding of this landmark, if only to get one more meal and a t-shirt.  Someone get Metro on the line and have them open this puppy back up!",0.837,0.836,0.106,0.058,0.5763457556935819

2009-08-18,5.0,It needs to come back.  I  grew up in Lincoln Park and would beg my mom to take us there.  I didn't have it until high school.  Chicago institution.  One of many that has disappeared.  Is anyone else worried that this city is losing its  character?,-0.6908,0.86,0.0,0.14,0.3466666666666667
2009-07-14,4.0,"I used to eat at this place before going back to my dorm, but I am sad that they closed the fries were really good. CTA had been trying to get them to close for some time in order to remodel the Fullerton station. The only reason they stayed in buisness was because of the DePaul students who patronized this place for nearly 30 years. The only reason it was a hot spot was because singer and Chicago native Jeremy Jordan would eat here on a frequent basis. I loved the fresh cut fries which were delicious even though they were a little greasy. The hot dogs were good since I was about having them with ketchup. Plus the owner was the one who produced the band and DePaul alum Chicago and the place had a lot of Chicago memorabilia from their early days and past albums. If you wanted a quick meal for a small price you got it at Demon Dogs.",0.9526,0.836,0.126,0.039,0.5763157894736842
2008-01-20,4.0,"RIP Demon Dogs... you will be missed! Quite possibly the best hot dog in the city. The prices can't be beat (under $2 for hotdog and fries) and the location is key. Although it was always crowded, the service was fast. Who could forget all of the fun decorations and memorabilia?  I really hope this place resurfaces...it was fantastic!

Well, going to DePaul just hasn't been the same since the lost their fight to stay open. I ... like many others, miss this place.
