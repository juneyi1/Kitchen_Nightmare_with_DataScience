Then we were told that they were having a private party and were not allowing anyone in not on the list. Well, that is fine, but they could have called to let him know so that he would not have all of his friends show up! Also, funny how other people seem to just walk up and get let in without anyone checking a list.  My friend ask to speak with the guy he spoke to and when he came out he was not apologetic at all.

Not bad, since the drinks were $9 a pop. The crowd here seems really young, like maybe fake ID young. A lot of girls wearing basically nothing,dancing like there is a pole in front of them. Some girl was literally dry humping some guy at a table. The whole place was watching, and did anyone do anything.. no. Come on security! Gross!   I did have a decent time here, don't get me wrong.

2011-10-10,2.0,"I would not recommend hosting a party here. I organized my birthday party here and had a package arranged with the manager for a drink special of $30 wristband, a bottle of champagne, and cupcakes. At first the manager seemed great, really helpful, and outgoing when I talked to her over the phone. However, when my party arrived the manager was too lazy to come to the door to meet with us (even though she told me she would have everything set up and would take good care of us) and she told the door man to change the price of the wristband LAST MINUTE to $35. We paid the $35 since we were already there and walked in to a completely EMPTY bar. We also NEVER received the complimentary bottle of champagne or cupcakes. The manager is basically a liar and this club is definitely not worth wasting your money and time. I even asked her about reserving a table and she wouldn't reserve a table unless we got bottle service. (it turned out ok though because the place was empty so we just took over one of the tables that was ""reserved"" for invisible people that never showed up). There was also suppose to be a dance area in the basement, but it was closed most of the night which was a bummer because that was one of the reasons I picked Stone Lotus. Had I known all of this beforehand, I would have hosted my party at a different venue...   The only reason I gave Stone Lotus 2 stars was because the waterfalls inside are very nice. The club is really small though and not really worth all the hype. Being here once was enough for me.... it's definitely not worth going to again because there are so many other bars/clubs in Chicago that I think are much better.",0.8665,0.816,0.105,0.078,0.4706845238095237

It was amazing!  You could visibly see how this addition affected the dancing and the crowd. The people who come here are pretty interesting.  It is 50/50 Jersey Shore types and normal Chicagoans. Most of the girls who were dressed up had their butts hanging out of their dresses.  Pretty weird.  But the other half of people were not out of the ordinary and very friendly.  There were a lot more guys than girls there. The club itself is very stylish.  It has a long waterfall wall on one side, and the bar on the other.  On the ceiling is this beautiful lotus flower carved out of wood.   The only bad thing was that they had a half naked dancer, dancing on the back of the seats for half the night.  It really detracted from the scene and you could tell how disgusted people were.

I've actually been treated really well and the bottle service was good and with a very attentive waitress. However, being up by the bar and passing by the front while going from upstairs to down, I noticed a lot of 'tude being tossed around by the employees. I don't think I'd come here if I wasn't with someone to get me around the ropes. It seems too much to put up with. So, what's the point of a trendy lounge if it's too much trouble to roll in alone or with a buddy and try hitting a few lovely ladies. This place has some good potential.

Back upstairs was the station to grab your name tag and where everyone for the networking event congregated.  While the decor was swank and definitely epitomized the lounge feel with red floors, ambient lights, and water cascading down the walls, there was simply just not enough room to move around anywhere. The bar was completely packed, maneuvering through the crowd required using elbows and pushing hard and not a soul in the place was sitting. Granted, let's say everyone did sit down, the seats are not very spacious and there was no hope of sitting down without getting bumped. The wait time for a drink could easily be compared to that of a crowded bar in Wrigleyville on a Saturday night. Appetizers were excellent with thick skewers of chicken laced in a tasty marinade and well done hand cut fries with a ranch dressing.  $5 Bud Lights along with being situated within blocks of old Cabrini Green subtracts greatly from Stone Lotus and I think they need to buy some of the real estate next door, bust down the walls and make Stone Lotus twice as big.

They insisted on going to Stone Lotus.  I had heard about it before, and I was wearing dress shoes, so I didn't really mind (although usually I would have declined a suggestion like this).  My friend was wearing sandals, even though I told him not to, but somehow the girls we were with knew someone that worked there so the hesitant doorman let us all in. The decor was next to perfect.  The bartenders were smoking hot.  The place was almost empty, but I think it was still early.  Since our female accomplices were gracious enough to pick up the near $50 cab bill, I politely offered to buy a round of drinks.  A beer, a whiskey mix, two vodka cranberries, $52, YIKES.  Needless to say, those were the only drinks I purchased before hitting a dive bar to salvage the rest of my weekly paycheck and wondering why I tipped $8 on a retarded drink bill. Would I go back?  Probably.  But I'm the type of guy that has friends always wondering why I do stupid things when I already know the inevitable outcome.  I like to see a reaction, plain and simple.. Sometimes I just like to react myself.  If I do go back soon, before I forget how ridiculously expensive the place is, I'll probably bring a flask and mix up some whiskey and $4 cokes in the bathroom before making an ass out of myself by hitting on the bartenders.  I'm awesome, I know.",0.9016,0.806,0.109,0.085,0.5392380952380953

There is more seating than your average nightclub and the music is much better than you'll find at other places. Everyone seemed more laid back and less intensely trying to pick people up here.

2007-06-03,3.0,"My best friend worked as a bouncer here in the VIP (lower level) of this place, so it was like my second home for a long time.   Stone Lotus was ranked one of the country's top 10 new hot bars/clubs, so I guess that says a lot. I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr partying in VIP, but mostly just super attractive women - Model Caliber - and relatively wealthy up-and-coming young guys. Pretty much what can be said about most decent clubs downtown.  It's nice, fairly well decorated, has a good vibe, great music. Drinks are a little pricier than most clubs of similar caliber. It also has more of a lounge feel to it, than a club. The bouncers and wiatstaff are all really cool and now they are doing 2-hour hosted private cocktail receptions (read as: open bars) on certain nights so that's always a good thing. All-in-all, Stone Lotus serves well for  starting out the night, espeically if you catch the 2-hour open bar.  It is a bit too small for a MAIN EVENT hangout for my tastes, unless we're doing bottle service and reserved table in VIP (lower level). The upper level is not quite as small as the lower level VIP, and, forgive me Stone Lotus Fans for saying this, but despite many rave reviews respective to decor it's just not that spectacular (upper level). Sure it has water running down the face of a rough-textured granite tiled wall, but really...nothing jaw-dropping at all and you get over it in 2 minutes.  The lower ceilings on both floors also leaves one with a nearly claustrophobic in-a-basement feeling.  (This is the ONLY club in Chicago where I feel that way...and I have been to smaller venues). Anyway, the drinks while averaging about $15 a piece BEFORE TIP are well made, the bartenders are usually VERY quick in taking drink orders and serving (I've only ordered drinks in VIP, so cannot speak for service on the upper floor). Pros: Music, stiff drinks, trendy crowd. 3- 4 women to 1 man (in VIP), WOMEN are ALL 10's in VIP, cheap Valet or street parking.

2007-02-23,4.0,"Mixed review for Stone Lotus. This isn't a place I would frequent on my own. Velvet ropes, $20 cover, $9 well drinks. Not really me. At the same time, I am not SL's demographic. Velvet ropes, overweight middle aged guy, who's not getting in? Maybe if I worked at the Board of Trade or had just written a best selling novel. So Stone Lotus and I have an understanding. But if this was my kind of place, it would be 5 star. The space is beautiful. The posted pictures don't do it justice; check out the link to Dan G. photos in the Stone Lotus talk thread. There are two spaces: a long and narrow upstairs bar and a more intimate downstairs bar. ""Spa"" doesn't come immediately to mind, but the upstairs is pretty luxe. Dark walls dotted with craved stone lotuses, long sleek bar along one side, comfortable banquette fronted by low tables against the other. Red, black, and wood is the overall scheme. The wall behind the banquette is a ""water wall,"" and there are a couple of separate seating areas. The room is bigger than it seems -- at least it didn't feel packed last night. But on a busy weekend, I imagine it can get pretty bad. The downstairs bar is more intimate. Stone walls, couch seating, a smaller, brighter bar. I guess this is the ""private room"" (We took over the whole damn place), and it seems like it would be a great place for a party. In fact, I would gladly come back for a party. In either space. I found service attentive and friendly. The staff are all beautiful -- I imagine that's a requirement for working here. The secret service style bouncers were an interesting addition. It was like having cocktails with the mob. While I was downstairs, I overheard the manager asking one of the guests for feedback about the bar. He may have been trying to pick her up, but if not, I thought it was cool that he was taking to opportunity to find out what ""outsiders' thought of the place.

The decor was very swank, very zen, very calm, very chi-flowing.  The fries with the dip were DIVINE - so divine, it was difficult to get your hands on them if you weren't standing directly in front of the door where they made their debut.  I only had one dessert & it was good, nothing special, but it satisfied the sweet tooth nonetheless. We chose to just go with what we knew & didn't order off the drink menu.  The drinks were mostly ice, downed in a small amount of time, & not very potent, but that ended up being fine for two reasons: 1.  We didn't pay for them, & 2.  It prohibited me from becoming belligerent, which is always a good thing. The bartenders were very kind to us, smiling, & asking if they forgot our order (I'd rather they ask than get it wrong).

However, once inside I was very impressed with the entire place. Design was beautiful and atmosphere was very sexy. Great combination of loungey music and dance-worthy tunes. We went for a launch party of the new Absolut pear flavored vodka so drinks were free for the first hour and they had a bunch of special cocktails made up for the occasion, all of which were all absolutely delicious. I think what I liked most was the fact that everyone I came into contact with was very friendly -- the staff and the patrons. This was probably my biggest fear in coming here, that the people would be pretentious and snobby since this is the cool, trendy place to go right now, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find quite the opposite. Despite the fact that Stone Lotus is pretty small, my friend and I spent well over three hours there and were entertained the whole time. My only issue was the price; it's very easy to rack up a huge tab here if you're not careful, but all the same I can't wait to go back!",0.9926,0.755,0.216,0.029,0.6258339699516169
2007-01-06,5.0,"Fabulous atmosphere, good looking people, friendly owners/bartenders, fun music, creative drink choices... Sammy is right when he says this is the lounge to be at!  Stone Lotus is much swankier than the typical Chicago bar and perfect for a night out on the town.  Prepare to wait in line because word is out about this popular hot spot...",0.9717,0.685,0.315,0.0,0.6623376623376624
2007-01-03,4.0,"Apparently I have severe amnesia, but thought I had already reviewed this place. Went here for a company Christmas shindig, mostly for drinks after diner. Because we had table reservations, we were able to skip the line (which seemed slow-moving). Trendy, hip crowd, but very few Chad's and Trixie's, so a good first impression. Music was pretty good, and there were a few people grind-dancing near our table. Would go again, but expect to drop some cash with their bottle service prices.",0.9415,0.766,0.186,0.048,0.5034848484848485

2006-10-21,4.0,"Stone Lotus get s 4 stars for being a totally out of the place bar with a great little scene.  I love the downstairs, reminds me of the underbar, now all they need are secret little alcoves that are blocked off with curtains.. Hint hint!!!  The Stone Lotus is filled with a good mix of bourgeois and hipsters.  It's an oasis in the world of lounges in chicago. They are tolerant of dancing on tables and having a great time, i just wish they have a different DJ upstairs than downstairs.    PS, the bartenders are sweet! :)",0.9774,0.731,0.25,0.019,0.6916666666666668

Drinks are on the expensive side but the atmosphere is great. Good looking crowd, diverse, and music was hot. Decor is great. Love the waterfall on the wall.

2006-09-19,2.0,"By the time I got to this place I was ready to shoot myself.  Thankfully, it was my last stop.  Being dragged from one lounge to the next all night long, my lounge bashing will continue...  It's supposed to be the up and coming spot to be at.  I can always appreciate decor, whether it be eye-candy or the art work in the building itself.  I'd say that the interiors is beautiful, and that's about it.  You'll see stone lotuses, waterfalls, and pretty pink flowers in water back drops.  It's very nice environment to be in for a lounge.  One of my friends is a part shareholder, and could barely get in all the people he wanted on his list for his birthday.  That is kind of messed up, and that turns me off.  They have different music on different floors.  It all depends on what you like to hear.  With my luck, it will be too soon before I come to a place like this again.",0.9674,0.794,0.159,0.046,0.4974358974358974
2006-08-24,5.0,Right now it's the Lounge to be at...  The guys at the door let the good looking people in.  I personally like down stairs better than upstairs. I like the atmosphere and the music.  Service is tops.  From 11 to 1:30 it's my  current choice.    It can be tight and crowded.  Not for the bar crowd!  it's for The sexy lounge crowd!,0.9523,0.749,0.251,0.0,0.4887896825396825
2006-08-07,4.0,"Finally checked Stone Lotus out Friday night. Super swanky ""liquor-spa"" decor and extremely good-looking male bartenders provided lots of eye candy for my friend and I. The Zen-like design of the upstairs and downstairs bars are awesome- everything down to the 60-foot trickling water fall and wall details were extremely well-designed, very posh and tranquil. The crowd itself was a mixed one, but everyone seemed pretty chill. Our friend was DJ'ing, so the music was great! Be prepared to stand unless you have table bottle service. I would love to go back... it feels like nowhere else in the city that I have been. Of course it helps to know someone inside to avoid waiting in lines, but once you're in, it's very cool.",0.99,0.704,0.27,0.026,0.628611111111111
2006-07-18,1.0,"I'll keep it short and simple- this place bills itself as a ""liquor spa.""  If that term irritates you with its pretense and idiocy, so will this place.  If that term intrigues you with its suggestion of the possibility a Zen like realization of being one with the world by bringing the conscience self into alignment with the connectedness of the universe through alcohol consumption... go shoot yourself.",-0.1779,0.867,0.062,0.071,0.3523809523809524
2006-07-18,4.0,"Probably the finest regular hours lounge in Chicago right now....well actually this is probably the best lounge I have been to in recent memory...Focus is on service, not being snobby, and the ""bottle treatments"" are truly revolutionary.

2006-07-16,2.0,"Went to the bar Friday night.  My friend knew the bouncer, so we got right in without problems.  The decor inside is really nice.  I like the water wall and the lighting was really great.  The music was very disappointing, though.  The DJ (if there was one) skipped from 80's songs to contemporary rap and pop songs without good transitions.  I'm open to types of music played at bars, but stick at least a genre or time period, don't just jump around.  I can't complain too much though, cause I didn't spend a dime here, but I would not come back here unless it was the same situation.  I prefer to go to places where I like the music and can dance to it.",0.909,0.826,0.143,0.031,0.4715800865800866
