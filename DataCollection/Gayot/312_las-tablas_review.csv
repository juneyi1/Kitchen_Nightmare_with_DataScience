I was terribly sad to see all the food my parents and siblings ordered, not because it looked gross but I just recieved braces and my teeth were killing me!  I tried to savor all the flavors that lay before me but alas my teeth and gums were not having it. Anyways flash forward a year later, braces are off and we once again stopped by! it was a Friday night around 8p.m. I was surprised it wasn't very busy... oh well more food for us!  we ordered empanadas for our appetizers and they were steaming hot and cooked to perfection! the sauces that they gave us was so good my family and i couldn't get enough f it  I ordered the ""pollo relleno"" which is stuffed chicken with spinach and cheese, potato slices (2 big ones, or was it 3) small side salad and portion of rice and green sauce all over. the chicken was juicy and tender, cheese was oh so cheesy and I think the green sauce really brought all the flavors together. These are pretty big portions too. which is good because once you take it home you can taste it all again.  Our server was really nice but a few waiters were distracted by the soccer game playing on tv. as were my brother and father, regardless we didn't need to much service since we were all too busy savoring our food.  Prices are bit high but keep in mind the big portions they have, worth it in my opinion.  place was clean and had cute candles on every table. although we don't drink i did see a wide selection of drinks available and there was even an option to sit outside.  until next time! :)",0.9848,0.786,0.145,0.069,0.48850877192982445

I got the calamari as my second meat and it was damn good. My friend got the chicken breast and it was amazing!

When I brought it up to the waiter, who was very hard to even find in the first place, he mentioned that they had actually changed the ingredients in the salad and forgot to update the menu. I was brought a basic salad with nothing special in it like the menu had listed....Ok this was odd...how did he know I wouldn't have a food allergy to something that was not listed on the menu..anyhow ..we ended up ordering other food and it was just ok. Then when the bill came, we were actually charged $2 extra for the salad, that didn't even have the ingredients I wanted, than what was listed on the menu. Again, when I finally got the attention of the waiter, he said the price had changed as well and they forgot to update the menu. Whattt??? And instead of him apologizing and offering to take the extra charge off, he said his manager said there was nothing he could do about it and we d have to pay! Why should I have to negotiate the price of something that was changed, not updated on the menu, and wasn't even what I ordered in the first place? Shame on u las tablas.

We arrived maybe 3 min early and saw the staff setting up.  Opening time came and even though they knew we were there, they still opened a few minutes late.  Big deal? Absolutely not, but I would of thought the professional thing to do was to open up maybe, apologize because that they're re still setting up , ask customers to sit and instruct them that they would be let known when it was ready to start. (We were unaware of the brunch buffet, it was our first time and we were not there for it originally) Fast forward ... Once we're inside the male waiter seemed to have an attitude problem, he just looked very frustrated and was not helpful. Any question we made about the menu he answered very harshly, so we just decided to try the buffet, that way we had options. Now the food was very good. The meats, the sauces, the mushrooms, veggies, rice bread everything was perfectly seasoned, cooked and fresh. Everything was so filling too.  Ambiance is dark and relaxing, not loud ,but could get busy as the day progresses. Very inviting and even good for families. Brunch is a good thing to try if you're unsure on what to get.

My husband and I just  looked at each other as if we had inconvenienced him for being there. No suggestions from him or even a list of specials. Before he let us respond, he abruptly asked us to excuse him and he stared over across the room for a minute which was very strange and rude. This whole abrupt, and unengaging behavior went on for the entire evening. Thankfully we had been there before and it will not keep us from coming again.

The chimichurri was good. We got empanadas as appetizers and ceviche. The ceviche tasted wayyyyy too fishy. They served it with plantain chips, which I like. But the serving size was incredibly small. I have had colombian empanadas before, homemade by a friend. And las tablas empanadas were not even close. Tasted like something out of a freezer.

2016-12-17,2.0,"So I absolutely love Las Tablas and in the past I've had amazing experiences with the Lincoln ave location more than the Irving park location. However, tonight I went to the Lincoln ave location and ordered my usual, skirt steak. The steak came out and I was so excited I even took a picture. What I didn't notice was that pretty much half of the steak was fat. I was so disappointed. It was inedible. I waited and waited for Luis our server, to come around and ask if we were enjoying the meal....He NEVER checked on us to ensure satisfaction. So he finally came once we finished our food and I left the huge half of fat and Luis goes ""do you want a box?"" I inform him of the condition of my food and he goes ""oh I'm sorry."" Comes back with the check with the full amount. I'm livid I have big plans at this point to write a note on the back of the receipt explaining my discontentment and Luis's obvious lack of concern or care. Get this, I didn't even get to do it because Luis hovered over me as I fill in the tip amount and takes the check from me so fast and tells me to ave a good night. So let me get this straight. I couldn't find you the whole  time I ate but as soon as it's tipping time you're all over me like white on rice???

2016-11-25,5.0,"I came here a few weeks ago and was blown away by the service, as well as the quality of the food at Las Tablas.  To start off, Las Tablas comes off as a cozy, authentic, yet classy restaurant. I got to the restaurant earlier than the friend I was meeting up, but the hostess at the front was extremely accommodating and understanding and got me seated, while giving me a run-down of the menu. The entire time, I felt like the waiters/waitresses were very attentive. Whenever we asked for clarification about the menu and food (which meat was which, which sauce was which, etc...), we were provided with a thorough (and friendly) explanation. 5 stars for the service alone.  The food here was amazing. We got the Chorizo o Chicharron con Arepa with pork belly as an appetizer, as well as the Picada Colombiana to split as a main dish. The Picada Colombiana came as a massive plate filled with meat and sides, along with three different sauces. Even though it says the Picada Colombiana is for two, it could probably be split between three people - the portions are huge. Far and away the best meat on the plate was the skirt steak - tender, juicy, and flavorful. The ribs, rib-eye steak, and chorizo were also stand-outs. The sauces complemented the meats perfectly, and we even used the sauces with our appetizer, which I thought made the pork belly taste a lot better.  Overall, one of my favorite dining experiences in Chicago so far. I can definitely see myself returning sometime in the future!",0.9922,0.831,0.16,0.009,0.6743055555555557

They clearly stuck my whole plate in the oven because the potatoes were so hard and dried out I had to cut them with a steak knife. The steak was very fatty and flavorless.

Thirty minutes went by and my boyfriend still didn't receive his drink nor had anyone came back to our table at all. After about forty minutes of waiting we flagged down a waitress and asked where his drink and our appetizer were. She said she would take care of it. Our original waiter came over and apologized. He explained that their Point of Sale system was down and that they were having to do everything by hand. To me that's not even a viable excuse for why it takes 40 minutes to get a drink but had it been true I might be more forgiving. The catch; we were seated by the register and had been watching them print out receipts and enter information the entire time. If there is one thing I don't appreciate more than any other thing it would be being lied to. It just keeps getting worse at this point. Would anyone care to explain how a table that came in after us was served their food, ate, paid and was out the door before we even got a drink? We eventually got his drink and then they bring out two empanadas. We ordered the sample plater which was supposed to have two of each: beef, chicken and cheese. Our waiter then brings back that plate and brings out another one so we dig in. A few minutes later he brings out two more saying that the first plate only had beef and cheese. Now wouldn't you think that you would apologize and explain that the other ones were coming out shortly to begin with. Eventually we got our food and ate quickly. The portion sizes where great and the food itself was pretty good. At this point though we had been there for an hour and 45 minutes and were ready to go.

No problem!  We packed our bottles of wine and drove the hour to the city.  When we arrived at 7:30 (to an unusually empty restaurant for a Saturday) the manager was telling my friend that there was no way that anyone told her that there was a cork fee.  He said that they are not BYOB at all on Fri and Sat.   When she said that *someone* gave her this information and she didn't just make it up, he said that it would have only been either him or the owner and he would never have said that. He basically argued with her for 10 minutes instead of trying to make some accommodation to make us happy.

When I first started coming here, about 3 years ago, the portions were much larger and service was great. It was one of my favorite places to eat! That quickly changed after a recent incident at this location. Me, my boyfriend and his family decided to have dinner on what turned out to be a not so busy night. Everything was fine until we received our food and my boyfriend's steak was no where near cooked and he asked that it be returned to the grill to cook a bit longer (he asked for well-done and it came out almost rare). As the night continued he still did not receive the piece of steak even after asking for it several times. Nearly 40 minutes later, the waitress finally brought the steak back, but by this point we had all finished eating and my boyfriend no longer wanted the food. At that point we told the waitress we wanted to speak to a manager because we refused to pay for something he did not eat! To our surprise the waitress explained that no manager, supervisor or anyone in charge was working that night and therefore the charge could not be removed from the receipt. Since we had been to this location several times we all recognized the owner who was sitting behind the counter watching the whole situation unfold and then he proceeded to take pictures of us at the table! Then the owner and the guys behind the counter (cooks/workers) started to make comments towards us, further escalating the situation. Completely rude and unprofessional! At the end of the night the waitress said she would pay for the meal we did not eat, out of her own pocket, which again proves how horrible management is!

Appropriately dim lighting (but no too dim).  Tall windows run on either side of dining area, so during daylight hours plenty of natural light come in.  Up front, near the door, they have a bar area set up if you would like to just have a few drinks.  Flat screens are set on an appropriate sporting event, usually soccer.   THE FOOD-  Amazing.  Delicious huge portions and all at a great price.  I have had Bandeja Paisa every time I've been there (I know, I know, but its so GOOD).  Bandeja Paisa is Char-broiled, Colombian-style cut rib-eye steak served with fried pork belly, chorizo, rice, beans, fried egg, sweet plantain and avocado.  Steak juicy and a little salty, just like I like it.  Pork belly crisp like thick bacon.  Always room for a fried egg.  The plantain is delicious, if you never had one you're missing out on life.  And I love avocado.  Its almost like multiple meals in one.  Beans and rice simple, hearty and good, as the should be. My meal was tasty, filling, and easy on the wallet.  Loved it.  My only gripe would be about the juices.  Colombians like juices, like Passion Fruit, and they whip them up into some frothy, refreshing, fruity drinks.  Unfortunately the past couple of times we've been there they've not had a working blender.  Really?  Can't walk down to CVS and pick on up?  Oh well, the incredible meal and merry service overbalance the missing option for fruit drinks.    I fully recommend you go, whether you are married to a Colombian or not.  I don't think you will regret it! Julie's View- (BASED ON A SCALE 1-10) Ambiance: 7 -Not fancy by all means considering the Colombian style, it is more of a      family-comfortable place to eat. Food taste: 8 - The Vandeja Paisa is the go to dish. However, the ajiaco, sancocho de res o   pollo is also really good, the Empanadas ... well being from Colombia i am quite critical so no i pass on the empanadas.. sure they will taste good and be different if you haven't try them before but once you know what an empanada SHOULD TASTE LIKE then you will kn ow what i mean hehehhe. Price: 5 ( $$)   portions are HUGE Food presentation: 6 Dress code: Casual  Note: Restrooms are downstairs - I recommend to be cautions specially if you have any mobility issues.

In addition, the service that particular night took forever, which really took away from the whole night.

2016-05-23,4.0,"Went for a birthday dinner and they accommodated a 20 person group, which is no easy feat in itself.  More than that, everyone seemed happy, so yay!  The meal did take a LONG time, but I suppose with that many people, it should be expected. For my meal, I started with a blackberry mojito (yum!), and then rather than ordering an entree, I got two appetizers (a crab and shrimp ceviche and the grilled baby octopus) and a side of plaintain (because it's basically my favorite thing ever). The ceviche was fine, but nothing worth writing home about, but the pulpitos were perfectly grilled without a bit of that rubbery texture that you get at a lot of places and came with a nice salad, as well.  And fried plantains are hard to screw up, but they were delicious as ever here!  I mis-ordered my dessert, so while I didn't love it, that was on me, not on the restaurant.  And I saw enormous platters of meat up and down the table that everyone seemed happy with. Las Tablas isn't cheap, but they do what they do well and are great for a group.  Would definitely recommend.",0.9921,0.721,0.227,0.052,0.6756944444444444

We did order some chicken and it was also delicious. My favorite thing from here I would say was the Mojitos. They were made to Perfection and they were not too skimpy on the alcohol.  the server did the best he could because they were understaffed. He was also working as the bartender. We went on a Monday evening with No Reservations. Had no problem being seated right away. I really like their sauces. They go well with pretty much everything they serve here. I do recommend this place for large groups of people. I saw that there was three or four really big groups sitting in the dining area.

Love the empanadas although they have been shrinking in size over the years, mixed grill meats with seafood and white rice. The grilled meats are perfectly cooked as well as the seafood. To me, this is better than the typical Brazilian steakhouse because I get to take home leftovers! When you order the mixed grill the only thing missing is the white rice which they will cook perfectly each and every time for an additional charge.  One big minus here is the price of cocktails which are not masterfully created yet charge as if they are.  Either higher a very good mixologist (aka bartender) or lower the price of your cocktails. Also, I do miss when they used to serve fresh figs (not from a jar) with delicious Colombian caramel (dulce de leche).  Although prices have edged up, I have never had a bad experience here.

Group member who received food last also received the wrong order and so that person had to wait another 10 minutes. The server also looked at that person as if he told him the wrong order to begin with - not true as rest of the party were witnesses! Completely unacceptable.  - Pregnant lady in our party asked for steak to be well done. Sure enough it came out medium to medium rare.

On the show it was mentioned that the most popular dish was the skirt steak. They showed how they made it and I was sold! So we decided to go last night (12/11/11). I was worried that arriving 10 minutes before closing time, that  they may have not let us in, or that they may have a slight attitude. Fortunately, I WAS WRONG! The host was super friendly, and didn't seem to care about our late arrival. Once seated, we were greeted immediately. Our waiter POLITELY told us to chose a dish soon since the kitchen would be closing shortly. Because it was our first time, we ordered strictly from the recommendations of our waiter.  We started with FRESH FRUIT  Mojitos. I had kiwi and my boyfriend had strawberry. The kiwi was delicious! Very light and refreshing. For an appetizer, we had the combo plate of empandadas that included chicken, beef, and cheese.  Ummm.....they were O-KAY. Nothing really spectacular to me. But when the waiter brought our skirt steak dinners.....OMG. They  were served on a skillet, still cooking! I couldn't wait to cut into mine. My first bite was very juicy and flavorful. That was a GREAT skirt steak cooked to perfection. It was served with sweet plantain, yuka, and baked potato. Great combo! And their spicy salsa paired great with EVERYTHING. I had to try one more mojito- Mango. Sooooo good. Chunks of rum soaked sweet mango waited for me at the bottom once I finished my drink. #Winning.

My girlfriend and I shared a couple empanadas and ordered the meat platter. We went on a weekday which meant we were allowed to bring a bottle of wine for a $10 corking fee, which was awesome.  We shared beef empenada's which were delicious, especially when soaked in their incredible chimichuri sauce. The platter was delicious, but, next time I'd rather just order the skirt steak and chicken which were the two stars of the platter alongside some yucca.  One thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that the chorizo was missing off the plate. We didn't even notice, but the server pointed it out and said he'd get us more but never did. Also, my girlfriend and I had pretty bad stomach aches after the fact, but that may have been because we ate so much.  One thing I really liked was that they had an incredibly friendly host who seemed to have special needs. He did a great job and it was great to see the restaurant supporting him with a job.

You're not just getting some arms here- you're getting the full baby. A full family of babies. Pretty cute- pretty morbid as well. They offered us choices of four different desserts and as there were four of us, we thought we should try all of them: tres leches cake, chocolate mousse, coconut flan, and oreo cake. As un-colombian as it was, I liked the oreo cake the best, although all four desserts were exceptional and you couldn't go wrong. The chocolate mousse is extremely dense and rich though, so make sure you share that one! The restaurant is very warm and welcoming on the inside, with really nice and attentive service.

I get that they have a full bar. Being a former restaurant owner/operator myself I get that we're in business to make a profit and everyone needs to eat. $15 per bottle cork fee is amusing to me. Are they in the business of making a profit from food or $15 per bottle cork fee? I'm not going to bother reviewing service nor food. Wising managers/owners of Las Tablas a prosperous year end especially for their servers with there new $15 per bottle cork fee policy. Thank you for reading.,0.955,0.82,0.163,0.017,0.5298701298701299

I placed my dinner order through Grub Hub and when I determined that not everything that I had ordered was included I contacted Grub Hub customer service, via their web form. Not hearing from them for approximately 10 minutes, I telephoned Grub Hub customer service. They then contacted the restaurant and the Las Tablas flatly refused to correct the problem. Grub Hub 'generously' gave me $5 credit for a ruined dinner, (gotta love those  guys, but don't have to do so much business with them anymore). When I called the restaurant and explained what had gone wrong, again they refusal to correct the problem.

Reservations were made for 7pm and were honored and on time for seating.  We were waiting for one other couple so we ordered a pitcher of sangria and some appetizers.  The empanadas were good and the sangria was as well.   However that was where it all ended.  We were curious about the chorizo corn bread and asked our waiter.  He explained , in limited ability, that the were circular and smaller.  We also assumed that from his explanation that it was your typical corn bread with chorizo. Not so.  First the chorizo is a link and not part of the corn bread at all. Second the corn bread was not bread at all but more like a flat cake and not what you would expect.  Yes you expect a different type of food but this is why we asked the waiter.   Finally our next couple arrived and we were waiting to order another round of drinks. And we waited.  The time to order and the time to get to our table was fifteen minutes.  Most of the meal our drinks were  empty.  Two drinks was all most of us had.   On top of poor service with the drinks at one point our dishes were stacked for our table to be cleared.  The waiter came to the end of the table dropping off a drink and left all the dishes just sitting there. Whether you have different staff/roles a waiter is ultimately responsible and should not have just ignored the dishes.  The food, it was okay.  The steak that everyone raved about was okay.  It wasn't anything special that you couldn't do yourself.  Which is what our overall impression was of this restaurant.  Especially when the check took 20 minutes after they took our payment.  Lets just say the elevator ride up to the roof and back down was more exciting and the check was still MIA after that.  Had this not been a special occasion I probably would have mentioned this to the manager.  I even thought about writing a letter but ultimately this is not a place where you can't get similar food (if not cook it at home) with better service.  So while it was nice to try some place new it would not be a place I would go back to.",0.9735,0.852,0.107,0.041,0.4713811042758411

They are no longer BYOB, but people kept making the mistake of bringing stuff in.  On to the food, everything I retried was savory and delicious. We started with empanadas and grilled calamari. Both of which were fantastic.  For my meal I ordered the chicken with spinach and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the recommended steak specialty. While both were good, I would say go with the steak. I kept stealing bites off his throughout dinner.  Writing this is really making me crave that steak! Yummmmy! The service was fantastic, friendly and speedy.

Let me point out that we were the first people there. Okay.  We were seated, and the place was empty. I thought we should be eating in no time. WRONG! it took our waiter about 10-15 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink.  Other guests had started to arrive and there were about 20 people in total in Las tablas.  They received there beverages before us! And may I repeat that we came first! So then we just brushed off our anger and gave the guy some slack since he was working by himself, but thought that he should be used to this amount of people in the resturant. So we then order some empinadas we get the chicken and cheese. They weren't that great, your better off making them yourself.  Now let me tell you the most disgusting part!! As we're eating I noticed by the door where the food comes out from (note: it was my first time at las tablas) I saw plastic bags up. Indicating to me that they're doing some type of construction. Interesting I thought. I told myself there is no way in hell that my food is going to come out of there.  Then we see a man dressed in construction   clothes covered in dirt  walks in carrying  these water holes. And I thought they better not. And yes my friends they do! THEY START SAND BLASTING THE DANG FLOORS!! While customers are waiting on there food.  How disgusting! Me and my uncle were flipping out when we saw white dirt dust flying  up in the air! (Note: sand blasting is water pressure used to clean the floor whether there be grease, dirt, etc. that dirt is the water FYI and turns into vapor) and the food comes out of there. Im dying at this point and want to slap someone! An hour has  now passed by and we still haven't received  our food. At this point were grossed out and no longer want to eat there. We call the waiter over. My uncle tells him that what they are doing is so unprofessional and gross! And that what they are doing can get there restaurant closed! My uncle is an INSPECTOR! BTW  The waiter calls his manager and my uncle talks to him complaining. The manager doesn't care what the problem was about. And says sorry there's nothing he can do.They still made us pay for our drinks which cost $2.00 for a can of pop! And the empinadas. This place was absolutely horrible, horrid, rude, unprofessional, and absolutely disgusting.  I highly recommend that you don't eat there. Not just for incident, but for that fact that the manager doesn't give a crap about the customers, and that my friends says enough about Las Tablas.   Note: we were there for a total of 2 hours!!!!

However, consistency is a big thing for me and Las Tablas is maddeningly inconsistent. When the food is on it's on and there isn't a dish I'd rather have. I usually order the Bandeja Paisa (Columbian Mountain Platter) which is basically a steak dish with beans, rice, avocado, plantains, corn bread, fried egg and some sort of fried pork. Well, I should mention that's what the menu advertises. There has been numerous times where they've ran out of avocado. You don't realize that until you get your plate. The servers act like nothing's wrong until you ask. I've also ordered the grilled baby octopus (terrible) as it was chewy and burnt. I know this comes off as harsh but I go back in hopes of capturing that deliciousness that I remember and they still offer from time to time. If I knew I could go in there and it would be the same every time I'd probably go a lot more. If you are gonna give it a try, which I recommend you do at least twice, I highly recommend going to the one on Lincoln. The location on Irving is bigger but on Saturday nights it's obnoxiously loud and the dining experience isn't pleasant as you'll probably leave with a headache due to the live music.",0.6754,0.872,0.075,0.053,0.5033333333333333

2014-03-08,3.0,"For a Zagat-rated restaurant, I'm wondering who is employed at Zagat and how they rate food. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed my food at Las Talbas, while I was eating it. I was fortunate to dine here on a wednesday evening. Thank goodness there was no wait time and we pretty much had our free reign over where we sat. They tried to seat my friend and I next to drafty windows, and we weren't having it! The restaurant was authentic enough; meaning whoever designed the interior made a strong effort to make everything look rustic yet sterile. The floors were tile, which probably makes for easy clean up. Think Casron Pirie Scott's representation of Columbian decor. For dinner, I had the Plato Combinado, featuring your choice of two different meats, served with sweet plantain, yuca, and potato. For my meats, I chose my two favorites: skirt steak and baby octopus. I've never experienced such food bliss. The octopus was crisp on the edges without being too stiff or gelatinous in the middle. The grilled flavor beaconed spring and brighter days to follow. Pink on the inside, without being too rare, the skirt steak was surrounded with same level of crispiness found on the octopus. Both meats were salted, buttered, and enhanced with just enough garlic as to not overpower their true flavors. On the side, the waiter brought two different kinds of salsas, one mild and one spicy. I ended up mixing them together because separately their core flavors did not do well. Then I slathered my sides with them. Once I realized how tasty they were, I also put it all over the rest of my skirt steak. The baby octopus was gone in two seconds. I wouldn't have disrespected such a delicacy in the first place! One thing that always unnerves me about any Hispanic, Spanish, or South American restaurant: the mojito/margarita fail. Las Talbas does not make a mojito fit for any of these cultures. It wasn't sweet enough. Certainly strong enough, but I wasn't exactly looking to paint the town red on a wednesday night. I had two anyway. The best mojito I've ever had was at the top of the W Hotel location right on Lake Michigan. I'm beginning to think that fresh ginger is the key to making this cocktail ""pop."" I allow my inner girlie girl to step out when it comes to mojitos. I expect a mint ginger sugar salad with lots of rum, gosh darn it! It took everything I had not to regress into a tantrum. Just kidding. Overall I would have had nothing truly negative to say about Las Talbas. My issue with the restaurant happened after I left, and my experience the next morning. Everything that exited all of my orifices reeked of garlic for almost two days! It was disgusting! I try to eat healthy and confess that I had nothing but healthy meals for two weeks. Perhaps going straight into such a heavy meal, and eating like a pig, did not agree with my body. Kind of like people who go through rehab, and then experience severe consequences when they relapse. Perhaps this was nature's way of telling me to do away with my inner foodie. You know what? You only live once, and I am not about to give up on my love for all kinds of food! I just think I'll consider this experience should the opportunity to visit this place presents itself once more.

2013-12-13,5.0,"Las Tablas es BUENO! I came to Las Tablas last Saturday night for a girlfriend's surprise 30th birthday.  There were t-shirts and table confetti.  For which Las Tablas was extremely accommodating. We were a bit anxious to be seated a few minutes past our reservation time, but that was only because we were afraid the birthday girl would walk in while we were all standing in the lobby.  Luckily, we were able to stall her driver, and any other time, waiting a few minutes past the reservation would not have been a problem, especially for a group of 10 semi-rowdy ladies. We were seated near the window at a long table, which was the one downside for me, but that's always the way with large groups, one side of the table can't have a conversation with the other.  Our server was generous with the water, menu explanations, and his patience, as ten indecisive ladies tried to make up their mind with the fantastic menu selections. I loved that the ""specialties"" section of the menu reads ""Our most enthusiastic recommendations and top-rated items.""  Well, yes, I definitely had to order something from there. I would not recommend a vegetarian attempt to come in for a meal at Las Tablas, because the menu is very meat-centric (many steaks, pork, chicken, some seafood.) I ordered a Combinacion - from their specialties menu, of Entrana skirt steak (a house specialty) and grilled baby octopus.  All dishes come with yuca, plantain, and potato. For $21, the amount of food on my plate was very impressive.  I could've made more than one meal out of it, if I wasn't such a boom boom.  There was a HUGE portion of steak (a full portion for sure, no half portion because this was a combo) and no less than six baby octopus.  I was at first a little weirded out that there were WHOLE baby octopii on my plate, but got over it after tasting one bite. Between the chimmichuri and spicy chimmichuri (I can't remember what the spicy sauce was called...) everything was perfect.  The steak and octopus were perfectly cooked and seasoned, tender and juicy. The price was definitely right!  For 10 ladies, all having entrees, two bottles of wine for the table, I think we got out of there for $37-$40 per person (this also included covering the birthday girl's dinner.) Las Tablas is definitely a place I'd go back to for a date night, girls night, any night!",0.9958,0.806,0.156,0.038,0.5475544481358434

The skirt steak is by far the best meat there. Others were very good too but the steak was numero uno. Empanadas are also good though I much preferred the beef to the chicken. Didn't try the cheese empanada which was probably also a winner. Service was pretty good. Nice ambiance. A little on the pricey side but probably typical for Lakeview - $8 cocktails, $7 sangria glasses, per person entrees are between $15-$25 I believe.

2013-10-20,1.0,"Can you say ""POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE""?? How poor was it? So poor that I, for one, will NEVER return.  Had reservations there last night with a group of 11. I arrived late for the res, as did others, no fault of the restaurant. What was their fault was how poorly they handled the customers they had in front of them.  The waiter took my drink order and 15-20 minutes went by before he came over to say they needed to split our table for other guests. We assured him the others were coming, in fact we were waiting for two who texted they were parking their car. He went away and came back with the manager who also said they needed to split our table. Mind you, there was NO ONE waiting at the host station at this time. Mind you, I still had not gotten my drink yet either. How long does it take to pour a glass of wine? Having bartended previously, I can assure you a matter of seconds. We felt pressured to acquiesce since they kept insisting and our other group members were pretty late. We crammed 7 people uncomfortably into the larger part of the table which immediately began to annoy us. Withing 5 minutes of splitting our table, two tables cleared out in our section (and were still empty when we walked out 10 minutes later). We agreed that we were uncomfortable and the service was unreasonably slow so we decided to leave. A couple of the ladies at the table began to tell the waiter we wanted our check over the whole table splitting issue, but I piped in and said the service was simply too slow. The waiter replied, ""I don't speak English"" and walked away. Really now?  In addition to taking forever to get one lousy drink, the waiter failed to ask if I wanted any appetizer or anything during the 45 minutes I was there. Come on Las Tablas, you have customers in front of you RIGHT NOW, you take care of those customers before worrying about ones who haven't yet to materialize in your establishment requiring a table. Additionally, there was a nail or something sharp protruding from the front left corner of my chair. As we left, there was no one at the host station, nor that manager who needs training in customer service as well, around to tell. Hopefully no one else gets hurt on it, because they might be told by their waiter that he doesn't speak English! And for such poor quality customer serve, they sure are pricey.

The matrimonio (grilled skirt steak and chicken) entree has gotten even better (I didn't know that was possible). The meats are perfectly seasoned with lots of flavor; the skirt steak is no longer pounded out, but instead grilled till tender and juicy.  I liked it before, but it's even better now.  Service did a great job of refilling sauces, water, taking new drink orders, and just making sure everything was going smoothly.  I'm already planning my next visit and my mouth is watering.",0.9863,0.769,0.205,0.026,0.6186167227833895

That plus an additional appetizer fed 2 hungry people and 2 not quite hungry people with a bit left over. That should give you an idea of how large the portion sizes are.  For appetizers we had the empanadas and the grilled mariscos. The empanadas are slightly smaller than regular empanadas, but still pretty sizable and come with six. The grilled mariscos are FABULOUS. Seriously, the grilled octopus was the best thing I ate that night and the best octopus I've had ever. Smoky, slightly briny, but not fishy, and not at all chewy. And everything else was smoky and tasty and perfectly cooked. For the entree we had the combination 1 with the steak and more mariscos. Again, yes yes yes to that octopus. They do not skimp on the seafood either. And the steak was well seasoned and juicy. It came with yucca, which is kind of like yam or a slightly sweeter and less starchy potato, and plantain. We also had the Bandeja Paisa, which came with a rib-eye, fried pork belly, rice, beans, and this tasty piece of bread. The bread was a little bit like pancake, but not as sweet. I rather liked the steak but I think I preferred the skirt steak that came with the Combination plate (though I prefer juicier cuts of steak in general). And the beans were delicious. The fried pork belly was almost overcooked and hard to eat. But otherwise a great meal. For dessert, we had the coconut creme brulee and the tres leches cake. Creme brulee was great. Not heavy on the coconut flavor, but the coconut definitely made the dish richer and more indulgent. But OH. DEAR. GOD.

2013-08-02,4.0,"Fantastic food, some of the best in Chicago. I'm a self proclaimed steak connoisseur, and there are VERY few places that I feel can cook up a steak tastier than what I can do on my own grill. However, this is definitely one of those places. The Entrana is simply spectacular. And it is always cooked perfectly, regardless of how you like it. I've also had the carne asada, but even carne asada fans will probably like the Entrana better. If you like more variety, get the Matrimonio, which is the steak and chicken. Serving sizes are HUGE and very well priced.  Drinks are also delicious. I highly recommend the caipirinha, and the mojitos are incredible as well. The only minor drawback was the service.

I first went to the one off of Irving Park and my friend and I were seated by the round window in the front. Live music was about to start when we were ordering. The food was yummy. I am unfortunately lactose intolerant, so some of the items on the Colombian menu don't work well in my stomach anymore which saddens me. I ordered Patacon Pisao and when I received it to my dismay it was covered in cheese. I told the waiter and at first he seemed reluctant to help me out but he spoke to the manager and they gave me a new dish.  The second time I went to the Lincoln Ave location. Different setup, but still very nice. I brought my parents with me who immediately started criticizing the place because there were no actual Colombian people on the weight staff. I can remember my dad even saying ""none of these Mexicans know how to cook Colombian food."" They ordered and we got the food pretty promptly. Boy, did their reactions change!

I ALWAYS order the combination (combinaciones) with the entraña and something else. Usually I'll order it with baby octopus, but sometimes with calamari. But definitely get the entraña! The combination comes with sweet plantain, yuca, and potato. I always substitute the yuca and potato for rice since I don't like those starches.. I love mixing the chimichurri sauce with the rice and then eat it with the meat. My mouth is salivating just thinking about this! I've had the empanadas and the arepa appetizers.

The drinks were great, and the combination empanadas plate was a great starter, complete with a fresh salad tossed in a tangy vinaigrette.  Bathroom break: THE BATHROOMS ARE PHENOMENAL. Ryan and I shared a recommended Colombian skirt steak and chicken dish that came on a sizzling skillet with fried yuca and a sweet plantain on the side. DELICIOUS. The chicken was so tender, juicy and well seasoned, and the steak blew me away. I'm not a huge steak kind of girl, but I couldn't get enough. Grab the meat off the skillet right away to get the temperature right, leaving it on the skillet will allow it to continue cooking. Our server was very helpful but never too pushy.

2012-10-16,3.0,"I have to start this off by saying that I'm Colombian so my opinion of this place is based on comparing it to other Colombian food places and Colombian food in general.  First off, they have really updated (and moved) the restaurant and the decor is very nice.  I like it because it shows a lot about Colombian culture. The Botero paintings hanging up around the restaurant are nice too. The food? Meh.  I've been to cheaper Colombian restaurants (admittedly with less ambiance and decor) that have tastier steak.  I have tried a LOT of things on the menu throughout the years and some are good. The bandeja paisa is pretty spot on. I like the grilled sea food platters too because they just taste so good.  But this place is supposed to be a steakhouse and the steak just falls flat.  The seasoning is bland  and there is nothing about the steak that just stands out.   For what they charge, I would expect a tastier peice of meat.  Other offerings on the menu:  Empanadas are pretty good but not very traditional (feel more like fusion empanadas).  The drinks are good but not very strong.  The buenelos there were stale the two times I ordered them (though they tasted pretty good).    Also, service is slow.  I know this is more of a culture thing but then don't charge me $25 for a plate if you can't provide decent service.  I guess where this place falls flat for me is the price vs the food.  With the decor and what they charge, I'm thinking that the meat will be solid.  But its not. Other dishes are good but trust me, a lot of the food there is considered ""cheap"" food in Colombia,  something you wouldn't pay a lot for.  Patacon, arepa, yuca frita, frijoles, bandeja paisa.... these are things you can get for pretty cheap other places so while they are good here, the fact that they charge you more here turns me off.  Again, its a pretty place but if I want a great Colombian meal, I can save my money and go to Sabor a Cafe and still get just as good of a meal.",0.996,0.811,0.176,0.013,0.5773954116059379

I couldn't believe what I had spit out in a napkin.

He kinda apologized and we ordered a salad and arepa because my stomach was just upside down at that point. The manager was never sent to our table....the parrillada was taken off our bill and there was no discount on anything or any other incentive to try to get us to come back. This is absurd and being that my family has had restaurants forever, we still cant understand how the F$#@ this is even possible. I'm debating calling the health department because this is dangerous and ABSURD in the restaurant business.

2012-08-13,4.0,"Let's be clear; throw a rock from anyplace in the city, and you're sure to hit a steakhouse. There's not a lot of ways to differentiate all of them from each other. After dining at Las Tablas this past Saturday, this place was somehow special.  The restaurant's specialty dish is the Entrana: a juicy cut of skirt steak served with sweet plantain, fried yuca and Colombian style potato. I saw it being made via a clip on their website and decided to give it a try. It didn't disappoint. My sisters dined on the churrasquito (NY strip steak with the same sides as mine) and the Bandeja Paisa (rib-eye steak served with fried pork belly, rice, beans, fried egg, sweet plantain and avocado). I think I found my next dish to try for my next visit!.  Waiting for our order, you also can't help noticing the artwork along the walls in the restaurant. There were various portraits of people in different corners-I didn't know who they were, but they were interesting to look at. Another interesting tidbit: on the back of the menu, you can read of the story of how the restaurant was built: how the owners struggled making a living when they first set foot in the city, the fire that destroyed their first restaurant, and how they rebuilt in the restaurant's current location. The chairs and tables were handmade in Columbia and brought into the restaurant. The three of us declared our waiter as a guy who truly loved his job. He took time to tell us about the menu; served our food with a minimal wait time, and checked in with us throughout the night. He noted that the rub that is used in the Entrana dish is made with ingredients that only the owner and the son know. Interesting.  A truly enjoyable experience; there's no doubt that this is once place I would go back to.",0.9586,0.831,0.112,0.057,0.4400132275132274

The restaurant is huge and when my friend and I arrived, we were told we could sit wherever we wanted and that was great for us, but not so much for the ONE server that was working! There were five tables with customers and we were all seated pretty far apart from one another which made the service...messy. Now the good parts and there were many of them. Our server, Adnan was friendly and very personable. Since it was out first time there, he made several (excellent) recommendations and we were very pleased with his picks. We ordered the sampler of empanadas and they were crispy and delicious. We were told most people liked the beef, but we liked the beef and cheese and LOVED the chicken.The empanadas came with a bowl of chimichurri and another yummy side that I never caught the name of that was fantastic.  We also ordered the combination skirt steak (medium,natch) and shrimp skewer which also came with potato, yuka (is that spelled right?),and plantain. My stomach is growling just thinking about it! For dessert we had the cocoa flan.Let me just say this,it was beyond sinful, it was beyond yum it was fan-**cking-tastic!

The other 2 are one of the best in the city. The food both times was really good, although the second time our waitress kept messing up our order.  The second time we came in was during lunch. I've done a lot of restaurant mystery shopping, so I'm used to looking at the clock and seeing how long everything takes. First of all we tried calling to see what time they opened for lunch. No one ever answered the phone. One time they answered but immediately hung up. We called the other restaurant for the phone number of the owner. We called him and he confirmed that the restaurant was open for business. When we got there, we stood at the hostess stand for 9 minutes before anyone even looked at us to acknowledge we were there. Had we not had a Groupon, we would have left for sure. We walked in the door at 12:30, sat down at 12:39 (only because we finally asked if we should seat ourselves) and then weren't approached to order until 12:51. That's completely ridiculous.  We ordered 6 empanadas and didn't want chicken since they aren't that good. They still gave us one chicken, but we just ate it and didn't say anything. They were short staffed, but they should have at least said something to us. There were only 8 tables seated.  Anyway, the food is really good, service pretty much stinks. Both times we dined there we had to wait awhile for someone to acknowledge us. That's supposed to be your first impression of the restaurant. Not good. I honestly don't know if I will go back again. They need to hire someone to do mystery shopping so that the owner really knows whats going on in there.  Other than the chicken empanada, the food really is good.

Literally every time I dined at Las Tablas (honestly, at least 30 times during the nine years I lived in Chicago) we started with Arepa Chorriada, which is a wonderful corn-type bread with melted cheese and criolla.  It's made even more lovely with a little chimichurri on the side.   I then almost always ordered the Matrimonio (a mix of entrana skirt steak and pollo al ajillo)...it's served on the cutest wood board (hence, las tablas) and accompanied with the sweetest plantain and yummiest yuca and potato.  Again, chimichurri here just enhances every bite.

2012-06-17,1.0,"Las Tablas Ruined Father's Day. We will NEVER be coming back. So me and my girlfriend ate at Las Tablas a few weeks ago and thought it would be a good place to take her father for Father's Day. We heard they had a great brunch buffet and decided to definitely go with Las Tablas. The Friday before Father's Day I decided to call Las Tablas and ask them about their Brunch Buffett. They were kind enough to tell me all the incredible things that were included in the brunch buffet. I told them I was sold and asked them if we could make reservations SPECIFICALLY for the brunch buffet. They said yes and gave me a reservation for 1:00pm on Sunday. The Saturday prior to our reservation I thought to ask if we could still order off the menu ON TOP of the brunch buffet and they said yes. Please make note that I phrased my question as ""Hi, I made a reservation for the brunch buffet tomorrow (Sunday). Can I still order off the regular menu with the brunch buffet?"" This will be important to remember in my next paragraph. So Father's Day arrives and my girlfriend's parents meet us at the restaurant. It's an hour away from where they live. As we walk into the door we see a handwritten sign that there will be ""No Buffet"" today and are immediately confused. We walk up to the host who is on the phone. The host doesn't even acknowledge our presence and continues to talk to the person on the phone. Even if he was on the phone with a customer he should have taken a second to say ""I apologize, I'll be with you in a second."" Another host arrives for her shift and finally asks if we can be helped. I tell her about our reservations and immediately ask for clarity on the brunch buffet due to the sign on the door. I tell her I asked SPECIFICALLY about the buffet and that I only made reservations BECAUSE of the buffet. She goes to ask someone and comes back to tell me ""sorry, we don't have the buffet today. There must have been some confusion or miscommunication."" This was insulting. What confusion could there have been? I called TWICE about the brunch buffet!  So they did not offer us anything for ""miscommunicating"" to me that there was going to be a brunch buffet and all they could offer us was the table I reserved, which really wouldn't have mattered since there was no one in the restaurant at 1:00pm on a weekend. Hmmm, I wonder why it's so empty. We told her that this was very upsetting and that we don't even know if we want to come back. Obviously our business doesn't mean much to them because even while we threatened to leave they did not do ANYTHING to make it right. Because it must be US who got it wrong. We told them we were leaving and we left to eat somewhere else.  I don't appreciate being called ""confused"" because I know these things happen and that's why I asked for clarity TWICE. The only people who are confused are the staff at Las Tablas. Horrible customer service.

But I hosted a dinner here for the first time, last week.  A month prior to the event date, I called to confirm a party of 20 for 8pm.  I was told they could accomodate me, and they took the reservation.  Fast forward to the day before the event.  I get a phone call from Las Tablas.  When I answer, I'm told that the person on the phone just wanted to confirm the reservation and make sure nothings changed as far as number of guests, time, etc.  I reply no, and this person begins to ask me for a credit card number.  I'm sorry, what's that for?  ""If any of your guests are more than 15 minutes late, we're going to charge you $10 per person that is late.""  You're kidding right?  Got kind of upset with this ridiculous demand and nearly cancelled dinner altogether.  I told her I refuse to give her my credit card number this late in the game, because had this been something I was asked about when I made the reservation, I would have said okay, heres my CC #, and then I would have changed the time of the event to 6 pm.  Is it really worth it to a restaurant to try to stick it to a customer for $10 per how ever many heads are late, versus the $650 dinner tab you might possibly miss out on ? Guess who was late to dinner folks. Yes, it is I, guilty as charged.  I fought traffic for 2 hours to get there, got sucked into a Ribfest traffic mess...tollway jam....just a peachy commute.  My portion of the party showed up, and immediately upon entering, our server offered to take the birthday cake from me and put it in the fridge.  Started the night off with a regular Mojito, good as usual, my wife, Britt C. and I split a couple things for apps - the grilled octopus and the empanada combo.  I only ate the Cheese empanada of the combo, and I don't know what kind of cheese is in there, but it's gooey and it's good.  The shell of the empanada is always crusty.  That's a good thing.  The grilled octopus tastes fresh and had good charring.  The salad it came with was lightly dressed. I ended up ordering the Skirt Steak and Shrimp combination.  Pretty much all dinners come with 3 starches and the meats, along with 2 kinds of chimichurri, regular and spicy.  The 3 starches are a half potato, fried yucca, and a caramelized sweet plantain, just like my Dad used to make.  I ordered the skirt medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  The grilled shrimp have a slight garlic flavor, and were properly seasoned to my taste.   After dinner, they brought the cake out and sang Happy Birthday to my wife.  Popular birthday dinner spot, as there were 3 other birthday parties gathering at Las Tablas as well.   All in all, everyone always seems to enjoy themseves here, I know I have, and there's always something I haven't eaten on the menu.  But the experience of booking the dinner did leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  That's not to say I won't return, because I will.  But if I am having a dinner for as many guests as I had that day, I might look elsewhere for a different venue that really sees the value in my patronage.",0.9945,0.835,0.124,0.042,0.5423740255471025

I warned them about the large portions and good cocktails. We decided then to have a couple of those cocktails each, and to skip the appetizers, and focus our Friday evening hunger on those generous sizzling plates of grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. Accompanied by two different salsas verdes. One spicy, one not. both very woodsy and refreshing as accompaniments to the grilled meats. The margaritas and the mojitos were extraordinarily  refreshing, too. Yucca, potato, and plantains, too. We shared a flan and figs with caramel. Creamiest flan ever! All of the grilled items were flavorful, cooked to perfection and the steaks were like ""butta."" We all agreed on that. Service was a little ""meh,"" from the standpoint of our having to summon our server on a number of occasions, for various reasons. But the dinners did come out quickly enough. The service just lacked that usual ubiquitous Latin warmth and ""Mi casa es su casa"" approach.

2012-04-26,4.0,"Las Tablas has been around since 1991; I had previously enjoyed a couple of meals a few years back in their old location but this was my first time there since they moved. I really like the current venue a lot better; larger space, much better acoustics and a bit more elegant vibe. Las Tablas is a versatile restaurant where you can go with a small group for a celebration, have a dinner out with the family, or a nice date night with a significant other. It features authentic Colombian cuisine with skirt steak being the house specialty. There is plenty of food to choose from as well as a nice drink menu: Wines by the glass start at $7, sangria ($7 a glass, $25 a pitcher), several fun cocktails (about $8 a pop), and some beers (including Colombian). During weeknights you can also BYO (wine only). There is also a nice selection of non alcoholic Colombian beverages. Tonight I ordered sangria; while it was not the best I have had it was enjoyable.  My wife and I had Maria tonight as our server; she was somewhat quiet, but friendly and efficient. Her assistant kept our water glasses full and the table was cleaned and silverware replaced between courses. The pace of the meal is relaxed (as is typical in South America), so do not expect fast service. Just sit back and enjoy! Portion sizes are quite generous and the price point is reasonable factoring in the quality, portions and ambiance. Las Tablas is what I would call dressy casual; it is not quite an upscale venue but is a step up from your typical everyday restaurant.  We had the empanada combination plate for appetizers (consisting of six empanadas: two chicken, two beef and two cheese served with two sauces and accompanied by a small salad). For my entree I went with the Bandeja Paisa; a typical Colombian dish consisting of a hodge podge of different foods. Definitely a lot going on with this dish! There was a nice sized strip of well seasoned and prepared skirt steak, a fried egg laying atop a mound of rice, red beans, avocado, sweet plantains, an arepa (corn dough) and a large strip of pork belly. Aside from the pork belly (which was bland and a tad overcooked) this dish was excellent (with the steak and plantains being my favorite components). I have added a photo of this dish. A nearby table ordered the Picada para Dos (a combination platter for two) consisting of a giant mound of various meats. It looked amazing and I definitely recommend this to any carnivores! It was enough meat to put Fogo de Chao and Brazzaz to shame! I really wanted to order the arequipe (a Colombian type of milky caramel) for dessert (love that stuff), but was way too full. The total bill (before tip) came to just over $70 (including the appetizer platter, two entrees and two adult beverages). We had a very nice dinner and I definitely recommend Las Tablas to anybody interested in trying good, authentic Colombian cuisine in a nice but fairly casual environment.",0.999,0.765,0.22,0.015,0.5698773448773449
2012-04-23,4.0,"I've had dinner here a couple of times and both times, I was extremely impressed with their famous ""entrana"" steak. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and the bland sides strangely worked perfectly with it. The servings were extremely generous and the food came out promptly, given how insanely crowded the place was. There was a bit of a wait for a table (it was a Friday night at 8:30), but ordering a pitcher of their delicious, expertly-mixed sangria definitely alleviated the wait!  The next time I come here, I will definitely skip out on the appetizer, which is why I am giving Las Tablas a 4 instead of a 5. We had the empanada combination platter, and all three (chicken, beef and cheese) were relatively unappetizing. They all tasted like fried greasy mush, and unnecessarily filled us up before our delicious entree's.

We arrived a little before 5pm because we were told we couldn't save a spot around 6pm; however, we left close to 7pm and it wasn't anywhere near full yet. A number of people were in the front waiting to be seated, but I think letting us have a later reservation wouldn't have been a big deal. It's hard to tell. They boast ""Best Mojito in Chicago."" It wasn't my favorite as I prefer a little more sugar and a lot more mint. But I will say it definitely made my top 5. If it were less than $8, I'd have ordered a second, even a third to try the fresh fruit version. The strawberry one looked tasty. Megan G. and I both ordered the Combinaciones with Entrana Skirt Steak & Grilled Shrimp. We agreed that the Shrimp was cooked to perfection. I feared it would flavorless because it looked dry, but it was nicely grilled on the outside and incredibly juicy on the inside. Whatever seasoning they use complements it. The Entrana was the show stopper, though. Mine was ordered medium-rare and delivered that way. It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. You could have sliced it with a spoon, and the complimentary Chimichurri (the fresher, greener one was a group favorite) only enhanced it; however, you won't be disappointed if you eat it plain. I liked the side of Yuca Frita and Baked Potato, but it was almost too much of a good starchy thing. They were a little too similar to be served together. I could have eaten an entire platter of the Plantains. We were disappointed to find that their dessert menu was limited. It's possible it was only that evening, but they had two options on a Saturday night - Flan or Figs & Tres Leches Caramel. Most of us went with Flan and loved it. It's one of the better ones in the city. It sounded like the Figs were good too, but the Flan was best.

They ended up seating us 45+ minutes late, which by then I was ready to pass out from hunger. I purposely didn't eat a lot during the day to prepare myself for a delicious steak dinner. If you are going to make people wait, at least prepare them for that when they make the reservation. I order the ""Combonaciones"" of pork and skirt steak (the highly recommended meat) on the menu. It came with a plain small half of a baked potato, half of a plantain and 2 small peices of fried yucca. Nothing was seasoned and you were supposed to put this cilantro garlic mixture on the table on your food. Therefore those items were mainly tasteless. The yucca tasted like the oil it was fried in. So there were 2 mixtures one with oil and one without. The non-oil mixture didn't add a lot of flavor to your food. The oil mixture was delish, but I just added 10,000 calories to my food to make it taste good. My gripe is that if I am going out to eat, at least season the food. The steak was pretty good and so was the pork. But if I'm going out for steak, Mastro's, Capital Grille, Fullton's, etc. have better cuts of meat. I personally don't think this place is worth the price ESPECIALLY since it's not even BYOB on the weekends (only M-Th).  They have reasonably priced bottles of wine at $30 (think $7.5 per glass).

2012-02-09,4.0,"What a cute little steak house.  Went here late on a Sat night after we worked up an appetite bowling at 7-10 lounge. Atmosphere....cute-y little servers that are super nice. Drinks...HELL yes I want a fresh fruit martini...like every flavor imaginable...I guess they are know for mojitos...I just am not a fan of them so they suggested doing a fruit martini instead.  As I slurped down a couple of blackberry martinis, I was feeling happy and festive in this steak house. Food...pretty darn good steak, chicken, seafood, etc.  The empanadas were great.  We did the combo plate.  Cheese, chicken and steak.  Chicken was my favorite.  Plus, they give you this house salsa stuff...one spicy, one not.  Yummy and fresh.  We also did the combo dinner plate.  Everything was good.  It was seasoned well and if you dont like salt/seasoning...this probably isnt the place for you.  It was boarding a little much, however, I thought it was really good.  The plantains could have used being cooked a little bit more for a crispy outside crust.  The potatoes and I am not sure what the other thing on my plate was....I think it was fried yuca...it was really amazing.  The portions were HUGE~~~~~~~~~~~~  Yikes, talk about contributing to obesity epidemic.  Wowsers.  However, I guess you get what you pay for here. Overall, its a decent steak house for a chillax vibe that isnt going to break the bank.  The drinks are fantastic with the fresh fruit...not overwhelmingly sweet...which is right up my alley.",0.9921,0.753,0.204,0.042,0.6359360410830996

Order a ""picada"" which is a plate of food for two that has a little bit of everything. Get the arepa and chorizo and eat it while it's hot. Order extra chimichurri sauce and put it on everything. Take some home and put it on your lover. FYI, this place is no longer BYOB on the weekends. Not a deal breaker but keep that in mind so you dont show up with bottles you can't drink.

We both substituted the yucca, her for a salad and me for beans. The side orders were very large and more than plentiful. The skirt steak was great as was the plantain.  The service was slow.

Not bad for a nice night, I mean the place is really trendy and nice. Reminds you of Columbia or some Spanish eating ground. It was really nice and quaint, you know candle lit and all. The place was bustling with business and to be honest I didn't mind at all. It was really nice to see this place busy.

2011-05-25,1.0,"As someone coming from a Colombian background, i'm offended by the lack of authentic-ness of this restaurant. If you're looking for authentic Colombian food this is not the place! I truly hope this isn't what people think the food my parents homeland has. Yes they try, but fail miserably in the little things. For example, the arepa (sort of a cornbread type flat bread). I, myself dont know how to cook at all but I even know how to make an arepa. Las Tablas arepas are store bought which are offensive to any Colombian considering it takes less than 10 minutes to prepare the real version. ESPECIALLY, when the texture and taste of a store bought arepa are COMPLETELY different. (think, elementary school cafeteria burger compared to a Kuma's burger, that big of a difference... ) Yes, I feel this strongly about it and the only other Colombian i've met in Chicago, agrees.  I ordered the Bandeja Paisa which is probably the most popular dish in Colombia. and whoa! what a disappointment. Again, the lack of authentic-ness. This isn't one of those 'oh my mom makes it a certain way and this restaurant does it differently'... it's very hard to screw up the bandeja paisa and well las tablas did just that. First off, if you dont have the right ingredients, you're setting yourself up for failure. There's a specific type of bean thats used in this meal and las tablas resorted to some mexican beans.. wtf. might as well rename the dish to Mexican Bandeja. The peasants in Colombia would legit be up in arms about this. Enough about the beans and fake arepa, everything tasted dry, even the egg was a poor excuse for an egg.  As you may have guessed it, I will not be returning to Las Tablas. The service was good and considering all the interesting artistic things Colombia has to offer, the decor also receives 1 star.

But the sides: the potato and the yuca... Don't know what happened with these.  The yuca was so dried out and tough that  it was inedible.  The potato was just ok... It could only really be eaten with the salsas; otherwise it wasn't good because it was so dry it would dry out your mouth.   And, the plaintain wasn't anything special. Joe got the combination plate with shrimp and skirt steak... His was good and about the same as mine except his yuca was edible.   In addition to the food... The bathrooms are downstairs and it was pretty creepy.  I mean, downstairs bathrooms are creepy in general, but theirs was creepier than most.  It's hard to describe, but it just was.  Our waitress was also pretty annoying.  She kept asking us if we wanted anything else.  She asked us if we wanted to order drinks about five times - and we just kept telling her we were ok with water.  I felt like she was constantly trying to upsell us.",0.99,0.789,0.16,0.051,0.7083508403361344

The empanadas (we got chicken and cheese) were delicious. For entrees, we got chicken, the house speciality steak, grilled calamari, and the stuffed chicken called Pollo Relleno.  The steak had a wonderful marinade; but even though it was ordered (and came out) medium rare, it was a little on the chewy side. The calamari had a very good flavor, as did the chicken. The stuffed chicken was mouth-watering. One of my table-mates tasted it and rightfully described it as astounding.  Dishes are served with potato, yuca and fried plantain, and the Relleno was also served with a salad. The potato, even with its seasonings, is underwhelming but not bad. The plantain is cooked perfectly.  A couple of us split the coconut flan for dessert. This too, was fantastic. The bussers were there to immediately clear garbage and plates from the table without being intrusive. Waters were refilled long before they were empty.  Server was attentive but never hovering.

Afterwards, we were stuffed.  We were debating trying the flan, but decided we were too full.  Our waiter had heard us trying to figure that out, and he brought us an order of flan on the house.  What a perfect way to end the evening!

We arrived on time and were seated promptly.  The waitress immediately came over to our table and took a drink order.  She quickly returned and took our dinner order, to the point that everyone felt rushed in looking at the menu.  It was the last thing that happened quickly. Then we sat.  And sat.  And sat.  And sat.  And finally our appetizers came. We had a group of 6 and had ordered the empanada combo.  Mine had no filling.  It was just a deep fried shell.  At this point I was so hungry, it didn't matter. Then we waited and waited and waited (well, you get the idea).  The peculiar thing was that the waitress was nowhere to be found.  After almost an hour since the delivery of the empanadas, we still hadn't received our entree.   There was very little service to speak of, so to say that it was awful isn't really fair.  Flat out the service was NON EXISTENT.  No coming to the table to apologize for the wait.  No coming to tell us it would just be a minute.  No manager to come by and make sure everything was alright. Our table wasn't the only one grumbling.  At one point one of our party got up and walked the entire fully packed restaurant, counting the table with food: four.  Four tables in the whole restaurant had food. Finally at 9:45 our food came.  It was nowhere good enough to make people wait that long.  I had the skirt steak/pork combo.  The pork was overcooked and tough; the skirt steak (ordered med. rare) was seared on the outside and raw in the middle.  After waiting this long for the food I wasn't about to send it back for fear that they would actually fly it to Colombia to have it viewed by some government minister before verifying that it was poorly prepared.  Not that I could have sent it back because after it was brought to our table, the waitress never came back. We more or less needed a flare gun to get her attention to get the check.  Getting the check was the shortest process of the night.  It only took her 20 minutes to calculate 6 entrees and an appetizer.   The best part is that on our way out, I asked a guy who was sitting at the bar, deep in conversation with the bartender, if he was the manager.  He replied that he was.  I told him that it was a shame the service was so bad because they would definitely lose business, if not only from our table, but from everyone who dined there.  He didn't seem bothered by it at all.  His answer: Yeah, well the Chef is really, really sick.  I can only hope that the Chef was at home and not in the kitchen.

If you get an appetizer, as we always do, this will not only be your dinner, but you will have enough leftover for 2 people to eat again. We used the groupon and had absolutely no problems with it.

2011-01-08,3.0,"I've been going to this place for years. Food is superb. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. Prices get higher all the time.  This time, I went on a Thursday evening. There was a sign that said ""Please wait to be seated"" but no host. The bartender walked over to the host stand hesitantly and could not find the waitlist, scribbled my name on some random sheet of paper. When asked how long the wait would be, he said ""oh, its gonna be a LONG time."" He didn't say ""15-30 minutes"" or anything of the sort. Funny thing is, at the time, half the restaurant was empty. This is not a new restaurant, you would think they would know how to operate a waitlist, but they do not. When our table ""is ready,"" we start to follow our ""host,"" but he disappears into the kitchen before leading us to our table and we're left stranded in the middle of the restaurant. When we approach another server, she alerts another lady who leads us to some table in the corner in a totally empty wing of the restaurant. Before we are seated she asks us to please make sure we stay less than two hours. I didn't understand her request at first-- thought she was saying it would take two hours to get our food! I laughed, surprised. She had asked us to leave before we even sat down! We sat there for 5-10 minutes before anyone came to our table. First thing we were asked by the server that finally came to our table (after she had looked around) was-- did we already have a server. Apparently, at Las Tablas, servers are not assigned to specific tables? We ordered two maracuyas (passion fruit juice) in water. One was visibly very diluted. Both tasted more like water than anything else. Ordered wine. It arrived after our doggy-bags. We thought waitress had forgotten. She said bartender was really ""busy.""

I decided to take my group of 4 there, as I had 2 guests in town who I thought would love it too.  The food itself in combination with BYOB Monday-Thursday was 5 stars, however, the SERVICE, oh the service... tsk tsk tsk Las Tablas. Didn't you see all the guests waiting for a table sneak out due to your inability to write names down on a piece of paper? Couldn't you at least PRETEND you were familiar with a wait list? We literally had to go up there 3 different times to make sure our party of 4's name was on the list. The first two somehow didn't end up on there.... After myself and a few other hungry patrons bonded over how ridiculously horrible the service and lack of organization was while we waited for the 'host' to slowly meander back to the host stand, I asked the question many of us were wondering- how do we know when it is our turn? (they didn't take our phone#'s or use a buzzing system).  In her Columbian, accent, 'Oh, i know face'. okay okay lady.  Lady did know my mean hungry mug by that time and sat us within 10 minutes of that point.

2010-12-10,4.0,"Don't let the steakhouse part of the name scare you....this place will be enjoyed by all - carnivores, seafood lovers, vegetarians, there's something for everyone on the menu. Just make sure you bring your appetite, because you will be getting allllllottt of food! My three lovely dining companions and I met up here on a cold winter Wednesday. Upon walking in I immediately loved the ambience. Low lighting, dark wood, muted colors, there was a very warm & inviting feel to the place. I had called ahead to make a reservation and was told it wasn't needed for parties of less then 6. And sure enough, true to their word, we were seated without a wait. I'm guessing on a Friday or Saturday when it's really busy you may have a small wait, but there's a decent size area in the front with a bar. And some of the drinks I saw coming out looked quite good, so a pre-dinner drink in the bar area wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen! We started with the empanada combo plate and they were good, but when is cheese and/or meat in a fried dough shell not good? For my entree I went with the Langostinos al Carbon, which is grilled shrimp in a garlic white wine marinade. Uhm - YUM! The shrimp were grilled perfectly, I could have eaten a pound of those puppies. Two of my friends went with the house recommended combo platters, one with skirt steak & calamari, the other with skirt steak & shrimp. I didn't hear a complaint out of either of them. In fact, one of them, who shall remain nameless, ended up in the clean plate club. And with the amount of food you get, that is saying something. The 4th member of our party went with one of the chicken plates and seriously, I think they serve you a whole chicken. She's pregnant so she's even eating for two, and yet when she was done eating there was enough chicken leftover for at least a couple more meals. Not that we were complaining, just giving fair warning that you get a ton. All of the dinners come with potato, yuca, and plantain. Now this is where the food slipped a little bit for me. The yuca & potato were both a little dry and just kind of blah. And I LOVE yuca. But I've always had it mashed down in a patty and deep fried, here it was served a little different and it just didn't have alot of flavor. And the potato was just half a baked potato but with no sauce or anything on it. I don't even think it had a pat of butter or salt & pepper on it. So it was just boring. The plantain was the saving grace, it was sweet & delicious.  Service was great. Our server was attentive but not over bearing. Water was refilled often which always earns a star in my book. And since you can BYOB wine Mon - Thurs with no corkage fee, when the bill arrived, we all happily clinked our wine glasses (and one virgin cocktail glass for the preggo lady) and happily said a cheers to the delicious (and plentiful!) food we'd had without breaking the bank.  I can't wait for my next visit since I've already planned out the other dishes I need to try. And hopefully the yuca will be improved or I may have to give them the name of a woman in the Dominican Republic who made the best yuca on the planet....she can share her recipe!",0.9987,0.78,0.185,0.035,0.6216666666666664

There is a weird smell. Not sure if its the food.. some sort of spice.. but I couldnt get over it. All of my food seemed to taste like it because the smell was soo powerful.  I ordered the empanadas. They were really good.. make sure to get those and try them with the sauces. I also got the combination platter with the skirt steak and the pork loin. When I got my food, instead of pork there was baby octopus on my plate. I freaked out and almost fell out of my chair. Wow.. those things are gross looking. Once everything was fixed I couldnt get the picture of those gross things out of my head and it was hard to enjoy my food. But maybe it was because not only did everything seem to taste like the weird smell in the place, but the steak and pork were rubbery and just weird.  O.. and the sangria is a waste of time. Im pretty sure there isnt a drop of alcohol in it and they put chopped apples on top.. its not the greatest.  I gave 2 stars because of the empanadas and they came out with a piece of flan with a candle in it for my fiancee's bday and the whole restaurant sang to him. (The flan was good).

2010-12-06,3.0,"Eh. My boyfriend and I saw Las Tablas featured on an episode of ""Chicago's Best,"" and so we decided we'd have to give it a try. We love steak, and we like trying new places. If this is one of the best steakhouses in Chicago, then we figured we had to go. We called a week in advance and made their version of a reservation for 6:45 on a Saturday night. (Basically, your name, party number and time is put down a list, then you are bumped to the top of the list when you actually arrive at the restaurant.) We were nervous they wouldn't seat us in a timely fashion because we showed up 10 minutes late, but we were seated by 7pm. It took fifteen minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order, and I had to flag a staff member down in order to track down our waiter! When our waiter finally showed up he was apologetic and explained it was busy. Ya think? It's Saturday night! Our table went with a pitcher of their Colombian beer/champagne mix. That didn't arrive for another 15 minutes, and we saw our waiter mixing it himself at the bar (kudos to him, plus some points) because the bartender was engaged elsewhere. Maybe the pitcher of beer/champagne isn't supposed to taste like alcohol, but we were hoping to feel it a little. We didn't feel a thing. So, we went with a bottle of wine next...which took about 10 minutes to get. The food itself was fine. I ended up going with shrimp instead of steak and it was flavorful, but not the best food I'd ever had. I sampled my boyfriend's steak/chicken combination, and it was very tasty...but again, not the best ever. Our appetizers (their empanada sampler and chorizo) were also fine. The chorizo was my favorite dish by far. I'm biased toward chorizo...but really, it was very spicy and juicy! Nom nom nom. I should have had it as an entree. Given the slooooooooow service and weak drinks, I won't go back.

There were only about 3 'patio' tables along the front sidewalk and our early dinner arrival let us score one of them.  I don't eat red meat very often but as usual when sampling authentic cuisines at a new establishment I go for the customary staples. Started out with a refajo which is a beer and soda mixture falling somewhere between a German Cola Weizen and Mexican Chelada.  It was slightly refreshing, but nothing exciting. Next were some empanandas which were a bit dry and not as good as memory served.  Our favorites were still found at Cuatro (now out of business).  Also tried a few arepas which are like a cheesy bread (think of the rolls that Texas-De-Brazil puts on the table).  These were excellent. For an entrée the house special was the obvious first choice: the Entrana.  This is char-broiled skirt steak with fried plantains, yuca, and potato wedges.  the meat was a bit more chewy then I would have expected, but the seasoning was excellent.  The plantains and yuca was really good too.

The restaurant allows you to bring your own bottles of wine which is a good thing.  As for food, I ordered the skirt steak, which was the best I'd ever tried.  The skirt steak meal itself is reasonable in price, but for just $1 more, you can add another type of meat.  I tried chicken and felt that the chicken was dry and paled in comparison to the steak.  Each meal was served with a few veggies and bananas.  They were good, not great.  They also provide two types of sauces to use.  They were fairly good.

Finally went last night w/ the hubby and daughter to celebrate my birthday.   It was a Monday evening so we were seated right away and service was exceptional the whole evening, very attentive and informative.   We started with the pitcher of sangria (no longer half priced on Mondays) but still very good - not at all watered down. Then ordered the empanada combination plate - 2 cheese, 2 chicken and 2 beef, and they were very, very good. The two sauces were very tasty, not 100% sure what all was in both but one had jalapeño and cilantro, the other was more parsley based. The entrana (grilled skirt steak) was really, really tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked exactly to our specifications - medium rare.  The sides were all (as discussed in many of the other reviews) really, really dry.  Our daughter is a vegetarian and had the paella - rice with lots of good veggies and good flavor which she enjoyed. Flan was coconut based (not my favorite) and drizzled with cherry sauce (love cherries but not on flan).  So the only reason I didn't go 5 stars are three very slight negatives  1) the dry sides, 2) the flan not being in keeping with my expectation of good caramely flan and 3) the bathrooms being way out of the way - which as someone else mentioned in their review would be fine if you haven't had a pitcher of sangria!

2010-09-27,4.0,"I saw a special in which this place was called ""the best skirt steak in the city"". Well, with a title like that, I had to go. We started with the empanadas combination plate which came with a delicious salad and cheese, chicken, and beef empanadas. I had a glass of sangria, which was good, but could have used more fruit, because booze-infused fruit reigns supreme. Nonetheless, it cured the all-day headache I had this past Friday night, and for that I am incredibly thankful. Now for the main event! For $20, you can get skirt steak (which was amazing), a potato, plantain, and yukka root (which I learned is a starchy aphrodisiac in Africa). For a dollar more, you can make it a combination plate. My boyfriend and I both got calamari, which was delicious. I didn't make the clean plate club; they give you so much food. I would definitely come back for the main course and the amazing service.

I even thought it tasted better... wow- that just proves I really was not in the mood to eat that night. I'm not a fan of the sides though... plantains, pan-fried potatoes, and yuca. The potatoes and yuca were too dry.  We shared a few pitchers of Sangria. It was average-- too sweet for my taste so I liked the mojitos better.  I will definitely go back for the entrana!

2010-08-25,1.0,"A large group of us had a reservation at Las Tablas for this past Saturday evening and I can honestly say it was the WORST dining experience I have ever had. I nearly went Real Housewives of New Jersey at the lack of attention to anything that was happening at the restaurant - except my freak-out was directed at the restaurant and not a ""prosti&*ion who&*%"" Seriously, it was ridiculous. Not only did our reservation end up having us wait an additional hour for a table, they had 1 bartender for the whole restaurant and the bar - which meant it took an hour to get a drink. Staffing simply didn't have it together here...  Then there was the table-service. It took 20 minutes to get water and another 40 to take our order.  Of course, a half hour later, we were still waiting for anything resembling food to appear and while the quality of the appetizers was good, it certainly took a long time to fry a couple of empanadas for our table. Meanwhile, waitstaff would often gather in small groups to chat - then the restaurant would be empty with nobody present to talk to if you needed anything...  Dinner then took another 40 minutes - I got the recommended Combination platter (chicken and beef) - which should have been called Salt-Lick Meat. Like inadvertently swallowing ocean water, I nearly gagged from the severity of salt on my meat. Of course, then the danger here is that IT TAKES 40 MINUTES FOR DINNER, but I sent it back anyway. In return, I did get a beef-dish with less salt, but at this point, I was over it.  If there was one thing I liked at the restaurant it was the coffee - that was good.

Moving on, the strawberry mojito was decent (not as good as Carnivale, but still good) and the Empanada Combination Plate was very good with the accompanying chimichurri sauce.

As for the food, the steak plates are around $18 or $20 depending what combination of skirt steak you want, be it with pork loin, chicken breast, calamari, octopus, etc. Most of the dishes come with yucca, plantain and sometimes roasted potato. People who I've been there have complained ""the sides are so dry!""...well duh, you are supposed to smother the sides with the copious amounts of green chile they bring you, This is how Columbian food is eaten. I've tried some of the appetizers as well and they are very good, running like $3 to $8. The empanada sampler plate was a good deal. A single empanada order will run $2.50, but on this plate you get 6 of them for $7.50.

2010-08-09,2.0,"We had a nice Groupon, so we were excited to try another place that we haven't been to. Unfortunately we were ultimately disappointed by the whole experience. Atmosphere: Kind of drab if you ask me. I like that they have some very large tables for groups. Otherwise, I'm not a fan. It's also annoying that you have to go on a 5 mile hike through an underground maze to get to the restrooms. Service: Fine, no issues here. Appetizer: We had one beef empanada and one chicken empanada. I thought that for $2.50 each, they could have been a little bigger. Seriously, I could have eaten each in one bite if I wanted to. They tasted ok, but were nothing to write home about. Main course: We shared the $38 Picada Colombiana, which is basically a big heaping plate of meats for two. Skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, chicken breast, chorizo, potatoes, yuca, and plantains. Honestly, we were both very disappointed in the meats. The skirt steak was by far the best, but honestly I've had much much better skirt steak elsewhere.The chorizo was also ok, but everything else was very bland and not tasty at all. I normally like yuca, but here the yuca and potatoes were so dry and they were barely edible. I guess we have been spoiled by places like Nacional 27 and Carnivale, where the skirt steak is simply a-maz-ing. One thing I will say is, it's a LOT of meat. Unfortunately it's not a lot of AWESOME meat.  Would we go back? Probably not any time soon.

So much flavor and not in the sense of, ""Wow is this full of sprite, juice, etc?"". We also shared the Picada Colombiana. If you are in the mood for some perfectly cooked/grilled meats and tasty starches, then this is your dish! We got our steak cooked to a perfect medium temperature. That coupled with the chorizo, ribs, pork chicken, etc. a vegetarian would be in hell, but it was my heaven.  Regarding the starches, most were tasty; however, the potato was a bit much in size and the crunchy green plantain was a bit dry and not really my speed. The arepa, fried sweet plantain and yucca were Perfect!  My only regret is that this was a bro-mantic date. This place is cozy.

2010-07-31,1.0,"My wife and I received the worst service we have ever experienced at any restaurant last night at Las Tablas.  I seriously thought we were on candid camera and they were just trying to see how much we would take before we walked out or threw a glass at our waiter. We went to Las Tablas because we bought the groupon.  We have been 3 or 4 times before and used to love this place at the old location and enjoyed the new location previously and had no issues and always loved the food. Last night started by a short wait, which was no surprise and just fine for a friday night. We sat at the bar.  We sat there for 10-15 minutes and not once did the bartender ask if my wife or I would like a drink.  I stared at the guy while he walked back and forth in front of us, washing glasses, serving a few other people, and never once making eye contact with me.  There was not a large crowd at the bar, and at one point we were the ONLY TWO PEOPLE at the bar and still not a word or eye contact. My wife remarked how strange it was while we were still seated at the bar. We were then seated by the hostess in less than 15 minutes, which was great.  but then we waited no less than 15 minutes before our waiter showed up at our table. At that point we had had plenty of time to choose drinks, appetizers, entrees, etc.  We ordered everything including a glass of cab for myself.  We again wait no less than 15 minutes before our waiter shows back up with my wife's drink but informs me that they have no cab, only merlot. At that point, I should have been 2 or 3 drinks into the evening so i said that would be fine. And I want to reiterate that though this was a friday night and we were using a groupom, the restaurant was not overly crowded and by the time we got our food the restaurant started clearing out and there were several empty tables, so this service was not a result of busy, just bad. Our appetizer and food comes out with no problem. The food was good as always.  Then we wait....again. I had finished my first glass of wine between the appetizer and the entree and put my empty glass on the edge of the table so someone would get a hint.  My glass sat there for the next HOUR until we left the restaurant.  We did not see our waiter from the time he brought my drink to 30 minutes after we had finished our meal.  After finishing our meal, with no sign of our waiter, we finally asked a bus boy for a take home bag.  My wife got that back in a few minutes and it sat on the table in front of her for almost 30 minutes.  I though that would be evidence enough, along with our cleared plates, empty water glasses, and still empty wine glass, that we were done and more than ready to get our check and get out of there.  But no, we waited and waited until I finally spotted our waiter and flagged him down.  With very little spoken if anything he brought the check to us. I put in the groupon along with my credit card into the bill fold.  We again waited no less than 15 minutes before  the check sitting half on, half off the edge of our table, with the credit card sticking out, was finally picked back up to be charged (I had to flag this guy down again).  He takes the check and comes back 10-15 minutes later with a check for the entire meal, no discount for the groupon.  Of course I have to flag this $@#% down again and tell him that he did not discount for the groupon.  He says ""oh, you have a groupon?""  This just about blows my mind as the groupon printout is a letter sized page that sticks out a restaurant billfold.  This is when I just started laughing because halfway through the experience it was already bad, and it just continued to get worse and worse.  Anyway, the guy goes back to his register brings me back a receipt showing he refunded my card, but needs my card again to charge for the meak minus the groupon. done and done.  We walked in at 8pm, and didn't walk out until after 10pm.  We were ready to leave at 9pm. worst experience ever. ruined my friday night.  It would have ruined my weekend, but I figured writing this lengthy review/story would give me closure. obviously, I'm done with Las Tablas.",-0.9902,0.859,0.048,0.093,0.40198681915099826

After waiting an hour (and those tables were still un-sat), I checked in with a male waiter who was helping at the hostess stand. Just as he tells me they were no longer seating, the woman who had been there most of the night returned to say it would only be a little longer.  Fortunately, another set of customers over heard my conversation with the hostess and told me that they were wondering what the deal was because they were about to be seated and had noticed us waiting when they got there.  I am so grateful for the kindness of these customers, who not only told the hostess in Spanish about the problem but also gave us their table.   Once my friend and I are seated, we quickly (and happily) order beverages,  the empanada combination plate, and our entrees.  Again, we wait... and wait.  You know the couple who gave us their table? Well, they were seated near us and had another round of bevs and appetizers before we even saw our waitress or was able to get the attention of any other restaurant staff member.  Finally, I was able to catch the hostess and asked her to make sure that the empanadas are out first.  The waitress comes back with our drinks and tells us that the paper in the kitchen ran out and she didn't know, but would have them out very soon.  The empanadas arrive and instead of being 2 chicken, 2 cheese, and two beef, we get 4 cheese and 2 chicken.  We tell the waitress who gave us an excuse for why it couldn't be fixed.  We move on to the entree, which was good, not spectacular, and would have been better with the chimichurri sauce that was supposed to be with the steak (they ran out). We were there almost 3 hours and the only thing that happened in a timely manner was the waitress bringing our check (nice, huh?).  The restaurant staff knew there had been multiple issues and did nothing to remedy the situation.  It's not like we came in near closing time or had impossible requests.  I'm so disappointed.",0.9744,0.86,0.095,0.046,0.5654970760233917

The Entraña was awesome and definitely recommend! The empanadas were great with the delicious dipping sauce.

Kind of weird to me the place didn't have linen napkins with it being ""upscale"".

So I skipped merrily to the restaurant with coupons in one hand and boyfriend on the other. The place look relatively nice, with dim lighting and a medieval feel to it. I felt like I was in an episode of Xena warrior princess.  And who doesn't love Xena? Am I right here! But anyways, I got the Entrana of course and the boyfriend copied me.  When it came out, it was a long piece of skirt steak about 12 inches. It came with yuca potatoes, potatoes and plantains.  Mmmmh, delicious. But  the sauce was the icing on top. The chimicurri sauce is where's the money's at.  At first, I was a fool, I only wanted to use a little so it doesn't overwhelm my meat. But sadly, I was put in my place when i realized this was the barbecue sauce to my barbecue chicken.

I have only been here on weeknights. With groups of 2-10 I never have a problem getting seated immediately. This weeknight habit is mostly to take advantage of the fabulous drink specials. Such as- No corking fee. Love. Pitcher of Sangria for half price Monday!- Yes, please! I always order the same thing, because it is SO good. The *skirt steak, Entrana, medium served with yucca, plantain and potato. Get one of these people! It's good enough that you'll want your own, but I'm pretty sure it's meant to serve two! It's always strange to me watching people here order one per person like they're at Friday's.  This *skirt steak is by far the best thing on the menu. The marinade and seasonings it is treated with are good enough that it is a stand alone, no need for the sauces. They are good if you would like though. I have tried the *paella as well and it was pretty good. It's nice to have this option for vegetarian friends while you're gnawing on a steak. As sides I get the *salad, *rice, and *beans. They are standard fare. Some places can even mess up a salad though and Las Tables doesn't. Don't skip dessert! The *coffee here is absolutely to die for. Our waiter told us that Macondo across the street sells it in bean form and we WILL be buying it. What's best though, is drinking the coffee while eating the *tres leches cake. Absolutely sweet, creamy, balanced. I couldn't ask for more. Few things complement each other this well in the world. What did this all cost? Under $40. Take that, my favorite ever, Chophouse! Steak dinner with dessert... and I happened to have my $35 Groupon. Fantastic. The service could afford to be a little more attentive.

I had the skirt steak and baby octopus. She had the pollo al ajillo and grilled shimp. We shared and everything was really, really good. I would recommend this route to anyone. Finally, we shared a coconut flan. It was good, but I might try something else if you don't like really sweet desserts. Luckily, I do... and I inhaled it. Overall, I really liked this place. I would like to see the prices be a notch lower, but you do get a lot of really good food or the price. The decor is really cool and they have Fernando Botero paintings decorating several walls.

I booked this place for my brother's birthday and was excited because they seemed more than willing to accommodate our group of 11.  Reservations were for 8pm and when we all arrived i went to tell the hosts that we were all here.  After a lot of ""Let me just check on the table for you"", one of the hosts proceeds to tell me that ""they didn't know I was coming today"".  That's funny...I received a phone call from Las Tablas that afternoon confirming my reservation for 8pm and when I saw my name very clearly written on the reservation sheet when I walked in.  How did you not know we were coming?  He then went on to explain they'd ""try really hard"" to get us a table....that I reserved...5 days prior.  Anyway... FInally, about 30 minutes after our reserved time, we are seated.  Everyone's excited to eat and partake in sangria.  We all order and end up waiting until after 9:30pm to get our food. Now I know there was a lot ordered and lots of different meats to cook, but an hour after we sat down?  I don't know think I have ever waited that long at any restaurant or with any size party.  Thankfully the sangria was good, since we ended up ordering 3 extra pitchers to bide our time till the food arrived. So, we're all starving (and a little tipsy from all the sangria on empty stomachs) as the food is finally brought over to the table.  My plate was missing the pork belly.  Another plate was missing the plantain.  And the best part, every single plate had cold food.  What the heck?  One person had his plate taken back to get reheated (which also turned his steak from medium rare to medium well).  A couple of us also mentioned to the waiter that all the food was cold.  He just shrugged his shoulders and stared at us.  I think at that point, we were all too hungry to argue about it any further.  The food didn't necessarily taste bad, but meat really isn't meant to be eaten cold.  Regardless, we just ate because we were all so hungry at this point.   Not only was the service awful but the food (which I figured would its saving grace) was cold and nothing was done about it.  The waitstaff missed out on getting a great tip from a table of 11 and instead got a mediocre tip from a very disappointed group.  Maybe this place is better in smaller groups. but I am wary of going back now with the experience that I had.",0.9091,0.863,0.079,0.058,0.586624215577704

Answer: Down the street at the Mexican restaurant! I thought I knew what to expect, as I had tried my fair share of pollo al ajillo while traveling. This isn't your snack shack kind of food, though. Sure, there's a pollo al ajillo (its one of the specials) but you've never really tried Pollo al Ajillo (chicken with a light garlic wine marinade) until you've had it at Las Tablas. In fact, I'm going to make a lofty claim and that I never knew the delicious details of chicken until I tasted the perfectly prepared, tender, and delicate chicken at Las Tablas. The only downfall is that the chicken didn't heat up for lunch very well the next day. In retrospect, however, I think my initial standards were too high for that small leftover piece to fulfill its grandiose memory of the night before.

We were seated promptly on a Friday night (looks like we were just lucky, though, because the place was packed and a line formed shortly after our arrival). It took the wait staff a while to get around to water and taking our order - we started with an arepa (cornbread sandwich) and it was fantastic.  My partner ordered the Combinaciones - steak and shrimp. I ordered the same - steak and calamari. While the shrimp was good, the calamari was chewy and overcooked. The steak was mind blowing! I suggest you skip the combinations all together and go for the steak only. Yucca, plantain, potato - just filler in my opinion. Nothing special about them and I never got around to eating them. The chimichurri sauces were quite good - although I'm not sure you even need them. We were stuffed and didn't order dessert although it looked awesome.

I started with the cheese empanadas.  Yummm....  Then I went for the steak/octopus combination.  First of all, if you don't get the steak, you are simply insane.  It is so flavorful and delicious.  I tried a bit with the chimuchurri sauce, which was excellent, but the meat itself was so flavorful I decided I preferred it plain.  The octopus is so delicious as well.  It has a yummy charred flavor and is really delicious.  And if you like yucca (which some people don't), this is one of the few places I've found it since my trip to Peru.  And you can't go wrong with some plaintains as well. I also like the atmosphere here.  It's got a great ambience, and they really seem to have thought of everything.  The menu FAQ section is really cute.  I especially enjoyed Q: ""Where are the chips and salsa?""  A: ""At the Mexican restaurant down the street."" They did forget my friend's entree, who, unfortunately, happened to be the birthday girl.  Minus a star for that.  But the manager offered us a concession off the bill and a free drink for my friend, so at least they handled it fairly well.  He also said it was the kitchen's fault, not the waitress's, and I believe it, since our waitress was nothing but super nice and helpful the whole evening.  From this and from reading the other reviews, I'm guessing this place just doesn't QUITE have everything in a row for a busy evening, but oh well.  Few places are perfect, and the here food is worth what I'm sure is just an occassional slip.",0.9972,0.707,0.242,0.05,0.5777427637721757

As I love pork the best of any meats, I am hear to proclaim loud and clear ""just get the skirt steak!"" The pork loin was fine but that steak was just oozing with flavor and juiciness - one of the best I have ever had.

They were good, not the best I have ever had and I could take them or leave them.     One of the highlights of the evening was the Chimichurri sauces - both of which were divine. Our chatty and highly attentive server told us one was very hot but both the Cupcake and I thought the ""hot"" one (which was seriously not that hot) was the best, so don't be afraid to try it. Another highlight was the dessert we split - the Flan de Coco - Las Tablas' very own special, original recipe of the traditional Latin custard with a light hint of coconut and much denser than the flans I have had elsewhere.

The flavor was also very good and it came with very generous portions for the sides. Our Waiter was excellent also. He was nice enough to wave the cork fee and gave us free dessert because we let them have our first bottle of wine.

2010-03-03,4.0,"This would be the third stop on our madcap dining run through Restaurant Week.  And really it was a total asspull.  I had never really looked at this place, didn't Yelp it, just chose the first place I saw on the list that was both north of Division and not an Italian joint.  And I figured, it has steak in the name, what could possibly go wrong? The answer was ""not very much"".  Let me get the few quibbles out of the way quickly.  At points the service was a bit slow.  I don't blame that on the server, as he was seemingly always in motion with two large groups and some small tables to deal with.  I thought it a bit odd that you couldn't get two different empanadas for the Rest. Week appetizer (you could choose from three different ones, but only choose two of the same apparently) but oh well. Mostly this was a very positive experience.  Our server was very friendly, explained the menu quite well, gave some good suggestions on what to get, and generally kept things going well.   For first courses we tried the empanadas w/chicken, rice, peas, and carrots.  These were quite tasty, and the chimmichurri sauce, esp. the spicy version, had quite a kick.  I had the Aborrajado, which I am relatively sure is Spanish for ""freaking awesome"" but I could be wrong.  Plantain = guava paste = melted cheese = NOM NOM NOM! The main courses were meaty affairs.  The mrs. went with the Matrimonio, a combination platter of the Entrana skirt steak and the chicken breast.  We both thought the chicken was nice, with the hint of garlic and white wine from the sauce being a nice subtle note.  I, being a meat loving sort of man, went for the Entrana on its own.  Both platters came with fried plantain, yuca, and potato by the way.  The Entrana was excellent.  Usually with this sort of cut you end up thinking ""wow, this was salty"" or ""wow, this was tough"".  Here though I just thought ""wow, this was excellent!""  The meat was very flavorful, but with the meat flavor being paramount.  The cut was juicy and tender.  And the portions were substantial. Dessert was a bit of a disappointment.  They were out of a few of their desserts, including the passion fruit mousse that sounded really good.  I had the flan which was passable, but nothing to sway things one way or the other.  We had some poached figs as well, though by that point only a tremendous dessert would have been worth further gorging.  The figs were easy enough to take a few bites of and then push away. I debated long and hard where this ranks, due to Yelp's damnable whole-star rating system.  I guess since I would have gone 3.5 on this, and I really did enjoy that steak a hell of a lot, I can go with four stars.  After all, they don't send out a bill on how many stars you give out in a month, right?  I could see this getting a bit hairy on a weekend, as just a couple large groups did slow things a bit here on a weeknight.  But again, a small quibble.  Go here.  Eat steak.",0.9918,0.812,0.128,0.061,0.5407166631047228

When we mentioned that we had been isolated for 30 minutes he got defensive and told us that he had made sure that the bus boys filled out waters and took care of us - this was a flat out lie - no one ever came to fill our water and we didnt need much water as we were all drinking. He then proceeded to tell us we didnt have to tip him and that we could just leave it at that. That is when I spoke up and said I would never leave a restaurant without a tip.  So he left saying he was going to speak to the manager and then he came back with the bill.  VERDICT: Cocky young waiter didn't want to be gracious and admit fault - instead he was defensive a made up a lie about sending bussers over which was untrue. He had a strained look on his face as if he was getting into a verbal fight and he should have known better.

2010-01-03,3.0,"Seems this a popular style of restaurant these days.  You get a ton of grillled meats with roasted starchy veggies on the side.  Get enough on your plate to feed you for 2-3 days and drop about 30 bucks a head.  I can see the appeal, but it just doesn't excite me.  Fun for a group, but just not a unique enough dining experience to merit the crowds. BYO is a big part of the ""Tango Sur"" model, and Tablas offers that mid-week but charges a whopping 8$ corkage on the weekend.  I've never understood why someone would bring a 15 dollar bottle of wine to a restaurant with an 8 dollar corkage.  Sure it's still cheaper than buying wine off their menu, but that's a pretty stiff upcharge.  I'll probably stick to sangria or beer at a place like this, so at least I'm not paying 20 bucks for the right to drink cheap wine from the corner shop. The other ingredient of the model is a huge sizzling platter of grilled meats.  Of course they serve you pretty cheap cuts of meat, brined into oblivion then covered in oil so they come out moist and shiny.  Sure it tastes good, but it's something of a mirage.  Everything ends up cooked medium well and it begs the question why you don't just go to Jewel, pick up a couple pounds of skirt steak, slam it with a mallet to flatten it out, soak it in salt water for a couple hours, then grill it up (or sear it and sautee it).  That 100 dollar meal (with 20 dollars in corkage) quickly become a 15 dollar meal with no corkage BYO in the comfort of your own home.  My point is that they're just repackaging cheap meats and vegetables (roasting potatoes is even easier than grilling skirt steak) as ethnic cuisine, when really it's just a ploy to serve steak for cheap.

Get the sampler plate to try all three types. For dinner my friend and I both had the chicken and steak combo and it was really good! So many great flavors and really juicy! And last but certainly not least I have to say how wonderful all the staff is at las tablas!! The first time my friend and I went to dinner there we made friends with 2 of our waiters and they gave us a coupon for our next meal. When we came back like 1 1/2 later they both remembered us. It's just such a pleasant and fun environment!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're in the mood for some bomb food (don't come here if you're in the salad mood).",0.993,0.732,0.24,0.027,0.4514814814814815

We started off with free sangria (printed out a coupon on their website), and ordered a couple of appetizers; chicken empanadas and arepas con chorizo. Both were very good. The empanadas were made with masa, and came out  hot and crisp. The chorizo was yummy! The main dish we ordered was the flank steak, ordered medium rare, and made with perfection. It was definitely big enough to split. The chimichurri sauce, plantains, and yucca nicely complements the dish. The service and food was great!

2009-12-08,4.0,"My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. I had heard many good things about Las Tablas from a co-worker who is Colombian and we thought it might be worth checking out.  We made reservations for Saturday night. I highly recommend making reservations as this place gets extremely busy. We had 8:00 reservations and it was pretty packed, and people were waiting to be seated.  I was really impressed with the menu options. We started off with a pitcher of Sangria which really was the best I have EVER had. I usually prefer the white Sangria but this one was so good we practically finished the pitcher. And at $24 a pitcher it was a sweet deal. Next we ordered the empanadas. The appetizer comes with 6 empanadas (2 cheese, 2 beef, and 2 chicken). The cheese were my favorite. For dinner I ordered the shrimp and steak combination and my husband ordered the steak and chicken combination. Each dish was served with a plantain, yucca and a half of potato. My only complaint was the my steak was over cooked and my husband's steak was undercooked.  I would definitely go here again but probably not get the steak. Believe it or not I thought the chicken and shrimp were much better. I did give it 4 stars though not as a steak house but as an overall restaurant.

2009-11-16,5.0,"Las Tablas might be the best dining experience that I have had since starting writing reviews for Yelp. This place just blew my mind.  This place offers great food and great service with a great attitude. What I mean by that is, the people who work at Las Tablas really seem to enjoy their job. The food and beverage business can be daunting to say the least. I was a bartender many moons ago, and I can attest that if you work for a place that promotes a fun atmosphere, it really comes across in a positive way to the customers. Las Tablas does a wonderful job in making it's customers feel that positive vibe.  The food is incredible. We started out with two appetizers. We did the Empanada's and the Corn Bread. Both were quite different than anything that I have ever eaten. The empanada's were filled with Colombian goodies that tasted wonderful. And the cornbread was covered with Cheese, Mole sauce. Both dishes were wonderful.  For our entree, C.R. and I did the combination platter for two. The entree included Skirt Steak, Ribs, Chicken and Chorizo. I can't believe I was actually worried that the portions were going to be dainty. When I saw this platter of delight being carried by our server, my eyes almost bulged out of my head. Diner for two, my ass. This could feed five people. Heck, It could have fed the Baltimore Ravens offensive line. As of Monday, I still have leftovers in my fridge.  The entree was awesome. The steak was tender and moist. The ribs were crunchy and flavorful and the Chorizo was out of this world. Even the Chicken was wonderful, and as I have stated before, I don't like Chicken.  After about 45 minutes of this Orson Wells Style Gorge fest, I finally had enough. I had to throw in the white napkin. Everything on the plate from the Steak to the Plantains sated me perfectly.  I can't recommend this place enough. The food was insanely good, and the service was wonderful. If I learned one lesson from my first visit to Las Tablas, it's to lay off the appetizers.

2009-11-16,5.0,"Wow. Another amazing find in the Chicago dining scene.  Las Tablas is a Colombian steakhouse with a beautiful interior, great service and kick ass food.   We were seated immediately and ordered a couple of appetizers, the empanada combination plate (a sampling of beef, chicken and cheese...the chicken was the best I thought) and the Arepa Chorriada, which was melted cheese over arepa (basically a cornbread)  sautéed in criolla sauce.  We then decided to go with the Picada Colombiana, which according to the menu serves two.  Two what? Two Chicago Bear linebackers? Two starving Japanese sumo wrestlers?  Oh my god people, seriously this is a TON of food.  Believe me when I say you are NOT going to want to order appetizers, dessert, or any other extraneous foodie items if you get this entree.    A heaping helping combination of  Entraña skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, and chicken breast all grilled and sliced into small pieces.  Also comes with homemade chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantain, fried sweet plantain, yuca and potato.  Delicious yes...stomach busting...Oh.My.God. Yes. We had more than half wrapped up to take with us...it was just too much. But I have to say I found the chicken, the crunchy plantain and the skirt steak to be the stars of the show.  Especially if you add the Chimichurri sauce.  The flavours just explode in your mouth...yum! My one gripe is that they are not BYOB but they will let you bring in a bottle of wine for an $8 corkage fee.  OK that's just stupid and please do away with that option, Las Tablas.  It is completely unnecessary and kind of makes you look like jerks when you really aren't!

Eventhough I feel when I come here I should be different and order something that not everyone orders. But if it's good, obviously everyone is going to order it. Thus my predicament. And I have not been steered wrong. They marinate the steak in some multispice concoction which just gives the steak unbelievable flavor. SOooooooo good. And it's not marinated to the point where it's mushy either. The last time I was there I also had the ocotopus with the steak. The portions that they give are almost embarassing. I know that if I manage to eat my whole platter, I will definitely be adding a stretch mark somewhere on my body. But well worth the scarring. All of the furniture is made by a specific furniture maker somewhere in or from colombia.

THEN, once we finally got our meals, the waiter did not come back ONCE.  We sat there for half an hour, just waiting to get some freaking water, when finally another waiter basically took over, got us water, wrapped stuff up, and even got our checks.  It was like our first waiter was scared to even look us in the eye because he knew we were upset about the waiting.   So we decided to tell the manager what had happened... he apologized and went to talk to the waiter, and then they both came back together and argued with us that it was our fault for asking for 2 checks.  It then turned out that the waiter had lied to the manager, telling him that he had told us that if we asked for 2 checks this would happen, before we ordered.  IF HE TOLD US BEFORE THEN WE WOULDNT HAVE DONE IT!  WHO ORDERS FOOD KNOWING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH THEIR FRIENDS EAT??  We were so pissed at this point.  We told the manager that the waiter never told us this, that he only told us AFTER the vegetarian plates came out that ""they only take 5 minutes to cook while your plates take about 20"".   So the manager pulled the waiter back again, and then finally gave us 20 dollars off our bill.  Gee, thanks.

At the end of our meal, we all got free colombian coffee which was a delight. The service was great, but it was a little slow. Probably because it was so packed!

Nothing really that great, I'd had better. For entree I went with the combination skirt steak and shrimp. They cooked it rare just how I like it and it was well marinated.

2009-07-08,4.0,"Everyone needs to stop going to Tango Sur and start going to La Tablas. (I may have just kicked myself in the pants for saying this because it's a hidden gem, but I like to share things that are great.) First of all, it's BYOB (wine only). There is no corkage fee Mon-Wed and if you go online to their website, there is a coupon for free sangria. Use it...it's fantastic! Everytime I have been to Las Tablas I have always been seated right away. It never gets too crowded to where we have to wait. We started with the chicken empanadas and the pisao. Both were done perfectly. The fried plaintain chip in the pisao was unbelievable. I could sit down and eat an entire bag of those plain, without being topped with tender shredded beef and melted cheese! I usually get a combination plate when I go there. I've tried the skirt steak and shrimp and the skirt steak and chicken. The steak is phenomenal. Juicy and done perfectly, pink in the center, slathered in a chimichurri sauce that is thick and flavorful, not too spicy, perfect. It came with a baked potato and fried sweet plantains. The potato was dry and overcooked, but the plantains were again, delicious.  I wasn't impressed with the shrimp. I found them underseasoned and overcooked. The chicken was well done...tender and light, with a garlic and white wine sauce that wasn't overpowering.  I'm going back tonight and I'm going to try the grilled octopus and the carne asada. I will get back to you with my reviews on those!  For my money, Las Tablas is so much better than Tango Sur. It's more intimate, you get better service and the food is just as good, if not better. Did I mention the free sangria? *UPDATE*: So last night I went with the Picada Columbiana and split it with my boyfriend. Let me give you a word of warning: this is a heaping plate of meat. You will not finish it, but you will savor ever moment trying to.  Here's what's on the plate: Entrana steak, rib-eye steak, chicken, pork loin, chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantains, sweet, creamy fried plantains, yuca and baked potato.  Here's what I loved: the skirt steak. It was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. Perfectly cooked, delicious. The chicken was also in my top two. Moist and seasoned, flavorful. The homemade chorizo would be a close third, with the pork coming in last (too dry). The sweet plantains were fantastic as usual. A soft banan-ey, gooey, sweet end to the meal. Order the pisao for sure when you go. Its always been wonderful and perfectly crispy and melty. We had the chicken pisao this time. Mmmmm.

Tucked away near the Southport/Lincoln intersection, it is definitely a hidden treasure. I was taken to Las Tablas on a date years ago and although the relationship didn't last, my love for the restaurant did! The menu offers authentic South American cuisine like steak, seafood, paella and some vegetarian dishes prepared in the traditional Colombian/Argentinean way. My go-to dish is the Churrasco steak, which is huge, so bring your appetite. Dishes are served on wooden slabs and include potatoes, yucca, and my favorite, the ""magic green sauce"" with which I drown everything on my plate. There is occasionally live music to listen to during dinner and on my last visit I even joined in on a salsa lesson! There are different sized tables for romantic dates or for larger groups like birthday parties. Everyone that has come to Chicago to visit me gets to check out Las Tablas.

Very very tasty.   We ordered the empanana sampler for appetizers.  The BEST empananas that I've ever had -- freshly fried.  We got cheese, chicken, and beef.  The beef was my favorite with the cheese a close second.

2009-02-14,2.0,"So I am sitting around a gay bar in Boy's Town with my wife, my buddy and his girlfriend.  We had just witnessed our other buddy's little boy get his shmeckel snipped! Naturally, the conversation turned to food.    I started showing my buddy pictures from my recent trip to Colombia when it hit me; ""I need a motherfucking Bandeja Paisa!""    I actually Yelped the closest Colombian fare and Las Tablas was the victor.  Upon entrance I noticed a lot of empty tables, yet a lot of people waiting.  When we finally did get seated - which didn't take too long, we were there @ 7:30 on a Friday - I realized we were surrounded by big parties.    Well, it took quite some time for anyone to stop at our table, 20 minutes, and when they did, they were harried and short (no not physically ya dunce).  Ten minutes later another guy came up and said, "" I see you ordered some appetizers, my name is so-and-so and I will be your server tonight.""  They need to cut that phrase out of the restaurant lexicon! Anyhow, we ended up ordering our entrees sensing the serious delay we were about to experience.    Rant portion:  When you have multiple big parties, as a server you still need to pay attention to your two-tops and four-tops (fuck a three-top).  Furthermore, as a restaurateur, you need to think about this: Who is more likely to remember your food, service and décor, the 20-top chatting away and pounding liquor, catching up on old times and not paying attention to their surroundings?  Or the two-top couple who have time to notice the pace of service and the quality of food more because they don't have 18 other people to defer to?  I choose the latter. And there seems to be a lot of big parties here.  Reminds me of Ron of Japan in that way...    On to the true test of a restaurant, the food!  The empanada was good and the other app that we ordered, patacones pisado, was most excellent and most cheesy.  The aji - the more liquidy green sauce on the tabla - was great too.  As I stated earlier, my thoughts ran and always do, to to Bandeja Paisa.  So that is what I ordered with my meat medium rare.  My wife ordered the Matrimonio with her steak medium, which the inexperienced waiter said would be cooked through due to the thinness of the meat... The two dishes came and mine was well done, due to the thinness of the cut, and my wife's was bloody, due to the thickness of the cut.    Now a Bandeja Paisa is a pretty, pretty, pretty hearty! So there is a lot to delve into. Immediately I noticed that the steak was so salty it pruned my tongue... I sent it back only by practically tripping the waiter to get his attention.  Yea it was that bad; the drinks we ordered never came despite the fact that the waiter told us he was going to get them two different times.  The funny thing was that it looked like they were amply staffed, but there were too many inexperienced jackasses, too timid to do their jobs properly!    So I sent the steak back, something I never do.  Everything else on the plate was more than fine though: arroz, huevo, frijoles, yucca, arepa, etc...  My wife's dish was great and tasty. I really like the charbroiled taste to the meat with a little aji for the heat factor...  I got my new steak back, no salt, but the waiter just threw it down and offered no apology just a, ""Here it is, it's worth the wait!"" He said that multiple times.  Dude just say you are really busy and you are sorry about the (lack of) service.  It is completely understandable to make an admission of that sort.    So I know I will go back because I have a three- strikes policy - unless we are talking about a restaurant like Gio's or Jimmy's Charhouse - but it is fairly obvious that Las Tablas has some tasty food!

2009-01-14,5.0,"What a fantastic restaurant! As a fan of Latin American Cuisine, i had my eye on Las Tablas  since the summer and finally had a reason to go a few weeks ago.  7PM on a friday night, there was a 1hr 45 minute wait for a table of 5 at  Tango Sur, and NO wait at all at Las Tablas. Service: The waiter was exceptionally kind- took the time to explain the different entrees and cuts of meat that they prepare. He said "" if the skirt steak does not make you smile when you eat it, i will personally bring you a pitcher of sangria for free"". He never had to bring the pitcher. Food:  We began with the empanadas- delicious! I preferred the beef over the chicken, even though the chicken empanadas were recommended by  the waiter. the Aji is delightful flavoring that I dunked the empanadas in (and also spread around the meat as well). I had the bandeja Paisa, which is more delicious food than i can eat in two meals. My friends had the combination skirt steak/chicken plate.  Everyone was extremely happy with the taste and quality and portion of food. Cost: Not cheap, but worth it. Entrees are about $20+ .Expect to have a $35 per person meal if you bring your own wine. (don't forget $8 corkage fee) Bathrooms:  Were SPOTLESS. top notch. Well maintained and comfortable. They even had a nicely decorated lounge in the basement as a waiting room. Environment: Wooden benches with no back, ahhh uncomfortable. But apparently quite authentic, as the waiter described this is how many Colombian ""fondas"" look. I'll buy it. Dark overhead lighting, candles on the table. Live brazilian samba music in the background, not too loud. Will be my default ""date place"". Didn't get crowded until 9PM for some reason...do colombians eat that late?  5 Stars!",0.9732,0.847,0.118,0.035,0.6281250000000002
2009-01-13,2.0,"I am erasing all those lovely, fine moments that I had experienced at Las Tablas prior to the new location...   Una GRAN Decepción! (A Great Disappointment!) I had been to this newer location before, and the prices were a bit higher than the old, hold-in-the-wall location.  Well now, the prices are even higher!  I hope it's because they moved to this larger, nicer location and had to pay off their debt.  Regrettably, I recommended that my friends and I go to Las Tablas versus waiting in line at Tango Sur.  We simply wanted steak so I figured, ""why not!""  I also kept in mind that Tablas is larger in size. We arrived and had waited an hour versus the 30 that we were told.  Recommendation 1: MAKE A RESERVATION! Once we arrived to the table, we noticed that there were 3 birthday parties.  Perhaps this is why it took our waitress 20 minutes to attend to us.  Once the waitress arrived, she apologized and was super sweet.  They were understaffed on waiters, yet not water fillers/busboys.   We ordered different empanadas ($2 each--not bad) which were pretty delicious...Or perhaps this was because we were already starving and I had partially lost my appetite.  We received our food about 45 minutes later (making our visit 2+ hours long).  Their chimichurri is really what gave their items the flavor.  I don't know why rice and beans doesn't come with every entree, but they don't (only the vegetarian or the ""authentic"" Colombian Bandeja Paisa platter).  It didn't matter to me after I tasted the beans and rice and they seemed aged and sour?!?!  How do these two get that way, no idea?  The potatoes were undercooked, while the yuca was tasty. Recommendation 2: Don't BYOB unless you're aware of their BYOB policy: Only Wine and a corkage fee of $8 applies when it's not Monday thru Wednesday.  Hell, I ain't going to pay for what I already paid for!  Their sangria was lame, yet their mojitos were pretty tasty. Recommendation 3: There is a live band hidden in the corner.  We weren't sure where the music and voice on the speakers came from until we left haha.  But they played what sounded like Brazilian samba or Gilberto Gil.  Not too Colombian if you ask me... On an end note, I will not return but would visit the other Colombian restaurant a few blocks north on Lincoln.  Ay ay ay, It's was a sad, sad day for authentic Colombian food in Chicago.",-0.5365,0.827,0.091,0.082,0.5323060966810967

I was getting ready to go with my relatives and friends (8 people) and then I received a called from the restaurant saying that they were closed for the night. I asked them why and they said that it was very slow for them and they will be better off just closing the kitchen,cancelling reservations and sending everybody home. I asked to talk to the manager and they said that he was gone as well. They did not offer an apology or anything else to compensate this outrageous attitude. I think we should give them a lesson and never visit this place again. Who do they thing they are? The best place in Chicago?

Which to me is a perfect place to relax and have a nice dinner with close friends or loved ones. But I was GREATLY disappointed that where was absolutely NO wine/alcohol/beer menu. In fact, when I asked the waiter what was available for wines because they don't even offer beer! He vaguely went through types of wines not even listing prices or brands... which is extremely odd for a nicer restaurant. In fact, I think altogether one of the reasons why this place doesn't score 4 stars with me is the lack of Beer at all, and also their beverages like soda pop are NOT free refill. However the food is good but not excellent. We firstly had the cheesy cornbread which was by far the best thing I ate there. Then I ordered the New-York Steak with Calamari and it was all seasoned very well. But the sides were only mediocre and I felt like overall something was missing from the $20 entree. The service was just okay as well- our waiter seemed very aloof and didn't come by often enough- especially near the end when I was ready for the check and it seemed to just take forever. Overall the place had a nice atmosphere and offered some uniqueness that other places don't have.

Ahem. Notice I say ""tried"" because 1. I didn't leave much 2. I hope his hand doesn't hurt too badly where the fork got him. I think it says something when a man is willing to be stabbed repeatedly with a fork in a vain attempt to obtain a scrap of buttery, juicy, succulent, perfectly medium rare meat from a girl who's cute but not too willing to share the yumminess.  We enjoyed the Mojitos- lots of crushed mint, lime and sugar. I can't imagine what something so scrumptious wouldn't go with. Though I was told the Mango Mojitos were the most delicious- I couldn't say,  they were all out (they use fresh Mango, not the artificial stuff from a bottle or a powder packet).

I'll admit that I was a tad bit skeptical about eating Colombian food.  I mean, let's be honest, Colombia is a country known for Drug Trade (specifically Cocaine) , Guerrillas (not Gorillas),  Dirty Politics, Human Trafficking and now... Skirt Steak! For you non-Spanish-speakers, ""Las Tablas"" is Spanish for ""The Tablas""  The ambiance of Las Tablas is very laid back with Latin music playing in the background.  The lights are so dimmed that you almost need the candles to read your menu... It's a great place to come with a date!  Pretty much everyone will look better with the lights this dark... so if you're not bringing your ""A"" game, or if you're trying to hide a zit, check it out! But seriously, eating in the dark is pretty cool... We started with a couple Arepas and a couple Empanadas... the Empanadas were so flavorful with the perfect blend of spices, so as not to overpower the dish.  The Arepas were very traditional, unlike the sweet Arepas I have grown to enjoy. We also tossed back a few Colombian beers which were pretty tasty! I highly recommend the skirt steak entree, which I recall to be named ""Entraña"" which was recommended to us by our server.  I know he is Colombian, but his accent bore a striking resemblance to that of the legendary Ricky Ricardo, ""Lucy, you got some 'splainin to do!  AH AH AHHHH!!!""  But who knew Skirt Steak could be so doggone tasty!  Pretty much all entrees are served with a side of Yuca (Not Yucca, like you put on your sunburns), Plantains (who doesn't love bananas?!?) and Potatoes. Whoever said that there is always room for dessert is a frickin' liar! Honestly, I wish I had saved room for dessert! Seeing as how I couldn't feel my toes, because all the food in my belly cut off blood circulation to my lower extremities. As far as drinks go, they have a BYOB that applies to Wine only, and they charge $8.00 on Thursday through Sunday... but Monday through Wednesdays corking is complimentary... I am eager to try their Sangria, per their website, it's ""Famous"" and who doesn't love Famous?!? At the end of the day I would recommend Las Tablas to anyone with an appetite for exotic and spicy foods!  If you have a bland palette, this is not the place for you.   Las Tablas is great at accommodating large groups!  There was a huge group (20+) of Emo/Hipster kids sitting next to us and each and everyone one of them had a smile on their faces!  If more than 20 depressed Emo kids can have fun at Las Tablas, pretty much everyone will enjoy it!",0.9925,0.775,0.16,0.066,0.6058380018674135

Upon walking in, I thought the place had a very warm ambiance. It was like a cabin-in-the-woods, but in South America, not Minnesota. The art was cool, the layout was cool, I even liked the floor. My friends and I immediately were saying how cute it was.  I started with sangria. Great price, very yummy, and a large glass. My friends got mojitos. I really really liked how they were tart and sour rather than totally leafy minty.  They bring you the steak sauce before you even get any food. So I just sat there staring at it wanting something to put it on so badly I almost considered my hand. Instead I started nibbling it with my fork. YUM. It was perfectly spicy, and very fresh.

I told them we would finish it but they did not believe it.

In the midst of our food frenzy, our friend interrupted to say we looked like dinosaurs. That didn't stop us. Then she went on to say we looked like the Geico men. Still didn't stop us.

Las Tablas.  In other words, they've moved across the street.   With its cozy vibrant authentic feel and picnic tables (picnic tables!), I loved the old spot.  That's been traded in for what reminds me more of a strip mall joint, losing most of its visual character in the process.  Once I got over it (ok, i'm still not quite over it), I was relieved to see my favorite combo still on the menu (steak & shrimp).  I'm not a big steak eater, but I like how thin the meat is and the way it's cooked.  Even though there's some fat on there, it's so big you can easily avoid it and still fill up.  The grilled shrimp is great.  Love me some scrimps.  Plus you get a plantain and yuca with it.  It's loads of food and -for only $20 (up $2 from the last location)- it's a steal!   I was also relieved to find I could still bring in my bottle of wine.  I think they ""forgot"" to charge us the corkage fee, but I noticed it would have been pretty high at around $8.  In the end, the food was just as good as before, and my boyfriend didn't know what he was missing from the location of yore.  I'll definitely go back for the food, I just won't talk up the overall feel of the place like I once did.

Maybe it's the echo from their new location - first floor of a new construction. Or maybe I just miss the good 'ol pre-liquor license days when my group of ten would stumble out of the restaurant leaving 20 empty bottles behind. They still allow personal wine but it just doesn't feel the same. Like I said, the food itself has remained excellent. Different from a top steakhouse but delicious nonetheless. I recommend the matrimonial, which is a big piece of chicken and a big piece of steak. The steak and calimari is also very good. Empanandas are just ok. They also have a (sparsely attended) but very delicious brunch on the weekend. It's an all you can eat for I think $12.",0.9887,0.766,0.219,0.015,0.5271556473829201

Las Tablas.  My first experience with chimichurri was good... even with all that fresh garlic and coriander I did not get heartburn (wheew!)  I ordered grilled baby octopus and was not impressed.   The seafood was rubbery and hard to break up in my mouth- Indicative of either poor quality products or an inexperienced grilled master.  The rest of the crew ordered steak.. though heavy it was very flavorful.  The highlight of my meal was the yucca side dish that came with my platter.  The unique flavor and texture was perfected!  However, a couple of stars were docked because of service and ambience.  The service was poor.  Even on a night with few covers,  the waiter came by the table once after ordering and my water glass and dropped utensil suffered.  In my opinion, if owners are going to remodel and expand, then please spend some money to train or rather retrain the waitstaff.  Secondly, the ambience was very drafty and austere for a Latin restaurant.  I was hoping for live music or at least some music to add to the experience.  However I just heard the rumbling murmur of other conversations... how  boring for a culture that embraces a colorful livelihood.",0.8687,0.836,0.103,0.061,0.5565217391304348

It recently located across the street to a larger space with swanky interiors, and authentic Colombian artifacts all over. They even created this quaint sitting area downstairs outside the restrooms. On my last visit, on 03/05/08, they even had this guy singing Colombian music.  The Food In 3 words...'to die for'!! Forget those pricy Brazilian steakhouses. If you want good Chicken/Steak/Shrimp dishes , Las Tablas is the place to go. For those of you who are familiar with Latin food and have been to and love Tango Sur, I still recommend Las Tablas. The menu is authentic and fairly elaborate and they offer combos...can't beat that! The Alcohol Till very recently, Las Tablas was BYOB!! Don't worry it still is to an extent. Although they have a full bar with ample beer & wine selection, you can bring your own wine but beware of the corkage fees. During the week, its an affordable and reasonalbe $4 but during the weekend its a whopping $8. Also if you love Mojitos, which I totally do, you have to have to get one here.

Neither of us were thrilled with our entrees either - which for a paella quoted at 40 min. came out in about 10 and because it was hot and I was hungry I ate it - Blake had strong feelings about it otherwise.  All in all - if you want Argentinian style dining do Tango Sur - far far far superior to this disappointment.",0.9465,0.858,0.109,0.033,0.6750930356193514

2007-03-30,3.0,"Las Tablas has a great look to it: Simple yet tasteful decorations adorn the walls, low mood lighting gives the place a comfortable feel to it (and makes me look dang good!), and the little bar at the entrance is spacious enough to hold those waiting for a table. As soon as we walked in, I had a good vibe out of the place.  And then my friend pointed out that there was a ""funky"" smell to it. I thought it smelled like pescado frito (fried fish), but she said it smelled like paint, which would make sense (I guess) given that it is a new location. But it didn't bother me much.  The food itself was good, but not amazing - definitely 3.5 to 4 stars worth (I will explain why I gave the place 3 in a little bit). I shared the big plate Para Dos (for two) with one of my friends. The red meat selection was very good, but as one reviewer pointed out, not as good as Tango Sur. If I were to return to this establishment, I would definitely go all-beef next time. The chicken that came on the platter was okay, but my other friend's order of Pollo al Ajillo (garlic chicken) was excellent, though as someone pointed it out to me, there is no smooching after eating that! What really caught my attention were the papas amarillas (the little yellow potatoes) that just melt in your mouth, along with the chimichurri-like sauce, yu-um! The yuca was good, but somewhat dry, and the sweet plantain.... oh God... that was simply divine (I could eat that for breakfast, lunch AND dinner), though you can get sweet plantains of equal (and sometimes better) value in other restaurants as well. Finally, what blew me away was the corn-bread (though it tasted like cheese to me) that they served with the meals. I can't even begin to describe it - you just have to try it for yourself.  Now, though the consumption part of the evening was very, very good, the service part pretty much sucked. Yes, the portions were big, and yes, it was delivered faster than I expected, but there were a number of things that bugged me and contributed to the lower score: Point 1: Though the flan was really, really good, the arroz con leche (rice pudding) was served in its original container - i.e. the one that it gets packaged in when it is delivered from the store!! Do what other restaurants do: Put it in a bowl and make me think that you made it! Come on people, LIE to me! Point 2: On the big platter two of us shared, they served us with HALF a piece of the corn-bread thing! Come on people! There are TWO of us eating over here! At least give us a whole piece so we can each have at least half, not a meager quarter! They probably run out of the bread, bringing me to.... Point 3: It seems that they run out of *everything* I wanted! First, the passion fruit drink, then corn-bread, then every single dessert in the house except for the flan and arroz con leche. I understand that restaurants (especially popular ones) can run out of things, and that's okay, but the server didn't even seem to care! Bringing me to.... Point 4: The service itself was horrible. The story goes like this: Two of my friends showed up late and our server brought them menus, saying he would be back in a second, but taking a second times 720 instead (okay, that was a dorky math joke to point out that he came back 20min later...sheesh). Now, I know the restaurant is busy, and I know that servers have more than just one table to take care of, and normally I don't really care it taking so long, except this time I did. Why? Because not only wasn't our water glasses filled up once, but he came back to tell us that the grill had already closed and that my buddies couldn't order. The thing is, he never told us the grill was closing! AND, to further fuel the fire, he started blaming THEM for being late, and US for not calling ahead of time and letting them know that people would be coming late!! A friend of mine told him in Spanish that it was okay, that it wasn't a problem, but this individual kept going on and on about being their fault for being late. I found it offensive that he would be saying this  in Spanish about my friends who didn't speak a lick of Spanish, and that he didn't even apologize for not letting us know that the grill was closing after he brought the menus for them to order. And so, I respectfully just turned to him and said that there is no problem, but he should keep in mind that he could have mentioned all of this earlier. I was on my best behaviour that night =) Would I return to this location? Nope. But I was recently informed that the location on Irving Park Rd is not only much better, but has their liquor license and serves a killer Sangria. I think I will go to that Las Tablas next time instead. And I hope the service is much, much better, if anything for my own piece of mind.",0.9987,0.778,0.163,0.059,0.4663163027448741

Tender, yet flavorful.  The empanadas are the best in the city!  Wash it all down with the beverage of your choice (it's BYOB) and enjoy some flan for dessert. A wonderful night out for a date (if you're really fun-loving, it's great for your first!) or out with a group.",0.9888,0.769,0.219,0.012,0.5253932178932179

2006-05-13,3.0,"The food was very good, but the atmosphere was chaotic for my taste. My wife and I went on a Friday night and the place was packed. We didn't have to wait for very long, but the volume of our fellow diners was almost unbearable. There were quite a few large groups with people yelling across the table to each other. I definitely walked out with a headache! That being said, I'd reccomend the shrimp and steak combo, which was cooked excellently and with interesting spices. The service was friendly, although not that attentive. Maybe try it on a weekday, when the crowds are probably a little more tame.",0.9445,0.802,0.162,0.036,0.5246336996336998
2006-04-18,4.0,"This place is amazing!  First of all, its BYOB so the drinks are cheap.  I ordered the House Specialty and it was the biggest steak I have ever seen, but I had no trouble finishing it.   The guava and plantains covered in cheese is a surprisingly good appetizer.   Always a fun place to go.",0.8147,0.681,0.218,0.101,0.48888888888888893

2006-02-02,3.0,"The meat was fabulous. The empanadas, the beans and the rice were fabulous. But the buck stopped at the rest of the starches. Bad arepas, bad platanos, and bad potatoes. I'd recommend it if you're a meat enthusiast, order accordingly.",-0.1531,0.562,0.214,0.225,0.7999999999999999
2005-11-26,4.0,"This popular Colombian restaurant on Lincoln Avenue has the same menu as the one on Irving Park. The Lincoln location is a bit cozier, with some tables having bench seating while others have chairs. Many of the meals are combo platters with numerous items on large plates that hold a wide sampling of foods. My enormous dish included steak, rib tips, beans, rice, avocado, sweet plantain, and a few other things too. You really don't need appetizers with such generous portions, but they are good, notably the plantain topped with melted cheese. The lemonade was more like refreshing limeade, and desserts like coconut flan do not remain on the plate too long.",0.9458,0.856,0.144,0.0,0.5046218487394958
2005-08-28,4.0,"Who knew there could be such an authentic taste of Columbia on Chicago's North Lincoln Avenue?  Las Tablas offers an array of tasty entrees highlighted by the signature dish ""Matrimonio,"" which celebrates the marital bliss of tender steak and seasoned chicken.  Several seafood options can also be found on the menu.  Many feature South American style shrimp.  Each entree is easily sufficient for one person with tasty Columbian favorites yuca and plantains alongside.  But for a group of four, sharing three of the main courses should leave everyone satisfied.  The tables outside the restaurant make for an enjoyable evening during the summer, yet they aren't necessarily large enough to hold everyone's small plates along with the entrees.  Service appears to be acceptable.  Although in our group there was a forgotten salad which finally arrived after the entrees.  Also when it was time to pay, the waiter suspiciously disappeared.  But overall Las Tablas is certainly a nice find in South Lakeview.  It's BYOB and the meal is reasonably priced.  Ole!",0.9674,0.799,0.153,0.048,0.4847619047619047
