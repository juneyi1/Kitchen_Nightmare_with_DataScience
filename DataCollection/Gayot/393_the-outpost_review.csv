They gave us an 8 minute warning right after they had the nerve to take our money from us and let us buy 2 gin and tonics and a $17 pitcher of beer. As we were sitting there trying to finish our drinks, one of the male workers pushed into our circle and ripped our pitcher right out of our hands. After several minutes of us trying to get them to let us have our drinks back, we started to leave. As we were walking out the door, the other male worker thought it was necessary to touch me and give me a little push towards the door. I understand that business was slow, but if we were just asked politely to leave then none of this would have gone down. The workers didn't even have the decency to simply say that they were planning on closing early that night and it wouldn't be worth it to spend money on drinks that we couldn't finish in time. Instead they took our money with no problem!

He showed the bartender his wristband and ordered 4 beers for us and another couple. With the wristband, that should have been a $4 tab. When the bartender came back she didn't give us the deal. Instead she brought over four tall boy cans and a bill for $21. My boyfriend questioned her saying that this wasn't what he ordered. The bartender claimed that she never saw our wrist bands. While passing the beers back to us, she snatched the bill out of his hand before he was even able to leave her a tip and offered to buy us shots for the confusion. That made us feel a little better about the mishap. We continued to drink there the rest of the night using the bar in the back instead of the main bar.

This place was alright, nothing really special and in this review it will probably highlight everything that you probably need to know about this place. Drinks: It's a bar. Very comparable to all the other bars around. My long island was $10. Seating: Plenty, and even outside because they have seat warmers. However, if you do decide to sit outside be prepared to have a lot of pauses between your conversation as the metro shows no mercy in sound. The location of this place isn't the best, but hey go inside and order another drink, maybe you can hear better afterwards! Live music: Yes, there's live music. At least when I visited, however the guy left right after we got there which was around 9-10 pmish. So, sort of? Depending on what time?  Ambiance: This place gives me a feeling of game of thrones-esque type of environment or maybe like a LOTR type of place. Why? Because of the damn chandeliers! Those horned lights are pretty majestic. So, yep, that should give you an idea. Overall thoughts: Nice inside, if you can't get a place inside I wouldn't suggest you to have a full blown conversation outside.

He mumbled yes, and said to my guy friend, ""but I don't know if I'm going to let you in.""  Because my friend was not drunk at all and one of the most mild mannered people you could ever meet, we asked why.  He said, ""because you're annoying me.""  Okaaaay...not cool.  We were dumbfounded, shocked and I was annoyed....but we let it go. He had absolutely no reason to 1. say that he was going to refuse my friend entry or 2. be ""annoyed"" by my friend.

Sure enough, at bar close he sucker punched and attacked one of the guys who had helped throw him out.  The manager knew he was planning to attack the guy right at the steps of the bar, but allowed him to stand and wait for an hour, then pretended to help break up the fight once it had been going on for over a minute.

I was down about my now ex-wife leaving me and my friend said to me ""you need Houndstooth""...and he was right. On average this place is frequented by a lot of women but more importantly VERY friendly people.  I make friends pretty much every time I go.  The staff is amazing. A special shout out to Billy, Mary-Kate and Carmen who serve me VERY quickly every time I approach the bar or see them on the floor. (Even on the nights where you have to crowd surf.-That's real service right there, they know their regulars and they take care of us.) The door guys are equally on par.  If you frequent the bar enough you can usually skip lines, again this is business that knows how to treat the people that are loyal to it.  If you go during a country night (Tuesday-Thursday-Sunday) and aren't a beer snob you're going to have a blast and save money while doing it. Between 5 dollar 40's, 6 dollar pitchers and 3 dollar fireball shots there's really no way to lose. (Unless you hate country music.) I will say the one bad things about this bar is that it's small. On popular nights there's a line and it gets beyond crowded. You literally have to climb through people at times but usually it airs out if you can endure. I personally think it's worth it to stay because you really do wind up having a good night most of the time.  Lastly I'll say this. For me Houndstooth is magical. So much so that I have a friend helping me write a book about our various romantic entanglements that have happened thanks to this place. I still remember a night a female friend and I lost each other and didn't see each other until the end of the night, us both kissing new people we met at the bar. And yes that will happen. People make out at hounds a lot but thats part of the fun.  I'm not a ""I just want to get laid"" type of person but this bar is known for that.  I've been lucky though that I've managed to get quite a number of dates and even potential girlfriends from my interactions here.

We stood in line for about 20 minutes outside the bar; there is an exterior door that leads to a foyer area and another set of doors that lead in to the bar. When we got to the front of the line, we opened the exterior door to try and stand inside the foyer. Immediately a bouncer (African American male) came outside and told us to, ""shut the damn door"", and yanked it shut in our faces. We were a little surprised by his reaction, but we complied and continued to wait outside another 10 minutes or so.  Shortly thereafter, 5 people rushed past us from the street and ran in to the bar! We were a little beside ourselves when they went straight past the bouncers without getting stopped! I opened the door to try and go in to tell the bouncer, and I was immediately ambushed by TWO bouncers: The same guy who had told us to close the damn door, and a white, male, bouncer who was a little on the short side.  The white bouncer screamed at me, ""What the fuck are you doing? You thought you were just going to go inside the bar like nothing?! Get the fuck back outside! You're not getting in here--get the fuck out of the line!"" When my friends and I tried to tell them they just let 5 people go IN the bar like it was nothing, they both proceeded to start shoving me outside!

One word of warning though...IT GETS VERY CROWDED!  I don't mind this much at all but some of my friends can't stand this and don't go here anymore.  Be prepared to push your way to the bathroom because nobody is going to make way for you.  Sometimes you'll be singing along with 25 perfect stangers to Florida Georgia Line songs and I've made friends with a few other regulars that come here.

Bouncer was a total jagoff with way too much ego for someone who is bouncing at an Alabama football bar in the middle of the day.  2. Place was packed. Like, fire hazard packed.

It's not like the place was packed or wild...it was a Wednesday night.  Like I said, with the amount of bars in Wrigleyville, I'd expect this type of place to try and stand out in the crowd, and it failed to do so. I will take my business to one of the dozens of other bars within walking distance. It was one of those situations where I could walk into a random bar down the street, and the experience would probably be better.  The place wasn't bad.

2012-06-19,1.0,"I frequented this bar for almost the last 2 years....sometimes multiple times a week...  UNTIL I GOT BANNED. Yep. You read correctly. I got banned from a bar in Wrigleyville. (sad to think that's even possible for anyone, but especially me...miss perfect, goody two shoes, straight A's, never got a ticket, never been in trouble with the law, gets along with everyone, lil old me). One fine Thursday country night at about 11:30pm, one of the 2 times I was in that bar 95% sober, I waited my turn to get my pitcher of beer. The fat trashy red headed bartender who dyes his beard and wears bandanas to hide his receding hairline, Billy McFat as I like to call him, comes up to the guy standing next to me to take his money for the drinks he just ordered. At the same time, he takes the $10 bill I was holding..... and walks away. Says nothing. Not one word. Doesn't take my drink order or anything. Doesn't hand me a pitcher of beer. Nada. And walks to the register. Naturally as anyone would, I yell, ""Hey where are you going with my money!?"" I assume he can't hear me over the loud country music and he comes back with the other guy's change and I try asking again where my money is..... His response, ""CALM DOWN YOU F*CKING PSYCHO BITCH."" Wow. I've been coming to this bar for almost 2 years, helping to pay these bartender's bills with my tips. He knows who I am yet knows nothing about me personally....and he has this to say to me!? Really bro?? It's not like I was some random annoying drunkass. I've never been in there to cause trouble. I've never given him a hard time. I go there to listen to country music and have some brewskis. I've never had a conversation with this guy aside from ordering a drink. But I'm dumbfounded that a grown ass man would talk to another human being like this, especially a girl. Yet, maybe I shouldn't be surprised... I mean, consider the source. Anyways, I try to explain that normally you take someone's drink order before their money...at least that's how I've experienced it over the last 6 years I've been going into bars. (I must be crazy or something!?) I take my money that he pulls out of I don't even know where and I tell him I'll get a drink from someone else. He tells me that I am no longer going to be served. Tells the other bartender not to serve me. And tells my friend later that night that I will never be served there EVER again. This isn't the first time I've heard him talk to a person like they were a piece of $h*t. I've heard him call people out for not tipping enough on jamo shots that he poured directly out of the bottle. Hard work for a fat man, I guess... I gave it a couple months and tried to go back out of my love for country music. I'm not one to let some fatty ruin my good time. Oddly, he was at the front door that day and wouldn't let me in. He claimed that the night of the incident, at 1:30am (which he is sadly mistaken about because it was only 11:30) he was on his way to get me a pitcher of Coors Light after he took my money. Hmm that's funny because I normally order Bud Light?? (And not only that, I was standing right next to the tap.) He told me that I was never going to be allowed back in just because he doesn't like me, plain and simple. OOokkk, and not only are you a sorry excuse for a human being but you don't own the place and just for the record, you are a bartender and you open beers for a living. Give me a break.

We made our way south along Clark, as usual, post-game, hitting all the usual places.  Once you leave Bernie's and take one step to the south, Wrigleyville goes downhill very quickly.  Casey's?  Gross.  Sluggers?  Foul.  Barleycorn?  Disgusting.  Making your way south on Clark post-game is like traveling deeper and deeper into the bowels of hell.   Well, after becoming caked in beer, spit, sweat and vomit at the four establishments we hit further north on Clark, we ultimately came to Houndstooth and decided to duck in for a pop.   I'm going to assume Houndstooth takes its name from the houndstooth chapeau that Paul ""Bear"" Bryant used to wear.  I believe I saw some security guys wearing ""Roll Tide"" shirts, but I'm not so sure this is an Alabama bar per se or just a Southern bar.   What makes Houndstooth unique for this part of town is the country vibe.  They were playing all country music on a Saturday evening.  I'm not a fan.  And then there were the aforementioned dudes yelling at the televisions.  No, they weren't yelling at the Cubs.  No, they weren't yelling at the Sox.  They were yelling at...wait for it...NASCAR.  Hooo-weeee!  Hay-ull ya!  Bad ass?  I guess there's a first time for everything.  This is the first time I've ever heard anyone yelling at cars going in ovals on a television.  But hey, there were three big crashes in the last 3-4 laps.  Wooo-hooo!  That's the only reason anyone watches that garbage anyway, right?  I digress. Okay, well, Houndstooth otherwise is a patio, a somewhat small inside bar area that's cramped because of the tables on the left as you enter the bar, sports on TV, NASCAR on TV and some seriously hot Southern belles pouring the suds behind the bar.  Best looking bartenders in the city, y'alls.  Yes, mam.

The first time I was there was on a Tuesday night and their was a decent crowd but nothing ridiculous.  The service was very quick and they were on top of my drinks to make sure I didn't go thirsty.   The next time I went was on country night which was a Thursday and it was packed.  I am a country fan so I thought I should still go in and check it out.  I am glad I did.  I wasn't long before myself and a friend found some ladies to talk to and ended up hanging out with them the rest of the night.  I will for sure be going to this bar again and hope they continue country night every Thursday.,0.9715,0.826,0.15,0.023,0.48904320987654326

This bar is all about the South.  Ironic that it somehow ended up smack dab in the middle of my 'hood, but whatever.  If you are a Bama fan, you are probably retaining an attorney to fight Yelp in court for not  giving you the option for 6 stars. I was here for the Cowboys game last night, and it is also a 6 star bar if you are a Cowboy fan, which I happen to be, but I have my limits, which I'll get to in a minute.  You won't find a better place to watch the Cowboys outside of the state of Texas than right here.  Unfortunately I got here too late to get a seat, not to mention it was a playoff game, so I'm sure the seats were taken by 11AM.  It's waaaay too small for as popular as it is, because I swear I've been in here ten times and my ass has yet to touch a seat or a stool. What do they feel like? Does anyone here know? Can any of you guys tell me?  Curious minds want to know. & of course you have Country night on Thursdays. The regulars who attend are also salivating over a 6th star, and I can hear them all the way from my Condo when the heat or air conditioning fan is on auto mode and I get an audio reprieve.  I've been there once for Country night, and it was the worst 13 minutes I've ever had a in a tavern in Chicago, and we've been escorted out of a handful back in the day. This was the worst.  But everyone there was orgasmic over the entire situation so how can I fault anyone other than myself? The food is pretty good, and you can tell they put an honest effort into replicating true southern cuisine.  My recommendation would be for them to bulldoze the place after football season and make it three levels. They need it to accommodate the demand and possibly expand outside of their base.   If you're from the south or have southern love, come on down, this place is for you.  For the rest of us, go on Tuesday or Wednesday nights only or don't bother period.

Moving on.....  We then asked about the daily special that was printed on the menu she said those specials are only in affect if you ask for them....ehh ok she seemed very confused/frazzled and dis trout. She only had 4 tables but was clearly overwhelmed with this situation of knowing the menu and specials. When we ordered the nachos and potato skins AS AN APPETIZER -OUT FIRST she didn't write anything down and then took our food order for dinner, we told her FOR OUR MAIN MEAL we would like a burger and a sand which. about 15 minutes later we are still waiting and no food, we asked her if she put in the potato skins and nachos AS AN APP and she said no she put in the whole order together.....  WHY WOULD WE WANT 4 plates of food to come out all at once, I told her not to even bring the nachos and potato skins at that point and she insisted that they were already up and that she had to bring them out and I told her I wasn't paying for them, I didn't want them so she said that we would have to speak w/ a manager.  The manager who was the bartender and a kid came up and was like so you don't want them, and I looked at him and said umm no we told her we wanted them out first as an app and she didn't do that, now our burgers and sandwiches are here why would we want that food now and he is like well most people order the appetizers as meals so she might have gotten confused. HOW DO YOU GET CONFUSED WHEN WE SAID AS AN APP!!!???  SO KELLY WAS THE WORST SERVER EVER!!!  SO SLOW SO OUT OF IT!!!

All we ordered was 2 pitchers of Miller Lite (only $5 each!) and 2 orders of their $1 sliders.  The waitress told us sliders come with onion and cheese.   Not a single slider had onion.  Even when we placed our second order of sliders and brought it to our waitresses attention that the 1st order had no onion and we had wanted onion on ours, she promised up and down that this time we'd get our onion.  That she'd go back into the kitchcen personally and make sure of it.  They came to the table without onion.  Geesh!  How hard was our order, really? When the first order of sliders came I asked for them to bring ketchup/ mustard (not an odd request) and 2 plates.  The guy (who supposedly doesn't speak a lick of English) just tossed a platter of sliders on the table and walked away.  No napkins. No utencils. No ketchup or mustard and no plates to eat off of.  I asked him for the plates and he gave me a ""drop dead b*tch"" look and walked away.  We had to wait (as our burgers got cold) for the waitress to come check on us to get plates from her.   We had to ask for our tab twice.

We'd staked a spot that we weren't about to give up, so we stayed...for 4+ hours.  We stayed through a group of douchetastic guys dancing on and around the table next of us (guys who surely if sober and witnessing what they were doing, would surely have an unpleasant outpouring of homophobic phrases.)

The first time I walked by -- on my way to Goose Island for another event -- I'd just left another Wrigleyville bar, where I'd seen Michael Phelps win his 4,732nd gold medal, and overheard ""Proud to Be an American"" blaring from the bar's open windows. How appropriate. I grew up in Kansas, listening to country music in my dad's truck, driving around the suburbs with the windows down, heat blasting, in the middle of winter while he smoked a cigar. So it's safe to say there's nothing remarkable (or ironic, or so uncool it's cool) to me about hearing country music anywhere, much less in a place like this. But when I can describe the bar's decor only as ""red on the ceiling, a sea of homogenous people as far as the eye can see, beer on the floor,"" it's even safer to say this place is not my scene.

A few years ago, this building housed Cleary's on Clark. Cleary's was a pretty decent Irish Pub, but being across the street from the tried and true Blarney Stone probably didn't give it much of a chance. Enter Houndstooth Saloon: a southern style bar with checkered tablecloth wallpaper, low wooden tables and chairs, frying pains mounted to the wall, ribs on the menu, and ""Roll Tide"" (it's an Alabama/Cowboys bar) displayed prominently. I generally dislike bars with themes, but Houndstoooth was always good laid back fun. My next door neighbor is from Dallas, and he LOVED the feel of this bar, despite it being somewhat of a caricature of the South. I went in tonight (for the first time since Halloween) with a few friends to celebrate my new roommate's birthday and noticed that the entire bar had changed. The walls and ceiling were now bare and painted a swanky scarlet red while the seating consisted of a wall to wall black leather booth with tables and chairs on the opposite side.  My roommate's sister used to work here, and one of the reasons she chose this bar was for a specific southern style dish. Unfortunately, along with the decor, (and despite still being called Houndstooth Saloon) the Southern Flare menu items had also disappeared. She instead ordered the quesadillas and another friend ordered the BBQ wings. Both were dissatisfied. My roommate was surprised to find the quesadillas had mushrooms (it wasn't on the menu and it's not an assumed ingredient) and my other friend thought his wings were scrawny and soggy. We were taken care of well by our server and while we had an enjoyable night, we all commented that we were taken aback by the ""new"" Houndstooth. This bar isn't bad, but it's not the down home saloon vibe that we were planning on tonight.

They played a mix of 80's, 90's and current music.  I also had the chicken quesadillas and the Hush puppies here since I hadn't had dinner.  The quesos were good, but no on the Hush Puppies.  I'm going to have to agree with Kristin on a particular server - she looked like a bitch and acted that way.  It's like if you don't want to be there then go home, don't subject other people to your rude behavior and bad attitude.  People go out for a good time, not to be around crabby people.  She was very abrasive when she tried to walk around people, and seemed to have a permanent scowl on her face.  Luckily, we had another waitress who was very sweet and attentive.  She kind of looked a little bit like Reese Witherspoon in Cruel intentions.  I had a good time, and wouldn't be opposed to going back.",0.9575,0.752,0.166,0.082,0.6511355311355314
2007-01-16,4.0,"This is a perfect little place to go when you want to watch a game, or have a few low key drinks in the neighborhood without busting out the stilettos and tube tops (if that's your thing)...  Extremely friendly staff, good drinks and a generally a really fun crowd.  I was there this past weekend to watch the Bears play, and got a table 10 minutes prior to kickoff. The food is really good too.  The bf loves the pulled pork sando and I am a fan of the buffalo chicken strips.",0.9799,0.691,0.289,0.02,0.4923076923076924
2006-06-20,4.0,"I checked out this place (formerly Cleary's) on Saturday before the Cubs game when I saw their chalkboard: $4 Bloody Marys.  Woo-hoo! (This was especially nice after my $8 Bloody at The Twisted Spoke).  Anyhoo, this place is pretty sweet and wasn't too packed for Wrigleyville game day.  Their bloodies are FANTASTIC (and comes with a decent sized beer back).  They are VERY spicy with a cajun twist.  In fact, everything here has a little Cajun something-something.  I tried the veggie quesedillas and they were good (lots-o-veggies).  There are also ribs, crab cakes, salads, etc. My one complaint is the service - our waitress was horrible and a major B when I tipped her lower than usual (but realized I did this by accident and left her more money in the end). She was not attentive at all and acted noticeably pissed when we all didn't order food - ever heard of putting on a happy face? I actually went to Houndstooth two days in a row (Sunday after the Cubs game too) and had the same waitress again (she was wearing the exact same outfit too-ick!).   All in all, I will go back for the bloodies for sure but will try to sit in a different section (one without hairy eyeballs!)",0.3897,0.859,0.074,0.066,0.5179211469534051
