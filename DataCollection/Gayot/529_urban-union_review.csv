But I've followed Chef Micheal and his amazing food from venue to venue before.  Something tells me we haven't seen the last of his innovative work.

The appetizer calamari was overly salted and the other appetizers while tasty, were very small. One of my friends asked one of the busboys for bread. He brought out a few slices of plain bread on a plate, no butter or anything. Imagine our surprise when we received our bill and we were charged $10 for the bread!! When I asked the waiter about this, he said that the bread required the labor of baking it and that's why we were charged. I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants and have never heard something so ridiculous and laughable. We could have eaten at Joe's Stone Crab for the price of this meal. Extremely overpriced.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, I sat at the bar, my server/bartender Brian was very warm and friendly and knowledgable.  Ordered a glass of the Sicilian pinot grigio and the beet salad with frisee, marcona almonds. It was very fresh and the texture was just right. Next, I tried the ricotta gnocchi, I was hesistant because it sounded very rich & heavy, between the ricotta & italian sausage.  I couldn't have been more wrong! The gnocchi was light and fluffly the sausage was small (not huge pieces I thought it would be) and the brown butter/garlic sauce was delicious rich but not too much.  As far as the portion size, they are small plates. I thought it was perfect for just me. I didn't order any entrees though so not sure about the size/portions.. but if you want a light bite while you sip on some wine this place is perfect. I had an email promotion for a free chef's choice dessert which the chef graciously accepted. He even followed up with me to make sure I was happy. the plating was absolutely beautiful. Chocolate sauce drizzle over chocolate caramel ''cookies''. I ate the whole plate! I asked to switch to a dessert wine, and Brian found me a perfect (not too sweet) Moscato, he even wrote down the name for me, so I could try to find it and buy a bottle.. Very kind of  him.  I would definitely go back to this place, it was a real treat for me to be welcomed with open arms and be allowed to try things and talk to other ''foodies'' like myself.",0.9964,0.747,0.224,0.029,0.6720595238095237

2013-03-01,2.0,"Food: good. Service: abysmal. We went on Valentine's day, ugh, I know. I hate going out on Valentine's day, but we decided to do something more moderately priced instead of our usual upscale to avoid the intense business associated with the holiday. Big mistake. Our server, Patrick, described himself as a musician, and that was evident. Not that I have any idea if he's any good at music, but he couldn't possibly be worse at it than he is at being a server. Upon greeting our table, he was chomping on a WAD of gum. Not a piece, like a wad that a second-grader would be feverishly chewing away at after emptying a gumball machine. Seriously. That was so off putting, but because it was Valentine's day I tried to suck it up. I wanted a glass of white wine but asked for a couple of tastes. He brought me only one of the two I asked to taste, one was my choice and one his recommendation. He brought only his recommendation which did not fit what I was asking for at all - I asked for slightly sweet, full bodied, not acidic, with a crisp, clean finish. His recommendation was acidic, tart, and lingered in my mouth! Ugh. So he knew nothing about wine despite making a recommendation. The worst part wasn't even that he didn't know what he was talking about, it was the way he talked to me. He literally said ""let me know, and if it's not your jam we can find something else."" NOT MY JAM? MY JAM? Uggggh. Learn to speak to people with respect, you hack. Anyway, I ordered my choice off the wine list and lo and behold, it was just what I wanted. Sigh - if you want something done right, do it your damn self. Once I finally had my wine, after 20 minutes of dicking around, I asked about the brussels sprouts appetizer, which included pancetta, but after telling him that I'm a vegetarian, he said it could be made to suit my dietary restrictions, so we ordered it. The dish came out about 10 minutes later WITH pancetta and slathered in the bacon vinaigrette that he promised to leave off. The only way we noticed is we asked the food runner to confirm and she went over to ask him, and he told her it wasn't, so he put in the order for a new one. Ugh. When it finally came out, properly made, it was good. Not great, but alright. We finished our appetizer long before our server took our dinner order, and when he finally did come over, my husband asked if the salmon was wild caught and Pacific or Atlantic. Because fish farms are evil and Atlantic salmon tastes like literally nothing when you're using to eating Pacific. He told us it was ""definitely wild caught"" because they don't serve farmed fish, and he didn't know if it was Pacific or Atlantic. Then he just stared at hubs, as if he should make a decision without all the facts. Hubs asked the server to go check, so he walked away, and we assumed he was checking. He came back to our table about 10 minutes later and said, verbatim, ""So, whatcha got for me?"" I had to remind him that he was supposed to be checking on the salmon, which, go figure, he forgot. Again. So he went back to check and after another 10 minutes came and told us that the salmon was farmed and Atlantic. What happened to ""we never serve farmed fish?"" Hubs then ordered the steak frites and I ordered a double order of the gnocchi as my entree. Both were good, but the steak was a little overdone. He asked for it medium well and it was definitely well done with very, very little red left in the middle. My gnocchi was good, not great, but good, and I was happy about that, but I wasn't happy about the tiny portion size. There were literally 12 pieces of gnocchi for $22. Yikes. Once we finished eating, it took another 15 minutes to order dessert, which was a chocolate caramel square and, although, small, was delicious. The server brought us a couple of glasses of moscato to ""apologize"" for his errors, but annoyed me even further by saying, ""these are from a $90 bottle of moscato"" in a very condescending way. Thanks, guy who knows nothing about wine, I'm French, I've been drinking wine since 10 years before it was legal for me to, I know a good wine when I taste one. And yes, this was a good moscato, but by being a complete and utter douche about it, you totally negated the whole purpose of your ""apology"" and left me even more pissed off than I already was! That's why I left one of the worst tips of my life - less than 10%. Not my style. Overall, I'd maaaaaybe go back. I don't know. As long as they could promise me that Patrick, the complete and utter idiot, wouldn't enter my line of vision. Because, if he did, they may have to peel me off him while prying a steak knife from my hands. The end. (That last part was a joke by the way, but I would not be happy to see his face ever again.) Edited to add: After reading a lot of the awful reviews on here, it's pretty clear that the common thread is PATRICK.

The hostess mentioned it was going to be a while and told us to grab a drink at the bar. The bar was full yet it was very obvious that there was a six top and several open tables in the restaurant. I have no issues sitting at the bar, except the bartender was inept and frankly a jerk. It took at least ten minutes to grab his attention at that point we just wanted to get away from the bar.They finally split the six top into two top tables less than 2 mins after buying drinks with the chicago's worst bartender.   Now for dinner, the food was good at least what we tasted. Two major complaints. 1) portion size of the pasta. It was a $11.00 plate of gnocchi with four pieces. Are you kidding me? I lived in Italy for 5 years and this chef should get on a plane tomorrow and try to serve a plate like this there. Urban union either thinks that we are fools or that their gnocchi is world class. House made or not, the portion size is a major mistake here chef.  2) we had almost nothing to choose from for entrees. They apparently sold out of every dish except two and elected to not tell us after eating small plates. Normally I'd take this in stride but I have to admit this was the third strike after the ignorant bartender and the nano pasta particles. Too many other places to explore for a second chance.

2013-02-15,1.0,"NO. Went to Urban Union for Valentine's day dinner with the boyfriend after both of us hadn't eaten all day and it was not a very good or satisfying experience in the end.  I would have originally given it 3 stars, but let me break it down for the -2 stars. The food tasted very good--we ordered the grilled baby octopus for starters which was heavenly.  The octopus itself had a very nice charred taste (which I love) and the zesty-sourness of the sauce married delightfully with said octopus.  For entrees, we ordered the cassoulet and grilled double cut berkshire pork chop.  The cassoulet was a party in my mouth (that's what she said!)--very nice, smokey flavor, the beans added a very nice texture to the whole dish, and the duck confit was slightly oily, but very tender nonetheless.  The pork chops were huge and I was glad the bf and I decided to share instead of eating our own entrees.  The pork jus was awesome--added just the right amount of flavor and moisture to the pork.  The only complaint I would have is that there was no garlic and it was pink...not slightly pink, but medium-cooked steak pink. Here's where the negative stars come into play. Minus 1: Our server was kind of a douche canoe.  Scratch that.  He WAS a douche canoe.  He didn't really give us any attention other than asking us for our order.  The entire time we were there, he was flirting with the hostess, telling his whole life story to another table, or talking to the bartender.  Tip: do not tell the table sitting within ear shot that you worked at Sunda and got sick of eating ""Asian"" food and can no longer stand the sight of it IN FRONT OF TWO ASIANS.  Tip #2: do not tell the table that you asked ""the kitchen to make this salad specially for you"" as if it wasn't on the menu.  Bitch, I saw someone getting the EXACT SAME SALAD.  When it came time to ask for desserts, I asked to see the dessert menu, but nothing really piqued my interest.  When he came around to ask if we wanted anything, I said no and he looked annoyed and quickly snatched away the menus.  I'm sorry..did I offend you in some way?  Should I have bought something that I didn't want to eat so it could up the bill and thus up your tip?  The tip we left, yes, was less than 20% and an asshole move on our part, but seriously.  If the busboy did a better job at serving us than you did, then you sure as hell don't deserve your 20%. Another minus 1: While the service alone should have downgraded this entire experience, what was the icing on the cake was the after effects.  When we first got the pork dish, we noticed how pink it was, but decided what the hell--we were starving after neither of us had had anything to eat earlier in the day and we've had undercooked pork at other restaurants and never had a problem with it.  BUT...good God.  Let's keep it less gross and say our stomachs did not fair well... Diarrhea and vomit.  It made us diarrhea and vomit.  Literally. It was a nice experience to try a new place, but will not be coming back here.",0.5097,0.783,0.107,0.11,0.4791633465740609

Preconceived notions aside, the evening was fantastic!  Our waiter was great and service was top notch the entire time.  They paid attention to every detail and were friendly and professional.  The ambiance was pleasant and could be played up or down; nice, low lighting, good if a bit on the loud side for dates and, it appeared good for larger groups.  They accommodated my request for a ""mocktail"" (I'm nine months preg.) without any complaints or nuisance -- so nice!     We ordered six small plates, which came out two by two in the following order: special salad with pressed duck, baby octopus, brandade fritters, special meatballs, scnitzel, and duck leg confit.  These were all delicious dishes , and the last two easily could have been plated as stand-alone dinners, which is the standard I tend to think ""small plates"" should aim for.  The plating of the other four dishes more strongly resembled starters, but because of the thoughtful way they staged our ""courses"" it worked beautifully.  Then we got two desserts-- apple cake and coconut ice cream.  The apple cake was awesome (coconut ice cream I found to be a little anemic, but ok if you wanted something on the light side, like my husband did). My food highlights: The unexpected, smokey flavor of the octopus and the tenderness of the duck leg particularly impressed me and I thought the brandade fritters were deliciously creamy.  And that apple cake was perfectly moist with delicious sauces and ice cream-YUM!  My husband loved the meatballs.  But we were both really pleased with every dish we ordered.  Bill wasn't terrible for a date evening out.

Our server was amazingly friendly and cordial. He knew the menu and the chef's tendencies...and guided us into some great choices for dinner. UU is a small plate sorta place, so be open-minded to sharing some delectable dishes! We started with the daily special, meat platter, which consisted of several Italian and Spanish meats, thinly sliced...that melted in your mouth. My personal favorite was the duck sashimi (I think it was called that). So flavorful to have duck that way! At this time we also had the crispy brussel sprouts. Uniquely seasoned with bacon, chili oil and mint...a combo you wouldn't expect but really, really yummy. We also tried the gnocchi with scallops. Was disappointed at the small scallops, but the sauce was buttery and rich.  For our entree share, we got the duck leg confit. This was my biggest disappointment of the night. The duck was overcooked and dry, which was a bummer. We also shared the cauliflower gratin that I wished would've been a tad bit hotter. Luckily, we were still riding of the high of the dishes before, so it wasn't a huge issue. For dessert we shared an ice cream trio that was heavenly. Salted caramel, cream cheese and hazelnut ice creams were a perfect end to the evening. All together, we left content, with cocktails for just around $100.

After some debate and not much help from our somewhat obnoxious waiter, who spent most of the evening ignoring us, we decided on a few different dishes to share. It's definitely a sharing type of place. I was actually pleasantly surprised when we received our food because everything tasted way better than it sounded on the menu.

The seafood salad was my favorite since everything was so fresh. Per usual, the bone marrow was lucious, gelatinous and delicious. Since portions were small, our group of 3 decided to split a few more things.  We continued with the mashed potatoes, lime corn and salt cod fritters. The fritters were our favorite.

2012-08-12,5.0,"So after a day of ambling about in the city, I decided to drop by at UIC (the school that constantly gets confused with my school) and check out the dining scene in the University Village. First off, I will say that I was very surprised. Coming into the village, I was expecting the janky/middling in quality sit-down restaurants so common in Hyde Park. What I saw was quite the opposite, Taylor Street is the paragon of a college town thoroughfare with its huge array of top notch restaurants and pubs and everything a college kid could possibly ask for. It pretty much puts the three main streets of Hyde Park to shame. Ok, enough bashing on my town. Now to the review of Urban Union. I stepped into this restaurant because the prices on the menu posted on the window made it seem like dinner would be reasonably affordable for this impoverished college student. I was to find out later that I would have to shell out at least $20 to keep my stomach satiated since this restaurant is tapas based (in other words, you're supposed to order several, like two to four per person, small dishes priced between around $5 to $20) I decided that it wasn't worth being frugal that night, and I might as well go all out since I probably wouldn't be coming back to the area any time soon. With this in mind, I proceeded to order the pork cooked in Dr. Pepper sauce and fire-grilled olives. Both of these dishes tasted incredible. I'm not the biggest fan of Dr. Pepper, but somehow, these guys figured out that making a sauce out of the drink and mixing it with horseradish mustard yields an exquisitely sweet and savory flavor. The olives were also top notch. After the main course, the server, who by the way was extremely nice and chill, came up to me and asked if I would be interested in a special $1 oyster promo that they had that night. Now, I was initially hesitant because I have had horrible experiences with oysters since childhood, but because these were so cheap and my frugal senses were tingling, I decided ""why not?"" so I ordered two. This turned out to be one of the best decisions of the night. The oysters were very fresh and I could understand for the first time in my life why people like them. To end things with a bang, my server asked if I would be interested in a special dessert that they had prepared that night consisting of three sorbets that represent different cocktails (Bloody Mary, Mimosa, and Mojito). The Bloody Mary was made with a tomato-y flavored sorbet along with minced pieces of ham soaked in vodka. The Mimosa was made with a champagne flavored sorbet and served with a slice of an orange. The Mojito was made with a lime rum-flavored sorbet and topped off with crushed mint. Needless to say, all three sorbets were absolutely amazing and were a great way to finish the meal. Although I wound up burning a nice hole through my wallet at Urban Union, I will say in all honesty that it was totally worth it. Every dish that I ordered was made to perfection. The service was warm and friendly. The ambience was relaxed. Everything was perfect. If and when I make a million dollars, I will definitely come here again, and next time I will bring good company.",0.9978,0.796,0.165,0.039,0.5117504409171075
2012-08-10,2.0,"The food was great. Standouts were the gnocchi, the marrow, and the soft shell crab special. The cheese course was excellent because the chef did some interesting pairings (like brûlée-torched fresh figs!).  The reason the star review isn't higher is because the service was off the whole night. And unfortunately, service has a huge impact on customers' impressions. When we arrived 10 minutes late for our reservation (sorry!) and another party of the same number had arrived for a reservation 20 minutes early just ahead of us, the early party got the table. Not because the hostess made a choice and seated them first. She just seated them because they were there. She didn't talk to us until after they were seated.  Not a big deal, because the bartender -- who was the only one who was on top of things -- told us they'd get another table set up right away and asked, ""why don't you have a drink with me at the bar."" I thought, ""Wow, they give away our table and we get a free drink? Great!"" We weren't in a hurry, so it was fine.  Turns out, the drinks weren't free. Ah well. Our waiter was friendly, but he seemed oversubscribed and therefore not attentive. We were celebrating an anniversary, which I mentioned when ordering the Malpeque oysters, because that's where we honeymooned. His response: ""that's appropriate.""  Then he helped me order a wine that would pair nicely with the oysters. Unfortunately, the oysters came about 5 minutes before the glass of wine. Same thing happened on my next glass, which was also to be paired with a dish. Finally, when our cheese arrived, I asked the runner if we could have some bread. He said of course. We waited and minute or so and then dug in. The cheese didn't need bread, which was a good thing, because we didn't get any. Actually, that's not true: when looking over the check, I saw the $2 charge for grilled bread. I called over the waiter. As I started to say, ""we never got this,"" the bread arrived. He waved it off and took it off the bill of course. Lessons learned: 1) when a bartender says, ""have a drink with me,"" it doesn't mean she's buying; 2) order more wine early so you're not waiting later; and 3) bring your own party, because telling them you've chosen to celebrate a special occasion with them will not result in Urban Union making the occasion more special. I would go back because the food was so good, but overall I was disappointed with the experience and won't be finding ways to make it back to Urban Union.

2012-06-13,4.0,"** based on one visit... so far ** A group of us came here to celebrate a birthday. We'd made reservations and were able to snag the chef's table. They had warned us they may not be able to accomodate us for the chef's tasting menu (4 courses paired with 4 wines) because we came on the weekend. But when we got there, they decided they'd be able to offer the tasting menu. Course 1: two halves of a soft shell crab, served on top of a bed of french pureed potatoes, and the plate drizzled with two types of aioli with a smattering of caviar.  Course 2: a deliciously dressed arugula salad, with a sardine and shaved pecorino. Course 3: pasta course with fresh sweet peas, truffle oil, and mushrooms. Course 4: braised rabbit. (i've never tried rabbit). The heaviest course of the evening and I liked it much more than I expected. I expected the meat to be much gamier, but I'd say it tastes like a cross between dark meat chicken and turkey. Course 5: ... we were served a buffet of 10 plates of dessert. Two plates of ice cream quenells, two plates of delicious sorbets (one of which was a strawberry sorbet with balsamic vinegar), and pistachio fancy cake, sticky date pudding, and some other desserts.  Each course was paired with a delicious wine. Never too sweet or too dry. The highlight was the moscato paired with dessert (which of course was sweet). I can't wait to go back and try ordering off the menu! I know it's a tough choice, between all the small plates restaurants in Chicago. What sets this one apart is that Urban Union features seafood.

2012-06-08,4.0,"Really, really good experience here.  Service was attentive and very friendly, with only one instance of our server disappearing for a bit around dessert time.  Food was creative: - Fava bean hummus crostini - these were outstanding - $5 for 3 small pieces, but I'd over it again and again. - Small bread plate - great flavor in the focaccia, but it was a but undercooked and doughy. - Roasted mussels - a great amount of mussels in a simple, but delicious broth with tomatoes.  Could have used a touch more seasoning, however.   - The garlic frites on the side of the mussels were ridiculous - perfectly crisp on the outside and pillowy inside.  If you don't like garlic, you won't like these, because they don't skimp on flavor. - Fried squash blossoms stuffed with goat cheese - honestly, you can't go wrong with these.  They're awesome.  Very cheesy, and at $9 for 3 pieces, you'll still want more. - Flank steak - a perfectly cooked steak with a delicious roasted shallot on the side.  For $12, there might not be a better steak dish around. - Chevre cheesecake - a good cheesecake, although nothing mindblowing - Copy kat - wow.  Order this if you like chocolate.  Don't if you don't.  I love chocolate, and thought this was a complete knockout and would no doubt be surprised if this becomes their top seller. A glass of prosecco, an 8 oz glass of tap red wine, and a Stella.  Everything for less than $100 - a really good value for high quality food.

2012-05-24,5.0,"Excellente!!! I was trying to decide on a place to take my gf for our 2 year anniversary and stumbled upon a  restaurant.com  gift certificate and saw the good Yelp reviews (of course) so I decided to give this pace a shot. Urban Union did not disappoint at all. They exceeded my expectations and made the night memorable. They have an extensive wine list, FRESH seafood and other ingredients, and the service is superb! We ordered a lot of dishes so I do not want to list them all but our favorites from the night,  Listed from best to still amazing.... 1. Pacific Reef Fish - oh jebus, this piece of fish was sooo fresh and so good! The fish was cooked perfectly, nice and soft on the inside but the outside had a perfect sear that added some crisp/crunch to it. And the homemade tomato sauce on top was really tasty. Throw in some fresh chopped basil, killer! Next time I am ordering 3 of these plates 2. Housemade Pasta - Tagliatelle - The noodles were homemade and you could tell with every bite. The pancetta was delicious and the thin slices of Reggiano Parmesan on top sealed the deal. 3. Crispy Artichoke Chips - Never had these before but I will be actively searching other restaurant menus for these. Interesting twist, taste almost like fries. Garnished with cheese and some type of greens and served with their aioli...mmmmmmm Dessert - Get the Campfire Delight! They plate a few blocks of marshmallows that are soft/chewy/gooey, couple graham crackers cased with chocolate on one side, and put a nice dollop of delicious salted caramel ice cream..this might have been our favorite  The service was phenomenal and made the night excellent. Our server, can't recall her name but she did have tatoos on her arms, provided 10 out of 10 service. (My gf and I both have been servers and we approved) Her recommendations were all on and she was honest about the menu. Very attentive and seemed to always be at our table when we needed her. In addition, the other servers were very attentive and constantly filled our water as well as changed our plates in a timely manner. I think we went through about 10 plates and 10 forks each throughout the meal....ridiculous.

Portions are not very big for it being tapas, one dish is perfect for two, but not a group to dig into. Its gourmet tapas for sure based on the prices of each dish.

2012-05-18,5.0,"Spouse and I have cruised past this place a few times but never made it in the door due to the crowds (we are impatient types, waiting vexes us).  But today I thought, since everyone is freaked out by NATO and is staying home, maybe we should stop by UU and see if we can score a table without a wait. Indeed, we strolled right in and got seats at the front window.  We also got the best service I've had in years: the waiter was charming, knowledgeable, helpful, unobtrusive yet always right there when you wanted him.  Same was true of all the other servers -- it was something I didn't think I would see in a restaurant ever again. No one even once interrupted our conversation, yet no server ever had to wait for us to finish our conversation because they all were observant and could pick up on non-verbal cues, the way waitstaff were 15 years ago but somehow forgot how to be (I know, I was once one of those observant yet efficient waitstaff.) My hats off to the Urban Union waitstaff, it was a lovely experience to be served so well. Now, about the food:  perfection.  I kicked it off with the Dandelion salad which was huge and delicious and a perfect accompaniement to a monster charcuterie plate from Publican Quality Meats.  Farro with mint, lemon and arugula followed (substantial and yummy - I am determined to replicate it at home).  A few chevre-filled squash blossoms (gorgeous) and rapini joined the spouse's rabbit, which was so meaty he claimed to have a hard time finishing it (but he did of course). Then the soft-shell crab, which I will be dreaming about until next spring when the season comes 'round again.  We were too full for dessert but got it anyway, the fig pudding and the pistacio fancy cake, and they were totally different from each other and yet both were terrific. We also imbibed in the lovely wine on tap. Again, our wonderful waiter (I should have gotten his name, I am a bad person) was helpful on that front. We have a new favorite restaurant.  I am really counting on the dusting of bad reviews in the mix here being mere abberations because when I go back to try some of the dozen other items on the menu that I wanted to taste, if I have a bad experience, I might cry from disappointment.",0.9926,0.746,0.167,0.087,0.5389902889902889

Make sure to soup up the broth with the bread! *Farro & Arugula - For you health nuts, this is a great dish that is also very tasty.  *Oven Roasted Fennel - YES. Even better if you enjoy it with a meaty dish. *Roasted Rapini - So good I couldn't stop eating it.  *Marrow Bones - The portion size is pretty small, but still very delicious. Loved the pickled veggies and buttery bread. *Wood Oven Roasted Porchetta - This pork-on-pork dish was so good, it made me giggle. The sea salt is a great touch.   *Cider Braised Rabbit - My favorite dish of the night. This is a must.  We also had a Soft Shell Crab dish that was lovely... as soon as we heard the word UNI BUTTER, we were sold. Worth every calorie.

2012-05-06,1.0,"One of the worst dining experiences that I've ever had. I would have given this restaurant zero stars, but it gets one for the high quality of food and product.  My parents were visiting me and my husband from out of town. I picked this place based on magazine reviews and ""foodie"" websites, and wanted to try something new. I made reservations at Urban Union about a week in advance for 7:45pm on a Saturday night. When we arrived the host and hostess told us there would be a short wait. The place was packed and the bar was full, so we just stood awkwardly by the hostess's stand. At around 8pm, the hostess said that she could seat us at the counter overlooking the kitchen. If my husband and I were here alone, it would have been fine. But a counter, and shoulder to shoulder dining is not conducive to a party of four, especially with out-of-town guests.  At about 8:05pm, we started to get restless and asked the hostess if we would be seated soon. They were having trouble turning over the tables. While I sympathize with the host and hostess because it's not their fault, I felt that the organization and reservation planning of this place is out of sync, if they can't figure out group seating on a weekend. At around 8:15pm, they offered us complimentary glasses of wine, which again I appreciated, but really we just wanted to start eating, as we were all very hungry at this point. We were finally seated at 8:30pm, 45 minutes after our reservation. It didn't make sense to me that I had made a reservation over a week in advance, but basically waited for a table as if we had never made a reservation at all.  So after we were seated it took another 5-10 minutes to get water and get information about ordering, how much to order per person because it was small plates, etc. The noise level was at a deafening volume, and we could not carry on a conversation. While the food and quality of the product was excellent, it is not worth all the rigmarole, and I am baffled by the positive reviews that this restaurant did receive.  To wrap up this review, I will summarize the rest of the evening. My father went to the bathroom and told us that it was a mess, the toilet was clogged and there were paper towels scattered all over the bathroom. Additionally, the servers were running around us so frantically that they spilled a little liquid from the vegetable plate on my father's head, and knocked over a small pitcher of cream on my husband's side of the table. Then, it took us about 15 minutes to hunt down our server to get the bill. My father had to physically get up and find him to get our check.  I would not recommend this place, period.",-0.6847,0.89,0.046,0.064,0.43833638583638584
2012-05-06,2.0,"Had a reservation for 7:45, arrived promptly, but were not seated until 8:30. What is the point of taking resevations if you are going to make patrons wait that long? Reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where the car rental agency runs out of cars. ""You know how to TAKE the reservation, you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation."" No room at the bar, so spent that 45 minutes standing between the bar and the path of the servers, so we constantly had to step to the side or get bumped. Hostess was indifferent after we declined seats at the counter (we were a party of four and really wanted to actually be able to talk to one another). Once seated we were told that the kitchen was short on glasses, so had to wait for for water, and our beer was served in wineglasses. Not a big deal for us, but indicative of bigger problems.  Glassware is cheap: if your place is so hot that you're running out of serving wear,then use some of your profits to buy enough glasses to serve everyone during the rush. The wine list is great and the margaritas were very strong, but it if you like beer, the selection is quite limited: it's not really a full bar. The beers they do have are great, however. The good news: once we were seated, the ambience was great, our servers were all great: friendly, attentive, accommodating. And the food was interesting and well prepared. Salted caramel ice cream was amazing but the deconstructed  s'more was too heavy on the marshmallow, even if it was homemade. One more major misfire: the toilets in both the bathrooms (which are single stall) were not functioning, and there was no sign to notify patrons. Nasty, especially for the guys side. Informed hostess about this, trying to be helpful, and response was ""okay""--No apology. Big missed opportunity for good customer service there. Overall the menu, servers, and ambience are great, but there seemed to be so many other rookie mistakes and/or organizational problems that it was a disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone-too hit and miss. If they can fix their reservation system, and give the hostess more training, they'll be fantastic.",0.9947,0.737,0.181,0.082,0.5291173054587688

2012-04-03,4.0,"Urban Union is yet another new restaurant to populate an invigorated Taylor street (and not a typical Italian spot at that). I was intrigued with a menu that focused on sea food, raw bar and other ""game"" animals. They also have three housemade pasta options (should be more!) and small ""field"" and sides sections. One of the highlights in the space, a small and narrow spot with most of the tables in the back, past the front room bar and the reserve-able communal chefs table. There is a lot of exposed brick, chalk boards and a great illuminated poster in the back room. Our only complaint was the noise level, which was surprisingly high even at 10pm and not a full room. We also sat under the air vents and become quite chilled but our server was very kind and helped turn the air off. I really like the concept of a heavy focus on seafood (half the menu). We didn't get to try any of the raw bar and would be very interested to sample one of the platters. The other half of the menu are small shareable plates with items from the ""pasture"" section that include bone marrow, flank steak braised rabbit and lamb riblets. Our meal started with celery root soup and a special of roast atlantic swordfish. We added two of the three pasta choices (tagliatell with asparagus, Wild Mushrooms, Pancetta, Pea Shoots, and Reggiano Parmesan; and braised pork cheek ravioli with Cavolo Nero, Zamorano Cheese, Pan Sauce and Thyme) and an order of the grilled marinated flank steak. On balance we really liked the food. The tagliatell was fantastic and larger than I expected and I preferred it to the pork ravioli (though erica liked the ravioli a lot). I also thought the flank steak was very tasty and a generous portion for $12. The soup and swordfish were nice and well thought out but didn't connect with me. We tried a trio of ice cream that was surprisingly great, though it should not be considering Pastry Chef Mitsu Nozaki is already very popular. Another bonus was the wine list and the multiple wines on tap (and priced very attractively at $10 for 8oz and up).  We liked Urban Union and can see it as a successful addition to Taylor street as well a fun neighborhood spot. I think the small plate concept is well played out and I could see Urban Union benefiting from increasing the plate size and increasing the focus on the good food coming out.

We had the grilled octopus (gimme more but little too done!), mussels with chorizo (skimped on chorizo), rapini (a little soggy), braised pork filled ravioli (gimme at least 5 of these per entree!), and the PBT! (more peaaaannnut butter ice creammm please!) Awesome service - attentive, not too pushy, and good suggestions on wine and food.  Mussels and ravioli were probably the stars for me. But I think overall I was hoping and expecting for MORE because of all that I've read and heard from friends about UU. I could have had more food per plate and a little more of a spin flavor profile-wise.  Ambiance has more character at the front of the house v. back. Appears upscale at first look but totally not. Think I gotta try the other plates because I'm a bit unsure of what they think they hang their hat on.",0.9649,0.878,0.109,0.013,0.5503787878787879

The service was excellent, the host, waitstaff, and other workers were all incredibly gracious.  We tried the grilled octopus, which managed to beat a similar dish at Ada Street, the beet and roasted apple salads, both of which were delicious, the pork schnitzel, which was perfectly crisped, the trofie, rich oxtail with a gnocchi like pasta (amazing!), the roasted Brussels sprouts rapini and frites.  Wow, what a meal!  Highly, highly recommend this spot for its amazing wine list and cant go wrong menu! Next time we will try their oysters and charcuterie, which looked like a very generous serving. Only suggestion would be to add a cheese program.  An incredibly welcome addition to the city that had us comparing it to Avec, which is a huge compliment!",0.9956,0.664,0.329,0.007,0.7432500000000001

There were two other dishes but I cannot remember what they were.  I did notice that all the plates we ordered had the house-cured bacon.  I love bacon just as much as the next guy/girl (look at my profile pic for peets sake!) but I don't need it in everything I eat.   I ordered a Tanqueray and tonic but I'm sure I was given a different gin.  I only order Tangueray when ordering a Gin and Tonic and this tasted very different.  I'm not close to being an expert on gin but I know Tanqueray when I taste it.  That wasn't it.   Service was perfect.  Our server was personable and sweet.  Even though we ordered only a handful of dishes, there was no sense of disappointment, attitude, or annoyance.  She even offered to replace my cocktail when she noticed I wasn't enjoying the one I ordered.  I didn't take her up on the offer but the gesture was appreciated.

We were both impressed by the food - which is delicious and also contributes to my 5-star rating - but I'll let the other reviews capture that.  I'd like to focus on the service.  Some other reviews have commented briefly on it being ""very attentive"" and ""friendly"" and even ""great"".  I want to expand on that a bit - the service was absolutely incredible, some of the best I've had at any restaurant.  The entire staff - the owners, the servers, the folks in the kitchen - was warm and friendly and really wanted to make our evening for us.  I felt like (and this was our first time there, mind you) we were visiting a group of good friends who happened to have a restaurant thing going.  The food came out so fast it surprised us.  The waitstaff and the kitchen were so fast, precise, and on the ball, while at the same time being so friendly that they actually managed to make us feel much less rushed than we were, much more like we had plenty of time to enjoy dinner.  We made it out with time to spare before the show started.  Urban Union turned out to have been the perfect place for dinner for the evening. We wanted to try some desserts but knew we didn't have enough time, so we asked how late they'd be open to see if perhaps we could come back after the show.  We ended up doing just that, and tried three of the desserts and some French press coffee - all good.  The service was just as incredible the second time around.  We will most certainly be back.",0.9964,0.834,0.162,0.004,0.5066893424036282

I liked it because it was on the lighter side -- but it wasn't what we'd asked for -- my boyfriend had asked the waiter for a suggestion for a full-bodied wine, and that wasn't what we got.

That said, its not perfect.  The dining chairs are uncomfortable and there's no clear plan for coats - which is an oddity in Chicago.  The plates are inexpensive ... but they are actually smaller than you will expect.  I would expect to have about 20% food per dish - or have the plates even less expensive (from $10-12 to $8-10).  Sadly, the schnitzel was underwhelming - and I REALLY wanted to like it.  This is a great restaurant, and one really worth a trip.  I love that there is now an alternative to Divanti on the street ... but get there now before it gets slammed with that same 2hr wait problem that plagues Divanti.  They don't take reservations (yet) ... so I'm going to try to get in as frequently as I can until its discovered.",0.99,0.751,0.189,0.06,0.5838103254769921

We tried roasted broccoli rabe, leeks with Dijon vinaigrette, snapper crudo with pink peppercorns and sea beans, roasted bone marrow, tagliatelle with hedgehog mushrooms, and farro with arugula and lemon.

We had the PB and C for dessert--moist banana cake, sweet-salty peanuts, chocolate sauce and tuiles. That was really nice with a moscato d'asti, recommended by someone who seemed like maybe a manager or owner. Standouts of the night for me were the pasta, crudo, and PB and C. The broccoli rabe didn't have one trace of bitterness (thanks in part to a generous amount of butter, I suspect). Portion sizes are generally on the small side, but quality is high, so value is pretty in line with other similar places in the city.  Service was very friendly and timing was good. The staff seemed very happy to be working there and eager to provide a good experience. We tried the garnacha they have on tap, which is a terrific value--a very food-friendly wine, but a little more complex than one would usually expect at that price ($7 for 8 oz).
