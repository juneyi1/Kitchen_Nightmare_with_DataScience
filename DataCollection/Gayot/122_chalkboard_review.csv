We all took advantage of the $38 prix fixe menu.  It was an incredible amount of food for an excellent price.  We were there on a Monday night and they offered a nice selection 1/2 price bottles of wine which we also took advantage of.   I definitely want to go back on a Wednesday and try the Fried Chicken and Champagne offering.

2013-06-18,5.0,"Another night at Chalkboard, and I was fully pleased, AGAIN!  I really love this place.  My hubby isn't an adventurous eater, so the fantastic chicken is what he always gets, and I go for the more unique menu items.  Last night we attended a party, there.  (I believe I was the only one who had already been there... and I wasn't planning the get together-- a happy coincidence that the event landed at Chalkboard.)   Our server was very patient as we took our time, gathering and greeting one another-- 15+ people is a big group for any restaurant-- and I would have been annoyed if I were serving us.  But when we finally sat down, all waters were immediately poured, the wine order  was taken, and flaky yummy warm biscuits were served to each of us.  It's that great combination of home cooked goodness mixed with upscale professionalism that keeps me coming back to this place.   Anyway, our server explained the items and how they were prepared, as we became curious and asked about them, which is so much nicer than rattling off the ""specials"" right off the bat, which always make me feel pressured, as if I will be taking a test after the first course.   Again, in this way, there is a lovely sense of relaxed pace, mixed with total confidence in the service.   I had the skate-- it was great.  Never had skate before. Escargo was fun and just seasoned enough to really taste the little guys.  Lots of people got the Hangar steak... one ordered the cod, and another, the salmon.  We were all ""yumming"" and occasionally sharing bites back and forth.  Oh, others also got the to-die-for mac'n cheese and scallops... wonderful flavors.   And house salads and beet/watermelon salads got a lot of good comments, too. (You know how groups can be... taking pics of food, commenting and sharing bites.) No desserts for us, that night.  But I normally indulge because the creations are just unique enough;  it's worth it. This place is always a good choice for excellent service, and fantastic food at what is a really good price, considering the attention that goes into each dish.... and I have been there when we had to call ahead to get reservations.... only the 5:30 or 8- something was available, and also when I can't believe we are one of 5 tables only.      To the review that suggested the chicken and mashed potatoes weren't salted enough... and gave very few stars, I say, ""Please pick up the shaker, and increase your own sodium levels at your discretion.  If you are used to a high level of salt on your food, your palate is indeed more fit for Kentucky Fried Chicken, as you mentioned in your pithy review.""

I sampled the trout, however, and found it to be pretty tasty, for trout, that is ;-).

Really charming interior - loved the décor, lighting and layout, including the menu on the huge chalkboard. It all comes together to make for an intimate and warm dining experience. Unlike some reviews posted here, we experienced excellent service all around. From the hostess, the bus boys to our waiter, everyone was extremely helpful and friendly.  To start things off we ordered the crab croquettes and they were excellent - crispy and savory, served with a Dijon and parsley aioli. Also absolutely LOVED the home made biscuit that was still fresh and hot off the oven. So far, things tasted great and I was highly anticipating my entrée. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken which is their specialty. It was a HUGE portion, so much so that I only managed to eat about a third of it. It was very crunchy which I liked, but a bit too salty for my taste and nothing special. The chicken was served over mashed potatoes, white sausage gravy and some tasty collard greens.  I would have much rather preferred to have a piece of Popeye's chicken on my plate instead... especially for $25. The entrée made me wish I had just ordered like 2-3 orders of the croquettes we had as appetizers. After a disappointing entrée, we looked at dessert for redemption. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Egg Roll and the disappointment continued. It was a bit stale and the best part of it was the chocolate ice cream. My husband ordered the flourless chocolate cake with strawberry puree and was underwhelmed as well, especially since our server told us it came with vanilla ice cream but it was served without.

2013-01-19,1.0,"It's so validating to read all the other reviews about terrible service at this place, for that's exactly what we experienced last night.  First, when we walked in and were told we had a couple options for tables--and chose the one ""by the window"" (across the restaurant)--the ""host"" (who was also our server) didn't take us there, didn't tell us to ""please, go ahead and seat yourselves.""  Nothing.  We just kind of shrugged and looked for the table he was talking about.  Once we're at the table, he comes and tells us that the menu on the table is the wine menu, but tells us nothing about the restaurant: for people who're not connoisseurs of the Chalkboard, we had no idea we're just supposed to go on the 1-word menu items listed on the wall.  (And even so, shouldn't a place that pretentiously offers no menus find it their 1st priority to explain to diners what the hell they're about to order?!?  I'm sorry, but ""Hanger Steak"" is not enough explanation for me to want to order it--especially at those prices.  So I asked if the deal is that we must ASK our server to explain dishes, and I said there were three we would like to know more about.  He told me he'd go get our wine (one glass), and tell us once he was back.  So we wait.  And wait.  The wine comes--a Riesling that my boyfriend ordered at the suggestion of our server when asked for something white on the dry end.  It was SUPER sweet (and I like sweet wines, so it's not me being picky). Wine comes, we order:  Duck Cassoulet for my boyfriend, Hanger Steak for me--medium.  Food comes fairly quickly.  The Duck Cassoulet is not infused with the duck meat flavor at all: it's like they took a can of beans, poured it in a cast-iron pot to make it look nice, and spread a few pieces of duck on top.  My boyfriend said it was like having ordered two dishes that didn't even go together.  I look at my plate: my steak is mostly red, between medium-rare and rare.  I would have asked them to just throw it in the pan another minute--if the server had come back to ask how our food was.  We were 3/4 of the way through our meal before he came back!  I told him that I'm not usually ""that customer,"" but my beef was quite undercooked, and the wine he'd served my boyfriend was clearly a sweet wine, not a dry wine.  He proceeded to tell me that ""some restaurants would call that medium,"" asserting that he had worked at steakhouses before (and I responded that I have too--and a cool, red center is NOT medium!).  He asked in a very bitchy tone if I wanted him to have them cook it more (the last 3 bites I had), and I said no, that it was good, that I just wanted to let him know--now that he came to check on us--that there were issues such as undercooked meat, and receiving a ""dry"" wine that's clearly very sweet.  He even argued with me about that, as if my own taste buds were wrong!  After this, he didn't come back to our table for a long time.  He'd serve the tables around ours, but avoid us.  My boyfriend was sitting there with credit card in hand, and only got the check when he managed to make the ""check"" sign to our server across the room.  We weren't thanked for our business; we weren't addressed at all. This server--a slight, bearded young man--was probably one of the rudest I've ever encountered.  I feel I can be harsh because I'm a very easy customer, and I've had years of server experience myself, so I'm very patient and understanding.  This guy was just a total arrogant ass, and if this place closes because of terrible service like this, then good riddance!",0.9677,0.812,0.108,0.08,0.5032692307692308

Many times when the mrs. and I go out to eat she laments that I end up picking the better tasting dish.  I can't help it, I'm brilliant and awesome like that.  It's all part of my charm.  On this night though, she was the clear winner.  I had a hanger steak with potato, bacon, and brussel sprouts.  Very tasty, and one of the few times I have actually liked eating brussel sprouts.  But that risotto was awesome.  Creamy and rich yet sweet and a little sharp with the apple cider gastrique.  An absolute highlight.

Per the invitation, we were given the choice of either beef, duck, or gnocchi.  The entire table chose steak (YEEHAW!) with the exception of one (gnocchi.) The steak was perfection.  I cut this meat with my damn fork.  And the portion was so generous that I finally got lazy and actually cut my steak.  With a butter knife. Yes, it was that tender. The whole table raved.  It definitely wasn't wedding food.  It also came with some yummy potatoes and what I believe to be a carrot or yam puree.  I had a few glasses of wine.  Sue me.  It was a delicious orange puree. The food, the wine, the ambiance.  It was perfect. And at the end of the night, when the owner of the joint came out and emotionally thanked us all for patronizing his joint.. well.. I decided a bad ass Yelp review was in order. LOVED IT!  Based on past reviews, I'd suggest doing amazing dinner service and leaving it at that.  You do it well.  Don't muddy a good thing with trendy BS.",0.9943,0.747,0.195,0.058,0.6809523809523809

2012-07-27,1.0,"Having been to Chalkboard on numerous occasions, my friends and I decided to gather and indulge in the fried chicken and bottomless bubbles night.  We were seated immediately and given water upon sitting down. The menu was explained, but we knew what we came in for. We all ordered the fried chicken and champagne and added a mac n cheese to share. We were poured our first flute of champagne and within two minutes of ordering, our food arrived. I was disappointed as it was obviously just microwaved and not made to order. It wasn't hot, just lukewarm, and the chicken was a bit dry. They also have changed their recipe from one of down home fried chicken goodness to BW3 buffalo sauce infused fried chicken. There was no getting away from that sauce. Though not readily apparent, it was obvious I should have also asked for some celery, carrot sticks and blue cheese for dipping. The collard greens and potatoes were nice along with the mac n cheese though. During dinner our flutes were each refilled though they were not empty. Our waiter came immediately and asked if we wanted dessert. I asked if we could have a moment to digest. He said that is fine and to enjoy our champagne. We decided about 10 minutes later to order the cookie dough egg roll to share. Our flutes were filled again. We ate dessert slowly as we were chatting and catching up. When we were finished, one of my friends still had about 3/4 of a glass of champagne while the rest of us had none. I asked the waiter as he cleared the dessert plate for a smidgeon more while we waited for the check and chatted some more. He nodded and never returned. When I asked the bus boy while he was in the midst of clearing those empty glasses, he looked at us and said, ""No, I think you've had enough."" (Rewind...we were there for an hour and each had maybe 3 glasses of champagne. What he was implying was as if we were some sort of drunken floozies ready to cause problems.) We were all shocked and made to feel very uncomfortable. We wanted out fast, but we did speak to the waiter before leaving. We asked about their bottomless champagne and he rudely responded that ""it's not really bottomless otherwise people like you would stay all night and drink all the champagne. Sorry I didn't put that in an asterisk."" (HUH???)  I can't begin to express how angry and disappointed I was at this North Center restaurant. I've lived in this neighborhood for over 10 years now and love to support the community. Myself and my friends had been there countless times, but this blemish cannot be removed. Our problem was initially about not getting another glass of champagne; however, it became about how we were spoken to and treated. Shame on you Chalkboard. You have lost many, many loyal customers. I will never support you again.  In a nutshell: Food: mediocre and overpriced. If you want awesome food in North Center that isn't pub food, go to Brown Trout (just north on Lincoln past the CVS). Not only is their food superior, their staff and chef are accommodating, playful and kind and there is live music on Thursdays (no corkage fee night) and Sundays (fried chicken night).  Service: Condescending, arrogant, judgmental, rude. The following day I had to call Chalkboard as my boyfriend left his hat there. I spoke with Greg who was lovely. He found the hat hidden away and had it waiting for me that afternoon. I do hope he finds a different restaurant to work in as I don't want him to receive a poor reputation for his colleagues' poor behavior.  HEY! HERE'S AN ASTERISK FOR YA!!! ***During our meal, a delivery man walked through the dining area with a freshly slaughtered, bloody goat wrapped in see-through plastic. The goat looked at me and stuck his blue tongue out as he was carried by. I have a strong stomach, but one of my friends nearly vomited on the table and couldn't eat anything else the rest of the night. Here's my thoughts: #1 How can you tout yourself on your website as an ""elegant dining experience"" and carry bloody animals through the dining area when there is a back door that's closer to the kitchen? #2 I wonder what the Health Department would think about ill behavior such as this?

2012-07-12,2.0,"My friends and I heard about Chalkboard's Wednesday night Chicken and Champagne special and just HAD to try it out. We like to go out of our neighborhoods and try new places occasionally so this seemed like a perfect fit. We made reservations a week in advance and all made sure to show up on time for the experience.  Sadly, it didn't quite live up to expectations. I gave 2 stars because the food was amazing - so don't think to not go there based on food - really great stuff. The chicken was cooked to perfection with an amazing peppery fried crust and the mashed potatoes underneath were very creamy and rich. My complaint lies with the service. Turns out this Wednesday deal isn't as popular as you may think and we were the only table in there after about 830p. They advertise that they close at 10, but around 9pm the staff started breaking down tables and putting dishes away right in front of us as we were eating (pretty shortly after we started eating I may add). It made us all feel very uncomfortable, like we were in the way of the staff going home early like they usually do.  Although the deal is bottomless champagne with the chicken, we noted that when we'd finish our glasses, our waiter was nowhere to be found, hiding back in the kitchen. All in all we each had a total of about 2-2.5 glasses, which is hardly the ""bottomless"" deal as advertised.  At the end, the server graciously included a 20% tip for himself on the bill. We felt so uncomfortable being there alone with the broken down tables that we just paid and ran out without complaint.  So all in all - yes, the food here is great. I love the concept of comfort food and fresh ingredients with an ever-changing menu. The staff here should learn, however, that even though there is only one table left, they should still treat them as if they are in a full restaurant and not start packing up to go before they even take a bite.",0.9891,0.768,0.165,0.067,0.6061255411255412
2012-06-24,5.0,"Chalkboard is perfection. I've been for brunch, and it was absolutely stellar. A cask iron skillet of biscuits and gravy? Pitchers of St. Germain cocktails? Chicken and waffles with smoked gouda sauce and vanilla infused syrup? Yes, yes, and YES! Not to mention, there is no wait, attentive service, and their wallpaper is really pretty. Tonight, I went in for dinner. There is only a bottled wine and beer menu. Everything else is written on the...chalkboard! Ask your server questions about how the items are prepared, and make your choice (or, completely trust him when he makes a suggestion to you). Then order a glass of wine, sit back and enjoy your meal. It's going to be pretty damn delicious.  Tonight I sampled: * A shrimp and scallop appetizer with orange wedges and cucumbers - refreshing and delicious * A pork rib appetizer where I was served 2 little half slabs of pork ribs. for $11. Meat falling off the bone, ultra tender, flavorful. At first when I saw it, I almost (ALMOST) wanted to cancel my entree, but hunkered down and ate all of it. It wasn't difficult at all. When you're served awesome food, you find the real estate in your stomach. MAKE IT WORK. * Fried chicken + greens + mashed potatoes with sausage gravy. Do I need to say anymore? Chalkboard is famous for this, and rightly so.  * Pork chops with a quinoa, bacon, corn, hash and a hoisin sauce glaze. That hash was BANANAS. (Good call on the server who recommended this to us. You are a superstar!) * Macaroni and cheese made with smoked gouda. The serving is HUGE. It comes out in a boat shaped bowl. I have a pound of it hanging out in the fridge. My lunch tomorrow? Awesome. Oh, there's fried chicken too.  * Berries with a coconut cream and topped with a watermelon shave ice. Really, I was too full for dessert, so we opted for the lightest sounding option. I am happy we did, as this was a perfect sweet way to round out the meal, though the blueberry bread pudding with pop rocks (!!) sounded fun.

The ambience is very nice: spacious, warm, not too fancy, and the chalkboard menu on the south wall is a nice touch- it's simple and easy to follow.

I should have trusted my instinct, as Chalkboard was indeed a complete average experience. When we entered the restaurant on a Friday evening, I was struck by how few tables were taken, and the fact that there was a man wearing basketball shorts and a baseball cap on the other side of the room. Not off to a good start. My boyfrined made a comment about how ""pretty"" the room was, but green paint on the walls and a chalkboard do not qualify as ambiance in my book. At one point, I said I wasn't sure what Chalkboard stood for - what was its claim to fame? My boyfriend responded, ""The chalkboard, of course."" Hmm. I don't think a restaurant should stake its claim on a piece of black slate. It needs to have a bit more going for it, in my opinion, especially when it seems, based on what other Yelpers are saying, the menu options listed on that chalkboard never seem to change. Between the four of us, we split three appetizers, including the scallops, crab cakes and foie gras. The portions were manageable and the food was very pleasant. Of the three, the scallops were certainly the winner - they were properly cooked and had a nice flavor. I had the skate for my main, which was also cooked well, and accompanied by fluffy potatoes.

However, I did not realize that the menu was prix fixe and prix fixe only ($55 per person for four courses). So, this review is based on the Valentine's Day menu/my experience alone. I had heard great things about Chalkboard's mac & cheese (Gouda is so good-a!) so I absolutely would come back for brunch or dinner. As I said,  I saw the prix fixe menu on V-Day eve and I got really nervous. My husband however likes/will eat pretty much anything so I did not cancel the reservation and decided to be adventurous. Or something. The first course was either lobster bisque or a mushroom salad. I don't eat seafood or mushrooms so I got the salad (those suckers were big enough to fling off onto Mike's plate) and Mike had the bisque (his favorite dish of the meal). The non-mushroom salad components were great - fresh goat cheese and well-cooked (non-soggy) green beans. Overall, a hit. The second course was more of a miss. Mike had the scallops and he did not dig them at all. Again, a seafood hater (BAD New Englander!) I went with the eggplant risotto and it was good. . . at the EDGES only. The middle had a plop of ""aioli"" (I mean it's mayo, really) in the middle and not only was it nasty, it was smothering my favorite green (arugula). Dang. It had promise but again, a miss. Third we had a choice of pork belly or a vegetable pot pie. After risotto, I needed protein so we both went the belly route. Braised with foie gras. Wow, I learned I do NOT like pork belly - which is weird because I love pork in general. The consistency was just so unappetizing and there was too much over-powering goose liver. Mike agreed; we were not fans. Embarrassed, we wrapped this up and took it home. Actually it is still in our fridge (NOTE to throw that out). For dessert we shared a chocolate bread pudding with chocolate ice cream and some more (yes chocolate) lava. It was incredible. And bread pudding may just be my very favorite dessert so I was really pleased.  Our server was great - attentive, sweet and she offered suggestions for drinks (these thankfully were not dictated by the prix fixe). Since I was not eating so much, why not imbibe? I had a class of Cabernet, and one (OK maybe two, it was V-day) glasses of champagne (one with some Chambord).  That night, we decided that next year on Valentine's Day we will go back to one of those heart shaped pizzas and champers. I mean, we tried but overall the experience was not outstanding.

2011-12-13,1.0,"This review is for the afternoon tea service only.  Ladies , don't do it.  I know it's the only place in Lincoln Square that serves a formal afternoon tea, but you are cheating yourselves if you resort to this.  Spring for the extra $$ and do it right at one of the downtown venues, or just do lunch or brunch if you're staying in the 'hood.  But this travesty, no.  Just no. Chalkboard, shame on you!  You are cheating your patrons of a truly pleasant afternoon treat.  If they have never done an afternoon tea before, they will be unlikely to try it again anywhere else after this experience.  And if they have, they will be sincerely pissed at what you are trying to pass off here. Afternoon tea is all about the luxurious experience.  It's pricey, and you don't get a lot of food (it's not meant to be a meal, it's more of a fortifying snack), so what you do get should be fresh, well prepared, and pretty.  Three-tiered 'plates' are standard - savory tea sandwiches (Chalkboard, please note the plural here),  a scone and/or crumpet with clotted cream and lemon curd or other luscious spread,  and tea cakes (small, delicious pastries).  With these tasty snacks, you sip a lovely pot of tea, usually served with accompaniments of lemon, sugar and cream,  and talk high-toned trash about all your absent friends (or D-List celebs, if all your friends happen to be there with you).  And if you're a lush like me, you add a glass or two of sparkling wine, or champagne, if your budget runs to it.  All this takes place in a cozy environment, with fancy table linens and pretty china and attentive servers. That's what it SHOULD be.  At Chalkboard, you get one (count it - one) tea sandwich that consists of two small, thick slices of toasted bread, glued together by about a millimeter of filling, so pretty much you just get two slices of toast.  You also get a skewer upon which has been speared two more large chunks of toast (why???) with a tiny cheese cube and a tiny fruit cube between them. And finally, damn it, there's that chunky toast again, this time with a half-teaspoon of white bean puree.    So your savory 'treats' are pretty much toast.   Then, you get a full-sized scone (which, credit where credit is due, was lovely - light and fluffy), but no decadent cream or curds.  Nope.  A teaspoon of butter with large chunks of pear in it  for some reason, and a teaspoon of fig jam.  Huh.  So basically another bread course.  And finally, for your sweets, you get ... no, no, don't worry.  No toast.  But for some reason, you do get another scone (mini this time).  And a couple of other hardish pastry crusts with chocolate paste mashed into them or onto them.  Oh, there was a strawberry.  The strawberry was nice. Now the tea itself was very good, and the server was happy to bring more hot water when the pot was empty.  But we had to reach across to an empty table to get saucers to put our tea holders in to keep the tea from stewing in the pot.  We saw others doing the same. Ladies, if you've never done the afternoon tea ritual thing, I highly recommend treating yourselves.  Do go to one of the downtown venues; there are also a few other places scattered around town that do a nice job.    But don't. come. here.

2011-11-21,2.0,"I just came back from dining at this place.  I have been a few times in the past, but havent been back for about 2 years.  We had a coupon for $25 off the bill which helped. The food tends to be kind of pricey.  We ordered the fried chicken which is good, but $25 seems rather a steep price to pay. They also give you a ton of potatoes.  They could easily cut that portion and charge a little less and it would feel like a better deal. The service, however, was our biggest complaint.  The way the restaurant works is the items for the day are written on a chalkboard.  However, the chalkboard is difficult to see from about half the seats in the restaurant.  In additon, the chalkboard lists the item itself, but not any information about the preparation.  So for example, the chalkboard says ""salmon"" but nothing about how it is prepared. In the past when I have gone, the waitstaff have reviewed all the items on the menu and the various preparations.  Apparently when you have a coupon the waitstaff receives a 20% tip regardless.  We virtually had to beg our waiter to review how various items were prepared.  This waiter would only review what we asked about specifically.  Given that I could only view the chalkboard through a mirror and had to read the items backwards it was somewhat challenging to know everything on the menu. Since there were only 3 other tables occupied it was hard to understand his reticence to simply review the items.  (Isn't that his job?) For example had I know the boullibaise had an asian preparation I might have ordered it, but from my vantage point I couldn't see that option and had I seen it, I probably would have assumed it was prepared traditionally and not asked about it.  Given the higher prices and the indifferent service, I dont see myself returning.  Particularly since there are other good restaurants charging lower prices with waitstaff that are far more helpful and attentive.",0.9398,0.865,0.087,0.048,0.5264355742296919

Starters:  Chalkboard Salad - a bit tangy, but good and definitely big enough to share with someone. Mains:  Crispy, tender, delicious fried chicken.  So much flavor.  It was ""eat it cold the next morning"" good.  I think everyone else I was with ordered something, but I was too locked in to my meal to really notice.  I vaguely remember some short ribs that made their way to my plate being tasty. Sides:  Gouda Mac'n'Cheese.  Was it gouda?  Sure, but overrated.  Too greasy for my taste and the consistency was a little soft.  I'm thinking bacon bits. Ambience:  Small space, but appointed well, and their use of mirrors makes it feel bigger than it is.  My biggest gripe is the whole ""chalkboard"" theme.  Ok, I get it, the name of your restaurant is Chalkboard so you want to put the whole menu on a chalkboard.  However, you're not chartering a new restaurant innovation here - I've been to LOTS of places where they put the menu on a chalkboard, but you know what they still do?  Give you menus.  And I'm guessing they do this so customers (like us) who sit right against the chalkboard don't have to crane their necks or ask people across the room to read them the entree selections.  Am I being too harsh here??  I just want a menu to hold and look at!! Service:  He was OK, but a bit inattentive given the number of empty tables on a Saturday night.  I thought that was odd, too.  How can a place this good only be half full on a Saturday night?  Perhaps those customers DIDN'T have the fried chicken on their first visit.

In fact when the waiter described the menu selections almost every single item had truffle oil on it. It's not a given that truffle oil will just make any item gourmet, the soup did not pair well with it. Onto the scallops, poor again. They were doused in some kind of sauce that was mayo based, very heavy and creamy. It completely over powered the scallops, again the heavy, tart sauce was odd with the scallops. Next was the Wahoo...this was a disaster. Completely ruined a nice expensive piece of fish by overcooking it then dumping on some very acidic and heavy sauce. The preparation was Mediterranean but the veggie, caper, and brussel sprout mix was sour, tart and really paired poorly with the fish.

2011-01-24,3.0,"My good friend and I came here on Saturday for the afternoon tea service.  We did high tea at the Peninsula back in May, and wanted to go with a more affordable option this time around.  Afternoon tea at the Chalkboard is $19 per person, and includes a pot of tea and an assortment of snacks. Tea service is from 2-4 p.m., and we were the only party in the restaurant for most of the time.  Another party of 2 came in for about an hour, but besides that, it was just my friend and me. I ordered the Apple Cider Rooibos tea, which was REALLY good.  I wish I could have that tea all the time!  The assortment of sandwiches, scones and treats was good, and I felt it was a good amount of food for tea. The reason why my review is 3 stars instead of 5 is because of our server.  He was pleasant throughout our meal, but around 3:30 he set our check down on our table.  We were still working on our tea and sparkling wine, so we continued chatting.  A few minutes later, he came over to us and told us we needed to close out our tab, since they needed to set up for dinner and he needed a break. Considering we were the only people in the restaurant, I thought that was pretty rude.  We still had time left in the tea service and there was no reason to kick us out.  We spent close to $100 in the restaurant - he shouldn't have acted like our presence was an inconvenience to him.   It's a shame, because the restaurant is really cute and the tea service is good.  I would like to come back, but don't want to have another bad service experience.",0.9754,0.779,0.145,0.076,0.5119191919191919
2011-01-07,4.0,"Chalkboard had popped up on my list of contenders for New Year's Eve.  It didn't make the final round for that, but I did decide to visit it this week. We stopped in with no reservation.  They were full, but put us down with a warning it would be a bit of a wait.  It's not a big dining room, so it's understandable.  We were in the back waiting area, and while we waited, they brought us two glasses *each* of a capable (and real French - Piper-Heidsieck Brut) champagne.  I don't know what they charge for it, but it would have been about $10/glass downtown, so that was a nice comp - even before we'd been seated.  They also checked back to let us know how the availability was going.  It was a long wait, but it was my fault for not making a reservation on a Friday night and they handled it well.   Service the entire night was very good.  Attentive, not overbearing, and enhanced the evening. Finally, it came time to be seated.  I like the big chalkboard with the menu items, but I have to agree that I do wish they had real paper menus to supplement the chalkboard.  That said, we knew the game going in and so had paid attention to the chalkboard and knew what we wanted as soon as the waiter had finished describing the menu. We had the tomato bisque, which came with some bleu grilled cheese sandwiches, their scallops which came with some candied olives (better than it sounds), the country fried chicken, and the pork loin. The tomato ""bisque"" wasn't really much of a bisque, and had the flavor of a nice marinara sauce.  Which isn't necessarily bad - it was a nice, tomato-y tomato soup.  And the bleu cheese sandwich bites were actually REALLY well-paired with it.    With the truffle oil drizzled on the soup, it was a really likable dish, even though it wasn't at all conventional. The scallops were more notable for the things on the plate accompanying the scallops.  It is hard to get perfectly cooked scallops.  I've probably had fine-dining scallops a hundred times or more in my life, and only 2-3 times have they been cooked perfectly.  These were not cooked perfectly, although the were cooked capably.  The nuts and candied olives and light sauce with the scallops were all very good, though. The country-fried chicken had a lot of potential, and it had some good things going for it.  It was fried perfectly.  The chicken itself was moist enough.  It had a nice crunch without being hard.  But there were some definite things to be improved.  First off, it was billed as coming with sausage gravy, but there was very little gravy - I didn't taste any.  Which leads into the fact that the mashed potatoes were too dry to go with a fried chicken dish.  They needed more cream or buttermilk or gravy.  Additionally, the breading on the chicken should have had pepper or herbs or something to diversify the flavor a little.  If they were in there, I couldn't taste them.  The collard greens that came with it were quite good, though.  Finally, the whole dish could have used a bit more seasoning.  Either that or they should put salt shakers on the tables so diners can add seasoning as they see fit.  I know that's controversial among chefs, but seasoning is a personal preference, so no chef will manage seasoning that fits everyone's taste. Finally, the pork loin.  It came in a sauce that was a sort of puttanesca.  I'm not a big fan of puttanesca, and especially not with pork loin.  It didn't help that the pork seemed to be under-seasoned.  that said, the pork was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was also well-executed except for the seasoning. Overall, I was very impressed with Chalkboard, which is why I'm giving them four stars.  They weren't quite perfect, but the chefs clearly know what they're doing and most of my complaints could be discounted as just personal taste or preference.  There were no mistakes that I would attribute to a lack of skill or effort.   If Chalkboard had a proper bar/lounge area or if they weren't 45 minutes from my place, I'd probably be a regular.  I liked it a lot and happily recommend them to anyone.  I'm not quite ready to give them five stars, but I'd give them 4 1/2 stars if I could.",0.9978,0.794,0.147,0.059,0.6029761940800902

2010-12-05,5.0,"I can't believe this place doesn't have a 5 star rating.  It's unjust! My boyfriend and I came to Chalkboard to celebrate our anniversary last night and everything was absolutely phenomenal, from the first sip of wine all the way to getting our coats at the end of the evening.  I could go on and on and on because everything was wonderful, but I'll make this simple and just list the MOST amazing parts of our experience: 1. The Scallops. Can I just write ""The Scallops"" 47 more times? Because they were killer.  The scallops themselves were cooked flawlessly, and the accompanying olives were hands down the best I've ever eaten.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that we could eat nothing but this dish for the rest of our lives and be totally content.  2. The Service: Our waiter, Craig, was exactly what you hope your server will be at a place like this.  He was funny, totally non-invasive, and his recommendations were dead on.  In fact, everyone we interacted with throughout the night was really great.  And, contrary to what seems to be the popular view, I thought the Chalkboard concept was so sweet.  Because the chalkboard doesn't go into detail about the dishes, it gives you a chance to engage with your server and ask questions and get recommendations.  When you have a waitstaff as pleasant as Chalkboard seems to, it's a perfect way to start your experience.   3. The Sherry:  What IS this amazing vanilla infused sherry?? I have no idea what it's called because it was a recommendation from Craig, but holy mother of god was it delicious.  It was rich and warm and tasted like figs or something. I could not have asked for a better way to end such a delicious meal. Ok, so my final words on Chalkboard: GO TO IT. GO RIGHT NOW.  Yes, surprise though it may be, the menu is written on a chalkboard.  Don't freak out; your server will come and explain the whole thing to you, I promise.  By the end of the meal you'll be full, happy, and probably wondering ""Could I maybe just sneak into the kitchen and somehow get all of those olives into my purse without anyone noticing...?""",0.9987,0.704,0.26,0.037,0.6587768440709617

True scones are not suppose to be the size of door stoppers (as sold at the Great Harvest).  Chalkboard's scones were buttery and flaky on the outside, yet firm enough on the inside for jam and cream and dotted with currents.  My friend and I loved them so much, we asked if we could buy some scones to go!  They were kind enough to accommodate us and baked up a fresh batch!    I've had afternoon tea all over the world, including at the Dorchester and Harrods in London.  Some of these other places definitely served larger portions, some not..  Chalkboard's was one of the most delicious afternoon tea experiences I've had and at $19 + decent street parking, it's a bargain!  Both the Pen and the Intercontinental charge over $30 for tea, on top of another $25 for parking.  So, keep it in perspective and give it a try.  You won't be sorry....",0.9976,0.787,0.213,0.0,0.5976562500000001
2010-10-14,3.0,"I must pretense this to say that we did make reservations, but we got there 30-45 min late due to traffic miscalculations. We did, however, call several times to relay this to the staff. They at no time denied us our reservation, so kudos on this. This place has retro chic vibe to it that I loved when I walked in. The menu is on the ""chalkboard"" on the wall...thus the name, yah, yah, yah? Likewise if you eat outside...it's on the side of the building. That was a cool thing, but a not so cool thing if you sit in the area of the restaurant where you have to get up to view the darned menu. Which, of course, is where we sat....near the window, in the corner. The waiter was in the beginning, super nice and friendly, and he described the menu for us so we could make our choices. Hubbie got the southern fried chicken, I got the pork belly that was done vindaloo style. For our side, we got the mac and cheese. Mind you, on the chalkboard, it says, southern fried chicken, pork belly and mac n cheese. NO DESCRIPTIONS, so ask away when you see your waiter. Or, check online to see the menu so you know what comes with your dish. Or, you can be like us and wonder if we can swipe the printed menu off the window sill so we can read off of it. That means they have a paper version, no? And here is where the meal went downhill and uphill...i mean, some things went really bad and some things went really well. The food came out quick, which was great, but the server literally plopped and slid the plates on the table and ran away. I think I have seen servers serve better at IHOP, what's the hurry? Is there a fire in the kitchen? The food was pretty good, and that is where the three stars is awarded. The pork belly came out really hot and was seasoned lightly with Indian spices, I personally would like it stronger, but I understand that for that you go to an Indian place for it.  The pork melted in your mouth and it was cooled off by the slaw that came with it. The southern fried chicken was a very large piece of fried chicken on a bed of collard greens and mashed potatoes topped with a white gravy. The greens and ta'toes were standard, very good. However, the chicken was extremely thick and hard to eat. Because it was so thick, part of the sides were over cooked and the middle was the only juicy part. Also, the gravy was a nice touch, but for those that like the crispy on your fried chicken, ask for the gravy on the side. The gravy ruined the crispy part. (I know, southern, gravy...but I am just saying..). Also, it ended up a bit bland and we had to ask for hot sauce. The waiter said it was some special hot sauce from Louisana, but we didn't find anything totally amazing about it. (Can't we find that stuff next to ketchup at some places?)  Best part of the meal was the mac n cheese, made with smoked gouda. The smoked really came out in the cheese and it was very addictive. Great mac n cheese, but follow your gut feeling and eat it all NOW, the reheats don't taste as good.  From the good food..to the bad experience...we finished eating and then...and then...and then...we were ignored. Here's a chronological:  ten minutes after eating for somebody came to clear plates, five minutes and then somebody came to take our pack up food, three min for them to drop it off, and then complete silence for about another 17-18 min. *sigh* Where oh where was our waiter?  Our waiter took the dessert order of another table AND served it  AND profusely talked to another table AND disappeared for another five min after that before coming to take our dessert order. The only reason I even timed it was because we were waiting after we ate and nobody was around and I caught the attention of some of the waiters in the back, who pointed out that we were staring helplessly into the back for service. When nobody came, that is when I started to time it. We ordered our dessert, the cookie dough eggrolls, and after eight minutes I almost just stood up to ask for the check when the server tah-dah'ed himself into the seating area with our dessert on hand. The dessert was ok..but the skin on the eggroll was too chewy and honestly that is all I remember because I was so upset.  Food was good, but just not worth the lack of service. If you take that much pride in your food to make it tasty, take some time to figure out how to present yourself better as a restaurant., or just make it take out so I can enjoy your mac n cheese without your staff...or lack thereof.",0.9986,0.796,0.152,0.053,0.5217559523809525

2010-08-27,3.0,"Let's just get the bad out of the way right out.  Not a big fan of the chalkboard concept, I am.  As the name indicates, the menu is written on a chalkboard on the wall, and no hand menus are distributed.  The staff spends too much time describing the menu, not only to you, but to all the diners around you.  Which means that the waiter must hover while indecisive parties muddle through their dinner orders.  It torpedoes an otherwise elegant atmosphere. But that was the only drawback in an otherwise spectacular dinner. Kelly and I started with the scallops appetizer and the beets and goat cheese salad.  The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the vanilla cream and candied olives provided unique supporting flavors, while the beets and goat cheese were perfectly suited tart and sweet flavor profiles. We then tackled the seared duck breast and the the fried chicken.  I have to say I have mixed feelings about the fried chicken.  On one hand, the breading was heavenly light with a tangy spicy flavoring, while the breast meat was juicy and perfectly tender.  On the other hand, the dish consisted of simply a breast and attached wing, plus garnishes, for $25.  A bit pricey, but delicious in execution. The duck, on the other hand, well, praise Jesus.  Its probably the best duck I've devoured in Chicago, and I've eaten quite a bit of duck.  It was advertised by my server as cooked medium rare, but it was (appropriately) much closer to rare, and sliced so thin that each slice of duck breast simply melted in my mouth.  It was slice after slice of smokey goodness.  Yet, at the same time, the skin of the breast was crunchy and juicy, just like it is when seared at Chateau Brunique.  It was a perfect execution of a most savory dish. The portions were perfectly sized, so that I cleared my duck and enjoyed several bites of Kelly's fried chicken - I could eat that fried skin all afternoon long.  I'd certainly be up to returning for their fried chicken and champagne special. For dessert, we split the cookie dough fried egg roll.  The description sounded divine, but for whatever reason we expected a vanilla cookie dough (a la chocolate chip cookies), but it ended up being chocolate cookie dough (a la crinkles).  While that certainly isn't a Shakespearean tragedy, it was a very heavy filling, and combined with a very heavy egg roll crust, made for a far too dense dessert experience.  If you are expecting profiteroles nouveau, as Kelly and I were, you may be disappointed.   Consider it more like stomach lining before a trip across the Iditerod, than a relaxing postscript to an excellent dinner.  In any event, its worth checking out.  Cocktails are exceedingly affordable (for my noble bourbon boozers, they have Buffalo Trace, Bulliet and Woodford), and the wine list pairs well with the menu.  We will definitely be back to explore the pork tenderloin and whatever other seasonal dishes they concoct.",0.9993,0.736,0.244,0.02,0.6359010270774976

2010-07-11,2.0,"I'm not a southern guy.  I've visited friends at Ole Miss once, and that was enough for me.  The heat, drawls, and languid pacing are fine (maybe even pleasant) in small doses, but wear thin beyond that.  Perhaps that explains our service last night at Chalkboard. We've lived in the neighborhood for a couple years, and have tried most of the local places, but for whatever reason hadn't made it down here until now.  We had high hopes from looking over the menu online, with it's mix of American with southern highlights, but the execution at the restaurant leaves something to be desired:  if you name your place after the giant chalkboard inside (which holds the entire menu) you might want to make sure your servers can fill in the gaps when asked.  Otherwise, during the unfortunate routine of having to give the full description of every dish to every table, preparations or ingredients tend to be forgotten.  Only after hearing two other servers other than our own go through the spiel did we finally feel we heard what each plate was (it wouldn't be too far-fetched to think it was our server's first day, from the extended ""ummms"" as she desperately tried to remember details).  Kind of like the dining equivalent of Rashomon.   Additionally, after asking about the halibut cheeks appetizer we were told they were no longer available, yet they failed to update the chalkboard with the new offering.  The fully-erasable, easily-updatable chalkboard.  This was forgivable enough as neither my gf or I have are that picky about ingredients, but combine this with service that was unobtrusive to a fault (it's quite a feat to make diners feel forgotten when you're less than half full), and things aren't looking too promising.  The food was a bright spot, however.  We started by sampling the watermelon salad with pickled rind, a dusting of cilantro and mint, and fried ginger bits.  Very tasty, but the kitchen didn't need to do much beyond combine the items,  We also tried their gouda mac n' cheese, which was definitely enough to serve as an entree, and full of smoky, cheesy, goodness.  For entrees, we had their signature fried chicken plate, and the blackened catfish, served with crawfish tails and ""greens from the chef's garden"".  Both dishes were excellent, save two notes: charging $25 for a largish breast of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and some collard greens is fairly ballsy, but we ordered it anyway (and it was delicious, with great, crispy-yet-light breading), so shame on us.  And as for the catfish ""blackened"" is patently misleading: it was mostly flour-dusted, and appeared to be nothing more than gently sauteed.  I'm not even sure they used any blackening spices at all, so they might want to stick to ""cajun"" as a descriptor.  It was, nevertheless, very tasty, and the greens may have been the best part of the plate.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate-chip eggrolls, which although good and rich, frankly would be pretty tough to screw-up.  I also would have liked to have seen a couple more southerny desserts, as all options were fairly generic. A final note: we were seated at the banquette between two couples (Did I mention it was not even 1/2 full?) right where two pieces of cushioning joined and the upholstery looked badly in need of a deep cleaning.  Overall, I suppose I'm being a bit harsh with the rating, but the schism between what this place could be (something along the lines of a Lincoln Square variation of Big Jones) and what it is in reality is a shame.",0.9788,0.802,0.117,0.081,0.570476513536215

2010-07-02,4.0,"Every neighborhood should have a restaurant like Chalkboard. Chalkboard has been open for 3  1/2 years, and it took me that long to get there.  The gigantic chalkboard is a good idea.  The wait staff spends time explaining the dishes and answering questions.  However, it also has challenges.  Certain vantage points in the room make it hard to see the board.  There are tables outside on the sidewalk.  You have to come in the room to look at the board.  That quibble aside, I'm a fan of both Chef Langlois and Ms. Laidlaw, and I'm glad that this earnest mom&pop operation is thriving and gives me reason to visit Lincoln Square.  The room has a faint shabby chic look to it.  Calm colors and nice flea market accessories.  One minor quibble is that at full capacity, with a few large groups, it can get very, very noisy. We started with the Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese salad, and Smelts & Bacon.  The beets were yellow & red baby beets, roasted whole.  The intense beet flavor exploded in the mouth.  The goat cheese came on the plate almost as a smear.  For the Smelts & Bacon, our waiter went at lengths describing how the bacon was marinated with maple, soy, and a whole bunch of other stuff.  What made it truly special was that Chef came out to the serving station (which we were seated next to), snipped a bunch of broccoli flowers from the vase, and scattered them on my plate.  We had been watching Chef do that on other dishes, and our Smelt & Bacon was the last dish that got that treatment.  I'd like to think I'm that special ;-).  It came in a vanilla infused sauce, which made it a nuanced savory/sweet dish.  For our mains, we had the Trout 'fish & chips', and Wild roasted Salmon with Napa Cabbage & Spring Peas in a salted Almond puree.  The fish & chips was a fanciful play on the classic.  The Trout slices were lightly breaded and flash-fried.  The chips are house made crisps.  The tartar sauce I'm at a lost on words.  The Salmon was roasted medium, melted in the mouth.  The Cabbage & Peas were screaming (well, quietly reminding perhaps, as it was fairly light) spring!  We had a bottle of Domaine Francois Cazin from Cour-Cheverny.  It was 100% romorantin, a very rare varietal these days.  It was great learning something new.  The wine was dry and had crisp acidity.  A great complement to the dishes. I'm normally not a dessert person, but got sold on the Organic Berries with Lavender Yogurt & Champagne-battered Pound Cake.  The yogurt was both assertive yet had the delicate flavor of lavender.  The Pound Cake was fun.  I'm seeing more of champagne-battered things on menus these days. Why 4 stars?  Creative dishes using organic, local ingredients.  Even the wines are 90% organic or sustainable.  Chalkboard is truly a great neighborhood gem.",0.9892,0.879,0.105,0.016,0.5136089466089465

The food was also amazing.  We sampled duck, pork, beef, salmon.  We had crab bisque, beet salad with goat cheese, pate, calamari with spicy sausage, and of course I cannot forget the best desert I have ever had - the cookie dough egg roll.  Oh. My. God. OMG.  Additionally, Chalkboard has a nice wine list (I had a montrachet by the glass) and a small selection of liquors.  All of the food was really good, and the focus on seasonal and local foods makes my heart warm.  That being said, only a couple of the dishes, in my opinion, were spectacular.  Honestly, I thought several of dishes would have come alive with some salt, but salt and pepper are on request only at Chalkboard - a daring move for a chef in Chicago, particularly a chef who might be afraid of Anne Burrell style salting in the kitchen.   The concept of the restaurant is spot on, though.  It's romantic without being stuffy.  It's welcoming without being kitschy.  It's elegant without being pretentious.  The menu is fresh and local, the food is prepared well, the service is excellent, and the design is nearly flawless.  I can't wait to go back with friends for fried chicken and bottomless champagne on Wednesdays!",0.9976,0.761,0.209,0.029,0.6652777777777776

Over a martini and a starter glass of wine, we started with the seared scallops with Kalamata olives and vanilla bean mayo (so many things going on... just amazing) and for the main course split the duck in a clay pot and an order of their inSANEly unbelievable smoked gouda mac 'n cheese.  Now let me tell you - I am a *nut* about mac 'n cheese, but I honestly think that was probably the most amazing version I can remember having. What took this meal over the top was our waiter and the chef, both of whom took such great care of us.  For a Friday night, it was surprisingly empty in the restaurant - but for our sake that meant we got all of the attention!  Our waiter walked us through both the drink menu and all the items on the board with such care and passion - it was hard not to appreciate his attentiveness.  He also offered to reduce the price of the bottle of wine we went with by $10 because the bottle we had originally requested was out, and he felt it was the best substitute.  We also met the chef - he came out to our table and chatted with us for a good 10 minutes, telling us about how the restaurant came into being (and that he had also put a bid on the location that was to become Scylla, before Stephanie Izard sold it and won Top Chef).

2010-06-14,4.0,"I consider myself a ""Lady Who Teas"" as opposed to a ""Lady of Leisure"" or ""Lady Who Brunches."" I look forward to the ritual of tea with lovely friends and lively conversation. There's nothing better than drinking tea, eating scones, and having lots of fun with your friends on a rainy afternoon.

Chalkboard's afternoon tea is a solid entry in Chicago's tea scene. There's a wide selection of teas to choose from ranging from whites to greens to blacks. I chose a House White tea after drinking a few iced teas already earlier in the day. The tea was served in delicate, white porcelain pots while Lori's blooming tea was served in a clear glass carafe. I enjoyed the tea but didn't see any lemons to enhance the flavor.  Our tea sandwiches and scones were pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing and memorable. They smartly served one tea service tray per two people, so there were plenty for everyone to taste while chatting. The bites seemed especially small. I know it's a tea service, but we're no lightweights either. Generally, I enjoyed the lavender cookies and a crisp wonton filled with chocolate ganache. However, the coconut macaroon was tiny and a little burnt. The masterpieces of an afternoon tea were lacking. The scones looked like flattened, crumbly pancakes not airy, fluffy decadent treats. They also weren't served with lemon curd and Devonshire/clotted cream. I always look forward to the extra indulgence of clotted cream and lemon curd. None were found among our tea accessories.  Overall, Chalkboard's afternoon tea service is a good entry into Chicago's tea service scene. They were lacking in the best components of an afternoon tea service: clotted cream and lemon curd.

We ordered two apps and an entree to share.  Apps were scallops with a vanilla mayo, candied olives, sage and walnuts.  It was tasty.  The scallops were very well cooked.  $13 for two scallops was a bit steep.  The other app was halibut cheeks with parsnip puree.  Again, tasty, but not ""rock my world"" tasty for $14.  Our dinner was the duck cassoulet, recommended by the server after she steered us away from the BBQ quail.  I always appreciate when a servers shares that an item ""isn't there favorite on the menu"" or ""we do XXX better"".  The cassoulet was to have a seared duck breast, duck confit, sausage and chicken.  The duck breast was cooked nicely, not overdone.  Two or three coins of sausage.  There was no confit that we could identify and the chicken was sliced of fried chicken breast.   Chalkboard features friend chix on the menu every night.  Honestly, I felt like the cassoulet was their leftovers in disguise for $28.  It was ok, but not worth $28 even with the duck breast. We opted out of dessert.  With two glasses of champagne, one glass of wine, 2 apps and 1 entree the bill was $90 before tip. There are too many other places in Chicago that I want to try before I'll return.",0.9751,0.812,0.129,0.059,0.5553854875283447

It came out a really quickly. Personally, I would have liked a few extra minutes to enjoy my cocktail before eating but that's just me. Next time I would wait before ordering since they serve the apps so promptly. It was served with pickled watermelon, sprouts and a vanilla infused mayo. Really tasty and a generous portion for $13. My date had an arugula salad, very simple but good. For the main course he had the scallop appetizer which was awesome. I ordered the brined pork loin. I really did not like it. I'm not sure how it was cooked but it was not what I expected. I like the char marks on pork and this almost tasted like it had been steamed. It was juicy but lacked any flavor. I was disappointed. I also ordered a martini and its a personal pet peeve when restaurants serve martini's in those itty bitty glasses. Come on, its not 1950! Give me the giant glass already!

They offer a $25 deal that includes all you can drink champagne (Hallelujah to that!), fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and some amazing (albeit mystery) sauce to top it all off. Not only was everything scrumptious, it was reasonably priced too...gotta love that. To top off  this already amazing food orgy was an order of the gouda mac and cheese app. Gooey cheesy noodly goodness, in a big ol' tub. I was in heaven. The staff were most excellent, and extremely attentive (the crumb scraper guy was especially talented - the man knows his way around a table crumber, for sure).  The only downside of the evening were reports from my compatriots that the mussels were pretty bland.

We made the reservation a few days prior and spoke with the restaurant on the logistics of payment, etc. Because there were 12 or so of us, and given some people would be drinking, some not, some order more than others, etc., I wanted to be able to have seperate checks for my party. Not an unheard of thing. There were several couples so it would have only been a few checks. The problem is, when we called and made a reservation and noted this request, we were told, ""no problem"" and that it would be ok. The person took a credit card number to hold the reservation and we were set. So, we arrived, had good food, good service, and overall it was a fun evening. Accept, then the check arrived. And it was all on one bill. They wouldn't seperate it. Not even a manager or anyone came out to actually explain why, the server just noted that they don't do seperate checks.  Anyway, not to completely go on about this...we ended up spending the last 20 minutes of a fun night out worrying about seperating the check etc and then waiting on them to run the different cards, more etc. It would have been nice and made a difference if a manager at least acknowledged our table as we did spend a fair amount for the evening.

My girlfriends and I decided that we wanted to have a more laid back tea service as a holiday get-together. We've been to The Ritz-Carlton, The Drake, and The Russian Tea Room and this was by far the most delightful experience because it was intimate, cozy, and perfectly simple.  When I called to make the reservation, Mikaela assisted me on the phone. She was very nice and thorough. She made sure to ask if anyone in the party of eight had special dietary needs. Upon arrival for our Sunday afternoon tea service, I was delighted to learn that Mikaela was also going to be our server. She was very cool and has a lot of knowledge about tea. Mikaela asked us several times if we had questions and she made very good recommendations based on the preferences that people in the party shared with her. She educated us on the different varieties and used just the right amount of colorful adjectives.  While waiting for the tea service, I looked around to take in the atmosphere. We were 1 of 3 parties present and everyone looked very relaxed and comfortable. The dining space felt like I was sitting in the French country home I've always wanted, but will never have. Nice fabrics and colors on the benches, chandeliers with Christmas ornaments strung about, and a nice open layout (with service island) makes the restaurant functional and pleasant for the eye. The bathroom was really nice too and the owners/managers have taken the time to care about the environment by placing tasteful signs on the walls to inform guests about the benefits of saving energy and what they have done to help us be more sustainable during our visit.  The tea service was accommodated at a relaxed pace and this was perfect for us since we were catching up with one another. Our tea arrived and we were given instructions on how long we should let the tea steep. While ""steeping"" our tea, Mikaela turned up with tiny little mugs filled with a delicious roasted tomato bisque (w/ truffle oil...mmm). It was SO good and just the right amount since it is a very rich soup. Next came the tiered serving trays and we received the following: Tier 1 - Egg Salad finger sandwiches & sausage w/ Greek Yogurt (I think...it was good, but I've misplaced the details in my head), Tier 2 - An incredible scone w/ jam & Devonshire Cream - SO GOOD!, Tier 3 - A mix of desserts from little chocolate cookies, brownies, cookie dough egg roll (house specialty), and fresh fruit.  It was a totally relaxed afternoon, I'm definitely going back, props to Mikaela for making everything so nice and easy, and I recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a classy afternoon tea experience in Chicago.",0.9987,0.784,0.21,0.006,0.5953373015873016
2009-12-17,4.0,"Only two other parties were present when we dined at Chalkboard. It was a very intimate, but lively atmosphere. I think there were only three people running the whole show, all very friendly and attentive and appearing quite busy. It felt a bit like dining at the home of a friend.  The starters were one good and one not-so-good. We ordered the scallops, and they were served with a vanilla bean sauce and caramelized kalamata olives and toasted herbs...extremely interesting and fragrant combination that was excellent. I don't really eat seafood, but for this I had to try a bite. The pungent fishiness of the scallops was definitely there, but it was well-balanced with the sweet flavorings. The salad, however, was difficult to eat. It was made with really spicy greens and topped with way too much fresh lemon juice. The fresh lemon flavor was good, but on overload. I couldn't eat the salad without making a face. It was supposed to be tossed with truffle oil as well, but the lemon was far too distracting from the truffle. It was also served with two little squares of plain boring toast, the purpose of which I am unsure. The fried chicken  - I didn't try any of this, but I could definitely smell an array of herbs and spices and the work of a deep fryer on an entire half-chicken from across the table. The breading looked very crispy and the chicken seemed really tender and juicy.  My boyfriend said it was great. The veggie pie - The server said it was like a vegetarian version of a sheperd's pie...but it was definitely more like a pot-pie than a shepherd's pie.  It was served scalding hot in a cast iron dish, topped with a layer of appearedly innocent puff pastry that was actually extremely savory, herby, garlicky, rich, buttery...you name it. The veggies inside were fresh brussels sprouts, green beans, fingerling potatoes, white beans, corn, carrots and baby turnips (and possibly more), all chunky-cut and very fresh, with slightly crunchy texture. The sauce over the veggies was a bit bland, but that was no matter due to the crazy puff pastry. A nice bottle of wine (half-price on Wednesdays), the two starters and two entrees added up to about $85, sans tax and tip. The strong point here was definitely the fresh and carefully-executed comfort food entrees on a wintry day. We were really tempted to order the smoked gouda mac and cheese as well (it sounded heavenly from the server's description), but worried that it would be way too much food...so for that, I think I might be back.",0.9982,0.735,0.219,0.046,0.5712125220458554

If you are going to use the chalk board concept (which I like) you need to be willing to describe ALL the menu items, not just ask if we have any questions.

The entrees were another story. The steak I ordered that came heavily recommended by our server ( I assume from the wine experience because it was the most expensive option), was worthy of a low end wedding reception. Not to mention it was $30! I was not asked how I wanted it prepared...this should have been my first red light. It came pre-cut into pieces...cheesy. The cheek ragu had broken so the steak was floating in a pool of brown ""sauce"" and oil. With a dry crust which I assume what used to be the ragu. It tasted like roast beef not a strip steak. It was not seared well or grilled and dried out. The brown outside faded into a light pink over done center. Awful. The 2 fingerling potatoes that came with it were not seasoned at all and tasted like the refrigerator. This steak was either par cooked or sat under the light for some time. Our other entrée was the Trout with the roasted Brussels sprouts. The oddly shaped trout was served skin on  with a huge bed of greens...cheap.   There were 3 sprouts that were not roasted at all and the fish was undercooked and the skin was soggy.

Well we're moving so now we're on a tear to see if we can get through all the restaurants we haven't tried.  We went to Chalkboard Thursday night for dinner.  First off, the restaurant was very empty just a few tables of folks. We were greeted and asked if it was our first time. Of course we said it was. We were told that the menu is on the chalkboard, of course it is, which works ok when it's empty but I'm not sure how that works when/if they're busy. The wine by the glass is also on a chalkboard in the back of the restaurant by the bar. We were told we could go look at that as well. Huh? So we wondered down there and checked it out.   Again, since there were only two of us, not a huge deal but what if we had a bigger party, or it was crowded. Just seemed weird. Couldn't the waiter just tell us the six choices they had, or provide a separate sheet on the wine list?  Onto the food. We started with the pate which was plated very nicely and quite delicious.  We ordered the fried chicken and the pork tenderloin and planned to share them. We ordered the chicken because the sign out front said that they have the best - so we figured anyone brave enough to post that on Lincoln Avenue, must be on to something.  The chicken was served on a pile of mashed potatoes and gravy. It looked weird but the chicken did have a nice crunchiness. My partner thought it was too peppery. I thought it was ok but not worth the $18 price tag. They don't tell you what you're getting with the chicken which is also a little weird, we should have asked. The pork tenderloin would have been dry if not for the corn/sauce they served on it. It just wasn't that good and again for $20 it wasn't worth it. The chef came by during our meal to ask how everything was he seemed very distracted and nervous. Not at ease coming out and chatting. Later we saw him flipping through the reservation book and nervously looking around the room. Clearly he was concerned that is was so empty on a Thursday night. And he should be. At the minimum they should consider lowering their prices as many restaurants have during the recession.

2009-04-13,3.0,"I should wish chalk, boards, and chalkboards to hell. I am spending most of my days using them - and hating every second of it. Chalk stains my dark outfits and irritates my hands. And when it squeaks on the infamous and ubiquitous vector of knowledge all around the world - the aforementioned board - it is just.....maddening...and wants me to drop everything and run away screaming in the hallways. Not that I ever do. Or did. Or will do. I seriously doubt it at least. Despite my hatred of the actual object I decided to take my girlfriends here, the restaurant, for tea service on Saturday. Because a chalkboard in a restaurant is a good thing. It means fresh products and changing menus. So off we went. It was a very sunny (if cool - damn you Chicago) afternoon and it made marvels for the place decorated in a French country style: soft green walls, red and gold stripped banquettes and big nice mirrors that magically lighted up the place. Add a few whimsy chandeliers and you have the perfect setting for posh tea. Score! Our waitress was perfect all the way and very attentive. We of course went for the $19 tea service (but you can actually order a la carte) and were quite pleased with our three-tier serving dish: - on top finger sandwiches, well pinkie sandwiches....they were really teeny-tiny...and a little bit disappointing. The egg-salad was not truffled, the sausage was not duck-y (!) and the bean salad was parsley-less and pretty bland... the brie was delicious though and I licked my fingers. A few times. - the scones were warm and decent sized; they were served with butter and a wonderful home-made jam. But no lemon curd? no Devonshire cream? That's a drag dude....a big one.... - the pastries on the other hand were just awesome and we had plenty to choose from: coconut macaroons, chocolate tartlets, blueberry bread pudding (?), fried wontons, butter cookies,....bite-size of course but perfect. The hot water was flowing for our teas and we were just happy there, chatting and nibbling in the sun. Just the way a classroom should be.",0.9726,0.806,0.129,0.065,0.5480555555555556
2009-03-30,4.0,"Quick update on the likes of Chalkboard... finally got back in to try the dinner delights with the equally delightful Rob L. You see, I said I needed to get back in asap to try the black truffle risotto with shaved asiago and a fried duck egg and I meant it!!!  True to Yelp form, Rob and I did a quick overview of the evening menu (plus specials) and decided that (almost) one of everything should be a sufficient taste test. Lemme break it down:  * The 'special' Risotto app - Tasty, generous portion, super rich. Was it great? Ehhhh, it was good. A tad under-salted and slightly overdone aka mushy risotto. A bit disappointing, but then again I was prepared to have this be Jesus' second coming.  * Soup du Jour - Creamy, fabulous tomato basil soup nestled side-by-side with the best version of grilled cheese to have ever passed these lips! Blue Cheese + Brioche + a heavy hand with butter = A sinful tryst with carbs and dairy worthy of jumping off any diet wagon.  * Barramundi with Chorizo, Lemongrass, Celery Root Puree and Spinach - Crispy, flaky, magnificent fish with a really unique layering of flavors. The celery root puree tasted like heaven... who knew... I'm sure it's liberal bath in chorizo juice didn't hurt.  * Duck cassoulet with roasted breast, confit of thigh, Spanish chorizo, white bean and forest mushrooms - Chorizo really makes everything better, doesn't it?! Chorizo cupcakes? Maybe not so much, but in this case yes... succulent duck breast, crispy confit, and super savory, hearty accompaniments. A total mans dish! Shhh... Rob may or may not have done a few curls while savoring each luscious bite.  * Spiced chocolate pot au creme and vanilla ice cream - Like eating the most scrumptious homemade frosting or fudge straight out of the chef's bowl... only presented in lovely fashion with some uber creamy vanilla ice cream no less. Save room, you're taste buds will thank you even if your love handles won't.  Service was again friendly and laid back, though unfortunately this time the restaurant itself was near empty on a Thursday night. Would like to see a bit more of a bustling-this-is-the-spot-to-be type vibe... since, after all, the food already speaks the language of cool.",0.9976,0.711,0.233,0.056,0.5141131815044858

The Good: For $19 you get your own pot of tea, a selection of sandwiches, scones and psalteries- not bad right?  The sandwiches were amazing, one each of truffled egg salad with roe, brie and duck sausage and olive oil, white bean and parsley on round toasts.  I preferred these sandwiches to the more traditional ham or cucumber tea sandwiches.  The scones (one each) were very good and served warm but on the smaller size- I could have eaten a few more!  The pastry end to the meal was a small blueberry bread pudding square, chocolate tartlets and an amazing friend wanton with chocolate inside (YUM!).    The Bad: The lemon curd we were given- one of my tea favorites- was sweet, not the usual mouth puckering tart that I look forward to with my scones.  After we received out tea the waiter never came back.  I'm sure he wanted to let the two ladies visit (gossip?!) and enjoy the meal, but I would have like a refill or two on my hot water, which I was never offered.  As good as the food was, it was not very filling and both of us left a bit hungry.  (Note: do not not choose afternoon tea in place of lunch.)

We pulled a card out (it was a late week night in mid-November, this is my first review on this site) and went to Chalkboard. Actually, the one and only restaurant that we had a chance to visit from the deck of cards (now they're expired so we'll have to start all over again). We live in the area and it was late so it was the best choice for us.  It's called Chalkboard because the menu is on the chalkboard in front of you. Pretty neat concept. The atmosphere is very low key, intimate and is great for a small group or just the two of you. It's not the place I would take children or huge groups.   It's dark so I probably wouldn't conduct business there if there was paperwork to go over. The food... small portions but oh so filling! The taste... AMAZING! It was like a party in my mount. Everything we had was delicious. We skipped the appetizer since we didn't want to overdue it that late at night. I had the halibut and hubby had the braised pork shoulder in apple cider over vanilla spatzel, (have no idea what they were since that was something new to both of us - the spatzel, but they were goooood). The cookie dough egg roll wasn't as great as we had hoped but that's because we didn't take the waiters' suggestion or my better judgement to get the bread pudding. My husband had a glass of Cabernet and I sneaked a sip... it was delicious and crisp!  The service was a bit slow but that was so that we would get comfortable, which we did. It seemed that he was the only one there since we didn't see anyone except the busboy who brought water after we asked for it. There were only 3 other tables that night and the two were already done with their food by the time we ordered... so it shouldn't of been that slow but it's not a big deal. The waiter was very nice and informative. There was one shady detail at the end which put a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. He didn't charge for the dessert... possibly because we were first time patrons, not sure, he didn't say why and I just wanted to go home from a late night of work, so I thought ""that was nice"" but when we gave the gift certificate along with the credit card, he reprinted the receipt and the total reflected a total that was about the same before the $10 deduction. He added the dessert and took off the $10. I don't mind getting charged for the dessert since we did order it, what bothered me was that he didn't say anything about changing the total. We didn't say anything, just signed the credit slip. He never came back to take the slip so we just left.  We may or may not go again, I would just be more open on any discrepancies in the future.

The portions were substantial and I felt the restaurant provides value for the prices.  We also got a bottle of wine, so the bill was nothing to sneeze at, but if you're on a budget and intrigued by the menu you should give it a try.

All the specials were written on a chalkboard in script that was illegible from where I was sitting.  It still topped the normal menu, where every item was followed by a stilted and grammatically incorrect comment from the chef.  Clearly, all this would be excusable if the food was good - but it was very uninspired.  I had the pot pie and others had the pork chop, steak and halibut.  No one finished their plates and we're a family of big eaters. The last complaint is that our server was slow, which he attributed to his hangover - give me a break.",-0.0138,0.912,0.051,0.038,0.41785714285714287

I was the only customer when I started, and when I left at 6:30, there were 2 other tables.  I stopped here because their menu says that they use organic food whenever possible, and their fish of the day item in the menu says that they try to only buy sustainable fish.  I had a great appetizer -- poivre ostrich with pickeled radishes and blackberries. Sweet, Salty, Sour all in different or same bites. Very good.  For Entree I had veggie pie, which was alright, but not as nice as the appetizer.  Service was attentive, but should be when there's only one customer in the restaurant.  Decor was relatively simple, with the namesake chalkboard taking up most of one wall and a simple white scheme inside. Lighting is minimal, so when the sun sets, it's very dark / romantic depending on your point of view.",0.7238,0.894,0.07,0.035,0.5693452380952381

First, the owner was seating people and gave us a little overview of the menu when we got to our table, which was nice - it's so rare to see the owner in a restaurant!  Our server then told us the menu, which was also on the board... he had helpful suggestions about everything and I was pretty impressed with his knowledge of all the ingredients in each dish - did he spend time cooking there also? So, we both ended up with beef dishes - me with a strip steak, my wife with a London Broil.  Fantastic!  Great flavors in the dishes. We picked out a nice Malbec from the huge wine list and it was kept on the island in the middle of the dining room for us, kind of a nice touch - it kept it off our table.  Our server was attentive with refills. And the dessert - awesome!  Chocolate chip cookie egg roll.  CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE EGG ROLL.  These are the words that will melt my cold heart.  It was amazing.  And the bread pudding that my wife had was equally fantastic - more subtle than the over the top dessertgasm of the egg roll, which may have actually made it the better dish.  Really great.

My hunch was confirmed upon arrival. Chalkboard is a small, tastefully decorated restaurant. There are mirrors that help to give the place more depth and a few cute decorations scattered about. When I first walked in, I am sure I smelled a lavender scented oil burning. Delicious and RELAXING. I immediately felt soothed and knew I was in for a pleasurable dining experience.  They were kind enough to seat me right away on Friday night at 7 pm without a reservation. My waiter, Sean or Alex (I can't remember), was great. He was personable and kind to a lady dining alone with book in hand.  After weeks of fried chicken cravings, I was pleased to see it as a special. $25 though? It had better be good! It was. It was a generous circular portion of chicken (how did they shape it like that?) on top of chunky mashed potatoes with a flavorful (read: fattening) gravy. Didn't he say it came with sauted greens? There they are buried in the middle all the way underneath the chicken! Huh.  I enjoyed the experience on so many different levels. The setting itself is perfect. The service was spectacular. The wine worked although it fell short of my idea of a full glass. The food was exactly what I had hoped. The clientele was sheik. It's three blocks from my place. I am sad to hear from all the Yelpers below that the tea service falls short. I intended that to be my next visit.

So, perhaps I was not well prepared for this visit. I had heard such lovely things about Chalkboard...I was excited to go. I thought the concept to be ""cute."" What better way to spend an evening than indulging in upscale comfort food and red wine?  Our table was right next to the bar, but it took nearly 15 minutes to get a wine list and order a bottle. (El Filino Malbec, the saving grace of the meal). For a place that ""specializes in wine"" I was a bit underwhelmed by the service/wine knowledge. After a glass or so, I ceased to care.  The food: Hmmm. I'm not sure what to think. Even if we had been paying reasonable prices for the food, I'd have been disappointed. I know it's more ""upscale"" and they use ""organic ingredients"" but I cannot justify a $9 salad composed of lettuce and cheese. Throw me a tomato, guys...for real. The kobe beef burger appetizer was absolutely comical, and charred on one side. If I get a $12 slider-like portion of kobe beef, it best not be burned.  The tomato bisque soup was quite good, and the brioche it was served with was honestly the highlight of the meal. We split the banana bread pudding for dessert, and it was quite good. We ordered an extra side of ice cream and it was an extra $4. I don't know...I felt that was a bit tacky, as the entire dessert that INCLUDED ice cream was $7, but oh well.  Just...not impressed. The decor was nice and such, but if one is dropping some major dough on dinner, they shouldn't feel like they are sitting in their grandmother's living room.

The Place:  Very cozy, small space on the border between North Center and Lincoln Square.  It's not the easiest to find, since the outside sign is just a chalkboard (so it's not just a clever name), but once you're there, it feels a little like family.  In fact, one of the waiters had his little son there in his PJ's to say goodnight.  I wouldn't go with more than 4 people, maybe 6, as the tables are small and intimate. The Service:  Our waiter was obviously a pro, and very helpful with both food and wine suggestions.  He was not afraid to point out that the pork tenderloin and the pork shoulder were different in texture, but not much in flavor.  It's a simple comment, but that's the kind of help people need sometimes. The Food:  This is what gives it 5 stars.  Pork shoulder braised in apple cider, with creamed onions and a brussels sprouts salad.  The meat was fork tender, and everything was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and sauced.  The duck was cooked beautifully, and the white bean cassoulet was delicious.  It was half way through the meal when we realized that there was no butter or salt & pepper on the table.  It takes some serious balls to be that confident in your seasonings to not put S&P on the table.  Even the breads were brushed with olive oil and salt to the point where butter wasn't necessary.  The best way I could describe the overall taste experience was that ""absolutely nothing has been overlooked.""   Oh, and the bread pudding changes every day.  Last night there were fennel seeds and a caramel sauce that played off each other perfectly.  With vanilla ice cream, you can't go wrong with a great bread pudding on a cold winter night. All in all, this place is terrific.  I'd go there over any of the downtown steakhouses for a celebration dinner.  Be ready to pay, but it's worth every penny.",0.993,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.5479780801209372

2008-02-02,4.0,"When I first moved in to the North Center, I yelped to find out what restaurants were in the area, what were the hits and not to be missed spots. Chalkboard popped up, upscale twist on comfort food? I was very intrigued. I talked with my friend Sarah about it and she, her fiance, Jeff and I came here last Friday for dinner. I was excited, she was excited, then she changed her mind and wanted to come two hours earlier, (I told her she didn't want to come here at 8:30pm), they were friendly and great about fitting us in at 6:30pm. Now when we came in, we were running late, (I called ahead and told them we were running ten minutes behind), we arrived, warmly greeted and promptly seated. Very tiny space, maybe about 15 tables totaled, but very cozy, very intimate space, light blue walls, white trim, dark wood, made me feel very New Englandy.... Our server was great, friendly, informative, helpful with suggestions, attentive, energetic, just solid. We started off with a bottle of Malbec and these rolls that they passed out were great, slightly sweet with just a hint of butter. Jeff had to be like me and order the tomato bisque with blue cheese crostini, their version of grilled cheese and tomato soup, the bisque was amazing, very well seasoned, had a little heat to it and the blue cheese mini grilled cheese were great. We also started with the Dover sea scallops that were seared, came with a vanilla aioli, balsamic vinegar, walnuts and my new favorite food, candied kalamata olives. Yes, they were candied, sweet and savory, chewy but still had a burst of juiciness. Then again Jeff had to follow my lead with getting the duck, which was a seared duck breast with a confit of shredded duck leg, white beans, mushrooms and chorizo sausage. I have to say the confit was amazing, the duck breast was cooked just right, tender and moist. However, the breast wasn't seasoned that much and I felt the confit overpowered the breast a little too much with out lending to each other. Sarah had their pork tenderloin, cooked just right with some creamed corn and celery root, again, quite good, just not the biggest creamed corn. We also got a side of the mac and cheese, really good, not amazing, but quite solid. Then came dessert. We had two, the champagne battered pound cake with vanilla syrup and strawberries, this I found to be just all right. It sounded so much better, but I felt like it was a little too subtle for my tastes. Then we had this organic vanilla bean ice cream and the chocolate dessert. Now the chocolate was called a pudding, it was by no means a pudding. It was chocolate flavored heaven. It was dense, rich, thick, firm chocolate mousse that was just melt in your mouth amazingness. I was really tempted to grab the dish and lick the chocolate off... I felt that was probably a little too much so I just used my finger.  This is such a solid four stars and I would not hesitate recommending this place or coming back here.

2008-01-25,5.0,"A charming restaurant. Cozy and inviting, it turned out to be an appropriate alternative to my couch on a frigid winter evening. The fish on the board that night was barramundi, which I adore, so I was thrilled. (The last memorable barramundi I had was at Spring, which I thought might be a hard act to follow.) The fish was prepared beautifully, pan-roastedly crisp skin with moist, delicate flesh. Tasted fresh as well. I was a bit dubious about the accompanying celery root puree, but it was a lovely match.   My pal I had the fried chicken, which came with mashed potatoes and what appeared to be sausage gravy. Quite a rustic presentation, the half chicken set atop a mound of lumpy white creaminess--but all tasty goodness. She got the mac & cheese, too. Now I am NOT a fan of gouda, but I must admit that it did add a unique, smoky/nutty flavor that I found appealing. I'm not adding it to my home recipe or anything, but I can always appreciate a well-executed rendition of the dish. And this one certainly was: cheesy, creamy and yummy.  I think I ordered the wrong thing for dessert, the chocolate pot au creme, which came w/a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Sure, the pot was chocolatey and rich, but I picked up no hint of ""spice"" as the menu advertised. It was an adequate end--but I'm not an adequate-dessert kind of gal. My pal I got the chocolate bread pudding--this DID have the spice, and it was more than adequate, enough to make me very jealous. Service was good, not amazing. I'd definitely go back.",0.984,0.736,0.193,0.071,0.6414742664742663
2008-01-22,5.0,"Despite the night being of the below-zero variety, Chalkboard was packed last Saturday night. Two things right off the bat - since it was so crowded, the host took our coats immediately. Also, when I, embarrassed, asked if I could somehow get some quarters for the parking meter, the host brandished a small dish full of quarters and gave me the two necessary. Unexpected, and a great service to provide to customers. The one problem is that we waited a tad long for our server, but that was soon forgotten. We got a great bottle of a South African Syrah blend, and started off with a crab cake that was super fresh, but admittedly a little bready. The little lady had the duck from the menu, which was almost perfectly cooked, while I had the pork osso bucco from the chalkboard, which I thought was incredible. It was soaked in apple cider with pureed onion, and fell off the bone. For dessert we had the cayenne chocolate with awesome vanilla ice cream, and their daily bread pudding, which in this case was ginger and chestnut. Both we delicious and completely finished. The whole way through, our wine glasses stayed full and any questions were responded to with good humor, as if our server had all the time in the world. Also, despite the small space, the unassuming but classy decor kept things comfortable. The check ended up pretty high, but not unexpectedly so.

2007-11-28,3.0,"I live right in the the neighborhood and had been long anticipating a visit to Chalkboard. When I called in to ask about their Monday hours, they strongly suggested I make a reservation, but when we arrived for dinner, there were two other tables seated. Seriously, guys, get over yourselves. The dcor suited me perfectly, despite our wobbly table. Pretty white tablecloths, long banquettes against one wall and small tables everywhere else. Gorgeous little chandeliers on the ceilings and, of course, the signature blackboards on the opposite wall from us, detailing the night's specials. Unfortunately, that's about where my love affair stopped. We had a sashimi moi (a sweetfish, apparently) served with a miso broth and topped with pink peppercorns...absolutely nothing about it that stood out to me. For our entre, we split the hanger steak served with fingerling potatoes and sauted kale with pearl onions, topped with a ""dollop"" of truffle mayo. By dollop they seemed to mean ice-cream-scoopful. Our steak, though cooked wonderfully, was drowned in this pungent sauce, and it totally ruined the experience for me. Dessert redeemed the meal a bit (and luckily, I was still hungry because we'd split everything else): chocolate-chip cookie dough egg rolls! Just what they sounded like: Wonton skins wrapped around real cookie dough, then deep fried until everything's crispy and just warm enough, like a sheet of cookies that's been baked for three minutes. Served over drizzles of caramel sauce and paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, of which I ate none. I was in heaven. I wanted more.  In short, I might give Chalkboard another try. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and also very attentive--though he only had three tables. I would have worried otherwise. Next time I'll get the mac and cheese and sample another dessert. Maybe if you go in expecting less, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Wine bottle prices were prohibitive, and none of the wines by the glass, though affordable, were available in bottles. Very strange indeed.",0.9825,0.789,0.14,0.07,0.5241409266409267

2007-10-14,5.0,"What a delightful place to dine. We've been dying to eat here and used an anniversary as a reason to finally head out here. I was to extremely disappointed that it took us so long. Chalkboard is a small establishment so if you have plans to dine here on a weekend you probably want to make your 'arrangements' (obscure Seinfeld reference) at least two weeks in advance. While it is small -I still can't believe the size of the kitchen- in size their food preparation is out of this world. The service at Chalkboard matches the quality of the food. Our server 'who deserves special mention' knew the menu inside out. Almost as if she prepared it herself. Usually wait staff commit to memory the food preparation, but she actually made it sound like she was going back in the kitchen to make them just for us.  On to the food though. I am a sucker for duck no matter what the circumstance. The duck on their menu is prepared differently every day. So I had to get it. It was out of this world, but like I said it is prepared differently every time so yeah -try it! The Mac and Cheese had been talked up so much, but once our server mentioned Gouda I simply had to see what Mac and Cheese with Gouda would taste like. Here also a wise choice. I thought the best Mac and Cheese was done at T's on Clark. Well move over T's, there's a new King of the Block.  I could go on but would rather not. The only blemish was some of the customers early into our evening but I'm not going to blame Chalkboard for it's increasing popularity. I only say this because by the end of the night we'd made friends with the diners next to us. Oh yeah. Take their servers beer recommendation. They specialize in Unibroue products.",0.9898,0.804,0.157,0.038,0.5076298701298702
2007-10-06,4.0,"Really really good, with glimmers of great.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4. Location is funky but street parking was easy -- even on a Friday night.  Just don't forget to bring a couple of quarters before 9pm. First, I'll clear out the baggage: Be warned that when the room is full, it's loud.  Really loud, like you will probably have to raise your voice to be heard by the people next to you.  Loud, like Boka was before putting up all the sound baffling. Our server was friendly but a little more scarce than we would have liked.  Basics like water, bread, pepper required some nudging, and I was bummed that it took almost 10 minutes to learn that the bottle of wine I ordered was out.  The place just isn't that big. The only main course that wasn't great was the hanger steak a friend ordered.  She thought the steak was just OK but was actually brought down by the ""truffle mayo"" which she said was ""funky-sweet mayo.""  Maybe she doesn't like truffles (I doubt that's the case here).  But I didn't try the dish so I can neither confirm nor deny. Although desserts did not get rave reviews around the table, I personally thought the bread pudding was very tasty.  But I'm not a big dessert fan, so what do I know?  I was outvoted. On to the highlights:  The duck cassoulet was fantastic.  Fantastic.  I've said this 1-2x before about dishes elsewhere, but this was one I wanted to order twice so I could put one on the floor and roll around in it.  It was cooked perfectly, the flavors were right on, the textures were great.  And there was chorizo in it.  Everything is better with chorizo. My wife had the bouillabaise, which she had also eaten on our previous visit.  That dish too was delicious and a lot of food.  So much that she couldn't finish, and I had to take one for the team by switching plates and completing the job.  Only downside of this dish was the brioche which is slathered with what tasted like honey mustard from a jar -- too sweet, bad match, not worth eating. The wine list is crazy, diverse, full of bottles you're unlikely to see anywhere else and almost all very reasonable, probably averaging $50-70.  It's a little too pinot noir-centric for my taste, but that skew does make sense given what's on the menu. Bottom line: I'd like to see the service speed up and a couple of the little kinks get worked out, but those things aside Chalkboard is absolutely worth trying and going back.",0.9973,0.767,0.182,0.051,0.5330710835058663

2007-08-03,5.0,"An advanced warning, this review is going to be long! So here are my notes on this absolutely phenominal meal: ATMOSPHERE:  I came in here not knowing what to expect.  Eric N. seemed to waffle on this place between his two meals so I wasn't sure how things would turn out.  I can tell you this, though: we walked in there on a Thursday night, with no reservations, and were seated immediately.  There's a positive in your favor Chalkboard.   On the South wall is a giant 20' x 5' chalkboard, divided into eight sections with 4 entrees and 4 apps described in detail.  This is the focal point of the restaurant (a separate chalkboard describes the per glass bottles of wine just to the left of that chalkboard). The seating configuration isn't over the top, though if you are seated on the sides of the restaurant one of two things could be a detriment: (1) the tables are pretty close to one another and (2) the actual chalkboards become quite difficult to see.  That works against Chalkboard.  The ambiance of the place seems a bit muddled to me.  The decor seems to waffle between Tuscan tiles on the ground, to farm decor on the walls, to two outdated and seemingly out of place chandeliers.  I think they were definitely going for a upper-scale farmy feeling, but the decor just seemed a little hodge-podge to me. Like Eric, I could see the place getting really, really loud on the weekends, especially if there were more than two groups seated.  As it stood, the sound wasn't terrible for us.   FOOD:  Kudos to Chef Langlois for a fantastic dinner.  Maybe kudos aren't enough.  I am sitting at my computer typing at 9:30 a.m. and my mouth is still watering from his meal.  Chef Langlois certainly cooks in the french style, using superb ingredients and simple preparations, attempting to highlight the meats and produce, without overpowering them with seasoning.   We started by ordering and sharing the crab salad.   I am fairly certain that at least 6 crabs met their demise for our salad.  There was a good 4"" x 4"" x 4"" pile of lump crab in the middle of our plate, one slice of cucumber wedged, and probably a tablespoon of mesculan greens on the plate.  To say the crab was the highlight of the ""salad"" is an understatement.  Served with the crab are two mustards; one, which seemed to be your standard grainy, wonderful french mustard, and the second, which we later learned, was a grape mustard.  I highly recommend the grape mustard.   My only criticism of the salad was that we both found a couple small pieces of crab shell in the dish and Allie found a bit of connective tissue in there.  Not something you really want to be digging out of your mouth in the middle of a fine restaurant. For the main courses, I asked the server for a recommendation and she suggested the scallops and duck.  Thank you for the rec!  If I had just had the scallops, I would have been content.  If I had just had the duck confit, I would have been ecstatic.  But Chalkboard, when you pair those two together, my mouth was doing backflips and taking me along for the ride!   The scallops were prepared perfectly, tender on the inside with enough of a browned crust that it provided the perfect tenderness and chew.   But the duck confit is what took the cake.  For those of you who don't know, confit means, essentially, to cook in its own fat.  This leg of duck would be welcome on my table any time it would like.  Even if it would mean me gaining 30 or so pounds, well, I'd take one for the team.  The meat was succulent, falling off the bone, with just the perfect amount of salt and acid to balance the taste.  So very, very good.  On the side were beautiful chantrelle mushrooms and a celeryroot puree.  The puree really didn't have a place for me as its sweet taste didn't enhance the sweetness of the scallops, but sort of masked it.  I'd keep it out of the dish.  The chantrelles, however, were divine.   For dessert, I ordered the chocolate egg roll.  Each bite, I wanted more and each bite I wanted to savor the taste and the feeling I had from it a little longer.  In a word, that dessert was almost orgasmic.  A definite highlight in a wonderful meal. ALCOHOL: We ordered a bottle of the '04 Vouvray, a vintage that comes out of the Loire Valley in France.  We ended up being served with an '05.  The extra year would have helped as the wine was a bit young, but still provided the subtle sweetness that we were looking for with our seafood.  The list looked diverse, though nothing I really recognized vintner-wise.  It wasn't a highlight, but certainly didn't detract from the wonderful food that was served either. Overall, I will be returning here but remain skeptical about it on the weekends as I could see the accoustics getting really, really loud.  The food and dessert are both superb, though.  And the price isn't too bad either as we got out of their for $150 for an ap, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, a bottle of wine, & tax & tip!",0.9993,0.807,0.169,0.024,0.5709652947696424

Went here last Wednesday and it was a good thing we had a reservation as they were turning people away without one.  The place was packed on a rainy, Wednesday night- I can't imagine what a Saturday looks like! I was the first of my party to arrive. The host directed me to the little ""nook"" area in the back to have a glass of wine and to wait for them.  You first stop at a tiny bar to place an order (hint- on the chalkboard behind the bar are a list of some really nice wines).  I had the Malbec and was not disappointed.  The host whisked away my umbrella and coat and I was left to look around the place. The restaurant is relatively small, with the one wall covered in a giant chalkboard that lists all of the specials not found on the menu.  The ambiance is sort of like ""Victorian living room"" without all the stuffiness. Once my friends arrived, we were seated promptly.  Our waiter was efficient, knowledgeable and quick to answer any questions that we had.  He encouraged us to order off the chalkboard as those were things that we could not get all the time.   The one misstep of the evening was that the tuna that I wanted, while posted on the chalkboard had not made it into the restaurant that day.  When I asked why it was still on the chalkboard, the answer I got is that they didn't want to re-write it the next day.  What's the point of the flexibility of the chalkboard if you don't keep it updated?? So, in the true sampling style that I like to eat out with, the three of us ordered appetizers and entrees to share, from both the printed menu and the chalkboard.  For appetizers, we had the halibut cheeks and the crab cake.  Both were delicious!  As for entrees, we split the fried chicken , pork tenderloin and the halibut special.  In my opinion, the pork was the best- flavorful and so tender.  We also split ,as a side, the smoked Gouda mac and cheese appetizer-VERY cheesy.  Hard to believe someone could eat that as an appetizer and still order food.

2007-04-23,3.0,"The restaurant itself is very well decorated, kind of makes me feel like I am in a rich aunt's dining room.  The chalkboard with the preparations for the day is a nice touch as well.  However, I found that the overall experience was lacking and the restaurant definitely needs some fine tuning.  It is loud, they definitely need some curtains or another way to reduce the volume, it made it very difficult to hear the server several times.  The macaroni and cheese and the Tuna Tataki were fantastic, yet the hanger steak was a bit chewy and was quite a disappointment.  I also didn't care for the waiting area in the back, seemed as if they could have put a little more care into the design back there.  All in all, I give it a 3 stars and most likely would not go back, as there are plenty of better choices in the area.",0.9293,0.768,0.163,0.069,0.5023809523809524
2007-04-16,3.0,Beautiful atmosphere and great service. Many dishes were absolutely perfect while others fell short. Do not miss the mac & cheese - it is to die for. I would go back just for the cherry chili ice cream that sat on top of the chocolate bread pudding. I want to go back and give it another try in the future.,0.8919,0.706,0.238,0.056,0.46388888888888885
2007-04-02,3.0,"**Three and three quarter stars** Tried this on the suggestion of fellow Yelpers and was not disappointed.  I don't quite follow the RAVE reviews, but I enjoyed my meal and the interior decor very much.  Our server was amazing - friendly, knowledgable, available and not obtrusive.  She was really great. We had a red wine blend from South Africa that was really quite yummy - we were all impressed as none of us had tried it before. The smoked mac n' cheese?  I wasn't sure at first bite, but by bite #3 I was officially smitten.  It was a bit like glue in my mouth because of all the cheese, but man, it was tasty.  I could only eat half of it knowing I had a full entree coming so you may want to consider sharing. The - and let's not mince words - grilled cheese and tomato soup was also delish, if a little overpowered by the truffle oil. The fish special - a yummy sounding striped bass in a lemongrass broth with scallops and blue cheese ravioli sounded much better than it actually was according to one of my lovely dining companions that ordered it. I had the pork loin which was an interesting medley of flavors.  The pork loin was done medium (not for those of you that don't like pink pig meat) and was nicely spicy.  The apple & corn whatever had a strong apple flavor, and the potato & celery salad was another very distinct taste sensation, and a nice cool contrast to the warm pork and corn/apple thing.  I'm not quite sure if I followed how everything was supposed to blend, but they did work well together - harmonius, while maintaining very distinct flavors. The bread pudding of the day (it changes) was a strawberry shortcake version that was nothing short of heaven.  I'm so glad we ordered it.  The chocolate pot de creme was excellent - silky smooth and chocolatey, with a fun kick from the cayenne pepper. I definitely recommend the food, I think the mac n'cheese and the desserts will go on to haunt me, but the entrees weren't mind blowing.",0.9985,0.718,0.253,0.029,0.562435254803676

Update: Friday 3/30/2007 Just got back from Chalkboard where me and my extra special lady were trying to enjoy this wonderful food.  BUT! The place has Horrible acoustics when full of people.  Not slightly loud not well it's just really busy loud, OUTRAGEOUSLY ANNOYINGLY PLEASE PUT MY FOOD IN A TOGO BAG AND GET ME OUT OF HERE LOUD.  I could not hear one thing my lady was saying nor could she hear me. Even the servers were having a hard time.  Yes that's right this 114.00 meal (that's without tip) was taken home mid meal just to get away from the noise.  Because of this I am dropping it from a 5 star to a 3.5.  I still think this place has awesome service and excellent food but trying to enjoy that with the decibel level of an aircraft engine is ridiculous and frustrating.  After our meals were wrapped to go we walked down the street to The Wild Goose a sports bar with twice the number of patrons and popped in just to compare the sound level.  Less than half as loud.  I kid you not Yelpers my ears are literally ringing.   So does this mean I'm done with Chalkboard, no. Does this mean i think you should stay away, no. This means Think about trying this place other than a Friday  And to the good people from the Chalkboard if you read this as i know from some of you I am not the only one complaining about this PLEASE PLEASE soften those edges and put up some curtains to absorb some of the sound no one enjoys eating in a Tin Drum.

2007-03-26,4.0,"OVERALL, I thought this was a nice place for a special occasion meal, whether it be a date, girls' night out, or even a business dinner.  It's not a dress-up place, but you might feel a little out of place in shorts or raggedy old jeans.  Food was very good, although a bit expensive.  We went on a Friday night, and it was not overly-crowded (however, I do recommend reservations). DECOR:  What a cute place!  The outside has a very casual look, but when you step inside, it's really quite cute and stylish inside with its French country decor.  A lot of mirrors and a giant chalkboard to showcase (don't worry, almost everything on the chalkboard is on the menu they hand you).  Hostesses were very pleasant, and there were quite a few people there.  The only complaint I have is soundproofing.  It is super loud in there.  There was a group of 4 women next to us who were a bit inebriated and their voices carried so loudly, as did another group behind us who appeared to be having a vivacious debate.    FOOD:  Really good.  I was disappointed that Kobe Beef was not on the menu when we were there, but I tried their Southern Fried Chicken special and it was to die for.  One friend ate steak, which he said was decent, and the other friend ate pork tenderloins which he raved about.  We had the smoky mac-n-cheese appetizer which was really tasty.  Dessert was the bread pudding and the chocolate au creme -- both 2 happy thumbs up. SERVICE:  We had a really nice waiter, but I'm afraid he was a bit overloaded.  We didn't see him all that much, and we constantly had to flag him down for beverages and for the check.  We didn't penalize him tip-wise, as it seems he was covering quite a few tables, but it still affected our experience as we felt like we were waiting a lot.",0.996,0.758,0.202,0.04,0.5693182743182743
2007-03-23,4.0,"I really enjoyed Chalkboard... my favorite part about this restaurant was the ambiance. The decoration is very classy and antique feeling yet comfortable. The food was very good, however, I was a little disappointed because they were out of a few things- one being the beef which I wanted to order. The desert was amazing- I ordered the cookie dough egg roll which I highly recommend leaving enough room for! The service is very good, but they do get very busy so be sure to make a reservation.",0.9436,0.743,0.236,0.021,0.6877777777777778

The huge chalkboard adds a modern touch and the chandeliers/mirror provide an antique touch.  A color palette of muted green and white is reminiscent of Restoration Hardware and Martha Stewart...I am sure that sounds peculiar, but see if you don't agree! The New American menu offers a few favorites from the chefs days at Rushmore...grilled cheese and tomato soup app + fried chicken entree.  Although a big fan of the former at Rushmore, the sandwich was a bit greasy this time around.

2007-03-01,5.0,"What a lovely restaurant.  I went here for dinner last night.  It was Wednesday, so I didn't make a reservation, but had I wanted to eat at 7:30 or 8:00 I might have wanted to.  We arrived at around 8:30, right before the room flipped and several tables cleared out.  The host informed us that it would be a 30 minute wait.  We were in no rush so we made our way back to the ""lounge,"" which is this quaint little nook at the back of the restaurant.  I say ""nook,"" but you could still seat 10 people back there.  This allowed me time to take in the gorgeous decor of the space.  Soft lighting, chandeliers from the ceiling, mirrors on the wall, and, of course, a large wall covered with a chalkboard with the menu written on it.  The feel is sort of French countryside.  It is a small-to-medium sized space, but the decor makes it feel larger.  A romantic space. We waited all of 10-15 minutes and then a table was ready for us.   We sat down and, after having glanced at the wonderfully selected wine list, chose a nice California Central Coast Syrah.  James was our waiter and he took great care of us.  He was around and available, but never hovered over our table.  Attentive. Now here comes the best part...the food.  It was delicious.  The idea is sort of a gourmet comfort food feel.  My boyfriend had fried chicken of all things, but it was still presented as though it was a fine cut of lamb or duck, or anything else you can think of when you think of gourmet.  I had the Hawaiian Hebi fish, which came highly recommended by James and was delicious. I had not had this fish before, but James described it as like a red snapper/swordfish.  I was disappointed that they ran out of the mussels that were supposed to be included with my entree, but it was still a wonderful blend of tastes.  (They had a bouillabaisse on the menu last night, which is likely where all of the clams and mussels went...It looked yummy too!)   We also had the arugula salad, which was also tasty with crumbled goat cheese, beets, and toasted figs.  Yum! I cannot speak to the dessert...I was WAY too full.  I guess I will have to go back, sacrificing again in the name of Yelp, to try some dessert.   Definitely a wonderful experience.  A lot of care has gone into making sure the details of the room and the food are perfect.  I will certainly go back to enjoy some of the other dishes on the menu.",0.9984,0.781,0.2,0.019,0.5131804103755323

2007-01-24,5.0,"Friends of mine recently opened a new restaurant.  The address numbers are solar powered, the food organic where it can be, purchased fresh every day with a staple of some goods and aged goods, but all things prepared to order with an ever changing menu due to the availability of items.  Thusly it is named Chalkboard, for the menu is written daily with the imagination of chef Gil Langlois.  He is a gifted artist with experience at The Room and Rushmore among other restaurants.  In addition to opening his own restaurant, he and his wife Elizabeth also recently had their 1st baby.  I was honored to be a guest at their local wedding celebration a couple of years ago, where in lieu of gifts they asked for donations to be made to organizations that would help facilitate the availability of marriage to all.  I did not know them as well then, but the more I get to know them, the more i know that these are people who should succeed, who should be rewarded for the good work and good thoughts behind their actions.  The ambiance is elegant and the food outstanding.  The wait staff was broken in by the restaurants 1st significant party of 28 disorderly agents and talent industry professionals who left sated and happy after stuffing themselves silly, breaking glasses and lighting a small fire on their table.  (Gil:  Sorry about that!  Please let me back in.)  After that, they are ready for you.",0.9955,0.743,0.227,0.03,0.5344276094276095
2007-01-14,4.0,"A beautiful chandelier accents the French country inspired room, while black chalkboards mimic the menu lining the main wall. Surprisingly full for a Sunday evening, the patrons consisted of older couples and families with children. Our very friendly and informative waiter offered us great suggestions for dinner. I did notice that the pricing per glass of wine was missing on the wine list, so I had to ask the waiter if they carried wine by the glass, which they did. I ordered a glass of Shiraz, and was pleasantly surprised. In any case, I had a salad with poached eggs and what looked like a vegetarian potpie sitting on a bed of peas dressed in a curried sauce. The crust of the potpie was flaky and buttery, which I love. We also ordered a side of Mac & Cheesed made with smoked Gouda. I could picture myself craving this dish in the future. There are a few kinks that need to be worked out (it took a while to receive our entrees), but Chalkboard had only been open for eleven days at that point. The total cost of dinner, consisting of two glasses of wine, two salads, and two entrees ended up costing around $75.00 without tip.",0.9216,0.898,0.094,0.008,0.5046875
2007-01-04,4.0,"This place just opened. I had a good experience here - very happy - would definitely go back. It's on the upscale side, with real tablecloths & cloth napkins, nice silverware, balloon wineglasses already set on the table. The decor is pretty, including a large chalkboard on one wall that lists the menu items. Service was speedy & attentive, but the waiter noticeably had a cold - Dude, there are medicines for that... Complimentary coat check. Street parking was easy, but I went early.  I went there at opening time (4:30) with a four-year-old, walked in and saw all the glassware and had a sinking feeling, picturing stuff falling on the floor. Then lots of other people came in with children. Then owner/chef Gilbert Langlois' wife came in with their four-month-old. I can't say why, but it was the most incredibly well-behaved, quiet group of children I've ever seen in a restaurant. Somehow, it worked. That said, it's not really a great place to take kids, with the table covered with fine glassware and no extra space for kids to bounce around. I doubt that there will usually be that many children there, especially later in the evening. I was told that the restaurant is vegetarian - it's not, but they do make a point of buying good agricultural practices. I had wild-caught salmon with a corn/onion underlayment, and my date had New Zealand organic beef with what I think was some sort of miniature zucchini, but she thought it was okra. Anyway. Both were delicious. The portions were normal, I think, for an upper-scale place, which I prefer. Had I gone to Leona's, it would have been two to three times the volume of food, which I've come to view as annoying. Much better to do good quality food (which Chalkboard did) than try to make up the faults on volume (as Leona's). The first wine we got was Knife & Fork (?) a very thin, flat flavor - not worth carrying. The second wine had a lot more depth, but I could smell Cascade on the glass, which was a little jarring next to the taste of the wine. I could have used a little more oenophilic advice from a more confident waiter. Two entrees plus three glasses of wine and two espressos came to just under $75, to which I added a $20 tip.",0.9638,0.837,0.107,0.055,0.5284500052792737
