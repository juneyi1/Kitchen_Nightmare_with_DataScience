2016-06-18,2.0,"So we ran into Johnny O'Hagan's as we were leaving the Cub's game.  They have a nice patio with beautiful flowers and an interesting street view, so we decided to give it a try.  There was live music, which was great (and a highlight of the visit), and we found a table right outside the front door on the patio.  The service was a little slow at first, but everyone that we spoke to (our server, the bartenders, and a manager) were friendly and happy to assist.    We ordered a round of beers first.  They had a special, so we tried two Blue Moon's on Tap, a can of 312 and a Samuel Adams bottle.  The tap beers were hardly cold, and got warm so quickly that we didn't even finish them.  The glasses we not filled all the way and didn't come with an orange.  We asked for cold glasses for the other two beers, and after waiting about 15 minutes for them, were given room temp. glasses. Disappointing.     The menu was small, but we were hopeful that the food would be good.  Overall, very disappointing.  The Ruben ($12)  had cold bread, so little meat it didn't cover the bread with even one layer, and the meat was very fatty.  Unfortunately, the worst Ruben I have ever had.  The fries were served in a cute metal basket, but were lacking in the flavor department.  The Mac and Cheese ($12) , while hot, was only mediocre in flavor and texture.  The Cheeseburger ($13) looked good, but when we started eating it we realized that part of it was actually border-line RAW.  Ewwww!   The server was very apologetic and tried to make up for it, but at that point we had lost our appetite.  We stopped in the restroom before we left and were grossed out by the smell, all the unknown liquid that was all over the floor, and the tp everywhere.  I did speak to a manager and she assured me that she was sorry about the food (the kitchen staff is new and not prepared for the game day rush) and the bathroom (which she says should have been closed and people should only use the upstairs restrooms).  She said she would take care of it on the bill.  In the end, she took off $14.20 from the bill, so hardly made up for the totally unacceptable food, but maybe there was a break down in communication and she didn't realize the burger AND rubens were bad.  Tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.   It is a shame, because the bartenders and staff couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. But just goes to show that when a few parts of a restaurant are not good, it makes the whole experience not good.   I hate to give bad reviews, but in this case, I feel like I should warn fellow Yelpers.",0.9207,0.777,0.123,0.099,0.5891319038776667

I had a blackened chicken sandwich (which was nothing special), but I never wanted something elaborate. My girlfriend got the Chicken Pot Pie and thoroughly enjoyed it. Going on a Sunday night was pretty dead around 7ish, but the atmosphere while watching an NFL Playoff game was lively enough.  Waiter services always differ from person to person.

Been here twice for ND games, once when it was really crowded and another time when it was really dead. And I have to say, both times were VERY mediocre. Service was really poor and slow regardless of how busy they were. Our server asked us what we wanted before we even saw a drink menu. Throughout the night she would often check on one person out of our large group and then walk away. Food has also been very average. I've tried most of their appetizers and they're all pretty bland. The specials they run for the game in particular are pathetic, and way overpriced. The burger you get with the one special isn't much bigger than an oreo. I even had their chicken pot pie (which they're famous for) and wasn't impressed at all. Like a small cup of blah soup topped with a giant croissant.  Needless to say, I'm surprised by how good most of the reviews are for this place. Maybe it's much better during the week?

2015-03-17,1.0,"I wanted to have some fish n' chips on St. Patrick's Day and Blokes and Birds was closed for maintenance so I figured why not try the Irish Pub/Restaurant down the street? Bad idea. I arrived at roughly 12:20 and sat down at the bar. Front room was NOT crowded. Maybe 10 other people, total, and three others at the bar. Two bartenders working completely ignore me for a good 8 minutes. One finally comes up. I order the fish n' chips and a coke. Drink arrives. Literally no contact from either bartender until my order was up. None. No how you doing, no nothing. So my food gets here and they have ZERO idea how to cook fish n' chips. Outside is fried to a darkness a shade past the way even Long John Silver's cooks it and they overcook everything. I dig in. The inside is FULL of moisture and once the piece of cod is cut the batter and everything is soaked.  You NEVER fry frozen cod in batter. This is what will happen. The inside will be soggy and the outside will get fried. The fish wasn't undercooked but it was soaked and turned into a soggy mess. Well, crap. I soldiered through it. The fries were the only part of the meal that wasn't half bad but they were frozen, too. Don't come here if you want anything fresh, I guess. Or at least thawed. Again, NOT ONCE did either of the two bartenders check on me while I ate my meal. good thing I got water because I ran out of coke about halfway through my two soggy pieces of overfried cod.  AGAIN, it took about 8 minutes for one of the two bartenders to notice I was done and pushed my plate aside. After getting one of them to answer me I asked for the check. He brings check. Another 8 minutes until he comes back and picks it up.  I'm glad Blokes and Birds will be finished with its maintenance on Thursday because I'm never making this mistake again. p.s. I am reviewing this place as a diner, only, I'm sure the whiskey selection and everything is great that's just not what I came fore.",0.8991,0.865,0.076,0.058,0.48678160919540225

Well, I still haven't come around to aggro 22 year old bros and wasted wooo girls, but I stand corrected on my statement simply because Johnny O'Hagan's is an awesome Irish pub.  Between the food, whiskey, music, and the fact that the owners are actually from Ireland it's pretty damn authentic. In a town where so many places throw up some green shit on the walls and claim to be from the old country it's pretty cool to see them doing it the right way.  There is American fare if you've got a picky eater in your group, but I highly recommend something from the traditional section of the food menu.  There's Fish and Chips, Shepard's Pie, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and an amazing Irish breakfast that'll have you coming back to eat even when it isn't the 17th of March.  Top off your meal with some whiskey and one of the best Guinness pours in the city and you'll be hooked on O'Hagan's.

I had just moved to the city from the suburbs and my friend and I were looking around at little bars to go to.  I come from Irish ancestry so obviously I had to check out Johnny O's (which is, incidentally, 2 blocks away from my apartment.. yay!). We went there on a Tuesday night and it was EMPTY.  I don't believe this is a reflection of how the bar is, it's just because not a lot of people know about it or perhaps that people in that area tend to hangout at douchier wrigley places or maybe it was because there was a torrential downpour that day.   Take your pick. I digress, the point is, it was great. Tuesdays were $4 ciders (I think?).  The bartender was very nice and from Ireland!  The interior of the bar is very cozy and lovely.  There's a fireplace too!   My friend and I both ordered the potato leek soup and shared curry fries.  Both of these items were DELICIOUS.   Also, as we were leaving, musicians were coming in to perform.  I'm guessing they have live music weekly!  (psst... Johnny O's... get that website goin!) :) I'm obviously going to go back soon.  Maybe on a busier night.  For now though, please check it out!  It's probably not going to be an ideal bar for early twenties people, but for those of us mid-twentiers who are over the bar scene, this is probably the place for us.

Our waitress was great--very friendly, attentive, plus she had the most adorable Irish accent.  She split our bill out from our party without us even asking when we decided to leave before everyone else.  I have been to much more expensive places and had service that was nowhere near as professional.  Kudos to her.  By the way, prices for everything were very reasonable, I thought.  And the place is clean.  Yay.  They have a welcoming fireplace in the back, which would be cozy on a winter night. I used to live very close by but would basically never hang out in Wrigleyville because I don't really care for the typical rowdy party scene.  But O'Hagan's was pretty chill that night, so I had a nice time.  I heard it was an off night, though, and that it usually gets packed to the rafters on a Saturday night.  Guess I got lucky.  :)  But if you're more into drinking with a crowd, then you may like it better on your average weekend evening.",0.9988,0.702,0.285,0.013,0.4975185185185184

I have no doubt that it was great while we were there. Someday I'll probably even go back to make sure.",0.8402,0.714,0.194,0.092,0.4228395061728395
2014-02-16,5.0,"A small trek in the snow has us arriving at our intended destination last night. The new Johnny O'Hagans. I never visited this spot before it recently reopened, but from what I've heard, the inside looks about the same.  I have to say that my first thought was 'wow!'  The area right around here skews a bit young and rowdy and it's really nice to walk into a calm, really cozy spot that's a bit more sophisticated.  We scored a great table in the corner (slightly raised spot, table for two near the fireplace).  It was so nice to be toasty inside while it was snowy and cold outside.  The restaurant/bar isn't huge, but it's nicely laid out and the bar itself is really pretty. I was happy to find a table as I really wanted to try their food.  Our server was really nice.  I picked the grilled chicken sandwich (I was going to try the fish and chips but was trying to lay off the fried food).  The sandwich was delicious - perfectly cooked and moist chicken with onions, avocado, and a wonderful bun. I also really enjoyed the blue cheese coleslaw and some fries.  I also had a few bites of the Irish Breakfast entree - also tasty and deemed quite good by someone who lived in Ireland for a year. I thought the sausage was really good and the egg was perfectly runny. Both entrees were well priced.  I am told that the Guinness was a perfect pour and wonderful. I skew towards wine (great list, reasonably priced), and was happy with my choice. I should have had a Harp, though, now that I'm thinking about it! All in all, this was a really enjoyable spot for dinner and I will definitely plan on returning. Great Irish pub in the city! Far exceeds most of the other nearby bars pretending to be pubs.

2014-02-08,5.0,"My friend and I were looking for a drink and a bite to eat after work on a Tuesday evening and decided to stop at Johnny O'Hagan's. I understand it recently re-opened with new owners. I don't know what it was like before, but it is beautiful inside now--very nice bar, TVs. It was early so we were able to grab the table by the fireplace. Perfect. Jason took care of us. No blue cheese olives in the house? No problem- he offered to make them! We tried the crab cake appetizer and the blue cheese burger. Both were delicious. Service was great. We will definitely be back.",0.9835,0.652,0.269,0.079,0.5482954545454545
2014-01-29,5.0,"This place is the best Irish pub in town. The new owners have done a great job reopening the place. Great place to have a Guinness on a winter night, next to the fireplace in the back. The food is absolutely amazing. I started off with the crab cakes and paired it with the Upper cup Sauvignon Blanc as the waitress kindly suggested. Next, I went with the O'Hagan's burger and it was to die for. My buddy got the Gaelic steak and it was definitely worth the investment. The environment is unmatched by any of the surrounding bars in Wrigleyville. I plan to make this my regular go to bar.",0.9643,0.765,0.194,0.041,0.32549757934373313
