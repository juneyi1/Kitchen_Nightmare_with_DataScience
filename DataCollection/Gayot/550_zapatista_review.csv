The service was horrible and even rude at times. Our margaritas never appeared-- we had appetizers and our main courses without drinks, and we asked multiple times! They finally arrived and were not worth the wait, kinda watery. My sister's chicken tacos were undercooked and pink. When we got the check, we were surprised to find a couple items were charged as a few dollars more expensive than the listed menu prices. Our waiter said that ""the menu had changed"" and the prices were different. We told him we were only going to pay the prices as advertised and he got really pissy after that. He corrected the prices but my friend later found an extra $5 worth of tip on her credit card bill. That's fraud! She later called to complain (and had to make several attempts to get through) only to be told by a sleazy dude to ""come back sometime with [her] husband"" and the restaurant would ""take really good care"" of them.

Seems to me like many tables are trying to get their servers attention for checks, more chips, making orders, etc, but they are off the floors making guac instead. Not to mention, the guac isn't even consistent! Last time I went, it was way too salty. Probably because your server was stretched too thin and overlooked putting in too much salt.

The last time, I ate at Zapatistas we ordered a couple appetizers, two entrees, dessert and several rounds of drinks (more like three). The waitress continuously asked, would you like another round and we said yes. After the third or maybe fourth round we decided to have some water.  She filled our water once and the next time she walked over to the table she asked if we wanted more drinks, we both agreed that we just wanted water. When she arrived back at the table she brought the check as if she was kicking us out! We drank our water and quietly talked and they started clearing the table while we were sitting there and resetting it. OMG, we spent almost $200 and we couldn't have a couple glasses of water at the table? Once you are done ordering they won't have any lingering around regardless of how well you tipped or how high your bill was.  No doubt it's a nice looking place, with good food, but the service was lacking. Zapastista's, if you want repeat customers you don't decide when they leave. Your waitresses shouldn't bring the bill without being asked for it and your bus boys can't reset the table with people sitting there.

2014-05-25,2.0,"During the summer months, Ive seen Zapatista  packed with el fresco diners. The continual crowds made me think that this place may be a decent restaurant to grab a bite so I put it on my list of places to try. Yesterday afternoon I finally stopped in for my first dining experience and needless to say I was disappointed.   1st disappointment was that the chicken and goat cheese empanadas appetizer were not available. Ive been to higher end restaurants in which certain dishes were not available so I can understand this issue if the food is relatively exclusive. However, empanadas are made of relatively common ingredients so it was odd to me that they were not being served. I ordered the chicken tamales instead which were served with a mole' sauce that tasted as if it came out the jar. Not a good sign.  2nd disappointment were the drinks. My husband and I ordered the Le Senorita which is a mix of frozen margarita and sangria. I am biased to Uncle Julio's version of this drink but I wanted to give Zapatista a chance. Two words....hated it. :( The drink was served as mostly sangria/wine with a scoop of frozen margarita on top. The presentation of the drink was unappealing and the flavor did nothing for my taste buds. The sangria didn't really taste like a traditional sangria and was more of a dry and flat red wine. The ""sangria"" ruined the drink for me so I returned the drink and requested just a frozen margarita instead.  The margarita itself was relatively tasteless and seemed to be void of any tequilla. So my hopes of getting my afternoon ""drink on"" at this place were destroyed. 3rd disappointment was the service. Basically the service was non-existent. The hostess was ""blah"" and not very welcoming. My waitress obviously does not understand the idea of hospitality or customer service. We might as well had a mute robot take our order because she didn't smile and I only heard a whisper of her voice. I'm serious when I say, I heard her speak like 5 words in the hour+ time we were there. These words included the phrase ""we dont have that"" and ""ok"". When she came to the table she just stood there. No ""are you all ready to order"" opening statement. Just stood there with her pen and pad in hand. It was actually kind of freaky now that I reflect on it. :/ Each time I needed something I had to flag her down because her making a voluntary visit to the table was not happening.There were only about 15 patrons in the restaurant so her lack of attentiveness was not due to it being a busy afternoon and even then a lot of activity would not be an excuse for poor service. When we left, we walked right past her and she looked past us as if we were invisible. She is obviously not a people person. Instead of leaving the normal 20%+ tip, we barely gave her 15% but I honestly didn't want to give her that.  Now, the food entrees were average. The steak tacos were tasty. My husband had a steak burrito which was also tasty. Again, the food was average but factoring in the price point it fell below average. So my experience with Zapatista came and went. My try for the first time will definitely also be the last time. I'm now confused to why people pile into this place because the food and service definitely lack luster.",-0.9812,0.834,0.059,0.108,0.48730158730158724

We're probably just a little spoiled, right?  Whatever it is, I left Zapatista thinking that if not for neighborhood traffic, a place like this closes. Let me explain.... We went to Zapatista the other night for my good friend's girlfriend's birthday.  As a large party of 10 I will give them a huge thumbs up in that they had the table ready early and were incredibly accommodating about seating us 30 minutes before the rest of our party arrived.  Our waiter was there right away, made suggestions and was fast about everything.  For this category of restaurant, a 5 in service. The problem for me started with our first round of drinks, the Ultima Margarita on the rocks at our waiter's suggestion.  Hello sugary store bought Margarita taste. Again, maybe I'm a little spoiled from places like Mercadito that for the same price throw down a margarita with fruit that tastes like the bartender just went out and hand picked, but our drinks were for sure lacking.  Same deal with the ""Million de Dolares"" we ordered next.  There is a Jewel across the street...maybe someone was hitting up their liquor section for Cuervo sour mix? For an appetizer once everyone arrived we ended up ordering the Queso Fundido.  As I've found a lot of girls do, my fiancé has a pretty legitimate cheese infatuation, so we've ordered this dish a time or two.  I wouldn't be exaggerating to say the dish came in a pool of oil, to the point where you had to dig into it, get a scoop of chihuahua cheese and then shake it to try and get as much grease off as you could. Really, it looked like those that ordered the fajitas for a main dish had the same issue. For a main dish I had the Camarones Barachos and Caitlin an order of fish tacos (fried tilapia I think?).  The coconut rice with my dish was a nice touch and the shrimp were fine, but nothing to write home about. Caitlin left with a similar impression of her tacos and I didn't really get the impression that anyone at our table absolutely loved their meal. Verdict... Service: 5 Drinks: 2 Food: 2 Value: 2 Overall: 2 I'm not going to 1 star the place but I really don't see coming back with so many other options that are worlds better.",0.9944,0.853,0.138,0.008,0.39190307328605206

I love fried plantains but it seemed to me like these were made in a great hurry because the middle was still crunchy as if they hadn't been in hot oil long enough. At the same time, they were oilier than plantains usually are as if they weren't allowed to sit long enough to let some oil leave. The fish tacos were pretty good, you get a massive hunk of fish which is fried to perfection, delicioius and crispy, must've been someone else frying the plantains. The fish was the best part of the meal without a doubt. There was a bit too much cabbage for my liking and it could've used some extra sauce.

If you are lucky to get a seat outside, go for it.  Because inside its cramped with seating as tables are literally right next to each other.  At least outside you can enjoy the weather versus sitting in a dark setting all day. Drinks were okay.  Much like the food its over priced.  Nothing to rave about.  The only thing saving this from a lower rating is their lunch specials.  They have days where its dollar tacos (with drink purchase I believe) so if its your first time visiting, I'd recommend going during lunch.  Definitely avoid during dinner on weekends as its likely a wait to be seated in an already cramped environment.  2.5 stars but with the lunch specials, I'll give it a 3.",0.9732,0.822,0.151,0.027,0.4250915750915751

Plus I didn't like that when our food arrived the runner held our dishes and Waited for US to move the appetizer plates and empty cheese bowl.   Food was alright, I liked the queso fundito more than other places bc of the peppers and spices.

I got the enchiladas with spicy fries which made it a very filling meal. My friend got a burrito which was significantly less impressive. It was pretty expensive burrito but wasn't anything special compared to the food you can get a cheap taqueria. Also, as an out-of-towner, I had no idea you can't park on State Street during a Bears game, and the area I parked happened to have that sign hidden behind a tree instead of with other parking restriction signs. I ended up getting a parking ticket within five minutes of parking so I moved to another area. I was rather annoyed about this so I hoped that the Chargers would demolish the Bears in the preseason game. While that wasn't the case, at least I watched the Chargers score a touchdown on them during my meal on one of the many screens in the restaurant. The downside of this place is the service. The wait staff doesn't seem to pay much attention to the non-regulars, or anyone who they weren't assigned to. My waiter got caught up in conversation for at least five minutes with someone he knew, so I got the attention of a waitress who was passing by and asked for the bill. She looked kinda confused, and then went over to my waiter, waited another two minutes for him to finish talking, then told him I was waiting for my bill. I also noticed that the bartender paid no attention to a lot of the seats at the bar, and just chatted with a group of four he knew pretty well for most of the time I was there. I guess the experience would be a lot better if you got to sit outside in the evening, where you can get a good view of the skyscrapers downtown.",0.8609,0.847,0.092,0.061,0.49527914614121515

Already being disappointed I figured I would just order a bottled beer since that would be impossible to screw up.  They even managed to screw it up too!  The beer was warm.  At this point I was fed up and asked them for another beer.  My friend ordered a glass of sangria and it tasted awful.  I tried a sip and it tasted like they used too much alcohol and it was bitter.

Here's a tip: try assigning tables/sections to servers so everyone knows what they're responsible for and aren't bothering customers. If you already have that system in place God help you, needs some tweaking.

The food itself tasted pretty good, in terms of taste, but my enchilada was only lukewarm in the middle and the tortilla was either old or overcooked on the ends to the point it was tough and inedible.  My girlfriend had a cold shrimp as well.

The service was a nightmare from the start.  The waiter brought me some flat coke.  When I told him he took it back and came back saying both Coke / Diet Coke machines were out, but other drinks were OK.  So I asked for a Sprite.  Waited... waited... asked again.  Then he said, he decided to wait because maybe they could fix the Coke fountain.  So I'm like, well bring me the Sprite in the meantime, at least I can start with something.  Still nothing... at the end of the day, he says now all of them are not working and they can't be fixed.  Can you imagine?  A big restaurant like that with no Coke or anything else?  If you're out of something as basic as that, then get off your arse to go buy a 24-pack. While ordering food, I was asking for substitution options since I'm vegetarian.  He was being sort of rigid.  Eventually, he agreed to fix us up a couple of things.  The Chile Rellenitos appetizer was decent, but really tiny portion for the price.  The mains were quite highly priced and nothing was great. Queso Enchiladas - the cheese tasted good, but the corn tortillas were tough.  The sauce was good.  Overall.. just OK. Tostadas - The tostadas looked great, but tasted very meh... I can't place my finger on what was amiss, but they were just very average.  I think overall, the beans had some flavor.  The tostada just didn't come together. Kids Tacos - It was a simple ask, to just make the tacos and substitute beans instead of beef.  The tacos came out with just a shell with melted cheese.  After pointing that out, they apologized and switched them out.  Looks like they took the same type of taco and threw some lettuce and tomatoes on there.  Didn't look very appealing. The kids meal was supposed to come with lemonade.  So we explicitly had to remind the waiter about that.  Then he brings out the ""lemonade"" and it turned out to be just water with some lime in it.  Upon asking again, then he says even the lemonade is not available.  I already mentioned the on-going ordeal I was having in trying to get a glass of Coke.  Again, he didn't offer anything as an alternative.  I asked if they had any other juices and he said they did have Orange Juice.  OK well... why not at least offer than alternative?  This guy was completely oblivious to his job.  Seemed like a nice guy, but he was in way over his head.  So eventually that OJ came out. After eating, then again we had to wave someone down to call upon the waiter.  We reminded him that the kids meal comes with ice cream.  He's like, ""oh yeah"".  10 minutes later we have the ice cream. So much waiting...  so much prodding.  I felt like a dentist pulling teeth at this place.  BTW, it wasn't just us.  The table next to us complained and called the manager.  They weren't given silverware for 5 minutes after their food came out.  then the fish the guy was having was under-cooked and he sent it back.  The waiter took it back without offering anything in return.  Glad he called the manager - with such lousy service maybe I should've done the same. With prices for entrees at $13-$15 range, this level of non-sense service is unacceptable.  I will not be back and I don't recommend Zapatista to anyone else who is actually looking for a pleasant Mexican dining experience.",0.9903,0.845,0.107,0.048,0.3908815192743763

We parked up the street after driving past Zapatista's a few times. I'm so used to having ample amount of parking or valet. Luckily, we only had to walk a few blocks.  We walked in the front door and this place is definitely set up of more of a hang out spot. It's more upscale than your normal Mexican restaurant. Two sides split and then it had the patio area. We ended up outside and loved the view from there.  The husband and I like to try things that we usually don't see at your restaurants that you are frequent at. So he ordered a Victoria beer with shot of tequila inside it. There isn't many places in general that have Victoria beer back home. I ordered a margarita with a shot of chile jalapeno..... Yi Yi Yi!! Muy caliente! I was so excited when I seen they had chicken tinga on their menu. That is in my last meal on earth that I would have to have before I died. Oh it's so full of flavor with onions and cilantro! I ordered the Tinga Tacos with Mexican Rice.  My husband ordered the Carne Asada Burrito with Fire roasted Habanero sauce. He said it had quite the zing, but it wasn't TOO hot.... I'll take his word for it.  I do have to say our server was really slow. We were there over an hour and with an 18 month old that can be awful for us and anyone in a mile radius! They were super busy though and because of the set up of the restaurant I'm not sure how many tables the girl had.  I would definitely go back if I was in this area of Chicago.",0.8481,0.888,0.069,0.044,0.4697712418300653

When I am sitting at a table thinking - I could get better service at The Scout there has to be something wrong with the place. I've even overlooked some oh-no-no's in the past and still gone with Zapatista. For instance, sometime this fall my mother ordered their veggie enchiladas and there was sand in it. Yes, the offense that has been the downfall of many Top Chef contestants. When my mom complained they sort of just shrugged and offered a different option for her. Note: they didn't comp her meal and I was angry. I swore off Zapatista forever after that. Then one winter night I was craving Mexican and I didn't want to venture far. I met up with some friends at Zapatista and had a wonderful meal and experience. Zapatista won me back over and then after another successful meal with a date I was convinced that the night my mom and I went must have just been a one off. Then last night happened. Our orders were wrong, it took 20 minutes to get water, and I was served some suspicious ceviche. Quite possibly the most unpleasant dining experience of my entire life.

Also it's impossible to hear the person sitting directly across from you when it's busy... But the quality of food and service semi makes up for the lack of conversation due to the atmosphere...

Then I spoke to the manager who confirmed that they were, indeed, cross-contaminated (fried in shared oil). Then when I ordered from their ""gluten-free"" menu, I was warned that one of the entrees on there was not gluten-free. I was also warned that the sides of french fries AND rice were not safe, either. I asked them why they hadn't corrected their menu yet. The manager said that they would do that ""soon."" I filled out a complaint form and warned them that they may not be so lucky with someone else who has a gluten problem in the future. Lesson learned: just because a restaurant has a ""gluten-free"" menu, don't assume they are anymore informed about the gluten-free diet than any other restaurant. Always be skeptical and don't take anything for granted. So, you may want to avoid this restaurant that has a ""gluten-free"" menu and is listed in many gluten-free sites as a safe place to eat.

2013-02-08,3.0,"Definitely not my first time here, but I ""checked in"" so I supposed I'll write a review. =) The food here is good. I had the carne asada burrito and it was massive. I only ate half of it, so yup, I have lunch for today now too. My very own 2-for-1 special... I'll take it! Speaking of specials... sadly their website and reality in the restaurant offerings aren't in sync. Thursday is still ladies night. However, the special has changed. Online it still says $5 Mexican Limonadas, but they recently (a few months at least) changed that to a $9 half-sized guacamole and margarita special. Our server explained the change but since it was still on the website he asked his manager and she agreed to give us the $5 drink special. That was the right thing to do so I'm happy that worked out with no fuss. More on the food... I was not a fan of the spicy fries at all. I tasted two but that was it. No mas. I'm rarely a dessert person but the Platanos Estilo Foster sounded  yummy. It was basically their take on bananas foster. I had never had either but it sounded good. AND once we realized it was the same dessert that had the awesome presentation and flames going we were more excited to try it. So the presentation of preparing it for us at our table was great, but the actual dish was so-so. I frankly don't like my ice cream to be soupy (due to the fire), so as soon as that flamed out it was a lackluster dessert. The plantains were sweet and well-made but I didn't want to eat much of the dish. I'm glad I tried it though. Why not? Overall the food was about 4 stars. I enjoy it. Again, this wasn't my first or last time here. The service, on the other hand, I have mixed reviews about. Everyone was very nice and pleasant, from the man you seated us, to our server, to the guy who refilled our water, to the guys who helped me find my earring that came out. HOWEVER (yes in capital letters), they were sooooo impatient. If I asked our server a question, he would answer it and turn his heels ready to walk away without waiting to see if there was more to it or if my friend needed something too. For example, we initially got two glasses of water before ordering and I asked for lemon in mine. It came with none, no problem so I ask for it again AND was trying to also ask for straws... too late, the man ran off already. Dang. So then the lemons come and I ask for straws but we're also ready to order but nope, he runs off again. Geez! So next we get the whole drink special thing situated and He's about to leave again... no sir, please wait, we want to order our food now too. Man, who wants to deal with such a lengthy process of just ordering our food, drinks and lemon-water?? LOL. Needless to say, this touch and go continued up until it was time to pay the bill. And to be clear, no, they weren't super busy so no that wasn't why our server felt rushed to leave our table so quickly. All I can attribute it to was his lack of patience. That's it.

Starting with drinks, we both had the Cucumber Margarita that was served over ice.  It was a little on the sweet side for my taste, but still refreshing. I didn't really get the taste of the tequila, so it was a mild margarita.    For dinner I went with one of my favorites, Al Pastor, on the menu under Taco Especiales.  The flavors were actually pretty good. My only complaint would be the pork wasn't as moist and tender as it should have been.  I do wish the tortillas had been fresher.  As for the sides, the Mexican rice was simply dry and not flavorful at all, but the black beans on the other hand were quite good, could have had a little more spice, maybe something like fresh pico and/or sour cream to top the bowl.      Overall, I like Zapatista, the service was warm, inviting, and helpful.  The food while not bad, could be better.  For Mexican cuisine, I was expecting more spice, not heat, and bolder flavors, but it's some place I'd return.  Next time, I'll move around on the menu a little.",0.9958,0.729,0.252,0.019,0.48958333333333326

Walking in with a large group was no problem for the space (let it be known that separate checks aren't quite offered). Half my group gladly went for the endless fish tacos deal before even taking a seat. I decided on my usual standby for Mexican restaurants, chile relleno, while witnessing bowl after bowl of fish, cabbage slaw, rice, beans, spicy salsa, and tortillas being brought over to our table for my eager compatriots. My friend seated next to me, thankfully, got some beef enchiladas, so overall there was a nice mix around the table. Chile relleno was decent, rice and beans also decent. Not too bad. The fish tacos with the slaw were also fairly decent, but the spicy salsa with the fish tacos made them quite tasty. The overall service experience was decent. A few times servers had to be flagged down to bring over more tortillas or salsa, but they waaay more than enough endless fish for everyone.

I requested to see the manager. 10 minutes later, the manager Mercedes appeared and said ""I heard you were looking for me""... Excuse me? I'm a patron of your establishment who has a complaint that you're aware of... OF COURSE I'm looking for you. Better yet, as a manager and as a part of your job, you should be looking for me, brainiac! Mercedes had a very condescending and accusatory attitude, and was lacking some major management qualities. Not once did we receive an apology or acknowledgement of the issue...She explained to us that once again, we CHOSE to sit outside, and it's not her problem that there's construction next door.

I had the motulenos which consisted of two eggs on top of a tostada and refried black beans with a sweet mole sauce (forming an oddly incongruent combination of flavors), sweet plantains, bacon, and hash browns. For five bucks. Essentially nothing else that my table ordered was above mediocre. This includes fish tacos, quesadillas and a salad. At dinner I tried the white fish and raspberry ceviche. It was pretty good and unique, but not shockingly so. My companion had disappointing steak tacos. The place was absolutely packed on a Friday night and very loud inside.

They were soft until they were warm, but once cold, it was chewy and turned plastic. After a while, my teeth starting hurting biting in to them.

The chips were made in-house, as are all of their corn tortillas, which I appreciate, however, I thought they were on the thick-side and needed salt. We ordered a side of their fried plantains to start, I was expecting tostones, my favorite, but instead it was the more common sweet plantains. They were actually very good, although I still prefer the former. For my entree, I had their ceviche special, which was a mix of shrimp and crab cooked in lime juice, served with guacamole and pico de gallo, as well as a side of rice and beans. The ceviche was fresh tasting and generously portioned. I had to ask for a side plate of limes, as I felt it wasn't marinated for long enough, though. My boyfriend ordered their cheese enchiladas, a seemingly basic entree, but oh my, these were amazing! I loved how they were not overstuffed with cheese (as I don't really care for cheese that much), and the salsa verde they were covered in was to die for.

The carnitas tacos was very juicy and tasty, the carne asada was flavorful, and the tilapia was just okay. Needed more seasoning.  The guacamole was pretty good but not the best I had. Adult Beverages I had the bigote which is a combo of a mojito, pina colada and sangria. It is so tasty. It tasted more like a creamy, sweet, blended mojito if you asked me. I guzzled it up like it was a shamrock shake.  I didn't taste much alcohol but it was very refreshing for an unusually warm spring day.  My friend had a pink margarita which they considered ""skinny"". This was also very tasty and sweet for a margarita on the rocks Service Boo! The service was poor. There was a 5 minute delay to get greeted at the door and to be told to seat myself at the bar. This pretty much dictated the rest of the customer service experience for the remainder of my time there. The waitress took a while for us to come to our table. Our food probably took 20+ minutes (we only ordered tacos and a small guac!). I politely asked her if she had taken our food order since she got my drink wrong the first time.  Then when we asked her for water or more chips she gave us a look like we were bothering her. Yikes! Maybe she was having an off day but this is definitely worth star deducting. The deals are pretty good. $25 for 3 tacos, guac, and 2 adult beverages is not very shabby.

2012-03-14,2.0,"Let me start off by saying...... I don't know why I went here again after my awful first experience. My dinner companion had had great margaritas here the first time she was here and she wanted to go here again. Although I hesitated I figured I would give this place another chance. It was a random Tuesday early evening, probably about 530-ish. The restaurant was pretty empty. There was no host at the host stand for a while? And no bell to ring for a host...... A few waiters walked really fast by without acknowledging us (along with other people) standing there, even though we tried to get eye contact and have them notice our existence... finally, I caught someone's eye. We were seated right after that. I am not sure about the others waiting behind us... A waiter promptly took our drink and food orders and disappeared. Food took a little bit of time (we only ordered two entrees, no apps, and one drink); it took probably 30 mins, which would be understandable if it wasn't dead in the restaurant?  The mojito I ordered was fabulous!! Our food came-- I got shrimp tacos, which were good, but I have had better and cheaper. My friend got a burrito, which she also liked. Much better than last time. But pricey for their quality. Overall, the food was decent and worked for the convenience of the location. The waiter was nice and peppy but extremely slow and hard to get a hold of. The service left something to be desired. It was just extremely slow for a time/place that wasn't busy.  I dont want to come here anymore and I will tell my companions if they suggest we go here again.

We had reservations for 7:30 but didn't need them because this place was pretty much empty. I had fairly low expectations for this place considering people didn't seem very pleased in their reviews. It will say this was better than I thought it would be, but now a whole lot better Drinks - I ordered the prickly pear margarita. I liked it because it was not overly sweet but I've definitely had better margaritas. I thought the regular margarita actually tasted less sweet even though the prickly pear was advertised as having less sugar. Appetizer - We ordered guacamole and it was your pretty standard guacamole. Good but nothing out of this world but a good mix of spices and actually enough salt for once. I feel like so many restaurants either don't salt or undersalt their guacamole. Salad - We both got the de la casa salad and it was actually really, really good. Great mix of flavors and I was kind of wishing this was my entree so I could eat it all but I only had a few bites because I needed to save room for the entree and dessert. Entree - I ordered the Tinga De Pollo enchiladas. They were good, but like I said with everything else, nothing out of the this world. They were pretty much your standard chicken enchiladas. Dessert - We ordered the Tres Leches cake which was probably the best thing I ate there. I wish more Mexican restaurants had Tres Leches cake on the menu, I usually see a flan version of it but not the cake.  If I went back I would be happy ordering the De La Casa salad and the tres leches cake for a meal.

I called and made the reservation myself and finally she found it - however, I think I would have checked every possible place before accusing me of not having a reservation.  Then the host (male) pointed to out table since we were in the back, which is very tight.... I thought we was going to follow behind.  No, We seated our selves - and the host is standing there against the service station staring at us.  We waive - no response.  My husband, gets up and goes over to him and asks ""Are we are the correct table?""... Host ""yea"", walks over with husband and then sets the menus in a stack at the edge of the table and walks away.  (Husband and I looking as each other  wondering what is going on)  Our waiter was okay  - but like I said above, give us guidance!  Very strange.   Personally I thought there prickly pear drink was on the weak side.  It's too bad - I can't believe they let me down for the second time!",-0.9632,0.844,0.054,0.102,0.37670866170866174

2012-01-03,2.0,"We arrived for lunch yesterday as a party of four and got an enthusiastic waiter named Gustavo. I thought we were off to a good start. We got our drinks and some guac. The chips were plentiful and good and the guacamole was tasty and made to order. Unfortunately, our entrees took FOREVER to arrive and when they did, two out of the four dishes were the wrong ones. I had ordered a lunch combo of spinach quesadillas and salad for $8.99. For that price, I got two small triangles of plain cheese quesadillas and medium-sized helping of salad. I thought it was a kid's plate. My husband had ordered a combo platter but instead of the cheese enchilladas he'd ordered, he got chicken mole. I don't know what happened-- it was not busy and our waiter had been regaling us earlier of his difficult training process to become a waiter there. I really wanted to like him but it took us several minutes to even get his attention. In other words, he didn't even come by the table to make sure our orders were correct-- we finally had to ask the busboy to flag him down. By the time we were served our meals, my parents had finished theirs. Gustavo didn't seem very concerned or apologetic. After all that wait, I was disappointed with my quesadillas. They were just like the ones I make at home-- nothing particularly exciting about them. I seemed to get more salad the second time around, so that was nice. We then waited an inordinate amount of time for our plates to be cleared and more time for Gustavo to come back to ask if we wanted dessert. My parents ordered coffee, which came immediately, and my father also ordered flan, which took well over 15 minutes to arrive and of course, they had finished their coffees by then.

The atmosphere is very hip, and of course, busy. A lot of us ordered different dishes but I'll rate what I had. We started with their tamales. It was about $8 dollars for an order of 2. I personally didn't like it. I had better tamales at other restaurants which costs less than what Zapatista charged.  As entree, I ordered the El Pastor. MM, this is yummy! I really enjoyed my tacos, although I wish it came with corn tortilla instead of flour. Two other people at my table ordered the El Pastor as well, and it was good. My fiance ordered a shrimp dish. He said it was okay, not superb. He wouldn't order it again.  The  birthday girl ordered guacamole for the table. That was okay, too. The complimentary chips and salsa was good. I really liked the hint of spice in the salsa. Pretty different than most restaurants I've been to.  Service was slow, though. We didn't get our food until 40 minutes after we ordered it. Could it be that we're a big party? Or that it's just a very busy time to eat? Not sure, but it took quite awhile to get our food after we ordered. Since it was our friend's birthday, we bought a cake to celebrate. The waiter was smart and got the cake from us right when we seated and told us he'll take care of it, which was nice. After our meals were done, the waiter brought the cake out along with a dessert. It was ice cream with plantain. We thought it was compliments of the restaurant for my friend's birthday but turned out that they charged that dessert to our tab when we got the bill. We didn't order it and we already had a cake for her, so we weren't sure why we were charged. It would be really nice if it was given to us complimentary, but we were a bit disappointed that they added to our bill ($11). I'm not sure what happened with that dish..not sure if someone on the table disputed it since we didn't order it or we just ended up paying for it.

The service was OK. Our waitress was pleasant enough but seemed confused after she came to see how our meal was (we lied and said it was fine) that our drinks had not yet arrived. It was just as well that they were late, they were as lousy as the food. The food. Oh man, the food. I really can't figure out why in Chicago, a town that has one of the largest Hispanic populations in the Northern Hemisphere, the food was just so, so, so not good. I had enchiladas that were really no more that corn tortillas rolled around some gritty steak, smeared with canned cheese and dropped on the plate. This isn't how enchiladas are made is it? I mean, as far as I know there's supposed to be some baking involved. Imagine my surprise when they tasted as truly horrible as they looked. My wife had the mahi mahi tacos. And, since I didn't dare risk trying another dish after a mouthful of mine, I'll take her word for it when she tells me that they were also classically not good. The mango (I think it was) was the only flavor that made it the cooking process as the fish had none. The drinks. Margaritas. I've had better in a can. Bland. My wife said hers was strong and tasted like alcohol whereas mine was weak and tasted mainly of ice water. I didn't order a second. The appetizer. Guacamole. Pretty spicy, and I could actually taste the avocado but it was definitely locked in mortal combat with the intense flavor of lime that pervaded the dish. The store-bought chips didn't help it out in the slightest. I've had plenty of restaurant-quality store-bought chips (El Ranchero's excellence comes to mind) but these were not up to par.  Being one that firmly believes nothing can be completely bad allow me to say that the salsa was actually good, though on second thought it was heavy on the chipotle. As were the beans. The rice however - served from an ice cream scoop - may garnish the positive attention of any children Zapatista is lucky enough to serve, but I'm an adult and a half-moon mound of Spanish rice is just a little silly at this point in my life.  I'm always on a search in Chicago for excellent Mexican food. I haven't actually found excellent yet. I've come across really freaking good, and I-might-come-back-here quality but Zapatista doesn't even measure a blip on the scale. In fact, I think I'd go as far as to say this isn't Mexican food at all. I don't know what it actually is other than Mexican named, but it isn't good. and I won't be back.",0.893,0.786,0.12,0.094,0.5441084229390681

They are incredible!  The food was DEEELICIOUS! I walked in, smelled the food, and almost asked my neighboring tables for a ""taste"" of their food as I was waiting to order! haha We ordered the Dos Ceviches, which were one of the best  I've ever had. It was a difficult decision, but I think I prefer the Yellowtail Ceviche (slightly) more than the Shrimp, but both are definitely worth the try. For the main course, we shared a Carne Asada fajitas entree, and Enchiladas De Mariscos. Although the enchiladas were pretty tasty, I think the fajitas and tacos are more unique and unforgettable at this restaurant. The Carne Asada were marinated and cooked perfectly with green bell peppers - the texture of the meat was perfect and not overcooked like most places I've tried. The flour tortillas and other sides were all fresh and delicioso.  The food here smells good, tastes good, and is priced right! The bonus were the really good (and complementary!) corn chips and salsa. We also ordered guacamole, which was made fresh to order. The sangria was good, too! My review is nothing but positive, but I held back on one star because of the short white wine list, and my ambivalence towards their dessert menu which included a mediocre Tres Leches Cake.

I always order the steak fajitas. The past two times I have ordered them at lunch time the meat was terrible quality and mostly fat and gristle. I left hungry both times because the meat was mostly inedible.  Last weekend we ordered from Zapatista through Dining In. That will NEVER happen again. Of course, I ordered steak fajitas. The fajitias arrived, and there were no tortillas and no condiments(lettuce, sour cream, etc), so I had a plastic container of meat and a green pepper. If I happened to have had any tortillas or taco shells I could have made do, but I didn't have much food at all which was why we ordered delivery.  My husband ordered nachos, and he was so dissatisfied that he says we will never order delivery from Zapatista again(and I agree). We are both completely turned off of Zapatista now, and it used to be our favorite. What's even more annoying is I have the $30 Groupon deal, and we have no interest in going there anytime soon even though the kids beg every weekend. We will be going to La Cantina more now even though it is much farther from us, and their delivery was delivered as ordered.j I wish I could write a glowing review because it's depressing to see all of the restaurants closing in South Loop, but Zapatista has really been on a downhill slide lately.

There was a short wait for tables, but we were seated immediately thanks to having made a reservation. The food was good, made with high quality ingredients and lots of flavors. It wasn't the best ever, but it was right on for the price point of $10-20 per entree. The service was pretty good despite how busy they were. The margaritas were solid; not the best ever but quite good.

It was like being in a loud bar where the two of us had to almost yell in order to hear one another. Not great for dinner conversation. -The desserts were both a miss. The chocolate tamal (Zapatista's novel take on chocolate lava cake) was a goopy mess of chocolate sauce populated with a small amount of cake. I would have thought ours was a mistake if I hadn't seen two other tables receive the same thing. The capirotada (bread pudding) was a good idea with poor execution. It had some interesting ingredients that probably go together quite well. But it definitely seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. We were given a spoon to eat this with (which would normally be more than up to the task of bread pudding), but it would have been more appropriate to use a fork and knife to cut this into bite-sized pieces because it had become dry and chewy.

By adequate I mean they just divide it to allow for a smaller portion. There's no deal and now it's just an expensive Mexican place. The server was still great.

2011-04-03,3.0,"Food:  2 Service:  3 Atmosphere:  4 Value:  3 I don't often get down to the South Loop but now that my friend just moved there, I may be broadening my horizons.  Sitting in his apartment on a Saturday night and wanting some Mexican food, we turned to the wonders of Yelp and Google to direct us.  This place was a block away, had decent reviews, and a large, veggie-friendly menu, so I figured we couldn't go wrong.  We didn't.  We also didn't really go right either.   The restaurant was hopping on a Saturday night at 7:30 and had a cool vibe to it.  We elected to sit in the bar area rather than wait which was probably a good choice.  The chips and salsa came quickly.  Chips = delicious.  Salsa = tomato water (not delicious).  Although all vegetarian items in a mexican restaurant are essentially the same, I still had trouble making up my mind.  Eventually, I went with a mix of the pescado and vegetales ""tacos de la casa"" and guacamole.     The guacamole was fresh, well-seasoned, and had a great semi-chunky consistency.  It would have been great if it weren't for the extreme lime-bath it took before it arrived at our table.  I expect to get a touch of lime in my guacamole but this was a full-on groping.  My friend couldn't finish it but I managed to choke it down diluting it with the tomato water salsa.  We also asked for it ""medium spicy,"" and the heat level was similar to a Minnesota Spring (lukewarm at best). The vegetales tacos were acceptable and the pescado was slightly better.  Everything was cooked nicely but needed a little more seasoning, especially the supposedly ""ancho-marinated"" tilapia.  The rice, beans, and pico de gallo were the most memorable part of the dish.  The rice wasn't too dry, the beans added great consistency and flavor, and the pico de gallo added great brightness to the plate.  For $10, not a bad meal.   Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking for an easy, fun, slightly upscale Mexican dinner.  It's a little commercialized but still has some authentic touches to it.  The food is underwhelming, but I felt the atmosphere was good enough to save it from the dreaded 2-star review.  See, I'm not such a restaurant snob after all. [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9988,0.739,0.229,0.032,0.5638447971781306

I suppose one more minor negative was the tiny table. Most of the food comes on 2-3 plates per person included trays for tortillas, so when our food came they had to take the chips, salsa, and queso away, but I really wanted to keep munching. Without holding something on my lap, that was impossible. Still, our meals came promptly and it was GOOD. I ordered fajitas because I had read in a diet journal that they are the low calorie way to go at Mexican restaurants. Not the case here - but I'm not complaining.

It's usually pretty crowded, so it doesn't hurt to make a same-day reservation. Zapatista has a small bar area, large main dining room, and outdoor patio. If you don't mind listening to the Orange/Green lines pass every three minutes, the patio might be for you, but I would suggest staying inside. The chips and salsa at Zapatista are nothing to rave about - I've given the guacamole two tries (medium and mild), and it's fine, but again, not spectacular. Zapatista's menu has a good number of offerings, of which I would probably suggest the flautas de pollo (get two and treat it as an entree). If you time it right, two people can easily have multiple drinks and dinner at Zapatista for under $40. The restaurant offers drink specials almost every night of the week, and I've almost never had a bad cocktail there (the exception being the Mexican Mimosa on their brunch menu - disgusting!).

I'm slightly disappointed.  The ambiance and the wonderful outdoor patio makes this place look so promising, but as they say - looks are deceiving.  When it's a nice day the patio is always packed and every dish always looks so delicious, but that's where they fall flat.  The food is sub-par and the drinks are nothing to brag about either. The first time I went I had the 3 taco dish.  The portions were very generous, but the tacos themselves lacked a lot of seasoning.  I ordered 3 different types of tacos and with each one I was hoping for something better, or some kind of surprise inside, but sadly nothing happened.  The second time, I went with the steak salad and I felt robbed.  Half of the things that were mentioned in the menu, were nowhere to be found on my salad.  The steak was extremely chewing, the ""dressing"" might as well just say olive oil and it was basically the size of a side salad.  I felt so un-satisfied that I felt like I needed to go across the street to Subway and get a 6-inch just to complete my appetite. Despite the fact that I obviously order incorrectly, there were some good things that came out of the place.  The guacamole is really quite delicious, BUT note that it's served pretty warm.  I understand that it's made to order, but I've never had hot (as in temperature) guacamole before and it made the texture un-enjoyable.  I wanted to keep eating cause it was so good, but it was like liquidy pudding.  No mas!    Another good dish was the Conchinita Pibil - smart choice by my husband.  Although I didn't have more than 1 bite, the bit I did have was pretty good. So will I be returning?  Maybe for happy hour.  Otherwise I would much rather chow on some pizza across the street at Flo and Santos or next door for a lychee martini at Opera.",0.9979,0.751,0.218,0.031,0.5833664021164021

As I walked toward the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised; the patio seem quite full. I thought to myself, ""okay, so, there are people here! That means the food shouldn't be so bad"". When I sat down and looked at the menu, the contents looked ""okay"". It was simple with a hint of trendiness. However, nothing really stood out for me. For dinner, my friend and I shared a salad. We each later on had an entree of our choices of three tacos. (Sure thing, we didn't do anything adventurous. But, on the same note, the honest truth is, there really was nothing that seem more adventurous than tacos! Either tacos filled with meats, cheese & fried, tacos with meat and cheese & sandwiched, or tacos with meat & cheese and grilled, plus or minus sauce) So, the salad was fresh but, the ingredients didn't stand out ""together"" in particular. The entree, I thought would be better.  I was wrong, it was also bland. The flavors just did not ""pop"", if you don't mind. The Mexican style rice was Just ""okay"" and so were the refried beans. I did think everything was fresh, to a standard. All in all, freshness of our food is probably the only good thing I can put a stamp on. I wish I could make more positive comments about Zapatista but, I'd be dishonest if I do.  Like most reviewers had mentioned prior, this is a good ""drink & hang out place"" if location is ideal and an easy access among your party.

I kind of blew it off, and we went last night with a Groupon.  As it turns out, the reviewer pretty much summed up our experience in one sentence.  This is one of the few places where I am pretty sure we were treated as nicely as anyone without a Groupon - and I really appreciate that! In fact, the only reason this place gets any stars is because the service was pretty good.  We were seated quickly on a Wednesday without a reservation at 7pm. Although, they gave us a table that was super close to the neighboring table and on the corner of an aisle way so we had waiters and patrons bumping in to us the whole time.  We both ordered drinks - a house margarita and a la senorita (blend of sangria and margarita). Both were pretty bad - not a lot of citrus (or any) flavor, really. We tried the guacamole - again, not a lot of flavor. Maybe we have too high expectations? I preferred the roasted salsa.  My husband ordered the slow roasted pulled pork - it was pretty good, although it was pretty salty. I had the tacos - pork, steak, chicken - and they had absolutely no flavor of their own. Two of the three tacos came with different kinds of salsa on top and that was the only thing that really contributed to the experience - I even had to salt them (which after trying the roasted pork, was kind of weird). I also ordered ""spicy french fries"" which I had hoped would be more than french fries with grocery store seasoning salt. But I hoped wrong.  We ordered another round of drinks - I forget what kind. They were a little better, but still not something I'd go back for. They weren't very inventive or very flavorful.  Overall, this is not a place for good Mexican food, even if you have a discount.  I would give it 2.5 stars, but this time I am rounding down.  Maybe we'll try it for brunch as people seem to think it's pretty good.",0.9839,0.857,0.122,0.02,0.566688034188034

2010-06-14,1.0,"I was not at all impressed with my recent experience dining at Zapatista. I usually try not to write bad reviews, but in this case it is necessary. The service was appalling. She brought an extra drink we didn't order, we had to ask for more chips and salsa, we had to ask her twice if they would accept a groupon via the iphone app, she NEVER asked us how we liked our food (to which my dining partner and I would have both answered negatively), and to top it all off, after waiting a ridiculously long amount of time for her to bring our check and then charge the credit card, she entered the total in as some random amount over $100, which she then had to void and re-run with the correct amount. Now, I understand service can sometimes be lacking due to a busy day, or an inexperienced server, and this I can usually forgive. However, in this case, our server was not at all apologetic for any of her mistakes. And the food didn't make up for it... I will admit, the guacamole was amazing--very well balanced with a yummy citrus flavor. We were quite happy with this suggestion. However, it was all downhill from here. I got the almond-crusted tilapia, which showed up covered in a thick breading, accompanied by a cheap-tasting shrimp fried rice. I love seafood, and once I scraped off all the icky breading from the comically large piece of fish, the meat itself was pretty good, but the shrimp in the fried rice was mushy. My dining partner has carne asada fajitas which arrived in a bubbling, spitting stone bowl that proceeded to blow smoke in my face for half the meal. I tried a bit of the meat and it had a strange smoky flavor, and not in a good way. He said the fajitas were all right, but that he would not consider coming back for more. To top it all off, we decided to try a dessert to cleanse our palettes. This was a terrible mistake. We ordered flan and were told they only had orange-flavored, so we thought we'd give it a try. WAY too much gelatin in the dish... it was very hard and rubbery, and the orange flavor was HORRIBLE. It had a sour-tasting syrup sauce on top which clashed with the strawberries covered in powdered sugar (also surprisingly tart) that were on top. I think we each had two bites and decided to cut our losses. And again, I'd like to reiterate, our waitress NEVER asked us if we enjoyed our meal. I'm not sure if it was a result of the food itself or the overall disappointing dining experience, but my dining partner and I had stomach aches all evening. We went to take a walk and had to pop tums before we left the car. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Zapatista any time soon, and will do my best to spare my friends similarly awful dining experiences.",0.9847,0.78,0.136,0.085,0.5560557208994709

I assumed the drink would have been courtesy since it was a full drink but was shocked when I was charged for the drink I barely touched.  When asked, the waiter explained it was my fault and he had to charge me. Since I grew up in the restaurant business and spend a great deal of time in restaurants...I was shocked. I have never been to an establishment where they would not have replaced the drink out of courtesy. He spoke to the manager and got it taken off our bill but then the manager came over proceeded speak to explain since it was my fault he was not obligated to replace the drink; he was not nice about it and for me it came down to the principle.

2010-06-07,3.0,"Using our last Groupon for Zapatista and before heading to the burbs, we made a pit stop for lunch in S. Loop.  Our memory served us correctly on the duo ceviche, which we happily chowed down as our afternoon appetizer with every last totopo (tortilla chip).  Talk about clean, zesty, crisp, delightful on the palate, and light in the belly, I should have stuck with what I know.   Prior to arrival, I recalled having read that Zapatista has $5.00 chilaquiles on their Sunday brunch menu (see previous review where I noted them).  If you've read several of my reviews, you might consider me predictable, as I try the same named-foods at different locations.  I however, consider myself a connoisseur when it comes to chilaquiles, bloody marys, scallops, mojitos, guacamole, crab legs, crab cakes, lobster bisque, and other such. So, my final take on the chilaquiles you ask?  When you order $5.00 chilaquiles, expect to get $5.00 chilaquiles. Being one of those foods that I could eat (almost) everyday, I insisted on trying them along with my brunch accompaniment of ""El Bigote Famoso"" and wished I had gone with a combo platter instead.  You can tell these are batch-prepared in advance, soaked in salsa, turned to mush, and ladled on their resting place, topped with a few strands of shredded white cheese.  For the unknowing soul who has no clue about chilaquiles, the flavor may have been okay, texture, not okay.  For a chilaquiles know-it-all like myself, QUE VERGUENZA (how embarrassing)!  Service, as always was great, atmosphere finely tuned with Morelos inspired images, and my ""Bigote Famoso""?  Well fellow Yelper, all those lime rind chunks made it not as famoso as the last time.",0.9528,0.877,0.091,0.032,0.43931623931623925

2010-05-28,3.0,"This warm, welcoming Mexican restaurant is just a hop, skip and jump away from Columbia College's urban campus. Zapatista is nestled just far enough away that it is new and refreshing, but not prohibitively far away, making it within walking distance. Traditional Mexican tiling and decor makes the place pretty legitimate, and excellent service and food solidifies this. ChicagoNoms hit them up last week to put their menu to the test. Accompanied with my buddy John Trierweiler, who introduced the place to me, I was excited to try it out. While it was a week night, we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table, attesting to the popularity of the restaurant. If you plan on coming on a Friday or on the weekend, I'd recommend calling in advance or being prepared to wait. ""My favorite part about Zapatista is the atmosphere,"" John said. ""The unique charm and energy of the restaurant makes you feel outside of the south loop."" Once seated, we were served traditional tortilla chips with a delicious, not-too-spicy salsa. Guacamole is optional, for an extra charge. The menu is impressively large, encompassing all traditional Mexican fare. According to John, they have an astounding one hundred different selections of tequila. I selected the vegetarian enchilada, with John choosing the tacos- featuring a chicken, fish and steak varieties. ""I love the tacos, because you can choose three different styles and experience some new and unique flavors you might not be used to,"" John said. Our food came out very quick, and it was hot, fresh and tasty. My enchilada was good, but slightly uninspired. There could have been just a bit more flavor, but it certainly wasn't bad. John enjoyed his tacos, until he got to the fish. ""The chicken chipotle tacos are a must!"" he said. ""With generous pieces of chicken dressed with tomatoes, onion, and cilantro, the flavor ignites in your mouth, definitely my favorite of any around."" He took one bite out of his fish taco and had a displeased look, it definitely wasn't sitting well with him. ""Fish tacos are tricky, I think you either like them or you don't. They have a lot of flavor, almost too much flavor-Tilapia with a mixture of pickled vegetables- that didn't sit well with me."" By and large, it was an enjoyable experience, and I would definitely recommend the place to a college student looking for a fun night out. The prices are a little high for a college kid- I payed about $13 for my enchiladas- but it's nice for an occasional splurge. The Price Rating: The Advertising Major- Kids who know they'll get filthy rich soon enough- is the moderate category.

Sat in the bar area, service was quick and relatively efficient considering management has handicapped their servers and gotten rid of an actual bartender and makes them mix their own drinks.  Terrible idea on a lot of fronts but let's get to those drinks.  Bloody Mary's are an awesome idea at $5 but not when they are overly heavy on the tomato, light on the spice and there isn't even a hint of vodka in them.  The plus is that if you run out of salsa you can dip your chip in your drink.  Our waitress said they are using a new mix, they need to go back to the old one and hire an actual bartender to make them. On to the food, the brunch menu offers essentially the same items they always have or at least have since it was revised about a year or so ago.  The lady is into the Motelanos (sp?), however, yesterdays offering came up way short.  First off, if you are going to have plantains in a dish they need to be fresh and hot.  Nothing is worse than lukewarm/cold plantains in a dish that is suppose to be hot.  Also, what happen to the thick strips of apple cut bacon?  Whoever decided to switch low grade Sysco brand to save a few bucks should be fired.  This place is not a greasy spoon and that tasty bacon used to make this dish, now it takes away. The Chilacques (sp?) are still basically the same but instead of being able to get Al Pastor pork like you could in the past they only have Carnitas.  Carnitas is great but not the best at brunch to go with your eggs, the sweetness of the previous pork offerings really complimented the dish, now it just seems like you are eating the left over shavings from last night's roast.  Again, that is cool when I'm whipping up breakfast at home but when you are out you don't want leftovers on your plate.  Unless someone is in there at 4 to 5 am getting the Carnitas ready on the weekends that is what you are getting. When you have to send your drink and food back in the same meal I think that says something.  Especially when you have to send the food back because it was delivered cold.  The manager stopped by and apologize but didn't really have an resolution to explain the cold bacon and eggs except the were opening up a bunch of new spots across the greater Chicago area.  Maybe that is the problem.  I guess it is possible they have become a bit more focused on expanding and less focused on doing things right in their current locations.  Sadly, there are too many other tasty options out there to waste time going back a second time to find out.",0.9591,0.822,0.103,0.075,0.4303793201334184

My enchiladas would have been very good, but they were served lukewarm so that the cheese was more of a wad than a melty treat. The green chile was good if a bit salty, and the accompanying rice and beans were also good, but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend enjoyed his tacos, but felt that they tasted very similar (he ordered one steak, one pork and one chicken) so he wished he'd changed up the pork for fish to mix it up a bit.

Had to wait a bit for the ice to cool it off. Maybe the top shelf ones are better?  As others have mentioned, the guacamole is made to order, but not prepared tableside. WAY over priced for the amount. This is not the only place in town serving freshly prepared guacamole. I can think of one place where you get nearly twice as much guac for the same price. Do not be impressed with this starter here. They offer freshly cut Jicama in addition to chips for an additional $2. That was a great combination. Only complaint about that was the menu says ""sticks"", but they were more like giant, thickly sliced wedges, not the best size for dipping.  The 3 Cheese Enchiladas were excellent. Their refried black beans are the best ever! I am told the Carne Asada was good. I had a taste, and it was chewy...the main reason I don't like skirt steak.  For dessert, I went with the Orange Flan. Never again. Not recommended. The flan itself was nothing special. There was a caramel sauce as per usual with flan, but it was more so raw orange liqueur dumped on it. That's ok if cooked in a sauce, but overpowering and unpleasant just dumped on there.  Service was ok. Bit of a wait between drink rounds. Long wait for the check at the end, but pleasant and professional. Casual atmosphere, but definitely had a vibe of the upper-class South Loop crowd. Oh...and this place is REALLY loud. No hushed conversation here.  Good Mexican food, but nothing special.",-0.4436,0.73,0.137,0.133,0.550448133426857

There's nothing worse than going out to eat with your kids and come to find out that your waiter acts annoyed at every request.  Granted we went on Valentines day for a ""family"" dinner maybe this guy was scornful or something because of the occasion, or maybe he just sucks.  He acted annoyed when I asked him for shredded cheese for my 1yr old and brought this tiny little sauce cup out with cheese in it.  I had to ask for a refill twice.  I had to hunt him down every time I wanted another drink.  The worse part about it was I'd see him hanging out at the front desk shooting the hay with the hostess, it's not like he was unavailable because he was busy.  Made me feel self conscious about my baby throwing food on the floor.  His attitude really put a damper on the night. Overall the food is ok.  A bit pricey for what you get, but it's allegedly ""upscale"" mexican.  I got my usual chicken fajitas which were very tasty.  The only thing SUPER annoying is that you pay $17 for the fajita meat and corn shells??!!!  You have to pay extra for rice and beans, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT??!!!  Other than that the fajitas are good, the only issue I had was with our small table the literally bubbling hot bowl they served it in was put at the corner of my table with my kid sitting right there, hello??!!!

We had specific price limits and vegetarian requirements, good walking distance to the Hilton hotel, all that. Zapatista came through like a charm.  Talking with the managers was easy, they provided exactly the space our group required, in an attractive front room curtained off from the restaurant. We had access to a private bar even though we took the cash bar option, and not the drink package. The food was delicious! Really good guac, served in a giant stone basin (it looked like a mortar and pestle, but I know it has another name...); excellent chips and salsa; dreamy shrimp empanadas; some kind of chicken thing--all excellent.  The advice for Zapatista came from the Hilton concierge, so I've got to give them the credit here, but really, for an event location, for the food quality, ambiance and the location, Zapatista cannot be beat. Trust me. I spent a month and a half scouring the south loop for a restaurant that wouldn't bring shame on me or my husband, and after all the dust settled, I'm so glad we went with Zapatista!

We got there right before 6:00 and we got in without reservations. After we were seated, it looked like a few parties came in and there was a wait, we made it just in time!  My husband started with the tequila flight and he thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. The flight is $25 and you get 3 good sized shots of tequila and a nice spicy bloody Mary type mixer to chase with the flight. They also gave him some lime slices, which was a good idea! I had a basic margarita on the rocks and it was amazing. If you are looking for something different, try the flight and you will be buzzing in no time! We started with an order of guacamole and it was outstanding. I love guac so it's hard to have a bad batch. For my meal I had the Tacos al Pastor; adobo marinated pork served in corn tortillas with pineapple salsa, Mexican rice and refried black beans. My meal was out of this world! The smoky pork with the pineapple salsa was a different taste and it was just awesome! My hubs had the Tacos Alambres; grilled USDA prime beef strip loin, bacon, crispy onions, poblano rajas, Chihuahua cheese along with the rice and beans. He really enjoyed his tacos but he said he liked mine better. I didn't taste his dinner but it looked and smelled amazing.

We had reservations, and were seated almost immediately after arriving 15 minutes early. Zapatista started with bonus points before we even took our seats. The atmosphere is nice and quaint without being too kitschy, slightly upscale and similar to a lot of other south loop (and west loop, for that matter) restaurants in this range. Being possibly the worst night of the year to go out to eat, it was quite busy.  The service was very good nonetheless. Chips and salsa were delivered immediately. We ordered micheladas, guacamole and tuna ceviche. The micheladas were spicy (just the way I like them), and priced right. The guacamole was nice and fresh (the guac-making stand is located in the dining room), the avocados were obviously high-quality and perfectly ripe, and the guac had just the right amount of kick. The ceviche was rather unusual, it was quite sweet with a lot of coconut flavor, and piled on something resembling flour tortilla chips. It challenged my notion of ceviche, but the tuna flavor was a tad obscured by the coconut. I would order it again, for sure. The fish tacos I had were served in soft corn tortillas and loaded with grilled fish and rather spicy pickled vegetables. I also ordered some habanero salsa to go with them, and though I used some of it, I probably didn't need it with the spicy vegetables.  Overall, everything was fresh and tasty. The service was very good at this price point (took our server a while longer than usual to come back around for our entree order, but otherwise it was excellent) and the price was in line with the quality of the food.

Ironically, this place is just steps away from my building, but it took us 45 minutes to get there if you count the El ride to River North and back. (Damn you, Rick Bayless.) Turned out to be for the best. Zapatista was wonderful, and I foresee many more meals here, especially given its close proximity to my warm living room and pajamas. It's upscale Mexican, one of my favorite kinds of cuisine when done right. Zapatista definitely gets it right, starting from the moment you sit down and homemade tortilla chips and salsa are delivered to your table. There's a also a cute stone bowl shaped like a hollowed out pig at the table for guacamole, which I'm guessing means they make it tableside. We started with plantana tostaditas (plantains, guac, queso, sour cream and mole poblano sauce). Think Ritz cracker hors devours, but about a million times better. They are bite-sized bits of awesomeness. Seriously, you must get them. Order with an even-numbered party and save yourself having to fight for one. Or better yet, just get two orders. For entrees we opted for the mahi mahi tacos and the tres queso enchilada. The fish in the tacos is beer-battered which sounds gross but was terrific. They are topped with a spicy citrus cole slaw and a sauce that's highly reminiscent of the secret sauce on a Big Mac. Again, I know it sounds gross, but it works, trust me. The enchilada was great, too. I really liked the verda sauce on it. Smoky and tangy at the same time.  HIghly recommend if you're in the neighborhood.

I live right upstairs in the same building, and it's pretty awesome to have such a great brunch spot right downstairs. The best thing about the brunch is the pricing! I was shocked at how reasonable the pricing was compared to the menu at any other time of day.  Eric, who works at the bar is quite awesome and hooks it up with pretty amazing cocktails (especially the horchata shot).  Awesome South Loop establishment!

2009-12-13,3.0,"O Zapatista, of the delicious bacon-tacos and the most dangerous revolving door I've ever encountered. There are good things and bad things about Zapatista... good:  the tacos alambres, made out of steak and bacon!  good:  the service is almost always friendly.  And they have excellent guacamole, and offer jicama (for $2), which is gerat for me since their chips are NOT gluten-free, but prepared in a fryer which plenty-o-wheat products go into. Bad:  the last time I was there, we saw an employee shoving the trash down into the trash can with a chip basket, which she then put back on the shelf of chip baskets.  They put a piece of paper between the baskets and chips, but STILL!!  very off-putting. Also, the veggie tacos are sort of puny and dry.   And, for celiacs like me, there is an unfortunate inconsistency in what varying waitstaff say is safe and gluten-free.  I've eaten the rice several times, after checking with the staff and having them check with the kitchen.  Last time I was there, the waiter said the rice had flour in it.  Great.  Oops.   but on to the DANGEROUS revolving door!!  the thing, even though it seems to be made out of cast iron, somehow spins too fast, and if you enter when it's crowded, you'll get whacked!  i walked in one evening when there was a line at the front, and people behind me coming through the dastardly door, and since there wasn't ample room once I stepped into the restaurant, the damn door slammed me in the back!  I am wee, and that thing is heavy, and it took the breath out of me for quite a bit.  Then the woman behind me got decked as well.  I had a lovely, garish bruise on my spine the next day.  The dangers of dining out... So beware of the door, the random unsanitary implement, and cross-contamination of gluten is your kryptonite!  Otherwise, dig in!  They have bacon on their tacos!!!",0.8091,0.826,0.101,0.073,0.5260536398467432

2009-10-19,3.0,"I've eaten at Zapatistas four times, most likely because I live right next to it. Once take out, twice inside, and once on the patio. I'll review each. Inside: First off, I find this place pricey for what you get. With that said, the atmosphere is nice and the service is good. The first time I ate here I had the Beef Fajitas and a Margarita. The meat was perfectly cooked and presentation was fantastic. The margarita was pretty good as well, but I wouldn't say it was amazing (I had heard things). The second time I ate here the food was not as good. I enjoyed the Beef Fajitas so much the first time that I decided to have them again. However, this time around the meat was over-cooked and the service not as good. Patio: This was a great experience. I only came for after-work drinks but the atmosphere and services were very good. Recommended in the summer time! Take Out: Horrible. The food was luke-warm even though I got there before it came out to me and the freshness that you get by eating in the restaurant was just not there. I have a feeling they gave me an order that was sent back earlier, just re-heated. Very disappointing for the price. Overall, I recommend Zap's if you're going to eat-in or want to enjoy some relaxing drinks on the patio.

2009-10-18,4.0,"Zapatista saved my hide today. Big time birthday brunch for the lady, and I had two options in mind for our cost-conscious, green-to-the-city kith and kin: Eleven City Diner and Flaco's Tacos. Ruled out Flaco's on the quick since it just didn't feel right for the occasion, and set our sights on Eleven for a low-key brunch. After misleading the fam about the trek (""Just two more blocks. I swear."" I, too, am green to the city.) the scads of people bulging out of Eleven could be seen two blocks away. ""Party of eight? Oh, gee, the wait will be over an hour. Sorry."" Yikes. Put all my eggs in one basket and that basket repaid me by blowing up in my damn face. Now what? Think. Fast. Please. Uhhh I'm not a brunch expert yet, and the only other place I know close is the Bongo Room, which (1)looks abandoned when nobody is in there and (2)clearly wasn't abandoned as evidenced by the line I could already see snaking it's way down Wabash. Mercifully, a more seasoned South Loop denizen suggested Zapatista. Two concerns immediately came to mind: Concern the first: Shit. It's going to be too pricey. I'll be drawn and quartered for this long, costly journey. Concern the second: If these other places are jammed then surely Zapatista will be just as packed. Man, was I surprised when we walked in, were seated right away, and had a reasonably priced Mexican brunch. Mindblowing! It's like an invisible Great Wall of Roosevelt repelled the throng of college students and such that were filling up the queues a block or two up the street. Is Roosevelt too far south for these people? Is the brunch at the Bongo Room and Eleven THAT much better than Zapatista? I found Zapatista to be quite good. Nice decor which invokes the spirit of Mexico in a not-too-fancy way. There was even a little Day of the Dead display in the lobby. Always appreciated to have a bite of knowledge and culture before a meal. The molcajetes at each table are great, and the servers use them to make your guacamole fresh, too. Ate 173790812 pounds of tortilla chips with their salsa and guacamole, and then proceeded to devour the Mexican eggs benedict with chorizo (huevos de la revolucion, I believe). The eggs benedict didn't set my world on fire, but they were definitely good, and the friendly, prompt service and chips--my god those chips--won my heart. My girlfriend had some other dish with two dynamite pieces of bacon. I'm sure she would've loved to try the bacon had I note pilfered them before she knew they were there. For her birthday, the waitress brought over a chocolate cake-filled corn husk which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Hard to go wrong with chocolate and ice cream, but the portion was just enough to make us all happy.  Zapatista, I owe you a solid.

I've wanted to try this place for a while, but since I'm watching my dollars I had hoped we'd opt for something a little more budget friendly. However, I feel that my meal was worth every penny. I'll dispense with the one negative first, service. Per usual I was late to dinner, but my butt barely hit the chair before our server wanted my drink order. Some time to glance at menu would have been nice, but I ordered a margarita on the fly. Almost as quickly our server wanted our food order too, again I hadn't had a chance to crack the menu. After our meals came our server all but disappeared; we never got a chance to order another round of drinks and I was craving another yummy margarita. The food was quite tasty, the menu includes way more than the Mexican standards. I got the tilapia tacos, which the server recommended over the mahi ones. They were so tasty I inhaled them lickity split and devoured the rice and beans on my plate. The tacos don't come with salsa, but the salsa on the table complimented them nicely. You can add pico de gallo, guac, lettuce, sour cream and cheese for $3.50. Personally, I think the pico and cheese should be included afterall you are already paying $11 for 3 tacos. Anyway, the rest of my table got the burrito with roasted tomatillo-cascabel salsa; pollo al carbon; and chipotle chicken enchiladas suiza style with cuatro chiles salsa. Everyone had nothing, but love for their food. We chatted non-stop throughout our meal so I didn't get much of a chance to drink in the decor. I will say what I saw of it was nice and tasteful. By the way if guacamole is your thing they make troughs of it to order.

We were sat right away, which I was surprised with because the place was packed. Our waitress was lovely, but she was either over sat in her section or someone called out sick so I will definitely give her the benefit of the doubt and she was doing the best she could. We ordered Queso Fundido for an appetizer which feed the 4 of us perfectly. We also had guacamole with chips...good guacamole but all of us mentioned how fresh we have had it elsewhere...I had the Enchiladas de Mariscos which were very yummy. They were filled with tilapa, came with about 4 shrimp on the plate and only 1 scallop (only one). The sauce...some kind of chipotle..had a little kick to it. The dinner friends had skirt steak which she was not happy with how it was cooked. When requested to get it cooked a bit more, the waitress simply took the meat and left the rest of her dish to eat (rice and beans). It did take quite some time to have the meat brought back. Another one had enchiladas and he ate every bite on his plate.  The fun part of the night was when Earth Hour hit and all the lights went out. It was cool to eat by candle light but you could tell it was a bit hard for the staff to see what and where they were going. We were so packed in there that people bumped our table every time they walked by. It was a little too packed in there for my liking. It was like being at a wedding reception that you knew the couldn't control the guest list. The only really bad part, besides the slow service, was when the guys had to go to the bar to get drinks refreshed because the wait was too long, the waitress then charged us for them!

2009-03-04,5.0,"Taking advantage of Restaurant Week 2009, the three of us sat down on a Tuesday night to what turned out to be an outstanding meal. Tuesdays at Zapatista are $5 Mojitos, any despite the low price, this was the best mojito I have ever had.  Original is flavor and taste, yet enough alcohol to pack the type of punch mojitos are known for.  Perfect way to start the meal. Restaurant Week at Zapatista entitles each member any appetizer, entree, and dessert for $32.  Some restaurants during the Week have set menus, but Zapatista actually lets you choose anything on their menu. For appetizers, we had the Cecivhe de Atun en Tostaditas, the Guacamole (spicy), and the Empanadas Veracuzanas.  The ceviche was delicious and the hint of coconut made it even better, along with the crunch of the tostadita.  The guacamole was pretty good, but we probably should've ordered it medium instead of spicy.  The empanada was light and perfectly fried to a golden brown. Our entrees consisted of the Camaron Sinaloa (shrimp), the Salmon Organico en Chipotle, and the Chili Relleno.  The shrimp dish was decent and came with a heavy dosing of chipotle salsa.  The plantains on the side were an extra bonus.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and really meaty, and the mashed potatoes beneath it enhanced the overall plate.  The chili relleno was very tasty and lightly fried.  It was relatively cheap in cost yet very filling. Finally, for dessert, we chose the Tres Leches Cake, the Chocolate Tamale, and the Sopapillas Con Pillionsillo.  The cake was the best of the three and super moist.  The chocolate tamale was some serious dark chocolate with a molten center.  Without the ice cream next to it, someone might go into a choco-coma.  The sopapillas, which were discovered to be fried pieces, similar to elephant ears, were really lame.  They were served with ice cream and some brown sugar sauce, but really it was a huge waste. The service was great and our server was attentive and enthusiastic about everything.   Overall, this is a great place to meet after work and grab a drink and experience authentic Mexican food at a low price.",0.9972,0.791,0.186,0.022,0.5247530864197529

It comes with black beans and rice which are good, but not the best I've ever had. Their sangria was quite good and they might have the most extensive tequila menu I have ever seen.

The absolute worst ceviche possible. C'mon, ceviche should have a strong acid taste to it (hence marinating in lime juice) and even a spicy kick to it. The tuna ceviche was the sweetest, worst ceviche I've ever had and the shrimp ceviche was not much better.  Next I tried the highly recommended ""bistec"" (aka-NY strip).  Overcooked and as bland as a steak as I've ever had.  Not tasty at all.  Being a 3-course menu, I was obliged to try desserts which were hardly any better. The tres leches was as dense of a tres leches cake as I've ever seen and the molten lava cake was more like a thick choco pudding.  Blah!

We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were seated within 10 minutes. The service here is good.  We started the meal with chips and salsa. They have a selection of 5 different salsas. All of them were great and spanned the entire spectrum of heat. We were a little miffed  when the server took our half eaten basket of chips from the table while we were still eating, but he only took it to replace it with a fresh basket of warm chips, so we were impressed by that.   The guacamole was good, but not great and was a really small portion for the price. To the main course we has several items between the 6 of us. The mini tostadas in both the pork and plantain (veggie) varieties were great. The fish tacos also got a good review. The best dish that we had, and what this place is known for, was the Fajitas the presentation is completely different than any place we have ever been to. They are served in a large stone bowl which has been super heated. This bowl stayed warm and kept the sauce boiling for 30 minutes  In the bottom of the bowl is a gooey mixture of mole sauce, cheese, and salsa that is delicious. This sauce keeps the meat very tender unlike the flat skillets that are used at most other places.   The only bummer is that the side plate that has the lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and tomatoes costs an extra $3.50.

We had a pitcher of their regular margarita which at $26 was pretty good. I like my margaritas strong and it was enough for us to contemplate returning just for the margaritas. For our main course my wife and I had the fajitas for two (skirt steak and tilapia) and really liked the presentation. The steak was laid out like a fan on one half of a huge stone skillet type thing and the other half was covered by the tilapia. We ended up ordering the guacamole, lettuce and sour cream platter extra as well but the portion was small and I think chilies has a better version of these sides ( and its included in the price).  The meats were kept warm in a mix of Asadero cheese, poblano chiles and a salsa which was tasty but could have done with a little more heat. The steak was really juicy and tender and the tilapia (though tasty) paled in comparison to the steak. There was a mix of corn and flour tortillas which were both warm and plentiful. Our friend had the grouper with the mushrooms and herbs which was ok...again a bit bland for my tastes. As we were done with our meal we peeked over at what other people were having and saw some tacos and enchiladas. Perhaps that is what I shall try the next time I am here. Bottomline - the food was good (not great) and so was the ambiance. I can see myself coming back to hangout at the bar rather than for dinner. The dinner for the three of us without dessert was approximately $30 pp which for a Saturday night without a reservation was pretty good.",0.9969,0.825,0.166,0.009,0.53751665001665

We shared the brunch burrito and the chicken chilaquiles. The portions were bigger than we expected. The chicken was a bit too cooked out. Other than that though, everything tasted pretty good. It is a good value.  The place gets one star because of the service. I don't really mind if the wait staff at a restaurant are a bit impolite. What is worse to me is not being able to get their attention. And the worst possible thing is to have to put up with someone who doesn't want to do their job because they don't expect you're going to tip enough. Our waitress didn't seem happy from the moment we said we were just going to order water (its was noon on a Sunday, we usually won't have drinks then). And I suppose it didn't help when we both ordered from the $5 brunch menu. While waiting for food, we had to ask several people for more salsa, and we didn't actually get it till long after our food came. In the end, we got our $10 bill, and I still tipped over the minimum I would with the quality of the service. We happened to be sitting pretty close to the bar. While we were still sitting, the waitress was kind enough to take our paid bill and walk around near the bar showing the bartender and other waitresses how much we had ripped her off. I'm surprised how proud someone can be of how poorly they perform their job. I won't support a restaurant whose wait staff does not know that it is not good for business to mock their customers, so despite the good value for the meal, I won't be returning.",0.9576,0.818,0.12,0.062,0.5977941176470589

My boyfriend ordered the tacos, chicken, steak & fish, it came with mexican rice and a chorizo bean side.  I didn't have a chance to try anything but the chorizo bean, but that was very tasty.   I ordered the steak fajitas.  I will say when I order fajitas, I always regeret it after because the meat is really tough, or the flavor is bland, but this was nothing to regret.  Through the entire dinner I couldn't believe how delicious this dish was!  It came out in a sizzling stone bowl (that matched the guacamole bowl) with slices of deliciously marinated steak covered in sauce with melted cheese all over.  There was a grilled green pepper piece and green onion piece included.   To top it off, when I couldn't finish and I brought the food home, they made sure to add in some lettuce, tomato, onion and a side of fresh tortillas on the side to bring home.   Our server was attentive, quick and extremely energetic.  He was constantly dancing to the live music.   My only complaint would be the noise level, but if you are in a lively mood, it's sure to be a good time.",0.951,0.829,0.108,0.063,0.5784391534391536

It was raining a bit - very nice atmosphere. But the reason I'm giving them 3 stars was our stoned waiter Alex. Or at least, we thought we was stoned. He would come to our table and just sort of stare at us, as if his presence there was being telepathically broadcast. He would ask us something, we would answer, and he would ask us again later, as if nothing had happened. He . . . talked. . . very. . . slowly . . .  That was all amusing until he brought out everyone's entrees but mine. I thought my food was just taking longer. Wrong. My order was magically forgotten. Eventually I grabbed a manager, complained, and they brought out my food, and I ate awkwardly as my fellow diners had all finished and they all were ready to go. It was weird. The restaurant comped me. That was nice. I would go again, but, Beware the Alex! P.S. One negative about this restaurant was the men's room. It is ridiculously small, and the door opens in such a way that men and women walking by can see you standing at the urinal in your full glory. The restroom is so small that you cannot easily navigate around other men trying to relieve themselves. Great place to make friends I guess.

But I am favorably inclined. I haven't been in the south loop for a while -- apparently quite a while! -- so I was impressed at how much this area has turned around. Z is a short stroll from the rebuilt Roosevelt Road L station, which was an eye opener in itself. So clean and fancy! It's right next door to Opera, which was another surprise, since I've wanted to go to Opera, but haven't been yet. Okay, so far this review makes me sound like the ultimate yokel. ""They's got buildin's more'n three stories high there!"" I was amused by the dueling valet parkers for Opera and Zapatista. It's like West Side Story with white boys in uniforms. The room is huge-ass, but divided into several dining areas, to make it seem less intimidating. There are even a couple of privatish nooks, which is nice. And the staff close off areas with long red velvet curtains, to make it seem less cavernous. It gets pretty loud, so this is not necessarily the place for an intimate dinner. There's also an outdoor dining area, which would be my choice on a warm summer night. What I had of the food was delish. It's certainly cleaned up for whitey, despite the photos of revolutionaries on the walls. So if you're afraid of too much heat or unfamiliar flavors, you've got nothing to worry about. The guacamole was excellent, and served in a molcajete (that mortar and pestle thingy), which was a nice touch. All of the food was fresh, and the staff did a good job of keeping the warming trays full. The staff, by the way, was excellent. Since this was a big private party, they were of course on top of their game. But they were very attentive, and very friendly, which is hard to fake.",0.9955,0.779,0.191,0.03,0.5512478101608537

My frozen margarita melted in .2 seconds, and when I had a regular margarita for my second round, it was much much better than the frozen variety. We chatted around the loud bar and were then seated at our table, which was also surrounded by extreme loudness.  The chips were good and after two bites of the salsa, I thought it good. It was a smoky salsa and those always take some adjusting. Our waiter disappeared for about an hour. Had no idea where he went. He magically pounced on our table and asked if we were ready to order. Did he have to ask at that point? I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas because they sounded unique (with potatoes and carrots). Unfortunately, they were pretty bland and the mole sauce needed some help. Everything was too smokey tasting and while they said my entree had cheese in it, there was none. My friends dishes looked ok. The birthday girl ordered fajitas that came in a huge steaming bowl that looked like it was made out of hardened lava. They were unusual fajitas and I guess something I should go back and try. They had an extensive menu, so that gives them a star. The interior was very cool and the fact that they have doors that open makes it a great summer time spot. Our waiter took another 2 hours to get us our check. Perhaps it seemed like we were enjoying ourselves too much, but really, it had been far too long without a check up. We didn't say it was my friend's birthday because she would have had to wear a sombrero. The place was classy until we saw another table celebrating someone's annual event.

We sat at the bar and had great service from Jorge who was the only bartender and was working to keep us all happy even though he was really busy as there wasn't an empty seat at the bar on a Wednesday night.  Interesting collection of people; from suburban lawyers to young couples who had recently moved to this changing neighborhood to colleagues from work enjoying some camaraderie- everyone was having a good time. The menu is typical American/Mexican with things like quesadillas, fajitas, burritos and tacos.  We had a steak burrito (large and filled with grilled steak and lettuce and tomatoes and served with hot sauce- you get a choice of 5 different levels of spice offered in the sauces) and chicken fajitas which came in one of those lava stone bowls.  Both were very tasty and came with black beans and rice.   Their house specialties like pollo ticul or carne asada tampiquena seem to be a little more authentic and also looked good.  They  offer the same menu for lunch or dinner so you can get your favorites all day long. If you like ""fancy drinks""  they have an entire menu of drinks for you or do as we did and just order your old stand by (in our case it is a vodka soda) served quickly and efficiently.

I really enjoyed the different varieties of mole at this restaurant. First, ask for a variety of salsas to enjoy with your chips. The guac appetizer  was really good. The tamale appetizer is quite tasty, and the sauces served with it were excellent. For entrees, I have had the enchilada combo and that was very flavorful - though a large portion. The carne asada tampiquena was excellent. It basically is a steak (flank or strip?) and an enchilada in brown mole w/ cheese. It was very well done and quite flavorful. For desert, I highly recommend the tres leches -- to die for! For the record, I also have gotten the tacos for take out. The were just ok. I found the carne asada to be not the best cut. I'm sure it would be better if I had eaten them at the restaurant--then I could have doctored them up. Also, there was a mix up in the kitchen w/ my take out order so it took awhile.

2007-01-08,5.0,"My husband's company hosted their Holiday Party at Zapatista and it was FANTASTIC.  We were welcomed at the door with our choice of margaritas or sangria, which was a bit awkward since we still needed to hang up our coats, but the very yummy margaritas made up for the minor blunder.  Each bistro table had its own large molcajete filled with fresh, delicious guacamole and plenty of chips and two large buffet tables beckoned us to sample the rice and beans, enchiladas, fajitas, tacos and tamales, which everyone seemed to love (I stuck with the rice and beans that night having eaten FAR too much guac and chips).  The space was perfect for around 200 guests, although it got a bit loud, but the lighting and decor were warm and inviting and the staff very accommodating.  My husband's company's ""chief of music"" was allowed to hook his iPod into the sound system, which ensured great music all night (although, surprisingly, no terrible margarita-induced dancing).  I would head back to Zapatista for dinner sometime and definitely recommend it to someone planning an event.",0.9922,0.717,0.235,0.048,0.6275974025974026
2007-01-07,1.0,"I have never had such bad service in my life. My boyfriend and I were looking for Mexican in the south loop and this was the only place we could find. We get there at about 7 and the hostess tells us it will be about 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, we are still sitting at the bar. 30 minutes later we insist on being seated and they finally seat us. Then it takes our server 10 minutes to come ask us for drinks. We order guac, which takes another 15 minutes (Did they drive all the way to Mexico to get the avacadoes?) At this point, we are both unhappy with the service and that the prices are a bit steep, so we ask for our bill. All we had was water and an order of guac and it was $10! What a rip off. Next time, I will spend the hour I lost going to a good Mexican restaurant instead of wasting my time at this place.",-0.3274,0.918,0.034,0.048,0.4242424242424242
2006-12-15,2.0,"Let me start by saying my experience was delivery. I was craving tamales and sopa de pollo and that's exactly what I ordered.  The tamales were awful...the poblano...well I had a hard time finding any pepper in there in general and the sauce had potential, just not much flavor.  The chicken tamale, ack, even worse, terrible presentation and the accompanying sauce had zero flavor.  I was so disappointed. The sopa de pollo however was FABULOUS.  I absolutely loved it.  It was exactly what I wanted and full of flavor.   I also ordered a side of re fried black beans that were pretty darn tasty!   Delivery was very quick (through  diningin.com ) and everything was packaged really well.  I would go back to try something else, but I probably won't be ordering in from them again.",0.3519,0.871,0.07,0.059,0.5930555555555554

We found ourselves at Zapatista which was packed with a lively late dinner crowd.  I loved the open-air feel of the place, and the brightly painted walls.  Great atmosphere. The guacamole is wonderful, as is the service.  If you have a sweet tooth, order a side of plantains with your meal.  I had the chicken fajitas which were flavorful (watch out for the beans..they have a kick!) My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos and incorporated one steak taco in there, too and he thought they were fantastic. I had a raspberry mojito that was delish and the boyfriend had a caipirinha that was a bit on the weak side.

One of the servers had a foul up while bringing out our food, dropped a bunch on the floor, but it was fixed up really quickly with much apology and some comped desert from the manager. We were in no hurry so a few extra minutes to wait didnt bother us much, after all we had the margaritas!

The Moustache... who can go wrong with a place that has a drink called The Moustache.  Seriously.  It's delicious and funny.  This place is like the slightly cheaper sister of Adobo.",0.9719,0.774,0.185,0.041,0.6518154761904762

2006-07-11,1.0,"Bring the Mexican tradition back! What Happened? I was one of those in line to celebrate at last the opening of a Mexican food place in the South Loop, but my first visit 1day after it was open was horrible!!! No waiters to actually serve us some water, and then the water came and they disappeared again!!! What's going on here? Ok, let's wait maybe its b/c they are short tonight and since it's the opening, it's ok. The server comes to us 30 min later, take our orders and messes it all up! Bad experience. We all agreed to come back again 2 months later b/c i litterally live a block away from it. So here we go and this time not only did they mess up the orders, the food didn't taste Mexican at all. I mean the sauces, the rice ( which was white) and more than anything we were never asked about the kind of drinks we needed? Water is what we get :) If U want Authentic Mexican, stay away from it.
