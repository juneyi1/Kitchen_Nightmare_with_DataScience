Hard to say why our experience was so much better, but we came around 11:45am and sat outside for a late-July lunch, if those variables matter. Honestly, I was really impressed. Hubs & I shared our entrees. Summary: Loved the St Louis ribs but hold the sauce (too vinegar-y for our taste) Great Shrimp Po'boy - it was fried but not covered with tons of batter (awesome) Good potato salad and I'm hard to please on potato salad - not mushy, just the right amount of ""sweet""  So-so coleslaw, but outstanding mixed veggies - so flavorful and not overcooked Overall, better than most of the meals on our vacay to Chicago.",0.993,0.669,0.302,0.03,0.6038690476190476

Shrimp was good but the rest was the worst BBQ I ever experienced.  The brisket was dry and tasted way over smoked. I didn't know I would ever say something was over smoked but good grief, I might as well eat a cigar . The pulled pork was dry as well. The ribs were ok.

2017-07-12,1.0,"Take a seat boys and girls cuz this is going to be a good one. I was in the area today and noticed this place for the first time. I got pretty excited because I'm a long time home BBQer. I couldn't wait to try out a new place so close to home. Who doesn't love a good BBQ place? Later that evening, I placed an order through Yelp Eat24. $67 in food. Main items were a full rack of ribs and a half order of their sliced brisket. Got a few sides and a half order of chicken wings to complement. Pick up. Eat24 informs me that it was going to take 60 minutes for a pick up. This wasn't acceptable because I have small children. I didn't plan on a pick order taking an hour. So I called Eat24 to cancel and the customer service rep said that their system was showing a 20 min wait. He calls the restaurant and apparently they had push the wrong buttons on their end. The restaurant also informs Eat24 that they were out of sliced brisket. No problem. I completely understand running out of a meat at a BBQ place. Replaced it with pulled pork. This is when the story gets good. When I got to the restaurant at about 7:30 pm, I made sure to check my receipt to see if they charged me for the pulled pork or for the brisket. This was a concern because the brisket was $2 more expensive. According to the receipt, they indeed did charge for the brisket. I bring it up to the woman who was serving me and these were her EXACT words: ""Do you actually expect me to take the $2 off?"" Oh yeah. That was her response but don't think this is the peak of this story. It gets better. I told her I actually expect to pay for the food that I'm receiving. She hands me $2 in cash and I take my sizable bag and turn to leave. Before I had even taken a step, with my back turned, she lets this one out: ""Thanks for tipping."" That's right folks. The server here expected a tip on a take out order. Not just any take out order. One that had been riddled with problems. In my 39 years of life, I had never encountered a server that wanted a tip on a take out order. And then to actually say it to my back as I left. Just wow. At this point, I leave and begin to drive away. But I just couldn't let it go so I come back and ask for a manager. She says that the manager is not there and I ask for an alternative way to contact them. She says that's not possible. I'm actually curious if her manager or boss even cares so I'm going to call the restaurant later, near closing, and let them know. I'll update this review then. It's one thing if it's just one server. It's another if it's a systemic issue. Anyways, the food. For a place that advertises itself as a ""smokehouse"", the food was completely devoid of any smoke rings. The chicken wings and ribs were just gray and a bit overdone. Still can be understandable since they might be smoking at a higher temp to meet customer demand but I fully expected the pulled pork to show some evidence of pinkness near the bark. Nothing. You can come to your own conclusions about a ""smokehouse"" that has food that shows no sign of using wood.",0.9417,0.903,0.057,0.04,0.45172062237279614

I ordered the brisket sandwich. The portion size is way tiny for the price you pay. Most other places the meat is heaped so high that it's falling out with every bite. This sandwich not one piece fell out. The brisket wasn't juicy like people are saying it's very greasy. Reminds me of people who throw meat in a crock pot than quickly throw it over some smoking pieces of wood and try to pass it for smoked meat. The smoke flavor was just that, smoke. Not sure what wood was used but definitely could use some apple or pecan wood.     The sides I had were the mac n cheese and rum beans. Mac n cheese has a nice stick to the ribs consistency, good flavor. The rum beans...not for the kiddies! Like one reviewer said it's Bushes beans with what seemed like half a bottle of rum mixed in!

Some of the reviews I'd read beforehand complained that food wasn't good and that the restaurant is overpriced. After visiting, I have to agree with this assessment.  I visited on a Friday night around 5:30pm. There was no one in the restaurant so we were able to sit anywhere. The hostess/waitress was very friendly and attentive. She was probably the best part of the entire experience. She greeted us promptly and came back to the table at regular intervals to ensure that we had everything we needed. I ordered the catfish, coleslaw and fries. I didn't care for any of it honesty. The catfish was okay but definitely not good or something I'd order again. The fries seemed to be coated in olive oil or a similar substance. It was light but enough as to where I could taste the difference. I found the fries greasy but I still ate them. I didn't like the cole slaw either. My mom liked it so she ate it. My mom ordered the wings and fries. She said the wings were just fair and didn't care for the fries at all. My sister ordered the two meat combo. She had the hot link and beef brisket. The hot link wasn't a hot link at all. It was just a piece of sausage. She thought it was just ok. I had a piece of it too and I agree with her assessment. She liked the beef brisket. The baked beans we both ordered were good.  Overall, we weren't too pleased with the food given the price and the location. I think the bill was just over $50. I liken Rylon's to a dressed up hole-in-the-wall. Just because it's in the south loop doesn't mean it can play ball in the big league. When it was all said and done we all agreed that we wouldn't be back.

I liked the unique sides:  grilled asparagus (good), potato salad (good), rum baked beans (good, but you can really taste the rum).  But, the meal didn't come with any bread, rolls, cornbread  - very unusual.  And Rylon's is pricey.  I've been to much better BBQ places:  Milt's BBQ for the Perplexed (OUTSTANDING); Q-BBQ in Oak Park (OUTSTANDING).   Rylon's was just ok.  Hubby liked it (he got the sliders), so he wants to go back and give it another try and perhaps order the ribs. I'll go, but not that excited about this place.  Service was excellent.",0.768,0.82,0.096,0.084,0.6274104683195592

2016-11-04,5.0,"While walking home from an eye doctor appointment, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in. We've been to this location before back when it was a different restaurant and wanted to see what the new tenants had to offer.  The restaurant is now bigger with the addition next door. Maybe they'll consider fixing their entrance as it will back up if the place becomes busy. However, I still gave this place a 5 star because the food was fantastic. You instantly could tell it was good based on the smells . We ordered the full rib tips with asparagus and beans and the pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese and French fries.  We got everything to go and it was still great. The rib tips were juicy and fresh. They didn't douse the rib tips with bbq sauce and gave us sauce on the side. The rib tips tasted great even without the sauce! The asparagus was tasty. The beans were definitely unique and had a maple syrup-y taste. The pulled pork sandwich was on the sweeter side, but still good. The mac n cheese was delicious and the French fries were different with the hint of herbs. They gave us different types of BBQ sauce so you have to taste them all! I will most definitely be going back and will be making this my BBQ place of choice. I will be coming back to try more of the menu. Even more excited that it is a whiskey bar as this will be my place to watch football on some days.",0.9795,0.886,0.108,0.006,0.4686147186147186
2016-10-29,3.0,"Being from the South and have travelled and had some  delicious BBQ in this country.....this place is mediocre. The sauce on the table was better than that in the chopped brisket. The sauce on the crusted mac-n-cheese made that mac-n-cheese. Without it, I do not recommend the mac. Also disappointed in the baked beans. I really expected maybe a different type of bean in some original sauce. I will not be ordering those again either.  If you are on this side of town and want BBQ, cool, otherwise go up on the north side of town. Sorry for the harshness.

2016-10-28,3.0,"Because batter and berries is really great, we came here because it's a block from our place and it's BBQ! As everyone else said the entrance is a little off-putting and the lighting is really dim. We got the Rylon and the meats were all lukewarm. The ribs were the best thing and the sauce on the table was better than the sauce on the pulled pork or sliced brisket. The mac n cheese was also lukewarm but had a good flavor and the beans were so cinnamon forward they weren't easy to eat. All in all I hope there are some tweaks to the menu before I decide to come back. Also, there's no bread, cornbread or rolls on the menu and it's a BBQ place that's kind of a staple. I hope this place does better because I am happy about restaurants coming to South Loop, but want them to be more quality.",0.9705,0.781,0.173,0.046,0.5736111111111112

We started out with the sampler plate, four different meats,ribs, brisket, pulled pork and Blackened shrimp it was all very good. Great smoke flavor and the blackened shrimp were delicious. For dinner  we had po boy shrimp sandwich, small sandwich sampler and the wings. The po boy was ok everything else was fantastic. We also had fries ( delicious seasoning) but could have been cooked a tad longer. The crispy baked mac & cheese was great the coleslaw was good there was only one item that none of us liked and that was the baked beans too sweet almost taste like apples and cinnamon. Overall we all said the same thing we will definitely be back, great to have this place in our neighborhood.",0.9858,0.71,0.243,0.047,0.6238235294117648
2016-10-26,4.0,Happy to see a BBQ place open in the South loop. I ordered half slab ribs with rum baked beans and mac n cheese to go. Big portions and that order alone leaves me with more than half to eat later! The ribs were fall off the bone making it very easy to eat without a mess. The baked beans were more on the watery side than I am used to. The mac n cheese was ok and probably would get another side next time. The girl who took my to go order was friendly and helpful to give me recommendations. The to go order only took 5 minutes to be ready maybe since I was the only one there at 5pm. I will be back to try their other menu items.,0.9516,0.839,0.146,0.015,0.4435185185185185
2016-10-25,3.0,"Happy to see a bbq place open up a block from my house.  To start, the entrance is strange and creates a bottleneck of patrons waiting for togo orders, hostess's standing around and a large counter that is in the way.  Hopefully once the bar opens this frees up some space.  Ordered to go and service was quick, 10 minutes or so.  $56 total w/ tax and $5 tip for a  ($25+$2) combo platter of 4 st louis style ribs, small pile of pork and small pile of chopped brisket w/ fries and a tiny cup of mac and cheese ($2 upcharge) also got a large (8 piece) $19 order of wings. Brisket- fatty, greasy, barely warm, and over cooked to the point where is was mushy Pulled pork- average, good flavor but lots of fat and cartilage. Ribs- outstanding, no sauce needed and fall off the bone.  Great flavor, only thing i would order Wings- very good, but still small even for being double wings Mac- average, cold, small, kind of mealy and sauce had separated. Fries- meh, decent but not quite cooked all the way.  Sauces- skip em.  Weird sweet bbq and a decent hot sauce that was good on the wings. Overall this place is way overpriced for what you get, where it is, and the quality.  I understand it just opened, but this is not how you get return customers.  For the same price (maybe less) you can go to Green Street smoked meats and get world class bbq in a better atmosphere and get a few drinks while you are there.  I will give it another try in a month or two and see if things change, if its the same i will not be returning.",0.985,0.839,0.13,0.031,0.5192471042471044
2016-10-25,3.0,"I was disappointed in my first and hopefully not last visit to Rylon's. My husband and I decided to go for dinner. Upon entering we were greeted by the hostess and owner and were seated. There were probably 2 other customers in the dining area which was surprising since it was 7:30pm. The menu looked quite appealing to the eye. We were notified by the waitress that no alcoholic beverages were available due to them not having their liquor license. I overheard another waitress telling her customers the same thing and she mentioned it could be ""another 30 days, you know, due to politics."" So before we began our food orders we were also notified by our waitress what they don't have available. Pretty surprised to here SEVERAL items were not available for order. My husband and I decided we'd split the slab of ribs and shrimp combo, fries, and lobster mac-n-cheese. We shared an order of wings as our appetizer. The smoked wings taste great, but they were room temperature. The bbq sauce was a hit with my husband. I found the garlic too overpowering, but that didn't stop me from using it on everything. The rest of the meal came about 5 minutes after the appetizer, and it was also room temperature. Correction, the lobster mac was cold, and everything else room temperature. We didn't complain and just ate our meal. I guess I just don't understand why they are open if they don't have their entire menu available and the bar is closed. I have to be honest the huge signs outside their place advertising their bar really drew me to them. I'm willing to give them another shot, hopefully they'll have their liquor license. Oh....forgot to mention when we were given our bills they were in La Cantina Grill check presenter folder. I'm assuming they haven't received their own check presenter folders either.

2016-10-25,1.0,"Very disappointing in not only the food but the prices and customer service were bad too. Firstly, the prices are way too high for the quality and quantity of the food. We ordered the wings and slab of ribs. Both meats weren't restaurant quality and flavorless. I got the feeling that this place would be better suited as a carryout with lower prices. I phoned the manager Erica to give feedback, but was told that she was in the kitchen cooking. That may explain the seasoning issues. Nevertheless, she never returned the call to a $60 customer. I will not be returning here. You have been warned.",-0.7812,0.842,0.049,0.109,0.6583333333333333

2016-10-23,5.0,"Really enjoyed the food here and am so happy to have a BBQ spot in South Loop! Ordered the Ribs Tips combo plate with the Grilled Garlic Asparagus and Rum Baked Beans and the Chopped Brisket with Potato Salad and Herbed Frenchs.  The Rib Tips were juicy and deliciously smoky! Every piece was so tender and the sauce it came with was just finger licking good. The Grilled Garlic Asparagus was actually very flavorful and Grilled perfectly, not too soft and not too underdone. The Rum Baked Beans were wonderfully sweet with a maple syrup kind of flavor that made it irresistible! The Chopped Brisket was also juicy with shreds and chunks of flavorful Brisket. The sauce tasted different than the Rib Tip sauce and the sauce from the squeeze bottle on the tables. All of the sauces were honestly so good, I couldn't help but dip my Herbed Fries in them. The Fries didn't taste any differently than regular fries, but there were herbs sprinkled on top, so the aesthetic was nice. The Potato Salad was very good. The potatoes were soft and seasoned well.  The portion sizes were pretty generous for the price in comparison to other smoked meat shops like Green Street and Smoque. I really loved the food here and will be back for sure to try the items that weren't offered today, unfortunately, such as the Catfish, Beer Can Chicken, Sliced Brisket, Alligator Links, Veggie Broth Baked Beans, and Coleslaw.",0.9947,0.785,0.208,0.006,0.6181081525312295
2016-10-22,3.0,"Love when new places open in the South Loop and was looking forward to trying it out. We went on a Friday night and since the bar isn't open yet decided on carry out. The layout is just odd. If someone is standing at the hostess desk you're stuck in the doorway. Very awkward entry way. I ordered the two meat smoked platter with pulled pork and chopped brisket. Very moist and tasty, but very fatty. There were 3 chunks of fat that I had to pull out of the meat....kind of gross to be honest. Two sides were included. I chose the Mac and cheese, which I would not get again as it as was not very good, especially considering it is a $2 up charge. It was greasy and ice cold. I could not eat more than one bite. Potato wedges are nothing more than fries, bland and cold as well, they tasted like microwave fries.. I realize we had a takeout order but nothing can get that cold within a 5 minute walk home. My friend had a  full order of chopped brisket with Mac and Cheese and the rum baked beans. We didn't check the order before we left, which was a mistake. He only received a half order. Lots of fat with his brisket as well. Baked beans were great. He didn't care for the Mac and Cheese either. We were surprised that they included two very small sized sides of BBQ sauce (about the size of a jello shot). That being said the meat was so flavorful the sauce really wasn't needed so I guess that is s moot point. I was shocked that bread wasn't included with the meal. We will try the place again and hopefully I can change the review to 5 stars. Maybe they just need to get into their groove.",0.9149,0.837,0.096,0.066,0.6002253302253302

2016-10-20,4.0,"Was excited for this place to open because I work nearby and there is a severe lack of convenient options around McCormick Place. Upon walking in, I immediately wished they'd done more with the build-out, because you walk right into the counter upon entering and there is little room to maneuver for guests and employees. Met Chef Derek, really nice man, asked him for a recommendation and he told me everything is good. Everything is also really expensive so it better be good!  I wanted to try the alligator links but they didn't have them yet. Settled on the trio of sliders with mac n cheese, rum baked beans for $15. It was ready quickly, packed a lot of flavor and was very filling. I think I'll be back but neither my wallet or gut can afford it more than once a week.",0.8328,0.883,0.093,0.024,0.5323809523809524
