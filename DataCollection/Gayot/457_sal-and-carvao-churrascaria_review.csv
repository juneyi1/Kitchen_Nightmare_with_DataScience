2006-12-18,3.0,"I love the Brazilian styled restaurants.  I had been to Fago De Chao and was ready to try Sal & Carvao. The salad bar was fantastic. The grilled meats and fish were excellent! My only criticism is regarding the side orders. I loved the little breads.  But, the mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese were too salty. Why not make a balance with something sweet? They need to be more creative. I know that Fago De Chao has a sweet plantain side dish which makes a great balance with the seasoned meats.  Sal & Carvao is closed now as they are remodeling and re-strategizing their genre.  I hope they include a balance of sweet/salt.",0.9855,0.709,0.268,0.023,0.6571428571428571
2006-12-11,1.0,"Let's get something out of the way: I don't eat meat. But that is NOT why I'm giving this restaurant one star, hear me out on this one. The system here is that you flip the card to green to have the servers come over and red if you don't want them to come over. This would be great except the waiters were totally ignoring the system. I never put my card on green and my plate was filled with non-meat food the whole time, so it's not like I looked like I was starving and almost every server offered me what they had. On the flip side, the people sitting across from me kept getting skipped. We were sitting at the end of a long table, and servers kept entering the room, hitting the other end of the table then leaving (and not because they were out of food). So that in itself was pretty annoying. ALSO it's not really all you can eat, at a certain point they just stopped coming around. And it's not because we had an insane amount of food already, as I mentioned earlier my end of the table kept getting skipped so the people who kept their cards green really hadn't had that much.  So that was the service, now for the food- it sucked. I got a bunch of pesto pasta from the salad bar thinking it would be my main course because I love pesto but it just tasted kind of old. The entire salad bar is cold, even foods that would be served better hot (with the exception of the soups). They had a cheese selection but the only thing that was good was the brie, the other cheese were just hard little chunks like you'd get on a cheapo party platter from a grocery store. The grilled portabello strips were very tasty but weird to eat cold. The mac and cheese and mashed potatoes that are served on the table were good, but very standard. The fries obviously came frozen from a bag. The rolls were yummy but tiny and we kept running out, and they weren't refilled until we asked. My party had three different kind of deserts and no one liked any of them. It was a passion fruit tart, some kind of chocolate torte and coconut flan. None were gross, they just weren't especially tasty they kinda seemed like they had been shipped into the restaurant frozen. To me when a restaurant has bad desert it's pretty hopeless since desert (to me) is pretty much tasty by default.  Basically thought this place was a total waste of money. If you're going here because you want to eat a lot of meat you'd get more just going to a steakhouse. And if you're a vegetarian definitely avoid at all costs.",0.9075,0.802,0.103,0.095,0.5728479853479854
2006-11-08,5.0,"My favorite churrascaria in Chicago. The atmosphere is not frantic like other places around town. You can have a relaxed dinner indulging in the 14 or so types of meat offered. I also love the salad bar. The second time I went there, they didn't serve the plaintains,which I love. I made mention of it to my waiter  who let me know they didn't serve it anymore but he could get them to make a plate for us. AWESOME. The service was wonderful and non intrusive. I love this place!",0.9823,0.708,0.277,0.015,0.646875

2006-08-14,5.0,"One of my favorites... If someone else is footing the bill, I'm suggesting we're going to Sal & Carvao! In all seriousness, I've never seen a check at this restaurant so I honestly have no idea what the damage range is, but based on the quality and quantity of the food, I'm assuming it's a pricier evening out.  I was not a meat eater the first time that I dined here. I hadn't had steak since I was 2 years old because I didn't like it then and didn't think I ever would. However, I had no problem finding TONS of great food selections gorging myself on the swell salad and cheese/cracker bar, the fabulous rolls, mashed potatoes and other sides that they put on each table, and the SALMON! Oh, the Salmon... It is really, really good.  Between my first and second visit, I discovered that I actually enjoy a big piece of fillet so I had an even more fantastic meal on my birthday taking advantage of their fillet varieties and some great chicken dishes (as well as that Salmon again). It was my birthday so I had my choice of desserts - also delicious.  Skip lunch and make a dinner reservation here for sure! I have remained loyal to this restaurant over Fogo de Chao because I heard they don't have salmon as an entree (?)...",0.992,0.744,0.2,0.056,0.6063271604938272
2006-08-05,5.0,"I went to Sal & Carvao on my first night in Chicago when I was looking for apartments and the food was great!  There is just something that I love about the barbaric approach of flipping a little card from red to green to have more meat brought to you table.  In addition to the great meat, the salad bar is top notch, and the interior decor is awesome.  Of course, I may be a little biased since I lived across the street from Sal & Carvao, and I would wake up and go to bed seeing the neon sign reflect through my bedroom window.  :-) My only complaint is that the place is a bit pricey, expect to spend around $60-$70 per person with only one drink.",0.9577,0.814,0.156,0.03,0.5955555555555556
2006-04-24,5.0,"Another restaurant that chose to be one of those up-and-coming churrascarias.  I really love coming here, as you are offered a variety of different cuts and types of meats that I normally wouldn't eat unless if I was here.  I also like the huge salad/veggie/antipasto (is that even applicable here?!) selection that they have.  A little pricey for all the time, but all in all, well worth the money!",0.8454,0.81,0.167,0.023,0.5583333333333333
2006-04-22,3.0,Last time I visited it did not WOW me. The meat was very bland and had none of the seasoning that usually makes it so yummy. I think there are some other local Brazilian Steakhouses that are better. I do low carb diet and it is a great place for that- tons of salad and protein!,0.7872,0.73,0.181,0.089,0.47129629629629627

2005-07-15,5.0,"Food like you have never seen more. A churrascaria is a brazilian steakhouse (i.e. all-you-can-eat meat). Servers come around and you choose from a wide array of roasted and grilled meats (filet mignon, lamb, marinated pork tenderloin, etc.) Price is rather steep so this is definitely a treat.
