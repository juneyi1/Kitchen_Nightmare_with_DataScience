I had some kind of chocolate cake for dessert, though, that I would definitely NOT recommend.

The bar area up front is nice with windows looking out onto Wells.   All the staff was great, very pleasant and professional if you will.  Whatever butter concoction comes with the bread is so yummy. I started with a beet salad which had goat cheese in it so obviously it was incredible.  I had steak frites for dinner -- tasty but not anything to write home about - and also tried their chicken which is their most popular menu item... it was great too.  I found their dessert portions a bit small, which required me to eat more dessert after my dessert - never a good thing. All in all, I think I enjoy other brasseries in the city more than this one, but I wouldn't NOT recommend it for a special occasion/night out with your parents.",0.9868,0.743,0.203,0.054,0.6414880952380952
2010-02-27,2.0,"We went here for my birthday dinner during Restaurant Week.  Everything was very tasty, but I would have left hungry if my boyfriend hadn't ordered a much heartier meal than me and let me eat off his plate.   1st course- he had the ravoli of the day and I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad.  Both appropriately portioned for the 1st course, but he could have used more than two ravoli.  The beet salad was par for the course. 2nd course- he ordered the casoulet and I ordered the fish special of the day (Alaskan cod with a few pieces of lobster).  The casoulet was heart with lamb belly, duck confit, and pork sausage, all on top of white beans.  The cod was maybe 3 medium bites and the lobster was tasty, but also hard to pick out of the leafy salad.  Tasty, but not enough to fill me up. 3rd course- Creme brulee and chocolate torte/cake of some sort.  Creme brulee was standard and the chocolate thingy I ate was tasty, but really heavy and seemed mismatched with the raspberry sorbet it was paired with. Another complaint I have is the fact that they never acknowledged that it was my birthday.  Picky, yes.  But for a restaurant of this caliber (aka price range), I expected to be greeted with a happy birthday by either the hostess or waiter (I noted it in my open table reservation).  Last year onesixty blue not only greeted me with a happy birthday, but they also sent out a dessert with Happy Birthday written on it. Also, when we went to get our coat at the coat check, the hostess was drinking a glass of wine at the bar and didn't even notice us standing there.  Seriously?   The verdict- I won't be back until next restaurant week, and even that is iffy.",0.9803,0.881,0.099,0.02,0.37579365079365074

2010-02-20,2.0,"Went here for dinner last night and was disappointed in the experience.  The gory details... Food: Sub-par, especially for a restaurant in the price range.  The first course was good, but not exceptional.  The beat salad was on the small side but tasty.  They wrapped the goat cheese that topped the salad was rolled in nuts and a bit sweet (cinnamon?) -- an unnecessary flourish that detracted from an otherwise solid dish.  Friend had the white shrimp and they were also a good starter. The mains disappointed.  Steak frites is a classic dish.  How on earth did OTB get this so wrong?  The steak came sliced on the plate (this should have been in the description of the dish) and the temp was tepid.  Moreover, the portion of steak was small and the steak was a bit tough; luckily the sauce added a bit of flavor.  Frites were adequately crispy but oversalted. Friends had cassoulet (best main of the night) and salmon (solid but unexceptional). Desserts were hit or miss too.  The chocolate dessert was quite tasty, the souffle, eggy but not terribly interesting. Drink: Red wine should NOT be served room temperature; it should be cellar temperature.  Any self-respecting French restaurant should know the difference. Service: the waiters were pleasant, but they lacked polish.  Two waiters struggled with English, by no means a sin but hardly ideal. Ambience: Very pleasant vibe, the place catered to a mostly older (50+) crowd.  The lounge singer was good and thankfully, was not so loud that it interrupted conversation.     For french in the area I prefer Bistrot Margot for better food/wine at a cheaper price point.",0.9703,0.73,0.163,0.107,0.5157142857142858

We started with the shrimp appetizer finished with lemon coulis and a warm chick pea salad.  Quite yummy. I had the skate special and my friend had the salmon.  Both fishies were cooked well and the skate may have been the best I have ever had.  We all know that french food is all about the sauce or foam as the trend seems to be.  Both were delightful enhancements of the meal.

I did not know what to exepct, only from reading yelp reviews I knew the restaurant was pricy but not so out of the ballpark that I could eat here a couple of times a year.  Most expensive item on the menu was a duo of rack of lamb and ribeye for $35. Most entrees run about $17-20 and apps are under $10.  I started with a potato leek soup that was beautifully presented with slices of baby potatoes and small cubes of bacon in a very light but creamy base.  My bf order the arugula, pear, pomegrante, roasted almonds and goat cheese salad (it could be enough to split) with champagne vinegrette, the combination of the pomegrante and the cheese really brought out the flavor of the cheese mixed in with just a hint of sweetness.  Entrees were AMAZING!! I had the Lobster (out of the shell) for $19.  Beautifully presented the tail and claws was served on a bed of whipped potatoes and some broccoli flowers surround by a pool of bisque and topped with foam. Excellent flavor and freshness (images of ""The Deadliest Catch"" came to mind). My BF ordered the Duo med rare, the ribeye has just a hint of char on the outside to seal in the juice and very tender in the center, the rack of lamb was also tender with just the slightest rim of fat on the edge for flavor.  We didn't order dessert this time (too full) but they had a pumpkin souffle that I return to try!   For soup, salad, 2 entrees and drinks were got out for $120 including tip.  Attentive service, there are several daily specials (pre fix Mondays for $29!)  that  are worth the trip if you want to check this restaurant out, easy street parking!",0.9942,0.871,0.129,0.0,0.5796759259259259
2009-10-25,4.0,"Old Town Brasserie is a very good restaurant full of charm and deliciously decadent French fare. I absolutely love French food, and when my date suggested OTB, I was excited as they had positive Yelp reviews.  The restaurant is super cute. I think they could have done a better job with the lighting, but I did like the pillars of candles all over the restaurant. Tres romantique!  We started with Champers, which always makes me happy.  For our meal, I had the roasted beet salad. It was good. However, they totally skimped on the beets and goat cheese. I'd say it was about 80 percent greens with a delicious balsamic dressing, with small accents of red and yellow beets.  For the main course, I had the duck. It was perfect. The duck breast was prepared medium rare, and sat on top of a bed of lentils in some sort of red wine reduction sauce. It was delicious. My date had the Ribeye and Lamb combination. Apparently it was very good as he finished the whole thing.  For dessert, we had the pumpkin souffle!!! It came out piping hot, with the aroma of the pumpkin and spices dancing in our face when set on the table. He let me crack it open, and we pretty much devoured it. It was so good that I could have probably eaten another one!!  At around 10pm, the jazz singer (who looked just like Harry Connick Jr.), came on to perform. Ok. He's not the best singer, but he puts on a good show. And he was adorable. Service was ok. But overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant.

It had some red pepper and almonds in it, boyfriend seemed to find it good but you can't really eat it in big doses.  The tea I got was warm and warmed me up (so did it's job) but had a funny smell/taste to it, almost plasticky... and the apple pie was warmed for us but I wish the crust/shell was crisper.. it was kind of soggy.

Where once the cooking and service were assured, this time it was patchy at best. The food was the biggest disappointment. Last time we were there it reminded me of many meals I've had in Paris or Bordeaux. This time it was occasionally fine but veered into bland once two often. The charcuteria plate was pretty uninteresting while my wife's oysters were the smallest I have ever seen. While she reported them as being tasty, tehy weren't really much of an appetizer.  Our entrees were little better. My duck was cooked just right but lacked the real depth of flavor that one expects from this gamey meat. Similarly, my wife's steak was just OK. Lastly, the desserts had also suffered a marked depreciation in standard. We were drooling about their souffles of old but yet again, the current versions are serviceable without being memorable.

2009-09-02,4.0,"I was a little apprehensive to try Old Town Brasserie again. My husband and I went when it first opened and although the food was good, we found the service and ambiance pretentious and awkward.  However, we decided to throw caution to the wind last night (I really didn't feel like cooking anything, and because I often feel this way, we have exhausted many of the other restaurants in the area) and give it another shot.  We were very pleasantly surprised!  From the moment we walked in, it was obvious that they had made a lot of changes.  The overall atmosphere was much more relaxed, as a true brasserie should be.  It was one of those rare-to-Chicago breezy, temperate late summer evenings, and the restaurant had the front windows open.  We sat half inside, half outside; a good spot for people watching.   Our waitress was polite and attentive.  She won us over immediately when she informed us that Tuesdays are half-off on all bottles of wine! We ended up getting a really nice bottle of Rioja for half the price. They revamped the menu since we were last there, and the food , though less fancy, is more authentically brasserie-like.  I ordered the Lyonnaise salad, the ""surf-n-turf"" and the chocolate souffle.  The salad was excellent... the egg was perfectly poached and the dressing was flavorful without being overwhelming.  I was less thrilled with entree, but this was mostly my fault.  I suffer from order anxiety sometimes, which is a condition in which I order things I don't really want.  This generally happens when I skip lunch (as I did yesterday) and am too hungry to think straight. Anyway, the surf-n-turf was tasty and well-prepared, but a lot heavier than I was in the mood for (who would have guessed that steak, shrimp, and potatoes drenched in bernnaise sauce would be heavy?).   I liked my husband's entree better, which was a steak (sans bernaise), crispy onion strings, and potatoes.  I'm a desert fiend, and souffles are one of my favorites.  The chocolate souffle I had last night was one of the best  I've had. It was perfect balance: light, fluffy and chocolatey.I could have eaten two of them!  I would go back for the desert alone.",0.9795,0.833,0.117,0.049,0.4813405797101448

Not bad, just off. All in all, I think Old Town Brasserie is a great date place...maybe not a first date, though, if you don't want to seem like a glutton.",-0.276,0.828,0.072,0.1,0.3482843137254902

2008-05-23,3.0,"I have been dying to eat here since it opened because of the pedigreed chef (Roland Liccione of Le Francais) and all the hype. The experience lived up to the expectations, minus a few annoyances.   First the good stuff:  beet salad with mixed greens, dime-sized slices of beets, and a crusted and fried circle of breaded goat cheese was indeed delicious, bringing together balanced flavors and textures. Classic and well executive. Each fish dish we ordered - the halibut and cobia were well prepared as was the beef entree and the lobster ravioli. A must have here are the souffles - we ordered two for the table and they were superlative.  Now the nitpicking: I never split entrees - I find it obnoxious and by the $5 split plate charge, so does the chef. But that is the choice of the guest and let us not forget that  restaurants are classified under the HOSPITALITY business. A $5 charge per split is far from hospitable. I can see taking up a table and a couple ordering a drink and splitting an entree but we ordered rounds of drinks, bottles of wine, first courses and desserts. This soured it for me, especially because there are so many OTHER places to check out. One dessert, however, was rather disappointing - profiteroles - classic French dessert. It came with three thumb nail sized cream puffs with equally small balls of ice cream in a chocolate sauce. But it was silly in size. A real brasserie profiterole can be had at Brasserie Jo - sizable and satisfying. Service overall was good -- attentive and informative. Definetely a place to check out - just don't  ask the kitchen to split a dish!",0.8633,0.89,0.081,0.029,0.46956521739130436

As far as the food, is was mostly superb.  I had the (rack of) lamb and braised beef combination.  They recommend the lamb at med-rare and the braised beef (cheeks) comes out medium.  Lamb a tad bit fatty, but very tasty.  The braised beef I cut easily with my fork.  My wife's Beef Wellington was 'good' but not great.  We let John pick a starter for us and he brought the lobster ravioli, which was most tasty, but small (kind of hard to split).  Also, we opted for a bottle of the Rosenblum Red Zinfandel, a good pairing and inexpensive at only $30.  From reading yelp reviews we knew to order the coconut souffle and we were rewarded with an outstanding end to our anniversary meal.  We will go back again, perhaps late on Friday or Saturday for just a drink and the piano bar.",0.9883,0.762,0.188,0.051,0.5676094276094277

And I know all the stereotypes about the French being haughty and rude to Americans.  To a ""T"", I've found these stereotypes to be overblown or just plain wrong.

My favorite was the lobster ravioli with chestnut, caviar, lobster sauce.  It was flavorful yet not overpowering.  Everything was very well balanced and delicious. Wait a minute, maybe my favorite was the seabass with sunchoke, truffle, champagne, and watercress sauce.... After that course, the frisee/haricot verts/herbs salad that was topped with a generous portion of shaved black truffles and finished with a tomato truffle vinaigrette was really refreshing.. The entree was also perfect - well balanced, seasoned, and moist.  It was a roast of venison with braised beef cheeks and a Kabocha puree with huckleberry.

2008-03-07,4.0,"I went here with my parents last night and had a fantastic meal. The decor is very clean and simple. It was packed (we had to wait a little bit even though we had a reservation) but it's not too loud or crowded feeling, probably because it draws an older crowd (I was by far the youngest person there -- I'm 25). If you're looking for a trendy, eye candy spot, this isn't it.  But it's perfect for going out with parents/family, clients, even a nice dinner date.  My parents and I split two of the appetizer specials. The first was a green salad with black truffles and green beans and two little fried balls that I believe had tomato and goat cheese. Honestly I don't know what was in them, but they were amazing. The other appetizer was a scallop cake (like a crab cake) with poached shrimp and pickled cucumbers. It was a substitute for the ravioli that's normally on the menu. I've never had a scallop cake and was a little skeptical but it was great. Very light and fresh.  For a main course I got the lobster dish with Jerusalem cous cous, which to my pleasant surprise also included shrimp and scallops. I'm very picky about over/under cooked scallops and they were spot on. The lobster was also perfectly cooked and overall the dish had great flavors, nice presentation, the perfect amount of food. My Dad also had the lobster and my mom had a special fish dish that wasn't as good as the lobster but still nice. For dessert we split a chocolate hazelnut tart. It was really good, but nothing I haven't had before at other nice restaurants.  This is a perfect place to take parents, clients, etc. It's nice to have interesting, upscale French food in a more casual atmosphere.

I'm afraid to see what it's like when they rush you. We couldn't believe the server's audacity and decided to walk out.  When we told them we were leaving, they were unapologetic and told us ""that next time we should make an earlier reservation."" They didn't have enough food for their 8:30 reservations? What business are they in? I don't think there is going to be a next time.

Right at the corner of Wells & Division, I am delighted to discover that Bob Djahanguiri (former owner of Toulouse & Yvette in the Gold Coast) has come out of hiding to bring back some good, old-fashioned bistro fare.  As I walk in, I am reminded of Balthazar in Paris and I feel a little deja vu, as if time stood still--People I haven't seen since my old dancing-in-a-cage days were there, almost as if to celebrate Bob's ""arrival.""  It's a scene to ""see and be seen""--pretty people everywhere--mingling of a sophisticated older crowd reliving their heyday mixed in with young, well-heeled hipsters.   The menu is limited, but ooh, what choices from which to pick!  My meal started out with the soup du jour--an extraordinary creamy blend of wild mushrooms followed by the most exquisite shaved black truffles dancing atop a perfectly chilled frisee salad.  Every bite, every crunch opened up taste buds I didn't know I still had.  The final course ended with an 8 oz. ribeye steak served with a wonderful swirl of puree de pommes.  Magnifique! I didn't get to see Nan Mason at the piano--an oldie, and a goodie--but I will sure go back on a Friday or Saturday when I am told she performs. ...nothing good comes without its opposite, so I unfortunately end this commentary with a little warning:  Get past the manager's aloofness----a Barney Rubble look-alike----and, as long as you don't mind the busboy asking you at the end of your meal whether you're ""still wurkEEN"" (Translation:  Are you finished eating), you will be pleasantly surprised by the cuisine and the ambience.  Ooh la la :)",0.9915,0.803,0.158,0.038,0.5389129389129389

I expressed my impatience twice and was told that a table was coming ""soon."" We were 5 seconds away from walking out when we were finally seated. In all fairness, they did offer us an appetizer and drink to make amends.  From here the meal improved SIGNIFICANTLY. Our waiter was funny, knowledgeable and really made the meal. The menu plus specials sounded so good that we went for a 4-course meal. I had escargots (wow), a frisee salad with black truffles (just okay) and the oil poached lobster (to die for). My husband's mushroom soup was good and rich and his tournedos of beef were delightful. My favorite course by far was the coconut souffle. It was rich, coconutty and the perfect airy texture. I could've eaten 4 more of them right then and there. We didn't want to drink too much on a weeknight and our great waiter offered us a half bottle of Saintsbury Pinot Noir, 2005.

Apps: We had the pate, the duck consomme, the oysters and the artichoke terrine.  My terrine was nice, but not incredible.  I tased the consomme and it was indeed rich.  Justin did not share either of the two lovely floating truffle ravioli, but they looked good.  The oysters were sweet, plump and fresh.  The highlight though was the pate - a trio of chicken liver, duck and country style pates - I preferred the duck but all were lovely. Entrees:  Members of my party had the duo of lamb and kobe, the duck duo, and the oil poached lobster w/scallops.  I had the tournadoes of beef.  I tasted everything and could not find any faults.  The veg accumens were appropriately paired and inventive, the proteins were all done well - I though the duck was a little dry, but redeemed itself with really crispy skin. Wine:  We had two bottles of a French pinot noir, reasonably priced at about $45.  It was nothing to write home about, but did the job well, considering our wide range of entree selections.

2007-09-29,4.0,"This new addition to Old Town has been open about a week and we stopped by last night to check it out. First of all, Old Town Brasserie has got alot going for it if past performance is any indication.  It's owner Bob Djahanjuiri(sp?) has had success in the past with Toulouse and Yvette and the chef is from Le Francais so our expectations were pretty high. The space is beautiful.  The front windows open on to the street and frame the large bar area.  It was one of those perfect September nights so it was great to see the people sitting and enjoying dinner al fresco.  The bar itself is a speckled granite done in tones of beige and brown with dramatic down lighting and plenty of seats and little bistro like tables.  I could have lingered there a while longer but our table was ready. We were seated in the dining area which is done in beautiful tones of gold and the seat backs are upholstered in a silk like plaid lending to the overall french feel .  Wall sconces softly light the place and there is enough room between the tables not to feel cramped.  Very lovely.  A perfect place to enjoy an evening with someone special. The menu is not huge but carries some of the traditional french dishes with a little twist.  Case in point the escargot.  While it did come with the traditional garlic butter preparation- they added a tomato and some Roquefort cheese to the preparation and it made for a very good, unique combination of tastes.  The french bread that they kept putting on our plates was perfect for scooping up that last little bit of garlic butter from the snails.   For entrees- you can choose from a variety of  offerings like Salmon, lobster and scallops, steaks, duck or chicken.  I chose the special of the day which was thinly sliced prime rib in a peppercorn sauce served with lyonaise potatoes and fava beans.  My friend took the tourenados of beef which also was good.  The food is artistic looking and prepared perfectly. We were offered our choice of 4 souffles about mid dinner ranging from a hazelnut to a more traditional chocolate but we were full and the idea of dessert while nice- was just too much.  I regretted my decision when two of the souffles were served to the table next to us a moment later.  They looked delicious!  Oh well.  Next time. While the name and menu imply that this is a french restaurant- I would say that it is french with a contemporary twist.  Gone are the overly sauce laden dishes that you normally associate with french cooking and instead, there is just simple foods prepared with an eye toward creativity. All in all- a really nice place for dinner.  And I will be back for one of those great souffle's.",0.9985,0.791,0.193,0.016,0.5053081682627137
