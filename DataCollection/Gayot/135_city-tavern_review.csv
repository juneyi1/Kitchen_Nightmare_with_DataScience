The staff is really friendly  and welcoming, the ambience of the place is like an ancient loft style, kind of rusty and that itself attracts  a lot of folks.

2014-04-13,4.0,"My wife and I decided to take a Saturday evening stroll (a warmer day in Chicago for once).  We were hungry and I thought it would be nice to show her Acadia, so we took a LONG walk down there to find a small paper sign in the window stating that they are closed due to a gas leak.  Wow, I was in a little trouble with the lady.  At the spur of the moment I remembered reading that City Tavern had a new chef.  I had been there a while back shortly after they were renamed (from Grace O'Malley's, I think) and was not pleased with the food at all. I like to give places a second try when possible and so I suggested this and we went for it.  This is a casual dining experience that fits somewhere between Hackney's and the Gage if by chance you are familiar with these spots (so, pub to gastropub).  Our waitress was very good and the beer list also gets kudos.  Now to the food.  We ordered a Caesar salad to share which was delicious, crisp croutons and some kale added to the mix which both held up well to the dressing, so no soggy salad here.  This reminds me, I was told the new chef's name is Caesar.  I had a starter for my main, the mussels.  They were small and sweet (as opposed to large and tasteless) served in a cider sauce that I think included just a hint of mustard.  Included were nice lardon bits, I ate everyone of them.  Also, the mussels are served with two generous toasted pieces of very lightly buttered country bread, excellent for dipping.  My wife ordered the Steak & Frites (she loves steak!), medium rare and it was very good too.  Pre-sliced with a terrific brandy pepper corn sauce.  The only criticism on this is that we would have preferred just slightly closer to rare.  The fries, or ""frites"" in gastropub speak, were good, maybe not the best we've had, but good, nonetheless.   So, if you are in the mood for good food, in a casual environment that isn't a hole in the wall, this might be one to add to your list.",0.985,0.836,0.134,0.03,0.6092887806637808

I ordered my burger medium but what I received was well done.  It was ridiculously greasy on the outside but dry and chewy on the inside.  The lettuce was brown and soggy and the overall presentation was just cheap.  The fries were soggy and way too salty.  Honestly, it was so disappointing that I had to just laugh and throw 75% of my meal away...and I was hungry. I feel like this place is trying to be an upscale bar with a high end menu but they come up way short which is sad because with a new chef, this place could be a gem.",-0.689,0.739,0.12,0.141,0.4505901116427432

I planned to order my appetizer and main dish together so that I wasnt sitting there for another 2 hours. When she came by I started listing off what we were going to order, she stops me and goes oh we dont have half of those items, they are not in season and we are in between menus. UMMM then take them OFF the menu. So I scrambled to pick something else, which was just burgers and fries. She scurried off and brought them over 20 minutes later. I was starving so I ate quickly but she never asked if we wanted a refill or another drink. Maybe she was having a bad day but it really took away from the place.

2014-03-09,3.0,"The atmosphere was very cozy, nice decor, they had a fireplace going on a cold winter day.  The food was very good, I liked the variety on the menu with some more unusual unexpected items.  Our issue was service.  We had a group of 9 and made a reservation. I met some of the group there early for a drink at the bar before we sat down. Now looking back I've learned to always check in when you get there, because when our whole party arrived and we went to tell someone we were ready to sit down they said they didn't have our reservation. They said they were very busy but would figure out a place to put us.  They put us at a table right in the front that was meant to sit 8, so two people had to sit on the corner and straddle the leg of the table.  When we ordered our drinks our waitress forgot to order someone's and didn't check in for a very long time, we had to flag her down.  Then with the food, everything came out except for that same person's two things they ordered, and again we had to flag someone down to remind them and have that brought out.   When the check came, some of us were paying cash and there were a couple credit cards.  It took forever for the waitress to come back to grab our checks we finally flagged down the manager and told him we wanted to pay our bill, and that we'd had a hard time getting what we ordered and getting the waitress to come over all night. He obviously talked to her because when she came over she apologized if we had a bad experience, they were busy.  We said it was fine and asked her to charge the cards what was written and give us change for the cash. She brought the cards back and no change! I understand servers can have a bad night, but after you know you messed up why would you keep the extra cash? We were planning on giving her a decent tip anyways, but after she did that on top of everything else it was pretty annoying.  Honestly, I don't blame the server as much as I blame the manager. He was walking around back and forth right in front of our table by the bar all night and never once looked over to our table or came over to ask how everything was or apologize for not having our reservation and cramming us into that table.  For all of the times we were trying to flag our waitress down for a drink or the food that was missing he should have come over to help instead he was chit chatting with people at the bar and giving them free rounds of shots. When we did tell him about our issues he sent the server over to apologize when he should have been the one to apologize and try to compensate for our poor service.

Found the menu to be quite pricey.  We ordered the Amish chicken, a gem salad and a brussel salad. After we ordered the waitress told us she put the chicken in on a rush since it takes a bit longer. 20 minutes pass and we have no salad, food, or a piece of bread. We asked for bread and the waitress said she could get us some. It was good.  It was now 25 minutes since we ordered. Waitress says that it's going to be another 7-10 minutes and we were panicking since we had 10-15 minutes before we needed to leave. We asked about our side salad and she said she thought we ordered that as an entree. She brought it about 5 minutes later. Still no other food. We asked for more bread and she hesitated and I said I'd pay for it so she brought more. I was actually kidding not thinking they would charge for bread.  I told the waitress we needed to leave and then produced the food. It had taken 40 minutes. The chicken was so salty it was inedible. Same with the brussel salad. We waited 40 minutes for an awful meal. We said we would not be able to eat it and asked for the check.  The manager took those two items off the bill but still charged us for 1 salad and $4 for the bread!! So bottom line, we had bread, a side salad and water and paid $14. Went to the theater starving.

2013-12-08,2.0,"I just moved to Chicago.  This used to be my favorite restaurant.  Been there about 8 times over the last three years.  The last two visits were a complete turn downhill.  New chef, new menu, and less then stellar service.  Biggest complaint is the new menu though.  The amazing burger from before was replaced with a bland burger.  I ordered it hopeful that it would be similar if not even better (since it was a new chef changing a recipe!).  Sadly it was totally bland, and the bun was barely toasted.  I felt like I was sitting at a kids table eating chicken nuggets while the rest of the table had an adult meal.  No flavor.  Totally a let down. The last time I went was a few weeks ago for brunch.  My mom was in town with me and we both got the eggs/hashbrowns/toast breakfast.  We both asked for the eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese, and the hashbrowns crispy.  The waitress said there would be an upcharge for the cheese, although she didn't know how much exactly.  I jokingly said, ""as long as it's not $20, it's fine!"" Fast forward 20 minutes and the food arrives.  The eggs look fantastic but the ""crispy"" hashbrowns aren't even hashbrowns anymore.  They're basically ramen because they've been fried so hard.  It was like eating fried angel hair pasta.  Bizarre experience for hashbrowns. Fast forward another 20 minutes and the bill comes.  Each plate was around $10, as expected, but the cheese on the eggs cost an extra $5 each on top of that!  So it was like a 50% upcharge for a little cheddar cheese!  That's absurd.  They were trying to charge us $10 for cheese in 4 scrambled eggs.  We called the waitress over and she explained it.  She couldn't do anything except approach the chef about it.  We disputed further and the chef allegedly agreed to let her reduce the upcharge to $2.50 per plate.  We said that was fine, paid the revised bill, and left. The eggs with cheese, and the toast were all delicious!  But after the bland burger, the hashbrown incident, and the cheese price gauging - I'm out.  Sorry City Tavern.  I used to love you but now I'm over us.",0.9668,0.866,0.091,0.043,0.4958978675645343

($25 or so together). the 2nd time i had an average ham and cheese sandwich. i don't know what i was expecting with ordering that. my friends have ordered hamburgers, the fish, and had positive results.  anyways it's a safe bet. i don't think it's super amazing, but the food is definitely Not Bad and your meal will probably be under $30 unless you're trying to get plastered.",0.8263,0.72,0.166,0.114,0.4976325757575758
2013-11-04,1.0,"Before I give you my review, let me note: I root for any business to succeed in our little 'hood--City Tavern was no different.  That said, I'm afraid I can't say I'll be returning to CT until I catch wind that the service and operations have been overhauled. Food The food was actually OK.  The menu offered just the right amount of options--all of them tantalizing delicacies.  However, 70% of the items weren't available, so ordering was like some sort of menu roulette.  Lastly, I'll say again: food was OK.  I could be wrong, but I doubt City Tavern is going for OK.  My Bacon and Foie Gras sandwich (you heard right, mmmm) jumped right off the menu, but not off the table, if you know what I mean. Service Unfortunately, this is where I have to take the gloves off.  First, I'll say everyone was nice--no snotty I'm-just-doing-this-until-my-acting-career-takes-off BS.  However, there was no organization or structure to it.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our drinks, 45 minutes for our food, and all in, I'd say we were lucky.  An extended family was seated next to us and waited between 45 and 60 minutes for their food--I say between because each member of the party was served individually and sporadically.  In fact, I never saw any of the servers carry more than one item at a time, or do any kind of multi-tasking at all. So What I'm Saying Is.... I genuinely hope they work the bugs out.  It's a nice place: great atmosphere, full bar, nice (though somewhat rusty) staff.  Until then, head over to Waffles, Eleven City or Little Branch Cafe if you're looking to have some brunch in the South Loop.",0.9755,0.841,0.118,0.042,0.5862213403880072

I must say though, I was pleasantly surprised!  The burger was cooked perfectly and the meat was fantastic.  Make sure you add a fried egg too even though it's not listed as an option!  I also really like the upstairs at City Tavern and would definitely consider it for a private party or event. If I had to have a complaint it would be that the fries aren't nearly as good as when the last chef was around.  They used to be nice and crispy, but now they are thick and kind of mushy.

2013-10-23,3.0,"I was really rooting for you, City Tavern. I thought, maybe the other reviewers were just being stuck up. Maybe they had bad service as a one-off experience. Unfortunately, I thought wrong. This is one of those times where I wish I could give different scores for different aspects of the restaurant. I'd definitely give the food a solid 4. The service? A 2. That brights us smack dab in the middle to the A-OK score of 3.  Upon walking in we were promptly greeted by a very friendly staff. I took a look around, I liked what I saw! My fiance and I sat at the bar while we waited for the rest of my family to get there. I stuck with water, but my fiance got a boozy drink whose name has slipped my mind. We both enjoyed that drink, and didn't mind the $10 price tag. When I got up to use the restroom, the same friendly staff who greeted us at the door helped me find it (it's upstairs). The people I saw on the way gave me nothing but smiles. Then my family showed up. It was about this time it all went downhill.  We were visibly the only table our server had when we sat down. Why it took us over 5 minutes to get our first round of drinks, I'm not sure. Oh well. Let's get an appetizer. The Pimento Cheese spread. I should have listened to another reviewer and just ordered extra house made saltines. We asked for one order for a table of 6. I thought maybe the server would say, ""it's a pretty small order"" or ""would you like some extra crackers?"" or heck, maybe he'd just give them to us! Nope. After what seemed like forever, he dropped off our appetizer. There were about 7-8 crackers in between the size of Fritos and Wheat Thins. Small. When we saw this, we immediately asked for more crackers. We each took one and a couple of us lucky few got an extra half. After 20 minutes, we got more crackers. The appetizer was delicious! It's just impractically small. After all this, we THEN were asked if we wanted to order our food. At this point we were starving.  Our food didn't take any longer than usual. Probably 15-20 minutes. While we waited, we ordered my grandma a decaf coffee. After our food arrived, the manager came up and told us ""I'm sorry, I think your server forgot to brew the coffee. I'll go get it started and it'll just be about 6 minutes."" Sheesh. The guy was super nice, but the server was losing points - fast. Our food was all delicious. I had a lamb special with a carrot and apple puree and an autumn chutney. If this is available when you go, you should get it. My only complaint was that there were some parts that were extremely stringy/fatty and I couldn't cut through them with my knife. Oh well, the rest was awesome. The other favorite at the table was the seafood roll. Really flavorful.  The rest of the night was a mixture of the manager coming back to our table to refill drinks and clear plates, and our server infrequently checking in - completely unaware that he had been inattentive. When we finally ordered a birthday dessert (banana spice cake... it was delicious), our server had to come back 5 minutes later to ask us which one we had gotten. I've just never had a server forget so many things. The manager did partially make up for this by comping the coffee.  TL;DR I'd come back for takeout or to sit at the bar. The food was quite good. I would not bring a large group back to sit down for dinner.",0.9952,0.826,0.124,0.049,0.5079301075268817

It wasn't busy yet everything took forever to receive. We were told that there are some appetizers at the top of the menu that were meant for those who want something right away. It came with house made saltine crackers which the server said he would bring out extra because they normally don't give enough. Well the appetizer that was suppose to be brought right out took a while. Then they literary gave 8 small crackers for this jar of dip. Not nearly enough crackers. The waiter said that the extra crackers are house made again so the additional crackers were coming soon. Wait even longer and he comes out and says they're out so we have wait even longer for some bread instead.  Then we wait even longer for the meals. Much longer then we were informed it would take. We also had to frequently ask for refills of drinks. Then they made a small mistake on one of the kids meals so we just asked for fries for him. They never arrived. We ask for the check anticipating it would also take a while to arrive, which it did. Then the funny part. My brother wanted to pay for the majority of the bill with gift cards he received from the restaurant previously FOR BAD SERVICE. Then they couldn't get the cards to work since they were some of the first cards they ever have out and took them forever to just subtract the amount on the card from the bill and let us leave.

I also had a seasonal bellini that contained grapefruit and rosemary, aka two delicious ingredients.  The bellini was subtly flavored and was very refreshing, although I would have liked it even more if the grapefruit and rosemary had been more in-your-face.

2013-10-10,5.0,"My new neighborhood favorite.  After a few times at City Tavern I can safely say that.  They have a thoughtful unique menu with a great atmosphere.   Last time out we had a phenomenal appetizer of fried fingerling potatoes, obviously the creme friache was the key.  I had the crusted fried walleye with fried artichokes over house made tarter that was really excellent.  Wife had the Lobster roll and I don't think she shared because it was so good.  The tragedy of the late menu makeover is the absence of the mussels with frites and ramp sauce.  Also, I heard the fried chicken was killer.  Perhaps they'll bring these back if I keep asking. :)  But, don't get me wrong, the new menu by the Purple Pig chef offers many good picks.  The atmosphere of the place I enjoy almost as much as the food.  Particularly the bar area which is a seriously comfortable place to hang out and tip a few.  The fireplace lounge area at the windows is begging for cooler weather and a good bourbon.   We meandered upstairs recently also and now I'm looking for an excuse to throw a party in one of those rooms; cool space. *************** Yelp Binge #2",0.9858,0.743,0.202,0.055,0.5143465909090909

Four four of us, we paid over $70 for the following: Two breakfast dishes, which were pretty good for the $9 price tag each carried. A sandwich, with ""breakfast potatoes"" or something as a side - there were something like six pieces of tiny potato.  A $3 side of toast - had to ask for butter and jam A soda, a beer, and two (tiny!) $10 cocktails that we received AFTER we had finished eating (again, we ordered everything at the same time).

Our server, Matthew, was attentive and gracious without being awkward, making our dining experience that much more enjoyable.  The lighting was dim enough to create the necessary intimacy within the main dining room without being too dark.  While I'm not typically too observant of decor, I will note that the bench seating along the back right wall was comfortable, while the restaurant's atmosphere was complimented by the tasteful wooden tabletops. Overall, the entire meal was better than anything I expected to find on Michigan Avenue for the price.  I will certainly revisit City Tavern before the summer is out to enjoy another evening of good beer and food.

I was suggested the omelet by the waitress, and it was also very good and I usually think omelets are cooked wrong in restaurants. In fact, I never even order them anymore, but the waitress correctly insisted that theirs were great. It might have been the best omelet I ever had. really. However, seeing I don't like most omelets there its a good chance those who do might find this one awful. Either way, I would highly recommend it. It was not on the menu however, So if you like omelets I think you might have to just ask for it.

Bartender was really helpful.  My aunt was in from out of town where good beer is hard to come by.  Asked for suggestions from the bartender and he had several and allowed us to sample a couple off of the menu.  Both were spot on.  Have a good selection, probably about 12 drafts available along with numerous bottle selections as well.  The menu is nice because they split the beers up into categories.  Nice touch.  We were mainly here to have a couple beers but got a little hungry while we were there.  We asked the bartender again for some suggestions and he mentioned the flatbreads and added, ""we have the best burgers in the city"".  How many times have you heard that?  Either way a burger did sound good at the time so we ordered the burger and a side of oysters.   OMG BURGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- I don't know what the hell they did to this burger but I have never tasted a burger with so much flavor and I have been to quite a few establishments that are famous for their burgers Prairie Grass up north, Kuma's to name a couple, which were both really good but this burger was Incredible.  Whoever the guy was below that said the burger wasn't that great either went on a bad day or was drunk.  The beef had flavor like it had been aged.  My aunt and I split it and didn't want it to stop. Oysters - I am an oyster nut and these weren't all that great.  Whoever shucked the oysters chipped off a big part of the shell which must have ended up on top of the meat.  Couldn't see it because it was pretty dark in the bar.  Not a very nice surprise.  Mistakes happen but probably will not order the oysters again. Overall I think this is a great neighborhood place.  I would definitely make a trek for the burger if you haven't had it.  Look forward to trying some more items on their menu.",0.989,0.761,0.157,0.082,0.5618006993006993
2012-11-21,4.0,"Came here last week with a bunch of friends because some pretentious individual thinks it's the best burger in Chicago, and said individual is prolific enough at promoting his/her opinion that I found his/her list on a google search (update: that was actually Chicago magazine. Whoops). Can't say I agree, but they do a real good job with it, for sure.  The burger ($14) is about as no nonsense as it comes; on a soft white roll, with sliced red onion, lettuce, and tomato, served with crumbled bacon under a mound of cheddar cheese. I like that they don't overdress their burger for dinner, as the patty is of high enough quality for this strategy to work. Definitely cooked to order also. My one gripe is with the cheese, which I found to be in heinous excess. The burger is served with sweet potato fries or duck fat fried chips, both of which are decadent options.  City tavern also boasts a bomb dessert menu; short and sweet. Pistachio creme brulee ($8) does not reinvent the wheel but is very unique nonetheless; I can't say I've ever seen a pistachio creme brulee on a menu anywhere. It's well-executed, rich, satisfying, and large enough to share. Impossibly dark chocolate cake and coconut cream pie are also winners.  The beer list is great, pricing is appropriate, and service is friendly. The place also manages to keep a neighborhoody feel, which is lost by many restaurants that serve analogous, slightly stuffy bar food.

We used to come here when it was Grace O'Malley's, and while it was a different atmosphere, it seemed like it would be a good time and the menu looked pretty decent.  We ordered a flatbread as an appetizer and were very disappointed. The bread was like a stale cracker, and the entire thing glistened with grease. I wondered if it had been dipped in a fryer, to be honest. Normally when I think of flatbread, I think of it as being a somewhat healthier version of pizza.  My husband ordered the burger, and while yes there is a grease factor in a burger, this thing was DRIPPING grease. The bun was completely soaked through and through with grease. He gave up on it about a quarter of the way through.  I ordered the chicken (I asked the server if I should get the salmon or chicken and he recommended the chicken) and had a similar experience. It was breaded and fried, but it was like it was pulled straight out of the fryer and onto my plate without ever dripping the excess grease. At least the server comped my meal because I was just physically ill from trying to sift through the massive amounts of grease to find any actual food on my plate. The chicken was bland, to boot. No spices that I could detect, but perhaps they were masked by the overpowering flavor of grease. Their beer list was pretty decent, however they were out of 2 of the 3 beers my husband asked for, and they had my beer but ran out after my first glass.  If this were some greasy diner, I'd have expected an experience like this. But it's an upscale bar/restaurant with a seemingly nice menu. The experience did not live up to my expectations at all.

I ordered the zucchini, broc, and tomato quiche, which arrived sans the rosemary panelota promised in the menu. The size of the quiche was ridiculously small, much smaller than a decently sized piece of pie, and the crust had already detached from the quiche before it was set down before me. The ratio of egg to veg was far too large, and the whole thing was tasteless. This dish was mostly side salad--which was far better than the quiche, and not bad, although some of the lettuce was wilted. My partner had the shrimp and grits, which was also badly underseasoned and also not warm enough. He requested toast, which arrived after he had finished his meal. The highlight of the meal was the small order of oatmeal pancakes we shared on the side. They were good, but not great and unattractively presented, with a big glob of jam on one side.

Staff:  All smiles, happy and nice.  Decently attentive, slightly awkward.  Offered recommendations which was nice and ran through the menu with us at the start. Food:  Meh, well to be honest, its pretty average food at best...however, I really think they are trying.  I had the trout and gnocchi and I have to say that the trout was decent.  The gnocchi was DISGUSTING...mushy and oily.  The sauce was good.  Also had the mussels which were pretty good.  The duck fat potato chips need a better dipping sauce than just ketchup.  The salmon was pretty good.  Nothing too special.   Price:  I thought it was small plates and the prices were right on.  Totally reasonable. Drinks:  There was a decently large selection of drinks, however we went with wine.  The thing that annoys me is no chiller for white?  Come on...you should have that.

We had 9pm reservations and were seated immediately.  They had a great selection of beer with  quite a few on tap. We started with the flatbread with apples, bacon and blue cheese. What's not to love? It was thin but not too crispy- just right. I ordered the beef cheeks with taro root purée, carrots and turnips. The beef was so tender and the sauce was bomb. My girlfriend ordered the trout, which was served with the head on and was slightly off putting but she said it was tasty nonetheless. The gnocchi it was served with were grilled and smoky and the highlight of her dish. Our other dining companion got the scallops and said they were awesome.  Service was good, no complaints at all. Others have mentioned the decor and I agree it did not match the vibe at all. It didn't take away from my experience at all, it was just odd.

The restraurant filled up pretty quickly for a Thursday night. Great neighborhood spot. Saw families dining here, couples, as well friends. Although as a parent, I would not bring my child here. This restaurant didn't have food that my 3 year old would gravitate too. This is definiately a place for adults, but I did see at least three tables that had at least 1 child present. JMHO! Service was prompt and polite. Food was excellent. I ordered the mussels for an appetizer, which were very good. The broth was not too rich, but was just right! Had bits of Chorizo in it, which was an interesting twist and my first time eating it. I ordered the scallops. The only thing I would do differently with this entree is ask for less mushrooms. The cream sauce was excellent with the scallops. Husband order the Amish chicken and he enjoyed it. Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake, which was to die for! The drinks were very good! They are adding private dinning space on the second level of the restaurant and an area too for billiards. Sounds interesting.

The drinks are a bit pricey and the bar is kind of small, not one where you can hang out.  This place is more for dinner than drinks and the bar feels like it's a holdover til you get seated.  City Tavern specializes in rums and I had a chance to try a couple - I'm not a connoisseur  but it would be a fun place to try new drinks with quality rum.   City Tavern is a great neighborhood spot and I'll be returning!  Compared to the drinking establishment on the Michigan/14th corner, I'd choose City Tavern over it any day.",0.9693,0.886,0.107,0.007,0.5936363636363637

I felt like the menu and the decor didn't match with the old look of the decor and the ""new"" modern food menu. Maybe that's the point of it all, but it didn't jive w/me.

I think overall this place is still figuring it out...  There were some sound dampening tiles on the ceiling, but I think they need quite a bit more so people can hear the wait-staff, there was the fun game of where's waldo with the  valet (which we lost), and if you're going to have an impressive beer menu, please try to keep it stocked going into the weekend.  With all that said, the food was great, the waitstaff was helpful and this place has a high ceiling.  I look forward to coming back and seeing their progress.",0.9967,0.77,0.196,0.034,0.5324206349206348

In fact- for those that once knew her- you wouldn't even recognize her as she has been reincarnated at City Tavern- a cool, sophisticated bistro in the same location but with none of the worn edges that Grace was getting as she aged. As you pull open the front door- there is a cozy seating area to your left- couches chairs, fresh flowers on the side tables . . .the perfect place to wait for the perfect table or to just enjoy a glass of wine with the cheese plate. What?  There is a cheese plate?  You betcha!  The new menu is lovely full of all my favorites like raw oysters, mushroom risotto with fresh peas, cheese and chacuterie plates.  And those are just the starters!  There is a variety of seafood from trout to whitefish to scallops with mushrooms and cavatelli pasta, as well as burgers, sandwiches and even a pretty decent rib eye. The decor is rich and warm with plenty of dark woods and blue walls.  It just feels friendly and welcoming and the hostess staff works hard to make sure you have just the table you want.  There are even a few outside on the sidewalk which would have been nice if it just hadn't been so hot on the night we were there. We went on a Saturday night and surprisingly- it wasn't too crowded.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and were well taken care of by Louis who did everything right to make us feel like welcomed guests.  They have an extensive beer list but also pour a list of cocktails that will rival any of those fancier places in town. And if you live in the neighborhood- the staff and manager go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  It was almost funny- when they asked if we lived nearby and I said, ""not too far"", the manager moved on to the people next to me who lived across the street and basically talked to them all night.  That manager probably should have noticed that we were eating a full dinner and the other people were just drinking beer but I get that they want to be the ""neighborhood joint"". And if you drive- while parking used to be easy in this neck of the woods- with all the new destinations that seem to pop up everyday, I was happy to see valet parking.  Best $9 I spent that night!  Dinner with appetizers and drinks for two, ran us about $120 but you could easily get away with spending less. If you live in the area- this is a no brainer- as it's one of the nicer places around.  But it's not bad as a destination either.  I'm a big fan of the Firehouse across the street (same owners) so City Tavern is not a stretch for me to become one of my favorites when looking for a casual meal with some pretty great food!

2012-07-23,5.0,"City Tavern is an awesome addition to the South Loop restaurant scene.  I wanted to wait until after my second visit before submitting a review - you know, to see if lighting could strike twice.  It did.  And both trips were quite different... The name ""City Tavern"" is a little misleading.  While the beer list is long and distinguished, the name City Tavern (at least in my opinion) implies this place is more of a bar, than a restaurant.  That is FAR from the case.  My first visit was shortly after Chicago magazine dubbed CT's burger ""the best in Chicago.""  I was intrigued, but also skeptical.  Was this a clever advertising ploy, made possible by a large monetary ""contribution"" from CT to Chicago Mag?  Or was the burger truly something to behold?  I went with a buddy, so we sampled a few beers at the bar before sitting down.  All were bartender recommendations and all were delicious.  After getting a table, we started with the mussels - one helluva appetizer.  I got the burger, of course, and my friend got the pork belly sliders.  We were both thoroughly impressed.  The burger is worth the heavy praise - a striploin burger on a potato bun, with chopped bacon and caramelized onion seared onto the patty by a layer of cheddar.  I'm writing this review at 7am and my mouth is watering... After the very successful first trip, my fiancé and I decided to take some family friends who were in town to CT over the weekend.  We had a group of 7 and were given this great circular table in a little alcove - it was perfect.  This time we went with wine, and although the selection is not huge, I didn't see one bottle listed for over $40.  So everything we tried was very reasonable and everyone enjoyed them.  We started with the deviled eggs, the wild mushroom risotto, and the duck pasta.  All were good, but the duck pasta was my favorite.  My fiancé was partial to the eggs.  Per my glowing recommendation, 3 people at the table got the burger.  They were not disappointed.  I went with the grass fed rib-eye with blue cheese bacon butter.  It was a steal for $19, and I literally used my butter knife to cut it.  Excellent.  Though I didn't taste everything, everyone was extremely pleased with their choices.  All the desserts (and I do mean all - we ordered 5, and there are only 4 on the menu) were great too. Most importantly, the service has been excellent.  I've been lucky enough to get Nicole as a server both times and she's super nice, and very attentive.  I'm stoked to have City Tavern right down the street and will certainly be going back...regularly.",0.9987,0.751,0.213,0.036,0.6378625894802366

2012-07-17,5.0,"It is actually somewhat bothersome to me that City Tavern only has 4 out of 5 stars thus far, review-wise. Yeah, 5 is a lot to ask this early in the game (they've only been open for 2 or 3 weeks I believe), but in my opinion, they're worth it. As an NYC area resident who has spent a lot of time in the Boston and DC areas as well, I feel pretty confident in saying that I've experienced a lot food-wise, but in just a few days, Chicago has proven to me that they have as much, if not more, to offer.  The first time I went, it was just me and a friend. We were mainly in it for the drinks, but the two sandwiches we got (most notably the pork belly sliders) were fantastic. Their drink selection is incredible. An overwhelming number of craft beers, and some of the best mixed drinks I've had (and I'm not even a cocktail person). Our server/bartender, as well as the owner, really went out of their way to offer a number of suggestions of other places to try during our short visit, which was really sweet, given the fact that they knew we were not from the area, and likely couldn't do much to promote the establishment. We enjoyed it so much that we grabbed my other friend and went back again today. This time I went with the beef cheek entree, which was sublime, and my friend tried the award-winning burger, which was equally fantastic. And the chips fried in duck fat are to die for.  To be honest, I don't really know if there's a bad item on the menu, but if I had to guess, I'd say no. Places like this are truly tough to find in NYC, I can say that much. And even if you do find one, it's usually a hipster hangout that's far from approachable.  City Tavern has cultivated a really cool and fun old-timey beverage feel, and coupled it with a great menu, and for that they should be commended. I'm headed back to NYC tomorrow, and I'd be lying if I said I won't miss it here. Chicago has exceeded all expectations, and City Tavern is largely responsible for that feeling. For anyone living in the area, or considering visiting, do yourself a favor and try this place out.",0.9978,0.736,0.219,0.045,0.5138297872340425
2012-07-15,3.0,"Finally another restaurant addition to the South Loop to replace Grace O'Malley's. And it's a major step up from the less-expensive places in the area (especially the bars), but below the high-end prices of its sibling Firehouse across the street. (That's papa bear; this is mama bear.) That having been said, it's at the high-end of the moderate price scale. Elegant decor, while still being casual enough to remain a tavern. Attentive service.  I had a tasty, unique, well-crafted ""Twenty Miles March"" (rye, dry vermouth, Amara and sherry) as a delicious, many-areas-of-the-tongue-involved cocktail; my friends liked the beer selection. We started with one of their tasty flatbreads  (if I remember correctly, with blue cheese, bacon and raw apples--delicious). My burger was heaven in a bun (though perhaps hell in my arteries)--especially the sauce poivrade and the caramelized onions. The duck-fat-fried potato chips were perfectly cooked. My friend loved her trout stuffed with gnocchi and Brussels sprouts.  The only problem--WAY too noisy, even for an early dinner at 6:30 on a Friday night (the end of the old folks crowd. Please add a little sound proofing! I won't be able to go as often as I'd like, if I have to strain to hear my voice-strained friends.

2012-07-15,2.0,"I had a decent experience last night at City Tavern, but will wait for them to work out some glitches before I go back again.  Here is what I encountered last night: Made reservations for later in the evening and was sat right away.  The atmosphere is very noisy.  It was difficult at times to carry a conversation with my girlfriend across the table.  The scene almost becomes a screaming contest to outdo the table next to you.  The noise level reminded me more of a river north bar, than one in the South Loop.  The noise didn't take away from the experience, but the service we received was lackluster and definitely marred our time at City Tavern.   As I said, we were seated very quickly, but it took forever for our waiter to come and greet us.  When he did stop over it was very brief and didn't take our drink orders.  Then we sat and waited for quite a bit of time watching him pick up bills and count his tips.  When we finally ordered our drinks, they took forever to come.  I wouldn't be so upset about this situation, but if you see tables that were seated after you and they are already receiving drinks.....I get a little angry over that fact.   Then the service we received over our menu items was even more shocking.  We ordered an app (deviled eggs) and two entrees (salmon and fried amish chicken) which were very good.  The gripe comes in when we are sitting forever to get the app...and it doesn't come.  We received our entrees even before our app came.  So we turned the entrees away and waited for our deviled eggs.  This was a mistake...The deviled eggs came out shortly after turning our entrees away.  Once we finished the app, the entrees came right back out to our table.  And you could tell that they were just held in a warming tray while we were finishing our app.  I could tell because the gravy that came with my chicken had that nasty film on it already.  And the food was warm, but not pipping hot.  I am not asking for them to remake my meal, but unfortunately it was the restaurant's mistake on the time frame for our orders.   So overall, I have had better experiences at other restaurants, but will give it another chance in a few months when they get the kitchen and staff on the same page.  I am giving it another chance because the food we ordered was really good and there are other items on the menu that I still want to try.   My parting words on City Tavern would be to not go in hungry because you could be waiting a bit and be prepared for the noise.",-0.8718,0.846,0.07,0.084,0.507421768707483
2012-07-14,3.0,"I had previously gone just for drinks and the bar area is very nice. This time for dinner we called ahead and glad we did- it was booked solid till 8:45 pm which is a great sign.  I hope they can keep that up. On the postive side:  Great service- friendly and attentive.  The food was very excellent.  The dessert- chocolate mousse cake- was absolutely fantastic. On the constructive criticism side:  For two people we paid $75- this included  one drink a piece, two entrees, and a dessert.  This isn't bad; however, we both left a little hungry.  My suggestions to alleviate this are: 1. have a small basket of bread when people order- I know you want people to order appetizers etc, but this is a simple item that's not too costly- you could even tried to upsell people by suggesting cheeses that might go with it. 2. The scallops were fantastic; however,  for $19 you should get 4 scallops, not just 3.  Don't get me wrong, they are great, but 3 is just not enough for that price. 3. Salmon with asparagus- again great food!  however, you could provide a small portion of wild rice or potato.  Again wouldn't really cost much to the restaurant, but would really round out the entree and not leave patrons feeling hungry. if you made one or more of the changes I mentioned, I would easily rate this at 4 stars.",0.9912,0.797,0.19,0.014,0.5823633156966491

The cocktails though were awesome - fresh ingredients, inventive and ample size. I'm a sucker for all the little accoutrements they have on the bar to make them as well. A lot of the drinks are rather complicated, so the bartender was a little slow with stuff. It didn't really bother me and I'm a sipper not a gulper, but some other patrons were obviously impatient.

The grilled cheese is very adult and simply  delicious.  The focaccia melts in your mouth it's so buttery good. Yummy! The Amish fried chicken is without a doubt one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had and I'm from the South so I know fried chicken. The different flavors of the chicken, greens, bacon, squash and gravy meld together to make each bite an experience of monumental proportion. Other must have dishes: Deviled Eggs (with smoked salmon...need I say more???) and the Sweet and Sour Brussel sprouts with pork belly.  This place ain't afraid of a little pork!

2012-07-01,3.0,"Good, but too expensive for where the quality of the food currently is. You're basically paying Girl & the Goat or Publican prices for food that's decent, but by no means exceptional. Yes, all the plates are under $20, but they are also pretty small, so you'll need several to fill up. Specific comments: 1) Grilled wild salmon was exceptional. Highly recommend, and at $16, the price is actually decent.  2) Wild mushroom & crispy kale flatbread: ok. The mushroom topping was good, the flatbread texture was best described as limp. The kale was not crispy. Overpriced at $9 (it's pretty small). 3) We did a combo of three meats and cheeses, and where underwhelmed. The meats were ok (the pork rilletes didn't taste too much of anything, the hunter's salami was good); the cheese was excellent. However, the portions were laughable, given that you just paid $15 for the plate, and the bread served with the plate had been toasted for some time before it got to us, so was cold and limp in texture. There are so many restaurants that offer really great meat and cheese boards, with imaginative additions (pickled vegetables, mustards, complementary toppings, etc) and really high-quality bread - City Tavern does not. Literally all you get is your meat, your cheese, and some old bread. If this were a $9 plate, I'd be ok with that. For $15 bucks, I expect more (and get more at plenty of other places). Fantastic beer selection, nice atmosphere and great service. I could see us coming back here for drinks, and maybe the sandwiches. Unless things change (quality goes up a ton, or prices come down), we won't be doing the other food again.",0.9963,0.799,0.193,0.009,0.5604100529100529

Let's get the bad part out of the way first:  The staff seems a little unfamiliar with everything and food took a little longer than most places to get out, but they did just open last week so I can overlook that. now for the good stuff!: Pork belly sliders with sweet potato fries=awesome would get it again.  They have a formidable craft beer selection on tap which is a plus, wild onion please and thank you. I tried one of their house cocktails, ""Medford Buck"" a sort of rum spin off of a Moscow Mule served in the same copper cup, perfect for summer time! The atmosphere is definitely reminiscent of the historical pubs on the east coast in towns like old town Alexandria, which is the look I believe they are going for. In fact, if it weren't for the modern flooring and electrical fixtures, and everyone was dressed in colonial era garb you might be able to convince me that I went back in time. The crowd seemed pretty relaxed and I got a nice comfortable feeling that this a place I can go just to have a beer and be left alone if I want!

The hostess was very friendly.  Sat at the bar while waiting for the table (20 min wait for a table for 2, not bad).

It was such a beautiful night that we walked home and kind of thought of City Tavern as we approached it. We were dubious that they would be serving food as late as it was but were welcomed with open arms. Our busser was cute and earnest, our waiter was super helpful and friendly and even the manager came over to chat and ask us how we were enjoying ourselves to that point. The beer list is absolutely dizzying and they also have a pretty long list of spirits and some boutique wines. The space itself is meant to evoke shades of Ben Franklin-era taverns, so it is very dark and woody, with almost Victorian-like wallpaper on one wall. The bar area is very inviting and we were relieved that it wasn't completely overrun with people. In any case, the bartender and waiter introduced me to a type of beer with which I wasn't familiar and I'm a new fan. My husband got a Flywheel. Nearly every state that produces beer is represented on this menu and as well, they have four or five rye whiskeys available. As far as food is concerned, I got the seafood pie that as one other yelper noted, contains hard-boiled eggs. That isn't listed on the menu, so I was kind of surprised since I'm not really a huge egg fan. But the rest of it was tasty-- most of this is pretty hearty fare, better suited for a January night maybe, then a warm June evening. But I noticed flatbread on the menu and I plan to have that next time! My husband had the grilled cheese but felt that the ricotta overpowered it.
