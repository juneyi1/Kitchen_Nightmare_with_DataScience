2007-10-11,5.0,"Well I have never dined there but I have been there for the nightclub. I have to say it was a great night. The prices for drinks are expensive but the ambience more than makes up for it. It has a funky type of mood. And for my hip hop people Tuesdays are the night to be there. The people are beautiful. The service is great. The dance area downstairs is big enough to get the job done. I even ran into a celebrity. The great man himself, Michael Jordan.",0.9782,0.752,0.233,0.016,0.6312500000000001

2007-07-20,4.0,"I was here for NYE 07'.  Tickets were about $125 each.  Open bar (top shelf) for six hours, plus hor` dourves and some other junk.  Memory loss.  I think they had a dinner package, little more $ on top of that ticket. Lots of pretty women.  I assumed from reviews people dressed to impress.  Women dressed.  Dudes however.  Its freakin' NYE, can't you get dressed for one night?  Narcisse is tiny.  Two floors, hardly any room to move when its packed.  Dancing? again, no space for that if its crowded.   Main floor is a few tables in the front, a long bar to the back, booths just across from the bar.  One NYE keeping a booth all night was expensive.  I mean, $$$.   A couple occupying a booth.  You have it for dinner.  To keep it the rest of the night you should buy a bottle. Another say.. $250.  Take a group, easier on the cost.  They supply the mixers.  A few annoyances, bouncers need to direct traffic.  Once big ass groups accompany an area, good luck moving any which way.   Bartenders, clean off the bar! six hours of open bar.. if no ones hand's are on the drink, get rid of it.  There were plenty of spills.  Two stuck up bartenders that wouldn't come near a spill area.  How about you work for that tip, lazy bastards. This reaction causes the action of, wasted time, waiting for another drink.  People are leaning, standing, slouching, and conversating on the bar, you can't even reach the bar to get a drink.  I would hold up a few $20s, that got me ahead of everyone.   This ""roofy"" rumor.  When checking out reviews about Narcisse I'd read Miss N.'s review, I also caught a similar review on another website.  It seems a lot of women have been roofied here.  Its dimly lit inside.  Ladies, watch your drinks! I'm surprised how many people leave a drink sitting somewhere and then come back for it, later on?! That same evening, while having a drink with a pretty grad student, she'd joked. ""I hope there isn't a roofy in this"".  I know she was joking.  But, that shit bothered the fuck out of me.  Bars with a roofy history make everyone look bad.  Btw, people that use roofy's, WTF are you doing?? Fuckin idiots.   Four stars: Narcisse can be a good ""dressy up"" time on SOME nights.  Maybe a night to impress a date for dinner (date better be impressed, its expensive.) or meet some friends for a drink after work.",0.5013,0.793,0.106,0.101,0.49370155038759694
2007-07-18,4.0,This was a great 21st celebration place to go with parents for an expensive dinner.  I loved the decor and ambience and service was great. They doted on us and were around but not intruding.  Definitely recommend for smaller groups.,0.2495,0.716,0.164,0.12,0.5714285714285714
2007-05-20,4.0,"My friend threw her birthday party here on Cinco de Mayo.  Because of that, they were offering five dolla margaritas, so that was a pretty good deal!  However, regular priced drinks are on the pricey side.  This place is pretty small and narrow, but, luckily, it wasn't TOO crowded when we were there.  Oh, and the music was a good hip-hop/old school house mix.  One interesting thing about this place is that the bathroom had NO lights, but instead had alot of candles on the floor.  I don't know if the lights were temporarily OUT or if that was part of the decor.  Whatever the case, that's a freakin' fire hazard, especially for drunk girls.  I hope they re-think that whole idea.",0.9305,0.74,0.186,0.074,0.6508547008547009
2007-04-09,1.0,"Narcisse, what happened? I used to like Narcisse.  A lot.  When it first opened, it had a warm elegant feel, served all manner of champagnes, small plates, and desserts.  Then later it changed a bit, became a true dining destination, when I also think it lost just a touch of its class in decor and ambiance as it embraced the faux lux look where everything felt a bit cheap, but I still quite liked it overall.  Now, it's been about three years since I'd been there, and after one trip back I'm afraid it seems that it's gone completely generic. I recently visited on a Saturday night.  There was a $15 cover, yet another series of price hikes in drinks ($20 for a glass of good non-vintage champagne), and fairly lame dance music that was played at nightclub levels.  And, as I stared into the crowd, and didn't know what to make of it.  My past experiences with Narcisse were that it was filled with ""the beautiful people"" so it was kind-of fun to hang out and people-watch.  But now who seems to come? That night, my date commented that it looked like it had been invaded by Schaumburgians hanging out on their one big night in the city. Imagine packing in lots of nearly identical-looking people; short slightly stocky guys with untucked striped shirts and a bottle of beer in their hand, talking to women in their one slightly-shiny ""night out"" top and ass-flash-wear low-rider jeans... and you're praying *not* to catch a glimpse of the thong or, heaven forbid, actual butt cleavage because their abundance is spilling over the tops of their jeans. Oddly, it was also an esteem-building experience.  I'm 5'11"" and think of myself as about average height, but it was like it I was attending a convention of short dull men!  As I stood near the back, I realized I could quite literally see over the heads of virtually everyone in the room, like I'd walked into an eighth-grade class.  Is there something in suburban water that stunted the growth of these guys?  And as I walked through the room to leave, there were a lot of men leaning over into women as they yelled ""WHAT?"" into each others' ears trying to communicate over the thunderous thumping dance music that inspired no one to dance.  The women's eyes darted back-and-forth among each other with that obvious ""please come over here and save me from this guy who's nearly touching me"" look.  And the men were too drunk to notice. Bartenders were absolutely great, but table service was fairly poor. So Narcisse, I ask you, what are you?  The high-end champagne and caviar salon that you were birthed as?  A nightclub drawing from the suburbs?  A casual elegant lounge?  A romantic dining destination that would make any woman swoon by just walking through the door?  A swanky bar?  A true fine dining destination?  A pretend steakhouse but not really?  A minier-tinier-worserer version of a non-existent faux lux Excalibur room?  A dance club aimed at tourists?  A specialty private event destination?  A corporate meeting draw?  A pre-theater good-enough dining destination?  I ask because I think you're trying to be do all these things, attempting to be all things to all people, and never stopping to figure out if you can pull any of it off anymore.  Have you really fallen so low that you're not actually a cool place anymore, but instead milk this last dull crowd for every dollar before failing at everything and needing one more reinvention? There's still a soft spot in my heart for this place, so I probably will be back once they make up their mind, regardless of what they settle on.  But for now... Generic.  Unfun.  What happened?",0.9955,0.792,0.146,0.063,0.4206060606060606

I was very excited to go to narcisse after seeing their website. my husband and I went on a tuesday evening around 7, to our surprise, there were only one other couple in the entire restaurant. The ambience was nice. The appetizer was above avarage (eventhough they were out of caviar that night). But I have to complain about the lobster bisque...way too salty. The lobster mashed potato that came with the filet mignon was also too salty. I don't think I'll be going back for dinner.",0.3693,0.865,0.081,0.054,0.6343749999999999
