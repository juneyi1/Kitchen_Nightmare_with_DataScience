2017-08-13,5.0,"Went on a Friday night and sat on the patio. Perfect night for a late dinner. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our order included the kale salad, swordfish, beet salad and chicken empanada. Everything was tasty and came out timely. I love how they have wine flights and after a few suggestions, I ordered 2 white wines as tasters and one in particular paired perfectly with my meal. Our waiter was very attentive. Also, he gave little cards that showed what the name of the wines were, what they pair with and where to buy full bottles/pricing. This restaurant seems great for big dinners (they have a private sectioned off room), girls night out or cozy date night (cute tables and chairs on patio).",0.9531,0.877,0.123,0.0,0.6005208333333334

2017-07-05,2.0,"I had such high expectations, as I had been eager to try out this restaurant... On a much needed day off, I arrived for lunch, quickly seated, as there were not many patrons at the time. Seated in the patio area as requested. I ordered a very flavorful, crisp Chardonnay. Very tasty. Ordered the calamari as a starter and the chicken sandwich as my main (at the recommendation of my server). For some odd reason, the chicken sandwich came out first. No bueno. A starter is a starter is a starter. I envisioned myself sipping on my wine and eating the calamari until the main dish arrived. Requested that the chicken sandwich be sent back, as it would get cold. There was no debate. I was accommodated. Calamari arrived shortly thereafter. The calamari was not good at all (very disappointing, as I found myself just nibbling on crispy batter instead of calamari) though the aioli was very tasty. Fries were a nice, crisp bite. The chicken sandwich looked like the same one I sent back, though I was assured that it would be prepared fresh (Maybe, it is just my paranoia). I am a Southern girl, so I am always pretty harsh to critique fried chicken anywhere. Indeed, the skin was crispy as the menu indicated. Some parts were burnt. The chicken was cooked well in sense the meaty parts were neither under or overlooked. The biscuit was a bit much. I blame myself.  Too much to indulge in for the light lunch I planned. I was really hungry when I ordered since I skipped breakfast, anticipating a great lunch (not so much). Anywho, the biscuit was not bad...some parts a little grainy; others, nice and flaky. It had a fairly nice buttery, honey flavor though not evenly distributed. The complimentary little snickerdoodle cookie was a nice touch. It was the perfect texture and bite. Quite yummy. My server was pleasant; however, nothing was exceptional about the service. Overall, sorely disappointed. I am more disappointed by the dining experience than the 50 bucks wasted. I MAY come back for the wine; I doubt that I will order food; perhaps if anything, a cheese plate.",0.9495,0.797,0.125,0.078,0.5429245283018866

2017-06-23,3.0,"Have visited here twice now, once for a private corporate event and then again to try the happy hour menu. Food at the first dinner was a preselected menu with a choice of either fried chicken or steak. The steak was plated very lightly but the chicken was a hefty portion which was cooked perfectly; tender inside yet crunchy skin. The base has a small yet diverse craft beer selection with a specially brewed IPA from Temperance that is sometimes on the menu, apparently seasonally. Their smoked Old Fashioned was also excellent. Unfortunately in our second visit I found a metal staple in a cooked potato, we were overcharged for one of the dishes, and the Brussels sprouts came out very burnt. Our servers remedied all of this immediately and apologetically by re-serving fresh dishes and even removing them from the bill. That said, the food was mostly just OK. Is a nice place to sit outside for a few drinks and order from the happy hour menu but nothing outstanding aside from a few of the drinks. As we were seemingly the only table not doing wine flights and cheeses we are probably not the target audience either.  Given the value for the happy hour menu it's almost 4 stars, and may climb to that if we visit again to try several of the other dishes.",0.9855,0.821,0.149,0.03,0.5779920634920636

2017-05-21,5.0,"What an exceptional dining experience! This is a cute wine-based, American restaurant with a lot of offer! And it was definitely bustling on a Saturday night!  This restaurant is all about the wine and cheese (my kinda place)! My fiancé and I each ordered a wine flight. While they have pre-organized flight combinations, you can also ""build"" your own, which is exactly what we did in order to get to try as many different varieties and flavors! All of the wine comes with informational cards about the flavors, where it's from and then how much it is to buy a bottle of, which is really helpful. This is the same for the cheeses. They come in pre-organized flights but you can ""build"" your own, which is once again what I would recommend in order to get a good variety of soft vs hard; cow vs goat; stinky vs creamy cheeses!  We also ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse which was phenomenal, as well! While we did want an order of the mussels, we were pleasantly surprised when the owner, Enoch, was brutally honest with us and told us the mussels weren't cooking correctly and he didn't want to serve them to us. It's refreshing to see someone be so honest and really want to make sure that his restaurant is serving the best that it is capable of! We settled for the scallops which was a delicious (and graciously comped) substitution!  We ended the night with Enoch bringing us some delicious wine and talking about his life, family and business with us.

The shrimp raviolis were better, but still lacked the punch of herbs or seasonings.  Rather bland When I walked into the restaurant, the greeting/welcome was less than stellar.  The interior of the restaurant was hot - so everyone was sitting outside except for a couple folks at the bar.

2017-05-15,3.0,"We picked this place for mothers day. They did an all you can eat buffet featuring Suckling Pig ""Caja China"" and more Service: When we entered we were promptly seated at our table and given menus. Our waiter took a minute to find us but after sitting without knowing what was next he let us know our next steps. As we were eating we were not visited often by our waiter, often we had to try and flag him down. It wasn't the best service experience given the limited number of patrons and the relatively low amount of work needed for a buffet style presentation. Food: This was by far the biggest disappointment. The lemon ricotta pancakes were great however everything else left you wanting to eat elsewhere. For $50 per person, you would have assumed you would get food with flavor. The suckling pig was very dry, bland and unappetizing. The rest of the food lacked flavor and was hard or cold. The biscuits and gravy begged for a softer biscuit and to be warm. We ordered the flight of mimosas and were VERY disappointed for $15 2/4 were not pleasant to drink (we could have just had a V8) Environment: The restaurant is beautiful, table presentation all very pretty.

Arrived a little late and was seated immediately, but that is where the positive experience ended. Place was maybe half full. Was seated in the corner and waited 5 -10  minutes for my dining companion to arrive, during which no server ever came to the table. After my friend arrived we chatted a bit and looked at the menu, still no service. After about 20 minutes i saw a waitress at another nearby table and then loudly commented to my friend i wondered how much longer we would have to wait, and finally a server came and took our drink order. We told her we needed a little more time to decide on food and she left, which was fine. Another server brought our drinks (we each ordered a flight of wines) and silently placed them in front of us, no hello, no explanation of the flights, we thanked her and she silently walked off.... weird. By this point we've decided on food and put our menus down at the edge of the table, hoping that would be a sign to our server we were ready to order . But alas, she didnt return or make eye contact with us for another 20 minutes. When we were finally able to get her attention we told her we would no longer be ordering food, as the lack of service was not acceptable to us.

I ordered a flight of Italian Reds while my wife went for the Rose' flight. We do like the way the flights are presented for light to bold, not sure how bold your going to get on Rose' but there was a noticable differance in tastes.

My experience here was awkward from start to finish. The host at the door seemed caught off guard that we just wanted wine and cheese, and not necessarily an entree. Our waiter (who was either in training or was training someone else) seemed to have a difficult time articulating the menu. By the time we left an hour later, 5 different people(!) had stopped by to serve us in one capacity or another. One person took our orders, two filled waters, one brought food out, and one brought the wine out. It was odd.  The menu tries to be as well rounded as it can, and on paper it succeeds. In practice, however, we found the flavors to be dull and mild. The wine was decent but not fantastic, the meats were middle of the road, and the cheese was only a hair better than what I could get at a place like Whole Foods.

Some bakers can miss the creamy consistency brûlée should have. I've had tried some with spongy custard texture. Bin 36 did well preparing it more creme and sweet. 10/10 (3) Foraged mushroom tart.

It was my favorite place to bring out of town guests. But I've been here a few times since they opened and have mostly been disappointed.  Today I ordered a burger for lunch to go. I called around 12:40 PM and the guy said to give it 15 minutes. So I came down at 1 PM and paid and the girl at the hostess stand said ""Katie?"" and I said no. And then she asked if I had a burger well done with extra ketchup. Still no. So then she just rang me up and said my burger would be right out. The place was very crowded with people waiting for their takeout orders. (The $8 lunch specials are a really great deal, as long as you don't get the salads, which are TINY and not even worth $4.) Around 1:15 (so 30+ min since I placed my order), the hostess came out with a few orders. She had to open the containers since there were no tickets. She opened the one and said it was a ""grilled burger?"" And I asked ""is that not your normal burger?"" And she didn't really answer, apparently not knowing. But it was a burger, I ordered a burger, so I took my food back to my office. I got to my desk and got ready to eat and when I opened the box with the burger, I saw not a burger, but a grilled chicken sandwich. I'm still so confused how the hostess confused a chicken breast with a burger, but she did. I took it back down and told the woman what happened and she just took it back and said I should wait for my burger. No apology, no nothing.  About 10 minutes later, I got my burger, checked right there in the restaurant to make sure it was a burger, and was on my way. The burger itself was half raw, half well done and the cheese wasn't even melted. Overall, pretty disappointing, even for $8. I was not the only one who waited a long time to get their food. The lobby of the restaurant was about 5-6 people, all waiting over 30 min for their orders.

Fast forward to last Tuesday, when I stumbled onto the West Loop location after leaving book club at Open Books. The stars had aligned, as I happened to look down Jefferson Street and recognized the sign. From the looks of it, there is outdoor seating, but the weather wasn't up to par, so the covers were still on tables and chairs. As luck would have it, I could sign up for an app, Wisely, with which the restaurant had partnered. For my troubles, I got a free glass of Prosecco, definitely the right way to cap off a long day. I ended up staying for a sample of the rose wine and some cheese--I tried the Humboldt Fog.  It looks like this place is going to be a hard habit for me to break, as I stopped by later that week, on Friday evening, before a panel discussion in the neighborhood. This time I ordered food--the fish of the day (salmon) which came with a pea puree and beets. The fish was excellent although the beets were slightly underdone. The Van Duzer Pinot Noir, while one I'd tried before, was a great complement to the dish. The food menu includes wine pairings and the wine is cross-referenced to the food, which is very helpful when choosing among the selections. I sat at the bar which was convivial without being claustrophobic. The cocktails looked good, unfortunately I arrived too late to take advantage of these happy hour specials (specialty cocktails and nibbles).  This is not esoteric stuff, as one will find at other West Loop spots, but sometimes a person just craves well-executed, recognizable food. This accessible approach to food and wine has made a fan out of me. I will certainly be adding this spot to my rotation.",0.9936,0.812,0.157,0.031,0.5340343915343915

Also ordered two wine flights the ""I love cheese""(because it seemed like a safe bet considering cheese was ordered) and ""we love italy"" all were great and came with small descriptions which help in placing the flavor profile and scents. Since the cheese flight was quite a bit we split one entree. We ordered the Roasted Amish Chicken - braised collard greens, smoked scarlett runner beans, heirloom grits, pan gravy. This was amazing the flavor profiles were perfect, the chicken was tender, the greens perfect, grits amazing,  the only negative is the consistency on the beans some were slightly under cooked but pretty much on the cusp. For dessert we had the Arroz con Leche - churros and dulce de leche ice cream. These flavors were great but  the churros were still doughy and the rice was undercooked more crunch than al dente.

I had the pork chop dish which was served with sweet potatoes and rapini (if you're not sure what rapini is just imagine if broccoli and collard greens made a baby... Yes, it's just a delicious as it sounds). The pork chop was deliciously fatty but probably not the most attractive dish to order on a date. I had a lot of chewing to do.  My date ordered the roasted Amish chicken.  I don't remember what all was on his plate because he ate it so quickly. Needless to say, he really enjoyed it.

Since I tend to be a deal-seeker, I appreciated this...as I always tip on the full amount anyways! BIN 36 seems like the type of place that probably gets most of its business during the loop lunch hour or corporate events. It's a beautiful and large space that is nicely done without trying too hard. Our weekend brunch experiences here have truly blown me away. The food menu changes by the season and everything is presented so well. We have tried multiple brunch things on the menu and they have all been good. It's nice because there's a variety of types of brunch food ranging from fancy toasts to sweet entrees like ricotta pancakes and hearty entrees such as shrimp and grits or eggs benedict. I had a mimosa flight and my husband had a bloody mary flight and they were fun and very yummy! The service at BIN 36 was exceptional both times. Our server was extremely professional and really tended to our needs. She asked us questions at just the right time and provided great, timely, friendly service.

2016-01-05,5.0,"I'll start out this review by saying I have absolutely no idea where these negative reviews are coming from. My sister and I were a bit weary about coming here after reading some of the reviews, but I'm very glad that our experience was nothing but positive. We arrived on time for a reservation at 6pm on New Year's Day. The hostess was quick to seat us, happy to see us, and was sure to seat us at a table that was far from the drafty, Chicago-wind riddled front doors. It was chilly, and much appreciated! It was only a moment or two later that we were given our water. We saw the owner walking around, but didn't get to talk to him.  Our server, Roberto, was awesome. He was nice and attentive without the feeling that he was hovering or watching us. He was sure to ask how things were, and if we needed anything. He was very patient as we sat for a rather long time deciding on what appetizers to order, and gave recommendations that weren't the most expensive options (as many servers do).  We started off with two drinks, both of which were $7 because we happened to have our reservation during happy hour. My sister enjoyed her Whiskey Sour, and I had a Sweet Sinner, which was elderflower liqueur and lemon juice. It was fantastic (and dangerous) because it tasted like a lemon shake-up. No complaints here! We finally made decisions for what to start with. We decided to have the Charcuterie flight ($32), which samples all of the charcuterie options on the menu. It included rabbit pate, bourbon and apple chicken liver mousse, smoked ham, bresaola, and pheasant terrine, as well as the standard accoutrements . I really enjoyed all of the offerings, but my favorite was the chicken liver mousse. With the sweetness of the apple, and the crunch of it as well, it had a nice clean taste that wasn't too gamey, and a nice texture.  We also had the BIN 36 cheese plate, which is comprised of whatever cheeses the chef desires. Ours included two goat cheeses, and four cow cheeses. They were hit and miss; I know that's the risk you take when you get a flight, especially a mystery one! I really enjoyed the Pleasant Ridge Reserve out of Wisconsin. There was also a wine gelee that was absolutely outstanding.  My only complaint about the flights was the bread crisps that were served alongside the meats and cheeses weren't ideal for the spreading of things. They were delicious but delicate, so it made it a bit hard to spread the mousse/pate.  We also got the Roasted Bone Marrow ($18, I believe) as a starter. It was the first time either of us had had it, and it was amazing. It had a great flavor to it, and the maple butter on top gave it just the right amount of sweetness. The garlic marmalade wasn't okay, but I didn't need it for this course. The marrow was good enough on its own. Then we moved on to our entrees, both of which hover around the $30 mark. My sister loved her house aged strip, which came with smashed potatoes and a bordelaise sauce. She was kind enough to let me try it, and that sauce was amazing; a good balance of sweet and savory. The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I myself had the roasted rohan duck, which came with a blood orange reduction, charred cipollinis, caramelized rutabaga, and salsify. This was my first time having salsify, and it was pretty good. The char on the onions made them delicious. I initially thought my duck was a bit on the rare side, but I rolled with it and trusted the chef; I'm glad I did! The skin was crispy and delicious, and the meat was tender. I wish that there had been a bit more of the blood orange, but that's really grasping at straws for complaints.  Finally, we got desserts. My sister has a cinnamon allergy, so she vicariously lived through me this course. She got a creme brulee which was really good. It was super light and fluffy, which was nice. I had the Arroz Con Leche (rice pudding). It came in a caramel cage topped with caramel, two mini churros, dulce de leche ice cream, and speculoos cookie crumbles. I am a sucker for anything speculoos (cookie butter anyone?), so I was sold. I literally cleaned my plate. The ice cream was sweet and creamy, the churros were soft and airy inside with just the right crisp on the outside. Everything complimented one another, and it all went into my face. No shame in my game. I'd love to come back here in the summer. There's a nice outside seating area that we obviously couldn't use in January. I'd come back here again in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a cheap place, this isn't it. But it's very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get, and for the downtown location and chill, relaxing ambiance. Clean bathrooms, attentive staff, and great food. What more can you ask?",0.9996,0.732,0.222,0.046,0.663160458903033
2016-01-04,5.0,"A solid 4.5 stars, but that's not an option and I don't want their average to suffer. We came for an early dinner on New Year's Day, and it was a delightful dining experience. I'll admit I hesitated for a moment after reading some of the negative reviews, but then i considered the sources.  If you are looking for quick, this is not for you. If you are looking for a $10 anything, this is not for you. This restaurant is for those with an appreciation for the true experience of dining, thoroughly enjoying their company and each course.       We were greeted immediately and taken to our table (we had a reservation). Service was outstanding - plates were cleared, water constantly filled, the wait staff was constantly assessing our needs without the feeling that they were rushing us or hovering. Our waiter Roberto was quick to make recommendations on apps and was very pleasant as well as attentive. The owner was on-site and seemed to bounce from table to table checking on guests. A little weird that he did not visit our table, but I'll try not to take it personally.      We came with the intention of a leisurely multi-course meal and drinks. We started with the Bin36 cheese flight, charcuterie flight and roasted bone marrow. The cheese flight was as expected, some hits some misses. The cabernet gelee was a delightful addition to the chevre. The only problem we found was that the ""crostini"" that came with both flights while crispy and a welcomed contrast in texture, was far too delicate to hold any cheeses or meats. A more sturdy crostini or lavash would have been much more enjoyable.The charcuterie flight was delicious, rabbit, pheasant, chicken liver, ham, yum!  The star of the night, however, was the roasted bone marrow with smoked maple butter and roasted garlic marmalade. I cannot express my joy at this dish. Smooth, melt in your mouth delicious with just a hint of sweet. This will be a staple each time I return.       For a entree I went with the house aged strip loin. It was cooked to perfection and the  charred romanesco and house made mashed potatoes were pleasurable as well. My sister went with the roasted duck. She seemed quite pleased with the crispy sear and we both enjoyed our first ever bite of salsify.       Dessert for me was the creme brulee. Smooth with a thick brulee. More on the whipped fluffy side than the rich creamy custard side, but enjoyable none the less. And my sister enjoyed the arroz con leche while I enjoyed the heavenly fragrance of the accompanying  churros!  Throw in a couple of house special drinks and a lovely time was had by all.     Any time I look up a menu on the website and notice no prices, i get a little nervous, flashing back to my dad's old saying ""if you have to ask, you can't afford it.""  Not the case here. 2 drinks, 2 flights, an additional app, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and our bill was just under $200.  I consider it quite a bargain for the quality and the zip code. I will be sure to visit BIN36 again whether for a full dinner or wine and bites before or after a show.  Well done guys :)",0.9987,0.744,0.205,0.051,0.6134268509268509

2015-11-18,3.0,"First off, the good: their wine flights.  Priced about the same as a glass at any of the other fancy wine bars that have invaded the West Loop, these flights are serious business.  They fill the glasses with a decent pour, and you get 4 solid wines for like $15-20.  Win? Win. Also good, the cheese flights.  Again, very reasonably priced, with the usual accoutrements of crisps, jam, sliced apples, etc.  Again, very solid. Now the bad: the food.  As many other reviewers indicated, the portions are small.  And with such small portions, you'd expect a delicate balance of flavors and textures.  Not exactly.  I feel like the perfect duck has a nice crisp 'confit-style' skin, with slightly medium meat.  Here, the meat was perfectly medium, but unfortunately so was the skin.  With 4 tiny bite sized pieces over some undercooked grains, it just wasn't worth $29.  Same with their burger.  A solid burger, but an $18 worthy burger.   Overall, we would only probably come back for pre-dinner drinks and cheese plates.",0.9325,0.798,0.156,0.046,0.4807619047619048

They even put a full cheese plate down on our table, and then discovered it wasn't ours, so they picked it up, walked around a corner, and then walked right back and put it on the table next to ours. We hadn't touched it, but still...I thought it was common practice that once a dish is on the table, it's served, and not able to be served to someone else?

Service was really good and I especially appreciated them doing some parts of the dishes on the side to accommodate some of us sharing food and having different tolerances for spicy, dairy, etc.. The wine flights were interesting, but I also thought there was a lot of complication on the menu ($3.22 for this pour, $4.16 that). Just charge flat prices.  We had the brussels sprouts (good, heavy handed on the cheese), lobster roll (really overlooked seafood and bland), peaches with cheese (okay, but expensive for what was served), and pork (freaking amazing with the perfect cook on the meat).

2015-09-03,1.0,"My friend and I just had a very surreal experience here and MUST share it with the world.  We come in with reservations for lunch on a Thursday. Get seated right away since there is literally only one other table dining in the restaurant. The server greets us almost immediately and though a very seemingly nice girl, she stood at our table going on and on about wines and cheeses when we were clearly just there for lunch (wearing our work ID's around our neck, and all). I understand this process for dinner but to go into such a long shpeel for lunch hours, is unnecessary since most of us that work in the area are on a tight one-hour lunch time allowance. We order the brussels sprouts and two cobb salads. The brussels sprouts came out first and were amazing. The taste was awesome. After this appetizer, we were so excited for our next course! When our salads came out to our table, we literally laughed for a second, then the laughter turned into shock then pure anger. The size was incredibly small - like a side salad at a fast food restaurant. The presentation was HORRIBLE. There was a speck of dressing at the bottom of very pale, light green, sad looking romaine lettuce. They added a few pieces of bacon, 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg, one slice of pepper, and LITERALLY four tiny pieces of chicken to this ""cobb salad"". At a hefty lunch price of $12 per salad, I just couldn't bare to accept this non-sense as my meal. My friend was equally mad.  We asked the server to get the manager. The manager (Enoch) came out and the first thing he said was, ""hello ladies, I understand you are mad."" First of all, that is not how you approach an already mad customer! You say, ""Hi ladies, what can I do for you?"" or ""what seems to be the problem?"" You just don't come in the scene and assume what someone's feeling.  I asked him if he thought the portion was too small and he said, ""no, it is fine."" Maybe for a bird, guy, maybe for a bird! I explained that there are many other restaurants nearby, even Chicago Raw in the French Market, with bigger and better salads at $10 each, instead of this joke for $12. I told him that we did not want the salads anymore and he said that's fine and collected our salads from the table. He didn't offer to fix the problem, he didn't offer to get us something else, nothing. He could care LESS that he had two unhappy customers. At that point, I told him that it's unfortunate that he runs business like that because I highly doubt he will make it with that attitude and those laughable portions.  Then to top it off, I left the amount of the brussels sprouts ($8) plus $4 on the table in cash and left right after the manager took our salads. Our Chatty Cathy server came RUNNING after us after we were already down the block yelling, ""ladies, you didn't pay your bill!"".... I yelled back, ""I left cash on the table!""  What..... the .....?????   She must've felt really crunchy there, huh!? Overall, my incredibly honest advice is to avoid this place like the plague. There's a reason they're on groupon and trying to get business in. They are horrible. I walked my happy self to Raw and got a giant salad for $10.

The restaurant gives you the option to sit outside and it's quite lovely. We ordered the ham prosciutto, artisan breads, the risotto, the Amish chicken, and a cheese flight and shared everything. The ham prosciutto and artisan breads were good but nothing special. I liked the intense flavor and saltiness of the prosciutto. The risotto was extremely moist and creamy. I would ask for it with less lime next time because the flavor is overbearingly sour despite its flavor.  The Amish chicken was the star of the meal. It is possibly the best roast chicken, if not the best chicken, I've ever had. The outside is crispy while the inside is juicy and flavorful. I absolutely recommend this. The smashed potatoes that came with the chicken was extremely fresh and slightly salty. I didn't add any seasoning like I usually do with mashed potatoes.  I forget which cheese flight we ordered but I remember that one of the four cheeses included ground up coffee beans and lavender. This was definitely our favorite. The combination of the cheeses with the crostini and the Cabernet jelly that came with was quite strange but extremely delicious. The servers were very attentive and the atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect if you're looking for a romantic dinner or a social gathering.

We started off with the breads with spreads appetizer as well as the cheese fritters. Both were very delicious. The cheese fritters only come 3 to a plate so we had to split the last one.

The cauliflower steak was a good side. It had mushrooms, an eggplant puree and a tomato sauce on the plate. I left feeling very satisfied, I was full but not overly full where I needed a nap. The wine was great. I had the Spain flight that had delicious red wines. The owner of the restaurant frequently came over to see how we were doing and offered his opinion of some beers they recently received. Definitely a different place to try, they menu is unique and forces you to think outside the box and try something you normally wouldn't. I am not a vegetarian but decided a cauliflower steak would be something I wouldn't normally choose but would like to try.

Food was pretty good and the 3 of us shared everything. We didn't get a cheese plate. I think we decided to try their selection of liver pate's as we don't normally see on a menu. Listed below in order of preference, we tried the following: -Amish Chicken - the smashed potatoes were sooo addictive. Very sharable  -Crispy Brussels sprouts - this was a hit for all of us  -bourbon apple chicken liver pate  -Bone Marrow - we had some high hopes but it was flavorless. Food came out rather slow but it came all at once even though we ordered a few items after some time. Service was okay otherwise.",0.8845,0.921,0.079,0.0,0.5403977272727273
2015-07-28,4.0,"Early date night with my wife. Preface by saying, I used a Groupon coupon for the evening.  Upon arrival, reservation was not on the books for some reason even though I had made them a week prior. Very pleasant hostess greeted us at the door. Once we were seated, Damian (sp?) introduced himself to us as our Server. Asking if this was our first time at Bin36, we said yes he proceeded to lament over the fact that we were new and he had to explain everything to us. Listen chief, 35 years as an Executive Chef, I don't need the attitude. After that, things were more positive. He knew the menu inside and out and described everything with passion and knowledge although he wasn't a big fan of the roasted bone marrow which I love. Anyway, we started off with the brussels sprouts appetizer. They were named the best in the city for a reason. Although, they may want to watch the season with the salt. The caper dressing naturally is salty as is the Wisconsin Parmesan cheese. To note, the owner Mr. Enoch Shully is a positively delightful person whom has a table presence, really first class guy. Our second course, main, my wife had the roasted airline chicken breast with chimichurri sauce and I had the bourbon glazed pork chop. Kudo's to the chef with the proteins, although no temperature was asked for the pork, both dishes were very good. I was curious as to the effort made with frenching the pork chop and the airline wing bone but the okra on my dish was spotted and old. Dessert was limited by the absence of the signature caramel cake which was a real disappointment to my wife. For me, I knew from the beginning the bleu cheese flight with a Port was in store for me. It's very hard to find that available in the city and Bin36 does it right with all of their cheese flights. Points of interest; Wine suggestions are circled by number for all food items which makes life much easier for all. Menu is very limited in choices and they offer no specials? Having said that, from what we saw, everything looks great. I know people who use Groupon have a bad rap for being cheap, so remember to tip your server on the gross of the check not the net after the Groupon discount. As an example, our Groupon discount was $80 with a net owing of $36 but I tipped on a $120. Don't ""punish"" the Server for the discount you received, treat them right. Another plus was the Groupon parking for $6 which was only a 1000 feet away from the door on Lake Street. The parking voucher gives you 3 hours so it's perfect for a nice dinner and a short walk back to the car. If you're looking for an affordable, upscale/casual night with very good wine choices, this place is for you. I would love to attend a wine dinner here and see what Chef Shane and Mr. Shully create. My wife didn't share the same opinion because of the very limited menu and no real wow factor plus the initial attitude of the Server really turned her a little sour on the experience.",0.9886,0.82,0.12,0.06,0.437671130952381

Outdoor seating area was very cozy on a warm Sunday. Food was extremely well plated and mostly tasty, eggs Benedict was solid but the grits had a weird sour flavor to them.

2015-07-20,5.0,"We came here for dinner with some friends on a Saturday night and had a rather enjoyable meal. Décor: We sat outside, so I cannot comment on the inside, but this is a nice place. The outdoor area was covered (so if it had rained we would have been just fine) and has plenty of tables and even couches to sit at with nearly any size group. The ambiance is set with candles and it just has a really cool atmosphere. One thing, however, that I would caution: I'd be weary of sitting next to the walls (with the plants on top). As we were finishing dinner I noticed to very large spiders descend the wall (from the plants) and begin to build webs. Left undisturbed they would have been very unpleasant surprises for anyone sitting there, but our server, after we gave her a heads up, did the humane thing and moved one of them to the sidewalk (via a menu). Bathroom: I did not use it during our visit. Staff: Our server was really cool and VERY knowledgeable about the food, wine, cocktails; everything! The bus boys were very speedy as well and our water glasses were always full. Food/Drink: We started with some wine flights and cocktails/beer. Everything was great and our server's bourbon recommendation was spot-on. We then had a cheese plate (pretty tasty) and the Blistered Shishito Peppers (very tasty and not too spicy) before starting into our main course. For dinner we had the burger + fires (pretty standard), the roasted chicken w/ chimichurri (perfectly cooked and delicious!) and the Cauliflower Steak (a huge slab of cauliflower, grilled - fantastic!). Value: This is a classy place that offers some different items so as you'd imagine it's pretty pricey. Everything was excellent, so we definitely didn't feel ripped off, but we certainly won't be coming here on a weekly basis. This is a fantastic place that has great food/drinks, great atmosphere, and wonderful staff - we will certainly be coming back in the future.",0.9973,0.78,0.201,0.019,0.5843495934959351

I came for brunch and sampled quite a few items. The grits were amazing with a nice creamy texture contrasted by small pieces of crunch from the bacon. The biscuits and gravy were great with a nice sweetness to the sausage. The lemon pancakes were outstanding. Bin has somehow found a way to make pancakes feel light. Paired with that I tested out the Bloody Mary Tasting with the English Breakfast version being my fave. Somehow I was able to make enough room to have some desserts as well. The ice creams and sorbets were ridiculously good with the peach ice cream and coconut sorbet being my faves. The beignets were also fantastic. My favorite item though has to be the housemade sangria. Just seeing the cold drip device used to make it is worth the trip. Order a glass and be amazed.

I was a little disappointed at the size of the cheese that was served however. Very small serving size. Very hard to split with a group. We also ordered some extra bread, and they charged us a $1. We needed it and it was worth a dollar, but that felt a little cheap as there were 5 of us, and there wasn't enough bread originally served for us each to have a piece for each platter. We also split a bunch of sides, the brussel sprouts, bone marrow, grilled octopus, warm bread with spreads.

The perfect place for a date, business meeting, casual get together, or private dinner party. I really appreciated the layout of this place, as it has multiple alcoves or spaces that offer different vibes. There is also a beautiful outdoor patio with tables, high tops, and lounge sectionals.  The owner, Enoch Shully, greeted me and my two colleagues shortly after we sat down. He was extremely personable and made you feel that you've known him for years. He helped guide us through the menu as well as finding us the perfect wine(s).  We started the night with the oysters and bubbly, both of which were amazing. We then moved to the Radishes on toast, the charcuterie plate, and cheese plate. I highly recommend all! The beet salad is also amazing. After the share plates and appetizers, we had the head of a grouper fish. This was beyond superb! Not only does it make a great presentation, it was the perfect combination of tender meat and crispy/flaky outer layers. Excellent!! And this was enough to feed three hungry men (on top of our apps and drinks). Finally, the dessert. The Beignets are an absolute must if you go. The best beignets that all three of us have ever had. They are served with a warm chocolate sauce which is the perfect mix of sweet and savory!  My colleagues and I have been all over the city, tried all of the great restaurants, but few of them offer the all around experience that Bin 36 does.

2015-05-24,1.0,"We were fans of the original Bin 36 for over 10 years.  We eagerly anticipated our first visit at the new location.  Unfortunately, we were incredibly disappointed.  The new space is great, and the wine is still fantastic, but the menu and the service is not at all what we hoped it would be.  For one, the original was known for its cheese menu.  Now it is just a small (maybe a dozen??) selection with no descriptions of the cheese.  With a foreign name, how are we supposed to know what we are ordering?  We asked the server, but all she could offer was that ""they are good"" and steer us away from those with less blue flavor.  We ordered the warm artisan breads and dips (fingers crossed our favorite dreamy original hummus was included) and plate of regular multi-grain was dropped off with butter, some cheese spread and a green spread.  Nobody told us what it was, but it wasn't memorable.  The bread was pretty chewy and stale tasting.  We've been dreaming of the hummus-nobody in town had hummus like the original.  So incredible!  The cheese on our cheese plate was delicious, as was the multi-grain toast...but VERY small portions and absolutely no explanation (again) on which cheese was what.  Needless to say, we got our check at that point and moved on to another wine bar to finish/continue out meal.  We won't be returning,  I understand if new ownership took over and they want to try a new menu/vibe- but they should have used a new name.  The waitress kept stressing that this was a new concept and that the old Bin 36 couldn't sustain a bunch of people just wanting wine and cheese.  Well, we spent about $150 on wine and cheese and apps at the old place.  Maybe that wasn't such a bad thing.",0.9891,0.813,0.15,0.038,0.5734016884016883
2015-05-20,5.0,"The new Bin 36 is a must try. Anyone who was at the old Bin 36 knows they did two things really well, wine and cheese. The new Bin brings the same great wine and cheese but adds a new chef making much better food, a smaller more intimate space, and less tourists and more wine lovers. Hard to go wrong. It's easily one of the best places in the city for wine and everything you try is available to take home by the bottle at reasonable prices. The cheese is still fantastic (try the mozzarella). Chef Shane has several really tasty items on the menu (try the cheese fritters or the raspberry beignets). The space is much more conducive to a date or nice dinner with friends and there's a patio for summertime hanging out.   Also a really friendly staff and an owner who clearly has a passion for wine but isn't at all pretentious about it.  I highly recommend.",0.9934,0.708,0.26,0.032,0.4858441558441557
2015-05-19,4.0,"I really like the new BIN 36.  The location, the restaurant, the outdoor space, the food, the service...was all great.   It was a Saturday night after a birthday helicopter ride and we were looking for somewhere to continue a really nice night.  BIN 36 it is!  Since it was a gorgeous night we sat outside.  I really liked everything about the outdoor space except for the chairs.  In a somewhat short dress I was really uncomfortable sitting on the chairs they have outside.  They are metal (aluminum maybe?) and the slats across the seat had little ridges in them that were digging into my legs.  I was just going to deal with it till I noticed another woman was sitting on a napkin.  So I did the same.  Otherwise it's a very nice patio and since the street isn't too busy it's not loud like some other outdoor seating areas.   We tried a few appetizers, the baby octopus was very good.  I had risotto and it was done perfectly.  Of course the wine selection is great.  It's nice to be able to order a flight, or a small taste of one wine, or a regular glass.  Had I not been pretty hungry I probably would've tried the bubbly flight and put off food for awhile.  Of course, a dessert wine or bubbly flight is a good way to end a meal too.   The service was pretty good.  Possibly the only downfall of the evening (aside from the chairs).  Our server was busy with another table so another stepped in to welcome us and take our drink order.  It started to get slightly confusing who was and wasn't our server.  Someone apologized for not paying attention to us, someone (a manager maybe?) asked us if everything tasted good, and someone brought us food.  Over all it wasn't bad, just odd and not exactly good.   I look forward to going back to the new and improved BIN 36.  Maybe I'll bring a chair cushion with me?  'Cause I'm certainly not going to forgo the short dresses in the summer....",0.9953,0.795,0.179,0.026,0.5751002249782737
2015-05-07,5.0,"I have to tell you this is a must do !!! I went there yesterday for my birthday. I arrived with 2 others at 11:00 so I could spend some time before departing Chicago to Crystal Lake around 2:00. The NEW Bin 36 was recommended to me by a friend and I was impressed. We started by having Owner Enoch Shully do the ordering for us-so we did a sampling of many items starting with a cheese plate and charcuterie(coppa,rabbit pate,chicken liver mousse,pork rillettes and surry ham).next we had grilled baby octopus and for the main course we had Amish chicken(pinto beans and cornbread panzanella,red eye gravy) with crispy Brussels sprouts,creamy caper dressing,shaved parmesan. Enoch did the wine pairings for us with each dish which was smart. The menu has suggested pairings as well to help when ordering. I got to meet Chef Shane to tell him I will be back soon and the food was special!!! EVERYBODY was so polite and helpful-please do yourself a favor and go there.",0.9646,0.87,0.13,0.0,0.45027056277056277
2015-05-06,5.0,"The fresh space and SUPER friendly faces at BIN 36 in its new location on Jefferson Ave. make this place absolutely GLOW!  My guy and I were curious about the new venue, the food & wine, and its vibe. We stopped in on a Tuesday for a late lunch of several yummy green salads sprinkled with edible flowers (a POP of happy color after a long Chicago winter), spicy sautéed deep greens, and perfectly charred carrots with tangy dill cream and little crunchy barley puffs. We sampled and PLAYED with different tastes and textures in a 4 cheese flight. The artisanal whole grain bread basket was accompanied by the most delicious dips (the potato chutney was my winner) and fresh goat butter...mmm. Our bartender Amanda was just lovely. Knowledgeable, generous, and attentive. The Manager and Beverage Director, Enoch Shully, came out and personally extended a warm welcome, beaming with the energy and enthusiasm that really lights up a room. Oh, and the WINE! The white flight we ordered was nothing short of amazing, with two standouts: a Washington Chenin Blanc and an Oregon Pinot Gris. After ordering a few glasses of our favorites, we decided to buy two bottles to take home, conveniently, on the spot...for a very reasonable market price. I loVE the new and improved BIN 36. As a vegetarian wine lover seeking great atmosphere and service, it has become a favorite wine/small plates spot!",0.9966,0.72,0.262,0.018,0.5774372294372295

2015-05-06,5.0,"I've been to the old Bin 36, and I'm really digging this new spot! The new location is much smaller, but offers a more intimate and cozy experience, which I prefer over the cavernous space of their previous location.  The service: I came for dinner with a few friends the Thursday after they first opened, so you could tell that the servers were still getting accustomed to the menu and the layout of the space, so service was a little slower, but not terrible. They'll definitely be up to snuff after the first couple weeks. The food: the portions are smaller, which isn't a knock, but just be aware, since, as a typical American, I get accustomed to expecting supersized meals. We started with the assorted artisanal breads, which was a nice starter with the wine. I had the roasted porkchop, which was oh, so good! The right balance of savory with a little bit of sweet from the sweet potatoes and the apple butter, and the porkchop was cooked to the right temp too. My friends had the burger and the strip steak, which, they were quite pleased with as well.  The drinks: Granted, I know little about wine, but I enjoyed the We Reign in Spain wine flight... I enjoyed swirling it around like I knew what I was doing, but mostly just consuming it. It comes with on a sheet of paper which tells you which wines are which and some info about them, which is super great. I wish places that do beer flights would do this as well.",0.9968,0.765,0.226,0.01,0.503838808250573

I am not a big fan of Sangria, but the waiter suggested I try Bin's and it was just one more thing that the new Bin does that blew me away.   The staff is great, the location is fantastic and place is absolutely beautiful.  I can't wait to go back.",0.9853,0.77,0.214,0.016,0.6079545454545455

2015-05-05,5.0,"Having been a big fan of the former Bin 36, I couldn't wait to try it in its new location!  I've dined at the new Bin 36 twice, and both experiences were fantastic.  This past weekend I dined on the newly opened patio- it's the perfect spot for a summer evening in Chicago.  The service was outstanding- each person who visited our table was friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. Enoch, the new owner, stopped by and was very present throughout the restaurant during both of my visits.  He has clearly spent considerable time ensuring that every detail of the new Bin is up to par! Where do I even begin with the food and drinks.... We were curious about the cold drip sangria and the Nose, so we tried both.  Not only were they delicious, and unlike any cocktail I've ever had, but they were true experiences.  We had a variety of tasty shared plates and desserts. One was better than the next, and they were all presented beautifully.  The brussels sprouts, pimento cheese fritters, and raspberry beignets were my favorites...although it wasn't easy to narrow it down to just three!  I'll be back soon to try out more of Chef Shane's creations...and of course a wine flight!",0.983,0.815,0.165,0.02,0.5351706722396379
2015-05-03,1.0,"I was absolutely heartbroken when I learned that the previous Bin 36 was closing.  Upon learning it was reopening at a different location, my heart skipped a beat.  I understood it would not be completely the same but hoped it would be the wine and cheese place I could always fall back on.  Sadly, I find myself heartbroken once again. The wine list is still good.  The owner has not changed the concept of listing out different types of wines in groups along with helpful descriptions.  Prices are reasonable.   The cheese however.  Oh the cheese.  So sad.  The amount of offerings has decreased, which is ok.  However, the helpful descriptions that previously accompanied the names on the menu no longer appear.  And the servers are not knowledgable.  Upon asking about a cheese, all the server could tell me was, ""It is good.  I was just eating it in the back before.""  Ok.  Not helpful.... The cheese plate was embarrassing.  For $18 we received about 1 oz total of cheese (you get four types of cheese that you select).  Aside from not knowing anything about the taste, one cheese was completely inedible because we were served solely the rind (is this the cheese the that employee was eating in the back hence why none was left???).  The old cabernet jelly and delicious toasts were absent from the plate only to be replaced by some tart dark jelly and onion/pepper watery spread.  I would tell you what they were but no one ever told us.   Service also left something to be desired.  Our server immediately asked us if we wanted anything else but water while the hostess was handing us the drink menu but when we were ready to order, she was too busy clearing other plates.  Our water was never refilled and as mentioned above the knowledge was clearly lacking. This restaurant used to be a great place for cheese/wine beginners and experienced alike to go and enjoy themselves.  I recommended it to several friends, colleagues, and even strangers.  Unfortunately I will not be returning.  It was just not worth it.  If you are hoping to relive your old Bin 36 experiences by coming here, just don't bother.",0.985,0.778,0.147,0.075,0.4545045045045045
