2015-01-21,4.0,Small Indian restaurant with delicious food. I was surprised of the poor reviews and decided to try for myself and very happy I did. I loved it. Non greasy very delicious. Fresh fresh food. the only thing I dislike is they need to make their own Nan bread and not serve warmed up pita.,0.9133,0.538,0.312,0.151,0.7909090909090909

2014-12-30,3.0,"This place is A-OK. For me, this means I would easily return but I'm not quite a huge fan yet. It is a nice place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. As some other reviews have mentioned, the meat is a bit on the dry/bland side. I would encourage the tofu though. It is simmered in onions/garlic and spices so it has allot of flavor and is inherently more moist and tender. I ordered a burrito with the basmati rice, tofu, and masala sauce and cauliflower and bell peppers. It's a good combo because the bell pepper provides a nice crunch and fresh taste against the other tender and simmered flavors.  This combination worked allot better than my husband's chicken, curry and chickpeas combo (which was more dry and bland). I would love if they had paneer as a topping option as well.....",0.9787,0.775,0.19,0.035,0.6604166666666667
2014-11-24,3.0,I ordered the tofu with rice and spinach. The food I received was very very dry. The taste is good but there was not enough sauce to cover the rice. They give you all types of veggies if you like which I love. I was excited to get fresh and healthy food but the veggies are not stewed they are crunchy. I love crunch veggies but not in a curry. I asked for more sauce and they happily provided more. The naan was ok.,0.9883,0.666,0.334,0.0,0.6108333333333333

Literally took 20 minutes to take our order, because the lady at the register disappeared to the back for 10-15 with a line of customers waiting. Terrible service (by fast food standards) aside, the samosa here was literally THE worst ""samosa"" I'd ever bitten into. It was dry, tasteless, and didn't even have the right fillings. We each tried taking a few bites of it and ended up just throwing it away because it was actually inedible. I honestly don't know how an ""Indian"" place  can mess up samosas that badly.

We got the bowl (rice, fajitas mix, chicken, a mix of the korma and the masala sauce) and chicken tikka wih naan. The food was good, although the naan wasn't authentic naan. It was more like a flatbread. However, I wouldn't complain about it as not only were the portions big and flavorful but the prices (atleast what we got: $8 bowl and $5 naan and chicken tikka) were pretty reasonable ($14 for a meal for 2).

I thought the lentil soup was delish! I would go back for that, esp during the winter, and maybe throw in the chicken tikka on the side.

Essentially, this place is like Chipotle for Indian food.  You pick whether you want a bowl, wrap, and other options I didn't care about (because I stopped reading after bowl), and then you choose a base: white rice, brown rice, or quinoa (brown rice was good).  Next, you pick a meat (beef, chicken, vegetarian, or tofu).  I got beef and was happy with the meat.  The veggie options are: peppers & onions (the only knock my fiance gave this mix is that it was onion-heavy), chickpeas, or broccoli & carrots (delicious and well-balanced).  Then you pick a sauce--curry (deliciously mild), tikka masala (delicious but slightly hotter), spinach, or vindaloo.  Next time I'd like to try vindaloo. There are a variety of sides, and I got a samosa (perfect size for a snack or appetizer).  There are a couple dessert options I might try next time, but I was very satisfied with the mango lassi ($3.95)--it is not freshly made from mangoes, and likely uses a powder base or something, but it was still delicious. Overall, I'd definitely go back, especially since it's right below my building.  The service was excellent--very friendly.  The place itself is a little sparse, but what do you need but a comfy seat and a table to eat??  I got mine to go, anyway.  Pricing was spot on for the portion sizes--a lot of food for $8.95 (beef or chicken price)!  Definitely worth a visit.",0.9864,0.861,0.127,0.011,0.5961681547619048
