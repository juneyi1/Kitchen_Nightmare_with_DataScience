I'm pretty sure this is BYOB but they also have 2 or 3 beers in bottles to choose from. It's an ""order then sit with a number"" type place. The service was quick. I got the basics burger with cheddar cheese and Greek fries. So delicious! The burger was cooked just right and the pretzel bun is a must. The fries were also good.

This shit is recommended.  The thing about burger bars is its a point of view kind of thing.  Like most foods, you'll either love or hate the delivery, presentation and or offering.  Burger bars in general run the gamut and some have the most foo foo of toppings, general, or extreme in offering of meats.  I've spent up to $20 dollars on a burger combo for myself (which I found obnoxious) and as low as $10 dollars for a combo elsewhere.  Here, I often choose from their signature menu and have the burger cooked my way and it often satiates my hunger.  Eggs are always sunny but runny.",0.8912,0.845,0.106,0.049,0.5688725490196078

On the flip side, while eating our salads, we found that the lettuce from the bottom was a bit... damp.  So we pushed the lettuce to one side and tilted the plate, and it was FILLED with water.  We took a bunch of napkins and poured out the water.  No exaggeration, there was at LEAST 3/4 cup of water filling the bottom of each plate.  TBP needs to invest in a salad spinner.  We both kinda lost our appetites, choked down the dry burger and picked out the olives from our salads and left.   The extra star is for their Sweet Potato Fries.  They are more dessert than side - taste extra sweet which was needed to clear the palate.

Also, I've never been able to put my finger on why their shakes are never as good, as other burger and fast food places. Some suggestions for this place: 1) For Belly, why does it take 50 points(& 10 visits) just to get your first reward? Every other place I can think of that uses Belly, gives you your first reward no later than 15-25 points(3-5 visits) in. 2) The straws here they give out(for both drinks and shakes) are way too small for the shakes. Why the heck can't they invest in giving you bigger straws, if you order a shake? 3) It would seriously help a lot if they gave you a spoon, if you ask for one after getting a shake. Every fast food place(and I really mean EVERY SINGLE one I've ever been to that serves milkshakes, and both non-chain and chain places) has always had the option of spoons available, if you ask for it on request. Why the heck do they not have them available upon request? 4) Finally, their prices are higher than I feel they should be charging, IMO.

2013-04-01,2.0,"Greetings, fellow Yelp skeptics!!! How's it hanging? Good, I hope.  But first, check your ID bracelet: If you're one of those lemmings who waits in the two-hour line at Hot Doug's because you actually think you're getting the meal of your life, maybe you should skip my reviews and stick to reading the warning labels on Drano. You're not ready for reality, or a review like the way the Yelp skeptic dishes it. And if you're a fan, welcome back: I swear I won't steer you wrong. I'll be the first to point out that I think many Yelp! reviews are written by shills. (Maybe I'm a shill, but it's for some abstract cause, like equal rights for Martians.)  This week, I'm reviewing the Burger Philosophy, a sad little local burger joint in the way that the french fry guy at McDonald's is sad. You stare into his vacant, pubescent eyes and realize -- oh ye gods! -- that he could be so much more. But he's just a fry guy with a thousand-yard stare and you realize much to your chagrin that he doesn't understand customer service, and probably never will. This is likely because in his mind, your request for more ketchup packets is interrupting the reverie where he's trying to memorize the cheat code on Call of Duty 13: Final Final Annihilation. ""Duuuuude! The nerve...."" I'm about this close--this frigging close--to renaming the Burger Philosophy ""The Smirking Philosophy."" I'll get to why in a moment, but rather than whoop your ass with a bunch of bad Nietzsche puns, let's catalog what they do right.  Even a one-star place must do something right (the toilets flush), and the Burger Philosophy does grind its beef fresh, and the food tastes good--much better than Five Guys with the BIG RED HYPE SIGNS IN EVERY STOREFRONT, and better than most burger joints purporting to serve something above and beyond. Edzo's or Kuma's this ain't, but it comes close on a good day, as when I ordered the teriyaki burger with its thick wedge of fresh pineapple and piquant teriyaki sauce, an unexpected compliment to the snuggly-soft pretzel bun. But I know you'll get what I'm about to say: Good food, even almost-great food as the Burger Philosophy dishes, means almost nada when the folks waiting on you are clueless about the rudiments of good customer service. Besides being the Dostoyevsky of Yelp, Yelp Skeptic also spent a good many years in the food service industry. And here's where BF falls down, (and almost earns the nickname The Smirking Philosophy). I've been here two times, and twice they've been out of items prominently featured on the chalkboard menus. And the wee little bald man behind the counter, could that be ... a smirk on his face when he says ""We're out of that""?  Now notice what I said: ""We're out of that.""  That's not, ""Sorry, we're out of that."" And it's not, ""I'm really sorry, we're out of that. Can I suggest something else?"" Or, ""I'm so sorry, we're out of that--can I give you a raincheck for your trouble?"" But I did get this odd little ... was it a smirk? Noooooo. I could've kindly suggested that if they were out of sweet potato fires on the Daily Special blackboard, well then, get thee to Office Max, buy an eraser and kindly remove yon item from the chalkboard, SIr Smirk-alot. But that would make too much sense. So I tried again. This time I ordered the Cookie Sandwich. But guess what?  Quoth the counter guy: ""We're out of that."" And then---YES, THIS TIME I SAW IT, DAMMIT!--the smirk! So two times I've been there, and twice the Burger Philosophy has been out of an item I was led to believe they'd have ready for me. And OK, maybe my macular degeneration and cynical dego ass saw a smirk where one did not exist.  Do these guys even give a rip? Maybe. But they sure don't act like it. As a test, I underspent my Groupon by $20, which was the only possible outcome after going 0-for-2. Did they point this out? Or suggest I get something else for all the trouble? Nah. It's been a while since I flipped a burger, but let us seal this review by saying that maybe the proprietor needs to study up on how great customer service turns folks like us into stark-raving, salivating loyal fanatics. Whoever he or she is, this owner wants the Burger Philosophy to succeed. Why start a business when your goal is mere mediocrity? Well then, Mr. or Ms. BF, do whatever it takes to get your counter help to get with the program. Unless the counter help is the owner. Bad customer service only works when you're the Soupman on ""Seinfeld"" and it becomes an ""event"" to get picked on.  Otherwise, it pays to keep in mind that in the fierce world of Chicago's burger wars, lukewarm bile is not the secret sauce.",0.9907,0.802,0.12,0.078,0.5608190035273369

I wasn't a huge fan of the Greek fries but the truffle fries were outstanding. I think for both of us with tax it was $23. The decor is quaint and the service was excellent.

Overall I'd say a decent place to grab a bite but nothing overly amazing. Fairly small restaurant with a hand full of tables, it looked very clean and the service was fast and friendly. I ordered the Tropical Bud burger because I have this obsession with eating pineapple in every meal. Ordered on the pretzel bun with parmesan truffle fries. I wasn't really that impressed with this burger. It had a teriyaki sauce on it that I thought sounded good, but wasn't really what I wanted all over my burger and dripping down my arms when it came to eating. It wasn't bad by any means, just not the flavor profile I was looking for in my burger. I was taken by the pineapple. What can I say. The burger itself wasn't overly juicy, magical or flavorful and to be honest, there were random bites that couldn't quite be comfortably chewed through. I don't know if that's the nature of a fatty burger but I'd prefer a more ""tender"" burger. I would also like to note that the pretzel bun was not warmed or grilled in any capacity. It sort of sucks to bite into a giant burger when the bun has no give. A little warmth or grill to it would be much improved. The parmesan truffle fries were quite delicious though. The fries were good and crispy, well seasoned with parmesan, the garlic aioli to accompany was awesome. Very little truffle flavor to speak of however (but that's ok because honestly truffle oil can really be kind of gross).  The boyfriend had the Devil's Advocate on a pretzel bun, also with parmesan truffle fries.  Overall it seems he sort of felt the same as me. The burger wasn't bad but nothing about it made us go, OH godddd, good burger! Just kinda like, yeah, that was a good lunch but not a great lunch. He also really liked the fries.

Last Friday Night = Party.  Too much booze.  Up too late.  Insane amount of dancing.  It left me with a raging headache and a bottomless pit in my tummy that needed a huge, delicious burger. Stat. I was in Uptown working on some vacation planning with a friend and we decided to Grub Hub it to see what was available.  Burger Philosophy looked good.  And for fuck's sake, they have TRUFFLE FRIES. Done and done. Delivery definitely took the full hour, but what was delivered was spectacular. The burgers aren't disgustingly huge, but they're definitely substantial.  Suck it up and pay the extra 50 cents and get a pretzel roll.  I went with just a classic burger with lettuce, tomato, onion and bacon.  I slathered some mayo on that bad boy and dug in with gusto.  It was super juicy and moist, which is exactly what you want in a burger.  You can only get a burger medium well when delivered, which is fine by me. Let's talk about the truffle fries for a minute.  I'm a seasoned delivery vet.  I've ordered everything from pizza to sandwiches to udon to burritos.  I never ever have luck with fries being delivered hot AND crisp.  It just doesn't happen.  Well, somehow it happened with Burger Philosophy.  I loved that not only were the fries pretty crisp, but that the truffle oil wasn't overpowering.  It was just enough to make the fries interesting.  Total win. I would 100% order from Burger Philosophy again.  They're not in my delivery range, but still... Do it.",0.9936,0.718,0.21,0.072,0.5671428571428571

We went over to McDonalds to get some fries to go with our burgers and when they brought the burgers out, we began to eat. YUM!!

I had the bleu cheese burger on pretzel bread. It was juicy, with the right amount of bacon and cheese. One reviewer commented on how the onions on theirs was too big... Mine were big but proportional to the sandwich. My boyfriend went a safer route with a cheeseburger and he commented surprisingly how delicious it was.  We shared the fries sprinkled with Parmesan and served with garlic aoili which I barely got any since my boyfriend devoured them. It was definitely reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food. We sat on a little road-side/sidewalk-side patio with 3 tables and umbrellas for each.

Not sure why others gave less than 4 star reviews for too-big onions or thought it specializes in ""fast food"" burgers - I didn't get that impression at all from the interior or exterior....

There is no table service; you order your burger at the counter, and one of the staff will bring it out to you. Soft drinks are available at the self-service fountain.

I ordered my burger medium rare, and it came out perfectly cooked and delicious. Adding to the ingredients and preparation of the burger, the perfectly seasoned grill made a great contribution to its overall taste. The hand cut Greek and truffle oil fries were both great, though the truffle flavor was a bit light. The young lady at the counter informed me they do allow BYOB, which is nice, but I can't imagine making an evening out of their dining room.

I was hoping BP would live up to either of those places, and it fell a little short.  The fries arrived crisp and they weren't greasy--impressive for delivery! However, they had absolutely NO salt and therefore no flavor. The burger, on the other hand, was way over-seasoned. It was so heavy on the pepper (almost tastes like McCormick's grill seasoning), you couldn't taste the beef. And a burger should really be all about the meat. It was over-cooked. We also both thought the meat had a weird texture. We experienced some of the ""gristle"" problems others complained about.  I think there's no excuse for that poor of meat quality. This needs to be fixed and fast. The one highlight was the milkshake. For $3.99, it was HUGE and delicious. I think BP has potential to be a lot better than it is.

Burger Philosophy does not do this. Their burgers are descent, but for a place that touts that they grind their own beef on site, I'm surprised that it isn't better, or at least seasoned.  The best and freshest beef in the world is bland without seasoning, and this is what you find here.  The toppings are very good, but when topping are the star of the show, the show doesn't leaving anyone wanting more. Service is much to slow.  If I'm going to stop in for a quick dinner, or to take something home for the family, it can't take 20 minutes to get the food.  The other burger places take 5-7 minutes, still cooking to order, and with a better finished product.

I was actually surprised that it was more of a casual place.  Nothing wrong with that though! Plus, they were quite clean, which was pretty impressive. My boyfriend and I were a little torn as to what to order since all the choices looked good.  I went with the special for the day (Twighlight burger) and he got the Devil's Advocate.  We also went with the bacon bleu cheese fries.  Both burgers were quite good.  The Twighlight burger was a pretty basic BBQ bacon burger that came with an onion ring on the burger. I was impressed with the size of the burger. Additionally, I was also impressed by the freshness of the lettuce and tomatoes in the burger. The only thing I would suggest in terms of improvement would be the option of how you want your burgers cooked.  I prefer my burgers medium, so the patty was just a tad over done for me. Overall, I think the taste of the burger was in tact. :-) My boyfriend got the Devil's Advocate. Given the fact that he loves spicy food, I can safely say he was not disappointed. They did not skimp out on the jalapenos at all.  The pepper jack cheese also made a tasty addition to the burger. Now this could just be my bias, but the only thing I didn't like about the burger was the amount of mustard.  Now the reason I say I could be biased, is because I am not a mustard fan in general. The menu said a dash of spicy mustard, but  it was a lot. The price points for the type of burger place/menu options/etc. were appropriate. The burgers were approximately 7 dollars, but they were also of decent size.   If you're looking for a casual dining experience that doesn't sacrifice taste, I would definitely suggest this place.",0.9697,0.834,0.126,0.04,0.6735407066052229

That sounds like a bad philosophy to me. What really bothers me about this place is the fact that they put a big emphasis on grinding the meat fresh for a higher quality product, but put total garbage bacon bits and blue cheese on their fries.  So, you'll had cut your fries and grind your burgers, but you can't spend a few minutes to make good bacon?  How hard is it to make bacon?  Think of what you can do with the bacon fat leftover from said cooking.   With a few tweaks, I'm sure this could be a wait outside the door in the  cold kind of place, but I have a sneaking suspicion if they keep the service as slow as it is, and don't start cooking burgers to the customer's requested temperature, they're only going to have a few people in there at a time.  And without good foot traffic and very low visibility in an already crowded market, that is a recipe for disaster.",0.1404,0.797,0.105,0.098,0.5068584656084655

Their burger menu is rather small but there are some good flavor combinations.  I did the Good Morning Chicago because it featured some of my favorite stuff - egg, cheese bacon.  They didn't ask me how I would like the meat cooked, which I thought was odd for a place trying to market their burgers as ""fresh"", but with all the toppings I didn't really notice the difference. Lots of upcharges - 50 cents extra for a pretzel bun (worth it for me, I liked it), a buck or two extra for greek or bleu cheese toppings for the fries  - I passed on the extras in this case, the fries are served in huge portions and I couldn't even finish an order of the plain fries. There's lots of potentially good stuff going on at Burger Philosophy, but to be successful over the long term, I think they will have to figure out their identity in the burger world.  I don't think they have the capacity to compete with Hamburger Mary's for the sit-down crowd.  The fact that the menu is limited, and meat is not made to order, suggest a slightly upscale quickie take-out place, ala Five Guys.  Yet I see lots of complaints about waits for food orders.  I used to live down the street from a fairly nice bar and grill which could turn around an order on a decent burger - cooked any way I liked - in less time than I had to wait for by Burger Philosophy order (and at about the same price).  If they can figure out a way to speed service, then they may eventually be able to build a healthy carry-out and quick-bite business.",0.988,0.835,0.128,0.037,0.4673015873015873

Covered in sweat with an aching back and dry throat, I thought, ""damn a burger would be good right now."" So, filthy and tired, I ended my day of moving by making a stop at the Burger Philosophy, hoping that I was discovering a new favorite burger shop.  Unfortunately for all parties involved, I hadn't found a new go-to-shop for burgers. Instead, I discovered a place that might do in a pinch if I don't want to go to Five Guys. I have been to this place twice now, and I wholeheartedly agree with many of the observations I have read.  The burger itself was sub-par relative to the cost. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, it just wasn't exceedingly good either. In fact, there was nothing notable about it. It was incredibly average, distinguished only by it's unobtrusive tolerability.  I enjoy pretzel buns. I harbor a soft spot in my heart for them and it is a plus whenever I encounter them on a menu. Unfortunately, if you order a pretzel bun at the Burger Philosophy, expect that this - along with your choice of toppings - will be all that you taste. I also do not think that a 50 cent upcharge is necessary for this particular item. I mean, come on! It's not bacon, it's a bun. (Note to self, develop ""bacon buns."") The fries are delicious, and they certainly give you a ton of them. They aren't quite at the level of other fries I've encountered, but they are damn good.  Others have mentioned this, which warmed my mighty heart, because I thought I was alone in feeling strangely malicious toward their music selection. With all the time I have spent in public places with bad music I am generally pretty effective a tuning it out, but this was a conspicuously bad case.

You can have the sandwich by itself or add fries and a drink for an extra couple bucks. Burger: $5.99-$6.99 Combo: $9-$10. While the menu is simple, the theme seems to be customization.

2011-06-09,2.0,"I really, really, really wanted to like the Burger Philosophy. I've walked by there a few times since they opened, and the place always looks busy. So I finally decided to check the place out.  The setting is very, very casual. Walk up to the counter, place your order, get a number, find a table. The two young women at the counter taking orders were nice and very courteous.  There is a decent amount of seating-- nothing fancy, just some tables and chairs, but it's an honest environment that I like. They have large portraits of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer on the wall, and made-up quotations from the two extolling the virtue of burgers, which got a genuine chuckle from me. Burgers and existentialism? What is not to love...  Actually, the food is what I didn't love. I ordered my burger to go, so maybe I'd have to go back one more time and taste the burger hot off the grill to make an accurate assessment. However, I don't know if I'll be going back anytime soon.  I ordered an Into the Bleu Burger on a pretzel roll with a side of Greek fries (no drink). The burger was very dry and pretty tasteless. It didn't taste that fresh and was kinda on the small side. And, to be honest, it kinda reminded me of one McDonald's ""premium"" Angus burgers. The fries were okay, although I probably wouldn't think to order them again. Overall, the food was meh. Considering my total came to almost $13, I kinda wished I had just gone to the McDonald's across the street.  Also, their offerings seem a little unimaginative. The most creative burger they have on the menu is the Good Morning Chicago. I expected a little more variety and creativity at a place that's named Burger Philosophy.  I might go back. I probably won't. I'd rather spend a little more at Hamburger Mary's down the road, where the burgers are more creative, and at least there's booze.",0.9916,0.83,0.146,0.024,0.5385786435786435

The consensus of the visit was that the fries tasted pretty good but the burgers were tasteless, grainy, and not cooked to order, a large demerit.

She thought it was very tasty, juicy and that the pepper jack cheese went well with it. The fries are awesome and they give you a huge portion of them too. I don't think you can beat the amount of quality food you get for the money in the area.  The atmosphere in the place is nice too, couple funny quotes to tie in the theme.

First, I found it hilariously ironic that when my husband asked for his burger med-well, the response was ""we are not professional cooks."" Really?! What are you then? Anyways, theburger was tasteless. Seemed like one of those frozen pre-made patties that you could get at Jewel. I had the Devil's advocate, which is sold as a spicy burger. Besides about two jalapenos, it wasn't spicy at all. The burgers are pricey and I simply cannot justify why. On top of all this, after putting our to go order in, we waited, and waited and waited. Finally after 20 minutes (we checked the time on our receipt), we went in and asked what was going on. The guy rudely says to my husband, there are orders ahead of you. My husband says ""Ya (pointing at a fellow patron) that guy was ahead of me, and he is already done eating."" They then tell us 10 minutes more. I guess they forgot our order, but failed to own up to their mistake. So all in all, we waited 30 minutes for a pretty lame burger and were treated rudely to boot. I say again.

That is what my mom says to make me feel awful...which is how I felt spending $$ at the Burger Philosophy only to be treated poorly by what I can only guess was the manager. Let me try to recreate my experience...I called in a takeout order for two burgers (Basic and Devil's Advocate) and two fries (Bleu Cheese & Greek). I had to spell my name 4 times for the order taker...and by the time I was done, I was told the food was ready to be picked up.  So off I went to pick up the order. When I got there, I was informed that they were slammed and my food would be up in a minute. But wait, I was just told my food was already ready when I was on the phone. Honestly...it didn't look busy...every table had their food already and there was one group waiting before me. I was perplexed. BUT what I did get to witness was how they made their ice cream sandwiches. The employee opens up a bag of what could be Otis Spunkmeyer cookies and puts a scoop of ice cream between the two cookies. Genius. However - the special sauce was the fact the employee did not have gloves on and had just worked the cash register. Hygiene was not on the philosophy menu.  Then I proceeded to watch the same employee deliver the ice cream sandwich and shake to a customer who was waiting for her takeout order. The employee was utterly perplexed when the customer explained to the employee that she was waiting for a takeout order and could the employee wrap up the sandwich and store it in the freezer until her takeout order was ready. The employee was dumbfounded and literally didn't know what to do.  The ""manager"" came out to apologize to me for the wait...I tried to explain it to him but he cut me off. Finally after 15 minutes of waiting for my food he delivered it and I AGAIN tried to explain to him that I was told on the phone that my order was ready...he cut me off AGAIN. So I had to tell him that he couldn't interrupt his customers.  WELL...sorry this is so long. I just called to speak to the owner, Chris. He called me ""honey,"" and interrupted me while I tried to explain the situation. Really? The call ended by me saying that his employees as well as himself should get customer service training.",-0.5044,0.918,0.038,0.044,0.5786714285714286
2011-05-31,2.0,"I've been looking forward to the opening of The Burger Philosophy, hoping for a faster and cheaper alternative to Hamburger Mary's. My husband and I walked over yesterday just after noon. The first jolt was sticker shock. $9 for a burger + $2 for fries + nearly $2 for a drink (or $4 for a shake) = we expected this to be on par, if not better, than Mary's. Our total for two people came to over $25. We were handed our table number, found a table, and then we waited. And waited.  I ordered a chocolate shake and two people who ordered shakes after me received theirs before me. When I finally got my shake it was more milk than shake - it tasted good, but it takes a lot to mess up the combination of ice cream and milk. Multiple people commented that the  shakes weren't 'full' - mine was short of filling the cup by about an inch and a half. The young lady making the shakes just shrugged at the comments/complaints.  So, for $4 you get a soupy milk shake that doesn't fill the clear plastic cup and a side helping of attitude. My husband and I both ordered Good Morning Chicago burgers, but I ordered mine on a pretzel bun (which costs $.50 extra). After waiting 20 minutes, the manager or someone acting like a manager approached us and told us the burgers were taking longer than usual (I found it slightly funny that after being open barely an hour and a half they knew their ""usual"" timing during the lunch rush). 30 minutes after ordering (our receipt was time stamped) we finally received our food.  The burgers were smaller than expected and my pretzel bun was flattened. The burger itself tasted fine, but it wasn't anywhere near Mary's quality. The fries were nothing special.  Also, my husband had gotten a fountain drink with his meal and mid burger munching, he got up to refill his soda. There is no mention of a no-refill policy, but he certainly got nasty looks from behind the counter when he refilled his $2 fountain drink.  Overall, there are early kinks that need to be worked out, but I don't think the food is worth what they are charging.

Second: the burger was verrrry well done, dry, and had no real flavor or seasoning.

I do not like american cheese, so I got mine without, and the rest of the toppings were fine: your basic lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle spear on the side. The fries, $2 extra, were pretty good.
