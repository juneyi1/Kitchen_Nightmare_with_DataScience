This was hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I mean, even with that tiny location you had where you were ALWAYS in somebody's way while waiting for a table or the leaky ceiling in that basement party room...I didn't care because the food was so good! The tilapia, coconut rice, empanadas, pulled pork, that breaded chicken...never had a bad meal here. Come back soon!",-0.3824,0.79,0.092,0.118,0.4697601010101011

2009-04-22,4.0,"Mambo Grill is my go-to business lunch place for several reasons: 1) It is relatively convenient for me to get there. 2) The food is great and reasonably priced. 3) I like to dream about actually being able to have a margarita in the middle of the day, even though I never do, for fear that I would have to nap it off in the afternoon. I have always had good experience with the service here.  It can definitely get packed and a little slow, but the two times I've been for dinner, it's never been a huge problem.  Most of the time, I'm happy for a little wait because I know the serving sizes are so big that I'm going to be stuffed to the gills.

2009-04-08,3.0,"i went to mambo grill with a group of girls after the french restaurant we tried to go to down the street was closed. the restaurant serves latin american food. the menu is pretty extensive and perhaps would do well with a little more focus. i had the coconut-curried tilapia, based on a yelp recommendation. it was pretty tasty. the portions were huge. everything was pretty good... the guac, the margs, my fish, but nothing i'd have to go back for. the interior seemed sort of dark and depressing, not festive like you typically expect of a latin american restaurant with a funky sign out front, but perhaps it was just the snowy weather outside that made it seem less upbeat.  good to eat: coconut-curry tilapia",0.0123,0.821,0.097,0.082,0.4369444444444445
2009-03-29,2.0,"Meh, is right. First of all, I should have taken the train. It would have been a short walk, even in the rain. I drove around for nearly half an hour looking for parking before finally just deciding to valet it ($12 for 3 hours)... The atmosphere seemed lively enough. Music was a little loud so you had to shout a little bit if the person wasn't right next to you, the place was packed (but not overflowing) for a weekend night. The service was pleasant and friendly, but relatively slow. It seemed like they had enough staff and the place was small enough that it should have been more efficient. Our water glass was always filled, but it took forever to place our order, get our drinks, get extra glasses, get our food, get our bill, etc... I was a little iffy about the crispy roast pork because of the mixed reviews, but (alas!) fell victim to the hype. The crispy roast pork is NOT crispy. The meat was kinda dry. And rather bland. It's served as shredded pork on top of a mound of jalepeno mashed potatoes (jalepeno spice was VERY subtle, could hardly taste it), sitting in a pool of buttery, sweet corn cream. The panama style empanadas were cheesy and fluffy (my panamanian friend tells me they're supposed to be more chunky with filling, less cheesy, and flatter). The margaritas are decent. The mojitos are overpriced at $8 and weak in a small whiskey glass with ice. Shortly after finishing my meal, the ceiling above me started to leak (YES, leak!! NO WONDER they are moving! They should've closed just one day earlier). For that, the manager(?) came out and apologized and put a wet cloth where the leak was dripping to absorb the water and re-assured us it was not a bathroom above us, but rather the bar (yes, that makes me feel tons better- thank god it started after I'd finished eating, it would have dripped right into my food! ew!!!). Then they gave us complimentary desserts and a margarita pitcher (the pitcher being requested). It seemed to take a long time (10? 15 mins?) for the valet guy to return with my car... they only had one valet so another couple in our party had to wait even longer (after me).",0.9749,0.842,0.108,0.05,0.5021865889212828
2009-03-19,1.0,"Usually, when I have a horrible experience at a restaurant, I hold my judgment until I try them again... Not this time!  Despite some of the great reviews and a personal recommendation from a friend, I thought this place was HORRIBLE and I'm shocked they can stay in business!      I ordered the chicken empanadas and they were a joke!  The worst empanadas I've ever had period!  What made them so bad?  Well first of all, there was hardly chicken to be found, it was all pastry.  Second of all the shell was soft and flaky like an apple turnover, not to mention full of grease!  I didn't even have the motivation to finish it and I am an empanada fiend!  We also ordered the guacamole with chips, which were average supermarket chips and a pre made, salty and not fresh tasting guac.  I could have made better guac at home honestly, and I'm no Rick Bayless.  With the empanadas being 10 bucks and the the chips and guac being around 6, I was already feeling ripped off.    Now, on to the main culprit of my anger, the ""Roast, Crispy Pork"".  Sounds good right?  Sounds like it should be, hmm, CRISPY?  Well when it came out I was pleasantly surprised at the layout of the dish, it looked like a dessert and the corn creme sauce around it was decent.  But the pork itself?  Dried out, stale tasting, and NOT CRISPY AT ALL!  How can they call this ""Crispy"" roast pork?  Not to mention it had a strange sour lime flavor that I had to drown out with the corn creme sauce (hoping that it was lime and not rotten!) and there wasn't really much pork at all, it was just on top of a mound of mashed potatoes that were very pedestrian.  Add to that some obvious canned corn kennels and black beans and I present to you, the 15 dollar dish of dismay.  3 of my friends ordered this and none of us finished.  I took mine to go and contemplated giving it away to a homeless person, then decided that would be cruel and unusual and threw it out.      Anyhow, usually I'm very understanding and try to give an establishment a 2nd chance before I dish out the 1star, but these items were so HORRIBLE that I am inspired to rip them apart as I wonder why there are so many great reviews!?!  Obviously these prices seem like a good bargain but that's the point, at this price level if I'm complaining that shows how angry I was!  I'm sure the drinks are great, as something must be keeping them in business.  As for me I'm going to other cuban places that are less expensive, actually have some flavor and don't insult the empanada!",0.9767,0.789,0.135,0.076,0.5449920634920636

2009-03-12,4.0,"Mambo Grill...wow. As I write this, I am eating the other half of my leftover Guava Pork sandwich from yesterday's lunch at Mambo Grill. Let's just say I am ready to cry over this sandwich because it is so good and encompasses my favorite flavors: sweet + meat. Think of the Guava Pork sandwich as a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, but ""done right"": guava saucy sweet pulled pork on an onion roll, with a side of fries, and Mambo Grill's homemade guacamole and regular old ketchup for dipping sides. Even better, take some of the guacamole and smear it onto your sandwich. What a great mix of flavors and textures! And with tax and tip, only $10. Shoot, why bother with chains like Corner Bakery for the same price! I couldn't help but also observe other people's food while I ate at the restaurant yesterday. Someone ordered a salad with mangos (!!!) and avocados, and a cup of the black bean soup that was ornately surrounded with tri-colored tortilla chips. Wow, I know I'll have to try those next time! Someone's mambo burger also looked pretty thick and yummy for those beef eaters out there.  They also have $3.99 bar appetizers starting at 4 pm, and are reputed to have the best mojito in town. I've never had one before, let alone Mambo Grill offers a mango (!) one. Also note about lunch, it wasn't busy when I went! So you have no excuse if you work in the area not to try this place. I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu. AND...YOU HAVE TO COME HERE BEFORE THE END OF MARCH! Mambo Grill is closing its doors in preparation for their move to a location two blocks west of the restaurant (why oh why oh why, now that I've found you?) They'll open again in July so ACT FAST NOW. And finally, major props to bartender Frank. He's really nice!",0.9888,0.787,0.152,0.062,0.4730511675824176
2009-03-08,4.0,"How many people can you cram into a doorway? I don't know but this place surely tries to find out with their nonexistent waiting area. I was a little put off by the fact that my reservation seemed to have become lost but they got us in fast and in pretty comfy accommodations in the downstairs area. The floor manager seemed very stressed out at such an early hour in the evening but I must say the place gets packed so stress is understood.  Once seated, our waitress was pretty quick to stop by  and introduce herself and get us mojito-fied! I must say that I'm really not a huge fan of mojitos or at least I wasn't but the Mambo mojitos were pretty tasty.  For dinner I had the Dominican bombas de camarones, delicious croquettes of potato and shrimp with a side of the tastiest black beans I've had in a long time. I assumed the drinks would be good but figures the food would be mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised.

Well, move along, then. Yes, they are half-price, and that special applies to either by the glass or by the pitcher. Uh, a pitcher, duh!  I joined the dance class dropout crew last night for mojitos, food, and good company. I remember the last time I was here (awhile ago), I had the BBQ ribs, which was delicious. This time, I went with the chicken taquito from the appetizer section. The waitress assured me that I made a very good choice, and she was right. For an appetizer, this thing was huge, and I just finished the leftovers for dinner tonight! For those who dislike cilantro, this was sprinkled with a very small amount of it. I'm not a huge fan, but I was able to pick off what I could. No biggie. Everyone else seemed to enjoy what they ordered as well.  For larger parties, there's another room downstairs. It worked well for us because it wasn't as loud as upstairs. Plus, the bathrooms are down there, so you won't be stumbling up/down the stairs if you've had one too many mojitos. *wink* Service was fine - no complaints here.

The chips and salsa and guacamole as a starter is great.  I've also had the calamari appetizer and it is good as well-the breading has a little kick to it.   I've ordered the Taquito de Pollo appetizer as my main course several times and it is really good-most of the time I can't even finish it.

2009-02-13,4.0,"Mambo you make my mouth happy. Thank you. One of my favorites is the Flautas de Puerco,Three flautas filled with shredded pork & potato, Chihuahua cheese & guacamole. I also enjoyed the Brazilian Steak Kabobs appetizer, it comes with grilled pineapple and I sure am a sucker for grilled pineapple. There is a waitress and waiter who work the lunch shift who are excellent. There is another waiter at lunch who phones it in. When I ordered hot tea the one waiter brings out the whole selection box, honey and a lemon and asked if I wanted cream. The phone-it-in-guy just placed a regular old black tea bag next to the cup. No lemon, no honey and seemed to get a little 'tude when I asked him to bring the box. In general he doesn't stop by to see if you need anything or if everything is OK. But like I said the other two are great. The bus man is on top of it too. Your water glass in never empty. I was disappointed the last time we were there because I had a taste for their Mariquitas, (crispy plantains with pineapple salsa and black bean dip)  and they were out of them. I am not a fan of their Plántanos Maduros which are the sweet plantains, they are just drowning in the honey. bleh. Their mojitos and sangria I thought were decent.

When we arrived on saturday night at 6pm, there weren't that many people around and service was already a little lagging. Took a while for server to come get our drinks. He was really pleasant and nice so that made up for it. Drinks were yummy! Their margaritas and mojitos are delicious so no complaints there! I really really wanted the food to be good reading all the reviews. Got the $20 prix fix menu and was greatly disappointed. The mango avocado salad was soggy and drenched in an unremarkable sauce. I was digging for avocado and found a few bits. Mango was soggy and felt like an afterthought thrown in. I got the crispy roast pork with jalapeno mashed potatoes and corn sauce. The Crispy roast pork was not bad, a little dry but I guess that's why they call it crispy. It was shredded pork, so don't expect any ""meaty"" chunks. The jalapeno mash was alright, not bad but nothing to write home about. The corn sauce around it tasted like cream corn from a can. It was definitely washed out and I love corn sauces, but at a restaurant like that, I was expecting something more memorable.  I loooved the guava cheesecake tho. That was my highlight of the night. It was refreshing and clean.  I really wished it was better, I was rooting for you, Mambo Grill.",0.9929,0.779,0.194,0.026,0.6273333333333332
2009-01-27,3.0,"Date of visit: 01/23/2008, roughly 6 pm. So the Mambo, if you were looking for a big airy, lit environment, this is not the place for you. It had the feel of a ""McDougal"" pub you'd find anywhere in the city with dark heavy wood accent, super low lighting and a loud crowd. I couldn't hear my dining companion a few times and we were sitting right up front, away from the back booths where all the ""action"" was.  It was good to see the restaurant fill up. Reading all the news it's not hard to imagine restaurants like this dying from lack of patronage. But no, this place was packed, and the later the hour grew, the more customers filled up the small entrance into the place. Reminded me of Orange, and how people would dutifully wait in the small waiting area for a table, no one could get out unless you pushed your way through.  Once seated it took about 10 minutes, maybe a bit longer for the server to take care of us. I was a bit bitchy at first, instead of just saying hello when he asked how we were doing; I said ""It took a while for someone to notice us."" He responded that he wasn't told he had a new table to serve. Now when I worked at Orange, no one had to tell me twice that I had a new table to serve. I was a little miffed at his response. Here's this kid working a really sweet job, probably making a sweet dime and he can't even be bothered to look on his own to see if his tables were ready for service? Bullshit, I want his job. Anyway, after I got over myself we both ordered beverages. I had the Mojito (stormy) and my friend had some sort of Sangria mix. I don't recommend the Mojito. It was all lime, a little mint, and not enough Rum!! Maybe on another night when the Mojito isn't half priced, it's better.  For the eats, we both went for the three course option, I chose the Ensalada de Aguacate y Mango Avocado, ripe mango slices, red onion over baby greens and drizzled with a citrus vinaigrette to start and then a Crispy Roast Pork entree with the pork topped on a rounded shape of Jalapeno infused Mash Potatoes, and surrounded with a light amount of sweet cream corn. Actually there was more sweet cream than corn and the cream was really sweet, but it mixed well and absolutely delicious with the Jalapeno mashed potatoes. So what's up with the fru-fru potato presentations? I suppose if you take a relatively cheap ingredient like potatoes and spice it up and make it look weird you're immediately allowed to call it ""fine dining"" and granted license to charge a higher fare. I mean c'mon, just give em to me properly cooked and seasoned.  It seems like most restaurants are doing these little things in hopes of enticing a higher table count. To me, it's just a waste of time. I suppose with high food and operating costs across the board they want to attract the kind of clientele that cares about this sort of thing, so viva le power to the round shaped mash potatoes if it brings in revenue.  I honestly can't remember anything about the pork, as it was dwarfed by the quantity and spicy factor of the potatoes. Well, spicy by my standards anyway. It's interesting when you think about it how much food can be packed when you use one of those round molds for food. Orange uses them as well for its potatoes and eggs (if you were to get them just scrambled). I didn't end up finishing my dish, too many potatoes, but I did take it home. Waste not, want not! Always a good cliché to adhere to, especially on these rare occasions dining out! BUT, with all that said, the entree was pretty delicious overall. And then desert; I should have picked the Chocolate Chipolte cake that my friend had. Instead I had the Brazilian Guava Cheesecake cheesecake. It was okay, if forgettable. Chocolate never goes out of style in my book  Overall, if I have the opportunity, I'd go back.

So when we ordred, we started off with Chips and Salsa, as well as a couple orders of the Ceviche.  Now, the chips are pretty standard Tri-Colored chips, nothing to make me pine for more - however, the salsa itself was amazing.  Both the pico de gallo and the hot salsa hit the spot.  Perfectly flavored, and not over the top with the spice.  The Ceviche as well was excellent.  I have never tried it before at any other place, so by default this ranks as the best - I am not saying it is, but it was good.  You could taste the seafood and the vegetables, which was almost like seafood and pico de gallo. On to my meal - I wrestled back and forth between chicken, then steak, then pork, then back to chicken, then some pork, then steak.. which is where I landed. I went with the Carne Asada Steak cooked medium.  I have to say, I was actually disappointed.  The only real flavor that I got from the meat was burnt/char.  It was chewy, and stringy - which I understand from this cut of steak, but it just seemed a bit over the top.  The tomato guajillo sauce that it was served on did nothing to mask the charred flavor, and actually almost enhanced it. Normally, I can handle the char flavor if the meet is cooked and seasoned well, but the char won.  The rice and beans served on the side were very good, and nicely prepared, but the portion was so small.  You would think for a $17 dish you would get more then a spoonful of rice and beans.   The service was a little off at time too.  We had two people that ordered soda.  One who ordered a diet, and one a regular.  The waitress kept messing them up!  Yah, they look the same, but that is usually a pretty standard thing at tables- multiple drinks in various levels of diet and not diet.

I'm not sure if Mambo Grill is sleeping in Metromix's bed or it's the other way around, but there are about a hundred versions of the mojito in and around Chicago that are 10 times better than this watered-down mint-less concoction. The Brazilian Margarita, on the other hand, is pure perfection [even if I didn't get the salt as requested the last visit]. While the chips, mild salsa del árbol and Pico de Gallo are not plopped onto every table gratis like many places with the same vide, they are worth paying for. The tri-color chips are fresh and crispy and the Pico de Gallo is pure perfection: the perfect combination of chopped tomato, chili, onion and cilantro with just the right amount of tart lime juice. Don't pass on the Ceviche of the day either. The fish is perfectly 'cooked' in a vegetable-rich brine, also perfect with the chips [though you do get chips with the Ceviche order]. The menu is a bit misleading when they tout the Brazilian skirt steak kabobs as ""four marinated skirt steak and pineapple skewers"" and you get two of each. Not a big deal, the 6 inch kabobs are stuffed full and at $7.95 I wasn't about to complain. The skirt steak was decidedly DONE but not to the point of being chewy. I think Mambo does pork better than they do other proteins and while I love their batter-less Chiles Rellenos, I will usually opt for something from the pig. Their pork and potato filled flautas are rich and crispy with succulent pork and melty Chihuahua cheese; the guacamole to accompany adds further to the rich mouth feel and deliciousness. Too, the Mango Chutney Pork Loin is highly flavored thanks in part to the chipotle rub. The play of sweet and hot works perfect with the tender pork. More please.

The alcohol specialty at Mambo seems to be the mojitos. Friday nights are 1/2 off mojitos which brings a pitcher down from $30 to $15. NEVER order a pitcher at full price. They were decent mojitos, but $30 seems insane, especially given the amount of ice they use.... All in all it was decent food. I was satisfied with my meal and emerged overstuffed. However, I later remembered I could get better food for cheaper in a quieter setting elsewhere in the city.",0.9736,0.788,0.148,0.064,0.6061772486772486
2007-09-12,3.0,"Decent grub, but not worth the price.  That is what comes to mind right away. The only part of the meal that gets five stars was the Hongo Relleno -- it was absolutely delicious.  It is a Portobella Cap covered with a mixture of delicious mixed cheese, pico de gallo, mushrooms, and some other ingredients that give it an amazing taste.  It has a bit of spice, but with the full taste of the mushroom wrapped with the cheese and sweetness of the pico de gallo.  Splendid. The bread and flavored butter the brought out at the beginning was fairly good for a starter.  I had read on here that many people thought the guacamole and chips were good, but I found that underwhelming -- tri colored chips straight from a bag and lacking any unique flavor, and a forgettable guac.  The pico that came with was good, but the chips sort of took away from the whole taste. The mojitos were indeed good, but I don't know if I would go as far as saying they are the ""best"" in Chicago, but they aren't bad.  Avoid the coconut colada -- disgusting.   As for the entrees, they were flavorful, but seemed sort of cliche.  I had the Crispy Roast Pork, which had an interesting mixture of flavors with the unique twist being the puree creamed corn that made a sort of gravy for the jalepeno potatoes and pork.  The name is misleading though, because there isn't anything about it that it crispy.  My dining partner had the Tequila Marinated Skirt Steak done medium rare.  It was very tender, but tasted a lot like a much cheaper Carne Asada I had at Nueva Leon (albeit a lot more tender and juicy).  And the potato fried were just potato wedges covered in olive oil sauce or ""chimichurri"" sauce.  Not bad, but again, I am not having cravings over it.  My dining companion had plate envy. I will give them some mad props for a well done Key Lime Pie, except the garnish sauce next to it was some bitter white disgustingness that never should have been on the same plate with the key lime pie.   The decor is nice.  The feeling is River North pretentiousness, and if you like that, go for it.  Our server was sort of a silent pompous jerk.  He knew what he was doing, which is always a plus, but he sort of quit paying attention to us when a party of six came in, and took forever to bring us our check.  He was all over us when it came to try and push the expensive rum into the mojito, but to find out if we needed anything, don't even expect helpfulness.  Perhaps the other servers are better, like the female that picked up my credit card while the guy was off waiting for drinks at the bar for the table of six while watching a soccer match on the TV.   Overall, I don't think I will be going back anytime soon.  Unless it is for an appetizer .  That was awesome.  Or maybe lunch.",0.9968,0.796,0.158,0.047,0.5761144883485309

This option was meant to be shared, we didn't come close to finishing it, and I nibbled at it all throughout the meal. The salsas--one chunky/fresca, the other liquid were both nicely spicy and flavorful.  For an entree I ordered a Fricassee de Pollo which came out of the kitchen piping hot and tender enough that I could probably have cut it with a fork. The spices were a little too subtle for me, (maybe the slightly-too-strong mojito killed my taste buds) though my bf enjoyed his bites of it. I tried a little of the skirt steak and found the texture very nice, you'll see more of that in Kengo H.'s review.

She already told you about the service, their sourdough, guacamole (which I admittedly like it chunkier) and the dessert, so I won't mention them further.  My skirt steak had a lovely texture, but it tasted a little too charred. My first bite-impressions were that it was overseared, with the bitter aroma overpowering any subtleties the meat or its marinade may have once possessed. I actually do not recommend this dish, though it might just have been a bad day -- one of the three pieces was grilled tolerably well, though not quite to perfection. We probably should've traded our entrees, as I quite enjoyed Kate's Fricassee de Pollo. The subtle flavours were quite lovely, with good vegetable stock being used for the sauce base. Without having tasted this dish, I probably would've awarded this restaurant three stars, not four.

Caipirinha for you... Caipirinha for me... for me... i lost track.. :).",0.5574,0.848,0.113,0.039,0.6907142857142857

2005-08-18,5.0,"One of the few woman-owned restuarants, I had a good feeling Mambo Grill would satisfy my current Caribbean kick. It's been around for many years, and I vaguely recall having lunch there once. After last night, I'm kicking myself for not going sooner. There's outdoor seating, but it's a bit noisy with downtown traffic on Clark St. Inside it's small but comfortable. I prefer smaller restaurants because the service is inevitably better as you get more attention, which was certainly true here. They had a half-price special on a pitcher of white and red sangria with two dinners, which was tasty.  The menu has a strong Cuban influence, with Guava Glazed Paella different kinds of sweet potato sides, and plantanos maduros (sweet plaintains sauteed in butter, brown sugar and honey, which was just slightly too sweet for me). I had the Moqueca de Camaron (Brazilian style shrimp sauteed with poblano and jalapeno peppers, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice and coconut milk over coconut rice) which was delicious. I sampled the coconnut-curried tilapia, which was just as great, and similar to something I've been making recently.  They threw in a free piece of cheesecake for the birthday girl in the party, and when they forgot to bag my leftover plaintains (huge portion for an appetizer), they gave me a fresh batch, so extra points! Afterwards, avoid traffic while you walk off the food coma and go along the riverfront. What the heck happened to the link option??  mambogrill.com",0.9953,0.774,0.209,0.017,0.47460317460317464

2005-07-29,4.0,"Mambo Grill has a somewhat anonymous location just off an alley, but once inside you will be glad you came in. It is not a large restaurant, with some seating outside and some on the lower level for parties. The interiors are dim but still colorful, and the music with a Latin beat is infectious. The bar is very popular and serves up a long list of fancy drinks. The food is good, although I think the overall quality has slipped a bit in the last few years. The free basket of fresh bread and spreads starts dinner off well. There are various versions of chicken and pork dishes that attempt to take your taste buds away to the Caribbean or Latin America. The black bean soup and veggie empanadas are good. The lunch service is surprisingly quick, and the hearty sandwiches are usually the way to go here. The desserts are very rich, with the chipotle chocolate cake being perhaps the best choice once you get past the initially bizarre combination. I do miss the excellent tres leches cake, which was served here a few years ago.",0.9927,0.746,0.219,0.035,0.4921428571428571

The prices are decent, but the best part is the outdoor patio that is perfect for people-watching. It gives you a very summer-in-the-city feel, and it's perfect for having a dinner with a group of friends.",0.9759,0.673,0.327,0.0,0.738095238095238
