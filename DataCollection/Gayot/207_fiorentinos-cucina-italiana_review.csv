Lovely, personal, family owned restaurant with great authentic Italian meals and a fabulous wine list. I almost always get the Ricotta Stuffed Gnocchi, but have tried most of the menu through others, everything is delicious and cooked to perfection!

Everything was mediocre. The indoor patio looks much prettier in the photos. In reality it looks tired and dingy. The floor looks dirty. Overall it just looks like it needs to be refreshed. Maybe those lights have been hanging there too long.  But to be clear it is  not an outdoor patio. It is enclosed on 3 sides. The ""ceiling"" is plastic with some grubby looking corrugated sheets visible through it. Not romantic and cozy. More like dingy & in need of cleaning.

Very helpful and attentive. He joked along with me and make sure that we had a nice dinner. To start I had a dirty martini which was made perfectly. My boyfriend had a negroni which was also nice. We went right into the mains. I had the risotto special with beets and my boyfriend got the manicotti. We had a side of brussels sprouts with it. I'm not over the trend yet. Everything was delicious and well made. I think for the price point you get good bang-for-the-buck. Its not fancy, and I'm not sure if everything is made in-house, but what we had was pretty good.

2015-05-30,4.0,"This place has been a favorite of mine and my husband's for about 7 years. We love the outdoor seating area and the ambience. It's a local favorite.  Overall, it's good. Some minor tweaks that would make good food, even better food. We started with the calamari. The calamari, is good, but I think they should experiment cooking it a tad longer for a more ""golden"" calamari. The coloring is a little light which isn't terrible but I think it could have used another minute.  I also would strongly recommend they serve the calamari with a warm tomato sauce vs. cold. It just didn't pair properly. Maybe it's supposed to be warm, but ours seemed like it was intended to be cold. Just seemed odd.  I enjoyed my entree dish. I had the clams with linguini and chose the white wine sauce. It was quite good - loved the flavor of the sauce and the pasta was perfectly cooked. They could have cleaned the clams a little better - I had tasted sand, which is bound to happen but it was kinda more than anticipated. The other tweak - and it's picky I know - but I would have thought they could have sprinkled some fresh flat leaf parsley on top of the center of the dish. Again, very good - but it was like ""oh, there's just a lot of minced clams in the center of the plate. Alright.""Some parsley could have brightened up the dish a little.  My husband had his staple favorite - gnocchi with tomato cream sauce. This place has the best gnocchi I have ever had in my life - and I have been to Italy. Their gnocchi are just perfect pillows of ricotta. I strongly recommend this dish and it's just under $17.  Overall a great experience.

Mondays there is a special on wine - 50% off.  It was a nice surprise.  Bread was fresh and rather normal. We started with a grilled octopus -- it was the best part of the meal and we really enjoyed it. We both ordered a special, but the food was mostly ordinary -- neither were ""special"" in flavor and my risotto (sausage and broccoli) was even bland.   We finished off with a tiramisu, which was a large portion and good, but not to die for. Overall it was a nice ambiance and okay food, but I don't see a reason to visit when I can go to one of the other local restaurants that is just plain amazing.",0.9831,0.767,0.223,0.01,0.5390151515151514
2015-05-10,3.0,"I had been looking forward to trying Fiorentino's for some time, and I was kind of disappointed. It's not bad, but it's certainly not any better than most Chicago Italian joints. For example, the rock shrimp risotto had decent flavor, but it wasn't made with arborio rice. It was pretty clearly made with long grain white rice, and the creaminess was faked with the mascaropone cheese they added. Lame. I've made much more authentic and delicious risotto at home. The signature dish of homemade pasta stuffed with crab and artichoke in a vodka sauce was pretty decent, but overly heavy, so not authentic Italian. The Nana's ""Have a Bite"" was pretty unique, with two meatballs served with a salad in viniagrette. Eating the meatballs together with the salad was pretty good -- on their own, the meatballs were a little bland. My husband had the minestrone soup, and he thought that was also unremarkable. The best thing I ate there was by far the apple, mission fig and blue cheese salad. It was nicely dressed and good proportions. The service was pretty average, not especially attentive, but the person bussing our table stacked someone else's dirty dishes on our table when he was clearing ours, which I think is pretty tacky (and unappetizing). The dining room felt like a flurry of clanging dishes when we first sat down, as several tables at once were cleared at once -- I get it, they have to be cleared, but it was really disruptive. All together, the place was only ok. I won't be rushing back, but if you're satisfied with average, Chicago-style Italian, and you aren't hoping for something more authentic or interesting, you may be just fine with this place. It was easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night last minute. So it has that going for it.",0.9963,0.73,0.218,0.052,0.5947330447330448

She had the fruta de Mar and loved it.  One mussel was empty.  And the clams were quite small.  But good flavor.  I had the tortillini also really good and filling. I felt like the drinks were a little over priced for the neighborhood and alcohol level.  But I think I'll be back.

I'm so bummed that I did not catch the charge on the kids drinks til I got home! I would have like to clarify the drink & the side of bread that should have come with the kids meals to the waiter, who was nice & attentive enough.  I'm on the fence if we'll be back.

Your meal begins with warm bread.  Fiorentino's passes this most critical Italian restaurant test.  The olive oil on the table was fantastic. My girl and I ordered the crusty garlic bread ($4).  It wasn't particularly notable, and I actually preferred the complimentary bread provided.  I prefer a creamy, soft garlic bread to a hard, crusty version.  Skip this. I love my entree - penne alla siciliana ($16.50).  Penne pasta with eggplant and fresh mozzerella in marinara.  The fresh mozzerella was a revelation... a creamy bite of gold mixed in with the hot marinara.  Pretty fantastic. My girlfriend ordered the portobello ravioli ($16.95) and I had a bite.  Very smooth and mild.  If you like mushrooms, this is your jam. The portions are huge.  I could only get through about half of my dish. We finished by sharing a slice of key lime pie ($8).  Nothing special about this.

I don't know.  I was seated in the patio, which was absolutely beautiful. I ordered bruschetta and some pasta dish that was wonderful. My mother ordered a fettucine Alfredo (which was not on the menu).  The bruschetta was crisp, the tomatoes were flavorful, filled with garlic and basil, and tasted just plain fresh. The bread was a bit burnt, but still delish.  My mother's alfredo was quite strange. It wasn't anything that I had tasted before. I wasn't really a fan, but my mother was.  The waitress was a bit rude and acted like we did not know how to i don't know, I guess be in a restaurant? She treated us a bit like foreigners and made sure to talk extra slow and be extra understanding in explaining things. (Lol I know how to order things??) We were not checked up on and water ran low for quite a bit, until I flagged down a bus boy.  Apparently, they were giving out mothers day coupons or something, which I was not offered, but the table next to me was, which I found offending also. The food was lovely but service, not so much.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive as well as patient when we took forever to order. We had calamari and bruschetta for appetizers. The bruschetta was great, but at 4 pieces per order a bit on the expensive and small side. The calamari was extremely tasty. The breading was light and buttery and really let you enjoy the taste of the calamari instead of just the fried breading.  I had the seafood pasta dish with spicy red sauce. It was a massive order that I couldn't come close to finishing. It was very tasty with just the right amount of spiciness. My wife had spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely amazing.  There was a small hiccup when our orders were brought out, and the plates were given to the wrong people. Not necessarily the waiter's fault, but he offered to buy us dessert to make up for it.

2014-05-17,1.0,"Fiorentino's offers a more-or-less classic Italian-American menu. When we arrived for dinner on a Saturday, we saw several large groups and families enjoying themselves. The atmosphere was cozy, festive, and child-friendly. The service was good; we were treated quite well by all of the staff. Unfortunately, some of the food was astonishingly bad, especially given the prices (e.g., $26 for seafood linguine fra diavolo). The two dishes that tasted good were the brussels sprouts side and the grilled octopus appetizer. The other dishes were worse than what most adults could cook at home or buy from a greasy pizza-and-pasta takeout restaurant. I know teenagers who cook better than this. Grilled octopus: The octopus was cooked very well. However, it was smothered in vinaigrette that was cloyingly sweet and lacking nuance.  Fig and apple ""crostini"": This appetizer looked like a quick, easy snack that someone would make with whatever they had in the kitchen. I would be content to eat something like this at home; I was surprised that a restaurant would serve it to paying customers. Instead of dainty crostini with a nutty toast flavor, these ""crostini"" were pieces of bread that had been sliced too thickly and not toasted or grilled until brown. The slice of apple on top was too thickly sliced, so that it didn't balance with the fig. Eggplant parmigiana: This dish had a thin, runny marinara sauce that tasted like sweetened pasta sauce from a can. The sauce was not well melded with the fried eggplant, and it didn't have the flavors or consistency that would be developed by baking in the oven; it looked like it had been poured over the eggplant. A sheet of rubbery cheese was melted on top of the sauce, also not baked in the oven with the rest of the dish. It was served next to overcooked penne in a puddle of undrained water. It was obvious that the ketchup-sweet marinara sauce had not been tossed with the pasta in the pan to evenly coat it, but was simply poured on top of the pasta. A comparison to bad school cafeteria food would not be unfair. Linguine fra diavolo: The linguine was so overcooked that it was mushy and fell apart. The shellfish was also overcooked. Garlic in the dish was chopped in large, lopsided chunks; the sloppiness of the knife work was almost comical. The sauce was also too sweet. Brussels sprouts: This side dish tasted okay. It's not difficult to find other restaurants in Chicago that serve brussels sprouts more inventively or with superior execution, but at least it was not embarrassingly bad. The bad dishes were so inexplicably bad that I puzzled over why the restaurant was crowded with diners. It was awkward to politely eat such bad (and not cheap!) food while receiving friendly and attentive service. Despite the good service and cozy atmosphere, I can not recommend Fiorentino's to anyone.",0.9306,0.815,0.115,0.07,0.6011904761904762
2014-04-27,4.0,"Fiorentino's is a family owned, charming, authentic Italian restaurant.  We hadn't been here in years, but one day, as we were driving along Ashland, we made the the spontaneous decision to stop by for dinner.  I'm now mad that we hadn't been back in years because we were missing out.   We were sat in the covered garden area, and our server was nice and attentive and did his job well.  They have a nice selection of Italian wines, and the list is reasonably priced and approachable.  For starters, we had the grilled baby octopus and the beef carpaccio.   There was a nice char on the tips of the octopus and the marinade was nice and bright.  The carpaccio was very traditional and, of course, great.  On both dishes there was an ample amount of greens, so if you order either of these starters you don't need a salad.   For entrees, we had the portobello mushroom ravioli and the Vitello Milanese.  I'm a complete sucker for a good mushroom-pasta dish, and this one hit the mark.  The veal was crunchy but not dry.   For dessert, of course we had to have the Tiramisu.  Overall, it was an extremely solid, authentic, and delicious experience.  This is one of those restaurants where I wish there was a rating between 4 and 5.

2014-03-20,5.0,"Fiorentino's offers Italian dining at it's finest. The quaint and inviting eatery sits on Ashland Avenue, a bustling city street but you would never know it once inside. The warm interior welcomes you with soft lighting and subtle decor. They also have one of the best patios in the city. Though it stays enclosed year round you feel like you are sitting at an outdoor Italian cafe. Beautiful floral designs and greenery encompass the space which is kept heated in the winter and open and airy in the summer. A welcoming environment and the most gracious service upon my entry had me eager to sit down and enjoy the full dinner experience. We were spoiled with an eclectic offering of some of Fiorentino's most popular menu items including some options from their all new Gluten-Free menu. To kick-off our hearty Italian meal we were served the traditional arancini along with fried calamari. Both dishes were cooked perfectly and rich in flavor. Once the food started to be served it seemed like the neverending meal as we were spoiled with one delicacy after another. Other starters included their Mission Fig, Apple, and Bleu Cheese Salad as well as the Red and Golden Beet Salad. Both were incredibly fresh with unique flavors that married perfectly together. We were then greeted with plates of Carpaccio Di Manzo and Ahi Tuna Carpaccio. Both the beef and tuna were sliced so impressively thin and served with the quintessential accompaniments. The tuna was dressed with a lemon vinagarette that brought out the flavor of the whole dish then topped with capers and shaved fennel all sitting among fresh arugula. The Beef Carpaccio was also served with arugula and capers as well as Parmigiano Reggiano. Next came the entrees and Fiorentino's was not holding back. We were served 4 main dishes, 2 of which are also brought out gluten-free. Their popular Portobello Mushroom Ravioli and Stuffed Gnocchi are offered on both menus and both versions were served at our special dinner. Though you could taste a slight difference between the two versions, both were very enjoyable. And to be perfectly honest, if you were only served the gluten-free option I don't think you'd notice. That's how slight the difference was between the two. And what would an Italian meal be without some hearty meatballs! Niente! And these meatballs were the real deal. They were robust, meaty, and super tasty. But handsdown my favorite entree of the evening was the classic Italian Cippino - grilled seafood platter. The dish looked like a work of art as it came out offering an abundance of shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, and calamari sitting atop a silver platter as it should be! We couldn't possibly end our incredible meal without some dessert even if we were all stuffed to our gills. So we concluded dinner with Fiorentino's Deconstructed Cannoli (aka the Cannoli Dream) as well as their Pistachio Gelato and their Napoleon Gelato which by the way are Gluten-Free and you would NEVER know.... seriouly NEVER! I loved the idea of serving the cannoli inside out if you will. It allows you to taste every part of the sweet treat. And the gelato was delicious. I personally preferred the Napoleon flavor. There is no question I would return to this lovel Italian eatery in Lakeview and recommend it to you. Put it on your list of restaurants you MUST visit!

Fiorentino's staff certainly make you feel as welcome as an authentic Fiorentino when you enter. First off, the atmosphere is warm and very romantic.  Our party sat in the garden area outside, but the inside seemed just as nice. Our server, Katy, was AMAZING.  She got my OCD order just right and kept checking back on our table to refresh drinks and make sure we were happy. Since our get-together was a reunion, we chatted so long we actually closed the joint! I really appreciated that they didn't hover around our table and pressure us to leave like The Greek Islands is so famous for. The Fiorentino staff was totally chill about it and because of that, we have told all our friends that this little place is a neighborhood gem. In fact, we will be meeting our friends there in two weeks! The food was amazing.  My husband ordered their Chicken dinner with roasted red peppers and practically licked his plate.  No, seriously...he ALMOST did until I stopped him! I ordered a entree' sized salad with Chicken on it. It was very filling and made exactly as I ordered. We shared a grilled calamari appetizer that was perfectly prepared. The prices were reasonable, (except for the liquor) the service was AMAZING and the food was authentically home-made.  Who needs the fancy-shmancy places when you've got a place that treats you like family? We didn't want to go home!

UPDATE- We went back.  I've got to say, wow.  Again, we were blown away.   Frankly, I think that the owners must train their staff exceptionally well or weed out servers with a chip on their shoulder because our waiter, Mike was just as friendly and adaptable to my OCD-idness as our last server, Katy. Even the bus boys seem to genuinely like their job. They were so friendly and helpful with whatever we needed. Like I promised, we decided to dip our taste buds into the gluten-free frenzy.  My husband ordered the Steak from their new gluten-free menu.  He said the seasonings were 'strange' and he definitely wouldn't recommend this particular dish.    I had the Gluten-free Seafood Linguine and LOVED it.  My friend ordered the mixed grilled Seafood (also from the gluten-free menu).  So I'm sure that will have to be the next pit stop on our adventure through the Fiorentino menu. Our whole table shared a Cannoli with shaved dark Chocolate and it was just enough sweet to go well with coffee and a heated conversation about Politics and Religion.  Let me say ordering the desert was sooooo worth it, even though I had to muddle through obama economics....

Unfortunately, most of us left disappointed last night.  Did we have some good food - yes.  But we all left with the same impression - okay food, mediocre service at best, and simply not worth the money given other great options for neighborhood Italian fare.  In my first review, I said I think I just ordered the wrong dish.  This trip I ordered the Salmon and it was just okay.  They were trying hard to upsell us to the $30 entree specials and when they asked how everything was - I commented that the Salmon was just okay and the response was simply - ""told you that you should have gotten the special"".  Really?  Service was an issue last night and they kept commenting that they had a big party in the other room but others seemed to be getting their food before us so it really just felt like an off night for us.  Sometimes a second visit to a restaurant confirms the place as a keeper - for me - this second trip confirmed that there are MUCH better neighborhood Italian restaurants for the money.",0.9777,0.762,0.165,0.073,0.3473487773487773

2012-07-02,1.0,"Let me start off by saying that i've been in the food and beverage industry for thirteen years and love going out and experiencing the great places Chicago has to offer.  Some are good and some are bad but this is the first time I have actually wrote a review.  When someone writes a review it is usually not a positive review and so is the case with this one.        I live in the area and pass the place everytime I go to and from Jewel and is a place I have always wanted to try.  So my date and I wanted to go out to eat at a place that had a patio so we went here.  We walk in; the decor on the inside is nice and inviting and request to be sat on the patio.  As soon as we walk out the door we quickly realize that the entire patio is enclosed with plastic and actually has a/c so im assuming they never actually use the patio in the traditional sense. We sit down at the table and review the menu which looks good on paper; thats about it.  Our server Daniel? (tall, lanky guy) started off the whole dining experience in a very awkward way.  We said we would just need a few minutes to look things over (wine list, menu, etc.) but continued to stand there awkwardly for about ten seconds not saying a word then walked away leaving my date and I looking at each other and wondering if he was on some sort of drugs.  We finally decided on a wine selection and waited for a good amount of time before we just told the busser what we wanted, he seemed more attentive with our table than our actual server.  We finally got our wine which was not quality at all, figured out what we wanted and then our awkward waiter finally came over and took our order but then again just stood at our table after we were done ordering as if he wanted us to give him more items to order; we did not.  My date ordered the Bolognese and I ordered the Chicken fettuccine alfredo.  The fettuccine wasnt bad in taste, a little overboard with the oil (take some home and reheat it and youll understand) and nutmeg?  Yes, had a strong nutmeg flavor.  But its the bolognese that was piss poor, Chef Boyardee could have done better.  In fact my date took some home and added a few more ingredients like sugar (key ingredient in a good bolognese sauce) garlic salt, etc.  You get the picture. We finished, had the busser box up our food and then cue awkward server.  He came over asked if we would care for any desert, we didnt, then stood there again as in disbelief we didnt want anything else.         Basically what i'm getting at is that the place looks great from the outside but enter at your own risk at what you'll encounter inside.  Very strange experience and I highly recommend staying away, especially for the price.  Many other great places around the area for italian (La Gondola, Via Carducci, etc.)  Hope this review has helped you all out.",0.9894,0.825,0.115,0.06,0.5659310081951592

Parking is convenient, which is an immediate plus.  This part of Ashland kind of seems like a ghost town in terms of nightlife, so you'll be fine if you need to park on the street.   We had a reservation but we had to wait when we arrived.  Kind of annoying.  Especially since the wait was almost 30 minutes.  We had to crowd in the back by the tiny bar and just stand while we waited for people to vacate our table.  At least there was wine.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is wonderful.  Dimly lit (but not dark), romantic, lights strung up on the walls and cozy (but not in a super uncomfortable way).  Even with a packed house, the place didn't seem too loud and this would be a great place for a date (or a double date in our case).   The food was delicious.  The portions are enormous, so plan to take your food home.  I had the gnocci, which was fabulous.  The alfredo sauce was rich with just the right amount of herb and spice and everything was piping hot when it arrived.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals, as well.  The prix fixe menu was a nice way to try the meals Fiorentino's wanted to showcase and they cook them well.  Lots of wine available for purchase, too, so go nuts.   Oh, and the bread pudding.  FANTASTIC.  Literally amazing.  So good.  I love bread pudding and this really was some of the best I've had.  Get it for dessert when you come.  It's excellent. This is the point where I say the service was terrible.  Like so many other reviewers, the service was unbelievably slow and by the end of the meal (and that entire bottle of wine) we were tired, a little cranky and just wanted to get out of the restaurant.  Our waiter was MIA several times throughout the evening and we couldn't even find him when we just wanted to pay and get out of there.  This really put a damper on the entire experience.  I like to spend my time eating, drinking and socializing with friends over good food and good wine... but not hours and hours and hours.  At some point it gets ridiculous, and that's what happened at Fiorentino's.",0.9972,0.735,0.2,0.066,0.6485476190476192

He then waited about 15 minutes before reappearing with the dinner for my date, which was clearly just cooked. His was tolerable. My fettucini was utterly lackluster. We ordered a bottle of pino noir from the awkward waiter who only visited us again to bring us the check and then disappear for an amount of time that made you wonder what the hell he was doing back there since we were one of three couples in the restaurant. By the end of the meal, my date and I were trying to finish the wine (the only actual good part of the meal) as fast as we could so we could leave.  We had barely touched our meals but the waiter reappeared to bring a tray of desserts we quickly denounced and left. This restaurant left much to be desired in taste and on a Friday night, and we will not be repeating our visit. Next time I think I'll opt for the longer walk, and actually enjoy the taste of my meal, esp. when dropping some $70 bucks on it.",0.8257,0.894,0.07,0.035,0.44619047619047614

I had the calamari (better than Piccolo Sogno), and the rigatoni (phenomenal).  Our waitress was as sweet and attentive as possible (wish I remembered her name to give her credit).  The heated patio is adorable, but getting into and out of the restaurant (bathrooms especially) is a risky situtation.   DEFINITELY recommend for a date, I can't imagine that there is a more delicious rigatoni on this continent. :)",0.9724,0.719,0.24,0.041,0.7566666666666667

2011-12-24,2.0,"I went to this restaurant hoping for greatness, maybe that was where I went wrong.   After being seated, watered, and breaded (mediocre bread basket, btw), we sat for 20 minutes without service before I finally decided to take action. I went to the hostess to ask where our server was because I wanted to order an appetizer and a glass of wine-ok, there seemed to be some confusion and somehow they had overlooked us but the waiter was very apologetic and gave me my glass of wine on the house-a nice gesture.  The fried calamari: the breading, although light and airy, was bland and flavorless.  It was served with a side of watered down cocktail sauce...not tradition marinara like any other italian restaurant I've dined at. Our dishes: Mine was traditional oven baked lasagna.  It had meat, spinach, mushrooms, and melted mozzarella.  It was ok.  I think most of the flavor/it's only redeeming quality was from the ground beef. Boyfriend had eggplant parmigiana, which was soggy and flavorless.  It was served with a side of pasta.  He thought he could prepare this dish better at home, and he did not finish eating it. Both of our dishes were swimming in a pool of generic, watery red sauce.  For the most part, my experience with the staff was good but as far as the food is concerned, it's just ""meh"".   And even if we HAD liked our dishes, there wasn't even enough left over to take home.  At $15 a dish, I'd expect more.",0.9655,0.893,0.089,0.018,0.5441239316239316

Our waitress was very talkative and explained to us that Fiorentino's goes for a simple, rustic flavor with a few local ingredients, as opposed to a lot of complex, exotic flavors. My tortellini was perfectly cooked with nicely salty pancetta and peas.  The olive oil at the table is worth noting, with very rich flavors, but the bread is pretty lackluster Italian white loaf.   The ambiance is very nice and romantic inside, although a little cramped.  A table was close to the main aisle near the front desk and it became a traffic issue when the man at the table decided to stand up for no reason and block everyone's way.

2011-09-12,3.0,"Oh Fiorentino's, you were so, so close to being a surprising 4-star discovery. We stumbled in here after attempting to use a Groupon across the street at La Gondola without a reservation. We were craving chicken parm, so when La Gondola had zero openings all night, we walked over the Fiorentino's instead. It was nowhere near crowded, and we were seated immediately on the adorable patio. Our server was very friendly, albeit a little overly attentive.  We were a little surprised to see the menu was set up a bit differently than the one saw online, and the prices were a few dollars higher, but we let it slide since they still had the chicken parm we wanted. We ordered fried calamari, a Caesar salad, the chicken parm, and a side of pappardella with bolognase sauce, all to split. Everything was generally pretty good, and we were all set to give it a 4-star review. And then the check came.  First, we saw we were charged a $6 fee for them to split our chicken parm on two plates. I recalled seeing this charge on the menu, but thought it referred to splitting the bill. Plus we mentioned we were splitting it, but never asked for them to split it for us, and the server never mentioned the charge. Next we saw that the pasta side dish was $5, despite being listed as $3 on the menu. On top of that, our chicken parm came with a side of pasta in the first place, and in my opinion a good server would have mentioned this (the menu did not) when he saw we were ordering a separate side of pasta. All in all, the poor service and misleading pricing was a complete turnoff, and our otherwise lovely dinner ended on a very sour note.",0.9403,0.883,0.085,0.032,0.6128395061728393

They topped the halibut with a slightly crispy layer of gravlax  and capers. My mouth is still watering.  After one bite I turned to my date and said, ""If they have cannoli here, we're getting it.""  They did....but it wasn't a traditional cannoli.  it was ""deconstructed"" cannoli.  Let me state for the record that a cannoli doesn't need any cosmetic improvements.  It doesn't need any boosted up or injected flavors or painted on extras. Just like that Bruno Mars tune- It is perfect and beautiful just the way it is. So, I clung to my skepticism until I tasted it....and it was good.  I still think it looked a little silly in the presentation (kinda like guac and chips) but it was still the simple sweet cheesy goodness that makes it one of my favorite desserts.",0.9966,0.759,0.203,0.038,0.5694581280788177

Their pastas are homemade and they are fabulous - seriously can't go wrong with any selection.  Personally, I love the rigatoni with sweet Italian sausage, mushrooms and tomato cream sauce.  The stuffed gnocchi is incredible too. the last time I was here, I had the Osso Buco - perfect.  Fell off the bone and the sauce was delicious. OK  so i would have given Fiorentino's 5 stars, but my only complaint is their dessert selection.  Meh.  Not wonderful, not all that inspired. In typical old-school Italian fashion, they cart out the ole dessert tray, filled with about 6 selections, but they don't look that appetizing.  The tiramisu was too soggy.   But I've been here 3 times and I would absolutely come back.  Just skip dessert.",0.9896,0.753,0.207,0.04,0.5652910052910052
2010-11-09,4.0,"Great place to take a date!    We went on a Monday night so it wasn't very busy, but they still took care in seating us so there was a two table separation between people.   It is bigger  than I expected (looks small from the outside) with three separate rooms for dining.  The outdoor/four-season room was well-heated despite being a cool night in November.  The entire place has adorable decor with quite a romantic vibe. Our server was very good, highly attentive.  They brought comp birthday desserts to the table next us. Their menu is pretty extensive and that includes seasonal dishes as well (I had the pumpkin ravioli).  Be forewarned that the desserts on the display are significantly smaller than the actual desserts.  If you're remotely full, you should definitely split one. Drink/wine list is also extensive. All in all, great dinner and ambience.  Would be good for groups as well.  Check online at  restaurant.com  as they have $25 certificates for $3 (with promo codes), but make sure to read the fine lines as you have to spend at least $50 to be able to use it.  Sorta pricey ~$18pumpkin ravioli - $34 filet), but worth the spend.",0.9939,0.769,0.22,0.011,0.5231687242798354

The food was just ok.  The menu is fairly limited, which I usually like.  In this case, it just lacked in diversity, a little.  As a group of 8 we ordered a little of everything.  I won't speak for everyone; however, my wife and I were rather underwhelmed.  My ruccola salad, was just that, ruccola, with a lemon dressing that was too tart and could not be softened by any amount of parmigiano.  Dissapointing.  As for a tortellini dish, though tasty, it was pretty standard.  My wife's veal was not very good, and garnished with the aforementioned ruccola.  A squash soup was ok, but again, not inventive.  I tasted the arancini appetizer, which was better. All in all, portions are copious, but the dishes very uninventive: definitely not simple in the right way. Our waiter looked out of place and was running around, making us wait, not long, but still. My conclusion, based on a cost of $40+ for two an appetizer, an entree and one glass of wine each, this place is expensive for a very basic meal.  I would not go back there, except maybe to eat a big dish of comfort food pasta.",0.9128,0.89,0.081,0.029,0.4294095397356266

Even on a Friday night, it wasn't too busy so we easily got a table outside so we could have a dinner under the stars!  OK, there was a tarp and we're in the middle of Chicago so no stars to be seen, but being outside while still warm was nice. We picked out a bottle of white wine.  It was one of the featured selections and it was so good I took a picture of the label so we could buy some more later.  Great price too. Next up was a Caesar salad.  The dressing had a lot of flavor for how light it was.  A good balance.  Not my favorite Caesar, I like my very creamy, but definitely solid.  Also, good bread and olive oil on the side.  Parmesan cheese at the table was also a nice addition. My GF had the gnocchi (we did not know everybody on yelp raved about it) and found it incredible.  It was light and pillowy but still again with tons of flavor.  I had the specialty pasta which was a black fettuccine with sundried tomatoes, and shrimp.  It had a really nice creamy taste which balanced a cheesy Alfredo flavor with a seafood seasoning.  Not as good as her gnocchi (Nochi? Nocky? Ganochi?) but again, very solid. And then we had some chocolate balls for desert.   TL;DR - Gnocchi is great, great ambiance, good prices.  Find me a better Italian place in Lakeview that is better.",0.9982,0.718,0.276,0.006,0.45533333333333337

As soon as you step in the door you are effectively insulated from the outside surroundings. We were greeted warmly, and taken immediately to a table...good timing because 10 minutes later, there was a 20 minute wait. Bread and water were placed immediately. The bread was fresh and basic. Our waiter was prompt in greeting us and bringing nice glasses of moderately priced house chardonnay - tasty if nothing special. Nice extensive menu of traditional Italian fare. We opted for appetizers of the crab cakes, and the Arancini (fried rice balls stuffed with mozzarella and italian sausage). Both were good - the crab cake was large and fresh, although i found the accompanying sauce to be a bit mismatched. The arancini was excellent - paired with a wonderful marinara. I had the Pasta Mirabella - denoted as the house specialty - very nice mix of ingredients - good sized shrimp and scallops, sun-dried tomatoes, and asparagus - in a rich ""light"" alfredo-style sauce. Half the portion would have left me stuffed. My partner had the veal marsala - thumbs up on the marsala sauce, with the veal preparation a bit inconsistent - half cooked nicely, the other half a bit overcooked. This all left no room for desert. Overall, atmosphere was very warm and comfortable while not stuffy, service was a bit rushed and impersonal (our server at least), but adequate, and the food was better than average. great place for a gathering of friends or family, or a nice understated romantic dinner.

Food: 4 stars I was not that impressed with the house bread, some was a little hard, that being said I ate 3 pieces ! Split the giant crab cake, I was not as impressed as other reviewers, it was good but not worth the $13.  We also split the stuffed gnocchi with the ragu sauce which were very good though somehow each was a different texture, and the Penne alla Siciliana (eggplant with mozzarella) which I though was better, the eggplant had great flavor, and was even better for lunch the next day !!  Bonus points for Fresh Parmesan on the table, negative points for it being grated and not shredded ! Service: fine, though my water glass was empty more than once, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe I am just excessively thirsty !

2010-07-25,1.0,"This place was not very good.  The service was incredibly slow and the food lacked flavor.  We started with the bruschetta which was presented on slighlty charred bread which overpowered the bland tomato topping.  Adding some salt, pepper, parmesean, olive oil and anything else I could find on the table to add flavor could not save it.  This is the city, not the suburbs.  It is okay to not serve bland food! Next, I had the rigatoni with sausage.  The pasta was cooked fine; however, there was a lot of added pepper throughout the dish which overpowered it.  The sausage was okay and I think I would have liked the tomato sauce had all the excess pepper not been added.  And then it took FOREVER for our check or also a check-in after our meal arrived.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when I do not get a new glass of wine when the entree arrives.  Our waiter did not come back to check in on us between our appetizers and entrees so I was not able to order a new glass to replace my practically empty one.   And I was halfway finished with my entree before he even came by.   There are so many other wonderful italian restaurants in the city (Caro Mio, Sabatinos, La Scarola, and even La Gondola in the strip mall across from Fiorentinos).  I would not waste my time or money on this place.  Very disappointing.   On a positive note, they had a nice, reasonable wine list and the bread was served warm.",0.9002,0.872,0.089,0.04,0.5163646076146076

We started with the Arancini which are rice balls filled with peas, mozzarella, and meat.  This combination of ingredients inside a fried ball was interesting-tasty but we weren't quite sure what to make of them.  For our main courses my boyfriend ordered the Lasagna and I ordered their signature pasta-Fettucine Maribella, both were outstanding.   The Fettucine Maribella is black fettucini with asaparagus, sun dried tomatoes, sweet peppers, and shrimp and scallops in a light alfredo sauce-absolutely delicious!  I've never seen black fettucini-green-yes, red-yes, but not black.  It was very interesting-couldn't really taste a differerence but it looked like I was eating strings of spinach or seaweed or something....I digress.  The dish was amazing-super fresh ingredients, pasta cooked to a perfect al dente, and again, perfectly cooked shrimp and scallops.  My boyfriend got the Lasagna which was also delicious-not your standard lasagna-in addition to the layers of perfect pasta, meat, gooey mozzarella, and a tomato sauce to die for, their version also included mushrooms and spinach-yum. As good as the food was, I really struggled with handing out 4 stars-the service was absolutely awful.  The hostess and bartender were very nice and on the ball but our waiter was absolutely awful-we couldn't figure out why he was always MIA-someone else brought our drinks, someone else brought our food-what was he doing?  We got our meals and didn't see him until we were ready for a box-somebody else had delivered our plates to the table and he never even came by to ask if everything was ok and if we needed anything else.  Had it not been for the food being so fantastic, his service would have merited 2 stars.  They were also out of Tiramisu-seriously? an Italian restaurant out of Tiramisu?  Luckily we hopped across Ashland and were able to pick up some Tiramisu from La Gondola in the shopping center and it was delish.  Overall-great food but way below par service.  Will we be back?  Maybe....if we can't get a table at La Gondola.",0.9955,0.804,0.155,0.041,0.598070987654321

When we finally ordered our food it was delivered a good 45 minutes after we were seated and easily an hour after we arrived at the restaurant.  The dishes themselves were pretty good.  The gnocchi was soft and served with a rich tomato cream sauce.  The eggplant was tender and not greasy, but the chunks were cut thicker than ideal.  The bolognese was disappointing.  The meat simply didn't have the deep, cooked-all-day flavor the dish is known for.  The red sauce served with a couple dishes was a surprising bright red color, but had a nice bright tomato flavor, which is really all you can ask for in a nicer Italian restaurant.  The food was good overall, though nothing stood out as worth a special trip. Also as soon as the food arrived I ordered a glass of wine.  It arrived 15 minutes later, when we were almost done so I sent it back.  The waiter was apologetic and comped us a dessert.  But to be honest, the lateness of the wine more underscored the whole experience than detracted from the meal.  The waitstaff seems overwhelmed in general.  Everything is slow in a noticeable way.  At that price point (it's always more than you expect) that's kind of inexcusable.  I'd rather take my time with food in front of me, rather than sit around wondering if the waiter is ever going to show up.  The outdoor seating area really is beautiful and the food is down-the-middle, solid Italian fare.  So I guess if you're in no rush, live in the area, and are jonesing for decent Italian with the requisite markup, this place is a capable option.  For me, there are too many great restaurants in the city to bother.",0.9972,0.773,0.197,0.03,0.5098595282268752

2009-11-08,4.0,Helpful tip: You cannot make a reservation for only 2 people on a Friday or Saturday night but if you call ahead 30 minutes before you plan on getting there you can add your party to the wait list. When you arrive you will either get seated right away or wait a short time.  The restaurant is divided into 2 spaces with two different atmospheres. When you first wlak in the door the lighting is low and the set up is intimate and romantic. The bar area in the back is kind of awkward because there is no seating and the bar isnt very long so you end up standing around staring at the people eating nearby.  The other half is a like a garden with pretty lights and hanging flower baskets. It's a little noisy but still gives you a great family Italian restaurant feel.  I had the lemon chicken. A tad dry but still delish! Most Italian restautants load you up with food and past accompanies every dish. My chicken came with a small serving of broccoli and that was it - a bit disappointing but I'd still go back.,0.8955,0.822,0.111,0.067,0.5085449735449735

Had to wait for a table for 2 minutes too many at the hostess station despite there being open tables. The hostess (who I think was just the manager or owner of the place) just took care of other business for a while until a waiter came and got me himself. Awkward and inexcusable. The menu was a good length with sufficient variation but I have Italian so rarely that I ended up having a hard time picking. The waiter was only useful enough to point to all the boxed and starred items (their house favorites and specials, respectively), which is of course not super useful. The waiter also managed to grate on me by offering service in the weirdest way. He was frequently unavailable, despite the hostess station being within view. The waiters all just hung out there and decided when it was convenient to drop by. When he did, the service was faux friendly. The food was OK.

Both risottos tasted great, but risotto is not only about flavor. Texture is very, very important. The texture of both risottos was just not creamy enough; not smooth enough. This would have been absolutely fine if each dish were not thirty dollars, but they were. For thirty dollars, I would like the risotto to melt in my mouth. The atmosphere was quite casual. It seemed as if they would like it to be nicer, but the people in the neighborhood prefer to wear Cubs hats  and shorts. A shame really. We had a good time.

I had chicken marsala and and my friend had a steak dish (a special I think) and both were good. We also order an appetizer that was on special but the server forgot to bring it to us and we had to remind her. We didn't get it until we had finished our entrees. I felt it should have been comped but it wasn't. It was good though. Martinis were average.  Overall the food was really good but I've had better. I'd go back but there are many other places in the city I want to try and it wasn't exceptional enough to make me crave it. A good option though for a tasty Italian meal in a nice atmosphere.,0.9842,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.5183928571428571

2008-03-16,1.0,"I came here with a party of 5 because of the rave reviews on Check, Please and I really wish we had saved our money.  I was really looking forward to a nice dinner out with friends on a Saturday night, and we all had a very mediocre time based on the sub-par service we received and the average food.  Half of our party arrived on time, the rest was about ten minutes late based on the lack of parking in the neighborhood and no valet offered. We checked in with the host and met the rest of our party in the bar area. We waiting about 15-20 minutes for our supposedly reserved table, and at this point were taken out of the 'grown up' dining room and to what I would consider the kids table area of the restaurant. While the prices weren't exorbitant by any means it was more than I would like to pay while sitting in a plastic chair in a drafty tent.  Our server was awkward from the start and assumed we would not want wine. We are all in our late 20s, early 30s, and at an Italian restaurant - why wouldn't we want wine?? He was ok at first in terms of service, but it got worse and worse as the night went on. It was clear that he assumed probably based on appearance (we were not 'dressed up') that we would not tip well. Well, my salad was delivered with dressing on it when I asked for it on the side and I couldn't return it for about 20 minutes because no one checked on us, what do you expect? That is not the biggest deal, but there was absolutely no apology or admission of error on our server's part. Then, drink orders were forgotten, our entrees took over an hour, and still no apologies.  The entrees were all good, but not great, and my penne arrabiata seemed excessively spicy. Finally, when the check came there was an extra bottle of wine charged. We got a half-hearted apology about that, which clearly seemed a last-ditch effort for the waiter to save his tip. Needless to say, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, let alone go back.",-0.8833,0.793,0.091,0.116,0.5228395061728394
2008-03-15,1.0,"I can't disagree more with all of the positive reviews posted here, let alone the praise it received on Check Please. Maybe I was there on a bad night, but my party of 5 had a terrible experience at this place. We had an 8pm reservation on a Saturday night, but because a couple people in our party were 5-10 minutes late, we had to wait at least an extra half hour to be seated. (It was clear at that point that there was no table actually reserved for us.) We were seated on the patio at the furthest back table, which we barely could fit into. Our waiter was attentive at first, but quickly his service trailed off to near non-existent: One person's appetizer wasn't served as ordered, and she wasn't able to send it back for a good 15-20 minutes because the waiter never came back to check in. Our entrees took at least an hour to arrive, and while the food was decent, it was nothing to write home about. The waiter offered refills but only brought them after being flagged down and reminded, and we generally relied on our busboy more than our server during the meal for anything else. Finally at the end of our meal, the bill contained a whopping extra $40 bottle of wine we never ordered. Our server only offered a vague apology for the additional charge (not for any other service mishaps). The only conclusion we could draw was that we were given poor service because we were dressed casually, and perhaps our waiter assumed we wouldn't tip well? Regardless, it was possibly the worst service I've had in the entire 7 years I've lived in Chicago. With all the other good Italian restaurants in this city, I would never recommend Fiorentino's to anyone.",0.5004,0.82,0.098,0.082,0.505309189455531

2008-02-25,1.0,Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this place- it got a raving review on Check Please and I was very excited when we made it one Friday night for dinner.  The calamari- ok- nothing mind blowing.  The ceasar salad was very tasty- but let me get to dinner.  I order the house specialty- the spiedini alla griglia which sounded tasty- fillet medallions marinated in olive oil and lemon then grilled.  The waitress asked how I would like it done- medium rare- just like I order all my steaks.  The result was steamed meat that was beyond well done.  As gross as it is I have to tell you I actually tried twice to chew and swallow a piece but had to spit it out before choking on it both times.  I've only sent something back once before in my life and this had to go back.  The waitress was VERY NICE and asked if I would like another but after waiting an hour and a half in the first place I was over it.  They took it off the bill but that should be expected so no big thank you there.  Overall the staff is very friendly and the prices not bad but all in all a place should be able to make it house specialty edible every time.,0.9779,0.793,0.159,0.049,0.4166666666666667

2008-01-09,4.0,"On a rainy night, after watching check, please! I suddenly had a craving for Italian food. Not just any kind of Italian, but Sicilian! Watching the review on Check, Please! only made this decision that much easier when it came time to eat. Fiorentino's it was. Not only is this restaurant around the corner from my house, but it's been a place that I see driving by all the time but never think twice to stop by. Due to it's somewhat odd location, the decor felt warm and welcoming. I was greeted by the owner/host, her smile and hospitality immediately put me in a relaxed mood. I arrived earlier than the rest of my party, so I actually got to read the entire menu! Who ever has time to do that? Normally, I'd just look at one category and pick my favorite from that. But, as I reviewed the menu, I realized  everything looked good. How to decide?... I started with the fried calamari, the batter was light and crispy, then the stuffed (Ricotta filled) gnocchi with a tomato cream and also sampled the pollo limone and manicotti! YUMM! The only disappointment was the tiramisu, which I normally love but the one I had at Fiorentino's seemed to be drowned in rum and distracted the other flavors. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here, I will definitely come back with my special someone and take more pictures of new items we try! Enjoy!",0.992,0.721,0.211,0.068,0.49065543831168823

I's stuffed gnocchi was wonderful-melt-in-your-mouth light and pillowy, coated in a brilliant, just-shy-of-tart tomato cream sauce. My ""flash-fried tilapia"" (one of the 2 seafood specials) was impressive. Gloriously presented whole fish atop mesculun greens-albeit with an oddly placed, stunted rosemary sprig poking out of its middle-its skin was crackly crisp on the outside, yet so moist, tender, and not a hint of greasy inside, it was hard to believe it hadn't been steamed to a crisp. Flavored with just salt and a squeeze of lemon, the fish was perfect. Dessert was a split portion of ""cannoli dream,"" basically a deconstructed cannoli-sort of like cannoli nachos. The chocolated-chipped cream, spread onto the plate with a drizzle of chocolate sauce, was studded with 5 large slivers of the crisp pastry tube. Despite the mysterious strawberry in the center of it all, the dish looked interesting and tasted wonderful.
