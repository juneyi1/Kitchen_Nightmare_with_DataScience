It's BYOB, but the girl who invited me here failed to inform me of this, so, no mimosas for us. Strike one. I'm a big fan of Indian food, so, obviously, I was excited about the Indian influenced brunch menu. My date... not so much, she ordered two scrambled eggs and bacon--BORING. Strike two. I had the Saag Paneer Scramble and it was delish. I liked it so much I had to spread the love and share some with my date. She said, ""No thank you. I'm a VERY picky eater."" *Gasp!* Strike three, you're OUT! NEXT!!! I'm a fan and I'm a little bummed out because I just found out that they just closed their doors for good... literally, like right now as I write this review they are cleaning, breaking it down, and packing it up.

I was really looking forward to coming here for dinner with my friends to start off another night of awesomeness or for a date with someone who isn't a picky eater. Hey, don't judge me. I refuse to hang out with picky eaters, and I most certainly will not date one. Anyway, I really liked this place. Hopefully, the owner opens another version of this restaurant in a new location. 4 stars based on brunch alone.

Seared Salmon - this dish was top notch.  The salmon was prepared just right, and the Israeli couscous (my absolute favorite variety of couscous) was perfectly prepared and paired with an outstanding almond cream sauce.  I'm going to try to recreate this dish in my own kitchen.

Given the excellent word of mouth and the polite apology I received from the owner, I was certain that experience must have been a fluke. For this visit, the restaurant was entirely empty, so we had our pick of seats and the service was outstanding. Our server was charming, attentive, and funny. Her company singlehandedly elevated the experience, but this time, it was the food that let us down.   The Calamari remains lovely. Light and crispy with a zingy spiced dipping sauce. Our entrees were another story. I had the duck breast special, with dark leafy greens (perhaps kale?) and a sort of Indian version of fried rice on the side, with a curry dipping sauce. Unfortunately, the duck was a touch too rare and over-salted, rendering it chewy and unappetizing. The huge portion of rice was mooshy and wet, like a sentient ooze creature threatening to rear up and devour my fork. Everything on the plate was overspiced.  My fellow diner's salmon was flaky, tasty, and tender, though the massive bed of couscous it sat upon was glistening with oil and almost inedible. (She wishes to stress that this is probably forgivable, as her stomach is quite sensitive to oily foods.)  Wanting to end our dining experience on a positive note, we ordered the Sour Cherry Spotted Dick for desert (it's vegan!).  It was a little on the dry side, but the hidden cherry in the middle was a delightful surprise, and the sour cherry reduction was tart and delicious.  I doubt I'll be revisiting Treat anytime in the near future, but if I do, I think I'll stick to the appetizers. That seems to be where they excel.

With the Groupon, we were able to get a lot of food - seared scallops with a curry sauce, fried calamari with a harissa dipping sauce and an amazing carrot salad, and a steak sandwich.  We wanted to order the samosas, but they were out that day.  I also had their house-made iced chai, and my husband had an Aranciata. All the food we had was really good.  If I was going to be nitpicky, I will say that the scallops we were served were on the small side, and they could have been seared on each side for a couple seconds longer.  But, I've never met a scallop I didn't want to devour immediately, so it was fine.  Also, I do not like carrots.  I'm not a picky eater, but I just don't like carrots.  However, the calamari came with a decent-sized side salad of just carrots, and it was AMAZING.  I would go back to Treat for this alone.  The calamari themselves were also pretty fantastic - I loved the super crispy breading, and the harissa dipping sauce was a hit with me and my husband.  Unfortunately, the steak sandwich isn't on the menu anymore, so I can't tell you what was on it, but it was really good as well!  The iced chai tasted a little funky - like there was some kind of powder in it, but it was okay.   Service was really polite, but slow.  I think they were slammed because of all the Groupon-related business.  We're patient people, though, so we didn't mind.  And the food more than made up for the wait!

2010-11-26,1.0,"I'm going to do you a favour, Treat.  I'm going to give you some advice. 1) If you've got a Groupon offer expiration date happening - BRING IN EXTRA STAFF. 2) If you're overwhelmed, and there's a 2-hour wait for a table - *don't* tell folks it's going to be 1 hour. 3) If you've got people waiting all over the place, make sure your staff  communicates with each other, so that people waiting out in front of the building (to avoid being in your way) do not get SKIPPED because the one waiting tables ""thought (they) left"" when the hostess knows darn well they're waiting out front. 4) If you've already screwed up on the first 2 - do NOT look at people strangely for asking where they are on the list if it's been an hour and a half.   Here's the story:  My mom bought a Groupon for this place.  She invited my husband & I to go check it out with her.  I had never used a Groupon before, and had never been to this restaurant.  We were looking forward to it. Upon arrival, the hostess told us she could put us on the list, but it'd be an hour wait.  I asked if she took reservations (maybe we can make one for later in the evening and go do something else for a while).  She looked at me as if I was an idiot and said ""Not tonight.""  Apparently I should have known that on nights that Groupons expire, this restaurant does not take reservations.  Isn't that just some kind of inborn common knowledge, even if you've never used a Groupon and never been to this restaurant? Fine - we gave her our name, and went and waited out front with several other people.  They also had a side-patio where some people were waiting at tables.  The tables were full, but they weren't serving food out there (tip #5 & 6 - use the space you've got - either serve food out there or, if you're not licensed to, then rearrange it so more folks can use that area comfortably, instead of having to stand on the sidewalk). After about an hour and 10 minutes passed, my mom went in just to get an idea of how much longer it looked like it would be.  Not impatient, yet, just wondering.  She came back out front, and told us there were four names ahead of us on the list.  We waited.  We watched party after party exit, and party after party get seated.  Several more than 4 groups passed by in each direction.  It looked like they were dealing with a lot of 2 person tables, so we come to tip #7: get some different table sizes, or offer your party-of-3 who've been standing on your sidewalk for an hour and a half the chance to either sit at the bar and order food, or to share a small table.  Hey - we might not mind being snug! After another half hour, and all those people, went by, I went in to check.  We were, at this point, worried that they didn't realize we were waiting out front, instead of on the side patio.  I told the hostess I just was wondering where we were on the list.  She said ""Someone in your party JUST checked.""  I said ""I don't think so.""  She again looked at me like I was an idiot, laughed in one of the most irritatingly condescending fashions I've ever heard and said ""Whatever, it's okay.""  I said ""Do you have the wrong party? We're waiting on the sidewalk - no one's been in here for the past half hour.""  She laughed at me again, looked at the list and said ""It's going to be at least a half hour.""  (#8 - teach your staff to deal with awkward situations without laughing at your customers.  Even *if* the customer is in the wrong, it's bad business.) As I turned to  go, she described my mother to me, trying to prove her point that someone had ""just asked""... #9 - teach your staff to tell time.  Something that happened 30 minutes ago did not ""just"" happen, unless you're tracking time over a long span.  In restaurant wait-time, 30 min. past when you were told you'd likely be seated is a LONG FREAKING TIME.   At this point I was wondering if she'd actually bumped us back because we'd ""dared"" to check where we were on the list.  #10 - teach her some customer service skills.  She was really unpleasant.   There's more - while we were debating, out front, whether we should continue to wait or call it a loss (after another 20 minutes), I saw the one who was waiting tables (not the one I keep calling the hostess) go to the side patio & call a name.  Folks out there looked at her blankly, so I nudged my mom and husband and said ""I think that might be us.""  We went inside & tried to catch her eye as she blew past us twice.  We saw her check the list, talk to the hostess, check the list again, and go back to the patio and get another party of 2.  My mom went to talk to the hostess, who was snide with her & told her we had to wait some more, and a few minutes after my mom rejoined us, the one waiting tables passed, saw us, stopped, and said ""You're HERE??  I thought you LEFT!"" Believe it or not - there's more, but I'm out of space.  Ultimately, we got jerked around some more, left and will not be back.

2010-11-09,3.0,"Well, it's been almost a year since my last visit to Treat and this time I wanted to try brunch. Thanks to the divine intervention of Groupon, I had $30 worth of food to eat. So my friend and I grabbed our stretchy jeggings and dove head first into the unusual menu.  We ordered the savory pancakes with leeks, roasted corn and hollandaise. I really wanted these to be better. They sound good, right? They were very leek-y and lacked some real flavor. The hollandaise had a spicy kick, but there just wasn't enough of it to compliment the pancakes.  We also ordered the masala french toast. Again, I was hoping that this would have more flavor, but it didn't. It was just plain old french toast with barely a hint of masala. We opted to add the strawberry compote, which was a tiny cup filled with two strawberries. Since we were splitting the order, we each got one strawberry, but still...would have liked more. Also, we ordered the half portion and the chef made the full portion. When our waitress delivered the food she said ""this is what he made, so here you go"", which would have been fine, except we were charged for the full portion instead of the half portion that we ordered. So...the chef decided what we should eat and pay for. Hrm...  My friend also wanted to order the scallops and our server said they don't make them until after noon. It was 11:45. I'm not asking for special service, but this all was seeming very odd to me.  The coffee was reeeeeeally strong! Too strong for my taste. I also had a cayenne hot cocoa, which lacked cayenne. My friend enjoyed her black cherry soda.  The previous time I had dined here I really enjoyed the food, but I was pretty disappointed in the brunch. I wanted some spice! Some flavor! Some...something! Instead I got odd service and bland food.",0.9923,0.782,0.169,0.048,0.46030778164924496

I had the Paneer Scramble which was amazing. LOTS of paneer (a kind of soft cubed cheese), spinach, and spice. Seriously, it had the perfect amount of heat, which I didn't expect but enjoyed. The dish was just perfectly seasoned and extremely flavorful. The poori was good, and the potato pancake was excellent. There was a large portion of it too. My friend had the eggs benedict with steak, which he said was one of the best eggs he had experienced in awhile. He ate everything, raving on how good it was. I tried it and also enjoyed it, and noted the steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Overall, despite issues of being overcrowded and understaffed the food was incredible.

Well, I guess there could be several arguments here...but I'm going to go with ""rainbow."" Is Treat serving rainbows!? Of course not, but I happened to stumble across one as a torrential t-storm ripped through Humboldt Park, vanished ubiquitously...and left only a large colorful arch in its wake. An appetizer, if you will. A good omen, if nothing else. Beauty in small things is valuable.  And so it reasons...Treat is a small, beautiful little gem nestled just north of North Ave on Kedzie. Unexpected. Colorful. Vibrant. And, indeed the rest (FOOD) were also the highlights of my cozy little dinner at Treat Restaurant a few weeks ago. The cuisine is a blend, but the main line is Indian...with some Italian, and a few other influences thrown in for good measure. The good news? It works.  Our poor server, not knowing of the rainbow omen...was a bit overwhelmed, and rightfully so. Managing an entire dining room (approximately 15 tables, perhaps more) on a somewhat balmy evening, and BYOB service? Well, yes. A bit harried, but she recovered with poise and the meal did not suffer. I would've preferred that the chatty man behind the coffee bar help her out a bit, but perhaps that is not the arrangement. She was server, busser and hostess...help a girl out!  The food was tasty, and somewhat safe from an ethnic food perspective. Read: you could bring your non-adventurous friends to eat at Treat and no one is going to freak out. And, veggie-friendly. And  BYOB. It makes a lot of people happy on a lot of fronts...and then, there is the black pepper ice cream. Which sounds terrible in theory, but in execution is damn near bliss. I suggest you at least get a scoop to say you've tried it.  It's not fancy, but its a winner. The food is quality, the experience is credible, the vibe/location is still a bit undiscovered...and the black pepper ice cream tickles the tongue, begging one to return. Oh, and then there's the rainbow too, obviously.  A few notes:  *Parking can be tough in the area, but not impossible. Watch for permit zones.  *BYOB, liquor store on North Avenue.  *Smallish dining room, def make reservations for large groups *Cake charge for birthdays (but the apple tart is awesome, you don't need a cake!)",0.9954,0.76,0.175,0.065,0.533307453416149

Flash forward to present day, the menu has gotten a face lift and buried the garlic fries! Long live the fusion culture and innovative new menu. The scallops in creme were a mystery to us at first, Im always a skeptic of scallops due to the immense risk of over cooking, under spicing or frozen texture. They nailed them.

We got a cork-screw and a couple of juice cups, which I suppose in defense wine is from grapes and grapes are often juiced only..however not justified for a $2/person fee. The food was good, but lacked some ""fusion"" appeal that it could have had. Tuesdays they offer all you can eat fish and chips, but much to my dismay when asking, its just your standard run of the mill F&C but served with curried veggies on the side.

Just beer battered pollock, semi disappointing.  The portions are decently generous, but more is always better then less on a scale of plate garnish to actual food items.

We enjoyed the samosas and Goan crab cakes with our BYOB selections (they offered to put the extra beer in the cooler for us, which was nice since it didn't seem the dining room was air-conditioned).  Among the entrees we tried, the vegan tomato korma rigatoni and the chicken tikka masala were clear winners - both dishes were pleasantly spicy.  The curried gnocchi were also good, but the beef short ribs did not live up to our expectations.  It tasted more like a plain-jane beef stew than anything special, as the masala seasonings supposedly used in the braising liquid did not come through. Desserts were the least impressive part of the meal.  Sure, you can get a creme brulee anywhere, but I was really looking forward to their passionfruit version.  Unfortunately, it didn't seem the custard had set, and there was insufficient sugar caramelized on top - no crust to crack with the spoon, alas.  Decent flavor, though.  As for the apple tart, the pastry wasn't great, though we thoroughly enjoyed the black pepper ice cream served on top.

There are plenty of options for a vegan, all clearly marked on the menu. We ordered: **Mixed Green Salad (v) which consists of tomatoes, cilantro, mint and pomegranate dressing. Although the salad was salty, it was fresh, light, and a perfect 'brunch' appetizer. I don't remember the dressing tasting at all like pomegranate.  **Samosas (v) are always a favorite of mine when enjoying Indian fare. The Samosas at Treat were obviously fresher than those I've enjoyed in the past.  **Pakora Pancakes (v) offer a different approach to a traditional pancake. Consisting of chick pea batter, onions, wilted spinach, cilantro and tamarind chutneys, the Pakora Pancakes are savory not sweet, and bursting with flavor.  **Masala French Toast served with honey chevre mousse and chai syrup was definitely one of my favorite dishes ((although not vegan.)) The French Toast was sweet but not too sweet, flavorful, and not too heavy. That Chai Syrup will keep me coming back over and over and over again.  Overall, Treat is by no means comparable to Lula's.

The spices were raw and seemed like they were just applied on top. The service started at very good and went to shit. Dirty plates etc. weren't being cleared. An incorrect order delivered.

2010-06-03,4.0,"I've lived in this area for years, and have passed by the building Treat occupies hundreds of times, but never once ventured inside. Now I'm kicking myself for all those times I passed by without stopping. After a lovely walk through Humboldt Park last evening, under the gently nodding canopy of trees speared by rays of clear sunshine, my boyfriend and I were hungry and looking for nearby grub. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the food at Treat is Indian fusion--and in retrospect, I think Treat should advertise this more prominently. Inside, the tiny building is furnished with a smart, warm, fresh sensibility. I especially like the local art on the walls. When I passed by before, I was intrigued by the piece with the plastic gun shooting out a bird instead of a bullet. There are some great paintings in bold, broad-stroked styles deeper inside. Despite the invitingly intimate dining room, we opted to sit outside, as the day was too gorgeous to waste, and it was too warm and stuffy inside (a result, I think, of having a semi-open kitchen in a small space). Our waitress (whose name I didn't catch) was friendly and attentive. We ordered the mushroom purse and two sandwiches, tandoori chicken and beer-battered cod. The mushroom purse alone made the visit worth it. Presentation was excellent, and the taste even better, with a striking contrast between the rich, creamy filling and the tart yet savory dressing. I was on the verge of licking the plate, but unfortunately other diners were seated outside with us. Had they not been there, I assure you, I would have gone for the finisher. Our sandwiches and sides were also impressive. I preferred my BF's beer-battered cod with beet relish: the cod was tender, and complemented well by the tangy relish. My tandoori chicken was cooked perfectly for me (moist without being gushy), but I wish the sauce was a little bolder and spicier, then perhaps balanced out with a light yogurt drizzle or other cooling element. My apple tarragon cole slaw was also a bit too subtle, but the fresh ingredients compensated. We were debating whether to get a dessert, since the freshness and quality of the other dishes was so good. But at $7-8 per dessert, we decided to pass, as this would take the meal over the threshold of good value for us. I would love to see smaller, less expensive dessert options added. Or maybe we should have just gotten a smoothie. Now here's the part about my experience at Treat that sealed the deal. After we got home, I checked out Treat's web site for a little info about the owner and history. Finding an email contact, I sent a brief note saying how much I enjoyed my meal. Today, I received a reply from the owner, Tamiz Haiderali, thanking me profusely and saying how much the compliments lift the staff's spirits, and inviting me to ask for him personally next time I stop by. I'll definitely be doing both.",0.9989,0.724,0.233,0.043,0.5564331501831502

I agree with one reviewer about it having a very Portland vibe. Being originally from OR I really liked that part. The food was super good and I liked everything I tasted. There was kind of a community serving thing going on where everyone helped take our order, deliver the food, etc.. I liked the variety. There are only a few wrinkles this place needs to iron out but I'll definitely be back.  -The service staff was really friendly, however the server seemed pretty uneducated about the stuff on the menu. I think he may have been newish though, and he was still really nice and attentive.  -Please please please get fresh squeezed OJ. This is the one staple of an amazing breakfast experience for me.  -I wish everything on the breakfast/brunch menu was served for the whole period of brunch. We were too early to get lunch stuff but the tandoori chicken sandwich sounded so good.  -and lastly, I hope you have or get a/c.

As I phoned in my order, I also thought about how much I really wanted my first experience there to be dine in, but I promised I would come back soon for that. When I went to pick up my food at about 6pm, there was a nice crowd in place. The hostess was very friendly and helpful when I asked questions about the hours and corkage fee.   I raced back home so I could sink my teeth into the samosas and chicken tikka masala and I wasn't disappointed. Absolutely delicious! The chicken was spicier than I prefer and after one bite my daughter refused to try more, but I still loved it. The samosas were the perfect  blend of texture and flavor and were quickly devoured by both of us. It's very cool that this wonderful restaurant is located in this largely Puerto Rican neighborhood and that I don't have to trek all the way up to Devon to satisfy my Indian food cravings.

The wooden counter bar was available for hanging out and they gave us an opener to uncork our wine (did I mention it is BYOB?) so we were happy to sit back - but not too far since the stools had those ultra-hip back supports that come up 3 inches - support for a lower, lower back? - and take in the smells. The aroma was wonderful as we perused the menu - selecting whatever would proceed the black pepper ice cream with apple tart dessert.  For appetizers we chose scallops, (excellent), beet salad, (very good ) and fried samosas - pass next time on those - too much crust and not enough spice in the potato filling.  The main courses were a mix of textures, flavors and successes. The chicken over rice was excellent, as was the lamb shank. The beef rib was generous and cooked well, it was just too dense a meat for the flavor to permeate, so it turned out to be a little boring after the first few bites, compared to the other entrees. The service was good considering there was only only one waitress for the whole place. The chef bringing out one of our main courses was a nice touch. We all liked the vibe in the place - large groups were hanging out well after their meal was done - with their bottles (did I mention it is BYOB?). It is off the beaten path - the cab driver in Bucktown didn't know about it - and that is part of its charm. Don't ask me for instructions, but if you make the effort to get there, be prepared for a casual Treat - it is worth the wait. Just don't lean back.",0.995,0.778,0.188,0.034,0.5398214285714286

It's an adorable restaurant, bright colors, great art, and a very welcoming team of servers. We tried the samosas, the crab cakes and the calamari. All delicious with the yummiest chutney! My hubby said it was the best calamari in the city. Super tender and plentiful, with the nicest crispy crust. Two of our diners had the lamb burger and were kind enough to share bites. Yowzer. I can not wait for spring to get here so I can ride my bike to Treat and make sweet love to that lamb burger. It's that good. I had the daal, perfectly comforting on that rainy night. Hubby had the curried gnocchi which were perfect little spicy, puffy pillows.  We had three desserts:  the apple tart with black pepper ice cream, the spotted dick and the passion fruit creme brulee. All three were winners! The spotted dick was described as kind of a ""novelty,"" but it was delicious none the less. The ice cream with the tart was perfectly creamy and a little spicy. And the creme brulee, WOW. So creamy, perfect simple flavor.  Treat is BYOB and indeed a delicious, comforting treat.",0.9973,0.666,0.314,0.02,0.6903388278388279

I don't think I've ever felt this way after eating something. Usually I like it, I don't or it's ok. But the pumpkin soup...I don't know. Maybe I'll have to try it again. I did like the mixed salad. For dinner I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. It's different from others that I've had, but it was still good. My boyfriend ordered the Curried Gnocchi. I'm not really a Gnocchi person so I didn't care for it. He said it was a bit too doughy and thought it would be better than it was based on all the rave reviews it got on Yelp.

I love dining with a big group of friends not only for the fact that you can catch up with folks you haven't seen in a while, but also because you can share a tahny portion of EVERY appetizer on the menu.  We really enjoyed the curried meatballs, the calamari (very good), the samosas with spicy mint chutney, and the roasted mushroom purse.   We also sampled a delicious duck confit frisee salad as one of the evening's specials. The BYOB is always a great option, unless of course you have friends who like the Yellow Tail slash cheapest Dominick's wine available.  This group however was in rare form - ChateauNeuf, McClaren Shiraz, Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, and other tasty bottles. As a group we ordered almost every entree on the menu (sidenote why is the word ""entree"" used to describe the main course in America?).  They were unfortunately out of the braised short rib that everyone wanted, so there were lots of lamb shanks, salmon, scallops, and chicken tikka plates on the table.  My lamb shank was very mild and flavorful.  The meat was the star here, not a thickly seasoned/spiced stewed sauce.  In fact, I seemed like it was poached in a light broth with a simple chiffonade of mint on the top.  Dessert was decent.  We tried the spiced apple tart with black pepper ice cream.  Nothing spectacular, but tasty. Our bill somehow came out to about $50 each which seems a little high for a good BYOB joint, but it was worth it.   After 2 bottles of wine each, perhaps the math was not good at the other end of the table.    I'll definitely be back and am confident I can do some damage in a party of 2 for less money.",0.994,0.82,0.154,0.026,0.5300535714285715

2010-02-17,4.0,"Thanks to some of my yelp bffs for helping me find this place. Went there for an early birthday dinner with the fam two Saturday nights ago, and they were quite accommodating.  They seated us early arrivers (actually, the ones that showed up on time) despite having the policy of seating when the entire party is there.  The interior is welcoming and the decor was kind of funky, but a good funky, like Herbie Hancock funky. Having a large group allowed me to sample almost the entire menu.  I was slightly disappointed that there weren't more indo/pakistani dishes, but it is just mainly ""influenced"" by, and the menu is predominantly contemporary american. We got the calamari, crabcakes, and samosas for apps.  The crabcakes with pea masala were my favorite.  The others were decent as well.  Torn between the chicken tikka masala and the scallops with curried yogurt, I went with the scallops because I was feeling the scallops just a little more.  Also,  my cousin ordered the tikka masala so I knew I could just mooch off of her.  The scallops were good, but the tikka masala was better.  Spicier, perfect amount of sauce, and more flavorful.  I also tried the lamb shank and that damn meat just fell off the bone, just the way it should be. For dessert I ordered their ""spotted dick"".  Though not what I imagined, it was quite tasty (and kinda warm).  Tasted like a just-baked shortbread with raisins.  Very good.  I tried the apple tart and the passion fruit creme brulee as well.  Both were aight,  but paled in comparison to the spotted dick.  Envy, perhaps? My only issue was the portion size.  I may just be an uncontrollable eater and surround myself with the like, but the portions were kinda small.  I could eat the menu in 2 trips.  Otherwise, I like the BYOB and mellow atmosphere, along with the friendly and courteous staff.

You heard me, the makings for an outing nothing short of treat-worthy; ahem, straight from Webster's: a luxury, indulgence, pleasure or delight. Yes, yes, yes and YES!  Great for a date, birthday or girls night out, Treat is where you head if you want to shine.

2010-01-27,4.0,"Affordable menu AND BYOB?  Well, well, Treat, I'm very happy to meet you! Located in Humboldt Park, Treat is situated on Kedzie & North.  For the uninitiated, it is the yellow storefront restaurant that looks closed.  Weird, right?  Maybe they're trying to keep people out so it doesn't get too crowded for me to get a table.  Dare to dream, right? The interior of Treat is cute, cozy and a little offbeat.  I would imagine it'd be a great place to go on a first date because it's unpretentious, BYOB so you can do some impressing with your amateur sommelier skills and the menu, while not huge, has great variety and truly can cater to any palette.  Don't believe me?  You can bring your veggie friends because they have vegetarian options (they can even make a vegan dish for ya), sandwiches, salads, seafood, chicken, lamb, beef... I mean, really.  Treat packs a lot of variety into a small menu. First up were the wonderfully delicious samosas (Potatoes & Peas with Indian spices wrapped in Flaky Pastry and served with cilantro mint & tamarind chutneys).  Talk about a delicious appetizer!  I really, really liked the cilantro mint chutney.  It was nice and savory, so it was perfect with the samosa. The soup of the day was a veggie lentil soup.  YES.  My absolute favorite.  For the low cost of $4.95 I was served a massive, piping hot bowl of luxourious, yummy soup.  Tons of veggies and not overly salty so I could really taste everything in the soup.  Just wonderful. My main course was the tandoori chicken sandwich (less than 8 bucks!), stuffed with red onion, greens, cilantro, mint, herb aioli and served on panini bread.  Being the picky dieter I am, I tore the sandwich apart to ditch the bread and ate the filling.  The chicken was plentiful (yay!) and perfectly spiced and the greens, onions and herbs were fantastic.  The real winners though?  The sides that come with your sandwich.  I tried both the wilted spinach and the coleslaw.  While I loved the nutty and healthy wilted spinach, I swooned over the coleslaw.  Yes, fully swooned.  It has apple in it!  And tarragon!  Seriously.  Go here just for the coleslaw.  It's fantastic. What gal can say no to dessert?  Impress your dining partners and order the black pepper ice cream.  Say it together: Black.Pepper.Ice Cream.  It sounds so very wrong, but it's SO right.  The black pepper tastes almost nutmeg-y and is a great savory/sweet way to end a delicious meal.  We also saw ""Spotted Dick"" on the dessert menu.  If you're feeling adventurous, it might be worth a shot.",0.9958,0.787,0.183,0.03,0.6547046703296702

2010-01-15,4.0,"Treat is a great reminder that first impressions and initial inclinations need to be meted with patience and insight. When I first came into Treat, I was ready to SAB (and it wasn't Tuesday). By the time I left, all was right with the world and I was a happy, shiny person. Treat is BYO. We had reservations for 8:30 and walked in with two bottles in tow. I was ready to chow down and drink some Chianti. That wasn't to be. Whether they overbooked the dining room or hadn't persuaded diners who were long finished with their meal to get the f out, I don't know. What I do know is that we didn't get seated for over 30 minutes and there was no urgency to talk to the diners who were lollygagging and costing the Treat folks goodwill (and, possibly, money). We couldn't even sit at the bar to drink our wine, because there was another party before us. Yes, dear readers, I was P!SSED! I was hungry, cold, annoyed and ready to leave. If it weren't for their being a dearth of restaurants in Humboldt Park that were open at that hour, I would have left. When we were finally sat, we weren't served water like the other patrons were and our waitress didn't seem in a hurry to get to us. I was about to go nuclear. Luckily for all involved, my friends kept me in my seat and out of CPD custody (because I was going to do *something* arrestable). By the time the waitress got to us, we all knew what we wanted and we wanted it *now*! It was upwards of 9:30! We all ordered different apps and entrees and agreed to split them. I continued to drink wine and plot my revenge. The apps came: samosas, mushrooms and crab cakes. They were all divine! The crab was succulent, tender, seasoned well with the perfect accompanying veggies. The samosas were samosas...but they tasted great. I don't like mushrooms and I really enjoyed the mushroom dish. All was not forgotten, but we were close to forgiveness. Then, the meal came. I ordered the salmon with a twisted saag paneer and a flatbread-thing and, maybe, something else. It was phenomenal. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The saag paneer were served differently than I'd ever had it. Rather than a creamed spinach of sorts, it was a spinach dish in a subtle cheese sauce. It almost reminded me of collard greens. The flatbread thingie added great texture and depth to the meal. It was a huge plate and I finished every bite. My companions did the same. One friend ordered the chicken tiki masala and the other ordered the pork chop special. Everything tasted incredible. Okay, Treat. We're friends again. Just, don't let that ""wait forever"" thing happen again. So, by this time, I am two bottles of wine into a very filling meal on a cold night. I need dessert. I'd heard about some sort of currant/peppercorn ice cream thing that I *needed* to try. To my chagrin, it was gone (no doubt, due to the hour of night). I ordered the chocolate ganache. It had a curry kick and some sort of berry glaze. Sorry for being so vague here. I am usually better about these things. It tasted fine. It wasn't a mind-blowing dessert, but it was quite satisfying. My friends ordered the spotted dick. Since I like to avoid meals that sound like STDs, I refrained from having any. The food at Treat is a treat. The owner is a nice guy who (rightfully) takes pride in his food. My only suggestion is to get a better handle on working the front of the house for table turnover and reservations. What started on a disastrous note, ended well enough but...it was a close one for a little while there. It would have been too bad had I left due to the unfortunate way the evening began. Don't take these chances. Make the front of the house work as well as the back does and Treat will be treating folks for time to come.",0.9961,0.776,0.157,0.067,0.5954775588396278
2010-01-13,2.0,"I had high hopes for Treat, with its recent features on Check, Please, and its promise of unique Indian treatments to Western foods. But, really, the restaurant seemed better suited to a small college-town trying to be worldly, than a contribution to the ethnic food scene in a world-class city. Two of us visited Treat last night. We had samosas and the soup of the day for our appetizers. The samosas were delicious, but the soup (cream of pumpkin) was thin and runny -- the consistency made it unsatisfying and sloppy to eat. I didn't even bother finishing mine. We had the dal and the gnocchi as our main courses. I found the gnocchi interesting, but not something I would go out of my way to have again. The dal was good, but I've also had better. Where Treat really stepped up its game was on the desserts. The apple tart was delicious, and its puff pastry shell was expertly prepared. Coupled with the black pepper ice cream (!), it was a great hit. However, the passion fruit creme brulee was extraordinary -- unlike many four-star restaurants that fail to prepare creme brulee properly, this was a great consistency, with a lovely ""shell"" on top to break. Very tasty. The service was fine, but certainly not uber-professional. This was service that you definitely noticed, and had to stop your conversation in order to incorporate into your meal. But, that's OK -- added to the overall impression that this was really more of a college-town restaurant misplaced in a big city. (And, I'm not being a big city snob. I've only lived here a few weeks, and came from a town of just a few hundred people.)",0.9959,0.737,0.228,0.035,0.47914053426248565

A blessing in that more people crowd the place and help the restaurant survive, and a curse in that it brings people with bad attitudes and keeps out the people who have appreciated the place for years prior. That being said, the food is phenomenal at Treat. The Calamari is the crispest and unchewyest you'll ever have. The dipping sauce for the Calamari is amazing. You can't go wrong with any of the dishes, but I've had the Tikki, the Short Rib, the Lamb Shank, and one night a Duck Breast special that was out of this world.

I had the Tandoori Chicken Sandwich with a side of the wilted spinach. I think I almost liked the spinach more than the sandwich. And I really really liked the sandwich. The spinach was salty and garlic-y. Two of my favorite things!  The sandwich was awesome. I loved the combo of mint, cilantro, and aioli.  The lamb burger was awesome (however i'd have to order it sans peppers...too spicy for my weak 'buds). The fries were awesome.  I'd totally recommend getting the chocolate curry ganache cake. I hate black pepper so I didn't like the ice cream that came with the apple tart, but the tart itself was good. The passion fruit creme brulee was very flavorful.  Honestly, it's a bit pricey for the entrees, but I think the sandwiches are a great deal and I'd go back just for that reason. Also...not a fan of $1 per byob participant.

Well - because you are slightly masochist, stupid or your name is Aurore L and in that case you are a little bit both.

What?!? One is allowed to dream, right? Like the good and disciplined girl I have become during these last three weeks I chose to go with the spicy chicken soup (soup of the day) and the mushroom purse....I just couldn't resist. But since it's appetizer-size it was ok to just indulge a little bit.... Soup was nice and hot - spicy broth, herbs and a lot of tender chicken chunks. Perfect start. But the real star was of course my mushroom fiesta, sauteed and wrapped in a super cute phyllo dough purse alongside with leeks, paneer (unaged Indian cheese similar to ricotta) and goat cheese.

2009-11-07,1.0,"Unfortunately, I am overwhelmed with dissatisfaction after eating at Treat tonight.  In fact, I am so unhappy with my meal I hardly know where to begin.   Food: Right before we ordered the server informed us that their two most popular dishes (chicken Marsala and Salmon) were out of stock.  This was disappointing because we had planned on ordering the chicken Marsala and we specifically came to the restaurant because we heard good things about the dish.  There were 5 of us at the table.  2 of us ordered the curried gnocchi, 2 ordered the lamb shank, and 1 ordered the lamb burger.  Both lamb shanks were extremely bland and came with a chick pea polenta that offered nothing to enhance the dish.  I like polenta in fact, and this was a disgrace to ground up corn.  The gnocchi was also bland and had very little redeeming qualities.  Additionally I was distracted by the small portion size and its room temperature upon being served.  My friend did say, however, that the lamb burger was good.   Aside from entrees, we ordered 2 appetizers to share among 5 people: crab cakes and scallops. The crab cakes were good and came with peas cooked in a flavorful cream sauce.  The scallops, however, were minute sized and were hardly enough for 2 people to share.  I understand that scallops are in general more expensive, but for $10 I expect to have scallops that offer more than a one bite experience.  Finally, we finished off our meal by ordering 4 different desserts.  I suppose at this point we should have known better than to order dessert, but we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and try all 4 desserts.  We ordered a curried chocolate ganache cake, apple tart w/ black pepper ice cream, creme brulee, and spotted dick with tart cherries.  The chocolate cake was dry and lacked any real chocolate flavor.  The apple tart had very little apple and too much fried, flavorless phyllo dough.  The creme brulee was actually good, offering the typical creamy custard with a crystallized, crunchy coating.  The spotted dick was reminiscent of a power bar, with oatmeal and cherries...except a power bar is $7 cheaper.  The best part of this dish was being able to order it out loud without cracking a smile.   Service: I imagine that the exposure from ""Check Please"" has increased business flow tenfold.  However, the service clearly showed a lack of preparation for such an increase in business.  In fact, the service seemed ingenuine and a at times, bad-mannered.  As I mentioned before, running out of 2 main entrees, plus the fried calamari appetizer definitely puts a damper on the service.  Especially, when not a hint of remorse is shown.   Ambiance: We enjoyed the cozy, minimalist environment.  The walls featured brightly colored modern art that livened up the space.  The lighting created an intimate setting and the spiced aroma entices you from the moment you step foot in the restaurant.  One thing that annoyed me was having only a single bathroom to accommodate the entire restaurant, especially after sipping on the 2 bottles of wine that we brought.   All in all, we left disappointed and unsatisfied.  It was by no means a cheap meal and we did not receive the type of quality food that we expected.  We walked in excited to dine at the recently featured restaurant and left sad that the food flopped.   It's unfortunate that I don't even want to go back and try the chicken...a main reason I wanted to go there in the first place.",0.8523,0.813,0.103,0.084,0.5847656250000003

The pancakes were fluffy with lightly crisped edges and spiced with bright flavors. Mint, parsley, coriander. They were also enormous. One order would have been enough for the both of us. I liked the Savory pancakes best as they had a slightly sweet taste underneath all the flavors (leeks, roasted corn, hollandaise, plenty of spice). The spiced potatoes were not your standard breakfast potatoes. They came in the form of an un-fried potato cake full of Indian spice and were absolutely delicious. Very attentive service, great covered outdoor area and no wait at peak brunch hour. I almost felt like I was dining at the home of a friend in the casual and friendly atmosphere.

I ordered the Steak Benedict which is Pan Seared Steak, Two Poached Eggs, Wilted Spinach, Baguette, Hollandaise, Spicy Potatoes. I found that the Steak itself was a bit bland and could use some simple seasoning. The potatoes made up for this - they truly are delicious! The presentation of the food is excellent. Two friends had the cod sandwich. I was lucky to sample it and I will definitely be ordering that next time.  Our waitress could use a happy pill. The waitstaff consisted of a woman and a man that looked like models. The woman seemed too cool for everything and wasn't very attentive. The restaurant wasn't very busy when we got there so there was no reason for her to not check on us to see how we were doing on beverages. I had the Ginger Limeade which was ok.  The Chef came out and delivered one of our orders. He was very sweet and apologized for the wait which actually wasn't bad.  Strange location, not bad ambiance. I don't think it looks like a dump at all despite what other reviewers are saying. Perfect for hipsters and art folks looking for brunch. Expect to spend around $18 - $25 per person with gratuity. Street parking is available and a lot of bikers lock their bikes up on the fence next to their outdoor seating (which is scary because the umbrella shade looked kind of unstable which was making the people who were sitting under it nervous).",0.9884,0.769,0.179,0.052,0.6000190476190476

2009-05-14,3.0,"Indian fusion restaurant?  And fairly affordable?  Sure!  My fiancee and I decided to give it a whirl and see what came of it. From the outside, it looks like a run down shack.  From the inside, it's fairly clean and trendy looking, with the strange exception that the tables we sat were sticky.  I know that this phenomenon happens with wooden tables due to sauces, heat/cold, etc.  But it would behoove the owners to treat the wood as the sticky finish is pretty uncomfortable.  In any case, onto the food: Started out with two orders of samosas (4 pieces total, $10) - Good samosas, but definitely over priced.  They can likely get away with it as there really isn't a local Indian shop to get the samosas for $1.50 each.. but they were far from out of this world.   Beer Battered Cod Sandwich:  Fried fish with a tasty sauce served in sandwich form?  It's hard to not to enjoy this.  The fish was still soft and flaky, and the flavors melded well together.  This will be what you want to save for your last bite here.  Would consider getting this dish again. Rice Flake Crusted Salmon:  Salmon was slightly overdone by my standards, however the dish had good flavors.  This dish was not enough to sate me as the portion was fairly small.  The rice flakes were good, the crisped skin on the bottom of the salmon was phenomenal.  Whatever root vegetable (cashew korma? salsify?)  they served with it was tasty and interesting, but I had never heard of it.  I'm not sure I would get this dish again.   Chicken Tikka Masala:  From the few bites I had, one piece of chicken was perfectly cooked while the other one was dried out.  The flavor seemed decent, but unlikely to reorder. Passion Fruit Infused Creme Brulee:  The four of us eagerly awaited to try this dessert!  We spotted it from the moment we opened the menu, picked up our spoons as it arrived, and cracked into a gorgeous burnt sugar top... to find that the creme brulee was still fairly raw and had not set appropriately.  Passion fruit flavor was there, but with a liquid eggy texture, the creme brulee instantly lost it's appeal. Verdict:  The quality of the food overall is good.  Sticky tables and a non-appropriately made dessert really took it down a notch in my book, as did the fact they stated they didn't have enough menus (asking my associates to share) when their house was not even close to full.  I'd probably go back with some friends, but not more than one more time.",0.9951,0.828,0.141,0.03,0.5299103402044578

2008-12-28,4.0,"For some reason, dining in Chicago has become somehow polarised. I know, I know, that's a strange term to use in relation to food. But think about it. These days, you either go to a (semi)budget place serving safe, solid standbys or pay through an open vein for more of a scene. Sure, there are still places inhabiting the gap in between, but they are a disappearing middle class. Gone are gems like Earth, Twilight and Leo's Lunchroom, where tasty, artful food could be had in tasty, artful settings. And not for a lot of money. Treat is one of those rare Chicago eateries that pushes the envelope on casual dining. First, you have the sandwiches. The beer-battered cod sandwich is actually a nice fish dinner with pickled onions, mixed greens and herb aioli. It only becomes a sandwich when served between slices of sea salt ciabatta. The turkey panino would be more of the same old bird, except it goes out on a limb with a complex apple tarragon coleslaw. The burger shifts one foot to the Indian subcontinent, with spicy lamb and a cool yoghurt sauce. The accompanying fries are elevated with spicy harissa aioli. The entrees change from time to time. Once, I had a beautiful pan-roasted flank steak with red wine reduction, beet crisps, bacon-potato hash and red pepper phyllo 'cigars'. Restaurant food in a cafe setting. With strains of the Pixies' Surfa Rosa playing in the background. This place has imagination. Tamiz Haiderali has imagination. The apple tarte tatin with white pepper ice cream is gone from the menu, but the equally delicious passionfruit creme brulee is holding fast. The service is friendly and unforced. I never sense any hovering, and yet things are always taken care of. Go ahead, leave a nice tip. Count your change at the end of the evening.

Wash it down with unlimited refills on Hibiscus iced tea or the mouth-watering (literally) Ginger Limeade and you're good to go. My BF and I always always always get the Turkey Panini and then another sandwich so that each of us gets to try something different without having to sacrifice actually NOT getting to eat the turkey panini.

The french toast was actually way too much spice and it felt like I was just eating something straight from a spice jar. Also the chai syrup didn't really taste that much different from the regular syrup, but again that might have been because the masala was just overpowering everything.

Basically the entree was a little bit of a let down compared to the delightful appetizers.  Still, I recommend the place. I'll go back with my wife. Just don't sit in the window. The lovely neighborhood kids like to bang on the window and flick you off while you're eating. Nothing makes me feel more like yuppie than being teased by teenagers while I eat a $60 meal.

Brunch menu, although small, is pretty eclectic.  I believe it changes regularly, but this weekend seemed to be a mix of Indian and American, with a bit of Asian thrown in.  Pakora pancakes were interesting, but a bit dry and not as flavorful or spiced as I was hoping for.  Daal and eggs were quite tasty, and the portioning was on the large side.  The side of spicy potatoes was good, but not really spicy. The masala french toast was the real winner.  Light and really flavorful, with delicious masala and chai tea syrup.  I'm not much of a tea guy, but the syrup had a really nice floral flavor that matched the french toast beautifully. As other people have mentioned, the service was a bit substandard.  I really think that our waitress was high.",0.9882,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.38956793206793205
2007-07-08,3.0,"I had high hopes for Treat.  Really, I did.   I mean, all signs were pointing to Treat becoming a newfound favorite of my girlfriend and me.  A unique, eclectic menu combined with seemingly affordable prices (it's BYOB!) and close proximity to where my gf and I live.  This is all too good to be true, right? Well, sort of. We had dinner at Treat this past Friday night.  When we walked in the door, the place was practically empty, save for one couple finishing up their meal.  This is usually not a good sign but we were hungry and we didn't feel like driving somewhere else to eat.   For starters, we decided to share the Saffron Mussels.  They tasted ok but the portions were very small, thus not very sharable.  I think we got a total of maybe seven mussels, which meant we were basically paying a buck a mussel.  Not worth the money, if you ask me. For entrees, my gf got the Chicken Tikka Masala and I got the Moroccan Lamb Shank.   The chicken was average -- definitely can find better at most traditional Indian restaurants -- and the curried vegetables that came with the chicken were undercooked.  My lamb shank was also ok -- definitely not the best I've had but far from the worst.  For dessert, we split the passion fruit creme brulee.  This was probably the best part of the meal.  Excellent flavor and perfect carmelized top and a nice way to finish the meal. All in all, it was just a very ordinary meal.  I didn't dislike my meal so much that I regret going there nor did I enjoy my meal enough to want to go back.  Kudos to Treat for trying to offer something different in Humboldt Park.  But unfortunately, with so many good restaurants in Chicago, effort only goes so far in my book.",0.9903,0.712,0.208,0.08,0.6219832826747721

2007-02-07,3.0,"Oh how wonderful to have a delicious BYOB restaurant within walking distance!  We've been meaning to go to Treat ever since we saw the sassy black and white awning go up over the door of the former Mama Kitty's.  While it's no Cafe Lula (and really, folks, how unfair to make the comparison), it is a damn fine little restaurant in a neighborhood with few sit-down restaurants (see La Encantata if you're looking for another).   Although the trajectory of deliciousness seemed to diminish over the course of the meal (appetizers:  Wonderful!  entees: Very Good!  desserts:  Good), I would absolutely go back just because of a few standout aspects of the menu. 1) Good use of fennel.  A fennel appetizer, a fennel salad with the calamari, fennel, fennel, fennel!  I have to give props to a place that knows what to do with their fennel. 2) Aioli.  We were a party of five for this meal-- two couples and a 12 year old.  The twelve year old hates mayo but now loves aioli.  What magic lies in the emulsion of mayo, garlic and herbs?  It soothes the savage hearts of tweens. 3) A pretty seasonally-aware menu.  It's February.  In Chicago.  It pains me to go to a nice restaurant and see cherry tomatoes on a menu this time of year-- I don't want them.  It's 1 degree outside and there is snow on the ground and that tomato shouldn't be.  No tomatoes at Taste-- the ingredients were cozy and comforting and very very appropriate. I do have to ask, though, why so stingy with the sauces?  Not so much the dipping sauces for apps (the best cilantro sauce with samosas I've had this side of Devon), but the entrees and the desserts.  My salmon was great and was paired with a wonderfully sweet carrot sauce, but there was barely enough to tease the tastebuds.  I don't want my dinner swimming in nage or anything, but give me enough so that every bite has a bit of everything to it.  I shouldn't have to apportion my meal as if I were trying to feed a family of five.  Similarly, the desserts were wanting a bit more adornment.  The chocolate-curry cake was great, but so very dry.  The sauces that came with it were pretty much decoration on the plate.  We were also looking forward to the apple tart with black pepper ice cream (!) but there was maybe a scant tablespoon of ice cream for a puff pastry tart the size of a greeting card.  I'm going to mix my Edy's vanilla with freshly cracked black pepper and see if I can recreate this sweet peppery wonder, but if I can do it with any success it will just make me angry-- if it's so easy to do, why not give me more? Ultimately, I think you should go to Treat, especially if you live in the neighborhood-- it's kind of a novelty at this point and novelty goes along way, you know.",0.9971,0.779,0.169,0.052,0.5688666666666665

The vibe of the place is OK, but the design leaves you feeling a bit vulnerable unless you have a bigger group of people.  I've been here 3 times and each time, I've liked it less.  The waitress was nice enough but not super attentive.    The portions shrunk on my date's sandwich (but the price didn't) and my salmon dish was minuscule!  Let's not even get started on the TINY mushroom appetizer we were served for about $7. I'd give this place one star but I'll give it credit for creative food arrangement and the BYOB factor.  Plus for some reason I can't figure out, a lot of the girls I know like this place despite its admitted shortcomings. My biggest gripe about Treat is that I really didn't expect to get a measly meal for lots of money in Humboldt Park.  I honestly think that part of the draw to less-than-beautiful urban neighborhoods is their value: bigger apartments for less money, hole-in-the-wall bars that serve cheap beer, and small but awesome cafes.  Treat fits this bill like a square peg in a round hole.  I never thought I'd be paying over $15 with tax for a small portion of a barely-above-average fish entree at the corner of North and Kedzie!  Come on, who is this place kidding!   It's too expensive and I felt duped because it wasn't clear that they were marketing themselves as oriented towards the finer dining set.  I thought it was more oriented to the quick, easy, and value-conscious dining crowd.  But instead, it tries to be chi-chi chic like its sister restaurant up the boulevard, Lula Cafe, and fails miserably in this small space set between a tire shop and a gas station off of North Avenue.  At least Lula, which is owned by the same people, is in a nicer setting and more obviously trying to cater to the new yuppies who have moved into Logan Square.  Also, you can buy decent beer there, and the music is better, even if you have to fight to get a seat. I'm sorry, but I'd rather go to Feast in a nice neighborhood and get a ton of food for $3 more.",0.9919,0.761,0.167,0.072,0.5784343434343433

This was especially disappointing to me because I was really excited to have a single Indian place nearby. The tikka masala and vegetable curry both had no  spice whatsoever. Like NONE, you would never guess this was supposed to be Indian food unless someone told you. I had the open-faced veggie sand which which I actually liked a lot but it was incredibly salty.
