2017-06-26,5.0,"I lived across the street from the Red Lion (technically two streets) for a year. Given the number of bars in the Halsted/Fullerton/Lincoln area, it is easy to walk past one so understated in its facade as the Red Lion. For too long I did not enter! I do not remember what brought me in one day, but I remember what happened next. I was blown away by the decor, by the books, by the wood, the bar, the bathroom (decorated with British literary....stuff), by the two levels, by *all the books,* by the quality of the clientele, by the absence of flashing light TV nonsense, baseball cap nonsense, undergraduate DePaul nonsense, etc. Most of all I was blown away by the owner, a gentleman named Colin, who was there working the bar personally, not only the first time I went, but every time I went thereafter. I am in the process of (in fact nearly finished with) completing a PhD, and I am here to tell you that Colin is an interesting guy who knows a lot about everything and makes for a very good conversation partner, which will you not have to do very much to enlist him as, for he has a knack for knowing when someone wants to talk. (I am remembering just now I think the second time I visited the Red Lion, taking a friend, and I was sick, and I told Colin, and he went out to his car and brought in tea bags from his own personal groceries, and then mixed up some soothing herbal tea remedy, throwing like turmeric and ginger root in there too. He was going to give this to me on the house, but I insisted on paying, and he declared ""one dollar."") There is a guy in here reading a newspaper with big white hair coming out of the sides and back at the end of the bar every evening. Sign says ""reserved."" It is a place for cool cats. A little more interesting than the average bear types. Food is great. Dinner or sandwich. If you enjoy, say, well, anything cultural/literary/intellectual/artistic that's a little too ""cut-above"" for Oreo-eating simultaneously (although, I don't know, who doesn't like Oreos?), sit at the bar, at the Red Lion.",0.9817,0.849,0.112,0.038,0.36010582010582015

Not really anyone to blame for the slow service as it was just one bartender working the entire place. For all I knew he could've been the one cooking the food as well!  Anyways, let's get to it! Their beer menu is top notch from their hand selections of unique drafts to bottled and canned availability. There's something for all beer lovers! I believe I tried a nitro IPA when I was here. I just recall it being creamy and so delicious! For food, options consist of your usual pub fare and I ended up going with the fish n' chips which were surprisingly EXCELLENT. I wouldn't consider myself an expert, but the fish was hot and tasty and the batter was nice and crispy and I'm pretty sure I inhaled all of the chips (fries). It's definitely a generous serving of fish, so be sure to come hungry. In addition, we also shared an order of their brisket poutine which if I recall was topped with corned beef brisket (wuuuut), cheese curds, gravy, and of course we opted to add a fried egg on top for an extra $2.

Colin noted our enthusiasm and gave us a tour of the premises and told the stories each photo had to tell. This is no decor- the pictures and drawings on the wall are original, and he knows the faces behind each one.  As for the drinks, there is a wide selection of beers and cocktails. He knows as much about alcohol as he does history. Colin's classical bartender style mixes perfectly with his sense of humor. When he asks you what you'd like, his attention to you is undivided- a trait that has nearly been lost in the industry. His hospitality is without equal. This is an experience I'll never forget.

The menu was limited and I had fish/chips, it IS an English pub. Food covered half of my plate. The fish was fine, nothing special as were the fries. My friend raved about her Brussel sprouts. The bartender was non comunicative and was generally uninterested in providing us with good service, he was not interested in working. We didn't drink nearly as much as we had intended, as he was not attentive to our empty glasses. We called to him a few times and he either didn't hear us or pretended not to, but there were only about 9 people at a 20 person bar. Just before we left, my friend asked for a coffee drink and the bartender made a suggestion. She said to him, ""I can't have carbs"" and he rolled his eyes, threw his hands up and made an insulting look on his face. This in any situation is rude, but my friend has recently lost ALOT of weight by disciplining herself to a no carb diet.

For main courses, I had the fish and chips, the others had a burger, a chicken sandwich and the lamb curry.  Everyone was really happy.  My fish had a wonderful batter on it and was cooked perfectly.  The tartar sauce was surprisingly good too, and I never eat that.  I tried the lamb curry which was also perfectly cooked and tasty.   The desserts sounded amazing, but we were so full we could not try them.  Our server,  Cory was great.  The hostess was really nice too.  We went on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy.  I imagine it gets busy on the weekends.  They have a nice selection of wines and beer, not too pricey for the area and quality.

The menu is well constructed and constantly evolving, and you can tell everything is made from scratch- a rare find in Chicago among a sea of Irish/British pubs with huge menus and apparently huge freezers. I also like that they seem to find a good balance of things you would expect to find (Fish n Chips, Scotch Egg, Shephards Pie) some things that you may not expect to see but are nonetheless authentic and impressive (Pork chops, Rack of lamb, Ham Pie) in addition to some real creative variations and specials (Lamb BLT, Lamb Keftah, Soft Shell Crab on salad).

The ambiance at The Red Lion is awesome and it's really not the type of place you expect to walk into off of Lincoln Avenue in Lincoln Park. There's a ton of warm wood, unique English pub themed decor, and comfortable seating - definitely the type of place you want to get comfy to enjoy a pint.  After settling in I perused the draft beer list which had nothing I'd ever heard of but appreciated. Since their draft selection is so unique they do a great job with the descriptions and our waiter was also really helpful in answering questions. We sampled a few different things throughout the evening and were pleased with all of them.  What really set the experience apart though was the outstanding food! For an appetizer we started with the Pub Cheese. The toasted pumpernickel bread triangles were the perfect palate for the cheese. As a big pub cheese fan I have to say that The Red Lion's is by far the best I've had in awhile and you can tell it's super fresh as well.  While I could've been satisfied with just the appetizer we opted to order dinner as well. My companion went with the Fish and Chips and I went with the Watson. I sampled a piece of the fish and I have to say... Red Lion has the best fish and chips I've had in a long time, maybe ever. I'm also a HUGE sucker for vinegar when eating English fare and was totally wowed by the malt vinegar aioli that came with the dish... it definitely takes English food to the next level.  The Watson was also really good, I was a bit nervous to try to the ""salted beef"" the the horseradish slaw sold me on the dish and I was happy I tried it! It was just as the waiter said, a tender, juicy, salty cut of corned beef with delicious slaw on top of it. If you're a Reuben lover like me go with The Watson, it's the English variation in my opinion. In addition to the delicious food and fabulous ambiance our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The only time we lost him was when it was time for the check but he was also attending to several other tables, including a very large birthday party.

Very refreshing to find a nice place in Lincoln Park especially by DePaul that has a sophisticated crowd, one that isn't inhabited by obnoxious youngins (besides actual kids during the day/early evening). All the books and aviation/war art and photos made you feel like you were in grandpa's home. The upstairs looked even cooler, in which I hope to get to experience next time around. I got the fish & chips as boo got the bangers & mash. Both were very good and tasted very fresh. The fish was perfectly fried with a light crispy batter. The fries were fine and nothing outstanding. The accompanied tartar sauce was very good and a little different than to what I'm used to. The sausages might even have been better than the fish. The potatoes were also quite nice and had a subtle cheesy flavor. We also had a side of brussel sprouts and while good, it wasn't amazing. Didn't really pick up on the bacon flavor, even though the bits were there. Decent beer list. Service was good. Our server was delightful and came by to check on us not too much and not too little.

The bar has a separate room which acts as more of a lounge with nice comfy leather chairs right by a fireplace, perfect for warming those cold fingers in the dead of winter!  Now as for drinks, their beer menu is very euro-centric (mostly British beers and food, as one might have guessed from the pub's name) with a few local beers here or there, but mostly not well known. However, that completely doesn't mean the beer wasn't good, because it was some of the best beer I've tasted yet! The Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier was a total revelation, with its smoky (almost tea like) flavor and is the perfect lager to relax to in front of the fireplace.

It is also nice that there don't seem to be too many idiots wandering in from some of the other establishments on Lincoln. It is a bit more relaxed. The prices are bad here though, expect every beer to be at least a dollar or two more expensive than it should be. The food is okay but also a bit overpriced, I had the fish and chips. The fish was decent, the chips were average and the sauce they had for the fish was weird, not your typical malt vinegar sauce, it was something that tasted like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be tartar or aioli.

Now I saw plates flying by all night. But after more than a half hour I wondered if he was pissed at me for ordering an American drink in an English pub! He came by with the food and apologized.

I especially like the books lining the shelves and walls - it is befitting of the pub's location near DePaul University. If I worked at DePaul, I would spend alot of time here. Speaking of which, the Red Lion is set amid a bunch of bars catering to the DePaul student. Thankfully, its elegant new design was offputting to the students (so far) and so it was very adult friendly. The owner, Colin, was posted up behind the bar and was happy to take orders or make suggestions based on our preferences. I had a couple of Irish whiskies, my wife had a cocktail, and my buddy had some bourbons. All good.

2014-09-30,1.0,"Being expat Brits, my husband and I are always excited to try places that serve British cuisine - it's nice to get a little piece of home. I had high expectations of this place - the reviews looked good and the menu was promising, however it did not deliver. The food was poor and the service even worse. Food: We shared a Scotch Egg Salad appetizers which was OK. The Scotch Egg itself was actually very good but the salad was past its best and incredibly over-dressed. I ordered a Sheppard's Pie, which at $15 I expected to be good.It was not. Dry, chewy lamb and not a hint of flavor. Plus it was a very small portion for the money, I came away very hungry My Husband had fish and chips which was passable, but not memorable and no better than the fish and chips I've had in any other bar or restaurant out here. Service: Where do I begin?? We had to wait nearly 15 mins to order our drinks, and only then because I flagged down a server. I then had to grab another server to take our food order and at this point had been sat down for half an hour. Our drinks were nowhere to be seen at this point either - someone came over about 20mins after we ordered them and said ""oh, have you not got your drinks? I'll sort that now"". 10mins later, still nothing so I had to get up and go to the bar to inquire where they were. They eventually arrived, 5 mins before our food did.  We only had our appetizer 5 minutes when they brought out our entrees, which then sat there whilst we finished our appetizer. When the time came for us to pay, it was another mission to get our check and I had to hunt down the server to take our credit card. I wanted to like this place, I really did. But it was a disappointment and will not go back. For great British style cuisine - Owen & Engine offers better food and service at comparable prices. And Paddy Long's does better fish and chips.

Menu has many interesting options besides the fish n chips, which is the main event here.  And the recipe is excellent, light and airy, with delicious house-made tartar sauce.  Several sandwiches sounded good for my next visit. Dined on a Saturday night and Colin Cordwell, the owner, was tending bar and shaking hands with countless friends. This is an adult crowd, possibly the hangout for half the DePaul faculty. And that suits me fine.

2014-09-16,4.0,"Came to Red Lion on a Saturday night and was really impressed with the rich mahogany/library/Hogwarts feel. The clientele around 7pm was generally older and this definitely seems like a neighborhood hangout/no blacked out 21 year olds.  We ordered the Scotch egg salad, fish & chips, and the crispy spiced chicken sandwich. We also were able to try to  the pub cheese & bread on the house (just ok, wouldnt order again). Everything was average tasty but the fish & chips I would come back for. The batter was super light and cooked perfectly, and the chips/fries were nice and medium thick-cut. The chicken sandwich was a 2nd contender and pretty flavorful, although the curry spiced fries I got were just ok (prefer curry sauce instead of curry spice on the fries).  We tried a couple beers off their English-heavy draft list and my favorite was the Thornbridge English IPA. It was really light and not super hoppy.  Our server was a super nice lad, but he seemed a little overwhelmed with many tables. Since he slightly messed up our order, he gave us a round of drinks and pub cheese & bread on the house, which was a really nice touch.

2014-08-12,1.0,"I have to say I was really hoping to be able to give this place more stars.  My boyfriend and I came here for a drink one night and ended up meeting the owner.  He told us how great the food was, so my bf and I scheduled a date night and were beyond excited to give it a try.  We started out with one of their recommendations from the charcuterie category.  It took us 20 minutes to get this and it's a cold dish, so that was red flag número uno.  We then ordered our entrees.  I had the Shepard's pie and my bf ordered the burger.  My Shepard's pie came out really cold on the inside.  In the meantime,  I just ate some of my boyfriends burger which was meh at best.  When we told the server my Shepard's pie was cold, my bf ordered another beer.  When the server finally came back 15 min later with my reheated Shepard's pie, he asked my bf if he wanted another beer. Well yeah,  we asked 15 min ago.  Anyways, so we finished eating and were thinking that maybe dessert would help.  It took the server 25 min to come to us.  By the way, it wasn't slammed, so no excuses.  Since it had taken him so long, we had decided to skip dessert and get our check.  The server walked out of the back typing on his cell phone with no cares in the world. When he finally did make his way to us, we received our bill.  There was no sort of apology from him or anything comped for the ice cold Shepard's pie.   I am a server, so this really bothered me.  I would NEVER give any of my guests this type of experience.  When we were leaving,  we tried to say bye to the server, but he was standing at the host stand texting.  He finally yelled, ""Bye"" as we were almost out the door.   We came here with excitement and were really looking forward to discovering a new gem.  We left with disappointment, $70 less in our pockets, and in awe regarding the terrible service and sub-par food.",0.2068,0.895,0.057,0.047,0.5138484848484848

2014-08-05,5.0,"It's been a loooong time since I visited the old Red Lion and all I remember was how dark it was, how low the ceiling was, and that it felt a little claustrophobic. This new iteration is none of the above. It's got a gorgeous high ceiling with wood beams and skylights and a balcony seating area upstairs, complete with fireplace and cozy couch and chairs.The front room has windows that open out to the sidewalk, creating a lovely airy feel. I have spent more time than I care to admit in British pubs and while it didn't remind me so much of the ol' carpeted local down the block, it's just a really lovely space. We ended up seated in the back, where we weren't quite in the thick of the action, but it was nice, nonetheless. I had the burger, which, with 2 patties, made me concerned about the amount of meatage, but it was very delicious (and I got to take half home to enjoy the next day!) The burger was well-seasoned with the addition of Red Leicester instead of boring ol' regular cheddar. I got the curry fries, as well and they were heavenly crisp on the outside and coated with delicious curry seasoning (not drowned in curry sauce.) Hubs had the fish and chips. With only 3 pieces of fish, he was a little disappointed, but the batter was awesomely crispy and the fish, nice and flaky.  There's a selection of various British bevies and we tried a cider and an IPA. I didn't love the cider, but that's just me. After dinner, we ended up taking our drinks upstairs to hang out on the balcony, which was really nice. Very cozy, AND good people watching, It's nice because you're away from the crowd, yet still part of the action.

2014-07-27,4.0,"I came here on a Friday night with my friend to have dinner around 9pm. We were quickly seated and definitely admired the decor/atmosphere. There was so much to look at and you can tell that the owners did a really great job paying attention to small details. I did see the owner around talking to different tables quite a bit, which I thought was nice, and I could tell he took great pride in his new place. A few people wanted to sit in the oversized chairs in the front room; they asked the hostess if they could sit there and she said she didn't know. The owner happened to be in the room, and was quick to say ""of course!"" and the group seemed very pleased. I loved the owner's innate, and quick decision to make his customers happy. Perhaps the message of what is considered okay/acceptable could be relayed to the hostess in that situation for the future. :) My friend and I ordered once the waiter arrived; I had the fish and chips and my friend had the voodoloo chicken. We both passed on the beer and just had water. Both meals were fantastic. I would definitely come back here for the food.  However, I might wait to come back for a bit based off of the service. I know that the restaurant is brand new, so I tried to give our waiter the benefit of the doubt. I noticed small things, such as having to ask for a new carafe of water when we were all out, etc., but I can definitely look past that. But, as someone with previous food service experience, I found it outrageous that it took 12 minutes after we asked for our bill to actually get it; instead of dropping it off when he delivered drinks to 3 neighboring tables, he made individual trips for each table's particular need - most of which were beers, not dinners. Often times, our waiter would look right at us, see us motioning for him, and then continue walking - it appeared that he was avoiding us, or (more likely) he was overwhelmed by three tables he had. Our dinner took an hour and 15 minutes to complete, not because we weren't done/ready, but because we were waiting on our waiter. I'm not sure if the restaurant was understaffed on this Friday night, but our section wasn't particularly busy.  Again, I would definitely go back, but I would probably wait a bit until the service has a chance to catch up/work out the kinks.",0.9761,0.871,0.103,0.026,0.5173960862985253
