Pino puffs as an appetizer were perfect I would highly recommend and the sauce that comes with. Only problems that I have and the reasons for the 4/5 were the service was slow I felt like my party was forgot about waiting a long time for food, and I ordered the margahrita pizza and I was highly disappointed. If you know how a margahrita pizza is supposed to be made you'd agree. Other than that I had a little bit of meat loaf and the bow tie pasta and I was blown away.

2017-08-05,3.0,"Entrees Were Hit or Miss and Wine List Needs Help We joined several friends here for dinner recently after not having been to the restaurant for many years.  I would give the restaurant two stars based on my meal, but because others enjoyed their meals more, I felt three stars were appropriate.  I had shrimp scampi and the linguine was very overcooked, there were no bread crumbs, and the sauce was very bland.  My husband had the cod and clam special and the clams all arrived closed, which is not a good sign.  After fighting to get two of the clam shells to open, he gave up on that.  The preparation of his entree was overly ""lemony"" which overwhelmed all other flavors. Our friends, who love red wine, ordered a bottle after checking the wine scores of what was on the menu and sampling a couple.  The wine in the bottle represented the best they could find and even then they did not finish it or take it home.  Service was spotty.  Bread basket was never re-filled nor were our water glasses.  Based on my experience I would not recommend.",0.9573,0.802,0.137,0.062,0.4247767857142856

So far we have had the following (I'm going to butcher these spellings, sorry!!): Chicken with mushrooms, chicken marsala, giambotta, beef braciole, tomato cream pasta, and a few or their salad options. My favorites are the chicken with mushrooms and tomato cream pasta. The pasta is a meal in itself and I would highly recommend it for vegetarians because it's such a substantive selection- you seriously don't miss the meat. Even though we usually select a meat/pasta/salad menu, whenever we have vegetarians, they never complain about not having a third option because the pasta and salads are that satisfying.

The portion size was just right, neither too big nor too small. With the included house salad and warm bread, I had just the right amount of food for a nice dinner. My server, Erica, was very friendly and very attentive without being pushy. She made me feel welcome from the moment I sat down. It was clear that she truly enjoyed her job and her customers. Nonno Pino's is in an older building in downtown Edison Park. Keeping the original brick walls and the high, tin ceiling gave the restaurant a unique atmosphere. The tablecloths and white linen napkins gave the restaurant an air of sophistication. At the same time, the environment was not at all pretentious. It was the type of place where friends would go for a nice, Italian dinner. The bar at the front of the restaurant was perfect for those who wanted to enjoy a drink and some socialization before or after dinner. Luigi, the owner, was very cordial and made sure that all of his guests had an enjoyable experience at Nonno Pino's.

2016-08-20,3.0,"With so many Italian restaurants clustered together in the area that Nonno Pino's is located, this particular restaurant was lack-luster in comparison to some of their competitors.  It's my belief that with so many other restaurants offering up pasta, pizza and the typical plates you have to find a way to make yourself stand out and unfortunately Nonno Pino's did not achieve this.  In fact, Nonno Pino's is no more unique than is a tall person (such as myself) who plays basketball (also, myself).  I'd have loved to come here and say anything but this, but I've also been scolded when I tell lies, therefore I can't say anything other than what I'm telling you. My apprehension about this restaurant was first initiated when it took 15 minutes for our waitress to take our order...and even longer to get our food, but I'll get back to that later...just as our waitress had gotten back to us later, much later.  While waiting for our waitress to pull herself away from laughing with her co-workers I was able to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant.  It is very spacious and has the availability to seat large parties, but even though the restaurant was big it felt cozy.  Although it's decorated nicely, it's not fancy and thank goodness for that because I showed up wearing sweatpants with hair that looked a hot mess.  Maybe I wasn't pretty enough for our waitress and that's why she was so incredibly slow?  In case I haven't given enough of a picture - we arrived about an hour before closing and it took 15 minutes for our waitress to take our order, 20 more minutes to get our appetizer, 20 more minutes to get our entrée, about 10 more minutes for our dessert order to be taken and 10 more minutes + 2 requests for our check to come.  Essentially, we were there longer than what was necessary because our waitress was busy twirling her hair...obviously she didn't care about getting out of work on time.   Sorry for the rant guys, but you have to know that you are not going to be in and out of the door if coming to Nonno Pino's.  However, we're here to talk about the food so let's do that.  We started with the fried rigatoni appetizer which was quite delicious, but I enjoyed the appetizer more than the actual entrée - the seafood ravioli.  The menu listed this item as ""spicy"" and it was listed in such a way that made me think the ravioli was stuffed with seafood.  Nope and nope.  It was not spicy at all and there was simply some seafood (which didn't seem that fresh) scattered on top of the cheese ravioli.  Deception!  Lies!  And more lies!  The food was decent, but I definitely would not be inclined to order it again.  We also ordered the side of sausage which was again, okay, but super greasy.  We were able to round off our dinner with a highlight: the tiramisu!  I always love, love, love my tiramisu and they do it well here.  Basically, I wish I'd have stuck with just the appetizer, dessert and the complimentary bread and olive oil (yummy!).  I'm thinking some of the other normal pasta is better than the entrée I'd gotten. The silver lining was that the food here at Nonno Pino's is appropriately priced and there's no big complaint about that - I just wish the food would have been more authentically Italian and I so wish the service was better, especially since this is a lovely little family-owned restaurant in cute old Edison Park.",0.9964,0.781,0.15,0.069,0.5005030181086519

I've never been disappointed in a meal - the menu seems fairly standard but the food is always well prepared and served relatively quickly.  What I like most about Nonna Silvia's is the atmosphere. There's always a good mix of locals, families, couples, etc., and you're not crammed on top of each other so conversation is easy and expected. The staff is always accommodating and friendly - not exactly a given today with restaurants.  Hard to believe this place has been around as long as it has been - it's surprising that a casual, airy Italian restaurant like this was missing on the NW Side before they opened.

I still miss those items and quite honestly has kept us from frequenting this place as much as we used too.  The meatballs are fantastic, Pino Puffs is the sole ""original dish"" that I could consider coming back for that I can't get at all of the competition.  The mushroom ravioli is different... Chunks of mushroom with the ground mushroom ravioli...it's OK.  I changed the sauce to have the red sauce instead of the garlic and olive oil.. It may have been better to stick with the original menu selection.  The NY Strip my partner had was out of this world awesome!  Seasoned well...

A group of 5 of us (plus carseat w/ newborn) had dinner at Nonno Pino's on Thursday night to celebrate a birthday.  I had called and made a reservation, which was easy.  The host was happy to seat us and even gave us an option of where to sit to best accommodate the baby. Our server, Erica (or Erika? or Ericka?) was fantastic.  She was fun, energetic, happy to give recommendations, answer questions and check things with the kitchen (food allergies, etc.) and genuine.  She loves working at Nonno Pino's and it shows.  We're a low-key group, so after ordering a round of drinks, we were ready to order dinner.   Firstly, A+ to Nonno Pino's for offering to sub up a caprese, caesar, beet, or rustic salad for only $1.50 with an entree rather than a standard house salad.  Big points in my book.  Huge.  By now everyone knows how I love a beet salad... Secondly, the bread w/ oil & parm - normally, I don't even include this in my review, because it is table bread.  Not this bread.  It was warm, crusty, and fresh, and the parmesan cheese was fantastic with the olive oil. I ordered the New York strip, which comes with grilled asparagus and crispy potatoes.  The temp on the steak was PERFECT, and it was slathered in a compound garlic butter, which I also used for the asparagus. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meal as well - actually, everyone was RAVING about it. We ordered two desserts to share, which Nonno Pino's comped both for the birthday we were celebrating.  What an awesome gesture.

I definitely filled up on the appetizer, which was A-OK by me - I knew I'd have leftovers. I had the prosciutto and arugula pizza and it was delicious.

Our food came, my husband like the baked rigatoni.  I had the mushroom ravioli and thought there was NOTHING restaurant worthy about it - at all.  I could have made it at home and saved myself $15.  It was border-line tasty.  The pasta was clearly not freshly made. As w were finishing up we saw a table of ladies being sat near us and noticed how our waitress's demeanor changed when talking to them.  She clearly wanted nothing to do with us.  I get it, we had a small child with us, but we were there SO early and we were out of there by 7pm.  I honestly feel that we were discriminated against because of our child.  Discriminate may be a strong word but that is how rude our waitress was. Like I said, we will not be back.  With or without our child.

From the outside, Nonno Pino seems so small, but once you step through the door, you see it runs deep, many booths and tables all the way to the back wall where their kitchen is located. The walls are bare brick and the place has that old building charm to it. We had a reserved section near the middle of the restaurant. Within minutes of beaing seated, loaves of warm, fresh-baked, hard-crusted Italian bread appeared on the table. Served with olive oil and parmesian cheese, we could keep going with just the bread. My kids gobbled up their bread and even got a second loaf brought to the table.  Then came the appetizers. Now I like calamari but this was the best calamari I ever tried. It was tender, not chewy. Much like the bread, I found myself unable to stop eating the calamari as well. Then came the bruschetta, equally delightful. At some point, I realized I wouldn't have much lunch getting filled up on these with the best yet to come. They delivered the goods with beef and chicken platters . I stuck with the chicken - legs and wings. Additionally, there were platters of pasta. I loved the bowtie pasta in a somewhat creamy tomato sauce. For the kids, they brought personal pizzas. Each one was probably 2 meals' worth, so they had some to pack up and take home for leftovers too. As if I wasn't full enough, the desserts came out. I had a piece of tiramisu, one of my favorite Italian desserts. Service was attentive and the overall dining experience excellent.

There are a number of restaurants here in Edison Park, so it is tough to find a place to park, but Nonno Pino's has valet parking, so you don't have park four blocks away, like we did! We had last been to Nonno Pino's over a year ago on a of previous trip to the area and enjoyed our meal, so looked forward to returning.  The restaurant is kind of trendy, casual. It is very open with high ceilings, old wood floors, and old brick walls. You sit at tables (no booths) with white tablecloths, covered with white paper. On one wall hangs a large blackboard that has the day's specials. The bar is in the front of the restaurant, but no walls separate it from the dining area. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. (Our water glasses never dropped below 7/8th's full!) After being seated you are brought a basket of tasty, warm bread and a small plate of olive oil and olives piled with parmesan cheese. We asked for balsamic vinegar to add to the olive oil and were quickly brought a small shaker filled with balsamic. We know the portions are large here, so we shared the Bowtie Pasta with crumbled sausage, red bell peppers, ricotta cheese and marinara sauce. To start our meal we shared their Caprese salad and minestrone soup.  The Caprese salad here is unlike any other we have had in other Italian restaurants. Usually Caprese salad consists of slices of tomato sandwiched between slices mozzarella and chopped basil. The small salad we ordered had two slices of tomato between topped with mozzarella and topped with basil, laying on top of chopped lettuce. It was good, but not exactly what we were expecting. The minestrone soup had lots of chunks of fresh vegetables and a tasty, tomatoey broth. The waiter was very indulgent with us since we gave his arm a workout grinding fresh parmesan cheese into our soup! They spilt the pasta dish for us, which was a good thing because one of us could not have eaten the whole thing! Even with the split we both stuffed ourselves cleaning our plates, because it was delicious! We embellished our pasta with fresh ground parmesan cheese and gave our waiter another arm workout...

First, from the bar area to the seating for dining, it has an inviting feel as a family Italian restaurant. It reminds me of places you'll find on Mulberry Street in New York's Little Italy. Then the food didn't disappoint either. The wedding menu included gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce, and Vesuvio-like chicken. Although those, with the salad and bread were tasty, the desserts, followed by a special serving of midnight pizza, were divine. I had a cannoli and a piece of chocolate cake. Not too decadent on either, just the right sweetness level. Then after hours of an open bar, the pizza really hit the spot. Great traditional flavors, such as margherita and sausage.  It was nice to have something to celebrate here, because the restaurant had a great atmosphere for just that.

It was rather runny and he still says to this day (after over 6 months since we ate there) that it's one of the worst lasagnas he has ever had.  He ate it, because he's one of those folks who is afraid to complain about food in a restaurant in fear that they will do something to his food if he sends it back.  lol A very enjoyable meal...as long as you don't have the lasagna.  If you've had exceptional lasagna in the past you will be disappointed.  If you've never tried lasagna in the past this will make you think that you were right in avoiding it and wouldn't try again.

The salmon was perfectly prepared and plentiful. She loved it.  The entrees were served with family style salad. They provided an Italian dressing and a creamy garlic to choose from. Both were very very good. By the time we got done with our appetizer (their version of cheese puffs), salad and the bread accompanied by a delightful olive oil and Parmesan dip, we were filling up fast.

Their pino puffs are to die for, and an absolute MUST every time I go.",0.9701,0.689,0.269,0.041,0.6616883116883118
2008-04-03,4.0,"A friend of mine and I stopped in for dinner tonight.  She had great things to say about it, having been there a few times... so I'll try a new place. I got the Bowtie Arrosto and it was incredible!  Pasta was perfect, the peppers were mild but flavorful and the sausage delicious!  There was enough to feed a whole family!  Seriously, good food. Friend got the four cheese ravioli, asked for the spicy clam sauce with it (which does not come with it, but with the seafood ravioli) and enjoyed very bite! Great drink specials, Thursday was $2 beers and $4 martinis, not a bad deal! Without a doubt, a great place for dinner for two or a small group.  The atmosphere allowed for a normal conversation without feeling like everyone would hear, and you didn't need to yell over everyone else.",0.9885,0.691,0.244,0.065,0.6130124777183601
2007-12-27,4.0,"Comfortable, quality Italian restaurant in one of my favorite neighborhoods.  Excellent service, even though we were part of a fairly unwieldy group at the height of lunch hour.  Everyone raved about their meals, and I can personally vouch for the calamari and gnocchi besciamella with shrimp.  One of those universally-workable places you can go with a date, pals, co-workers or parents.   A tip: if it's a weekend, take advantage of the valet parking if you'd prefer not to walk a couple of blocks - there are lots of draws in Edison Park and the area can get congested.",0.8779,0.861,0.12,0.019,0.6666666666666666

2007-09-06,4.0,"I've been here a million times, but it never tasted as good as last night.  After two days of attempting a starvation diet, we jumped ship and headed out for a long awaited dinner.  This is a neighborhood place with a comfortable feel - big bar, white tablecloths, open windows, open floorplan.  We were immediately seated by the host who continued to serve us - as it was a little busy.  We scarfed down two bread baskets (hot and tasty), probably 18 glasses of water (constantly refilled), fried polenta, house salad, veal tortellini, and the veggie linguine with mascarpone sauce and goat cheese.  Ah the deliciousness.  The damage was $30 and the actual meal was priceless.  Good for groups, families, kids, and dates - good wine list for those who drink it.",0.3252,0.831,0.086,0.084,0.4434640522875816
2007-07-06,4.0,"A great restaurant in the heart of Edison Park. I believe it's cousin is Nonna Silvia's which is by far one of my favorite restaurants.  Last time we went my boyfriend played the game that he always plays ""who has the better meal"". Of course he declared himself the winner because he always does. However, I believe that I was the winner as he and his friend were stealing from my plate all night. Fresh bread and olve oil delivered to the table, always a great start to a meal. Two of us shared and delicious bottle of red wine and the other was excited over the Fat Tire. We shared a house Italian salad that was very large and filling for the three of us. My boyfriend had some sort of ossobucco with potatoes and some veggies in a dark sauce. I stink at remembering the exact desriptions. It was meat and potatoes with sauce and it was really, really tasty. My othe friend did the whole ""make you own pasta dish"" thing. He just did penne and garlic and olive oil. That was no mistake that there was garlic in this dish, he reeked of it after. However, we all love garlic and it was really good. Just lacking for me, I like veggies in my food. I think I won the best meal contest because of my gnocchi. It came with asparagus, green beans, tomatoes, broccoli in a light cream sauce with asiago cheese. To die for!! The veggies and the gnocchi balanced themselves out. I hate it when one over powers the other. So good!! The gnocchi was fat and cooked perfectly. I don't like it when it is dry on the inside or too cooked on the outside. This place cooked it well. For sure give it a try if you are ever in the Edison/Norwood Park/Park Ridge area. BTW~went there again for a friend's birthday. Gnocchi Besciamella with Shrimp-ridiculously tasty!",0.9952,0.734,0.209,0.057,0.5423451100870456
2007-07-02,1.0,"What a disappointment Nonno Pino is! I drove back to my old neighborhood and suggested to my friends we celebrate a special occasion there. All was well, until the end of the meal. We asked the waitress if it was possible to put part of the bill on a credit card. She explained a policy, which we didn't understand, so we asked if $40 would go on the credit card in order to clarify. She snapped ""Fine!"", and stormed off in a huff. When she returned, we explained we were just asking for clarification, not criticizing her, and she got upset again, repeating ""That's fine, that's fine, whatever"". I informed the manager, who offered us a complimentary drink, but our experience was too soured to stay. Needless to say, I won't be returning to Nonno Pino's again - and I'm embarrassed for suggesting it to my friends!",0.8893,0.804,0.149,0.047,0.4792207792207792
2007-05-25,4.0,"I went here for a big birthday dinner.  The birthday girl had set up a special menu and a drink package.  The nonno pino puffs were incredible, it  was some sort of a fried zucchini and a great sauce.  I had a taste of the pistachio crusted chicken which was wonderful. I had ordered the salmon which was good salmon but the chicken was better.  I also had a bite of the almond tiramisu which was fabulous.  This is totally a neighborhood joint for that area and almost everyone in the restaurant knew each other and the owners. It had a great feeling inside.  Super cute.",0.9871,0.71,0.29,0.0,0.7242063492063493
2007-03-29,4.0,"The interior of Nonno's is large and spacious, with high ceilings, exposed brick walls and large windows along the street side that open in the summer.  They have a lovely menu.  I recommend the Stuffed Eggplant rolls,  Caprese salad (but only in the summer, I found it to be rather sub-par in the winter), 4-cheese pizza (pizzas are single servings) and the Bowtie Arrosto which is crumbled sausage, peppers, ricotta cheese & marinara over bowtie pasta.  mmmm.  The prices are fair, not cheap but not expensive either.  Portions are large, i usually have enough to take home for the next day.  They have a house red wine which is delicious and used to come in this huge glass for all of $4.  However, on my last two visits, the price stayed the same but the amount is significantly less in the glass.  The restaurant offers valet but I have never had a problem with parking on the street or in the small public lot across the street.",0.9435,0.892,0.101,0.007,0.43326086956521737
