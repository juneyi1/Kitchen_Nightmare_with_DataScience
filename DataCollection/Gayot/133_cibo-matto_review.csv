2011-09-10,4.0,"As tonight is their last night, a friend of mine and I decided to dine here on Thursday evening.  We both had the eight course tasting menu, which was absolutely delicious.  Service was wonderful. A little slow, as there was a large private party, but we didn't mind. (A little rest between each of those courses was nice to have!) My favourite of the courses was by far the first. A tomato terrine with crab, and cucumber noodles. So so delicious! The lobster course was also very tasty. I loved the sesame cracker!  Also, the strip was perfectly cooked. Tender and well prepared.  I think the pasta course with Parmesan, prosciutto, and a sous-vide egg was honestly magical. Melted in my mouth! If they weren't closing tonight, I would most certainly have been a regular!",0.9919,0.728,0.272,0.0,0.6237854251012145
2011-08-08,3.0,"I really wanted to fall in love with Cibo Matto...but could not. My partner and I did a 5 course tasting menu with accompanying wines.  amuse-bouche Hamachi crudo, puffed rice, lemoncello starter Pan roasted scallops Pancetta, pearl onion, blood orange curd, pepper dust salads Beets, Burrata, parma prosciutto, chestnut vinaigrette pasta Papperdelle bolognese Cipolini, brulee mozzarella, short rib entree 10oz Filet Mignon Dessert caramel and chocolate mousse with sambucca infused whip cream ~*~*~*~*~*~ I was most excited about the pasta and the salad as I had heard they were excellent. The amuse bouche was nothing special. tiny portion as expected. it was very buttery and the accompanying wine was a champagne.  I wish I had asked for the names of the wine pairings because the champagne was delicious! Starter - the scallops were a little chewy, probably due to them being overcooked. but the caramelized pearl onions were delicious. Salad - the beet salad did not disappoint!!  the burrata (cheese) was creamy and left me wanting more and more! the beets were earthy and complimented the cheese well. Pasta - I was disappointed with this course. the pasta was greasy.  it came deconstructed - the pasta, then the mozzarela, then the short rib/red pasta sauce mixture.  and the cipolini onions sprinkled throughout the pasta.   honestly, the short rib mixture tasted like pulled pork with ragu sauce. like the ragu brand sauce you get in the grocery store. not at all what i was expecting.  Entree - filet mignon.  I was hoping the entree would be better than the pasta because at this point in the dinner, the best meals had been the salad and the butter that came with the bread. unfortunately, the filet was sub-par.  i ordered it medium and it was gray/charred on the outside and had started to cook through the middle by the time i started eating it. so it was more like medium-well on its way to being well-done. it came with au jus sauce and what tasted like a black cherry reduction. it's pretty sad that the steak tasted better with the au jus than alone.  for me, a well cooked, well seasoned filet mignon should be able to stand on it own without au jus. i've had better steak at Outback.... the dessert was also very tasty and light.   so to summarize, best parts of the meal - beet salad, the dessert, and the butter and bread.   skip cibo matto.

I opted for two appetizers instead of an entree and found one (grilled octapus) to be pretty good - not great - and the other ( a trio of sashimi type cuts of seasfood) to be disappointing. Service was sketchy. In an upscale restaurant one should never have to seek out a server, but we did more than once. Also, the pre-dinner drink menu - well there wasn't a menu - left us interrogating the server about scotches and he was unable to provide any useful information.

2011-07-07,5.0,"I am reluctant to give cibo matto a five-star review, just because I want to keep this place to myself before it blows up and is impossible to get a table at! Chef Evan has put together a menu full of complex flavors and textures, with fantastic visually appealing food. Linh and the rest of the staff maintain a venue which is accommodating, with service that is tailored to exceed every expectation. Even our server, Amy, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and guided us expertly through an amazing experience. We started off the evening at the Perfect Pairs event, which is held every other Wednesday. We had about 6 different tastings (with plentiful refills) of this week's featured wines from France. Alongside these are the food tastings by Chef Evan and their pastry chef. Besides the cheese plate at the beginning of the event, the lobster bite and the bite of pork belly blew me away. The chocolate cigar at the end with raspberry was so good that my boyfriend, who usually hates raspberry, ate the whole thing before I even got a chance to taste mine! In fact, these bites of food were so appetizing that we asked Linh to get us a table to stay for dinner.  I'm so glad we did! We started with the mussels, which were a moderate portion. Actually, perfect because there were no closed mussels (a pet peeve of mine), and the sauce was light yet made with pancetta. This is a shining example of how pig and seafood marry so well. Next, the perfectly pan-roasted (and big!) scallops, crisp outside with cooked-just-right middle, were paired with pancetta and pearl onion, along with a citrus sauce.  Instead of entrees, we opted for a couple sides. First is the truffled lobster. The dish is covered in breadcrumbs and baked, so your first experience is the heat, and the crunch your spoon makes with the topping. Once you spoon it in to your plate, the truffle aroma hits your nose and the red of the lobster, paired with the green pasta and the white cheese is delight for your eyes. Need I mention how delicious it tastes? But really what sets cibo matto from your run of the mill restaurant is the care and attention that the people bring. We were blown away by the pork belly tasting from the Perfect Pairs event, but there wasn't a pork belly entree. Instead, there was a side dish that had pork belly as one of the ingredients. We asked Amy, our server, if it was possible for Chef Evan to put together a pork belly dish or just bring out the pork belly components of the side dish -- and it was done! Chef Evan created a dish for us from the pork belly, with morels and pickled carrots, alongside some fresh beans. That was absolutely delightful and beyond anything we could have expected. Finally, we concluded with the semolina cake topped with fresh berries and paired with their own hazelnut and creme fraiche gelato, a dessert that is sweet but also has enough savory to counter balance it.  I highly recommend cibo matto to anyone who wants to have a delightful meal. Chef Evan's menu is a must-try, and the service is impeccable. The ambiance? You must experience it for yourself. From the unique ceiling mural to the wall texture and lighting elements, this restaurant is an experience that everyone needs to try at least once!",0.994,0.894,0.097,0.008,0.5760069444444443

Service was great - no problems there.  My problem was for the price you are getting here - nothing really blows your mind away - it's mostly average (except that lamb - yuck) - but not worth the price.  I guess you are paying for the atmosphere.

The food is a solid 3 with a few highlights of creativity.  I am personally not a huge pasta fan, but the seafood influence convinced me to give it a go.  The pastas weren't the best I've had, and I still don't understand the hype I read over the squid ink pasta. The rabbit ravioli and carbonara were simple and really shined over the squid ink. The arancini was also as good as any I've had in Italy.  If I had to do it again I would stick to the simpler and traditional dishes. The cocktails were at the same level as the rest of the bars in The Wit (see Phoenix Lounge and Roof), meaning the look and service was a hit but they are still a step behind the upper echelon in the Chicago seen (normally this wouldn't annoy me, but at $13 a drink I expect them to outshine any place charge less.)

2011-03-28,5.0,"Lovely experience and wonderful food! I loved how easy it was to get a Friday night reservation during Chef week.  When we arrived our table was ready, I hate waiting when I have a reservation.  Our table for 2 was comically large, but it was nice not feel crowded. I ordered from the Chef's menu.  I started with a spinach salad with carmelized onions a great dressing, and a big ball of breaded fried cheese.  My boyfriend got to octopus, which was a large portion.  They have an extensive wine and cocktail list.  The list is so big they decided to present it 3 ways, which is somewhat confusing at first, but helpful in narrowing down your selection by price. The food is definitely modern Italian.  The basic ingredients are there, but with a sophistocated twist.  My main course was a short rib bolognese.  It was so so good.  I don't know if it is on the normal menu - but it should be.  The short rib was tender, and the pasta was fresh.  The sauce/pasta ratio was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the steak three ways from the regular menu and he said it was very good/he ate every bit. My dessert was chocolate/caramel/hazelnut amazingness.  It was a large portion - too much for me to finish even though I loved it.  It was a chocolate pudding with hazelnuts, topped with a mildy sour whipped cream, and what I think were rice krispies coated in caramel. It is worth noting that they offer half portions of pasta on their regular menu, which is something more Italian restaurants should do.  It lets you try more things. Sometimes Chicago restaurants can be pretentious.  Cibo Matto is a great example of a restaurant that offers a lovely atmosphere and delicous food without the attitude.  I will definitely be going back.",0.9962,0.794,0.193,0.013,0.4222988739655407

Arancini, pork belly, porcini puree, white truffle honey.  Nicely fried rice ball.  There was no filing, but gooey stringy cheese made up for that.  2 little slices of nicely crisped pork belly.  The porcini puree was so so.  The honey maybe was there to contrast the saltiness?  I get that it's gussying up a snack food.  But not sure I get how it all comes together. Beets, burrata, prosciutto.  Interesting play between wedges of roasted beets, and thin and crackly beet chips.  Nice creamy burrata.  A good salad overall. Squid ink linguine, squid, red peppers, artichoke, cherry tomato.  The pasta was bland, and also on the dry side.  Our waitress was quick to offer olive oil.  The dish just fell flat. Carbonara with chitarra, pancetta, egg yolk, romano.  The carbonara was retained on the menu, but now with a few twists:  house-made chitarra, house-cured pancetta, and a different kind of romano.  A successful dish.  The fresh pasta was excellent.  The dish arrived in a cloud of shredded romano, and 2 egg yolks.  A touch more pepper would have made it better. But a very rich dish indeed. Service was good.  Our waitress was attentive.  After finding out that we're return customers, she really delved into explaining what's new on the menu since the chef change.  We were at a 2-top by the window.  The bucket chairs had armrests as high as the table.  It made it very awkward to position your arms. Why 2 stars?  I would have rated 2.5 stars, but I'm holding back.  Cibo Matto has to contend with being a 'hotel restaurant'.  Yet what they are doing to set them apart didn't work for me.  Italian food is simple and straightforward.  But it seems Cibo Matto is dressing it up to make it look posh, and justify the price point.  It's a swanky restaurant at a swanky hotel.  So get dressed up, have a good time, drop a bundle of dough.  Food is just ok, but that's not what you came here for.",0.9937,0.843,0.133,0.024,0.5743477633477634
2011-03-18,2.0,"I'd really give 2.5 stars if I could. We had problems from the start because of the way the entrance is marked.  We did not know that the restaurant was in the Wit hotel.  When we arrived, there was an entrance for Cibo Matto  and an entrance for the Wit.  We went to the Cibo Matto entrance, but this actually lead us into a bar and grill called State and Lake.  The hostess there lead us through the bar and told us we could either go up the stairs or take the elevator to Cibo Matto.  We took the elevator and arrived at the hostess station to find it empty.  Someone else that works at the restaurant noticed us standing there and ran to get the hostess.  The hostess arrived, greeted us warmly and escorted us to our table.  We were early for our reservation, but that was not an issue as we were seated anyway.  The poor signage and missing hostess did not give a good first impression. The restaurant space was modern and impeccably kept.  It was extremely clean and orderly, with all chairs at empty tables pushed in and straight.  The dark hardwood floors were spotless.  The use of glass, steel and wood throughout gave a very sleek appearance.  We were seated at a small table for two along the window.  This seemed odd as all other patrons were seated in the booths in the center of the restaurant, including several other parties of two.  There was still room for us in a booth as the restaurant was more than half empty.  Although our table offered a nice street view, we could not figure out why we were the only ones sitting in the smaller tables near the window.   We should have asked to be moved as it turns out all of these tables were under a long series of vents which were blowing cold air on us.  We were quite cold for the entire meal.  In fact, even when we were not under the vents, the restaurant seemed cold to both if us.  The restrooms were extremely clean with really interesting glass sinks. Service was excellent in most ways, with one very noticeable problem.   Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered several questions for us regarding the trio crudo appetizer and the pumpkin swordfish.  He also commented on our choices if we asked him and made several recommendations regarding portions.  He even asked us about any food allergies or intolerance we might have including shellfish or gluten issues.  All of his advise was spot on.  However, at the beginning of the meal he asked us if we were going to a performance at the theaters nearby and we told him no, just having dinner.  This was apparently the wrong answer.  The speed at which our meal was served was SLOW.  We had to wait too long for every course.  We even waited too long for our waiter to get our orders.  We had one appetizer, two entrees and a dessert which we split.   We did not have drinks first and our meal took just short of two hours.  It is hard to know why.  The restaurant was not at all busy.  Was this slowness due to the kitchen or our waiter?  Was he trying to give us time to relax?  We were very restless towards the end of the meal, just wanting to leave!  For this alone, I would not return.  If this was the speed when they were not busy, what would it be like when they were crowded? The support staff was excellent.  They removed empty plates promptly, kept water glasses filled and were just generally attentive.  When one of us dropped our fork into the plate, it was immediately replaced at the bus person's suggestion before we could even ask. We chose to split the arancini, a risotto cake with pork belly on the side.  This was flat out delicious.  The cake was nice sized, enough to split and allow each diner to have a few bites.  The pork belly was perfectly cooked and left us wanting more.  The truffle oil used with the porcini puree was an excellent touch and really complemented the dish.  We were also brought a complimentary ""amusement"" from the chef.  It included some asparagus and was a nice gesture, nothing all that special though. The entrees were the agnalotti and spaghetti pasta entrees.  The spaghetti dish was the superior of the two entrees because of the wild boar and foie gras meatball.  The meatballs were just a really different flavor that made an ordinary dish something special.  The agnalotti was just ok.  In this diner's opinion, the shell was slightly undercooked and a little too chewy.  Also, there just wasn't enough flavor to the dish.  The shells were stuffed with ricotta I think, but the whole dish seemed underspiced and plain.  It wasn't bad, just not worth ordering again. Dessert, on the other hand, was great.  We chose to split the amber, which was layers of wafers, caramel and possibly mascarpone   It was presented as a small rectangle and tasted like a version of caramel cheesecake with some caramel sauce on the side.  It was really good, not too light or too heavy and everything used came together well.",0.9965,0.834,0.111,0.055,0.4979390681003583

Was the food a 100% hit?  No.  Definitely not.  But it wasn't bad by any means.  It might fall into the category of one of those places where the menu is better written than it is executed.  The lobster salad was fine but nothing incredible.  Salad.  With poached lobster and very soft roasted red bell pepper which texturally didn't do it for me.  The black truffle vin was tasty but I almost wish it would have been tossed with the salad so that I got the essence of the truffle throughout.  But it wasn't and I didn't.  You know... it was a fine salad. Handmade spaghetti with wild boar and foie gras meatball sounds wonderful and intriguing, wouldn't you say?  Well, had no one told me that it was wild boar and foie, I wouldn't have known.  That's not to say that the meatball wasn't delicious, because it was.  Texturally, it was beautiful.  Nice and loose.  I mean, the real meatball killer for me is when there hasn't been enough liquid added to the meat mixture and they come out all tight.  I hate that.  This was not the case here.  It was almost too loose as sometimes it would break on the fork during the pasta and meat integration.  Flavor-wise, it was wonderful.  I expected it to be deeper or gamey-er or something due to the boar, but for all I knew, it could have been my mother's veal/pork mixture.  The foie must've melted in during the cooking because there was no sign of it apart from the richness that it lent.  The sauce, too, was delicious.  They kept it a bit fresh, indicating a shorter cooking time than what your grandmother may find appropriate.  I really enjoyed it this way.  And the pasta itself was quite good, too.  I, personally, probably would have called it tagliolini or something of the sort since this was clearly a sheeted dough and not an extruded one.  It had quite a toothsomeness to indicate this, not to mention it's shape.  Lucky for me, I much prefer sheeted over extruded.   It's modern presentation was in line with the restaurant's atmosphere.  The nicely twirled pasta was on one side of the plate with it's gigantic meatball counterpart on the other.  Jutting up between them were 2 very bias-cut crostini giving spaghetti and meatball something of an edginess. Lastly was the guinea hen with handmade pappardelle.  The bird was perfectly cooked in pieces so there were some pulled, braised parts along with the roasted-but-still-juicy breast.  The pappardelle was pretty thick which I imagine had to do with the fact that there were fresh herbs sheeted into it.  Still, I would have taken the rollers down another click on the machine.  And it was undercooked.  And I'm not talking from the American-who-thinks-al dente-is-undercooked viewpoint.  This was actually undercooked to the point that you could still taste a little rawness of the dough.  And there was definitely an abundance of butter on the pasta (as with the spaghetti) which I tend to consider cheating.  Again on this dish was a beautiful smear of black truffle sauce that, flavor-wise, I wish had been incorporated somehow.  For presentation sake, it worked.  Service was good but not over-the-top incredible.  It kinda seemed like maybe it was supposed to be incredible, though, so I think it fell a bit short.  For example,  our first course came before we'd had a chance to enjoy the amuse bouche.   For a place that serves an amuse bouche, one would naturally expect a bit more, no?  Then, when I asked for assistance with the wine list, our server, who had clearly been educated on the subject but was by no means expert, offered suggestions.  I would have expected real insight from a sommelier rather than what we got which was nothing more than general characteristics of particular varietals and an 'I like this bottle' suggestion.  It was restaurant week, however, and the place was packed so maybe that night wasn't the best example on which to judge. As for the ambiance, very cool and swanky.  Funky seating, a cool ceiling mural, an open kitchen.... I was into it.  The atmosphere, in my view, was the restaurant's best quality. And the short version (out of 10)... Food:  7 Service:  7 Ambiance:  10 Overall impression:  8 Would I go back? Not tomorrow, but yes, maybe at some point when I wanted to dress up and eat in a classy, swanky scene in the loop.",0.9982,0.769,0.165,0.066,0.5355685819348608

The restaurant week menu was definitley unexciting,so I went with the regular menu instead. I got a beet salad which was good but some of the beets were really tough and not good.  I had a pasta dish that said it was with lemon, spinach and ricotta cheese on the menu.  Sounds pretty hard to mess that up right?  ummm... yes they did. Maybe I am just being picky but if you are delivering a spinach puree instead of actual spinach I think you should be specific on the menu.. I like purees but this was the color of dark puke green and just tasted odd, the flavors on the whole dish overall were underwhelming, and when there is hardly any food on the plate to begin with this is not a good thing.  the homemade pasta was delicious but didn't make up for the gross pure, lemon slices that were way too tart .  the smores dessert was awesome so maybe I just made bad food seletions.  My one freind loved his food, my friend who did the restaurant week menu thought her chicken was bland and just okay. Service: If I was rating service alone it would be one star.  It all started with our drink and appetizer we ordered in the lounge.  We got there more than 30 minutes before our reservation so you would think that would be enough time to get a drink and an appetizer when there were less than 10 people there... it wasn't and we had an awkward interaction getting our appetizer delivered in to the restaurant instead.  Then the busboy took our bread plates after eating the app, didn't replace them and then brought out the bread... when that arrived he put it down so fast one roll flew off the pile and across teh table almost on my friends lap but he was gone so quickly he didn't even see it happen.  And then we had no plate or silverware to eat our bread so that was awkward.  The meal was so slow at one point the manager came over and started clearing my silverware and asked if I was ready for the dessert menu.  My reply ""ah, we are actually still waiting for our entrees""  He barely apologized and quickly replaced the silverware and ran off and was not seen again.  Again, awkward! Our waitress seemed like she was really trying to be nice, but she was always in such a hurry.  At one point when she dropped off our drinks she was already walking away when she said cheers.   I don't need incredible service to enjoy a meal but when you are paying that much money for okay food and not good service it makes you never want to go back...

It's a nice looking spot, and the menu looks the part as well.  The appetizers were actually pretty good, so our meal started us off with high hopes.  But our pasta course was bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  Bland and undercooked ravioli.  Our entrée courses would have been fine (not special, not great, but fine) if they weren't lukewarm when we received them.  I took a bite of one scallop, realized it had been sitting under the warmer for too long, and then notified my waiter.  He was a little embarrassed and took the plate back to be fixed, but then returned a couple minutes later with the SAME PLATE!  Warmed up!  There were 2 1/2 well cooked but lukewarm scallops on my plate when I sent it back, and 2 1/2 overcooked but hot scallops on my plate when it came back!  I'm not  a snob, and if this was the Cheesecake Factory, fine.  But I'm paying for and expecting a better experience than that at a place like Cibo Matto wants to be.  The manager came to our table and comped our dish (not at all what I was looking for) when I really just wanted a nice, fresh plate of properly cooked scallops at the proper temperature.  Sending me back the same seafood I returned was a low-brow move that's going to keep me from trying Cibo Matto again.",0.956,0.733,0.166,0.101,0.441900471900472

After having a wonderful meal at Cibo Matto shortly after it opened, I was psyched to see that they were participating in Restaurant Week.   Our entire experience was horrendous.  First of all, if you are participating in RW, I would like to SEE A RW MENU WHEN WE ARE SEATED.  At the very least, I'd like for the server not to roll her eyes when we request a RW menu.  That's the whole point of why we are there! Not that it mattered.  The RW menu was so boring and uninspired (not available online for previewing) that we ended up ordering off the regular menu anyway.   We ordered the spicy mussels to share, and my husband had the full size carbonara and I ordered the caprese and a half order of the squid ink pasta with artichokes.  We also ordered a bottle of Montepulciano. When our wine finally arrived about 20 minutes after we ordered it, it was ice cold.  Who wants to drink cold red wine on a February night?  Not this girl.  The waitress shrugged and told us it was ""supposed to be cold.""  Right.  OK.  The busboy also managed to spill water on us every single time he refilled our glasses. The mussels were not spicy at all.  The were, however, extremely salty, and they came with one measly piece of grilled bread for dipping. (There was only about a tablespoon worth of broth to dip anyway).  My husband's carbonara - the very same carbonara that previously invoked rave reviews and a bit of drooling - was undercooked, dry, and the pancetta tasted old.  My pasta was similarly undercooked and dry, and it didn't have much flavor.  The tomatoes in my caprese were pale and mealy (partially my fault for ordering a tomato salad in February). All in all, it was a really bad experience.  I was disappointed because I had previously had a really excellent meal there.  I really built it up for my husband, and it didn't deliver.  Definitely will not be back.",-0.6048,0.88,0.056,0.064,0.5185973748473749

2011-02-02,4.0,"I am a bit torn on Cibo Matto.  Did I enjoy the dishes I ate? Yes.  Was the decor nice and service attentive/4 star? Absolutely. Did I leave slightly disappointed?  Yeah, I kind did, but cannot put my finger on why. Maybe recounting the meal will help explain it. We had a 6:30 reservation on a Friday night, we were seated right away by a very friendly hostess to our table by the window.  A perfect setting for an enjoyable meal.  After settling in, our waitress took our drink orders - I had a bourbon on the rocks and my wife a signature cocktail made with vodka and grapefruit that was very good.  The amuse they brought was a salmon cake with a fennel gelee on top, didn't really get this dish to be honest.  To me an amuse is supposed to excite the palate and this was rather mild in flavor, decent but would have had no interest in a second bite if there had been one. On to the food, the bread they served was not warm, which always kind of irks me, but it was good.  The butter it is served with is very good.  For an appetizer, we had the beef carpaccio that is served with arugula and parmasean.  I thought this was a tasty dish, the meat was sliced perfectly and had a very slight sear on it.  Temperatures were good and the meat paired very nicely with the parmasean cheese. We followed that with the carbonara, which was presented very beautifully with a ton of shaved cheese and an egg yolk on top.  The server instructed us to mix everything up, which we did, and it created the sauce for the pasta.  The pancetta in the dish as excellent, but this was a HEAVY dish.  I am glad we shared the smaller portion as an appetizer, because that would have been very tough to eat as an entree.  The flavor was good, but my only complaint was that it got really cold, really qucikly.  So the 3rd and 4th bites we took were of a cold, egg sauce, that kind of lost it luster.   Next was on to the entrees, my wife got the trio of rib eye and I had the Guinea Hen.  I ate every bite of mine, it was very delicious and tasted like a very flavorful chicken, almost a mix of turkey and chicken.  The skin was crisped up nicely and the pasta it was served with was a perfect al dente.  The sauce that was paired with the dish was very flavorful, but again very heavy.  The rib eye trio was interesting, there were components of the dish we really enjoyed and components that left me flat.  The roasted/grilled rib-eye was perfect, but the ground rib eye seemed very pedestrian, almost like something you would get at a greek restaurant.  The braised rib eye was ok, I have had better tasting braised short rib dishes throughout the city and this tasted like a worse version of those.  The sides on this dish were truffle mashed (A+) and creamed spinach (C).     Dessert was a pistachio mousse and was nothing to write home about, just ok. We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine with dinner Chappellet  Mountain Cuvee blend, which was great, but at almost 3 times retail markup, that is asking a lot.  Overall bill with tip $270.  I wasn't necessarily uncomfortable with the bill or felt like I had been ripped off, I knew it was an expensive restaurant when I made the reservation, but that doesn't mean I feel like I got value for my $.   Maybe this is where my confusion lies with Cibo Matto, the whole time I was there I enjoyed it, but don't really want to go back.  I would rather spend my money at Anteprima or somewhere else that gives me exceptional food at a slightly lower price point.  Maybe the ultra-swanky, trend setting spot is not my style?

There was also a generous topping of crispy garlic bits over the spaghetti which added a nice crunch to each mouthful of pasta I had. The grilled octopus was extremely tender. Our server told us that the octopus was marinated in yoghurt which gives it a soft and tender texture. Our server was on top of things and she made sure to check in every now and then.

Even though there were plenty of tables still seated and eating they started clearing sections of the restaurants in preparation for closing for the night.

2010-10-05,2.0,"It's a gorgeous spot, and we had high hopes for our anniversary dinner. However, Cibo Matto missed the mark. Overall I'd say lots of style, but definitely lacking on substance.  Husband ordered the Buffalo Milk mozzarella salad with lobster. I tasted it - it was really fantastic. Perfectly seasoned with a beautiful zing of lemon. Delicious. Wished I had ordered it! My salad (the Fior de Latte with asparagus) was solidly average. Under-seasoned and just overall kind of blah. Husband had the squid ink pasta for dinner and said there was barely any crab in it. Then things went downhill fast with my entree. The fish (I ordered the skate wing) was spoiled and reeked of ammonia. I could barely swallow one bite, and I did it only out of politeness. How did they not notice the smell in the kitchen? Really gross. Not wanting to spoil the anniversary vibe, we only mentioned it on the way out, which I kind of regret now. For the price we paid, I would expect better service. Our waiter, who definitely won the genetic lottery, failed to follow up after our entrees were served and never inquired why I didn't  touch my fish. He also forgot my wine with my entree. I loved my dessert (the ""strawberry"" with panna cotta) and that definitely was a highlight, as was the delicious butter served with the warm bread. Cibo Matto...you've got so much potential there. But spoiled fish just can't happen. I'm rating it two stars for the beautiful room, husband's salad and the dessert.",0.9942,0.721,0.212,0.066,0.6033333333333333

Squid Ink Spaghetti - was very excited about trying this after reading so many positive reviews on the dish.

He exceeded my expectations. He suggested a wine not on the menu that was very good. Of course, I can't remember it, damn!

I have to write this disclaimer first - my friend is friendly with the exec. chef, so we did have quite a different experience on our visit. We actually didn't intend to have dinner there, but had a birthday party at the Roof two Saturdays ago. and after half an hour of being packed line sardines, my friend and I decided to run downstairs to the restaurant for a quieter night out. Chef Todd sat us at one of the chef's table right in front of the kitchen. I started my night with a glass of prosecco and my date ordered a bottle of the BV Tapestry Reserve which he was surprised to see was so moderately priced. We selected three dishes that we wanted to try. The Mozzarella di bufala, bucatini, and the kobe sirloin. I thought the buffalo mozzarella was like any standard version of it. After that, the chefs sent us a plate of the grilled octopus - wow. The octopus was slightly charred on the outside but really soft and easy to eat with the saffron aioli. I thought the bucatini was also very good. A different take on carbonara for sure. The bucatini reminded me a little of udon noodles. While we we waiting for some more items to come out, we sampled a plate of the salumi from the case on the wall next to the chef's table. All very excellent. The highlight of the evening for me was definitely the Kobe sirloin that they split on two dishes since my date and I were sharing. What an excellent dish! The mean was so tender and the rapini was prepared perfectly.  On a past visit to the Roof, I also got to try the squid ink past from Cibo Matto. Definitely one of my favorite pasta dishes in Chicago. They sure don't skimp on the lump crab meat.  It was for my past two experiences at Cibo that the Yelp Elite event this past Sunday  would be excellent and was one I didn't want to miss. Boy was I right! They really pulled off an excellent evening for Yelpers. I think the excellent quality in food will bring me back in again and again.

Cibo Matto is new since I was last living in Chicago, so it was great to get a chance to eat here and have such an excellent experience. Our server was everything you'd expect in a nice restaurant and then some. He was very attentive towards our table and had many recommendations for appetizers, main course, and wine. We ended up each trying some of his recommendations (he had several) and were very pleased with our food. We tried two very unique pasta dishes, one featuring duck egg and another a unique take on spaghetti, and both were wonderful. (Note that the small portion of the pasta is plenty big for most people!) They also had the cool surprise of having a skate fish and showed us how to eat it. Our wine glasses never went unfilled, and all of the staff was aware of when our show started but still provided a really relaxed experience while making sure we were done on time.

Our drinks finally arrived and the waiter began to walk away....""Ummm, excuse me, do you have a dessert menu?""  Why am I even asking this, this is his job?!?!?  We received an ""Of course"" and again more apologies.   Our dessert was DELICIOUS!!!  No complaints here!!!  However, by the time our dessert arrived, we had run into some friends who had plopped down at our table and I guess the waiter assumed we did not want to be disturbed.  So....another 15 minutes after the completion of our dessert goes by.  Finally the waiter returns.

This would have been fine if it wasn't for the ridiculous prices of drinks. I ordered a Glenlivet on the rocks and it must have been a measly 2 ounces in an over sized glass.

The highlights were a watercress salad with goat cheese, a prawn dish which was to die for, and a gorgeous white chocolate mousse tart.  They served 'Hum' drinks paired with each dish. I don't recommend this drink to any fan of liquor. They never really explained what the 'Hum' drink came from or why they were doing this service around this particular drink.

On the plus side, I really like the space.  The service was friendly and made good recommendations, although the waiter I had might be a little too overtly butch for some people.  So on to the food.   I started with one of their mozzarella salads.  The one I had had buffalo mozzarella, some greens, almonds with orange blossom honey, some proscuitto and rhubarb.  It worked nicely and I really enjoyed it. Then I had two pasta dishes - I'm sure a violation of Italian dining tradition, but I'm neither Italian nor prone to follow tradition.  I started with their spaghetti, which is a squid-ink chitarra spaghetti, with lump crab meat, thin slices of chile, and mint.  And these amazing little cherry tomatoes that explode with perfect flavor - every single one of them. This dish, in my opinion, is a masterpiece.  I really enjoyed it.  It's pretty simple, but beautiful with balanced flavors. My second dish, in truth 90% of the reason I wanted to try CiboMatto, was their bucatini.  This dish was, honestly, a disappointment.  It is just as beautiful in person as it has been in photos, but the pasta was undercooked and not quite aldente, although the positive to that is that I was able to tell it's quite fresh pasta.  That wasn't really a deal-breaker, but I think it contributed to what was its downfall - it was really dry.  I think the undercooked pasta just sucked up any moisture that came into contact with it, creating a gummy dish.  The pancetta was also overkill.  There really shouldn't be enough to have some in every bite, in my opinion - I had some in most bites, and ended up with a couple spoonfuls of it still sitting in the bottom of my bowl.  This isn't a diner, and some level of restraint is warranted.  The difference between fine food and diner food is the difference between watching a a refined but sensual woman seduce you and a stripper at a full nudity strip club give you a lap dance.  Maybe they both have their place, but shouldn't be at home together - too much bacon in a dish leans dangerously close to the latter. Lastly, the wines by the glass recommended by the server were both excellent with the food, and the biscotti with cappachino made a nice end to the dinner.  And I really enjoyed the cocktail I started with, their Acquantance, made with Aperol, St. Germain, grapefruit juice,  and prosecco.  It comes across like a lighter, less bitter negroni, which I think is a great thing for the spring. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. They also brought out a stunning amuse buche consisting of a spoonful of a powerful lamb ragu with a nice cheese grated on it.  I'd love to see that served with gnocchi or just spaghetti sometime.",0.9986,0.749,0.218,0.033,0.5641299008320284

We immediately didn't connect with our waiter who we all thought was trying to plump up our bill by recommending expensive $200 bottles of wine and not really offering any valid advice on what to order. The appetizers had an overwhelmingly common (in both meanings) ingredient -- mozzarella, the pastas appeared mediocre on the menu, and the entree section left me wanting more invention. I had a difficult time figuring out what I wanted to order but it wasn't because of the plethora of fascinating options -- more of the lack there of. I ended up choosing the sauteed chicken livers on polenta for an appetizer and halfway through I switched with my husband's mozarella, honey, and blood orange salad. The flavor didn't ""pop"" in my mouth and I felt both were very under-seasoned. My entree was skate wing with lemon and capers. My husband got the veal. Both were -- yet again -- extremely under-seasoned. For dessert, it was the lemon pudding and lemoncello sorbet. The sorbet was fantastic but that would be hard to screw up in the first place. Let me just conclude by saying that nothing was overtly disgusting -- I just expected a LOT more for my money. Maybe it's just me being a food snob, but I felt my expensive bill was to pay for the decor and not the food.

2010-01-08,3.0,"I feel bad for the front of the house workers at State and Lake, who probably spend half their time telling people they aren't Cibo Matto (which is one flight of stairs up).  Maybe they think a sign with an upwards arrow is too tacky. I came here for lunch (not crowded, so no reservations needed), because the 2009 cover of Time Out Chicago's 100 best eats issue had a mouth watering picture of Cibo Matto's bucatini.  I think I actually licked the cover. The bucatini ($16 at lunch) is a carbonara with pancetta, pecorino romano cheese, cracked pepper, and a duck egg yolk on top.  The waiter didn't explain, but if you're unfamiliar with carbonara, the yolk forms the sauce with the cheese and cracked pepper, so you're supposed to mix it until it coats the pasta.  Carbonaras usually use chicken eggs and come pre-mixed, but the yolk on top makes for a beautiful presentation.  Given the price, I'm guessing the lunch portion is the same as the Primi sized portion at dinner.  Although it might not leave you full by itself, it should be enough for most people if you help yourself to the free bread or an appetizer or dessert. Overall, the bucatini was good.  It was not as rich as I expected given the use of a duck egg.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the pancetta was crisped up nicely, but since it's hard to get pancetta in every bite, I wish the yolk had been salted or more cheese had been added to the dish.  The only reason I wouldn't get this again would be because of the price to portion ratio. We asked for bread (not sure why they didn't bring it out on their own), and although it wasn't warm, it tasted fresh, and I liked the salted crust and the salted butter it came with. For dessert, I got the gianduja crunch bar with banana caramel and hazelnut brittle ($9).  It definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.  The ""crunch bar"" was like an upscale hazelnut chocolate bar in the form of a log, and I really liked the hazelnut brittle. Service was good, although the entrees took a while to come out.  They kept refilling our water glasses without any prompting, and they offered to check our coats (at no charge).",0.994,0.814,0.149,0.036,0.5980286738351254

Inside I noticed they made their own salumi and cheese on premise.  Huge thumbs up.  The chef even offered us a sampling of prosciutto and sausage on crostinis...simply divine.  I wish I had ordered food that took advantage of their on premise making. I ordered the garganelle pasta dish which was great.  It had a surprising amount of spice to it; and the noodles were cooked to a perfect, slightly firm al dente.  The real standout was the Nantucket bay scallops though.  They were seared perfectly seared and were so flavorful and fresh tasting.  Probably the best scallops I've ever tasted.  I also got a side of brussel sprouts; which was a mistake on my part.  I don't like grained mustard (had a wasabi like quality about it); but other than that they tasted good. Our server was kind and overall the service was great; despite putting one thing on the check we didn't order.  To be fair, she had to split the check like 10+ ways; and its hard to keep track of all that.

2009-11-21,2.0,"Cibo Matto is not bad. But that faint praise isn't exactly what you're looking for if you want it all -- a fabulous meal with fabulous service in a fabulous location.  To start with the positive, Cibo Matto most definitely does have a fabulous location, and the decor is unique, trendy and stylish. I love the way the room is styled, from the light wood tables, to the patterned lamp shades, to the glass wine cave in the center of the space towards the back of the main dining room. The only kind of weird part is the painting (?) that occupies most of the ceiling - it's a huge strange painting of people and what look like azalea branches or something. Anyway it is incongruous with the rest of the room, but doesn't completely ruin it. But you're probably more interested in the food and service, and that's where this restaurant has some work to do. I went there for lunch, so I can't speak to dinner (though per our server, some of the same dishes are offered). I had the frisee salad which was supposed to come with a ""coddled egg"" and fried pancetta. Instead, it came with what looked like scrambled egg - no joke - it looked really gross, scrambled egg in a salad, and was of course not what the menu said. It didn't taste awful, but it would be hard to recommend it. The antipasti that I had - dried sausages, and a mozzarella + apple dish were fine, though again the mozzarella dish wasn't exactly as described -- in addition to the mozz & apple, there was a LOT of parsley, which did not go with the dish at all, and had to be picked off if you wanted to enjoy the delicacy of the cheese.  Service was ok - I feel a little bad here being too rough on our server, because it was pretty obvious to me that he was new at this, and that he was trying, but the service was simply not that great - he didn't get the timing, so he would just hang around behind the table for a really long time before, say, coming over and asking to take orders. He clearly wanted to go by a ""ladies first"" ordering rule, but then since we were not all next to each other, he seemed to get messed up about what order to go in. I could give further examples, but you get the idea - the intention was right, but the execution was always just off by a beat. In the end all the little mistakes added to my disappointment in the experience.  That said, if the little details like that don't bother you and you want to have lunch in a nicely decorated loop location, Cibo Matto might please you just fine.",0.9926,0.795,0.153,0.051,0.5739974937343357

2009-11-10,2.0,"Hmmmm. Cibo Matto is painted in some reviews as a gorgeous dream of a place, and while the decor is gorgeous, the rest of the experience is more of a nightmare.  We went on a Saturday night, for our anniversary. When my guy made the reservation, he requested a booth and let them know it was a special occasion. We showed up about 10 minutes early (due to an over-zealous cabbie), and were promptly seated at one of the worst tables in the entire room; right outside of the kitchen and the inner seat was against the wall, limiting my view to the table next to us. Our booth request was completely ignored, even though several booths were vacant. OK, we get that you might want to save them for a bigger group, so we don't say anything. A busboy came up and mumbled something about water, which we eventually realized was ""do you want sparkling or tap?"" Then our waiter breezes by, asking if we'd decided on a wine. Uh, we just sat down , pal. He huffs off, as if we'd wasted his time and then ignores us for 10 minutes, at which point he comes back with an amuse bouche. He briefly explains it (shaved daikon radish with bits of something else- tasted like cole slaw), and we order the salumi plate and a bottle of wine. Our salumi arrived really quickly via food runner, like he swiped it from another table, and was plunked unceremoniously in the middle of our table. None of the types of salumi were explained, so we attempted to suss it out for ourselves. One might have been duck. Who knows? As we start on that, I notice that we have no bread, but figure it will be along in a minute. Our wine arrives with the surly sommelier, who basically sticks it in my boyfriend's face so abruptly that he has to jump back a little to avoid a collision. He nods that this is the bottle we wanted and the sommelier goes about trying to open it. Since he is practically standing on top of us, we refrain from talking and politely wait for him to open the bottle. But he's having a hell of a time with it, so he informs us that ""you know, you can keep on eating and talking."" Thanks. I wasn't really sure. Because when a sommelier comes up to my table, he usually has something to say about the wine he's delivering, or about the weather, or about our dinner so far, or anything at all. I guess I was just so stunned by his complete non-service that I couldn't remember to eat or talk. Thankfully, he hurried off after filling our glasses.  Our waiter comes back to take our order and smirks when I order ""the chicken"" instead of ""pollo al griglia"" (sorry- I'd been drinking), and my boyfriend wisely orders the risotto (much easier to say). Our waiter's entire attitude toward us was ""oh yeah. you guys."" He was much more interested in the table next to us, who seemed to have ordered one of everything. Dinner is served really quickly. For all the inattention from the wait staff, we seem to be getting the first plates out of the kitchen. Which would be awesome, if I was in a hurry. Instead, I just feel like I'm being rushed out. The pollo al griglia is very tasty, but a little too charred on the ends. We still have no bread, so we wave down the waiter to get some. He dumps some on the table moments later, with no apology.  We finish dinner, and the waiter dumps off some dessert menus. The desserts seem completely uninspired, so we decline. Our waiter seems to take this personally, and snatches the menus from our hands. He comes back while my boyfriend is in the bathroom and leaves a small plate with two nougats. AND the check. Which had not been asked for. I wonder if he's trying to tell us something? He pops his head around the wall a minute later and asks ""it's someone's birthday?"" Uh no. Our anniversary. ""Yeah. Congratulations. Uh, I think we have something for you."" Is it a better waiter and a booth? 'Cause we coulda used that earlier. It turns out the ""something"" for us is a plate of cookies, which were good, but not too exciting. That sure saved the evening. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves, mostly laughing at the horrible service and admiring the decor. The place is gorgeous- and the bathrooms are amazing. It's definitely a place that will impress an out-of-towner, or a date. But the service is spotty - although the hostess did walk my guy to the bathrooms rather than point them out- and the food is good, not spectacular. I didn't feel that the dishes were overpriced, but the wine was. I'd go back, maybe on a slower night, to try it again, but not anytime soon. Our final bill is $119, for salumi, risotto, pollo al griglia and a $49 bottle of Mazzi valpolicella. See what I mean about the wine? It was great, but normally retails for around $25.",0.9958,0.825,0.119,0.056,0.49803516313932966
2009-10-27,3.0,"Let me preface my review by saying this...My friends took me here as a suprise.  This review is based on my own food tasting palate.   For my birthday, my friends took me here.  It was a surprise celebration of my closest and dearest friends here in Chicago.  We were sitting in the private dining room.  It was wonderful and I loved the decorations.  The atmosphere is swanky and very wittish.  You wont get the feeling you are going to be seeing a lot of the people from the Roof.  That is a good thing, especially if you are coming here on a date.  The waitstaff was wonderful and was at our undivided attention.  One thing to note, notify the waitstaff if you want to partake in tasting all of the dishes because they WILL bring them out without warning.  We wanted to taste some of the dishes but not all of them.   By the time we finished, the bill was rather hefty.  Right now, my friends are eatting off of Ramen noodles and Campbell's soup to supplement the damage done for that one night.  I guess you could say I'm an expensive person to have as a friend.  LOL! Wink, wink, wink!  Not, I will do a hot dog stand any day!   As for the food indulgence, I heard mixed reviews around the table.  One of my friends told me that he and his wife were headed to Popeye's afterward for chicken because they were still hungry.  I don't think they went.  However, I know what alarmed him.  It was the burrata (smoked bacon, onion marmalata, frisee, wild arugula).  There were some too die for dishes such as the spaghetti alla chittara ( squid ink pasta, lump crab, cherry tomatoes serrano chilis) and POLLO AL GRIGLIA (grilled farm chicken, cured tomato, fiorello peppers, cipollini onion oyster mushrooms) or the TAGLIATA DI MANZO (grilled american kobe sirloin, lemon & thyme roasted potatoes tuscan kale).  Many ate it up before it even got to me.   As for my dish,  I had the Vitello.  I am a huge fan of veal since I don't know how to cook it at home.  I had this impression that it was going to be mouthwatering good.  Hmmm, I will say that it was average at best.  The flavor was missing!  I was truly expecting more. I think there main focus is possibly seafood and that is demonstrated by many of the options that are listed on the menu.  If you are looking for more of a variety, this may not be a good place for you. For the fellas looking to impress a lady, the atmosphere alone will do that.  She may want to treat you afterwards.  LOL!  You may have your date raise her eyebrow on such a great place.  For those foodies, looking for great food and listen to the ""Check Please Reviews"", I'd say check it out for lunch.   The menu is okay but not stellar.

2009-10-13,4.0,"My expectations were tempered a bit by the reviews here but I was really pleasantly surprised by Cibo Matto. We entered under the ""Cibo Matto"" sign that takes you into the ""State & Lake"" restaurant.  The guy at the front desk told us to head upstairs to Cibo Matto (State & Lake looked pretty nice though.)   Upstairs Cibo Matto looked very cool.  The atmosphere and decor is very swanky yet modern.  There are tall booths as well as tables and long communal tables in the front that you can probably snag without a reservation for a more casual feel.  There is a huge mural on the ceiling that is very colorful and I kept looking at.  Beautiful fresh flowers around and a cool textured back wall.  We sat in the back with our backs to the open kitchen. Our server was, for me, one of the best parts of the meal, not only was he super knowledgeable about the menu, he'd tasted everything on it and was just really excited about food.  I get really excited about food so I saw a kindred spirit in him. We were eating on the night that they debuted their fall menu.    We ordered drinks (loved their champagne and wine glasses.)  The amuse bouche was a citrusy tuna salad type bite, it was ok.  I was the only one at our table who tried it. The menu is divided up into appetizers, pastas and ""primo's"" or main meats and fish.  The suggestion is to order your own appetizer and main and share 2 or 3 pastas in between, depending on the size of your party. Frankly, I thought that pasta portions would be enough for one, but I like smaller pasta portions. But  I could see how you could order pasta for yourself and think it was too little but they're not meant to be ordered for one.   I ordered the scallops to start, very large, plump, nicely seared scallops with a celery root puree (I'm not a big fan of celery but the taste of this intrigued me) there was also a different sauce on the place, spicier, I cant remember exactly what it was but very good. We then ordered, to share, the butternut squash pasta with brown butter sage sauce and the saffron with friend calamari risotto.  The squash pasta was 9 homemade candy shaped pasta packages filled with a very sweet (obviously, because they are so in season) butternut squash.  A little sweet for me but a good couple of bites, I wouldn't have liked it had I ordered the whole plate for myself but it was good to just have 2 pieces.  The saffron risotto was perfect.  Super tasty and the rice was cooked perfectly, chewy and al dente. For the main I had the kobe beef which was cooked perfectly and sliced with potatoes and kale.  My husband had the same dish and thought the meat was a little tough, but he and I like meat cooked differently so I ordered mine chef's choice (medium rare) and he ordered medium.  It was fine for me. The dessert menu looked good, we shared the friend doughnuts which were small balls,kind of odd, they were fine.  They also brought out a homemade nougat to finish that everyone got. Overall I really liked this place and am surprised at the preceding reviews.  I thought that atmosphere was great, the food and service were also very, very good.  I would go back!",0.9994,0.733,0.246,0.021,0.606499644633973

There are things I love, things I hate and then those things that just fall somewhere in the middle - in fact, Erin P and her 'I Nothing You' list would be so apropos here - because Cibo Matto, you are most definitively one of these things.   Perhaps I am too hard to please, maybe I just expected more... either way, Cibo Matto fell short for me in almost every category, well, every one except for that fabulously dramatic décor and design of course. Visually appealing, but not much more, Cibo Matto left me wishing, begging and yearning for better service, better execution, better flavor profiles, better EVERYTHING. My appetizer of crispy sweetbreads, lemon fritto and huckleberries was tiny... laughably tiny. I've seen this dish pictured in other reviews beforehand and was definitely served in plenty previously. They either scaled back the portion (yet maintained the $15 app price tag) or were just short serving for who-knows-what reason that evening. It was not apt for sharing. Disappointing. My entrée of grilled halibut on the bone with heirloom tomato panzanella and calabrian chili vinaigrette was also a bit of a dish flop. Shockingly bland... all those big flavors, yet positively zero zip. As a frequent cook of halibut at home - not to toot my own horn - I blow this sad dish out of the water... even the pan-sear was subpar and disheartening leaving me nothing but fish frustrated. Things finally picked up a bit with the braised short rib and ricotta creamed spinach plate. The dish was hearty, full of flavor, substantial and definitely (ahem, finally) prepared well... make a note that this is your go-to Cibo Matto ace in the hole, trust me. Biggest discontentment of the evening though came from jumbled, sloppy, stumbling service and a dessert cheese course so inept I asked to have it taken off the bill. A plate of cheeses served with jam and preserves but no utensils and no bread. They apparently don't even have bread. Eh??

2009-09-28,5.0,"If you haven't heard of the Wit, certainly all the buzz in Chicago when it opened a short while ago, where have you been?!? A high-end extension of the Double Tree branded hotel chain, is probably most talked about for its rooftop club/lounge appropriately named ""Roof"" which by now all of Chicago's A-List has surely frequented. The hotel though actually has three restaurants, Roof, State and Lake,and cibomatto. Designed by the ""The Johnson Studio"" (TRU) and with a superbly created menu by re known Chef Stein and Pastry Chef Tina Blanco, cibomatto is a wonderful combination of atmosphere, small and large plate Italian dishes, and an exquisite wine list.  I visited cibomatto a week after it opened. The service was excellent and food very top notch. Out of a number of dishes sampled, the Bucatini was probably my favorite and highly recommended. Also excellent were the Prosciutto Salad, Squash Blossoms (probably a seasonal special), Costolette, and Halibut.  Definitely a place to try!",0.9809,0.823,0.177,0.0,0.5975158730158731
2009-09-27,5.0,"This place is fantastic!  My boyfriend treated me to dinner here on my birthday.  As you enter The Wit, the atmosphere is contemporary and almost night clubbish.  The restaurant is on the second floor, so you have to navigate a narrow staircase to get up there, but no big deal. The decor in the restaurant is great- beautiful art on the ceiling, and an array of normal tables as well as tables with upholstered couch/chairs.  Our server approached and introduced herself.  She asked if we had any dietary restrictions right away.  I am a vegetarian and was tempted to say that I didn't have any restrictions (I figure that I know what I can and can't order) but was glad that I mentioned it when she told me that normally the bread comes with ""pork lardo"" rather than butter and the chef sends out a taste of something before the meal and tonight's was lobster mousse.  I got a vegetarian taste instead. My boyfriend started with the Burrata- a salad of arugula, the freshest nectarines ever and mozzarella.  I had the arugula salad which was fresh and crisp, but pretty lemony.  I'd wished I had ordered his salad. My Primi course was a pasta coins with crisp corn, mushrooms, and spices.  It was phenomenal- slightly sweet and with great presentation.  For my entree, I had a spaghetti dish that was unique and delicious. My boyfriend was unknowingly ordering a drink that was very sweet, and the server, rather than just taking the order with no commentary, mentioned it and tried to help him order something he would love.  She surprised him by bringing a special drink made with some liquors he likes.  A really nice touch. All in all, the best things about the restaurant are the decor and service.  The food is most excellent but of course the prices aren't cheap!  We will most certainly be back.",0.9978,0.759,0.225,0.015,0.6226497695852535

The food was fabulous there, we had scallops (melts in your mouth with this olive paste that was phenomenal), octopus (as tender as the other reviewers said and the vinaigrette provided the perfect contrast) and sweetbreads (i must say that was the weakest dish of the evening. I love sweetbreads but those were undercooked and that's something you don't want to have when its not cooked thoroughly. The lemon slices that came fried with it was awesome however).  my friend and i shared the buccatini with duck egg, honestly i don't understand why one of the reviewers said it was bland. Not all pasta has to be drowned in sauce to be flavorful! the pasta we had was toothsome, full of great bacon and egg flavor, I'll go back just for that. We also had the tuna special of the evening and to be honest, we were so full we had just one bite and took the rest of that home. For dessert we had the fried doughnuts with coffee crema, super yum, who doesn't like fried dough?  our server Ryan was informative and helpful, and checked with us often to see if we enjoyed our food, kudos to that! can't wait to go back there again",0.9946,0.746,0.214,0.04,0.6157467532467532
2009-09-15,2.0,"went here for the free friends & family lunch event last week prior to Cibo's opening lunch day (today).  so you know how it works...you can get anything you want for free except alcohol, just have to tip.  having said this, my review is based on the fact that even though it was free, i did not enjoy it and would never pay to eat here.  we did like the apps and desserts, but that was it, and even those weren't worth the hefty price tag.   Appetizers:  the buffalo mozzarela and tomato w/cucumbers (like a caprese but fancier) was one of the best dishes we had.  presentation was also beautiful w/all the colors.  also ordered the bruschetta - it came out with only 3 tiny pieces of bread.  we had 4 people in our group.  why would you bother even serving a dish that has 3 pieces of anything??  at least tell the people ordering that the dish is so small so we can get an additional appetizer or 2 orders of bruschetta (which is what we ended up doing).  however, it was really tasty...there was a pesto w/ricotta cheese on top that was just fantastic.  definitely need to serve either a bigger portion or just larger pieces of bread. Entrees:  i ordered the bucatini carbonara pasta which sounded interesting since it was described as being served with pancetta (like extra fatty bacon bits) and an egg yolk on top that you break over the pasta and mix in.  the menu says it has pepper and chilis in it, but this was the most bland pasta dish i have ever had.  the egg yolk added nothing at all to the dish, there was no flavor except for the greasy, fatty bits of pancetta, which were few and far between until i found a mound of them at the bottom of my bowl.  the portion was pretty small for a $16 dish (we were surprised as we had planned to share it) and definitely not worth the price.  i wouldn't even eat this dish again for free.  it needs something like veggies or some kind of sauce...there was just absolutely nothing going on with this dish - it was very boring and forgetable. One friend got the eggplant panini (probably the best entree although that's not saying much at all) - it tasted like pizza somehow, i guess the sauce, and the bread was burnt - and it would've been $14.  rip off.  Other friend got the rigatoni pasta, which was equivalent to like the taste of a lean cuisine frozen meal, and would've been $16.  rip off.   Desserts:  def the highlight of the meal!  hazelnut mocha cake with Nutella gelato was fab!  not too sweet and just enough to share between 2 people.  the greek yogurt panna cotta we tried at the urging of the waitress and it was not good at all - none of the 4 of us like it and we are dessert fiends!  still would not order these desserts at $9 a pop ($7 for the 2 baby scoops of gelato). Summary:  if the food were good here, i would be happy to have a $30 lunch close to my office.  however, i got the food for FREE and was disappointed.  that in itself says enough.  Cibo Matto is yet again another over-priced, unremarkable hotel restaurant that only the lazy people staying at the hotel should ever care to venture into.  don't waste your time or money going here...",0.9979,0.777,0.174,0.049,0.5563725490196079
2009-09-09,2.0,"Cibo Matto - mediocre food dressed up in a pretentious package; uncomfortable experience with waiter. I don't recommend this restaurant.  If you want great, high-level cuisine, you won't get it.  If you want a hip place to kick back and dine on whatever, you go somewhere else with better ambiance.  If you want to skip all that and get tipsy on some creative or different drinks, you'll be disappointed. Arugula salad was inedible.  It was both extremely acidic and salty.  Imagine the last serving of a batch of arugula mixed with vinegar 15 mintues ago, sitting in a pool of vinegar, that is taken out and then salted twice.  I really couldn't believe how over seasoned it was -- if anyone had tasted it before it left the kitchen, it would have been immediately rejected.  Both halibut and trout dishes were forgettable and lacked creativity -- execution did not make up for lack of creativity, either, as components were either under or over seasoned. Spaghetti was good, very good. Cocktails were terrible.  Most uninspired and poorly executed I've had in a long time.   Waiter was unbelievable.  When I asked about what's good, he read the ENTIRE menu.  He went through each dish and listed every ingredient.  He wasn't even able to summarize or provide highlights.  He just read the full text of the menu and took about 10 minutes to do so.  Normally, I like getting chummy with my waiter and kicking back comfortably with him/her.  But wow, this was unheard of.  He explaining that he was on a cooking reality show, and that he was previously studying theatre and so on, and so forth.  He acted like he knew what he was talking about when it came to the food, but couldn't pronounce basic ingredients, and missed the mark on explaining others.  To his credit, he was super amped the whole time -- but ultimately, it was detracting from the experience.  I was horrified when he went through the EXACT same spiel with the couple that sat down next to us towards the end of our meal.  Maybe he was just nervous.  I'm not sure.  But it was uncomfortable.  Not a bad person -- just a bad waiter.",-0.7367,0.813,0.094,0.092,0.5606763285024156
2009-09-06,2.0,"I ate here the first week it opened.  I guess we had high expectations, and in the end we were let down.  The food had high points and low points, our server was obnoxious, and the cocktails were mediocre.   For appetizers we ordered the scallop dish, the buffalo mozzarella dish, and the arugula salad.  The scallops were very good, but it really didn't stand out from other great scallop dishes you can get at other restaurants.  The buffalo mozzarella dish was divine.  The concept seemed to be combining a caprese salad and a prosciutto and melon dish.  It worked!  The arugula salad however, did not.  It was overly acidic and salty, we could barely eat it.   For our entrees we ordered the spaghetti, a trout dish, and a halibut dish.  The fish dishes were unremarkable and forgettable.  The spaghetti on the other hand, was one of the best spaghettis I ever had.  The pasta was hand-made and chewy, the sauce was seasoned just right. The other aspects of our meal were all unremarkable.  The cocktails were mediocre, one actually tasted like wax.  I can't even remember what we had for dessert.  What would have been an easily forgettable meal, was made unforgettable by our obnoxious and annoying server.  I won't give his name, though it is burned in my mind at the moment.  He started off by practically reading the menu off to us.  He was also overly hyper.  At the beginning of our meal, he wouldn't stop bothering us.  Toward the end, we couldn't even find him.  He told us things like how parmigiano reggiano is one of the ""best"" cheeses.  I probably won't go back in fear that I have him for my server again.",0.976,0.831,0.12,0.049,0.46871746031746037
2009-08-24,5.0,"Sunday, August 16th. It looks like it's going to storm.  I checked the weather on-line earlier in the day to make sure that my birthday dinner scheduled at 8:30pm in the most beautiful patio in town won't ""fall in water""-  as we say in French to mean ""cancel"".  How appropriate. The weather dudes said: ""Leave your jacket and your umbrella at home"" Never trust them. Around 3:30pm we received a phone call from Piccolo Sogno to inform us that we had to stop dreaming right there and now. They were not opening the patio. It started to pour. Just on queue. Panic. 10 minutes of ""oh my God, what am I going to do"" later - I decide to climb the sleek stairs from the Wit lobby to Cibo Matto. Since we were already there, I figured it would be an easy option. Arriving in the empty restaurant getting ready for the night, I ask to see the menu, take in the gorgeous space from the corner of my eye, find myself drooling over the menu and request a table for 11 that same night. They are delighted to have us, they are slow. That was a wonderful choice. The decor is simply incredibly elegant with Asian undertones and a unique fresco ceiling,  yet warm and inviting.... Clue: dried sausages are hanging from a lighted wall and it took all my self-control not to grab them and run away!! But as beautiful as the setting is - it's the food which won me over.... The crispy sweetbreads I ordered as an appetizer were just perfect. The slices of fried lemon and the huckleberries gave the dish a wonderful balance that is not easy to find. Big points. The octopus I tried was probably the best I have ever eaten...crispy polenta, celery, pearl onions and salsa verde - the combination may sound weird but it worked and made wonders for my taste buds. But what I keep thinking about is my pasta dish....my scrumptious, delicious, mouth-watering spaghetti alla chitarra. Despite the name - no guitar involved just yummy lumps of crab, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers and squid-ink spaghetti.....happiness on a plate. I almost regretted ordering the appetizer portion. Which was still big enough to satisfy me as well as most of my guests. No dessert from the house for us that night since we had a delicious home-made chocolate cake to celebrate but I can't wait to go back to have a look at the menu, and get some of that charcuterie that is still calling my name!!!",0.9945,0.809,0.156,0.035,0.6068586443586443

2009-08-06,5.0,"Cibo Matto means crazy food in Italian (or so I am told) and you'd be crazy not to check this place out. The food is fabulous, the service top notch and the ambiance warm and inviting.  There are two ways to get into this place. The stairs that you find inside the State and Lake restaurant. Or if you are wearing shoes that are not slippery stair friendly- just walk into the Wit and take the elevator up to the second floor. On this approach you get to walk through what they call the ""library"" but it's books with composite photo covers and bright fuchsia pillows on the chairs make it unlike any library I've ever seen!  Back to the restaurant. We started with a couple of drinks in the bar area. Nice. Comfy chairs to cluster about, metal(?) strings serving as curtains, servers who were on their game. A great start.  We were then seated in the back of the large room. I almost wished there were only 4 of us instead of 5 as the cream colored ""booths""(too simple a word for the lush seats that compose the center of the room) called to me and the people sitting in them looked so chic and cool!  Our server, Phil, was great- taking time to explain the menu- talk to us about what would be a good way to taste all we wanted to taste and just being patient with our lively (and sometimes loud) group.  We started with a range of the appetizers- heirloom tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella, grilled octopus, and an arugula salad with shaved Parmesan. All delicious.  Our pasta course was comprised of three of their pastas- the raviolis with peas and ricotta, the corzetti with pasta coins and corn and mushrooms and the winner of them all the Bucatini with big chunks of bacon and served with a duck egg. While we went with the smaller plates of the first two- they made us an entree sized portion of the Bucatini which was gone in a flash. I would go back just for that!  As for entrees (like we needed them after all this food- can you say leftovers?) I had the braised short rib with ricotta creamed spinach- absolutely fabulous!  As the night went on- we also decided that desserts were in order. We had the mini donut holes with dipping sauce and the plate of cookies. Both of these were just okay . . . .but really nothing to shout about.  As for cost- this is not a cheap date but definitely worth the money when you are ready to splurge. Dinner for 5 of us including a couple bottles of wine and all courses came in just under $600.  Right now there is free valet parking (yes- I said FREE) if you get your ticket validated at the restaurant. Always a nice bonus. And don't forget to check out the glass enclosed 4000 bottle wine tower. Impressive!  What is it about The WIT where everything they seem to be doing is right?

Walking upstairs you enter in a state of loveliness, Cibo Matto. *Smiles abound* I've been wanting to come here for a few weeks, check that, its only been open a few weeks, and was glad that Caroline A could come and join me for dinner. From the moment you step on to the second floor, I was slightly overwhelmed by the attention and eagerness of everyone on the staff. As I waited I was seated by the side, drink and wine list in hand, heart calling for prosecco, I got to sit back and admire. The place is pretty spectacular. Gorgeous even. Simple, clean, interesting, drawing the eyes to spots and with simple yet intrinsic designs weaves its magic of holding one there in awe. Then I see the menu and get all ""Awww yeah!"" Some delectable and delicious delights awaited me. Such hard choices for Caro and I. We narrowed it down to four and then made the final two: Crudo di Hamachi and the Mozzarella di Bufala. The hamachi was not too thin but not too thick slices that were meaty and lightly flavorful and balanced well with the watercress pesto, olive oil and pine nuts. So well balanced that the flavors melded into one and where one ended and another one began was seamless. Velvety heaven. Then we turn to the simple bufala di mozzarella. My mouth and heart sang with every moment this dished danced on my palate. By far, the mozzarella was the most delicate, soft, melt in your mouth savor this flavor I have ever had to date. It blended well with the mint, proscuitto, summer melon and balsamic vinegar. A few simple but excellent ingredients blended well made for my happy start. We decided to skip the pasta and go straight for the main course, oh me oh my was I ever so glad to go for chicken. I know most people look at chicken and are underwhelmed. So bland. So boring. So mundane. Oh contrare monfrare... if chicken is done well, it can be a sure show stopper. This was done well. Three large pieces, on top of escarole and white beans with onions and pancetta. And really, nothing tops pancetta except more pancetta. The pieces were juicy, the skin was crisp and it was flavor country through out. I also had to try their polenta and that was well worth it to me. Soft, creamy, luscious. Yum.  Dessert. If you know me, this is one of my 275,000 weak spots. Chocolate would be another one. Their hazelnut mocha torte was layers of amazement, surrounded by a tuacca sabayon, (this rated high on the lickability scale), dancing around it was a coffee chocolate ganache, (which was rated at about the top of the lickability scale. In other words, you touch my ganache, you lose fingers.) The torte kept inviting you back for bite after bite until you finished it all off. I just had to oblige.  The service was great, always friendly, smiling and once she knew we were there to have fun, our server Leah was able to have a little fun with us. In a way as the place filled up the place seemed a little too busy for me. So much going on, so much energy it could make a person's head spin and it got loud. However, the food was wonderful, the company was great as always, the decor was gorgeous and  this place will be great for special night out or for that date with that certain someone.

However, when Rob L. sent me the text, ""Cibo Matto, 8/1,"" I couldn't resist! Done! My one complaint about the restaurant is the flight of stairs one has to take to get up there. It's not the most pleasant when wearing gorgeous five-inch sling backs... and even harder when you're coming down after two glasses of bubbly!  Ok... now that that's out of the way, I loved everything else. We had an early dinner at 6:30, and the restaurant was pretty empty. The dining room is gorgeous. Although it is Italian, the decor has a slight Japanese influence - lots of colorful tree branches, flowers and butterflies. The space is sleek and modern with rustic accents. I loved the gorgeous fresco ceiling - it gives the restaurant a very light and airy feel. I'm not one for modern design, but I really enjoyed this space.   The wine list is quite extensive, and our server seemed quite knowledgeable and made recommendations. We started with the Crudo di Hamachi and the Mozzarella di Bufala. The Hamachi was rich in texture, flavorful and fresh. It was served in a pool of olive oil, watercress pesto and pine nuts. It was delicious.  The Mozzerella was a simple appetizer, but very well done. It was served with a generous portion of salty proscuitto, summer melon and mint. The serving size was enough for two, but I think Rob might disagree.  On to the main course- I had the braised short ribs. Those who know me know that I practically have my PhD in Beefology, and am super picky. And Cibo Matto did it perfectly. The cut was perfectly marbled, slooowwly cooked and fell part with the touch of the fork. Combined with the ricotta creamed spinach, it was absolutely delicious. Portion size was quite nice too. I had a bite of Rob's creamy polenta, and is was fantastic. So the best part of dinner was dessert. I wasn't going to indulge, but the Hazelnut Mocha Torte was calling my name. No... it was screaming my name. Sitting in a pool of Tuaca Sabayon (a sweet milky sauce) and accented with droplets of dark chocolate glaze (the server brought Rob an extra spoon full of it later), it was rich, but not too heavy. I especially loved it because it was not too sweet!  Our server was lovely. She was friendly, knowledgeable and fun. Zero pretentiousness, which is always appreciated.

We had about 5 different waiters, and our main one was condescending about explaining everything to us in overly simplified and inflated language at the same time (for example, telling us how to read the menu when everyone knows what ""antipasti"" means). I didn't take offense or anything, I just felt like he was trying a little too hard to seem ""fancy"" instead of real.  We started with some sickeningly sweet $12 cocktails which were the only culinary/gustatory/whatever disappointment of the evening. Mine had Hangar One vodka which drew me to it, but it otherwise tasted and looked exactly like Fanta. I'm not one to say no to a $12 cocktail but it should basically blow my mind, not remind me of a soft drink.  Ok ok, enough bitching. The food was delicious. The salumi & pickle platter was a fun low brow/high brow combo, and both pasta dishes we ordered tasted incredibly fresh. One had sweet corn and the other had a bright green pea sauce that seemed like something you'd get at Chez Panisse. We also split some chicken that was tender and juicy, and came in a substantial portion. (unlike the pasta which was like $12 for 4 ravioli) We also got a salty & garlicky side dish of rapini--worth it. The highlight was dessert: lemon ricotta doughnuts that you dip in a creamy coffee sauce. We got coffee that came in a french press, so that was a nice touch. And they gave us a limoncello-esque shot to finish off the meal.  I wouldn't necessarily go back to Cibo Matto though I do recommend it if you have some $$ to burn, or if you could expense it or something.

My girlfriend and I were privileged enough to be invited to the 'soft' opening of the restaurant in advance of their July 7th opening. The dining room is beautifully decorated with a decidedly modern edge to everything. Dark polished wood lines the walls. The tall white booths are spacious and comfortable. The ceiling has a whimsical mural depicting floating modern looking individuals amidst a sea of apples and trees. There is an open kitchen towards the back and an entire hallway of restrooms off the side of the kitchen area. The restrooms are spacious and luxurious. A huge window looks out onto State street on the West side of the dining room. The host staff was extremely attentive and friendly.  Fenon the hostess was very amiable and kept us informed during our wait as to the status of our table. There was an army of managers in the dining room at all times doing serious manager things. Our cocktail server was informative and cheerful. When our party was sat, I inquired to the hostess about closing out the bill I had open with the cocktail server. The cocktail server just had it transferred to our dinner server which I thought was very nice of her, but unnecessary.   The service in Cibo Matto is seamless and non obtrusive. Everything ,every movement , motion and gesture is geared towards making the guest happy and comfortable. I was informed by our server that the kitchen produces Italian styled food with a focus on local producers whenever possible and that the name Cibo Matto means 'crazy food' in Italian.  For our appetizers we ordered the squid and sweet breads. The sweet breads were in a creamy lemony sauce with fried lemon slices and fried artichokes. They tasted like candy. The squid I didnt touch, but it looked like it was plated in a pleasing manner with a thread of pesto ringing the squid.  For a pasta course, we shared a spaghetti with rock shrimp and plum tomatoes. It was a delightful. The tomatoes were marinated in sugar and red wine with a hint of garlic that made them explode in my mouth bursting with flavor. My main course was the braised short rib with creamed spinach. It was a huge hunk of rib with generous marbling that was tender, succulent and rich. The short rib was perfectly matched with some creamed spinach  topped with a marscapone cheese. For dessert , we had the chocolate gelato . It was accompanied with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream. Intelligentsia coffee is served in a French press.  Although I wouldn't call any of the dishes we had 'crazy', this place is definitely passionate about what it does .
