2008-03-15,2.0,"Tokyo 21 is closed! The website states, ""WE'RE MOVING! Stay tuned for new location updates and Grand Opening information."" I suppose their terrible service, inconsistent menu selections and prices, and rude management caught up with them. They tried to advertise this place as if it were a ""sushi night club"" but it simply wasn't a club. It was a restaurant with a sleek facade which also happened to have a liquor bar and a sushi bar. I loved it, anyway. My fiance and I enjoyed dining at a restaurant that was ours for the taking because we were practically alone. We would sit at a great big booth with a grand table large enough for the enormous sushi platters we'd order.  The food was delicious and came with reasonable price tags (but sometimes your bill would be more expensive than advertised, or it would come with some additional items you never ordered). Although they never got the timing right, the food always came from the kitchen hot or fresh. The service was either over the top and in your face or non-existent. You might not get the appetizer you ordered, or perhaps it will come with the rest of the meal...or as dessert, but we were aware of that in advance and we exercised patience and forgiveness. The few times I did complain to the manager, he tried to avoid us or treated us rudely despite the fact that he obviously recognized us as regulars. I thought the only reason we went to Tokyo 21 was because we loved the food combined with several generous discount coupons we had accumulated, but after the coupons expired, we still wanted to go! But they're closed...so...nuts to that. We'll check it out if/when they open a new location.",0.9873,0.812,0.139,0.049,0.5832425638877252

I guess I went on the wrong day.  Our server was really nice and informative.  We really enjoyed his conversation until her slobbed at our table and never apologized...GROSS!   The food was luke warm.  I ordered the Kobe filet, with mashed potatoes and asparagus tempura.  Although it wasn't as hot as I would have liked, it was good.   My friends ordered various rolls.  There weren't any complaints but there weren't any praises either.   The drinks were mediocre at best.  I ordered the Asian mojito and my friends ordered the Tokyo sunrise that taste like cough syrup.  I eventually settled for a glass of syrah, which they were out of.   Maybe I'll try this place again on a different day.   I forgot to mention, we ordered the edamame and it rang higher than was listed in the menu.  We were also charged for drinks we didn't order.  I don't know about this one...We'll see!",0.9646,0.774,0.179,0.047,0.6678571428571428

2007-07-20,3.0,"I went to Tokyo 21 about a few months ago and was a bit apprehensive. I heard a few scattered reviews about the place and decided to try it out. I ordered a mango lobster roll and quite a few of their speciality rolls (caterpillar roll, Chicago roll, etc). Although the sushis were very unique and quite well-proportioned for the money I paid, it's not a place I would go back to as regularly. I guess the ambiance was lacking and the service was just so-so. It took forever to get someone to refill my water and to hand me my check. The sushi was good but it wasn't over-the-top impressive. I have to say they are very unique and created as if it was an art. However, when I look for sushi restaurants, it's more about quality and the overall friendly vibe I get from the place. The restaurant itself is in an awkward position hidden amongst clubs and bars and parking is incredibly hard to find as well. This is a nice place for a date since no one will bother you much and you won't have to overhear anyone's conversations but it's not a great family-styled restaurant.",-0.3265,0.832,0.081,0.087,0.5158906882591093

Tokyo tea was delicious.  They have a great drink menu and I'm looking forward to trying more the next time I come. Service was decent.  I was a bit shocked that we weren't checked in on more after our rolls had arrived.   Overall, a decent choice for sushi, however I'm not sure if I would frequent it regularly due to the location.  Weed Street definitely lacks ambiance.",0.9477,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.6228835978835979

The place was empty pretty much and we were her only customers so there was no excuse. She apologized and let us keep the shrimp tempura for free and put our real order in. I appreciated the free shrimp tempura but then I tasted it and realized it was worth the free value. The shrimp tempura was very soggy but the vegetables were good. Finally our real appetizers came out, my boyfriends food was very spicy and was nothing like the bartender described. My shrimp tempura roll didn't taste done and there wasn't much flavor.

2006-09-08,4.0,"I went to Tokyo 21 for the first time last night and wish I would have tried it out before!  The decor is super trendy and very cute which makes for a good drink atmosphere.  The drinks were really good- I especially enjoyed the sake sangria, and had a sip of my friends drink which was along the lines of a long island martini.  Both very good.  We only ordered a few of the sushi rolls, but the menu looked great- they had a variety of sushi as well as cooked items that sounded very good.  Next time I'll have to try more of their items but the rolls we had were great!",0.9863,0.726,0.274,0.0,0.6015686274509804
2006-08-16,4.0,"I've been here three times now and each time was better than the last.  It seems that they're really starting to work out the 'new-establishment' kinks.  Their sushi is good, but what is really amazing here are the specialty drinks.  They're a bit pricey but very inventive.  The raspberry-basil martini and the Tokyo Sunrise are two of my favorites.  The person that really impresses me in this place is the general manager.  He is more attentive of his diners than the waitstaff most of the time!  The atmosphere is fun and trendy, but not in that 'trendier-than-thou' kind of way.",0.9738,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.5547619047619049

This sushi thing is pretty new to me since I've only been eating it for a year, but I thought everything was delicious!  They had a great drink menu as well and I was very happy with the martini selction. For dessert they brought out the chocolate mousse and it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal.",0.9891,0.628,0.372,0.0,0.8893939393939393
2006-07-23,2.0,"I was so excited to try Tokyo 21 and was so disappointed. The menu looked fabulous and even my non sushi loving husband was excited. But it really fell short of expectations. Our food took forever to come out, and there were only 2 other tables besides us. But our server was nice and attentive. The sushi was only decent at best. The super white tuna was slightly more expensive than it is at other sushi joints, and it was a little chewy. We ordered the yakatori sampler and the shrimp was only lukewarm and lacked any real flavor.  I hope this place gets better but for now I wont be going back.",0.9135,0.819,0.16,0.021,0.6034722222222223
2006-07-02,4.0,"I checked out this place last night. Had no problem getting a tabe for 10:30, the place was close to full. At first we were largely ignored by the waitstaff, but then they realized we were there and from that point the service was very good. The food and drinks came out very quickly.   We had sushi and the fish was of pretty excellent quality. My favorite dish was a plate where they serve you six or seven handrolls which are unrolled. Essentially it's like having a piece of nigiri on top of a nori sheet that you roll up yourself. The presentation was really appealing and the ingredients high quality. We also throughly enjoyed the fire king maki which had chili hairs on it. Although the waitress warned us it might be spicy I didn't find it to be insane, just right.  We also got to sample some japanese ice tea with a kick (sort of like a long island but it has this melon feel to it). It was supposedly to make up for the wait but then we saw pretty much everyone around us get the same complementary treatment. Nontheless, it was a nice gesture, and pretty good tasting.    Definitely save room for desert at this place, as it's very very good. The apple tart was especially incredible, filled with some sort of green tea flavored cream, and having a variety of flavors that complimented it like lychees in mandarin sauce. We also really enjoyed the green tea cheese cake. The presentation was tasteful and beautiful. I would go to this place for the desert alone. Overall, good experience, if a bit pricy.",0.9971,0.709,0.241,0.051,0.5967436974789916
2006-06-27,4.0,"I first tried Tokyo 21 the first week it opened. I'm always a little nervous to try places the first week because they are just working out the kinks, but Tokyo 21 had their act together pretty early on.  It's owned by the same people at Kamehachi, but you would never know by the super trendy atmosphere and inviting bar area. I've been back at least many times since that first time and have enjoyed selections from their interesting menu.  Although the sushi is great, I recommend trying some of their other appetizers/entrees as well,  such as the pizza. The sushi tastes very fresh and the rolls are a perfect size (large, but not monstrous)...the sunrise roll continues to be my favorite.  Their desserts are incredible as well, especially the chocolate mousse for those with a sweet tooth.",0.9948,0.693,0.299,0.008,0.5671428571428572
2006-06-26,3.0,"I checked out the new Toyko 21 this past weekend. I expected sophistication and trendiness, knowing it was owned by the people from Sangria, Cabaret & Jet, as well as chefs from Kamahachi. The decor is nice and trendy as I expected... but it didn't exactly match from the bar into the restauraunt. But, it is a cool atmosphere. I also expected a bit ""trendier"" and ""younger"" of a crowd for a Friday night @ 8:30. However, I was pleased with the interesting ""asian fusion"" selections on the menu... everything from chicken or shrimp skewers to tacos to pizza (!?) and the regular sushi picks. My friends didn't love the sushi, but they weren't complaining either. The food is a bit pricy for the portions compared to other places. The drink menu had some nice selections - I ordered an Asian Mojito, and it was light, refreshing and very tasty. I guess if you're looking for something new and trendy on the asian/sushi bar scene in the city, Toyko 21 is worth checking out with a group of friends. But like a lot of places, it doesn't quite live up to the hoopla and hype you read about.",0.9779,0.819,0.158,0.022,0.5061928456159225
