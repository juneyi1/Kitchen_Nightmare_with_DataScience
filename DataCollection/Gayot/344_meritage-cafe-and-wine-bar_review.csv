It was hard to tell because it was dark and I had never seen this stuff before. But I blindly ate it, and was blown away by everything.  They brought us out some complimentary hors d'oeveurs which were good, and after dinner a complimentary orange sorbet ice cream made with Tabasco sauce.

Served on a fried green tomato with remoulade, this was fabulous and I could definitely eat another right now if I had one.  Two friends had the butternut squash soup and the other friend had a risotto.  Everything tasted really good.  Two shared some chocolate peanut butter dessert, which was gone in a heartbeat while I was excused from the table, and the other had a vanilla pear creme brulee which was also deliciously decadently creamy goodness.  The server was upbeat and friendly, and the food came pretty quickly.  And of course, the company was awesome (but that is due to Yelpness, not the restaurant) :) I am looking forward to the owners' new incarnation of this place next year.",0.9964,0.734,0.254,0.012,0.5878148366784731

Here's the catch: the steak.  It was supposedly Kobe beef and cooked medium rare.  The temp was fine and the portion was generous for the price.   BUT, the steak itself was among the worst I've had in the city.  It was fatty, tough and entirely unimpressive.  I had to saw through both pieces, trying to remove fat and obtain a decent bite.  It was not easy.  I left more than I ate. The potatoes were fine, the eggs were fine; there wasn't much crab to be found but it was fine.  Service was fine but there really weren't too many people there so it should've been.

The garden seating was open with the lamp heaters on full blast, everyone was buzzed and having a great time. Except us. Because they ran out of bread. And ran out of steamed mussels. I asked if there are any carbs available at all, we were brought crackers. Not fries, not a glass of muscat, but crackers. For the fromage we don't have. No biggie right? Because our first course arrived promptly.  The majority of the menu, I was told, was revived from the original menu 10 years ago. The duck banh cuon we were served surely was innovative 10 years ago. But now, it's just a poorly wrapped Vietnamese style spring roll with trite sauces, possibly even worse than the spring rolls found at Spring. You could do better on Argyle for 30% of the value.

Still, Meritage I decided has a bit of an identity crisis.  Mainly it is a wine bar.  The wine is OUTSTANDING - selection, price everything.  But (please reference the title) Meritage is also a ""cafe"" which means there are white table clothes, etc.   To start, the atmosphere here is great - money date spot.  As for service, I would give it an apathetic 3 stars.  There were times when my glass was empty which is weird because it felt like there were too many wait staffers jammed in there.  The entrees are PRICEY.  And I would not feel comfortable ordering just some smaller items (like soups and salad) - it's a starter and entree or bust here.  With wine, I usually like smaller plates - something more tapa-esque.  I ordered the onion soup to start.  In all honesty, it disturbed me.  The bowl was HUGE and there was a big slice of bread floating in it.  Kind of odd and a little too heavy for a soup starter.  My friend got the tart appetizer that was good.  For an entree I had the pork loin.  It was tasty but a little overcooked. Also ordered that night: the duck (so-so) and a skate fish dish (very good), ravioli (small portions, too much blue cheese).  I know it sounds picky, but when I'm shelling out the hard cash, I expect stellar food.

2006-11-25,5.0,"I recently went to Meritage for the first time for an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend.  We were both blown away by the quality of the food, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a nice restaurant/wine bar.   The inclusion of ""wine bar"" in the restaurant's name is a little deceptive--this is not a place like Cru Cafe or the Tasting Room.  The emphasis is definitely on the food, though they have an excellent selection of wine as well.  A word of warning to European wine aficionados: their wine list is almost entirely domestic (except for sparking whites).  Cocktails from their bar were excellent.  Here's how I would break down my experience there: The Good-- Food: Absolutely excellent.  Each dish was complex and flavorful.  I highly recommend the spare rib appetizer and the pomegranate waffle dessert.  I had an elk special which was fantastic with none of the gaminess elk can sometimes have. Drinks:  Cocktails were well balanced and perfectly mixed. Atmosphere:  The back room was perfect for a romantic dinner.  The front room looked a little crowded and loud, however.  I'd suggest requesting the back room with a reservation.  The Bad-- Not really too much to complain about here.  The prices are fairly high (eg, $32 for probably 6-8oz of Elk), but that comes with the territory.  The So-so-- Service:  Our waitress seemed pretty disinterested.  When asked for wine recommendations, she simply pointed us to which side of the menu the wine list was on.  She also tried to rush us into ordering our main dishes, stopping by every couple of minutes.  She might have been the exception rather than the rule, however.  The host and the rest of the staff were very good.   Lighting and music:  The lighting was just a touch too dark for my taste.  There was a live jazz duo in the front room, but the back room got unremarkable lounge music classics.  The bottom line is that any complaints about Meritage take a back seat to the absolutely fantastic food and drinks.  This has become my go-to restaurant for special occasions.",0.9852,0.847,0.124,0.028,0.5005847953216374

The worst part of the evening was that the room was freezing because there was a huge gust of cold air everytime someone opened the door.",-0.432,0.786,0.094,0.119,0.6825

2005-12-17,3.0,"Attended a recruitment dinner here with open bar and prix fixe menu.  Wines served with the open bar were unremarkable, although I tasted a nice French martini.  Tasted two interesting appetizers: a grilled vegetable tian, tasty but nothing to write home about, and a duck confit springroll which was fairly good.  The next course was a salad of mixed greens with blue cheese crumbles; Admittedly very generous with the blue cheese, however no one at the table was a fan of blue cheese (blame our unrefined palates). The monkfish with brussel sprouts, fingerling potatos and crisped slices of serrano ham was done fairly well, although I foud the fish somewhat bland.  I did not understand the ""crunchy"" dry pieces of serrano ham which were like salty chips.  I suppose the most unfortunate part of the meal was finding an 8-inch long blonde hair with the last bite of my fish (having to discover it in one's mouth is decidedly worse than seeing it on the plate).  Maybe this is why the dining room is so dark.  I understand it may make for a more romantic atmosphere, but the wonderful colors and presentation of the meal were very much lost (we had a single candle on our side of the table to provide light).  The desserts were presented in poor fashion.  It was noted as Chef's Choice meaning a plate containing three selections was placed at each end of the table as well as a creme brulee plate, and diners were then supplied with a big spoon and told to ""dig in.""  Now this may have been fun with a group of friends, but communal dining off one plate with a table of strangers you just met takes another form of bravery in hygiene (remember I just recently reeled somebody else's 8-inch hair out of my mouth).  Nonetheless it was nice to be able to taste a selection of the desserts available at Meritage.  Amongst all the tables in the room, the goat cheese and huckleberry tart was universally disdained; It was, for lack of a better description, both stinky and sour at the same time.  The hazelnut creme brulee, a chocolate layered cake and chocolate soft cake with ice cream were decent.  Espresso Pots de Creme & Caramelized Bananas & Macadamias in Puff Pastry were notable.  A mysterious polenta-like sweet cake was somewhat salty and ""cornbread-like"" - reminiscent of a dense cakelike dessert found in some Indian restaurants.  Service was mediocre, although the ""water guy"" was very attentive.  Kitchen took a lifetime to serve up each course.",0.986,0.819,0.125,0.056,0.4678926038500507
2005-08-22,5.0,"A cozy storefront setting, plus a terrace for warm weather dining, lures locals to this popular Bucktown dining spot, and the food keeps them coming back. The Northwest-inspired dishes include fresh seafood treated to wood-smoke techniques, and seared quail breast with duck confit and fresh thyme au jus, accompanied by herbed mashed potatoes. Spinach salad is topped with a confetti of grilled apples, carrots, and red onions in an apple-smoked bacon vinaigrette. An impressive wine list features a number of meritage varieties that give the restaurant its name.",0.9072,0.845,0.155,0.0,0.53125
