2015-03-26,2.0,"I wanted to love Berrista. I wanted to love it so much I tried it twice. Both times it fell flat. I am a huge Homaru Cantu fangirl and nearly cried myself to sleep at the closing of iNG. Then came Berrista. It was supposed to change the world of coffee and breakfast items by incorporating miracle berries into the meal. Pop a pill, berry, ice cube or vial of the magical stuff and it would make much healthier, sugar-free items taste like their indulgent sexier sisters. But alas, it doesn't do it. I don't know why, I don't know how, I don't know what the deal is. I've tried every type of miracle berry offered - the ice cube, the berry itself, the vial, the pill...and nothing, nada, nope - just doesn't do much for the food. Berrista Coffee is a cute coffee shop with a way modern feel to it. Food & drink options are on the board and they have a frequent visitor card which I love. What is sad is the people are not telling guests about the miracle berries and how they can make a difference in the food. Customers may buy a donut not understanding the lack of flavor and that it needs the berry's magical juices to give it any type of substance. The people working are lovely but clients need some instruction. I knew what I was doing going in there so I was one leg up on other customers. Over the course of my couple visits I tried tons of items: +Chicken and Waffle Sandwich - This is my favorite option they offer and the only one I saw some difference in pre & post miracle berry. The sauce does taste more like maple syrup after eating the berry. Even without it though, I thought the sandwich was quite tasty and enjoyed the moist tasty chicken. Of course not the best chicken & waffle sandwich but I liked it enough to get it on my second visit to the shop. +Sausage & Cheddar Quiche - Best of the quiches but honestly no real difference before & after the berry. Even without it though I liked this very much. +Ham & Cheese Quiche - Quiches seem to be one of their main things here and they all tasted just A-OK with & without the berry although no real change. +Spinach Quiche - Least favorite of the quiches but still completely fine. +Bacon Grilled Cheese Sandwich - Another good not amazing sandwich. Zero difference after the miracle berry though. +Chocolate Mint MIni Donut - Sounded absolutely delicious! Tasted totally horrible. Both before and after the berry! Sigh. If this was a normal cafe, I would go three stars on my review, but the entire point of Berrista is the miracle berry and how it will improve the food. When I have foods and they taste no different...it just leaves me confused. I've done miracle berry dinners at iNG, as well as tastings of my own at home so I know how they normally can make a huge difference in foods. I was sad to see it not being well showcased here. All that being said, I'm going to keep on loving HC and I'd even venture to try Berrista again.

2015-02-07,2.0,"Woah--there's nothing more disappointing than spending your Saturday afternoon finding out that one of the ""hot new places"" is a total dud.  Enter: Berrista.  My wife and I just drove 20 minutes to try this place after seeing it on a few ""best new places"" lists. We love Saturday afternoon coffee dates, and this seemed like a good spot for it.  We walked in and saw 2 other customers, seated together, and 5 employees behind the counter. We weren't greeted and it took several minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the register.  We were happy, however, to see their pastry selection--all 6 or 7 options--was still fully stocked late in the day.  We also noticed the miracle berry display by the register. It's not everyday that you find miracle berries at a coffee shop/bakery. So, we were intrigued. Unfortunately, when a guy finally did approach us to take our order, he didn't even try to explain anything about the cafe's philosophy (which, I think, is to serve less sweetened sweets and miracle berries to assist in the flavor). We had to ask a ton of questions (what are the miracle berries for? what would you recommend ordering with them? etc.) and he never gave any helpful answers. We were left to fend for ourselves. So, we ordered a couple of pastries, a couple of hot beverages, the ""carbonated fruit,"" and a miracle berry cube. We were the only people with an outstanding order. Yet, it took 15 minutes to get our food and coffee--and the pastries were already cooked! Everything is served in to-go containers/cups. They never asked if we were staying, and no one ate on actual plates while we were there. They used HUGE paper pastry boxes for one pastry--pretty wasteful. Also, after all that time, our order was wrong. For what it's worth, we saw another couple who had an order mix-up, too. It wasn't just us. They also never gave us a glass of water, which we asked for, nicely, several times.  The food was the biggest disappointment, though. The blueberry turnover was good. The doughnut was pretty terrible--dry and tasteless. (And that was AFTER I'd eaten the miracle berry cube, which was supposed to intensify the flavor.)  The carbonated grapes were cool, but you got like 12 grapes for $3.00. And, again, there was no guidance on how to approach any of the more unusual options. My wife didn't do the miracle berry cube, and I kept asking her, ""Does this stuff taste good to YOU?!"" I thought, for sure, that something was wrong. The drinks were really the worst part of it all. My wife got the ""indoor mint"" mocha, which is from the mint they grow inside of the coffee shop. I got a dirty chai. Both were so watered down and bland that we threw them away. They really were flavorless.  I wish I could've experienced the Berrista that so many Yelp-ers seem to be experiencing, but I didn't. Maybe I need another miracle berry--or twenty--to like their offerings, but I won't bother making the trip out there again to find out.",0.9904,0.815,0.134,0.052,0.5986275801493192

We waited in line with our two young children for over 10 minutes on a Saturday morning; and after those 10 minutes, we were no closer to the front of the line.  It literally did not move for reasons that are completely incomprehensible to me.  We saw lots of frustrated customers waiting around for an unreasonable length of time for their coffee or baked goods, as well as stressed out families who couldn't sit together because most of the tables are for two.  Our children were far too hungry for us to stay and deal with both the wait time and the logistics of the seating area, so we just gave up and walked next door to the pancake house.   The employees working behind the counter seemed to have no clue what they were doing. They looked disoriented and overwhelmed as they raced back and forth trying to get a handle on things. I don't know if the problems were due to poor staffing or poor training, but I really hope the situation improves because we need a place like this in the neighborhood.  We will go back to give it another try, and I will update this review if it turns out this was just an off day.

I got the spinach quiche ($6.50), which was absolutely yummy and filling. My friends both chose the panini cristo ($7.50) and gave me a bite. This was fabulous. It came with a little cup of raspberry (or maybe miracle berry?) dipping sauce. After eating, I got a glass of water with lemons in it. This didn't taste how I expected, it was sweeter...that's the miracle berry doin' it's thing. (Maybe it needed some time to kick in.) Atmosphere: Friendly, inviting, clean.

2015-01-19,4.0,"""Flavor-tripping"", but maybe more of a flavor-hiccup. Concept is fairly simple: cafe that uses miracle berry (a compound that block acid receptors on your tongue so that acid/bitter tastes sweet. Think lemons into lemonade, no sugar necessary). They add an additional sell that they can minimize the sugar in their pastries and soda for diabetics. The very bright and knowledgeable 'berrista' explained that it was really for their pastries and soda - they have good coffee, with the usual selection of sugar, splenda and dairy, and sandwiches as well. The pastries and sodas are sweetened with pineapple extract and taste fine on their own - the miracle berry ups the sweet factor. Miracle berry comes in tablet, cube, berry and droplet form ranging from $0.30 and up depending on the duration. They are often out of the shortest and cheapest $0.30 tablets (which are actually purchasable on amazon), so we went with the cube, which felt like a tiny maybe acai flavored popsicle, rubbed it to coat our tongues, and waited 30sec for the effect to kick in. You will notice their pastries are all somewhat citrus/berry flavored to allow this conversion of acid to sweet (orange chocolate donut, raspberry coffee cake, blueberry or raisin scones). They are tasty on their own, true to form, and the raspberry coffee cake had the most drastic change to sweet with the miracle berry. For some, this might make it to sweet. We tried both their mint lemonade and honey lavendar lemonade as well, the first which is fairly self explanatory and the latter which is a surprisingly rich drink with a deep dark honey flavor and a pleasant but strong lavendar note. Both definitely convert sweeter with the tablet. I also had some coffee, and given the acidity of the drink, expected a taste change but noticed minimal. They also had carbonated grapes, fruit sealed in carbonated bottles to take on some of the CO2 and I'd argue thus H2CO3 when it necessarily reacts in the grape, thus adding a acidic layer that converts well with the miracle berry, more so than the natural acidity of the grape. My chemist compadre did not agree, but taste don't lie! Well, with miracle berry it does! Overall a novel and pleasant experience. Do not see myself jonesing for a miracle berry fix, and given that they use pineapple extract and clearly flour for their pastries, I'm relatively certain the carbohydrate load is inappropriate for diabetics, etc and not exactly the ""no sugar added"" as advertised. Would however, highly recommend to everyone to try at least once either here or via Amazon tablets. Pros: novel concept, good coffee with all the fixings (almond, soy, skim, and on!), excellent staff, overall solid tasting pastries (did not personally taste the sandwiches, but seemed well recieved by others in my party). Cons: run out of miracle tablets (leaving only cubes etc), unable to taste plain fruit which I'd say is the most impressive conversion (having done this at home with grapefruit and limes), not exactly ""no sugar added""  Other: street parking, best landmark is right next to the golden nugget, casual environment with default to-go boxes even if you stay",0.9994,0.718,0.251,0.031,0.5366040100250626

They have all the bells and whistles when it comes to coffee and some delicious donuts but their actual food menu is small. The chicken and waffles sandwich was good but not the best chicken and waffles I've had. Why was there lettuce on it?  I can't say enough about the donuts. For $1.00 a piece, you can't beat it.  I fully support the no refined sugar movement. I love the fresh spices growing before your very eyes. For what this cafe lacks in atmosphere, it makes up for in heart.  Sadly, the service leaves something the be desired. They are friendly enough and greet you immediately with a smile but most of the staff is dough-eyed giggly teenagers who are thinking about their cute new crush and not their customer who is in a rush... They also lack enthusiasm for the product. They didn't really display any more enthusiasm for the food than they would have displayed for the newest Hunger Games movie. I hoped to see some adult foodies behind the counter. Someone with some knowledge of food culture etc... Maybe even Homaru himself from time to time. We've been 3 times and will return.",0.9922,0.728,0.206,0.065,0.5271814123376624
2015-01-02,4.0,"It's a nice and necessary addition to the Irving Park neighborhood, especially when it's conveniently located within two (2)-minute walking distance west to the Irving Park Metra Station and CTA Irving Park Blue Line.   The price points are fair, expecting to pay $2 to $3 for drip coffee and $4 to $4.50 for gourmet coffee, like some places in the city.  However, their pastries were made in house and were delicious!  I ordered the raisin scone ($3.00) and the blueberry turnover ($3.50).  The sizes were quite large and they were made just right and fresh.   I also ordered the chai tea latte.  The intelligentsia chai tea latte is on the sweeter side, so if ""sweet"" on the coffee is your cup of tea, you will enjoy it.  I personally prefer more tart than sweet, so I thought it was just alright.   Everyone, from the owner to the cashier, was very friendly and welcoming.  They also offer panini and other gourmet sandwiches.  However, it was under the crunch of time trying to get to work, so I will come back at another time to try different items on the menu.   Did I mention that I'm a big supporter for local businesses?  Yeah, I've made it clear many times on my other reviews.  I hope this place thrives and prospers, since sustaining a small business in city of Chicago can potentially be tough.",0.9886,0.822,0.166,0.012,0.5184981684981685
2015-01-02,4.0,"Really great food and coffee at Berrista! Excited for a great Irving Park option. Will definitely be back. My only complaint is that everything you order comes in disposable containers, even when you stay and eat.

2014-12-29,5.0,"Really excited to get an independent cafe with fantastic coffee (and food!) selections in the Old Irving Park neighborhood! I tried the Steampunk coffee press coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee snob, so this made me very happy and the coffee was delicious. I only wish they had non dairy options (for non espresso drinks) in the coffee condiment area.  I also bought a sugar-free blueberry turnover that I ate after taking a miracle berry tablet. I don't know what it would have tasted without the tablet, but it tasted like a turnover should. It was flakey and fruity with the right amount of sweetness. The baked goods are smaller than you are probably used to seeing, but they are ""normal"" sized portions. We're just accustomed to all of our foods being super sized.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. They explained how to use the miracle berry and even offered to give me a lemon to try after taking the berry. The berry only works with certain foods and really hot liquids (like coffee) will dull the effect. I recommend that you wait to take the miracle berry until after you try the food, so that you can compare the flavors before and after.",0.9933,0.756,0.22,0.024,0.6811755952380951

In an area in need of more independent coffee shops and restaurants it is certainly welcomed! Great atmosphere, with produce growing before your eyes, very good food and polite and friendly service.  Monticristo sandwich was great, and miracle berry dip did add a very refreshing taste.",0.9901,0.543,0.422,0.035,0.5965317460317461
2014-12-26,5.0,"When my boyfriend said that a new coffee shop opened in Old Irving Park, I was pretty excited! We stopped by to check it out the day that it opened. Both of us couldn't wait to test out the Miracle Berry. To be honest, I was a little skeptical and didn't think that it actually works. Sure enough, it made my slightly acidic maple syrup (that came with the chicken and waffle sandwich) taste sweet...without having to add any sugar!  The mint mocha coffee was the bomb and is the perfect drink for lovers of flavored coffee.  I also loved that they had fresh herbs growing behind the counter and that you could see the workers make the pastries right in front of the customers. This place is a neighborhood gem and I can't wait to go back and try the Miracle Berry again!",0.988,0.743,0.234,0.024,0.5803230719897388

2014-12-16,4.0,"Rarely do I get excited over coffee shops but I was looking forward to a high profile new concept coming to an area like Irving Park. This place would be a smash in a hipster yuppie area like Wicker or Logan Square but I'm not too sure how receptive it will be in an area with lower traffic and people less reckless with their money. Went on a Monday after work and the restaurant was deserted. Space seems like it could be a little cluttered with large crowds, not much of a flow to the restaurant.  I tried the chicken and waffle sandwich. It took almost 10 minutes to get my food but since they make everything to order I have no problem with that. The sandwich was better than I expected. A little small for it's price(quarter of a waffle sized), but it was fresh and had a lit of flavor. Also got a sugar free blueberry croissant. Was surprisingly edible to be healthy. Didn't try it with a miracle berry though. I look forward to coming back and exploring their menu more and pairing their pastries with the miracle berry. I'm interested in seeing if this place sticks around. The area dies down after 6pm, there isn't much foot traffic and since it's right next to the expressway parking is a bish. I hope it does, as besides Smoque there isn't many high profile options in Irving Park.",0.9874,0.767,0.177,0.056,0.4756768745657635
2014-12-16,5.0,"Berrista has the potential to revolutionize not just coffee shops, but how we feel about consuming sweets. The latest venue from Chef Homaro Cantu (owner of the futuristic, Michelin starred Moto)  features healthy junk food. Thanks to the use of the Miracle Berry (a naturally occurring berry that temporarily tricks one's taste buds into perceiving sour as sweet) sodas, donuts, scones even maple syrup looks and taste just like the real deal but is actually sugar free (and without any artificial sweeteners). One can wolf down a couple of donuts, a slice of coffee cake and chase it down with a soda without ruining one's diet (since there is no sugar the calories of the pastries and beverages are a fraction of the norm). Truly guilt free indulgence.  Of course if the pastries and sodas taste fake this is just a gimmick and all smoke and mirrors; so far I have made two visits and am extremely impressed with the flavor - this is the real deal. During my first visit I tried the chicken and waffle sandwich; this was sweetened with a sugar free maple syrup and honestly if I had been served this in a regular restaurant I would have never known it was sugar free. The sandwich was absolutely fantastic. During the second visit I enjoyed an order of mini chocolate donuts and a blueberry scone. The donuts tasted great and were very flavorful but the texture was just a  bit more chewy than typical for a donut. The scone really wowed me; one of the better scones I have consumed and both taste and texture were spot on; again if I had been served this in a typical pastry shop I would have never suspected it was sugar free. The food was all at least as good as what you would find at a Starbucks, priced about the same, but much less calories and no sugar. It would really be interesting to see how the loaded-with-sugar pastry at Starbucks would fare against the pastry from Berrista in a blind taste test; I am guessing that scone might score higher than anything from Starbucks.  The pastries are supplemented by a thoughtful menu of sandwiches and a couple of flatbreads (I did not try these yet, but saw several people ordering them and they looked amazing - definitely need to get back to Berrista soon for a one of these). My chicken and waffle sandwich was so delicious though that it will be hard to resist ordering that again. Of course what is a coffee shop without a great cup of Joe? This is another area where Berrista excels; several top of the line coffees to choose from such as La Colombe, Big Shoulders, BowTruss and Intelligentsia. Both coffees I tried were perfect.  The space at Berrista was completely renovated prior to the opening and is beautiful, comfortable and well laid out. The equipment is cutting edge and they even have a garden where they grow ingredients that are used in the cuisine (doesn't get any fresher than that)! Top this off with reasonable prices, great management and extremely friendly, competent staff and you have yourself one fantastic venue. Berrista was bustling during my two visits and really fills a niche. I foresee several trips to Berrista in the near future and am optimistic that they will be a smashing success; I am eager for one to open in my neighborhood!",0.9995,0.712,0.258,0.031,0.5226986601986602
2014-12-12,5.0,"Dude. My new fave hangout. Happy to have this new addition to the Old Irving Park.  Homar, the eccentric owner, chef, and friend, had me add fresh donuts. Love the the progressive concept that is a mix of a coffee shop, smoothie shop, soda stand, and bakery. Add paninis and other seasonal goods and it's an all occasion eatery. And did I mention that he doesn't use sugar? Only miracle berries baby. These berries are wonderful to trick ur mind to think that what you eating has sugar. Awesome.  Today I had a panini with manchego cheese and ham with fresh basil (from the in house garden), grilled cheese w/onions and bacon, chocolate donuts, and jasmine tea. Whoa!  Enough for today. I'll have to come back tomorrow for more. And you should too!",0.9843,0.787,0.205,0.008,0.5722727272727273
2014-12-12,5.0,"I've been eagerly awaiting Berrista's opening for a year and it finally opened today (12/12/14.) Coffee and pastries are the specialties of the house, but I really enjoyed the panini grilled Serrano Ham, Basil and Manchego cheese sandwich (probably the first ham and cheese sandwich I have ever actually liked!) The small sandwich and flatbread menu is very intriguing--everything from a fried chicken and waffle sandwich to a portabello flatbread and I plan on trying everything. A miracle berry soda accompanied my meal, and managed to be as sweet as a soft drink without the sugar. The blueberry scone I had for desert was the best I have ever had. The fit and finish of the place is also excellent--and they actually grow fresh herbs for their food in their lighted, hydroponic countertops!",0.9841,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.5217948717948717
2014-12-06,5.0,"Welcome to the neighborhood!  Went in for the soft opening today and we were greeted by Homaro and the team. I have to admit we've been anxiously waiting for this one for a while, so we showed up just after they opened the doors- and it was pretty packed by the time we left. Word travels fast.  I went for some of their ""steampunk"" style coffee, of which there were four types to choose from, one roast from Intellegentsia, one from Bowtruss, one from Big Shoulders and one from La Columbe. A nice variety. The steampunk is some form of single serving method, though I didn't get a chance to watch how they actually do it. A good deal for some great roasts at $3 for a medium-ish size. They also have regular drip for 2 or 3 roasts for $2.50. I had the Ugandan from big Shoulders and it was delish. Wife got the Mint Mocha which was also pretty yummy.  Homaro was sampling some of the miracle berry when we were there. We'd had it once before at ING in powdered form, but cool that they had the actual berry. Not sure how they're going to distribute it with meals and such once they open, so I can't quite evaluate the berry execution yet.  The menu was nicely diverse- including sandwiches, a couple flatbreads and several pastries (and $1 doughnuts! but they didn't have them yet on the first day.) We went for sandwiches, so our pastry evaluation is TBD, though as I understand the miracle berry plays into those pretty strongly. We ordered one chicken and waffle sandwich and one of the panini cristos. Both were excellent, though took some time getting out. But it's a soft open, so I'll let that go. The chicken in the waffle was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with the right level of crispness. The cristo wasn't quite as warm as we would have liked, but they were having a bit of trouble getting the chicken out for the other sandwich because of the fryer so it had to sit a minute. Still delicious though.  Overall, two thumbs up and we can't wait to try out more on the menu. Glad to see this new addition to the hood getting rolling and we hope for more to come!",0.9966,0.801,0.178,0.02,0.6037680020238159
