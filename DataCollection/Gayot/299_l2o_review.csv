2015-03-24,5.0,"Ive owed this review for a while now. It's hard to see that L2O us is no longer as Matt Kirkley and Dan Page have had a team of excellence. After a full day of eating and drinking already it was the pinnacle to end up in the calm spaces of L2O's large and serene dining room. What the hell let's do a tasting menu to end the day! the onslaught went as follows: -Mussel Tart, Lemon Parsley -Tuna Marrow, Lime -Langoustine, Osetra Caviar, Cauliflower, Poppyseed, Meyer Lemon -Nootka Sound Oyster, Green Apple, Noilly Prat, Celery -Crab Chip, Old Bay -Maine Lobsterm Foie Gras Torchon, Turnop, Clementine Vinaigrette -Ahi Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Caviar -Crispy Bass, Escargot, Pearl Onion, Chartreuse Butter -Turbot, Grilled Squid, Guanciale, Scallion -Stuffed Quail, Sunchoke, Smoked Cherry, 23-Flavor-Gastrique -Meyer Lemon, Champagne -Lime Parfait, Avocado, Tarragon, Cara Cara Orange -Chocolate Cremeux, Lemon Curd, Brioche, Olive Oil Fantastic all around. Now Ive had Laurent Gras' cooking in it's previous incarnation too. While that was decidedly Japanese in influence, Chef Kirkley is very worldly in his European and American flavors intermingled. During the Crab Chip dish it was paired with PBR! What's more whimsical and American than that? It's cool to see that with the excellent cuisine, the service matches and doesnt always take it totally serious. It will be highly missed Now that the concept has changed to Intro, I wish the former team that's stayed on the best and hope they succeed in that realm moving forward",0.9753,0.823,0.132,0.045,0.39972049689440997
2014-12-29,4.0,"My husband found out L2O was closing and decided we HAD to try it. I was kind of concerned when we arrived because I was SUPER RIDICULOUSLY EMBARRASSINGLY underdressed, but no one made a big deal out of it and the staff was all great anyway. But, the important part: the food. I eat seafood very occasionally and this menu was pretty much all seafood (except, thankfully, the desserts). They were very accommodating of my request to leave off any actual meat (only two items were affected- one contained ham and another bone marrow). All of the food was fantastically fresh and delicious. I think my favorite was the lobster with nori butter (ridiculous) and the ocean trout, which was just so fresh and delicious. There was also a flying fish served in a crab butter that I pretty much gobbled up with a spoon. My one complaint is that for the abalone course, my bone marrow was replaced with a (pretty tasty) risotto, but I didn't get any abalone. This seemed kind of odd to me, but whatever. The boxes of sweets at the end were adorable and seemingly never-ending. The service was consistently great except for one thing: the table next to us was offered an optional wine pairing when drink orders were taken, and we were not. I was really happy with the cocktails we drank throughout the meal, but if I'd known about the wine pairing, I would totally have done that instead. I am not at all knowledgeable enough about wine to order a bottle or even several glasses throughout my meal, but I would have really liked the opportunity to sample various wines. Oh well; I guess it saved us some money! It goes without saying that this was a pretty expensive meal, but I'm glad to have had the experience and the food was all really really good. Bonus: we got a ridiculous amount of Lettuce Entertain You points out of the experience, lol.",0.9978,0.697,0.243,0.06,0.6674145299145299
2014-12-16,4.0,"When you bring the world's most OCD person (myself) to one of the world's most OCD chef's, you are bound to elevate the standard both expect. L2O dazzled in its last weeks and I hope the chef stays on.  I could see that the staff, while trying very hard, had a glimmer in their eye, knowing in 2 weeks they would be out of work, but hurry, go see them before they are done. It is worth trying this place that used to be a 3 star, then was a 1 star, then got a Michelin star back. The blue tinge to the riedel glasses and the sky blue tones throughout the meal, a seafood exploration were a nice thematic narrative. The fish in the bathroom added to this theme, subtle, but present. The avocado/tuna tartare was plated too early so didn't have the fresh chill I'd tasted before at a food event. The lobster was nearly perfect. The wine pairings were very well done and the Sommelier was as good as they get. The desert bites were wonderful, and the pace of the meal was masterful, full but not stuffed, many surprises. The staff should pay attention to handedness. Several times, my glass on the left was moved to the right, as if to correct me.  I especially like that they kept bringing us more of the seafood and baguette rolls throughout the meals, so we didn't lose any of the amazing crab and butter sauces that they presented. The butter sculptures were an especially nice touch, and the concentric circle plate theme and flatware themes added more narrative elements to a meal that told a story and had strong thematic development, like a symphony. They make a great Sazerac here by the way. They coat the glass in a hint of absinthe first, which gives an anise flavor element to the drink. A real treat! I wish they'd have given us a few of the desert bites to take with -- they did give us a menu. When they first showed us the menu it was in a sort of suede paper holder. I wish they gave us that, that was one of the more awesome menu touches I'd ever seen. It gave ""texture"" to the experience. This place is a performance, and you will not be disappointed if you like art and the aesthetic. I hope whatever they become in the rebranding retains these OCD elements.",0.9979,0.794,0.189,0.016,0.4639136904761905
2014-12-07,3.0,"After finding out the restaurant would be closing/ reconcepting I wanted to check it out before it went. My boyfriend has been several times and agreed to go back.  They used to have an ala carte menu but have since switched over to only a tasting menu.  We went on a Monday night, it was pretty quiet and we were the only couple dinning for awhile. It is an experience. The servers we kind and polite. They knew how to describe the dishes. We carried on some small talk. I like to try and lighten the mood. I hate stiff and pretentious.  I liked the idea of an all seafood tasting menu. There were a few dishes that incorporated red meat. My boyfriend does not eat Pork and Beef etc. but did make an exception and enjoyed the little bits he tried. Some of the standouts were the Pomme Souffle, Ahi Tuna Tartar and Periwinkle. The cold dishes left me a bit unsatisfied. I would have liked more warmth. I was actually disappointed in the Lobster presentation. I would think this would be the highlight. My lobster was grisly, I did not finish it. On the other hand, the Galinette was pretty good with the crab butter. It was probably all the butter that I liked, however. I also did not feel full at the end like normal tasting menus. I am happy I was able to experience L2O but it was a one time experience for me.",0.9931,0.752,0.203,0.045,0.6028735632183908

He also offered me a free tasting of a 2004 french chardonnay. Amazing sommerlier, stellar service. The food was so bland and lack creativity.

If you think you're experienced and accomplished enough to actually critique this place - with anything other than trite ramblings - then you are sadly confused. I love a great tasting menu, but we elected to go prixe fixe. It was the first time in a while that we actually left a fine dining experience not feeling completely exhausted. We thought it was the perfect amount, perfect pace, perfect wine pairings. The service was sophisticated,  yet not pretentious. The dining space was beautiful, yet not stifling. The cuisine (taste and presentation) was innovative, yet not inaccessible. We had a lovely time. We'd return.

We were celebrating my birthday so they made the extra touch of printing the menu with my name on it, that was a nice, but not unique touch. We opted for the tasting menu which was $225 per person. The food was okay, but not Michelin star worthy by any means. The presentation was beautiful. They have very fancy ribbon shaved butter that was very nice, but unfortunately the bread they served was too hard and cold. The tasting menu was unremarkable, and left us feeling a sense of lacking. There were too few hot dishes in the menu. Maybe it's the carnivores in us missing the meat. We didn't leave hungry, just unsatisfied.

Even the bread has been pared down to two choices from a half dozen.  Most of the courses were delicious, esp the abalone, but too small to remember. Service was good as expected.

2014-08-22,1.0,"This easily goes down as the most disappointing meal of my life and the biggest flop.  I suspect part of it is the current menu, but to have even one menu this bad is really unacceptable at this price point and with two Michelin stars to defend. First, let me say that the service was impeccable and the decor very elegant.  They even have comfortable seats which you will need for the four hour tasting menu.  Also, while the actual courses were for the most part underwhelming, the bread service is fantastic.  The rosemary croissants deserve to be singled out for excellence, but pretty much everything was great.  Sadly, I don't go to restaurants to eat bread. It's hard to organize all the bad that went into the meal.  The progression of courses was awful.  It's a blob of cold dishes, followed by a few warm dishes (not even that warm) and then four desserts.  It was fatiguing eating that many cold dishes in a row and they were all pretty much horrible, but more on that later.  Somewhere about halfway salvation came in  a warm crab soup that was utterly revitalizing and the highlight of the meal.  Ironically, it is served with an icy granita, a wonderful contrast pairing in any other circumstance than one where you have already bludgeoned your diners over the head with cold dishes. Then we get more dishes that were lukewarm and then off to dessert which did nothing to relieve the temperature monotony.  On top of that was a similar textural monotony as nearly every dish has some sort of jelly, gelee, or whatever it is called.  Have you tried an iceberg jelly?  I assure you that you do not want to.  I felt like I was in a senior citizen home with all the mushy food being served.  I was dying to use my teeth for most of the meal, to eat something crispy or substantial.  For a seafood restaurant I didn't once even get a nicely cooked piece of fish. Did nobody in the kitchen step look at the meal as a whole or even try the entire progression and see it was a mess?  I can only conclude no because it was an egregious mistake that anyone should be able to spot.  However, I might forgive that if the individual dishes were good, but as you can probably tell, they were not.  The first half of the meal was a dud with a vaguely unpleasant seafood mousse and a bunch of jellies.  One dish was a deconstructed PB&J which tasted like separate balls of foie gras, brioche and something that tasted like Jello brand strawberry jelly.  It was bewildering and not particularly good despite the foie gras. As stated before, the highlight was the crab broth, but the warm section was in general superior with fewer jellies and a bit of texture.  Still not at all up to expectations but at least somewhat pleasing. Desserts started and I hoped that perhaps that with a different chef things would turn up, but sadly we were disappointed again.  It started with a panna cotta with (another) granita on top and then some coconut creme.  Everything was excellent individually, but the granita layer was a huge faux pas.  It, ironically for this meal, added texture where there shouldn't be.  I want to tasty the silky texture of the panna cotta and I certainly don't want the granita to immediately melt in my mouth and water down every bite. Even the pastry chef couldn't resist the gelatin, adding it to a cremeux so that he could squeeze it into an unappetizing rectangular prism.  Desserts were unimpressive despite often being a highlight at fine dining establishments.  I give them points for serving a solid macaron, but they lose points for an ugly tasting chocolate.  Strangely, the best sweet was the kouign amann they send home with you. It was an uncomfortably long meal with courses taking more than fifteen minutes at times to come out.  Obviously a long tasting meal will take awhile, but this is just excessive. Sorry for the long review, but a 500 dollar meal is worth a lot of words.  I cannot insist strongly enough to just spend nearly the equivalent amount on Alinea or even save some and hit Takashi or Mexique (my favorite one stars).  The fact that this place retains any stars is a stain on the prestige of the Michelin guide.",0.9952,0.736,0.161,0.104,0.6010818216175358

The cuisine here is impeccable.  We selected the four course prix-fixe and were not disappointed.  These dishes were predominantly avant garde in presentation, either deconstructed or elegantly over-constructed, but always delicious. We began with foie gras and tuna tartare.  The foie gras was in torchon form, and assembled as a brick, with layers of haricot verts, fois gras, and salad, sprinkled with truffle.  It was delicious.  The tuna tartare was sliced so thin as to be gelatinous, and melted in your mouth.  It was the finest tartare we had savored, and one of the highlights of the meal. I followed that with langoustine; Kelly had the Dover sole.  Both of these dishes were also bricked out, and elegantly constructed like architecture.  The langoustine had a creamy milky flavor and the sole was rich and buttery. For the main course, I had the lobster, Kelly had the ribeye.  These dishes were more traditionally presented.  The ribeye was a juicy red rare, full of concentrated flavor, and the lobster was rich, buttery, and decadently delicious. For dessert we both went with the chocolate cremeux.  The dish was delicious, of the finest chocolate.  Like many five star restaurants, desserts are an indulgence of the kitchen.  We also received a massive selection of petit fours, elegantly placed on a multi-tiered platform, as though they had all competed in an Olympian chocolate competition for our pleasure. What was lovely about eating here was that there was so much food, and yet you left satisfied but not stuffed.  This was true even including two amuse bouches prior to our first course. For drinks, we started with a delicious rose bubbly, and then a bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, a late nineties vintage from Clos du Mont Olivet.  It was a superb wine, and in fact the sommelier had only received 3 bottles at an auction; we arrived just in time for the last bottle.  So we had something you, dear reader, may never have.  In the wine's stead I can only send you my sincere, sincere apologies, for the wine was transcendent.   We finished off the dinner with coffee and some bourbon.  Service was excellent throughout, but we noticed that the room did not hold down sound as well as it might.  When we arrived the restaurant was quiet and subdued, but when we left, crowds were gathering, and a large party was seated in a ""semi-private"" dining space (emphasis on the ""semi"").  While not obnoxiously loud, we were surprised at the amount of ambient noise they generated.   But in the end, that is a minor quibble.  We would definitely consider L2o an excellent option to celebrate a special occasion.",0.9992,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.5974206349206348

2014-01-20,2.0,"Let me first start off by saying I have eaten at most of the highest rated Michelin rated restaurants in Chicago (Aliena, Everest, Spiaggia) and I have been impressed with all of them. The food was lacking at L2O. The service was amazing and the staff keeps a close eye on you without being super obvious. But service is only half of the story here. We go out to eat to have a good time with the folks we are with and except to have equally good food. The food was something to be desired. We ordered the 4 course price fix because we had an early appointment and couldn't spend 4 hours for the tasting menu. For our first course we had the ahi tuna tartare with avocado amd caviar. It wasn't what you would expect, it reminded me of Jello (and did have some sort of gelatinish layer on the top). This course eventually led my wife to be sick. The langoustine and dover sole were amazing.  I had the the rib eye. It was delicious and completely different from anything you would find at Chicago's wide selection of steakhouses. Props to the chef for giving a red-meat option.  The desert was a different story. We both had the chocolate crémeux, lemon curd, brioche, olive oil. It was not my favorite and after thinking about it I should have sent it back...having been to Europe many times it is customary to have a very unsweet desert to balance your meal. I think thats what L2O was going for however it wasn't a very good mix with olive oil and pure chocolate.  The drinks (mixed and wine parings were spot on and amazing). I would come back just for drinks...although expect to pay $17 a pop for a mixed drink and $75 for a wine pair for the 4 course meal. We won't be going back.",0.9536,0.883,0.085,0.032,0.5495714285714286

2014-01-04,2.0,"I'm rarely inclined to review restaurants, but the events leading up to my experience at L2O were extraordinary and deserve special mention. On a lark, I made a 5:15pm reservation at 12pm on New Year's Eve.  Within minutes, the other member of my party had an emergency and was unable to make that time.  I immediately called L2O and spoke to a helpless woman named Meredyth.  She needed approval from a guy named Dan before she could change the reservation.  A few minutes later she called to inform me that ""Dan"" has agreed to cancel the reservation, but if the reservation does not get filled, they will charge my credit card $200/person for the dinner.  So the resolution is to cancel my reservation but maintain the right to charge me for the meal?  I requested a call from the phantom boss, Dan, but he was too cowardly to speak.  The next resolution was to maintain the reservation, but allow it to be rebooked by someone else.  If it is booked, our reservation would be cancelled.  So now I have to wait around all day to find out whether I'll be FORCED to eat here? Did I mistakenly make a reservation at McDonald's?  Was Dan a new intern?  Having dined at numerous Michelin-star restaurants, I know what to expect in terms of service and hospitality.  This was McDonald's-quality hospitality at French Laundry-prices. In the end, we were ""forced"" to dine at L2O.  The attrocious taste in my mouth walking through the door was exacerbated by a greasy potato chip couched as an amuse-bouche.  The rest of the food  rebounded and, overall, we were satisfied with the food--but not for this price.   If you must do fine dining in Chicago, do it right and go to Alinea.  A moderate increase in price for an astronomical increase in quality.",0.736,0.823,0.098,0.079,0.4489022881880025

2013-12-29,2.0,"I realize L20 has a Michelin star and that everyone loves it.  I was personally very disappointed.  I have been to most of the upscale restaurants in the city and many across the country (Moto, Alinea, Tru, Everest, etc) and just felt that L20 did not deserve being rated in the same category. I went there about 8 months ago, so something may have changed in the past year.  My first issue with the restaurant is it's extremely odd placement within the lobby of an apartment building.  When we walked in (around 9pm on a Saturday night, toward the end of seating), there were several elderly people in the lobby on their way up to their private residence.  They seemed annoyed by our mere presence there and we felt unwelcome.  Immediately our night-out-on-the-town spirits were dampened. Next, we walked in, prepared to have a drink at the bar before being seated.  Well, there is no bar, at least not in the traditional sense.   There is a small dark waiting room where they escort you to sit.  If you want to order a drink, they bring in a drink cart.  Not the fun, social environment we expected. After waiting about 20 minutes in the lonely waiting room, we were escorted to our table.  The restaurant was not busy.  It was very, very quiet.  My friends and I (myself and 2 other ladies) were in a boisterous mood and I am not exaggerating when I say we received annoyed glances from the other tables because we were talking and laughing loudly.  We are perfectly capable of behaving ourselves in a fine dining establishment; we were not doing cartwheels, we were simply having a lively conversation.  The rest of the restaurant was practically silent.  The crowd is mostly businessmen and elderly couples, which I wouldn't even if noticed if we hadn't felt we were being a bit discriminated against ourselves, age-wise.  A  young, fun group in a restaurant on a Saturday night usually is par for the course... here, we felt as if we were doing something wrong, and one of my friends (who is very stylish and was wearing an expensive black cocktail dress) commented that one of the women at another table had given her the eye and made her feel as though she was dressed inappropriately.  Odd and uncomfortable atmosphere! As far as the food....  It is a gorgeous presentation, though the courses are very small, even for a tasting menu.  Some of the touches seemed quaint or old-fashioned, as if the chef had just popped in from the '70s.  There seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of sauced dots and foams on the plates.  The food itself was just good, not memorable, nothing particularly exciting or creative, just well presented, expensive food served at an extremely high price.  I found many of the courses to be under-seasoned and bland.  I think their approach may be that less is more.... but I expect an intensity of flavor from a high end restaurant with this sort of reputation, and I was underwhelmed. We left feeling a bit hungry, a bit bored, and annoyed, having each paid over $300 for a meal that was anything but festive.  Save yourself the trouble and go to Moto or Tru, or Sixteen, which at least has a view.  This place is truly not worth the hype, or the price.",0.9304,0.856,0.088,0.055,0.49998048399687745

We were equally disappointed.  The service was very good and attentive but lacked a personal touch. Seemed like they were doing everything because they had to not because they wanted to. Sometimes restaurants can get a little too stiff and take the pleasure out of the food experience. The wait time between dishes was a bit off. Sometimes the next dish almost came as we were taking the last bite of the previous and sometimes one could wait for what seemed for ever. The food was definitely interesting and more towards classic french upscale cuisine which is probably why Michelin rated it this well. However, the seafood sometimes did come out smelling a little bit which is for me a total turn off. There was also twice confusion with which table to serve what to so another table that came after us by accident got our dishes. The two highlights were the amazing bread and the very nice tour of the kitchen. The manager who gave us this tour was so friendly and engaged which is why I changed my rating from 3 to 4.",0.9886,0.789,0.175,0.036,0.5479545454545455

The atmosphere was quiet and about what I expected.  The restaurant was surprisingly slow.  The service was very attentive and the sommelier was not stuffy or snobby.   My date and I each did the four course option. Was it jaw dropping? Kinda... Damn expensive, though.    The amuse bouche was a wonderful clam with citrus and some other goodies.   The bread selection was great. There was a small roll with cubed bacon inside. Awesome!   I had a pasta dish with uni and caviar. The warm caviar was intensley flavored and the thinner-than-angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly.   The butter poached lobster mitts came out looking gorgeous, but they were very tough and flavor wise, pretty alright...  Her Scottish Salmon was a beautiful looking plate, but for some reason the salmon tasted ""off.""     I opted for the $40 upcharge for the A11 Waygu with a truffle pan sauce. It was beautiful, properly cooked and extremely underwhelming. The sauce was nice, but a 3-4 ounce piece of Waygu should be able to stand on it's own.   A Cointreau/orange Souffle was a little too sweet. The cheeses and accompaniments were very nice, however.  Two-four course meals, two half bottles of Northern Rhone (a nice Condrieu and Cote Roti) plus tip came out to about $600.

The waitstaff was very attentive and the sommelier was very accommodating to my preferences (although I would have preferred he stick with what complimented the courses as I had asked instead of trying to go back to the type of wines I liked).

I was not too thrilled that I had to put my credit card # down to hold the reservation but I understood that they probably need to prepare the ingredients.  I drove by this place but could not see the sign. Then the second round, I basically stopped on the street to ask the valet parking people (which I thought was for Mon Ami Gabi) for where was L2O. And bingo! They had a notepad with my name on it. They took my car and directed to inside. L2O has the huge and closed door which I wondered if I needed to knock first. I was welcome by last name and sat right way at a corner area in the elegant lobby. The twelve courses on the tasting menu were petite, fancy and very arty. Every thing was served with the unique dish or incredible containers. The first few dishes were raw and fishy seafood. I love raw seafood and enjoyed them extremely. My personal favorite one is the Oyster with green apple gel. Never thought those two would go together so nicely. In mini main course dishes, my favorite was a Duarade rose fish slice with crispy fish skin. The stuffed quail was served right before the 4 dessert courses so I was pretty much stuffed to finish the tender quail dish. Those course was very petite size but I was filled up towards the end. Out of four desert courses, I loved Chocolate Cremeux. Didn't care much of the puffs and strawberry yogurt one. The services were truly incredible. One of our guest was not a fan of raw fish so she took very little bites of first few courses so our waiter was asking if she needs anything else. Very nice observation. I had lots of questions on what were those food and how was it made. I didn't know Duarade rose was a fish instead of a flower or financier was a French mini cake. Then I had to translate those to my Chinese guests. Thank for the staff for their extremely patience. Our diner was about 4 hours. Oh, one of their restrooms has a fish tank. I wonder if people spend more time in there than necessary. :) It was a fantastic experience for me.

And everybody was nice.  The ambience is very nice, and we were seated in a couch like table, so we could look out on the other guests and the restaurant.  We told them it was our anniversary, so we received special menus commemorating it, with our names and dates, etc.  They also saved our wine label for us.   As to the food, I thought it was all really good-I tried to go in with an open mind because otherwise I would be afraid to try a lot of it.  Some of my favorites--the dessert and candies at the end...very nice touch!  The lobster we had was incredible, with the potatoes, and some avocado dish was great, too.

2013-03-02,5.0,"I have never seen so much pomp and circumstance at a restaurant. Dining here is interactive performance art. Fourteen courses presented and whisked away with relentless precision over the span of three hours and two bottles of wine. The meal was not without hiccoughs, but it really was like having dinner and a show, and I was with two friends who also love food, so the lively conversation helped set the mood. The staff was polite to a fault and everything about the service here exuded style and distinction. The wait staff was knowledgeable about everything on the menu and they were very friendly and helpful in explaining some of the dishes. The staff was silent and somber, until we started asking about the courses. Then they were pleased to give a warm, informative response to every question we had about the food. There was never any hovering around our table, but the second we needed something at the table, one of the staff members would pop up out of the woodwork to fulfill our needs (get your mind out of the gutter). My friends and I did find amusement in the pretentiousness of the presentation, though. If you want your meal to be SERIOUS BUSINESS, the staff will accommodate. The sommelier was also fantastic. He knew loads about the French White Wines on the menu (something I have no experience with) and was happy to share. The wine list was extensive. The most impressive thing, though, particularly at a fine restaurant, was that when I mentioned that a bottle he suggested was rather spendy, this gentleman didn't bat an eyelash and recommended what turned out to be a wonderful bottle of white Bordeaux that was at the lowest price point on the wine list. He even jotted down the name of the wine on a card (with envelope) for me to take home. The food was impressive. That's not to say I loved every bite that was put before me, in fact, there were a couple of things I detested, but I ate them anyway because that's what a tasting menu is all about. No doubt that a lot of care and effort was put into each and every course. My impression on reading the menu was that the chef had went to the ends of the earth to include just about every type of critter in the sea. I don't think I've ever seen such a broad variety of seafood in one place, much less in one meal. The kitchen is obviously working hard to expand the boundaries of what can be done with shellfish cookery. I'll spare the menu details, since I'm certain that the menu has changed since I dined here. I will go so far as to say that the presentation of ingredients in every course was new and unexpected, and that is impressive in its own right. The two items I remember vividly were the foie gras stuffed lobster and, surprisingly, the rib eye steak. I would add that neither of those courses look anything like what you are currently picturing in your head, not even close. There were a couple of things I didn't like about the food, though. The very first thing they brought out was a trio of melon balls that had been stuffed with various items, but the one with a kumomoto oyster was just awful, due to the tepid oyster inside. To put things in perspective, I used to live in Vancouver BC and eat kumomotos by the dozen. I love 'em. L2o served me up one of the worst oysters I've ever had. This made me sad. By the same token, some of the other shellfish courses didn't taste as ocean fresh as they could be. Denver restaurants have the same problem, so maybe that's just the best that can be done when you're eating seafood in the midwest. There were a few moments where I found myself thinking ""why am I having seafood in Chicago."" The entire production at L2o is an incredible dining experience, I feel I got my money's worth and an nice evening of food and entertainment. I probably won't be going back, though.",0.9981,0.778,0.165,0.057,0.5356095415305941

The ambiance was very modern, warm and inviting. The wait staff was very pleasant, extremely attentive and incredibly knowlegeable. And, of course, the food.... We decided on the 14 course tasting menu, and what an adventure that was. About three hours of unveiling course after course. Half the time I would only recognize a couple of the ingredients. But everything was simply...genius. As a Marylander, I was quite excited to see Maryland blue crabs and Old Bay seasoning on the menu. With the exception of the lavender desert (I'm not going to lie...it tasted like soap), I don't know what could have possibly been improved upon.  With the arrival of each course, the sommelier was ready with another bottle of wine. And they were all just so amazing. At one point we were at a 1:1 ratio of course to drink, ha. Tiny courses, remember. So I was feeling pretty giddy fairly early on. Of course we did have a cocktail and five bottles of wine (there were six of us) so I guess it's to be expected.

When our dinner had concluded our waitress disappeared only to be found outside hailing is a cab and opening the door for us!  The food itself was interesting. Some of the appetizers seemingly were presented as an expression vs. for taste (i.e dehydrated crab chip with a pairing of PBR beer) The actual mains were delicious as were the desserts.

2012-12-12,5.0,"Since I wanted to experience fine dining in another city, and to see what Chicago has to offer, I made reservations at L20. The location of the restaurant is at the bottom of a hotel. Upon walking in, the decor is pretty modern and you feel that you're in a very upscale restaurant. The staff is AMAZING and was very polite, attentive, detailed oriented, etc. I was amazed how accommodating and knowledgeable they are about  the food and the wine. They had a sommelier, who was very very knowledgeable about the wines in the wine list. That book was ridiculously thick and prices can range from $50 for a bottle to $1,000's which included champagne. We opted for a mid level Bourdeaux which was excellent. I was also curious to know what L2O meant and the hostess kindly responded that the chef came up with the name because of the food - Land To Ocean The menu is pretty simple - 2 types of pre-fix's to choose from, and I'm pretty sure it changes when the chef wants to change the menu. We decided to go the 1st pre-fix route as the 2nd option would have been food coma instantaneously. They started us off with bite sized appetizers, one we particularly enjoyed was the cantaloupe melon ball where the center had foie gras. As you know California doesn't allow this anymore, but tasting the buttery salty foie gras with the sweet cantaloupe was just fantastic. Other dishes that were notable were the tuna tar tar covered with avocado with a dash of caviar on top, the main entree of lobster with potato and shitake mushroom, the main entree of the rib eye, but overall the food here was pretty amazing. Was it worth the price you ask me....Yes indeed! It's definitely a fine dining experience, service at L20 is one of the best I have ever been to, they even gave us complimentary dessert on top of the pre-fix menu dessert and that dessert was fantastic! It was a coffee mousse with cognac geletan and a creme brule mousse ice cream with a warm yuzu sauce and some other stuff that I can't remember for the life of me and don't know how all the waiters and waitresses remember each dish and explain to you when they serve it (yes long winded but all the dishes had intricate restaurant lingo when they explained each dish). Appetizer: Tuna tartare tossed in tomato water and covered in the avocado dome. Entree: Maine lobster, smoked foie gras, chanterelles, asparagus, vin jaune Dessert: Raspberry, Raspberry Pearls, Mascarpone Ice, White Chocolate, Gold, Yuzu Jelee and Consome (I'm missing a few as I'm going off descriptions off other yelpers) Thank you L20 for a lovely dining experience!",0.9972,0.819,0.166,0.015,0.5064403917595407

Service was excellent.  I want to say it was because of our friend, but I noticed everyone was getting the same attention.  :) One really nice thing about this restaurant is that they give everyone at the table the option of choosing between a regular dinner or the tasting menu.  Most restos would require the entire table to order one or the other because of serving/timing issues.  (Tasting menus tend to take longer.)  Everyone at our table ordered the tasting menu, but it would have been interesting to see how they juggled service in such an instance.  Food was also excellent. The attention to detail was amazing.  I felt bad for the poor sous chef who had to slice the tiny little baby mushrooms in half and place them precisely in the middle of the equally tiny pasta shells.  My favorite dish of the night was the chocolate dessert so remember to save room if you get the tasting menu.  Too bad I was full by dessert time.

The dishes were great and inventive for the most part.  My big problem really was with my shabu-shabu.  I didn't really understand what I was supposed to do with it, and I get that there's a delicate balance between explaining too much and not explaining at all.  I probably should've spoken up but for whatever reason, I decided to do my own thing.  It was not right.  I get that it's my bad and I applaud L20 for not making me feel bad for doing that when it finally became obvious.  Unfortunately, it did affect my experience there.

I had the wine pairing, which worked very well with each dish and featured wines from France, the US, Italy, and a funky (but good) port-style dessert wine from Australia. The service was impeccable -- exactly what I expect from a Michellin 3-star restaurant.  Just start to get up to use the restroom and someone will rush to pull out the table (or chair, as the case may be).  Silverware replaced after each course.  Bread and water offered any time they needed replenishing.  All those creature comforts you just can't live without!",0.9804,0.837,0.146,0.017,0.42576923076923073

2012-08-30,5.0,"Before I went to chicago, I did some research online for the best fine dining restaurant in town. This didn't come up to be first but it was the best I could make a reservation for the time I was there. This restaurant is on the michelin guide, top restaurant in chicago, and anthony bourdain's list of recommendations. The restaurant is in an apartment building. The door to the restaurant was too normal and plain. I simply walked pass it. When I finally found it, the restaurant gives me a very modern feel, which is to my liking. After seated at the table, I can say this has the best ambience of all that i've been to (been to a few of top 50 restaurant globally). The menu is prix fixe menu, and there is also a tasting menu. I went with the 7 course signature menu. It was great.  First course, blue crab, is my least favorite.  Second course, abalone and black truffle, is very good. (at the time, i thought this would be the best of my 7 course) Third course, turbot, is very good (just as good as second course). Forth course, 3 fish combination (black bass, scorpion and idk), is very good as well (as good as second and third course).  Fifth course, 28 days age steak with lobster, is good. The lobster was very good. The steak taste very well. However, it was too chewy.  Sixth (rhubarb)  and Seventh (souffle)  courses are desserts.  The service was very well but not perfect. After this much review, it seems like this restaurant is perfect in my book. However, there is only one thing wrong. The portion is very small. Most fine dining restaurants have small portion but this place has a new definition to it. Lucky for me, I don't eat that much.

2012-08-17,3.0,"Hmmmm, how to start a review for an outrageously expensive meal that was lovely, but not anything special w/o sounding like a douche....well....it eludes me -- so here it is -- L2O is fine, but nothing to knock your socks off. I promise.  I will give it this, the service is absolutely outstanding -- we were wished ""Happy Anniversary"" by I think every single person remotely related to the waitstaff, and our waiter was quite darling and attentive w/o being overbearing. Perhaps my mediocs experience relates to the fact that we did not start with caviar. When I think of all that ails me, it is often due to this gross oversight -- but I digress -- we did the prix fixe menu ($120/pp w/o wine pairings) -- and although the menu changes, I should probably outline a few items -- for the amuses, the melon balls w/ salmon/oyster/whatever/foie were fine -- more cute than flavorful -- skip if you're not hungry. The kampachi crudo was prettier than it was tasty, the loup de mer dumpling had the consistency of a firm matzoh ball that had been overrun w/ broccoli (not a bad thing, but not great), and my lobster tail was delicious, but isn't lobster + butter + mushrooms kind of a no brainer? The foie shabu shabu got good marks, but as my date says, ""when is foie not outrageous?"" -- idk, sister, idk. OH, and a simple thing -- the bread is fine, but not enough to make me stalk the breadboy repeatedly (which, yes, I have done...)  -- and the butter could have been/should have been softer -- but, they did give us a gorgeous domeful of it, so my arteries were happily clogged by the end of our feast. For those who like to eat in style, the decor is both serene and dated -- it wanted to be Japanese-ish, kind of....but it was more like Japan in 1980, which is when I think the chairs were probably considered the peak of modern comfort, judging by the amnt of white leather involved (though the resto is only 5-6 years old...lots of questions...) -- it's been a while/forever since I've had the pleasure of dining in somewhere that vaguely reminds me of a bedroom, and that wall-to-wall cream carpet really brought it home. The atmosphere is not one of hushed reverence, as it is at Alinea, nor is it that of a paparazzi stakeout, ala French Laundry (that is, if you're seated next to a tourist of a certian flavor) -- but it was always easy to hear my date -- in short, it's AARP approved -- and the clientele is not sexy. I repeat, not sexy.  Overall, I thought the menu sounded better than it delivered. The presentation is gorgeous, but I did not leave feeling that my palate had been wowed/dazzled. That said, it's a lovely way to spend an evening, esp if someone else is paying. I wouldn't turn up my nose at what they're doing here, but I wouldn't return either.

2012-07-19,2.0,"The most interesting dish I had was the greeting of honeydew melon stuffed with foie gras. It was creative and had a dynamic taste composition. Everything in it's wake was little to write home about. The hamachi and tuna was good, but it didn't strike me as amazing. It was on par with mediocre sushi restaurants anywhere in the city. The pork belly with truffle potato was fair but again nothing one can't find in this city for a fraction of the price and likely better. I a little annoyed that they even served pork belly. If you're trying to be in the forefront of the food world don't serve a dish based on every signature dish of every gastro pub of yesteryear. Pork belly and truffles are so played out. The lobster was cooked well but again nothing to rave about. The ribeye was cooked well but strangely flavorless like a ribeye should be. There were about 10 other courses that were so unmemorable that I've sincerely forgotten them. I'm all for the fun and experience of fine dining but this place misses the mark. I think 80% of the dishes I had used truffles, and or foie gras in some kind of form. For me that's just a red flag of pretentiousness, and lack of creativity and skill. This place needs to jump in the delorean and time travel from manhattan NYC circa 1998 and holler at Chicago 2012. I'm not surprised they lost their stars now. I can see why. The service was good but to the point of annoying. Too much pomp and circumstance. My one gripe was a young man who served us about 4 dishes. He delivered 2 dishes and upon describing them he let out a ""I forgot"" punctuated with a nervous laugh. I won't be back ever again unless they get a new chef/management/stars. If you are in chicago and in the mood for serious fine dining. I would recommend Acadia. They are a bit more casual than L20 but their menu, design, and service make it known they are shooting for that 2 star rating. And doing a fine job of it.  Did I mention dinner for 2 at acadia will be below 350 with wine? While the $700.00 and change, pre-tip, sans wine pairing is highway robbery for what I had at L20.

2012-07-01,5.0,"We recently returned to L2O and had a truly 5-star experience. The food and service were both excellent throughout the entire meal, and I am very glad we returned. The meal started with a tray of  ""fruits de mer"" canapes, and a mussel tart. The canapes are a refreshing start to the meal, and the mussel tart manages to pack a complete dish of moules mariniere into a single bite. Awesome. We chose the prix fixe menu this time-- for my three courses I chose the kona kampachi, the loup de mer dumpling, and the rouge barbet. The first two courses were exquisitely plated (I'm not sure how they make the green spots on the dumpling so perfectly), but more importantly they were delicious and had true deep ocean flavors. The third course, however, completely blew me away. The rouge barbet was most definitely the best seafood dish I've ever had in my life. Besides being fresh and perfectly cooked, the accompanying pea puree and risotto married with the flavor of the fish to create a depth of flavor that I didn't think was possible. It was unreal. My wife chose the mussels, dumpling, and agnolotti. All three of her courses were beautiful, and she loved all three. I only got to try a bite of the agnolotti, but it was outstanding and perfectly cooked. We supplemented our meal with a cheese course between the mains and dessert-- they had a great variety to choose from, with the usual accompaniments. I especially enjoyed mixing the cheeses with a few selections from their bread tray. I feel like bread service doesn't get a lot of love in restaurant reviews, and that's a shame for L2O because theirs is outstanding. I would eat a mountain of their mini croissants and bacon bread if it were possible. Another aspect of L2O that I really enjoyed again was their wine service. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and I really love their wine list. It's set up in a very logical manner and has a lot of unique gems. I've actually used their list a couple times to help choose bottles in the wine shop. It's that good. Continuing on, the desserts were outstanding as well. Our favorite was the manjari chocolate egg with salted caramel ice cream, malt snow and coffee emulsion. We've had a few spectacular desserts over the years that still stick out in our minds as the best of the best, and I think this one is going to join them. It was delicious and perfectly balanced. Also, macarons at the end of the meal were perfect. Our servers were formal and precise, but friendly and comfortable at the same time. We were treated wonderfully all night and we left with big smiles on our faces. Our server walked us out, and our car was waiting and ready without us even asking- nice touch!

We ended the night with a grand marnier souffle, and as they cracked it so that they could pour the creme angliaise inside, a small bit of souffle fell onto the table.  Our server GASPED, and apologized profusely as she cleaned it up, as if she had commited a grave sin.  That is a little more stuffy than I like, but I appreciate the effort.

Brought my sister here for her 30th birthday (on 11.11.11 - pretty big deal I would have to say!).  We both LOVE seafood, so I was very excited to bring her here for her big birthday. I had called ahead to request that they print one tasting menu with no prices (for my sister) - and they were very accommodating.  They also printed ""Happy Birthday Karen!"" at the top of both our menus, which was a nice touch. We were one of the first customers for dinner, and the restaurant very quiet when we first arrived.  The service is flawless -- we sat at a private booth facing out into the dining room and when we were seated (as well as when either of us needed to use the washroom and at the end of the meal), the waitstaff pulled out our table for us and 'tucked it back in' so that we were a comfortable distance from the table.  During the meal a series of waiters were extremely attentive and were great at explaining each course. The food was delicious - beautiful presentations that delighted all the senses.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my sister had the luxury tasting menu.  My favorites were the lobster bisque with tiny apple spheres, turbot, maine lobster and foie gras, and the fromage blanc.  We were absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal and could barely finish our souffles. The only thing I would change about our dining experience would be to allocate more time for dinner - we were a bit rushed at the end of the meal as we had plans after dinner.  The restaurant was great about picking up the pace in serving our last couple courses more quickly when we let them know we were in a bit of a time bind.

2012-02-15,5.0,"Review update on a vegetarian tasting, where I can honestly say you can indeed trust Chef Kirkley. L2O invited me back to dine with them, with the hope that I would change my opinion of the restaurant due to a new executive chef on staff. After some thought, I decided to take them up on their offer, and I'm glad I did. Outstanding is the word I'd have to use to describe this fine dining experience, and what an experience it was. Chef Matthew Kirkley exceeded all of my expectations. My vegetarian tasting menu left me impressed and truly eager to try each next course, which somehow was better than the last. As beautiful as my husbands seafood tasting courses were to look at, my vegetarian tastings were just as creative, and as much of a work of art.   Some of my favorite standout courses that evening were: butternut parfait  risotto with heart of palm, shaved truffle homemade soba, mushrooms, in red and white pearl onion broth fromage blanc with calvados caramel, brioche, apples My last bite was a gold flecked chocolate piece of heaven. The pace of all the courses was perfect and everyone who we interacted with was giving 110%. We were seated at a nice table at the end of the restaurant, where we could survey the room. They had a full house on a Friday night, every table was filled, yet the service was astounding. I have to thank everyone at L2O who righted a wrong and have made me not feel like the evil redheaded vegetarian step child, that must settle for a basic soup, salad, and pasta. You came out a winner, and I'm looking forward to when we can return here for our next special occasion. My husband told me this ranks as the best meal of his life, and I'd have to agree. The evening ended with a tour of the kitchen. Both the husband and I have worked in kitchens, but nothing prepared either of us for the clean and calm atmosphere we encountered.

2012-02-13,5.0,"In a nutshell: Food - 4 stars P/C - 5 stars Service - 5 stars You know, I find it a much easier task to give restaurants 4 stars than 5 stars.  To me, there is no restaurant that is perfect for everyone - simply because everybody's different and their preferences are different.  L2O was one of those that I had to give 5 stars even though I didn't fall in love with all of their dishes.  But, what it came down to was the overall experience - I had such an exceptional experience here and the experience just showed how absolutely strong the restaurant was with the things that mattered the most for dine-outers  like myself. I want to give a quick run-down of what I had, and i will move on to my goods and not-so-goods. - couple seafood-driven amuse-bouches - sashimi platter with the ocean-trout, ahi-tuna, and kampachi - tuna tartare with avocado, tomatoes and caviar - black and white fettucine with uni/lobster emulsion and osteria caviar - lobster bisque with apple and calvados - dumpling with lubina, broccoli, scallop sauce and black truffle - john-dory/foie gras sandwich? - shabu shabu with abalone, foie gras, kampachi and what noodles in dashi - cheese course with 2 kinds of cows milk cheese - hazelnut praline souffle with the hazelnut creme anglaise - chesenut crepe cake with cassis port and brown butter and of course the wine paring for each course,  yes, i almost asked for a stretcher to carry me out when the dinner was done... The Goods: 1. first and foremost - cristine the server and other wonderful folks in the dining room took complete care of me. they were almost flawless in their service, anticipating every move - which should be a standard at any such highly-regarded restaurant such as l2o.  what i especially found exceptional was their willingness to listen to you -  i shared candidly all of which i liked (tuna tartare and lobster bisque especially) and did not like (like shabu shabu) - and she wanted to not only just blindly agree with me, but really, educated me and shared her perspective on how the dishes came through and why they are being served the way they are.  truly michelin-star worthy. 2. i am digging the decor - at first, it kinda reminded me of IKEA, but it immediately put me at ease.  the overall mix of brown, black, gold and silver colors were very comforting to me.  the seating is also spacious which loved (and it made me appreciate it even more as i thought of gary danko and how cramped i was...stressful) 3. l2o really shattered my preconceived notions about tuna tartares and lobster bisques.  i generally don't care for these two and i'd avoid them if i see them, mostly because they are overrated and hard to do them right.  when the L2O versions of these dishes came out, my taste buds were literally rocking.  the bisque was  so light (!) with such an unexplainably perfect sensation of texture and tastes - salty, sweet, a hint of tang, earthy, chewy, etc etc.  tuna tartare - which consisted of avocado (on my hate list of vegetables) and tomatoes, blew me away.  it was better than any tuna tartares i've had anywhere (michael mina - you should taste some of this and reflect upon your own over-priced tartare...) 4. the wine program was pretty quirky - taking me back and forth from new to old worlds - most of them quite well-matched with the dishes except for the sicilian red wine paired with shabu shabu. 5. i don't know why - but i felt so comfortable being here, no pretense, no frills.  don't get me wrong - this is a creme de la creme of all restaurants and everybody's expected to behave decently, here though, even in my bow-tie outfit, i completely relaxed, stretched out, and absorbed everything - food, atmosphere, service, the lights, the neighbor diners conversations (hehe..) 6. the level of knowledge and professionalism of L2O's staff really humbles me.  i asked a LOT of questions throughout my meal, partially to see how knowledgeable the staff.  Cristine even knew the origins of where the coffee beans for my espresso came from. The not-so-goods: 1. I was a bit confused by the shabu-shabu dish - I honestly don't understand how the kampachi, abalone and foie gras go together.  also, when i dipped the foie gras in the dashi, it made such wonderfully flavorful dashi this cloudy, fatty broth, which did NOT go well with the buckwheet noodle.  to me this dishe was a flop. 2. The cheese course looked a bit half-ass and haphazardly put-together.  if you're going to offer cheese at all, do it right (i thought of cyrus or hans herzog in new zealand) 3. the interval from one dish to next was a bit off - which i can understand...and i needed that pause to be able to handle all these courses i had. L2O really afforded me one of the most complete dining experiences, even until the last moment (this was around 1:45am after a 4 1/2 expereicne) when I was getting in the cab, they were bidding good-byes and asking how everything was.

2012-01-12,2.0,"Was taken here on Monday night. Party of 2. 8pm The restaurant had, perhaps 10 other diners. Started with a drink in their lounge. We were the only guests in the lounge- so we exited it quickly and sat down at our table. The service in general was attentive. Water and wine glasses were refilled promptly. The very long waits between courses was unpleasant. Hard to understand given that the restaurant was nearly empty. That which was was also unpleasant- actually creepy, was their orchestrated table service. As noted by other Yelpers, the waiters would approach the table in unison, plate the dishes in unison, pour the sauces in unison, turn and exit in unison. It was like being served by robots. Too much tension in the air. We could feel how uncomfortable the waiters were. Very unsettling.  SINGULAR seven-course luxury ingredient tasting menu * 188 maryland blue crab en gelée * fennel cream, basil hand harvested maine scallop * cooked in the shell, leeks, black truffle lubina * caviar, lake mont grapes maine lobster * smoked foie gras, black trumpet, vin jaune 28-day dry aged ribeye * butternut squash, potato fondant, capers chestnut crêpe cake * cassis, port, brown butter grand marnier soufflé * orange  As to the food- we elected to order their premier tasting menu- for the not too absurd price of $188 per person. Honestly- I don't care if it was a tasting menu or an a la carte menu- for $188 I want to leave the restaurant feeling sated- let alone feeling as though I received just value for the money spent. In any event, my host and I were very hungry after we departed L2O. $600 spent on food and wine for 2 people- and we were hungry. That's just not right. Their bread service offered good variety. However, the bread was served at room temp and also, it sat out on an uncovered tray and had become pretty stiff. The wine service was improper- the red wine was served at white wine temp. I mentioned it to the friendly wine steward- he didn't pay much attention. As to the food- so much of it was under seasoned. Salt would go a long, long way toward improving their cuisine. An amuse of stuffed melon balls was presented. Each of the melons was way under ripe.  Their take on a (really) miniature lobster roll was tasty. I could eat a plate full. Alas, only 1 was provided (about half the size of a traditional cocktail pig in a blanket). The scallop cooked in its shell was overcooked, spongy and lacking in flavor. The fish topped with caviar was also under salted. Tasty- but tiny. The fish measured, perhaps, 1"" x 1"" The foie gras and lobster could have been so much better if the foie hadn't been overcooked. What a waste.... The ribeye was nothing special- 4 small slices totaling 2 or 3 ounces of protein. The chestnut crepe cake was outstanding.  The souffle was forgettable. Just a pile of foam without any flavor. The sauce didn't bring anything to the mix. One would think- after all of these courses, that one would be stuffed to the gills. Not so---- So many better restaurants for so much less cash.",0.9644,0.891,0.074,0.035,0.518958152958153

While the decor and service were perhaps not as 'perfected' as Tru's, the food was indeed superior. Further, the staff was incredibly friendly and comforting for a restaurant of this level. In fact, the sommelier at L2O was easily the best we've ever had; he knew all there was to know about wine and led us in all the right directions, including a kitchen tour after the meal!

2011-12-20,4.0,"L2O is a terrific restaurant which is a bit of an enigma.  I use that term in the way people use it to describe sports players who have all the attributes to be truly great, and occasionally show it, but in the end are rather inconsistent for no good reason.  For example, ""The Nets parted with Benoit Benjamin, their enigmatic starting center.""  This place could be a great restaurant - all the pieces are there - instead it is a very good restaurant because it stumbles a bit too often. The food can be great, amongst the best I've had, but it can also miss at some surprising times.  For example, our amuse was a lovely presentation of three types of melon balls lovingly nestled on the leaves of the plant shaped serving piece.  A beautiful looking presentation which got the evening off right as it was such a good conversation starter.  The only problem was that the amount of melon was too much and overwhelmed the wonderful filings - oyster, foie gras, and trout.  Great idea, lovely presentation, execution was slightly off.  This would become a pattern. We ordered from the Prix Fixe menu.  When some guests asked to order somewhat differently than the menu presented, their requests were happily accommodated by the wait staff.  Off to a good start.  My first course was the scallop - this was, by far, the best dish I've eaten all year at any restaurant.  Diced raw scallop nestled on a creamy disk of Foie Gras with some caviar on top.  The highlight was the incredibly vivid lime juice which dressed the dish.  So unbelievable - they need to bottle this stuff.  I'm pretty sure it was so flavorful it may have been brought here by aliens.  This is a great dish.  As was the Ahi Tuna, which was presented as a flat green (avocado) and pink (tuna) palate and may have been the most beautiful dish I've seen recently.  Again, it was marvelous. The second course arrived after too lengthy of a wait between courses.  It was carried out of the kitchen on large trays by servers who stood at attention at either end of the table holding the trays.  After several minutes of standing there (which felt like 20 minutes to us poor, uncomfortable diners) the servers appeared to place the food on the table.  This was definitely a big boo-boo - it made everyone at the table very uncomfortable while we waited so long to be served.   The Black and White fettucine was a triumph.  Unctuous and delicious with lovely pieces of uni accented by the saltiness of the caviar and the sweet, creaminess of the emulsion.  Terrific.  Unfortunately the dumpling (loup de mer and broccoli) which looked gorgeous when it arrived (a lovely egg spotted with green dots - breathtaking) was boring from a flavor perspective.  Again, a pattern emerges. Third course was more of the same - gorgeous looking dishes, uncomfortable service miscues, and dull flavors.  Once again the platters arrived carried by two runners who waited uncomfortably for a couple of minutes before anyone arrived to serve the food.  They then proceeded to place the dishes in front of the wrong diners, only to realize a minute later they'd screwed up at which point they had to awkwardly remove the plates and put them in front of the right people.  Really a disaster for a restaurant of this caliber.  Confit of ocean trout looked lovely.  The fish was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth.  Too bad my mouth had nothing else to do though, since there was very little flavor.  Bouillabaisse was similarly dull.  The lacquered lobster was lovely and flavorful, though the truffle was a bit overwhelming for me. Desert was awesome.  As others have mentioned the soufflés are fabulous.  And our server attentively saw us debating whether to get the raspberry dessert instead and he ended up bringing us one to sample, in addition to the soufflés we ended up ordering.  This was a great dessert with a wonderful lavender infused broth which was a beautiful juxtaposition to the fresh berries. Overall the service was flawed - at times overly obsequious to the point where it was uncomfortable.  I think they would have been better served with a less fawning and more subtle approach.  They also had a number of major service gaffes (the long waits to be served) and inconsistencies (sometimes a napkin would be folded and replaced when a dinner was away, sometimes it was not).  To achieve greatness the service issues will need to be addressed.   The food was sometimes amazing (scallops!) and sometimes dull (dumpling, trout) but it was always very precious and beautifully presented.  And that is why L2O gets the ""enigmatic"" rating.  It could be great, but is sometimes boring, and oftentimes service trips it up, but at other times is spot on.",0.9996,0.691,0.238,0.071,0.6307072845604954

2011-11-17,2.0,"I came from Tennessee with a mission to try some of the best food Chicago has to offer. What a surprise L20 was. Three Michelin stars? Really?? I'm pretty forgiving of restaurants, but at $200+ a pop, this was a huge disappointment. At least two of my courses were so exceedingly over-salted I couldn't finish them. The tuna tartare had no seasoning whatsoever--tasted like ground up tuna and nothing else. The dishes were dated and uninspired (tuna tartare wrapped in avocado, Grand Marnier souffle) and the service was mostly friendly, but so ridiculously pretentious and overblown that we barely managed to suppress our giggling every time a sparkling new napkin was proffered from the jaws of silver tongs (again).  Our server was friendly until I asked about the sauce on the salmon (it was unbearably salty, but I just asked how it was made--apparently from the roasting juices of the oxtail). When he asked ""Do you like it?"" and I responded (trying to be tactful) ""It's tasty but seems to overpower the delicate fish"", from that moment on he was decidedly chilly.  The crowd appeared to be a ""see and be seen"" financial district sort of crowd. Maybe they are looking for pretentious service. Me, I just want to be fed by someone who loves the food and cares enough to pay attention to it before it comes to my table. Too much to ask at L20.",0.9882,0.769,0.185,0.046,0.5808080808080808

2011-10-31,4.0,"The restaurant was very quiet, and lighting not too dark. Everyone was well dressed; the average age of the diners was probably 50 or so. Wait staff was almost too attentive. The seats were nicely padded. A decent environment to eat in. Anyways, on to the food. My girlfriend and I both ordered the ""luxury"" tasting menu. Those courses marked with a star are my terrible descriptions, and those that aren't were pulled from the website. ------ *Cucumber balls, green jelly, and fish cream - Received this small dish pretty quickly after we got there. I'm guessing that the fish creme, which tasted like concentrated salmon, was supposed to be the main feature. Sadly, I don't like salmon. *Bread service - A selection of six or so breads. Continuously offered throughout the meal. I think this is for the men who wont get full from a typical tasting. The mini herbed croissants were great. Other bread selections were of high quality, but not that special.  *Some small dish that I might have forgotten. Maryland blue crab en gelée, fennel cream, basil - Eating all the layers together was delicious. I think they used claw or small leg meat (as opposed to backfin), which I think are the crabbiest, and best tasting parts of the crab. Maybe a bit too much cream at the bottom. Hand harvested maine scallop, cooked in the shell, leeks, black truffle - Very good. The flavor of the steamed scallop was very, very subtle. The small pile of cubed truffles on top were stinky(in a good way). Very fun to watch them open the shell for you.   Lubina, caviar, niagara grapes - Pretty tasty. The caviar, fish, and mystery sauce combination was great. The normal grapes and jelly grapes were pointless. Maine lobster, smoked foie gras, chanterelles, vin jaune - The foie gras and the asparagus were amazing. Best course by far. Great presentation. Lobster could have been cooked a tad more. I would have been happy eating this course a couple more times. 28-day dry aged ribeye, potato - The meat was a bit tough. The cutlery that they provided (looked like skinny butter knives), were barely sufficient to cut through the meat. Potatoes ""cylinders"" were cool looking but too buttery. The strangely-grilled king oyster mushroom was very good though.  *Minty, herby ice with sorbet and foam - I think they served this to ""cleanse"" my palette for the souffle, which I think it accomplished. Very light and pretty good, but I really hate eating foam/air/bubbbles. praline soufflé, hazelnut anglaise - Huge. I really liked the bits of hazelnut. I think the hazelnut anglaise was a bit too much and made the dessert too sweet and heavy.  *Burnt, doughy doughnut cylinders and chocolate - I was too sugared out by this point, but the doughtnut things went very well with the pu-erh tea we ordered. ------ This place was great. Pretty much all the courses were tasty and memorable. Since I'm relatively new to reviewing on yelp, I'd rather not dilute the value of my stars.

2011-10-29,4.0,"The restaurant has 2 dining options; either a 6-course tasting menu (2 varieties) or a 4-course menu where you select your options from a collection of courses.  My husband and I opted for the tasting menus - he the upgraded ""singular"" tasting menu and I the ""Autumn"" menu - while our companions chose from the 4-course menu.  The wine list is extensive and a bit overwhelming if you're a bit of a novice, but the sommelier was very helpful and poured nice selections without going over the top on price. The food is very good, though to be honest I'm not sure I would give it 3 Michelin stars.  If I put L20 up next to The French Laundry or even Joel Robichon (which was not my favorite), it stands up, but does not exceed expectations.  I will say that it is probably the prettiest food I've ever seen, the presentation is outstanding.  In terms of flavor, the standout dishes in my opinion were the Hand Harvested Maine Scallop, the Lubina, the Tripes a la mode de Caen and the Grand Marnier Souffle. The scallop is presented tableside in the shell, wrapped in bread pastry.  The server then peels the bread shell away from the actual shell and opens it to reveal the scallop.  The scallops are initially opened in the kitchen, seasoned, then closed again and wrapped in the bread to keep the shell sealed while the scallop cooks.  Once opened, the scallop is served, still attached to its lower shell.  And while the presentation is extreme and unique, the flavor is sublime.  Perfectly cooked, delicately sweet scallop that is seasoned to perfection.  It is the best scallop I have ever tasted. The Lubina is also delicious and perfectly cooked. I had also never had tripe, and honestly was a tad nervous about this dish, but it was wonderful.  I'm not honestly sure I could taste the tripe, but the sweet sourness of the sauce was lovely.  And while I'm on the topic of sauces, there were a few others that were wonderful.  The truffle sauce with the lacquered lobster dish was fantastic, as was the foie gras - truffle emulsion that came with the all wagyu beef (dishes of our dining companions). For dessert the 3 women had soufflé, while my husband opted for a cheese course instead.  The soufflés came out perfectly, tall and fluffy and golden brown.  The praline soufflé was good, but my friend's Grand Marnier soufflé was outstanding - I wish I had ordered it instead.  My husband loved his cheese plate, though I was too full to actually taste any of it. As for service, it was very good without being stellar.  At this level I expect all of the details to be perfect and there were a couple of small missteps.  One of our friends is not a huge fan of fish (I know, this IS a fish restaurant), so she asked our primary server if there was another option for her second course.  He should have started our service by asking if we had any food preferences or dislikes, but he did not.  When she asked for an alternative for her second course, he should have, in my opinion, immediately offered to check with the chef.  He did not.  All he could say was that there was a vegetarian dish on the menu.  It was made of mushroom, another food she was not fond of.  It was not as if she was asking for them to make an entirely new menu for her, she just wanted another option for a single course.  At this level, they should have easily been able to accommodate that.  He also did not offer to have our valet charge added to our bill.  When I asked a secondary server what the valet charge was, SHE offered to have it added to our bill - which was already paid.  We all had to dig for change to make sure we had the right cash to pay the valet.  Lastly, all of the napkins were white.  I know, I know, not a big deal, but all of the women were wearing black and oftentimes at nice restaurants they will swap out the white napkins for dark when the women are wearing dark clothing.  It keeps the napkins from shedding little while fluffies all over our clothing. In the end, L2O is definitely worth a visit for a special occasion.  You will enjoy the food both visually and in flavor.  But for the best meal of your life, I'd still vote for The French Laundry.",0.9995,0.773,0.197,0.03,0.5457542688792687

Very well flavored Main Maine lobster - butter poached, peas, orange, bacon, mousseline - Lobster was tender, portion was decent, flavors mixed well together but again, tasted just like it sounds a11 wagyu - grilled, maine lobster, fondant potatoes, foie gras truffle emulsion - this has an extra charge but it was extremely well prepared.

2011-09-26,4.0,"Michelin-rated restaurants, if personified, remind me a bit of family.  All restaurants in the ""3 Star Michelin Family"" have slightly different ""personalities,"" so to speak.  You have the glamorous and impeccably put-together aunt (Daniel in NYC), the humble and wise grandfather (Le Bernardin in NYC), and the super-cool, at times advant-garde cousin who probably curates at the MoMA (Alinea).   And then there's L2O, your refined and successful sister, who despite her polished exterior, exudes warmth and friendliness.  It is this charm that is prevalent in all elements of L2O - the dining room (with a simplistic design, but not in the slightest stuffy), the menu (seafood sourced from all over the world, respectful to each  culture's original interpretation of the dish), and the service (approachable and willing to give detailed explanations when questions arise).   Chef Francis Brennan, perhaps not as imaginative or inventive as Laurent Gras, has managed to craft a ""global,"" primarily seafood-based menu that manages to be cohesive, rather than aimlessly trying to impress the diner with ingredients that had to travel thousands of miles to arrive in Chicago.  With that said, I promise not to pull any Thomas Friedman-isms [1] in this review.   I had the honor and distinction of dining with esteemed Yelper (all the way from London!) Yee Gan O.  Great food and great conversation made for an evening that seemed to last all of 10 minutes, when in fact, it was closer to 2.5 hours. Which tasting menu to opt for?  (There are two.)  Decisions, decisions.  We selected the Singular tasting menu, which prides itself on using more premium ingredients.  Shortly after placing our order, our waiter came back with an amuse of tuna tartare with tiny cucumber spheres and an array of bread to choose from.  As a carbohydrate fanatic, I needed advice and asked for help on which of the 5+ breads to select.  In a move that may have caused him to win my heart, he just started loading the plate up with lots of bread.  Swoon. And then the tasting promptly began: Maryland Blue Crab en Gelee with Fennel Cream - Lovely presentation, with the crab buried beneath the whipped fennel cream.  That slight licorice flavor typical of fennel did a great job of balancing the sweetness of the crab. Hand harvested Maine scallop - The presentation and preparation reminded me of the freshly caught scallops in Galicia - the scallop came in its original shell with a ""broth"" containing thinly shaved leeks.  Although not as fresh as anything from Spain, the scallop was sweet, juicy, and most importantly, not gritty.   Turbot - Prepared with yuzu and lime.  Full disclosure: I am a brat, having eaten at Le Bernardin and lived in Spain.  Although the fish was wonderful, with a delicate flavor, it was not the best I've had. Maine lobster with smoked foie gras - We agreed that this was the best (and also most unusual) course of the evening!  In addition to the seemingly odd pairing of lobster and foie gras, there were chanterelles prepared in a vin jaune sauce.  When we asked how the sauce was made, our waiter happily explained.  I found the savory aspects of the foie gras with the vin jaune to be more pronounced than the lobster. A11 Wagyu - Although I am generally not a red-meat eater, this particular cut was super-tender and not in the slightest sinewy.  Our waiter explained that A11 is the highest grade of beef allowed into the US.  (Needless to say, I learned a bit at dinner!) And for dessert... Prailine souflee with hazelnut anglaise - This dessert was created for me.  Seriously; someone in the kitchen must know hazelnut is my weakness.  The souffle was fluffy, warm, and light and ranks as one of the best I've eaten.  I was completely devastated when I reached the bottom of the dish and my glass of jerez was empty. It was also devastating to know that this was the end of the meal; that my time with Yee Gan was up.  From the beginning of our meal to the point where we collected jackets from the coat check, we were treated with the warmth one treats a good friend.  I may not see Yee Gan often, I will probably not dine at L2O often (unless someone would like to fund my outings), but feel this familiarity makes Chicago feel a bit more like home.

2011-09-26,5.0,"I know I'm very lucky to be able to come on my roller coaster / national park / gastronomic tours of the USA and I feel even more privileged to share time with Yelp friends on my way through. Michelin has just deemed Chicago worthy of publishing a guide to the restaurants to the city and my pre-trip research led to me to 3 Michelin rated L2O. Taken together with the fact that a lot of of the top restaurants in the city don't open on Sundays when I was in town, fellow Yelper Dana F and I decided to dine at L2O despite the fact that the chef in the kitchen had changed since they were bestowed with their 3 stars. Dana F is my 3 Michelin star dining friend! We've only shared 2 meals and they've both been at 3 star establisments! Last year's meal was at Daniel in NYC. I much preferred the more intimate ambience of L2O - the tables are well spaced out and the muted lighting and decor made it feel relaxed and this was reflected in the friendly yet consumately  professional service. No over-snooty haute-service here! Though Dana did feel obliged to notice that L2O didn't have a table for her handbag unlike Daniel! After a moment's consideration, we went with the Singular tasting menu with the promise of premium ingredients used throughout. The list of ingredients did read like a chef's dream 'mystery box' - wagyu beef, black truffle, foie gras, lobster, turbot, crab. Ah but then comes the pressure of converting those into a wonderful meal. Our bouches were amused with tuna tartare with cucumber spheres, both delicate flavours handled sympathetically. When Dana couldn't decide which bread to choose, the waiter put a large selection on her plate! Then the tasting menu proper arrived: 1. Maryland Blue Crab en Gelee with Fennel Cream A classic pairing served in layers, which necessitated a straight spoonful downwards to get the intended combination of sweet crab meat, fennel cream with green (sorry, forgot the herb) gelee. This pairing is a classic for a reason and the soft creamy aniseed flavour of the fennel was a lovely foil for the crab. 2. Hand Harvested Maine Scallop Another classic preparation - the scallops were opened and truffle inserted with other flavouring, the shell closed and sealed with puff pastry round the edge. Nice to see the drama of the server removing the pastry lid and the scallop presented in its shell. The scallop retained its moisture, cooked in this way though it won't have the caramelisation of pan searing if you like that. Nice and sweet scallop meat. 3. Turbot with Citrus Flavours A meaty fish which carried on the theme of top class ingredients though perhaps a more flaky fish would have been a nice contrast a menu containing many robust main ingredients. 4. Maine Lobster with Smoked Foie Gras I have to confess I'm a foie gras addict, so this always had a good chance of being my favourite dish and so it turned out! Lobster and foie gras pair perfectly - who knew!? Well, chef Francis Brennan, I suppose! The sauce of chanterelles had a base of vin jaune and oru server was able to tell is the exact way the wine is made - most impresive. 5. A11 Wagyu Beef Once again, our server was able to explain that Australian imported wagyu comes in 11 grades, A11 being the top grade. Handled sympathetically, the marbling of fat through the meat made it a wonderfully tender piece of beef. Despite not being a beef eater, Dana was sold! 6. Praline Souffle with Hazelbut Anglaise A wonderfully risen souffle which wasn't too eggy concluded our meal. I love souffle and this was a great example. A wonderful meal. Wonderful company. The sign which confirms that is the speed at which time flies past. I think Michelin will still be impressed when they return here.",0.999,0.809,0.184,0.006,0.5725340136054421

2011-09-21,5.0,"My wife and I recently began a Michelin restaurant tour and L20 was stop number two. What an amazing experience; they have really set the bar high for the rest of our tour.  At L20 you have the option of a four course Prix Fixe (cold appetizer, hot appetizer, main and dessert with several choices for each course), a luxury ingredient tasting menu (six courses) and a seasonal tasting menu (seven courses); there are also private Tatami rooms with their own ten course tasting menu. We wound up going with one Prix Fixe menu and the luxury ingredient menu so that we could sample a wide variety of their offerings. The food at L20 is outstanding; the highest quality ingredients are used and the presentation of the food is extremely artistic. The most fun dish was the Maine scallop cooked in a shell; they use pastry bread to ""tape"" the shell shut which holds in the moisture and the yeast from the bread is released and infuses the seafood. The shell ""taped"" with bread is delivered to the table and a server cuts the tape. This dish was so good when my wife was not looking I picked up the shell and slurped up the last bit of truffles and juices (my taste buds were in heaven until my wife spied my antics and reprimanded me for playing with my food). The Shabu-Shabu was a close second (this dish is like high end seafood fondue). While L2O specializes in seafood, one of my courses featured  A11 Wagyu beef which was about the most tender and flavorful beef I have tasted. My only complaint of the entire night was that the sauce that was poured over the A11 was a tad on the salty side; no need for heavy seasoning with such a perfect cut of beef.  The homemade breads at L2O are absolutely amazing. They had six different offerings and I tried four of them. The rosemary croissant and the bacon roll (thick chunks of bacon inside) were the best. I contemplated asking our server for a couple of bacon rolls to go at the end of the meal as they would have made for a fabulous breakfast tomorrow, but decided I had already embarrassed my wife enough for one evening. When I am dining on Cheerios tomorrow morning though, I will be dreaming of the bacon rolls.  The meal at L2O is nice and leisurely and there were all sorts of extra little courses served interspersed with the food we ordered. Our favorite extra was a mini lobster roll; very yummy and cute to boot. The Souffle is my favorite dessert and the Grand Marnier Souffle at the end of the meal was the best I have had.  The service at L2O was exemplary. While there is a formal atmosphere, the servers had a sense of humor and were friendly and attentive. We had one main server (Cristine) who was outstanding and several other people assisted during the course of the meal. The staff was extremely knowledgeable when we had questions and also receptive to feedback we had about some of their newer dishes (one was brand new tonight). As a nice touch Cristine even escorted us out of the restaurant at the end of the meal.  While L2O is expensive, it is worth the hefty price tag and a fun, memorable experience. L2O is deserving of it's reputation as one of the finest restaurants in Chicago.",0.997,0.851,0.131,0.018,0.5661031366294523
2011-09-07,5.0,"One should be forgiven, I think, for harboring a little apprehension about dining here.  A restaurant which rather publicly lost its semi-eponymous chef shortly after garnering three Michelin stars.  A restaurant which makes no secret of its ownership by the Lettuce Entertain You group - proud managers of such fine establishments as ""Stripburger"" in Las Vegas, and something called rather alarmingly ""Big Bowl Chinese Express."" Well, they do also own Tru ... now sans Rick Tramanto.  And we enjoyed our meal there.  There is precedent. Anyway, we ended up canceling our reservation back in June due to these reservations, but found the time to give it another go this past weekend.  They call early - almost offensively early - to confirm.  Thursday for a Sunday night reservation - not sure if they're being proactive due to my California area code, or just ... well ... early.  They confirm the time, allergies, and make a point of emphasizing that jackets are *requested* for the gentlemen. The dining room is an elegant one, rather small and in a residential building just across from the Lincoln Park Conservatory.  There's also a smallish lounge/waiting area.  Though our server would comment about how different this place is from Tru, we noticed similarities immediately - what we are coming to call privately the ""Chicago Fine Dining"" style.  It's a dark dining room with some light accents - we are seated side by side, looking out on the dining room, just as we were at Tru. They have a cart system here, consisting of many small carts - one for every couple of tables - upon which dishes are placed prior to service, from which silverware emerges, and upon which the cheese tray is placed at the appropriate time.  It is a different system ... not quite as stunningly decadent as the separate cheese cart or the magic of a line of waiters emerging from the kitchen each carrying a single plate to serve a table, but it is efficient and interesting. They offer a Prix Fixe menu of four courses, including dessert, and two tasting menus: a luxury menu with six courses and a seasonal one with eight.  Wine pairings are available with both.    Caviar is available by the ounce for those so inclined - no lower end American options, though. We opt to order both tastings and share the eight course wine pairing, and my companion selects a cocktail to start.  They offer to bring a share plate for the non-overlapping courses. Though we were one of the earlier reservations ( 5:45pm at a restaurant which nominally opens at 6:00pm ), we never felt rushed during a leisurely dinner service.  In fact, the pacing was as near to perfect as I've had at any restaurant of this size and reputation.  Service was that combination of ease and formality that we always look for - getting to know a little bit about the person who is serving your food is always a good sign.  The sommelier - a woman - poured some of our excellent pairings and had a lot of interesting information to impart about the wines.  She was very well informed and reasonably formal while remaining friendly and unpretentious about what can be a very pretentious subject. The food was good - highlights included a meticulously decorated amuse with a cucumber theme, the tuna tartare served in a sphere of avocado, a wonderfully flavored house-made salt cod, a Maine scallop cooked in shell, and a delicate scorpion fish preparation.  Perhaps the weakest were the non-seafood dishes: a lamb loin with very little lamb flavor and a largish chunk of A11 Australian Wagyu which had none of the soft, supple, beefy nature that one comes to expect from that type of high grade meat. Pretty well every restaurant which serves souffles would claim that they are special, and that is not always true, but in the case of L2O, we received what we agree are the best souffle desserts we have ever had, bar none.  Both the Praline and Grand Marnier souffles were perfectly textured, well flavored, not at all eggy, and paired excellently with some wonderful dessert wines. Despite the handicaps brought by a sprawling restaurant group, the loss of their chef, and serving a seafood-heavy menu just about as far from the sea as it is possible to get in the continental USA, our experience at L2O was an excellent one.  They are providing excellent and comfortable service, well-prepared fish dishes, and a remarkably well-thought-out and accessible wine program.  If they fall down somewhere compared to other equally well-reviewed establishments, it would be in the red meat dishes and in the decadence of service.  This was definitely one of my favorite restaurant experiences in Chicago, and one which I would recommend without hesitation.",0.999,0.797,0.169,0.034,0.5644112919429374

I spent a lot of time on the internet looking at fine dining establishments and finally decided on L20. First impressions are important. From the moment I reached someone by phone, it was clear that the intent of the restaurant and its staff was to make the dining experience as pleasant, congenial, fun and wonderful as possible. There was no false pretense and no rigidity. If they could make a request happen, they would and they would do so without making you feel as if your requests were an insult to the protocol the restaurant had established. Our needs were more important than the restaurant""s needs and they weren't doing us a favor to have us in their establishment. Some of Chicago's top tier restaurants could learn a lesson. You're not doing me a favor by allowing me to come; I'm doing you the courtesy by selecting your restaurant. We had a private dining room, offered spontaneously by the maitre when the reservation was made. The Tree Room was perfect for our party of seven. Our server was friendly, humorous and totally knowledgable. When two of the women felt a bit chilled, he offered them pashminas to warm them up and saw immediately about correcting the room temperature. The dishes were explained but not over explained and the service was professional and marvelously streamlined. When food was delivered or removed, a cadre of serves appeared as if on cue and would silently and politely deliver or remove a dish. From beginning to end the preparations were imaginative, combined wonderful and sometimes unexpected tastes, and always lived up to their artiistic promise. We had the Singular menu, 6 courses plus several off menu surprises that delighted the palate. Others have written extensively about the quality  of the food. I echo their praises and will not belabor this review by simply repeating what others have said. You won't be disappointed. Ambience, culinary imagination and expertise and perfect service combined to make a memorable dinner for seven delighted guests. L20 is expensive; not an everyday dining experience.

2011-09-04,4.0,"Went for my girlfriend's birthday, certainly a special occasion place. Didn't just burn a hole in my pocket, it lit the entire pair of pants on fire and reduced it to ashes. Don't get me wrong, this place is another league in terms of food presentation and some dishes were amazing, I think I may have been expecting too much. Went with the summer tasting menu which opened and closed with two of the most amazing dishes I have ever had. The big eyed tuna wrapped in avocado was out of this world, as was the souffle at the end. The middle was somewhat disappointing There are two ingredients I feel L20 uses far too much of. -Truffles -Salt Knowing this was a seafood joint, I suppose the occasional salty, briny flavors are to be expected. But the salt cod w/ potato emulsion was a bit much on that front, and the PEI mussels (while very intricately presented) were a bit heavy on the salt and brine. Truffles and the occasional caviar were thrown in a few dishes. The first time, they are amazing, the third time they are main ingredients gets to be a bit much. The summer peas were OK, as was the loup de mer, but nothing to write home about. The lamb was really good, but it just wasn't all that memorable. Major upsides: -The wine pairing was split (a very kind gesture to us as this was quite the stretch on the budget) and each wine was perfectly paired and tasted amazing. Lots of white, so any red wine folks might want to order a la carte -Holy crap that pastry chef is onto something, both the sorbet and souffle were the most flavorful desserts I've ever tried -The service was unbelievable. We got menus with her name on them, which was a nice touch, plus a tour of the kitchen where the chef invited us to watch the souffle making process. Our waiter was attentive but not ridiculously overbearing and accomodated every request we had. This kept it up at 4 stars for sure -Attention to detail. Everything was done at an obscene level of meticulousness. Each plate was a work of art, and the staff were so detailed in preparation and description of each dish. All in all, it was worth it ($440 before tip for two tastings and one pairing), although the place and the service was more memorable than most of the food.

2011-08-26,4.0,"I think it would be a sin to give this place any less than 5 stars but here are some of the reasons I feel L2O didn't quite stack up: - no replacement napkin when going to the restroom, almost every single Michelin star restaurant I know does this but L2O forgot for our table - crab shells in my blue crab concoction, given the care taken into food prep in this place I was very, very surprised - we ordered the summer and the singular because we wanted to try a variety of dishes and the waiter kept getting us confused since the summer includes a few more courses than singular - why would summer, which is cheaper, include a few more courses than singular?  - Every, single, dish WITHOUT FAIL included sauce and was done with truffle. Every single one. even the summer course. I mean ... using too much truffle is like using butter. It's bound to be good, but it's kind of cheating because you're not illuminating your cooking skills. - dishes are BEAUTIFULLY prepared but drowned in sauce. again kind of cheating, you should be able to cook the food perfectly without sauce and bring out the flavor without drowning every dish in sauce For those reasons I felt that my experience at L2O was not on par with that of a 3 Michelin Star experience. Although this may be too cliche ... French Laundry still holds the #1 spot in service, atmosphere, perfection of presentation and food as far as 3 Michelin Star experiences go. After all, you are paying upwards of $500 just to dine for a party of two with no drinks. Our hostess sat us promptly, and our waitress was nice, but I had on a wrap and it slightly fell over and touched the ground on the chair, but when the server moved my chair he completely got it caught and all wrapped up in the chair. It was kind of weird that it was pretty obvious what would happen and all he had to do was just lift it back onto the chair before moving it ... but anyway Overall, it was a good experience with a few setbacks here and there. The food was good but again drowned in sauce, so I can't even say the waygu was spectacular because ... it was drowned in truffle sauce and a little overly salty. The oxtail pasta was memorable and thankfully came with a broth and not a thick sauce. The highlight of the night though which overrode everything since so far it sounds more like a 3.5 star experience was the souffles. OH EM GHEE. I was blown away upside down and then around again. These were just simply AMAZING.  There are no other words to describe the perfection that L2O has created with their souffles. Both the praline hazelnut and the grand marnier were exceptional (caps bolded underlined twice!) because they were cooked perfectly and the sauce paired amazingly well.  This was a solid, freaking, dessert experience that I have NEVER had at any Michelin star restaurant because it was always a ... EH experience since I'm not that much of a dessert girl. I'm in love.

2011-08-15,4.0,"***L2O is a nice fine dining restaurant with great service though the food is not as good or contemporary as its Chicago competition Alinea, Avenues or Ria*** L2O sits in the Belden-Stratford building next to the Lincoln Park Zoo.  This mostly residential building (hotel rooms are also available) has a brownstone, doorman style that reminds me of old apartment buildings featured in New York movies. I liked the building and its look though L2O's dining room is not in the same theme / style.  It is a modern space though there are some throwback touches like the beige leather chairs, light colored wood paneling and dark brown tables.  Unlike Jar, it is not a great updated take on throwback decor though.  While almost everything at Jar feels like the right color, the right size and the right placement, which gives the room a real tone, L2O's dining room feels like a room with a bunch of just okay choices, making it an okay dining room but not a great one. L2O is a fine dining restaurant (it has 3 Michelin Stars though the head chef has moved on) where strong attention is paid to everything (including the bread). There was a wide assortment of bread, but the best pieces were the buttery, crispy and flaky rosemary croissant, the strong bacon flavored epi, and a crusty and chewy baguette. The amuses were okay.  The first was a salmon mousse topped with a cucumber gelee and steelhead roe; it was decent.  The second amuse was a mini lobster roll, which was a nice presentation though I wish there would have been more of an intense flavor to go along with it. I did the tasting menu, which had a focus on seafood. And despite being in Chicago, a few of the seafood dishes really stood out.  The Maine lobster with smoked foie gras was very good. The lobster was nicely soft while the foie gras was creamery, buttery and rich.  The sides of asparagus and chanterelles were also good. The scallop (baked in its own shell with black truffle) was very moist and had a good flavor though I prefer a seared scallop. The tuna tartar was wrapped in avocado and was fresh though it lacked the heat that often accompanies Southern Californian tartars.  Instead, it was served with caviar and the salty flavor was a good substitute for the heat. The hamachi with yuzu and tapioca pearls reminded me in texture, sear and flavor of hamachi at Japanese restaurants.  It was fine, but I wish it was more creative and distinct. The Maryland Blue Crab with veal gelee, lemon and basil was the weakest dish.  The blue crab was good (though it was a small portion).  The other flavors did not really stand out and this was needed since it was a mostly soft dish with few contrasting textures. The Wagyu beef was good.  It looked kind of plain, but the beef had a very crispy and flavorful sear.  It was also tender and mostly juicy on the inside.  The sauce was buttery and good.  The fondant potatoes were okay.  I would have preferred them more tender.  The king trumpet mushroom was great though (intense and satisfying flavor). The desserts lacked boldness, but they were pleasing.  The lime and yuzu sorbet was cool and refreshing and so was the raspberry soup and mascarpone, which had a sweet (but not too syrupy) flavor. The prailine souffle looked great and had a strong prailine flavor.  The accompanying hazelnut anglaise also had a good flavor.  The souffle texture was close to perfect though it was a little too moist. Service was very good.  It was very profressional and polite, but the staff was also personable, which helped cut the stuffiness.  I felt the personable service kind of separated L2O from Alinea and Avenues (great service there as well but a little too stiff for my taste). In terms of pricing, the tasting menus (they do a seasonal and a singular, which I had) were about the same prices as Ria and Avenues.  I would say though that the food was noticeably better at those other two restaurants. L2O is a nice fine dining restaurant, but I think it lacks the incredibly fresh produce of Californian places (Providence, Baume, The Restaurant at Meadowood) as well as the creativity and contemporary flair of its Chicago competition (Avenues, Ria).

2011-08-09,5.0,"You know it's a fancy restaurant when they bring you a box of tissues on a silver tray after you sneeze.   We haven't visited Alinea's yet, the only other restaurant in Chicago besides L2O that has a three-star Michelin rating. My opinion might change after we try Alinea, but for now I would say that L2O deserves the three stars. (Charlie Trotter's still deserves three stars, too, in my opinion, but that's a different review.) L2O is located in the Belden-Stratford Hotel on Lincoln Park West and features very simple, yet elegant, contemporary decor. Since this was an anniversary dinner, they seated us in our own private little alcove with a white onyx table. We had an early reservation, so we actually had the restaurant to ourselves for a while.  The menu is mostly seafood-based, so this is the place to visit if you really enjoy fish. (Or even if you don't -- the way they prepare seafood here, you'll probably like it anyway.) You can choose various dishes from a four-course Prix Fixe menu (which consists of a cold appetizer, a warm appetizer, a main entree, and a dessert). They also have three different tasting menus with optional wine pairings. They have quite a good fresh-baked bread selection, too, but don't fill up on too many of those, since you want to save room for the main courses. We both went for the Singular luxury ingredient tasting menu with wine pairings. Some of the highlights from our meal were the hand-harvested Maine scallops, which came to the table still in their shells with baked pastry crusts around them (which our server cut away before she removed the scallops from the shells), and the A11 Wagyu Australian beef, which is the second tenderest grade of this beef. You hardly needed a knife to cut it!  As for the wines, they were mostly white because of the nature of the menu. We're usually red wine people, but the hamachi course came with a 2009 Peter Michael Belle Cote Sonoma County Chardonnay that was so good (not too buttery or oaky) that we're going to have to try to find some for our own bar.  Like all high-scale restaurants, this place is very big on visual details and formal presentation. The service is very intimate. They give you a hot towel for your hands as soon as you sit down. They wheel up little wooden carts next to your table that contain all of the tableware they need for the various courses, which helps them serve you in a timely manner. The server explains the ingredients of each dish, along with how the undertones in any wine pairings will complement each dish. And our main server, Jane, really did bring me a box of tissues on a silver tray (which was kind of embarrassing, but very nice of her) when I suffered one of my infamous sneezing fits. She also replaced my napkin, which was good since I had desecrated it with snot. We left there with two souvenirs -- a personalized menu and one of the shells from our scallop entree (washed first, of course), which is now displayed in our home bar. Definitely one of my top five dining experiences.",0.9912,0.882,0.095,0.024,0.4563508597883597

2011-07-31,5.0,"@RestaurantL20 was all that I had expected it to be and more! My husband has been itching to dine at L2O since he saw the ""No Reservations"" episode. We decided to put our mouth where we've been salivating and treat ourselves in conjunction with the celebration of our anniversary.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, it is quite an experience dining at L2O. We had reservations at 5:30pm and finished our meal at about 8:30pm. We prepared ourselves and knew that we would be in for a marathon of good eats. My husband had the singular tasting menu (6 course menu) and I had the summer tasting menu (8 course menu). It was delicious! Of our tasting menus combined, our favorites were: amouse-bouche of lobster tail meat on a brioche, hand dived maine scalloped (that was opened table side!), oxtail tortellini in a ginger and beef consomme and the tuna tartare. I also loved my salmon. As everyone else had mentioned, their tray of endless bread is AMAZING! All of the bread was in bite-size portions. Their milk bread, bread twist with bacon and rosemary croissant were delicious. I would love to have the rosemary croissant everyday if I could!  Their dessert is just as amazing but I barely had enough room to finish off the orange marmalade souffle. It just wouldn't fit anywhere else in my belly. From a public health standpoint, my husband loved that the servers had handled the utensils with care. For every dish, we were given new silverware which helped keep the flavors of each dish from being muddled. The servers gave such incredible effort. My husband and I have never gone to a $$$ let alone a $$$$ listed restaurant before and were glad to have experienced such a pleasant atmosphere at L2O. The servers made us feel comfortable. My only criticism is some of the dishes on the summer tasting portion were a bit heavy handed on the salt. The second dish is a salt cod with potato fingerling emulsion. I could eat that potato fingerling emulsion by the spoonful but the emulsion was salty and the salt cod made it even taste saltier. Following that, I had the english peas with parmesan and lavendar. I thought the english peas were good but again, it was very salty and with the parmesan. The sweetness of the lavendar foam helped cut the salt a bit. I mentioned that I loved my salmon but didn't enjoy the soy sauce as much as that also overpowered my palette. However, my salmon was cooked perfectly (I've never seen a salmon cooked medium-rare, but this was REALLY medium-rare, yum!).

The food presentation was sometimes great, sometimes eh. For the most part I just found the food to be salty, and sometimes it had a strong fishy flavor, but nothing unique. Save for the desert, which was really spectacular, and the bread, which was tasty. The best thing about the restaurant is the fish tank next to the toilet. It doesn't have any fish in it, but it does have some little water creatures you can watch running around while you do your thing. The most annoying thing about going here was my boyfriend left his credit card behind when paying the bill, and nobody from L2O called to tell him they had his card. They took his phone number when he made the reservation, the least they could do was let him know they had his credit card. He was visiting from out of the country, so not having his credit card was kind of a big deal. When we figured out 2 days later that it was still at the restaurant, and called to inquire if they had it, they didn't even apologize or anything. They were very matter of fact that they will allow him to pick up the card, but weren't particularly nice or courteous about it. I was surprised. Even when I worked at Circuit City in high school, if someone left their credit card behind, we did more to get it back to them and were more apologetic and courteous about it than these folks.",0.9888,0.799,0.156,0.045,0.5268817204301076

2011-07-21,5.0,"for our 3 year anniversary, my wife carrie and returned to l2o and this time booked one of the tatami rooms.  upon arriving right on time for our 8:15 reservation, carrie and i were greeted by a friendly young woman dressed in a kimono. the woman, who turned out to be our server, led us through the amazing dining room, up a short flight of stairs, and had us sit down on two wooden blocks to remove our shoes before entering the tatami room  the tatami room is a small fully private room with two sliding doors (one for our server and one for us) and a low floor level table made of yellow cedar. diners sit on japanese tatami mats, but there is a great back support as well as a cutout for your feet, so it is extremely comfortable.  with our menu preselected by the chef, drinks were the only decision we needed to make. as usual, cocktails were our first order of business. my choice was the ginger mint julep, made with evan williams single barrel vintage bourbon, ginger beer, and fresh mint. being a lover of ginger beer and bourbon, this cocktail was a hit for me. the only problem was the excess of ice, which dilute the flavor rather quickly. i would have preferred the drink to have been served ""up"". carrie's drink, the mediterranean breeze, featuring grey goose le citron, limoncello, and thyme. this was another successful offering, and i commented that i may have actually preferred hers. in addition to the cocktails, we also opted to split the available wine pairings. this was more than enough wine for both of us, and i (let alone carrie) would have had a hard time trying to keep up had we gone with the full pours.  what followed was an incredible parade of japanese inspired dishes featuring mostly exotic seafood as well as foie and wagyu course.  overall, our experience in l2o's tatami room was wonderful. having a room to ourselves really made the evening special, and all the food was amazing. our server was also very pleasant and down to earth, and we enjoyed conversing with her about the chicago dining scene as well as l2o's transition after gras' departure. this was a nice contrast from our from our first trip to l2o where our server was comically rigid and aloof, and did not make us feel very comfortable. while it is hard to fairly compare this meal to our first one since the dining style as well as menu approach was completely different, i can say that we enjoyed every aspect of this meal more than our first, and would love to come back some day and do it again. pics are in my blog.",0.9979,0.797,0.176,0.027,0.5022582972582972

2011-06-30,5.0,"My wife and I went to L2O for my birthday on June 25, 2011.  It was a fantastic experience and the dinner service by Aaron was impeccable.  We both found the restaurant to be modern and plush in decor.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The meal (including drinks and wine) was expensive but acceptable for a special occasion.  The service started with a few small chef's bites (salmon mousse and a miniature lobster roll) and then we both enjoyed the Seasonal Tasting Menu ($148).  The bread service was great and I particularly liked the bacon bread, milk bread and mini croissants.  I could have eaten the bacon bread for dinner too (I'm a carbo-holic) - it was sooo good.  The best dishes on the tasting menu were the Oxtail Ravioli with Morels and the Salt Cod in Potato Emulsion.  The Foie Gras with pickled Rhubarb was also delicious.   For dessert, the highlight was the Souflee with Orange Marmalade.  The Mango Sorbet palate cleanser was also tangy and a bit bittersweet.   Aaron was our waiter for the dinner and he was absolutely fantastic.  Every dish was explained to us and every reasonable wish was catered to.  I have never had better service then what he and the rest of the team at L2O provided at any restaurant during my entire life. Overall, the restaurant was opulent without being pretentious and stuffy.  The service was stated, but not clingy or overbearing.  Also, the chairs were comfy - which is important as the meal lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes.  L2O is a great pick for a special occasion, or every evening if you've just won the lotto.",0.9967,0.77,0.215,0.015,0.6312111801242235
2011-06-30,5.0,"SHORT VERSION: excellent food, classically prepared, amazing service. Go here. LONG VERSION: I was out in Chicago attending a conference and Hubby and I decided to make a mini-vacation out of it. Since it was such a last minute decision, we didn't have the opportunity to score reservations at Alinea so we decided to try L2O instead.  While the food is what you expect of a restaurant of this caliber, it was the service that made the experience so memorable. Our server was a lovely gentleman by the name of Aaron and he was gracious, unpretentious and an absolute delight. I commented to my husband early on that Aaron was perhaps the best server we've ever had in an establishment of this level and later found out that he himself is a graduate of the famed CIA in New York. That explains it all. His description of the dishes was fluid, polished and concise and you could tell that he truly enjoyed what he was talking about and not just some server reciting ingredients from memory.  Hubby had the Spring tasting (8 courses) and I had the Luxury tasting (6) courses. I also opted to have them add in a cheese course for me, and hubby added a course of the a11 wagyu tartare. Everything was tasty, but my opening course of Oscietra caviar with hirame and preserved lemon was out of this world. I could have eaten that all night long without complaint. Everything else that followed was also wonderful, but I'll spare you the course play-by-play and simply tell you to experience it for yourself. I found L2O to be the most wonderfully accommodating restaurant I've dined at, to date. I have an unusual allergy to unprocessed alcohols and upon mentioning at other restaurants, I'm usually relegated to drinking water for the rest of the evening. However, instead of seeing restrictions, Aaron saw an opportunity and recommended the most refreshing mint lemonade and I found it delightful and thoroughly enjoyed it. Later on in the evening, it dawned on me to perhaps request a tea-pairing with my meal in lieu of a wine pairing, and again Aaron was gracious and accommodating and consulted the sommelier before discussing with me the recommended teas (which were wonderful).  Overall, Hubby and I left stuffed to the gills and genuinely satisfied with the overall experience. If ever in Chicago, we'll be back for sure.",0.9947,0.845,0.144,0.011,0.501083176083176

2011-06-20,3.0,"SHORT VERSION: After a few rather disappointing meals at this and other Michelin rated spots, first I must say that a restaurant may get great reviews by critics but the best way to truly judge a place is to go for yourself. Alas, Michelin thus far has proven itself unreliable in my book.  Under no stretch of the imagination could I see L2O deserving all three of the stars it received. MAYBE two stars. It merits a return visit but ONLY because there is no way service could consistantly be as bad as what we experienced.  LONG VERSION: Continuing on my Michelin star restaurant quest and admitting up front that this review is biased based on comparison to the other Michelin star restaurants at which I have dined.  See all reviews of the list here yelp.com/list/michelin-s… Most relevant comparisons: Alinea (cost, presentation, length of meal), Ria (Chef from L2O plus staff from Ria would be a PHENOMENAL restaurant), Spiaggia (personality of the staff), Naha (decor) Food: 4.5 - Bread was awesome, especially the milk bread and bacon filled yumminess they served (Note: bread is better at Girl and the Goat) - Food was really amazing. Every course of the 8 course tasting menu was fantastic, well prepared and presented. Good looking plating but not so much emphasis on appearance that the food is crappy or cold. The chef rocks (but the house staff fails)  - Wine pairings ok but definitely not stellar. Better wine pairings for less at Ria and sadly, we never even saw the somollier. Further, our server not only did not know how to pronounce the wine but she really did not have a clue why the wine worked well with each course. Service: 2 Abysmal. Amateur. SOMEONE IMPORTANT was off that night. Honestly, there is no way this place could be this amateur on a regular basis. The four of us have been to dozens of the world's best restaurants ... Le Bernadin, Le Bec Fin, Ria, etc ... so we know good service. And this was not good service. Out of 8 courses, only one was clearly explained. We sometimes waited ages for water refills and replacement linen napkins. For desert, one of my friends had cheese while the rest of us had the souffle from the tasting menu. Her cheese arrived with our desert wine. We waited and waited and drank the wine and shared the cheese. then the souffles came out. It was the TASTING MENU. Were they surprised we were having the dessert on the tasting menu? Sommelier was absent and server could not begin to describe wines And NONE of the staff seemed to have a personality. There was nothing friendly about any of them. (Actually, the two women at the host station were very friendly but besides poiting me to the restrooms, that did not do much for me.) Decor: 3 Felt like I was in a hotel lobby restaurant. Boring with a few hanging things to spice it up and give semi-privacy. Clean and elegant, but boring. The Tatami room concept was ODD. At around 10pm, after we had been there for about 3 hours, we started seeing women in kimonos. They were greeting people at the host station and taking them to tables right near us. And occasionally they were taking them to a side room. We finally asked and they explained this was a private dining experience in the Japenese style. I dont get that AT ALL as there is no link to the restaurant. Value: 3 Same price range as Alinea but overall package nowhere near as memorable. For 4 people, our bill including tip was $1300+.  Overall : 3 I suspect that this was a very off night for L2O and the food alone would make it worth you trying it out. It merits a return visit because there is no way service could consistantly be as bad as what we experienced. However, it is too expensive for what you get and there are at least five other restaurants I would go to first before returning to L2O.

2011-06-02,3.0,"I enjoyed my dining experience at L2O, but 3 Michelin stars is a stretch.  Based on my experiences at other 3 star restaurants (French Laundry, Robuchon in Vegas), L2O's food was not as great.  The food is good, but not 3 star good.  Service, though, is very good and almost on par with FL and Robuchon.  My only gripe is that my server was very soft spoken to the point where I couldn't hear chunks of what he said.  Perhaps I should've just asked him to speak up.   Ambience wise, they try to go for a relaxing, zen theme, but I felt like I was dining at a First Class Lounge in an airport. Another non-food related thing, but very pivotal to my experience was that we experienced a 40 minute blackout while dining there.  It was quite interesting, but L2O was very good at keeping us informed of what was happening and also provided complimentary, delicious bubbly and other tidbits as we waited for the power to come back on so our food could be cooked.   Alas, to the food... Hamachi starter was okay.  The flavors didn't resonate with me, but I think it's just a personal thing.  Very well prepared otherwise. Tuna tartare was good.  One of the better dishes. Pass on the Loire Valley White Asparagus.  They give you 2 pieces and one of the pieces was really hard to cut and bite into because of some texture issue.  It was strange.  It's basically gloried asparagus with fancy sauce, nothing impressive. Striped Bass was tasty, but I've had equally great fish at non-Michelin star restaurants.   Praline souffle was delicious.  A little on the sweet side, but I loved it. Wine by the glass selection is fairly limited, but the white and complimentary prosecco I had was yummy.  On the other hand, my boyfriend who did the wine pairing with his meal, was not impressed by the pairings.    My feeling is that L2O is very big on the sauces that come with their dishes.  Though all the courses were perfectly executed, most of the dishes weren't particulary exciting or something I was so amazed by.  It was a solid meal with good food and very good service, but I don't think it's worth the price tag.",0.998,0.685,0.243,0.072,0.5524052478134112

2011-05-07,2.0,"Pretty disappointed.  Went there with 3 friends per the recommendation of one of my best buddies.  I would say overall the food was good, but the value is poor and it didn't feel special the way my dining experiences did at Alinea, Henri and some other top spots in Chicago.  My wife and 2 friends did the 4 course I did the 8 course tasting.  When we ordered they said that was fine, but there was one time mid meal where my wife and friends had not been served anything for 90 minutes!  I actually said to the waiter ""I'm sorry I'm not trying to be difficult but my friends haven't eaten anything in 90 minutes""- his response was ""well it really makes it difficult when one person orders the 8 course tasting menu and everyone else gets the 4.""  I then said ""that would have been really valuable information when we were ordering."" He proceeded to walk away and barely pay attention to us the rest of the meal.  So... no I would never go back to L20 despite some of the food being quite decent.  I would rate the 8 courses as follows: Big Eye Tuna= B (great quality tuna, nice presentation, but badly needed some kind of sauce) Scallop= A (best thing we ate) White Asparagus= B+ (good flavor but not enough, it was literally 2 pieces of asparagus!) Foie Gras= C (I think this was the worst thing we ate.  They really should give you brioche or something to balance the texture of the foie gras) Tortellini= B+ (tasty, but hard to mess up tortellini) Halibut= B (pretty bland, but well cooked and fresh) Strawberry Sorbet= B (it was fine, but it's sorbet) Souffle= C (I thought it was lousy, but my friends said it was OK... I may just not be a big souffle lover) So... beautiful place, extensive wine menu, decent food, but not for $250/person... spend a little extra dough and go to Alinea... now that is the best restaurant in Chicago!!!",0.9657,0.741,0.155,0.105,0.5006469979296067

2011-04-25,1.0,"Ha. You can't hide behind three Michelin stars.  The evening started fine. An amuse with oyster from Vancouver, cauliflower and jalapeno. Undoubtedly the best constructed dish of the evening. Layers of flavors and textures that really worked well and as delicious as it was unexpected. The first course, Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna * hamachi, yuzu-soy, chives was very good. Two textures in a checkerboard pattern gave the impression of a battle between the textures in a bowl that looked like a coliseum. Very good. The next course was Hand Cut Tagliolini * lobster-uni emulsion, oscietra caviar. It was fine...rich and unctuous. Next came the moment of the evening. A waitress came by with a plate with two fat white asparagus. She poured something over them and set them down and explained they were a gift from the kitchen. I told her thanks but I don't eat asparagus. She removed them from the table. The manager (or somebody with apparent authority) immediately grabbed the plate from her, sat them back down in front of me and explained to me they were ""complimentary"". Gee...free! I guess I should wolf em down. What a fucking asshole. I don't care if they crawled under the table and blew me. I didn't want the fucking asparagus. Was there less respect for me or the waitress?  The rest of the dinner didn't really matter. I took a bit of this and that, had the espresso and paid the full bill. I left a good tip for the waitress but I will never...ever...go back to L2O. Three Michelin stars cannot hide a deep streak of assholishness that seems to live happily at L2O. I'm going off topic just a bit to close this out. I was at ABaC in Barcelona the week before last and had one of the best meals in recent memory. ABaC gets one Michelin star. There is no way L2O, even without the poor experience, approaches ABaC. American restaurants get a pass when it comes to Michelin ratings. Having been to many Michelin starred places, the only place in the US that I believe earns a true three-star rating would be Alinea. If L2O is in Europe, they get no stars. The whole Michelin rating system has become corrupted with their North American ratings. (Robuchon in Vegas at three stars? Really?) What a shame.",0.9847,0.818,0.134,0.048,0.39269841269841266
2011-04-17,4.0,"Before I even start, I think it's clear that I look for different things in a restaurant than the Michelin raters do. Those one stars I've enjoyed, such as Tru, Sixteen, and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchard, strike me as better meals at better prices, than what I've enjoyed at 2 and 3 star establishments like Trotter's, Alinea, and now L2O.  Anyway. Our party of four spent a Saturday night here, with two of us selecting the seasonal tasting, and two of us selecting the four course prix fixe (myself included). Big points for allowing the mix - while it may have made pacing a bit odd, it's nice to have that flexibility. Besides, they brought the prix fixe diners empty plates and extra silverware, which were then whisked away as tasting course diners finished their courses. I felt these courses, while light, airy, and less filling, were perhaps lacking in substance.  The starter of my prix fixe was peekytoe crab in a little dome of shaved avocado, surrounded by jalapeno gellee. The jalapeno was fun in the cold, liquidy gellee, with real heat. Not too much to cover the delicate crab and avocado, but it was there. The crab was succulent, chilled, with excellent flavor and tossed in a very light aoli. Really good, light, crisp dish, with a good combination of flavors. However, items listed on the menu for this dish such as meyer lemon and granny smith apple were either covered up or lacking - I didn't find them in the dish. More on this later.  Next, an asparagus gazpacho with cream and a bit of sherry - again, excellent and refreshing, although not as light between the thick soup and the cream. Still very very good. My next course was the diver scallops, served seared with a slice of caramelized cauliflower (more on this later) on each one, and with passionfruit seeds and a vanilla fume blanc. Outstanding scallops, with no grit, good seared crust and nicely paired with the cauliflower. The fume blanc had plenty of vanilla, which was a nice aromatic touch with the seafood, and finally, those seeds provided a little crunchy counterpoint. Very very good.  Finally, my entree was the wagyu beef and Maine lobster - substantial up charge, but why not splurge. The beef was incredible...melt in your mouth tenderloin, with enough tooth to make it interesting, spectacular marbling, cooked a bit south of medium rare. Truly exceptional. a hint of lime zest on top was a great additional flavor with the beef. It wasn't the most flavorful beef ever, but I guess I don't expect it in better cuts, especially from cattle not allowed to move much. The lobster, however, while tasty, was a bit rubbery. Perhaps overdone? Both the claw and tail were the same way. Accompanying the decadent surf and turf were some grilled mushrooms (more on this later) and little lincoln log looking pieces of potato, with everything drizzled with a big of foie gras truffle sauce...really rich and great on both beef and lobster. I do want to say that either the plate wasn't hot enough or the food sat - I didn't take overlong to eat this, but it was near cold by the time I finished.  Finally, a light complimentary cucumber grainte was a good palette cleanser before my salted caramel mousse, served in a chocolate egg and with malt grainte (described as ""snow"" on the menu) and coffee foam. Really excellent, rich dessert - don't miss this guy. None went to waste. Follow that with an outstanding salty, citrusy espresso, plus complimentary little vanilla cakes, cooked in beeswax for a crisp crust, and liquid filled banana rum bon bons...I'm getting full.  More on this later? The menu was oddly inconsistent. Items listed on the menu (meyer lemon, granny smith apple) were missing from dishes, to my taste, and items not mentioned (jalapeno gellee, grilled mushrooms, caramelized cauliflower) were present. In my case, not upsetting, but what if I ordered something for those flavors, or didn't like the extra I received? In cuisine where every flavor is important, I'd prefer to be fully informed as to my choices.  Service was excellent, not too stuffy, but very helpful and semi-coordinated, like my first visit to Tru. Pacing suffered, but I will gladly blame that on the appreciated option of mixed tasting and prix fixe selections. We even got a tour of the kitchen and private rooms after dinner by a very friendly staff member, which was a cool touch.  Let's summarize. I never got my ""oh my god"" 5 star moment. I'm a bit puzzled by what I'll call menu inaccuracies. And honestly, the lobster being overcooked and entire entree cooling too rapidly makes me wonder what went wrong there. This is a really strong 4 star, a really goodmeal, but...there were missteps and something was missing that I've experienced at restaurants with smaller bills. So I can't call this 5 stars. But it was a very enjoyable evening.",0.9993,0.765,0.192,0.043,0.550943396226415

2011-04-04,4.0,"I celebrated my birthday at L20 last year when Laurent Gras was the chef. I must say, back then I was absolutely impressed and this is coming from a girl who celebrated one of her birthdays at Charlie Trotter's infamous ""Kitchen Table"" with Charlie Trotter himself overseeing the arrangements and personally greeting my guest and me. That was certainly a night to remember. Now back to L20.  As I said, when Laurent Gras was the chef last year (March 2010) the food at this establishment was pure artwork. I never saw so many people photograph their food. Big tables were photographing each others meal. I myself couldn't help but pause and admire the beauty and creativity of my food before sinking my teeth into it. And when I finally tasted the food, I had died and gone to heaven. Every dish tastefully lived beyond its expectation. I was so impressed that I told my fiancee that L20 was better than Charlie Trotter's. My baby had a heart attack. I left the restaurant with the intention of returning--someday.  This year my baby asked me where did I want to dine for my b-day. L20 rolled off my tongue before my head could conjure the thought. ""L20"" he said. I eagerly replied ""without a doubt that is where I want to celebrate my birthday"". And that someday finally came. Embrace yourself.  Laurent Gras is no longer at L20 and sadly you would know it. This time around the ""WOW"" factor was very much missing. The food seemed to have lost it's creativity. It is no more impressive than all the other gourmet places we have dined. And as for taste, it is definitely well above average but not worthy of 3 Michelen stars. I have to honestly say that with Laurent Gras gone and taking the ""Wow"" factor with him, L20 is certainly no longer better that Charlie Trotter's. How could L20 get a better rating than Charlie Trotter's? I had to ask the waiter. ""So is Laurent the chef here tonight? ""The waiter replied ""Laurent is no longer with us. I believe he relocated to New York. The assistant chef is now the executive Chef"". Well that explains everything. I asked him if he was still the chef when they got their 3 stars. The waiter replied, ""He came back for the event"". And there you have it. How L20 got 3 stars.  Still a great dining experience just not worth 3 Michelen stars.

I also tried the orange souffle. With tip, it came to $200/person (no wine; 2 cocktails/person).

Uni!! One of my favorite foods....yummm!! Highly recommend the following: - Smoked Salmon - smokey but fresh...hard to explain. I wish I had a bucketful with some of the accompanying smoked gelee. - Japanese Shimaaji - our server explained it was a kind of mackerel but hubby wanted to try it.  It did not look like any mackerel I've seen and the it was perfectly cured in miso.  Rich but not oily. - Handcut Tagliolini - I ordered this because I love noodles and I love lobster, uni and caviar.  The combination of the three made me as giddy as a school girl. - Tai Snapper - another of hubby's picks.  The green balls of curry frozen in liquid nitrogen were fascinating but made the dish so interesting...not to mention, delicious.  There was so much going on on the plate, it was like an adventure. Other small touches that make this place 3-Michelin star worthy: - All napkins are replaced (not just refolded)  - They are downright anal about the placement of certain things on the table - The servers time their placement of food in front of you.  It's cute and so...awe-inspiring - When I asked for a menu to take with me, our server not only got me a menu but he only got the dessert menu and slid them both into a beautiful L2O folder/sleeve thing. - Our server literally saw us out of the hotel and into our car.

They were gracious enough to allow us to do two separate tastings, which some places will not let you do (everyone at the table has to have the exact same thing, which makes it much easier on the kitchen).  Hubby had the winter tasting (8 courses) and I had the luxury tasting (6 courses).  While some may think it's weird that twice he had a course and I didn't, I was more than happy to steal a bite or two and enjoy our sake as I waited for my next course. I won't give you a play-by-play of our menu since it changes somewhat, but know that everything was absolutely delicious and presented perfectly.  The foie gras was soooo good (boy we're glad Chicago lifted the foie gras ban!) and the fish was fresh, as if it had been swimming around in the ocean a few hours earlier.

2011-02-20,4.0,"Awesome food. But we're not chemistry class meal fans.  L20's online menu says they have a prix fixe alternative, that you do not have to order the 8 or 10 course tasting menus. That was a key issue for us. We wanted to try this Michelin 3-star restaurant, but we don't enjoy the minute portions of overlong tasting menus, nor the efforts to serve a dozen different dishes as one meal. On arrival we were told for Valentine's Day (even though it was the day before Valentine's Day) only tasting menus were available.  We conformed, went with the ten course seasonal tasting menu, and really enjoyed the food. The overattentive service was a bit much, with the constant interruption of dishes leaving the table, then new silverware being set oh-so-precisely for the next course, then the arrival and emotionless memorized explanation of that course. If this was our one meal out for the year and we came to observe a food demonstration, it might have worked. If we had thoughts of relaxing and enjoying being together, forget it.  What really was disappointing were the gaps between several courses. The kitchen was obviously having its problems. Some courses came perfectly timed, with nice gaps between courses. But later in the meal we sat and sat waiting for another course. It was 40 minutes between the empty dishes leaving after course #6 and the arrival of course #8. When I mentioned this lag and the fact we simply wanted to move on to the souffle and be gone, I was told I was wrong about the time gap. Sorry, I guess I haven't yet learned how to tell time on my I-phone. So much for friendly service.  The food was spectacular. Chef Gras' influence is still dominant. We especially liked the salted cod with creamy potato and caviar, the foie gras with blood orange and fennel, and the halibut with a green curry. The Korean barbecue tenderloin of beef was the only disappointment, tasteless like cube steak from the grocery store. Although some portions were small and had too much of the chemistry class construction (there will be a test at the end of the course to see which of the twelve ingredients you recognized in your single bite), most of the courses were large enough to allow a full tasting of the dishes and recognition of the main ingredient. The problem remained that we came for a meal, not a global tour of all things food.  I do also need to comment on the wine list. It was huge, and it had a great range of choices, both in types of wines and in prices. We splurged a bit, but didn't need to.  The decor and acoustics were also big pluses.

2011-02-20,5.0,"Dining at L2O is an overwhelming and hedonistic experience that is marked with food that is delicious, avant garde, and perhaps a bit over the top as far as culinary aggressiveness.  Overall, the meal contained just the right amount of molecular gastronomy for an intriguing but mostly accessible experience, while only occasionally (over 10 courses + 3 amuse bouches) leaving me questioning the chef's decisions.  On to the highlights: Fingerling potato puree served over salt cod with an ossetra caviar garnish - combined a delicate potato flavor with bold, ocean saltiness and the perfect creamy texture to form what may have been our favorite dish. Lobster bisque - big pieces of lobster and a creative scallop dumpling served in thick creamy bisque with a touch of creme fraiche.  Perfectly done lobster and absurdly full, rich broth, with a really neat temperature contrast in your mouth between the hot bisque and the cold cream. Forest mushrooms - This may have been the best plate of mushrooms I've ever experienced.  Would that I could remember all the different types of fungus served in this brown butter-lemongrass broth, but suffice to say that each one had its own subtle taste, its own eccentric appearance, and that each went swimmingly in the broth, which in my mind tasted exactly like the essence of umami, and infected each bite deliciously with its full, bold flavor. After six mostly fantastic courses that start to fill you up, the 10-course tasting menu continues with the proteins:   -A thin cut of halibut, served with two delicious citrus emulsions on your plate, and presented with a cilantro meringue, served atop a fuming bowl of liquid nitrogen.  If you've watched too much Top Chef it may sound even a little overdone, but witnessing this for the first time, I felt it was a very impressive presentation.  Oddly, the plate included a cumin ""cracker"" that was an extremely strong flavor which I couldn't reconcile with the rest of the fairly delicate plate. -Salmon, rubbed with an african spice blend, perfectly cooked, and unbelievably delicious.  Served with what I felt was an extremely awkward accompaniment of a small daikon filled with a sweet syrup, and a small cheesy, puffy item under a piece of microgreens.  Despite the salmon being so fantastic, I didn't get this course at all. -""Korean BBQ"", essentially a piece of wagyu marinated in ginger, soy and garlic, with some dressed up classic korean accompaniments like kimchi and thinly sliced pickled jalapeno.  This course went together quite nicely and the beef was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We had an 8:45pm seating that led us to around 12:30am at this point in the meal.  What followed were a palate cleanser, two desserts, and a dessert amuse bouche, that were all tasty, if challenging to fit into the little remaining real estate in my stomach.  However, they were presented impeccably, especially the Grand Marnier soufflet. Presentation was key throughout here, and we were blown away by the sleek, thin lines and dark modern decor that characterized the restaurant.  The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is better, and though there are many, many ways to spend $150+ on a delicious tasting menu in Chicago, I like to think that I'll make it back to L2O someday.",0.9992,0.745,0.227,0.028,0.6535111512959612

I figured my husband was just going to skip valentine's day this year, but he said we should go out for dinner this weekend to make up for missing last weekend.  He told me that we were going to Texas de brazil but then he surprised me and took me here instead!  We were lucky enough to reserve a tatami room and we had the twelve course dinner. We started off with a cocktail and split half a bottle of sake (nanbu bijin , southern beauty). Everything about the meal was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

2011-02-14,4.0,"We came here for my birthday dinner.  We splurged and had the Singular tasting menu.  Everything was very tasty except for 2 of the dishes.  The Poulet Albufera was visually unappealing and didn't taste any better than it looked. The consistency of the Spot Prawn was also not to my liking.  The prawn itself was from Italy and was indeed very sweet. But somehow the other items with the prawn made the overall consistency of the prawn unappetizing.  And for those who are unsure what I'm talking about, somehow the foam and other items around the prawn when eaten together, felt like I was eating sea urchin....that type of consistency. Hands down favorite dish was the kindai toro with osetra caviar. They did not skimp on the caviar (which happens to be my favorite), and they provided a ""mother of pearl"" spoon to boot.  I was super happy to see the spoon because so many places don't give you that spoon and the stainless steel flatware destroys the taste altogether.  Very happy about that attention to detail. Very sad to hear that Laurent Gras is no longer the chef there, but was still happy to have tried the place.

2011-02-12,4.0,"I don't consider myself a stranger to fine food, but I do consider myself a stranger to dining on the level that L2O provides.  It is more than a mere dinner out, it is an experience - one that requires at least three hours of commitment by the diners, and a entire team of servers, sommeliers, hosts, and a mysterious back of the house from which divine food is served to bring that experience to fruition. Last night, I went to L2O with my lady, and it was the first time I've had a dining experience at that level, while I felt as though I've had equal food in some respects. The decor, as mentioned in other reviews, is modern, almost sleek, with wood paneled walls - you would not know it was inside of an almost 100 year old hotel. I found the lack of windows in the place almost a bit disturbing - if we were dining at L2O during the ""GREAT BLIZZARD OF 2011"" just two weeks ago, you'd have no idea while inside.  It's not too dark, although the entrance is.  Tables are spacious, and while we were near other couples, we were not close enough to even hear their conversations. The food certainly lived up to the reputation.  We both chose the 4-course prix fixe menu, as the tasting menus had many non-fish options that I felt would be a waste of money for us.  For the cold course, I opted for the sashimi, and Sarah the peekytoe crab.  You know food is good when you can't do anything but smile with acknowledgment when you put it in your mouth! I have had a lot of sashimi, here and in Japan, and this was probably the freshest and tastiest I've had, ever - in the  mid-west, no less.  Simply perfect fish pieces that were each accompanied by a savory or spicy element.  I was all too glad to share my small portion with Sarah,  because I felt like it would be wrong to deny someone else the greatness of this fish.  For the second course, I chose the Kampachi, and Sarah went for the Scallops.  the scallops were put in front of me first - probably a fireable offense at L2O, but I assured our waitstaff that we were going to share anyway and not to worry about it.  Sarah was quite taken by the Kampachi - I enjoyed it as well, especially the super-light tempura. we both enjoyed the scallops with the passionfruit glaze well enough, but it was not something so groundbreaking that we couldn't imagine having that at another restaurant.  Of course, the quality of the fish and seafood makes a huge difference, so that probably pushes L2O over other seafood joints, but not pushing any envelopes in terms of taste or originality. My main course was the Tai Snapper with deconstructed curry, and Sarah had the Maine lobster which had some butternut squash and pinot noir sauces.  I enjoyed the snapper as well - the curry powder was a great flair, and I'd never had a deconstructed dish - with something like curry, that typically has so many elements, it was a really interesting way of tasting familiar flavors.  The lobster was great - I jokingly told Sarah and our server that it was a typical Maine way of eating lobster.  The butternut squash was a great touch, and the meat's richness along with the squash's were not overpowering, but more complimentary.   Dessert was souflee for me, and a mousse - egg with crystalized vanilla for Sarah.  Souflee was made with Grand Marnier and orange - perfectly light, and  went down too easily.  The portions in general for the prix fixe were hearty - and we felt comfortably full when we left, but not heavy.  As far as the experience, as a whole, I was spent at the end of our dinner.  It's one thing to plop yourself in front of the television and eat cheetos for dinner, and another to wear a suit and have people change your silverware every 10 minutes, and pull the table out for you, and listen attentively to the long explanations of what you were about to eat.  With food like L2O's, it's necessary to have the explanations, and I felt no added pretension by this, but having to be ""on"" - not to mention avoid making yourself look like the biggest jackass in the world by spilling a glass or something - for 3 hours can be really exhausting.   When we got back to the hotel, it was late and we were tired, but we had to kind of unwind for a good twenty minutes.  It was almost like a chore - a delicious, expensive chore, but really a trying experience.   Overall, I really enjoyed my night at L2O.  I was ready for it to be over when it was over, but did not feel sick of it or impatient at that point.  It's certainly the kind of place I'd encourage others to try.  I don't think dining like this makes sense to do on a regular basis, unless you're a zillionaire, and I don't think I'd have the funds or desire to dine like that more than a handful of times a year - that said, though, going to L2O will fulfill that once-in-a-while desire that you surely deserve.  One qualm with the place is the price of some of the liquor.  For example, Johnnie Walker black for $15 - an entire bottle can be had for $30!",0.9994,0.774,0.184,0.042,0.5456941959848935

It's seafood heavy, it's unique, experimental and it's dinner as an experience, rather than a meal, in a stately dining cavern that manages to walk the line between aggressively modern and a touch too stuffy. The wine pairings evolved elegantly from a crisp, dry junmaiginjo sake to accompany the hamachi first course, through a series of light and acidic, mostly French whites and finally to a pair of medium-bodied reds to carry the meaty halibut and grilled skirt steak.

2011-01-10,4.0,"I will not describe everything in detail because plenty of others have done that. A lot of my comparisons will be to Alinea because they are the only 3 Michelin star restaurants in Chicago. My overall impression of L20 is that the food and service were as great as expected and it deserves to be considered one of the top few restaurants in Chicago. I dined with my wife and best friend. We all got the singular tasting menu; they each had the wine pairing while I had two glasses of wine by the glass. Our dinner took about 4 hours. Comparisons with Alinea: L20 serves more standard food (less of the molecular gastronomy influence) although of course the dishes were well put together and the flavor combinations were sometimes unique and always very good. I prefer Alinea to L20. Negatives:  1. The wine pairings were good, but if I'm spending $125 for what added up to 3 servings of wine it would be nice to get one or two that were not young wines. Alinea was similar in that respect and I think the wine pairing at L'Astrance (a 3-star in Paris) was so much better because they threw in a couple old wines that really wowed me (although the wine pairing there may have been more expensive). 2. When full, the restaurant was a bit noisier than I would prefer and noisier than Alinea.  3. A couple of the seafood courses did not wow me, which is not good, considering they specialize in seafood.   Positives: 1. Sweetbreads with lobster --- these were by far the best sweetbreads I've had (and I've had plenty at Michelin-starred London & French restaurants). 2. Foie Gras ravioli was incredible, as was the Wagyu beef, and the macadamia nut and carmelized white chocolate souffle. 3. Service was great (of course). We were laughing and having a good time and had lots of questions about food preparations for the waiter so he responded by being less formal than he probably otherwise would have been. I appreciate that. Both sommeliers greeted us and one helped me pick out two good wines by the glass to accompany the meal.",0.9967,0.811,0.179,0.01,0.4928282828282829
2011-01-03,4.0,"I would rank L20 in the top 5 fine dining spots in Chicago. I expected something similar to Le Bernardin and L20 isn't quite as similar as I had hoped. I went there with my girlfriend for the 12 course tasting menu and after we arrived and she reviewed the menu, she decided that she only wanted the 6 course tasting menu. L20 gets HUGE points with me here because they allowed her to do the 6 course while I did the 12. This is very few and far between in the fine dining space. Most restaurants require the entire table to participate in the same tasting menu and this is a big gripe of mine. Over the years, I have become friends with many people that share my interest in food and it's still difficult to get people to spend several hundred dollars on a meal. I greatly appreciate when a restaurant allows members of a table to order tasting menus even when others at the table elect to go another way. I understand the timing is compromised, but when you're willing to spend extravagant amounts of money on food, the restaurant should accommodate you, so cheers to L20 for doing so. The dining room of L20 was great. They completely revamped it from the old Ambria and made it super modern minimalistic. There is plenty of room between tables and the clean crisp design is perfect for the food you are going to be served while dining there. Lighting is perfect, and the ambiance is exactly as you would expect. The service was also spot on. Unlike Alinea and Trotters, your server isn't hovering over your table at all times. I suppose this kind of service has it's fans, but I'm not one of them. I prefer the server to be attentive, but not practically standing next to you throughout the entire meal. The food was just short of amazing at L20. Each course was timed well, presented impeccably, and tasted delicious. There is a wonderful progression throughout the tasting, and the meal ends perfectly with something that is quite unique in Chicago, a souffle service. Each course came out presented like a work of art and looked amazing. It's my opinion that some of the food could have tasted better. It all looked fantastic, but when it came down to taste, I think a few dishes fell short. I tend to review restaurants after some time has past after I ate there. I try to remember the meal because if you remember something much later, it really stood out, and only 3 or 4 courses of the 12 really stood out. I am a dessert whore so I requested to see the regular non-souffle pastry menu, and our server let me add an additional dessert course for an extra charge. Overall, I think the food was prepared excellently, and I would say it fell just short of perfect. I'm comparing L20 to Le Bernardin in New York because it's pretty much the exact same concept, fine dining with a 95% seafood consentration. Had I never dined at Le Bernardin, L20 would probably have scored a 5 star review with me, but for the price, they just aren't quite as good. I have not been back since chef Laurent Gras left the kitchen, but I doubt things may have changed for the better, he seemed like quite the perfectionist and would be a hard act to improve on. Overall, the space at L20 is a 5 out of 5, the service was a 5 out of 5, the food presentation was a 5 out of 5, but taste was only a 4 out of 5. When you're paying that much for food,taste is a big factor, and to many dishes of the 13 I sampled just didn't do much for me. I hate to put a price on these kind of things, but after I paid the bill, I felt that the food just wasn't worth it. L20 was a great expierence, but I doubt I would go back anytime soon. I would reccomend it to any person who appreciates great food, but I would rather go back to Moto or Alinea for the same price or Schwa for half the price.",0.9989,0.791,0.176,0.034,0.504906165729695

The service was not as good as I had hoped. We were completely catered to at Alenia and French Laundry, but here the service at L2O seemed a bit slow. The waiter seemed to be telling us the information on the back of the wine bottle instead of something really memorable about the wine he was serving us with our food. I didn't really like the first couple of courses, but then it seemed to change mid-way through and it was creative and as delicious as I had hoped.  We had read about the chocolate box dessert, and when we found out it wasn't one of the desserts with our menu, the kitchen kindly added it in.

We were trepidacious and considered cancelling, but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. We shouldn't have. I can't express how disappointed we were with the food. First, there was no depth of flavor to any of the dishes. Everything was ate was sub par. Second, the fish was NOT fresh. The two worst courses were the hamachi and the amberjack. The hamachi was definitely past it's best . Not the most pleasant way to enjoy raw fish. I ate better at a neighborhood sushi joint last weekend. The amberjack 'a la plancha' was definitely the worst of all the courses. It was tough, rubbery, flavorless and tasted at least 3 days old.  The wagyu beef was very good, but you know something is really wrong when the best course at a seafood restaurant is the beef. The rest of the courses were completely forgettable. We went for the singular tasting menu and added the wine paring which made for a huge bill. We are no strangers to fine dining and are more than willing to pay for good food.

We have also experienced Trotters, Tru, etc. so we're not new to this level of cuisine. Bottom line: Ambiance is nice, warm earth tones and comfortable. (the website demonstrates this well) The food is stellar. The sommelier on the other hand was a joke. When you're faced with a wine list with hundreds of selections, one simply needs help and guidance to pair things appropriately. The last thing you want to do is spoil an amazingly well thought out and executed dish and ruin it with a bone-head wine pairing. We each chose the 4-course prix fixe and chose to be directed with by-the-glass pairings rather than trying to find a bottle that fits the bill for each of 4 dishes with 4 very different palate directions. The sommelier just didn't get it. ( a chianti reco with a lemongrass/kafir lime curry ???) The pairings that he suggested just didn't hold up to the food on the plate the way they should. Also, why was the same sommelier clearing plates from tables and also SERVING our Salmon baked in clay? He didn't even know how to open the clay. After fumbling with it for a minute he got it open. Elegant? Not so much. A few other things overall lacked in precision but I won't go into them. Note to sommelier: Know your stuff and be firm because we need you. Note to management: Fire your current sommelier. Because at this price, there are no excuses.",0.7996,0.902,0.073,0.025,0.46047705627705626

The first time I came, we ordered off the a la carte menu, and things were okay.  My favorite dish was a pasta with mushrooms and asparagus.  The fish dishes were okay, but not great.  We got one of the souffles for dessert, I believe the grand marnier souffle, and it was decent, but not life changing. The most recent time I came we all got the 12 course tasting menu.  I asked in advance for a vegetarian menu, and was happy that they were willing to create something for me.  However, there were a number of problems with this. First, while some of the dishes were spectacular, a lot of the dishes were not great.  Some were downright bad, including this bizarre tomato sorbet that was too sour and had too many ice crystals.  One of my big concerns was how huge the dishes were.  I think they felt that since they were going to charge me the full cost, they had to justify it, and instead of using better ingredients, they put way too much food on the plate.  For one dish out of twelve, I had a pile of vegetable tempura that would have counted as a meal on its own. I was also really disappointed by how sloppy they were with my vegetarian request.  The amuse-bouche included lobster, and while I do eat fish, I thought it was quite an oversight.  I was also served a marshmallow, and when I asked if it had gelatin, which I do not eat, it was whisked away without a response.

2010-08-17,5.0,"In my opinion, dining at a place like L2O is like having a night at the theater.  We did the four course tasting menu and the well orchestrated meal took over 2.5 hours, it was definitely worth it.  If you come to L2O and the 'million flavors of summer' is on the menu, by all means, order it!  (I think it might have only been 15 or 20 flavors, but it was like nothing I've ever seen before, a gorgeous presentation of multi textures/colors of vegetables.)  I had the lobster bisque and thai snapper for my main dish; also sampling the tuna entree.  The tuna entree is served sashimi style with a large cauldron of broth that the patron cooks at the table.  Then the broth is taken back to the kitchen and noodles are prepared in the broth to serve.  The tuna was so delicious as sashimi it really didn't need to be cooked at all, but the broth had a very good flavor and the noodles were good.  The thai red snapper had a delicate flavor and was cooked perfectly- the only part of this dish that I didn't like was the green apple puffs served on the edge.  They had an unusual curryish flavor that was maybe too bitter for my taste.  The lobster bisque was a bit thinner than some of the bisques that I've had before, but with good flavor and a couple of large pieces of lobster claw at the bottom of the bowl, a nice bonus. Despite the delicious meal, my favorite part (besides the, ahem, cocktails) was the breads and desserts.  Wow, L2O can really do some buns!  We sampled everything, and although I don't recall the different flavors, they were all delicious.  I ordered a peanut butter souffle for dessert and it was scrumptious.  So good, in fact, that I tried to come home and make one the next day.  My souffle failed, miserably, so maybe my only chance for a good souffle is L2O.  Yum!

We also went for it and got the Italian Ossetra Caviar as a starter.  We used to frequent the previous Ambria in the same location and had many really wonderful dinners there, so we definitely had a positive association with the location but this can lead to expectations which can always be trouble. Fortunately the new room, albeit much different from Ambria, was really nice. Very zen and we had a really good seating arrangement which gave us a good view of the entire dining room. The food on both tasting options was really excellent. Lot's of great flavors and variety. I think for my personal tastes the SPRING option really was better for me and the SINGULAR was better for my wife, although we did share along the way and everything was good in one way or another. My only knocks on the place and why it's not getting 5 stars would be service and price. For the price of our evening at L20 there should not be as many slip ups in service as we encountered. The wait staff was really nice and very attentive, in a way I give them 5 stars for relations and 4 on technicalities. Little things like at one point they placed my dish down for my wife and then had switch them around. No big deal of course, I'm no snob on service but we ran in to several of these along the way and for the premium in cost, service should be there along side it. As for the price, it wasn't so much sticker shock as much as it just felt it was all a bit overpriced and that was more on my end. I blame it mostly on the Caviar. Whenever I splurge for the ""fancy"" caviar I always feel a bit underwhelmed when I compare it to the price I paid. Now it really is awesome to eat but I guess I am just not enough of a caviar aficionado (yet?) to appreciate it as much as I feel I should. I will be back and it was a great night.

2010-07-18,5.0,"Truthfully, I only ended up eating at L2O because Alinea was already booked when I was in town for work last week.  My husband had come up to join me for a few days on my business trip, and we made dinner plans with my coworker and her husband, who are huge foodies and incredibly knowledgeable about the Chicago food scene. Even though we were about 15 minutes early for our reservation, we were seated immediately right next to this amazing gold branch sculpture, which became more and more fascinating the deeper we fell into our food comas.  My coworker also recommended that I check out one of the restrooms, which had a snazzy (albeit fish-lacking) aquarium in it. Fine, the decor is gorgeous, and there are opulent but unnecessary accessories in the restrooms, but what about the food?  As I said to my friend, ""O-maz-ing.""  (Har har har.)  Everyone ordered off the four course menu that evening, and it was more than enough food for dinner.  I had the Earl Grey-infused house-smoked salmon (which came with these random ""croutons"" that were really just cubes of garlic bread -- tasty, but random); the lobster bisque with lobster dumpling; halibut with pea, ramp, arugula dumpling (the arugula dumpling was the only disappointing part of that dish), and bacon butter; and for dessert, the manjari, which my husband described as a high end Klondike bar (in the most complimentary of ways).  My dining companions were all impressed with their selections, and one of them was particularly intrigued by the ""Eighteen Flavors of Summer"" (which we jokingly called ""500 Days of Summer""), which I'd love to order myself if I return to the restaurant again. The dishes were incredibly innovative and, most impressively, actually handled Asian fusion skillfully.  As someone who naturally cringes whenever I hear the term ""Asian fusion,"" I was a little skeptical going in, but having seen how L2O integrates Asian flavors into their menu, I'm now a believer that the concept can work. I have to admit that there were a few flaws that with the meal that might have only earned L2O four stars on Yelp, but they certainly earned that fifth star back for the level of service.  My coworker's husband is actually a vegetarian, and the restaurant was incredibly accommodating to his needs, working around their prix fixe menu to make sure he could enjoy each course as much as the rest of us did.  And his dining experience certainly did not suffer -- he was the only one of us to order the aforementioned ""Eighteen Flavors of Summer,"" which left the rest of us drooling in envy. Additionally, I have to give huge props to our server, Michael, who made us feel welcome, comfortable, and informed about our entire experience.  Anytime we had questions about the menu, he was patient and attentive and made thoughtful recommendations.  I have to draw attention to how the servers walk around offering you selections from a tray of house-made breads, including pan au lait, potato garlic, baguette, and others.  Michael asked what kind I wanted, so I asked for the potato garlic, and then he asked if I wanted another, so I asked if I could have one of each.  He didn't bat an eye at my greedy request and dutifully loaded my tiny plate with as much bread as I thought I could eat.  Michael, if I could give out Michelin stars for restaurant servers, I'd give one to you.  Thanks to you and L2O for making this my most memorable trip to Chicago.",0.9973,0.84,0.141,0.019,0.5319751664106502
2010-07-13,5.0,"One of the best restaurant meals of my life. Went with several friends and did the 12 course tasting with wine pairings.  This level of fine dining is pretty rare for me and as such I felt a bit odd going to relative newcomer L2O.  You see, I've lived in Chicago almost 10 years and haven't yet been to Trotters, Tru, or really any other of the more established heavy hitters.   Also, based on the Bourdain Chicago episode I was worried the food at L2O would be a bit outside my comfort zone, which is fine, except, when you almost never throw down this sort of coin on dinner, you kind of want to be sure you're going to love it.   Well, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The food was revelatory.  So fucking good.  I certainly had favorite dishes, (the Thai snapper was like a little sense portrait reminding me of my first taste of Thai food and why I love it) but overall, I really, really enjoyed each and every one.  Delicious, beautiful, inspiring.   These plates made me completely ok with the cost of the meal.   Are you paying a lot?  Yes.  But what are you getting in return?  You are getting an amazing array of world class ingredients, prepared thoughtfully, beautifully, and with a level of skill that clearly comes only from years of diligent practice and passion.  This is not something you can do at home.  This is like paying for a play or something, but you know, awesome. Of course many of the best meals of your life will be ones made and enjoyed with friends, or eaten at normal, human restaurants, but once in a while going to a place like this and seeing what the Laurent Gras type dudes of the world are up to is definitely worth it. Amazing. The biggest surprise was just how easy it was to love everything.  Each dish was different, but if there was a common taste theme I guess it would be an unabashed pursuit of straight up deliciousness, the expert blending of sweet, savory, sour, and saltiness with amazing aromas.  I think high end restaurants perhaps occasionally  feel the need to be ""challenging"" and serve you the food version of modern art.  They'll go more for ""interesting"" than ""toothsome"".  While this approach can be really wonderful, L2O didn't seem too interested in it.

We also fell in love with the cocktail menu and asked our server to serve us one of everything (that was something like six drinks between the two of us) along with our tasting menu.  Their response was thoughtful, and each of the drinks was completely outstanding.  I love the visual experience to cocktails and the variety of possible preparations/approaches more than I get excited about wine, so this was a lot of fun.  We got to see another side of L2O through the beverages. Two really standout moments that had nothing directly to do with the food:  Upon request, the team gave us a tour of the kitchen and sent a copy of the menu we ate (which wasn't printed anywhere prior, they had to write it down) to us that night at 2:00 am.  They're not just dedicated to one aspect of great customer service -- they want to do everything impeccably.  Outstanding.",0.9973,0.77,0.217,0.014,0.5420420420420419

We went in February, had an early reservation, there wasn't many tables in yet.  But as time went on, more tables were seated.  I liked how the waiters were dressed in suits ;)   Little details... - butter was served in a half orb stuck on the lid of a white glass dish - next to every table is a serving cart that the waiters use to change out silverware between courses - cable wires were used to separate certain sections of the room - silverware is laid on a block of white granite 2 amuse bouche to start: - summer spring roll with shrimp & mango - a little heavy on the fish sauce but very light - shrimp chip dyed with squid ink to make it look like a shiitake mushroom covering a mussel sitting in a green puree (think it was parsley) 1st dish: mine: Tuna, Tomato, Hibiscus, Foie Gras Snow - I was so looking forward to this dish!  I LOVE foie gras and the snow was so light but very full of flavor, it was like foie gras without all the fat ;)  The presentation was so beautiful and interesting, tomato gelee, yellow dots of hibiscus sauce flanking the cubes of tuna... Bf: Escolar Jamon, Espelette - it was so interesting!  It was escolar yet it was smoked and tasted just like ham! 2nd Course: Mine: Lobster Bisque, Chestnut, Lobster Dumpling This was the MOST MEMORABLE dish for me ever!  The dish is brought out with 2 perfectly orange orbs sitting in the bottom of the bowl, the waiter poured the Lobster Chestnut Bisque into the bowl in front of me and topped it with Creme Fraiche.  It was sooo delicious, I'm salivating as I am typing this.... I don't care for the American style dumplings because they are just lumps of dough, but this was not your average dumpling.  It was sooo amazingly light and pillowy! yum yum yum!!! BF: Lamb Tartare, Shiro Ebi, Tarragon, Pickled Good flavors though we didn't like the texture of the lamb tartare. 3rd Course:  Mine: Shabu Shabu Hiramasa, Konbu Bouillon, Sesame, King Oyster, Noodles It was light and I loved the noodles and oyster mushroom.  The fish was fresh and it wasn't too fishy, I don't eat any cooked fish but I made myself eat this since after all, I did spend quite of a bit of money! BF: Tobacco steak with Chocolate sauce, Bone Marrow gelee with gold leaves, Celery Root Puree, Turnip  Dessert & Bon Bons: can't remember the details but I remember that it was lots of chocolates, frozen sherbet, just lots of sweet deliciousness! Definitely was worth the hype!!!!

2010-07-03,2.0,"Destroying what turned out to be a great tradition, I chose to celebrate my birthday at L2O instead of my usual Alinea. WHAT A WASTE!  Everything there was substandard: food, service, sommelier... Considering their price point and their chef, the restaurant should try much harder to be alongside Alinea and Charlie Trotter's.  I was able to make a reservation to L2O 10 days in advance of my desired date. It should have been a red flag right there and then. No other good fine dining destination in Chicago allows procrastination. Although L2O is not filled to capacity, it requires a 72 hour cancellation. Insanity!  L2O is located in a hotel next to the Mon Ami Gabi. In order to get inside L2O, you go trough the hotel entrance, walk a bit to the right and locate the CLOSED door to L2O, which you need to physically open to get inside. To me, this is not how you enter a fine dining establishment. The door has to either open by the sensor or by people directing you to the right place. L2O charges enough money to afford this ""luxury."" Having said that, it is a minor point. The major issues are food and service.  When we arrived to the restaurant on a Thursday night, it was almost empty. At the same time, after we were seated, it took the staff at least 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence and to ask if we want anything to drink. When I informed the server that I want to see a wine list, he dragged a cart to my table where they apparently store wine list menus and ..... left for yet another 10 minutes. He went to clean up one of the courses from a table nearby. So rude and unprofessional. Overall, I did not feel that the servers knew what they were doing. I also do not think that there was a captain on the floor who directed them. If there was a captain, he clearly was not doing his job. After our server finished with the other table, he came back and gave us the wine list and left again. He did not even give us the menu to see if we want to see it first to choose a better pairing. After another 10 minutes of us looking at the wine list, our waiter finally realized that seeing the menu would be nice. So, he offered to bring it to us. As far as I recall, their wines by the glass are in a 15 + range. They also offer half bottles for, I think, 40 +, and full bottles. They also have sakes (per glass, for 17 and 22, I think, and for a bottle, for 40 + for a 300 ml and 90 + for 750 ml). We decided to go with sakes but could not decide which one. So, we summoned their so called sommelier, who I did not feel was very comfortable with sakes. She has not even asked us what we were having to suggest the right one. She pointed out two most expensive sakes on the menu ($ 90+ and 160+) and said that those were her favorite. We ordered a 300 ml bottle because we wanted to try it first before committing to a larger bottle. Instead of just taking our order, the girl came back with our bottle and the large one to say that the one that we ordered is $ 43 for a 300 ml and that 750ml is $ 90+. With all due respect to her desire to ""save"" us money, it was not professional. We were not in the wine store shopping for bottles. She had to just take the order and leave quietly, saying something along the line of ""very good choice"" to make us feel special. This is one of the reasons why people go to the fine dining establishments. They are made to feel incredible there. L2O does not have that. They don't fold your napkins when you leave the table, they don't clean crumbs off of your table EVER, and they don't ask you if there is anything else you want after each of your courses.  Along with bad service came substandard food. When you go to Alinea, you are wowed by every course, form presentation to the pairing of flavors. You are not wowed in L2O. You are disappointed. L2O offers 3 prix fixe choices: four course choice for $110, summer 12 course for $165, and luxury ingredient menu for $245. We went with a four course. Four courses are divided into a cold salad/ sashimi appetizer course, a warm appetizer course, a main course, and a dessert. I ordered Medai course and my husband got Tuna for the first course. While I did enjoy his choice, my food had a nice fish that was completely overpowered by the sour consomme. For the second, we got Lobster bisque, which was good and I got Diver Scallop, which was overcooked. For the third, I got Lobster (extra $10) and he got Beef Short Rib. Lobster was flavorful while Beef was overcooked. Finally, for dessert, we got Orange Souffle and Raspberry. It was OK. In general, lobster dishes in L2O were superior to others. At the same time, not even close to Alinea.  So, if you want to learn anything from this review, go to Alinea and avoid L2O. It is not worth your time and money.",0.995,0.87,0.094,0.035,0.4432023809523809

Opening his own restaurant in Chicago, I was a bit surprise, but followed him regardless.  The place is small, simple decor & intimate; love the layout & plenty of space between tables, I would guess the place can hold up maximum 70 seats. What I surprised more was his gigantic kitchen. & they told me the kitchen is bigger than the dining room, WOW!  A spice cabinet that more than 200 spices & all the equipments he uses, everything is fresh, organic & the finest ingredients in the world. It was amazing to see. & the wonderful Sommelier Chantelle Pabros, she was simply know what to recommend us to pair with our food journey. 6 different kind of freshly bake bread & the mini crossant was the best! - Amuse Buoche - shrimp with citrus, tomato, & chive - simply tasty. - Wild mushroom, scallop, & onion. - Fluke, Ume, Sudachi & Fried Garlic - aromatic & sweet. - Tuna, Tomato, Hibicus, Foie Gras Snow, Gelle, & Chive - amazing dish. - Tofu, Shiso, & dried shredded Japan squid - love how the dried squid softening on my tongue, & the tofu is soft, sweet & smooth. - Escolar Jamon, seared, rub with smoke, Espelette, daikon, & olive oil - well balance & warm. - Scallop, Sauvignonc Blanc, Passionfruit, blueberries with vanilla sauce - this dish was beautifully displace & memorable photographic as it tastes. - Kampachi, Yuzu,Tapioca, Black Lime - warm, buttery tasty dish. - Lobster Bisque, Lobster dumpling, caviar - all the finer things in life is on this dish. - Pork Belly, Truffle, Potato - so yummy! - Shabu Shabu Hiramasa, Konbu Bouillon, Citrus sauce  - perfectly balance. - Shabu Shabu Medai - It was such an unexpected dish & I love it. - Chocolate truffle for dessert. - Creme Fraiche vanilla dessert. Pairing wonderfully by sommelier Chantelle Pabros: - 2008 Craggy Range Te Muna Road Sauvignon Blanc - truly wild,  Zesty light, sweet and tart, then dry and clean taste. - 1999 Prager Riesling Smaragd Achleiten - broad and creamy in texture, but let it sits, it freshens & becomes more focused. - 2005 Chateau De Puligny Montrachet Puligny Montrachet Les Folatieres - reserved & cool, tasty, & elegant to the nose. - & Sauternes Bordeaux  at the end - perfect for me. 1 of my FAV restos in Chicago - a Michelin Star worthy. Overall: 5 stars For value 5 stars For Food: 5 stars For Service: 5 stars  For ambiance:minimalist, chic, swank, & modern.

2010-05-20,4.0,"Every single aspect of this restaurant screams FINE DINING. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the sticker shock I experienced once I opened the bill. Now I know you're thinking, hey dummy, they don't just give away 12 course tastings and wine pairings. Yes I'm aware of that. The price for the 12 course tasting IS listed, however the corresponding wine pairing was NOT listed. Having said that, I was absolutely blown away by the food (most important), the wine pairings (the sommelier was fantastic), and the service in that order. Everything was so good it's almost difficult to pick my favorites, however they were the Peeky Toe Crab and Beef Short Rib. While this might seem like a minute detail, the Blue Cheese olives that I had in my dirty martini were by far, hands down, the best that I have ever had, no questions. To someone that drinks 1-2 dirty martinis a week, this is a VERY important detail.  In conclusion I would definitely dine at L2O again, however it would require a special occasion.

2010-05-19,2.0,"This restaurant has everything going for it, but unfortunately the food is not worthy of the price. In one week, I dined at Graham Elliot, Blackbird, Alinea and here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment. The restaurant is gorgeous and elegant. The staff are amazing. Very friendly and attentive. I ordered the 12 course tasting menu. Whoever complained about not knowing the prices didn't have the same menu as me. The cost of the Spring tasting menu is $150, not including wine. The presentation of the food is beautiful. Everything looks delicious. This is why it made me sad to discover that the taste did not match the presentation. Since you do taste with your eyes, if food looks appealing you are that much more likely to enjoy it. When I dined at Alinea, after each course I thought ""I would pay $100 for just one more bite"". Sadly, I did not have that feeling about any of my courses. Nothing is bad, it's just that when I spend this amount of money, I expect to have a ""wow"" moment when I taste the food. I wondered how the chef, who I know is very passionate, could taste something so different than me. Regarding the portion size, it's more than enough. I was stuffed well before the dessert started. I love fish, but this was just not a great food experience.",0.9716,0.694,0.183,0.123,0.7211309523809525
2010-05-17,5.0,"Once every year, I like to check out the upper echelon of the Chicago dining scene. (It helps break up my usual Chicago routine, which normally consists of desperate late-nite runs for deep-dish pizza to sober up enough to remember what hotel I'm staying at.) This year, the wife and I decided to try L20, the ultra fancy-smancy seafood restaurant in the lobby of the Belden-Stratford hotel.  We've stayed at the Belden-Stratford as hotel guests many times before, and have often watched the parade of local bourgeois entering the secret chambers of L20 (and formerly, Ambria) with great curiosity, wondering what otherworldly pleasures must exist on the other side of those opaque, impenetrable doors. Now, it was our turn to find out.  Our misfortune was getting stuck with an early reservation. In fact, we were the first diners to arrive that evening at 6:15, so we were instantly greeted with a cadre of a half-dozen servers, all lined up in formation waiting for us. ""Good evening,"" chimed the chorus of staff. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Six pairs of eyes examined us as we entered the immaculate and empty restaurant. I started to panic. I thought, ""Holy shit, this is trap!!! I have mistakenly trespassed onto Tom Cruise's personal spacecraft, and now will be receiving a Katie Holmes-style frontal lobotomy. They're on to us. They know we can't afford it. They've already scanned my checking account balance. I knew this reservation was a mistake...."" Once we were seated, my abduction scenario paranoia subsided a bit, but I still remained captivated by this alien spectacle. Entering a 5-star restaurant is like entering a social insect hive, with the staff all operating with choreographed swift precision like worker honeybees, each maintaining perfectly submissive neutral postures, to avoid pissing off the drones. Even though I knew everyone here was getting paid to behave like this, the social dynamic was still creepy as hell. It's so clean and perfect and polished and anal and freaky; it's like a wealthy OCD sufferer's wet dream. It makes you want to purposely drop crumbs on the floor,  just to see how many milliseconds it will take staff to whisk it away in a sterling-silver dustpan. Suddenly, our server materialized next to us tableside (she had a talent for this), and addressed us with a smooth, polished tone. I swore it was that alien lady from the ""V"" television series talking to me. Did we want to start with some champagne? We nodded hesitantly, afraid. Perhaps tonight's luxury pour of Krug, she asked? Suuuuure. ( I did not dare ask the price, not wanting to futher arouse their suspicions. I honestly didn't want to know.) Finally exhausted from all this stiff formality, I decided to engage our server in some casual conversation, hoping this might allow both parties to relax and loosen up. She responded in kind. She realized that we were just a couple of harmless nobodies... we weren't there to berate and belittle and exercise our egos on her....so she put down her guard as much as the 5-star protocol would allow. (She was not so lucky with the guy at the next table, some Russian mobster clown dressed in a hideous seersucker suit. I understood her need for caution. This place must attract a lot of world-class assholes.)  She was very intelligent and knowledgable about wine, and we all seemed connect around this topic.  After this point, the evening suddenly became relaxed and fun...a blast, actually! The champagne (...which was fucking phenomenal @ $50 a glass b/t/w) certainly helped matters, and once the mind-blowing 12-course global seafood and wine pairing started to arrive, we settled in and enjoyed what was easily the best meal of our life. The meal was equivalent to jetting around the globe in one night to sample the best seafood every world culture had to offer: Moroccan-spiced salmon, Russian salted cod and caviar, red snapper with an Indian curry, Pacific halibut with wild leeks and fiddlehead ferns, etc. As we slipped further into a wine-induced haze, even the idiosyncratic rituals of the silverware replacement after each course became artful and amusing. There was even a geisha floating around for reasons...well...I don't know exactly...what do geishas do anyhow??? My only complaint over the entire 12-course meal was the dreaded 24 karat gold flakes in one of the dessert courses. I'm going to feel guilty enough about this meal as is, and now you're gonna make me EAT GOLD? Odorless, flavorless gold? (I asked our server if she was, in fact, familiar with the David Cross comedy routine about this? She cocked her head, and calmly replied, ""Why yes, of course, sir"", then went about her business. Classic.)  In the end, I probably would have welcomed the Tom Cruise alien anal probe over receiving the bill. ($850 with tip for a party of two.) But, hey....someone has to pay for all that dishwashing.  L2O was worth every penny...all 85,000 of them.",0.9983,0.762,0.169,0.07,0.48552946292672317

2010-04-10,5.0,"Had an exceptional meal at L2O last night.  Every component from being warmly greeted at the door to being escorted out by our food server Jen was above our expectations.  My husband and I had the four course meal.  Highlights were the foie gras (the best dish of the evening), scallops, salmon baked in clay pot,  madai,  souffles and as many have said the bread service.  Our other choices were also very good- the tuna with truffle snow and the lobster.  Having tried quite a few high end restaurants I must say that this being a seafood focused restaurant does make the experience unique.  The flavors are more subtle and some of the dishes need to be experimented with combining the deconstructed components. The salmon for example seemed very ""ordinary"" on the first bite, but got better and more lovely as the texture and tastes developed with each bite.  I think this is may be why we preferred the four course meal to a previous trip with 12 courses.  It's also possible that this Spring menu is just more to our liking than the previous one.  But with two of us dining we had eight courses between us and we could focus on our particular preferences.  We really liked their Sommelier, but felt the wine pairings were fair.  Some really worked others a little off.  To be fair it's probably more challenging to do pairings with a menu that has so many subtle but complex flavors mixing asian/french/african/fusion and at times all on one plate.  French/Italian foods with French/Italian wine is much easier I'm sure.  In hindsight there might be a cocktail that would pair better with some of the dishes.  In the end an excellent meal that left me in a pleasant food after glow this morning.",0.995,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.5329305555555555
2010-04-03,2.0,"I really wanted to LOVE L20...I did. Both of us love seafood - and thought that this would be the best option to splurge on our trip to Chicago. Instead - we were highly disappointed. The thing about me is - when I sit down to a meal, and I take the first bite of food - I want it to be so delicious that I close my eyes and say ""mm"" or ""wow"". I don't want to chew and ponder and say - ""well hmm...interesting."" I don't care about interesting -- i want the food to taste amazing.  That being said -- the dishes here were interesting. Not something you would normally have the opportunity to try (or at least have presented in such a way). If that's your thing -- then you'd probably like it here a lot more than I did. We got the 4 course pre fixe. My crab appetizer was very good - so was her tuna tartar. Scallops - she enjoyed. Octopus - after three bites I felt it was a little rich. Entrees were not to our liking. I love bass - it is one of my favorite. So I opted for the Striped Bass. Very underwhelmed- I felt kind of sad that I didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted to (especially when paying $400). Her Thai Snapper - I know she didn't enjoy at all.  Dessert -- Praline Souffle - delicious. One of the best parts of dinner. I opted for the Raspberry with Marscapone - was decent but reminded me of a cold sweet soup.  The ONLY thing that made both of us say ""mm"" was the chocolate bon bon they gave towards the end of the night. Delicious. But come on - a bon bon?  I will say that of course the service was very good - and the decor is really nice. The thing about the service though -- was that it, at times felt awkward. I kept wanting our server to relax and not be so uptight. Maybe I am just not into these ultra modern swanky places. I thought I might be - but after my experience, realize I much prefer a comfortable, warm, friendly - even somewhat loud environment. I am passionate about food -  I don't want to eat it in silence discussing how interesting it is and making sure I'm not in the way as the server adjusts my silverware for the 17th time.

2010-03-30,5.0,"I didn't develop my deep and unwavering love for seafood because of the fish sticks my mother used to serve my siblings and I when we were kids;  or the Alabama catfish I would spend more time picking the bones out of than eating. It came as a college kid spending time in Mobile, AL and N'awlins eating crawfish, raw oysters, oyster po' boys, shrimp etoufee and other seafood delights.  The meal I had last Friday evening at L20 justifies all the reasons why I will continue my love affair with seafood.  After attending a 2005 Batard Montrachet wine tasting, my dear friend and I found our way into the dimly lit L20. A friendly hostess lead us through the breathtaking and beautiful restaurant to our table---an unyieldingly gorgeous functional work of art made of pure blonde onyx.  After perusing the menu, we decided upon the four course prix fixe, which included raw, warm and main dishes plus dessert. Chantal, the beautiful and charming sommelier, presented and poured exceptional wine choices which complemented our dishes perfectly. RAW - Since I never had fluke before, I chose that with the ume, sadachi and fried garlic. My dining companion chose the tuna with foie gras snow and hibiscus leaf.

WARM- The diver scallop with sauvignon blanc, vanilla and passionfruit made sweet, passionate love to my tastebuds, while my dinner date seemed to be having similar relations with his foie gras in phyllo dough and essence of strawberry. More delicious sake accompanied our second course. MAIN - Who is John Dory? Apparently he is an utterly delicious deep sea fish who was plucked from the coastal waters of South West Africa, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Australia, Japan or Europe and delivered to L20 for our enjoyment. It was nice meeting you Mr. Dory, please forgive us for devouring you. The tasty Gewurstraminer added to the sublime pleasure we experienced in eating you. At this point, I wanted to lay out a blanket over the beautiful onyx table, climb on top of it and peacefully drift off into a deep, food-induced sleep. But there was more! Champagne and a delicious chocolate box. Ok...if I must. And I did. Service was beyond amazing as our service team tended to our every need with style, personality and no pretension at all. This restaurant is pure class and I feel privileged to have been a guest there. L20, I love you.",0.9986,0.754,0.234,0.012,0.6184237863585689

So the way to do this place is to go with some close friends.  Each get the 4 course.  And just rotate seats (or plates) as needed.  The 6 course taste-to-taste menu seems fun, I'd try it next time...course, after two trips, i haven't. Peeky toe crab in a foie gras emulsion - so wonderful.  Sashimi tuna with jellied hibiscus, also crazy good. Get the savory soufflé if they have it too.",0.9778,0.786,0.179,0.035,0.43529411764705883

The dining room was about half empty, and so I will admit perhaps we got the restaurant on an off night and had the B team and not the A team, but for these prices you should always get the A team. The service was fine but nothing exceptional. The sommelier was very friendly and helpful and seemingly knowledgeable. Our waiter was new and had just moved to Chicago. He was fine but not overly knowledgeable about the food and surprisingly never once asked us if we were enjoying our dishes. But most importantly the food (we did the 12 course tasting) seemed rather uninspired and boring. I realize this is a seafood restaurant but the pork belly was not prepared well and the potatoes that accompanied it were undercooked.

After being told every 15 minutes or so that our table was almost ready, we were finally seated at 10:15pm. We ordered a bottle of champagne to start off the evening and were excited to finally start eating. We were starving and had no idea that we still had a wait in front of us.  The champagne took about 1/2 hour to arrive, the menus took about 45 minutes to arrive, and the amuse arrived at 11:15. And we still had 15 courses to go.  There were no apologies about the delay. Normally this would be only slightly annoying if the food was amazing. But I have a baby at home so my 7am wake up time (as well as the chance of a 4am crying baby) was steadily approaching as each course (and wine paring arrived). So rather than excitingly awaiting each course, I nervously checked my watch, took a small sip of my wine paring (I'm a nursing mother), and tried to enjoy the evening.  We finally left at 2:30am, after having our dessert courses brought together as 1 course to speed it up. I have enjoyed New Years Eve at restaurants like Alinea and Les Nomades and my experience at L2O was shocking in comparison. I feel sick every time I think about the $739.47 we spent on dinner.  The food wasn't amazing to us, but perhaps had we not been starving by the time the food arrived we might have enjoyed it more. Also, an apology of some sort would have been nice as well.

My perspective might be slightly warped as I'd gone with a big group of professional cooks and had just spent the last few days before gorging on some of the best restaurants in New York City. But I must say I was totally and completely impressed with my whole L2O experience.  First of all, the decor is striking in its minimalist beauty. There was a simple palate of dark wood, grey, white and metallics. While we waited for the rest of our party to arrive, we enjoyed the lounge sipping on the wonderfully crafted cocktails. It was a little chilly for some of the girls, and the server brought out pashminas to keep them warm! What a nice touch. Once our party was complete, we moved into the dining room. They took our drinks on a tray and I wondered how they'd know who got which ones since some of us had dupes. As I'd predicted, they mixed up one set, but no big deal. It was just entertaining to see if they'd be able to keep them straight. All of us being foodies, we'd already scoped out the menu online and we'd had a general idea of what we wanted to eat, which with the help of the sommelier helped me decide on a wonderful Torrontes from Argentina. When it came to the food, we opted for the four-course prix fixe menu and with a couple vegetarians in the party, we'd have a diverse selection of the menu on our table. I chose the Escolar, Salted Cod, Halibut and the Praline Souffle. Everything was beautifully plated, well cooked and delicious. I also remember enjoying the raw tuna and peekytoe crab; the warm octopus, diver scallops, and lobster bisque; the shabu-shabu, pork belly and smoked ribeye were also amazing. Oh, and I can't forget about how amazing the bread service was. Pretty much all of it was perfect. And the cheese plate, tea service and petits fours were also pretty fantastic.  I don't think I've had a better dining experience from top to bottom anywhere else in Chicago.

Their perfection when it comes to presentation has been beaten to death in all the other reviews, but this stuff really is beautiful. It's funny that everyone's perspective turns out the same, the pictures look almost identical to the ones I took. I guess Laurent Gras is the only one that can take credit for that.  Ok, that said, while I have plans to go back, there were some problems I think were anomalies, but would have preferred to skip the first time around. When we arrived, we were kind of dropped off in a room containing other people dining, and a table with the remnants of someone else's meal on it, where we ended up waiting for a while, before heading to our final destination. We also were served a fish that seemingly still had some of its internal organs attached, which I can only assume gave it its extremely bitter flavor, and finally, two of our dishes were just way too similar.

2009-09-20,5.0,"Full review in the blog. An amazing experience - highlights are below: As many have noted before (including Gras via his blog,) the bread program at L2O is a source of pride and each bread is made freshly in house 2-3 times per dinner service with different options sometimes appearing later in service.  During our evening the initial breads included a buttery pain au Lait, a savory Asiago, a crunchy mini baguette, a hearty wheat epi (similar to the version at Bouchon,) and a bitter and rustic country bread - later in the service this selection was joined by the much praised (and absolutely incredible) rosemary croissant - likely as much butter as choux.  The butter, served inverted and flipped over at presentation, was a hearty and grassy blend made from local artisan cow's cream - not quite as good as The French Laundry's famed option, but a close runner up - and the quality of breads was hands and feet above that at TFL or Alinea. The second dish, ""Tuna"" was deemed the favorite of the entire meal by my sister.  Featuring crimson Ahi cubes each dotted or splashed with either dashi, crunchy black olive, nicoise gelee, or yuzu and topped with ""Tuna Snow"" (frozen toro run through a snow cone machine) the overall effect was a sampling of at least 5 different flavors of tuna with each maintaining the familiar taste of the fish but accenting it in a new and unexpected manner.  The snow itself literally melted in the mouth and gave the dish a silky smooth feel that one does not usually associate with fish. Dish five ""Scallop"" was our first foray into Chef Gras' warmed fishes and it was a great success - potentially my favorite part of the tasting menu.  Featuring a large and perfectly prepared diver scallop (cooked outside, barely warmed within) accompanied by Blueberries and Blueberry gelee plus Sorrel and finished tableside with a ginger jus each flavor met the tongue and palate with great aplomb yet entirely without overwhelming the other complimentary flavors.  Sweet and ripe berries, acidic and leafy sorrel, smooth and spicy ginger, and fleshy but briny scallop were each well represented and a wonderful melange of textures and flavors left us in awe - given the opportunity I could've eaten this by the bowl. Dish seven, a segue of sort into the heavier finishing dishes, was the much praised Arctic Char.  Coupling the flakey and light fish with a Champagne and Brown Butter broth I felt the dish was very well composed to highlight the trout-like taste while the preparation paid attention to the more ""salmonesque"" texture by coupling the fish with a zucchini and pea ""flan"" topped with millimeter thick slices of zucchini skin for texture.  Unctuous without being heavy I think this was my second favorite tasting menu item of the night and my sister agreed. ""Foie Gras, Asparagus, Rhubarb, Bee Pollen, Crystallized Butter"" arrived and it was simply a sight to behold - both the dish and the smile on my face.  Featuring a large spun-cloud of sweet cotton candy forming a ""cave"" of sorts over a melody of seared foie, poached asparagus, crunchy rhubarb, rhubarb gel and then covered with bee pollen, edible flowers, and crystallized butter - to date it is my favorite savory presentation of all time and also my favorite foie dish since The French Laundry.  Worth every penny of the $35 supplement with the perfectly prepared foie gras soaking into the base-layer of the cotton candy and marrying perfectly with the crispy/snappy vegetables - even the bee pollen and flowers added to the dish with their unique tones blending well with the cotton candy to create an aromatic essence on the palate. The final dish, a soufflé simply entitled ""Praline-praline"" was flawless - the best soufflé I've ever tasted, topping the more ""famous"" versions at Gary Danko and Le Cirque as well as my previous favorite at Wolfgang Puck's CUT.  Standing tall the fluffy cloud of sugar and egg was opened tableside and filled with rich praline and dark rum cream.  Showing great technical skill this dish admittedly felt a tad out of place given the progressive style of Gras menu, but given his range - from ""mg"" technique to traditional Shabu-Shabu I thought the dish was a fitting close - and I thought it a second time as I finished my sister's portion because she was nearing a food-coma.  Finally, the canele - sublime.  Without a doubt the best I've ever experienced, topping another Chicago landmark (TRU) with its crunchy caramelized sugar exterior giving way to a yolky cream interior that seemed just barely cooked. I was quite impressed Chef Gras' attention to detail - literally everything from the amuses to the mignardises, the music to the tables and chairs, even the cleaning schedule.  Continuing with us all the way to the front of the hotel we found our car waiting and Kara wished us a good evening and presented us with our signed menus.  A wonderful experience from start to finish and amongst my top 5 meals all time.",0.9994,0.797,0.186,0.017,0.5165866741953697

2009-09-09,5.0,"Bring your appetite and your checkbook.  All three of us ordered the four course meal that end up being ten courses once you factor in the amuse bouche, bread and complimentary desserts.   So if you don't enjoy food (not sure why'd you eat here...) and you don't have at least three hours, don't bother with this place. Location - Located just inside the historic Beldon Stratford Hotel.  A simple black door with the words L20 is your only indicator.  Ambiance - Serene, calm, creative yet simple decor.    Restroom had an aquarium tank. Plating was visually pleasing.  However, it was so quiet that we had to whisper.  That was a bit unpleasant when you want to enjoy your food with good company. Reservations - Highly recommended.    Dress Code - Better to overdress!  Men wore suit/tie, women wore slacks/dresses.  Service - Very good.   Food - Although the four course meal cost $110, the portions and ingredients were well worth it.  Very creative, artistic and imaginative.  Lots of gelee and molecular gastronomy.   1. Amuse Bouche             a. Lobster Consomme - Piece of lobster perched on some sort of puree.             b. Tempura - Not sure what it was.  Light and came with a chipotle/remoulade type of dipping sauce.             c.  Lemon Chill - A tart lemon/marshmellow concoction.  Looked and tasted like sorbet that had been left out to melt. 2. Bread - I swear we didn't get a selection of bacon wrapped bread! There was one with chorizo that I had and it was decent.  Great selection though.  Loved the butter shaped in a half circle and placed on a cold clear glass.  3. Raw Dish - Favorite was Sashimi or Tuna Tartare               a.   Peekytoe Crab, Avocado, Kaffir Lime, Lemon Oil-  Lots of fresh crab under thin sliced avocado.  Refreshing and light.                b. Sashimi Platter, Fluke, Kampachi, Kinmedai, Shimaaji - Amazing presentation on a long cold stone tray with ginger and soy sauce gelee.  Fish was amazingly fresh and melted in your mouth.                  c. Tuna, Tomato, Hibiscus, Foie Gras Snow - Amazing.  Presented checkboard style, the dish had a great layered flavor of ingredients. 4.  Warm Dish - Hands down, the Foie Gras                 a. Ravioli: White Shrimp, Tomato, Baked Pepper - Least favorite dish. Ravioli was a bit dry and had little filling inside.                 b. Foie Gras, Asparagus, Rhubarb, Crystalized Butter, Bee Pollen- WINNER!!  The taste and the presentation was awesome!  The foie gras simply melted in your mouth.  At first sight, the plate is a huge mound of white cotton candy about 7 to 8 inches high/diameter. It was glazed with salt, some sort of flower and red peppers (not the chili kind but the ripe peppercorn type ???).  It had an interesting texture that melted in your mouth with an end note of salty, peppery and slightly sweet.                  c. Diver Scallop, Sauvignon Blanc, Passionfruit - Vanilla - Perfectly cooked.  Scallops were really fresh but because of the texture, it doesn't soak up the sauce.  5. Main Dish - Go with the arctic char!                  a.  Arctic Char, Champagne, Zucchini - Super moist and light. Great subtle flavor.                   b.  Lobster, Carrot, Pineapple, Yellow Curry  - Tasted too rich and heavy.                   c. Pork Belly, Truffle, Potato - It was missing vegetables.  I felt like I was having meat and potatoes. Three big pork belly cooked perfectly with crispy skin.  A reduction with lot of truffle (YUM) bits was poured on the pork belly.  Yukon gold potatos were good but a bit bland.  I was hoping the center was filled with something else to give it a bit of saltiness, but nope, just creamy potatos.  I'm sure it was suppose to soak up the reduction but it was just missing something I can't put my finger on. 6.  Dessert - Chocolate Ball                  a. Orange, Grand Marnier Souffle - Good but nothing special.                   b. Chocolate Egg with Caramel Mousse - Ok, I'm not a huge fan of caramel but wow was this amazing! A chocolate shell that look like a cadbury egg hid a light, semi sweet caramel mousse.                   c. Lychee, Blueberry, Sorbet - Refreshing and light.  Three flavors, lychee in a sugar glass tube, blueberry sorbet, and lychee sorbet.  7. Complimentary Dessert - A macaroon type dessert (No coconut. Caramelized crispy shell.  Not very doughy.) and ganache slice (Never been a big fan.  Too rich.) 8.

I can understand why one of the reviews thought they were too cold, because they were served on cold stone trays. I agree, I really enjoyed just-left-the-chef-hand awesome sushi in Japan, but this is a very different experience. I think the Kobe beef definitely crowned the experience. It was the size of my palm (think 2 decks of cards) and absolutely amazing. I only wish we could buy it here... the servers were attentive but not overpowering like in Tru.

We decided to get the four course meal and added on a fifth course as well.  Our waiter was very good, with some nice recommendations on food and wine, and while the second half-bottle of wine was not the best it was partly our fault.

2009-06-16,2.0,"Oh, L20. A few weeks ago, I was in a cab on the way to the emergency room, where my date happened to be, instead of on the way to my much anticipated birthday dinner at your restaurant. Upset as I was, I remembered to call and cancel our dinner reservation. I was told there would be a $100 cancellation fee unless I rescheduled immediately. Great. Happy birthday to me.  Dinner was rescheduled for a few weeks later. Unfortunately, that first tone of service was exactly what I saw at L20.  First, the good things: L20 has a fantastic wine list. They even had one of my favorite merseult chardonnays. The restaurant also produced the highest quality fish I've had in this town. And the restaurant is very, very pretty. It is definitely has a ""see and be seen"" setup, and I would be very appropriate for your favorite cleavage-bearing cocktail dress and handsome supermodel dates. And the not good things:  1. The service was pretentious and, at times, awkward. My boyfriend, who is quite a foodie, but isn't into raw fish, was told in no uncertain terms that there were no substitutions on the menu. We were also told both of us had to order the same menu. Alas, we downgraded our 12-course tasting menu choice for the six course tete-a-tete menu.  2. Even after it had specifically been stated raw fish was not cool, raw (but delicious) salmon appeared at the bottom of an amuse bouche.  3. I've never been bumped and interrupted so many times for the placement of silverware. Other awkward service things kept happening like this. Why on earth did the sommelier have me taste the wine after she had already done so? I completely trust her expertise in understanding whether or not a bottle of wine is good. After indicating I would like coffee after dessert, instead of with it, I was not asked what type of coffee I would like. Regular coffee just appeared -- even for my date, who said nothing about wanting coffee. (I usually take a latte, btw; boyfriend takes decaf) Even though I've dined in many restaurants of outstanding quality, I felt like I didn't understand the rules at this one.  4. I left hungry. I'm not a very big person. I don't eat terribly much food. But the six-course menu is TINY. If I would've had a granola bar in my purse, I would've eaten it. We went back to our house and scarfed down pizza when we came home.  The food was lovely. Nothing really silenced me into not speaking and ignoring my date while I experienced pure culinary pleasure -- except my excellent wine. I had higher expectations from the reviews I've read.

I'm giving it 3 stars as a comparison to other top notch, super expensive restaurants (just wanted to make that clear). The service is really bad and actually can ruin the experiene.  Our waitress asked if we wanted drinks, but never once mentioned they also have a nice wine pairing with dinner.  No need to get a drink before hand if you are doing the wine pairing with dinner.  However, if you don't ask they don't tell you about it until they hand you a menu 20 minutes after you get there.   The menu is laid out oddly as well, 4 course (110), 6 course (90 bucks), 12 course is more.  She never once explained to us anything about the courses or about the fish that was on there.  She just plopped down an index card that has where each fish is from.  In this caliber of a restaurant they should give you at least a small intro to their philosiphy, food, or house suggestions.  The service was very robotic and unlike Alinea and Tru no server seamed to be having fun. The food was very good to excellent depending on the course.  The decoration of food was very average at best. I did finally have a chance to talk to the Sommelier (since I asked, but never was told he can come over if I have questions)  They have a 40 page wine list, so it should be told.  If this was someone's first high-end meal they would have been totally lost. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR WITH THIS STATEMENT;  L20 IS NO COMPARISON TO ALINEA.

For starters, the restaurant does not serve bottled water, which is appalling from a ""high end"" establishment. They claimed that they do not serve bottled water to ""help the environment"" however, wine, beer, and other liquor all come from bottles, so who are they fooling? Compromise in beverage selection should not be the case in a ""high end"" restaurant. The service was highly insincere, lacking even the most basic of courtesies to which even the lowest-end restaurants attend. For starters, the napkins of two guests of my party were removed by the staff as they used the restroom. The napkins were replenished only upon request of the guests, after a course was served.  Bread was only served upon asking the staff not once, but three times. Our waitress, with an forced smile and personality-free voice, smelled strongly of body-odor.  One guest's drink was not replenished through the entirety of the meal, as the glass stood empty for hours. Plates from our final course remained on the table for ten minutes after the last guest in my party finished eating. The wait staff refilled water glasses as they stared at the empty plates, still lacking the instinct to remove the plate.  Two unisex bathrooms for a ""high-end"" restaurant is insufficient, as I had to wait in line for several minutes to use the restroom. Once inside, the restroom was insufficiently supplied, lacking toilet paper.  The food was of quality, but lacked soul.

We had a couple of amuses - the first was sushi grade salmon that was supposed to taste like smoked salmon, the second was a delicious little bite of octupus.  Yum. Some of the highlights from the 12 course were: - Raw escolar cured with serrano ham spices - English peas with asparagus, ramps and morels - very seasonal - Roasted kona kampachi with tapioca pearls in this insanely good lime butter sauce (probably my fave) - Butter poached artic char - Skate with this soy glaze in a beefy bouillion with spring veggies (Mike's fave) - Pork belly with a truffle jus All of the courses were delicious.  The last course, a medai that you cooked in bouilllion yourself with mushrooms, was only ok.  The medai was much better eaten raw as sashimi than it was cooked.   We had an amuse dessert, followed by a honey cream, followed by this fresh raspberry concoction that was delicious, followed by monster praline souffles.  The souffles were delicious, but at that point I could only manage about 1/4 of the souffle.   The service was impeccable, and the wine pairings were for the most part very good.  There were a couple that we thought were a bit off, but it's wine, so we'll drink it. Several little touches made it special.  We were greeted by name, our menus were printed with Happy Anniversary and the date, and we were sent home with a box of little treats (custard cakes and brown butter and salted caramel macarons) that were perfect this morning with coffee! I can't say we'll go back  - at $700+ L2O is not your everyday sort of place.  If we're looking to drop that kind of cash on dinner again, I'd probably hit Moto (which neither of us have been to) or Alinea (which the hubby hasn't been to).",0.9983,0.783,0.211,0.006,0.5521847781847782

My sister took me here for my bday dinner and I must say, I am very appreciative!  The ambiance was dark and sleek while the food was creative - great combination! To the best part.. the food!  We tried the six course tasting menu which cost 90 bucks.  Here's a breakdown of the dishes that I remember: Amuse: Medium size shrimp sitting on a bed of diced greens with a mound of solid foam with smoke coming out of it.  Nice clean and light taste. Salad - Think drops - drops of soy dressing with mini radishes, beets, and daikon dropped onto a plate.  Beautiful presentation that was quite tasty.  Oh, there was a sugar crisp that complimented the soy and veggies. Asparagus and Morel mushroom in a buttery vegetable broth.  Yumm!   A bit too salty for my liking but cooked to perfection. Seared scallop in a passionfruit bath.  Best dish by far!  The tartness and slight sweetness of the passionfruit liquid cut into the flesh of the scallop perfectly.  I will have dreams about this dish! Peekytoe crab in a foie gras emulsion.  Great flavors but the emulsion was too salty.  It took away from the sweetness of the crab.   Artic Char slightly seared atop a cabernet reduction.  Quite good although the flavors did not match for me and one side of the fish tasted like there was a crust of sea salt. Palate cleanser was yummy - cantaloupe shaved ice.  Wow light and airy and delicious. Dessert - Chocolate ball stuffed with caramel mousse atop shaved ice cream.  Good but not memorable. Overall, great meal and very good service (nothing compares to Tru service).  My sister on a previous visit had the twelve course tasting and said she preferred the six course menu - perfect amount of food!",0.9985,0.715,0.278,0.007,0.6552380952380953

2009-04-27,5.0,"Disappointed with the last few of our forays into the world of fine dining here in town, we pretty much swore off those upper tier white tablecloth destinations for the past couple of years.  That's why I wasn't really enthusiastic when the better half made reservations for my birthday at L20.  After I scanned through a couple of Yelps about it though, I have to admit my curiosity piqued.    I think the praise, radiant as it was, still my have fallen a little short.  Whether you're talking about your eyes or your palette, the joint is a knock out.  You could easily just sit at a table and drink in the room all night and gladly fork over a big chunk of your paycheck.  L20 well deserves the extravagant kudos and the many awards and other gestures of recognition its been getting lately.  That ultra sleek and nearly invisible  it's so low-key front door of theirs is nothing short of a portal into a beautiful world of delicious exclusivity.  Probably best described as transcendent cool, the room just kind of sprawls in warm non-clamorous  serenity.  Even though the dining room reeked of sophistication, there was something very relaxed about it that probably came from the energy of the other diners.  Despite the clinically efficient wait staff bustling about in their Matrix black outfits, diners didn't display too much of that hushed reverential quiet you can experience at some culinary cathedrals.  People were clearly enjoying themselves as well as the food.  And, in complete accord with the buzz, experiencing the food turned out to be a confrontation with perfection.  We did the 12 course with wine pairing so the list of things to rave about is endless.  I don't think I need to go there though. What stands out about that unforgettable night is consistently stunning executions of inspired dining concepts.  According to Chantelle, the restaurant's delightful sommelier, they are all the chef's sole creation.  That little revelation may not be unusual, but when you have the opportunity to taste what a master cook can create, that same revelation leaves one a little awed.  Those concepts often reflected two worlds, Japanese (I think) and French, uniting triumphantly on a plate or in a bowl.  When the chef skewed more French, you could tell he was really in his game.  I can think of only a couple of minor missteps where somebody in the kitchen was using the saltshaker a little too liberally.  In the scheme of the evening, these were trifling footnotes.  The superiority of the wine pairings constituted the night's unexpected bonus.  Never, in our experience, were they joined so well.  Unless you're Daddy Warbucks, L20's definitely a special occasion destination.  One that you'll never forget and, if you're serious about exceptional food, long to return to.",0.9949,0.815,0.163,0.022,0.4914648910411622

My date and I went for the 4 course option, and split everything, which gave us an 8 course meal more or less.  After watching the couple across from us try their best to finish their 12 course meal, and not quite making it, you should be quite famished if not coming out of a fast for that meal to be achievable in its entirety.  And unless you are a souffle fanatic, DO NOT order two souffles for your last course - this is a huge souffle that could be a meal on its own.  It's delightful, but be mindful of the portions.  We shared one, and it was perfectly light and fluffy, but I don't think I could have had one by myself.   The highlights were the pain au lait, sashimi appetizer (that kampachi was out of this world - I thought the fish was a smidge too cold, like it just came out of defrosting, but my date didn't notice), the tuna tomato with foie gras snow, diver scallops, the striped bass, and the macaroon. We also opted for affordable wine, and yes, you can get them on their extensive wine list, and the sommelier was more than accommodating with our request to recommend bottles for us.  We ended up getting a bottle and supplementing with two glasses of riesling -If I were to go back, I would certainly try their wine pairing.  It is pricy at 95, but something tells me it would totally be worth it!",0.9901,0.833,0.144,0.024,0.5335497835497836

Fear not and break through those gentle, blond Sen wood doors to L2O!  Reservation are indeed accepted and required.  A Monday night promises a quiet, thoughtful investment with small interruptions of edible art.   You are within the Tree Room, designed by Architect Dirk Dension to the beat of simple, clean lines where food is the anticipated guest of honour, where the sommelier's presence is a welcomed distraction and a tocsin to what lies ahead.   A four-course tasting menu is offered aside from the chef's tête-à-tête which concentrates on harmonizing two ingredients: rien de plus!   Your demise may begin with: a smoked salmon theme.  An amuse-bouche of shashimi-sliced smoked salmon, smoked salmon foam and a light bridge of chives to connect to smoked salmon gel.   Fatty tuna tartare with an herbal sorbet.  The contrast of oil density and cool, crisp sorbet will awaken your stomach if the presecco hasn't already.   Small rations of in-house breads along with in-house butter are offered as a quick break before plunging into the menu, propre.  A table beside begins to enjoy a series of sashimi-sliced fluke atop small mounds of porcelain and blond wooden bridges.  The aroma of lemongrass and orange perfumes our space.   Your first encounter with the modern seafood menu which honours the waters of Japan may start with small portions of fluke topped with oysters and bathing in a sake-daikon broth.  Or perhaps your palette prefers something more dense, rich and oily.  Retreat to five portions of an incarnadine red-miso marinated shimaaji with baby radishes and soy salt.  The additional makerel oil is simply decadent!  The sommelier is back to pair this with a Riesling. More decadence awaits with pan-seared foie gras fashioned with cocoa nibs, port meringue bâtonnettes, and apple-celery stools capped with cocoa gel.  I preferred the continuation of the sea's bounty with kampachi, chirimenjacko, heart of palm, and pomegranate.  My dish was balanced with a floral and delicate Chokaisan Junmai sake.  The crispy fried minnows atop the kampachi played well against the soft vanilla crème fraîche and pomegranate gel.   Onto the warm course of lobster bits, carrot purés, pineapple, yellow curry, and .coconut powder. This powder is ethereal and balances the hearty lobster bites.  I continue onto my own demise of black sea bass, shellfish bouillon, saffron, and Rhode Island mussels. The bass steak is capped with a light egg brioche where below those mussels lay siege to the walls of bass amidst a moat of saffron shellfish bouillon.   Is there still room for more?  But we've yet to pass onto dessert! A Meyer lemon marshmallow ramekin reminds us that harmony and balance again play a crucial role as yet another waiter serves us, always ubiquitous, never bothersome.   Finally a decadent Grand Marinier orange soufflé is presented, christened as a light orange marmelade spills inside.  I retreat to a more savory offering of five cheeses of cow, sheep and goat all continental aside from an English Stilton.   And if this wasn't enough we are presented with a blood-orange effervescent and shortly afterwards a yuzu macaroon as pillowy as a gnocchi.   We are briefly taking into the kitchen and tatami rooms where one has the option of a large multi-course tasting complete with traditional kaiseki service or an more intimate tatami experience for two, complete with multiple sliding doors for discretion and impeccable service.   In all, L2O embodies a passion for the exotique, harmonious, balanced.  Whilst the price may not be feasible for a weekly tasting, it is certainly worth it's weight amongst it's creative, modern gourmet restaurants.  Doumo arigatou gozai-masu!",0.9949,0.866,0.116,0.017,0.4904351395730706

So velvety.  Salt cod and caviar with potato froth was great too.  As was the Pork belly with a truffle sauce and potato three-ways.  In fact, I loved all of the courses.  Usually, that doesn't happen for me in a prolonged tasting menu, but this was really something special.       Also, the bread and butter were fantastic.  The butter is made in-house and has a nutty quality almost like Indian ""Ghee"".  Just imagine spreading some ghee onto a bacon roll.  I don't think it gets any better than that. This meal did have two courses of salmon and one with arctic char (almost the same as salmon) and two courses with Tuna.  So that made five of the 16 courses centered on salmon and tuna.  On one hand, I would have liked more variety, but on the other hand, each of these dishes were distinct enough to warrant essentially one third of the courses dedicated to two fish.    If I had to choose least favorites, I would lean toward the carmalized skate wing with winter greens and purple cauliflower, because the sauce was over-salted.  Also, the ""praline, praline"" was a touch too sweet for me.  But both were delicious nonetheless and i devoured every last morsel on the plate.  Perhaps if the previous courses hadn't been so amazingly stellar, I would have liked these even more.   Aside from the food, everything was perfect.  Design aspects were beautiful, restrained and luxurious.  Service was flawless and relaxed.  Bathrooms were sleek, space-age vessels that I imagined could transport me to a secret part of the restaurant.   But all these components would have been moot if the food didn't deliver.  But, oh, how it did.  Flavors and textures are still haunting me.  The food just put a smile on my face that didn't leave until i ate breakfast the next morning and realized that food wouldn't continue to be a wonderful sensory discovery like it was the night before.  Until I return again...",0.9982,0.79,0.204,0.006,0.5029304029304029

I had to approach the evening with a sense of both confidence and humility. I have to say, the foreplay was amazing! The anticipation was building in every second...in every sip of the promise ahead. First we sat down at our table, listened to our highly skilled and very well-spoken server, as she described the evening to come. Then, we ordered our culinary paths to Valhalla together.  The beauty of the evening began to fade and wrinkle as we ate more and more. While the superficial elegance of each dish arrived its beauty was unquestionable, the real substance and flavor of my date (with L20) began ""shine"" through. (It's not as if she snorted when she laughed. I would have welcomed that.) The problem was that, below the surface, the soul and flavor of everything we consumed was not very exciting. 'Hollow' would be the word to describe this part of the date.  Alas, sweet L20, while you are beautiful, but you're not for me.",0.9626,0.828,0.146,0.026,0.5518803418803419
2008-11-04,2.0,"Did the 12-course taster Sunday night (which was actually more like 17 courses including all the amuses and freebie extras included). I love seafood, as well as all foods and flavors Japanese, so I was really looking forward to experiencing L2O. Unfortunately I left disappointed in several respects. First, the service was fine, but not as good nor perceptive as what you would expect from restaurants of this caliber (in particular Alinea, where the servers I've had have always been absolutely first class, Moto, and Everest). The descriptions of the food came off as rushed, and we ended up not really knowing exactly what many of the elements on the plate were.  The first four courses were one-to-two bite portions of raw fish, which were good, but nothing ground-breaking, and frankly the similarity among these dishes became monotonous by the fourth time around. Not to mention, we were starving, and waiting til the fifth service to get anything remotely satiating was a bit irritating. Over the course of the tasting we had a decent sized portion of sea bass, followed by a decent sized portion of swordfish, and then some lobster gelee with morels, followed by a generous portion of fatty pork belly. Each of these dishes was quite savory (little acid, little sweetness; just lots of salty/bitter flavors), each came with a sauce of a similar velvety consistency (or foam) and brown color, and so to me, these also became somewhat monotonous. It would serve this restaurant well to pare down their tasting menu a bit, say to 10 courses. As it stands now, there are far too many courses, with too little distinguishing each one (in terms of compositions, colors, flavors, ingredients, textures). In particular, I wish they mixed in some sweeter or tangier flavors; overall the flavors impressed me as quite salty, and sometimes bitter. I felt a little like I'd waited to have the same dish served to me several times in a row. I left uncomfortably full, which hasn't happened to me at Alinea, Trotters, or Moto after elaborate tastings. I wasn't even looking forward to the four dessert courses by the end of the savory courses, which is VERY rare for me, as I'm an avid sweet tooth. Bottom line, if you're a foodie, try it to see what the hype is all about. And indeed, the design of the restaurant's interior is beautiful, original and very comfortable, making it almost worth the trip on its own.  But at the end of the day, I would rank this place last in terms of special occasion dinner destinations I've experienced in the city.",0.9869,0.821,0.127,0.052,0.48388222888222887

If you are rolling into L2O with just two of you request the ""marble"" table.  I'm not sure if they call it that but there is one two top that is sunk into the wall surrounded by marble and the table is also marble.",0.9211,0.841,0.146,0.013,0.6889898989898989

If I could eat triple portions of only the 4 tops things I would still be in heaven. For such an upscale place the service was very surprisingly ""normal"".  I mean that in the best way -- the servers were polite and friendly normal people and didn't act all formal and weird like it can get at some fine-dining places. The setting was gorgeous, not a bad seat/view in the house, and it felt festive in a very posh way.  So you're dropping a pretty penny at L20 (about 66,000 to be exact for 2 people but we each had 4 drinks) but its worth it for a rare special treat.",0.9975,0.626,0.364,0.01,0.574578373015873

We opted for the 12 course tasting menu (how could we not?) and I also went with the wine pairing, luckily my wife helped with that as otherwise I might have not made it thru the dinner gracefully (see my Moto experience). If you like Tru and you like seafood (sometimes raw), then you MUST try L2O. Before deciding to go, I had perused their blog,  l2o.typepad.com  and was able to see the attention to detail chef Laurent Gras puts into everything.

2008-09-23,5.0,"Once upon a time there was an impeccably flawless restaurant named L20.  Inside L20 were many fine items of the most exquisite detail intended to impress and pleasure even the highest of caliber of distinction. There were walls of the finest walnut and suede - rich and elegant - the softest of carpets to hush even the highest of stilettos, ornate yet subtle lighting hung aloft glass enclosed Hawaiian ginger, even an aquarium in the WC to wee wee aside. L20 made many young boys and girls feel unique and distinguished, indeed. Little was left to chance at L20, with the tiniest of minutia meticulously appointed to. Beautiful Reidel stemware, stainless deco shakers arriving table side on carts which appeared to ride on air, hushed voices, marble flatware rests, glass encased butter domes, an amuse bouche of silky milk skin, little neck clam and salty sea bean. You can imagine what happens to poor L20 should it make a misstep. Nasty step-Mother LEYE is not to be scorned or to the stockade you go!  Luckily, lofty L20 is quite the workhorse, a trusty companion never to falter as quality is not just a standard, but exceeds traditional requirements. From the heavenly bread basket comprised of different doughy wonders adorned with anchovy, bacon and mustard-seed or just kissed with a savory salt, to the surprises you find around every corner - oh my! - like beet gnocchi floating in lobster consomme, cantaloupe shaved ice or a gooey pistachio french macaroon, you are kept on your toes and always wanting more. Almost. While L20 may plate up small, you will find that 4 courses plus extras shall be plenty for even the heartiest of appetite. You may be enticed by the 12 course full tasting, but a fast will be in order pre-dine. No need to be greedy children as this muse is already intense in small proportion, you're not at Friday's and TGForThat.  While the magical L20 kitchen primes your perfectly timed dishes you'll be entertained by incredibly knowledgeable, gracious and hospitable staff. L20 may even introduce you to Robert if you are so lucky. He will top off your champagne while no one is looking, make suggestions uncanny to your likes, even escort you to the amphibious wee wee room - no water wings required. If you really mind your p's and q's you might even get a peak at the back of the house complete with private rooms, hot and cold kitchens and to-die-for spice closet. Service? No, this is a ritual in indulgence. While you are indulging, put items like the salted cod with creamed potatoes, hamachi with foie gras, golden egg yolk with korubuta pork and the lobster main plate on your list. Sparkling with a dust of gold, dancing in a pool of squid ink or resting next to sour apple granite each culinary pearl more overwhelmingly scrumptious than the next.   You can see friends why L20 has been dubbed habit forming, with such addictive properties lots of little kiddies have been known to fall down it's rabbit hole enticed by such dramatic dining landscape. Way down at the bottom of the cavernous hole you'll find all types of goodies and treasures calling to you for one more taste. Glistening plates of pulled sugar, fluffy meringue, souffles of praline and Grand Marnier, sticks of chocolate and of course raspberry cotton candy, a dream for any young soul. A treat of something sweet is always impossible to resist and L20 is known for this brand of beauty. Hurry up and grab a sugar bubble before it pops!

2008-09-21,5.0,"I have a new crush. His name is Chef Laurent Gras, and he is amazing.  L2O is a dining destination. Perfect for a small group of chic ladies or a romantic night out, the experience is decadent, and tantalizing to the senses. The decor is a bit too minimalist for my taste, but very well done. Tables are very well set apart, the lighting is soft, and the floors are carpeted to absorb any sound coming from neighboring tables. The chairs are very comfortable, allowing diners to lounge while enjoying a beautiful meal. I was very much fond of the Riedel stemware... so much so that I asked where they were from.  The food... oh the food. Every course was layered with different flavors, each bite to be savored. I seriously could feel the endorphin levels increase in my brain as I enjoyed each bite. I ordered two warm dishes and a main course. Amuse of Milk Skin and Sea Bean Seafood Platter Hamachi, Foie Gras, Mojama Lobster Consumme Salted Cod, Fingerling Potato, Smoked Gelatin, Caviar Skate Wing, Bordelaise, Asparagus Cantaloupe Shaved Ice Praline Souffle Passionfruit Marshmallow Pistachio French Macaron  I am usually really good about picking out a favorite dish, but I have to say that I LOVED all of them equally the same. All were beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Also, the bread selection was one of my favorite things about the restaurant. A selection of five different types, my favorites were the Anchovy Brioche, Salted Milk Bread, and the Bacon Mustard Seed Bread.  [For the dessert master, Atif I.] - The souffle was an excellent way to end a perfect meal - it came out hot, about an inch above the ramekin. When the server cracked the top and poured the praline sauce, a sweet and sinful aroma took over my senses. Although I was completely full from the meal, I indulged in every bite of the souffle, and loved it.  Finally, as if we weren't spoiled enough, we were presented with a delightful pistachio French Macaron. My absolute favorite cookie, this one had slightly more filling than usual and sat on the plate like a shiny green jewel. The sweet chewiness made me want to take a box home with me.  Our server, Robert... lets just say I wanted to take him home with me. He was exceptional. He was so friendly and made fantastic menu recommendations. He even gave us a tour of the kitchen. I would have loved to have met Chef Laurent, but it was about 12:30 when we left!  The restaurant also has a private Japanese tatami room, reserved for parties doing the 20-course menu. I don't think I could ever eat 20-courses, but I'd love the experience.  What I loved most about the restaurant was that it was a truly decadent experience without the pretension.

2008-09-21,4.0,"I was lucky enough to dine at L2O with the beautiful and intelligent Brett D., Caroline A. and Lauren H.  After making the reservation 6 weeks in advance, we spent the waiting period fantasizing about what it would be like and we were fortunate that L2O did not disappoint! Our server Robert got the pleasure of our table, or we got the pleasure of his service, but either way all 5 of us had a wonderful time. We showed up early and enjoyed drinks in the lounge before we were seated.  Wine and champagne were poured at the table as well as my martini which was shaken, in a beautiful and uniquely shaped shaker, tableside.   To start we shared the seafood platter for the table which was served on a specially formed ice cube which fit in a long rectangular dish, rather than the traditional shaved ice.   The seafood was covered with white foam; while it made for deciphering the fish a little difficult it added a wonderful citrus essence.  Although small, we all shared the lobster, oysters, uni and clam nicely. With Robert's help we navigated the choices on the 4 course prix fixe meal and ended up with some amazing items.  The kitchen was very accommodating in letting us pick and chooses between the first two course options; rather than ordering one cold course and one warm, all of us opted for two warm courses.  The salted cod, which was served with smoothly whipped potatoes and caviar and came in beautiful glass was to die for- although I was the only one who did not order it, my dining companions were nice enough to share! I had the lobster mushroom prepared two ways, grilled and poached, and the hamachi and foie gras as my first two courses.  My main was the striped bass which came with mussels and a saffron sauce.  It was the perfect amount of food and tasted fresh and amazing.  Although they had a wide selection of teas, I opted for coffee with go with my dessert of strawberry, tomato and black pepper meringue.  I enjoyed parts of the dessert but unfortunately my palate is not ready for tomato in a dessert.  In an innovative and modern seafood restaurant I had no expectations about the bread but it turned out to be as top notch as the rest.  The selection of home baked bread was unbelievable and the other ladies and I were not shy about engorged ourselves on seconds of the different rolls (ok it was actually thirds!)  In addition to the traditional pain de campagne, baguette and wheat roll there was a flakey brioche with anchovies, a roll made with bacon (yes, bacon in bread is amazing as it sounds) and a melt in your mouth milk roll. The additionals from the kitchen included a bite of milk skin with little a neck clam, a lobster consume, cantaloupe shaved ice, a passion fruit marshmallow and a pistachio cookie.  They were all fun surprises that were plated beautifully and, while I did not enjoy the marshmallow, they were great ways to try additional items and flavor combinations from the kitchen.  Service was impeccable as was to be expected.  To say Robert was very familiar with the menu would be an understatement- his knowledge and fun personality made the meal so much more enjoyable.  The chairs were pulled out, napkins were refolded and the utensils and plateware were changed at least ten times over the span of the 4 course meal!  We were offered a tour of the restaurant and kitchen after the meal which gave us a great taste of what the back of the house looks like and how many people are working together to create such an incredible experience. I loved it all: ambiance, company, service and of course the food.",0.9993,0.743,0.222,0.035,0.6138780169602088
2008-09-21,5.0,"I am a Pisces, sign of the fish, and I am convinced I was a fish in a past life or will be one in a future reincarnation, so when Erin P asked me if I wanted in on L20, I did not hesitate.  For 6 weeks, I counted down to this haven of seafood goodness, and it did not disappoint. We opted for the four course prix fixe.  We were started off with an amuse bouche of milk skin with a little neck clam and sea bean.  So smooth, salty, tasty, just a wonderful little bite.  We were also given an amuse bouche of lobster consomme with golden beet gnocchi and a piece of lobster, and I could have swam in it for the rest of my life, it was so amazing.  We shared a shellfish platter, and I must confess, this disappointed me...for the price, I expected more than about 6-8 tiny morsels covered in white foam (clam, uni, octopus, shrimp, and lobster).  Next time I don't think I would bother to order the extra dish, the courses we had would have been enough.  We amused the waiter by consuming more bread than any table he has ever had, and even this reviewer, who isn't usually much of a bread fan, had thirds.  The breads were: a demi-baguette, country bread, brioche with anchovy, a twist with bacon and mustard seed (yum), and a milk roll with salt on it, which was heaven on a plate.  My first course was the salted cod with whipped potatoes, smoked gelatin noodles, topped with caviar.  It was delicious.  I also tasted Erin's lobster mushroom prepared grilled and poached and served with butter powder, saffron powder, and orange and togarashi, and it was incredible as well.  My second course was the gold egg yolk (there was gold powder on it, like you usually see on desserts) with kampachi, korubuta pork, covered in a pork jus, with bits of apple and emerald lettuce and served with a sour green apple gratinee on the side.  It was good, but I think I would have liked my pork a tad crispier.  Caroline had the foie gras and hamachi with raspberry and ginger and really enjoyed it.  For the main course I had cod with green olive, meyer lemon, and white grits.  Unfortunately it also came with squid ink which the menu hadn't mentioned and I wish it had because I think I would have ordered differently.  It was still good, I am just not a fan of squid ink so I just ate the lemon sauce.  Caroline had the skate wing with bordelaise and asparagus, Erin had the striped bass with saffron boullion and mussels (what I think I would have had), and Brett had the lobster with a foie gras emulsion, peach, and cauliflower balls.  Our next amuse bouche was a canteloupe shaved ice, hit the spot perfectly.  For dessert Erin tried the strawberry, black pepper and tomatoe dish which was a miss for her, Caroline and Brett both had the praline souffle which was very good, and I had heaven on a plate in the form of rasberry and chocolate presented 16 different ways (8 raspberry, 8 chocolate--raspberry sorbet, raspberries, raspberry meringues which were so light and airy they literally melted immediately in my mouth, raspberry cotton candy, chocolate mousse, chocolate branches, and some other chocolate things I don't even know what they were but they were delicious).  After the dessert we had two more amuses, a passionfruit marshmellow which I unfortunately must say I found terrible (though I like marshmellows and passionfruit), and a pistachio French macaroon (which was good, but I wish I had stopped at my dessert).  We also had champagne, but I should note here the bottle prices were not priced favorably, it was cheaper to order our Roederer by the glass. Our server Robert was the fifth star, we could not have asked for a more amiable guide through our journey.  After 3+ hours, I think we were his last table (it was around midnight by then), so he gave us a back of the house tour.  The kitchen was spotless and had some interesting machines as well, the spice closet was awe-inspiring, the tatami room made me dream of going back (20 courses for $250, I am so saving up for that one), the private party rooms were cozy, and he kindly took several pictures of us in various locales.  Plus, they have a town car outside which drove 2 of us home. Now I have to think of some special occasions as excuses to go back for the 12 course and for the tatami room! edit: how could I forget Lou in the loo? One of the WCs had a fish tank right next to the toilet.  Must confess, it weirded me out a little.  But it was still pretty cool.",0.9976,0.833,0.134,0.033,0.4590838001867414

The anticipation of what was next kept the night light and airy. We were seated the corner, in a banquette. Perfect for sitting beside eachother, rather than across the table.  We were able to quickly survey the room and were welcomed by our server.  We enjoyed the 12 course meal, and as everyone has suggested, was turned into a rather lengthy meal.  12 courses intermittently sprinkled with numerous amuse bouches and tantilizing desserts.  We paired our meal with the wines offered by the sommelier and were mesmerized by the compliments to each dish. Laurent was not present on the night in which we dined, but the execution of his dishes were impeccably presented.  I was quickly reminded of the divinity of dining in San Francisco.  After years in the mecca, I am often underwhelmed by the plethora of meats on the menus in Chicago restaurants.  Fish and seafood have always been my preference and Laurent has masterfully delivered.

2008-09-07,5.0,"Hey, yeah, it's good stuff! A friend suggested I try this place out, upon learning on short notice that I'd be visiting Chicago. We snapped up a Sunday reservation with 3 days notice, no problem. Love the door, it's like a secret entrance. Can't find it, then NO L20 FOR YOU.  Hanging out in the little lounge area is also nice. Like a little calm moment of zen before the culinary explosion blows up in your face. I happened to like the white pod chairs, but my uber tall dining companion didn't. We secretly prayed for seats on the wall sofa section...and got them. Sweet. Opted for the four course menu, so we could divide up the options. I adored everything I got, in fact, I felt quite the smug winner that the stuff I ordered was really cool and yummy and delicious and awesome. Amuse buche: something really small and salty. More on that later. Raw: sashimi platter. Three or four kinds of raw fish, each with interesting textures and accompaniments. Only one had wasabi, so the others were very new flavors for me.  Warm: hamachi and foie gras. *TUD* like I fainted and went to heaven. Three fat slices of pure foie gras, seared on one side. Perhaps my favorite dish of the evening.  Main: lobster with peach, tarragon and cauliflower fritters. Lobster with tarragon was rocking my world. So delicious. The cauliflower fritters were also crumbed with these crunchy little beads, which was a great contrast to the smooth puree of the cauliflower. Intermission: melon sorbet with lime. Unexpected and very tasty. It was half like granita and half like sorbet. Nice texture. Dessert: chocolate and raspberries. It was more like 5 or 6 desserts with all the various ways the chocolate and raspberries were presented. Frozen, smooth, dark, milk, foam, COTTON CANDY, gells, polka dots. The server did not have to ask me if I enjoyed it. Surprise: a button of chocolate fizzy something. It just popped and fizzed in a pleasant and surprising way. Rich person's version of pop rocks.  Extra surprise: pistachio macaroon.  They took care of us until near 1 am, then sent us home in a nice car that was even less expensive than the gnarly cab that got us there. They also sent us home with a beautiful sealed envelope containing our menus for the evening. I give it 5 stars even though: * Janky cab totally took us to the wrong address. Not L20's fault, of course, but it was a crap way to start the evening. * The amuse buche kinda sucked. My spoon tasted of rotten metallic eggs, it was super gross. It was the tinest morsel of food, but it did make me really nervous how the rest of the meal was going to turn out. * The bathroom locks. Really cool restrooms, but for some reason none of the patrons who used the restrooms thought they locked. I visited there twice and both times pushed right in on someone else doing their business. What is up with that? I could see and use the locks, why couldn't anyone else? Really embarrassing. I had to sit in there and watch the lone guppy potter around his little aquatic garden tank for several minutes to mull over this confusing situation. Other quirk of the evening: the little rolling boxes that contain extra napkins and silverware and trays. The staff there push them around, constantly pulling odds and bobs out of them. I called them cabooses because they simply followed people around. Are there midgets in there handing goodies out?",0.9987,0.737,0.205,0.058,0.53778870383348

I didn't love it -- I guess I would give it a ""like.""  The service was impeccable and ambience sleek, but I had a real problem with the quality of food for the price.  Now, I'm not one to shy away from dropping alot of money on food (a recent $350/pp meal at Le Bernardin was no problem for me as each course was delicious) when the food deserves it, but this just seemed like, for lack of a better word, a ripoff. We both ordered the 4-course prix fixe with wine pairings.  Two amuse bouches preceeded the meal (peanut butter sponge with wasabi, and some sort of foam with salmon and gelee something or other.  I'm not huge on foam and the taste of these didn't really do it for me).  First course - I had the hamachi and tuna checkerboard, very good, but nothing wow to me.  The small size of the wine pour for this course was ridiculous.  Mind you, these were not supposed to be ""tasting"" portions as one would get with a 12-course tasting menu -- we were charged BY THE GLASS so my first course cost essentially $14 for about 2 ounces of wine.  Really? Second course - I had the golden egg with pork and date had lamb tartar.  The egg was yummy and presentation impressive.  Pork was good, but I've had much better (Custom House comes to mind).  Main - skate wing for me and pork belly for date.  Ditto comment on the pork belly as for my warm course -- just not up to par as other places in the city (and for the price, this had better be the best!).  The skate wing was the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked and in a very tasty bordelaise sauce.   Dessert was fantastic.  I had the praline praline souflee, date had the orange mandarin souflee.  Absolutely delicious.  They somewhat helped to stomach the fact that we were charged $5 apiece for... coffee. But what really surprised us was when we said yes, we would like for them to call a taxi for us and instead the doorman told us that the house car could take us home.  Awesome bonus....until the driver tells us (after we're in the car) that it will be $15 -- a trip that was $10 in a taxi on the way there.  I don't want to sound like a cheapskate, and yes it was only $5 - but shouldn't the doorman have simply said, ""our house car can take you home, it will cost $15"" instead of implying that it would be comped? Oh -- and we were celebrating my birthday, so the printed message on the menu was a nice touch.  We were not, however, offered a kitchen tour as many mentioned they have. To wrap it up, as I mentioned at the start -- I'm not one to shy away from spending alot of money on food, when it's worth it.  My conclusion is that the critics are hopping on the bandwagon on this one and it's simply not worth the price for what you get.  Stick with Alinea, North Pond, I'd even pick Spring over L2O for a bang-up seafood meal.",0.9975,0.787,0.164,0.05,0.5529813664596274
2008-09-01,4.0,"Brilliant presentation. Creatively subdued ambiance. Impeccable service. An amazing motley crue of fine dining characters, one wearing a black hat the size of the table. And the food's not too shabby. All making L20 quite the upscale extravaganza.  We did the 4 course. Think this is a better bet. By sharing, you pretty much can sample all of the high points of the 12 course menu. We followed the majority of the staff's recommendations. The sashimi in the raw course was an amazingly edible tic tac toe board. The salted cod with caviar and skate wing main were also unbeatable. Was mildly disappointed by the peekytoe crab and lamb loin. And the raspberry chocolate dessert was a bit of a hodge podge train wreck.  I'm equally perplexed and infatuated by the magic stations on wheels that accompany each table.  The check induced Catholic guilt in me (even though I'm not Catholic and it was part of a birthday binge). L20 definitely comes at a heftier price tag that beats Moto, Schwa and others. But for fine dining whores, the experience should still wow you.",0.9313,0.783,0.147,0.07,0.6290523968784838
2008-08-01,5.0,"My recent visit to L2O was truly an amazing experience! Everything from the Wine service to the opportunity to tour the kitchen at the end of my evening was memorable.  I had the 12 course menu which actually turned out to be 19 by the time I counted all the added little treats they sent my way.  Some of my favorites included housemade Tofu Tomato Broth, the Shimaaji with Red Miso, Radish and Soy Salt, the Lobster Dumpling in Lobster Bisque, the Cantaloupe Ice and and the Chocolate Ganache.  There were many more, but I am a lousy typist and it would take me three hours to go into detail! The wine pairings were also fun and worked well with every course.  Once again L2O was an amazing night out!  Thank you Chef Gras!",0.9579,0.794,0.172,0.034,0.4863636363636364
2008-07-20,1.0,"I can see why people are giving this place high marks. The space is pretty, sleek. The service is outstanding, attentive. The menu is very aspirational- it certainly sounds impressive. And the critics' reviews have been very strong.  However, this emperor is completely threadbare when it comes to the food. While decor/service are pieces of the dining puzzle, what ultimately matters at a restaurant is the food. Especially at $165 a person. At that price point, the diner should be carried away into a garden of culinary delights, surprised and entranced at each scrumptious turn. A good tasting menu at a restaurant of this caliber hopscotches between hot and cold, sweet and savory with whimsical precision. Whether it's in the vein of Thomas Keller, who is the very manifestation of methodical perfection, or shades of a mad scientist like Wylie Dufresne or Grant Achatz, the point is clear: the guest should walk away blown away.  L20 attempts to foray into the style of Alinea/Moto, and it's a sadly shoddy imposter. We opted for the long tasting menu. It's oddly ordered, with essentially a clump of cold dishes, a clump of hot, and then dessert. The first several courses consisted of various types of raw or undercooked fish (or lobster CLAW meat). Then we moved on to a handful of cooked fish dishes; over each one, some consomme was poured. And little polka dots of things like liquified herbs or super concentrated balsamic dotted each plate. So repetitive. So uninspired. My stomach was churning from all the raw fish repetition. I love sushi. But a tasting menu that runs $165 a pop should not be an endless string of semi frozen fish.  The bread selection would have been a saving grace if it had been warmed- they had twists with bacon in them, and brioche stuffed with anchovies. Alas, no such luck- these baked goodies were ice cold and rock hard.  My dining companion and I spent the entire meal talking about other restaurants. I very nearly got up and went to McD halfway through. Oh and then I BURNED my mouth on DRY ICE. Yes, you read that correctly. There was a dish - the first interesting one!- that came with a freeze dried carrot scoop. However no one told me there was dry ice on it. I popped the whole thing into my mouth. For 30 seconds I was Puff the Magic Dragon - gusts of smoke streaming out of my nose, mouth, and possibly ears. The dragon experience was the saving grace of the meal, despite the fact that it left my lips and tongue blistered, because it was at least amusing.  After ending with a soggy souffle, we headed over to Quartino for pizza.",0.9955,0.799,0.164,0.037,0.6127788303650373
2008-06-18,5.0,"Once every couple of years, we afford ourselves a fine dining experience and L20 was everything we had looked forward to. I guess I'll break my review down into the goods and bads, as there were both, unfortunately. The good: the good was VERY GOOD. First of all, we had the best table in the place (in my opinion). It's the table in the corner with the corner leather couch as seating. Oh by the way, if you want to be tucked away in a corner to smooch with your sweety, this table isn't for you. There's a lot of traffic in front of this table but we enjoyed watching the action. The food was amazing! Honestly, we didn't know what we were eating. Our server would tell us it was (for example) toro but she could've said the sauce was a reduction of pea (not pee) stains from her sock and we wouldn't have ever thought that was a bad thing coming from the kitchen because everything was (once again) AMAZING! We had the 12 course tasting menu along with the wine pairings. This is the way to go because it gives you a bit of everything. Just know that it's going to take 5 hours and if you consume almost all of the wine they serve (as we did), you're gonna leave very happy. (I'm not much of a wine drinker so I left very tired). Also, you're going to be very full. We lost count but we think we had a total of about 16-18 tasting courses. Make sure you leave room for the souffle dessert.  The service was outstanding! Our server was very friendly and I think she knew early on that we weren't high brow uppity ups but just a couple out for a fun night albeit at a fine dining establishment.  I'm not sure if it's because we're fun people or they offer this to anyone whose check is going to be close to the rent of some Lincoln Park apartments but we got to tour the restaurant and the kitchen. Then as we were kissing and hugging our goodbyes with the staff (just kidding), we were handed 2 envelopes. The first contained our menu and the second contained a card listing our wines hand-written by our sommelier.  Now on to the bad (sorry, L20. There was some bad). For such a high-end restaurant, do you really think patrons should stand in line for the bathroom? There are 2 coed bathrooms and except for once, there was a line. That's it, or at least that's all I can remember.  If you like fine dining, raw fish, pea reduction and have a fat wallet, definitely go treat yourself to one of the finest restaurants in Chicago.",0.9972,0.797,0.169,0.033,0.5603717948717948
2008-06-15,5.0,"L2O is an insanely wonderful dining experience. Everything about this place is chic, upscale, and impeccable. I went here last night for dinner with my family, who was visiting from out of town. The speciality here is seafood, specifically avant garde technique with some molecular gastronomy thrown in for good measure. As has been said, you can choose between a 12 course tasting or a 4 course menu, and we did the 4 course, for 110 a person, which is pricey, yes, but in my opinion completely worth it. The 4 course menu is divided into the sections Raw, Cold, Warm, and Dessert. Each course has about 10 choices-my sister is a strict vegetarian, and as they are very low on vegetarian menu options, they prepared her 3 lovely dishes that were not even on the menu, that we just as delicious and artfully presented as the rest of the food.  The 110 dollars really goes a long way here. The decor is understated and neutral, yet pleasant. The service is impeccable; our waiter was charming and knowledgeable, attentive yet unobtrusive, all of the things that you want during a gourmet meal. They have a female sommelier (rare!) and thus get extra points from me; she was lovely and helped us pick out a bottle of Austrian Riesling that was one of the best wines I've ever had. The meal included 2 delicious amuse bouches (a clam soup and a piece of lobster), generous bread service with a wide selection of house made breads and butter, as well as a palette cleanser before dessert. I ordered the geoduck for my first course, which was done as a ceviche, simple yet incredibly flavorful. My second course was a perfectly cooked scallop with passionfruit and sea beans, as well as a table-side presentation for the sauce. I got sturgeon for the third course, which was probably the best piece of fish that I have ever eaten. Dessert was what really sealed the deal for me-I got a coconut and key lime tasting, which included nearly 15 different preparations of the same ingredients. My father got a rhubarb dessert that included the most delicious sorbet I had ever eaten. On top of that, we all got a piece of chocolate orange AND the best macaroons that I have ever had outside of France, pistachio, my favorite flavor. At the end of the meal they gave us our menus to take home, which was a nice touch.  Every part of the experience, from the service to the food to the adorable bathroom with the fish tank, was perfectly lovely. This place has only been open for one month, and I am sure that as word gets around it will receive more press and attention. I am excited to see what chef Gras comes up with as the restaurant continues to grow-it's only been open a month, and it's already fucking awesome.",0.9991,0.766,0.229,0.006,0.6078058373250682
2008-06-06,5.0,"Impeccable.  Absolutely impeccable.  L2.0 is one of the newest dining experiences in Chicago and it rivals the likes of Alinea, Schwa and Sixteen with its innovative food, personal service and beautiful surroundings. Located in the former Ambria space inside the historic Beldon Stratford Hotel, L2.0 delights from the second you pull open the modernistic door.   You see the ebony columns, the sense of intimacy lent from the floor to ceiling wires that create a ""room"" where there is none-  the onyx table that lends a sense of intimacy to a small area for that perfect romantic dinner or even the semi private dining area, L2.0 is all about the experience. The servers work from gueridons (small wooden carts) that they maneuver around the room. Food is a ceremony here- from the small ""amuse bouches"" that come out throughout the evening (last night we started with sea urchin with grapefruit and crystallized lettuce) and had several other ""tastes"" throughout the night, to the parade of entrees with 4 servers descending on your table with the bounty of food. As for the food- you can choose from a single selection ranging in price from $60 to $95 or choose the 4 course meal at $110 per person.  We chose the 4 course dinner and enjoyed an amazing breadth of tastes. I started with peekytoe crab which was served under a ""hood"" of sliced avocados- delicious!.  My next course was lobster bisque- so good that I wanted to lick the bowl (imagine that move in a place like this!)  Finally - for my entree- the skate wing served with sliced asparagus and bordelaise sauce.  We finished with a cheese plate and one of their signature desserts. This is pretty food.  Meant as much for the eyes as for the palate.  Portions are small and meant to be savored.  The wine list is amazing and the wine director certainly knows her stuff and will be glad to help you find just the perfect match.  We had a white Burgundy which was amazing. Service is over the top. You are escorted to the restroom (check those out- there are aquariums in the restrooms), helped in and out of your chair, and pampered and accommodated in every way possible.   L2.0 is a special place for that special evening out. And with the total bill equaling about $240 per person for dinner (including wine) while not something that you will do on a regular basis- it will make even a non occasion, a special occasion.",0.9967,0.843,0.157,0.0,0.5227191413237925
2008-05-16,5.0,"First of all, you cannot be the First to Review a new restaurant if you have not actually eaten there yet. Nice try, Jeverr W., but I don't think that's how this thing works.  Unlike Jeverr, I actually ate at L2O last night. I hesitate to write this review, because I honestly don't think my words could do this place justice. It was hands-down the most phenomenal dining experience I've had in my entire life. I don't even know where to start! But I will try. First, the restaurant itself is gorgeous. It looks nothing like that claustrophobic barf-fest that Ambria was. The layout is very open. There is no bar, per se, but a comfortable lounge of three tables and butter-soft, contemporary white leather chairs. Their lighting concept is brilliant, making all of the tabletops glow like uh, supernatural things. (Sorry this review sucks, I think I might still be drunk from last night...but bear with me.) I believe they have a water-themed decor, which they tied together perfectly, right down to the blue-tinted water glasses. Service was flawless. Normally, you would expect some kinks for a newly-opened restaurant, but everything went off without a hitch. Every single person was friendly, delightful, helpful, and informative. From the moment we walked in the door, we were treated with the utmost respect, which was really nice considering we are all in our twenties and staff at other upscale restaurants are often not so respectful of young people. Unlike most places, there is not a team of servers; rather, there is one person who takes care of the table from start to finish (lounge, seating, serving, etc.) Our waiter was great, and he had a smile on his face the whole time...a very natural looking smile, not a fake creepy one. Yay! Now to the drinks...My dates ordered vodka tonics, which they prepared on a cart at our table. They brought them carafes of tonic and served ice from a silver dish with tongs. Awesome! I had champagne, and later we shared a bottle of wine. The wine list was unbelievable. Even my friend, who is a wine expert of sorts didn't know where to start. So the sommelier helped us out. The only drawback is that the selection of wines by the glass is too limited, but this is probably something that will be worked out.  Even the bread service was fan-freaking-tastic!!! Both the bread and the butter are made in house. The bread is actually a station for chefs rather than for back waiters to just reheat bread that has been purchased from a bakery. They had a wide selection of bread, including bread with bacon and anchovies in it. Drool. And they bring you the bread between each course, which was nice. I ate way too much bread. Bad Jessa. Now on to the meal itself. You can choose between a 4 course meal and a 12 course tasting. We did the tasting. If I wasn't feeling Patrick Bateman enough already, I certainly was by the time they served the sea urchin with a sea urchin/lobster emulsion. Normally we do not like sea urchin but this was mouthwatering and sweet and then tangy! Another favorite was the octopus steamed in olive oil with coconut foam. I would never think to put those things together, but that's why I'm a lawyer, not a chef. One of the most delightful things we ate was the tiny piece at the beginning: the amuse bouche (micro asparagus, with little neck clam, and a skim milk skin yogurt). The milk was nice and rich and the microgreens were cool to look at. Yet another delicious dish was the peekytoe crab with the cilantro and jalapeno. The cilantro was very refreshing touch to go with the richness of the crab. Ummmm what else? The fluke with osetra caviar, lemon vinegar, and basil seeds was beautiful. It had a nice mild flavor, but was not overwhelmed by an overuse of caviar.  I cannot forget dessert: the praline souffle! O. M. G. It was the BEST souffle I've ever had, and I've eaten many a souffle in my day. It literally just melted in my mouth. Fabulous.  At the end of the meal, we got to tour the kitchen (holy crap, that was awesome!) and meet the chef, who is also awesome. And French. And friendly!  In conclusion, even though I spent more on this meal than I would on food for three weeks, I think it was worth every penny and I do not feel a shred of remorse. Go here!",0.9994,0.745,0.21,0.045,0.5800128462323584
