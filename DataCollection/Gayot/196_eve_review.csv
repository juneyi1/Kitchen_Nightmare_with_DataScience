Yes, I know the story of Eve (Biblical sense) and my dinner experience was very similar to the story. God in my story is played by the money in my wallet. Warning me about spending some much on the type of place I don't normally frequent (meaning that I've been to quite a few places that I've paid too much for either so little or so little in taste. It's also because I've had such amazing meals for so little of a cost**). I know I can be a bit picky or judge mental at certain times when it comes to my food (Hey! At least I admit it). The serpent is played by the staff members, each of them making the experience all the more tempting. The host was everything a host should be, but she really put in extra effort and we felt pampered. The waiter had his evil recommendations and he also made sure we were well taken care of!! Eve is Eve and Adam I is played by myself (duh). The ""apple"" is played by the following items...   Lobster Bisque- Very nice, full flavor, and not too heavy for a bisque. Field Greens- Whatever dressing is used should be bottled to drink. Lobster Deviled Eggs- They were all out but out waiter convinced them to make a few more for us. They were good but not ground breaking. Hand cut Fries- Just because they had it on the menu and I'm a fry fanatic, sampling fries when and where ever I can. Not sure how they did it but there was no grease, none. Sounds crazy I know. Excellent. Half Chicken- I will come out and say it. BEST half chicken in the whole city. It was perfectly, I mean perfectly cooked and seasoned. I understand it's just chicken, but here it's NOT!        If there is a battle of good and evil happening at Eve, I can easily tell you that EVIL wins!!! Eve made me clear those plates, not a crumb of food was left! Then I was kicked out. Of course not till I happily paid the bill. **Actually Eve is very affordable. Maybe it was the fancy decor that made me think it was $$$.  That right I just threw a Bible story at you. How do you like that?!?! For those who didn't understand Eve is very...

2010-12-13,3.0,"Two of my girlfriends and I went for champagne brunch at Eve on Sunday. I had just bought my wedding dress minutes before, and we were in a great mood and ready for some delish food and bubbly. We expressed our excitment to our waitress, who was definately not Ms. Personality. Anyway, I asked her what was included in the $22 brunch and she told us. So, my friends ordered mimosas and I asked for champagne. She asked if Prosecco was OK, or perhaps a rose sparkling wine. I chose the rose, which was very good. All of us had different items off the menu, and we all really enjoyed everything. The lobster eggs benedict and the mac & cheese were winners. When we got the bill, it was quite a bit more than the $22 brunch. We asked why, and he said it was b/c my rose wine was not part of the deal. I explained to him that the waitress didn't tell us that, and that we even speficially asked about what was included. He did adjust the bill, but seemed annoyed to do so and kept commented that the rose was more expensive, which I understood, but it seemed like he didn't get what we were saying - that the watiress should really have informed us that this wasn't part of the brunch special. So, in terms of food and ambience, I thought the place was great. It terms of customer service, both from the waitress and the host, not quite up to par.",0.9743,0.866,0.121,0.013,0.685378151260504

2010-11-30,4.0,"I was so looking forward to visiting Eve after hearing about it. I purchased a Groupon and as it was expiring, I figured I should check it out.  I visited on a Monday night - very slow night for restaurants in general - and also for Eve (the dining room did fill up a bit more around 7:30pm). I was there early. I'm ok with a relatively empty restaurant - though, I would have expected the service to be a bit quicker, considering...However, my companion said that maybe they wanted to keep us there longer to make the restaurant look busier...Who knows, I was happy anyway.  Let's start with the valet - oh, I mean, the non-existent valet. It was pouring rain, and I waited about 10 minutes...no valet. Finally, someone moved their car and I was able to park on the street (saved me some money anyway...). I thought to myself (while waiting) that the only other time that this has happened to me, I was at McCormick and Schmicks...surprisingly (or not), they share a valet. So, if you are in a hurry, take a cab...  We were seated promptly in a beautiful space. I loved the mirrors and the chandeliers were extremely unique. The chairs were comfortable and I sort of liked the white pleather tablecloths...our drinks were quick in arriving and I have to say, the vodka gimlet was made with fresh lime juice and was delicious. Wine is priced comparably with other spots (and the selection is unique and tasty).  I visited the restroom (see previous posts for my rating scale)...and I had to give the restroom a 2. It is gorgeous and clean, but for goodness sakes...if you run out of liquid hand soap, please don't water it down to make it last longer! Ok, I won't complain, some is better than none, and it did suds and smell good...maybe it's just very liquid-y.  The food was definitely a 5! Everything was divine! The bread to start was fantastic and the butter had truffle, Parmesan and garlic - YUM!  For dinner, I had the lobster pumpkin soup and the chantrelle flatbread (side of mac and cheese). Everything was so wonderful. I can't even describe the soup - but it was perfect.  My fellow diner had the cauliflower puree soup and the hanger steak (with homemade sauerkraut). This meal was also fully enjoyed and delicious. I am told that the soup was out of this world!  For dessert, we shared the pumpkin donuts with raspberry coulis as a filling. I think they were a tad overcooked (camouflaged with sugar), but SO wonderful! The portion size was huge (I took 2 home and wouldn't share).  Eve is definitely a spot for fine dining and I'd pick it for a nice date or special occasion as it is a bit pricey. However, the food is so fabulous - it's worth it!  p.s. they were super about the Groupon!",0.999,0.772,0.225,0.003,0.6477195204322864

The bread was really dry and the butter was so hard we couldn't spread it.  Then my entree came. I had the foie gras burger. To start the presentation was just ok. The burger itself was tasty but the piece of foie gras was so small it didn't add anything to the dish. the accompanying fries were very dry. We also shared the mac'n'cheese... Again, disappointing. It was pretty blend and we left most of it.  Finally, the bathroom was shabby and barely clean.

2010-11-25,2.0,"All about Eve, dear oh dear you took a lonely Thanksgiving and turned it into an experience less friendly than what  I would expect from the diner around the corner from my apartment.  Staring down the barrel of my first Thanksgiving alone in a new town - I carefully selected Eve on the basis on the Yelp reviews. The only available table was promptly at noon. Which was not,  of course, ideal. I was seated at a table on the periphery of the bar, an odd choice as there were tons of better open tables - which remained open during the duration of my meal. My server was pleasant (she never told me her name) but seemed distracted and when I asked for a wine recommendation she said she would get the somalier - who (even with an empty restaurant) declined to come to the table- so the waitress came back and pointed out two half bottles that the somalier apparently thought would be ""pretty good""  The meal began auspiciously with a delightful smoked trout / brussel sprout appetizer and a delicious pear cocktail. The wine and an elegant butternut squash bisque was dropped off soon after. I say dropped off because that's how the food was served, a random person would come by and without a word ""drop off"" the food. To say that the service was lack luster doesn't capture it - there was an air of total indifference. As though i was more or less taking up a seat and they were waiting for the REAL guests to come. I have had more competent, engaged service at McDonald's.  The Turkey portion was very small, but moist, however, there was very little gravy served with the stuffing and mashed potatoes, so the whole plate was dry , dry , dry. I won't even begin to describe the flaccid pumpkin mouseline , which looked like it had been lobbed out of its mold. Was coffee offered? nope. The entire meal, start to finish was less than one hour long. The cost $110. That's right people ONE HUNDRED TEN dollars. which granted featured an innovative appetizer and a really fabulous HALF bottle of wine.  To top it off as I stood waiting for my coat after paying a ridiculous amount for a dismal dining experience, front of house could not even muster a meager,  how was your meal?  Or even a smile.  Nope the two women continued in conversation as though I was not even standing there.   So sorry Eve - I really wanted to give you ONE star, but the appetizer saved your day -even if you ruined mine.

The pancetta (which looked suspiciously like bacon) was probably crispy at one time, but became limp, stringy and gross.

Friday (yes, Friday!) to Sunday you can get a brunch entree and BOTTOMLESS mimosas for $22 dollars (recently increased from $20). Food. And mimosas. Sans bottom. $22. Score! I've been here for brunch at least a half-dozen times, and I've tried a few different dishes. All in all there are probably 20 or so to choose from, divided between breakfast & lunch fare, slightly favoring the breakfast side. My favorites are the steak & eggs (Bulgogi Glazed Hangar Steak, Kim Chee, Scrambled Eggs) and the croque madame (Smoked Ham, Gruyere, Fried Egg, Maple Bechamel). Both are excellent! And of course, to wash all that delicious food down is an endless supply of mimosas. Remember, people who drink live longer. It's a proven fact. AND you're getting your daily dose of vitamin C! Really, you owe it to your body to partake. And now for the rest: the service is usually pretty good, though our waitress on my most recent visit was a bit inattentive. The interior is very nice, and the chairs are quite comfy. It can get a bit loud in there, but it's too bad.

Then, when our food came - big surprise - my omelet is covered in bacon.  The waitress did not even apologize, but just said 'imagine if I had let you make your own omelet' and then walked away.  With that comment, I had no faith that the kitchen could even make my eggs without poisoning me - so I canceled my order.  She then forgot to bring the rest of our tables food out.

2010-09-13,5.0,"I had brunch reservations here for 5 at 1pm on a Sunday. We arrived about 10 minutes early, sans one person in our group. The host snottily informed us that 1) the table wasn't ready and 2) our entire party needed to be here.  Things seemed to be going downhill, fast. As we stood outside, waiting, a patron came up to us and said to expect a long wait - she'd been waiting for her food for 45 minutes with her child, so she got up and left.  Cut to 20 minutes later when the host is suddenly ushering us in, and apologizing for the wait (our 5th person arrived 10 minutes after our reservation, causing the delay). We immediately ordered the bottomless mimosas and began mulling over the delectable menu. After our first round, our glasses were empty for a good 10 minutes. Again, I started doubting the Eve experience. Were we going to have to wait 45 minutes for food AND drinks? Our fantastic waiter Zachary came around with the pitcher, apologizing for the delay (the restaurant was packed), and from that moment on, my glass was never empty. We all tried something different (Lobster Benedict, Pork Belly Benedict, Shrimp and Grits, Sweet Corn Hash with Fried Oysters, and Chicken Confit Omelette). I had the omelette, and it's the only dish I wouldn't recommend. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the egg seemed overcooked. The chicken, peppers and goat cheese on the inside were delicious, though. I highly recommend both of the Benedicts.  It was about 3:15, and the restaurant had cleared out substantially (brunch ends at 3), when a woman (not sure if she was a hostess, manager, etc), came to our table with the last pitcher of mimosas and filled our glasses up. In the end, we did have to wait awhile for our food, but again, it was a packed restaurant, and not exactly Denny's, so maybe that earlier patron who left shouldn't have brought her kid. As long as you like mimosas, the time you have to wait for the food will fly, and you'll find yourself happily day-drunk.",0.9127,0.877,0.069,0.054,0.5528993055555556

I agree with one reviewer that this is one of those Chicago restaurants that is about 'seeing and being seen.'  On the whole, the food was good/slightly above par but not fantastic or to 'die for' on the tongue.   My biggest complaint is the menu is so small, and there weren't any specials on the night we went in to eat.  On top of this, the house was out of two or three dishes, which made selection severely limited.  I think when a place is that small and offers so few selections what is on the menu should ALWAYS be on the menu and ready to be served.   All in all: Might go back for the brunch that many here have bragged about (thanks Yelpers!  Reviews are so helpful.).  But probably won't go in again for dinner, at least not until I do more rounds at other Chicago restaurants. ;)",-0.5034,0.822,0.095,0.083,0.5226615646258503

The food was outstanding.  My mom ordered the corn chowder and I had the mixed greens to start.  The server let me sub goat cheese and walnuts on my salad instead of the blue cheese and pine nuts, and the sour cherry vinaigrette was delicious - I want to try to replicate that at home.  I tasted the soup and immediately regretted my salad, it was that good.  My mom had the trout and I had the salmon, but we were both a little disappointed that the menu posted online did not match the menu in the restaurant.  I also had two glasses of pinot grigio that were perfect on a hot and rainy day. We skipped dessert so that we had plenty of time to get to the theater in the pouring-down rain, but overall, it was a pleasant experience and the Groupon made it super cheap.

The five of us came here for brunch on Sunday, May 2nd to celebrate our friend's birthday with the highly anticipated $20 Bottomless Mimosas + entree brunch and, sad to say, we were all so disappointed.   With an 11 am reservation, we got seated right away as there were only a few occupied tables in the place. Placed our order by 11:10 a.m.........and then did not see our meals for nearly 45 mins!  What happened?  No clue, but after about 30 mins our server did come over, apologize and tell us they were having some problems in the kitchen. Good thing the Bottomless Mimosas were coming fast and furiously, Eve, because you nearly had an insurrection on your hands. I have found there are two types of former waiters - 1. the impatient,  never happy, whining, jump-thru-hoops-for-me kind, 2. and then there's me - the ""Shit, they forgot to put the lobster in my Benedict Lobster, but I don't want to be a bother"" kind of ex-waiter.  But on this day, when I did indeed discover the absent lobster, I sent it back because you know, after all? The Yelp reviews detailing how good this dish was is what brought me here. Was it  an off day for dear Eve? I don't know because from the looks of a number of reviews, I think they have a few things to figure out. - Benedict #2 Pork Belly, Crispy Tortilla, New Mexico Chili Hollandaise:  blah, tasteless pork with no hint of anything resembling New Mexico or even Old Mexico. - the Blueberry-Chocolate Pancakes - served with no butter and barely any syrup. - the Chipotle Buffalo Sausage that Yelpers rave about did not arrive at our table until we reminded the staff.  Tasty, spicy - but $6 for ONE sausage?  Shut up! - the Sweet Pea soup with ginger and whipped ricotta arrived after our entrees. This was scrumptious just too bad it was served at the wrong time for me to fully enjoy it. - the roasted potatoes served with all egg brunch items were good, but cold. - the Benedict Lobster w/Prosciutto & Pesto Hollandaise - sigh. Just made me sad. I was SO looking forward to this dish but it was a complete miss. Even after I sent it back to retrieve said lobster, I got it back with about a tsp of the most finely chopped lobster bits you have ever seen. Hell, I couldn't even tell if it WAS lobster.  Boo. Things that somewhat saved the day: - the fabulous tasting mimosas. - the pleasant staff repeatedly filled our coffees, mimosas, waters while we waited 45 mins for our food. - the fact that our waiter did not charge us for a number of items on our bill. We did not ask him to do this - I think he simply realized we had been through the mill. Kudos to him for easing our pain.",0.913,0.771,0.124,0.105,0.5652507654946679

Yeah, I said it.  - The lobster, proscuitto and pesto hollandaise was one of the best Benedicts ever. The lobster portion was substantial and the taste wasn't killed by the other ingredients.  - The mimosas were free flowing. I had at least 8-10.  - Service was on. We never waited more than a minute or so with an empty glass. Usually they came back to refill before we were even done. My husband went with pear, which required the server to make each one individually and he always brought one without asking. We stayed for about two hours and never felt pressure to leave.  - The space is swanky and lively, but still intimate.  $20 for enough mimosas to get me beyond buzzed on a Sunday afternoon, plus delicious food and excellent service.

There were 2 chunks of pineapple in my bowl...

It honestly was so sweet & so thick with crunchy little veggies throughout. The risotto came next, which was topped with a celery salad. Alright, it smelled good...so excited...omg, what in the world? Again, it was so rich & so truffley (which again I love) that I couldn't take more than a few bites.

But the hostess was a sweetheart and led us straight to our table. The decor is nice- clean and modern- and i really liked the white leather tablecloths and pretty chandeliers. And our waiter showed up immediately after to get us started with drinks. So we're off to a decent start. The wine was very nice (malbec) and our waiter was very enthusiastic about us being there for restaurant week. He took our order all at once- fine by me. Then he disapeared. Again, fine by me. I don't need hovering. But the only time i saw him after that was when he stopped by to see if we needed more wine- we didn't, our glasses were still half full. He didn't even stop by to see if we wanted coffee with our desserts. On to the food- it was... okay but not at all memorable. My guy got the Maine Lobster Bisque for an app and it was good but really just a a few spoonfuls of pureed soup in an oversized bowl. (Is anyone else tired of this set up?) I had a shrimp app that was tasty and fresh but the shrimp were TEENY and there were only 4 of them. We both chose the short ribs with bok choy for the entree. My first bite i was so happy. It was delicious. But with every bite after that it dawned on me more and more why i liked it so much at first. It was pure fat and I mean squishy greasy and all that. I know short ribs tend to be fatty but there was no other flavor to it. In the end i couldn't eat the meat any more and just wolfed down the bok choy with some sauce to fill me up.  The desserts were good. I had a chocolate peanut butter pot de creme and my date had the apple crisp (so yum- wish i had ordered it instead). I really liked mine but it was incredibly rich and very sweet so after a few bites i really couldn't eat any more. The presentation was nice though- it included a peice of peanut brittle and a couple of chocolate straws- very pretty. In the interest of full disclosure, i wonder if i was so underwhelmed by this place because of the food or because of the INCREDIBLY loud woman sitting at the next table. It felt like she was shouting in my ear the entire meal to the point where i kept having to ask my guy ""huh?What did you say?""

Umm... okay? -It's restaurant week right now, so it's 3 courses/$32, but they normally have a 3 course/$29 prix fixe with different selection. When i called last night & asked if they would have the $29 option tonight, the man on the phone said that they would. But today, our waiter very rudely told us that they didn't, and he couldn't offer an explanation for why I was told differently on the phone. Oh yeah, that reminds me... The hostess was pretty unfriendly too. She left us standing at the entrance for 5 minutes, even though the restaurant was half empty.   -My $28 scallop dish pretty much contained 4 medium-sized scallops and some onions. And they somehow made the onions taste weird. I finished all the slightly stale bread that we were served. (But the scallops tasted fine) -My friend got the hangar steak (which he thought was not tender or juicy) & didn't think the sauerkraut served with it went together well at all. Yeah, looking at those two foods now.. I don't think they do either. -The decor here is nice.. but then again, most restaurants do look nice. Actually, it was too dark. I couldn't tell what I was eating. But maybe it's better that way... they can have a star for that.

The brunch menu is the perfect blend of old standards with slightly new twists. My guests included discriminating ""foodies"" and all were happy. The bottomless mimosas were a definite crowd-pleaser!  Sherman and April took care of us and they were 110% in professionalism and making sure our needs were met.   I have since had guests email me about how much they liked Eve.

I will probably be back for brunch since the food was pretty tasty and I like the atmosphere.  Steak and eggs were great with kimchi, and the omelette I ordered had a generous portion of yummy duck confit. We came for brunch with a party of 5 (= automatically include 18% gratuity...).  We ordered and got to see the party of 3 beside us sit down and finish their meals before our food even arrived.  Ok, I guess our 5 plates maybe were harder to manage for the kitchen.  Then when our food did finally arrive about 40 minutes after we ordered: 1. The potatoes were very skimpy - ok ok, this ain't the cracker barrel.  The meal was enough anyway, but it did make me wonder if potatoes had become a luxury commodity over the weekend. 2. The bacon was crispier than my grandfather ordered - alright, ""not too crispy"" is totally subjective and maybe they really tried the first time around.  The waitress brought him another side of bacon to make up for it, which was nice of her (way to earn that 18%!). 3. The eggs my grandfather ordered were not over-easy, they were sunny-side up - no big deal, just send them back right?  We tried that with the guy who brought our food - he immediately apologized and left with it.  Then he returned it a minute later, insisted that ""this is how we do over-easy,"" and hustled off.  We were all a little shocked. To me, over-easy means that the eggs have to be cooked on BOTH sides (the over part of over-easy).  Did that change over the weekend too? Luckily, grandpa wasn't cranky and we all laughed it off.  I mean, a self-righteous and inept kitchen staff is kinda cute sometimes, right? Anyway, I think I'll come back when we can get sloshed on the bottomless mimosas without risking grandpa's disapproval.  My advice: don't come with a group of 5 or more and get the mimosas.  When you're on free booze time, I bet this place rules.",0.9913,0.842,0.143,0.015,0.4875640040962622

A slightly gummy butternut squash ravioli (boring) and utterly divine (finally... jackpot) rack of lamb with creamy ricotta dumplings and fabulously crispy garlic rounded out the rest of my culinary sampling. When the dessert menu came and went without a glance I knew Eve was in a bit of trouble... I was mentally checked out and ready for a Berry Chill. Eeep!

2009-10-03,3.0,"I'm a fan of the chef's previous restaurant, Tallulah, and I looked forward to trying Eve.  My son and I ate at Eve on Thursday Oct 1, around 7pm.  Eve was not crowded; service was attentive and friendly.  There are items on Eve's menu that were on Tallulah's, but the best, most addictive item on Tallulah's menu -- the bulgogi pork belly -- was not at Eve.  Why would a chef not offer his piece-de-resistance?  That's a recipe for disappointing customers.  As to what we did order, the oyster & waffle appetizer featured plump, juicy fried oysters.  The waffles with white sauce that came with the oysters were nothing special but as long as you paired each bite of waffle with a some of the oyster then the waffles and sauce were okay.  The waffles were supposed to have tasso ham in them, but if they did include ham it was such a small amount that less than 48 hours later I don't recall any ham.  The oyster appetizer size is generous but the oysters are good enough that I wanted more (not more waffle, just more oysters).  I would have loved to have those plump fried oysters stuffed into and overflowing from an oyster po'boy.    We also had a whitefish appetizer that was like a crabcake made from whitefish sitting on a something like a mango-tomato-onion salsa.  It was good if a little bland, but I thought it was undersized (I mean whitefish is cheap compared to crab, right?  So make the whitefish cake a lot bigger than you'd make a crabcake!)  The whitefish cake looked especially tiny on the large plate on which it came.   We had a side of fries.  They were an excellent rendition of the thin cut fries you might get with steak frites.   And we tried the homemade sorbet.  Three flavors:  lemon-basil, raspberry tabasco, and passionfruit something.  I didn't taste basil in the lemon, but the lemon was flavorful and tangy, the best of the 3 flavors.  The raspberry was disappointing.  I got neither a bursting berry taste nor any bite from the Tabasco.  Maybe the flavors were balancing each other, but if so I would describe it more as cancelling each other out where the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  Unlike the raspberry-Tabasco from which I expected a sharp note but didn't get one, I didn't expect the passionfruit to have a sharp taste but it did.  I couldn't decide if the Tabasco was somehow showing up in the passionfruit instead of the raspberry or if the passionfruit was just so sweet that it tasted sharp.  The passionfruit tasted good in small doses to me anyway, but it was too much for my son.   It's natural to compare Eve with Tallulah, and on that score Eve comes up short.  The desserts I enjoyed at Tallulah -- a chile chocolate mousse and a berry crumble with ice cream -- were both better than Eve's sorbet.  The bulgogi pork belly at Tallulah blows away either of the appetizers we had at Eve even though I recommend Eve's oysters.  And although the decor at Eve is harmonious, I prefer the glass-enclosed garden seating area at Tallulah.  I wrote a detailed review of Tallulah a few months ago but now it no longer shows up in Yelp.  Can anyone tell me why that might be?  Having benefited from reviews written by others, I decided I should return the favor by writing some reviews myself and making those reviews detailed enough to be helpful and informative rather than just saying ""it's great"" or ""it's bad"".  It's discouraging to take the time to write  a detailed and informative review only to see it disappear in a few months.",0.9968,0.828,0.133,0.039,0.5320535714285713

2009-07-29,4.0,"Eve - gorgeous decor, impeccable service, and overall delightful experience. A girlfriend and I went here for dinner and ordered the following: Slow Roasted Suckling Pig as an appetizer - perfect, simple tastes done right! As a salad we both split the Baby Spinach Salad White Asparagus, Poached Egg, Almonds, Buttermilk Parmesan Dressing which was DELICIOUS! The wait staff split the dish for us without any remark or snootiness (always a plus!). We ordered a bottle of Gascon (Malbec) which is one of my favorites - the price point was reasonable at $34, which I was happy to see. As an entree I ordered Seared Day Boat Scallops Grilled Peach and Green Bean Salad, Crispy Pancetta, Arugula Pistou - YUM-MY! The scallops could have been a tad bit warmer, but the consistency and tastes were perfection. My friend ordered the fish special which was equally enjoyable. For desert we had the sorbet trio which was served in a martini glass - was not a fan of the thai mango spice sorbet (literally, spicy and sweet, but did not complement the other two sorbets, in my opinion).  Great for an ""occasion"" meal (birthdays, anniversaries etc) - ambiance is perfect for relaxed conversation and the wait staff is well trained and observant.",0.9948,0.754,0.236,0.01,0.5944642857142857

Went last Saturday night with a party of 6 for a 21st Birthday Party Dinner.  First of all, the place is beautiful.   Swanky.   Chic.    Gorgeous.   Compact. First impressions:  Good! We all sit down and wait for service.  Awhile.   A waitress comes by and asks for drinks.  We order wine.   Another waitress comes and tells us they are going to switch waitresses on us.  We knew something was up because no one came back for quite awhile.  Whoops,  They don't have the wine we ordered.  Order another.  More time.  It finally arrives. We order.  Whoops.  One of the specials is gone.  At 8:30???? We ordered a variety of appetizers.  I can honestly say that the tuna tartare was the only one that was really good.  Oysters--lots of waffes, not a lot of oysters.  Lobster sausage--bland.  Salad--bland, not a lot going on.  Can't even remember what else--too boring.  Salad was served with the bacon the customer asked to leave off. Now the entrees:   The risotto was  truly the worst I have ever had at a restaurant.  What you say?  It couldn't be that bad.   YES.   Now I will say I tried to figure out what the chef was thinking.  It was a green garlic risotto with roasted grape tomatoes (3 or 4) and mushrooms (2 pieces).  Maybe he was hoping the green garlic would flavor it, maybe he(she) thought that he wanted the springy flavor.  There was no cheese in the dish.  Two of us ordered it and we both made eye contact--YUCK.   I said to her that I needed some salt.  She said, thank god you said that.  So we got some salt and pepper--still didn't eat the whole thing.   The Halibut was OK.  The salmon special looked beautiful, but wasn't anything special.  The beef was OK, nothing special.  Now for the scallops.  I will admit--that dish looked beautiful.   4 big, beautiful, plump scallops on a long plate with some green sauce.   My friend tried one and said--These are so salty!   I said- Wow, you got my salt!   I asked to taste it because she is very sensitive to salt and thought it was just her.  They WERE very salty.  Even too salty for me.  No sweetness, just salt.   Maybe the regular chef was sick? One of us mentioned to the waitress that it was an important birthday and asked for a little something with a candle at the end of the dinner.   Oh, and by the way, they forgot the little birthday candle dessert. I can't see spending money for this meal. I can't see spending 18% for that service.

The decor is nice but it was just a tad bit too dark in there to really see what you are eating.  We had three apps that tasted pretty good: suckling pig, spicy glazed prawns, and the lobster sausage. The lobster bisque was pretty poorly done. It was too creamy to the point where the dairy taste overpowered all other flavor. The scallops and duck entrees were great, so no complaints there.But the creme brulee was pretty poorly done...maybe it was already 11pm by the time we were finished, but the desert was still cold when it was served to us.  Other comments are dinner time took wayyyy too long and we had a poor excuse for why it took so long despite the restaurant being not that busy.

Everyone had a first course - the oysters, pea/carrot soup and lobster sausage were hits.  The strawberry glazed prawns, the suckling pig and the lobster bisque were meh.  I didn't try the lobster bisque, but I've never seen lobster bisque so dark.  It was weird. On to the mains - the duck, lamb and tenderloin with crab sauce were hits.  Two of us took the waitress up on her offer to have the halibut with the accoutrements from the scallop dish - the result was OK (the fish was overcooked and there wasn't much flavor in the fava beans or morel vinaigrette). We split two desserts.  The s'mores was amazing, the chocolate cherry bread pudding was only OK.

2009-05-07,3.0,"This new addition to the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chi-town is trying really hard. They are advertising, co-branding, and pushing for some excellent media reviews.  Now for the real story.   The restaurant is very chic - white leather chairs and banquets (during my visit, a nearby table guest knocked over a glass of red wine - you should have seen the staff run around with towels, napkins, special potions...it was a bit funny.  Mental note - no white leather dining room furniture!). Tall ceilings, and a cute little bar in the back. Bad feng shui as a friend pointed out - your back is to the front door.  ...and in Chicago?? The dining room is compact, which means you could listen to a great conversation...at another table...if you so desire.  However, it is surprisingly quiet and the lights are low.  The space is impressive.  Now the food...hmmm.   Appetizer - Lobster sausage.  Just the name excited me - combining two of my favorite things...ah but two rights don't make it tasty... The lobster had NO taste, and it all just fell out of the casing when cut into. A couple ingredients could have been added to solve both the flavor and the binding issue. I wouldn't serve this in my home without fixing those.   Entree: I was suggested the duck over the foie gras burger. Since I wasn't famished, our servestress suggested this option. (I love giving the server the opportunity to steer me in the right direction.)  It came sliced and a bit on the rare side.  I wasn't asked a temperature, so they took a guess.  I personally don't like rare duck - I feel it has no flavor, and can be chewy.  They warmly sent it back to be fired a bit more, and it came back just fine.  Just not real exciting.  The duck confit spring roll was a bit too mushy and salty - good attempt, bad execution - also, no dipping sauce to perk it up any.   The sauce for the duck slices was drawn around the plate in a trail, which was almost invisible - a white sauce on a white plate...not very well thought out.  Also, this light sauce did not compliment a hearty meat.   They had a decent eclectic wine list, and the martini was served perfectly - complete with tiny ice chips, for those who like this trend.   Based on what they did well, I believe I will go back and visit the bar next time...with my eye in the mirror to the front door.",0.9557,0.776,0.135,0.09,0.45159140102321926
2009-05-04,5.0,"Décor: Elegant neutral colors with gorgeous chandeliers, and rich textures. Staff: Server was excellent. Attentive without being over bearing. Funny and very personable. The server assistants were cheerful, polite, and attentive.  Food:  Appetizer: Abalone, spinach and mushroom pierogies with gorgonzola cream. Just left of perfect. The pierogie dough was a bit too much and it overwhelmed the filling and the delicate sauce. However if you cut off the thick doughy seam you could really experience the taste of both the filling and the sauce which were divine. Entrees: Rack of Lamb - A tear is welling in my eye when I think of this dish. This is by far the best lamb chop I have ever experienced in my life. I like my meat rare, and the chef did perfectly seared, perfectly rare lamb chops. Tender and butter like. They melted in my mouth. They had a gorgeous perfectly spiced crust running around them. Served over a lamb ragout with nice pieces of stewed lamb that were tender and falling apart which was a nice contrast to the rare chops. Ricotta dumplings were firm and mildly flavored. The Swiss Chard was tender, and sweet. When I die, I want this to be my last meal. I ate every last piece I could scoop up onto my fork. Pork Chop: Again perfectly seasoned seared crust around the sliced pieces of boneless pork chop. The mushroom gravey was so good. The asparagus were bright, fresh and stood up to the rest of the dish without getting lost. Theys still had that fresh snap to them. The biscuit had a nice thyme perfumed quality to it. Dessert: Pound Cake with Strawberry Rubarb compote and Black Pepper Ice Cream -  Again a tear is welling up. This place also has the best pound cake I have ever had. I don't know how they did it. The cake had this beautiful golden brown, buttery, sweet and rich crust that enveloped the crumbly soft inside. The Black Pepper ice cream was the best accompaniment to the cake I can think of. Cheese Platter: Excellent selection of cheeses with fruit and crackers. The Gorgonzola Dulce is breathtaking. Beverages: Prosecco - it was our anniversary dinner so I had to celebrate with this frizante Italian wine. A generous serving that came in a unique glass, it resembled a single stem vase, it was a unique touch that I liked. They also have a nice Malbec. Parking: If you can't find it on the street they have valet service for $12.00. We would with out a doubt return to this restaurant. We were so supremely satisfied with EVERY aspect of this establishment. The prices were a bit on the higher end side but we felt no trepidation in the price of our bill, it was worth every penny.

Walleye was delicious, but it was served with undercooked peas. The halibut was simply unfit for consumption. Perhaps the worst fish I've ever tasted.

In other words, not wonderful enough to love it, but not horrible enough to dislike it... just in the middle... which for me, really isn't a good thing.  Granted, we dined late evening (about 9:00 pm) on a crappy weather weeknight (I believe it was a Wednesday)... so, the dining room was empty short of one other table of women who were finishing up for the evening... thus, no real atmosphere.

2008-12-02,4.0,"Tallulah has a new sis in town and her name is Eve! On a Monday EVEning (sorry, couldn't help myself there) I enjoyed a lovely meal at this gold coast restaurant with 2 of my favorite Yelp peeps, Colleen C and Michelle B (visiting from Seattle).   While I was expecting Eve to share similarities to Tallulah I found these 2 sisters to be very different.  While Tallulah is more laid back Eve screams sophistication and elegance.  I couldn't help, but admire what they had done with the old Flapjaws space. I especially loved those gorgeous chandeliers. Where can I get one of those for my condo?? One thing Eve does have in common with Tallulah is good food! EVErything was jush delish! I convinced Colleen to split the mussels with me. These were a bit sweeter (in a good way) and different (also in a good way) than other mussels I've had. They were topped with grapes and radishes, which I found to be a very nice touch.  Michelle, not being much of a shellfish gal, ordered a salad to start- a nice sized portion and she seemed to like it! As for our main meal I had trouble deciding between the monkfish, scallops, and ahi tuna.  Lucky for me my dining companions have fabulous taste.  While I ordered the monkfish (thanks to Carol K's for the recommendation), Michelle feasted on the scallops and Colleen placed an order for the tuna.  Both were nice enough to give me a taste and it was all so good! The scallops were a tad bit salty for my taste, but I'd have a hard time deciding between the monkfish and tuna next time because both were quite tasty. No dessert for us last night, but there were a few on the dessert menu that looked quite tempting. Ahem cheese plate...you will be mine next time.",0.995,0.758,0.194,0.048,0.5495316804407714
2008-11-21,4.0,"From the owners of Tallulah comes their latest creation, Eve.  The space is stunning. Hard to believe that this is the old Flapjaws.   Eve has two large rooms, each decorated with dark gray walls, moldings and faceted framed mirrors (so cool I had to go over to see how it was done) to make the space look larger. The chandeliers are lovely with clusters of glass ""petals"" on globes. The cream colored leather chairs with dark accents say elegant the second you come through the revolving door.  Now on to the real star- the food. We went with all of our server's suggestions and sampled a variety of items. We started with raw oysters which were served already topped with chopped apple bits and herbs. The lobster sausage was another good choice unique in the simplicity that is was like a sausage casing stuffed with lobster. Delicious!  We then moved on to the Peeky Toe salad over endive (so good) and the duck salad. My duck salad was the only misstep for me as while the duck and the cheese was good- there was not enough of the cider vinaigrette dressing the watercress to make it tasty. The server noted that I didn't eat each much of it and actually took it off the bill which was totally unexpected but appreciated.  As for entrees- we had the scallops, which were delicious and the monkfish (poor man's lobster as described by our server). Let me go on record that if that is what a poor man eats then he is a lucky man!  The prices were reasonable for this area. With drinks, champagne and all our food (sans the duck salad) it came to just under $200 for two. Valet parking runs $12.  The only challenge that Eve may have is that they have used every square inch of space to maximize tables. When more than two people show up at the same time- there is little space between the front door and the tables for people to congregate. We were all sort of standing single file in the entry way waiting to check our coats and the same on the way out waiting for our car.  Eve is a great addition to this rather barren stretch of Wabash. It's got style, the food is very good and the servers go out of their way to make your experience memorable. Now what could be better than that?",0.9911,0.874,0.113,0.012,0.5839848901098901
2008-11-06,5.0,"Tonite i enjoyed dinner at this very new Gold Coast restaurant - opened only 7 months after Tallulah in Lincoln Square by Troy Graves of Meritage fame.  This was their second night of service. The waitstaff is very attentive, the menu characteristically unusual and varied to a very acceptable degree, and the decor is stunning with the white leather, mirror-faceted wall and subtle bar in the back.  true to his past offerings, the chef provides unique pairings .. yes, the lobster sausage app is very tasty but the lemon cake with basil puree is a hands-down pleaser .. the char, pheasant and scallops were wonderful.  the wine list is impressive and the generosity of our waiter in satisfying both our curiosity and tastes is admirable. we will return!",0.9887,0.735,0.255,0.011,0.6272727272727273
2008-10-28,5.0,"While I was a huge fan of Flapjaws (RIP), this restaurant has something poor old Flappy's couldn't offer, truly good food at a truly good price. It just opened yesterday for lunch and opens on Nov. 5 for dinner (which I will also be attending) and it was great!  The wait staff was very attentive and the owner came over twice to ask my friend and me what we thought of the place and the food. I had the most amazing Crab BLT (crab salad with pancetta) with garlic polenta and my friend had a chicken sandwich with blue cheese and a salad.  Both were absolutely delicious!   If you just go for the food, it's very reasonable, the plates range in price from about $9-17, but with the addition of wine or a drink, it gets a little pricey.   Finally, the decor is fantastic!  It seems like they made this tiny little place a LOT bigger than Flapjaws was, they really did a great job with the bar, it saves a lot of space and there are a LOT of mirrors so it makes it look huge.  One area looks like Versailles with lots of cool molding and mirrors and the lighting is breathtaking!   I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch and will report back after I've tried their dinner!",0.9906,0.769,0.194,0.037,0.6469230769230769
