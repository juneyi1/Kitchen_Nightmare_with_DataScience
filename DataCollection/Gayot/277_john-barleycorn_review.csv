I spent most of my time on the second floor which was so fun! It's like a cool club inside a sports bar, something you would not expect! Drinks were good and prices were decent for Wrigleyville. I will definitely visit JB the next time I am in Wrigleyville.

This year I bought 2 tickets in advanced for New Year's Eve totaling to $160. I showed up at 9:30pm expecting to be let in right away. That was not the case. I wasn't let in until 11pm. 2 hours that costed me $80. When I was let in they didn't scan mine nor my boyfriends ticket, they just looked at it. So to say they were at capacity is totally false and not to mention a safety hazard. Not only did they waste 2 hours and $80 of my money, I wasn't served any food. The buffet was empty and nothing but trays filled hot water were on the tables. At that point I was in shock so I asked if they were going to be serving more food. I was told no and I could look upstairs. So I went upstairs to be disappointed yet again. Come midnight I was expecting a champagne toast and confetti but was let down and all we got was a lousy 45 second countdown. At 1:15am the lights were turning on and they were kicking everyone out.

A few minutes later, another plate of wings came across the bar next to us, to people who also sat down AFTER us.  By this time we were in the process of paying our bill. We had asked the bartender to split the bill down the middle. She took both our cards and after being gone for 5 minutes we were looking around for her. She was still at the computer, and ended up having another employee and a manager helping her. After 20 minutes we were getting concerned that they'd had our cards all this time.  Finally she came back and explained they had trouble splitting the bill and explained a rather screwed up receipt to us. She did say if there were any problems with the billing to our accounts, to call them tomorrow (Saturday). When we checked our credit card statements, we had both been double-billed for the split total. I've never run across a restaurant that couldn't split a bill.  Of course when I called Saturday, at about noon, the phone was picked up by voicemail so I left a message.

2016-04-25,2.0,"Let me first just say, you have some major potential here. You're a great looking bar, with a wide open space, and there's literally not any spot inside that comes without a quality view of a high definition tv screen. All that, and you've also got giant garage door style windows out front for summer wandering patrons looking for a cool breeze to accompany their Wrigleyville bar hop. You're the kind of sports-party hybrid spot that brings out our wild weekend YOLO desires, but with the atmosphere fit for both the finely suited night owl and denim-decked sweaty sports nut to ""bro-out"" over the last second winning play. For those reasons JB-Wrigley, I truly believe you can be whatever your little heart desires.  But alas, 5 star (or even a measly 3 star) reviews are not given out on potential alone, my friend. They are given at the crossroads where potential meets execution, and high customer satisfaction is all but guaranteed.  JB-Wrigley, you are not at this crossroads. And let us look no further than your attempt to execute a very common and industry standard appetizer: Classic Nachos. As the menu dictates, this dish includes what most might expect from any standard nacho dish: ""Tortilla chips, Chicago-style chili, Cheddar cheese, jalapenos, salsa, sour cream."" And before I continue, allow me to preface this criticism with the fact that I did opt to order Classic Nachos without the menu-famed ""Chicago-Style chili."" And with that, I must maintain that perhaps this meaty ingredient is so critical to the success and execution of what I thought was a softball of a choice - a simple and easy win for hungry clientele - that without it, the dish falls apart, flat on its face, into something more along the lines of a ""convenience store purchased, freshman-year-college crafted and microwaved"" debacle; something more fit for a stoner on 4/20 looking to end what feels like a month long hunger strike with any caloric crumb that may fall his/her way. I suppose that IS possible.  And if that is the case, allow me to apologize JB-Wrigley. I never wanted it to be this way. But what you did to me was just plain sad. I'm not upset about the stale grocery-store-sourced bag of chips from which this dish clearly started. I'm not upset about the tasteless four cheese Mexican-style blend you melted on the top in 30 seconds on high power. I'm not even upset about the canned tomatoes and pickled jalapeno pieces that were so scarcely topped for flair.  I'm just disappointed in you, for all the potential that you have failed to live up to. I mean, c'mon JB-Wrigley! If you're gunna do me like this, the least you could do is be honest with yourself and serve this microwaved mess with a bottle of Sriracha and a Natty Lite, so I can lower my expectations accordingly. Otherwise, you'll just continue to set our bar-clientele relationship up for future failure. And I cannot live with this sort of letdown, JB-Wrigley. I need commitment for us to thrive, and I ain't listening to the same old ""is it too late now to say sorry"" story any longer! It's gotta be all or nothing, JB-Wrigley! Show me a kitchen committed to proper (or even average, maybe C+) nachos, or let me be free of the dream I have in store for us! Take a good look in the mirror, JB-Wrigley, because I believe in you. I know what you can truly be in this life. Just put down that blunt of hydro for an afternoon, and try to focus on making baby steps towards a better, nacho-loving you. We're in this fight together, JB-Wrigley, and I can't wait for the awe-inspiring, grandiose nacho platter offspring that will surely come from our union.

2016-04-10,5.0,"5 stars so this review gets shown. This place is complete trash, along with its staff. Wrigley Chicago Bar takes it a notch further to represent the city by hiring the most ""animalistic"" bouncers from the street just to add a little extra disrespectful trashy touch to a business ran in Chicago. Was at this place last night April 9th a Saturday.... Where my brother paid the African American bouncer 40$ to let our group skip the long line to go upstairs, as he was letting us up he cut half of our group off and told us to get in the back of the line. First off, as a bouncer if you want to do your job the honest way, you aren't going to take bribes to let people skip lines and IF you are going to do so, then you do not cut half the group off to cause a scene and possibly get yourself in trouble? After being told we can't come upstairs with my brother and half of our group, I started yelling at him telling him that was wrong and that they just cut half of our group off... So since you can't speak to a bouncer like he's a normal human being with out getting kicked out, my friend warned me you are going to get kicked out for speaking up... So I hurried, finished my drink so I could walk out on my own without having to deal with being told to leave from someone who has no authority. Before I could walk to the door the bouncer was in my face and pushed me, for what reason? Well outside of this bar hiring ghetto trash.. I can't think elsewhere. He pushes me, well I did nothing for him to get violent so now I'm standing up for myself, I push him back, he starts to punch me, I swing, and before I know it, I have now 3 African American bouncers all punching me in the head after I chose to just stop reacting all I could do at the time was cover my head to prevent any extreme damage... Six fists on one 21 year old guy who is absolutely harmless. In my eyes, this was a dramatic racially charged encounter... Our chance to jump the white boy because we have the upper hand.

Overpriced drinks, poor service, and the desire for the DJ's to put on their best Skrillex impression 24/7.  I stopped by on a St. Patrick's Day bar crawl with admittedly low expectations. After standing at the bar for 15 minutes while 14 women were served before me by the bartender who clearly suffered from little man's syndrome, I was finally granted the right to buy beer. The bartender proceeded to crack a can of 312 and pour the beer as if it were water coming down Niagara Falls. As soon as the beer hit the bottom of the plastic cup, an explosion of foam overwhelmed the container walls. You would think the age old expression ""practice makes perfect"" would apply here, but apparently the bartender must have been practicing pouring beers wrong his entire life. 4 tries later, with an expression on his face that screamed ""wow I suck at my job,"" the bartender jokingly handed me my beers and asked for a form of payment. I handed him my credit card out of desperation because I couldn't stand being in his presence any longer and simply wanted to drink away the sadness from dealing with such ineptitude. Scratching a ""0"" onto the tip line, I walked away unsure who actually came out as the winner in this situation. THE ONLY REASON I decided to give Barleycorn 2 stars is because of the breakfast buffet they had upstairs. Although there were a few hundred drunk souls dancing away to a Calvin Harris remix whilst spilling green Bud Light all over the place, there was not a soul around to consume the endless amounts of home fries, powdered eggs, and sausage links provided to them all. I immediately hopped on this opportunity and heaped massive portions of the three onto a paper plate.

The staff is an eclectic mix of fresh, new faces who love the industry and will go out of their way to help you and burnt out old souls who've had the life sucked out of them by bros tipping 4% on the round of ""super masculine"" vegas bombs they just ordered.  As such, it really wouldn't be the most fair thing to demerit this place too much for having an absolutely exhausted staff.  I can honestly say that if I worked there, I'd set the over/under at 7 days before I started lighting everything on fire (I'd go with the under, after observing the number of guys who tried to get extra alcohol in their drinks by winking at the female bar staff). As far as food goes, this place is OK.  I mean, if you're going to John Barleycorn for an exquisite fine dining experience, you're an idiot and probably go to Taco Bell when you're craving authentic Mexican food.  The place serves its purpose; Good drunk food at reasonable prices.   The upstairs  seconds as a psuedo-nightclub, which is fun if you're imbibed enough.  However, my biggest gripe is with the DJ.  I've been there on game days where the concept is ""game sound during play and DJ set during commercials"" which is fun, but half the time the DJ seemed insulted when game play resumed.  It's like, ""bro, I get it, this is an awesome remix of Rihanna that you found on Spotify but I'm trying to listen to some Cubbies commentary.""  They also have bottle service upstairs, but it's a much more casual-yet-balls-to-the-wall feel than downtown, if you're into that.   Long story short, if you regularly go out in Wrigley, you'll end up here, and you'll have fun as long as you're not an asshole who expects River North style service in a bar where the average patron's BAC is the same as their age.",0.9826,0.834,0.131,0.035,0.5012771950271949

Your food, I must say, is good. We frequent all your establishments such as Old Crow for your ribs, Moe's for you steak taquizas and John Barleycorn for your great burgers. I am complementing your establishments as well as your staff, as there are other choices I can make for the same entertainment, comparable food and beverages such as Deuces, Mullins and Red Ivy.   Although on a Thursday, August 20th, my guests and I were in WrigleyVille and came across a disturbing, disrespectful, and unacceptable incident which involved your doorman at Moe's Cantina. I later inquired about his identity and his name was Brian. He is about 6ft tall, Caucasian and has a full beard. As my guests and I were approaching, there was a group of four people whom entered prior to us without being carded. (Which is not my complaint because the individuals all looked well over 21.) My three guests entered before me also not being carded. But as I walked by, he rudely tapped me on my arm and asked me for my ID, which I have no problem presenting. I jokingly told him if he was ""kidding"" because I am 47 years old. His response to me in front of my guests was ""you don't have to act like an asshole.""   I personally feel this is unacceptable and intolerable and some kind of disciplinary action must take place, such as removing him from front door duties, suspension or even termination. These individuals must understand that they are the first impression of your establishments. This kind of behavior such as the above incident only ends in negative results. If in the near future my guests and I arrive at any of your venues and this individual is there, we will refuse to enter and give you our business.

While they made everyone wait downstairs before the game started without giving reason (even though we eventually found out it was because the upstairs had flooded) or an estimated time they'd start letting people up, I noticed that the DirecTV kept going in and out due to the storm. I asked one of the guys who worked there if they had cable setup in case the satellite didn't improve, and he said - very jerk-like - the satellites wouldn't go down. I said they were clearly going down every few minutess, and just wanted to know if there was a backup plan. He basically told me to piss off.  Meanwhile, the hostess told us we could have a reserved table if the people who made the reservation didn't come in by 5 min after their reservation time. We abandoned our place in line to go upstairs for better standing room/table possibilities to sit at an empty, reserved table for the next hour. After 5 min post-reservation time, we asked if it was ours, and she said no we had to wait 15-20 min after reservation time. So we continued to wait. 20 min after reservation time (game was now well into the first period), she said 4 more minutes. Finally, 4 min later a friend asked if it was ours and she just gave her a mean look and slightly nodded her head. My friend then asked to confirm if we should take the reservation sign off, and the hostess just looked at her with a mean look and then turned away. Now with a table, a waitress walked by and I asked if we could order some food and beers. She said she wasn't our server, and when I asked if she knew who was, she just looked at me for a second, shrugged, and walked away. We never saw ""our server"" the entire night. I understand it was packed, but to not see a waiter/waitress for 3 solid hours is pretty crazy. Finally, after opening a tab at the bar, and then waiting the entire third period to get the bartenders attention to close my tab (in her defense it was packed, but she seemed to continually skip over me in going from side to side serving people), my girlfriend finally got the attention of a male bartender, who then lost closed my tab but lost my card on his way back with my bill. 5 min later he found it on the nasty floor and handed it over. At this point the Hawks had won and we had missed valuable final moments in the game and celebration. Neither my friends nor I did anything rude or otherwise deserving of such treatment, and I can assure anyone who cares for my opinion that I will go to great lengths from now on to never have to go to JBC Wrigley.

First of all, it's pretty clear that the neglectful owner allows or possibly encourages the bouncers to run the show. From the 2 hour wait in line (which makes no sense because you can see into the first level of the bar and it's half full) to the additional 1 hour wait to go to the upper level (where, again, you'd most likely find an empty or half full floor) to the crooked bouncers allowing people to skip the line and enter the bar through the exit for various prices ($10-$20 per person depending on their God complex, mood, and how you look and smell), you are guaranteed to find yourself at their mercy and, boy, do they love to let you know it.  Also, about this ""dress code"" and ""2 forms of identification"", it's obviously only posted outside so they can cover their aholes when they decide to profile and turn away whoever they feel like turning away at the moment. I say this because I see random guys get denied entry (it's usually guys that get rejected because the bouncers are boys with strong God complexes) without violating the dress code, looking drunk, or lacking proper identification, but then see guys with hats, baggy jeans, and Jordans get let through. You can still have hope though! If you're denied entry, sometimes the bouncers are nice enough to let you bribe your way in. But I guess that's how you get quality customers into your establishment right? Not so much. What you end up with are a bunch of bros dumb enough to fork over whatever hefty price the bouncer demand and that can only mean one thing - fights.  While waiting in line outside, I saw a few people get carried down by security from upstairs and get thrown out like EVERY TEN MINUTES. Yet, the poor people who'd made it inside and waited in line to go upstairs never moved. All these people being physically removed from the upper floor and there's still no room for any of the patient patrons waiting in line?

You may see some reviews about being belittled and racially profiled and I can say that I experienced just that with this particular bouncer. The bouncer checked all identifications, as he should do, but proceeded to keep mine.  Granted, I do look a little young to be 33 but I don't look 12, and my Alabama drivers licence is a little on the flimsy side but it's a LEGITIMATE ALABAMA STATE ISSUED LICENCE.  He and the other bouncer guy radio for an extra id check. Cool... me and my friends were all waiting patiently until we see him bending up my licence. There are cracks in my licence!!!  Side note:  To be honest with you, it pisses me off to show my bent up licence. Been using my passport now. Ok... Then the process of getting my licence back was a pain with having to get cops and the Secretary of State cop to verify my licence. All the while the bouncer smirking and winking his eye at me. Long story short, from my friends yelp reviews, the owner of the club contacted them and I ended up giving the owner a call. He reassured me that it is NOT their practice to racially profile anybody. He also told me that they were coaxed to be a more strict during TBOX and look out for fake id's. Totally understandable, but this was a bit extreme, unnecessary and uncalled for!!  The owner seemed to be regretful of the unfortunate ordeal. But do I find myself going back here?

Our goal was to get away from the crowded bars. All of us are from out of state but we work in Chicago. As we proceeded to go in, one by one, a tall Caucasian bouncer took one look at my friend's ID and told her it was fake and bent it up. He then refused to give her her ID back. Yes she is African-American. He said the only way he would give it back was if police were there. When the police finally showed up, we told them he destroyed a personal, government issued identification card, which he had no business doing so since it's an actual ID card. As we were arguing with the cops, this particular bouncer kept laughing and winking at our friend. Finally- all witnesses around started speaking out about him taunting us and racially profiling our friend- a medical graduate, successful, young African American woman who contributes to this society and saves lives. I'm a modern conservative and this down right offended me! Shame on this bar for allowing this bouncer to act the way he did without any repercussions. We banned this place and have told several of our coworkers about this bar- and none of us will ever be going here again. The cops even told us to file a complaint with management after they returned her ID back (because it was obviously real).

2014-12-14,1.0,"If the rogue, prejudicial bouncers in this establishment is an introduction to the type of service one will receive, I will take my business elsewhere. Come here if you want to be HUMILIATED, INSULTED, and/or BELITTLED by its customer service. BIGOTRY at its finest. I expected more from a progressive city like Chicago. A diverse group of my friends decided to go to this bar. We are all graduate/medical students who come from across the United States; thus, we do not all have Illinois IDs.  The two bouncers were reminiscent of the main characters of John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"": one short male who seemed a little more respectful than his taller, older, brainless counterpart. The taller bouncer gave our African-American, female friend a hard time with her out-of-state ID and accused her of using a fake ID. They bent it to the point that it was cracked in half. They refused to give her ID back when we decided to leave this establishment. Not only did these bouncers decided to vandalize her ID, but the further decided to withheld her ID, as if it was a declined credit card. The taller bouncer continued to taunt us, and dared us to get a police officer if we wanted to get her ID back. (Note: Voter ID went up to the Supreme Court because access to ID is not uniform for all socio-economic status, so this establishment also indirectly abused her civil rights).  Since it was a TBOX weekend, police officers were all over Clark St, and we were able to bring a group of police officers (over 10) to help us. Another staff from John Barleycorn who came to defend his rogue bouncers denied they had our friend's bent up ID in their possession, eventually they caved in and handed it in to one of the officers. One of the police officers, who I believe was actually a detective told us they would call the Department of State to verify the legitimacy of her ID, our friend agreed since she clearly knows it is legitimate, and the detective verified that it was legitimate and returned her ID. All that condescension and humiliation because of John Barleycorn's staff's complete incompetence and prejudicial tactics.  No manager ever came out to apologize to us. Nonetheless, the tall bouncer never apologized, and continued to show his disdain because his actions were just proven unjust. In Psychiatry, they call the tall bouncer's immature behavior as displacement - displacing his frustration with his own personal life to neutral individuals like ourselves. All we wanted was her ID back so we could go to another bar since we were clearly not welcome. Honestly, I would report this establishment to the ACLU if I could get enough people to report similar instances of discrimination. I bet many individuals under 21 with fake Illinois ID, who fit this establishment's ""dress code"" are allowed in without issue. Considering that Chicago is supposed to be a progressive city, I would expect much more from its businesses. I went to college in a rural town in Pennsylvania and HAVE NEVER experienced or witnessed such condescension!

2013-12-02,1.0,"Allow me by starting off this review with saying that I am a very laid back person. It really takes alot for me to give someone a horrible rating or review but with that being said....... ""Fuck this place!""  I will try to finish this review without melting my keyboard from the rage that is emanating through my body.  First off, I have been to all kinds of bars across the world. I travel often and love a good beer, fun environment, etc. I have been to tons of nightclubs, pubs in other countries, dive bars all over the world.  This is the worst fucking bar I have ever stepped foot in. I have been here three times now and that is more than enough for me to absolutely hate the place. I will tell you about my last experience that killed it for me.  I walked up and was barely let inside because I wasn't dressy enough. I had on a nice pair of shoes, a sweater and a nice pair of jeans. I was not underdressed or anything but I guess they expect suits now.  I witnessed the bouncer throw racial slurs at people, pick fights with people and flick people off for no reason. Granted, I understand they are dealing with drunk assholes all night but he did this to people after he denied them entry and they simply asked why so they knew for next time. I would understand if someone asked in a ridiculous way or was an asshole but you don't call someone a spic or flick another guy off because they asked why they couldn't come in.  Next we get inside and immediately, they make us coat check our jackets. Ok, this is new and obviously just to make money. I think it was $2 per item if I remember. Then we get to the stairs to go upstairs and the guy stops me and says I have to check my sweater in. Ok, now I am pissed because I don't understand how a dress sweater needs to be checked in. It wasn't a hoodie or something. Anyways, I do it because we are there for a friend's birthday.  I get upstairs and find out that they lied about the package price. When the party showed up, they said it was $40 instead of the $30 that they promised because the person who told us that had it wrong. Obviously another scam.  We partied and never once had a server come over to our section or anything. I had to keep going to the bar even after trying to hunt down a server. I left a tab at the bar and found they overcharged me and trying to argue it went nowhere.  I just paid and left. The only good thing I can say about this place was that the music that night was good. That is it. Nothing more, even if I wanted to.  This place is the shittiest bar I have ever been to.

2013-12-01,1.0,"Went to the bar hoping to have a great time with friends, only to leave with bruises and cuts!! I went there with a few of my friends (both men and women) visiting Chicago on a Saturday night, hoping to show them some true Chicago style fun. Arrived around 1am, and the place was not packed at all. We ordered a few rounds of typically-priced drinks, and figured we should end our night dancing upstairs. What started off as a fun party atmosphere quickly turned into a physical altercation. There was a bouncer waiting at the bottom of the stairs, who informed us we would not be allowed upstairs unless we checked our coats. We waited about 10 minutes drinking and deciding if it was worth it, because it was closing time soon anyways. As we waited we saw hoards of girls, and several guys all wearing heavy winter coats let upstairs. Confused on the policy, we asked again why we were asked to check ours, when obviously this rule was a bit lenient. The bouncer became very irritated and said those were the rules, and that's that. Wanting to have the most fun possible for my visitors in town, I decided to just pay the money and check everyone's coats. Whats a few bucks, compared to an awesome time in this coveted mystery that is upstairs right? ... Wrong. Upon going up the stairs, as if the bouncer's head couldn't get any bigger, he said ""Was that so fucking hard?"" which prompted my friend to reply, ""Just let us upstairs."" Within two seconds, the bouncer had his hand on my friend's shoulder and was screaming at him that he was getting kicked out. Confused, we got everyone who was already upstairs to come back down so we could exit the bar, for ...unbeknown reasons. Standing at the coat check waiting to leave, my friend was surrounded by 3 'security' men breathing down his neck to hurry up and leave. As we cooperatively exited the bar, my friend became annoyed and was questioning why they were throwing him out, since he had really done nothing wrong. However the bouncers decided that asking questions was apparently not a part of their policy either, and proceeded to pin him to a wall and aggressively force his hands behind his back like a criminal. From there he was lifted off the ground by the three men and physically dragged through the bar, where they proceeded to slam his body into the door, and ultimately whipped him to the ground, landing on the sidewalk/street.  This manhandling is completely uncalled for, and was by no means necessary. My friend was no where near over intoxication, or by any means getting physical with anyone, staff or patron. The physical forced used was a gross misuse of power, and ridiculous to do to a grown man. When a friend of the group asked to speak to a manager about the incident, he appeared clearly distracted by texting on his cellphone and proclaimed that they have the right to discriminate on any reason they choose, and they don't need to explain their policies on letting people upstairs or ""escorting"" people out of the bar. Disgusting. My friend was left with bruises, large cuts up his arm, and the reputation that Chicago bars are nothing more than an atmosphere for douchebags and an all over bad time.

Then we have to ask for cream and sugar and order one shot of baileys. About 5 min after that our food comes out.

When she finally came to, we discovered she had been at a private event at JB - she did not have a purse, ID or phone on her. We figured she had wandered away and lost her party so we walked her back to the John Barleycorns. As soon a we arrived the bouncer started yelling at us saying the girl was not allowed anywhere near the establishment as she has been kicked out.  (For locking herself in the mens room and not coming out- not for aggression or vomiting). My roommate and i were sober and explained that we found her passed out without any ID or money and if we could escort her in to find her party or belongings. The bouncer refused and yelled and made her leave the front of the building. My roommate went in to try and find anyone who knew her. Due to some other amazing samaritans who kept her purse and helped her get back to the suburbs she is ok and alive. Now- an establishment that kicks a defenseless and inebriated woman on to the street instead of calling the cops or putting her in a cab or letting her grab her purse should be condemned.

It also takes a lot for me to go out of my way to boycott an establishment and spread word to my various networks.  I lived in Chicago for four years before relocating, so I know what to expect from Barleycorn. My friends were celebrating their college graduations and contacted Barleycorn over a month ago. They wanted to do the wristband special (9-12) and asked the event planner if it was possible to reserve tables for the group for the wristband special (since we had about 15-20 people going). He said definitely and there would be no problem. Fast forward to the day of the party: From the second we walked in, almost the entire staff treated us like crap (We were completely sober and the place was empty, so we weren't wild or rowdy and we were dressed up nicely). Simple questions like, ""Is the wristband deal upstairs? Do you know who I can talk to about my party?"" were answered with such condescending attitude, like it was such a privilege that Barleycorn was allowing us to be there.  Worst of all plans that were made with the event planner evidently never made it to the staff a Barleycorn. Literally, almost every member of the staff looked at my friend like she was crazy when she asked about her party deal. Here are some highlighted issues: 1) We had no tables reserved (even though my friend had specific evidence of Barleycorn agreeing to it in an email) 2) The party host had to pay for her deal (I've never been at a bar where the party host had to pay),  3) When we tried to grab two free tables upstairs (recommended to us by the bottle service hostess, who was by far the nicest person we encountered) a staff member told us we couldn't do that and to consolidate (Then he told us he'd hook us up and let us sit in a booth in the bottle service area, but we never saw him again that entire night, thanks for nothing Darrel/Daryl). Usually when you plan a party/deal with bars, they bend over backwards to be nice to you. The experience at Barleycorn was, by far, the worst treatment I've ever seen by a bar to its patrons. I know places have bad nights, but it seemed like almost every staff member went out of their way to give us attitude.  If we hadn't gotten attitude at almost every interaction with a staff member, I don't think I'd be writing this review. PS: I'm not even including the incident where another bar patron literally out of the blue walks into my female friend and shoves her into a table forcefully, then proceeds to try and attack her.

I never really write or complain about businesses but I feel with the customer service I received, it definitely deserves a negative yelp review. I have planned many parties (birthday, graduation, just one for the hell of it). Each bar I went to clearly explained their policies and procedures while planning. For my most recent college graduation party- there was a lot of information left out and lack of communication with this bar. 1) I made a reservation for a party package over a month ago. Correspondence with the party planner was great. However, entering the bar was a total nightmare. First, the greeter was remarkably rude. When I asked her about a party I was having and after giving her my name, she looked at me like I was crazy (I was dressed in dress code, nothing in my teeth, completely sober- it was only 9pm). She said she had no idea and did not lead me into the right direction at all. I literally had to ask about 3-4 people about where I could get my wristband and where the tables I had reserved are located. 2) The Wristband was the next issue. Any bar I have hosted a party at has given the host a FREE wristband for bringing business to them. Even though, I myself booked the party, I had to pay for my own wristband. 3) I reserved seating and was told that was fine. I sat with two of my friends in a booth until we got kicked out of the booth (nicely, so props to the ONE worker who treated me and my friends with respect) since it was reserved for bottle service only.  4) The Reserved seating was no where to be found- it was a ""grab what you can"" deal which is fine but don't tell me you will receive seating for a large group of people and not follow through. 5) The wristbands only get drinks on one level of the bar- ironically its the top floor where me and my friends had to leave. We then grabbed two open booths waiting for more of my friends to come and had to give up one of those booths with the promises of getting more seating. This never happened. 6) The ""douches"" that go to Barleycorn- are everywhere so I am not bashing the people there. I had fun after the party got started but was extremely frustrated on the empty promises Barleycorn made for me. Party planning is stressful. Searching for the right deal, bar, etc is time consuming.

Again if you aren't impressed by the crowd, then you should focus on the group of people you came in with.  Ignore the ""dooshes"", and have a great time with your friends, or maybe its your friends that aren't that fun?hmmm ANYWAYS I have had a great time every time i go there, great staff, good music, and guaranteed the bar wont be empty.",0.9823,0.691,0.237,0.071,0.5987012987012986

2011-07-25,4.0,"I went to Barleycorn this past weekend with a few friends to celebrate a birthday and really had a really good time. The bar's downstairs has huge booths up against the far wall which I highly recommend trying to get. You could probably fit 7-10 people at one booth, but if you don't get one they have plenty of table tops. The decor of the downstairs is also really unique. They have amazing model ships outlining the bar which were the first thing I noticed when I walked through the door and caught myself staring at throughout the night. One other thing I really liked was the size of the bar. You don't feel like you are in a cramped space when you have to walk sideways just to get around the place.  Aside from the physical appearance of the bar, the service was very quick. As soon as I went to the bar for a drink a bartender greeted me and when we were sitting at the booth we were approached fairly consistently to replenish drinks and they were doing a great job of clearing finished drinks from our table. Overall they had a good selection and the drinks were pretty strong. For beer they had just about all the mainstream beers you would want on tap.  The upstairs is more of a club atmosphere versus the more chilled downstairs. This isn't the first time I have been to this Barleycorn and I find the upstairs to be very hit and miss. From my experience there tends to be several creepers and I have seen the occasional fight have to be broken up. But, this probably isn't much different from most club atmospheres.  Overall, I enjoy my experience at Barleycorn and very surprised the rating is as low as it is.

I definitely had never made it upstairs until Saturday night though, and I'm fairly certain I won't be back. The food here was pretty decent. My friends ordered the appetizer platter, and I ordered my own dish of chicken tenders. I stole a few tater tots from the platter, but pretty much stuck to my chicken tenders, which were quite good. But really, how can you screw up chicken tenders? They weren't overly dry, which you can find at some places, and they were ""hand-breaded"" so that was all good.  The downstairs area I was fine with. We were seated right away as it wasn't that crowded. We were seated in one of their huge booths, and our waitress was fast and friendly. We closed out our tabs and then headed upstairs to check out the scene. I had no idea there was a huge Vegas club-like scene up there. But seriously, it is huge with a DJ and strobe lights and two bars. The crowd was mixed. I wasn't planning on ""clubbing"" that night, so I was in jeans, tennis shoes, and a wool knit sweater, which did not mix well with how hot it was up in there. The music was good at first, but then they started playing way too much rap, and I was over it. I believe I did see a couple fornicating on the dance floor, so after my initial horror and dismay, I rolled my eyes and suggested we move to a new location, where people have the decency not to have sex in public. We changed locales, danced a bit longer, then skidaddled.  So in general, I didn't like the crowd or the vibe and wouldn't be back.

It was around 10:30am (12pm game) and there were a few tables in the front area open. We were a party of 5 and the hostess informed us that we would need to share 1 small tabletop that was meant for 4 people. I looked around at several empty tables and asked why we couldn't push them together since no one was sitting there. Apparently they needed to keep these open for the potential bar patrons that were sure to come in. Um, what about the people that are here now and ready to give you money? Really? After a little bit of push back she said she would push them together but if people came in and needed them, she would have to take it back. Yeah, go ahead and do that. I am sure your restaurant is going to fill up to capacity in the next 45 minutes.  With a sour taste in my mouth, we sat down to have a few drinks and apps. Luckily, our waitress was friendly and quick to bring over the drinks. The wings were dry and tough - but I give the house made blue cheese a little credit as it was quite tasty. The mozzarella sticks weren't crispy at all. Throw those bad boys in the fryer for another minute!  Obviously you don't come to Barleycorn for a fine dining experience. But I also don't come to have $7 an hour hostesses in last night's makeup/clothes act like we're putting them out by asking for tables to be pushed together.

First off - Barleycorn is NEVER my idea or my choice.  The only time it's socially acceptable for a 30-year-old woman to be at Barleycorn is after a Cubs game and that's ONLY if you're approximately 8-10 beers deep and fresh off a stint in the bleachers. With that said, it could be a lot worse.  At least the downstairs of Barleycorn is set up as more of a pub where weary drinkers can grab a seat and attempt conversation.  Upstairs is where the oonz-oonz dance music rages on for bumping and grinding into the wee hours.    Avoid the upstairs and you may make it out alive.  Of course, that's assuming you didn't blow all your cash on $5 draft Miller Lites.  WTF?  5 bucks for a DRAFT Lite?  Bogus.",-0.8479,0.836,0.052,0.112,0.5538461538461539

These did not go far amongst a group of 20 or so, and soon other overpriced bottles were needed. If you weren't with a VIP group, you paid $30 for all you can drink. There was initially a mix up where I paid the $30 because I didn't know about our group's arrangement. Luckily the wristband fellow didn't put up too much guff giving me a refund.

If you are actually 25, you should be smart and responsible enough to carry proper identification. Anyway, this girl wold not give up, holding up a bunch of people outside while the doorguys argued with her. Strike 1. A glaring indication of what you're going to deal with inside if I've ever seen one.   I finally got into the bar and found my friends, who instantly handed me a beer, so the 1st one I didn't pay for. Immediately after this I was asked by security to remove my hat (winter hat, as it is February), which kinda put me off. A bar with a dress code really isn't my scene. When I went to get my 2nd beer I asked for a High Life, which they didn't have. Strike 2.  I asked for a pint of Sam Adams, which I found out were $6 goddamn dollars when I went to pay. Strike 3.

The night I went, it wasn't crowded, so that worked out in our favor. We were dancing up a storm until we had to leave abruptly. But, no one seemed to really bother us while we were there, and I guess since I was with a lot of dudes and we were clearly a couple traveling party, so no one was too creepy. I didn't like that the coat check was 3 bucks and you couldn't hide a coat in another coat, but I guess in the summer this isn't that big of an issue.

That aside- Barleycorn's actually does a pretty good job with the large parties. The space upstairs is huge- bar in the center with a large dance floor and plenty of wall space to lean upon. There are tables on the one end but never enough to snag a seat (at least not when I've been there)  I could have lived without the giant bouncer at the door carding me and mumbling something about going upstairs only to have someone else grab me and affix a neon bracelet to my arm so I could drink but considering this neighborhood- I guess worse could have happened.  As for those bracelets- most of the time they go the bracelet route (feels a little collegiate) where you can drink anything you want and pay only one price up front. Where it gets confusing is- that in an effort to please everyone- everyone at the party doesn't have to buy the wrist band. So you end up standing behind some guy who wants some crazy drink that isn't covered and then starts digging in his pockets to pay. In my opinion- since it's a private party anyway- forego the bracelet and make it an open bar- so much easier. Of course, the onus is on them then to keep non party goers on the main floor.  Service runs the gamut- on some visits the bartenders have been great- on others- not so good so it's the luck of the draw. Barleycorns is not a place I would stop in unless someone I knew was having some type of party, fundraiser, or any of the other reasons I've been there.

If I'm drunk enough, I will dance, but usually only for a song of two, until I get sick of being groped and having some strangers half-wood rubbed against me. There is always a line to get upstairs and that is mind boggling to me. The last time I was here (last night) I saw some entitled, bottle service douche bag spit on the floor. Yeah, inside a building, just spit, and then when I glared at him, he told me to get over myself, as though the expectation that someone wouldn't just spit on the floor, in a building is pretentious.  The bathrooms are disgusting, even though they have an attendant, who isn't shy about asking for your money, most of the night. The drinks are disgustingly expensive, $5 for a miller light, that makes me feel more violated than the ""dancing"" I just endured.   Oh and there was a dance-version of sweet caroline at some point, it was more nauseating than the amount of liquor I had to drink to be convinced to come here. If you have to hang out in Wrigleyville, that's bad enough, don't come to John Barleycorn unless you're a masochist and looking to destroy any chance of having a  good time.",-0.985,0.753,0.083,0.164,0.49421182266009844

I started coming here when I was 18 for all ages date parties and exchanges and the like in undergrad, and continued enjoying this bar into my 25th year. Up until tonight, I would have given it 5 stars. Tonight, I went to their remodeled upstairs for an open bar event. It was advertised as $35 for 3 hours of open bar and appetizers. The appetizers were out for an hour, tops. No warning was given when food service was ending, it just got taken away (because another private party was sharing our room and that later private party wasn't supposed to have food, so we didn't get it either). We were not allowed to sit at any of the tables because they were ""reserved for bottle service"" (nobody ordered bottle service in the time I was there). They used to play sweet '80s music, they now play lame club music.  The bouncer in charge of the bottle service tables is named Justin. He is way too big for his britches and was a total asshole to everyone there who had paid good money for open bar. He needs to be fired, immediately. This bar has gone from a place which you love and were sort of embarrassed about to a place where only 19-year olds and d-bags from the suburbs who still live at home would be seen.

This is where you go in your college-aged glory days when you settle for shitty drinks and below par service. I used to come here when I first moved out to Chicago for specials maybe and my ex liked the place for dancing.  I never really liked it then and even after the changes that they made to the top floor I don't like it even more.  I actually liked the set up more back then where there was places to sit and lounge, and now it's just this open floor.  It was drama getting to come into the top floor because they said that there was a $30 cover just to get in and get a wristband.  You can't do one without the other basically.  So my friend who is celebrating her 30th birthday party is stressing out because all her friends she invited are mostly not able to get in.  She finally found a manager to prove to him via her blackberry an email he had sent stating the deal for her party and not having to pay the cover.  If she didn't have it, she would have been screwed.  It's so bullshit that you have this package and it doesn't include shots and stuff so it's not as if the bar couldn't be making money that way anyways.  Seriously, even if you want the general public to see this as an exclusive downtown club - this is not the way to do it or drive business.  Now, it only makes me want to tell people not to go here.  In addition to all the drama of getting in, it always bugs me when I hear a song I like that I am only able to hear for like 15 seconds and it gets changed over to something else already.  $20 minimum on credit cards.  Your mixed drinks will taste like the mixer and you will taste very little alcohol, so they seem to be very stingy with this.  Anyways, if you are chasing after ""young tail"", then this is the place to go.  Needless to say, I hope no one else chooses this place to party at.",0.4548,0.804,0.104,0.092,0.5776666666666668

We got there a little before our reservation, so we hit the bar on the 1st floor for a shot to kick off the 2nd part of our bachelorette party for Amy.  The bar was long and big, so there was plenty of room for our 9 person party to crowd around and ""SOCCCCIALLL!"" after being served.  It was still early and I realized when we left, that it definitely gets packed! Our bartender was recognizable and once we figured out who she was (For those curious, Toni from Paradise Hotel, which she vehemently denied once being asked - I would too but HELLO...you were on TV, and those of us who love crap, late night TV....well, we are probably the same kind of peeps that frequent the bar you work at now...why lie?) avoided us like the plague, which made me laugh and entertained me so much. The upstairs has two bouncers...one at the base of the stairs (gotta be on the list, dammit!) and then one at the top of the stairs.  We got sat, had our own cutie pie waitress and enjoyed a bottle of champagne.  Then, we hit the dance floor.  We had a great time at John Barleycorn.  And, the bathrooms weren't gross...which I always am happy to see...and there were plenty of stalls though I'm sure as the night wears on ...it gets more disgusting and more packed.  The line was REALLY long when we left around 1 a.m. to head to our next stop.  And the dance floor was bumpin', but we had our fair share of time here and needed to bounce.

There were two rude, egotistical and arrogant door guys who obviously carded me and I promptly handed one of them my id. Then one of the men asked to search my purse and I let him.

Second conversation with a friend: Me: Yeah, so I was talking with a co-worker today about the most douchebaggey bars in Chicago...oh, oh, can't remember the place.   Him: John Barleycorn?  That's my personal vote... Me: OMG!  Yes!  How did you know?  That is so ironic my co-worker said the same thing and I agreed!   Him: OMG!  All I did all night was stare at the wall and turn around every once in a while to stare at the crowd of, um, uh... Me: Douchebags? Him: Yes!

Music is loud, not an easy atmosphere for conversations, so its better to meet friends; groups.   Ladies while we men like to see your wonderful attire and shoes, like another yelper previously mentioned, you could get peed on.
