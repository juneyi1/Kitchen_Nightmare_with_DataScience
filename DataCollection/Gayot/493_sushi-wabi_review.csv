2012-07-03,4.0,"I am very sad that Sushi Wabi is closed. I feel as if a friend has moved to another state.  Sushi Wabi's gomae was the best in the country. The combination of the ultra fresh spinach and the creamy sesame sauce made them unforgettable.  While Sushi Wabi's gomae was like a princess, its seaweed salad was like an ugly duckling, which turned out to be a swan. It looked like a pile of rusted twisted nails. However, the chewy texture made it WINNING.  Sushi Wabi also had the best Japanese dessert in Chicago, if not the nation. It was the only place where I could eat legitimate Japanese pastry and red bean ice-cream outside of Asia.  Before Sushi Wabi was closed, it was one of the top three Japanese restaurants in the nation in my list.  Sushi Wabi, I hope you would evolve into a butterfly and come back to visit us again.

I wish I could tell you what kind it was, but my sushi knowledge is not very in-depth. I do know that I've seen that type of fish in other places before and it's always rubbery anyway, so it's not SW's fault. Just not our thing. Anyway, we also got the rainbow roll (we're big avocado fans) and an excellent sake recommendation from the waitress. Miso soup and edamame also delicious if you're a fan of those.

2012-04-10,4.0,"Awesome! Sushi Wabi was a suggestion from an old college roommate. I attended tonight in hopes that it would be as great as he said. I'm very glad he told me about the place. I love that it's located in the west loop; I use to live in the area so I new exactly where it was.  It's a small sushi bar were you're not forced to have a conversation with the table next to you, but it can be easily done. Wabi is great for a date, or just getting together with a small group of friends; no more than maybe 4 people to a party. The crowd was a mixed from college students to business professionals. The service was great from the moment we walked in, Thank you Sandra Y! I hope I spelled her name correctly. We didn't have to wait long for our food and if we did I didn't notice or care because I was caught up in good conversation. We each ordered a maki roll to share I had the fire roll, and my friends had the Godzilla, and spider roll. I think my friend who ordered the spider roll is scared for life, can you say arachnophobia. The stone scared look on her face when she got her roll was priceless. However, after getting over the fear and appearance she enjoyed it. Overall small intimate setting with very low lighting. The service was Awesome, the staff were great to look at for me. Maki was fresh and very delicious. The price is typical of any high end sushi bar make sure you have money in the bank. I would surly go again, and again and recommend looking for sushi to try this place great crowd for just a regular tuesday night.",0.9972,0.673,0.259,0.067,0.5568732574614927

Overall the sushi tasted fresh, but nothing really blew me away. If you are tempted by the truffle tuna on the menu I'd skip it, for the prices it's not worth it. It wasn't amazing.

Some of my favorites: Drinks - Pineapple hii - pineapple cocktail with sake Appetizers -  1) Yakitori (skewered chicken seasoned then grilled and brushed with red miso paste) 2) Gyu-negima (scallions rolled in thin slices of beef marinated in a sweet garlic soy) Rolls - VERY generous portions (1 is enough for a single person) 1) Ecuador - maguro, hamachi, cilantro, cucumber, avocado, green onion, jalapeno (careful of the kick!), orange tobikko, tempura crumbs, chili sauce, wasabi mayo, sesame 2) Godzilla - tempura shrimp, avocado, orange tobikko, cream cheese, masago, mayo, green onion, chili sauce, tempura crumbs, eel sauce,  wasabi mayo, sesame - you can't even taste the cream cheese which I really like 3) Hot Daisy - albacore, masago, mayo, sesame oil, green onion, chili powder - this one is wrapped in soy paper so it tastes a lot lighter and this roll definitely has a kick to it! Sashimi - Truffle tuna - seared with truffle sauce, avocado and parmesan(this is available as sashimi or nigiri) - just ask!  You can really taste the truffle oil used on these slices of tuna - the fragrance of the truffle and the richness of it permeates through your palette.",0.992,0.868,0.127,0.004,0.4813932980599648

The location was ideal for the start of our evening out in the rainy city and the place was a great setting for us to get lost in our conversations even with the full house around us.  A bottle of wine, two rolls, and a plate of tuna later, and we were golden. We arrived early enough so that there wasn't much of a crowd when our hostess sat us at our table near the window. The gradual build-up of the crowd was paired perfectly with our shared and increasing anticipation for our rolls as they were brought out to us. The atmosphere swelled around the restaurant as more people came in which allowed us to create our own little perfectly lit world in a restaurant where the tables are so close that you could eat off your neighbor's plate (if that sort of thing were acceptable, you know). I can see where the crowd and the noise might be a bit jarring if you just show up when it's already full but if you get there early enough, you won't have that problem.  The wine also helped. Our first plate was one of the evening's specials: Tuna Micro Green. This delightfully small roll was surprisingly packed with texture and flavor and it complemented our next roll quite well, the always delicious Godzilla roll. If you've never had Sushi Wabi's Godzilla roll, you're seriously missing out.  We skipped on the dessert to get to the Goodman but if you have a night that you want to kill in a cool West Loop spot, do it here (I'm sure you can say that about most places nearby but hey, this is my review).

2011-03-18,3.0,"My husband, sister and I went for dinner last night and had a nice time.  There were some hits and misses, but overall I liked it and would go back.  I ordered a glass of the pinot gris on their list and it was slightly frizzante and off-dry...and almost tasted more like a sauvignon blanc, which is what my sister ordered.  But I didn't taste her wine, so I don't know if they got switched or not.  In any case, it wasn't my idea of a typical Oregon pinot gris, but it wasn't terrible. Our server was nice enough, but not terribly friendly/helpful.  We sat at a dark corner table right against the bar and shared a few plates.  My favorites were the agedashi tofu (a special that day, which was odd since it's usually a standard dish; this was tasty and executed well, I thought, with delicious tofu), the saba nigiri,  the escolar nigiri, and the grilled asparagus.  The saba was buttery and delicious, and the grated ginger and green onion were perfect.  Also, the pieces were quite generous.  The escolar wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was good and I enjoyed the flavor imparted by the thin slices of lemon on top.  The asparagus was perfectly grilled and came with a miso sauce that was pretty good, but sort of lacking the savory flavor I was hoping for. We also tried the butterfish, which was a pretty tiny portion for $7.  The fish was actually a little bland on its own, but the presentation was very playful.  It was simply fried (nice and grease-free) and had all these thin sticks sticking out of it.  Small fried sawa crabs and a few kaiware sprouts were tangled in the sticks.  The crabs were a fun novelty.  The uni butter that was under the fish was the real star of the show.  I'm not the hugest fan of uni butter, but this was delicious and had a brown butter/caramel taste.  Good as it was, I would have liked the butterfish to be the actual focus! We ordered an Alaska roll while we were picking out the rest of the food, and it was decent--a nice amount of filling.  I was watching the sushi bar as we were eating and noticed that most folks were ordering the huge, elaborate maki sushi.  You know, the kind with 2 lines' worth of ingredients.  I think this is a good place to come for fresh nigiri and sashimi, but would skip the huge, overwrought maki.  A piece of sushi should be 1 bite, not 2 or 3!  But hey, that's just me.  I'll get off my soapbox now. We also tried the tsukemono, which was a standard assortment of packaged pickles along with some homemade red cabbage.  I've definitely had better cabbage elsewhere!  It was not very traditionally Japanese in flavor. I do wish the place were a little less loud...not just from conversation, but from the music.  They could definitely tone it down a lot!  Also, the lighting was so dim that we couldn't see the beautifully presented food very well!  Another pet peeve.

They do it with wasabi instead of black pepper! but it just turns out delicious every time I have it. So...here are things you should definitely try to get : 1) gyuza - fricking delicisous! It's on their appetizer menu. 2) Fire - this is a sushi roll but with tempura salmon in it. Very creative and amazing taste! 3) Seared Salmon - this is also a sushi roll. The way they cook the salmon is to smoke it and put special sauce on it. I don't know how they do it, but the cilantro taste is just perfect with this dish. 3) Hot dassy - also a sushi roll. But they don't wrap it with rice but some type of very thin layer, just Great! Oh..and it's a little spicy. I love spicy food, but if you don't, maybe tell the waitress before you put down the order to see if they can do any adjustment. 4) Tempera ice cream - this is the best dessert! they have 2 options, green tea or ginger. I always get green tea because I felt the ginger one wasn't flavorful enough to me. But the green tea temepra ice cream is the best temepera ice cream I  have every had in my life! The skin doesn't fell off when you are eating it (many places that offer tempera ice cream usually have this potential problen with falling off skin).  Sushi Wabi is the best sushi place in Chicago area to me. And their fish are absolutely fresh. I've been eating here for maybe more than 20 times, but I have never had food poison or upset stomach.

The lone item that stood out was the Butterfish.  We ended up eating: Butterfish - easily most interesting item on the menu.  Served with 2 tiny crabs that you could eat (a la fried shrimp head), the fish itself was a pretty small serving but delicious Tarantula roll - your typical spider roll Caterpillar roll - The avacado was finely sliced, making the roll look more delicate, and the presentation was there but again, your typical caterpillar Hotategai roll - spicy scallop, not sure what else was thrown in there, but it was a nice twist versus your conventional spicy scallop roll which has only scallop and spicy sauce Ecuador roll - Most illuminating roll on the menu description-wise.  I liked the flavor, but the cilantro pretty much drowned out everything else.

2010-09-14,4.0,"Sushi Wabi is located in the trendy Randolph Street district over in the West Loop. It was a late Friday evening and this street's restaurants were bustling. We approach Sushi Wabi and notice there are people waiting outside, but we had reservations so we don't worry too much. We were a little early so we waited outside for a bit. While sitting on Randolph, who do I spot approaching the restaurant? None other than former Chicago Bear Richard Dent! I immediately start hyperventilating and get really excited that we might possibly be dining next to a former Super Bowl Shuffler! Shortly thereafter, we're seated (unfortunately, not next to the Dents, but I still managed to sneak peaks over their way throughout the night). The décor was pretty cool. Dim lighting, rustic seating and a brick wall back drop. The place itself was small and the seating was pretty tight (for instance, to get out of the chair, the whole table had to be moved). However, it was still quiet enough to be able to carry on a conversation, without hearing our neighbors'.  There was also music playing in the background, but again, nothing too loud or distracting. It was mostly a dating scene with what appeared to be several couples enjoying an intimate sushi dinner, but also a younger, trendier group of clientele too. Maybe because of the long wait (30+ minutes without reservation) they probably wanted to get us out of there as quickly as possible, so the service was pretty fast. However, having said that, we didn't feel rushed. I immediately felt like we were in over our heads as far as food was concerned, having never formally been to a sushi place. We weren't quite sure what to do with all of the stuff on our table. The warm towels? And the stones? How do we separate these chopsticks? We decided to scan around and see what others were doing. We apparently didn't need the towels since we weren't eating sushi. As for the stones, I used mine as a chopstick holder and... turns out that's what they were meant to be used for, yay.  Now on to the food. The sushi looked like small works of art; very pretty and colorful. I was relieved that we had read over the menu a few weeks earlier and had both opted for entrees instead of sushi. To get things started we ordered the yakitori - skewered grilled chicken and scallions brushed with red miso paste. We got two skewers and the chicken was very tender and juicy.  So far so good and I was excited to order my meal. I ordered the chicken teriyaki (I know, lame to go to a sushi place and order a meaty entrée instead) and it did not disappoint. These grilled, glazed, boneless, skinless chicken thighs were like the appetizer, cut into very tender, juicy strips and covered in a sweet and tangy sauce. It was served with rice and steamed veggies (broccoli, green and yellow peppers, and eggplant?) which were also very good and tasty. To make up for not eating sushi at a place renowned for it, I ate my entire meal (except some of the last bits of rice) with only chopsticks :). The portion size was very decent, and it was filling enough that I took a pass on what looked like amazing dessert.  The drinks were a little pricey and not very strong ($9 for a martini) but the good food made up for it. The environment was pretty intimate (despite sitting very close to others) and was very hip and trendy - overall a fun night! And it was topped off with the Richard Dent sighting!",0.9984,0.817,0.156,0.027,0.5172129884004885

Tuna Truffle is worth passing up, the truffle is overbearing for the subtlety of tuna.  Everything else is pretty standard and tasty as expected. Btw, I'm officially obsessed with their Sake Gimlet cocktail.  It's a sake, lime juice, over ice combination that complements their rolls extremely well.  Tart, sweet, with a good, clean finish.  Definitely worth trying.",0.9762,0.801,0.173,0.026,0.47045454545454546

Cocktails in a place where the name translates to ""quiet of tranquil""? Sold. Parking was a terrible mess; the streets are confusing if you are unfamiliar with the area, especially after a having a drink or two. After acquiring a spot a few blocks away, I made a mental note to bring flats during my next visit as most of the sidewalks surrounding this little raw gem were gravel's evil twin, a loose gravel/sand combo. Not a stiletto's best friend. We were seated immediately (score!) and I ordered their sake version of a margarita that included patron citronage, a.k.a. Heaven in liquid form. Georgia tried two kinds of cold sake and was a fan of both.  Seaweed salad connoisseurs: a must at Sushi Wabi. Extremely fresh and no guesswork on the ingredients.

2010-08-19,5.0,"I have two favorite sushi restaurants in Chicago, but they are apples and oranges. I love Toro Sushi in Lincoln Park for its creativity, nontraditional rolls, small cozy feel and friendly and always visible owner (Mitch) which gives it a ""mom n' pop"" feel to it.  Wabi on the other hand has a great modern, industrial feel feel to it with its dim lighting, high loft ceilings and overall decor. If Toro embodies LP, Wabi really takes on the personality of NYC. There is always a sceney crowd that has a buzz to it. Toro is great for a Tuesday (never eat sushi on a Monday per Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential."" Google that if you must), while Wabi is more of a Friday/Saturday night before going out.  The sushi itself is great, the rolls are big and the rice is slightly warm which provides for a great texture and complements the ingredients surprisingly well. The fish is fresh and the quality of food and service overall never disappoint. The price points are higher than your regular sushi spot and being out in the west loop, its not as convenient for a extended lunch for us Loopers...but its worth the time, provides a good value for the quality and $5 cab ride in my opinion.  The chef's selection where they choose 3 rolls for you (which if my memory is right, costs the same as choosing two of your own rolls) is usually a good pick if you are indecisive.  Honestly, there is no other sushi that really compares in the area. There are plenty of sushi restaurants that will suffice for a quick fix/craving, but Wabi is a notch above the competition.",0.9971,0.758,0.225,0.016,0.46993051066580477

After eating here for the first time last night, I'm really kicking myself. Although it's a little pricier, the sushi is the best I've ever had in Chicago, and it comes really close to mirroring the sushi I grew up eating in Okinawa. I really put some thought into this incredibleness, and pinned it down to the way they prepare the rice -- it's the definition of perfection. Not too sweet, not too much vinegar, room temperature, and just the right texture........ Moving on, I had the seaweed salad (limp and crispy, I know, it's an oxymoron, but that's just the way it is), the Godzilla roll, and the hotategai roll. The Godzilla roll was just as incredible as everyone claimed on Yelp. The scallop in the hotategai was the freshest I've had in a long, long time. It just melts in your mouth like butter.

I first came to Wabi in December, 2007 when I was in Chicago for business.  A vendor took a colleague and me to dinner there, and it was a great experience.  We sat at the sushi bar and had great food with great people.  I don't remember what all we had other than the caterpillar roll and the godzilla roll. I had another vendor invite me to Wabi the very next day for lunch, and while I had to laugh (and think to myself, ""wow this must be THE place!"") I cheerfully accepted the invitation and was back at it less than twenty-four hours later.  Whoo!  I had to decline a dinner invitation to go back again that same day.  True story! I've been back twice since then and won't skip it on a trip to Chicago. Most recently, that same business partner that introduced me to Wabi (and has since become a good friend) took me here on my birthday.  Again, I was in Chicago for work.  Initially, I was upset to find out that I'd be away from home on my birthday, but my friend made it a positive experience by bringing me back for more wonderful sushi. We had our standby tuna tataki, the scallops with apple/plum sauce (forgot the name), an assortment of nigiri, and three outstanding rolls... caterpillar, godzilla, and fire. Wabi has a great vibe*, is always busy (but not impossibly busy), and most important, really great sushi.  It is a Chicago ""must"" for me, and probably will be for as long as it's there. *I realized that I say this a lot but don't explain it.  At Sushi Wabi, it's a lot of raw materials (woods, metals) - think Chipotle but darker and nicer, and instead of steel and aluminum, it's brass and copper.  The constant busyness is part of the vibe.  It's got an electricity to it.  The bathrooms are a hoot.  Step on a pedal and almost uncomfortably hot water comes out of a shower head positioned above a rough cast concrete sink.  You have to see it to appreciate it, but it's cool.",0.9954,0.81,0.165,0.024,0.4393099148913102

The absolute highlight of dinner was the FUJI APPLE FU!  You must must must try this.  It's a perfectly sweetened fuji apple cake (with the consistency of a carrot cake - it might've had some carrot in there) surrounded by a light drizzle of caramel, and topped with a scoop of ginger ice cream.  You will swoon :)",0.9545,0.8,0.154,0.045,0.62

MASAGO, the thing I specifically asked for non of. This is unacceptable. I could be a little more understanding if they were slammed but this is a simple un excusable mistake. The fact that I had to wait forever to get it in the first place, then for it to be wrong is...just not right!

I will preface this review by saying I would like to return for dinner, as I had lunch here. We started with the de rigeur edabame and seaweed salad complimented by a lovely savignon blanc. Perfect for a warm summer day. Then we over ordered on the rolls and sashimi. I deferred on the ordering to a client, as i will eat most any sushi and was very pleased with what was presented. The rolls were innovative- incorporating non-endemic flavours such as chili and cilantro etc. I suppose purists would abhor this, but these flavours were tailored to complement good quality fish. I will make a point of returning- next time for dins. I'll have to make sure to invent a special occasion though.",0.9663,0.825,0.162,0.012,0.6328798185941044

Between Saki, beer, and wine and a never ending selection of sushi, our party of 4 dropped close to $500.- but a good chunk of that was expensive french wine and the Saki.

2009-07-27,1.0,"I have gone to Sushi Wabi religiously since they opened, and I have patronized their restaurants easily over a couple of hundred times.  I felt for a long time that it had the freshest tasting sushi and greatest service.  I loved the place, the diversity of the clients, the location and everything about it.  Even when Sushi Wabi developed a reputation for being the it place to go for sushi, and it got harder to go without a wait, I stayed loyal even though I couldn't stand the annoying, superficial, narcissistic people who showed up.   Fast forward several years to today.  Even more pretentious and expensive than before, but this time without justification for the pretension and overpriced offerings.  Apparently, Sushi Wabi bought into their reputation and now pretend that they are the most wanted sushi restaurant in Chicago.  In reality, Chicago now has a plethora of fantastic sushi restaurants, many far better than Sushi Wabi.  Like the pathetic, too-old-to-be-in-a-bar desperate singleton who still thinks he/she's in their 20s, Sushi Wabi is now a has-been who thinks it is and pretends to be high end. My last visit from several months ago was mehhhh, but I thought I'd go again to give it another try.  A few weeks ago, I went to Sushi Wabi on a Tuesday night.  There were 3 tables with customers, the rest were completely empty.  The sushi bar is completely empty.  I have no reservations but it was clear I didn't need them.  It was only a party of 2.  The waitress says she cannot give us a table because she has reservations (there are approximately 8-10 open tables).  She looks disgusted we have no reservations but we tell her we are OK with the sushi bar.  She then tries to move us over to the back of the sushi bar next to the exit area of the sushi bar.  I tell her we want the corner of the sushi bar so that we won't be in the way of the sushi chefs and because THERE IS NO ONE AT THE SUSHI BAR and it shouldn't matter.  Hostess bitches about wanting to leave the corner open for parties of 3.  We point out to her (nicely) that the restaurant (at 7:30 pm on a Tuesday night) is empty.  She relents.   OK, so I can live with a bad hostess, but the real sin was the sushi.  The sushi, for the first time, is not so fresh.  Moreover, the spicy mayo overpowers (perhaps hides) the fact that the sushi is not as fresh as it used to be.  Could it be that it's Tuesday and they save the freshest fish for the weekends?  Don't know.  All I know is that we had a run-of-the-mill, get-it-anywhere type of sushi.  Sushi Wabi usually slays me with their incredibly fresh white tuna; this time I am left with that slight dead-fish tinge and smell.  We finish our meal and my dinner companion asks the waitress for another glass of diet coke.  She returns without the coke but with the check instead.  Wow.  We've been nothing but kind and friendly to her, even though she screwed up twice, but that's how we're treated.  OK, we're leaving.  We look around, and the reservations that the hostess was so worried about?  NONE of them showed.  So, when we left, there was only four customers in the entire restaurant, and all those tables that the hostess was so protective of?  They remained empty throughout our entire dinner, and there were even MORE empty tables when we left.   Sushi Wabi, you've lost my patronage for good.  You used to be the best, now you just think you're the best.  Laughingly bad hostess, rude out-you-go service, and shockingly subpar sushi.  It stuns me that I am leaving a subpar review for you.   Well, buh-bye, Sushi Wabi.  At least I can say I knew you when you were on top of your game and unquestionably the best in Chicago.",0.8232,0.762,0.122,0.117,0.5079729729729728

2009-07-15,3.0,"When I first moved to Chicago about 8 years ago, this was the place to go. It was trendy, it was fresh and fancy and it was expensive. (Plus, it may have been one of the only nicer sushi restaurants around at that time. This was right before the big sushi boom.) I went there at that time and thought it was the best thing ever! The sushi was so different and tasty and, again, it was the place to go. If you went to Sushi Wabi, you had it going on.  Fast forward to now. There are so many sushi restaurants popping up in the city that it is hard to keep up. Honestly, I haven't heard a peep about Sushi Wabi in years. The only thing I knew is that it was still alive. Since I hardly go down to the restaurant row on Randolph, I hadn't been able to try it again. Until last week... we were hoping to go to Veerasway for Indian food but it was way too crowded and loud... and we were hungry. So we took a stab at Sushi Wabi.  Interior: Looked the same - small, dark and trendy. There weren't too many people in there (about 8:30 on a Wed. night) so we were seated right away. (Note: after 9 pm there were still people coming in so it must still be pretty happening.) Service: Our waitress was very nice and came around enough but wasn't overly friendly or anything. I will have to say that our rolls seemed to take an awfully long time, though.  Food & Drink: I tried a peach/sake drink. So delicious! I was expecting it to be super sweet but was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. I could have had 2-3 easily. My boyfriend and I shared an order of the gyoza for an appetizer and split two rolls. The gyoza was okay. Nothing special... honestly I can probably make better ones. We ordered the Hot Daisy Roll and the Tarantula Roll. The HD Roll was with spicy tuna and a soy bean wrapper. It was very tasty but probably wasn't much different than a spicy tuna roll. The Tarantula Roll had soft shell crab and a bunch of other stuff in it. It was a pretty big roll which made it fall apart easily. Hard to eat, but still good. We were full after the two rolls. Really, both were good, but nothing that wowed me. There were tables around us that were ordering massive amounts of food and it all looked really good and fresh so maybe we ordered the wrong rolls? We did have room for the mochi ice cream which was SO yummy! We ordered both the passion fruit and butter pecan and the butter pecan was my favorite.  Overall, it was a decent experience. I liked being in a little trendier restaurant in that part of town. But I will have to say that I thought the rolls were just a little bit above average. There was nothing that special about them. It is a tad bit more expensive than other sushi places but not by too much. I would say the average of the specialty rolls are around $16. But there are tons of other restaurants with more unique rolls to try out there so I would probably hesitate to go back.",0.9972,0.8,0.159,0.042,0.5633996520982824
2009-07-13,5.0,"I was here for a date just this past Saturday and I was not disappointed at all! I was surprised, but only pleasantly. I called in for reservations earlier that day with no problems making them. Our hostess that night was pleasant and professional; she had seated us as soon as we showed up and confirmed our reservations. I was expecting a bit of a delay despite having called ahead because of the number of people present and waiting. The design of the restaurant struck me as minimal having a simple layout of easily reconfigurable wooden tables. The tables along the north wall of the restaurant could easily be put together for a large community table or separated off for a slightly more private dinner. You're separated enough from the other diners so long as the party next to you isn't boisterous, you'll have a fine time. But if you're looking for a very quiet, dimly lit candle light dinner, this probably isn't your best bet for that. It was unusual in that most Japanese places I'd been to prefer to cordon most of their guests off into their own tables or small rooms, but I really liked the feel of the almost-Grand-hall tables. The little touches to the table were great also, like the black rocks for chopstick rests and the individually filled/corked soy sauce bottles. But enough about the setup! Our waitress was well dressed and clearly spoken. She was quite familiar with the menu and answered all of our questions. She checked on us once during the meal to make sure everything was fine. Simply great. The food! We got the sake sampler, miso soup, the soft shell crab appetizers, two sashimi ume's, an ecuador roll and the fuji apple fu dessert. Let me tell you, all of it was damn tasty. I'm a little surprised how much we got, but, well, I had a pretty terrible lunch at an unrelated restaurant and it seemed like we should make up for it. The rest of this review will be describing each of my dishes if you care to read, but if it's too long or you don't want to read it, I'll summarize it. Delicious and beautifully plated; totally worth every penny I dropped on it. Miso - fresh and flavorful; not like the over salty kind you might get at a restaurant that made it in the morning and allowed it to sit all day. It came in a large bowl with a spoon for those of you that prefer to leave the bowl sitting, but you gotta embrace the full body of the miso! Bring the bowl to your lips and sip/slurp as you please. Use the chopsticks to help you get the morsels!  Sake sampler - our waitress introduced us to madoka, rin and sasaichi. I will warn you that while I enjoy sake, I cannot claim at all to be a sake expert, but I can provide my initial impressions. Madoka was a crisp and clean flavor with little to no after taste, it was simple and delightful. The rin was light and fruity flavored leaving a slightly sweet and wet aftertaste. I wasn't a big fan of fruity sake, but rin wasn't bad at all. Sasaichi was a complex and boasted a full bodied flavor; I loved this one. It was like enjoying the company of some dark mysterious stranger, ""Why hello, stranger. Please, tell me more about yourself!"". I simply couldn't grasp all that this had to offer and definitely want to meet it again. Soft shell crab - fresh and cooked to a crisp whilst the insides remained delicately succulent. The horseradish based sauce for dipping the crab? Oh my god that was good. If I were a crab and died, I too would prefer to be left to this sauce. ecuador roll - I'm not a huge roll fan, rolls feel like a diluted form of sushi coated in sauce to mask the taste of everything. So I'll sort of glaze over this. Although, I'll comment that cilantro in a roll was a neat spin. The sashimi - Chicago is not located near an ocean nor is it located in Japan. The fish though? It must have been flown in well and alive that morning. The strips of fat in the fish would melt in your mouth, the salmon was creamy and smooth, the tuna was bursting in flavor and the octopus was really great; still firm and with enough texture but not rubbery. Pretty good salmon is easy to find, amazing salmon sashimi that leaves you wondering whether it was a dream is much harder to find, Sushi Wabi proudly presents this. fuji apple fu - a soft apple cake topped with apple?-well, delicious ice cream with a sprig of mint and some a small pool of caramel sauce. It wasn't overly sweet and we split this down the middle seeing as we were quite full of the sea. A great way to end our meal with a bit of fuji. TL;DR Reservations were easy. Service was awesome. Food was really great. A little noisy at times, but good for a casual date. Definitely coming back.",0.9996,0.706,0.233,0.061,0.5595586187691449

The sashimi is very good, but their rolls really steal the show. Every time I visit, the Fire Roll is a must. It's a great place to come with friends and order new things on the menu. The staff is very knowledgeable. If you want to try something new, ask them what they recommend. The only reason I sided with 4 instead of 5 stars is the seating and noise levels. The seating compliments the raw industrial feel, but is not the most comfortable. You are also close by other tables so noise can be an issue. Later at night it has a lounge feel (great music) and gets very busy--- It's extremely fun, but difficult to hear at times.

Occasionally you'll get a bright spot but hard to find anywhere consistent, and just b/c you put all types of fancy garnishes and charge a lot doesn't make it good - good fish is good fish. Sushi wabi is not cheap, but it's worth it. As far as chicago sushi, the fish was very good (even on a monday night). I'm not a huge maki guy - I like to dabble but to me solid nigiri is the true test. Well..they passed both tests. Rolls were creative but not overkill and you could enjoy all parts. Wine and drinks were excellent. The service was excellent - helpful and attentive but not overbearing or pretentious. The big kicker was when my lovely girlfriend accidentally knocked over her martini, which had maybe 1/4 of it left, and broke the glass - immediately they cleaned it up, made sure she was ok, and made her a fresh one no questions asked. It was a subtle, even unnecessary thouch but showed they really valued our business and wanted to make sure we had a good experience.

2009-06-18,4.0,"Sushi Wabi was strongly recommended to me by some co-workers, so when I was out with a few friends one night and we had sushi cravings, I suggested we head there. While I was surprised that the place was pretty full even at that hour (a little past 11pm on a weekday), I admit I was also a bit concerned because the décor and loud music was reminiscent of the plethora of wannabe-trendy sushi joints in Vegas where the fish is nothing special and the service less so. But no one should let such a first impression be a put-off - this is a quality sushi spot. We started out with several appetizers, including the edamame, dengaku, ebi and soba, and salmon tartare. The dengaku is basically miso grilled eggplant; I'm not a fan of eggplant, but tried some and it was quite good. And since I'm a fan of zaru soba anyway, I naturally loved the ebi and soba; the cold green tea soba was fantastic and the shrimp topped with sesame seeds offered pleasant flavor and texture contrast. I'd probably pass on the salmon tartare though, unless a huge salmon fan - while very tender and nicely-presented, it got ""old"" after just a few bites, probably because the salmon flavor was overpowered by the marinade (most likely the mayo component). The nigiri here, while certainly pricy, was very good quality and I found the cuts generous. I tried the scallop, clam, ikura, kanpachi (it's not on the menu - we had to ask), salmon, and amaebi. All were great, but the amaebi was phenomenal - perfect texture and wonderful flavor. Also, the amaebi heads were perfectly prepared, with light batter and frying. Unfortunately they were out of the uni - I'm willing to forgive them on this, as we got there quite late (past 11pm) and they had run out. The service was quite good and attentive - the servers were polite and kept checking in on us, and the food was prepared quickly. I don't think our waters or hot tea ever got below half, much less empty. At the end of the night, my only disappointment was not getting to try more stuff on the menu. But that's what next time is for...",0.9957,0.764,0.184,0.052,0.5868610301263363

I realized that you are missing the one thing that I cannot live without! The one thing that my ex's LA and NYC had: awesome sushi. So I'm giving you one more chance. Life is too short. I want great sushi and I want it now! Sincerely, M Sushi Wabi may just be the last straw. This is heavily cited as one of Chi-Town's best sushi spots. So so disappointed. I went here last weekend by myself because I was in need for sushi. I found a parking spot in 3 minutes. There were 6 parties waiting ahead of me and I didn't have a rez. No problem. There was a vacant seat at the bar. S-W-E-E-T! There is a DJ on Saturdays spinning some hip-hop classics by Masta Ace and Pete Rock and CL Smooth. Okay. The place had a cool little vibe and people were having fun. The service was prompt. I ordered a Sapporo...Oh Darn! I saw the first sign of a mediocre sushi experience: pre-sliced raw fish. Bad! This ain't no deli at Jewel Osco or Ralph's! Unlike cured or processed meat, raw fish lacks the salt or preservatives necessary to keep it from rotting fast. When you pre-slice raw fish, you expose the surface area to harmful bacteria that contaminate the air. This degenerates the raw fish faster than when it is left whole. The first sign of this degeneration is that the fish starts to ""sweat"" leeching out fluids. It may be edible, but it certainly is not fresh.  Sushi Wabi pre-slices all their raw fish for rolls. It is set up as a factory line. One guy slices everything: veggies and fish. One guy rolls the rice and seaweed with the filling. One guy slices and plates.  I avoided the rolls which left me with just nigiri a la carte. Their menu doesn't offer Tuna for nigiri. That's also a bad sign. Tuna is the most expensive fish at $13-19 a pound. This means that Sushi Wabi buys average quality Tuna and utilizes it in the rolls where they can disguise the lackluster quality. The prices are expensive for Chicago, but way cheaper than LA or NY. I ordered: 2 Ama Ebi 2 Fluke 2 Hamachi Kanpachi Albacore Salmon The best thing I ate was the Kanpachi which was a special. Translation: they bought it fresh. The rice was too gummy---almost a paste---because they prep it way ahead of time and add water to prevent the rice from drying out. The dinner cost me $95 including one beer with 10%tax and 20% tip. I think Sushi Wabi is okay if you haven't experienced really good sushi yet. Now, would you go back if you were me? That was a rhetorical question.",0.9597,0.825,0.113,0.062,0.5075511294261293

This is one of my old boss' favorite sushi places so whenever we got sushi for a meeting or event it came from here. Also, many times when we went out for lunch we ended up here too, which is fine since I didn't have to pick up the tab. This place is crowded! Whether you're going for lunch on a Tuesday or for dinner any night of the week there's always a steady stream of people. On one of my work-related visits we brought another member from my team who is a vegetarian, but loves sushi. Personally, I don't get it, isn't the point of sushi the fish? Anyway, $8.50 for an asparagus roll? Really, for $8.50 I'd expect a lot more (like fish, truffles, free dessert, something) - there isn't one ingredient listed that warrants such an insane price.  I can't comment on the freshness of the fish, as I've said before my biggest pet peeve is how most places dice up the fish with the spicy sauce. It makes it hard to tell how much fish you're getting and the quality of the fish.  Again, I felt the spice in the spicy rolls to be lacking, but I will give the place points for making some creative rolls. Bottom line: this sushi doesn't knock my socks off. While the decor is cool, it leaves me feeling very uncool - like I'm not trendy enough to eat in a place like this.

Which brings me to the food - their Dragon Roll is probably my favorite food on planet Earth.  (I've had dragon rolls elsewhere... not the same.)  The Godzilla roll is great too.  And if they happen to have the special roll with the calamari on the inside - get it.  I've only been lucky enough to get it once, but it was fantastic.  I always get a sashimi platter there as well.

The girls and I sat by the sushi bar last night and watched the sushi chefs as they constructed perfection after perfection.  We were starving when we got there around 9ish and it seemed that every order they finished was never ours.  My friend started wondering what would happened if she just started taking sushi right off the sushi platter!  To make the time pass faster we started asking the sushi chefs which each roll was as they finished.  They all looked so decadent.  Shortly after the sushi chefs just starting announcing each roll to us as they finished.   At last we got our first roll, the special Hot Daisy.. oh oh delicious.. I'm huge on white tuna so I was very, very pleased.  Next came the Fire roll.  OMG for you spicy lovers out there.. This is a must try.  The sauce is deadly.  Your mouth will catch on fire!  We had actually planned to get the Ecuador and spicy tuna roll as well but decided it may be a bit too much for the 3 of us.  We canceled the spicy tuna order and placed in a hand roll each instead.  Wow, I have never seen a hand roll this big in my entire life.  It was GINORMOUS!!!  The sushi chef could hardly hold the roll together himself as he made it.  I held the spicy salmon hand roll with both hands as I devoured it as if it was an ice cream cone!  They were extremely generous with the sashimi too.  The hand roll was packed with salmon.  I didn't find any rice until I reached the bottom of the seaweed cone.  Needless to say, we could hardly finish the rolls we ordered and had to cancel our Ecuador roll.  The pricing here is decent too.  The miso soup which is excellent is only $2.  The rolls start at $4.25 and go up to $17.  The $17 rolls are huge and worth every penny.  I like the rolls here much better than Japonais.  The next time I come I want to try the Tarantula, Ecuador, Caterpillar, and Godzilla rolls.   Tip - Make reservations before you go.  This place is busy all the time.  Even with reservations at 9pm on a Wednesday we still had to wait like 10 min to get seated.",0.9958,0.816,0.162,0.022,0.5109002976190476

The sushi is ridiculously overpriced, and the chefs don't seem to be skilled. I ordered a ($35) sushi platter that had about 9 pieces of nigiri on it and 2 maki rolls. The rolls were constructed well, but the fish inside them tasted rancid. The fish on the nigiri wasn't bad, but it looked like it was cut with a buzz saw. When I think of nigiri, I want nice, expertly-cut pieces that aren't ripped and don't look like I made them myself. It just didn't look right, and they gave me all the cheapest fish for chef's choice. Chef's choice is supposed to impress, not clear stock of overstocked fish. If there's a next time, I'll go a la carte and order some of their specialty maki because they looked delicious. Also, can anyone tell me what the rock is for?

For rolls, we had negi hamachi, california, godzilla without sour cream, and futo maki.  I was excited to try futo maki, since not many sushi places make it, and it was just as good as I remembered. Godzilla was surprisingly delicious, esp. considering it's not one I typically order.  I appreciated the fact that the sushi chef went light on the teriyaki sauce, and the tempura flakes were the perfect crispiness and flakiness.  The California roll was a bit strange -- there was at least two layers of Masago on the outside, yet lacked any taste.  The imitation crab was also rubbery and tasteless.  Overall though, the fish was extremely fresh, and I do think their rolls are made extremely well.  I appreciate their cocktail menu, and non-sushi options as well.  Definitely one of the better sushi places in Chicago.",0.9947,0.755,0.23,0.016,0.49196428571428574

But I think it's great fun. The specialty rolls, though not imaginative in their combinations, are pieces of art. Exquisitely luscious.  My personal favorites include the deservedly-hyped godzilla roll, as well as the ecuador and fire rolls.  The fish is fresh, the service has never failed me, and the designer cocktails are uncomplicated but divine.  Try the momotaro-- unfiltered sake and peach nectar over ice.

My only complaint is that most ""hip"" sushi restaurants have many specialty rolls to choose from that have interesting or new combinations - Sushi Wabi has a fairly small menu, and not too many innovative combos - but frankly I like traditional sushi more than silly hip sushi anyway.  Some people may be expecting the latter because it's a hot spot these days - so be forewarned.

Fortunately, those three things are so spectacular it has kept me coming back for more....  Tuna Tataki - thinly sliced seared tuna served with a miso and Japanese mustard sauce. Great starter!!   Ebi and Soba - orange sesame shrimp with a chilled green tea soba noodle salad. Good to hit up for a quick carb fix... although not nearly as heavy as most noodle dishes.     The GODZILLA roll, which used to be a secret item not featured on the menu, has since moved up to become common knowledge and I guess that's good for those who were not previously 'in the know'. It's delicious, huge and usually can suffice as a meal in itself for me....  With tempura shrimp, orange tobiko , avocado, cream cheese, green onion, chili sauce, spicy mayo and sesame seeds it's far from traditional Japanese fare, but oh-so-goooood!!!

We were lucky enough to get a table right away but we also showed up at 11:30.  That's a little too close to breakfast for me.   I thought the industrial space was sort of neat...until they jam-packed the restaurant full of patrons and I couldn't hear my lunch-mates.  They shoved the tables so close together that I felt like I couldn't get up to go to the restroom without pulling a Wrigley-field-bleachers-like ""ass in the face of stranger sitting next to me as I scoot by"" manuever.  Not cool.   But the sushi was fresh, and the specialty rolls were great.  I loved the godzilla roll, and the rainbow roll was excellent. The edamame was fantastic, once it arrived.  Note to waitress--- when you forget to bring our edamame, just say you forgot it.  We're not going to believe that ""there was a delay in the kitchen"" when we just saw 4 other tables get  theirs and we know there's just a ginormous vat of edamame back there....

Sushi Wabi isn't that large of a space - so obviously I made reservations for 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night.  Unfortunately, we were kept waiting for 45 minutes for our table, and many of the other patrons with reservations also were left without a seat.  Normally, I'd cut them some slack, but there's not much room for milling about in this space, so we were cramped between the bar and the restaurant.  Fortunately, they comped our drinks for making us wait so long, but still it was not a great way to start the night out. Once we were seated, however, any annoyance with the seating issues were quickly forgotten as we started feasting on some top notch cuisine.  From pieces to rolls to entrees - everything that was brought out was a sensory delight.  The wasabi encrusted filet was done as well as I've ever had.  The space is crowded and it is a modern decor, but it feeds on the intimacy of sharing sushi with your group and makes for a fun evening, in my opinion.  The bill came and it was pretty pricey, but was well worth it in my opinion (especially since the company was paying.)  It's one of those places that's great to go with friends in from out of town or for a special occasion, but not somewhere I will put in a regular rotation.",0.9928,0.793,0.174,0.033,0.4896634615384616

2007-05-22,5.0,"I've been to nearly every sushi bar in the city, this is by far my favorite. If there's two things I continuously seek, it's margaritas and sushi... this place has the best of both. Sushi Wabi's list of sushi is extensive and some of the freshest I've tasted. You have the option of substituting for brown rice here and also have the option to create your own maki rolls. Each day they have a house sushi roll for the day, and it has always been phenomenal. It's usually rather big and contains a lot of ingredients and fish, but is oh so tasty! I strongly recommend trying it! The margaritas here are probably the best I've tried in the entire city. I've spent time at plenty of mexican and latin places, and this top shelf margarita blows any out of the water. A lot of patron and a lot of patron citronage and just a splash of their fresh lime juice mix and they have seemed to create something worth remembering. The atmosphere is trendy without trying too hard. Unlike Tokyo 21, less is more. Inside everything is very clean slated and black, as if you were walking into an actual Tokyo bar. No signs of overly gaudy Japanese scriptures or anything like that. The place is always full which adds to the element. No matter if you're there at lunch, happy hour, or dinner, you can always expect a full unpretentious crowd; which is rare for a trendy sushi joint.  You can expect to spend a decent amount here. Everytime I go I spend somewhere between $50-$70 depending on how many drinks I have. Honestly though, the entire experience and food is well worth it.

2007-05-14,1.0,"For what you're paying, please expect better. The rice here is terribly bland and I'm not sure they understand that sushi rice is constructed by carefully folding in rice wine vinegar, sugar, and salt because their rice is so sloppy. In fact, the construction of their pieces is incredibly sloppy, and sometimes I think they just hire Asian guys so people think it's authentic, but they're all wet behind the ears. The sloppiness of their cutting and rolling is important, because it's indicative of how sloppy their cutting the fish too. The fish needs to be cut well so that each piece is equally marbled and whole so that the effect is it melts in your mouth. This place ignores that tenant of sushi preparation too. I agree with the other reviewers that the ""chefs"" here seem entirely ignorant to the quality of their fish or really just what they're doing. It's like they grabbed a tutorial from Rachel Ray on how to make sushi with overpriced fish and opened up shop by the design of some hipster kid from California. I'm sorry, but your ethnicity doesn't automatically make you expert in a cuisine, especially something requires real tried and true training. I guess it's a specious tactic that's worked.  Considering its proximity to the best fishmongers in the city, I'm surprised by their fish quality. I'd expect them to be better than mid-level places considering the price you're paying, but aside from the size they cut you of the fish, the quality is way beneath their class. The ambiance is very much the frou-frou LA wannabe style that makes me hate LA. It's all about crowding and packing the seating so people feel like the place is packed and so therefore ""cool"". They give up space that could be used to seat their customers for that attitude. For a city with no direct oceanic access, there are a lot of great fantastic sushi places, especially if you're in this price range, but cut through the hype, and the sushi just doesn't make the cut. What can I say? For this quality, I'd rather not pay triple digits as someone else pointed out. If I'm going to pay triple digits, I expect someone behind the counter with skill and profession, someone at the market with concern and knowledge, and a wait staff that cares that you ordered an hour ago for food.",0.9708,0.808,0.118,0.074,0.6524183006535946

The food itself is delicious.  I loved their tempura udon and dragon maki.  Their gyozas were good too.  In fact, the food's great.  It's just that when you consider the price, it's a bit of a rip off.  It's not the best sushi you can get, so why is it so expensive?  Maybe I'm not being fair.  Back home, I would get the same quality food, but for a much cheaper price with a lot more quantities.  I'm just used to sushi joints like that.  And to see decent sushi bars in the Chi so overpriced with just ""decent"" fish is upsetting.  This is the sixth sushi place I've been too, and frankly, I'm starting to give up.

2006-04-03,4.0,"Go to Sushi Wabi for good flavored sushi rolls - not necessarily for the environment, service, or prices. As with most sushi places, how much you like this place depends on what you order. I've been exhausted with other Chicago sushi restaurants offering bland rolls - this is definitely where Sushi Wabi excels. I believe Sushi Wabi punches the most flavor into rolls like the Godzilla or the Fire. My boyfriend loves the Spicy Shrimp. I actually crave the Godzilla when I am away for work during the week - and no other sushi place can seem to fulfill that need for a flavor-filled roll. I keep trying other cheaper places, but find myself always disappointed and promising to never cheat on Sushi Wabi again. The environment is dark and small, and the tables are weird yet functional. You may be literally bumping shoulders with people. The service is mediocre, but the food makes up for it. The neighbor restaurant takes up ALL the street parking for valet (I have actually seen the valet move the sign over when a car leaves), but you can park on a side street.  They offer delivery now, but it isn't as good as in the restaurant. I also wish they were open for lunch on the weekends.",0.9474,0.829,0.124,0.047,0.5384920634920635
