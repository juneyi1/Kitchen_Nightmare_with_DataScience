2017-08-15,1.0,"I have been by Las Fuentes several times and looked forward to trying the place. When I arrived, there was no one near the door and I wandered through the dining room and found no bar stools and no people at the bar. As I was alone, I was hoping to sit at the bar. So I kept walking and found all the patrons, as well as all employees, were on the patio. So that was ok and I was seated in the lovely patio area. The waiter, Alejandro, didn't get there for a while. To be fair they seated me and a three top in his section at the same time. I get that, I've been a server. When he did arrive, he didn't speak or smile. I tried to order cheese dip and he simply shook his head silently at me. The menu read, Queso Con Chiles: Melted Chihuahua Cheese mixed with poblano peppers, so I asked if they had any cheese dip and he simply said no. When I ordered a Michelada, he asked chicken or beef?!?!?! I had to point to the menu to clear it up. Then when I ordered my Steak Burrito Suiza I pointed to the menu to make sure he understood and said, ""Steak""! So they brought me a Chorizo Burrito. Then he argued with me about it!! Finally, he delivered the correct meal. The steak was overcooked and tough. He never smiled at me until he brought the check, after I asked for it. He never asked how my meal was and never asked me if I wanted another drink. All in all it was a bad experience and I will not go back. It was quite a disappointment.",-0.8315,0.83,0.069,0.102,0.46007180650037793

2017-08-06,3.0,I think the reason this place is very popular it's because of its patio. The patio gets 5 stars. The food was alright. Carne asada was well cooked. The service could have been a lot better. We waited over 15 minutes to get a server to come to us. Margaritas were not bad. Not as cold as I would have liked them.,0.9293,0.764,0.236,0.0,0.7933333333333333
2017-07-27,4.0,"Well, I think I'm obsessed. The Mexican food here reminds me of my favorite Mexican restaurant back in LA, and it makes my heart so so happy! Las Fuentes has the cutest outdoor patio area, and on any weekend night, it's packed. I can't tell you how many times I walked past this place thinking, ""if it's always so busy, it has to be good!"" Then I finally tried it out, and IT IS. My boyfriend and I come here way too often, and I'm obsessed with their cheese enchiladas. He likes their carne asada, either as a dish or in tacos. The chips and salsa leave something to be desired, and the tables are almost always sticky and/or wobbly. But it's basically part of Las Fuentes' charm. The service here can also be really hit or miss. There are a couple of nice waiters, but one time, my order was royally screwed up (read: so much so I had an allergic reaction) and I didn't even get an apology.  Come expecting Mexican food without any frills, and you won't be disappointed. The four stars are for the cheese enchiladas with verde sauce alone!",0.6677,0.82,0.106,0.074,0.5176470588235295

Daniel and the staff at Las Fuentes went above and beyond for us over and over throughout the planning process and made the experience so easy and so fun for us. We hosted 85 guests on their outdoor patio and used about half of the space. They purchased large cedar trees to separate our group from the others on the patio. They let us bring in whatever decor we wanted, had a great package deal for us, and treated our guests like they were the only guests in the restaurant that night. Their margaritas are AMAZING and the food was delicious. Overall, it was exactly what we wanted. The music was great and they even let us play our own playlist so our guests could dance and so that we could have a first dance as husband and wife. It was the best party!

The space inside is gigantic, and decorated in your traditional Mexican restaurant style, however despite its size it was empty.  And rightfully so, it was a beautiful Chicago summer day and we do not suffer thru nasty winters and a rainy spring to dine INDOORS on a beautiful day!!!   Plus, this patio is amazing!  It's big and the walls are creatively painted to look like a scene in Mexico or Spain, and there are festive lights hanging above, a fountain, and even three large TVs so you can watch the Cubs or other sports while you dine.  One of the better patios in the area in my book.  See my pic if you don't believe me.  Oh, yeah, now you believe me, dontcha! The food and margaritas were delightful.  We had the 'especial' top shelf margaritas and not only were they yummy but they packed a punch.  Chips were great, salsa was only mediocre (my only knock - it wasn't bad, but hey I'm a salsa connoisseur and want the salsa to wow me).  The menu is huge and everything we ordered was great.  Highly recommend the dish I had:  churrasco tipico 'Las Fuentes' however I also want to go back to try many more.  Service was good and on point.  All in all my first visit was a great one and I understand why this restaurant has been around forever - highly recommend you check it (and it's patio) out for yourself!",0.9989,0.654,0.314,0.032,0.6636813186813187
2017-06-04,2.0,"Patio is obviously great. Amazing atmosphere, pretty good food. It's probably more expensive than it should be but you understandably have to pay for the location and awesome outdoor area.    The biggest problem is I think the management encourages waiters to rip people off. YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO CHECK YOUR BILL. I go here all the time, and I've never written a review on a restaurant but they add extra drinks and entrées to my check so often that it can't be a coincidence (more than half the times i've been there).  The reason I think the management is in on it is because it's not worth it for the waitstaff. It's a HUGE problem. Other people i know have noticed it too. maybe this review will be taken down but hopefully someone over there understand that people are talking and they get it taken care of.

It was devastating because they have such a lovely patio area that I would have loved to frequent, but the food is just that bad.  I've tried stomaching both the tacos and the enchiladas (two staples that should be relatively easy to make), but neither are great. One time I was served hard rice. The chips and salsa are bad. The salsa is closer to tomato sauce. The margaritas are also bad.

I understand that it can be a daunting task to accept a reservation for upwards of 20 people within a week of the actual event. It was a pleasant surprise to see that Las Fuentes was able to accept this reservation with no apprehensions. The restaurant was clean, lively, and had five enormous TV screens surrounding our tables for those of us so inclined to watch the Vikings/Seahawks playoff game.  Service was prompt, pleasant, and accommodating. I ordered chilaquiles with chicken, which was quite delicious. Nothing can draw me back to a restaurant like this like a good plate of chilaquiles. Las Fuentes took special care to divide the check among my group. I know this isn't part of their normal procedure, so it was very much appreciated that they took the time to help us.  This was a very positive experience and food was delicious, and I will definitely come back again!",0.9947,0.698,0.283,0.02,0.6066120387548959

But like many people have said in reviews, the patio is amazing, and it would be the only reason I ever return, not sure if it's worth it though....    It seems like many people are complaining that their food took too long but in our case, our food came out way too fast and it ruined the whole experience.  First, within a minute of being sat we were approached wondering if we were ready to order. No, not yet, but hey we will take a margarita if that's okay... The margaritas are NOT good. Watered down and way too sweet.  The waiter was extremely pushy about us putting our order in but it's Friday night and we wanted to enjoy our drinks, the patio and the beautiful summer night. After he came over about 3 or 4 times within the first 10 minutes of seating wondering if we want to put our order in, he mentions that the food may take up to 45 minutes, so we decide put in our appetizer. 10 minutes after that we put in our entree.  Appetizer comes out pretty quick, but that's ok. I was most excited about the empanadas, however I bite into it and it was frozen in the middle. Before I even get a chance to say anything, our ENTREE COMES OUT!!!! The food runner says, ""Sorry the food is coming out fast tonight."" Drops the plate and runs off. We haven't even started our appetizer, I haven't even had a chance to complain about the frozen empanada, and then our entree is already out.  The food all came out within 15 minutes from when we first placed the appetizer order. I ask the waiter, ""What's going on here? You said 45 minutes at least..?"" He does not care, ""Food is being made fast I guess."" I was annoyed to say the least. Waiter does bring fresh empanadas, which turn out to be pretty good besides the fact that we now know they are frozen. I also get annoyed that he tries to take our appetizer plate off the table when we weren't done with it yet. I had to tell him to leave it...  He never apologizes about the frozen empanadas, and he never apologizes about the food all coming out faster than the speed of light. I noticed they were doing the same thing with other guests. I GET that turnover is important, but do not be so obvious about it and treat your guests with a little more respect. Guests come to a restaurant not only to eat, but to have a good time and enjoy their experience. Restaurants nowadays just want people in and out, and it's not nice.

Meanwhile the mgmt  hides behind their abacus tallying the number of orders they got right.  Pretty easy to count to 0 clown boys!

We ordered the fresh made guacamole. Now, I don't think it was made fresh because it came out in less than 15 sec and the tomato chunks were mushy and the onions were slimy. Yuck! Fresh made takes longer than 15 sec. Moving along, we literally were left to wonder if the waiter went home or fell asleep in the next room. After 35 mins he came to take our order.  I ordered the chicken with mole sauce. The mole superb! The dish came with Mexican rice and plantains. My friend ordered combo #3. She isn't as adventurous as myself.  The flan was delicious.

We explore all kinds of little Mexican joints around the city every weekend, and this place still has some of the best mole I've tasted.  The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful...with the exception of one experience we had last summer (should have left this review months ago): My husband's cousin was visiting from Brazil, and she had never had Mexican food before. Being a lovely summer evening we thought we would take a nice walk and sit out on the patio to share a pitcher of margaritas and introduce her to some of the different Mexican dishes. It was her last night in Chicago, so she offered to treat us to dinner. She paid the bill with her credit card, and as we were leaving, our server stopped us and yelled ""So what, you don't tip??""....our cousin immediately realized her mistake, began to pull out some cash, and explained to the waiter that in Brazil, the tip is always included on the bill and she is not used to adding anything extra. Instead of accepting her apology--and apologizing for being an ass--he instead continued to interrupt her, call her names, and accuse us all of being cheap in front of a packed patio of customers. We told him to get the manager, who turned out to be the owner's son. He was clearly embarrassed (not as much as we were), and apologized for the waiter's behavior. An hour later, we called the manager and he told us that the waiter had been sent home.  Getting over our anger a couple of months later, we began to return to great service and food (never did see that waiter again).... So this place had 4-5 stars again in my mind until this past weekend when we had other relatives in town. We had planned to go to B.L.U.E.S., so stopped here for dinner beforehand. First our tamale appetizers were FROZEN---literally, ice inside. The waiter apologized and brought out more that were hot...but we are terribly disappointed to now know that these things are frozen before they come out, and are not freshly made. Then our meals were all brought out at different times. We were only offered one free drink (there were four of us) and one free dessert.

The patio is lovely and is very scenic and quiet for being in the city. It was exactly what I was looking for when I tentatively booked the event over the phone. When a friend and I first visited to taste-test the food, we couldn't believe how good the mole was. Daniel and his family are rightly proud that they make all of the food themselves, and the only thing missing is an IV for that mole sauce. I was a little worried because buffet food doesn't always hold up well, but the food was excellent and many guests commented on how much they enjoyed it. The service was very good, and the waiters even helped us with the pinata by standing on ladders and holding it up on a rope. I appreciate that they let us bring the pinata, our own decorations, and a cake. I would definitely hold another party here, and we plan to go back on our own for dinner to sample more of the menu.

2011-10-29,2.0,"A couple of nights ago a handful of friends and I went to Kingston Mines for the first time, but before we did, we stopped in at Tepatulco to get in on  some Latin dancing. They had a after paying the cover to the grumpus bouncer, we entered and hit the dance floor. We didn't order any munchies or booze, so this review isn't meant to comment on such items. They had a DJ spinning salsa, Spanish rap and pop. Overall, his music was varied and it kept us moving to the beat. Like most dance clubs, he could have turned the volume down about twenty decibels, but who doesn't like buying hearing aids a few years prematurely? But, I digress.  There was a decent crowd in there on a Friday night, overwhelmingly Hispanic. Everybody was well-dressed and I must say, there were no shortage of beautiful Latina women. Several of the dancers were really talented and it was fun sitting back and taking the occasional break watching them go at it. I was dancing with my friend Jessenia, when I nearly put both of us into a face plant on the dance floor. After a quick spin and lift, my rear foot slid over a huge puddle on the dance floor near the bar. Thankfully, we didn't crash. Unfortunately, the way the bar is designed it opens literally right up on to the dance floor, making spills very dangerous.  When I notified one of the bartenders and asked her for some water for our crew, it appeared that she had a cold. She wiped her nose three times before serving me a glass of water in a plastic cup. I figured I'd chance it and wait until we stopped in at Kingston Mines. Why managers allow bartenders to serve when sick is beyond comprehension. Do you think we won't notice this? Also, if the management reads this review, you need to pay more attention not only to the dance floor, but the floor in the men's room. The entire floor was soaking wet near the toilet, whether from an overflow or leak, I don't know. Traipsing through the men's room back to the dance floor with goodness knows what on your shoes, not cool. Despite these setbacks, our team had lots of fun people watching and dancing. It was right before Halloween, and this huge guy in a solider's uniform came up and started hopping in several of our pictures. We were down with it and they have been uploaded here on Yelp. I really hope that with a little improvement on the part of the details above, this place could be a lot better. At least the people watching and dancing was fun.",0.9921,0.8,0.138,0.061,0.4559616094499815

Plenty of waiters and staff people milling around talking to other customers, to each other... then why did it take a looooong minute to get my food? And the check? I gave them the benefit of the doubt by pulling my wallet out, setting it on the table (this was AFTER all of our plates were cleared and we were just drinking our WATER)... and waiting as staff member after staff member walked by and totally ignored us. Oye. Even after we asked for the check it took forever, and was delivered by a proxy waiter!  Let's start from the beginning. I was excited about my shrimp tacos and my girlfriend had the taco salad with chicken. Something was off about the garlic sauce on my shrimp... couldn't quite put my finger on it. It wasn't too bad once I put some refried beans, guac, and rice on it. The taco salad was pretty bland, but the shell was excellent. The chips and salsa were good too.  The meal was pretty ""eh"" and I wouldn't have crossed this place off my list altogether, if it weren't for the fact that 1) we asked to have the rest of our taco salad wrapped up and that never happened (?????), and 2) the service was insanely slow. While I love my girl's company, I don't really want to sit at an empty table at the end of my meal and drink waters while everyone passes us by.

The nice waitress greeted us and showed us to our seats. The menu was full of good stuff, but I went with the Vegetarian Enchiladas (wasn't in the mood for a lot of meat) and it was pretty damn good. The sauce they use on it (cant remember the name) set it off just right! For my drinking pleasure, I went with a lime margarita on the rocks which is always a good option, so good I had a 2nd.

We decided to break out of our comfort zone, so instead of going to our regular spots we tried Las Fuentes. The funny thing about this is that we literally live one block away and have never tried it! But the patio was beckoning, so we decided to take a chance. While I do enjoy a nice friendly greeting from the restaurant host, there is a fine line between welcoming and a little creepy (he caressed Suca Steve's back while he scanned the patio for a table....wierd). But this is really the only negative thing I have to say about the place.  We sat down and they immediately brought us water. This is important because after a long day in the hot sun, it was very needed. Plus it was 80 degrees in the shade, so they get kudos for being on top of the water sitch. The waiter then immediately suggested margaritas and we immediately ordered them. They came out a few minutes later and were quite good, if not a little on the sweet side. The menu was a little intimidating, full of entrees that I haven't normally seen on a Mexican restaurant menu, but I see that as a positive! It's nice to try new items, and so in keeping in the spirit I shunned my normal enchilada order and tried the fish tacos - SO GOOD! I ate all 3 (much to my stomach's chagrin) and even had a bite of Scuba Steve's meat entree (it's the very first one on the menu...really good!).

2010-05-17,4.0,"Not quite as exciting as the one in Stickney ( yelp.com/biz/las-fuentes… ), but still quite excellent.  First and foremost, Las Fuentes salsa (complimentary) is insanely delicious, to the point of being dangerously addictive.  It has the most perfect and impossible-to-achieve cilantro-scallion-jalapeno-tomato-salt-mystery ingredient ratio I've ever experienced.  The chips are excellent as well--warm and crispy--and the guacamole (which isn't complimentary) also deserves a special shout-out. Another essential feature of any Mexican restaurant worth its salt is the margarita, and Fuentes' margaritas are delicious and strong (unfortunately not quite as affordable as the margaritas at Las Fuentes Stickney).   Their menu has a good variety of staple Mexican dishes and some slightly more adventurous excursions.  In particular, the selection of vegetarian options goes way above and beyond the typical ""veggie burrito"".  Their Oaxacan tamales are amazing, and my favorite veggie dish is the Enchiladas Vegetarianas, which are topped with a delicious tomatillo sauce, fresh dark greens, and a light sprinkle of an exquisite crumbly Mexican cheese (don't know the name, unfortunately).  Inside the enchiladas are woodland mushrooms and other vegetables that are cooked to perfection.  Also noteworthy are the Taquiza de Pescado plate (fish tacos that may just be on the verge of surpassing the Enchiladas Vegetarianas in my book), the Verduras Motulenas (see my review of the Stickney location), the Sopes Surtidos appetizer, the Chapulines (Oaxacan fried grasshopper!) appetizer, and their Tilapia dishes (served with perfectly cooked vegetables and either a tomatillo or poblano sauce).  I hear that their meat dishes are great as well, but can't attest as I only do vegetarian and fish. The service is always super friendly and attentive; our salsa bowl and chip basket are never empty.  My only complaint about the atmosphere is that inside they have about 4 giant screen TVs with sports on all the time.  Not a good choice, but understandable I guess, given the neighborhood it's in. Fortunately, this can be avoided in the warmer months by going out to their amazing patio!  It's a lovely place; there's a giant tree that makes it feel nice and secluded, and its fountains, murals, ceramics and flowers create a wonderful atmosphere that is easy to linger in (over margaritas and the never-ending flow of chips and salsa) for hours on end.",0.9991,0.707,0.272,0.021,0.6838948787061995

Which is a lava bowl used to grind spices or mix and serve salsa and avocado dips.  The bowl comes in a variety of sizes I'm learning.  I had this dish I've never heard of before in Saginaw, Michigan (very) recently at Los Quatros Amigos.  The cost was minute, somewhere around $12.95 and the lava bowl was huge, the portion was a dinner entrée and enough to satisfy the appetites of two men over the course of two hours.  The bowl is made of lava rock and is heated to a boiling temperature, the contents are kept piping hot and you can see the gravy bubbling.  Within the gravy is an assortment of meats including ground beef, chorizo, chicken breasts and steak meat.  Also containing sometimes cheese, green onions or cactus leaves and is served with flour or corn tortillas.   So this is why I came to Tepatulco, for their version of the Molcajete dish.  Their version was a much smaller bowl for an extremely higher price, mentioned as a dinner entrée it cost around $18.95 with enough to feed one.  It was okay and an extravagance I won't soon be back for.  I was there on a Friday night with a group of people, the place was dead and the service was so happy to see us walk in.  Service was horrid, inattentive, forgetful and lacking.  Being that we walked in near closing time we put in the order for the molcajete early on, there was some confusion with the waiter who clearly did not speak English as a first language and got uppity when we asked for an ETA.  (I'm not bitching about English speaking, but damn, get the F'ing order correct) Forty minutes into the dining experience asked again about it and he exclaims that we didn't order it.  You can't even make up this kind of idiocy.  Appetizers were out fairly quickly and I must recommend the mushroom and chicken tamales, might be named Tamales Uchepos.  The tamales were cooked properly and came with this green minty tasting topping that reminds me of an Indian chutney which is typically served with Idli's.  If it had some spice it would have been perfect.  Of the other entrees I sampled from friends, everything was good.  The only foul tastes were from the service and the cost.  We drank margaritas by the pitcher which ran at $25 each and the booze was light.  I could see going back for sampling different entrees, the fried grasshoppers, a pina colada and their desserts.  I can't believe I missed the tres leches.   Next door through a wooden door we could hear some extremely loud bass pumping music which we were told was from the club next door.  Not Kingston Mines, access is not available through the restaurant, but, people kept coming and going through this doorway.  Outside there is another entrance.  We caught our elderly server shaking his head and hips to the beats.  If only he paid more attention to serving.",0.9477,0.915,0.059,0.027,0.48219696969696985

The apps didn't come for some time-- considering guac and queso is really hard to prepare. (Sense my sarcasm?) We didn't see them until 45 minutes later. During that time our waiter didn't check on us once. We caught a couple bus boys who were able to refill our waters and refill us on chips/salsa.

His plate arrived with 5 prawns (if not run-of-the-mill shrimp), mine with a mess of meat and gravy-style ""red sauce"", and we salt in balmy conditions and watched the cooks hang out... but nonetheless the bill was close to $60.   I'm annoyed.  Check my review on the place (across the street) that I went to next to satisfy my craving... or so I thought.",0.234,0.822,0.089,0.089,0.5565476190476191
2007-05-25,3.0,"This was a nice, average Mexican food experience.  I ordered a dish that was too spicy for my taste, but that was definitely my own fault.  My dinner companions both got the enchiladas and they felt that they were ok.  The margaritas were tasty - though they only have two flavors: regular or passion fruit.  I had the passion fruit, and it tasted like fruit juice but definitely had some tequila kick to it.  Overall, I recommend Tepatulco for a good Mexican dinner, though it probably won't blow you away.",0.979,0.684,0.283,0.033,0.4615384615384615
2007-05-05,2.0,"I should have read the reviews prior to taking a date to Tepatulco.  I thought the menu was very limited (only two chicken dishes, starting at $13.95), but quite good.  The prices were extremely high in my opinion, but then again, I guess this place is ""upscale"" Mexican.  I should have noticed by the white tablecloths when I walked in. The passionfruit margaritas (though $8/pop) were very good although they would not put sugar on the glass instead of salt.  They refused to make strawberry margaritas for us. Again, the food was good, but the selection was extremely limited and expensive.",0.8263,0.816,0.118,0.066,0.4306593406593407
2007-04-09,5.0,"This was excellent high-end authentic Mexican food. The house margaritas were the best we've ever had.  For appetizers, we had the tostaditas de ceviche and corn boats with a variety of fillings. For dinner, chicken enchiladas and ""molcajete surtido,"" a huge bowl filled with meat, cheese, cactus & sauce (very hard to describe, and excellent).  For dessert a chocolate lava cake which isn't very Mexican but we loved it. I'm already wanting to go back... this isn't tacos and burritos, it's the real stuff. Try it.",0.8945,0.854,0.133,0.013,0.5849358974358974
2007-04-02,3.0,"OK, I walked in here with very high expectations. I had read enough reviews on  metromix.com , Chicago mag and had a personal recommendation from the owner of Sol De Mexico.  So the decor wasn't so great it kinda of reminded me of Lazo's on Western. Very spacious but with no separation. It use to be an old club and that's exactly the vibe I got when I walked in.   OK so we ordered the guacamole with chips..........ummm, if we got a small size scoop that was a lot for their standards I guess??!!  My brother got the baby lamb rack in Mole sauce, it was OK , but just a weird combination. I had the molcajete Surtido which was once again just OK. I've had that dish at La Palms and it was much better.  I was sadly disappointed. I was expecting this fabulous dinner and I walked out thinking that I'm probably not coming back!! :( On a side note: The service was great!!",0.8616,0.729,0.158,0.112,0.5201
2007-03-10,4.0,"Holy crap this place is so good I want to punch someone. I am a fan of cheap taquerias and don't usually go for upscale mexican, but this place is worth the price, since it puts a fresh spin on the usual mexican fare, and it's got the kind of snazzy decor that will impress your parents/date/business associates. I had a passionfruit margarita (actually I had three of them) and they were uniformly excellent, with real fruit juices. I highly recommend them to those who may  normally steer clear of margaritas and similar nasty mixed drinks. The ceviche appetizer is delicious. There's some other appetizer that has grasshoppers. Like real grasshoppers. I stayed away from it but if I have another three margarita evening I may give it a try. The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because I am all about having chips and salsa with my meal, I don't care how upscale you are.",0.9743,0.744,0.198,0.058,0.4955797101449275
2006-02-02,4.0,"I discovered Las Fuentes a few years ago and it has become my favorite restaurant for Mexican food/margaritas in the summer.  It seems a bit sketchy when you first walk in, but their outdoor patio is very inviting in the summer.  I enjoy the authentic Mexican food, potent margaritas, and it's always fun to watch a cubs game on their big screen TV.  I've never visited Las Fuentes in the winter, but get the feeling that it's a better option for summer.",0.9625,0.78,0.22,0.0,0.36025641025641025
