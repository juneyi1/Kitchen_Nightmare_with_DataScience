2013-01-16,3.0,"Came here with some coworkers before the holiday when we couldn't get into RL which had a wait.  C-house was pretty empty when we walked in at 12:00 with only one other table that was finishing up. The place was classy, bright and quiet. However, we had hoped for a more festive and livlier atmosphere since it was right before Christmas afterall. The service was good and the server was very friendly. The menu was pretty limited but it helped to speed up the ordering process since we didn't have many choices! We all got the 123 lunch combo. i chose the pear and goat cheese salad which was pretty good. perfect portion for a lunch side. Two coworkers ordered the pumpkin soup which they said had a real unexpected heat kick to it. Almost all of us ordered the lobster roll, but we were told that we would not be able to get it in a ""roll"" form. We could, however, pick a different type of bread. So lobster sandwich it is. We all asked to have our white breads toasted which worked out well since our sandwich would've become quite soggy if left untoasted. There were large chucky lobster pieces and taste was very enjoyable although i would've liked it with a bit more seasoning. The truffle fries were very addictive and i would definitely order again. The ""candy bar' dessert which i picked out consisted of 3 small dark chocolate raspberry(?) pieces. It was good but not memorable. Overall ok. Think a livlier atmosphere would've made the meal more interesting.",0.9929,0.799,0.183,0.018,0.5991798941798941

We got a load of appetizers: (below are the ones I remembered) Roasted Bone Marrow- Pretty tasty- it's hard to do marrow wrong (unless you burn it). (3.5) Roasted squid with chorizo and pork rinds- Way too salty. (2.75) Bite sized fish tacos- refreshing, good contrast of textures (soft slightly slimy yellowtail fish vs. crisp corn tortilla shell), light in flavor (3.5) Pork belly- A bit on the dry/overcooked side- it's hard to make pork belly bad because it's so tender/fatty, but I don't know, these guys managed to make it mediocre. (2.75) Entree: Grilled NY Strip on a bed of mushrooms topped with braised veggies of some sort- This was decent. But just decent. The meat was cooked properly, (medium- pink inside) but the meat itself was not tender. Granted its not as easy to make tender steak with NY strip (which is meatier by nature compared to other fattier cuts), but this was just ok. (3.25) As a side, I got the apple and eggplant ratatouille with goat cheese- it sounded like an interesting combination- it turned out just to be ok. The eggplant was undercooked, and didn't serve as a good texture contrast with the apple and the goat cheese. The goat cheese really didn't meld with the veggies/fruits for some reason. Sigh.

Everything on the menu sounded delicious, but my friend and I decided to split the mozzarella and sundried tomato flatbread and yellowtail mini tacos. The flavor profiles were amazing; very bright and fresh. The flatbread came with a salad on top and it tasted like it was picked fresh from the garden moments before. The yellowtail was ceviched and exploded with flavor.  The main reason we decided to share appeitzers is to totally justify hitting the desserts hard. The have a candy bar, which includes a variety of confections made in house. If you check in on Foursquare, you get a free sample of three items from the candy bar. We did and had a toasted marshmallow, milk chocolate caramel (which had a little bit of salf on top) and dark chocolate hazelnut. Each one was delicious.  They also have cake and pie-type desserts but we both gravitated to the homemade ice creams. Three scoops for $8 is a deal and they were served on a bed of chocolate cake crumbles. The ice cream was creamy and the flavor was really strong. The roof is small but cozy. Be aware it has a different menu than the main floor restaurant. Either way, definitely give it a try.",0.9941,0.794,0.2,0.007,0.5814393939393939

Unfortunately our only knock on the restaurant and their upstairs bar C-view was their cocktails - Each cocktail costs between $12-$15 which is fine if like many upscale restaurants they give you your monies worth unfortunately here it felt like we paid $15  a drink that maybe had 1-2 oz of liquor in each of them.

2012-05-28,4.0,"Went for dinner last night with my boyfriend. I have been wanting to try it because I love Marcus Samuelsson. It was a Sunday night and fairly late (8:15pm) for a reservation, but I was pretty surprised by how dead it was. I'm not sure if it was because of the Memorial Day Weekend holiday, but the surrounding pizza joints were packed. Anyway, we started out with a dozen oysters. I actually didn't see the menu of the oysters when we ordered them, so they just picked some out for us. I actually know oysters fairly well, so I kind of wish I'd seen the list or that the server had told me there was a menu. But, no worries. We also started with the octopus (amazing!) and the pickled herring. The herring really needed some other element to cut the acidity (the menu said sour cream, but there wasn't any on our plate. Not sure if they changed the preparation and not the menu?) but otherwise everything was delicious. The octopus had a really nice texture. For entrees, my boyfriend got the pork chop (amazing!) and I had the Flat Iron steak (also amazing!). We normally don't take leftovers home but we definitely wanted dessert and there was no way I was leaving any morsel of that food behind. We shared asparagus (the sauce is pretty acidic but great without) and the red potatoes.  For dessert, my boyfriend had the fried pecan pie with peach ice cream (yummm) and I had the cream cheese pot de creme (also yummy, but I kind of wish I'd gotten the cheese plate). Our server was a little shy. Maybe she was more shy than usual because some old guy at this 6-top close to us kept talking loudly about some ""over-salted pork chop"". My boyfriend had it and it was delicious. The guy / party was kind of rude about it. They kept talking about it loudly and it was not a big deal. They replaced it with something else and that should have been the end of it, but as a server I know how something like that can get you down. When we asked her questions though, she knew her stuff.

2012-05-16,3.0,"So after being super impressed with all the televised creations and peer reviews of Marcus Samuelsson, I thought this was going to be out of this world.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  Starting off, the ambiance is pretty cool but nothing original or too exciting.  It was a Wednesday when I was there and really dead.  Granted, it was a Wednesday but still.  Our server was very flighty and told us it was her last day there (as though she was happy about it).  That's just odd to say to customers.  Her service was still good, but like I said, it was dead. Definite points for having a solid Torrontes by the glass on the menu.  The two girls I was with got a savory cocktail (tried to look up the name but the cocktail and wine list as labeled on the website is really just a wine list) that sounded really good but neither one of them liked it so they ended up doing Torrontes after.  We started with the fish tacos, which I think are overrated.  I'm actually surprised that so many people rave about them cause they had sort of a cardboard taste to the shell and I found the fish to be rather bland.  However huge redemption with the sweetbreads.  They are perfectly prepared and served with some citrus on the plate that cuts through the fattiness of the sweetbreads beautifully.  I'd go back just for those.  For my entree I got the venison.  While it was good, it wasn't great.  They recommended medium rare, which I of course agreed to but it was medium.  Nevertheless, it was tasty.  Again, it's Samuelsson so I'm expecting to be blown away and just was not.  Would I go back?  Probably, but would hope for a better experience next time.",0.9941,0.706,0.219,0.075,0.5520833333333333
2012-05-14,5.0,"My girlfriend and I decided a great dinner out was in order yesterday to mark both my graduating with my M.Div., and our four month anniversary.  We settled on C-House, and it was an EXCELLENT decision all around.  Things to commend: PARKING: Reasonably priced valet parking with super friendly attendants. For $13 plus tip, definitely worth it since CTA would've been almost $10 and involved lots of walking and waiting. SERVICE: Our server was appropriately friendly, but not cloying, and VERY knowledgeable of the menu and wine pairings.  Service was prompt, but she also gave us plenty of space to enjoy our meal together. AMBIENCE: Way chill.  It was a Sunday night, so the place wasn't super crowded.  Good noise level, tasteful decor...and we even got seated at one of the tables along the wall, complete with cushioned bench and pillows...very nice for a little light cuddling between courses! FOOD: Definitely did not disappoint.  I had the crispy sweetbreads; they were nice and crisp on the outside, and had a delightfully smooth texture on the inside.  The olives on the plate were a little TOO much for the dish, but the dried lemon slices and the sliced citrus were great counterbalance to the richness of the sweetbreads.  My querida had the apple and mustard green salad; she really enjoyed it.  For main courses, we had the arctic char and the apple glazed pork chop; my char was PERFECTLY cooked, and nicely balanced by the sauce underneath and the sliced citrus, and the crispy polenta was a nice starch.  The pork chop was also cooked to perfection (and I used to live in Iowa, so I KNOW pork), and even my querida, who doesn't usually like sauerkraut loved the red cabbage kraut and potato dumplings it came with.  We split the chocolate mousse came with the peanut butter parfait; every bit as rich and wonderful as it sounds. All in all, this was an EXCELLENT night out.  Definitely falls into the ""sometimes restaurant"" category due to the price (all costs included, with parking, came out around $190...my conscience trembles to think of how many people in Niger that could have fed), but a delightful place for a big, but relaxed, meal out with someone you love.",0.999,0.718,0.263,0.018,0.5815891472868218

We started out okay with oysters and had no issues.  Then came a asparagus soup that was not only watery, but completely lacked any flavor at all. I struggled ordering an entree and went with stuffed quail special with a fava bean puree (i think) and some concoction with corn bread/meal. Te quail was cooked well but was a little over stuffed.

Maybe dinner is a better time to go because brunch didn't feel special. Both my husband and I really felt like it wasn't any more interesting than any other hotel restaurant.

2012-02-27,2.0,"Last Saturday, I rolled into C-House with a birthday party of 15 during Restaurant week. I was ready for all hell to break loose, but the wait staff was more than accommodating with our growing party number and were able to set aside the communal table just for us. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension, warm, and comfortable, but not too quiet that our large party felt disruptive. I was also thrilled that the restaurant week menu was just $33. My recommendations are fairly limited after ""nice atmosphere"" and ""accommodating wait staff."" The $33 prix fixe doesn't factor in the exorbitantly priced drinks at $13 per modestly-sized cocktail. The cocktails were all very tasty, but one didn't last through dinner. Additionally, the restaurant week portions were also on the smaller side and left the table searching for sides dishes. I had the Baby Lettuce Salad which was surprising absent of much lettuce and was mainly comprised of radishes. It was an interesting dish with the bitterness of the radishes paired with the cheese and egg, but I don't think I would order again. Others ordered the Winter Squash Soup and seemed more pleased with their choice. My main course, the Braised Beef Short Ribs, was tasty but did not meet the caliber that I was expecting. The Braised beef was actually paired with slices of filet. Even though I ordered rare, the meet was quite tough. Similarly, the Pan-seared Trout Filet entree was good, but no one was raving about it. The best part of the meal was the Dark Chocolate Torte accompanied by dark cherries, two pretzel sticks, and a scoop of mascarpone ice cream. The cake was just a sliver, but very moist and velvety and paired nicely with the salty-sweet tastes of the other ingredients. The average per person bill was over $60 (mine was much more), and we left scratching our heads to figure out what exactly we paid for. Perhaps, C-house made a strategic error with the Restaurant week menu, but I don't think that I will be going back.",0.9876,0.792,0.146,0.062,0.4453006343250246
2012-02-12,2.0,"Went here based on recommendation from someone with good taste, but was dissapointed with basically every aspect of the meal.  (maybe its been a while since they visited) The recommended fish tacos were sold out, so can't comment on that. I would summarize by saying that everything was ""good"" for the fact the preparation was slightly out of the ordinary, but nothing was ""delicious"" or made you want to go back for more, and not worth the price of entry.  Started with drinks at the bar since we had to wait 30 minutes after our reservation time for table (whatever).  The buster brown was too sweet; would've been better off with something basic. My girlfriend had a glass of wine.  Oysters were good, but as long as they are fresh, you can't do much to mess those up. Sweetbreads were ok. The combination of smoked buttermilk, pistachio and citrus grew on me but wasn't something I would return for.  We ordered the venison and scallops for mains. The venison was overcooked and the whole dish was lacking something. The scallop dish was much better. The combination of creamy celeriac purée, grapes, celery and farro was good, if not a little sweet for my taste and on the heavy side (almost reminded me of my favorite dessert at Purple Pig with ricotta and farro) For dessert we ordered chocolate torte. It wasn't great.  The mascarpone ice cream wasn't good (not smooth and creamy) and the cold/room temp sliver of torte was just ok. The two cherries on the plate were the best part, and they could've been from a jar.  Don't bother with the foursquare dessert, it's a couple marshmallows, three pieces of not great peanut butter fudge and a mini vanilla cupcake that would've tasted better if made from a store-bought mix.  Service, like everything else, was just ok. Our waiter was pleasant, but a little aloof (empty cocktail and wine glasses not removed from table, etc) If half stars were an option, I would've gone a little higher. I would say this is average at best for this class of restaurant.

I like seafood but I don't like sushi - however, these were excellent (and, essentially, sushi). They were 8 small bites, perfect to share, and the freeze dried corn was a fun touch. I ordered the grilled porkchop. It was very good - pomegranate, brussels sprouts, panchetta - delicious. My husband enjoyed his sturgeon, also. For dessert, we got our free candy bar trio (the dessert menu at C-House is awesome) - by checking in on Facebook, you get one of these free. The waitress didn't seem to know what I was talking about, so I had to show her on my phone. Shouldn't she have known about that? Also, she was a little more aloof and withdrawn than she could have been, didn't come check on us as much as she could have considering how few people were there - she was not very smiley or friendly, but certainly adequate. Our candy bar trio included the vanilla bean cupcake - very dry - and the peanut butter fudge - really good - as well as the sweet potato whoopie pie. I was a little apprehensive about this, but it was great - had a spice taste, a little bit more pumpkin than sweet potato to me. We also ordered the gelato trio, since the choices were so good - we had the apple spice sorbet (great texture, would be great for a vegan as it was quite creamy), brown butter gelato, and creme fraiche gelato. The creme fraiche tasted like sour cream. The brown butter was tasty. I'd give this place 5 stars if the waitress was more attentive and knowledgeable.

However, the main course was a huge let-down: I ordered the duck breast, which was underdone (almost blue), chewy, and tasteless. The sides were good but it didn't make up for the duck disappointment. My husband ordered the prime rib which was cut as thin as bologne. Again, his sides were good but not enough to make up for everything.

We started with the Sweetbreads, which were fantastic! I had the Sturgeon for my entree and my friend had the NY steak and beef shank. Although my sturgeon was done very well and was delicious, the steak was atrocious. It was pre-sliced (which often sn't a problem), but it was bone dry and overcooked. It was hard to cut and my friend barely choked it down even though we were starving. We got the mac and cheese and the roasted cauliflower as sides and they were both delicious. I'm usually not one to say anything, but I mentioned something to the server about the steak and she was quick to apologize.  After pondering between the Beignets and a trio of Gelato for dessert, we decided on the Beignets and a vanilla cupcake. To our surprise our server brought out a complimentary trio of Gelato (probably because of the steak issue). The brown butter gelato was absolutely sublime. It was amazing and I definitely recommend it to anyone.  Overall the experience was decent...but the steak tainted the experience. For a place that promotes itself as a seafood and chops destination..the latter falls short.",0.9958,0.688,0.263,0.049,0.5892222222222223
2011-12-25,2.0,"A 2-star Yelp review means ""Meh. I've experienced better."" That's how I would describe my experience at C-House. The service, ambiance, decor, etc, were very nice. I liked how it was quiet and bright as opposed to dark and noisy.  I wanted to go somewhere nice for Christmas dinner. I thought good food was pretty much a given at a moderately fancy place (which we don't go to a lot). I wasn't much impressed with the food though. We went on Christmas evening so there was a prix-fixe menu. For a starter I got a ""oyster stew"" which looked like vomit, but was tasty so it was okay but there was way too much broth and exactly two pieces of oyster.  For entree I got the goose dish with cranberry sauce, stuffing and brussels sprouts. The stuffing was really good but there was this sauce all over the plate that just..forgive me.. it just looked like poo, and it didn't taste good enough to make up for it. In fact it had this weird mustard taste that I couldn't really identify, which somehow made the overall effect even worse (I don't like mustard in the first place). And it was all over everything, I couldn't get away from it. Ugh. I didn't say anything to the waitress because I couldn't think of a polite way to describe the problem. I can't say I enjoyed that meal. My husband's dish wasn't that much better in my opinion (we traded plates after I decided I was done wtih mine), it was a prime rib dish that tasted overwhelmingly like cocktail sauce. He says he liked it and his herring starter and the dessert.  Anyway I came away full anyway and was mostly going for the ambiance so in that regard it was fine, but I doubt I'd go there again.",0.8718,0.789,0.124,0.087,0.5989247311827957

2011-11-22,3.0,"Tough one trying to decide the rating.  Once again, I'll rail against the one flaw with Yelp.......no 1/2 stars!!  I don't feel like this meal deserves 3, but based on a few major mistakes, it's impossible to give it 4. First of all, it's a very cool spot in general.  I like the layout of the space, the decor, the vibe, I liked it all.  Second of all, the service was really great.  Our server was all over it, had good recommendations, and went out of his way to correct some issues. The table started with some shared apps.  The mini-yellowtail tacos are a must try.  They were delicious.  The crispy sweetbreads were good, but I am not a huge fan of deep frying sweetbreads.  When prepared properly, they stand on their own, and frying them really takes away from their flavor overall.  That said, they were still good.  And finally there was an apple salad that was fantastic.  The Gouda and mustard greens that accompany it, which sound like they would never work together, were actually perfect together.  Very nice start overall. To the entrees.  The ladies ordered the scallops based on the servers recommendation, and it was really excellent.  Served with grapes, braised celery (very interesting) and toasted farro, along with a very nice roasted salsify, it was spot-on.  Loved it. My brother-in-law though and I did not fare so well.  His steak and beef shank, was just...underwhelming.  It wasn't bad I guess, but was not great.  And my dish, boy what a disaster.  I ordered the pasta and braised baby octopus.  The octopus was great, but the pasta was just a mess.  It was so overcooked, that it was literally hard as a rock.  I was tapping it with my fork and you could literally hear it, like I was hitting a piece of wood.  I called the server over, who was immediately on having them fix it (he also took it off the bill, and brought us another round of Patron shots on the house).  Even after fixing it however, it just wasn't great. So overall, some excellent dishes, and few not so great dishes.  It was however a very enjoyable experience, and once I hit about 50 more places I need to try in Chicago, I would maybe give it another shot.",0.9982,0.708,0.228,0.063,0.6040697674418605

We started off with two appetizers. The mini yellowfin tuna fish tacos w/freeze dried corn were excellent. Gone in two bites and very refreshing. We also had probably the complete opposite of that with the sweetbreads. These smooth, buttery pieces were excellent and the kale they were served with was awesome. For my main dish I ordered the hand cut pasta and octopus. The pasta was perfectly cooked and so was the octopus. I don't think I've ever had octopus so tender before. I also had samples of the others dishes. My wife ordered the scallops which were 1) HUGE, and 2) very flavorful. My mother ordered the sturgeon which I felt was very refreshing and reminded me of my trip to Sweden. My father ordered the venison which was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. We also ordered a side of the mac and cheese to share which was insane how good it was. When the dessert menu came I was blown away. So many selections and they all looked so great. It's rare you see such a diverse dessert menu from a quality restaurant. I did The Candy Bar and had the peanut butter fudge (excellent), the toasted marshmallows (very good), the Rollos (outstanding), the sweet potato whoopie pie (amazing), and the vanilla bean cupcake (bland). I also had bites of the ginger bread dish which I thought was ok, pretty dry. And the pumpkin beignets which were good but a little too much sugar for me.

2011-11-12,3.0,I was just there for brunch today so I can't tell what the dinner service is like. But  I found that the brunch food was relatively well priced and delicious. The server was really nice but seemed to disappear for long periods of time even when though the place is pretty empty during Saturday brunch. The menu is smaller than the 'popular' brunch spots like Yolk and Eleventh City Diner etc but the food was well put together and quite flavorful. We did this family style by ordering a bunch of items between the 5 adults and a hungry baby (my brother's 1 yr old baby Cami). Between the 5.5 of us we had: Brioche French Toast - I found this to be delicious. Almost the same level of taste as Bongo Room but not nearly as extravagant. It was also Cami's favorite item it seemed as she kept asking for 'mo' (baby sized 'more' apparently). Pan Seared Whitefish - This was my friend's order and it was my personal favorite. The outside of the fish was nice and crispy (pan-fried) and the inside was moist and tender.  I don't know what Cami thought of it cause I was heads down eating mine with no intention of sharing with her. Lobster Club - This was my order and I have to admit I was hoping for a lobster roll but this sandwich was well flavored and made me forget that I wanted a lobster roll. Angus Prime Burger - My brother ordered this as he thinks anything with vegetables is a four letter word. To his credit though it was actually a pretty flavorful burger. But who orders a burger for brunch? Seriously? SMH Mac and Cheese - Ok this is not on the brunch menu but I'm really glad that we got it. Baby Cami also gave it her 'mo' seal of approval. For what we had (again just rated on the brunch menu) I give Chef Samuelsson 2 thumbs up and I believe Baby Cami would too once she figures out how to work her thumbs. I docked a star for the service which makes me feel a bit guilty cause she was really nice when she was actually paying attention to us. But you can't expect to let my coffee get empty in the morning for as long as it did at times without taking some of my wrath.,0.9943,0.788,0.162,0.05,0.5893518518518519

2011-11-03,2.0,"I didn't know what to expect when I went to C-House, and in the end I was a little underwhelmed.   First of all, being an avid watcher of Top Chef & Iron Chef, I was never a big fan of Marcus Samuelsson.  That being said, after I realized C-House was his restaurant, I figured we'd give it a try.   We started off by ordering wine.  A friend of ours is very knowledgeable about wine and immediately asked for new wine glasses.  We ordered a decent bottle of wine, it cost $50+.  I know it is no super fancy bottle of wine, but take the fact that we asked for nicer glasses and we ordered a decent bottle of wine, I think they could have spared their fine wine glasses on us.  Instead, they brought us glasses that were a little better, but after looking around the dining room, it quickly became apparent they still didn't bring us their finer glasses.  Anyway, I found this annoying. We ordered 4 sides - the potato puree, cauliflower, brussels sprout, and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was very good, but let's be honest, it's not that difficult to make.  The potato puree was salty, the cauliflower was pretty good, but I was distracted at how the pieces were all different sizes.  The brussels sprouts were good as well, but also distractingly unevenly sized.  When I think about it, all the sides tasted the same.  Mostly salt, and few other distinguishing flavors.  I ordered the handcut pasta and octopus as my main entree.  I was extremely disappointed.  The pasta was hard and dry and I felt like I was eating strips of flour.  The sauce was once again overly salty.  The octopus was tender but there was very little of it.  I was very underwhelmed.  My boyfriend had the trout which he said was good but nothing really special.   The more time passes, the more I am disappointed by my meal at C-House and the feelings I had while watching Marcus Samuelsson's season of Top Chef Masters is justified.  I didn't think he deserved to win, and his restaurant is evidence of that.",0.9871,0.773,0.157,0.07,0.5503406514120799

For our main courses my date had the pork chop and I had the pan-seared halibut.  I enjoyed the fish and the preserved lemon pearl barley; there were in total too many carrots in this dish otherwise.  It looks like I missed out on the other reviewer's delicious peas.  Still, if you like carrots, this dish has them.  My date said the pork chop was good.

Entree - I had the Pan Seared Halibut with risotto, english peas and morels. The fish was cooked perfectly with just enough sear on the edges. The peas were literally the best peas I've ever eaten (though probably because I've never had fresh peas before!). There was an interesting mix between whole peas and puree for a variety of texture alongside the more delicate fish. The one thing I regret is that the morels were chopped up so finely you couldn't appreciate their true meaty texture. But the dish overall was fabulous. The person I came with ordered the hanger steak medium rare and it looked cooked to perfection. Side - We went with the mac and cheese, and while this is becoming quite the overdone fad (who could make BAD mac and cheese?!?) this mac and cheese really was delicious.

When the Chicagoist featured C-House's fabulous lunch deal, the 123, I checked out the menu and knew where the next birthday lunch group would meet.  C-House, located in the Affina Hotel, is just far enough off the craziness that is Michigan Avenue to have a nice, relaxing meal. The interior is very earthy, clean and simple - wood seems to be a common theme throughout the restaurant.  We started out with an order of the mini yellowtail tacos. Served with pickled onion, avocado and cabbage, my companions liked them quite a bit, but I found them to be mediocre. The yellowtail portion per taco seemed skimpy and overpowered by the avocado and mini shell.  The 123 deal allows you to pick any one soup or salad appetizer, any one sandwich, and any one candy bar dessert for $15. All of the items are served at once on a wood plank. The deal allows you to try a nice cross-section of the lunch meal, so all six of us ordered it.  Picking out my starter and dessert were easy, the sandwich was where I struggled. I went with the potato cheddar soup - the only soup option. The soup was good, the fried cheese curds are what really made it. I passed up the salmon burger and hot smoked salmon for the tuna melt. The sandwich was served open-face on a thick, buttery slice of multigrain bread with greens on top. The sandwich portion was good albeit messy, I think it would've worked better with the greens under the tuna. All sandwiches also come with fries and homemade ketchup. I didn't try any of the other sandwiches at the table, but I heard no complaints. For my dessert, I opted for the dark chocolate with orange and black tea ""candy bar."" My candy bar was three little truffles - quite delicious, just not what I expected based on the name. Candy bar is a bit of a misnomer;none of the candy bar items ordered looked like actual candy bars, one even resembled a whoopie pie. However, since we're talking about tasty, unique, creative candy, I didn't care about being surprised by the presentation. Overall the food was quite good. Unfortunately, the general consensus was that service was friendly, but slow.  Bottom line: For $15 this lunch deal is hard to beat. The food is solid and the portions are generous. I wavered between 3.5 and 4 stars, but decided to round up despite the service that was a little too unobtrusive.",0.9897,0.818,0.132,0.049,0.5899080086580086

They have a relatively reasonable lunch menu for the business crowd and the portions were more than sufficient. I was grateful that the wait staff was willing to let us have a leisurely lunch (2 hours) to give us adequate time to catch up. I ordered a sliced apple salad, salmon burger, and fennel brittle (the 1-2-3 special) and had a coffee to fuel the brain. The fennel brittle was excellent. The salmon burger was pretty good. I think I have had better coffee at gas stations and I was bummed to discover that the apple salad surprisingly resembled the chopped salad's description (mixup in the kitchen?).  For the swankiness of the decor, the location and the menu, I expected to be in for a West Loop-like lunch. That was simply not the case. I might go back to C-House, but I think I will look for other options before I go back to C-House.",0.8555,0.919,0.081,0.0,0.4929315476190476
2011-03-27,2.0,"Came to C-House during Chef's Week...unintentionally. I have been wanting to come for a while and it just so happened that this was the week we were free to do so, so we met another couple here on Saturday evening. Restaurant itself seemed nice enough upon first entering.  Clean, modern...what you'd expect. Turns out, most of the people at the table were going to order what was on the Chef's Week menu anyway, so that's the way we went.  The food was OK.  Nothing amazing and nothing bad, the house pickled herring was pretty darn good, my friends were less than impressed with the soup, my salad was perfectly fine (but you don't need to be a Top Chef Master to make a decent mixed greens salad). The entrée course was good.  Worthy of returning for? Not so much, but it wasn't (executionally) a let down.  What was a let down was the service.  I'm not sure if this is a case of the wait staff being bored with Chef's Week or what, but we felt the pacing of everything throughout the evening was a little sparse, culminating in almost being ignored towards the end of the meal.  I'm all about giving tables a little space, but there were multiple opportunities for the waiter to stop by and ask if anyone wanted a coffee, or an after dinner drink, that went unnoticed.  The sommelier seemed to be on his game, but unfortunately, our waiter was not.  That led all of us at the table to feel that there was really no need to return. Rating probably would have gone to a three for the food alone, but their service seems to be happy taking in whatever captive audience hotel guests are thrown over from Affina vs. keeping the local folks happy and coming back for more. I expected more from Marcus, i expected more from the menu, and I certainly expected  more from the wait staff.  Chicago is too big with too many inventive chefs doing wonderful things to come back, let alone wait staff that make you feel like they actually care that you're in their restaurant.  Sorry Marcus, but you're restaurant doesn't match your reputation.",0.9843,0.796,0.146,0.058,0.5489999999999999

I'm a fan of Marcus Sammueson from Top Chef Masters, and I have also cooked a few recipes from his cookbook.  Let me just say that the recipes in the cookbook taste better than the restaurant. I was expecting bold, mind blowing flavors, interesting combinations, and really well thought-out food. What I got was some ok hotel restaurant food (This restaurant is inside of the Affinia Hotel). Disappointing.  The potato soup with cheese curds had an off note. The cheese curds were awesome, though! I also had the fish that was on the menu - I believe that it was the Sea Bass, and I also tasted a ravioli dish. Eh...I really could cook something tastier.

C House I probably would not normally have tried but it was close to where I was staying so I didn't have to walk too far in the cold.  the first impression was that i was surprised at how much smaller it was inside than I had envisioned. The bar area is cozy, the bar stools are different and comfortable. After the hostess took our coats, we sat at the bar and had a drink. Two martinis were $28, not astronomical.  We were then seated. There are only a few tables in the middle, the rest were along the side with a huge bunch with pillows. Usually this turns me off since I tend to get swallowed up in uncomfortable pillows, but it was OK.  We each had a Restaurant Week item. I had potato soup (very thin, not chunky), squash ravioli (very good), and pecan cake with delicious cappuccino ice cream. Just enough for $33.  We split a bottle of red wine. The wine list is pretty good with it leaning towards ""old world wines"" than typical US wines.  Service was very attentive. Every table was engaged in conversation but it wasn't extremely loud. It was bright in the dining area, not a din for ambiance. Modern and trendy decor done tastefully. So two Restaurant Week meals, a bottle of wine and gratuity = $128.

2011-02-25,4.0,"Restaurant Week has rolled around again, and again I'm taking advantage of this deal to try something new.  A bit off the beaten path, maybe, but C-House's proximity to my workplace was one of the factors in choosing it, the other being their vegetarian entree.   Due to my companion's terminal tardiness, I bellied up to the bar and sampled a lovely Manhattan-esque cocktail called the Buster Brown.  Cute name, delicious cocktail, though I have to say that the prices are teeny bit steep when you can get something a bit more fanciful at places like Violet Hour or Maria's.  It's a downtown hotel, though, so what can you do.   After being seated, our server helped me select a single, lovely West Coast oyster and brought us the great house made bread.  We both went with the cheddar potato soup, studded with two perfect cheese curds whose saltiness was a great counterpoint to the soup.  I would order this again, and what do you know, it's on the regular menu.  Excellent. Our entrees, also on the regular menu were equally satisfying.  Boyfriend enjoyed his ravioli with winter squash, and I loved the hangar steak and the creamed kale it rested on.  Perfectly cooked to order, the meat was a tiny bit on the salty side, but let's be frank, I sometimes shake salt into my hand and lick it off.  I'm sick, I will die of high blood pressure (actually mine is fine, believe it or not), it's ok.   Desserts were good, though boyfriend's chocolate cake was a bit too dense in my opinion.  Which is possibly why I went for the ""coconut creamsicle"" which involved coconut custard, citrus, and sorbet.  Very refreshing.   Our server was great and helpful, and I was really happy that the hostesses were fine with the fact that someone (I wonder who?) made us a bit late in getting seated.  They were probably fine with this because I was spending a small fortune at the bar, but what can you do when your date's car won't ""go go Gadget"" over the traffic on the highway?",0.9981,0.725,0.235,0.04,0.6447005935241229

2011-02-20,4.0,"I went to C-house on a Saturday Night for Restaurant Week. First off, let me say that for restaurant week this is one of the better menus I have seen. It was the typical three course menu, however the restaurant week menu had all of the entrees from the regular menu and the portion sizes were definitely not cut. I went with a group of 5 and besides the shiestiness (I think that's a word) with the valet at the hotel, I found the restaurant food and service to be great.   We split the entire restaurant menu between everyone at the table and the highlights were: the Potato and Cheese Soup, the Striped Bass, Brussels spouts with balsamic, and the creamsicle dessert. Again everything on the menu was good, but these were the ones I truly found to stand out. The Cheese soup was a great surprise. It was very creamy and came with fried cheese curds and scallions sprinkled inside. Overall delicious. The next dish was the striped Bass. The bass was cooked perfectly and the side of fingerling potatoes was also nice. I found the mashed potatoes (yes it came with fingerling potatoes and Mashed potatoes) to be a bit salty. Some of the people in my group had the Gulf Grouper , which they found to be a bit salty as well, so it seems that the chef was a little salt happy that night. As a side, we shared the macaroni and cheese and the Brussels sprouts. I was very surprised by the Brussels sprouts. As a kid, I remember dreading Brussels sprouts and swore I would never eat them again. But for some reason, as an adult, I voluntarily paid to try the ones at C-house. I am glad I did. The Brussels seemed simply grilled with some Balsamic Vinegar. The end result was a nice compliment to the fish with its crunchy texture. The mac and cheese was not bad, but kinda wished we tried some of the other sides because it wasn't as flavorful as I would like. For dessert, I tried the Chocolate Pecan Cake and the Creamsicle. For chocolate lovers, I would definitely recommend the Chocolate Pecan Cake. It was a very dense piece of Chocolate cake with fudge, pecans, pecan ice cream and whipped cream. Overall it was good, but very chocolaty. I also tried the creamsicle with blood orange. I found this dessert to be a lot lighter and tastier than the chocolate cake. The only truly bad thing about the night was our experience with the valet/doorman. This is more of a comment for Affinia than C-house. The ""valet"" took our car, and said we didn't need a ticket. Umm, pretty strange to just hand over your car to someone that says ""I'm not the valet, just the doorman, but you don't need a ticket, I'll just take your car"". We checked with the front desk and they said not to worry. When we left, we asked for our car and the doorman told us the price for valet was five dollars more than the actual cost on the door ""because he kept it in front for us"". All in all, he tried to rip us off. For being regarded as a ""nicer"" hotel, the Affinia should set a higher standard and make sure its employees don't try to rip off their customers. To Conclude: C-house's food was good and truly a great value for Restaurant week. I would definitely go back, but just be mindful of the Valet/Doorman at the hotel.",0.999,0.796,0.193,0.01,0.5215135106439456

2011-01-15,2.0,"For the record: 1.5 stars for service 3.5 stars for food. I was very excited to give this place a try.  I went with my sister, who had heard amazing things about the burger (we went for lunch).  I believe we were the first or second table in the restaurant, and that really showed in our service.  Sleepy, slow, and fairly confused.  They have a great special where you can order a salad, sandwich, and small dessert for 15 (price estimate...I forgot).  I thought to ask if the steak sandwich special was available for the special, since it was priced at 12 (and some sandwiches available for the special were upwards of 16-18).  Unfortunately, the answer was no.  But that's ok! So I ask the server if the sandwich is prepared similar to the steak entree they have (which sounded delicious).  She answers by saying a tentative yeah, looking at the menu in my hand, pointing to items in the steak entree description and guessing they were on the sandwich.  WRONG.  The steak was delicious.  The sandwich toppings were nothing like what was described to me.  Millions of capers, a ton of sun dried tomatoes, and some form of aioli.  I ate it, and I didn't complain.  So minus one star for my own personal score as a diner.  But I'm surprised that the server didn't acknowledge the error.  I basically ordered something that didn't exist! My sister's burger was delicious!  It looks small, but it really packs a punch.  Unfortunately, her salad came out incomplete.  It was missing the poached egg and cheese...two main ingredients.  Begrudgingly, the server brought them out on ramekins and left. I think this restaurant can be great.  I WILL go back, because as I've said in previous reviews, I don't condemn a restaurant for one bad experience.  I would perhaps go for dinner, or maybe farther into lunch service, so the server is more familiar with the food she (in this case) is serving.",0.9326,0.828,0.115,0.057,0.5387362637362638

I came here on a Tuesday night and quickly found that I need not have bothered making a dinner reservation for two--the place was very sparsely populated, a nice break from the usual scene at restaurants around town which are usually teeming around the holiday season.  I settled into the meal with a kir royale champagne cocktail, my dinner companion ordered a single malt, neat. We shared the scallops appetizer, which was a bit disappointing as it featured two scallops (what if there had been more than two people sharing the dish?) and was slightly fishy on the finish. I have lived to tell the tale, so I suppose the fishiness was more annoying than catastrophic. Things improved on the main course. I ordered the bolognese pasta, which featured pappardele that was likely made in-house and provided a gourmet spin on a favorite (though, I would not expect anything else from a top-Chef featured restaurant). My friend's grouper looked good and I heard no complaints. Wine pairings were excellent as well, as I went with a medium-bodied syrah that was a good foil for the bolognese.  When dessert came around, my friend and I decided to pass, but many of the offerings looked too good to pass up (including many that appeared seasonal). If I come back, I will work backwards through the menu, starting with dessert. On balance, pacing of the courses was good and service was knowledgeable and courteous. Perhaps there was a lack of waitstaff/servers as it appeared a busboy was dropping off some of the dishes, with our sever making only token appearances toward the end of the meal.",0.9688,0.829,0.13,0.041,0.5606086221470836

We started with a three tier appetizer of oysters, clams, and mussels. They brought us a few pieces of sashimi off the raw bar too that were so fresh and buttery. I had a beet salad that I couldn't stop eating. They made something so simple really special. I could have licked the dressing off the plate.  For my main dish, I had squid ink pasta and it lacked a bit of seasoning, but I mentioned that to the server as feedback, not in any way intended as a complaint. He was very apologetic. So I at least felt like the servers were in tune with good service and understanding the customers. Desserts were homemade candies and didn't impress me much; which was fine because at that point I could have been rolled out of the restaurant. We sat at a high top table on backless stools. I think that's fine for a bar, but for a very nice sit-down meal I prefer a booth or nice table with seats that have a back for leaning on when I have stuffed myself to the brim. Due to this table set-up, I also didn't have any place to put my purse so it sort of sat on my lap the whole time and was a bit uncomfortable.

Wine, well I moved on to wine, Buster was still being good to him.  Ravioli in a pumpkin sauce, this isn't your average Ravioli we're talking amazing flavors again, sage, pumpkin, olives and a nice hearty cheese!! Only complaint I have here is it was a little too al dente for my taste.  He had the scallops as an entree and we shared the cauliflower risotto. One look at the desert menu and I was sold, I'm sort of a macaroon snob, and these did not disappoint!! Brandy Espresso macaroons! By far my favorite of the desserts we tried which we decided to enjoy with a glass of Prosecco on the rooftop to take in the view.

First, $6 glasses of wine upstairs at C-View which complimented the amazing oysters but the night really took off once we came downstairs for dinner. They humbly tried to change my seating request because I now wanted something more cozy after I had already asked for a window seat. I don't want to be a bother so we took the window seat and everything took off from there. FIRST OFF, Lucas our waiter was amazing. We were wished happy anniversary and then brought out two complimentary glasses of champagne (after we each already had two glasses of wine). Then we had the sturgeon and the grouper and both were out of control in addition we had the mac and cheese as a side and the sauteed brussels sprouts, which I never eat, but thought were awesome. Then we had a Beer Float with dark chocolate ice cream with a dark porter that was so rich and decadent and to top it off... Lucas comes back and asks how hungry we still were and then brought us their signature chocolate bar candy which was a taste of five different in house candies including salty peanut and chocolate brittle, sweet fruit skins and another one that was savory and spicy... on the house, AGAIN!!!  Our anniversary was amazing and all of that food and drink for $150 with a very gracious tip, well deserved by the way... I would recommend this to anyone... and in fact, they even called me on Sunday afternoon to tell me that Chef Marcus Samuelsson would not b there which I never expected but was flattered that they called.

Bad: -Friend had hair in her food -Same friend's pork chop was too salty -The morels on my dish were demolished.  Couldnt tell if they were burnt, dehydrated and then not rehydrated properly, or both.  either way, they were NOT good and they should not have been on the plate. -The fois gras had a nice sear on it, and tasted good....if you COULD taste it.  It has this cherry sauce on it that just completely overwhelmed the dish.  All you could taste was cherries in every bite. -Our server was not very knowledgeable, granted he admitted he was new, but still. Poor selection of fish.  Lake superior whitefish, farm raised salmon and trout.  No thanks.  With so many options in the area, i would recommend going elsewhere.  The meal was average.  The only saving grace was the fact that the took one meal off of the bill, and comped us some food, and we didnt even have to ask.  They were clearly embarrassed at their missteps.  The prices here aren't too bad, but you get what you pay for.",0.9553,0.758,0.157,0.085,0.576082251082251

A friend of mine decided to have a birthday celebration on top of the Affinia Hotel earlier this afternoon and I was automatically in. I arrived and there was a huge group outside...first thing I thought was I was going to be in a Roof-like line. I walked past everyone and went to the desk and asked was it a line to get upstairs and he said ""no, go right on up, but we are closing it down around 7 because we have a private party coming up"" It was already 5:50 so I knew I needed to hurry up and do some drinking. The elevator took about 7 minutes to make it down to the first floor and once we got into the elevator it was kind of small, maybe fitting 8 people at best. Made it out of the elevator and stepped into a pretty nice view. Not as big as the other rooftop decks, but just as nice. My group was already there having sips and it was only right if I jumped in and toasted the birthday girl. The waitress recommended the Daniel-Sen which was delicious. I don't remember what it consisted of but it was good. I wanted anither one, but they stopped serving us drinks because they ready to kick us out..LOL (It was time for the private party to come up) Me and one of my buddies were not ready to go so we decided to grab a drink at the bar downstairs. Very nice space which also has outside seating. I grabbed a Change Is Gonna Come (shout out to Sam Cooke), which I also do not remember too much what it consisted of except some bourbon. Good stuff!

Nice decor, mediocre food with nothing distinctive, and dinner clientele that were definitely not interested in fine dining. Hotel guests using their laptops as they ate.

I ordered the salmon, which was served with a flavorful rice (probably brown rice).  I usually like my salmon more dry than how it was prepared, but I didn't mind because it wasn't fishy at all.  I thought the rice was a little too salty.  My sister ordered the pork entree which was served with risotto.  I tried a bite of her dish, it was nothing to rave about.  The risotto was not as heavy as I usually associate risotto being, but the parmesan flavor was very distinct.  For dessert we shared the strawberry tart? which was a graham cracker crust filled with sweet strawberries and served with a bit of sherbert, some kind of cream and sprinkled with pistachios.  Yum!

We were definitely not disapointed.  First, our waiter Chris C. was awesome. He was super friendly and talked to us for quite some time about the menu, restaurant and even sent chef Marcus Samuelson over to our table to say hi. Thank you Chris! We tried a lot of food and were thrilled with literally everything. Off the appetizer menu we tried the scallops, foie gras and duck salad. The foie gras was amazing, but the scallos and duck were close runner-ups.  For entrees we had the salmon and the suckling pig. Hubs loved his salmon and my pic was TO DIE FOR. I almost (ALMOST) licked my plate. lol. We also had the side of spring onion with goat cheese. Again, delish. Dessert was a big win as well. We tried the ice creams- buttermilk blueberry, roasted pear and coconut-chocolate. The blueberry is a MUST. Being total gluttons, we also added some candies from their homemade picks- peanut malt brittle, coconut lime cookies and salted fudge brownies. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount you get with the candies- we took much of it home to eat later tonight.

Yum) and once we got those out of the way, were ushered to our table which was a lovely corner banquette. The entire room is warm and inviting with pillows, wood, bamboo in a large but nicely broken up space.  Our excellent server didn't have to work too hard to get us to order from each section of the menu. As my friend said, ""The menu is small, but they don't make it easy"". Almost every single item practically leapt off the page so we indulged.  First! A dozen oysters (chef's selection) with their amazing house-made cocktail sauce, mignonette and a nori ice chip thing did those kumamotos an even better service than their tasty existence. Holy moly.  Second! Perfectly-seared scallops. Huge, delicious sweetbread. A bowl of their smoky, amazing clam chowder (made with rice milk rather than heavy cream - to leave room for the rest of the menu, presumably. Clever. *Mid-course, compliments of the chef - a lovely, nutty ravioli. Splendid. Third! Seafood all around, thanks. A whole trout, a salt-crusted salmon and my glorious sturgeon - which again, was the clear winner. My friend's salmon was fairly one-note but had excellent, crispy skin, and my other friend's whole trout was meaty and accompanied by a lovely fresh herb/onion um, ""pile"" on top. Demolished.    Sides! Mac and cheese. Some serious mac and cheese. No joke, absolutely delicious. Browned and broiled brussels sprouts. They defeated us, we dented them but they were ultimately stronger. Last! Desserts... ahh yes. See, I'm not really a dessert person. A Dove bar can last me a good six months. I tend to go light, a sorbet, some ice cream, etc. I selected the trio of sorbets which were delightful.  I was impressed by C-House.

The prices are actually very affordable. You'll spend the same or more at Grand Lux Cafe.  I ordered my coffee and the Pork Belly with poached egg. The egg was perfectly poached. The belly was not braised. It was pan-seared as if it were bacon. The star of the dish was that yummy egg with the runny center.  If you enjoy crowds on Sundays, then this place isn't for you. However, if you want to be pampered in a very private upscale restaurant then C House is perfect. You'll spend $15-20 a person for Brunch.

I do realize that restaurant staff is absolutely slammed this week, so we of course anticipate to tip on the full price of lunch rather than on the $22 special menu price. Contingent, of course, that we receive at least fair service. I started with the Werp Farm Baby Lettuce Salad. The poached egg was the highlight-- unfortunately, the dressing didn't do much to enhance the flavors of the slightly peppery frisée.  For my main course, I ordered the C-House 'burger', which is actually made of whitefish and served on a pretzel bun with housemade tartar. I really enjoyed the delicate, mild whitefish though the pretzel bun was unlike any I had before: it was hard and dry. I love pretzel buns but this one didn't bring me any joy. Speaking of something else I wasn't brought-- the candy bar dessert trio. Both of my dining companions received their desserts and I waited, waited and waited some more before we were finally able to win the attention of the super friendly server assistant/busser, Edison. Another 5 minutes passed and finally, I received my dessert (which didn't measure up to any of our expectations).  Throughout the meal, there were several times when we needed our server, made eye contact and still she ignored us. Then we had a different server who also ignored us. It took another 15 minutes for someone to pick up the credit card so we could close our check (Edison to the rescue, once again).

2010-02-26,3.0,"Delightful for lunch, but with a few hiccups, it wasn't quite worth the price of admission for me. First off, Mimosa, I love ya! You, can have 5 stars all to yourself. Secondly, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the earth tones in the daylight. The floor to ceiling windows looking out to Superior let so much natural light in that it was the perfect, eye opening setting for two sleepy lovers and a fab little brunch. Thirdly, our server was the sweetest most adorable thing ever. Something about her voice really won me over, though in hindsight, she didn't come to the table very often. I think the servers, as well as kitchen, may have a lot of prep to get done during the day, so once a plate was dropped off at the table, that would be the last of the server until the next dish was ready. I mean, she was around, just not coming over, not asking how things were, just kind of dropping a dish off and walking away. And I should note that there were 2 servers working and 4 tables (including us) in the restaurant, so it wasn't a 'busy' factor. I do need to give major props to their accommodating our reservation though... as we had to change the reservation 3 times and they were so very willing to harmonize our situation... which was basically me not being able to get my ass up and ready in a timely fashion.  The food we had was decent, but overall not spectacular. We started with a parsley soup and the salad with poached egg and artichoke hearts. I enjoyed both, though the soup could have been warmer and the salad could have had a little more of the trimmings on it. From there we moved on to some sandwiches. My babe got the lobster, avocado, and bacon club. I got the salmon pastrami sandie which is thinly sliced salmon in pastrami spices on rye with fries. I liked the fries but the sandwich was just so-so. I should preface this by saying that I pretty much hate crusty bread, and this bread, which didn't look or taste like the rye that the menu stated the sandwich was served on,  was so toasted that the edges were actually burnt and I swear to you, it felt like it was scraping the skin of the roof of my mouth off when I chewed. Also, the salmon just tasted like regular ole salmon to me. I didn't taste any pastrami spices in it, whatsoever... though it was hard to taste anything beyond the burnt-ish crusty toast that sandwiched the salmon. I guess the best way to put it is that my fave part of the meal were the fries, and the best part of the sandwich were the capers... sooo you know something was off. I will say that the portions were very generous, though. The BF ordered a side of the mac and cheese with pork sausage and goat cheddar which he enjoyed, but wasn't raving about.  The food did fill us up and we both ended up taking a half a sandwich, most of the mac and cheese, and some of the candies from dessert home, so we really got kind of a lunch and a half-ish. Oh, I almost forgot dessert! How could I forget? For dessert we had the candy bar trio which I wasn't a huge fan of. I just don't like dessert plates like that... you know,  where it's 3 different things that you have to eat separately and don't really go together on a plate even though you could argue some salty vs sweet biz-nast... but I'm not buying it. I want a real dessert, not a compilation of treats you'd find in a bowl at a Superbowl party. It was a dessert like this that lost Stefan the Top Chef title to that jerk off, Hosea in season 5... and as much as I LOVE Stefan, he lost me with that dessert, as did C-House with their rendition. I did really enjoy the 2 cookies, but the pistachio brittle, and the citrus slices with sugar really didn't do it for me. To me, it was the equivalent of serving trail mix for dessert... and I'm no fan of trail mix, especially not for my favorite meal.  All in all, it was okay, but I don't think I'd fork out the $90 for 2 people for lunch again.",0.9988,0.776,0.171,0.053,0.5294817470664929

Andrea, Jelena and I decided to try some restaurant week goodness at MS's contribution to Chicago dining. I was aware that there was a new sheriff in the kitchen and I wanted to see what was up. I was psyched to see that the RW options included some things I wanted to try. I was shown to our table by a nice hostess. I doffed my coat and waited for my party. With a minute or so of arrival, the busser welcomed me and filled my water glass. My party came and he repeated the action. It would be a while until our waitress came over to do anything similar. This was to be the case for our entire dining experience. Need something? Busser to the rescue (although he did forget to bring the 'signature ketchup with the sandwiches'). Want service from the waitress? Receive averted glances, refusals to check in on us, misinformation about the menu, and flat-out 'bish, whatchu lookin' at?' side-eyes. It was rather shocking. I could see the need for attitude had we been rude or difficult. I can be both. Just ask. We were neither. I don't know what the problem was but it was enough to put a taint on the dining experience. But, that's no matter if the food is amazing. Right? Well, it's not. I began the meal with the clam chowder. I was promised clam and bacon. What I received was a watery broth with two breaded clams and pieces of veggies. I neither tasted nor saw pig. Eh. It was alright. For my sandwich, I ordered the salmon pastrami. Lest you think I would eat seafood and swine together, I assure you, it was salmon 'cured' like pastrami on rye with cream cheese, capers, red onions...sound familiar? Yeah, you've had it a million times. The rye bread was a bit hard and I wound up scraping the inside of my mouth trying to chew it. Eh. It was okay. For dessert, Andrea and I received the trio of candy bar things. Jelena got to look at ours. Even though we all ordered off the RW menu, our waitress only brought two desserts. Three attempted flags and one conversation with the busser (note: not the waitress) later, Jelena got her dessert. That she paid for. Are you following all of this? The desserts varied from 'okay' to 'fine.' I ate them all but I have no self control. Eh. It was satisfactory. My resounding thought upon the conclusion of the meal was that I was so happy to not have paid full price for this and that I would never come back. Nothing I ate was bad. But nothing I ate was outstanding. Even if this is RW lunch, put your best product (food, service, etc.) forward because the people inside your restaurant are current customers with the hopes of them becoming future customers. I won't be a future customer. Now, let's rewind this dining experience and sub in some decent, attentive service. I'd likely say that while now everything wasn't to my taste, xxx made my lunch such a positive experience that I am curious about the rest of the menu and dinner. Let's see what that's like.  Do you see the difference? It's too bad our waitress didn't. Smell ya later, C-House.",0.9883,0.818,0.12,0.062,0.5632010582010584

2010-02-22,5.0,"Went for a restaurant week lunch and was prepared to think it was . . . fine. I can be a harsh critic, and I was pretty convinced that there was no way I was going to get value for money since they run specials all the time.  The room was nice enough and the service was good (if a little strange - the servers seemed perpetually unsure about whether or not they were going to let us keep some, all, or none of our silverware from course to course), but 24 hours later I can't stop thinking about my sandwich. Ever since I'd read about it when C-House first opened, I'd wanted to try the salmon pastrami, though I was a little hesitant about any sandwich that was a cross between pastrami on rye and a bagel with lox. That said, the sandwich was amazing. The salmon was more like gravlox than anything else (not shocking, I guess), and contrasted with the vinegar from the capers and the tartness of the cheese perfectly. Even the rye toast worked well. I wasn't the biggest fan of the house-made ketchup (a little too smokey for my tastes), but the fries were great on their own. Between the sandwich and the starter salad, I was too full for dessert - something that's never before happened at a restaurant week meal.  Luckily, our server gave us take-home containers for the chocolate, brittle, and cookies . . . As if I hadn't already spent all day thinking of ways to get people to go back to C-House for lunch with me for the sandwich, the molasses fudge cookies alone would be enough to get me back through the door.

The server asked the chef to substitute with a comparable, and brought us an extra few as an apology.  - Tuna, Lobster, and Cobia (all individual, unique preparations) were all pretty darned good.

2009-11-05,5.0,"C-House has started a wonderful tradition of having monthly beer paired meals for $40.  Three courses included an amuse, a starter, choice of an entre and a dessert each paired with the brewery of the month's beer.  During October the brewery of choice was Goose Island.  So we started the evening off with a Lavender Gin Fiz, served up and frothy, due to the added egg whites, and a rosemary lemonade, a vodka drink served on the rocks. Both were amazingly mixed and flavored; not too sweet and not overpoweringly strong tasting (but strong liquor-wise).  Possibly some of the best mixology type drinks I have ever had. Before the beer menu, we sampled items from the raw bar. Our favorites included the yellow tail mini fish tacos, cobia with curried squash and the salmon belly. The grilled oyster with fennel jelly and apple was a different but amazing combination. (The house made bread has Wisconsin cheddar cheese curds baked into the middle! ) Now to the beer paired menu:   The first course was fried oysters with greens and bacon aioli. It was served with Sofie Ale, a great flavor combination with the light ale and the fried oysters.   The main course was a choice of Matilda braised pork shoulder with root vegetables, mashed potatoes and mustard greens two ways or halibut with pumpkin and Matilda broth.  Both were served with a nice sized pour of Matilda.  Luckily it was a Parks sister date so we shared both.  The pork was definitely our favorite but the halibut was fabulous as well.   The beer menu's dessert is a butterscotch panna cotta served with homemade pecan sandies. In the past I have never chosen panna cotta for my dessert but this one changed my mind!  Served with Bourbon County Stout the crunchy cookies and creamy butterscotch were an amazing combination.  We also got the privilege of sampling C-House's pumpkin bread pudding made from croissants and served with creme fraiche ice cream.  Bread pudding is another dessert I do not order, but again C-House had opened my eyes to a new dessert to enjoy. Service was fabulous; we had a great waitress who was friendly, happy to offer suggestions and truly made our evening.  We would have invited her to join us, had she not been waiting on us.  We had the opportunity to speak with the executive chef and see just how excited she is about the restaurant, her kitchen staff, the food they put out and the new specials they are offering.

I'd first tried his food at the Housewares show after he did a demo and kind of fell in love with it. So C-House was definitely on my radar and list of places I HAD to try.  I convinced my parents to take me for my birthday back in February during Restaurant Week. The decor is slick and warm. Tones of brown, orange and cream consume the dining room (and I commented to my parents that I thought they needed *something* to break it up, it felt a little *too* monochromatic. Pretty, but monochromatic.)  I had some sort of butternut squash and lobster soup, fish and chips, and the pineapple upside down cake. That soup was one of the best soups I've ever eaten. I kinda wanted to lick the bowl. The fish of the fish and chips was a *tinge* on the greasy side (I have a feeling the oil wasn't entirely up to temp), but they were still generally tasty.  The chips?!!?!? OH MY GOD. I must preface this by saying I HATE ketchup. Abhor it, actually. (I blame this on eating it everyday when I was a wee'r lass). But this sh!t right here?  WOW. I almost felt like the fries (which were pretty awesome in their own right) were just a device for delivering that lovely ketchup into my mouth. I could eat that EVERY DAY.  Because I'd gorged on their fantastically awesome and delicious bread (reminded me of a cheddar cheesy brioche), and we were running a bit late to get back south to watch 24, I opted to take my dessert home. But I did eat the yummy coconut sorbet before I left (because I knew that wouldn't travel very well...), but the pineapple upside down cake made for a great breakfast the next morning. They were also quite accommodating of my parents' dietary restrictions which was great. I've been back a couple of times since (once for their C-wich $5 crab cake special) and have fallen in love with the chorizo and goat cheese mac and cheese. Their pralines are AMAZING. I'm convinced they only hire attractive staff (from the servers to the kitchen staff... the last time I went me and my girlfriends couldn't stop ogling them!). They've got a decent beer selection, nice wine list, the candy bar treats are also pretty yummy, and they have one of the better playlists in the hospitality industry (I've noticed this the three times I've been).

I'm not sure why C-House isn't more popular.  Maybe I should hope that it stays that way so we can walk in almost any time.  But more people need to check this place out--try it for dessert and go back for dinner.",0.9806,0.803,0.166,0.031,0.5794603174603175

2009-03-31,2.0,"Soo a friend and I were staying in the Affinia for three nights, and upon arriving to this boutique-beautiful hotel, we had previously made a reservation to dine at the C-House for a late dinner before we headed out on the town. I have lived (and dined plentifully) in many great cities, including San Francisco, so I was excited to see what Chicago had to offer...hmmmm. The atmosphere is pleasant, with unique seating arrangements, interesting decorations, and pleasant staff. I am a pseudo-vegan, so I was concerned about eating here, but I was hoping for some flexibility with the chef. Our server was very knowledgeable, and suggested some great wine. The offerings at first glance seem elegant, with interesting pairings. I decided to have the prix fixe with a pear and pecan salad, salmon, and dessert. I informed the server that I was a vegan except I ate salmon, and asked for a different sauce than the offered ""bone marrow"" (???) The salad would have been delicious; with the nice combination of flavors, but someone must have accidentally spilled the sea salt on it, because my mouth hurt from the sea-flavored greens...The salmon also came surrounded with brioche, and I requested it come without it. I asked for a light meal of salmon with a side of vegetables or something of the sort, and was basically disgusted with what arrived. My salmon had the aforementioned brioche on it, and the side appeared to be a deep-fried burned piece of french toast stick, reminiscent of a bad morning at Burger King. Atop the grease stick were slivers of pickle, something white looking like rice noodle, and quail egg with the yolk sadly dripping all over my plate. I must have looked like someone smacked me, because our server came to my resuce...or so I thought.. I scraped the dried-up brioche off of my fish, and tried a bite of it. It was terrible..First, it was probably about 5 oz..For 24$? It was also overcooked, and dry. Longhorn's salmon is sooo much better! (sadly) Our server asked if there was something wrong, and I was speechless.. (Everything was wrong..!) I didn't want to offend him or the chef, so I stated that I would try to eat it. I did-I took one more bite of the salmon, and just couldn't get past my distaste. But our server must have decided to avoid me at all costs..because my friend was completely done with her meal before he checked on us again. I had sat there with my plate untouched, and he was more than able to come over, but didn't. I would have tried to order something different, but he never came back...It's ok I've just been flying all day--I'm not hungry or anything.. I thought I had given some ideas as to my desire for a springtime salmon-perhaps with something seasonal and fresh...not a grease fest. As for my friend had the baked chicken, and she said it was very moist and flavorful...but the sausage in it was pretty pink and she avoided it.  So when he finally came back, I declined the ""alcohol"" he offered to make the situation better, and he brought our dessert.. It was the ""chocolate candy bar"" Which is just like another user described as ""leftover valentine's candy."" The scant little bites weren't terrible, but there were too many different flavors, and not enough pleasure in the minuscule sizes. Overall, I was terribly disappointed in the quality of the meal, and I suggest that the menu perhaps divulge a little more about what comes with the entrees. Also, after having comped my meal..I would have thought the manager (who seemed to be quite available) would have approached our table. I'm just flirting with the idea of spectacular service accompanying a delicate and enjoyable meal.. ?  Come on C-House, this is ChicagO!! There's competition, you know..  Longhorn's anyone?",0.991,0.804,0.128,0.068,0.6057017543859649
2009-03-23,4.0,"Very good seafood restaurant located in the Affinia hotel just east of Michigan Ave., which could be an advantage or drawback depending on your affinity for tourists. Cooper pots hang near the ""prep station"" area in plain view, and copper seems to be the color of choice splashed throughout. Some of the seafood options listed on the menu include oysters, salmon, and skate wing, but suckling pig and steak also appear. I had the fish & chips which came w/ a homemade ketchup, which is a great idea, but it was laden w/ smoke chipolte flavors which did not go well with the home-cut fries and deep fried cod. The oysters were excellent including a W. Coast variety I've never tried before called Olympia, a small delicate oyster with a cucumber taste but slightly ""fishy"" after taste. The Kumomoto oysters were fantastic. The salmon was good, but pairing it w/ bone marrow (a la osso buco) is too ambitious.

2009-03-01,2.0,"After not being able to get a reservation at One Sixtyblue or Naha during restaurant week and I ended up at this place. Bad move. C-House was a total let down. Our three course menu included your choice of salad or soup, one entrée: salmon, fish and chips, or a chicken dish, and dessert: the ""chocolate candy bar"", or a donut with ice cream. I went with the soup, salmon and chocolate option. The lobster soup was the highlight and the meal went down hill from there. My friend's salmon was pretty much raw and when she asked for it to be cooked again I think they just stuck it under a heat lamp and gave it back b/c it didn't appear to have moved and the plate was super hot. They were nice enough to give her the fish and chips. Unfortunately, this was bland and the homemade ketchup was noting special. Finally the dessert came - by far the biggest disappointment. It looked like a bunch of left over Valentine's Day chocolate arranged on a plate. The worst was the room temperature hot chocolate. The heat came from the chili powder around the rim of the shot glass...yuck. The dinning experience then managed to get worse. We noticed that the tables around us were given bread with dipping sauce that looked awesome and they even received appetizers from the raw bar ""compliments of the chef."" What?! None of this was offered to us. Um yeah we got the shaft. Anyway, they must have noticed that we we're happy b/c they did comp us for one meal.

2009-02-28,4.0,"The Restaurant week promotion led us to the C-house. I have to preface my review by saying that just a few hours before our visit, I found out that my company that was previously untouched by our recession is now planning a round of pay cuts and layoffs. So I was in a pretty stunned mood when we got there.  The staff at C-house makes quite the first impression. The are friendly and courteous. Our server was more than happy to give us suggestions and tell us what dishes that the C-house is famous for.  I ended up getting the New York strip and Carolynne r and I shared a side order of the Chorizo Mac and Cheese. The food was good, but it didn't wow me. The New York strip was tasty, but the portion was a bit skimpy by Midwest standards. Our server was raving about the Chorizo Mac and Cheese dish, but it left me disappointed. It was kind of on the bland side.  This was going to be a three star review before dessert. But the (what C-House calls) candy bar desserts blew me away. Carolynne r. got the fudge Brownie and I got the cookies and cream. Both of them were quite tasty and very generous for the $3 dollar price. It was portioned perfectly and tasted great.  The bottom line is that C-house gave us a fun, relaxing and somewhat pampering experience when I desperately needed it. It was a wonderful evening. Even though the food may not have blown me away, the service was as good as it gets. C-House is worth a visit just for desserts alone.",0.9867,0.769,0.165,0.066,0.6131701631701632
2009-02-28,5.0,"We came for Restaurant Week, but after seeing all these little fascinating options offered on the regular menu, both Andy M and I ended up just going that route.  First I want to mention that the service here is top notch. Everyone is professional and charmingly gracious. I even had a waiter step aside, sort of take a little bow, and extend his arm as I passed him to go to the restroom. Little things like napkins being refolded are just added touches that make you feel very welcomed. Our waiter seemed truly interested in our opinion of each dish, as he said 'so the next people that come in get a real sense of whats good, and not just what tastes good to him'. The room is also quite beautiful, done in a sailing theme with colour tones of copper and teak.  I started out with 2 fresh west coast oysters, a Deer Creek and a Kumamoto. They were on the small side, but intensely flavourful and very fresh. I liked the Deer Creek better. These came with a rice wine vinegar, a house made cocktail sauce, and a little frozen melon something-or-other, which I believe was a palate cleanser. At least that's how I used it.  Then Andy ordered the NY Strip, which came with a sweet potato terrine and Brussels sprouts, as well as an order of the chorizo mac & cheese. The meat was cooked perfectly, and the terrine was layers of paper-thin potato coated with a sauce that tasted almost chocolaty. I ended up with all his Brussels sprouts, they were crisp tender and had some sort of salty sauce which I loved - it really made the sweetness of the vegetable pop through. I didn't really love the mac & cheese, as the sauce had virtually no cheese flavour (it tasted like pasta just tossed with a white sauce to me) and bacon was a predominant flavour, rather than chorizo. But Andy loved it and so who am I to complain!  I ordered the fish & chips, which came with a house made ketchup and some of the most delicious tartar sauce I have ever eaten. I would have just eaten it with a spoon if I thought I could have gotten away with it, it was that good. Now, I am a VERY picky person when it comes to seafood, and normally things just don't measure up in the Midwest. I have to say, this fish was freakin fantastic. A very close runner up to my reigning champ (Duke of Perth). The batter was light and crisp, not greasy at all, and the fish was creamy and piping hot.  Lastly we opted for a taste of their mini-desserts (the concept of which I love, not being a big sweets eater), Andy got the Cookies & Cream, which was like a super elegant version of an Oreo, and I got the salted brownie. Very nice, a perfect size and just enough sweet to make you satisfied.  All in all, this was a great experience at a very cool downtown joint. Oh they also have this tiny lounge and patio on the 29th floor. In the summer I can see that being a great place to hang out, have a few drinks, and take in some lovely views of the city.",0.9993,0.72,0.25,0.03,0.5753779840848807
2009-02-26,2.0,"Nothing positive found at the C-House.... This place is lost from the beginning.  IKEA like pictures of sailboats adorned the entire dinning room, so I get that we should be eating seafood.  However, once I looked at the menu I was confused.  Besides, the small ""C-Bar"" menu of small bites seafood was hardly the focus.  The better sounding food was beef and pasta.  Second the service was crap, unfocused and unapologetically bad.  Our guy was unpolished, mumbled and fumble throughout dinner and plain lied to us.  We ordered a sampler from the C-Bar and after some time and ordering some wine we ordered the duck risotto.  However, the duck risotto comes out first and when we ask our server about it he comes up with a sad excuse ""I was trying to have them come out at the same time"" -- The sampler came out 15 minutes later.  Don't lie to me, we understand if you screw up, we've waited tables, I get it!  But to lie to us and then avoid us is not going to make anyone happy! As for the food, it didn't really get any better than our service....  The Duck Risotto should be two separate dishes, the risotto over powered the flavor of the duck and was slightly undercooked.  The duck alone was nice however.   The sampler: Fish tacos - only tasted the greasy shell, not the fish Waygu -  Capers over powered beef which should be able to stand alone Tuna - was well tuna with pine nuts, not exciting. Salmon bagel - not sure what I was supposed to be tasting, impossible to split. I had the salmon for dinner which was overcooked and served encrusted with something that added no value to the plate.  Also, it came with a long skinny hash brown topped with pickled crap... why??  The best part of this plate was the pureed parsnips. My wife had the skate, my taste was mushy and unimpressive.  She thought it was OK.  Her Oxtail bite was the highlight for me.  She also had a few of their deserts and really like the pistachio brittle.  I had the vanilla cupcake as my birthday surprise and I wasn't surprised, it was dry. I'm should give this place one star, but it wasn't a total disaster, I really enjoyed the time with my wife....

They started us off with some complementary warm coffee cake which had a nice crumbly topping.  Delicious!  The brunch menu has a Portuguese (or maybe Brazilian?)  twist to some of the items.  We split the spicy pulled pork eggs benedict, feijoadas (poached eggs, pork hash, rice & beans), and a side of the chorizo & goat cheese mac.  The feijoadas was the clear winner - slightly spicy saucy pork hash that went well with the perfectly poached eggs.  The eggs benedict were only ok, the pulled pork was tender but not at all spicy.  It also came with an additional side of toast, which was way too much food - actually, all their portions were quite big, something I don't expect at a fancy hotel restaurant.  The mac was decent, very al dente which I like, but not very cheesy with too little chorizo. Service was very good.  The waitress left us alone but always magically appeared to refill our coffee cups.  The staff was just very friendly overall.  The space is very nice, comfortable, and relaxing.  I would definitely come here for brunch again.",0.9928,0.777,0.207,0.016,0.6271129229193743

Appetizers:   -The yellowtail fish tacos are ridiculously good!  they're small and bite sized but pack an incredibly fresh flavor.  There's dry roasted corn on the plate which adds nice texture and doubles up as a great snack!   -The cheesebread they serve in the beginning is amazing... light, fluffy, and moist.   -I wasn't a huge fan of the tuna w/ pine nuts and toasted vinaigrette on the raw bar.  Sounded great but not executed very well!    -Finally, we ordered the duck risotto which ws outstanding.  Bold flavors in a perfectly cooked risotto.  Entrees: -I ordered the Monk Fish, which was accompanied w/ a crab/cucumber bite on the side, as well as 6 mussels w/ some sort of broth poured over them tableside.  The fish was wonderful... sliced and crusted w/ a nice crust which packed a lot of flavor.  The crab/cucumber was very tasty.  I was a little disappointed w/ the mussels though.  One of them wasn't cleaned properly, they were also not as plump as I would have liked.  The broth didn't have a whole lot of flavor either.  I did order a side of the chorizo mac and cheese which was soooo good, everyone must try this.  The brussel sprouts were some of the best i've ever had, garnished w/ spicy pumpkin seeds that added a great texture contrast.  Other entrees ordered by my friends were the suckling pig, fish & chips, salmon, and skate.  I tried a piece of the pig which was beautifully crisp and flavorful.  The fish & chips were a huge standout, w/ incredible seasoning and housemade ketchup and tartar sauce that I could have just poured in my mouth.  And the fries!!!  Insanely good w/ the seasoning.  For dessert we shared a chocolate hazelnut tart w/ caramel ice cream which was to die for.  The ice cream selection is pretty unique, too bad didn't get to try em all!   Overall a hip, inviting place w/ great food that's fun to share.  Just make sure not to order wine at the bar!  The biatch bartender poured my friend not even a 1/4 of a normal sized wine glass, and when she asked for some more the bartender claimed it was a 5oz pour and that their glasses are special (which they were not).  C-House made up for this when later on they ran off w/ my other friends leftover suckling pig, throwing it out when he wanted to take it home, but promptly made him another pig to take home which was nice of them.  Kudos!",0.9991,0.715,0.24,0.046,0.6005136625826282

Once seated for dinner is where things started to fall apart.   The menu is set up with little raw bar tastes as well as full sized entrees.  We sampled a large array of the menu.  Here are our winners and losers: Winners:  Raw oysters, beef tartar, fish tacos, goat cheese mac and cheese (had to send back as it was cold the first time), fish and chips, Butternut squash soup (that had to be sent back as it was cold on the first try), any of the amazing desserts (we tried the cupcakes, and the brownie) Losers:  Suckling pig (way too salty), Seared tuna (too salty) Prawns with hearts of palm that tasted old and fishy (we sent those back), rib eye (again the salt), homemade ketchup that was way too vinagery/smokey for our tastes, flavored fries (too much salt or seasoning) All in all- for the amount of food that we sent back to the kitchen for temperature or salt issues- you would have thought that a restaurant of this caliber would send the manager over to see what was up or at least comp us a dessert or something.  Nothing.  Dead silence.  Really hard to believe. Oh well.  I just know where I won't be sending my friends for dinner anytime soon.  C-House- get it together.  You've got a great space- now get the food up to the same level.",0.9908,0.813,0.142,0.045,0.4954775779775778
2008-10-04,4.0,"Nice decor and great service.  We ordered the C-House tastes which is the chef's selection of small bites (c-bar).  The tastes were perfect and I was a huge fan of the fluke and yellowtail tacos.  I would highly recommend ordering any from the c-bar.  The Mussel soup was good, even though I don't typically care for cream based soups.  The fact that the mussels were fried did little for me.  Still, great and clean flavors.  Though I did enjoy the monk fish (very fresh!), I actually prefered the chorizo mac and cheese.  Skip on the desserts.  Cute concept with the candy bar selection (small bites for $2) but I was not really wowed with the cupcake or roll-ups we ordered.   If you have time go to the 29th floor and enjoy the rooftop views at C-view!  We went on a weekday so we were basically the only ones up there.  The views of the city were amazing.  Drink menu was slightly different than the one in the restaurant so be sure to check it out.  Indoor seating as well for the colder Chicago months.",0.9786,0.785,0.185,0.03,0.6535858585858586
2008-08-15,3.0,"Went for a business lunch.  I know the lunch menu is never as good as the dinner menu, but this one seemed especially limited.  The raw appetizers were good, but also teeny tiny.  My beet salad was good and the others said the curried mussel soup was good. I had trout as an entree which was good but not spectacular.  Seemed a little salty.  The small-bite desserts is a good concept, but I did not like my chocolate-mint ice cream cookie type thing.  I swear it tasted like basil. Dinner might be a completely different experience, but I don't know that I'm willing to give it a try on my own dime.",-0.974,0.775,0.0,0.225,0.6140894819466248
2008-07-28,4.0,"This is a cute little spot tucked away in the freshly renovated Affinia Hotel. There is a nice lounge area and smallish dining area. The decor is really inviting with interesting artwork and books lying around. It almost makes you feel like you are in a really big living room. There is an open kitchen as well.  The menu is very well thought out with different options for everyone. My favorite part about it was the bite sized apps and desserts. It was just enough for a taste but didn't put me over the edge in fullness. The desserts are all made in house and are easily mixed and matched for groups. Its a great place to go with a group of people for sharing! I would have given it five stars but my lobster club was a tiny portion compared to all of the other dishes ordered by people in my group.

2008-07-27,1.0,"I have cut the rating from 5 to 1 stars. I went with a group of people including a client to dinner last Saturday night. Here's my advice to that superstar chef Marcus Samuelson - if you're going to put your name and reputation behind a restaurant , get your ass out to Chicago and start cooking! Food - mediocre at best - I was looking forward to the scallops, steak, etc that we had last time, everything was fair.  Service - I don't know where this joker who was our server trained or what but when my wife gives you the credit card to pay for dinner and tells you not to take the client's card (who had discreetly handed it to him) then use my card. This guy's answer, well he gave me the card first. I guess I was a bit too buzzed at the time to complain to the manager. Drinks - First of all, bring the wine menu the first time we ask, not the fourth after we finished with dinner and what's with those glass dixie cups for cocktails on the rocks. R U Kidding me? Positives:  The chorizo mac'n cheese was good.",0.8935,0.852,0.104,0.044,0.42121212121212115
2008-07-24,5.0,"C-House, chef Marcus Samuelsson's new restaurant is a hit parade of the palette. Just barely a month old and flavors and scents from the kitchen are delightful. This eatery has all the sensibilities of a ready for prime time restaurants; beautiful dark woods that hone each guest to both relax and transport them to enjoy the journey of food. C-House's focus is foods of the sea; raw bar and seafood abounds; but don't worry if you are not a fan of seafood; C-House offers non-seafood delights as well. I am a seafood fan and looked forward to this cuisine in a landlocked state. Rest assured everything is fresh, very fresh. My first plate was the raw bar specialty of shrimp, mussels, clams and oysters served; the house made cocktail sauce was my favourite and gently coated each seafood bite with this gorgeous sauce; a delightful first plate; gave a wonderful briny experience and did not impede with other plates to come. The mussel soup was innovative; mussel soup? The mussels were fried, served with squash and the server placed the light cream into the bowl. Easily one of the most flavorful and enjoyable soups that I have had in a very long time. Highly recommend this soup. The beat salad was wondrously earthy and a nice refreshingly sweet against the savory and spiciness of the soup. We received an amuse bouche of micro shrimp taco's--one of my dinner mates said that it was the best taco he had ever enjoyed. For my second plate, I could not resist the lobster club and fries; easily the best lobster club I have eaten. The club are two small squares (cocktail sized bread) delicately composed of fresh and delightful and sweet lobster; a thin coating of avocado and bacon in the bread; each flavor comes together flawlessly; this sandwich is evidence that they not be overpowered or over tall with too many ingredients; there was complete confidence in the construction of this sandwich that all ingredients would be noted and superbly enjoyed. The fries were perfectly crisped with a moist interior, well salted and served with a spicy-sweet house made ketchup. I ate everything on the plate and did so because each morsel was gorgeous. I ordered the grits and the mushrooms as a side; the grits were sweet, smooth and creamy; the king trumpet mushrooms were a harmonious complement to the grits; and the corn flavors were nice homage to a Midwest favorite. The wine menu was nicely edited; I liked the wines by the bottle offering slightly more than by the glass; but the wines by the glass were well chosen; some well known and others quite thoughtful. I had to have the candy bar. Lots of options for dessert; I had the chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and fresh marshmallow--a delight; the cherry tart--cherries from Michigan so appropriate for the time of year; and for me an enjoyable treat to have cherries from somewhere other than California; but before you are done for the evening the Candy Bar is a must. I adored the lavender chocolate--a slight hint of lavender that is the first lavender chocolate that has not been overpowered but how it should be made. Each dish was presented and plated with innovation and worked well with the wooden dishes that seemed to not be focal point but harmonious blend with interior design from plate to table to wall. We began our service with one waiter and ended up with another. Not sure how that happened; I was watching the waiters and noticed our original waiter had a larger table to attend to; the successor waiter was superb and made the experience exceptional; he was attentive, friendly and food passionate. C-House offers it's diners with a complete and satisfying and delightful culinary experience, an ambiance of up-to-date music and excellent service that is on equally pairing of food and environs.",0.9997,0.701,0.293,0.006,0.6096516614698432

2008-07-07,5.0,"Pop fish tacos in your mouth like bonbons!  By the fistful.   They're hardly the size of your thumb  and go down about smoother and quicker than water. People are waiting in a long ridiculous line to get into a pizza place next door.  Chuckle at them for doing so then proceed to... Sit at the raw bar and taste the wonders of the RAAAAW.   Beef tartare is better than any I've tried.  We did oysters, fluke, a soy'd fatty tuna, the Cupie octopus salad, and I am not a big salmon fan typically,  but their smoked salmon with carmelized creamcheese is phenomenal. I love the fluke entree with all its hot-broth glory, sparkling cherry tomatoes and artichoke.  I can hardly recall what my guests ate as a main 'cause I was so into that dang BROTH!  Couldn't get enough. (Dude had snapper w/ pork belly.  Brother downed the fish and chippies- good n' crunchy filet batter though they were too greasy for me.)   I've had the fluke twice now and heard it sells out frequently.  No kidding.  It is that gooood.   ***The corn flan is a lovely surprise.  Presented with lace-like slivers of baby summer squash***  Loved the short rib pasta.  Very well done! Great beet salad and 'please, PLEASE more' perfect mac-n-cheese. The manager gave appropriate wine suggestions but I was bent on sampling the mixed-d's.  Got the Honeysuckle!  The cucumber drink was fine too- bright, crisp, clean and well, garden-flavored.  The 29th Floor cocktail was too strong for me, so I just passed it along and ordered another Honeysuckle.  No harm done.  Yum. Side note:  At one point, I zoned out mid-sentence during dinner and became suddenly aware of the volume in the room.  It was nearly seated to capacity and the many voices did not seem to carry over.  Nice.  Also, the overhead music was at a level that was 'out there', subtle but not 'in' or coating our conversation.  Better still.   Generally all 'round, a very comfortable dining room.  Coppertone.  Simple.   Food again:  The pastry girl is GENIUS.  I will follow her around this city for just her MARSHMALLOWS any day.  In-house-made FRUIT ROLL-UPs... Need I say more, kids?  The tart dessert is BOMB!  (I can't believe I used 'bomb' but what else?)  Also the salted brownies and squishy icing mint-chip cookies are stellar.  My brother inhaled the Black Forest cake, but not before I snagged a lick of brandied cherry ice cream... a DREAM! Our server was savvy/smart-hot.  Informative, polite, present in a timely fashion and careful not to interrupt 'a moment' if we were too absorbed in our own experience.   8 pm reso on the 4th of July.  We lost track of time after making friends with 2 different tourist couples crashing in the Affinia hotel.  Almost 4 hours later... time to take it UPSTAIRS to the 29th floor.  A roof-top view, the C-View bar/lounge.  Slightly enclosed and cozy!  Maybe like a bit of Miami in Chicago.  Wonderful.  We could still see fireworks way off to the west side of the city.  Romantic in retrospect but I wasn't feelin' then, too buzzed and in Food Coma. Casual yet refined atmosphere.  Contemporary yet Classic. Fitting for many occasions. Well worth multiple FISH TACO visits.",0.9985,0.77,0.194,0.036,0.4987579815448669
2008-07-02,2.0,"Dear Patricia A., Let me correct your false assumption regarding why I gave C-House a ""bad review."" I am well aware that he has other restaurants, and I am not expecting him to "" be at all of them all the time,"" but opening weekend at a brand new restaurant in a new city? Yes, I would expect him to be manning the helm between the front of the house and the back of the house, watching entree's go by on the pass.  (I do agree that the service was magnificent.) Furthermore, his absence was merely a theme which tied together the negative aspects of my experience. Sammuelson presence was a very small factor because, the food WAS NOT THAT GOOD. What's worse is that I really wanted it to love C-House! Even as I wrote my review I jockeyed between 2, 3 and 4 stars. I am a huge fan of Sammuelson and booked my reservation weeks before they were technically accepting them. You see, I have Sammuelson's book, Aquavit, and follow his career closely (he is getting ready to open a chain of gourmet burger joints around the country). I know what he is capable of and what I tasted at C-House on the second night of their dinner service was only worth 2 stars. And I am sincerely sorry that is the case.",0.9845,0.767,0.18,0.053,0.46883030303030293
2008-07-01,5.0,"Firstly, I thoroughly enjoyed my entire C-House experience.  The restaurant is beautiful yet relaxed.  The service was impeccable.  From the hostess to the servers, everyone treated me like royalty.  Every bit of my meal was amazing.  We began with the raw bar tasting menu.  This was FANTASTIC.  A huge variety of fresh tasty bites.  Then I had the Fluke entree and my dining companion had the lobster club.  We also had the beet salad and chorizo mac and cheese as sides.  Everything was spectacular and extremely innovative.  For dessert, we had selections from their Candy Bar!  This was amazing!  It was like being in a gourmet candy store.  All in all, my experience there was excellent.   In reference to the previous negative review,  I can only assume that the reviewer gave a bad review simply because chef Samuelsson was not present.  Maybe she should be reminded that the chef has a total of 10 restaurants in 3 different countries, so he probably cannot be at all of them all the time.  Just a thought.",0.9855,0.763,0.201,0.036,0.6731976356976358
2008-06-22,5.0,"C-House, the restaurant within the Affinia hotel was an awesome taste experience. Executive Chef Seth Siegel-Gardner leads the diner through an unique palate experience with his sampler dishes from the fresh seafood bar. Whether it is Yellow Tail Fish Tacos, a sushi dish with a play on the Tex-Mex fish taco or Fried Octopus with Chili Mayo the Raw Seafood Bar runs the gamut of fresh options.  To satisfy the cooked fish fiend C-House flies in fresh fish that day and prepares specials accordingly. Their Branzino for two leaves the diner with a generous helping of a flavorful flaky white fish. Three tasty dipping sauces accompany the Branzino experience for a satisfying fish feast.  I would recommend C-House to anyone who loves seafood and wants to try an old staple in a new and fresh way. C-House will certainly C-Me again.",0.9859,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.4848223205366062
