2010-08-09,2.0,"""Everybody in the center of the ring just like a circus...""  To quote Britney Spears ""Circus"", Marche was truly a Circus in decor - and it creeped me out just a little bit. Not to mention that the food wasn't particularly memorable, and it validated that some restaurants are on Groupon because they're struggling.  I came to Marche with four others, two of whom were from the Netherlands, for some French food. Honestly, I am having the worst time finding some good, under $30 French food in Chicago, and Marche didn't help. I had some sort of stew with seafood that left me hungry within an hour. Sure I don't remember the name of it, but whatever, the restaurant is now closed. Lastly, the bathrooms were a total trip. Not only were they a trip to get to, they were trippy with their elongating and shortening ""fun"" circus mirrors, circus-tent stripe-painted walls, and oddly spaced bathroom stalls. It creeped me out because we all know that the clowns...are...coming...to...get...you. Au revoir Marche, et votre establishment!",0.4521,0.901,0.064,0.035,0.4597222222222222
2010-06-15,4.0,"It was a sweltering Friday when we trudged into Marché for lunch. We were under the impression that we had a reservation, but we were told pretty sharply by the host that they didn't have it in their books. Luckily for them, the place was nearly empty so it wasn't too difficult to push some tables together to accommodate our large group.  The host quickly warmed up to us and was very friendly as he offered us some iced tea as we started to cool down in the air-conditioned restaurant. The décor was also fun and whimsical - although I was a bit scared by the giant headshot of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. But I'm not a big circus fan in general so maybe it just wasn't really up my alley. I did like the details in the wall murals and red velvet drapery that made me think of Cirque du Soleil.  We quickly decided that the lunch special was the best deal - an appetizer, entrée and dessert for $18.95. I went with the brie and pear appetizer, which was by far the best part of my meal. Atop a crispy little toast square, a thin slice of brie melted atop some delicate pears and honey, with some greens on the side. Others who were less afraid of the heat ordered the French onion soup, which looked amazing as well. For my entrée, I went with the salmon, which comes pink in the middle with some lentils. It's a pretty underwhelming salmon, but a good choice if you want to go a bit lighter. I really wished I had gone with the burger, which looked and tasted incredible. My dining buddy ordered his medium, though, and it came very rare, so be sure to ask if they tend to over or undercook. My true top choice would have been the moules frites, but they were out -  I heard that this business is scheduled to close very soon, so perhaps they didn't want to invest in another shellfish shipment? For  dessert I would have typically gone with the crème brulee with no question, but due to the hot day, I decided to go with the sorbet trio,which included pear, mango and raspberry. I would have loved some more original flavors but I found the pear to be very refreshing and familiar-tasting, almost like a frozen applesauce. This place is enormous and I'm not surprised that it's difficult to keep running. But on the food front, Marche is amazing and I hope the minds behind it are on to new things that are just as delicious.",0.9984,0.757,0.216,0.027,0.6084689487467264

2010-03-29,4.0,"High on concept and aesthetic wow, KDK Restaurant's 17-year old Marché has seen its surroundings go from a ""what are you thinking by coming here"" mindset to a high-rent district for commercial businesses and residents.  What hasn't changed over the years, thankfully, is the inviting and playful feel of the place, along with its very fine cuisine and service.  Right away, upon entering you're hit with an eclectic, contemporary Frenchyness.  Looming red upside-down lampshade lighting fixtures and umbrellas hang from the ceiling while the walls are decorated with artifacts and images recalling the Parisian experience over the past three centuries.   My wife JJ and I ordered starters.  Her lobster bisque with crab was heavier on tomato than cream than usually expected, but delicious nonetheless.  My escargots, soaked in a decadent butter sauce topped with bread crumbs, were tender and flavorful. On to our Plats Principaux.  JJ's swordfish was a satisfying fillet with a bed of fingerling potatoes.  I had Marché's signature lamb shank, slow-cooked in a white wine sauce for 24 hours, accompanied by créme fraîche whipped potatoes and seasonal vegetables.  That the servers provide a steak knife for the lamb is a mindless exercise.  The meat separates onto the fork in mouth-watering bite-size meaty chunks.  But here's the caveat...  My only wish was that the lamb (and the swordfish, for that matter), pulled back on the saltiness a tad.  The shank portion offers an ideal fat-to-meat ratio, and, when cooked as well as Marché does it, really only needs a hint of seasoning to complement its rich taste.  Too much salt muffles the nuances of the meat, and why do that when the meat is so good?  Now I'm a self proclaimed salt nudnik, who opts for chips over cookies any day, but here I'm saying leave the excessive salt for the stuff that really needs it (fast food, crunchy snacks, pommes frites, et. al.), and show a little reserve for the delicate items.  Nevertheless, I cheerfully wolfed the lamb down. Dessert (banana bread pudding) - fantastic; service - friendly & unobtrusive; prices - really decent for the quality. Highly recommended (while keeping a vigilant eye out on the salt issue in future reviews).",0.9949,0.828,0.155,0.016,0.5532267573696144

The service was good and the waiter told us there was a ""cake cutting"" fee for the cake we brought. We had no choice - so we said fine. The bill came out and they charged us $25 (ten people) to cut and serve the cake ... almost as much as the cake.

These things contribute to my overall rating.  Nearly 4 years later, we bought the ever popular Groupon. We used it on a Friday night. For starters we ordered the split pea soup (special of the day) and the apple and endive salad. Both were quite tasty.  But come entree time, we were very disappointed. I ordered the sherry-glazed salmon with roasted brussel sprouts, smoked bacon, and celery. The salmon was very well seasoned. The celery was mush. The brussel sprouts were good. The bacon was mostly just FAT pieces. The main problem was the amount of oil on the plate. It was disgusting - everything was dripping in it. They seemingly cooked with it AND poured it over the plate. What appeared healthy in print was not at all the case. My husband ordered the Bistro Steak with grilled asparagus.

We started off with the escargot and squid and arugula salad.  I loved both and the appetizers were definitely my favorite course: they were a great portion size to share (or devour yourself) - the breadcrumb buttery/garlicky sauce that surrounded the escargots were quickly soaked up and chowed down with bread. The squid was really well paired with the arugla salad (or it could be just me because i am in love with the bitterness of arugula against seafood or prusciotto at the moment).

The scallop entree was cooked perfectly with the Israeli couscous being rich and creamy. The raspberry peach cobbler dessert was rustic and well-balanced without being too sugary sweet.",0.9789,0.744,0.227,0.03,0.7142424242424243
2010-01-29,4.0,"I've been to Marche many times and I always think the food is great. The service has been hit or miss a few times but the au gratin and whipped potatoes make up for it.  This time around I took my husband, our one-year old, and a co-worker in from DC. We ordered a bunch of sides for the baby - the beets, the spinach, and the potatoes. The sides were a great value - $3-$5 each for enough food to feed all of us.  We ordered the French Onion Soup - I'm a compulsive French Onion Soup orderer, and it was not as oniony as I would've liked. But what it lacked in onion, it made up for in cheeeese. Yum.  Each of the adults ordered a beef dish - steak frites and the filet mignon special. The frites were extra crispy and perfectly salted. The steak was very peppery and delicious. My husband enjoyed his filet mignon but felt it was slightly over priced.  All in all, Marche is a nice treat. This time around, the service was great.  My only niggle is that the bathrooms, while beautifully decorated, don't have a baby changing station. I know I know, we breeders are always trying to take over everything, right? Well, it's a small detail that would make the experience nice for everybody without infringing on the people who don't bring their children to upscale french restaurants!",0.9963,0.768,0.227,0.005,0.5614087301587302

Someone recommended this restaurant to her and she was really excited to go. I didn't read any reviews prior to going, I just knew from word on the street that it was really  ""nice."" And ""nice"" it was. We  had a 7:15 reservation and were seated right away. The restaurant was really busy for a Monday night with several large groups and many couples.  We were set up with bread and water right way and soon thereafter our server came over, I ordered a glass of pinot grigio and eagerly listened to the specials. The best value seemed to be the prix fixe--any appetizer, entree or dessert for $29. I chose the apple and endive salad which was solid; the grouper  which was served on a bed of cubed butternut squash, rutabagas and parsnips . The grouper was rather dry but the vegetables were very good and packed with flavor; and for dessert I chose the profiteroles which I didn't really like too much. The texture was just weird and I think I was expecting them to taste like beignets for some reason.  My friend had the grilled squid which was delicious; the scallops and the trio of chocolate. All of her dishes were great and I stared at her food longingly the entire time and wished I ordered what she had. I'm sure she wanted to slap me. The restaurant is beautiful and sports a Mardi Gras-esque theme and the staff is very friendly. Unless I am invited there again, I won't break my neck to return.

We were presented with menu and our server informed us that on Monday and Wednesday nights there was a prix fixe menu available for $29 that included any appetizer, any entree, and any dessert on the menu.  He said that the daily special was a filet mignon and that this was included in the prix fixe as well. We decided on the escargots and the apple and endive salad to start.  Both items were nicely prepared, but the flavors were unremarkable. For our entrees we had the filet mignon special and the sherry glazed salmon.  The filet mignon was ordered medium rare and was served medium.  The meat had an unusual texture in that it was stringy and possible to cut with a fork (like shredded beef) instead of tender and juicy.  The salmon was also cooked too long.  The sides served with the entrees, including the mashed potatoes with the filet and the brussels sprouts with the salmon, were both very flavorful. At this point I would have given the restaurant three starts, but what happened next brought it down to two.  The dessert menu was noticeably lacking several of the desserts that I had seen on the online menu (and that had gotten me excited for the meal).  When I asked the server about this he said that these items were not included on Monday and Wednesday nights as this was when the prix fixe was served.   Excuse me, but what happened to everything on the menu being included?   We ordered the raspberry and apple cobbler and the caramel chocolate cheesecake.  The cobbler was overly sweet (and tasted as though it was out of the microwave) and the cheesecake tasted as though it had been frozen.  For a couple that often considers dessert their favorite course, this was the first time in awhile that we left a large amount on our plates.

They were telling the truth.  We started with the pear, endive & walnut salad that was so good, I would have been happy ordering two more for our main course then calling it a night.

Having studied abroad in Italy, I've had fantasti gnocchi in my lifetime. This was pretty good but they totally turned it into a french dish - the sage butter cream sauce was heavy on both the butter and the cream and the gnocchis were very dense and heavy.

The mostly-absent server warned my dining partner that the lamb was served ""medium-rare,"" which is expected, and then served up something extremely well done. Jeff likened it to cafeteria food -- and that's exactly what his meal looked like. I got the pork chop, which sounded delicious and fall-focused with fennel, granny smith apples and a sweet potato puree. The sweet potato puree tasted exactly like baby food. The pork chop was fine, but I think I've grilled better. The fennel was the best part of this meal by far -- and also the smallest part. The desserts also left something to be desired: the apple-raspberry cobbler featured julienne-style apples that made it really mushy.

PRIX FIXE: Here's the deal. For Marche', their Prx Fixe allows you to choose ANY appetizer, ANY entree and ANY dessert from their menu- all for $28. Done and done. APP- Had the French Onion Soup.  So cheesy, rich and smoky onion flavored broth, and the bread at the bottom- divine.  I would so come back here again JUST for a bowl of soup.  (I don't even like French Onion Soup- THAT's how good it was.) WINE- Just had the house rose'. It was fine. ENTREE- Had the Pork Roti d'Alsace. Delicious.  Very very thick chop, yet cooked perfectly.  The potatoes and apples were delicious as well.  Dad had filet mignon, and said it was very good. DESSERT- Banana creme broulee'.  You can't go wrong. It was very very good.  Mom liked here MARCHÉ Profiteroles, Dad did not really like his raspberry apple cobbler. Our waitress was very good about answering questions, stopped by just often enough for us to feel taken care of but not bothered.  The place is colorful, dimly lit for ambiance, and has a lovely patio in summer weather. I'll definitely come back here, and for anyone looking for a superb dinner on a Monday or Wednesday- come try the prix fixe.  Best value for $28!!",0.9943,0.786,0.2,0.015,0.56025

My first thought was the chairs were soooo uncomfortable I could not lean back I felt like the top of the chair was poking me in my back..but hey it may have just been me.  Our waitress...Weird. The entire time she seemed preoccupied with something and just didn't seem interested in our table. She wasn't interested until the order of Ratatouille contained butter and my friend is highly allergic to butter. I mean SUPER where she needs to have an epy pin. The manager went out of his way to take care of my friend. He gave her a $50 GC to their other Restaurant Gioco and some sorbet. Our waitress then turned into super waitress constantly checking in on us, getting us refills on wine, and water. We are not sure if it was the waitress who didn't get the order right or a miscommunication between the waitress and the chef. I think they rectified the situation as best they could and it was obvious they felt bad about it.  After that fiscal died down I ordered the Curry Cauliflower Soup it was AWESOME!!!

First, no wait, which was amazing and great because we were starving. The decor is so fabulous. Like Carnivale but a little more red and toned down, but still lovely. Chairs are very comfortable and you're always looking around at the bold color on the walls and around you so you're never bored. My only complaint about decor: the backs of the chairs are small you so you can't put your purse on it and your coat lays weird too. So I was always watching my purse on the floor because it was sitting out in the walkway. Okay on to food. I got the truffle frites, which were amazing. Small portion but our group easily ate them and loved them. My main course was the gnocchi with mushrooms and cream sauce which was also lovely and very filling. The gnocchi was tasty and it went well with the mushrooms and sauce too. My friend got the boulabase, which was also tasty and had great color. My other friend got the steak fries and the steak was perfectly cooked with a great sauce too. For desert, we split the creme brulee and trio of chocolate. The creme brulee was really tasty and the trio was truly divine. The mousse was fab, the flourless chocolate cake was great too and the white chocolate ice cream was TO DIE FOR. It was SO tasty.

The chairs in the front room are metal legs, so when someone moves there chair on the stone floor it sounds like someone scratching there nails on a chalk board. This ruined the restaurant for me...maybe the owners could invest in some felt pads for the legs, so the terrible sound is not heard by all of the diners. My favorite part was the staff sliding the chairs across the floor to arrange tables and not caring if they were disturbing the other diners...I guess they must like the sound. I know I did not.

2009-09-15,3.0,"""The World's Most Useless Review, or Thank You For Summer Afternoons"" by Reuben H. When anyone ever asks me what my favorite season of the year is- I tend to rely on Fall.  To me, Fall is the time of the year with the most drastic change.  Or at least it is most noticeable.  But then I get to thinking that Fall really isn't all that great.  My sinuses are ravaged for one thing.  Sure, there are a couple of nice weeks tucked in between summer and desolate winter, but all-in-all, Fall ain't all that. Spring then pops to mind and truly is a lovely time of the year.  After months of those ghostly gray skies, dealing with the slush and the cold, not to mention the fact that the dry air wreaks havoc on my fragile baby-like skin, Spring is a welcome sight.  Then again, spring isn't all that much nicer than winter for much of the time, and then after about a week of decent weather (and seemingly everyone in Chicago heading out in non-Winter clothing the first day the temperature breaks 40 degrees) and the very sudden and quick development of flora and fauna everywhere, Spring is just about over. In order to avoid argument with many of you- I will not be trying to argue Winter as the best season, though I am looking for reasons why.  You know, to help me try to con myself into possibly believing it is true, and only to keep my sanity through it. Which leads to Summer.  I used to hate the Summer.  The heat, the humidity, the failed expectations of having that perfect Summer.  It just never really lived up to all they hype.  There is always a sense of never getting enough done on those hot days and warm nights.  Added anxiety to someone who already causes enough in his own life is not welcomed.  Couple that with the fact that any temperature above say 75 degrees makes me sweat worse than some out of shape guy trying to run a marathon, and I have just given you plenty of reasons why I never really liked Summer. However, something grand happened.  A thing that changed my mind forever about the hottest of seasons.  It was a simple event- just lunch, but one that will have lasting ramifications.  I had been invited for lunch on an early Friday afternoon.   I really didn't think I would be able to attend, but now am very happy I did. For this lunch showed me what Summer is really all about.  It is about the lingering sense of the day.  You see, I had the longest lunch of my life that Friday afternoon at Marche with some really fun people.  The food was good, not great.  The place itself was good, not great.  The wine was in fact AMAZING and really added to the day I am sure.  But the people, and that sense of my day and my week ending right then and there, and just being able to step away from work and life in general to enjoy myself- THAT is what everyone should experience from time to time, and I can't think of a better time to do it than a summer afternoon. Marche itself, in my opinion, did not show me anything super special.  I remember enjoying the escargot.  I remember basically detesting the savory bignets, which were ""dusted"" (see: drenched) in cumin and were way too spicy for a starter in even the spiciest Indian restaurant.  I remember my steak being cold, and the frites that came with it pretty good.  Food-wise, Marche didn't deliver anything spectacular. I will give credit to them for allowing our table to linger well beyond the 3:00 PM lunch cut off time (even allowing us to order our dessert around 4:00 PM), and for offering quite a few really lovely wines.  Beyond that though- I need to give thanks and a special note to the host of this lunch that changed my mind on summer forever- Dennis.  Great job, and thank you! *For anyone that marks this review as Useful, I need to question your ability to reason properly.  In fact, this review is not Funny or Cool either.",0.9978,0.76,0.166,0.074,0.5830687830687832
2009-09-08,3.0,"Why do I use Yelp? How do I use Yelp? Or rather - why and how do I choose to write a review of a place rather than another? I guess I belong to the 'story telling' part of the crowd. Surely annoying to the ones who want a straight-forward account of my experience in an establishment but exhilarating, fun and entertaining for me (and hopefully for some others too).  I am not writing reviews of all the places I go to. There needs to be something, a little extra, hard to pinpoint, name or describe. But it needs to be remarkable enough to lead me to writing. I know - wow!!  Just cut it already miss L! My experience at Marche - albeit very pleasant - was clearly missing that little push-to-writing magic sparkle. But since I have been asked to...gonna try to make it happen anyway. There is nothing really wrong with it. The decor is clearly noteworthy even though totally at odds with the restaurant name....Marche invokes simplicity, rusticity, earthiness - loads of fresh produce exhaling their aromas and vocal vendors trying to sell them - not profusions of golds and reds more reminiscent of a Parisian cabaret than a ""marche en plein air"". But it IS nice. The company was excellent, and the quality of the wines we had was superb. As were the cheeses we shared at the end of our long, long meal - the kind that only exists (in my experience at least) outside of America.  A 4-hour lunch is a special treat, and it was really fabulous to indulge all the way. Service was efficient but cold and impersonal - in sharp contrast with the exuberant decor. Not a smile, not a laugh - classic French tradition, right?!? (cultural cliche - checked) Now the food.... The price is right. Under $20 for a 3-course meal is a good deal no matter what. The execution.....is not quite there. Even though I loved the escargots we shared at the table (sans shell but with all the required buttery goodness) I was not impressed by any of my dishes. The salad was so forgettable that I actually don't remember what it was comprised of....I just know it was overdressed. The mussels were on the parsimony side of the portion spectrum; one was undercooked - it happens but it usually leaves me a bad impression. Classic interpretation - with no twist. Nice fries though. The sorbets were good....like sorbet. They cannot make the trick when what you really want is a big chocolaty thing but they did have a nice fruity flavor. Their mission, right? So I might be spoiled by too many years of first-hand experience of French cuisine. I might even be too cynical - who knows? But Marche is not really my scene.

I'll let others comment on the food.  Three of the dishes I had I liked, two I didn't.  I should have taken my own advice and stayed with the fish entrée choices - they're always excellent at Marche, but I strayed and paid the price. In case anyone wants to know, our wines, after the Veuve Clicquot champagne, were all French:  a Domaine de Triennes Sainte Fleur Viognier, a Jean-Luc Columbo St. Joseph Rhone Syrah, and a Chateau Laurets St. Emilion.  All are on Marche's regular wine list.  Three of the cheeses were from the restaurant and three I brought in special for us.  From Marche we had French Camembert, English Shropshire blue, and Italian Tallagia.  I provided the Spanish Zamorano, the French Epoisse, and the French Comte.   As should be expected at a long leisure summertime lunch, the companionship is the most important part.  Fellow Yelpers provided that, which made it a great afternoon in spite of the lack of summertime sunshine.",0.971,0.833,0.127,0.04,0.411548273155416

2009-08-22,4.0,"Long, leisurely French-style lunch part deux.  I was fortunate enough to spend my Friday afternoon with the always wonderful Dennis S., Colleen C., Jelena Z., Aurore L. and Reuben R. And let me tell you, 24 hours later, I am still pleasantly full. Walking into Marche, I was shocked by how large the space is. High ceilings, bright colors, and a significant amount of seating--the place screams Jerry Kleiner, which I suppose makes sense. The kitchen area is nearly identical to Red Light--all open with an 'island' area where you can see delicious French entrees being expedited. I was quickly greeted by a hostess and later a server. The six of us were seated at a large round table near the front windows and the bar, where multi-colored jewel-toned velour chairs that reminded me of jesters awaited us. The manager on duty graciously seated us and let us know that he would be available for anything we needed. Things got started off with two bottles of Veuve Clicquot, followed by two bottles of a lovely white, a fantastic syrah and a bordeaux (I'm sure that Dennis S. will fill in the details that I'm failing to remember compliments of all of the champagne and wine that I consumed). We shared appetizers of salmon carpaccio (available only on the dinner menu) and escargots. The salmon carpaccio was topped with greens and was light, fresh and delicious. The escargots were pretty much the polar opposite--heavy, drenched in butter and garlic, crusty and wonderful. Crusty bread was placed on the table as well. And then the real fun began: the three course lunch. I selected French onion soup, steak frites and profiteroles.  The French onion soup was wonderful--and I can't stand onions! There was at least an inch and a half of madeira and gruyere cheese plus crouton on top of the bowl, so much that I spooned off at least a quarter of a cup of melty cheese and put it on the side of my plate.  The steak frites was enjoyable--the steak had a smoky, sweet sauce over it and was cooked perfectly medium rare. The frites were excellent--crispy and plentiful. The profiteroles were good, not particularly special, but met my expectations. The fudge sauce topping them was pretty amazing though. We wrapped up our already gigantic meal with a selection of cheeses and chutneys, some provided by Marche and others by Dennis S. I will, again, let him fill in the details. All I know is that they were all amazing! Our server, James, wasn't overly friendly or knowledgeable but pleasant. He earned major brownie points at the end of the meal when he whispered to me, ""There is a little bit of this white left--do you want to drink it?"" I looked up at him and said, ""What do you think?"" and he just says, ""Oh I know."" I suppose it is somewhat sad that my willingness to drink anything you put in front of me is that apparent, but I'm pretty happy about it. Be advised--after a few glasses of wine, the trip to the bathroom makes you feel like you are Alice in Wonderland. And be careful if you are in heels--it's a slippery slope to get to and from the back area of the restaurant! Oh and I have to give a shout out to their music selection--any restaurant that plays a rotation of The Killers and Muse is a place that I can respect.",0.9957,0.814,0.151,0.035,0.5494570420760897

I did not expect that from the look outside. Especially since the last french restaurant I went to was extremely pretentious. (I haven't eaten much french cuisine in my day--this must change) We didn't play around--we dove straight into the main course. I decided, just so I could taste as much as possible (and because I didn't want to put too much of a dent in my date's pocket), I would get an appetizer and a salad. I took the waiter's recommendations and went with the mushroom appetizer (name?? don't remember). Unbelievable. The sauce was amazing. The pastry at the bottom was tasty but it was the sauce that won me over. Then i got the beet salad he recommended. It was good but not THAT good. I was a little disappointed by the salad, to be honest. ""Art on a plate"" as my date described it.  I then, in the name of data gathering for my yelp review, tasted my dates Steak Frites.

This place is great for all occasions. There were many large families dining together, children, and then couples. The chefs are right there out in the open cooking at the entrance, which I always love. They had a lovely bar you could sit down at too. It was surprisingly empty, unfortunately.

2009-07-27,3.0,"Ah Marche...I remember it being a pretty good restaurant a few years back, when me and a couple of college buddies treated ourselves for a nice dinner. Flash forward a few years, I decided to go back with some friends.  How much could things have changed after all this time? The decor certainly remained the same.  Fun and colorful umbrellas and flea market pieces still adorned the walls and ceilings.  Given the openness of the restaurant, it is definitely a good place for large groups. In terms of the food, I tried to stick to classic French bistro selections that night: charcuterie for appetizer, bouillabaise for the main course, and profiteroles for dessert.   The charcuterie was good.  I especially enjoyed the headcheese. The bouillabaise, on the other hand, was a disaster.  Marche's version was flat, lacking the layering of flavors that typically makes a good bouillabaise.  I was also very 'disturbed' by big sliced pieces of carrots.  Not that I have anything against carrots, but crunchy is a no no for this dish, as if they were added more as an after-thought. Luckily, dinner was ultimately saved by the profiteroles, which I enjoyed quite a bit. My other friends seem to have better luck with their entrees.  I tried a few (pork shoulder, duck two ways, lamb shank), and they were all pretty good.  But who could have imagined that a French restaurant cannot make a classic dish well. I do think that the desserts are a very good value.  For less than $10, you get a sizable portion that is beautifully presented. My advise would therefore be to stay way from the boullabaise, and save room for the dessert.  Or maybe just order a bunch of different desserts.",0.9967,0.722,0.253,0.025,0.4411666666666667

Nice creamy sauce, the bacon was cooked slowly so almost sticky, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. Nice color, warm center. Like I said, appetizers are key, so the reason for 4 and not 5 stars, a bit of grit in one of my scallops. I know these usually come in big tins, but the line cook should give a quick rinse and pat dry before it hits the pan. This would eliminate any bits of shell/sand. I had the duet of canard- a confit leg and a seared breast over Israeli couscous and summer veggies. The confit was a bit stringy, but tasty and crisp skin. The breast was cooked skin-on and absolutely delicious.  The couscous was a bit bland. Could have used a more assertive broth to cook it . Haricots verts were nice young and tender, but the carrots were a bit blase. 2 orange supremes accompanied the dish, but should have been warmed through.  Dessert was good, if not a bit sweet.

For the main course, two of us (myself included) went with the special burger.  It was a patty stuffed with Port Salut cheese (seriously, I lived off of this stuff when I studied in Paris).  The burger was wrapped in bacon and topped with onion strings and baked apples.  The rest of the plate was piled high with fries cooked in truffle oil.  Mon Dieu!  The burger was enormous - its width far surpassed the size of a normal person's mouth.  I sawed away at it with knife and fork.  The burger itself was rather tasteless - had it not been stuffed with cheese it would have been interchangeable with a burger anywhere.  Is that why it was wrapped in bacon?  Hmm.  Gimmicky, but I love a gimmick.   The fries, however, were divine.  Utterly divine. The highlight of us picking away at this burger was when the manager came out to see that we really were girls.  Yeah, apparently this burger is generally only ordered by menfolk.  Glad I impressed you with my appetite (and my girth?  Oy).  I'll have you know, Mr. Manager, that I didn't finish.  At least in one sitting.  The burger is coming home with me to be the staple of meals to come.  And I'm not ordering dessert.  So there!

If I do this experience again soon, I would skip the overpriced martini's, while they were good it wasn't anything very special, just go straight for a bottle of wine.

Desserts are tre magnifique!  Traditional creamy creme brulee, a flourless chocolate cake, sinful profiteroles and other options I haven't had the opportunity or room to try.

Ive gone here a bunch with my boyfriend and have eaten many different dishes. But everytime I go i have to have the Escargot. Im addicted. Absolutely delicious.

2008-07-27,4.0,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise.  I have been on a bad run lately - eating at too many overpriced, mediocre quality restaurants - but Marche was quite good and very fairly priced.   We went to Marche for a 5:30 reservation on Saturday evening.  Obviously, the restaurant wasn't packed at that hour - but I still liked the atmosphere.  The decorations are kind of funky and quirky, but I really liked them.  We were eating with my Mom and one of her friends, and they were in town for the Jersey Boys.  Thus, it was important that we get in and out of the restaurant in two hours or less.  Our server did a nice job of pacing our meal.  We finished in almost exactly two hours.   We started our meal with appetizers/salads, and I absolutely loved the house salad that I ordered.  It was full of fresh greens and vegetables, and the house vinaigrette was absolutely delicious.  I tried my Mom's soup - tomato gorgonzola bisque - and it was fantastic.  I am not a fan of ""tomato soup"" per se, but this bisque was absolutely amazing.  For my main course I had the pork chop (listed under the house specials), and it was absolutely wonderful.  The pork was tender and flavorful, and it was served with a dijon demi-glaze that complemented the meat perfectly.  The plate also had ""onion strings"" and roasted potatoes; they were fantastic.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about our meal at Marche was the size of the portions - they were very, very generous for the entree prices.   Bread rounds and butter are served on the table, and pint glasses of water are also served with your meal.  The bread was quite good, and our water glasses were never allowed to reach the ""half full"" mark.  I know this is  a small point, but I was very impressed by how attentive the ""support"" staff was.  Finally, I found the Malbec ($9) to be a very nice glass of wine for the price.  Marche has about twelve to fifteen wines by the glass.  The prices range from about $8 to $13 or $14.  My Mom enjoyed her Chardonnay, which was $8.  For five entrees, five salads/appetizers, a side dish, one dessert, and six glasses of wine the total was $250.",0.9984,0.764,0.218,0.018,0.72475

However, this awe-inspiring spark of imagination gets lost in the food. Not that the food is bad--most items were decently good--but nothing on the menu inspires as much surprised delight as the decor would suggest. Most items are fairly straightforward, if not in concept at least in taste. Some entrees seem more a sum of well-done parts than a comprehensive dish. The more adventurous items (e.g. duck liver mousse on a toasted briocche with pearl onion marmalade) seem to miss their mark; they're more impressive on the menu than the plate.

My girlfriend had the chicken which she liked, but neither of us were oohing and aahing over our dishes. We saved room for dessert and, like my prior visit, I was disappointed in it. There was nothing special about either one and I felt like an idiot for continuing to eat it, thus adding calories for no good reason.  The service is spotty. The bartender serving on my first visit was brash and distracted. I'm pretty sure he could care less if we stayed or went. On the other hand, our table server was quite pleasant and attentive. Good luck rolling the dice here.  The music and prices were pretty standard for Chicago and a restaurant of this type.

Since Scuba Steve and I don't like to plan ahead, we had little time and few options for dinner before the Blackhawks game last week. We were both dressed pretty well ( considering we were about to attend a hockey game) so it seemed silly to waste our fabulous outfits on a more casual eatery.  So we decided upon Marche, since neither of us had been there (which is actually shocking to me since Steve seems to have eaten at just about EVERY freaking restaurant in Chicago. I guess that comes with being single in the City for 10 years).  We went on Wednesday night, so we opted for the prix fixe special. $28.95 for three courses - any appetizer, entree, and dessert (which is sort of a no-brainer, since one entree alone generally costs that much).  I started out with the pate, which was quite good, but could definitely serve 4 people. As an entree I had the rabbit, which came braised with vegetables and polenta (which is more what sold me than the rabbit itself). The rabbit was extremely salty (which they normally do with game to subdue the ""gamey"" flavor, but that's why people order game, isn't it? For the flavor?), but prepared well. I still ate almost an entire half of the poor formerly fuzzy creature.  Steve had ribeye ( I cannot remember his appetizer for the life of me) which he enjoyed.  Both had a few cocktails, glasses of wine, then realized that we were about to miss the first part of the game, which, if you read any of my postings/reviews/etc you know is a cardinal sin in my book. So we skipped dessert and headed over the game (the Hawks shut out the Wild, in case any of you were wondering the outcome of that game.

Then I ordered the Belgium waffle which is a wild boar stew on top of slices of Belgium waffles.  So yummy. Finally I ordered the flourless chocolate cake that was so rich, my husband had to finish it.   He ordered the French onion soup and the cheese was so thick and perfectly melted it gradually fell off the spoon. He also ordered the Steak/Frites and the steak was tender with the burgundy wine that somehow the chef got the juice of the steak involved in it so it wasn't too wine tasting. It also had some dollops of a cream (creme fraiche?) and the fries were shoe string and crunchy.   Our friend ordered the smoked salmon, egg, arugula salad and it was divine. He ordered the same entree as me but the dessert he ordered was Creme Brulee. Very good.  The ambience is decorated like a circus (even with colorful umbrellas hanging upside down) so it is pleasing to the eye and fun.  The chef's kitchen is right inside the restaurant which is cool.  The bathrooms are awesome the way they are decorated; each stall has a different shape and painted with circus themes.

Lots of low lighting, shades of red on drapes, wall coverings, etc.  My girlfriend Bernice came in with a headache, which got passed down to Cathy and then to me.  We blame it on the poor lighting combined with bad music. Terrible menu for vegetarian as every entree item has either meat, poultry or fish.   Bread and butter was very good.  Or maybe we were just hungry?  I went with the beet salad, and then the salmon.  Beet salad was good, but it's really hard to go wrong with beet salad. For the main course I had the salmon entree and made sure to ask for medium rare (from reading other yelp reviews, the salmon tends to be dry).  It was cooked in a butter sauce with asparagus, mushrooms and shallots.  It came out too rare... I felt like I was eating half cooked sashimi filet.  Cathy had the pork... she said it was so good she couldn't stop eating it.   For dessert we had the upside down apple tart.  It was very good.   The best part of the evening was the company.  I see my girls 2-3 times a month, so when we get together, we sit and catch up for hours... our servers left us alone for a good long time until we were ready to leave.  How great is that??  But the restaurant was about a third empty too...

My pike was supposedly in a saffron sauce, but I think it was just yellow-dyed melted butter. The fish tasted good without the sauce though! +2 for the deserts. I apologize to my dining companion who stupidly suggested we share and ended up with 1/2 of a profiterole and me still eating 2/3 of her creme brulee. +1 for the prix fixe menu! Only 25 dollars!

But the food, sadly failed to live up to my expectations.  It was bad. Our appetizers were lackluster (my duck was cold! can you believe it- and it was on the ""chaud"" side so I knew it wasn't meant to be cold) and our mains were so forgettable. Okay, my squab was pretty good, but it wasn't mind blowing. I say, stay home, and bake your own squab. The most terribly disappointing thing was the desert. I had the Chocolate threesome thing, and this was maybe the second time in my life that I did not finish a warm chocolate cake (first up, it wasn't WARM ENOUGH). My partner's banana bread pudding was soggy. Apparently, (as he so loudly declared) I bake a better one. Now my question to Marche is, do you have a faulty oven?  Or is it because your kitchen staff prepares everything in advance to cope with the crowds on Mondays and Wednesdays, and consequently  leaves the dishes standing cold? (my desert came a mere 4 mins after we placed our order- very telling) I say- if you can't maintain standards on a prix fixe night, then I want my money back.",-0.9312,0.831,0.057,0.112,0.584

As far as the food goes at Marche, it's all pretty awesome --- among my favorites are the French onion soup (best I've ever had --- and I've had a lot), the salmon, the monkfish and the steak frites.  The lamb shank is cooked well, but it's sometimes a little overly fatty so maybe avoid that one.  And the banana bread pudding is INCREDIBLE!  I don't even typically like banana-flavored things, but this is just awesome.",0.996,0.688,0.252,0.061,0.6267917267917268

We ordered our food and even ordered 3 bottle of wine- expensive ones too! So when the bill came out to about $700 for 8 people on a prix fixe menu night we were okay about it, but when we took a closer look on why the bill was so high, it was because they decided to charge us $25 for what they call an OPEN FOOD item- my friends birthday cake...and then they decided  they wanted to randomly charge us for another $25 for serving us the cake! If they told us from the get go that they would charge us for it, we might've been okay about it, but nothing in the sort was mentioned to us and I find that very tactless! So as with every other unsatisfied customer, I ask to speak to the manager and she gave me this reason: ""You should've known we would charge you for our services and that its like bringing in your own bottle of wine and having it uncorked for you!"" I told her that it didn't sound right to charge us to much, but I guess they felt it was necessary. But when we brought it to the attention of our waitress, she looked at the bill and told us ""sorry, we charged you double by accident""- meaning we should've only been charged $25, not $50, and TRUST me, it was no accident, they just assumed we would overlook it! BUT at $700, why would you want to lose such great customers over $ 25?!  BTW, I asked for a Medium rare steak and it came out well done.

2007-02-22,2.0,"It's hard to find establishments that not only has great food but also impeccable service - which is why it's all the more disappointing when you experience something quite the contrary from a good restaurant.  I was first introduced to this restaurant when a handful of Yelpers decided to take advantage of their Wednesday night prix fixe.  We all had a great time and enjoyed both a delicious meal and excellent service.  The experience was so good, in fact, that I've raved about Marche to just about anyone that would listen since.  This place drew a 5-star rating from me. My gf decided to go to Marche yesterday with some of our friends/family to celebrate her birthday.  Considering we first met at Marche and her birthday fell on their prix fixe night, what could be more appropriate? As usual, Wednesday nights are packed with patrons eager to sample the fare.  We were seated within a reasonable amount of time.  We felt rushed by our server (who by the way seemed like it was one of the hostesses doing double duty) to get our order in.  When we asked for a bit of time, she disappeared altogether.  We had to ask for a server several time before someone came to take our order. We felt it was only right to order a few bottles of wine to sip as we enjoyed our meal.  Since everyone was deep into their various conversations, I requested our server (hostess?) to leave the bottles of wine at the table and we'll do the pouring.  She bluntly overruled my request and responded with ""No, I'll pour the wine for you."" - maybe my wording should have been ""I don't want you to pour our wine, I'll do it myself?"" The food was excellent as usual as were the desserts to follow.  However, when the check came, we were a bit surprised.  They charged us $25 for cutting the birthday cake we brought with us - they DOUBLE CHARGED it for a grand total of $50 at that.  When one of our party confronted the management, they resolved the double charge.  However, several things were mentioned that bugged me: - You should know there would've been a charge (this cake cutting fee was never mentioned on your site or the menu, nor did our server mention this to us) - You were charged $2.50 per head (this isn't even a flat fee?  even corkage fees are per bottle, why wouldn't this be per cake?) - You are dining on fixed price night, of course we're going to charge for other things (I didn't realized you were doing us such a favor) Pardon my ignorance, I didn't realize that it was okay to nickel and dime us if we're dining prix fixe.  Being a birthday celebration, I'd have gladly shelled out the money for said charge but with no notice, we were completely blindsided - didn't appreciate that.  **I also didn't realize there was a minimum spending limit to be seen and treated as a regular patron of your establishment; besides, didn't we order 3 bottles of wine in addition to our meals?**  Although Marche still has excellent fare, the tactless way that management (and our server) handled the situation made me a bit ashamed to bring friends there.  I'm hoping this was a really off night; I probably won't be recommending this place unless I see some drastic changes.",0.9927,0.802,0.128,0.071,0.5374124064341455

As for dessert - bread pudding is seriously out of this world - not too sweet topped with pecan ice cream and carmelized banana chips - YUM!!  Oh, yeah - my friend had a $50 gift certificate off of $75+ purchase and we weren't sure if we could use it on prix fixe night but lo and behold, we could!  What a steal.",0.9993,0.641,0.334,0.025,0.5855382395382395

Last night at Marche with about 15 of us there.  Esme W.  Thank you so much for putting this together.  Joe our host can talk about the menu like it was some sort of Ernest Hemingway book, everything he said sounded so good.  I actually wanted to try everything on the menu but that would be piggy style. I ordered cous cous as appetizer. oh wow it was so good. Came with little pieces of lamb in it. There was so much of this I was almost full from just that.  Others ordered very interesting stuff, Esme and Molly ordered onion soup special, Maryanna ordered garden salad but ate most of my cous cous. There was so much of it, you could shared and still had some left. Oh by the way...  Did you see Maryanna C. last night?  Maryanna and Molly were having ""spill your drink contest"" or something. Cocktail or what do you call it? Martini? purple looking drink. Maryanna, you spilled it 3 times and your buddy Molly was doing the same.  hahaha.  Table was drowning with martini, looking like purple coloring table.  I got this big ribeye steak with glazed vegetables,  au jus was perfect, and meat was done so well.  I was so amazed at every presentations they made.  I couldn't help to see what others ordered.  Some ordered lemon fish thingy, most guys ordered meat like me, some ordered duck, and most interesting, Donna G. ordered a rabbit.  She was special alright, she had a big engagement ring on, it was really big and shiny, I saw it from least 10 feet away from where I was sitting.  She offered me to try some since I never had it before. I heard it taste like chicken?  I was sitting little far away, next time we need a roundtable.  Decor? oh wow, let me say it again, oh wow.  French style everywhere, this is like house similar to ones you see on MTV Real World.  Out of this world, holy cow.  I want one of those big mirrors in the back room. It was pretty loud in there and hot! No fan or air conditioning.  Kitchen was right there pretty close to dining tables.  Besides that, I saw many people having wonderful time.  Dessert?

2006-08-24,4.0,"I loved Marche!  I was so excited to try this restaurant, so thank you Esme for organizing our Yelp prix fixe dinner. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was nice.  Dim lights, funky decorations, parasols hanging from the ceiling.   The bartenders were nice and attentive (and very nice to look at!)  The raspberry kiss was the perfect start to the evening.   The food was great!  I had the pate appetizer, which was a meal all by itself.  Two big slabs of pate (one a pate mousse, the other was more of a meatier chunky style) with some mixed greens, two little blobs of mustard, mini gherkins, and some red stringy stuff that I think may have been candied beets.  Wow, I could have just eaten the pate and been perfectly happy.  But, no.   We had all had entrees coming.   My entree was one of the daily specials...two mini fillets with parmesan whipped potatoes, baby onions and mushrooms, sugared carrots, all in a burgundy reduction sauce.  Oh my lord!  If it were socially acceptable, I would have stuck my face into my bowl so that I could eat my meal like I was in a pie eating contest.   I was so full that I didn't want to eat dessert (which is a cardinal sin in my world) but I indulged anyway.  I had the Profiteroles.  Three warm cream puffs with vanilla ice cream inside and smothered in cream and chocolate sauce.  And then I went home to rub my tummy and drink some Alka Seltzer.   Our waiter was great!  He helped me decide which Pino Noir to drink, and he was right, and he graciously put up with all of our Yelp madness.  A big thank you to Joe!!   The only bad thing that I have to say about Marche was that it was very warm inside the restaurant.  They could use some ceiling fans to circulate the air.  That was the only bad thing and I can't wait to go back!  Not only was my meal fabulous (and cheap!) but everyone else's food looked great too.",0.9872,0.777,0.161,0.062,0.6350210084033614
2006-08-24,4.0,"This is going to be such a ""me too"" review. Ed, Esme, Amy, George and Jean have all made such good points already, that I have to echo their comments. First off, the room is cute as hell. It's a large open space with high ceilings and exposed beams, which give it a light and airy feeling. Lots of color and artwork, with hanging parasols and a variety of lighting fixtures, make it a little funky without being cheesy. The chairs are comfy, with little oval backs which are surprisingly supportive, but don't take up much space, which is good, because the tables are close together. Not so close that you feel like you're in your neighbor's lap, but close enough to make the room feel more intimate than it is. The open kitchen is a nice touch (I didn't really see it, since it was behind me), but it does make the room hot. As the night went on and the room filled up, it got that much warmer. As Amy says, that was the only bad thing, but enough people noticed it that I had to dock Marche one star. Sorry, Marche. Other than that, fabulous. The bar is easy to navigate, and the bartenders are very attentive. A little slow, but that may be because they have a lot of ground to cover. Also a little inefficient. I had a 20 down on the bar when my drink came, but rather than telling me how much the drink was and taking my money, the bartender put down the drink, walked away, rang it up, came back for the money, walked away again, and brought back my change. No skin off my nose -- I had my drink -- but it seems like some wasted effort. The drinks are pricey -- 10 to 12 bucks for a specialty or high end martini -- but pretty big. They're a decent value, as long as you don't spill them all over the table. (You know who you are.) On the other hand, if you have a few, it's easy to spend more on liquor than food. The food was excellent. I had the couscous, which, as Ed mentioned, came with lamb and what may have been baby fava beans. Or lima beans. Or really flat edamame. Tasty, though. Then the duck, nicely roasted (very moist and tender), served with wild rice and haricots vert (little green beans) along with a cherry sauce. Delish. To echo Jean, French? I don't know. But good. I had the tart tatin (caramelized apple tart) for dessert. Very good, and not as rich as the chocolate explosion [chocolate flourless cake, chocolate mousse and pots de creme (basically, chocolate pudding)] that was my second choice. Everything at our table -- and all the other tables I was spying on -- looking tasty. Our server did a great job of handling 14 hungry Yelpers. (Some of whom were actually yelping.) Very laid back and willing to explain things. No separate checks (company policy), which made divvying things up a little dicey, but he gave us a couple of copies of the check. Bus service was okay. The bussers were good at doing what they were supposed to do, but weren't very good at improvising. For example, we were seated at several tables pushed together, and didn't have enough bread plates. Getting more plates from the busser was a non-starter. Also, when martinis were spilled, it was up to the server to clean up the mess. I realize the busser may not have had enough English to carry out the first request (though I used my best restaurant Spanish: ""ms platos por favor""), but he should have taken care of the spill on his own. But these are minor quibbles, which didn't affect my enjoyment of the meal. (But which add up to that fifth star!) One last comment: dress. I was afraid I might be a little too dressed down with jeans (nice ones) and a polo-style shirt. Not at all. You should certainly dress nice, but you don't need to dress up. I saw a wide range of dress in the place. Whatever business casual means to you is probably appropriate. My business is just a bit more casual than some.",0.9975,0.82,0.139,0.041,0.515446735395189

My friend Laura B. and I stopped by Marche last night to celebrate our almost twin birthdays (hers last Sunday, mine TOMORROW!) and to take advantage of their awesome prix-fixe deal: any appetizer, soup or salad, entree and dessert for $25!  Can't beat it. Since we are growing into our little-old-ladydom, we reserved our table for 6pm, the earliest reservation you can score during August.  We showed up before seating time, but were happy to snag a spot at the bar to enjoy some cocktails--for me, a raspberry kiss martini (which I believe used to be called the much, much cooler ""Vampire Kiss"") and some french martini for the lady friend.  Very tasty--and very sad when I sloshed some out of my glass and onto my shoe.  Damn. We decided to indulge in the delectable goose liver mousse and pate, which were amazing.  I much prefer Marche's pate to Bistrot Margot's, and it was perfect with their warm crusty bread, grain mustard and addictive oniony marmalade.   Laura and I took advantage of the fillet mignon special: 2 good-sized medallions served with mashed potatoes, carrots and asparagus--simple fare, but expertly prepared... and what a serving size!  Not only did we have a bit of pate to take home, but we both left with enough fillet and accompaniments to repeat the meal at home... With the meal we had a jammy Australian pinot noir that tasted like currants and chocolate-covered raisins... very nice.  And after all that, we had our pick of multiple delicious desserts--the profiteroles for Laura and a berry tart for me, both of which were very good, but neither of which we finished. It was an awesome price for a fantastic meal in a spectacle of a restaurant.  I love the open kitchen and luxe richness of the decor.  The service was pretty good (4 star material), but Marche still gets 5 stars because my friend and I both received $50 gift certificates to Opera... I'm not sure if that's common or just because our server knew we were celebrating our birthdays.  Regardless, it was a great way to start the week--we'll definitely be back, but probably only during prix-fixe days... why pay full price for the same stuff when you can get such a good deal otherwise?",0.999,0.696,0.271,0.033,0.6024061169183121

The skatewing was awesome, as it is one of the few places in Chi-town where you can find this awesome fish on the menu. I highly recommend this dish, as it is relatively low carb and has an interesting relish of tomato, olive and green beans.

The best part was witnessing a proposal at the table next to ours and seeing the happy moment which reminded us all of the romance of V-Day!!  Regardless, of our deposit/reservation, they had overbooked and it seemed as though they had moved at least 20 additional tables in the restaurant to meet the demand. It was uncomfortably hot and the smell from the open kitchen was overpowering. The kitchen staff struggled to keep up with the orders and twice we had to send things back. I ordered crab claws and was brought one claw and one prawn which still had it's head on which always freaks me out. I really think they overcommitted to the secured reservations by still allowing walk ins and adding more tables.
