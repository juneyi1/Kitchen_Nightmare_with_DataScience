2015-12-19,1.0,"Recently I've attended a ""Network after Work"" event at The Brass Monkey.  What can I say - it seemed to be the worst networking space ever.  I chose to go to the event only because i know that The Brass Monkey has a lot of space inside and I was hoping for the great night.  So when I arrived to event i was greeted by an amazingly friendly hostess and had a great small talk with a women working at the wardrobe. That was the last good thing about the night.  These kind of events are usually attended by 50-100 people and all the space we got for networking was a tiny part of the restaurant by the bar. I didn't even manage to get a drink - it was way to crowded to walk around with a glass in my hand.  So, at the end of the day I just keep wondering - why The Brass Monkey management was so cheap and tried to keep 100 people at the tiny part of their restaurant?

2015-12-14,1.0,"While the restaurant itself is INCREDIBLE - the service was NOT. This review is solely based on my PRIVATE EVENT experience. I chose to host a group event at Brass Monkey and had a pleasurable experience in the beginning stages of my planning - amazing customer service, available for assistance when needed, quick on email responses, etc.  Upon arriving for our final meeting/walk-thru, we were left standing in front of the restaurant for 20 minutes with no response until someone finally answered the door. We were informed that our sales manager had just been fired and things were ""pretty crazy"". Things went downhill quick from that point - emails weren't answered, details that were discussed with our previous manager were lost - it was quite frustrating since we were only a few weeks from our event. After a quick phone call with our new manager, we were hopeful things were settled... but then on event day all things fell apart.  Upon arriving to set up for our event - all the doors were locked and no one answered the phone. Our manager showed up 45 minutes late to let us in for set-up - with no apology or consideration. She kept saying they had an event the night before that went until 3am, so everyone was really tired and running late!!(?) We were shocked to find dirty floors, broken glass, sticky tables, etc. We were left with 45 minutes to set up our entire event and had to do it around a custodian mopping the floors at the same time. It was a stressful morning that could have easily been avoided had they planned ahead. The most disappointing part was that NO one in the restaurant (except for an AMAZING server) apologized/expressed concern at all. Even when the general manager managed to show up (10 minutes prior to our start time), he didn't say a word about these issues. The food/drinks came out late - even after discussing the timeline with our manager 30 minutes prior. They did not set out the correct beverages and once they did bring out the correct drinks - they set sticky/dirty glasses with them. We had to keep asking for things to be replenished - food, drinks, half+half, sugar, cups... you name it. And when all things were going wrong, our manager was no where to be found. It truly seemed as if our event was a nuisance since they had a larger event the night before. Bottom line - until they hire a strong sales/events team, I would NOT recommend hosting a private/group event here. I have never experienced such poor customer service - especially when hosting a larger group event. Being in the event industry myself, I kept trying to give them the benefit of the doubt - but to no avail. The current sales manager is very inexperience and unprofessional - I hope they get things together because the venue itself is stunning.",-0.9554,0.802,0.083,0.116,0.5785408432147562

2015-11-13,2.0,My overall experience of this restaurant was not a good one. I arrived a little early for my reservation and the rest of my party was not there yet so I sat at the bar to order a drink. I asked for a drink menu and spotted something I wanted rather quickly. At this time the bar had probably 20 people in it but it was starting to fill in (6:30 on a Thursday). It then took about 10-12 minutes for the bartender to come back my way. He started taking other peoples orders who had just arrived. I finally had to flag him down to order a glass of wine. Upon ordering he ran my card and gave me the receipt for $56! He charged me for a bottle instead of a glass. He then came back with a $14 charge - of course I check my statement the next day and the $56 is not credited. I call back the next day (currently on hold for 15 minutes and counting). We finally sat down for dinner - there were maybe four other tables with people for dinner. Thankfully our server was a bit faster with the drink orders. The food was......just ok. Some of the dishes were a bit cold (meatballs) and the pot roast entree was about 75% fat. When a manager came by to ask how our meal was we mentioned it to her and she said she would let the chef know. At no point did she offer any type of discount on this terrible dish. The mac and cheese was pretty bland and nothing to write home about. The TV dinner is pretty good - great cobbler and sweet potatoes. The fries with the stank and frites dish were REALLY good. but not a good sign when the best thing you eat at a place is french fries. Lastly - the restaurant has a back door to it that leads to another venue. The staff and guests are constantly in and out and it causes a TON of cold air to come into the restaurant. My poor female clients I took to dinner had their coats draped over them the whole dinner and not one person on staff mentioned it. They ignored the fact that these customers were freezing. I had a reservation for here 2 weeks later with some friends which I canceled immediately this morning.  This is probably a good place to grab a few drinks (if you get a table) but I wouldn't plan an all out dinner here.,0.3717,0.829,0.082,0.089,0.4348238482384825

You might want to try this place with a bigger group so you can sample all of the fun appetizers and still (maybe) have room for your dinner since the portion sizes are pretty substantial.  I do think the space feels too big for the amount of seating they have, but I suppose not being privy to every conversation at surrounding tables is a good thing:)   Overall, I think it is worth a try.",0.9894,0.76,0.228,0.012,0.4422727272727272

2015-10-28,2.0,"We had dinner at Brass Monkey with friends and had a lack luster experience. Décor: This was the highlight of the visit. There is an obvious '70's theme at play and with the décor and music it really feels ""authentic"" (I'm guessing, from what I've gleaned form television and movies haha). It's very dimly lit but it really helps to set the mood and vibe of the place. There are a bunch of tables, but not ""TONS"", and there is a private room if you wanted to host a party there. Bathroom: Being downstairs, the bathroom was kind of creepy. When I visited it there was no one else down there and it was just too quiet. However, there are a number of individual bathrooms for both men and women and the fake Playboy covers on the wall are interesting. The bathrooms themselves are very clean and totally private. Staff: In a place that is themed like the 1970's we expected the waitresses to be a bit ""in character."" However, they seemed to all prefer to dress ""goth"" - nothing wrong with that, just found it odd. But anyway, our waitress was very nice and was always on hand when we needed her. They could have been a bit faster with refilling water glasses but it wasn't too noticeable. Drinks/Food: We started out at the bar (despite having a reservation we had to wait about 15mins for a table to open) and had a round of drinks. Naturally, many had Brass Monkeys but there were a few beers and a Blanton's bourbon (NICE!) mixed in. After we were sat we started with a ""Balls Sampler"", the meatballs and the cheese ball (meatballs were tasty and the cheese ball was delicious!), and then moved on to the main course. We had a slew of TV Dinners (they were fun but a bit small on the servings and the Turkey Pot Pie was pretty dry), the Monkfish (very, very tasty!), and the pork chops (entirely overcooked and just not very tasty). We forwent dessert based on the apps and main courses, despite the options being semi-appealing. Value: Given the small portions and the lack-luster execution (and taste/preparation) I find the prices to be a bit lofty. It is always fun to try a new spot but sometimes there are misses...

2015-08-09,2.0,"Ah, the 70's.  The era that brought us disco, bell bottoms, platform shoes and some really crazy food that carried over from the 50's and the 60's also brought some really interesting designs many of which you can see at the Brass Monkey like mirrored ceilings, an interesting use of metals and a really campy bathroom waiting area (just wait til you go down there!)  And I like that you can go downstairs and find an album (yes, a record ALBUM) and bring it up and the DJ will play it. Very cool. From the people that brought us Untitled, I expected a lot in coming here, given good food, interesting spaces and good service are the norm with this group.  After all, Untitled is that place that people line up to get into the speakeasy vibe.  And the Brass Monkey has the same potential.   This location in the W Loop is just waiting to pop with Google soon to open, a hotel opening next door and the cool venue space that the Brass Monkey shares with Morgan Manufacturing, a huge venue space that it's attached to that takes up the whole block. And the best news?  There's a HUGE rooftop with some amazing views of the city (private parties only right now). Pretty impressive. What wasn't impressive was the service or the food on the night we were there.  The only guy that seemed to get it right was Tony, the valet who was actually anticipating what we needed and brought the car around unasked. Other than that, it was a disaster.   Our server was new to the place but a seasoned server, or so he told us.  Then he disappeared and didn't bring us our drinks for 45 minutes.  When we went in to see if they just lost our order (we were seated on the small patio out front) the manager came out and said he would get the drinks.  When the server came back to get our food order, we still didn't have any drinks.  He blamed it on the manager.  At this point, given we were sitting in the sun, we didn't care who's fault it was, jut bring us our drinks! As for that food, it was just okay.  I had the steak frites, pretty basic but cooked properly, my friend had the mussels, we shared the ""Cheese ball"" (needed more crackers) and my friends tried to have the Brussels sprouts but they brought asparagus instead and the fish sticks never showed up. The cheeseburger was fine and the tuna salad was okay. Meanwhile, we had no drinks to go with the meal as the server disappeared again. The manager tried to make it right by saying he would comp the drinks, but it was just not to be on this night as we ordered dessert (clearly we are gluttons for punishment) and those never showed up either even after we were given a tour of the entire place and came back.  Still no dessert.  So we cancelled the dessert given we just had no more time to wait. By this time we had been here for almost 3 hours so we asked for the bill so we could just get on with our night.  And the final injustice? The change was wrong but who wanted to wait to make it right?  No one. It was worth the $6 just to get out of there. Great potential for this space.  But for all this drama on a Saturday night, I doubt I'll be back until they get the bugs worked out.  Just hoping it doesn't take so long to fix that it turns into an 80's restaurant!",0.9545,0.818,0.111,0.071,0.5084418072349106

Everything was as expected, even the great flavor of the pasta dish and the fact that the pasta stuck together.   However, we requested a liqueur that the bar did not carry (Understandable.

2015-06-14,3.0,"So, this is how I feel. If a restaurant is out of the way with nothing else around it, which means that people need to make an extra effort to get there, the food had better be the best (or one the best) within the 4-5 block radius. This is how you set yourself up to be outstanding. If the location is out of the way, but there's amazing food, people will come and return again. Brass Monkey is still in the Fulton Market area but out of the way from the main area with nothing else around, however, the food was not greatly impressive. We tried the beef carpaccio, tuna waldorf, grilled calamari, meatballs, fettucine, and arctic char. The standouts among these items were the calamari and arctic char. Even so, they were great, but did not wow. So let down by the fettuccine - many of the noodle strands were stuck together. Boo hoo. And the taste was bland.

For some reason, when the restaurant is kind of empty, its hard to get really excited about it. Maybe it's because of the obscure location or maybe it's because people don't want to eat food inspired by the 70s, but something needs to change here. Although, the decor is fantastic!  The food itself was not mind blowing. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and they were very well portioned. We got brussel sprouts, Mac n cheese, grilled calamari, fondue, and a lyonnaise salad. No complains about the food. The drinks here need some work, tried two different ones and they tasted almost identical like sour skittles, super sugary.

I was thinking it was going to be an upscale grown up version of a tv dinner with meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The meatloaf wasn't bad but everything else just seemed kinda bland and I almost felt like I was eating a real tv dinner.  It is served on a cool TV dinner tray with the separate compartments so I don't really regret ordering it.  Other than that we also got the fondue, which was pretty neat.   If you're really into that retro 70's vibe, I'd check this place out as it was the highlight of our trip.  Or you could go just to say you ordered a tv dinner because that's pretty much half the reason I went in the first place.  Overall I'd say the food was just ok though.",0.9894,0.796,0.184,0.02,0.5480994152046783

2015-05-29,2.0,"Having a pretty equal distribution of one to five star reviews, I feel I'm pretty qualified to say don't eat here. Even though I was only alive for a few months in the 70s, l believe their interior decorator did a fantastic job in creating an authentic environment. The chairs, the floor, and the tables are what I'd expect to have seen in the 70s.  And I appreciate how the menu is slanted to the 70s. Here's the food we had: * Fish sticks: Who wouldn't order fish sticks in a yuppy place like this and expect amazingness? Lately we've given the hipster touch to fried chicken, cupcakes, tamales, and marshmallows...why would we leave out fish sticks? These were decent, but devoid of flavor (or heavily relied upon the sauce with which they are served). * Boar meatballs: I'd say these were the highlight of all food items. They were tasty. * Fondue: It was fondue, and a good thing we ordered it because it worked well to give the fish sticks some flavor. * Duck: We were told this would be medium rare; it was medium at best. Some decent flavor here, and probably the best main course of the meal. By no means, however, would I crave it. * Skirt Steak: Ordered medium rare, came out medium-well. The fries were good, though. Yay for fries and (Heinz) ketchup. Heinz ketchup...really? Come on, no restaurant worth its salt uses industrial ketchup nowadays. It probably was the kind with HFCS but it was in a ramekin so that counts for something, obviously. * Double cheeseburger: In fairness, the patties were thin so to get medium-rare is tough...but it lacked flavor.  * Flourless chocolate cake: From what pre-packaged provider did they get this? There was nothing fresh about it, and even worse, the exterior was room temperature at best, but the middle was steaming/scalding hot. To me, that screams...microwave. Yes, microwave! I would never, ever recommend the food here to a friend (or enemy), and it's a shame because I've had some decent meals at Untitled -- the same folks behind Brass Monkey. But when food sucks, I turn to the other menu....cocktails. I really enjoyed my ""Tang,"" and the wine list was thoughtfully assembled.  If somebody said, ""we're having drinks and meatballs at Brass Monkey, I'd go."" If they said, ""wanna have dinner at Brass Monkey,"" I'd turn around and run away as fast as I can.",0.9943,0.787,0.161,0.052,0.511788617886179

For my main, I ordered the Seared Tuna salad and the veggie cassoulet. I really liked the salad. The tuna was cooked perfectly. They should think about making it bigger and adding it as an entree option! The cassoulet wasnt that good only because I dont like rosemary and it was ALL i could taste. Probably because I dont like rosemary! My boyfriend got the duck and he thought it was really good. Again, a bit of a smaller portion, but he really liked his.

You can take your pick from the 1970's menu or flip it over for a more contemporary menu.  Choose between the Cheese Ball or Fish Stix or the Sears Foie Gras. I love the names on the 70's menu (Just the Tip - describing an asparagus dish). Through the eleven of us, we ordered a good amount of the items. The popular choices turned out to be the Roasted Salmon. It looked like a good sized piece of Salmon with a lot of accompaniment. I chose the Mushroom French Bread Pizza. It is great for one person with four large pieces. I changed up the cheese and went with Mozzarella (I cannot do blue or goat).  I enjoyed the flavors and essence of truffle oil.

2015-03-23,3.0,"It was pretty good. I kind of wish they would just switch the menu over to all ""Hits of the 70s."" As it is, I'm not really sure what the theme is -- the front of the menu has a sort of random assortment of trendy dishes, classics, French, Spanish, Italian, and American foods. But then we would miss out on what we thought was the best dish of the night, the squid with boar sausage and tomato sauce. The fried brussels sprouts were pretty standard (though seasoned well), the ""baloney"" sliders were good and rich, the cheese ball does indeed taste like your aunt's famous cheese ball (which isn't a bad thing -- we ate the whole thing), and the ""TV Dinner"" short rib meatloaf was tender and flavorful, although I'm not sure it was enough of an upgrade that I would order it again. The mushroom ""French Bread Pizza"" tasted like a truffle flatbread you could get anywhere these days, which is too bad, because a pizza on a nice, thick, chewy piece of house-made French bread sounds tasty and would be something different. The bananas foster pudding was excellent -- highly recommend. Cocktails tended to be potent, if a little one-note at times (the special of the night tasted just like Country Time Pink Lemonade), though the Chicago River Water was the highlight -- surprisingly complex and sophisticated. The (gigantic) space looks great and the servers were always warm, friendly, and helpful. It's still fairly new, so I'm sure the menu will evolve. I would give it another go again in the future -- based on the other reviews it looks like we should have tried a few of the other dishes.",0.9959,0.758,0.217,0.025,0.5147994227994228

Then called day of to make sure they could make sure they understood my special dining need.  Excellent customer service and I hadn't gotten there yet. I began with:  Tang martini.  Sweet but not.  Reminder me of a cider but not of apples.  Plus it had tang on rim. tang! Then Frois appetizer-- just a bit of heaven in your mouth.  I would take a bit. Pause a just close my eyes and enjoy.  Ahhhh. Fried escargot-good.  A bit strange for those used to more traditional preparations.  Glad we tried but probably won't repeat. We split the lobster bisque which was hot and both filled with lobster and the right balance of sherry. Squid ink pasta-- scallops so tender they melted like butter in your mouth, shrimp you could cut with a fork.  Wish they had free refills on this dish! My friend ordered the Duck breast. It was a perfect mid rare.  My friend said it put her in heaven.  For dessert my friend had S'mores and I had the flourless chocolate cake.  Both made the end of the meal perfect.  The pistaschio gelato with the chocolate cake made me speechless. Michael the beverage manager was so friendly and checked in on us.  Amazing customer service.  I want more people to experience the derive that he and Daniel the associate/assistant?(sorry Daniel) and their team have put together a well oiled machined. And I can't forget to mention our server Brendan.  From the start he was friendly, knowledgeable of the bar menu and able to make great drink recommendations.  He new the menu inside and out and was able to answer questions.  He even suggested we split the bisque since we were having 2 appetizers. And then at the end he brings the bill and the desserts were comped because we told them we were celebrating our birthdays.  Had no idea it was coming.  It was a real classy surprise.

Loved the ambiance.  70s but not over the top.  Large enough to have room to wait at the bar for your table and not be cramped.  My husband and I split the truffle mushroom pizza, which was wonderful.  Our  friends got the fish sticks and some salad (sorry I don't recall) but both really like it.

2015-03-18,5.0,"Fantastic, really a cool place that I will definitely be back for round two.  The service was spot on and our server Sarud was amazing, along  with his suggestions which were perfect.  Just a side note the portions are quite large for what most of Chicago farm to table serves, so definitely able to share.  For libations we ordered the the old fashion and a Tom Collins which were as just what one would expect, strong but not ridiculous boozy.   For starters we got the Swedish Meatballs which were so good served in what seemed like a pork/beef lingonberry berry reduction sauce which I could have had literally ate by the spoon alone!  Salad course was baby spinach with beets that was spot on.  Not over dressed and perfectly sized pieces of the beets with cheese that did not over power the whole salad. For the main course the Duck breast over creamy polenta was (cue Homer Simpson) Mmmmmmm  mouth watering good.  Perfectly seasoned cooked to a perfect medium rare.  As I am righting this I am thinking about going to get another plate of this. Sides: The brussel sprouts were good, I am not to sure how to rate sprouts as most are roasted and its about as difficult to judge as long as they are not a complete disaster.   The Fries were so good and the dipping sauce was again I feel like I am on a broken record here but super tasty.  The Mac and Cheese well my friends if you love super creamy packed full of cheesy goodness than this is the place for you.  I could see my self gaining at least 10 pounds next winter eating this alone.  Now my favorite part of every meal is the Dessert:  A Pineapple Cake!  Yes Yes YES.  Again so good, and with the ice cream portion added on its just so good.   I can not really stress how large the portions are because we were two people and we still had a bag of leftovers to take home and have for lunch the next day!  So either we eat like birds or this place actually gives normal portions which we have not been accustomed to in chicago in a long time. Overall the atmosphere is quite 70's but with a twist on a bit of modernism.  It is a huge space and they have even more space for events, and weddings.  I thought the music was good spanning mostly 70's rock and disco to early 80's classics.

2015-03-08,2.0,"Serious flaws in execution ruin an interesting concept and enticing menu. My significant other and I tried out The Brass Monkey early on a Saturday evening, in hopes of expanding our restaurant list.  Here's my thoughts on the features of this new West Loop restaurant. 1) The space: unique and inviting, although the music was a tad loud at times and it appeared the DJ was schizophrenic, since he or she kept changing songs (and volume levels) midstream. 2) The service: As noted in earlier reviews, our waiter (Curtis) was intense.  While I appreciate the attention, sometimes less is more. 3) The food: This is where there's serious flaws.  I ordered the TV Dinner, which was actually kind of cool and well executed (although for an expensive price).  My significant other ordered the Braised Short Rib.  Honestly, they should rename this dish Pot Roast, because it definitely does NOT remind me of a short rib.  We also ordered The Sloppy Joe Sliders and Swedish Meatballs.  The Sliders were pretty good, but I'd skip the Meatballs.  Finally, dessert.  We ordered the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, a dish so bad I almost cried.  The pineapple was bland and could benefit from some caramelization, and the shredded coconut contributed to a chewy texture.  The store-bought ice cream on top of the cake was depressing.  Curtis mentioned the chef had recently retooled the recipe, and I'd say more retooling is necessary. 4) The drinks: The only redeeming feature of our experience.  I enjoyed the Tang and the Chicago River Water was a cool twist on The Aviator.   It's obvious to say this restaurant did not make our list.  Considering all the other options in the West Loop area, there need to be significant changes to bring this restaurant up to the bar of other nearby establishments.",0.8961,0.828,0.117,0.055,0.6233225108225108
2015-03-07,5.0,"We try to find new places to try every month. This will definitely be our new ""go-to"" favorite!  fabulous service, food, and decor.

Ben the bartender knows his stuff and introduced my husband to a scotch he'd never had before.  Nicole and Michael (managers?) came by to make sure all was well, as did a couple of other servers. We were lucky to find find free parking (we got there early on a Friday). It's only been open a few weeks, but was quite popular the night we were there. There appeared to be a work group there and I'm going to try and get my business to host an even here as well.  We get off work early so it's great that they were open for bar service at 4 and the kitchen opens at 5. Cool bar - absolutely awesome bathrooms (I have a thing about public restrooms). We had the amish chicken - moist, flavorful and not overly spiced.  Lobster bisque was not the pink heavy creamy type I was expecting and the flavor was out of this world. There were little brioche rolls floating on top of the dark bisque with nice chunks of lobster. We shared a side of the herb fries and incredible brussel sprouts.  We finished with flourless chocolate cake with pistachio ice-cream.  The plate was clean when we were done.  My husband had the amish chicken and I didn't get to taste the kale(?) that was served with it because he was guarding his plate like a prisoner by this time. The wine pours were generous.  Great value for the price when many other places are doing the ala carte thing (total rip-off).  The total bill was half of what we paid elsewhere a couple of weeks ago for much less.   We will return to try the 70's munchies and several other things that look delectable on the regular menu.  No need to find a new place any time soon.",0.9963,0.785,0.195,0.02,0.5678237194903861

After heading to the bar to wait for our table; we sat, on stools, at the bar for 15 minutes with no bartender even stopping off to ask for our drink order. Only after alerting the manager did a bartender come by to take our order 3. 40 minutes after our reservation and noting that there were 4 open tables on the floor, we were offered a table right in front of the door.

2015-03-06,5.0,"Terrific new place a little out of the way past the main randolph/fulton's market area.  TL;DR version, very friendly and assertive staff, The food was spot on, fun ambience. The decor is low key so that you feel comfortable walking in from the Chicago cold in your bundles and layers. But this would definitely be a nice date night restaurant as well. We tried the sloppy joes (lamb), lyonnaise salad, lobster bisque, and creamed corn. I would recommend each of these dishes. Note that the sloppy joes ARE made of lamb and they do taste that way, although not gamey. The Lyonnaise salad with a fried egg was a nice way to do a warm salad. Lobster bisque comes with croissant like pastry puffs on top and balanced out the broth nicely. It was light, with just the right amount of lobster flavor. Creamed corn was excellent. Not too creamy, but with a hint of cheesiness that reminds me of grits, either way, DEFINITELY recommend that as a side. For dessert we tried the pineapple upside down cake, which was DELICIOUS. A moist cake full of coconut that really enhanced the texture. Pineapples tasted fresh and not too overly cooked. A really nice finisher that made you feel content with your meal. For drinks I would say... cherry flavored cocktails tend to taste like robitussin everywhere so i don't fault them on that... Also staff is super super friendly, likely because it IS a new establishment so they are likely on their toes to make sure they can get as much feedback as they can.

It's large and spacious, perfect for the growing neighborhood. It even has a separate event space for people who want to host weddings, birthdays, etc there.  So now to the good stuff. I started with the SoCal 75 cocktail, which was served in a champagne glass. It had Brandy, Drambuie, and Cava and was totally balanced with bitters so it wasn't too sweet. The whole cocktail list looked great to be honest. And thanks to Katie who was practicing the new drinks. She did a great job for her first time making the SoCal 75!

No big deal though, the squid ink linguini brought me back to Barcelona, Spain. It had a delectable chili saffron cream sauce with scallops, shrimp, crab, and sundried tomatoes. It was a hearty serving and I ate all of it up in between chats with Jackie (another bartender) and Michael (the beverage director who shares a love of Bourbon with me).  The bar selection is extensive. They have a lovely wine list from which I ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon to pair with my pasta dish.  Then I saw the 70s menu.
