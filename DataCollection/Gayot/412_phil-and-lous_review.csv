2008-08-21,4.0,"Sadly, Phil  & Lou's is no more.  We've been going there since we moved to the neighborhood 4 years ago and suddenly they closed.  They always closed for a couple of weeks in August for vacation, but this year, they didn't open again.  Now it's going to be a place called Crossroads. We'll miss the broasted chicken and mashed potatoes!!!",-0.5684,0.903,0.0,0.097,0.5214285714285715
2008-07-02,4.0,Yummy gigantic asparagus & mushroom risotto. Extra dirty martinis. Warm welcome by owner & the fantastically friendly bartender. I'll be back.,0.8225,0.493,0.405,0.102,0.48333333333333334
2008-06-24,4.0,"I tried out Phil and Lou's with my boyfriend about two weeks ago. We sat outside around 4:30 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon. The outdoor seating is really nice, especially on a beautiful day. The place is a mix between American, Italian and a neighborhood spot. We ordered the steak tartare appetizer, which was delicious! I also got the tuna club; ahi tuna, with bacon, arugula, tomato, and a green herbed mayo. Yum!! I've been craving it ever since! My boyfriend got the fajita wrap. He said it was okay, but nothing to crave. I only deduct one star because the service was, although friendly, somewhat slow.",0.917,0.871,0.129,0.0,0.5227272727272727
2008-03-22,4.0,"Nice neighborhood dining option that is casual and has pretty good food.  I would consider the food to be more on the comfort, hearty side- my fiance really likes the Sunday Chicken or the steak and I like the rigatoni and their fish is quite good as well.   The service isn't great and the price is maybe a bit high not that inconsistent with their comparables.  If you are in the neighborhood it is a nice, low-key dinner- we always leave satisfied.",0.9733,0.654,0.301,0.045,0.7505555555555556
2008-03-09,4.0,"totally great if you live in the neighborhood, like i do.  my only other suggestion is if you're on the search for a fantastic hamburger, because i think they may have the best in the city, if you ask me.  however, yes, the service sucks.  i find the waiters completely irritating, and they always come when you don't need them and then disappear when you do.  i have several times gotten glasses with crunchy stuff on them.  yuck.  unfortunate because of the prices, which lean toward more expensive. but i like the food and the owner is really nice.  i wish he'd hire better waitstaff.  in the meantime i'll keep going.  the hamburgers are really good, i mean it.",0.976,0.718,0.227,0.054,0.61953125
2008-01-22,5.0,"My secret eating out spot.  never crowded, always tasty, booze is a bit overpriced.  They have the best buffalo chicken salad of all time, in fact its all I ever order.  So if you want something else, im not the person to ask.",0.6969,0.871,0.129,0.0,0.65
2007-10-10,1.0,"The food wasn't terrible, but everything else was.  The service was extremely slow.  We were constantly flagging people down.  Our cokes were flat.  Our water glasses had traces of dish detergent on them, and tasted like it.  Defnitely never goign back.",0.6158,0.886,0.114,0.0,0.35787037037037034
2007-08-21,3.0,"Eh.  Everyone always raves about the lobster mac 'n' cheese, but i find it boring.  You have to really look to find the lobster as well.  I think most items are a bit on the pricey side for how good they are.  I guess maybe sometime i would come here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice by a long shot.",0.5499,0.849,0.104,0.047,0.5055555555555555
2007-06-09,3.0,"We've got friends in the River West neighborhood, so whenever we need a place that is not over-run on the weekends, this is where we meet up. This neighborhood joint (from what it looks like from the outside), can sit over 100 people! The bar is nice and large with great bartenders and stiff drinks. The outside is pretty decent with wide sidewalks (just like Division Street). Food wise, all the portions are HUGE. We ordered the Sunday Baked Chicken with mashed potatoes and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. But man, it was $20! The last time we were here we ordered the NY Strip and the meatloaf. The quality is consistent, the service is strong but for comfort food with nothing too aggressive or creative on the mene, we were surprised by the pricing. The only reason we gave this 3 stars vs 4 stars is that this very good comfort food should not be priced to be $20+ for an entree and all drinks $7-9 and up.   Enjoy a nice appetizer and a few good drinks, but for the money, I would have dinner elsewhere.",0.9923,0.769,0.231,0.0,0.6315320910973085
2007-05-21,4.0,"I really liked Phil and Lou's.  A bunch of us were on our way to a game at the United Center and decided to stop in and try it.  When I walked in I expected it to be more of a sports bar, but the inside was all dark wood and candle light, quite cute.   I am a fan of any place that has 312 on tap so that was a nice surprise.  I had the lobster mac and cheese which was delicious, I would recommend this place just for that.  The bf had a sandwich as well as the mashed potatoes.  Can I please say THE BEST MASHED POTATOES!! I don't know what they did but they were great.   For going there and not expecting anything I was pleasantly surprised.  I will be back to Phil and Lou's.",0.9944,0.672,0.318,0.01,0.5892857142857143
2007-03-09,4.0,"Phil & Lou's is a neighborhood restaurant that is nice enough for ""dining out"" but casual enough for dining at regularly (daily may be a bit much).  The interior is spacious and tables are not crowded.  There's a long bar along the wall that you can have a seat at, smaller high tables with stools, or padded booths.  When the weather is nice there's outdoor seating on the sidewalk. While there is a variety of food offered, including steak, chicken, and vegetarian fare, my memories of the menu always come back with a seafood theme.",0.7783,0.916,0.084,0.0,0.5380555555555556
2006-12-29,3.0,"Phil & Lou's was not at all what I expected.  For years, I thought it was a steak place.  Then, when I recently saw signs in the windows advertising that their pizzas were back, I though it was probably more casual.  In reality, it's a cross between the two.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere-except that the cigarette smoke from the bar is very prevalent in the rest of this small space.  Metromix states that they have live music Thursdays to Fridays, but there was none on this Thursday.   The menu seems a bit upscale, with Filet as well as many dishes that include lobster(what is it with the lobster at this place?).  The food was decent, but nothing to rave about.  I found a large bone in my BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwich, and that could have turned out badly.   Also, the service was akin to that you'd find at a Denny's or Applebee's - average, at best, with a server that didn't know the drink or dinner menu and was unsure about the specials.   Overall, I'd go back but I wouldn't make a point of it - maybe I'll try it again in the summer and eat in their outdoor dining area.",0.6424,0.907,0.06,0.033,0.42781954887218054
2006-12-20,4.0,"For a neighborhood casual restaurant, I really like this place.  It's kind of a mix of good old American bar food with a little bit of ambiance.   The tuna tartare was just ok.  A little too spicy in my opinion.  We also had the margherita pizza and buffalo chicken salad, both of which were excellent ( LOVE the blue cheese dressing).  Service was great.. no complaints here!",0.9289,0.693,0.243,0.064,0.5476190476190477
2006-12-19,3.0,"I used to live in this neighborhood and would crave the mussels from this place.  My friend was a big fan of their mushroom and cheese (maybe it was ricotta) pizza, but they got rid of that on the menu.  The martini's are pretty good.  I like the tuna as well, but the menu is really so-so.  The place wins points for hospitality as the manager and his wife are awesome and really take care of their customers.  I was in here a while back and they had a loud DJ and that was awful and, to be honest, I haven't been back since.  I miss the feel of this place.",0.9857,0.682,0.274,0.044,0.5000000000000001
2006-12-08,3.0,"I really like their ""Two-fisted Tuna Club"" (minus the bacon) sandwich.  Very large and very tasty.  Nice place and decent menu, although sometimes the food can be hit or miss.",0.6453,0.777,0.175,0.048,0.4706349206349207
