2009-10-31,3.0,"I went to Costa's last nite for dinner.  We drove around a couple times trying to find parking on the street before realizing that they have free valet parking.  The valet sign is a bit hard to see.  But it's nice that they have a small lot behind the restaurant where they park the cars. Inside, the place is HUGE!  It didn't look that big from the outside.  Nicely decorated too making me feel like I'm in Greece, not that I've ever been to Greece. We were going to order the TZATZIKI, but since a couple of us ordered the Gyro Platter, the waitress saved us a couple of bucks by telling us that the platter includes the Tzatziki sauce.  Very cool!  Bonus tips for the waitress.  We also got the SAGANAKI cheese.  This I was a little disappointed in.  The ""OPA!"" from the waitress is a bit underwhelming. It's not so much a yell, more like a little whisper.  Come on! I want a show!  =)  The cheese wasnt' very melted at all.  It's still pretty solid and chewy.  I'm used to the saganaki cheese being softer, stringier, almost melting out of its breaded shell.  I'm sure if she'd yelled the ""OPA!"" louder, the cheese would have tasted better.  I'm sure of it!   The gyro platter is HUGE!  The onions were sweet and strong!  Plenty of gyro meat for two.  I couldn't finish it all.  It's pretty standard gyro.  I've tasted better and I've tasted worse.  I should have gotten some other lamb dish but I wasn't in the mood to deal with cutting, dipping, chewing last nite.  =) All in all, an ok restaurant in Greek town.",0.9965,0.731,0.235,0.033,0.5765586419753086

I figured out quickly George was not my husband & I wouldn't be indulging in such tasty delights frequently, so I asked him what his favorite Greek restaurant was. He told me Costa's, so I knew I had to try it. The Lemon-Chicken Rice soup is delicious. Just enough lemon to give it a bit of a *zing*, but enough chicken taste to make it savory. Delish! I then split a Greek salad, which was okay. I was in Greece for 2 weeks & let me tell you, they do NOT put lettuce in their salads-just tomato, onion, and cucumber, so get that watery lettuce outta there Costa's! I then had a chicken dish & cannot remember the name, but it was the type of Chicken that  melted in your mouth & left the buttery-garlic-herby taste. Yum, yum!

Being prone by nature to paranoid catastrophic imagery, I was frequently distracted by the noise and possibility that the ceiling would collapse and kill me.  Costa's fits nicely into the category of restaurants in the $40 - $50 per person price range that cater to people who don't ever go to better restaurants. The chicken dish I ordered was: KOTA ME KOUKOUNARI  Chicken breast sautéed in olive oil with pine nuts, lemon and  oregano, served with our   ""meat orzo"" and pine nut stuffing. The portion was gigantic and was comprised of ONE singular blended flavor - salt/cheap wine/corn starch/lemon. The 'oregano' used was dried. The chicken had a suspicious pink vein in it that further egged me on to a low-grade panic.  The feta olive spread appetizer was nice enough.",-0.9325,0.811,0.051,0.139,0.6892857142857142

As for your main meal I would recommend everything. I am not usually one to sway away from my usual but my dad and brother are and they have tried everything on the menu.
