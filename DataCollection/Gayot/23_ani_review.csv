Thought the pork belly was a bit dry, but the shrimp was good. The meal was very expensive, though. About $175 for two people, with a bottle of wine.

Shortly after, we noticed a slight wait for others. Right away, we were given a complimentary dish of Asian cracker snacks. These weren't my thing, but it was a nice thought. Boo and I each got a pork belly bun and a plate of brussel sprouts to start. The pork belly was good but the bun was a little too big for what was inside. The brussel sprouts were very good and was actually the best thing we had there. I got the shoyu ramen, boo had the gyu donburi. I wasn't expecting mind-blowing ramen here but I enjoyed it. Big tender pieces of pork belly and perfectly poached egg. The broth and noodles weren't the best but were satisfactory. Boo really enjoyed his donburi. We also got a sake ikura and a spicy maguro temaki (handroll), along with a hamachi maguro & cilantro maki roll. Here's where I was somewhat disappointed. While the fish was quite fresh, the rolls weren't made too well, as they fell apart. Also felt like something was just missing from the flavor of the maki and temaki. Think the rice could have been better as well. Overall, the food wasn't that memorable. However, service was great. Food came out at appropriate times. Waitress was super friendly and helpful.

They also have a quite a list of Japanese beers....which I love because, as many people don't know, many of the Japanese beers we get in the U.S. aren't actually brewed in the United States.  They're brewed in places like Guelph, Ontario so they can say they're ""imported"".  They even have a sake for beginners menu...to help people who don't know much about sake.

We arrived when the restaurant was maybe 60% filled. Our apps (Pork Belly Bun & Edadame) came out very quickly. We were somewhat disappointed that the pork belly bun was just a single bun - where the price of $4 is a tiny bit deceptive. The bun itself was good, but definitely nothing outstanding compared to other neighboring asian joints. For entrees, we ordered the tantanmen and the tori don and gyu don. We waited 30 minutes for the tantanmen. We then waited another 30 minutes for the tori and gyu don. Not sure what the justification was for the long wait time - since we received no explanation. Looking back at other Yelp reviews, I can see that this is a consistent theme. I feel even a little bit slighted since we did not receive any form of consolation for our long wait.

2015-02-17,2.0,"I can only give this place 2 stars because the only thing I actually liked about my experience here was the design and setup of the restaurant.  I had reservations for a Sunday evening dinner to meet my friend before a show at Lincoln Hall.  When I arrived I let the hostess know that my friend was waiting and that she had texted me she was in the back dining room...the hostess looked really aloof and told me she didn't think so. I scanned the room and my friend surely wasn't in the front so I texted her again and sure enough she was in the back...at the very first table...and had just been seated by the same person. I should have known right there how the night was going to be.   We did have a friendly waitress that walked us through the menu and gave us a couple of suggestions.  We ordered edamame for an appetizer which wasn't the best edamame I've had but was good.  I also had ordered a beer which didn't come until after our appetizer and I had to ask for it.  We had placed out order pretty quickly but we waited for nearly 45 minutes for our food.  We watched a couple next to us sit down and receive their plates and they came in after us-mind you, my friend had a simple veggie roll and I had one of the simpler seafood rolls.  After letting out waitress know we were worried a out being late to the show, she apologized a few times and a manager came out and offered cheap Asian trail mix as compensation while we waited and there was STILL another 15 minute wait after that. Our plates finally came and I had a roll that featured tempura blue crab.  I was immediately turned off at how the roll was falling apart and after tasting it, it seemed as if the crab had been fried in old cooking oil.  I didn't even finish all 6 pieces.  I also noticed that at some point when the waitress had cleared the table, she had discarded the rest of my beer. We let the waitress know when she came to clear our plates that we were ready for the check and that's when I began to lose my patience.  She flitted around to all the tables but never came back to drop off the check.  After finally bringing it, we sat and waited another 15 minutes or so for her to come back run our cards so we could leave.  Again, she was nice but the overall service and quality of the food won't have me coming back again.",0.9697,0.87,0.091,0.039,0.45431972789115643

2015-02-08,4.0,"Last night I went to Ani and I left happy.  We had an early dinner reservation during Restaurant Week and the place was almost empty but really filled up as we ate.  The space was welcoming and the decor was on point.  There is a large dining room in the back of the restaurant as well that would be perfect for a private party.  Our server was really helpful and knowledgeable about  both the dinner menu and the sake menu.  We decided not to go with the restaurant menu and instead ordered a la cart off the dinner menu.  So what did we eat? Upon the recommendation from our server we started with fresh fish. We had salmon which was perfect. Cut well, fresh and served at the right temperature.  Then we moved on to the spicy tako hand roll.  This was awesome.  The spicy octopus was just the right texture and the mix of flavors was pleasing.  We then moved on to edamame with sea salt (solid but nothing special) and the togarashi brussel sprouts.  These were good but the flavors were all salty/spicy.  I felt like if there were a slight sweet element to this dish, it would have been a home run.   The highlight of the night by far was the ramen.  I was there with one other person and we had the tantanmen ramen (spicy with pork meatballs) and the vegetarian soba (we subbed the soba for ramen noodles). The tantanmen was amazing.  If you like spicy, this is your dish.  The pork meatballs melted in your mouth.  The vegetarian soba had a mushroom broth where the mushroom flavor was appropriately assertive.  Overall we left feeling satisfied and would go back for sure.  They have a special deal Wednesday nights with ramen, beer and a sake shooter for $15.00.  I think this sounds like the perfect reason to go back. The cost was reasonable with the total bill at $75.00 for all the food plus two great specialty cocktails.  This is my first go at the trendy ramen craze and I was not disappointed.  A place to check out for sure.",0.9986,0.737,0.249,0.014,0.5399341850561362

I had the cheesecake for dessert, which I could've done without. It had a strange flavor I couldn't quite figure out.

We started with the octopus beignets and shumai.  The beignets were fantastic, I recommend these as a starter.  We went with the chef's sashimi platter which was fantastic.  The fish was incredibly fresh and I like the way they serve it on ice as opposed to a plate.  The wasabi and ginger accompaniments were incredibly fresh as well.  For rolls we had the maguro, avocado, and cilantro roll which was fantastic- and spicy.  Afterward we had the ebi mango roll which was the perfect amount of sweetness to finish off the meal.  These were rolled nicely and had a quality amount of fish inside.  Win win for sushi and rolls. The service was fantastic and they have a nice selection of sake, beer and wine.  I think their wine was overpriced with limited glass selections ($10 per glass was the least expensive) and for being up in a neighborhood this is ridiculous.  They do have sake flights here at 3 for $14 which is a nice way to sample some of the different sake.

Brussels sprouts laced with togarashi, soy and bonito flakes make for a deliciously umami dish (not to mention some of the best sprouts I've had). They're tender, hearty and - of course - savory. Vegetable Shumai, filled with carrot, cabbage and chevre, are crunchy, a tad chewy and slightly indulgent thanks to the creamy goat's cheese. Both dishes are apt precursors to the sushi rolls. With poached shrimp, avocado, mango and obha leaf, the Ebi & Mango Maki Mono is simple, but it delivers on flavor. One swift swipe through soy sauce is just enough to compliment the sweetness of the mango and cut through the richness of the avocado.

We first got asked if we had a reservation for the half empty restaurant. No we did not. The woman who sat us was very pleasant and promised that we would have a fantastic experience. Well clearly, this did not happen. We were seated right away and this is where the trouble started. Supposedly you are supposed to receive some rice crackers when you sit down but this did not happen. A page from my husband's menu was missing and it took several servers and a bus boy to get the menu replaced. After that we ordered our food right away. Our appetizers came pretty quickly but then no one checked up on us and asked how those were. Our sever was too busy taking care of the table next to us. She walked them out of the restaurant and spent 15+ minutes talking to them outside and hugging it out. At that point we had ordered our entrees over 40 min ago and they had not come. We asked several people for help and to check on our food at which point a bowl of rice crackers( which can be purchased at Costco) were literally thrown on our table. Are we supposed to eat this instead?!! Really?!? Our server eventually reemerged from the outside and apparently heard that we were mad so came over to tell us the kitchen was backed up. Really??? Your restaurant is half empty ? Hard to believe. Then she told us that she only put in iur food in 30 min ago, so great...are you baking a deep dish pizza or roasting a chicken?? Because again making 1 handroll and 2 maki rolls should not take 30+ minutes in a half empty restaurant. We continued to wait for our food for another 10 minutes and then it finally arrived. The waitress randomly brought over some cold saki for us to try so we could ""compare it""  to the warm sake we already tried. Mind you no apology, just here is some sake, turn and walks away. We ate our food and talked to the manager who really didn't have anything to say.  So that was out experience. Overall, pretty bad and we are not planning to ever go back.

Birthday was a Wednesday, we arrived about 7:30. It's a cute restaurant, semi-low light, no TVs, music that's present in the background, and a nice selection of cocktails and beer.

They have a few options for dessert - I was torn between the Matcha Cake and the Almond Mousse, but ultimately went for the mousse, which had a peppercorn shortbread crust, lemon curd sauce, fresh lychees, and topped with sugared almonds.  It was light, with an interesting combination of flavors.  The mousse was more solid in the form of a bar.  It almost tasted like a stick of nutty brown butter.  Maybe I should have gone for the Matcha Cake - perhaps next time.",0.9953,0.793,0.199,0.008,0.5351642036124794

We've been here twice now and both times we tried different things.  I have to say the cart and the octopus beignets were some top favorites.  Also some great veg dishes like their brussels sprouts.

2014-07-07,4.0,"If you're expecting sushi, Ani is so much more than that.  Food is tasty and inventive and the sake selection is extensive.   I came for a chef's tasting menu where the courses were chosen for us.  Here's the breakdown: Sushi -Hirame - this was a huge piece of sashimi curled in a tulip shape.  It was pretty and tasted very fresh, but the size made it hard to eat, and with no knife, I couldn't cut it -Maguro - a cornucopia-style maki with big chunks of avocado.  The idea, they said, is to taste more of the seaweed.  It was good, just awkward to eat Veggie/Seafood -Vegetable Shumai - this were delicious wonton-type bites with goat cheese, cabbage and carrot -Tako Yaki - OCTOPUS BEIGNETS!!!  I don't have to say more, but I will.  These were light and airy, not at all what I expected.  The octopus was tender which was fantastic because some places overcook it so it's rubbery.  Highly recommend these -Brussel Sprouts - served with housemade garlic flakes, these were super tasty, we fought over the last ones Meat -Enoki - tiny enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon.  The bacon was very thick and not crispy, so my last bite was hard to get through (too fatty), but many at the table enjoyed it -Buta Hara - DELICIOUS pork belly!  It was super tender and not fatty, this was a winner Dessert -Pana Cotta - I am not a fan of pana cotta.  HOWEVER, the chef whips this and serves it with a shortbread cookie, which makes all the difference.  I could have had another! Each course came with a sake pairing.  I'm not really a sake fan, but our servers described why each was paired with each dish.  They seem very knowledgable about sake and say they are proud to present the top 10% of sake varieties.  If you're an afficianado, this seems to be the place to go.",0.9941,0.786,0.169,0.045,0.567377450980392
2014-07-02,4.0,"Ani hits a home run in the ""casual but high quality"" category.  I really dig a place that puts out such a laid-back vibe across their service and atmosphere, but still has the wait staff describe the nightly specials verbally in great detail.  It shows that they are excited about their product and care about their customers, but they aren't putting on airs.  That was a sweet touch. The service was wonderful from start to finish, and all of the food was pretty good.  I mostly ate sushi plus nibbles of the brussels sprouts appetizer and a chicken and rice bowl.  And as a bonus, I got to try temaki for the first time; this is basically the ingredients of a maki roll wrapped up in a cone of seaweed.  I like the idea of sushi as deliberate finger food. This joint should have been busier than it was on a Saturday night, but the mellowness was nice.  I hope that they do well; I would definitely go back.  Close-by street parking was plentiful, and after dinner you are within striking distance of numerous post-dinner drinks venues.  Or Scooter's for dessert.",0.9952,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.6552941176470588

2014-06-03,5.0,"I just went to Ani for the first time with a date last night, and was completely impressed. I got the Gilt City deal for a 6 course meal for both of us, and it was not only amazing food, but a huge quantity as well; we both left completely satisfied.  The place was nearly empty (Monday night, which I'm assuming is why they had the Gilt thing going), so the service was extremely attentive and we even got some special treatment. My boyfriend has been to Japan several times and has a few favorites that are hard to find in the US, so our server was happy to discuss their menu with us, and eventually the chef came out and gave us some dishes on the house, including the takoyaki which was nothing less than amazing.  The other big standouts were the oysters (I've never been a huge fan, but they were totally worth it), the vegetable shumai, and the sashimi. Our server was even nice enough to give us a sample of some of their sake.  Overall, great staff, great atmosphere, and really remarkable food. Great for a date night or if you're just getting a few plates with a friend.",0.9949,0.701,0.249,0.051,0.5467159277504104
2014-06-01,4.0,"With the five star ratings I was expecting to be blown away by Ani on my 6 course dinner visit. And I was not. at all. So it's taken me a while to decide whether I was just let down by extremely high expectations. I think after a couple of weeks I remember the food to be generally good.  Service though... To be fair, I think they were overwhelmed by the number of coursed-dinners and pacing on those, both in the kitchen and the front. Everyone there had to wait a very long time between courses, and the servers were so flustered. Beyond that, service was also very ...inexperienced? Awkward? Like they weren't in their element. The restaurant was extremely apologetic and accommodating, but we weren't the only ones who were in a rush to get out of there by the end because dinner took twice as long as expected. Food started strong. Complementary Japanese snacks/trail mix thing, which was a nice touch.  Then oysters that were the only raw oysters I've ever liked eating. Some pickles.  A togarashi tuna dish that I really enjoyed. Simple but the fish comes through.  Then some pretty decent sashimi. Very fish, generous cuts. The mussels were excellent. The broth is pretty standard wine-based with a twist, but the quality of the mussels themselves - really fresh, super tender, and not overcooked at all. Ramen and dessert were truly letdowns though. We tried the miso and the unique Chicago ramen. Italian beef sandwich flavors in the form of ramen... so interesting and creative, right? So promising, but it was truly awful. Really tough chewy beef, the wrong kind of noodles, and a really overly sweet and muddled broth that basically just tasted like they dumped the brine from a can of giardiniera peppers into my bowl and called it soup. Miso was so average I've completely forgotten about it, but I suppose that's not a bad thing compared to the chicago ramen... We also had the matcha financier as a dessert, and it was a bit dry and uninventive. Ending the meal on a low note probably soured my impression of the place, and the annoyance of having to deal with the service/pacing/overall experience didn't help. But I do remember really enjoying the first half of my meal even through all the waiting. If you're patient, give them some time and/or take an entire evening and try the food. Ani does a nice job of adding just enough twist to Japanese food to make it interesting, while still keeping its simple/delicate/comforting food. That Chicago ramen is one step too far though...",0.9973,0.739,0.199,0.062,0.5989805770361326

2014-05-09,5.0,"I am a huge fan of Arami's and have been there countless times.  When their new spot was going to open, I was excited about having the same quality I know from Arami but for lunch!!!  I have been to over Ani 5x for lunch and loved the bento boxes!  On more than one occasion, I went with some moms with babies and we all had great healthy food, a place to park our strollers & nurse comfortably.  Although I didn't order the usual items I would at Arami like sashimi, maki rolls & ramen, I loved that they were all available for both dinner and lunch, in addition to the lunch only bento boxes.  The boxes have a TON of food and are always so fresh.  And yeah...think the other Yelpers have declared the goodness of the tako yaki.  I'm definitely on that bandwagon!!!  And one other cool aspect was the private 20 person room in the back.  I am thinking of hosting a girls night out and it would be the perfect spot for us to be loud, drink tons of sake & have a great chef's choice dinner!  I highly recommend Ani for either a casual lunch or a fun all out dinner!",0.9971,0.71,0.29,0.0,0.57004329004329
2014-05-04,5.0,"I am a huge fan of Arami. So we set out to try Ani, there sister restaurant, and we are glad we did.  The atmosphere is completely different and it was nice to see they did not set out to make another Arami. It is very stark, but comfortable with high ceilings, and no sit down sushi bar. We had a party of 7 and they sat us at an extremely cool table cut from a tree. Our server was amazing. She was knowledgable, recommended the best items, and made the evening special, even with the vocal group I was with. The food did not disappoint. It was the same high quality sashimi you would expect from a great sushi establishment. The chef special, the spicy tuna, the three fish rolls, and the assorted sashimi, all had great flavors and textures. The special Ramon dish, even though I could not eat, was devoured by my friends and family and they raved. We had one non sushi participant and she was able to enjoy a good chicken dish and an appetizer of fresh veggies prepared well. The drink list is good with a nice selection of cocktails and a good wine list.   Great evening and now we have two favorite sushi places.",0.9983,0.623,0.355,0.021,0.6701133786848074

2014-03-30,5.0,"Quite honestly, we landed up at Ani only because a friend related it to Arami and suggested we try it out. It was love at first sight. It's a quaint spot, very open and inviting, with just the right touch of finery that isn't too overwhelming. Their sake menu is ridiculously tempting - we tried two of them, a dry cold sake with a creamy texture and floral scents (I do not remember the name!) and the Demonslayer's Dream. The latter was the perfect accompaniment for our dinner courses, while the first was a good aperitif. Now the food. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious, every flavor bursting smoothly against delighted tastebuds. We had the Tsukemono - the pickled daikon is something special; Tako Yaki - bite sized octopus beignets; Vegetable Shumai - these dumplings are one of the best I've had - it had just the right amount of goat cheese in it to add that extra kick of tartness; Enoki - tastes as good as it looks, mushrooms wrapped with a strip of bacon, just pop the whole piece in straight off the skewer to enjoy it fully; Hamachi, Maguro and Cilantro - fish roll, yellow tail and bluefin with jalapeños and a light spread of avocado ; Double Sake - spicy salmon roll; Double Ebi - shrimp tempura roll with a hint of heat from the spicy shrimp; and Zuke Sake and Spicy Hotate - spicy scallop and marinated salmon roll. A few of my friends ordered some sashimi and a vegetarian ramen dish as well. The best part about all of the food was that every single flavor was distinguishable and work so well together, the sweet citrus with the spicy toppings, the soft rice with the light crunch of masago, and the combinations of the different sea food elements in it. The service was great with everyone in the restaurant very attentive and ready to answer all of our questions. Our waiter had great suggestions for drinks and food, we got almost everything he mentioned and a few more and were glad we listened to him.",0.9968,0.798,0.192,0.01,0.5403138528138529
