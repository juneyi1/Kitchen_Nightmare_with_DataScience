2010-12-14,1.0,"Well, I tried not to give any stars because, while I was excited to go there, the restaurant failed to serve me.  I was forced to give one star though. I made the reservation on a Monday for a Friday reservation.  I did it in person bc I live very close.  When I made the reservation, the manager (owner?) asked for my phone number and a credit card number in case of a ""no show, no call"" (his words).   When Friday arrived, I found out that my party had decreased in number.  I started calling around 3pm and continued all the way until 6 (I didn't have time to run over) but there was no answer.  At 7:30, my wife and I headed over there to meet our friends.  When we arrived at the front door there was a sign that read- ""we are closed tonight, sorry."" Now, we had to try to find a restaurant to serve 6 people on a Friday night at 7:45, awesome. Whatever the reason for their closing, my question remains: If I have to give a credit card and phone number so they can follow up with me for not showing up and failing to call.  What is their excuse for not calling me?  It's not the largest or busiest restaurant in town. Calling all of their reservations to excuse their closing would have taken 10 minutes tops.  Anyone could have done it. This shows a fundamental lack of respect for people, not just customers.  I would never be so rude and am appalled by their lack of conscience. Fortunately, we were able to get a table at Cafe Absinthe, located 1 block away.  I wont give a full review here but I will say that the service was friendly and welcoming (they didn't even blink when we showed up with all of our own wine) and the food was amazing.  If you're looking for a great meal in this area: that's the place to go.  I can say that because I actually was able to eat there.",0.9648,0.76,0.15,0.09,0.5590909090909091
2010-12-06,4.0,"FANTASTIC start to finish with the ""new"" Mado. Service was tops, food was fabulous - seasonal tastes with some clever twists thrown in (fennel braised in root beer, tobacco infused panna cotta etc.), executed perfectly - all this on a lowly Sunday night. The Parsnip soup was phenom - sweetbreads were the best I've had outside of Sepia - Duck Pot Pie was warm and homey and perfect for the cold - and the beef dish was simply delicious (and cooked perfectly to boot). We'd been dreading going back to Mado after really poor experiences under the old staff (severely overcooked meat, poorly reheated dishes with cold centers and blah desserts), but in an effort use up Groupons we went to try what the new chef could offer, and I'm happy to say they've won me over - Cannot wait to go back",0.9776,0.749,0.206,0.044,0.632972582972583

2010-11-22,1.0,"We ate at the new Mado (minus the Levitts and under new ownership) on Saturday night. My goodness, how things have changed- and not for the better. I must have been hiding under a rock, but I hadn't realized that Rob and Allison were gone. It was apparent from the time we walked in the door. When were seated, our waiter asked if we had eaten there before. We told him that we were something short of regulars, but had been big fans. The menu is still divided into soups, salads, small plates and large plates. When we tried to order soup, 2 salads and 2 small plates, the waiter told us that the chef wanted us to order everything at once so we needed to order our large plates too. Given how much we were already ordering, we told him no. We would assess our appetites after the first 3 courses. He was shocked but allowed that this was ""OK"". We were served an amuse bouche of a sweet panna cotta type disc topped with raw hiramasa and a citrus zest. It was bad. The fish had no acid component and the bite had no textural differences. It was a sweet, soft bite of food with the bitter zest leaving the aftertaste. I was disappointed but was hoping for better. It didn't get better. We had ordered soup(pozole), a couple of small plates (maple crisp lamb belly with apple and a duck pot pie with chocolate and caraway) and 2 salads(beet with beet greens and a winter mixed greens with white anchovies). We were not served anything for 45 minutes after the amuse. Nothing. Nada. Then, we were brought the 2 small plates and the soup together. At this point, we had finished a bottle of champagne and were opening as bottle of rose. Our waiter did not offer to open the bottle nor did he offer new wine glasses to replace the champagne flutes. We had to ask and he agreed to retrieve them. While awaiting the wine glasses, I tried the pozole. I should have known better. It was about 1/4 cup of brownish-red liquid with two clumps of chorizo in it sitting at the bottom of a deep soup bowl. After noting the modest portion and it's unappetizing presentation, I tasted it. It was cold and it tasted of chile, and nothing else-not a balanced spicy chile, more of a bitter (think guajillo) chile. Yuck. Room temperature bitter broth is not what I had envisaged when we ordered the soup. We sent it back when the waiter appeared with the wine glasses. We sent back a wine glass too. As the server set it in front of me, I noted that it was so dirty, the glass was opaque. This resulted from a very bad washing and no effort to wipe or inspect the glass. I had to point this out to the server and he left with my wine glass and the soup. The small plates were not bad, but they were not good. The duck pot pie was a muddle of flavors taken hostage by the chocolate and saved only by the inclusion of 2 crispy pumpernickel croutons. The lamb belly was properly gamey but tough, and stacked like a napoleon, it was difficult to eat.  Next, we received a visit from the chef. He apologized for the soup and asked about the amuse. I was honest and he explained that the (orange)zest provided the acid counter to the sweetness of the panna cotta. Our palates were clearly different. On to the salads. The beet salad was delicious and the best thing, by far, we ordered that night. It was little cubes of pickled beet, served with hot and cold greens and a balsamic based reduction. The salad of winter greens and white anchovies was inedible. The greens were dressed with lemon juice and the salad was so bitter that this bitter-greens-loving diner couldn't take a second bite. We sent it back, whereupon we were lectured by the chef about the concept of winter greens: they're supposed to be bitter. Yes, I replied but not inedibly so. I responded that the dressing or other flavor components should balance the bitterness, not add to it. I don't think the chef appreciated the comment. We should have known better and left then. We didn't. We shared a large plate: pork cheek served over a celery root puree. Not bad, not great. Stewed pork cheek is one of those foods that should be memorable. Luscious, fatty, flavorful and rich. This was not cooked properly; it was not tender enough. It also lacked the developed flavors of a properly braised piece of fatty pork. The puree was good. We were still hungry so we were willing to try dessert. The server didn't offer a dessert menu. We asked. The server said ""We're out of dessert"". Huh? Yes, they were out of every dessert. I can't tell you what there may or may not have been on the dessert menu. They were out of everything. We asked for the check. The bad news: prices are higher than the original Mado. The good news: they didn't charge us for the soup and the winter greens salad. My dining companion and I have rated this experience as a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10.

Upon entering the restaurant, bf commented that it looked like the restaurant owners were squatting in the space, as there was little to no ornamentation of the space whatsoever. Here is the long and short of it.  The service was mediocre.  Some dishes were revelatory, others were borderline inedible.  The price for a meal for two was reasonable, however the portion sizes are almost ludicrously tiny.  Small portion sizes are fine with me, however I take issue with a restaurant labeling a dish as a ""large plate"" when the actual plate was less than 6 inches in diameter, and was topped with only a paltry number of bites.",0.5046,0.909,0.062,0.029,0.5280070546737213

The chef also came out and spoke with us to see what was wrong with it which was very nice but it didn't change the experience.  The chef mentioned that the menu is only 4 days old and they are still trying to work out the kinks.   As others stated, it does take a long time to dine there which typically I do not mind but the problem here is that you wait an inordinate amount of time for food that tastes terrible.    How bad was it?  We headed to Piece and ordered a pizza.

Maybe I'm totally wrong, but then again if I owned Mado, that's certainly what I would do. Here's the review for the new Mado: Something horrible horrible changed last Saturday versus the previous time we went. The food increased in price, decreased in both quality and quantity (really had nothing decent except the smoked duck for a 1/6 hit rate!), and the service was unbelievably slow without an explanation.

Mado:  Locally grown farm fresh foods... simple and delightful!   Here's the breakdown of our meal: Appetizer:  Roasted Beets, Pickled Sliced Beets, Goat Cheese, Basil I don't know if my wife and I have been on a beet kick lately, but roasted beets served cold are currently are favorite dish!  Wonderfully sweet, nice mix of flavors, melt in your mouth goat cheese... this dish was excellent! Main Course:  Hangar Steak with Gorgonzola Polenta The steak was delicious, even though my wife requested medium instead of medium rare.  Flavors were excellent, tenderness in the center was good, however she had some issues with the edges of the steak being burnt.  There was also a significant amount of ""grease"" that came out of the steak which was somewhat of a turnoff.  The polenta texture was excellent, but the gorgonzola, while great for the first few bites, become overpowering very quickly... you have to really like gorgonzola to enjoy this.   Main Course:  Beef Heart with Roasted Peppers  Having never eaten heart before, I was curious but wary at the same time.  The thinly sliced pieces of heart were tender and tasty!  Roasted peppers were fairly standard and a nice compliment.  Good dish, but mentally, it was tough for me to fully accept that I was eating heart... which threw me off during the meal.  Granted, I've had chicken feet, cow's tongue, and pig ears no problem... but I think I'm just used to eating heart yet.  Nonetheless, tasty! Dessert:  Vanilla rice pudding with fresh blueberries and toasted/sliced almonds What a way to end the meal... this was simple yet excellent dessert!  The vanilla flavor was perfect, fresh blueberries succulently sweet, and toasted almonds not only added crunch, but a great flavor element as well!  I've never been a rice pudding fan, but if all rice pudding I ate tasted like this, I would be likely going way over my carb limits.  =p So all in all, the appetizer and dessert were outstanding, and the main course was average...  Worth checking out, and we'll likely be going back just to enjoy apps and dessert from here on out!",0.9992,0.697,0.29,0.012,0.5986424394319131

The sausage was good too, but paled in comparison to the shoulder. For dessert we had the chocolate cream pie, which was your typical chocolate pie, but they had cornmeal again for the crust, which was nice. As for the atmosphere, ambiance and service, the meal took a turn for the worse.

This is all after I enjoyed a couple of outstanding appetizers.  The marinated olives were solid, and the fried farm egg bruschetta with confit fat was unlike anything I have ever tried before, in an amazingly good way. We finished off the evening with a plate of Migas Bark, a decadent dark chocolate dessert that somewhat resembled a fancy Nestle's Crunch.  One plate was just enough to sweeten everyone's pallates after the serious amount of food we consumed for dinner.

Went on a Saturday night and had a 9pm reservation. We were promptly seated. I went with my boyfriend and we started with the roasted carrots with goat cheese, cumin honey and pistachios.  I thought the combination of ingredients was interesting and was eager to try it.  I was disappointed when I tried the carrots and they were barely ""roasted"" and more like blanched.  They had none of the sweet flavor or soft texture that I normally associate with roasted carrots.  On the whole, they were just ok.  Next, I had the salad with trout, egg, and homemade croutons.  I wrongly assumed the egg was a soft poached egg, and was disappointed (my own fault) when the salad arrived and the egg was just hard boiled.  However, the real issue with the salad was the amount of salt.  I understand the trout was cured, and as a result salty, but this was salty to the point it was inedible.   My boyfriend got the potato and asparagus soup which was delicious and the best part of the whole meal.  The soup was creamy and well seasoned.   For dinner, I got the hanger steak with gorgonzola polenta.  I love hanger steak and think its a really flavorful cut of meat.  I ordered it rare and it was cooked perfectly.  However, both the steak and polenta were SO overly salted, they were hard to eat.  I am liberal with salt, but this out of control.  It was obvious the same person made the trout and the steak and polenta. My boyfriend had the roasted chicken with a pile of greens with croutons.  First, the presentation of this dish was sloppy.  The greens (maybe romaine or arugula, I forget) looked as if they were thoughtlessly piled on the plate by a lunch lady at a school cafeteria.  The chicken itself was good.  It was moist, but nothing spectacular and  ironically was not really seasoned (salt or otherwise). The decor was OKAY.  I understand margins are tight for BYOs, but  many that I have been to feel intimate.  Perhaps its was the lighting here?  The place was lit up like a Christmas tree at 9:30pm at night.   Overall, I would not recommend Mado based on my experience, but hopefully for them it was just an off night.",0.9848,0.809,0.127,0.064,0.5413344407530454

2010-05-29,1.0,"We went into our meal at Mado tonight with high hopes. Unfortunately, we left profoundly disappointed. Thankfully, we at least were using a Groupon, so we didn't end up paying full price. We started off with the Fried Farm Egg Bruschetta with Confit Fat ($10). In addition to being over salted (a theme will emerge here), I remain completely dumbfounded by the fact that for $10 all you get is literally a fried egg on top of a thick piece of bread. I don't care if it's a ""fresh farm egg,"" if it's not a bald eagle egg, I don't think one egg should ever cost $10. We could have easily made something just as good at home for about $0.50.  We also got the charcuterie platter with copa, country ham, and chicken liver pate ($14). The copa was good, but the ham was dry and bland, and the pate was average at best. For my entree, I had the wood-grilled hanger steak with Gorgonzola polenta ($26) -- which was again, over salted to the point of being nearly inedible. I will give them credit for cooking the meat perfectly rare, but it was impossible to get past how badly over seasoned it was. The Gorgonzola polenta was much too rich, and again, way too salty. My girlfriend had the rainbow trout with chickpeas ($21). The fish was cooked fine, but it was (surprisingly) under seasoned and bland. The chickpea salad the fish was served on was uninspired and, as my girlfriend said, ""seems like something they just picked up at the Jewel Osco."" Additionally, our entrees took forever and a half to arrive. The server's assistant's were great and kept our water glasses filled throughout the night. Our server, on the other hand, never checked on us once after our food was served. This would be more understandable if the restaurant was busy, but there were several tables open, throughout our time in the restaurant (not a good sign at 8:30 on a Saturday). Total bill (without the Groupon) would have run us $100, without any drinks. We will not be going back and wouldn't recommend Mado to anyone who asks.

I made reservations for 9:00 p.m. online, but they had no open tables for a party of three when we arrived.  So, we had to wait for about half an hour to 45 minutes for a table.  Ordinarily, a bad thing.  Not so in this case, because the staff decided that, as compensation, we should have a sampling of the antipasti on the house.  Three appetizers for three people: the meat platter, the roasted carrots with goat cheese and ras el hanout, and the roasted ramps in almond aoli. So, the appetizers.  The meat platter was excellent: fennel, mustard, bread, head cheese, ham, and pate.  Very good, but meat is hard to mangle too badly.  The roasted carrots were very good, although a little tough.  Still, we had absolutely no difficulty polishing them off.  Finally, the roasted ramps.  These were easily the best of the bunch.  Tender, flavorful, not too oily...these were great.  If all vegetables were prepared this way, I could easily become vegetarian. Once we got our table, my companion ordered the eggs in purgatory, while I got the roasted beef heart.  Oh.  My.  God.  The most tender, flavorful, delicious piece of beef that I have ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious.  This place knows how to prepare its meat.  The beef heart may sound odd, but trust me--if you like meat, order this. My companion's eggs in purgatory were also excellent: two soft-cooked eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with olives and chili oil.  She loved them, for her part.  Since I was already in a mild state of beef-induced ecstasy, I was not blown away, but it was very good nonetheless. Finally, dessert.  Again, excellent.  I had never imagined myself capable of eating all the food that I ate, but it really is that good.  With the Groupon, we paid about $60 for three people (more than reasonable for the amount and quality of the food), and I left with a very full belly, a very happy tongue, and a new restaurant high on my list of places to go.",0.9976,0.711,0.226,0.063,0.6565192465192465

The main dishes (pork loin & trout) were both excellent.  Dessert was good, but just totally over-priced. Mindy Segal charges $11 for a mind-blowing plate of artistry and deliciousness. You charge $8 for what was essentially a vanilla-cream jello with some rhubarb jelly on top. Not impressed.  Worse yet, the place is BYOB AND we used a $40 Groupon coupon, and we still ended up with a $100ish bill.

2010-05-11,5.0,"I'm not sure I have the words to describe what a positive experience mado was.  I can't speak highly enough about it.   We had a 9:00 reservation for 2 and they were running behind.  They apologized profusely and opened our drinks at the 'bar' area.  They then asked us if we'd like an appetizer on the house.  After we chose the brandade, they brought us both that and the roasted carrots.  While it is poor to be 30 minutes late on reservations, we couldn't have been treated nicer.  It was an excellent experience.  For those who have complained about the roasted carrots on Yelp, you clearly should turn in your Yelp card.  You, honestly, have no idea what you're talking about.   After we were seated, we were borderline full from the appetizers, but ordered the full meat platter, as well as the hanger steak with gorgonzola polenta.  The meat platter was incredibly gratifying: the pork shoulder ham was the best ham I've ever tasted and the chicken liver pate was probably a tad too rich to eat much of, but an incredible taste.  On the steak side, the steak was cooked wonderfully and the polenta had this beautifully earthy, gritty, real taste that made it the perfect accompaniment.   I honestly have no complaints.  If I was to critique, I'd say that the brandade was a little bland, although still very good and the country pate on the meat platter wasn't that exciting.   Selfishly, I'd like it to continue to be possible to get a table at mado, but those folks deserve to be packed every night of the week.  Go.  Now.",0.9939,0.748,0.199,0.053,0.7093670033670034
2010-05-07,2.0,"It seems like Mado has a recipe for a great restaurant: Local / Organic / Daily menu changes / Fresh / Mastery of Pork / Hip Neighborhood. It all sounds right in theory, but in practice something is just off.   The space looks pretty cool at first glance. A soft loft with exposed brick and a dark wood bar. However, a closer look reveals all Ikea furniture and glassware, a hasty drywall restroom area and the general feeling that these folks just threw a restaurant together as quickly as possible.  The food. Solid, but nothing special. The hangar steak was definitely good, but I've had better and the gorgonzola polenta was, as with most gorgonzola dishes, um...too gorgonzola-ee. The roast chicken was solid, but for a ""spit roasted"" chicken I kind of expected a little char or smokiness. Instead it was really just straight ahead with barely any crispyness to the skin at all. Dessert was also a mixed bag. We were enticed into a panna cotta-like dish with rhubarb because we were told that rhubarb season just started and they just got their rhubarb in that day. Again, sounds great in theory. The reality? A relatively innocuous yogurt panna cotta buried under a ton of spicy rhubarb jelly. Rice pudding with vanilla and golden raisins was better, probably our favorite dish of the night.  I don't know...we left kind of perplexed. That's not really the feeling I want to walk away with, trying to dissect what just happened. I'd rather just feel satisfied. I don't think we'll be back.

2010-05-02,3.0,"So let me just get this out of the way: Mado makes great rillettes. Were it not for their rillettes, this would be a 2-star review. I lived in France for several years and spent a fair bit of time in Le Mans, one of the two French cities known for rillettes de porc, and I *know* rillettes. Mado's rillettes were the best I've had on this side of the Atlantic, and could compete with decent-quality rillettes in France: it's not too salty, the flavor of the pork has been brought out clearly, the fat spreads on toast easily and melts in the mouth. However, I had one small complaint about it: on the menu, the rillettes are listed as a separate item from the mustard and pickles. First of all, who charges extra for mustard and pickles? Secondly, rillettes are *always* served with mustard and pickles. In the cheapest of neighborhood cafés in Paris, an order of rillettes comes with a crock of pickles and a crock of mustard, so why does Mado make their customers order it separately and pay for it separately? Anyway, on to the actual review. A friend and I were inspired to go on a whim one night and called ahead to see if there was seating. It was already 8:30pm, so we checked to see if they were still seating people and the person on the phone said that, yes, they'd be delighted to seat us still, so long as we get there in time to put in our orders before 10pm. When we actually got there, we found ourselves being rushed through our meal. The server came by nearly every minute while we were trying to decide what to order. The busboy was constantly hovering over our table to clear plates and push through the next course. I had my bread plate taken away while I still had bread IN MY HAND. At every level of service, we were clearly being told, ""hurry up, pay your check, and GTFO,"" which was not what we were told when we phoned ahead. Rushing diners is something that always infuriates me, and it enraged me even more that night at a restaurant that makes pretensions to being something more than a cafeteria. As soon as you pass the $20 / person bracket, a restaurant should never rush their guests; part of the price they are paying is for the experience of relaxing, being social, etc. in that sort of environment. In sum, despite what I'm about to say about the food, this pretty much guarantees that I'm not going back. For starters, we had the rillettes; and the carrots, honey, pistachios, and goat cheese with ras el hanout spices. The rillettes were fantastic and the other dish was also delicious...but how can you go wrong with honey and goat cheese? For my main, I had the pork sausages with braised kale; the kale had a wonderful texture but had been over-salted (or, I think, the broth they used for braising was already over-salty), and the sausages were banal and lacking in some of the bread-based binders that give texture and firmness to a good sausage. My friend had the brandade (a Basque dish that involves mashed salted cod on bread), which was surprisingly tasteless. I mean, it's made of SALTED FISH, and the thing tasted like somebody had just waved a can of tuna in front of a bowl of mashed potatoes. Maybe they were trying to play down the fishiness for a North American palate, but it sorta defeated the purpose. So, overall, Mado makes very good charcuterie and reasonably good (and well-sourced) meats preparations. Don't bother getting them to prepare fish for you, and beware of tactless service. Also, it's BYOB.",0.992,0.881,0.095,0.024,0.41027116402116404

I also went for the safer option - the roasted chicken with mache and home made croutons - the chicken was just as good as the best kosher bird I've ever had - moist and flavorful and ample - they serve the breast and wing and thigh and leg - take home plenty...it was delicious.....we were too full for desert....but next time we come back with more appetite.

2010-04-09,1.0,"After buying the recent Groupon I figured this would be a perfect place for dinner on a Friday night.  Based on the previous reviews by other yelpers I didn't really know what to expect.   We had a 7pm reservation, and we were seated immediately.  We had to wait a few minutes for the waitress to come by where she opened our bottle of wine.  That was the last positive thing to happen the rest of the night.   The way the tables were laid out it felt like every time someone walked by I'd be pumped into.  While it never actually happened, it kinda keeps you on edge your entire meal with the staff walking back and forth.  Also, I could have done with out the waiter with the torn jeans and his light blue boxers exposed. We ordered the meat platter which had two types of pork and a chicken liver pate, and we also ordered the brandade.  The meat platter was tasteless, and we found out that brandade really means ""salty fish paste"".  When the platter arrived, the food-runner didn't stick around long enough to tell us which meat was which.  When the waitress came by 10 minutes later, we were able to find out.  The platter ""accompaniments"" came with about a whole loaf of sourdough bread, and the fish-paste did as well.  The bread with the fish paste was straight-up burnt.   For the entree we both ordered the hangar steak with Gorgonzola risotto.  The steak was described to us as medium rare, and it arrived as rare.  I didn't mind that so much but my girlfriend did.  Also, for as rare as the steak was we were both very surprised at how burnt the outside of the steak was.  We determined that the when eating the burned parts of the steak, if you mixed it with the gorgonzolla, it made it tolerable.   After seeing the table next to us each order a piece of cake, watching them take one bite, and then leaving, we decided to skip dessert. When I asked for the check I mentioned I had a groupon.  The waitress explained to me I had some ""paper work"" to fill out, and with the check I was given a form to fill out about my groupon.  Considering all the information they asked for was on the groupon, and I didn't feel like doing their job for them, I skipped that part of the ordeal.   This place was well below expectations.  I was very surprised to see a restaurant with 3.5 stars on yelp be this unacceptable.  It was also kinda expensive.  I'd honestly rather go to the grocery store and cook myself than eat here again, even if someone else was paying for me.",0.9496,0.927,0.057,0.016,0.46886837121212127

I read a lot about the chefs here, watched the Sky Full of Bacon video podcast about it, and was generally quite excited. I thought, dang it, if we're going to eat animals we should at least eat ALL of them. The fact that it was a BYO (and one of the few that abides by the Chicago law against corkage fees for restaurants without a liquor license) sealed the deal. I ordered the ""scrapple,"" which according to the waitress is a loaf of pig miscellany sliced, fried and served on a pile of lentils cooked with jowl bacon. This place is famous for its treatment of pork, so I though I'd take a dive into the deep end of the meat pool. Wow. It was a salty, squishy, extremely fatty rectangle of fried. Tasted vaguely of breakfast too. After a few bites I was done, and then proceeded to polish off a delicious salad of arugula, fennel and cocoa nibs we had ordered earlier. Even then I felt like I'd need a week of nothing but leafy greens to balance out those gooey pork-wads. It seems from the other reviews that the hanger steak is the thing to get. But... steak is kind of awesome no matter what, as long as you don't screw it up. Especially a restaurant-only cut like a hanger. Shouldn't some exotic pork-jowl concoction be the star here? Service was great, the small dining room is inviting, and the prices weren't outrageous for fancy-dinner. I'm sure that for pork-fat connoisseurs it's hog heaven.

Bare brick walls, small wooden tables, and interesting artwork give it a rustic charm that is comfortable and relaxing. It goes well with the simple, unpretentious menu, which in no way means the menu is anything less than wonderful. We started our meal with the Meat Platter, which consisted of country smoked ham, testa, and pork liver pate. We also shared an order of the Braised Fennel with Saffron Aioli. All of it was delicious and the pate was one of the best I've ever had. I was not familiar with testa by name, but it was a head cheese and it was excellent. For our entree, we decided to share the Cassoulet, which contained duck and pork confit, pork sausage, and white beans. It was beyond words and we savored every bite.

2010-02-15,2.0,"I had heard several good things about Mado and their alleged emphasis on simple meals from local fresh fare made it all the more appealing so my boyfriend and I decided to eat there for Valentine's Day.  We arrived and were seated and given water pretty promptly which is always good.  It took us a little bit of time to decide what we wanted even though the menu was fairly spare.  We both ordered the wood-grilled trout with rosemary-roasted potatoes to go along with it and the chicken liver pate to start.   The pate was okay, too rich but as I am not generally a pate eater we can chalk that up to not being my cup of tea.  The fish arrived smelling pretty smoky and looking fantastic.  The skin was tasty, if not a little over-salted, but the flesh was a little underdone for my taste.  Additionally I do not know why someone would choose to wood-grill a trout.  Trout has a delicate flavor and the wood-grilling overpowers it so that you can barely taste the trout.  I love trout, it's probably my favorite fish but this was the worst trout I had ever had. The potatoes, again over-salted didn't taste or smell a thing like rosemary.  This is a dish I have made myself and know it is a very simple one so I was surprised this could be screwed up.  I picked up a crisp piece of rosemary and ate that and again there was no taste of rosemary; either the rosemary was old and had lost it's flavor or the cooking process had over-powered it again. For dessert we had the Valentine's Day special of cherry pie with chocolate creme fraiche.  The pie was in a pate brisee brust which I generally really like but found to be not quite the best choice for this pie. The cherries themselves tasted good but were again overpwered by cinnamon.  I can make a mean sour cherry pie myself and I don't usually put cinnamon in it but this was so strong it was fragrant, like flowers.   I will not go back to this restaurant as they are 0 for 4 in my book.  I rather go the impression that the chef had the technique but not the knowhow to cook and combine flavors.  The meal cost us $95 with tip and none of it was worth it.  Not the worst meal I've ever eaten but not even close to being one of the best.  We passed Taxim on our way home and I wish we had gone there instead where I have loved everything I have eaten there.",0.9882,0.788,0.147,0.064,0.5328656462585035

We had it with a side of their creamy polenta and it was the perfect accompaniment to the pork since it wasn't overly seasoned. The broth however, was full flavor with the legumes and cubes of fat.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate coconut flan and the vanilla rice pudding with golden raisins and almonds. Both were delicious. The flan was actually a thin layer caramelized with brown sugar on top of a dense chocolate mousse-like cake. The rice pudding was my favorite. Lots of warm, creamy flavor with the texture of almonds and hints of vanilla, then honey and raisins. Really layered flavors made this an interesting dessert.  Overall, a really wonderful experience.

How about a pork meatball and lentil casuela to anchor the meal?  Sounds good on a sleety December evening, doesn't it?  Hell yes it does.  Besides the lentils there were a few chopped vegetables, and chunks of pork assisted the somewhat spicy pork meatballs.  The whole thing was baked in this shallow crock and added up to a fantastically hearty, savory, and satisfying dish. And dessert?  Did you say rice pudding?  Sold.  Theirs was an excellent rice pudding, with chopped almonds and golden raisins.  This rivals Cafe Laguardia for the best restaurant rice pudding I've eaten.  I also enjoyed several bites of my friend's dessert--the chocolate-peppermint marshmallow pie.  Yes, it was as good as it sounds, or possibly even better.",0.9966,0.718,0.245,0.037,0.5612903225806452

In addition to the meat plates we shared, I also ordered the arugula salad with fennel which was large enough to share with two other people and worked as a great transition into my main course.  Personally, I ordered the trout because the salsa verde crust from the menu jumped off the page.  It was crispier than I had expected, and for me, this was the perfect surprise.  From tail to gill, the trout was evenly cooked and seasoned well. Other things ordered at our table included: the pork meatballs ""casuela"", hanger steak and the whitefish.

The menu changes daily based on what they can get locally. For entrees, the meat platter with accompaniments, two whitefish and the chicken. While the charcuterie was delicious, they all looked and tasted the same. They were pork based so that may have something to do with it. The bread, grain mustard and pickled vegetable was extra. Um, shouldn't that automatically come with the charcuterie? My mother liked her chicken entree while my husband and father both did not like their whitefish. It had no flavor. And while my dad is not a big eater, after finishing his fish, he proceeded to eat some of my mothers chicken.  We all had such high hopes for this place.

2009-11-10,4.0,"The short take: Seasonal, locally sourced, and prepared to showcase the product; often great but a bit inconsistent. Conceptually I love Mado. Rob and Allison have created a simple space with local produce and meats (they're Green City Market geeks and buy whole animals from Midwest farms) picked for season and treated with respect. The menu is always changing and being a snout to tail sort of place there's often offal on order; as a main or via the charcuterie plate. While it seems that off cuts and force meats are all the rage Rob's really doing wonderful stuff and if you'd normally turn your nose up at head cheese and pate you should do yourself a favor and order anyway. The menu is mostly small plates with a few larger mains but is surprisingly ambitious in variety given how often it changes. In both of my experiences the soups (celery seed with a nice bite to cut the velvety creaminess and a spicy parsnip puree) were just right. The hanger steak was good, perfectly cooked, but I think I prefer their plain and rustic polenta to the Gorgonzola variety. The high point of our last meal was certainly the mutton leg; basted in lardo and perfectly tender. Unfortunately it was undercut by a squash puree that was a bit too sweet and assertive, but we worked around it without much trouble. The egg in our farm egg bruschetta was fantastic but again the toast was perhaps a bit too toasted and there was more a sense of charcoal than what should have been a touch of bitter to cut the yolk. For desert the migas bark is unique and delicious, and the pear and pistachio tart I had last time through was just the right mix of crunchy sweet and punchy acid. The space is open, with high ceilings and exposed brick. Clean lines, abstract art, a non-ironic chalkboard menu; loft dining. It's very in keeping with the ethos of the place: simple, straightforward, and well executed. It's also BYOB, which can be a plus or a minus depending on who you are but certainly makes the meal more affordable. I'll be back again; given how much they've taken on I'm willing to forgive a few missteps here and there.

Also tried the daily special, some whitefish infused spread that sounded like a train wreck. But couldn't have enough of it. Know that there isn't a ton of selection for the mains, to be expected considering the premise of the place. Was disappointed by the two seafood dishes we had- the trout and whitefish ham hoc stew. Both flavor fails, for lack of having much, and skimpy on substance. Tried a bite of the hanger steak. That was more on par with the starters, so bank on it instead.

The only thing exciting about our pasta entree was rabbit sausage, and the fish entree was completely under-seasoned.

Forced smiles, all! What, you don't like metaphors? Especially wrong ones? Hmmm, one supposes Mado is figurative free: this remains one of the few Chicago contemporary American restaurants cooking honestly, cooking true. And if Mado should occasionally err on the side of caution--sometimes a tomato really is just a tomato--it more than suffices for its sheer (ironic?) boldness in unadornment: ingredients as ingredients; food that tastes like, well, food. That's what Sundays are for--other than grown men in shoulder pads giving each other reacharounds, I mean. So, notes for the early half of October (because all of this will change soon): -The pig ear salad is, however wet, is impeachable: unctuous pork meat, sweet squash, herbaceous greens. -the farm egg bruschetta is pretty near perfect. -The arugula salad with couscous is a really simple, really lovely dish, with nice bitter(greens), nutty (almonds), and acidic (lemon vinagrette) notes. -The trout with brown butter on top of corn/succotash was not the best trout variation in Mado's history--for me, the early version with romesco or the one stuffed with pork belly are the paragons--but was lovingly cooked over charcoal; the corn-succotash blend underneath was pretty incredible. -The beef heart is intensely smoky, intensely meaty. My heart felt jealous. -the chicken was about as good as can be expected for a simple half-chicken dish. Dessert was, to be expected, very good: the surprise was the apple tart, which had just the right touch of cinnamon. The peach/pistachio crisp was fine, though the peaches were a little overcooked.

For main dishes, we tried the rainbow trout and hanger steak and while good, consensus between us both was that it did not blow us away for either dish. Desert was migas bark which sounded interesting when described by our waitress, but was essentially an expensive chocolate wafer. I was hoping for something more exotic.

Definitely plan on making reservations as popping in (yes, even late) on Friday night yielded a 2 hour wait time (see my Plan B review if you're looking for an effective way on how to pass said time). Fortunately Miss Mado was well worth the wait... what a fantastically tasty and adventurous dinner! Ever sampled a pork heart? How 'bout a pig's head?

I must've left my exploratory pants at home that night because I went with a more demure menu, but one that didn't fail to impress in the slightest.  Allow me to break it down would ya?  Apps // The Meat Platter. Seriously, you can't go wrong with meaty goodness served up on a tray.. pork rilette, chicken paté and country paté. Rich, indulgent, house butchered and totally satisfying. Buck up for the 'accompaniments' at an add'l $4... the bread, mustards and pickles are oh-so-necessary.  Apps // Roasted Eggplant with Rosemary Honey. I die!! Such a winning combo of sweet and savory, and that rosemary honey? Best new condiment '09 award. I'd put it on my cereal. For reals.  Salad // Mixed Greens with Pine Nut Vinaigrette. So simple, but utterly delectable. Loved the clean palate and unfussed with straightforwardness of this dish. Great transitional plate, and although a few of my fellow diners found the greens a bit too salty, I totally dug it.  Main // Hanger Steak with Gorgonzola Polenta & Moroccan Spiced Roasted Chicken. Both = Delish. I loved that crispy, roasted chix skin but was definitely leaning toward the perfectly cooked steak (medium rare, thank you) and orgasmo, cheesy polenta as my fav... can polenta really be a showstopper? If it's Mado's, then hells bells yes.  Dessert // Almond and Cornmeal Cake with Sour Cherry Jam, Goat Cheese, Mascarpone Cream, Candied Almonds. Dude. Dessert Utopia.

Food:   Meat Platter (Salume, Pork Rillette, Chicken Liver Pate): My favorite part of this was the Chicken Liver Pate.....I could not stop eating this and I am usually not a pate or liver kind of girl. I really, really, really wanted the Salume to be good....but alas it wasn't....not very flavorful and kind of dry...boo :(  The Pork Rillette was good.....not as good as the pate....but good.

Mixed Greens w/ Pine Nut Vinaigrette: It was recommended by our server and she was not wrong.....Loved this salad....simple and fresh....good flavors....perfect starter for a meal.   Shishito Peppers Fried in Olive Oil w/ Sea Salt: One of our table peeps ordered these and I tried a couple....Thought these were tasty as well....again, really simply done.....lightly charred on the outside...with a little salt and oil...the peppers had a bit of heat which I liked.   Hanger Steak w/ Gorgonzola Polenta: I was really excited for this dish but in the end was disappointed.....the meat, while cooked to a perfect medium/rare, was over salted.....and when I say over....I mean it was all I could taste....extra boo :(  The polenta was good....could have been more gorgonzol-y.....and def could have been creamier.   Whitefish w/ Cherry Tomatoes (and I think some sort of greens....honestly can't remember....I was 1.5 btls of wine in): I really liked this dish....fish was fantastic...crispy skin....firm but flaky....overall flavors were good and the dish was filling without being heavy. Migas Bark: We had this for dessert and me being not a lover of the sweets.....I loved this!! Dark chocolate with some sort of nuts and what tasted like rice crispies.....mmmmmm....mmmmmm.....good.....I would get this every time!! Service: Our server was fantastic!!

We ordered the rainbow trout (good, but not exceptional), chicken (rather large serving and very juicy), the Sicilian seafood stew (holy %&amp;*$, WOW!), and the ""special"" fish (good, but not memorable enough for me to remember what it was). The dishes came solo except for some garnish, so...be prepared to order sides if you're hungry...and that adds up. THE SIDES:: the beet dish was amazing. The combination of mustard and pistachios was perfect, and it was worth the $6. The tart was delicious, but small enough that it fit in my hand, and allowed each of us to have one bite...Good on Mado--we had to order a second just to satiate our taste buds. The marinated olives were fantastic...but really, how can you screw that up? (TIP: The buck's a lot bigger than the bang of these appetizers, so if you're at all concerned about the cash your gonna drop for the amount of food, I'd advise you steer clear of that tarts...) and THE DESSERTS::  Metropolis coffee. Brewed right. Good stuff. The glorified (so much so, maybe they should be served at mass) shortbread cookies...eh, maybe the hype killed it for me, but they didn't blow me away. They were REALLY, REALLY airy. In fact, my friend's ended up on her lap  the minute she picked up the whole cookie, b/c they are THAT airy. And they're really sugary. I guess if you prefer a more buttery shortbread cookie, this one isn't for you. The migas bark: pretty good, but really chocolaty, and we're talking RICH, DARK chocolate. Too much for one person to handle, good enough to share. My fav: the poppy seed cake with lemon curd and cream cheese icing. Wow. It sounds sweet, but really wasn't over the top. I'm not a huge fan of sweet deserts, and this was mouth-watering A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  couple more TIPS: If you're going w/ a group of 3 or 4, and any of you are claustrophobic or over  100 lbs., ask them to NOT sit you by the windows when you make your reservations. You can't fit. It's horribly uncomfortable. I'd also recommend making a reservation. We went on a Thursday night and by 9:30/10:00 the place was PACKED!

2009-06-18,4.0,"Mado had some of the best food I've eaten in a restaurant in a long time. Or just eaten in general. Seriously. My wife and I shared the bacala and snap peas to start and the bacala was absolutely great. It could've used some sort of thin crisp bread to accompany it, otherwise it's reminiscent of eating straight belly lox, but still great. The snap peas, on the other hand, should be taken off the menu. I mean, they were fresh, and they were good, but they were snap peas with some lemon juice and a leaf or two of mint for $6. Maybe they were cooked slightly? As a starter for a meal, it definitely makes the wrong statement, actually leaving us wondering if this place was going to be a pretentious joke.  Well, it wasn't. I got the casuela (pork meatballs w/ chickpeas and braised greens), my wife got the grilled rainbow trout and we were both blown away by how good each one was. They were totally different, and both totally amazingly great. I routinely mentioned how I hadn't eaten anything quite this good in forever. Wow.  Dessert was no slouch, we got the fresh ricotta w/ honey, and the migas bark, and probably could've easily shared one or the other. Both great, both worth ordering though. And the most ample portions of the night, surprisingly. Only two real problems. Service was mediocre, the waiter had a way of dismissing questions about the menu, and seemed hurried. Could've just been an off night, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt there, and there was a big table also to attend to. But when you ask what something is, and the response is ""It's exactly what you think it is"" (on his description it actually turned out to be NOT what I thought it would be, humorously) doesn't befit an upper level restaurant. Give me a reason to be excited about the food, and I won't resent spending too much money on it.  One other tiny thing, we had to ask for bread. They even mention that they bake it themselves, and it's great bread, but it doesn't automatically come with the meal. Which seemed odd, in that some things don't need it, but the casuela was much better as a result of having something to sop up the broth in the dish.

We were first surprised by the unusually small crowd inside the restaurant (one other table was filled) - it felt uncomfortably empty - which is strange considering the neighborhood and Chicagoan's obsession for brunch.  This sense of unease only got worse as we settled in to our table and noticed the bizarre choice of backround music... an oldies station on the radio - I love oldies, and the radio - but in a restaurant especially in the morning listening to the blaring ads was just jarring. Then came the ordering process... Admittedly my friends and I can be a little high maintenance - IE. I like to mix decaf and regular coffee together, and my friend likes to explore the whole menu with the waitstaff. Usually this kind of behavior is fine at brunch restaurants but it became quite an issue with our server, who was not well informed about the farms, ingredients or sides that came with certain items on the menu. Now for the food - it was great! Odd choices on the menu, not a french toast, pancake or other sweet breakfast in site - but a nice selection of egg dishes. I had the asparagus omelet that came with a fresh green salad. Good but not mind blowing. Also - you have to pay extra for toast - which, granted, comes with a tasty homemade apple butter...  In short, good omelet, strange atmosphere and un-brunch like menu choices - would not recommend for brunch, but would be open for trying again for dinner.",0.9913,0.744,0.183,0.073,0.49438644688644695

2009-05-10,5.0,"I think Mado's websites describes it perfectly, ""Midwestern Farmers, Mediterranean Flavors.""  The first word that pops into your mind with every dish is FRESH.  Heck, they print their menu every day to keep up with their daily supply of meat and produce.  I guess one complaint could be that if you find a dish you love, it may not be on the menu the next time you visit.  In my opinion, though, I think that defines a truly foodie dining experience. We went with a group of six and I'm so glad we did because we tried nearly everything on the menu.  The house cured smelts were the right balance of sour and salty (yum!), the blood pudding was incredibly moist, the wood-grilled hangar steak was perfectly medium-rare and smokey, and the chicken liver pasta was rich and flavorful.  I could go on and on about how well Mado prepared their fresh ingredients.  All the desserts were great too, but the buttery, crumbly shortbread was the true standout (who knew shortbread could be this good?).  The best part was that all the appetizers were under 10 dollars and all the entrees under 20 dollars.  Considering how much effort goes into acquiring and preparing the locally-grown ingredients, this is a real bargain. The BYO policy is a huge plus (no corkage fee), especially since they go to the trouble of refrigerating your bottles (an absolute necessity for beers) and the server never let our bottles run out without bringing the next one.  The service was attentive and engaging, and the chef came out later in the night to speak to all the tables.  His passion for his food is obvious.

And speaking of limited ingredients, apparently the only seasoning the chef had access to was SALT.  The food was so salty we could barely choke down our food (one friend spit out his bite of my omelette).

I had to send my food back it was so salt.  My gf's omellete was overcooked - it had the consistency of a sponge, and it also tasted of pure salt.  I actually became upset at my gf for NOT sending the omellete back, as this was also barely edible.  Cooking 101 is to TASTE the food, and it was pretty clear the chef didn't do this.  Also, for only 8 people in the entire restaurant, I'm at a loss as to why it took 30-min to get our food out. When we walked by the restaurant, we actually thought it was closed.  There was grafitti on the windows, the place was empty at first glance, and it was dim inside.  We walked in, and realized there just weren't many people there.  That should have been the first clue. Bon Appetite said their homemade jam was incredible.  The only jam available was their apple butter, costing $2.00 and served with 4 pieces of airy sourdough bread.  The jam was okay, as was the bread.  We ordered brunch, and I ordered the recommended chicken hash, my gf ordered the herbal omellete, and the other couple ordered the chicken hash and eggs diablo (poached eggs in spicy tomato sauce).  We all agreed the service was poor (the place was almost empty, and our server seemed a tad despondent.)  Why does it take so long to get food in a 1/2 empty place? In short: PROS: They purchase from local merchants, and I hear their meats are good for dinner.   CONS:  WAAYYYY too much salt on the food and average service.  Does the chef TASTE any of his food?   CONCLUSION:  With so many good brunch places in the area (Bongo Room, Feast, McDonalds), I would avoid.  If you have $ to blow, and they get in a new chef, front staff, clean the spray paint off the windows and improve speed, I MIGHT try the charcutterie if I had no other place I wanted to try.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",0.9281,0.853,0.089,0.058,0.46742424242424235

So with a couple bottles of my favorite reds in hand we pushed open the door on Saturday night. We were quickly seated and our server Ben came by to open our wine and to help us navigate the menu (which is also posted on a large chalkboard in the room)  There were certainly some things I had never heard of before on the menu (can you say ""rolled pigs head""?) but since I had heard that they use all the parts of the pig and butcher it on site- while it didn't entice me to order it- the way it was described almost had me. Almost.  Instead- we opted for the grilled octopus with giant beans and a lovely herb and ricotta tart that were both delicious! I also ordered the potato bacon soup (had to get some of that butchered pig in some form!) The soup was amazing! Creamy and rich with big chunks of bacon.  As for our entrees- we split the hangar steak with polenta and the grilled chicken with pea sprouts and almonds. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside- and the steak was so tender you could cut it with a fork!  Hard to believe we had room for dessert after all of that but we did. And since indecision kicked in- we ordered three of them- the poppy seed cake with cream cheese frosting, the shortbread (this has been written up in various publications) and migas bark.  What? You've never heard of migas bark? Well, neither had I, but I know I will never forget it now. Tasting like a high end Nestle's crunch bar, migas bar is bitter dark chocolate poured over toasted bread crumbs and then served hardened in pieces. Perfect accompaniment to your after dinner espresso!  Service was spot on- this is a place that knows what customer service is. We even made some new friends (given the close proximity of the tables) as we shared one of our bottles of wine with the couple at the table next to us while we shared desserts.  Metered street parking is available but with all the bars in the area- is a bit of a challenge after 9 and there is no valet service. Not sure I will be eating ""rolled pigs head"" any time soon but Mado's innovative menu, tasty desserts and great service will certainly bring me back again.",0.9958,0.825,0.148,0.027,0.6087590187590188
2009-04-13,3.0,"We really, really want to love Mado. We've been there twice, and both experiences were okay. Just okay.  PROs: The menu is creative and uses local ingredients, and the servers are excellent. The decor is simple but classy, and the BYOB feature is nice. Steaks (hangar steak and NY strip) were perfectly cooked if a bit overly simple. Desserts are consistently good.  CONs: We've been disappointed by the sides at Mado. The polenta is bland (I make better polenta at home) and the patatas bravas are sub-par filler food. I had a white bean soup that the waiter raved about, but it was underseasoned and tasted basically like pureed canellini beans right out of a can. My husband's fish was really fishy and smelled terrible. He sent it back.

The atmosphere of this place is pretty unique, and EVERYTHING on the menu (even the bread) is made fresh that same day. The restaurant gets everything from the farmer's market, and they have a listing of all the local farmers they purchased their ingredients from. The air was kind of smokey -- they have a wood fire grill in their kitchen which caused smoke in the restaurant, but it wasn't anything too bad that made me uncomfortable or anything. I ordered the calamari for an appetizer and the  chicken with arugula and almonds as my main course. The calamari was very flavorful and I liked it a lot - it was just slightly salty for my taste so I had to drink a lot of water while eating it. Everyone who ordered the pig ears as the appetizer at my table was dissatisfied with them, although I think that is because they are ears, not because of the restaurant. The chicken I ordered was fine - nothing spectacular. There was nothing really unique about it. My friend ordered the pasta with truffle oil sauce, which I am really jealous I did not order -- that was REALLY delicious and would have been a much better choice than the chicken.

After being turned down by our favorite restaurant in the city, for our wedding night, Mado stepped up. We are so happy that our first choice fell through! The owner's, husband and wife duo Rob and Ali (sp? sorry!) were in tune figuring out a way to get our family of 10 in the door on our special day and just wowed us.

2009-03-10,5.0,"Pros: BYOB. Charcuterie and other meats. Desserts, especially the shortbread. Monthly family dinners. Cons: None, unless you're a vegetarian. So first a disclaimer - this restaurant is a mainstay for us. If we're in the mood to go out to eat and want a really nice, leisurely meal, this is where we come. We take our relatives here - in fact, my father-in-law suggests that Mado compares well to the French Laundry back in the day. Mado is a locally-sourcing, farm friendly restaurant. It's run by a husband and wife team, he's the chef de cuisine and she's the pastry chef. It's BYOB, runs a wood fire oven, the menu changes depending on the season and what's available (although there're some dishes that are always on there). If you get on their email list, you can be informed about monthly family style dinners that usually are themed around some sort of animal, vegetable or event. The restaurant is very comfortable, and the owners / employees are really friendly. If you sit at the ""bar"" you can watch some of what happens in the kitchen and listen in to the work-related chit chat, which is fun. Also, they don't seem to mind if you order in flights, so don't feel pressured to plan your whole meal out at once (unless you like that sort of thing). Some more specific suggestions -  1) Don't expect huge portions. This place isn't about overwhelming you with the amount of food you get.  2) The chef specializes in meat and utilizes the whole animal (last time we were there he was breaking down a pig in the back room), so focus on that. Get the charcuterie plate. Get the salad with pig's ear. Get the beef heart if they have it, and if that's too adventurous for you, you can't go wrong with the wood-fired chicken. If you want a little veggie side or some delicious polenta, go ahead, they're nice additions to your meal.  3) The wife is a pastry chef. You'd be nuts not to get dessert. The shortbread is amazing if you can't think of anything else, but she's always got 6-8 possibilities. Chocolate cream pie, rice pudding, marshmallow cake, it's all great. In fact, do yourself a favor and get two. Pro tip: You can save room for two desserts by not eating your vegetables. Who cares about vegetables anyway when you've got whole carcasses of delicious animals in the back room, and a chef who loves preparing them for you?",0.9931,0.863,0.126,0.011,0.5480902777777779

The fish dish was just that.  A fish, no garnish, served on a white plate.  Every dish was very small and boring.  I love going to a dinner and disecting every flavor and ingredient, but I couldn't even identify basic flavors or anything that I really liked about any of the dishes that were on our table.

2009-01-11,2.0,"There's good news and bad news here.  The good news is that the food is interesting and pretty tasty.  The bad news is that my experience at this place really drives home the fact that interesting and tasty food isn't all it takes to have a good meal, and that list starts and ends with good service. I think there's supposed to be something special about this place - seasonal menu? local produce? - and I wish some one would've told me something about that. Unfortunately, we didn't get a lot of interaction with our server.  We showed up on time for an 8:30 reservation and had to wait for a table, which isn't a big deal, especially since the hostess was so gracious about it.  Once we were seated, we also waited a while for our server, which wouldn't have been a big deal, except that it meant that it took us until 9:15 to be waited on, which was legitimately irritating. From there, there were a series of missteps that allowed for small details to kind of ruin what was otherwise a good - maybe exceptional - meal.  We really didn't see much of our server, and everything seemed to take a while coming out of the kitchen, which was confusing, because I thought this was supposed to be one of those restaurants in the trend of small plates/make-your-own-tasting-menu thing.  Maybe I was wrong about that - but almost everything on the menu is or can be ordered in an appetizer portion. We had a couple of really good appetizers and then asked to get a tasting size of the lamb rigatoni first, and the chicken entree after that.  They ended up taking a while and coming out at the same time - which wouldn't have been an issue, except that the lamb was pretty spicy, so eating the chicken at the same time was a really bad idea.  If there was any flavor in that chicken at all, I doubt I would have been able to taste it.  Also, I really wanted the pork shoulder, which they ran out of, and since I wasn't up for beef heart and by boyfriend is allergic to fish, the chicken was pretty much our only option. Given that they're still BYO at present but we had high expectations for the meal, we brought a kind of nice bottle of wine, and we were supposed to drink it out of juice glasses. I know - it's a trivial complaint, and I cringe a little writing it - but there's a reason wine glasses are shaped like like they are, and this is the kind of detail you'd want a nice restaurant to get right.  (Though I'd be totally remiss not to say thanks to the guy who found us some wine glasses - that was awesome.) I wouldn't complain about any of these things if I were writing about say, Bite, where they're going to serve you really good food at really cheap prices while you sit in cracked vinyl booths and drink your wine out of juice glasses and you're gonna like it or find another BYO place... but Mado is is not cheap - not outrageous, but certainly not in the Bite price range - and if you're spending that kind of money, I think there's a a reasonable expectation that some one is paying attention to the details and that the service be a cut above proficient.",0.9593,0.834,0.099,0.067,0.6045394223263075

I think Mado would be consistently packed if it were located on restaurant row (Randolph in the West Loop) but it clearly hurts to be located at the Pandora's Box that is Wicker Park/Bucktown, where quality sometimes goes to die.  Judging by the reviews below, people need their HFCS in this neighborhood (there was nothing tasteless/bland or canned and it is a shame that some previous reviews suggested so), and you will not find any of that at Mado...you get pure, fresh ingredients made by an ambitious and savvy husband-wife team (search the web for ""sky full of bacon 04"" for an awesome documentary on this restaurant).   Anyhow, the menu changes regularly, but honestly it doesn't really matter what is on the menu on a given night because you come here for the quality and freshness and should try whatever they can dish out because it will be made right.  You can't have faith like that at a lot of places in Chicago unless you are paying over $150.

I live about 2 blocks away, I like their commitment to local products, and I applaud their husband and wife small business efforts.  I wanted to support this great-looking storefront place.   However, the two times I have been there have been entirely disappointing.  Most recently, my husband and I were there early (5:30PM) on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. Regardless, the server asked us every 30 seconds if were ready to order (as if a tour bus was pulling up any second).  We ordered 3 antipasti and 2 entrees.  The antipasti were underwhelming. We had white beans that tasted like they came from a can. We had ""roasted"" carrots that were hard as rocks.  There was not a bit of bread or cracker or anything on the table.... For entrees, we ordered the skate and chicken. The skate came on the bone (as expected) however, striped with bloody tendons and undercooked pieces. Completely unappetizing. When the server eventually returned to our table (after my husband was finished and the wine was gone, etc.), he took a look at the bloody bones and uneaten pieces on my plate and asked if I would like them cooked more, offering a vague apology for having the first skate wing out of the kitchen that evening. Huh? Meanwhile, my roast chicken-loving husband said the roast chicken was at best...average.  If you can cook simple white beans and a simple roast chicken dish better at home....  Service was spotty, at the very best. It's hard to go to a BYOB spot and sit through multiple courses with an empty bottle and no corkskrew... My bottom line: if you advertise yourself as a restauranat that strives to use local, organic ingredients and classic preparations, your food should back you up. The product and preparation should result in simple, clean, beautiful flavors.  Your customers should not wait through bad service for very average food.

First off, let's start with the fact that our server got one of our two appetizer orders wrong and the one she got right was the right dish but different ingredients than what she described. Who wants to eat clams and chickpeas? Not me! I would have perhaps enjoyed the citrus marinated sea bass, calamari and chickpeas she told me I would be receiving but what I got instead was a flavorless, poorly-constructed dish. The chickpeas actually tasted canned. I didn't think in a farm oriented restaurant you would find canned beans served, but my husband who cooks lots of chickpeas confirmed they were almost certainly canned! Boooo!  I got a fish stew as my entree and it was quite nice, however after the 45 minute wait after our apps were cleared and our bottle of wine tapped, I wasn't much in the spirit to enjoy. I just wanted to get out of that place. I'm generally not one to judge a restaurant based on its crowd because they have no control over who walks in the door, but after this inordinate passage of time I became increasingly aware of the overwhelming presence of afluent, single-family-home Bucktown dwellers in the restaurant. The kind who blew their diets, stayed out past their babysitters' bedtimes and got really drunk, loud and and cursed.

I love that they utilize local farmers and only serve what is directly in season.  I love winter vegetables and spices that pair with them.  For example, sage.  I adore sage.  When paired with a butternut squash and some brown butter you can almost expect tears from me.  I saw a butternut squash and sage risotto and I almost jumped out of my chair.  The first taste was amazing....and it just kept getting sage-ier.....and sage-ier.....and SAGE-IER......not a well balanced dish.  The gorgonzola polenta?   Expect no more flavor than gorgonzola.  The bone marrow bruschetta?  Parsley.  Everything we had was just, well kind of, underwhelming.  Daring, creative, underwhelming.  I wanted to love it.  I really really did.

To tell the truth, we should have left right then and there. But for some reason we stayed. I'm assuming the problem was that we had a kid with us, because we were still seated within five minutes at a new table (so it wasn't a space issue). In other words, expect them to hate kids. Also, although they may think they're all saavy, what kind of dumb restaurant owner rolls her eyes at customers standing fifty feet away? Also, don't believe the hype about the food.

You could taste each individual ingredient. Next was the charcuterie plate that featured a great salami, buttery coppa, wild boar terrine, and lamb testa. With the bread, mustard, and pickled vegetables, this plate of hand crafted meats made for a great lead in to the meal. Next, we shared roasted trout with farro and chestnuts and a plate of beets and pistachio.  The trout was incredibly light and the skin perfectly done.

2008-10-18,2.0,"A group of four of us ate here last night. This place needs to get over itself. We were pretty disappointed overall and would not recommend it to friends.  Pros:  --Atmosphere was nice, tables weren't too crowded --The food we had was pretty good. That's the only reason why I didn't give it 1 star (but read below about selection and portion sizes). --The BYOB helps keep the price tag down. They will put beers in the refrigerator for you and return extras to you at the end without you having to ask for them (which would be awkward). They did not offer any kind of ice bucket for the wine, however.  Cons: --The menu is pretty limited and constantly changing. The tagliatelle that you read about in other reviews on here wasn't on the menu last night, for instance, but it's not gone forever.  --The night we went (a Friday night), there were ZERO vegetarian entrees. Thus, my vegetarian wife had to combine several small appetizers and left hungry. This is because they permit NO substitutions. They had a pasta risotto dish with pork ribs last night, and she was not able to get it without the pork ribs. They are extremely rigid about this, which is ridiculous. This isn't the 1970s, people these days have all sorts of food restrictions (lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, vegetarian, vegan, etc.) and to be so unaccomodating really made us not want to return. In addition, two of us ordered the hanger steak and it came with a gorgonzola polenta. We wanted to substitute the polenta for potatoes (one of the sides) and after some grappling our waitress finally agreed not to provide the polenta but charge us extra for the potatoes side. Come on...are you serious? --The portion sizes were INCREDIBLY small. It felt like tapas, except not quite at tapas prices. The two hanger steak entrees MAYBE equated one standard hanger steak. It also came pre-sliced which we thought was odd, and since we didn't want the polenta that came with it, it came on a 4x4 plate which also made it feel like we were eating tapas. The salads were on the small side as well.  --Our waitress was very unenthusiastic and generally not very nice. She seemed offended when we asked about a ""bone marrow"" dish and thought it sounded kind of icky (do you eat bone marrow often?). She was also unwilling to ask the chef about substitutions and/or options for a vegetarian. I rarely leave less than 20% for a dinner but last night I was compelled to leave 15% due to the attitude.  --Not a big deal, but no valet parking in a part of town where it can be difficult to find a spot. My advice to yelpers: avoid My advice to the owners: loosen up the substitution restrictions, get rid of the wait staff's attitudes, increase portion sizes, and make sure there's a vegetarian option on the menu every night.",0.3599,0.865,0.072,0.063,0.5197373393801965

I appreciate their concept (sustainable, organic, local food whenever possible) but I cant say I have enjoyed my dining there. The place looks pretty good. (I remember when it was some horrid Italian restaurant that was one of the top 10 worst dining experiences I ever had!) It's exposed brick and minimal decor all around. Music is not too loud or weird or boring. Oh, and I'm all for saving the planet, but can a sister get a water glass please that gets refilled-is that too much to ask? They also have late night hours, the pickings become slim as the evening wears on, but it beats Flash Taco at 11 on a friday night. The service is...well It was never great. Both times I have been there it was not too busy and the chefs (a husband and wife team) are freindly and accommodating, but their staff is really not so much.  At best they may be helpful describing the food, but they are not especially attentive. I also must say my 2nd time started off rocky b/c I was sitting next to an obnoxiously loud Trixxie who needed to lay off the BYOB wine. The food. That's the point, right? It's been so hit or miss. 3 weeks after they opened the fella and I came in very close to closing so they already had shut down the wood fired grill, limiting the options leaving mostly cold foods and those already prepared (such as soup) available. We were treated to an AMAZING gratis tapas of green olives; Spanish, I think; which were appreciated and adored.  The rest of the meal was forgettable aside from some rosemary roasted potatoes. Some decent cheeses and sausages (including some head cheese which was ok). I don't fault them for that - it was late,and they are new. The didnt rush us out as long as we didnt mind them cleaning around us. The 2nd and most recent time offered the full menu. Regrettably, this was a month or two ago and before I joined Yelp, so I dont remember most of the dishes we ordered. The standouts were an oil poached tuna, which I loved. this was completely new to me and I didnt know what to expect . After having it here, I doubt many other places will be able to impress me as much. the sunchoke (which when we grew them in out backyard, we called them Jerusalem artichokes) salad - perfect, simple, earthy, and delicious. I could eat this over and over again. Most finer dining places ALWAYS disappoint me with dessert. Not here. In fact, the dessert is the standout portion of their menu. The panna cotta is delicate, creamy, and perfectly  sweetened and the quality of ingredients shows with the perfect strawberries that arrive with it. The dates with coffee and honey are unique, simple, elegant and decadent. This is a ""foodie"" dessert with such complicated flavors so delicately balanced.  I cant wait to try the shortbread. That's all the good I have on the food.  Ok fine simple, but also inconsistant-for every great dish, we got 2 really mediocre ones. Nothing bad, but not good enough to bother wanting to come back for them. I have yet to be impressed with any of the entrees.  I'm kinda grossed out but the giant portions many places serve, but the portions here are mostly *tiny* Like, small, dude. Though you might run across an abnormally giant dish here and there-it's weird. My guy got a giant half of some boring chicken.   It's BYOB YAY!   Food prices are  a bit high for entrees. The small plates prices are usually high considerign the portions sizes. I know someone is going to be all like ""but it's organic and sustainable and quality costs more blah blah blah"" well yeah, but it's still TINY. And not enough of the dishes are the fantastic experiences that make me not mind paying higher prices for them. The dates and the olives I'd have happily paid a small fortune for, as opposed to the pasta which was forgettable. It's an interesting dining experience. The quality of the ingredients is obvious, the execution of pretty much everything is lacking. The standouts are unique and delicious.

I couldn't tell if the carrots in the beet and carrot salad were supposed to be cooked or raw. The garbanzo beans were most definitely undercooked, and the gorgonzola polenta that came with my steak should have just been called gorgonzola - that's all you could taste, although the steak itself was quite tasty.  Plus, the bruschetta was very hard to eat, we had spring peas and garbanzo beans rolling all over the plates, and the crostini was loaded with butter to the point of being soggy.  We loved the flavor and taste of the homemade pasta, but we felt the noodles were about 60 seconds of boiling water away from even being al dente - kind of a turn off.  And don't even get me started on the pea soup. There were these little chocolate crusted cookie wafers for dessert that were melt in your mouth good, but i was kind of hoping to see them do something a little more interesting with the rhubarb, one of my favorites, which was simply layered with whipped cream - parfait style.

2008-07-02,4.0,"We had reservations at 7:30 on a Tuesday night but were running late so I called asking if we could move our reservation to 8:00. The very nice-sounding person on the phone said it was no problem. Oh oh, I thought. That was way too easy, they must be empty and no one eats at this place. Boy, was I wrong! We got there a few minutes past 8:00 and there was only one empty table waiting for us. So far, so good. Then we waited for what seemed like forever for someone to come to our table. We had come over from Violet Hour (hence the lateness) and I wanted to keep the buzz on but couldn't seem to service quick enough.  We finally got to order - meat platter as the appetizer, trout, hangar steak and 2 of us ordered the pork belly. One bite into my trout and any thoughts of the slow service were completely forgotten. Honestly, I've never ordered trout before and not really sure what made me order it this time but I'm so glad that I did. I also had tastes of the steak and the pork belly and they were delicious but I think my trout was still the best dish. We also had side dishes of roasted potatoes which really didn't have any wow factor for me but others seemed to like them. When we got our check, it was $52. A quick glance at the four $18 entrees was easy to see that this was wrong. Final answer? $97 for dinner for 4. Not bad, although it was BYOB. In summary, I love this place. The food was very, very good. The service could use a little help but I'm sure they'll work things out.",0.9724,0.732,0.157,0.111,0.6669097222222223

As far as the sides go, the white bean side dish was completely overcooked, the polenta was under seasoned and the potatoes were undercooked (and over oiled).  Oh, and I could have gone to Jewel to pick up a roast chicken that was more interesting than Mado's.   We all felt like we should have told people coming in the front door to save their money.   I'm giving Mado two stars because the waitress didn't charge us for the pork or substitute pasta dish, at least she understood our complaints.  Too bad, we all wanted to love this place!",0.8436,0.808,0.116,0.075,0.4350198412698412

The ambience was decent and the waitress was superb.  Our first dishes were good, but nothing special.  Unfortunately, that's where my compliments run out. The tagliatelle was overseasoned and the only discernable flavor was salt. The Pork Paillard was burnt, dry, and tough. When I got my cheese for dessert, I asked for some bread to go with it and was told ""NO.""  Luckily, I asked again when my waitress arrived to check on me and she fetched some right away.

Just realize that means that you may not always get the most amazing dish of your life when you eat here, because the dishes are not cooked again and again and perfected-- that's not the idea! I must have gone on an 'ON' night though, because between the four of us we ordered almost every appetizer and entree on the menu (the menu is small), with the idea to share our plates.  We didn't have an dish we didn't all enjoy.  Now, that's not to say some dishes weren't better than others, like the octopus and the sausage being out of this world . . . but everything was great, and some were fantastic.  I even loved the anchovies, and I wasn't too excited when my fiance ordered them. And the desserts were even better than the rest of the meal.  I bet you can't pick a bad dessert on any evening . . . especially since I believe one of the owners is a trained pastry chef.

2008-06-22,4.0,"I came here least night with my friend Julie, a fellow foodie, to try out this place out. I as usual got here about two minutes after she did and just made it for our 7pm reservation. The place is all exposed brick, a smattering of paintings all over, a nice little bar area, (as I write this it is BYO however it appears it won't be for long), a long chalkboard with their menu, (you do however get your own copy so there is no straining of the neck). Our server came by, very friendly, opened up our bottle of rose cava, and chatted with us about the menu. It is a little confusing, however she deftly guided us through, with suggestions and ideas. The idea is about sharing at this place, so small plates are all over the menu, however there are some monstrous good size plates too.  We started off with the smoked duck breast and the English pea crustini. The duck was great, tender and nice flavor. The crustini missed for me. The peas on top were definitely fresh and tasted great but made it impossible to eat. Perhaps I was thinking of them being in a spread or a paste, but really more like a mound of peas on a thinly sliced bread. This also made the bread soggy... not what I like when I eat a crustini, so it was fork and knives to eat it. Then came the tagliatelle with green garlic scapes, (think garlic scallions), chili and lemon. This was truly a hit for me, great flavor, pasta was done perfect al dente and we were truly happy that we got the large, we could almost not get enough. Then came our main dishes, Julie went with the bluefish and a side of roasted potatoes with rosemary and I went with the roasted chicken and the side of creamy polenta. She was happy with hers, but I loved mine. Probably the best roasted chicken ever, moist, succulent, flavorful and you get half a chicken, plenty enough for two. We just couldn't finish it, however, we wanted to save room for dessert. We got the cocoa panna cotta with two large pieces of dark chocolate bark and a tart filled with strawberries and pistachios. Delicately flavored, I really loved the tart, but also couldn't keep my hands off of the bark... I have a weakness for chocolate. The tab came and we were pleasantly pleased with the amount. I think for the quality of what we got and how much we ate, it was all very reasonable.  A few things to note, the flavors are delicate, they allow the food to come out, not a lot of bold flavors, but more simple and fresh. I love how on their chalkboard they list what farms they are using for the nights meal. I look forward to see what happens when they move from byob to bar and see how their menu changes, especially from season to season.",0.9982,0.791,0.184,0.025,0.6326102292768958
2008-06-17,4.0,"Three things you should know before stepping through the threshold at Mado: 1. A husband-and-wife team run the place 2. Everything is seasonal, local and/or sustainable 3. Small plates really are small...but for $30/person you and your friends can eat like royalty as long as you share everything and treat the meal as a family-style extravaganza We loved our first trip to Mado. House-made charcuterie? Bring it on! A cool spring asparagus soup? Oh yes. A wood-fired grill? Fresh sardines from Spain? Fresh hand-rolled pasta with house-made sausage?  The most tender -and spicy - octopus I've put in my mouth since an imaginary trip to Spain last year? Bring it on, and make mine a double. We loved every bit of the crostini, though we did eat it with a fork to enhance our enjoyment (note to reviewer below: be pragmatic about the way you eat...if hands don't work, use a damn fork!) Mado is a great mid-priced alternative to the mediocrity that seems to have engulfed the area around the Crotch. The food here is tasty and fresh with a strong Mediterranean-by-way-of-California influence. There's nothing particularly styliish or ground-breaking about the food, but it is delicious and reasonably priced.  Dessert was okay - with an improved selection, I'd raise my review one star. Our panna cotta had far too much gelatin in it and was chewy rather than supple and soft. The dates were tasty, but there were no textural or flavor counterpoints to balance out the exceptionally soft and sweet dates.  Perhaps I'm just too picky - the pastry chef in me gets uppity when simple desserts simply aren't executed well. Overall, I'd recommend Mado. Lovely food, well-prepared. Just remember to share. Every last bite. And note to folks ordering cheese: darlings, crackers with cheese is gauche. Really gauche. If you want something to go with your cheese, ask politely for bread. If you aren't being served something, you likely don't need it. But crackers?

We ordered one thing from each category, and they were all either so-so, or straight up not good. The asparagus and duck egg was fine, but there wasn't really anything special about it. We ordered the baby octopus crostini, and neither of us could finish more than a few bites. Maybe we both don't like baby octopus, but I also couldn't pick up my bread to take a bite because it was soggy.  We also ordered the smoked duck breast from the Charcuterie selection, and I did enjoy my two slices. The other passing dish was the home made tagliatelle with green garlic pesto. I liked it, but my boyfriend thought it waaaay to salty. For our main course, we had the pork paillard. After about two bites of bland, over cooked pork, I was finished and wondering how nearly every one of our dishes managed to fail?  To play it safe, we ordered some goat cheese for dessert. A server (not our waitress) brought it, so I asked her if she could bring us some crackers or bread. This was the nail in the coffin- ""No crackers, we only have the bread used on the bruchetta."" Well, that would have been nice, but she walked away and left us with the cheese. We waited a bit and when our waitress came by, she got it for us in less than a minute.

Really really really good. The gorgonzola sauce was perfect with the meat and the potatoes i got on the side. The rhubarb dessert was okay. The other dessert, some vanilla thing with strawberries - that was amazing and exciting. For the most part, everything was good, but the majority of the experience wasn't very exciting.

It's really unfortunate, though, that head cheese has to be called head cheese.  They call it something fancier on the menu but there's no getting around it: it's head cheese.  Fortunately, it's very tasty.  As is the cured little bunny rabbit and the cheeks of some cow we ate.  Love that kind of stuff. Next we shared a hanger steak with Gorgonzola polenta and the wood fired trout.  Perfect, but it would have to be because this place really lets the food speak for itself.  Not too much in the way of sauces or adornment here.  But the flavor is there and it's all good.  The sides are tiny, but this isn't the kind of place that attacks you with large portions.  So you can go on a date and not eat so much that you've got to call it quits for the evening.

The sunchokes, drizzled lightly with lemon juice, olive oil and a dash of parsley, were crunchy and subtly flavored. The beets and blue cheese were a sunny composition. And the bruschetta - whoa! It was love at first bite with an irresistable combo of blistered toast, (so fresh I could smell the cow) ricotta, crunchy toasted hazelnuts, and bitter arugula. I could eat these by the bucketful.  Maincourses were delicious as well - the hangar steak came with a killer portion of soft gooey polenta, and my tagliatelle was toothsome as only the best freshly made pasta can be. Everything tasted mildly underseasoned, but perhaps served to accentuate the flavors of the ingredients themselves. Dessert was a chocolate tart, with some sweetly sharp apricot puree providing a nice balance.  So, now the painful part - the three star rating. First, the prices. Specifically of the appetizers. Call me crazy, but $6 seems a bit much given the miniscule portion sizes. Each of these come down to just a couple bites, and that felt kinda ridiculous, even if the ingredients are organic and locally sourced.  Next the service. Now obviously this is a new restaurant and has some starting sputters to work through, but it felt very, VERY slow.
