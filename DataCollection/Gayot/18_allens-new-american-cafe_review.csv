2009-07-28,5.0,"I loved Allen's and am jealous of Iowa that his newest restaurant is there. The tuna tartar, the casual yet nice atmosphere, the great service, some of the best-prepared fish in Chicago, it was a great mix.  I wish he'd just pared back and stuck around instead of shutting down completely.",0.9371,0.621,0.301,0.078,0.6069444444444445
2006-12-11,5.0,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I love the service, as a former server myself, I can appreciate a fabulous waitstaff, and Allen's truly has one of the best.    The food, which is really why one would go to Allen's is incredible.  Their appetizers, my favorite, Ahi Tuna Tartar, the best I've ever had and I order it a lot of places.  The crab cake appetizer also fabulous.   The entrees, I've had lunch and dinner entrees there.  Their burger at lunch, I mean their are no words to explain just how great it is. It is a perfect size, not overwhelming and huge.   An amazing beefy flavor, not an amazingly well seasoned flavor, but a true, beefy burger flavor that can't be found anywhere else.    What also is fabulous, but may sound very heavy to some is panko crusted crabcake BLT, is not, it is simply wonderful, flavorful and unlike anything you've tasted before.    I personally do not like their waffle chips, but that's such a small thing and such a personal taste preference, I'm just not a cinnamon fan, I could see how others would find them to be completely awesome. Now dinner... I've had the scallops (incredible, must try!) and the pork loin (fabulous, unique!)  I have also had a veal special which was by far the most amazing food that ever passed my lips.  The spaetzel and red cabbage sides were out of this world.   My husband has had the venison and again, no words to describe.  I grew up eating venison and have always been a fan, but my goodness, my mother couldn't prepare a venison steak THAT way. I have never had room for dessert after eating at Allen's, but one of these days I will.  I would eat at Allen's every day or night of the week if I could.   Obviously I highly recommend it.   It's a great restaurant for couples, a fabulous place to take out of town parents, grandparents, friends, etc. too for a special treat.  The decor is simple, not flashy.  This place does not need flashy, decor.  It is all about the food and the service.",0.9973,0.748,0.214,0.038,0.679945652173913
2006-02-26,3.0,"This place has always been good, even through a new change. There's always been something missing though. Either too fancy or not fancy enough. Nice room, nice bar, good service. Just another good new american restaurant that gets lost in the shuffle.",0.6876,0.65,0.22,0.131,0.5259090909090909
2005-12-03,3.0,There's a welcoming bar here and you can start with starters such as frog legs and the Belgian salad was pretty good.  I had the charred dock which was amazing and for dessert - the warm choclate cake with carmelized bananas - yum.  Wine is a bit pricey though.,0.9287,0.726,0.274,0.0,0.72
