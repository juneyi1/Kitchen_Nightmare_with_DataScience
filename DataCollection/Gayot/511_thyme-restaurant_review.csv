2007-07-08,5.0,"Dear Miki S. HOW CAN SOOOOOO MANY PEOPLE BE WRONG?  A.  WHO brings 7 children under 5 years of age to an upscale restaurant???  B. Reservations mean you get the table AT that specific time...not whenever you or your guests decide to stroll in. That is common sense...if I invite you to my house at 6 for dinner....you really think I want you there at 7??  C. And it was not because you are a minority...stop playing the victim and admit that 7 babies and being late is simply rude and unsophisticated. I would have launched you out of my place if you did that.  D. "" I have never, ever, been treated this way---not in Rome, or Sicily or New York, Paris or London""....Really??...you really had to point that out? Did you show up late with 7 kids in those city's (from what you describe) running around rampid in a upscale public restaurant? I'm sure the other people dining appreciated  your kids screaming and acting like ""herding cats"". I've been to all these places too, and I assure you if you had acted the way you descibed yourself at Timo you would have been thrown out in 4 languages. E. I run restaurants and still find the time to dine as well, but I save the kids for Red Robin and Applebees...oh and I would wait until they can talk and walk.....say 10 or over. Get a sitter...everyone will appreciate it. F. Grow up and act like a human being and realize it's not about just about you. I still can't believe you said it was a minority thing? I'm Black and Hispanic, and dine at Timo often.....and guess what!? it's impeccable all the time and everytime! People like you make it difficult for people in the service industry to do thier jobs. You may want to Stay home and try a backyard grill out or catering before attempting a debackle of 13 adults and 7 infants at an upscale restaurant.",0.9544,0.857,0.105,0.038,0.41504247015610646
2006-09-12,4.0,"Timo (formerly Thyme) is a great restaurant! The food is more Italian bistro than true Italian, but excellent nonetheless. Try the risottos and the spit-roasted items, they were delicious and well-presented. And the pinapple cake for dessert. The wine list has some staples as well as more exotic bottles. I plan to return very soon!",0.957,0.73,0.27,0.0,0.5181818181818182
2006-07-10,4.0,"Thyme is now Timo. Its the same location, same chef etc but he is doing an Italian spin instead of French. This was our first time and we loved it! The interior of the restaurant is very pretty, the kitchen is open and everything was delcious. It is a small restaurant though and you def. want to sit in the main room by the kitchen. There is an additional room that doesn't have the same atmosphere so don't sit in there. The outside area looks beautiful if weather allows. Great Chicago restaurant to try with friends.",0.9834,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.3958333333333333
2006-04-04,3.0,"Had NYE dinner here 2 years ago.  We had a set price ""course meal"" which I felt underachieved, hence, only 3 stars.  The restaurant was very well appointed and service was excellent.  I would go back to sample the standard menu.",0.7264,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.45999999999999996
2006-03-16,4.0,"The atmosphere of Thyme is very cozy and intimate.  I'm not sure what the food is like because I was there for a friend's birthday party and by the time I got there the appetizers they ordered were gone, so I just drank wine the rest of the night.  Great place though- next time I'll have to try the food!",0.8239,0.818,0.151,0.031,0.6427777777777778
2005-12-12,4.0,Very cozy with a great menu.  The open kitchen allows you to see the masters preparing your goumet delights.  The banana crepes leave you craving.,0.8,0.71,0.249,0.041,0.7416666666666667
2005-09-05,4.0,They have a great outdoor patio here and in the winter the inside is just as great!  The decor is awesome. The food is really good and the waitstaff is very friendly.  The only downside is that the menu is a little pricey but this place definitely makes for a great night out!,0.9651,0.643,0.334,0.023,0.7222222222222222
