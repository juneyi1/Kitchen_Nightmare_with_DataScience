But i was interested to check out a new cafe type place in the area and i wanted to try the Maine lobster sandwich. The space is pretty big and there is a fireplace in the middle where you can sit in comfy chairs and wait for your food. It's a damn good thing these chairs are comfy b/c you're going to be sitting in them for at least half an hour. First, they were out of the Maine lobster roll. There's only like 6 sandwiches and a couple salads, so i dont see how they can be out of it. I got the chicken salad club and a side of fruit, which came out to about 8 bucks. 20 mins later my food came out, but no fruit b/c they were out of fruit trays and the morons took another 10 mins to figure out to just put it in a larger container. So not worth the wait or the price.",-0.3218,0.886,0.056,0.058,0.4674715909090909
2007-05-16,2.0,"Considering I went on opening day, you'd think I'd be a little more forgiving...but it was pretty awful.  After I waited 25 minutes for my food...I had the Chicken Salad Club...nothing to get excited about.  I give it 2 stars for the really different interior, that doesn't make up for bad food though.  Really, why would you pay upwards of $12 for not exciting or good food, when for the same price you can have an awesome overstuffed delectable lunch at Coco Pazzo?",0.3952,0.722,0.142,0.135,0.6685897435897435
2007-05-15,2.0,"I'm actually surprised to see a few 5 star reviews for Sugar & Brown's because I was not impressed at all.  First things first, the place itself is very cute.  It feels like an upscale deli with lots of tables and an inviting atmosphere.  When we went up to look at the menu, the menu is behind the cashiers on the wall, and the print is so small that I literally had to read it off to my friend next to me because she couldn't read it- and I was having issues too even though I had my contacts in.  So when we got up to order, we were annoyed because we couldn't read the menu, and the person waiting to take our order was annoyed because we didn't know what we wanted.  They really need paper menus people can take and look at up close!  I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad which sounded really good, and once I ordered they gave me a ticket to insert into this reader at the table.  Then they bring you the food.  Well, we sat down and inserted the tickets and then waited.  Just as we were comenting how futuristic the ordering process was with the ticket, a waiter comes out with food that wasn't ours.  Then he went to the next table and it wasn't their food either, and so on and so on.  So basically their system doesn't work. My friend's salad came out eventually and we had to wait a bit longer for mine.  They did give me a coupon for a free lunch since it took so long but I'm not so sure I want to use it!  Once the salad came out I coudn't eat it. The chicken was pink- it was smoked and smoked chicken usually is pink, but this was dangerously pink chicken- it looked almost raw.  So after I picked off the chicken, I could barely eat more than 3 bites because the dressing tasted so bad.  I'm not one to let food go to waste, but I couldn't eat this salad.  I'm not sure I'll be back, but if you are going to go- I'd suggest ordering a sandwich.",-0.9522,0.884,0.04,0.076,0.5397435897435898

I had high hopes for this salad/sandwich spot that River North needs so badly...James K is right that there aren't many places like this in River North.  And well...I'm sorry, but it looks like Sugar & Brown's is just not going to cut it based on what I saw today. The atmosphere was cool- for some reason it gave me kind of a futuristic vibe.  I had a little trouble ordering off the menu...probably because I couldn't see it! Yes, it's my fault for walking around blind when I could easily wear glasses (I hate the way I look in them), but if they didn't make their menu so darn small I could possibly make out a few words! My friend, Elizabeth N, was getting the smoked thai chicken salad and since we usually have the same taste in food (which is very good taste of course) & I couldn't see anything else I went with that as well.  My salad and a drink came to $12 so I was expecting something gourmet at that price! Gourmet...not so much!  When our salads finally arrived we questioned whether the chicken was actually cooked because it sure looked raw to us.  We've already had an awful case of food poisoning once this year so we decided to push that chicken aside and stick with the lettuce.  The salad dressing was kind of gross too...overall, not a good choice.   They were nice enough to offer Elizabeth a free lunch the next time she comes back since they took so long with her raw looking chicken salad, but something tells me she won't be using that free lunch.  I for sure don't plan on going back anytime soon!",0.7657,0.755,0.131,0.115,0.5888468806325948
