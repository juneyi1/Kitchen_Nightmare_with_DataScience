2011-08-08,5.0,"My big bro dragged me kicking and screaming to this place. No, not really. But it did take me nearly forever to finally muster up the courage to head here. It's been so remarked by him that I liked the dream. Boy am I glad I went. I have been to Charlie Trotters. I went to Tru. But this place, when you factor in the food, ambiance and friendliness trumps BOTH. Bold statement. When you walk in the front door, you're magically transported to someone's living room. Decorations everywhere like Aunt Margaret would have. Tin ceiling. Character that is nurtured, not designed in a studio. That set the stage. My big bro got us a bottle (or two) of a delicious, tall red. We were in for the long haul and CdR was ready for us. We started with an order of mussels (natch) and an order of mushroom soup which we used as a bread dipping. As usual, this odd pairing made for a satisfying first course as we chatted and met our neighbors who were super-friendly. Then the mains: I had lamb and my bro had halibut. With the apps already in us, the main was a good addition without being overwhelming to the waist line. It was just the right size. As he's more familiar, he invited the chef out to join us for a glass of wine. He sat with us for 20 minutes as we talked about the food and his plans for the future. All told, this experience was $100 without tip. For all that it delivers, this is a magnificent place to sample new French cuisine, BYO and take your time.",0.9843,0.834,0.136,0.029,0.5203182619849288

2011-04-21,5.0,"I'm hesitant to tell you about this place -- that's the kind of gem it was. Everything was perfect -- the service, the food, the ambiance. But I have a story to tell. Shortly after my fiancee and I sat down with our bottle of expensive wine to celebrate her birthday, an older couple walks in and sits down. The man starts complaining loudly about the lighting. So they turn it up for him (and tell us, ""dont worry, we'll turn them back down when they're done ordering). Then he screams across the restaurant about the music. They ignore him. He starts asking around if anyone else likes the ""noise."" Another man says, ""we don't like the way you're acting."" He threatens to leave, so waitress turns lights back down to accommodate the nice couples at the tables. Eventually, he shuts up. Our service was impeccable throughout and they seemed more embarrassed about the guy than we were. Definitely a classy place and one that can handle rude, uncouth people. Did I mention how good the food was? Because that bouillabaise is unbelievable. The pork tenderloin was great. The calamari appetizer was fantastic. Crazy that it's tucked in non-descript in a storefront on Broadway. Oh also, my fiancee left her wine bag there and they opened special two days later to give it to her. The place is classy, yet unpretentious and goes out of their way to make sure their customers are happy.  And it better not be busy the next time we want to go there.",0.9807,0.754,0.166,0.08,0.5390376984126984
2011-04-12,4.0,Probably one of the best deals you will find in all of Chicago for very good French food.  This BYOB has a great menu with the typical French favorites and the mussels are fantastic.  The service is excellent and enormously friendly as we bring our 2 year old with us each night and they make sure to have bread ready for him after just a few minutes from sitting.  Overall this is great French food at a very good bargain.,0.9901,0.62,0.38,0.0,0.46758169934640526
2011-03-13,2.0,"The food we had was very good and  the service was very pleasant, but this restaurant is clearly understaffed.  The service was not just slow, it was insanely slow, even for a leisurely French meal.  My husband and I got the feeling there was only one or two people working in the entire establishment on a Saturday night (we saw exactly one employee the entire 2.5 hours we were there.)   If you are understaffed, you underserve.  We weren't able to enjoy the food properly (without bread, how are you supposed to eat pate?  The Cheese Plate may be delicious, but how can we know if you forget to serve it to us?)  That said, the main thing that bothered us was that the restaurant was not clean.  I'm by no stretch of the imagination a neat freak, and I liked the general ambiance of the place, but there was dust and grime everywhere, and an unmistakeable odor of mildew throughout the restaurant, especially in the bathroom (even with two cinnamon candles burning.)  The bathroom was also filthy. Not just ""kind of"" unclean...the white door was almost black in places; and truly, the floor was disgusting. I guess it bothered me most because it's not that hard or expensive to keep a place clean, or to slap a fresh coat of paint on a door if you can't get it clean anymore.  It just takes effort.  It also made me wonder how clean the kitchen was. I doubt we will go back, which is a shame, because the food was good, served in the kind of spot we love to love, and with just a little effort (and additional waitstaff) the whole experience could have been wonderful.",0.8944,0.712,0.157,0.131,0.5973504273504273
2011-02-13,4.0,"This place is a hidden gem. We went there last night to celebrate Valentine's Day and were able to make a reservation just a few hours before coming. The food was outstanding. We had the mussels (amazing!) and cheese plate to start. I got the bouillabaisse as my main course and it was evident that all of the seafood was extremely fresh (salmon, shrimp, mussels, calamari). My only complaint was that they didn't give us spoons to go with the bouillabaisse or mussels. The broth of of both dishes was sooo delicious-- I wanted to lap it up. My fiance had the fish of the day, which was monkfish served with garlic mashed potatoes. He loved it and the sauce was wonderful. These people know how to make a good sauce. We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was perfect. The ambiance was also lovely --dark with nice candlelight-- very romantic.  The service was good but it was definitely a leisurely meal. We brought one bottle of wine, but next time we will probably bring two (maybe one regular size and one split), because the entire meal took about two and a half hours.

2010-12-26,4.0,"We've been going to Cotes Du Rhone for several years and was glad to have a French Bistro come onto the BYO scene. Our group has BYO'd since 9/11 and it's been difficult to find BYOs outside of the usual Thai, Indian, South American, small storefront New American and the occasional Italian style restaurants. I used to live around the corner from Cotes Du Rhone, back when it was a huge Mexican burrito place.  Besides Pasteur, that stretch of Broadway Avenue between Foster and Hollywood was in dire need of decent restaurants and took a nice turn with the addition of La Fonda and a couple of defunct Ethiopian and Bosnian restaurants. Cotes Du Rhone is dark and chocolate looking inside with fancy lamps, empty wine bottles from previous customers lining the window sill.  The dining area is divided into a small room up front with mirrors and a larger room in the back.  Miles Davis and other jazz standards can be heard playing much of the time. Don't go to this restaurant while in a hurry.  The food takes a while and it's perfect for opening a couple of bottles, letting them breathe, chatting with your friends and savoring the moment. It's not a factory and you won't dare be rushed through your meal. At times the chef will come out and chat with the tables so don't be afraid to send him back a nice glass of whatever you're drinking in appreciation of BYO status. Our favorites include the foie gras, escargot, mushroom soup, the wonderful and hot baskets of bread to dip sauces with, any of their white fish dishes, including the sea bass selections, the duck entrees all held together with the wonderful bitter greens, squash and mashed potatoes. The desserts are phenomenal and our favorites include the peanut butter and chocolate bread pudding and the spotted dick. There's a nearby Jewel-Osco that sells wine but check out the liquor store on Foster and Clark in Andersonville. They're pretty knowledgeable and usually sell great bottles of French wine for around $30 on sale.  We picked up a great Châteauneuf-du-Pape on sale for around $30, regularly priced at $70 or so. Was a perfect pairing with our meals. I miss Cotes Du Rhone.",0.9866,0.859,0.113,0.028,0.45374549692731514

2010-10-10,5.0,"I'm reluctant to write this review because Cotes du Rhone is one my Chicago secrets.  I have eaten there many times and every meal has been terrific.  Brian is a bistro chef in the true sense - lots of good, hearty food.  Fortunately Brian has ignored the typical fare of steak frites (which American restaurants typically butcher anyway) in favor of more creative menu items.  Be sure to try the mussels which truly are the best in Chicago - just don't ask about the cholesterol.  The wait staff - especially Stacey - is friendly and professional.  Personally, I like to go on Wed or Thurs nights because the place tends to be pretty quiet.  We always end up hanging around to the end and having a glass of wine with the staff.  It's just that kind of place.  Remember that it's a BYO. Fortunately, it does not have one of those ridiculous corkage fees.  I took Martini fixings one night and we had cocktails before dinner as well - you can figure out your drink theme for the evening.  Hard to beat that deal.  Whatever you do in that regard, you can eat a great 3-course bistro meal and top out at $50/person with your own wine or beer or whatever.",0.9862,0.785,0.179,0.036,0.6305555555555555

2010-04-06,5.0,"Ah, the French. They've given us so much... kissing, berets, pointy iron souvenirs and, of course, French cuisine. Now, I've never been a huge fan of the haute Froggy cuisine that looks more like contemporary sculpture than food, but when you find a cozy little bistro that puts out honest, tasty dishes, there's nothing like it. Luckily for me (and you) there is just such a place right down the street. Cotes du Rhone serves inventive, yet traditional, French cuisine in a relaxed and welcoming environment.  We moved to Edgewater about six months ago and would walk by just about everyday. After confirming that the restaurant is indeed in operation (this stretch of Broadway has been an unfortunate victim in the recent recession) we mentally made note that we need to stop by. We did so last Thursday for the first time and I'm glad we did. The restaurant was nearly empty (us and two other tables), which was a blessing in disguise as it gave us time to talk with our server and have a quiet, unrushed dinner. We already decided on starting with the escargot and mussels (thanks to previous Yelpers) and our selection was quickly supported by our server. The escargot was a tender, garlicy (in a good way, of course) treat - a perfect dish even for snail novices. But, the mussels stole the show. Sweet, not too big and cooked in a delicious cream sauce. We used about half the bread in the basket to sop up what ever drops were left. Next came our entrees. My girlfriend went with the bouillabaisse, stuffed with scallops, prawns, fish, mussels in a nice light broth. I went with one of my favorites - monkfish - the special of the night. The fish was amazing, complemented by an unexpected brown butter sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Stick-to-your-ribs fare, but at the same time, flavorful and not too heavy. The food quality here is superb. They take the time to do things right - making sauces to order and selecting only the best ingredients. I much prefer a small, selective bistro menu over the Tome-like menus of a brasserie. I could easily seeing myself trying everything on the menu at some point. Prices are fair for the quality and servings. Prices are extremely fair considering that this little French shop is BYOB. That's right: a BYOB French restaurant. I never thought that I'd be writing that sentence. I think it's a unique proposition and makes it a little more affordable to treat yourself to a delicious French meal (not to mention splurge on that extra starter or dessert). Chef Brian came out to chat with us about his philosophy and the history of the restaurant towards the end of the meal. I'm always touched when a chef takes the time and energy to meet his clientele and Brian was obviously a passionate and welcoming host. I was surprised to learn that they've been in the same location for three years - a time period when just about every other non-Asian restaurant on Broadway has gone under. Please come and help keep this hidden gem stay alive and kicking - it really is an easy, non-pretentious way to have a delicious French meal. If there is a downside to Cotes du Rhone, it is the fact that it is so dark and hidden away on a fairly industrial street. If only they could get a little livelier boost from more traffic, I think it would solve the problem. Overall, the cozy, jazz-filled atmosphere was great, the staff and owner were so welcoming and the food was amazing. If you want to find honest and delicious French cuisine that won't put you in the poor house, Cotes du Rhone is the place. I only wish we could come by more often.

At first I couldn't tell if it was just an other cool looking restaurant that had gone out of business, as many of them have on Broadway. To my pleasant surprise they are still there! It is a small place but warm. When you walk in you can instantly smell the fabulous aroma of whatever chef Brian is cooking in the kitchen.  It is a little pricey, but nothing too out of the ordinary. I personally do not have a problem paying a little extra to support my community instead of going to some chain where the food is at best mediocre and the service is crap. Our waitress let us know that all the sauces are made to order (and you could really tell). That night my boyfriend and I tried the mussels (they are TO DIE FOR) - I suggest everyone try them and the escargot for the appetizer (the escargot was equally as tasty and very garlicy - just how i like it). For our main course he got the special that night which was monk fish, and I got the bouillabaisse. Both dishes were executed beautifully! The monk fish was cooked perfectly and all the seafood in my dish were melt in your mouth delicious. I have every intention of going back there SOON. Chef Brian came out to our table to greet us, and informed us that the menu is soon changing to a more spring/summer menu. I can't wait to see what he comes up with!!

2009-01-01,2.0,"Oh, my. It is with a tear in my eye that I write this review, and a resolve to stick with original plans - esp. on New Year's Eve.  Original plan: cook delicious food with hawt man, at my hut and swill Veuve. Now that I can cook a lot better (honestly, thanks x-husband) going to a restaurant is sometimes fraught with trepidation. Getting a reservation on NYE a few hours away - priceless, and at one of my favorite restaurants, stellar. I babble like an idiot, so excited to turn a new diner (my seven star companion) onto this great boite that I love, in my 'hood. BYOB Veuve tucked under arm, we walk over. Enter restaurant. Front dining room - empty. Hm. Second dining room - empty. Okay, quiet is good. The prix fixe menu comes out - okay, this is why, we're early for the 8 PM seating. The menu looks great - but honestly, my profuse praise of this place was about their regular menu - simple French country food with luxe touches. We pop the Veuve, and it tastes like stars. Appetizers: my escargot and his foie gras - best part of the meal! This is when it started to go south. Our server, flitting around like a mosquito, forgot to tell Seven Star that they were out of the Veal Chop he ordered until he ordered it - mon dieu! I ordered Lobster Thermidor anticipating juicy decadent lobster goodness.  The mosquito (he was a sweet, cute guy, but perhaps a little overwhelmed as a server) flitted out again - our entrees are ready, did we want our salads at the same time? Hm. Um, just the entree, salad later. The entrees arrive. 7 Star's Pig Chop (oink - hehe!) is wayyyy overdone, and dry. The parsnip puree stacked on top is just sort of weird. My lobster is large, but apparently filled with . . .  StoveTop stuffing. What?! The first few bites were okay, but then I just started to get bored with the mealiness of it. Why tart up a lobster? Scallops and asparagus would be good on their own - just Let There Be Lobster - don't go all Red Lobster on me, man! The Pig Chop gets sent back (and on to my companions THIRD entree choice) - a simple filet, done rare. Easy to cook, right? It arrives . . . overdone. I start to ponder - did they cook everything up ahead and just throw it on the grill again to warm it up? *sigh* By this time, we're bored with eating, and are both wistfully, I think, leering at that other bottle of Veuve which is, alas back at my apartment. But, being the snarky elitists we are, we're still having a fun dinner - snarking! We get the salads, and they are, at best - mediocre. I consider myself something of a vinegarette dilettante, and this one did not have tangy sour bite that I love so much about this type of dressing. I'm also always amazed at how stingy the beets are in most ""beet salads"" - this is not an expensive vegetable, people! Dessert: An afterthought at best. My Lemon Tart is wayyy too large, and needs to read the book ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" - which emphasizes SMALL but toe-curlingly DELICIOUS portions. This thing is Cracker Barrel proportions - almost a quarter of a cheesecake. Companions apple tartin - standard issue apple pie a la mode.  Usually, I am apologetic, and will forgive an off dining experience. But dammit, I LOVE this restaurant, and this was so below the several excellent EXCELLENT dining experiences I've had here. I also noticed that some of the quirks - harried severs, smoke-filled front dining room, had not been fixed since the opening, some two years ago. And, I'm sorry, but they still need some sort of a bar/reception/foyer/hangout area in the front. It's jarring to walk in, and immediately be in the dining room.

2009-01-01,1.0,"""Always trust your first instinct; it's usually correct."" Truer words never applied more than last night for dinner, and on reflection, the disaster here had far less to do with New Year's Eve ""Amateur Night"" then with what I attribute to year-round amateur management, amateur staff, and a fundamental lack of class. First instinct: bring delicious food to GF's lair; cook dinner, drink Veuve, and stay in, as I have stayed in on NYE most years for countless recent NYE's. With this holiday, I just don't bother. Doomed instinct: 4 pm, home from work, don't feel like going to Whole Foods for delicious food; figure it's almost equal money at WF as in a restaurant; I suggest dinner; we make 8 pm reso here. Scene: 12 degrees outside. Enter restaurant. No host at host stand. Servers milling around. One asks: ""Yes?""  I want to say ""No,"" but I resist my smart ass gene. Upon being seated, I take off my very long winter coat, and hand it to the server-host-not-sure-what-he-is kid. He says, ""we don't have a coat room, really."" ""Really?"" He takes my coat. Amateur Hour begins. NYE in Chicago; it's COLD here on NYE. A coatroom or the like is a nice touch. Menu Perusal: Hmmm, looks interesting. Reasonable Price Fixe. We order: Appetizers: Foie Gras and Escargot. Salads: Spinach salad with beets. Entrees: Lobster stuffed with Scallops, and Veal Chop. Dessert:  will decide later Young Waiter Dude who has the attention span of a flea appears:  ""I forgot to tell you we never got our veal shipment today. We're out of the veal chop."" I order a ""Double Thick Pig Chop"" with garlic/ginger mashed potatoes. Our Appetizers: Foie Gras and Escargot. Delicious. We'd been finished with our appetizers for two minutes. Young Waiter Dude, who now seems to have the attention span of a flea's crack baby, re-appears:  ""Your entrees are done now. Would you like me to wait to serve them and have your salad now?"" I say: ""No, bring the entrees now so they don't sit around. We'll have the salads after the entrees."" I must pee. I excuse myself and go to the ""WC"" area. There is literally NO heat in the back of this restaurant. I choose not to take my stuff out and pee in 12 degree back-of-the-house environs. I return to the table. Entrees arrive:  Lobster stuffed with Scallops is a lobster SHELL which has even the tail excised, and is stuffed with what appears to be a no longer identifiable foodstuff which presumably is scallops mixed with the now minced lobster tail meat. No drawn butter or cocktail fork for extracting lobster meat from the claws. ""Double Thick Pig Chop"" with garlic/ginger mashed potatoes: overcooked and dry as hell. No garlic or ginger discernible in the mashed potatoes. I see Young Waiter Dude, who now seems to have the attention span of a flea's crack baby, but I can't get his attention BECAUSE HE HAS NO ATTENTION.  I get up, because now as is not my desire, I'm getting too annoyed. I summon other Older Waiter Man from the kitchen. ""You know, I hate to complain. Really. But, how do you guys manage on a multi-course meal to cook the entrees so fast there is no time to serve the salads, but you also manage to overcook the chop? Can you please come to our table and look at my chop? Older Waiter Man comes to table, obligingly, and immediately sees this dried up pig specimen on my plate and removes it. ""May I please just have Filet Mignon: RARE?"" ""Of Course."" And I wait. Filet Mignon arrives. It's cooked medium rare to MEDIUM. I summon Older Waiter Man. ""Did you guys pre-cook all this stuff in anticipation of NYE, and now the Chef is just throwing stuff back on to warm it up?"" Older Waiter Man gives me officious and unconvincing denial about how that's absolutely not how they roll. I hand him my overcooked beef. ""Here, just forget it. I'm not eating that. I'll skip my entree."" Older Waiter Man returns to apologize and says they'll comp my meal. He asks that we return to try them another night. We agree, politely. Back to the stuffed lobster shell. It's salty and cafeteria quality blech. No better, honest. Young Waiter Dude, who now seems to have the attention span of a flea's crack baby, re-appears. ""Do you want the salads now?"" ""Sure."" We wait a ridiculously long time for the salads, which I ate without regard or memory for how it tasted. But they skimped all to hell on the red beets. Dessert:  Lemon Tart and Tart Tatin with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Lemon Tart: non-descript taste and the portion was way too large. Tart Tatin: lukewarm apple tart maybe made thoughtlessly with crappy cooking apples, because the apples seemed well on their way to becoming puree.  Blech. Blech. Blech. Pay bill. Tip 15% on the price of one dinner, not two. The hell with them. No one deserved any tip. We walk to the front of the house, where no one could be found to summon my coat. There is a grease ventilation problem; the place is smoke filled. Finally, my coat. Good Riddance. PS: None of the flatware matched.",-0.983,0.825,0.076,0.1,0.49693876139081605

Now on to the main part, the food was actually pretty good.  Even though my Blackened Scallops dinner was a little over salted, I tasted many other dishes and the Sea Bass, Beef Tenderloin, Pork Tenderloin, and Duck Breast (a special that night) were excellent.  Also, the Escargot and Duck Pate appetizers were very pleasant.  Yes, the waiters were a little on the slow side, but honestly, they did seem a bit understaffed (2 servers, probably 40 people eating dinner).   The only other negative, is compared to most other city french bistros, the menu was a bit limited.  They didn't have my favorite warm beet salad, or the typical escarole salad.   Final verdict; if you have a taste for french, and would like BYOB, this is a great option!",0.991,0.698,0.23,0.072,0.6139795918367347

It wasn't stellar, but good enough. We popped open our bottle of wine (BYOB) and chowed down on the escargot. It was pretty delicious.  She got the steak and I got the scallops and both were to die for. My scallops were perfectly cooked and served in a rich buttery sauce of love. Near the end of our meal, the chef came out to ask how our food was. I like it when chefs do this normally, however, this guy was wearing a grease splattered t-shirt and looked like a ragamuffin.

I have to say that I am shocked that nobody has written about this great little French Bistro. The perfect place for a romantic dinner. It is very French from the food to the service. The food was very flavorful but I would expect no less from  Brian Moulton, the longtime chef at Cafe Bernard now owner of Cotes De Rhone; named after a bottle of wine which he says is because ""They're delicious, bold, full-flavored and, in many cases, affordable. That's what I'm trying to do here."" Which I believe he has done so very well. I will some of the best mussels I have ever had they were perfect. They really know how to cook a fish. It's not a big menu but it doesn't have to be. The decor and atmosphere gives you feeling like your in a French underground jazz bistro. It's very very dark in there but the candle light is sufficient enough. The live Jazz band is very loud but just adds to the experience plus I love jazz so it can never be loud enough. The Staff is rude and they ignore you and never make eye contact with you, but at the same time when they do come around they are very nice and inviting..weirdest thing. We ended up order something that had an ingredient in it that we were allergic to and they were so fast on getting another dish out it was unbelievable.

My friend got the lamb chops, and it was not good. Again, she asked for it medium rare, and it came out well done. She had to send it back. The second time, it came out blue.

You would drive right by and never notice, the small storefront on Broadway.  But step inside and instantly you're transported to a cozy little romantic getaway.  The lights are very dim, but twinkle lights and candles create a very romantic and sexy glow.  The room felt warm and snuggly against how chilly it was outside.  Jazz music softly playing in the background and the air smelled fragrant and savory. We ate early (6pm) since that was the only reservation we could get on Valentines Day with almost no notice.  So the restaurant was pretty empty when we first got there.  Service was cheerful and accommodating, and not the least bit pretentious. Our server quickly set to opening our wine (it's BYOB and who doesn't love that?).  She recommended some menu items and we decided to try the mussels in a white wine and shallot sauce.  She said it's a must try and very different from other places, since they don't use garlic - instead they use shallots.  We both love garlic and we love shallots - however neither of us have had it with shallots alone, so we were curious.  FANTASTIC.  Soooo fantastic.  The mussels were cooked to total perfection.  They were plump and moist and tender as can be.  The kitchen has it down solid.  The sauce was so good that we had to force ourselves not to dip a whole loaf of bread into it (essentially making it our meal).  The bread was also fantastic.  It was warm from the oven, crisp and firm on the outside and soft and chewy inside.  We were told they make it there, so we were impressed. I had the rack of lamb and my fianc' had the sea bass.  We were told the rack of lamb was a house favorite; fall off the bone tender and delicious.  While it was well seasoned and nice and rare - it was not exactly tender. It was actually sort of tough, but it tasted so good I just didn't care.  It came with lots of veggies (which I love) carrots, asparagus, eggplant, zucchini all roasted and served with mashed potatoes.  The only drawback on the sides was that they were heavily seasoned with pepper.  Some bites, it was all I could taste.  But overall as a dish it was great. The sea bass was thick and plump and moist.  It was very tender and well seasoned.  Probably one of the best cuts of cooked fish I've had in a while.  Although the sides looked like they were the same as mine, and tasted about the same as well.   I was entirely too full to consider desert, but we WILL be back.  There were several other items we wanted to try, so it's good to know this little gem will be waiting for us so close to home.",0.9992,0.744,0.231,0.025,0.5208881330309902
2008-01-14,3.0,"I had been on a huge French food craving after recently reading a book about Escoffier, so when a friend invited us to dinner at Cotes du Rhone, it seemed to be divine providence (or the fact I had been talking about French cooking for two weeks). Unfortunately, I was kind of disappointed by the meal here. The overall experience at Cotes du Rhone was that of compromises.  The restaurant is too small for the number of tables that they want, so they compromise by making you stand awkwardly close to people eating while you're waiting.  They try for classy ambiance, but end up using cheap, bendable, cafeteria-class silverware.  They want to serve Bistro food, but have to cater to the tastes of Edgewater and end up with a pretty standard Americanized French menu. These were frustrating developments, because it really had a lot of potential.  BYOB French?  Great!  And that was really nice - when we could track down a bottle opener after about 10 minutes at the table. The staff was friendly, but overworked.  And the food was pretty good - notably good was the Duck Pate - but not necessarily mind blowing.  With entrees in the mid $20s, I was hoping for a little more both in terms of flavor and presentation. So what do you have with Cotes du Rhone?  A BYOB spot that gets you better food than the average BYOB restaurant, but with correspondingly higher prices.  As far as French food is concerned, it's middle of the road.  I think that I would rather goto the excellent Bistro Campagne or Brasserie Jo instead, though.  The overall dining experience at both of these - and I think that they're fair comparisons in terms of menu and price - is much more comfortable.  I think that if Cotes du Rhone had a little more space, a little more polish to the environment, and a little more ""French"" on their menu (Not even a boeuf bourguignon on it!), then they could be excellent, especially if they keep up the BYOB.  As it stands, though, there are much better alternatives.",0.9963,0.789,0.186,0.025,0.5438997821350762

I felt pressured to tell him that everything was perfect just so he'd give us some space!  I feel bad for saying that, because he was nice and doing his best, but it's the truth. Regardless, I'd go back here for the lamb alone.  Baaaaahh.... mmmm.",0.9517,0.767,0.16,0.073,0.65

2007-09-22,3.0,"In the neighborhood and still BYOB so that's a plus.  We had the mussels, sea bass, beef tenderloin, and creme brulee.  Everything was really good.  Mussels were on the small side, but great favor.  I loved eatting the bread with the sauce too.  Entrees were great and I would definitely recommend them.  Entrees were in the mid $20 range which I don't consider cheap.  So it's a nice place for special occassions.  The mashed potatoes were really awesome.  Strange that all entrees seemed to come out with the same sides, just different protein.  So we couldn't figure out why it took so long.  The boccolini were AWFUL!  Way over done and unedible.  Good thing everything else on the plate was really good.  Creme brulee was good, not amazing.  Came out a little chilled which was fine.  Total bill was around $75, although dessert was not included on the bill.  Not cheap, so I expected more.  It is what it is.  This place certainly has some kinks to work out still.   The service was on the slow side, but we figured it would be based on the other reviews.  So we brought some great wine and enjoyed talking with one another.  The food did take awhile to come out, probably because the chef kept coming out to talk to the table next to us (friends of his we we think).  Probably not the best idea on a friday night.  We never saw him talk to any of the other tables. I thought the decor was ""interesting.""  I do agree with others that it was kind of strange and ""cheap"" looking.  They have this odd gray laminate (I think) floor tile on the walls and a strange faux fireplace.  For the price of the food, I felt like the decor should be nicer.   There's so many restaurants in Chicago so there's no reason why I would go back here for this price and experience.  In this area, I would prefer to go to Broadway Cellars for this price range.  Broadway Cellars doesn't have BYOB, but they do have a great wine selection.  Just depends on what you are in the mood for.",0.9964,0.73,0.202,0.068,0.5288149350649349
2007-09-21,5.0,"Amazing, one of the best dinning experiences I ever had.  A group of six of us picked up some fine spirits and unknowingly headed to the most unpretentious French bistro Chicago has to offer. We were running late for our 8pm reservation and called ahead to let them know and thank god we did because when we got there the place was packed and yet our table was still waiting for us.  Upon entering the restaurant we were hit with a wonderful aroma coming from the kitchen, the energy from the dinning room was fantastic, abuzz with excitement the music was great, the chatter not to loud, the lighting a little dark however the dinning rooms filled with candles more then made up for any lack of visibility with a feeling of romance and sex appeal. Once in an attractive hostess with a very bubbly personality and cute accent lead us to our table were she proceeded to open and pour our wine. Within a couple of minutes of this very busy restaurant our waiter showed up and took his time telling us about the chef and sharing with us in detail all the highlights and specials as if he had all the time in the world. We took his suggestions and ordered the mussels, pate and calamari and each was better then the next. All six of us agreed that the mussels were the best we ever had. After our appetizers my wife and her sister both ordered the house salad and the vinaigrette dressing was amazing. The wife's talked up the salads so much that everybody tried it and agreed that they were if fact amazing. At this time I noticed that our table was having just a wonderful time so I started to take in the rest of the room and immediately noticed that every face in the room had a smile on it, I knew right then that we were coming back. For our entrees we had the trout topped with crabmeat in a sauce that was outstanding. The Cassolet had lots of flavor. Sea Bass a great fish in a terrific sauce the Beef Tenderloin out of this world and I had bouillabaisse for the first time and it is now one of my favorite dishes of all time. When it was time to pay the check we were blown away that it averaged less then $30 per thanks to the BYOB that it sports. The waiter informed us that they now have live Jazz on Sundays and that the owner intends on always being a BYOB, great news! To say the least everything from the food to the service to the ambiance was outstanding and everybody should try it. We have already made reservations for next Sunday for the live Jazz. P.S In response to Micha M's experience at Cotes Du Rhone I have to say if the waiter, the Manager and ""Some women involved with setting up the restaurant"" could not please or ease your experience then your table had bad mojo or you own some restaurant down the street or something, I don't buy it for a second Cotes Du Rhone is amazing.",0.998,0.809,0.17,0.021,0.5579431216931217

2007-07-03,2.0,"Based on the other reviews, I'm clearly going to be the odd-man-out on this one. We went to Cotes du Rhone for a dinner with some friends my husband works with in Chicago.  We were the out-of-towners, so we let them pick the restaurant - which they did based on their excitement that the chef from Cafe Bernard was involved in a place much closer to their home in Rogers Park.  Really, the night started with high hopes. Yes, our food was (mostly) good.  We waited an hour and a half AFTER receiving our appetizers to get our main course.  When we inquired several times about when we could expect our meal, we were repeatedly told 10 minutes.  Ultimately, one of the members of our party had to go back to the kitchen several times to ensure we all received dinner...strangely only 2 plates would come out at a time and then we would wait 8-10 minutes before receiving another dish.  We had an 8:15 reservation and were not served our main course until 10:45.   The culmination of the evening was when the restaurant manager came to our table to tell us that it was OUR fault that the meal was so slow.  Actually, I should say that he YELLED it at us.  When we told him that we would not be recommending this restaurant to any friends, he told us he didn't care if we or any of our friends ever came back.  Maybe he was having a bad night...but really, that's the biggest no-no in hospitality.   After he yelled at us a woman from the other room came in who had some involvement in setting the restaurant up.  She started out apologizing for his behavior but then admonished us that we had not given enough to the situation and that we should not judge the restaurant on the first impression.  I'm sorry, but that's how the restaurant industry works.  You get one chance to impress me.  If you fail, I'll spend my money elsewhere. We walked out of the restaurant a bit confused by the exchange at the end and then took a deep breath and realized that we at least had a wacky story to tell.  The only reason they get 2 stars from me is that I actually enjoyed my food.",0.8242,0.871,0.079,0.05,0.44022222222222224
2007-05-28,4.0,"This place had three stars before I even walked in the door because, at long last, we get a another restaurant in Edgewater that doesn't have neon in the windows and lunchtime specials. Why should Andersonville have all the fun? The bonus was that Cotes du Rhone was actually very good. I had sea bass, Jen had steak. Both left us happy. The ambiance was basic, but nice. There were some negatives. They first sat us at a table so tight I felt like I was getting the Heimlich perpetually. They said they had just reorganized the tables and kindly resat us. At our new table Jen was sitting in front of the thermostat and the place was about 78 degrees which meant they kept asking her to adjust the temperature. But despite a few inconveniences and some uninspiring-sounding specials, the food was solid and we, at long last, have another decent food option in the borders of Edgewater.

2007-05-11,5.0,"Small but not cramped.  Dim but not dark. Servers are friendly, not stiff or overly familiar. And the food. There were three of us. We split two appetizers (the mussels and the pate) and both were good. I couldn't actually pick up on the truffle aspect of the pate but it was still wonderful. We had two specials split between us and it was a good thing. If you don't come in with the heartiest of appetite, entrees can easily serve two. Definitely a place to come back to. The Creme brulee was interesting, slightly less yellow than one usually expects and maybe just a tad bit less smooth...but what am I saying, it was still very good.",0.9862,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.42614035087719293

The entree favorites:  the duck breast, veal shank special, bouillabaisse, and the salmon.  The cassoulet was also delicious, but it arrived fifteen minutes after everything else.  But they were quick to take it off the bill.  They also only charge $5 for the birthday boy/girl's entree.  So dinner was a great deal.   We had birthday cake, so I didn't get to try any of the desserts.  But I will definitely be back to try those and more.",0.9659,0.835,0.154,0.01,0.6785714285714286
