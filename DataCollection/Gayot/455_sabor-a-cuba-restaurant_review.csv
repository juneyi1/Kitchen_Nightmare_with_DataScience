2012-07-06,2.0,"Eating here was like watching ""Y tu mamá tambien"": Lots of hype, but not enough delivery. That was the same with Sabor a Cuba. We did our due diligence and looked it up before walking in. The reviews were good. The time was right and we were in the neighborhood. So we decided to come in. On a Thursday night. We expected a huge crowd since the other restaurants in the area appeared to be busy. We even made reservations. But when we finally got there, were the only ones. We were sat at the table closest to the kitchen (to speed service no doubt). But that didn't help in the least. The service was slow slow slow. I can understand because, well, there's really only one person in the front of the house and seemingly one person in the kitchen. But when you don't' have customers, that makes sense. Reading the reviews, it doesn't. Back to the food. I started with the plantains and then entreed the ropa vieja. They were both very good. The beef was tender and flavorful. The plantains were done well and just like mom makes them. The proportions were right, too: not too much, not too little. It even left us room for dessert (we didn't have any here). The biggest challenge I had was the bill. It was $60 for an entree, a salad and an appetizer for the two of us. No alcohol (nor did we bring any because we didn't know it was BYO). That just seems like WAY too much for the food we got. I have a feeling that it's the prices and the service that bring this place down. I don't know what the rents are in the neighborhood, but out of business shouldn't be an option for this place. The food is really good.

Hubby had the Lechon Asado - marinated pork with sautéed onions, which he also found unremarkable.  He did enjoy the yuca frita appetizer with the garlic dipping sauce and though the black bean soup was well above average.   He is willing to give them another chance.  Chalk his disappointment up to poor ordering.   I'd be willing to try again, too.  They weren't bad, they just weren't great.  But with so many other restaurants to try in the city, I doubt this second chance will happen anytime soon.",0.9879,0.74,0.18,0.079,0.5281655844155844

The owner finally came out to apologize only after we had asked our waiter what was taking so long with the order. We were offered a free dessert.  After a year we decided to give Sabor A Cuba one more try (it is hard to avoid when you live across the street after all).

We thought we'd at least be served quickly and courteously because they clearly weren't busy--wrong.  The appetizer plate was good. It's fried food and when you fry anything, chances are it'll probably be good. Half way through our appetizers, finally our canned sodas arrived.  My cuban sandwich was drier than the Sahara dessert and didn't seem fresh. My husband though the same thing about his. The rice and beans he added to the sandwich (on the side) were just ""alright."" The beans were so-so and rather flavorless and the rice was mediocre, at best.  One of our dinner guests ordered the fried steak and he thought it was too heavily breaded and not that well seasoned. The other ordered a pork and onions dish with some plantains on the side. Sadly, she couldn't finish her food. The pork was dry and tasteless. The plantains were thin and looked old.  The other point of irritation was that the waitress let the dirty dishes, including those from our appetizers, sit on our table all throughout dinner and didn't bother to clear them. She took her precious time to clear our dinner plates and even left one on the table the entire time we were there.

2011-02-21,1.0,"This past Saturday night, we decided to try Sabor A Cuba for dinner. We had never been there before, and both of us had very little experience with Cuban food - though both of us have quite adventurous palates that include everything from Turkish and Ethiopian, to Indian, Vietnamese and Spanish Tapas. Sabor is on a quiet street and has maybe 20 tables or so. The atmosphere, while not hugely memorable, is pleasant. The menu is fairly extensive - not huge like a Cheesecake factory, but with enough choices to please any palate. It is also small enough for the kitchen to reasonably be able to pull off good execution and not have every menu item tasting same as the item below it. We were seated immediately and I was happy to see an 8 top table of women celebrating a friend's birthday. People don't generally have birthday parties at places they don't like. After about 5 minutes, a basket of bread came - it was French-like, but perhaps it was the famous Cuban bread? I don't have enough experience to be able to say for sure. The bread was sliced and each piece was pre-buttered - not a problem, but something I have never seen before. Stale bread I have seen before and immediately recognized this bread as having sat around for a while, in its pre-buttered state. No problem, it was edible but forgettable. Mildly disappointing because I have always heard so much about how awesome Cuban bread is. A few minutes after the bread arrived (almost 10 minutes total); the waiter came over and asked if we were ready to order. We started with appetizers - croquettes, empanadas and some sort of meat filled, deep fried potato ball. The waiter began to leave and I asked if it was possible to order drinks. ""Drinks!? What do you mean?"" he said in a genuinely confused tone ""Do you mean like...wine or something? We're BYOB!"" He pointed vaguely out the window and said ""Stores across the street!"" and turned to leave, until my girlfriend said ""How about a soft drink or something...?"" The waiter quelled his rising annoyance and reluctantly took our order for two diet cokes. My girlfriend then proceeded to order a fried chicken dish, though she may as well have been ordering lobster at McDonalds. ""Oh wow!"" the waiter said ""That's going to take a REEEEAAAALLLLLYYYYY long time! Like a REALLY long time!!!"" The menu did say to allow 30 minutes for this dish, which seemed fine, so she questioned him further ""Will it take more than 30 minutes?"" ""Oh yeah....it is going to take a REALLY long time....I can't even tell you how long it will take...it's frozen you see?"" We were both taken aback by the waiters dramatic reaction...not only would it take infinitely longer than 30 minutes to deep fry chicken, but it was also frozen? We didn't ask if it was frozen - why would a restaurant voluntarily advertise that their chicken was frozen??? The waiter recommended another chicken dish - apparently not frozen - because this one could be prepared and delivered instantaneously...My girlfriend, clearly at a loss for words requested more time to consider her options. It was very clear that even if she had told the waiter she was prepared to wait till doomsday, the fried chicken would take longer. So, even before we had placed our full order, I was made to feel like an asshole for not knowing it was a BYOB place and my girlfriend almost got thrown out of the restaurant for having the audacity to order chicken.  The appetizers came and looked quite good. The chicken empanadas were crisp, light and non-greasy. The filling was subtle. The croquettes were quite interesting...they were filled with cheese - but a cheese I have never had before. They were good, with a texture akin to Indian paneer and a flavor to match. The deep fried potato ball looked amazing....while I am sure it was well prepared, the meat stuffed mashed potato ball was a texture challenge that neither of us did well with. When we were done with the appetizers, the soft drinks arrived....this was approx 30 minutes after we arrived and 20 minutes since I was lambasted for my idiocy of not knowing it was a BYOB establishment. The main courses arrived - a roasted chicken dish for the girlfriend and a pork dish for me. She was happy with the chicken, but I could tell was still annoyed by the waiter's dramatic song and dance denying her the chicken dish she had wanted. I was a little nervous at first because when the food arrived, my hand brushed the ceramic plate and it was ice cold...and ice cold plate is a death sentence to hot food. Fortunately, my meal was still warm...not hot, but warm.  In short - great prices, decent atmosphere, mediocre food at best and a wait staff that treats you like your a total idiot who isn't worth their time.",0.9959,0.807,0.128,0.065,0.6227955082742318
2011-02-13,4.0,"This little gem kicks out some very very tasty Cuban fare.  It's BYOB, and everything on the menu (with the exception of the paella - which I haven't tried) is under $20, and typically closer to $10 than $20. The Ropa Vieja is awesome, as are the Jibaritos and Cubanos, but my favorite is the Rabo Ensendido. What the heck is a Rabo Ensendido? It is Ox Tail. And it falls off the bone in delicious flakes of scrumptiousness.  Oh yeah, the black bean soup: unreal. Soooooo good. On a cold Chicago day, this little dish could suffice to get you through the day.  The only thing holding the place back is its unpredictable service. Usually, only one server works the whole dining room, and this can slow down the meal. Just be wary of this if you have something to do after dinner that starts at a specific time.

2011-01-04,3.0,"We just finished a dinner at Sabor A Cuba on a cold winter's night. We had seen the restaurant before, and motivated by a  restaurant.com  coupon, we figured we could justify a meal out for the evening. Unlike others, we found the service to be good--especially since our waitress was the only waitstaff and the place filled up as we ate. She immediately brought over water and menus and was prompt with the bottle opener for our BYOB beer and garlic bread hot out of the oven. The atmosphere here is down at the heels but cozy. We started out with the Mariquitas, which were piping hot. I appreciated that as lukewarm fried food at restaurants is a pet peeve of mine. I should've known that I wouldn't like the sauce (raw garlic in veg/canola oil doesn't appeal to me), but the plantain chips were nice. We had the shrimp and the red snapper in mojo sauce, both of which came out with black beans and rice (a nice thought, but bland) and fried sweet plantains (good stuff). I thought the sauce on both was really oily and I couldn't taste any of the sour flavors (sour orange and/or lime) that are typical in mojo--also, the shrimp were overcooked. Perhaps the ropa vieja, which Yelpers rave about would've been a wiser choice. We ended the meal with two Cuban coffees and mango sorbet served in a mango shell. This was all excellent, and in some ways, the best part of the meal.  Readers beware: we gave the waitress our  restaurant.com  certificate, but she said they weren't taking them anymore. However, we'd purchased it off the website just that night, so they acquiesced, but it was kind of awkward. I guess I should've asked before we sat down with menus (?). All in all the service was very friendly and the food was fine. But I don't know if I'd come back since I really prefer my own Caribbean cooking...",0.9886,0.874,0.112,0.015,0.5818660968660969

The flavor of spices and garlic is more than you can ask for in there simplicity and the owners are a sweet couple who take pride in there menu.  And for dessert the Cuban espresso is a delight for me. Its a little place on Wolcott and Wilson across from a video store and a wine and cheese shop.  So if you just want a place to kick back and have a plain and pleasant time with the taste of Cuba on your mind I'd go here.

The staff is incredibly nice, I generally just drop by. Maybe I should stop posting on yelp as while I can leave reviews that I think are on point the tastes of at least others in Chicago is just wacked out. I've seen 4-5 star mexican places that are horrible and several italian places rated high that make their sauce out of a can.  Anyway, if you want some good Cuban food, go here. The shots of coffee are good too, if only they had a little truck on the side of the road serving them, would take me back to South Florida times... Mojo sauce is a bizarre name??? Is this a joke?

I had the Boliche, which was so tender I could cut it with a spoon. The black beans were awesome as well, and I really enjoyed the plantains. Other members of my party had the oxtail stew (reported as delicious), the grilled pork chops (OK), the garlic shrimp (which was a REALLY tiny serving), and a meal of the tamale/papa relleno/empanada (good). The atmosphere was fun and lively, but our waitress was pretty odd -- she asked us to share menus because they were running short, and only gave 3 of the 6 of us any water because they were running low on water glasses. I also got the distinct impression that she didn't care one way or the other how we were enjoying our meal.  On a second visit, we had the same odd waitress, and even worse service. We actually had to ask for napkins...twice. We were given a corkscrew, but no wine glasses, which we also had to ask for...twice. She asked to ""borrow"" our menu to look something up and didn't take our order at that time. When we finally did order, she was completely clueless about the menu. The combination plate appetizer (papa relleno, croquettes, and empanada) was OK -- I've had better at several Peruvian places around town. The entrees came within 3 minutes of the appetizers which was really annoying. The steak with grilled onions was GREAT.

Having had many wonderful meals there, I decided to try Sabor a Cuba, which is owned by the same family. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. The Sandwich Cubano, which comes with beans and rice, was very good. But the beans and rice lacked flavor. They definitely needed salt and some more seasoning altogether. I also had a papa rellena (stuffed potato) and almost choked on it. The potato was really dry and mealy (maybe some sort of sauce would help?). I aimed to at least get to the center and taste the minced meat in the middle but found it was flavorless. The tostones (plaintains twice fried) were also dry and were not served with a side of mojo de ajo (garlic sauce) as is typical or at least as they used to do it at Ambassador Cafe. The maduros (sauteed sweet plantains) were incredibly sweet and decadent as they should be. So, not all was bad but I went in with high expectations and they were not met.

2009-05-20,3.0,"Let me preface by saying I would have given 4 stars because the food was great, but I had to knock one for service. Let me also preface by saying for me to knock a whole star for service means it was just that bad (because I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to the service). So here's the story. The first and only time I came here was a couple of weeks ago on a Tuesday night with my book club. We had a group of 11 and had called ahead to make a reservation (meaning the restaurant knew we were coming with a large party). The service started off ok...although the first hour or so we were there, I'd say there were only maybe 2 other tables of diners. THe poor service started when the place filled up. There was only one girl working the room which means she had our big table and probably half a dozen other tables of smaller groups. What seemed to happen is the other tables started getting the attention and our table got ignored.  Here's a few of the things that stood out in the service department: - At least a half dozen people in the group asked our waitress multiple times to refill the water pitchers, I'd say it took a good hour before any of them were refilled. And it was only done after the food was brought out and we pretty much had to shove the pitchers in her face before she refilled them. When you have a table of 11, water goes quick. To sit there for an hour without any is just not right (especially when half the party wasn't drinkin anything but water). - Two people ordered diet cokes. They didn't show up so after about 30-40 minutes we asked about them. The response, oh yeah let me get those. Another 20 minutes later, still no diet cokes. So we asked again, same response, oh yeah let me get those. Twenty more minutes, the food came out, still no drinks. So we asked a 3rd time, same nonchalant response. Finally, a good hour and a half later one diet coke was brought out (we didn't bother trying to get the 2nd, although we were charged for both which tells me she did write them down, just didn't pay attention enough to bring them out). - When the food came, one persons order was wrong and when pointed out to the waitress, she pretty much gave a look that said 'I don't believe I wrote it wrong, I think you don't know what you ordered'. She did say she'd get the right order out quickly, but without an apology or any sort of concern for the one person who was now going to have to watch 10 other people eat while she waited for what she ordered. - One person in our group ordered soup as her entree. When it was brought out, she asked for some bread. She waited until the rest of the food was brought out, no bread came. So she asked again (maybe 15-20 minutes after the original request). No bread came, she finally just started eating the soup. About 20 more minutes later, after she was done eating, in fact after most of us were done eating, the bread came. She actually laughed when it was brought out and said to the waitress, it's a little late but thanks, and the response she got was pretty close too 'I brought you bread, why are you complaining'.  - When we were done eating, we waited a good half an hour for the waitress to come over and offer coffee & desert. Never happened. Why didn't we flag her down you may ask? Well, at that point we'd been there 3 hours and I think we were all at the point of the service being so bad it was comical and we wanted to see if she'd stop on her own.  - Our check was also never brought. We finally had to send someone to the counter to ask for it.  So now that I've ranted, let me also say that with all that happening, I still wouldn't have knocked a star for service if it hadn't been for one thing - the attitude. I understand that people have bad days, or they are the only person working and are overwhelmed, or they are not feeling good, etc etc. I get that and will almost always give a server the benefit of the doubt. But the attitude is what is preventing me from doing that in this situation. Our waitress was just plain rude. The dozen+ times that we asked over and over for things like water, soda, bread and were repeatedly given a look of 'so what, i didn't bring it out yet, big deal' is just uncalled for. Her attitude towards us is best described as indifferent. She didn't care if we weren't getting what we wanted. She didn't care if we were waiting an hour for a simple thing like water. She just did not seem to care one way or the other if we were having a good dining experience and that is just not acceptable. I can honestly say, as was the the consensus in our group, that this was some of the poorest service we've had. But even after all that, we still tipped well simply because the food was top notch and its BYOB and we enjoyed ourselves none-the-less. Would I go back, I think I would. But with a smaller group, because I'm curious to see if the service improves. And the food really was great!",0.9856,0.818,0.105,0.077,0.506240551776266

She was cute, upbeat and really seemed to love what she was doing. We started with the combonation plate and it was awesome. I loved the chicken croquettas with the mango sauce. Our been empanada was awesome and the papa rellena was great. It was so much for under $7. For dinner I had the ropa vieja and ate all of it. The plantains were amazing and even the bread they brought out that was toasted and buttered was superb. My husband had the steak with the onions and he was pleased. I tried it and thought it was just ok, but I think it was cause I was in love with my meal. As we were finishing our dinner Lisa was making a shake of some sort for these two guys that came in. I asked her what it was and she said it was a Mango shake. She then proceded to bring us a sample- WOW!!! I am so ordering it the next time as is my husband. Dinner for both of us was under $45 and considering how much we had, it was amazing! We will be going back- sooner than later.",0.9915,0.795,0.188,0.017,0.6565217391304348

2007-03-09,4.0,"So last night we were looking for something low key yet tasty to eat and something that was NOT a diner by any means, and we just happened to drive past this place on our way home from work and thought, My hubby has never had Cuban food, why not try it out and seem if he likes it.  For around $40 to $50 - I had the Red Snapper and he had a beef dish that had this great sauce that it had been simmered in with lots of flavor. I had Cafe con Leche (Coffee and Milk) and he had Malta to drink, but this place is also BYOB so plan ahead since there is no where close by to grab a bottle of wine.  We also shared the combination plate for an appetizer and although the tasty tidbits were different than what he was used to my husband was pleased, and he is very picky eater when it comes to certain things. No doubt we will go back and try some other menu items. Probably for lunch though since the sandwiches looked really good, and I just can't eat a sandwich for dinner.  I'm not sure I would bring young children to this place since there are candles on the tables and white table clothes along with glassware, but if you have well behaved slightly older children, they might really enjoy it. Also, the area is fairly small so I'm not sure I would bring a large group (over 8), but a small group (under 8) might be able to fit at two tables joined together.",0.9635,0.832,0.115,0.053,0.5029914529914531
2007-02-28,4.0,I'm not really experienced in Cuban food but found it to be pretty good eats. The combo appetizer platter offered three fried Cuban items which were good but filling. My shredded beef and my wife's shrimp entree were very tasty as well.  The service for a small dining room was average at best. I had to get my  servers attention nearly every time we needed her. I only offer it up in case other notice a trend. Overall it was a really nice place. The only thing we'd do differently would be to bring a bottle of wine. It's BYOB and they don't have a corking fee. I'm giving it four stars but for a first time experience I would give it more like three and a half. Very good but not excellent.,0.9868,0.74,0.233,0.026,0.58275
2006-12-15,5.0,"The appetizers at Sabor A Cuba were to die for. I would go back just for the appetizers. We had a papa rellena, an empanada, and two croquetas. All of them were perfect. Like I said, I'd go back just for those. My entree was ox tail in cuban creole sauce--again, awesome. The meat was really tender, falling off the bone, and the creole sauce was very flavorful without being overwhelming.  Flan was nice and thick, like I love it. Overall, the food wasn't too heavy or overwhelming, and yet you still get a lot for your dollar. The prices were great. Two people managed to come out of there having appetizers, two entrees, a dessert, and drinks for $40 after tax and tip. I'd recommend it to anybody.",0.9667,0.777,0.183,0.04,0.5589285714285713
2006-12-02,4.0,"Very.  Very.  Nice. I probably look like some kind of food-whore after giving so many positive reviews, but I tend to get information about a place before setting foot inside.  This one was different. After living literally across the street for almost an entire year, a friend and I finally garnered enough courage to set foot inside.  Why I never went there earlier, I'll never know.  It's a very quiet atmosphere that is reminiscent of a fine Italian eatery, but the fare is unmistakably Cuban.  Sadly after I moved, I misplaced their menu and their website isn't very informative, but I can't stress this enough: go there if you have a chance. The food is admirably presented, delicious, and doesn't overwhelm by sheer size.  It's not often I don't have to leave with a doggy-bag; this place is more about quality than sheer quantity. Final note: get something for dessert, you'll have room and the pastries are something to admire.",0.9879,0.744,0.235,0.021,0.6183539944903581
2006-08-26,5.0,"This place has great Cuban food.  I'd recommend the Cuban sandwich, but they also have a great sandwich that instead of bread has fried plantains to sandwich the meat.  It's on the corner of Wilson and Wolcott.  It's BYOB and I've both dined in and ordered take out from them and enjoyed the hell out of it.   Asi va a la restaurante ya.",0.7906,0.729,0.188,0.083,0.7333333333333334
2005-09-02,4.0,Sabor A Cuba has amazing red beans & rice.  Plus their sweet plantaines are to die for!   I love a restaraunt that is still BYOB and lets you drink bottles of red wine brought from home while serving you some amazing food!,0.9097,0.631,0.294,0.075,0.5083333333333333
