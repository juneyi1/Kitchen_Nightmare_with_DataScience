Although you could get Guerrero-style food elsewhere for less, I give him props for putting out cusine on the map.  For now, I am looking forward to trying Restaurant y Pozoleria San Juan and Lo Mejor de Guerrero. I will give a Yelp once ive tried them.",0.5719,0.93,0.07,0.0,0.2341269841269841
2005-08-25,5.0,"Love, Love, Love this restaurant.  It is absolutely the best authentic Mexican food I have ever had.  It is definitely on the fancier side of dining, but great for a special occasion or go for a great lunch and a margherita.  The other great thing is that they have over 100 different kinds of Tequila, and even if you are not a fan, you will definitely appreciate it...",0.9903,0.546,0.428,0.026,0.5697619047619047
