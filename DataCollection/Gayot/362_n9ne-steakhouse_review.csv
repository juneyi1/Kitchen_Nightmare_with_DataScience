The waiters that didn't bring us steak knives for our steaks until 5-10 mins after serving the steaks. The music was made me feel like I was at some hiphop club. The crab cake that I had, included a piece of shell...for $19 I would expect not. The filet mignon that my wife had was dry. My rib-eye could be described as bland. The lobster mash was good and the mushrooms they serve with the steaks were delicious. I would look elsewhere for a sophisticated downtown steakhouse",0.9578,0.847,0.143,0.01,0.8388888888888889

2013-05-06,3.0,"The hostesses were nice  but seemed shy which is strange for a position that is supposed to greet guests. We were waiting for a friend so we sat at the bar for a drink. I asked the bartender for a Scotch list but he said they didn't have one and suggested a couple - strangely the cheap blended varieties. I just went with the Cadillac Margarita. Our friend joined us so we sat for dinner. Our waiter was super nice and friendly. The decor is unique for a steakhouse - instead of all the wood fixtures etc. They've got the sleek surfaces and purple lights but those lights seemed outdated. The wine list is not huge like most steakhouses, which is fine, but it needs to be updated. We ordered a 2009 Tempranillo and were given a 2010. I caught that and asked the waiter before he opened it. He said that's all they had. No worries. I did find the prices to be very expensive for a restaurant that was 40% full on a Friday night (word is that business has been going down over the past few years). $59 for a bone-in ribeye which you can get at Gibson's for $49; Del Frisco's for $53; Joe's for $50. I got the lamb chops which tasted wonderful but were a bit too fatty. I tried my friend's roasted chicken which I enjoyed. We didn't order desert but looked at the menu, and voila! That's where the Scotch list was.",0.9741,0.785,0.144,0.071,0.6067676767676767
2013-05-01,2.0,"The experience here wasn't particularly bad, wasn't good, just really strange. The only table available was in the later part of the evening, and confusing as the place was practically empty.  After you go inside and ask around for valet service and pre-pay(?), you'll have a couple of confused waiters take your order repeatedly, and seem a little befuddled as to what you're ordering. Maybe they need to put numbers on the menu like chinese food joints. You'll get your drinks, but only after the server offers the other table's drinks to you first. Remember, there were three tables total in the restaurant. The server will also not know what you ordered, playing the role of a drink auctioneer that not only has no clue which of the two drinks go where, but what the drinks are. You will not understand anything your server says to you. Just smile and nod, and hope you end up with something you enjoy. Next you'll order appetizers, and you'll get them, but only after the server offers the other table's appetizers to you first. You're an old pro at this routine by now and will soon know more about the menu than the staff. You'll order mains. You will have to describe what you want repeatedly, because in addition to not knowing what drinks he's carrying, your server will not know what's on the menu. You'll also feel bad for the woman at the host stand whose boredom and lack of a stool has sent her into catwalk strut fits between the door and the mirror where she touches up her hair and adjusts herself. Mains will arrive, and will be set down in the wrong places and generally auctioned off, Applebee's-style. The food is quite good. Steaks cooked perfectly, burgers with tons of flavor, sides (mashed, garlic and lobster) plenty to share and enjoy. Desserts are a letdown. You can taste that they've been pre-staged and have sat in the cooler for a bit. The cotton candy is great, but the smores are poorly executed. You'll eventually notice staff going home. One by one, the bartender leaves, the kitchen packs up, the hostess stand goes unattended, and you start to feel like a mafia don at his Italian ""restaurant"" -- it's all yours, only, it's not and it's creepy. Mercifully, the server will stop by with your check. Likely the only thing not misdelivered, as well as some keys. He'll ask what kind of car you have, and hand you your keys accordingly. The valet went home, too.  Checking Yelp, I realized that the place closes at 10PM on a Thursday (really?) and it was 10:08.

I recommend this place if you are looking to get away from your standard, loud steakhouse.   Unfortunately, I did remember this place having a club upstairs which would of been great for a night cap, but as the server mentioned, the upstairs lounge/nightclub Ghost Bar was closed and only used mostly these days for corporate events.",0.9783,0.802,0.154,0.043,0.5621315192743763

The lobster bisque had the perfect amount of lobster in the bottom and the soup was creamy, but not heavy. I love a wedge and this one did not disappoint with the bacon and creamy dressing. YUM! For my entree I had the Scallops and it was out of this world. I thought my portion would be much smaller and it turned out I had a hard time finishing it. The truffle oil with the chunks of lobster were excellent paired with the scallops, which were perfectly cooked. My date had the halibut and loved it.

During every one of my prior visits I took note of the tremendous energy in the restaurant, but not this visit. The place was half empty on a Friday night, while I recall waiting for a table even with a reservation in the past. Outdoor sidewalk and roof top dining is obviously killing their summer business, but our waiter assured us their crowds are as vibrant as ever October through June. Oh well. The cocktails were overpriced and weak, and the wine glasses less than half full, but I quickly got over being disgruntled when the appetizer ""FRITTOMISTO"" was served--Artichokes, Green Beans and Baby Carrots, deep fried in a VERY light tempura batter served with an outstanding Crème Fraiche Aioli dipping sauce. The Lobster Bisque was served with a generous portion of Maine lobster, and cognac, chives and crème fraiche.  The main courses reminded me why I opted to dine there for a family birthday. Surf & Turf - An 8 oz Fillet Mignon with  1/2 a Maine Lobster with perfectly prepared medium-rare steak, and not overcooked lobster, was reasonably priced at $56. However, the Béarnaise and Red Wine Sauces were both far too bitter. I would also pass on the overrated Garlic Steak Fries side dish, but the grilled Asparagus is an absolute must try menu item! Another ""must have"" were the Double Cut Lamb Chops - 3 double chops again served a perfectly prepared medium rare - for $40! Best value on the menu. The most interesting dessert was the Smores prepared in the traditional manner: you roast your own marsh mellows tableside over a sterno, and then prepare your chocolate graham cracker sandwich. Hmmm? Very interesting. The Carrot Cake was moist and an exceedingly generous portion, and the Crème Brulee - WOW was it good! The Chocolate Sorbet was, well, also very interesting, but good.

I love the shrimp appetizer, the garbage salad is terrific, and the gorgonzola-doused hanger steak is always a beautifully decadent lunch. The only downside to this spot is the service, which is just not great.  The servers are polite and reasonably attentive, but they just don't have the polish or the attention to detail that I'd like them to have at a place where I typically go for business lunches.  I want the service to be seamless and instead I find myself in situations such as today, where 1) I had to ask for sweeteners because they didn't bring them with my ice tea and 2) they took away any visible stirring mechanism for my ice tea before the second fill-up, and unable to get the waiter's attention to bring me a spoon, I find myself stirring with my knife.  Not a huge deal, but they should be on top of this stuff.   Otherwise, a top notch destination, and one that I would recommend heartily.",0.9645,0.857,0.126,0.017,0.5898496240601504

I couldn't believe the normal prices on the menu, seemed pretty absurd for good, but not outstanding, food. Had the caesar salad which was good, but nothing too special. I did have a bite of my bf's ravioli which were awesome. My salmon with shitake mushrooms was great. The sauce had some wasabi in it which really added to the flavor. Others in my group liked their steak but weren't incredibly impressed. The waiter had claimed they had the ""best steak in Chicago"" and i don't buy it. I enjoyed the lobster risotto, but wished that it had a stronger flavor. There wasn't a ton of flavor. I did enjoy my chocolate dessert! Our waiter was attentive at the beginning of the meal, but seemed to go missing...even though the restaurant was barely occupied. The timing wasn't great, we ordered another round of drinks and they weren't ready until mid-way through our main course. The drinks are another story. They just weren't good. I'm by no means a drink snob, seriously. But the Ginger-er drink that I ordered really tasted like Fresca. I wish I could have seen how little gin was actually poured in there. Kind of disheartening when you're paying $12 a drink. The atmosphere at N9NE is a little odd. Chicago is not Vegas. The glittery poles in the center of the room didn't really fit, they didn't achieve the flashy feel they were going for with the decor.

The food was overall pretty tasty!  Not amazing, but tasty and perfectly fine.  I would have given the restaurant 3, maybe 4 stars (especially if I could have ordered another cocktail or 4!) but for this server.  The rest of the staff, especially the staff who refilled water, the host staff, etc., was exceptional.   I would go back for drinks only and sit at the bar.  Honestly, I could do without a charge triple the amount I spent pending charge on my credit card.  I would suggest paying with cash if you can manage.  Ugh, seriously - the overcharge leaves such a bad taste in my mouth that I am having a hard time feeling good about my experience here.  Disappointed.",0.9084,0.74,0.149,0.111,0.6039886039886041

As far as the ambiance, it was merely dead. It was a Saturday night, with pleasant temps for end of Jan, but there were only two or three other occupied tables. We asked the manager what had happened to the night life, and he said the economy and the month of January combined has caused slow business. Not only did he say January is the slowest month for them, but he also included the economy, and said the prices aren't justified in this given time.

My hubby and I had 8:00 reservations on a Friday night and were surprised to find that the place was quite empty. The weather was bad earlier in the day so I'm not sure if that possibly deterred people. I'm curious to see what they're normal Friday night crowd looks like.   The decor is clearly Vegas inspired with neon lights and shiny mirrors with clean modern lines.  They played a very wide range of music from ACDC to Justin Timberlake to Arcade Fire. I found this dining music a bit strange but it somehow fit the atmosphere.  Now on to the food...there is a Four Square check-in special for a free chef prepared amuse and glass of prosecco. The waiter seemed very pleased to bring each of us this free special, even though the check-in coupon was only for one.  We started with the rock shrimp appetizer which I ordered based solely off previous Yelp reviews. The dish tasted good but was nothing to rave about. The presentation (served in a Chinese to go box and chopsticks) was fun and the dipping sauces were quite tasty. For entrees, I ordered the 8oz filet and my hubby ordered the 24oz bone-in ribeye with a side of duck fat frites. My steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the bernaise sauce was delicious. My hubby got his ribeye topped with bleu cheese and it made the perfect accompaniment to this smokey flavored meat. The duck fat frites and truffle aioli were very good but then again anything fried in duck fat is good :) They have a fantastic cocktail menu too! I had a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and the mangorita. Both were spectacular. My hubby tried the Gin-Ger which was made with gin, cucumber, mint, and ginger beer.

Good mix of seafood, steaks, salads, but the decision seemed simple enough: Slider Duo (beef tenderloin and lobster) served with ""Skinny Fries"" my dining companion had the scallops with risotto.  Slider Duo: Just meh. Wouldn't give it a second try. The beef was cooked to my liking (MR) however, the odd grey coloration it took on from the open flame, possible charcoal grill, was not pleasant and whatever they did use to cook it left a gritty texture on the outside of the steak which could be tasted with each bite..I left the tiny half left and started on the lobster. This seemed to be cooked in tandem with the steak, same grit and bit of rubbery (overcooked) texture to the lobster, but at least it had a nice slaw to cover up some of the grit so I moved onto the ""skinny fries"" which might be better marketed as shoestring potato chips, to which they resemble. Scallops and Risotto: This was the clear winner. Three plump scallops arriving on a long, thin, unassuming bed of risotto with bits of lobster scattered about the truffle oil accompaniment, also topped with creamy corn kernels and peas (didn't know restaurants outside 1950 served em, but they were harmless enough and easily brushed to the side)  As a bonus we splurged for the pecan shortbread dessert, perfect caramel sauce and well churned vanilla ice-cream, helped save the meal that was otherwise lost on the sliders.

It was quite loud.   Nice looking bar in center of room went unused all night.  Looked kind of silly as they used a side bar that was somewhat hidden from view.  Had read in reviews about the ""ghost bar"" so we thought perhaps they leave it unused for that reason(some kind of odd marketing concept-no one at the ghost bar).  But when asked why the bar in the middle of room, in plain sight of all that walk in, was unused we were told they only use it if busy.  It was a Saturday night! Lobster mashed potatoes that everyone raved about were runny and could've been eaten by someone on a feeding tube.  My halibut was just OK and my husband, while eating his bone in rib eye, said he could've made one like this at home! On top of it our server seemed very rushed and kept asking us if we were ready to order.  Barely had a bite and was asking how everything tasted.  Clearing plates faster than we could believe.  For the price I think we could've sat there all night.

I had the rock shrimp, the avocado and mango salad, the 8 oz filet mignon, and the creme brulee. We came for a late dinner, around 9 pm, and the restaurant was about half full. Our servers were all very good, everything came out on time. I was not really loving the ambiance of a restaurant. I guess when I eat a steak, I prefer some place like Gibson's that feels older, more wood and leather, if you know what I mean. Anyways, the rock shrimp were satisfying, but really they were just fried shrimp. They did taste very fresh though and I did enjoy the dipping sauces. The avocado and mango was okay...nothing too exciting...it really was just mango and avocado on a plate with a little jalapeno and red onion. My husband got the caesar and it was deliciou, although it was swimming in dressing so I'd be hesitant to order it, but still tasty. I was also slightly disappointed because I was hoping that the Caesar would have a tableside preparation. The steak was cooked just right and the bernaise was a great accompaniment. I also appreciated that the asparagus was cooked perfectly and that the stalks had been peeled with a veggie peeler...nice touch. The creme brulee was pretty good, although not as thick as I like. The consistency was a bit softer and not as rich. The duck fat fries with truffle cream were very tasty. We took those home with us and heated them up to eat later. Yum. Overall everything was great and I am glad we had our coupons.

The place was marvelous, I figured it would be business casual, but I saw a lot of men in jeans and women in short tops and shorts. Our waitress was kind and very helpful which was a plus. Gilt City offers two menus to choose from. We split the A and B menu to try everything. The Lobster Bisque was delicious, but the shrimp on menu A was a lot better. Filet Mignon was also delicious, I'm not a big fan of fish so, I didn't find the whitefish on menu B too appetizing. We also had avocado and mango which make an amazing combination, last but not least dessert. Creme brûlée or a Godiva chocolate cake. The chocolate was far too rich for my taste but delicious nevertheless. They offer wine or beer pairing for $20 not really worth it. In that case, order a cocktail for $12 and sip on it throughout the meal. I forgot to mention the first course which didn't seem like much of a meal to me. Champagne, topped with a cucumber slice and what seemed to be sour cream. It was a refreshing drink. I was dying to have drinks at ghostbar but unfortunately it was closed for a private party.

I definitely recommend dressing up for this place, but it is soo worth it.  We originally were going to Avec and were dressed casually for that, Nine was a bit dressier and an unplanned part of the evening.  Despite our level of apparel, our host Judy didn't care and was honestly one of the nicest and friendliest hosts I have ever had.  Light humor, great explanation of the menu, and a big plus -- she was not pushy at all, actually waited for us to put down our menus to ask if we were ready. The food was amazing as well.  I ordered the lobster scallops, my friend ordered the Kobe burger, and we split a starter of calamari.  I have never been a huge lobster fan, but this was pan-seared lobster.  I gave it a try and was blown away.  For the burger, my friend said she loved it.  The best part for me, was the calamari.  The squid parts were the norm, but it was served with peppers and lemons, all of which was fried as well.  Fried lemons, sounds disgusting, but it is genius!  The salt, bitterness, sweetness and texture come together wonderfully.

We did have a reservation, and we did have to wait about 15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  The interior of the restaurant is like something out of a movie.  There is a floor to ceiling water wall behind the hostess stand, the bar area has the most amazing set up of liquor bottles, and then the actual seating area drops down in the middle of the place.   There is smoking at the bar area only. When it comes to the food, I've never heard of anything other than fried calamari.  This place doesn't even have that on their menu, it's strictly grilled, so I had to try it.  I also had to order their famous steak, DUH!  The chef actually comes out to each party's table and goes over the food menu and then asks how everything was.  Amazing touch, no place has ever treated me like a celebrity before...maybe because N9NE is known to have celebrities frequent there on the regular.  I was secretly hoping 1 (or 2) may have been spotted that night, but unfortunately no. Like nearly every restaurant excursion, there is a necessary restroom break needed...I nearly died when I walked in the womens' room.  There are floor to ceiling stalls - no wondering who can see your feet in the next stall, dark mahogany/cherry wood and marble counter tops.  There's even your own flat screen tv in each and every stall!  My date explained that there is a huge flat screen above the mens' urinal, which was more like a troth...but the cleanest troth he's ever seen in a public bathroom. After dinner, we went upstair to the 'club/lounge' area.  It was still pretty early in the evening, so there were only a couple handfuls of people there. But the music was good, not too loud.

Food: Started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare - it was good and obviously high quality raw tuna, but a little bland. The tuna's edamame/avocado bed should have added more flavor, but it didn't.  Then I had the cheese ravioli which was drenched in butter - tasty, but VERY filling.  I could practically feel my blood start to congeal in my veins with lard.  I ordered the Hanger Steak for my main meal - again, very very rich ... the steak was good, but the sauce was very salty and detracted from the quality of the steak.  Lastly, I ordered the apple crisp and had one bite and decided I would die of the fats if I continued.  It was really good, though - probably my favorite course of the night.  Ambiance:  Beautiful restaurant with nice dim lighting and a sexy circular bar in the middle.  But, being Chicago, there are TVs showing sports in every nook, which sort of cheapens the whole ""fine dining"" experience.  It was also extremely loud and hard to hold a conversation across the table.  Oh, and the booth seating is very low compared to the table height, which is annoying when you're not 6 feet tall.   Service:  I feel like our waitress really tried to be a good waitress, but she just wasn't that good at her job.  She forgot to charge us for both our main meals, which we pointed out, and then she overcharged us an espresso.  But, she was very nice.  So ... yeah.",0.9931,0.745,0.19,0.065,0.5949539776462853

The bar:  We sat at the center bar.  The bartender was wonderful.  She helped us choose a wine in our price range, was actually pretty good.   Food:  We did the restaurant week menu.  I had the ice berg wedge, which was just a sald, but oh so good.  Perfectly fresh iceberg, ranch dressing, bacon, tomato and eggs.  Perfect amount of everything.  The b/f had the ravioli for the starter, which was also fabulous.  Then we both had the hanger steak and mashed potatoes.  The steak was delicious.  The mashed potatoes were nothing special, but still very good. Dessert:  I had the apple crisp, which was really good, but I couldn't have more than a bite because I was so full.  The boy had the chocolate browny thingy, which he said was really good as well and very very rich.   Busboys/Server assistants:  Did the most work, took care of our every need.  Our server simply took our order and asked if everything was ok, the busboys should get all the tips.

Reminded me of a place that should be in Vegas with it's glittering mirrored tiled columns and the contemporary glass and steel bar in the center of the dining room.  We first sat at the bar, but the bartender there was so obnoxious that eating there was never going to be an option. This guy spent more time on the phone at the end of the bar than getting us drinks. And when my second drink came with tonic instead of soda? Well let's just say his ""displeasure"" at me returning it was written all over his face.  So it was over to a table we went.  Again a bit of a misstep as the place was empty- we asked for a booth and were being directed to a table when the friend I was with interceded and said """"Booth"", yet again. The hostess, who couldn't make a decision if her life depended on it- left us standing in the middle of the restaurant to go ""see if she could do that"". Really? There were only about 4 tables occupied in the entire place.  Once we were finally seated (in a booth, I might add) things began to look up. Our server, Alex, was quite helpful and turned what could have been horrible night into one that was okay. He suggested his favorites on the menu and was personable and apologetic (I had asked for a black napkin thinking a place of this caliber would have one- but one could not be found!)  We started with a couple of the appetizers- the rock shrimp which was a Chinese take out box full of lightly battered and fried shrimp and the two cones filled with ahi tuna and a lobster mix. All were quite good.  As for entrees- I went with the New York strip with a side of the broccoli au gratin and my friend had the hangar steak. Everything was fine- but the broccoli was not good. Tasted like it came out of a can as it had the consistency of a canned vegetable. The steak was good but charging $3 for Bearnaise sauce felt a little nickel and dimey when you are paying $45 or more for a steak.  Valet parking is available for $11 and know if you go close to the writing of this- with both Randolph and Wacker under construction, the valet drop off is over on Canal Street just north of Randolph although they do bring your car to the front door when you leave.  Pricey for what you get. I know this place used to be the ""see and be seen"" place but it sure wasn't that on this night. And the infamous ""Ghost Bar"" on the 2nd level is now only open for private parties.  A-OK pretty much sums up the evening with the save by our server. But there are plenty of other steak places in town that I prefer. And that's where you'll find me.",0.9879,0.854,0.104,0.041,0.5128658378658378

It's available both lunch and dinner and it's sooooo tasty. The glaze on it is sweet and a nice compliment to the fish. The lobster mashed potatoes are also delicious and a nice side.

It's called put it on the side, or at least let your guests know. Then we go the mac and cheese side which was a okay. I asked the server if they had sangria and he said no, but the bartender was able to make me one, which I thought was very nice, but then when I was charged 15$ bucks for one little glass, I didn't think it was that nice anymore.

It's a beautiful restaurant, and since it wasn't too crowded we were given a large booth to ourselves, which allowed us to sit close.  The service was excellent! Our waiter was knowledgeable and quite attentive.  We started with cocktails --- I'd knock over my grandma to get another one of those key lime martinis. We shared some raw oysters and the best Caesar salad we've ever had. The menu said ""Caesar salad as it should be"", and that was accurate.  My husband had the Dayboat Sea Scallops, which were perfectly cooked, and I ordered the ribeye special; however, when it arrived, I wasn't happy with it. It was overcooked and too fatty. The waiter apologized and very quickly replaced it with a perfect filet mignon, which I much preferred. We shared the cauliflower gratin, which left us wanting to lick the bowl. Sadly, I don't remember the wines and port we shared, but they were perfect with the meal and we enjoyed them immensely. If there's one place N9ne could step up a little, IMHO, it's with the desserts. They're good but not spectacular, and frankly, the offerings are a little odd. I don't really want s'mores after an elegant meal, even gourmet s'mores. I don't really want cookies, or some ultrasweet concoction --- I was a dessert as sophisticated as the rest of the menu, and preferably something light.

They really pushed these sauces for the steaks but I prefer the beef to speak for itself and it just fell flat. My colleagues all reported the same opinion on their steaks. Lame. I think this place would still merit 4 stars, however the coat check lady was completely rude. I gave her a 5 when I checked my coat. When I came to retrieve my coat after dinner she was completely nice again until I discovered I had lost my ticket. She went from nice and attentive to over the top ghetto rude in exactly zero seconds. I was floored by how I was being treated at what is supposedly fine dining. She refused to make eye contact with me or address me after claiming profoundly that I would have to wait until everyone in the place had left.

UGH. whats sad is that the sea bass was not very good either. its supposed to be their signature fish dish and it was actually kind of fishy and bland. very disappointing. the $9 burger on the other hand is very good, especially for the price. it's a huge burger with cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and lettuce and comes with a pickle and garlic fries.   so i may go back on another tuesday night for a burger... and hopefully, we'll have the same server again. otherwise, not going back....",0.9867,0.743,0.164,0.093,0.5814992150706436

2010-09-21,5.0,"What a fantastic time we had during our rehearsal dinner at N9NE. My husband and I wanted somewhere classy for our rehearsal dinner but yet we didn't want to spend an enormous amount on the rehearsal dinner since we were already spending a huge amount of our budget for our wedding the next day. We met Julie, the Director of Special Events for N9NE, at a Foodie Registry event. While we didn't end up having a foodie registry (which seems to be quite the rage now for foodies), we walked away from the event happy as we met Julie only very briefly while she was tending to N9NE's booth setup while telling us that we can just inform her what our budget was and she will work with us from there. A few days later we got in touch with Julie and she has been extremely professional throughout. Julie also gave us the private event room and there wasn't any minimum charges that we had to meet in order for us to use the private room. This was important to us because another nearby restaurant that we looked at required a minimum F&B charge for the use of the private room and my husband and I knew that there was no way we could meet that minimum no matter how much our guests ate and drank just based on the fact that we would only have 23 people at the rehearsal dinner. Julie came up with a 3-course prix fixe menu for us (on the night of the rehearsal dinner, everyone could choose 1 appetizer out of two given choices, 1 entree out of 3 given choices, and 1 dessert out of two given choices). Since this prix fixe menu was designed to fit our budget, she printed individual menus for all our guests on that night. The food and service did not disappoint. Only one thing was that although we confirmed 23 guests prior to the dinner, there were only 22 place settings on the table when we arrived. But within minutes, the staff added one more place setting to the table without a hitch. At the end of the night when my husband and I got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised that it didn't hit the roof :) Bear in mind also that not all of our 23 guests at the rehearsal dinner were heavy drinkers, so that helped a great deal. A couple days after our rehearsal, Julie gave my husband a call just to check-in with us and to see if we have any feedback for them. If you are looking for a classy and professional atmosphere and not necessary a family-run type of restaurant for your rehearsal dinner, definitely consider N9NE.",0.989,0.87,0.105,0.026,0.6084776334776334

I chalked it up to Groupon and everyone trying to use it on the last day even though I made my reservation more than a week in advance.  Arrived no warm welcome. Just a name, follow me. Wow, she was really either not happy with me, groupon or her job.  Server had worked at the N9NE for ten years. first 9 as a food runner and was promoted to a server a year ago- you know how I know this- he told us three times. really, don't care but unfortunately the only good thing I can say about him he was promoted by someone.  Two examples- when he placed the menus down he told us he would need to come back and get our drink order and explain the menu because he had other tables that needed his attention. As a past server i get that but some how you fake it and don't tell the customer that. 2.)I ordered Prosecco for my first drink. when we finally placed our order for our meals I asked him to bring me a glass of pinot noir with my steak. he told me to remind him when my steak came out of the kitchen. ill only give you those two but there are about 5 more. He was just miserable.  Food- App- Ahi Tuna. it was excellent. I wish I would of tried the Beef Carpaccio. there will not be a next time.  Ceasar salad was excellent. the dressing was right on with balance of taste.  I ordered Filet medium rare. came out more medium (but i didn't return it). friend ordered Scallops which were amazing. the risotto was also great. I was a bit surprised the peas and corn in the risotto were not fresh. especially since we are still in summer season and those should be easy to come by.  Lobster Mashed are really good treat.   No dessert.  when we were leaving there was another couple leaving in front of us. two hostesses standing at the door talking and neither the couple in front of us or ourselves were addressed. I was Shocked. How do you train your staff that at the very least when you leave a restaurant and you have two employees standing there doing nothing that they do not say thank you, come again. unacceptable.  But so is the fact that I watched the manager walk around the restaurant probably 5 times in the two hours we were there and never once touch or address a table either.  sorry for long review- but don't go. not worth it and i wish i would of just let my groupon expire and I ate the $25.00. would of been better off..  The food was a 3.5 star and service could be a one star only because our food runner was fantastic.",0.9964,0.784,0.15,0.066,0.6132094124199388

A manager happened to stop by our table and asked how everything was. My husband said we had been waiting for our wine.  A few minutes later, wine was served.  Mgr stopped by to say the wine was on her...nice touch. Dinner was very good, but we felt like our waitress wasn't very good.  She was not very enthusiastic about anything on the menu, not very friendly and overall acted annoyed. After the bill was brought, I told our server that we felt a bit slighted and wondered if it was because we had a groupon. She, of course, was very apologetic and said no she loved the groupon people, blah, blah, blah.  She then said she would be right back and when she returned she had 2 small glasses of sparkling Rose' for us.  Nice touch, but a little too late.  There are way too many restaurants in Chicago that will treat customers like they matter...right from the start.",0.9327,0.738,0.156,0.106,0.5263834883065653

Our reservation was for 7:30PM and we got there around 7:20PM and had to wait the 10minutes before we got seated. I walked in and the decor was not anything amazing, but pretty modern, kind of like a Vegas style feel - very open and dark with candles (I love candles!). The crowd was very mixed - older business men and women in suits, and then there was the casual people with backpacks and sandals. I guess they don't have a strict dress attire.  My boyfriend and I had the BEST seats, seriously we were towards the back but we were facing the middle and we had a comfy booth and not a table. We could see everything going on from our seats. Our waiter was kind of helpful in the beginning, he told us the most popular dish and wine but that's about it. For our appetizer we had the calamari ($12) - it was GREAT, warm and the texture was perfect, not too hard and not too soft. We gobbled up the huge dish of calamari up within 15 minutes. For our main entree I had the 24 oz Bone in Ribeye ($45) and my boyfriend had the black cod miso ($28) along with a side order of lobster mash potatoes ($9) to share between the both us. Our food took about 20 minutes but the wait wasn't terrible (atleast to me). When our food came out, OMYLORD, my steak was HUGE! I had mine done medium rare, and it was just perfect! I had a bite and I thought I went to steak heaven. It's super flavorful and I didn't need to ask for any extra sauces. I took a bite of my boyfriend's black cod miso and I got to say, I am not a huge fan of cooked fish but his fish was actually tasty. His dish came with shiitake mushrooms and they are to die for! I couldn't stop eating them! They were so much better than my shrooms on my steak. And I am saving one of my favorites for last....Lobster mash potatoes!! Every restaurant should have this dish because it is phenomenal.  The mash potatoes has just enough lobster where it's not too much but just right! I am in LOVE with N9NE. I would have given the restaurant a perfect score but sadly, the service was utter crap. Our waiter came by like 3 times during our 1.5 hour dinner and he always seemed like in a rush. Unfortunately, I was so full I did not get to eat dessert. But I did get to take a baggie since I had half my steak and half my lobster mash potatoes leftover. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to a very nice environment with good food.

The shrimp app was nice, steak was solid, wife's halibut was just ok and only luke warm, sides (broccoli au gratin and lobster mashed) were average at best. Service was fine, just slow. For an example, it took them a solid ten+ minutes to clear our plates when busboys and other ancillary people were just standing at the water station one table away. Plus it was early evening, so the restaurant wasn't really even hopping yet. In closing, if you are looking for a good starter in a slick atmosphere N9NE is a good choice.

So when they brought us both, I politely informed the server that we did not order the ravioli. He responded that it was on the house.

This is when the experience took a sharp turn southward.  When I tried to explain the situation to the waitress and later the manager, they basically both implied that I was trying to get out of paying for something I already ate, in terms that barely disguised their rudeness and ill-breeding. They eventually took the item off the bill, but not before I vowed never to return. They basically f'ed up a situation that could have been easily solved with a gracious mea culpa and instead lost two customers and a good tip.

So before you judge, read the review and perhaps you too will be swayed by the non-steak alternatives offered by N9NE. My friend and I like to do a dinner at least once a month where we pretend to be uber cool foodies. And of course, we like to share our dishes. This was no exception. We ordered the black cod and scallops and asked our waiter for extra plates so we could share. The waiter informed us that he could split the entrees and we could do courses. Awesome suggestion! Add some lobster mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach to that order while you're at it.  Black cod: This is something I've never had, but it was worth the wait. The fish was wonderfully cooked - it flaked with the slight tap of your fork into the perfect sized bite. The miso glaze with the dish gave it a little Asian flavor that just enhanced the yumminess. The fish literally melted in your mouth and I devoured the half-portion in 5 minutes. So much for savoring. Scallops: Had the perfect sear and were nestled on a bed of cream lobster risotto. They were thick and plump - not chewy at all. The risotto was amazing as well. And they didn't skimp on the lobster. There were visible chunks smiling up at me begging to be eaten. The sauteed spinach was ok - much better after you squeezed the lemon juice over it. Lobster mashed potatoes are a must! So creamy, so lobstery, so delicious.  We also treated ourselves to two desserts: Smores and Brownie Bread Pudding. I love the Smores - something fun about getting to toast your own marshmallow and the press it down on a chocolate smothered graham cracker. The brownie bread pudding was really just a brownie with some ice cream and felt like something you could get at Applebees. Skip out on that, but go for the Smores.

First up, was long time favorite N9NE, first visited and reviewed in 2006.  The world has changed since then, N9NE is part of the Vegas set, iPads exist and I now frequent Brazilian Steakhouses like most people go to McDonald's.   As super helpful server James mentioned, N9NE is trying out the grassfed option (Tallgrass Beef from Kansas, also seen at the Olgivie French Market and Prairie Fire both nearby).  For their test, they did a carpaccio, Asian themed, with fried mushrooms on top.  Laced with the better gamier grass fed notes, fused with Asian flavors and finished with a satisfying crunchy fried mushroom.   Of course, the hangar steak was fantastic and a generous portion that was much appreciated.

The service was great at all times however N9ne makes too many basic errors for it to hit the big leagues in Chicago. I live about 2 blocks away from N9ne and am the first to acknowledge that it has a strange basement location in an area off the beaten track. The restaurant looks very smart except for this erie bar in the middle of the floor that no bartender was working in and looked as if it had been forgotten about.  Our server while being very nice described the menu to us. If a server needs to explain a menu for 5 minutes, it either is a menu that lacks clarity or the server likes to hear himself talk. We ordered some of his recommendations expecting great things but nothing ever went past the average mark. The bread is very basic for a steakhouse and it is clearly bought in that morning and not made in house. David Burkes bread is much better and just out of the oven. The truffled potato gnocchi was nice but I found the sauce to be a bit bland. I tried the sweet prawn risotto that the Mrs was eating and we agreed to swap. The risotto was very tasty and packed a lot of flavour (strangely the mrs thought her risotto was bland and that my gnocchi was great). A nice start but you don't go to a steakhouse for anything except their steak. Our steaks came out and they looked impressive. I ordered the 16oz New York Sirloin and it was a big piece of meat. Unfortunately, the quality of the meat was nothing exceptional (you can buy better in Whole Foods) so it was a nice steak but only that. I tried there 4 sauce sampler as I love seeing how great chefs prepare a variety of sauces. The only sauce that was really nice was the Barolo reduction, the green peppercorn sauce was really poor and I know I could make better.  The mrs had the surf and turf and her steak was overcooked. She asked for it medium rare and got it medium well. Not a big deal but shows how N9ne is off the pace with Gibsons, Hugos, Capital Grille etc. She ate the steak but the lobster seemed a little dry. Dessert was interesting as they have a dessert of Cotton Candy and ice cream which was the highlight of the evening.

When the check arrived, I looked it over just to make sure everything was correct.  A $14 charge caught my eye, since I didn't remember ordering anything that was that price.  It turns out, that $14 was for 2 bottles of Fiji water, priced at $7 a piece!  That's almost as much as my fancy cocktail was.  Not only is that an OUTRAGEOUS price for water in my book, but we had never asked for bottled water!  The busboy had asked us if we wanted water when we were seated, so of course we said yes, logically thinking that they bring (free) water to every table, like every other restaurant in the country.  No mention was ever made about having to pay for said water.  Now, in Europe, most restaurants will do this to you.  You have to ask explicitly for tap water if that's what you want.  But never ever in the US have I been given expensive bottled water instead of tap water without at least being told beforehand that I would be charged for it.  We were so angry about this that it came close to ruining the whole experience at the restaurant.  Oh, and we spent the last 5 minutes chugging the remainder of that $7 water once we realized the price.   So maybe I'm just crazy, and this is a common practice in fancy restaurants, but I've been to much nicer places and had copious amounts of free water without even asking for it.  OK, water rant over.",0.8767,0.788,0.119,0.092,0.5517489711934156

My husband is a very picky/particular eater and they never have issues with his odd requests.  The food is always delivered promptly to our table and again...is always delicious. My favorite thing on the menu is the Cloud N9NE.......little puffs of heaven...I mean cotton candy with miniature icecream cones throughout!!!  Yummers!!!!

Didn't really care for the tuna tartare - personally I have had tartare with more flavor but that's just me - my sister and mom liked it just fine.

2010-05-23,3.0,"So I've ventured into some decent restaurants in Chicago as of late and have taken a liking to their offerings.   I came to N9NE Steakhouse with our Fraternity, Phi Kappa Sigma at Illinois Institute of Technology for our Formal.  The entryway is beautiful, very nu-tech decor with lots of stainless steel.  The bar looks wonderful, spectacular visually. Now lets move on to the nitty gritty.  The waiters uniforms? Awful.  They look like butchers.  Yeah its a steakhouse but you need to dress your staff with some class.  Poor uniforms.  Yuck. As for the food, okay.  Our appetizers were not my cup of tea, we had their mushroom purses, too biscuity, dry, flavor was alright.  The thai spring rolls were decent, edible, but if you screw up thai spring rolls you have bigger problems. The caesar salad was good, subtle flavors with a burnt crouton.  Not the restaurants finest creation, but respectable.   Our main course was a Hangar steak.  First one I've ever had.  Did some research, its a rare cut, usually one section per cow.  As for flavor, perfect, just the right amount of salt for my palate.  One half of the steak is a tender cut, reminds me of a new york strip in size and texture.  The other half is a fat striped, tougher, but flavorful piece.  The fat helps keep the moisture and flavor in, I can definitely respect this quality.  However my dinner guests do not like different textures or foods that are harder to cut into small pieces.  It seems to be the average American complaint.  I felt this piece of steak was magnificent, the end pieces were heaven, good seasoning to steak ratio.  I can appreciate the two varied textures.  Five stars for the main course. Dessert was forgettable.  Some chocolate cake with a sorbet on top.  Too sweet. too boring. Overall, good steak place, if thats all you order.  The bells and whistles weren't there.

2010-02-28,4.0,"Came here twice during a recent visit to Chicago, once for a dinner in the main restaurant and once for a dinner in one of the back dining rooms for 30+ people.  While both were completely different experiences, I have to say both also left me a fan of the restaurant and the kitchen's skill.  Was it the best food I've ever eaten?  Nah...but it was good. First dinner:  Wednesday night meetup, a table for 6 at 8 PM.  Good wine, great oysters, serviceable calamari and rock shrimp (best part of the calamari was the fried peppers).  Ordered the miso black cod, which I'd had on a previous visit, and it was melt-in-your-mouth, out of this world delicious.  Also enjoyed the duck fat fries.  REALLY enjoyed the duck fat fries, in fact.  Our server was fantastic, to the point where my co-worker actually tried to request him for the party we were having there on Friday night.  If Bruno is your server, you will have a great meal and a great time, for sure.   Second meal of the week, the private party:  service was good, if a little more reserved (which was good for the tone of the group).  Wine was decent, menu, although limited, was acceptable.  Started with the ceviche, which was delicate, and served in a halved coconut, and then had the filet.  Here's where they impressed me:  I am really picky about my steak, and like it perfectly rare.  With a party of 30, I had low expectations...it came out perfectly.  Couldn't believe it.  Potatoes and veggies served family style on the side were just OK. Dessert choices included a banana cake and a chocolate gelato, mousse, cake combo - our server was nice enough to bring me one of each (while both were good, actually the best way to eat them was to take some of the mousse and eat it with the banana shortbread.  That was perfect.) All in all, a decent all around choice whether you want steak or seafood, in a loungey/W-hotel type atmosphere.  Not overly luxe, but something different.",0.9907,0.831,0.161,0.008,0.5319715007215009

Unfortunately, that was about the best part of our experience.  My wife, friend, and I came for Restaurant Week and were treated as inferior and as if the waiter had something better to do.  He was very condescending, snooty, and did not want to give us the time of day. This was especially surprising since it was a Monday night and fairly empty.  His condescending approach was very evident when my wife ordered water to drink, because she is pregnant. Nobody should be treated rudely because they are not drinking.  He gave us the Restaurant Week menu while we were looking over the main menu but failed to go over any of the details on either of the menus.  He also made sly comments about things being less expensive or more in our price range; this is completely unacceptable and it took everything in me not to leave at that point; and based on the rest of my experience I should have.  The ladies ordered the salmon and the filet both off the Restaurant Week menu and I ordered the 24oz bone in ribeye crusted in blue cheese.  He failed to mention that the filet was covered in an unknown sauce, which my wife immediately had to take off.  The salad and the lobster bisque came but we were still waiting for the bottle of white wine we ordered.  Eventually, that did come out, but I saw him parading it around the restaurant. He was going from table to table with our wine; all the while it was getting warm.  The main courses came out and the ladies meals looked great but my medium rare steak was well done.  Deplorably, I had to wait a good 5 minutes before the waiter came back to check on us, at which time I sent the over cooked ribeye back.  He did make a nice jester and offered me lobster bisque while my steak was being prepared.  When my next steak came out it was cooked rare and extremely fatty, at this point I ate it because I was tired of waiting for my food and dealing with the waiter.  The waiter did pick up his service after this but it was only due to the bill that was immediately following.  The whole experience at N9NE was disheartening and offensive.   I find it very hard to want to go back especially when Ruth's Chris, Mortons, Sullivans, Gibsons, and David Burke's are close by.  Regrettably N9NE was not the restaurant I was expecting it to be.",-0.9119,0.848,0.063,0.089,0.493313953488372

Maybe it was because it was Valentines Day dinner and that brought everyone out, but honestly I continually lost my appetite again and again because of the bumbling idiot sitting next to us.  The tables in the private dining room are literally about a foot and a half apart, not at all intimate and not at all romantic. In this private dining room were other couples, which was nice, until we sat down.  Our tiny table was but too small and it wobbled every time we shifted. When different plates were set in front of us, the waiter scrambled to make room.  I had the melon mojito that tasted nothing like melon and more like mint and something bitter with a splash of rum. The food was okay, not amazing -- it was barely even memorable. We opted for the rock shrimp for an appetizer and it was probably the best thing we ate at n9ne.  I had the Day Boat Sea Scallops and I was so excited for it, but when it came out they were over-cooked and the lobster risotto that accompanied it was salty. I ate one of four scallops and didn't even want to take the rest of it home. My boyfriend had the New York Sirloin with barolo sauce, and this was again -- really good but nothing fantastic.

We started with three cheese ravioli with spinach and crispy pancetta -- the ravioli were soft and delicious, and the pancetta added the right saltiness. Second course was a very large Caesar salad. It was a little more over-dressed than I like it, but the thick pieces of Parmesan and the crispy croutons evened it out. Main course was a New York Strip, cooked perfectly and seasoned expertly. The beef was buttery and really tender, and as much as I wanted to, I just couldn't finish! We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. Dessert was a chocolate-mousse cake with a coconut bottom crust and a scoop of coffee ice cream. A-maz-ing.

We ended up ordering the Shrooms and Calamari. The shrooms were stuffed with Alaskan crab and cheese or something. The crab had lots of shell and cartilage pieces in it. I was pulling hard pieces out my mouth the whole time I was eating it.  My drink was the Charlotte Fizz, which was good but this one bartender with an unwarranted attitude with us made my second one and it wasn't even the same color right along with tasting like crap.

I was so full at that point that I almost decided not to get dessert, but I'm glad I did.  I generally enjoy bread pudding, so the blueberry brioche bread pudding stuck out to me.  Whoa!  They give you a very large portion of bread pudding and despite feeling like I was going to explode, I scraped the plate clean.  The blueberries were perfect.  They had a very intense flavor and amazing texture.  The bread pudding was also the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot of bread pudding in my day), though that was probably due in no small part to the amazing blueberries.  The waiter said that they keep some form of bread pudding on their dessert menu year-round.  The tease!

We ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad, which was loaded with some of the freshest and most delicious mozzarella I have ever tasted! For the main course, we were prepared to order either steak or lobster, but our server really sold us on the black cod miso. Boy did he know how to sell! So we settled on splitting 1/2 black cod miso and 1/2 steak. I am SOOO glad we decided to go with his suggestion of the black cod miso, which was very delicate and full of flavor! It was sliced to just the right pieces and melted in your mouth. To add to our already heavy meal, we also ordered a side of lobster mashed potatoes!

As for the decor, I really like contemporary, so this place is right up my alley, though the lighting should be a bit more focused on tables and not so red-but rather white light , but it didn't make me want to drop a star on the review. First were drinks at the bar, which the bartender was nice, but seemed more interested in talking to the wait staff at the end of the bar to the right, but we did get a simple drink order and pre-lubed a bit before dinner. I used Open Table to make the reservation and I requested a booth, which for the first time in using Open Table the establishment ACTUALLY did what I asked!  Yea!  We were seated in a nice booth overlooking the expansive, albeit sparsely populated restaurant, but it was a Tuesday night mine you. As we slid into the dark upholstery booth there were food crumbs where we were to sit....not good N9NE.....that little lack of detail in not good for the prices you serve...and considering the dark color of the material to miss it means the wait staff never looked.  I should never have to ""sweep"" my seat sitting down in such an establishment for any reason, thus a loss of a star. The waiters were very professional, perfect in presentation, attentive and I DO like the white jackets...I my opinion in the industry it speaks to professionalism....if at the very least illusion of it, which in this town should be enough.  The menu is very comprehensive and has a little bit of everything from an upscale dish perspective. Steaks were to be had, but as a starter we had a mango/avocado dish that I'm going to make tonight I loved it that much!!!  Steaks were 8oz of prime meat and not cheap either...these are more than Capital Grill or Morton's last I checked, but they didn't disappoint.  Wine was great, but no matter how much pressure I put I couldn't convince my lady friend to get dessert?  Oh well.   This is a great date place or place to get a drink and feel sexy.  Service it dead on - less there cleaning up skills, with some things I think need to be seriously addressed to make this a 5 star experience.  But I will definitely patronize this establishment in the future.",0.995,0.78,0.163,0.057,0.4749421296296296

Part of the reason I chose this place was that I had a $25 off certificate (Thank you Colleen) and I always wanted to try anyway. This place is really looks nice and the bright lighting in the center of the restaurant really sets the place off. I beat my mom there, so I decided to have a drink at the bar while I waited. The cheapest beer was $7, so I went with the 312. She walked in and loved the scenery. The waiter (Xavier) quickly made his presence felt and let us know what was good on the menu. We started out with the calamari as an appetizer, which was ok. We both got the lobster bisque soup, which was more than spectacular. For my entree, I got the Hangar Steak which comes with garlic fries. I ordered medium well and it looked medium rare. I didn't put up a fuss because I was slightly full anyway. My mom got the Surf & Turf, which is basically the filet mignon and a lobster. It looked really good and she seemed to enjoy it. For dessert, we got carrot cake. On the menu, under carrot cake, it is described as ""The best you ever had"" and she agreed. I'm not a big carrot cake guy, but it was good. I checked out the bathroom and it was pretty nice and clean.

It's a great deal.  The portion sizes are huge.  BUT, if you want steak, you'd better like very pungent blue cheese or remember to ask to keep it off your steak.  I ordered my hangar steak medium rare, but it was more on the rare end, and with a chewy piece of meat, the bright red meat was even harder to eat.  Since it was such a huge portion, I was able to just eat the more medium-rare parts off of the edges--not very elegant, but I was hungry. I started with the lobster bisque, which was lighter than I had expected, since they serve the bisque poured over a piped dollop of creme fraiche.  I opted to leave my creme fraiche floating island and ate the bisque around it so I would have room for meat and potatoes. The bread pudding was ok--the Oreo ice cream wasn't as good as something you'd get out of a supermarket gallon, unfortunately.  It was more icy than creamy, but less flavorful than the usual cookies 'n cream.  The bread pudding itself wasn't chocolaty enough to hold up a bland ice cream. N9ne reminds me of a nightclub or lounge.  The restaurant is really shiny, and the lighting changes color every hour or so.  I probably wouldn't pay steakhouse prices to eat in that environment, but for an inexpensive steak meal with good company, it served its purpose. ps: my friend informed me there are TVs in the bathroom stalls",0.932,0.86,0.1,0.04,0.5268518518518518

Hindsight is not only 20/20 but freakin' hilarious - thank God with time at least comes wisdom, right?!  All of the glitz, albeit a bit cheesy, certainly has its way of manipulating your senses. Where you may ordinarily be let down by sub-par food and low grade service, it somehow magically becomes slightly more tolerable when sitting beside mirrored columns and a lighting show. Uh huh. Naivete is cute. Or not.  I could easily write an essay on how N9NE and its horrendous staff managed to single-handedly ruin my 25th birthday but it would take entirely too long and give me a raging ulcer. From unacceptably late seating, to a table not large enough to accommodate our party, to allergy specifications not being followed, to cold food, bad attitudes, more bad attitudes and a waiter cussing my friend out.... yeah, it was bad. See I told you?? Now, where are my Tums...  So with all that being said I'm not exactly sure how I manged to be sweet talked into attending lunch here. Maybe the bad memories had begun to fade with time, maybe I'm just a forgiving soul. Either way, N9NE is still as lame as ever. The years have done nothing to age the space gracefully - it looks like a Vegas nightclub with the lights on - harsh, dirty and full of chachi, desperate people. My steak sandwich did nothing to wow me (shut up, I'm not biased!) while my garlic steak fries were hot, crispy and pretty damn good (see!). The service was decent and came without the addition of choice four letter words so I appreciated that. I can't believe they still hand out passes to Ghostbar though like you're getting special access to some ritzy, exclusive club by dining there. No one goes to Ghostbar!! They haven't in years and even when they did it was never a hoppin' spot. Give it up! You'd be better served opening a spa up there, at least that I'd go to.  I enjoy a variety of so many places now in Chicago that have the total dining package - sumptuous, upscale and defining glamour as it now exists to me - classy, refined, understated. N9NE is definitively in my rear view mirror these days. When I want Dirty Vegas I'll hop on the red eye and head to the Palms where the N9NE Group actually gets it right.",0.9659,0.685,0.176,0.139,0.6128107217729861
2008-09-30,3.0,"Going to dinner by yourself is on a list of things I don't mind doing (also on the list: laundry, cooking, and vacuuming).  I was in Chicago on business and walked into N9NE steakhouse to check it out.  I ordered the filet with a side of lobster mashed potatoes (just for me!) and some asparagus, which is actually a lot of food considering how large their portions are.  The filet was cooked to a nice medium rare (sometimes I have to order my steak a medium because people in New York think medium rare is completely red inside), and the asparagus was nicely sauteed.  The lobster mashed potatoes were WAAAY too salty, especially because they top the mashed potatoes with lobster bisque, making it taste like a salt lick. N9NE looks like it's filled with people in Chicago on business Monday - Thursday (hey, who else is going to foot the bill?) but seems like a good place to go for a trendy dinner on the weekends.",0.9228,0.9,0.1,0.0,0.6679320679320679

Special night I will make sure they have a great time and will make sure that everything is perfect and will throw in desserts. Well he was not there and nobody knew anything. Now the bottle got delivered (cause it was paid for via a fax) But NOTHING ELSE WAS ARRANGED! Things happen but then to ruin the end of a great meal and the General Manager did not even apologize for the complete screw up and the waitress was about as nice as Martha Stewart after you tracked mud on her white rug Then a large tip was auto added and the service was just TERRIBLE! Food was awesome but the employees went to the RED LOBSTER SCHOOL OF MANAGMENT....... Won't be back here or to anything they own EVER......

I love the N9ne in Vegas, it remains one of my favorite meals and was excited to see that it had made it here.  We anxiously went here for a friend's birthday hoping to relive the magic that we experienced in Vegas. If Vegas pulled a rabbit out of the hat, then Chicago's version pulled a hamster.  The potato gnocchi that literally was so good in Vegas it forced us all to order our own tray of it here was actually subpar and nowhere near the taste sensation we had before.  The scallops were subpar, Ive had much better. The food wasn't terrible but for the prices it wasnt great.  I think our favorite part came during dessert where they have very unusual concoctions including this thing that includes cotton candy, a chocolate dipped pretzel, and some type of ice cream.....its delish!  Also the smores are so creative a little fire pit and it feels like you're back at camp oniwanna. A little comfort food in a sleek upscale restaurant, such a great little touch. The ambiance though is superb, it makes you feel upscale and the overall service is nothing short of five star.

2008-08-03,3.0,"I went to N9ne for lunch last week (the day after I went to Joe's), so I can't help but use some comparison in this review. While each restaurant had a completely different vibe, I am always in it for the food. I walked into N9ne and it was mostly what I expected. Vegas lounge-ish with mainly business lunchers, scattered with businessmen and their trophy wives (more likely: mistresses). I had made a 12:15 reservation on OpenTable and we were seated promptly. Our waiter, whose name was never mentioned, was very blah. He had a ridiculous looking haircut and seemed generally disinterested in all of his tables. Now, I will say that the setup (two-tops placed very close to one another) made it difficult for him to give special attention or be particularly talkative, but that is no excuse for his pretension (or his haircut). He did promptly take our orders and refilled drinks at appropriate intervals. There were two large groups in the restaurant at the same time (about 15 people each) and it didn't seem to put a damper on the service that we received, which is always appreciated. Usually when I make my reservation on OpenTable, I end up with a great table (it seems like most restaurants actually heed the 'Opentable VIP' label). But at N9ne, we were seated at what I refer to as a ""douche table."" We were in a row of four two-tops with about a foot in between each of them. Surprisingly our conversation wasn't difficult because the tables surrounding us were eating in silence. But with a noisier crowd, it would have been nearly impossible to have a conversation. To start, I had the lobster bisque. The lobster was plentiful and the soup was okay but I was glad that I had the food runner add fresh ground pepper to it because it wasn't particularly flavorful without it. For my entree, I had the filet (just for the sake of comparison to Joe's the day before). The bearnaise sauce was fabulous, but the steak was pretty typical. It was properly cooked (medium rare) but not particularly juicy or melt-in-your-mouth. On the plate also came three mushrooms skewered on a pine frond. Maybe it was just because I saw the pine, but the mushrooms also tasted like a Christmas tree. I am not a huge fan of the smell (or taste, apparently) of pine, so I did not enjoy this.  All in, our bill was $115. As always, I left our server slightly more than 20%, but this one didn't deserve it. Our dining experience was nothing spectacular.

(Yes, I am easily distracted by pretty lighting and ""fancy"" atmosphere.)  My colleagues, who had never been there, were also impressed. The bar off to the side had all the bottles neatly aligned on the shelves. They were so perfectly lined up that I really wanted to go behind the bar just to move one out of place to see if anyone would notice.  The last time I was here I ordered the garlic roasted chicken. While the chicken was good, my taste buds were more focused on that it was really garlic-y.  I was also kind of disappointed with the amount of potatoes that came with the chicken...I mean, what I got was about 2-3 small red potatoes to go with a half-roasted chicken. I made note that I would try something new whenever I got the chance to come back.  So I did. I tried the special of the day, which was pan roasted halibut on top of asparagus and some kind of pureed sweet corn (I can't remember exactly  - sorry!). It was delicious. I definitely want to come back and try a steak. I need to bring a boy (or someone with a big appetite) because I cannot handle a single steak on my own (seriously, I can do 3-4 bites, and I am full).  Because it was lunch time, I expected it to be a bit crowded. Given that it had started snowing (on the second day of spring), I guessed the non-adventurous stayed indoors that day. Service was fine and pretty quick. We sat by some of the lounge chairs in the back near a flat screen TV, where we caught some of the employees stopping by to check out the NCAA games. Hee hee.

2008-02-13,3.0,"This place is ultra-trendy, rich, blase and utterly too cool for school.  I knew this going in, so that made it more bearable. The hostess/coat check girls were sorta like strung-out trixies. Their half-lidded stares and lazy smiles bobbed in place as we walked over to the lounge area.  We'd reserved said lounge area for a larger party and when we got there, there were people scattered throughout the space, which was strange. I guess we'd been expecting a table, but after we schmoozed one couple in a key location to please move in exchange for a round of drinks and apps, we settled into the low chairs, the sofa and a wonderfully absurd Captain Kirk chair about 6"" off the floor. The coffee table served as a makeshift table, and we began ordering drinks and apps.  The food was actually pretty good. I would have hoped it would be, for the price. They have, I think, a Kobe beef burger on the menu for some outrageous price - I can't even remember it now, but it says in big, bold letters underneath, ""of COURSE you get the fries,"" which I thought was mildly amusing.  The drinks were ok. There were a few mixed drinks I'd had that I didn't really taste any alcohol. And call me crazy, but if I'm bucking up $15 for a skinny cocktail with more ice than liquid, I'm going to want to taste the alcohol. The cocktail waitress for the lounge was noticably ding-y; she would forget some of the drinks, bring the wrong ones, bring half of the drinks and then forget about the other half until reminded...a very pretty girl, but clearly everything below the neck was the focus.  The bathrooms...ok, I'm not one to wax poetic about where I eliminate, but the bathrooms were pretty sweet, if a little silly. The walls are this faux-croc leather-look stuff. It's a little unnerving in flesh tone - makes me think about super-dry skin - but still interesting. The doors are heavy and the hardware upscale (for a bathroom). Inside the stalls - at least in the women's bathroom - there are small 3"" square flat-screen TVs...set to ESPN, lol. So I could feasibly watch some college basketball on the throne. Just like home (insert eye roll here).  Most of the other diners in the main dining room appeared to be loaded young professionals. The bar was well-stocked with groups of men, young and old, all fine suits, suspenders, French cuffs and expensive hand-tooled Italian leather shoes (or so I imagine).

I myself didn't necessarily feel out of place - also helps that I was there on someone else's dime - but I was definitely on my best behavior.  In all, a very pretty place with very pretty people.

Well, not quite all fronts: the hostesses were gorgeous and the coat-check girl was cute in a probably-high, headband-sporting hipster chick sort of way. The layout is open and the space is relatively well-lit; this is clearly a place to see and be seen.  Yet, when I arrived at 8:00pm on a Friday, the place was less than half full.  This may have had something to do with the particularly miserable weather that night, but was surprising regardless. The first major disappointment came in the form of our white dinner jacket-clad waiter.  The wait staff's uniform (logo-emblazoned white jacket over black pants) was tacky and left all the waiters looking like awkward teenage prom-attendees.  Our server really rubbed me the wrong way; he wasn't rude to us, but he seemed like he would have fit in better over at Ed Debevics.  When he came to take our order, he smelled noticeably of cigarette smoke, YUCK! Finally, the food.  My two friends and I split three appetizers: the calamari, the rock shrimp, and the avocado.  Thinly sliced and accompanied by mango, cilantro and jalapeno, the avocado appetizer was fresh, light and tasty; it finished the night as my favorite part of the meal.  The calamari and shrimp were both deep-fried and tasty, but also overpriced and nothing special, and the shrimp's presentation (a cardboard popcorn container) could easily have been improved. For the main course, I ordered a rib eye done rare with Bearnaise and a side of their signature $12 lobster mashed potatoes.  The rib eye was a nice, thick cut, but it was also somewhat tough and came slightly overdone; the Bearnaise was less than noteworthy; and then there was my $12 side.  Lobster and mashed potatoes are, independently, two of the finest culinary creations known to man, so I looked past the cost and ordered the lobster mashed potatoes when the waiter advised me to.  I should have known better than to let our waiter up-sell me.  The potatoes were so smooth (runny, even) that I strongly suspect they came from a box of powdered potatoes, and the tiny bits of lobster didn't really do anything to enhance the runny potatoes.  I'll stick with garden-variety garlic mashed potatoes any day of the week.",0.9934,0.781,0.16,0.059,0.5094708994708995

2008-01-11,4.0,"This was the first ""trendy"" restaurant I went to after graduating from college.  A coworker took a group of us ""trainees"" out to Nine for lunch, and I must say I was very impressed.  A lush, velvet curtain hanging from the ceiling greets you upon entrance into the ""waiting"" area.  There is a coat check area off to the right which comes in handy when wearing the typical Chicago winter uniform.  The views of the restaurant, bars, and lounge are amazing from this level, as you have to walk down an open staircase to reach them.  The restaurant is surrounded by brown velvet booths with tables on the interior, and a circular bar right in the middle.  Mirrored poles run floor to ceiling, and the dim purple hued light really plays off of them.  The bar around the perimeter (and to the right) of the restaurant has an orange glow and is usually full of people.  There's a lounge area adjacent to that bar with a big screen TV and several seating areas. On to the food.... I am a huge fan of soup, so whenever I eat out I usually try a cup prior to my entree.  I really like the Lobster Bisque (this is the only soup I've tried at Nine), and I order it every time I dine there.  The presentation is nice too.  The waiter places the very generously sized bowl in front of you with little bits of lobster meat in the center.  He then pours the soup in the bowl from a small silver decanter.  The recipe is the same as the day I tried this 7 years ago, and I have never tasted a bad batch.   Once I find a particular item on the menu that I love...I typically stick with it.  Such is the case at Nine.  When I first tried their Rock Shrimp 7 years ago I was hooked.  They are fried and come in a small white ""Chinese take out"" carton with sides of a horseradish type mild sauce and hot sauce.  I use the accompanying chop sticks to dip the shrimp first in the hot sauce and then the mild sauce which is an absolutely delicious combination.  Be warned, this is a spicy sauce combination so drink plenty of water in between bites.  The wait staff is very good about refilling glasses when they get low. My husband tried the Kobe Burger and absolutely loved it.  He is a big fan of burgers, and said this is one of the best he's ever had by far.  The garlic steak fries that accompanied the burger were well seasoned and came with a tangy ketchup dipping sauce. Drink, drink, and be merry I'm not a big drinker, but when I go out socially I will have a glass or two.  Nine specializes in martinis.  I have tried the signature ""Ghostini"" (which blends Absolut, Midori and sour), and a chocolate martini.  The Ghostini was tasty, but very strong.  The martini glass is huge, so one drink was plenty enough for me.  The chocolate martini was delicious and easier to get down.  This is definitely a restaurant I will keep coming back too.  I have never had a bad experience, and always bring out-of-towners here to enjoy the sleek, modern environment and delicious food.",0.9958,0.869,0.126,0.006,0.4804090354090355

Super-trendy interiors and chic center bar makes this place the premiere steakhouse in Chicago! The clientle is well dressed, and the waiters knowledgeable, and the food is superb. Our waiter was very knowledgeable in the wines, starting us off with a nice chardonnay and a tasting of sparkling wine. This was followed by a great selection of appetizers, the best of which had to be the Calamari. Perfectly seasoned with an aeoli, it definitely helped to warm us up to the meal.  The steaks here just pushed it over the top. I ended up choosing the New York Strip, given my determination to save room for dessert. In choosing the NY Strip, I was recommended to go with the Oscar option. WOW was that the best choice I ever made! The steak was subsequently treated to a whole lump meat dungeoness crab topping that had been kissed with a delightful cream sauce! Talk about amazing surf and turf! The crab was definitely just-pulled meat from a whole crab, and was piled as high as humanly possible on this steak! But not to take away from the steak, the meat was very tender, noticeably beef-tasting, and was greatly complimented by the addition of the cream sauce crab! Side dishes of creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes helped ease the Oscar'ed steak down, along with a Meritage recommendation of our always-attentive waiter.  Dessert took the form of a root-beer float with two freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. The root beer was brewed locally, and combined with the vanilla ice cream topped off a perfectly good meal! Expect to spend generously here, upwards of $100-120 per person for just food. But know that if you are going to spend that much, this is definitely the place to do it.

I ordered the miso cod because so many reviews raved about it (and they were totally right - it melted in my mouth better than any steak).  I think our group of 11 all ordered one of three entrees: the miso cod, the filet mignon or the surf & turf.  And I think everyone cleaned their dinner plates .... and their soup (lobster bisque) and salad plates before that .... and all the appetizers before that (tuna tar tare - ooo! is there avocado in there? yum, calamari, shrimp cocktail) .... and we ordered a ton of sides as well including asparagus, creamed corn, and both the skinny shoestring fries AND the garlic steak fries.  And then came dessert.  And I remember starting to feel full after the apps and the bisque.  (So clearly, I *had* to walk home!) The location was great for a week night office group, especially a (Metra-riding) meat and potatoes group like ours.  The attentive waiter pointed out the oysters and mussels but I knew no one at our table would be ordering those.  I saw a lot of our appetizers repeated on other tables which all seemed to be business dinners as well.

2007-01-04,4.0,"Came to N9NE for my birthday dinner with a large party. I had made reservations ahead of time, but due to my large party, I had to sign a contract to pay $25/person if we cancel. Well, yeah that sucked, but just make sure you don't cancel on them!  We went on a Saturday night expecting it to be packed, but it wasn't at all. Service was good, except we did order a drink from the bar which never came, but they gave us a free shot for their mistake.  Had a great wine selection and knowledgeable servers. I ordered the surf and turf entree for $40 and the lobster bisque (which my friends have been raving about before I went). They had a specials menu, which my friends ordered from, most ordered the cod entree, which some of them split. The restaurant took the extra effort into seperating the entree into two dishes for them. They could not stop raving about it! They even started calling family members about how they should go there! Everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. (for pics just check out their website) I went to Ghostbar before I went to N9NE, they played techno and house music, which personally, I don't like. I think I went when it was a private party, so i can't say too much about the crowd there on a typical night. Super trendy place though.",0.992,0.732,0.207,0.061,0.5320436507936508
