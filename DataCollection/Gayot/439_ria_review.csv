2013-12-08,5.0,"On a visit to Chicago I had the good fortune of visiting both RIA and Charlie Trotters (at the time the reigning Chicago restaurants boasting 2 Michelin stars).  And although Trotters was expected to be the highlight, in light of it being a chance to visit the venerable institution of fine dining before it shuttered its doors, I was surprised to find that RIA was the true stand out.  In fact, from the standpoint of food quality, presentation, and service ... RIA blew Trotters out of the water on all points. I am sad that RIA is now closed as well, because I certainly would have made a point to return to this (once) wonderful restaurant.",0.9423,0.796,0.179,0.025,0.6421428571428571

2012-09-09,5.0,"We absolutely loved RIA. My then-boyfriend too me there for my birthday, and it has been our greatest fine dining experience yet. Service: Even long before we walked into RIA, we had great service. My husband talked to multiple people about what we would be eating as vegetarians. We have learned from past dinners :) A chef even called him to talk about what ingredients we would like to see, and suggested they customize a menu for us. Great service! The day-of, all of the staff spent ample time with us. The sommelier did not push us to do a wine tasting, and really understood that we only wanted to get 1 or 2 glasses for the night. So he chose inexpensive wines that really paired beautifully with most of our courses. It was great. Food: You rarely walk out of these tasting menus bursting at the seams. I remember being suprised by how very full I was getting up after the meal. Although value for the money isn't the priority when going into a place like RIA, it's certainly nice when it happens :) More importantly, the food was simply a pleasure to see and taste. Everything we ate was seasonal (it was early December, so imagine the challenge). At that time of year, it is VERY difficult to put together 5 vegetarian courses without duplicating feature ingredients, color palettes, or concepts. You don't have the luxury of simply featuring a cut of meat and really only needing to change up the garnish. They achieved it flawlessly. In addition to the seasonal concepts, the three best parts of the meal were the plating concepts and the textures. For example, we were served a deconstructed salad. They took several kinds of greens, and served them in different ways, angled across each other over the plate, with drizzles here and there of interesting reductions, foams, and oils. Some were braised, some broiled, some grilled etc. Making bites from this plate was exciting not only for the visual, but because of the variety of textures and flavor palletes you could make for yourself. The different textures I experienced was as much fun as the different flavors. Similarly, we had one course where across the plate, they put down what looked like a whole series of polka dots. That was it. Each one was a dollop of a different kind of puree, piece of a vegetable, or something else. There were different textures, colors, and flavors, but it just looked like a sea of polka dots. Dessert was like that too - lots of interest created with unusual flavors together, plus a nice crunch here and there. Dessert featured squashes, which is a very unusual and refreshing way to incorporate squash. You can't avoid it in December, but to do it in a new way is great. One note, if you are going early for drinks at the Elysian (which I think might now be the Waldorf Astoria). The bar down there serves chips with drinks that are cooked in beef fat. So don't eat them if you're a vegetarian! All in all a pleasure to eat at RIA. We don't grudge a single dollar. We'll be back as soon as we can afford it.",0.9966,0.854,0.139,0.007,0.596444547515976

In addition, we made a mistake of choosing this restaurant at this particular time, because the menu really did not appeal to me. Most dish had meat I didn't like, or was cooked in a way I couldn't eat (i.e., I like raw or seared scallop, but never steamed)  I felt really embarrassed, as the menu almost looked like a collection of my no-no food. Ugh.  I ordered the tasting menu anyways. The presentation was beautiful, a bit too much played...  I couldn't really eat, and left hungry and disappointed.  I wasn't happy (felt almost guilty!) to see my hubby and staff concerned.  I tried my best, but my skin seems extremly thin when it comes to food.",0.9843,0.654,0.233,0.113,0.5376149491534107

We added the additional truffle course which was good, but again not really worth the benefit (although I do like to try everything at least once). However the main dishes themselves (we did the tasting menu) were fantastic.  Exquisitely prepared and professionally served. If I went back and simply steered towards the traditional food items and a couple of cocktails (also fantastic), I would probably have given a 5 star review.  Ria is an exceptional restaurant, and another great reason why dining in Chicago is one of the best culinary destinations on the planet.",0.9893,0.746,0.24,0.014,0.49372294372294373

The amuse bouches were great too and the service was impeccable.  I loved the decor as it really hits the nice yet comfortable setting.  Did not feel like it was stuffy at all.  But now the bad news... As great as the experience was, we were informed that the restaurant is closing.  I could not believe it.  It was so good, and my family had already been planning to return for other special occasions.  To make it worse, we heard rumors as to why the restaurant was closing.  Supposedly, when the Waldorf Astoria took over the Elysian, since it is now a chain hotel, they are looking to cut costs.  Not sure if this is just a rumor or not, but if this is true, thats a true shame and would never support by staying at any waldorf astoria hotels.

2012-07-11,4.0,"RIA was my first 2 Michelin Star experience in the US. I liked it a lot, although I expected a little more delicacy for one of the  courses (i mean a little bit :)). Nonetheless, the experience was really great and very enjoyable. Thank you Chef :-)  Maybe this will sound inexperienced, or weird, but my favorite parts were  the amuse bouche. There were REALLY amazing and delicate. And I want to add, unique in their texture and taste. I have never eaten such delicious and delicate amuse-bouche anywhere else. We had deep fried brie cheese balls, from Wisconsin (I am not sure) - so rich in flavor and melting so nicely in your mouth. And my favorite one: some ""little rolls"" made of foie gras and truffle. I was in heaven :) I was eating them really slowly to appreciate them as long as possible. I have taken discretely a photo of them for a souvenir :)  I actually hate taking photos while eating... but these... I did not want to forget! I'll upload the photos soon.  The only thing I did not particularly enjoy,  (and that's why I put 4 starts instead of 5) was the sparkling wine selection they bring before you start your meal.  It's very nice and they have a diversified selection, but  it kind of forces you to take one... and I was not in the mood to drink sparkling wine at this time... However I still took one because I felt I had to. Maybe I am a weak person :-)   The place itself is very nice. Very sophisticated, modern. The decoration is very well done because it can fit many styles of diners: romantic, business, food-lovers, classy etc. Voila!

The food was better than I expected.  We did the summer tasting and it was a large amount of food.  Everything tasted great!  The menu reminded me of a refined Schwa, if that oxymoron makes sense.

2012-07-06,5.0,A great night and fantastic experience.  I've long maintained that at this level (and price) a meal is not necessarily twice as delicious as a meal costing half as much.  What I'm looking for is an elevation of the dining experience. The food is expectedly good but I'm also looking for dinner theatre without the theatre.  Ria carries that out well. The service is nearly seamless. At times effusive but interspersed with times of appropriate reserve. The food (my primary rating driver) is indeed one step beyond excellent. The wine pairings with my extended tasting menu were not just well chosen but were outstanding wines by themselves (except for one which I thought was a stretch).

I spent $90 within 5 minutes of being seated. How did that happen? The sommelier kindly wheeled over a beautiful cart containing a Copper Bucket filled with crushed ice and four bottles of bubbly.  ""Congratulations on your 3 Year anniversary. And to start off your evening we have a selection of four delicious champagnes.......What may I serve you?"" Conscience: I hope there isn't a caviar cart followed by a Wagyu Beef cart followed  by a Flight of Grand Dessert Cart. ""Let's start with the Beau Joie Brut Rose."" This was Tracy's first Rose and I think she is now a Rose fan. It was worth every dollar.  Ria is tasting menu only. We selected a tandem Spring Menu with a wine pairing. We had been drinking at a Kentucky Derby event earlier so we didn't think we could handle a full wine tasting. Ria provided us with a half-pour version so that we could enjoy the pairings without going overboard. That was a nice touch. The food here is beautifully composed and exquisitely presented. There is a whole lot of care and effort in every detail. The experience at restaurants with this type of price tag is designed to pamper you and make you feel special.  Ria succeeds...no Ria excels at this. I cannot think of a better restaurant to celebrate those special occasions that call for Michelin-starred food, wine, and service.

I thought we were going to go to Alinea again to keep up the birthday tradition, so arriving ar RIA was definitely a surprise. I've heard about RIA before but never really look too much into it since it wasn't generating a lot of buzz (I mean, just look at the number of reviews on yelp...under a 100 total reviews) and I was never a huge fan of french food/wine... Anyway, we got to RIA and everything was nice and elegant, just like you would expect from a five star hotel restaurant. The room was full but quiet and the chair was super plushy and comfortable. Everything was nice but not extraordinary...until the food arrived... We had the tasting menu with wine pairing (it was my birthday after all). The first 3 complimentary courses were tasty...you have your flavor infused foam (seriously, what is up with the fascination with foam?), there's soup and tiny tiny dumplings to open up your appetite. The wine was also super juicy and delicious. When the main course arrived, I was already having a good feeling about this place- that they were on trend, but grounded in tradition. The courses were simple, it's not like there are 20 courses and you forgot what you are eating, however, every single dish was so freaking delicious and cooked to absolute perfection and leaves you wanting for more. I have to stop myself from diving into describing every single dish because I think I'll just be sitting at my desk drooling. Yes, the food was that good. Go book your reservation right now. Seriously. Before Danny Grant burnt out.  Having been to Alinea, Charlie Trotter and half dozen one star place around the city plus other 2, 3 Michelin starred places  around the country and Europe, RIA took me completely by surprise. Just goes to show that, while innovation is important, simplicity and respect for traditions and the ingredients still has its place.

2012-04-28,5.0,"Chef Danny Grant is a master of sauces; while he makes use of the entire panoply of available cooking and chemistry, his food never seems contrived like the much ballyhooed Alinea.  RIA is much closer in spirit and taste to classic french with a modern outlook. Before the meal started the assistant wine sommelier wheeled around a Champagne cart. He was very helpful in choosing a glass of champagne at $30.00;one glass was all we ordered, but it was excellent.  It was clear that this was not included in the tasting menu. We did not order the accopmpanying wine tasting but ordered wines by the glass; again the sommelier was very helpful and knowledgable. The Chef's tasting menu consisted of 7 course supplemented by 6 amuses. Before the first course we had 4 amuse bouches of various texture and cuising, all tasty.  The 7 courses we had have generally been described and can be found online as well; I would add that the first course, with scallop, caviar, octupus, creme fraiche and truffle was a symphony of coordinated flavors, the caviar mild and a perfect complement. We substituted a warm foie gras for the cold foie gras on the menu at an extra cost of $17.  It was a good move; a substantial piece of foie gras accompanied by kumquats and almond flavoring and a fresh brioche.  We split a glass of Sauternes with it.  Yummy. The dover sole course was served with apples, mushrooms and a sauce made with calvados; quite exceptional.  I've had better sole when it was the only entree, but in the context of a multi-course meal it was excellent.

Great flavors and complimented by the mushrooms. The main course would be the wagyu beef and lobster--wagyu was medium rare, I usually eat steak medium, but that medium rare wagyu was very flavorful and the sauce took it to a different level.  I think we had two dessert courses, the first one i don't remember, could be due to too much wine by that time, or the fact it wasn't too impressive.

2012-01-12,4.0,"We went here for the first time for my birthday (February 2011 just shortly after Chef Jason left), and it was an amazing dinner.  The service was top notch.  The food was really good except I didn't care for the scallop dish nor the sea bass dish.  The sea bass dish was cold with a watercress puree that didn't really please my palate.  I really loved the squab and dry aged strip loin.  At that time, my fiance (now husband) and I enjoyed our meal so much that we decided to host our wedding reception at RIA.   Unless you're about to rent the entire restaurant, RIA has a small, rectangular, private room that seats about 12 individuals comfortably.  There isn't a whole lot of room to move around in it or have huge centerpieces.  Although our wedding party was small, it was a great night that we can't stop reminiscing over.  The private party coordinator was really easy to work with and accommodating in helping us put together our menu.  I love what Chef Danny has done and how he's reinvented the dishes.   Although we had a great time, but we all thought that the service was a bit slow.  I, also, didn't like how they plated our wedding cake.  There were a few other hiccups throughout the night that I do not care to mention but prevents me from giving them 5 stars.",0.9466,0.822,0.139,0.039,0.5205555555555557
2011-12-21,2.0,"I am usually the reader of reviews, not the writer.  But our experience this past Saturday night at RIA was so disappointing that I feel compelled to share it.  The four of us had been anticipating a wonderful evening, but the experience was no where near Michelin 2 star dining.  The service was so haphazard and sometimes non-existent.  The waiter seemed rushed and she was often not available for long stretches of time.  Even the busboy did not replace bread or napkins when our guest left for the bathroom.  The sommelier was overly friendly initially, and yet never checked to see how we were enjoying our $300 Chateauneuf du Pape.  The reason for the two stars, instead of one star is that the food was good--not great, but good.  The foie gras with pumpernickel was delicious--yet lacked the extra bread that the busboy did not replace.  The dover sole was delicious, but the lobster and filet mignon entree lacked sauce for the lobster, and although tasty, was not imaginative at all.  The sweatbreads appetizer was fried like a fritter--awful!!!  So, save your money.  Or, better yet, spend it at Alinea which deserves the 3 stars, or Les Nomades which deserves the stars but did not receive any.  We will never go back.",0.9898,0.806,0.172,0.022,0.45999999999999996

2011-12-04,5.0,"It was a surprise to many when Ria received 2 Michelin stars back in 2010. With the departure of the opening chef, some speculated that it would drop a star. But lo and behold, Ria retained its 2-star status this year under the leadership of Chef Grant. At the strong recommendation of a friend, we visited Ria for its seasonal tasting menu.  The gougere had great cheese flavor; a seemingly traditional French start. But then the contemporary spin took off. The second amuse was a Nantucket scallop in a scallop mousse. Pure and refreshing. Then there was the foie gras truffle dumpling. The foie truffle filling had explosive umami, buttressed by a pristine consomme. The dumpling wrap was al dente. But the top of the dumpling (where the pasta was bunched up and made into a knot) was thicker than the rest of the pasta that held the filling, resulting in the top being slightly undercooked. This would be considered an execution error in Chinese cooking, as we usually make the side of the circular wrap thinner, so the resulting wonton skin would have universal thickness. Though this could be a cultural bias, as my friend found it perfectly al dente. The bread service was limited, with only one selection. But the mini baguette was of a perfect consistency and fragrance. The butter was at the perfect spreading temperature and had a glistening appearance. Very good! The five-course menu was sensibly portioned. Highlights included the duo of snapper, one cooked and one carpaccio. Both executions were excellent. The carpaccio was especially engaging, as it show-cased the sweetness of the fish, as contrasted by the tart pomegranate seeds and bright mustard greens. The dover sole dish was amazing. The fish, which sandwiched the delicate chanterelle mushroom, was incredibly tender. The Calvados sauce, accented by apple strips, was truly addictive. We totally shed our pride and cleaned the plates with spoon and baguette. The pheasant dish was equally memorable. They wrapped pheasant farce with fatty pheasant meat and skin. This was paired with a umami-rich Madeira sauce. The pheasant was tender and flavorful, and the black pepper in the sauce cut through the fat of the pheasant beautifully. The potato gnocchi that accompanied the dish was, in comparison, forgettable and unnecessary. The dessert was a bit of a let down. While the chocolate dome with chai spice and pumpkin ice cream was good, it lacked contrasting textures that was signature under the previous pastry chef. The mignardises were good. But the macaron meringue shell lacked airiness. The take-home gift was dehydrated hot chocolate. I would have preferred a gift that didn't require me to warm up my own milk, but the result - an intensely rich cup of hot chocolate - was well worth the effort. I had the ""around the world"" wine pairing. With the exception of the German pinot noir, which lacked the body and depth needed for the pheasant dish, all the other wine selections were excellent and paired well with the food. This was the most successful wine pairing I've had in Chicago (better than that of L2O and Alinea).  The main dining room lacked separation from the lounge and its neighbor Balsan. The noise from without made this one of the loudest Michelin 2+ star dining rooms I've been. The understated yet luxurious dining room was beige and neutral in palette. The wall was covered in textured silk, and the artwork, as my friend aptly pointed out, provided a sense of movement in this otherwise awkwardly shaped space.  Although there was no vaulted ceiling or dramatic chandelier, it certainly didn't hurt to eat in a room appointed with crisp-white linen, plush furniture. fine china, and Christofle flatware. Service was seamless and knowledgeable. The waitstaff were all passionate about the food and wine served and were perfectly capable of talking beyond the memorized script. At one point, there was some misunderstanding about how much I was supposed to be charged for the wine-pairing. But the mistake was rectified with grace. The no-tip policy of the hotel was also observed by the seating hostess, who kindly informed me that tip was not necessary for coat check.  Admittedly, I had expected the meticulously plated food to have a reserved flavor-profile (kind of like Chef McClain's Spring before it closed down), but this meal surpassed my expectation. No doubt, each plate was painstakingly composed. But the flavor was anything but reserved. We met Chef Grant during the kitchen tour. He was personable and forthcoming with his desire to make Ria better. Obviously, he is gunning for that 3rd Michelin star. From this meal, I'd say the kitchen is already cooking at a level no worse than restaurants like Daniel, Jean George's, and L2O (under Gras). Course after course the food showed great flavors and impeccable execution. If Ria fine-tunes its desserts and expands its bread and mignardies offerings, I think that 3rd star is well within reach.",0.998,0.806,0.153,0.041,0.5685520960520962
2011-11-18,4.0,"I had the privilege of going to Ria last night with a friend who made arrangements with me for this dinner as a mystery meal. It was a fun night, I had no idea I was going here till we pulled up in the drive way. Sometimes the best meals are unplanned, fun! We arrived earlier than our reservation with hopes of enjoying a pre-dinner cocktail in the lounge area. I really liked the coffee table we sat at, it was a vertical slice of a tree with one wood end support and a single glass support that ran the length of the table. Very clever and my brain kept drifting from the conversation to the table. I kind of want to make one of these. I will note it was the only warm earthy piece of furniture in the restaurant, a much needed feeling that I thought was also needed in the dining room.  I started out with the Lady Killer vodka drink and the chilled mussels, both outstanding. The Lady Killer packed quite a punch, I might go back just for that drink then again I'm a sucker for a great glass of Vodka. The mussels came out really nice, subtle flavors and after savoring the first two I ate them as fast as I could. The only thing keeping me from being rude was allowing my dining companion to stay one ahead of me, to keep me on pace! After being seated in the dining room, I opted for the Chef's Tasting and we had the sommelier pick out a bottle of wine for us that matched the entire dinner well. We opted not to get the wine pairing for fear that it would distract from the enjoyment of the meal. Having already consumed a Lady Killer and sipping on a wonderful glass of champagne, this was a wise decision. The bottle was a lovely red wine, I'm glad I wrote the name down as I plan on buying a few bottles for gifts.  The meal itself was done quite well, all the dishes I really enjoyed. Nothing really stood out as memorable, as a matter of fact, even though I just ate there yesterday I don't remember much of what I ate. Service was great and being close to the youngest people in the room (mind you in our early 30's), we took liberty of having some fun with our wait staff. They were a lot of fun. I enjoyed all the courses except the chocolate dish at the end, I really do not care for chocolate but gave it a go.  Why am I only giving it 4 stars? There are so many reasons why I want to give this place 5 stars, however, having been to several equivalent restaurants for the price I expected more out of the meal. I expected some sort of wow factor and didn't get it. The fact I can't remember anything that stood out as awesome kind of bothers me, I haven't had that happen yet at a restaurant like this.  I also left dinner still hungry and that was REALLY disappointing. The portion sizes for the Chef's Tasting I felt were correct but it really could have used 1~2 more plates, or increase the portions slightly. I have fundamental issues with spending so much money on a meal that was not filling, given the amount of time (We ended up being there for about 4 hours) and money spent at the restaurant. Lastly, not that I mind, but the wait staff also kept assuming I was married to my dinner companion. I corrected them twice, in a joking manner but still, pay a little more attention.  At the end of the day I will probably be back for the Lady Killer and to try something else, however I don't think I'll get the Chef's Tasting again despite the dishes being excellent.",0.9901,0.813,0.135,0.053,0.5085159989921894

We arrived early because I wanted to try the bartender's ""Honeymoon"" and have an appetizer at the bar before dinner. The oysters we enjoyed were phenomenal and the ""Honeymoon"" cocktail was truly amazing. Our bartender was top notch. However the seating area in the bar was quite noisy with a loud child complete with scrapes from the feet of the high chair. The ""scrape"" sounded like a yelp from a large dog getting kicked.  At length, the noise was not a major concern because we were going to close out our tab at the bar and complete our evening in the dining room of Ria.  However, at the hostess stand, our dining experience was dropped to a whole new level.

2011-08-13,5.0,"When making your reservation, tell them it's your birthday.  Lie if you have to.   We had the best waiter I've ever had in any kind of dining or service situation period.  The guy was the perfect blend of class, professionalism, expertise in selling his product that you would expect from a fine dining establishment like this, but he had a comforting charm and easygoing warmth that kept the air from getting too stuffy.  If there was a ""best waiter in the world"" reality show out there he would at a minimum finish top 3 if somehow he didn't win it flat out.  If I was filthy rich, could afford him, and could convince him to do it I'd hire him as my butler in a second.  And I noticed how good of a waiter he was even before he offered to sing me Happy Birthday in Italian, then whipped out his pitch perfect, booming tenor voice (clearly a professional singer).  I was totally floored. So, while the service is beyond top notch - which is a prerequisite for a place like this - there is a genuine warmth to it (even the manager who walked me to the bathroom) that goes beyond top-of-the-line service. That being said, the food - the real reason to go to Ria - is fabulous as well.  Each dish is a meticulously prepared work of art - I think a pair of tweezers must be in the chef's arsenal.  There was a dish I didn't really like off the seasonal tasting - which was this lamb and olive dish - but I probably didn't like it mostly because I hate lamb and olives.  So I appreciate how the chef made those two ingredients more palatable to me.",0.9973,0.715,0.257,0.028,0.545
2011-08-10,5.0,"***Ria utilizes high quality ingredients to deliver flavorful food with nice presentations, which puts it in the same class as Providence, Manresa, and The Restaurant at Meadowood*** Ria sits in the beautiful Elysian hotel.  The courtyard entrance is incredible; the exterior reminds me of an upscale hotel I would expect to see in Beverly Hills or Vegas.  The bar adjacent to Ria is also nice (big marble counter and a nice showcase for drinks and cheese). Ria's dining room is comfortable but it is not as nice looking as the hotel.  The room is a little too spacious and rectangular.  It reminds me of a hotel banquet room.  They have definitely done some work to the room, but I was not a big fan of their choices for chairs, shade of carpet, walls, and so on. While Ria is not my favorite dining room, the food is very good.  They properly cooked high quality produce.  And despite using a lot of light ingredients, they still churned out distinct flavors (I've been to quite a few of these fine dining spots where the food lacked intensity). Like other excellent fine dining restaurants, Ria shows a strong attention to detail--highlighted by their strong bread.  Their bread (baguette) was nice and chewy with a good crust.  The butter was soft and incredibly creamy. The amuses were good too.  The Gruyere puffs had a good cheese flavor and there was a nice contrast between the airy center and the crust (though I would have preferred a more distinct crust).  Their cucumber gelee with cold cream was refreshing.  Their foie gras and truffle ravioli was also good (though not as flavorful as Providence's foie gras ravioli). I had the tasting menu and my first course was chilled scallops with caviar and octopus.  While the octopus was good (it could have been a little softer), the scallops were very good.  They were very fresh as well as soft and moist.  The caviar provided a salty punch to the mostly mild dish. My second course was a rabbit terrine, which had a foie gras center.  The terrine was moist and flavorful (nicely seasoned).  It was accompanied by very sweet pumpernickel bread that was garnished with radishes, carrots and sweet and plump raisins.  The sweet sides went well with the terrine. My fish entree was one of the best fish dishes I had in Chicago.  The black cod was incredibly moist and flaky.  The sauce (which was kind of a mushroom sauce) was creamy and flavorful but not too rich.  I liked a lot of the sides as well.  The razor clams were good as were the earthy chanterelles.  The garlic mousse ravioli was okay (the pasta was too thick). My final entree was the guinea hen, which was nicely roasted.  It was incredibly moist, juicy and tender.  It had a great flavor and was topped with a very satisfying Madeira sauce.  The sides were good and fresh.  I enjoyed the English peas as well as the tarragon.  I also liked the salty flavor of the crispy chicken skin. The potato gnocchi was good too, but I prefer a more seared and crispy gnocchi (like what I had at Spruce in SF). I also opted for the cheese plate and it was one of the better cheese plates I've had.  They have a mix of European and American cheeses (that are similar varieties), which makes it fun to compare.  I had several cheeses and they were all creamy.  There was great variety in flavors--a slightly pungent flavor to a much stronger flavor.  Some of the cheeses even had a little heat. The cheese garnishes were great--light crisps, candied pecans, moist date cake, incredibly thick and sweet honey, and very delicious walnuts that had been soaked in sugar cane syrup. Desserts were also good.  My pre-dessert was mint ice paired with very creamy and flavorful coconut ice cream and yuzu pearls.  My main dessert was a chocolate ganache that was not too rich (it had a relatively light texture).  The dessert came with some very good banana and crispy puffed rice as well as a cool and refreshing salt sherbet. The meal ended with some complimentary items--macaron, pate de fruit and a chocolate truffle.  They also provided some complimentary chocolate hazelnut candies to-go.  These were okay, but they lacked the crunchy nuts and crispy toffee texture of the similar chocolate hazelnut candies at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville. Service was very good.  My waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and showed a strong passion for the food.  The whole staff was professional, polite and attentive, but they were also very welcoming and personable (which I felt was missing at other Chicago spots I tried). Pricing is high, but the quality of the food at Ria is noticeably better than several other places in Chicago, LA and SF. Ria was one of my most satisfying meals in Chicago (as well as anywhere) and it is definitely one to consider if you are on the hunt for a restaurant similar in quality/style to Providence, Manresa and The Restaurant at Meadowood.

The room is understated and elegant: an easy and comfortable place to have a quiet conversation. The service is breezy and unpretentious- no fawning and no phoniness, just thorough and attentive professionalism from start to finish. It is the kind of service that you simply don't notice until the end of the meal when you realize that there wasn't a moment of sluggishness or annoyance through the evening. The food is also wonderfully understated. The theatrical touches that have become a (sometimes distracting) drawing card in many upscale restaurants these days are conspicuously absent. It is refreshing: the focus seems to be on superb ingredients juxtaposed in perfect balance with one another. Why is that so unusual? Sea Scallop with Harkurei Turnip, octopus, and the supplemental White Sturgeon Caviar was divine. Just the right amount of acidity to spotlight the mild saltiness of the caviar and the scallops cooked with a light touch to tender perfection. The Peking Duck was a marvel of subtle and delicate caramelized smokiness and savoriness. Dover Sole was effervescent and delicate: the fish baked in a crust to a perfect supple texture in a perfect sauce with a hint of lavender aromatics that seems to imbue the ability of levitation to the food in the mouth. Chocolate pudding, puffed rice, Banana, and Maldon Salt Sherbet finished things off with just the right amount of sweetness and light. Ria is among a handful of truly great restaurants I have been to that make it ""look easy."" Don't be fooled: it's not! To bring about a seamlessly beautiful culinary experience like this takes discipline, knowledge, and serious communication from the chef, to the management, and to the staff.

Be sure to arrive hungry, because on top of those seven courses you are laid two amuses-bouche.  Ours were a soup and a mousse of white sable.  It is quite hard to imagine how creamy and smooth fish can be until Ria whips it into a perfect mousse.  This was merely a whisper of delights to come. Our first course consisted of a perfectly seared sea scallop adorned with a tentacle of baby octopus.  This was clearly why Ria is known for seafood, and I have no complaints. The second course was a minor miss, and that was primarily through advertising.  It was rabbit, and I was hoping for a hunk of braised Peter Rabbit, and instead received Peter Terrine.  I'm not much of a fan of terrined meat and so was disappointed, although the execution of the style was perfectly fine. This minor disappointment was quickly forgotten because the next course was a tour de force - Dover Sole in Calvados sauce.  The Sole was juicy chewy deliciousness with a hit of truffle, and made us realize why sole filleted tableside is such a delicacy - the fish was gorgeous. Up next was my meat paradise - seared duck followed by short ribs with bone marrow.  These two dishes were both executed to perfection - the duck was deep rare and juicy and the short ribs had the ripe smokiness you expect from them, topped off with the savory flavors of bone marrow. Sure, bone marrow is a thing these days, but when it is roasted to perfection, you understand why.  Anthony Bourdain would drool over this. Finally, we hit desserts - a one-two punch of fatty butter and bitter chocolate.  First, we had brown butter, cinnamon, and ice cream.  Then, our palates reeling, we were knocked out with chocolate, cocoa, and sherbet.  I was swooning throughout it all.  What makes Ria better than the rest, however, is not the food, which of course is top notch, but the service.  The sommelier, a youthful wunderkind, genuinely cared about his collection, and when I noted, with slight disappointment, that his Cote Rotie selection did not have significant age, he pointed me toward an older, and earthier than usual for the appellation, Gigondas.  It was exactly what I wanted and actually much less expensive than I was willing to shell out, an unusual dedication to customer satisfaction.  When we killed the bottle, he brought out samples of a couple of their French wines from which I could choose.  It was customer service at its finest, and it reminded me why its good to be the king. In addition, our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, was fluent in Italian.  I know this because, at dessert, he sang happy birthday to Kelly.  Opera style.  In Italian.  Who knew?  Kelly loved it, and you can't buy that kind of surprise.  Well, perhaps you can, but its better when you don't have to. For a special occasion meal in Chicago, Ria has my unqualified and  most highly esteemed recommendation.",0.998,0.743,0.181,0.076,0.47984580498866203
2011-05-07,4.0,"NOTE: I was asked to give RIA another chance after a lukewarm first visit on 5/6/2011. I agreed, and went again last night (6/14/2011). I am editing my original review of 5/7/2011 to reflect both experiences as it would be unfair to create a review based solely on the ""make-up session"". Thus, this review represents my assessment of RIA overall based on the two meals. Short Version: The great service, relaxed atmosphere, understated but elegant decor, fairly simple menu, and fantastic sommelier Dan make me really WANT this restaurant to be a 5 star restaurant. And, I must say that this place is definitely better than Boka and Sepia and MUCH better than Sixteen. And based on the relatively better value and ease of actually booking a table, I would also put RIA above Alinea. However, I must still hold back that final star as overall, it's the food that gets this Foodie excited and the food still does not astound me.  Longer Version: Continuing on my Michelin star restaurant quest and admitting up front that this review is biased based on comparison to the other Michelin star restaurants at which I have dined.  See all reviews of the list here: yelp.com/list/michelin-s… Overall Verdict: I get why Michelin would give this place two stars. While I do not necessarily agree, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wishing to have a meal guaranteed to have great service, a comfortable environment, and good high quality food. This is where to go for anniversaries (instead of Alinea) and business meals (instead of Catch 35, Sixteen, or Boka). I would still prefer Takashi or Graham Elliott at the lower price point for most meals. Food: Very good but not great. Reminds me of Boka and Sepia, but my second experience was better than the first. Lukewarm food last time was hopefully a fluke as food this round was appropriately served warm. They still have lots of purées, mousses, and sauces. Not exceptionally flavorful.  The chef sends out an amuse bouche at the start of every meal. On my first visit there as a green blob in a small bowl, over which the server scooped out two globs of ""gin and tonic"" foam. Our entire table tried to be open-minded but it was just gross. #FAIL! But during my next visit, a halibut mouse with a flavorful green sauce was actually quite good. First Courses include sea scallops with turnips and flavorless octopus, with consistant quality during both meals. Others seem to enjoy Foie Gras ""It was ok. The wine with is was amazing"" and the duck egg dish that looked kind of like a soup. My second visit I tried the Squab with chaterelle mushrooms. That was quite good. Main courses include stuffed quail (cold and mildly slimey during my first meal), lobster (""best lobster ever""), and a lamb dish that was ""flavorful though unidentifiable"". Nothing was hot during my first visit, but the kitchen and server staff fixed that problem the 2nd round and everything was well prepared. I had the St. Pierre fish course which was AMAZING, and easily the best thing on the menu. Everyone at the table wanted what I had. The least impressed guest had Wild Striped Bass, which I admit bored me tremendously. Service: The serving staff is interesting. All incredibly friendly and attentive but with very different levels of understanding of the menu. Explaining a dish is more than simply reading the words on the menu.  The singing waiter was silent during my second visit. Honestly, he does have an AMAZING voice and the occasional Happy Birthday song would be welcomed. Dan the Somolier was fantastic both times and helped us perfectly pair wine with the meals. I want Dan to do a party at my home! He rocks! Decor: Beautiful, peaceful yet comfortable room. Decor was fantastic and you could have a conversation.  Value: So So. Similar to Boka in the value category. About $150 per person including tip. We had great wine, enough food to reduce my after eating to a few cookies and yogurt, and a few extras thrown in by the Chef. Bonus: Not pretentious at all. Dress is comfortable chic. Some had on jackets but the restaurant stresses they want guests to feel comfortable. Love this!!! Tasting menu (6 course) with wine is great for trying out the restaurant but pricey and this time we opted for a la carte. Tasting menu was $110/person for the food and an additional $75/person for the wine. Boka tasting menu is a better value. Given people at our table tried everything on the menu, we feel we had the Tasting Menu experience and can judge the restaurant fairly comprehensively. Between my two visits, I would say that the majority of the 8 total unique guests would come back to the restaurant. Everyone felt that it was very good though we still would not consider it one of our favorites. We would recommend people try it, however, and see for themselves. You will have a good meal, with great service and fantastic wine. And Dan.",0.9998,0.706,0.264,0.03,0.5350379266750945

My only complaint is that there lacked anything exciting or memorable. Courses became repetitive. Courses lacked diversity in texture, color, and flavor. Everything was a pate, had a foam, or was cooked in butter. It was like Groundhog's day. BF thought all the pates tasted like bologna, but loved the duck. We enjoyed ourselves.

At the end of the meal she asked, ""Can you think of anything that would have made this meal more perfect?"" Both of us chuckled a bit and agreed: It WAS perfect. The service was attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. There wasn't any needless checking on us - they were there precisely when we needed them but never when we were deep in conversation. The waitstaff and the sommelier were awesome. The atmosphere was understated but certainly elegant. The chairs were very comfortable and the lighting just right. There was plenty of space around each table and the noise level was never to high that we had to strain or lean in to have conversation. The food was to die for. Seriously. Starting with the amuse-bouche down to the last little dessert, each course and every bite delighted our taste-buds with flavor and texture. The presentation was also delightful and creative. What a FUN meal to eat!!! Favorites: Really hard to say, because there was nothing off or disappointing about any of the dishes. Nothing needless, and nothing but technical perfection, but here are some favorites: Our first course - scallops and octopus. WOW. The turbot and asparagus dish. WOWEE The veal. HOT DAMN!

2011-03-20,5.0,"Attention, Chicago foodies! RIA is now the best restaurant in the city. Having been open less than a year, RIA still continues to fly under many radars. But the early awed reviews were 100% correct: RIA delivers a perfect French-inspired new American meal, and will undoubtedly switch places with L20 in the next Michelin guide. We arrived early on a Saturday and decided on a tasting menu. Since I eat only fish, we asked if the chef would replace the meat and poulty selections with tasting portions of fish. No problem, we were told. ""No problem"" was the central theme of the meal -- I am very hard-pressed to find any flaws in the presentation, service, or food itself. I will not describe every course, but suffice to say each a muse bouche, course, intermezzo, house roll, and petit four tasted excellent and looked beautiful. The only misstep I can point to was the lobster, served with onions and chestnuts in a chestnut zabaglione. I found my lobster tail was slightly overcooked and simply not a top piece of fish, but I would note that this was not an item on the tasting menu and had been specially prepared. The scheduled tasting menu items were unimpeachable. I was most impressed with the service. Even as the dining room filled to capacity, our dishes were removed within a minute of finishing each course, and new silverware provided seconds later. Water glasses were always topped up between courses, which arrived in regular 8-10 minute intervals. No other fine dining establishment in the city has presented me with such flawless and unobtrusive service. The decor -- modern, yet still comfortable and inviting -- was also a treat. It is a marked contrast to the sterility of L20. A few reviewers have listed prices from 2010, but note that they have gone up since Ria got its stars. I fully expect a further bump as summer demand finally makes Ria as difficult a reservation as it ought to be. Get here soon, if you can.

Our dinner companions ordered the turbot for 2, which came with table-side plating (worth ordering for presentation alone.)  We also ha a few rounds of cocktails, mostly off menu classics.

The sommelier, Dan, was very helpful and allowed us to try out some wines before deciding on getting bottles or just the wine pairing.  Ultimately, we went with the individualized wine pairings because we wanted to vary our tastes and match the best wines with each course.  Dan was also very accommodating in allowing us to split some of our pours (parents can't drink much), so that was a great way for the parents to try out wines without being wasteful.  All of the wines were great - got to try some from all regions of the world, and Dan was great at explaining where the wines came from and how they were produced. All in all, this place was great.  Loved the chairs - very comfortable, but you were able to sit up right and enjoy eating.  A bit quiet, but not uncomfortably quiet.  Clientele is definitely a bit older.  Not a first date place (unless you're a baller), but a good place for a special occasion, or if you're just a foodie and want to start tackling the Michelin star rated restaurants!  My only complaint?  Perhaps larger portions, even for a tasting menu.",0.998,0.791,0.181,0.028,0.5545357470812017
2010-10-14,4.0,"Ria had been on my radar ever since I read Carol K's review months ago. I waited, waited and waited, and finally dined here with two beautiful ladies. It was exquisite and we had a positively lovely time.  Ria's dining room is super elegant with understated decor. There's no flash or shine here, but beautiful comfy chairs, muted colors, crisp linens, beautiful French china and Christofle flatware. It is luxurious, decadent and definitely put a smile on my face. Before we were seated, we had a few cocktails at Balsan. While the crowd and bar is much livelier next door, Ria provides a quiet atmosphere for intimate dining.  We were presented by a very handsome gentleman, Ria's pre-dinner Champagne cart. Before we knew it, we were sipping on vintage Champagne, being bubbly over the menu.  The bread service is.... dangerous. I promised myself I would be good, but ended up indulging on the beautiful Gruyere Puff Pastry, followed by the best French Baguette I have ever had. Ahh. Someone stop me.  For dinner, I started with the Yellow Fin Tuna, Cucumber, Potato and Caviar. The presentation was too beautiful to eat. The dish was light and fresh, and was a nice start to our meal.  For the main course, I had the whole Roasted Turbot, shared with the beautiful Brett D. The dish was served with Artichokes, Lemon and Black Truffle - a perfect combination that was hearty, but still very light and healthy. The Turbot was de-boned and served table side, which is just fun to watch.  Ria is a wonderful place for a special night out, romantic date night, a once in a while splurge or just a decadent GNO. I hope to be back to try the rest of the menu.",0.9986,0.673,0.303,0.024,0.5878690476190476
2010-10-01,3.0,"Let me start by saying that the food and the service was fantastic.  However, with Chicago quickly becoming a foodie/gastronomy mecca, that's just not enough anymore. Thanks to the sommelier's engaging history lessons on each particular bottle we sampled, I was far too drunk to remember the specifics of the food.  It was excellent, as I dimly recall, and expensive, which I vividly recall. The atmosphere was a snooze.  It was a geriatric crowd and I kept wanting to hang at the nearby bar that seemed to have a lot more energy.  For my money I'd hit Graham Elliot which has the best of both food and atmosphere that I've found anywhere in the city.",0.9097,0.826,0.135,0.04,0.6595238095238096
2010-09-27,5.0,"This meal will forever stay in my brain, not just because I got engaged right before we ate there, but because this place is truly outstanding. Amazing service, beautiful swanky atmospher, over the top delish food.  We did the 7 course tasting menu and it was out of this world, through in a cheese plate and a couple of amuses and you are in for an amazing ride. The wine pairings were super good, and big ole pours.  I am going to make a point to go back some time! One of my best Chicago meals ever!",0.9946,0.624,0.376,0.0,0.5797619047619048
2010-09-26,4.0,"A lovely birthday dinner at the picture-perfect Elysian. The atmosphere mid-week was very relaxed, though the restaurant became more crowded as the evening progressed. I started the meal with a glass of champagne, but oped not to try the tasting menu as I had work the next day and my experiences with the tasting menus at most restaurants could best be described as soporific or at worst as outtakes from a particularly overwrought (is there any other kind, one might ask?) Girls Gone Wild.  Even though I opted not to go with the tasting menu the server was very accommodating of my choice. He complemented each course with the perfect pour. The menu was eclectic in nature, with a definite bias in favor of seafood. For my first course I sampled the Mussels Veloute, Pasta, Orange, and Lovage. This paired perfectly with the Bernard Fouquet chenin blanc. The main course halibut I ordered is no longer on the menu, as Ria Restaurant has now moved to its fall seasonal tasting. This was excellent, but not as memorable as the mussels. For dessert I had the white chocolate and raspberry. I decided to forgo an espresso in favor of a nightcap--it was my birthday after all.  For detractors who say the food is minimal, both in terms of presentation and quantity, I contend that good things come in small packages. Highly recommended for special occasions.",0.9929,0.759,0.203,0.038,0.5414571428571429
2010-09-23,4.0,"So Gorgeous. Impressively Delicious. Impossibly Stylish. Super Underrated?  With only 7 Yelp reviews for this upscale, sophisticated, world class dining virtuoso that has been open almost a year this December, I can only assume Ria is either the best kept secret in fine dining or just really poorly marketed. Either way, this impeccably decorated and phenomenally tasty Global-meets-French-meets-Seafood wonder is truly a special night out delight to be experienced!  Housed in the ubermodern and trendy Elysian Hotel, Ria aptly mirrors its luxe contemporary homestead. Swathed in leather and silk in neutral tones of silver's, grey's and beige's, it's a monochromatic nirvana perfectly suited for capturing the essence of the well-heeled and tastefully dressed clientele it serves. Oh yes, dress to impress as dining at Ria can be most easily assimilated to a Tru/L20 hybrid... artsy, sleek, clean, expensive. If you don't believe me, let the pre-dinner champagne cart that comes gliding up to your table donning vintage selections of French bubbly speak for itself. Mmmm. Oui!  Extraordinary service certainly accompanies the above sexiness with an incredibly polished (and notably handsome) team of sommeliers, servers and quick moving water/bread/flatware attendants. Nothing goes for want here, not even a small request of an extra - and to die for - Gruyere Puff Pastry amuse. Gluttony? Don't mind if I do...  While the menu is surprisingly succinct with only 11 items total (not including a few extra special additions on the tasting menu) count on Ria to excel at executing each and every dish with a flawless level of completion. The delicate balance and remarkable flavor layering of my Yellow Fin Tuna, Cucumber, Potato and Caviar First Course was light, fresh, bright and set the tone for my meal beautifully. In addition to being plated like art, the buttery cut of Yellow Fin matched by a punchy, salty caviar kick was just perfect enough to push my decision toward another seafood selection for my Second Course as I was dying to see what Ria would do with a full main dish of Whole Roasted Turbot for Two accompanied by Artichokes, Lemon and Black Truffle. YUM! Fortunately, I had a dining companion willing to take the leap for the $45 p/p Turbot - you heard that right, it's a $90 entree - and shared this succulent, crispy, moist delight with me. Deboned right at the table with the scent of garlicky black truffle wafting around you, the whole Turbot is a sight to be seen and tastes just like you'd imagine mild, flaky perfection would! While priced a bit excessively, the portion certainly is generous and the quality is undeniably first-rate. The Stuffed Quail with Foie Gras and Squash, however, is also calling my name and a second Ria visit may be in my near future for something non-fish related. Care to join me?  Overall this was an impressive and excellent experience that failed to let me down in the slightest. Ideal for special occasions, date nights or just the once in awhile splurge, I'm highly recommending Ria to you, my fellow extravagant Yelpers. This leads me back to my original conundrum, though. Is Ria really underrated? Nah, evidently it's just exclusive and just how I like it!",0.999,0.756,0.226,0.018,0.5711275648470768
2010-07-06,5.0,My husband and I had a wonderful evening at Ria last Friday.  We had the tasting menu with the accompanying wine tasting.  Delicious!  Everything about the meal was perfect.  Our server was lovely and very friendly.  The rest of the staff were also friendly.  The dishes were very pretty and well thought out.  The wines perfectly complemented each dish.  I thought the desserts were the best part of the meal.  It's quite pricey and definitely falls in the special occasion place.  I can't wait to go back!,0.992,0.626,0.374,0.0,0.6413919413919414
2010-04-19,1.0,"Wow, not impressed at all.  The service is exceptional, the ambiance is alright (kind of boring), the food was cold.  In a fine dining restaurant that charges what Ria charges, cold food is completely unacceptable.",-0.35,0.605,0.17,0.225,0.8666666666666667
2010-04-15,5.0,A great hidden spot for formal (but not stuffy) dining.  The setting is beautiful and calm.  Polished service.  Tasting menu (6 courses if I recall correctly) was a good deal at $87/person. I recommend it highly for special occasions.,0.9564,0.608,0.392,0.0,0.6492517006802722
2010-02-25,4.0,"Fancy.  Very fancy.  Ria, the high end restaurant in the Elysian Hotel is a treat for all senses. On the walls, the shimmering silk reminds you of glistening ripples of green water.  The silver leather upholstered chairs beckon you to sit and linger.  The wall art, depicting a school of fish (I think) is mimicked on the back of the menu.  And the table itself is set with only the best.  Beautiful china and high end, french made, Christofle flatware (worth a visit alone just to see flatware like this . . . oh a girl can dream of the day when she might have it for her own) The experience begins with a menu of apertifs.  We chose a lovely bubbling wine that was not too dry, not too sweet.  The champagne flutes glistened in the down lighting adding imagery to the table. A complimentary amuse bouche was sent to the table; fois gras nestled in a macaron seated on a dollop of fruit puree with hazelnut shavings.  Delicious! No matter what the caliber of restaurant, I like to share so that we can taste a range of items on the menu.  Ria was no different.  Our server was outstanding recommending her favorites and taking into account all our dietary needs and then working to make sure that even split- they were plated correctly. To begin with we split two of the first courses- the lobster with caviar and blood orange sauce and a ""cookie"" with apples that also came with some greens.  Portion sizes are tiny so sharing two meant a couple of bites each- and even though I couldn't have the sauce that went over the lobster- it along with the cavier on the plate was the big winner. The menu is seafood heavy (of the 6 entrees offered- 3 are fish)  Our server explained it is all about how ""land and sea meet"" so there are juxtapositions on the menu that you may not find other places- sturgeon with pork belly, for example.  We created our own combination by ordering a fish (Pierre?  Never heard of it but it was tasty and mild) and combined it with the dry aged ribeye.  The kitchen split the food up for us in the kitchen so it was beautifully presented when it arrived at the table.  Both were then ""sauced"" at the table- one with a light fish reduction and the other with a bone marrow sauce. Finally, dessert.  They like to bring out a cheese cart between dinner and dessert but we took a pass on that and moved right on to dessert.  I ordered something with apples a number of ways (candied, poached) with praline ice cream and my friend went with the cherry topped cake.  Small portions but just the right amount. In terms of service, as I said our server was outstanding.  Patient, friendly, with no request ruffling her.  She knew plenty, not only about the restuarant, but about the interior designers, the artwork, etc.  She even took my request for take out at Balsan (the mid scale restaurant) all in stride and made sure my order was ready when I wanted to leave. Ria is the high end restaurant so be prepared to pay a pretty penny for all of the niceities.  Dinner for two with a couple of drinks was about $240.  Know that an 18% tip is included in everything and the staff says it's for the guest's convenience.  I tried to tip our server for my coat check and she said that it wasn't necessary.   Also know that if you drive- give your valet ticket to your server and they will put it on the bill (but it does include a 18% gratuity at that point).  It actually ended up being cheaper than the last time I was there as they lowered the valet price.  Now it is $18 plus the 18% ($21) versus the $23 it was previously. Where Ria lacked a little for me was in management.  Usually in a restaurant of this caliber, the manager or the chef comes out and greets you or at least makes you feel like your visit is special.  There were only four tables with people at them on the night I was there so there were plenty of opportunities for someone to welcome us, but no one did.  Even my dining companion commented on it.  I think it was a big miss for them as even at the mid scale restaurant in the hotel I had a chance to talk to management throughout my visit. So if you want to go and see how the ""other half"" lives, check out Ria.  As you chair is pulled out and the crisp linen draped across your lap,  you may just catch a reflection of your face in the pristine white china.  And if you wonder who that lucky person is, reflected back at you, remember that it is just you. . . .about to experience a wonderful evening out.  And then just smile.",0.9977,0.86,0.119,0.02,0.5209040178571429
2010-01-04,5.0,"This hot little restaurant in the Elysian Hotel is sure to be a hit with Chicago diners. Wow. I had a great dinner here -- I can't believe no one's reviewed it yet. Came with a group of colleagues for a dinner. The focus is on seafood and everything  I had was fresh, flavorful and unique.   To start I had the eel -- incredible.  My main course was the Turbot.  Pair that with 2 wonderful glasses of wine and I was stuffed.  Great food.  Pricey -- but worth it.  And the hotel is impeccable.   I'll be back -- maybe for my 30th!",0.9222,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.6658730158730158
