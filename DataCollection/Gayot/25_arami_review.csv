Once we found it and stepped in, we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant itself was bigger than I had anticipated.  It's an open space with great lighting.  I loved that this restaurant had a diverse mix of people. The cocktails were great.  I especially loved the Scarborough Fair.  Cinnamon clove syrup, lemon, thyme infused vodka, rosemary, asian pear....refreshing and delicious.   The mushrooms and beet salad was good to start.  I'm not well versed with sushi but I love to eat it.  I had a specialty roll with spicy king crab and shrimp.  It was delicious. I went there really wanting this dish that I saw on their social media photos: thinly sliced salmon with some kind of dipping sauce but it was not on the menu. Instead I had the spicy sake, simple but good. Mushroom was our theme for the night and we ordered Japanese mushrooms that were charred so nicely. Arami also has some great vegetarian options, which was good for my husband (the non-raw fish eater). He also had the wagyu beef. It was very flavorful but maybe a bit too raw for his liking).   My favorite thing was dessert: black sesame shortbread and vanilla miso toffee ice cream, OH MY.  Our big mistake was sharing this.  I wanted the whole thing.  It was very unique, not rich, with a perfectly balanced flavor. Arami was pricey but definitely worth it. We saw some ramen being delivered to a table on our way out.  We will be back to check that out.

The uni nigiri was good and it came with freshly grated wasabi. The tori karaage was a large portion and the pickled peppers were a nice touch. The shishito robata tasted like what I expected and I always like katsuobushi on anything. Our maki rolls were good, but a little small. Again, the food was fine, however, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here since I already have a great sushi place with slightly better prices.

I got the sashimi chef's choice which was comprised of seven selections from the menus.  What I got was a robust selection of the standard white fish fare you find at any Chicago sushi bar - Tai, Hirame and Suzuki - masquerading as exotic offerings.  And the price tag was knock your socks off high.  But not only that, one of the pieces was clearly frozen and was mush when I ate it.  The bulk of the rest of the platter had that dry look and flat taste of fish that's past it's prime.",0.7184,0.952,0.048,0.0,0.4396047008547008
2017-04-22,5.0,"Hands down, one of the best and most memorable meal I've had in my life. We were highly recommended by a friend about Arami before we traveled down to Chicago. So we made a reservation for our last dinner night in Chicago and boy, it was the best decision to end our trip with this dinner. The atmosphere is nice and chill. Nothing pretentious, just a good neighborhood spot. Upon arrival, we realized they needed 48 hours advanced notice for Omakase. Shoot!!  However, our server prompted us that we could still do it, but nothing off the menu. Perfect!! That's what we wanted anyway, the highlights, narrated by the chef. It was $120 per person and worthy of every penny. I won't go into detail of we had because that's the charm of Omakase. This is a place for experienced diners. I hate to use the term ""foodie."" However, you should better be one to understand to depth of their food. Every bite tells a story, uniquely from one to another. A lot of restraint to make certain flavor and texture pops out. A lot of unexpected surprises.  Sushi should always be this good. Perfectly cut that it melts away in your mouth. Best bite: Japanese Waygu with uni butter and sea salt. It's by far the best piece of steak I ever had. It melts in your mouth literally. The flavor is so rich that you don't need a big slap like one in those steakhouses. We each had two tiny pieces and we just melted off the table. We've had Waygu at a few American chef-driven steakhouses, but nothing can compare to it. Japanese do know their steak. Service was excellent. Food came out when it should and plates were cleared when it should.  Bottom line: if you dip sushi in soy sauce, think about the price tag that comes with it. If you understand the poetry of food, it's a steal.  Tip: order Omakase, and go down the rabbit hole. It's an amazing journey.",0.9965,0.76,0.201,0.039,0.5684217687074831

Unfortunately we never got around to ordering more, because the quality was just not all that impressive.  We got the botan ebi sashimi, regular saki sashimi, and uni nigiri. The shrimp looked a bit too opaque. Salmon was fine. Uni was good. Overall the food was pretty fresh, but for the price and portion, I expected to taste the ocean breeze if you know what I mean. The specialty rolls were good but nothing spectacular. We got the Trio Maki and the Hamachi Sake Zuke Maguro. The chili oil on the Trio Maki was a bit too overpowering, but other than that, a good roll. I did appreciate the fish/rice ratio.  I think for good sushi, I will just stick to Kai Zan from now on.

We got a little something from every part of the menu, including some amazing soft shell crab sushi, the chicken meatball on a stick (which was incredibly salty but flavorful), some whitefish nigiri which was tender and like butter and a few other dishes throughout the menu. The sushi comes in multiple pieces and oh, so good. The other dishes though are tiny. Like a bite per person and you're paying $6 to $9 per each one. Damn.

I don't know what kinds of differences this makes for in dining experience; I can only state what I noticed. The chef exchanged no more than a handful of words with us for the half hour or so that we were there. The prices for sushi were marked per piece, which I can't say I've ever seen before. With that said, we were surprised when the bill came, but since we decided to leave after a few orders of mediocre fish (the size of which could not have been much bigger than my thumb), it did not cost us more than it could have. Lastly, the delivery of the food was super awkward. The chef would prepare the order, have a server come to the side of the bar, give it to him, and then without taking another step, the server would hand it to us. The chef could have very easily just saved us participation in this redundant relay by handing the dishes over the bar like is normally done.

We were moved to the sushi bar which wasn't bad. They're always packed so we never get to sit at the bar when dining out, so it was a cool experience to watch the sushi prep!

They produce truly good quality food and their culinary skills really shine through their food. These chefs are definitely professionals who take pride in their menu. I can't stress enough how delicious every single plate was that we've tried. We've tried multiple rolls, the miso soup, Arami ramen, toasted tea, mushroom risotto, gelato, spring roll wraps, and duck Brussel sprouts and licked the plates clean off each one. The duck Brussel sprouts are our favorite...GET IT!  All in all we both love Arami and am so happy to have found our new go-to spot!",0.9986,0.71,0.29,0.0,0.5314869473960382
2016-11-26,4.0,Sushi is outstanding!! Well worth the price even though the portions are crazy small. I will never order takeout from here again. The miso soup looked like a smaller serving than what they might actually serve you if you dined in. They should buy cups that fit the amount of soup they serve for takeout so it doesn't look so suspicious. The picture I uploaded is of the soup they gave me with my takeout order before I even took a sip. I was confused. Did someone eat my soup? Did they not have enough to serve?

2016-11-16,4.0,"I have seen awesome reviews for this place and due to the fact that I am a sushi addict, it was only right for me to come and check it out. When I walked in I instantly liked the place as they have a bar in the front that carries one of my favorite beverages...Yamazaki 12 year Single Malt Scotch...good stuff for those of you that have yet to try. The place itself isn't that big so its probably a good idea to set a reservation here! There is a wait space when you walk in (bar area I mentioned) but not so big, so again, set the reservation lol. The place is well lit and has exposed brick which makes for a nice sushi eating setting.  Once seated we decided to go with a drink and I decided to go something I have never tried before; The Shochu Satoh which was 60% sweet potato and 40% rice. Very smooth and went down nice...definitely good for sipping. For food we started out with the Hamachi Truffle which was pretty good and equally awesome was the Zuke Maguro Kani which is spicy alaskan king crab wrapped with marinated tuna...2 amazing starters to say the least. We then decided on 2 very good rolls...Trio Maki & Spicy Tako Sake.  The Trio Maki included yellowtail, tuna, salmon, spicy mayo, masago, cilantro, avocado, chili oil, lime. The Spicy Tako Sake included spicy octopus, salmon, oshinko, avocado, wasabi mayo, seaweed salad. Both were very good but I have to say Spicy Tako Sake was a bit better as I love a bit of spice with the sushi. Our server Ryan was a god guy but had to be the bearer of bad news at times as I guess they had some sort of kitchen incident that caused them to close down for a couple weeks therefore they weren't able to prepare certain cooked dishes that my dining companion was interested in.

But waiting for 30 minutes with no one coming to take our order, never mind sharing any insights about the menu, I think not. Maybe the Bib Gourmand was not an honor this restaurant expected to receive and they were not adequately prepared for the overwhelming support. However, on our way out we did see 3-4 waiters congregated by the hostess stand so the issue may be bigger. All of them wished us a good night, which I thought was very cordial.

I've been putting off making an account for 2 years and finally decided to make one so nobody else ends up paying 80 dollars here for a total of 5oz of fish (disgracefully dispersed among almost 10 pieces of sushi). Note: I am in no way a penny pincher when it comes to sushi. First let's start with the fish since who really cares about the service if the food is good. The nigiri sushi pieces were almost as small as my big toenail. Unlike every other sushi restaurant on this planet, their menu is priced per single piece, not 2 pieces. The hand rolls I ordered were 80% rice 20% fish. With the sizes of their nigiri, it's unbelievable they charge an upwards of 6 dollars for EACH piece. In addition, those almost all rice hand rolls I ordered were 8 dollars a pop. Maybe there were some 24k gold flakes in there that I didn't see. I also paid 17 dollars for a tako cut roll that had such a thin sliver of octopus in it that all I could taste was mayo and cucumber. The octopus in the roll was thinner than the diameter of an earthworm. We also sat at the bar which usually allows you to connect with the chef and order directly as well. We exchanged a total of 4 words with the Chef. Not to mention he would make our orders as we sat right in front of him, he would then pass it to a server who would walk around and bring it to us. Totally unnecessary and should have just served us directly like a normal chef.

The restaurant is very, very nondescript from the outside. We passed the place before we realized we were at the right location. The interior has a nice ambience with sectioned off rooms opening into a larger dining area. The dining area was large enough that it was comfortable to talk but still allowed for intimacy for your table partners.  The food was small portioned which goes with a more Japanese style of service. We got the tonkatsu donburi in addition to a maki and a few sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and flavorful. And the tonkatsu donburi or pork cutlets over rice were served with thinly sliced pickles. A very Japanese thing to do which I honestly have not seen in any American Japaense restaurant (outside of Mitsuwa). The pickles tasted sweet and homemade. The cutlets were crisp on the outside but a tad chewy on the inside. Overall the meal was pretty good, but as an American I really wish I could've gotten more bang for my buck. That being said the sashimi and maki that we tried were well made with good quality products (rice, seaweed, fish). I was really happy about that since a lot of places sacrifice one for the other and I could taste that they were using fairly good quality rice which says a lot. Another thing, is I heard another customer complaining about there not being a California roll on the menu.

The menu is beautiful, on a wood board and laminated.  (no dirty spilled on, not sure what is reads underneath the shoyu mess lol)  It is separated into sections such as bite size delectables, ramen, grilled items, veggie items, nigiri and sashimi, rolls.  The Japanese cheesecake factory menu. lol  My server is illustrative and thorough with menu descriptions and it is sectioned well.   I start with the toro tartare bite.  Minced fatty bluefin tuna, asian pear, chive, caviar, house special soy sauce.  Each $5 serving comes in a one bite spoon, with a little heaping of the minced tartare.  Creamy and delicately minced raw fish in an attractive presentation.   Second bite served is the Buta Hara (Berkshire Pork Belly).  Served with a gochujang sauce.  Gochujang is a daily used condiment in Korea.  It is a savory, spicy, and pungent mix of rice, salt, fermented soybeans, and chili.  It complements the berkshire pork belly, and I'm going to use Anthony Bourdains' word ""unctuous"" (umami, rich, heavily braised, or porky).  This is the highest quality of pork you can find.  It's sweet, has a rich flavor, delicate texture and an unbelievable level of juiciness on a skewer accompanied by fresh ginger and carrot shreds.   Third bite, two pieces of Kabocha nigiri.  ($4) Two grilled pieces of this sweeter than pumpkin squash with rice wrapped in nori with Saikyo miso (slight hint of sweetness), white soy, honey, almonds.  Delightful.   Lastly, for $17 an ample sized beautifully crafted Kampachi Zuke Maguro roll.  Amberjack, tuna, takuan, asparagus, king oyster mushroom, black tobiko, truffle oil.  Succulent and juicy fish with the crunch of the vegetables and tobiko, the tuna so tender and flavorful.  Definitely worth the price. Of course you must try the kochi for dessert.  I'm unaware if it's made in house, but these resembles Bubbie's (in Hawaii where I used to live).  Red velvet (tastes very similar to the cake flavor with a touch of cocoa), blueberry, green tea, and mint chocolate chip (my least fave).  Chewy and sweet outside, not too gummy.  A nice course to finish with.   I'm only not giving this 5 stars because my server disappeared towards the end of the meal, causing me to track her down via busboy, 20 min later she reappeared...  luckily before my meter ran out!",0.9976,0.799,0.166,0.034,0.464355006105006

After the omakase, you do have the option to reorder any pieces you really enjoyed which is not an easy task as it would be nearly impossible to pick favorites amongst such a stellar assortment and journey of flavors.

2015-10-18,2.0,"Is Arami the best sushi in Chicago? Maybe, definitely possible. Nonetheless, ""best sushi in Chicago"" might be comparable to being the best steakhouse in India. As someone who lives on the west coast and has recently visited Japan, Arami simply does not measure up, especially at this price range. It suffers from the same disadvantage as any midwest seafood restaurant: Chicago is simply too far away from the ocean. A sushi restaurant of Arami's caliber needs to get its fish flown in from suppliers, which naturally drives up the price. And it shows; I personally didn't have any issues with Arami's fish quality. However, the nigiri was just very boring. Maybe it was because I didn't go with omakase, but the nigiri in the chef's choice platter was incredibly bland, especially given the price. It wasn't really an issue with the fish; it wasn't the best I've had quality wise, but certainly not bad. However, there is (what I think is) a common misconception with regards to (edomae) sushi. Sushi is not just about reeling a fish out of the water, slicing it up, and serving. Most of the fish used in sushi undergoes some sort of processing/seasoning. Sushi is about bringing out the subtle flavors of the fish, using various seasonings and preparation techniques to do so. The nigiri I had at Arami just did not reflect this at all (with the exception of the aji). Regarding their maki, I'm personally not a huge maki person. The maki I had here was okay in terms of flavor, decent fish with solid seasoning. However, the portions were humorously small. Again, as someone used to west coast sushi quality and pricing, Arami just can't stack up. $8 for 6 pieces of a basic maguro maki seems absurd to me. The $15-20 range that they charge for deluxe maki is roughly commensurate with most decent places in the US, but the quantity is again, humorously small. I personally did not order any hot food, but the friends I were with said that their hot dishes were quite good. They thought that the ramen was reasonably priced and tasty and that the robata was a little on the high side price wise, but also well done. Drinks were very good, fairly original, and well priced. Service was solid, nothing exceptionally good or bad. Overall, it was a decent experience, and if you're just looking at sushi places in Chicago, without any considerations for price, I would recommend it. The pricing critique isn't entirely fair, given the logistical difficulties of getting fresh fish thousands of miles inland. I would certainly consider coming back for omakase to give a more accurate evaluation of their sushi. However, for now, Arami is sushi restaurant with only okay sushi.",0.9973,0.803,0.17,0.027,0.5619612590799034

2015-10-12,5.0,"Title:  How Have We Missed Arami? That is a rhetorical question.  How would you know?  Missing even great quality restaurants in a food city like Chicago can happen.  Sometimes you just don't get around to it.  Sometimes attempting to find truly high quality sushi in Midwestern cities (yes, even cities as great as Chicago) results in returning to old favorites before trying to make new ones.  However, I feel that we have really missed out by not trying Arami before now.  Therefore I will make an attempt at a mea culpa by writing this praise filled review. Arami may well now be our favorite sushi restaurant in town.  The setting and atmosphere is casual cool with a comfortable and mildly artistic Zen flair.  The food and drink are AWESOME! The fish is clearly of the highest quality and selected by people with knowledge.  Herein I actually mean the fish; not the fish hidden in some creatively flavored roll.  (I know, EVERYBODY says that because everybody fancies him/her self a fish flavor connoisseur...though the few rolls that we tried at Arami were pretty amazing too!).  The specials of the night were all remarkable, worthy of second rounds (which we indulged).  We tried them all (hint to the uninitiated:  try the special fish because they are sure to be the freshest of the fresh since the chef has gone out of her/his way to serve them).  They offered a fatty hamachi (toro hamachi?) that was among the best cuts that we have ever tried as well as both Japanese and California uni (mmmm...a horizontal tasting of my favorite nigiri!).  However, even the tried-and-true (e.g., maguro akami, sake, hamachi) were special. While we often do not want to ""waste"" space on other parts of the menu on a sushi night, we felt obliged to try some of the other categories since this was our first time at Arami and they were pretty darned well reviewed in these areas too.  All the items that we tried from the zensai and robata sections were amazing (and, in many cases, almost too pretty to eat!).  In particular I want to site the uni shooter (as much as I cannot believe that I am typing that sentence).  This unassuming, common excuse to hide borderline uni was a truly special dish at Arami.  The first round was provided complimentary to us (yes, I said FIRST round) because of our glutton-like demonstration of love for uni.  However, it was so good that we, of our own volition, purchased two more rounds of the dish!  Unprecedented use of limited, albeit considerable, stomach space! The drink menu was also truly special.  Herein I refer to the sake list.  The rest looked fine and creative too but sake is our first love!  We have tried sake from NYC to San Fran to Honolulu to Tokyo.  We have replaced open luggage space taken up by American whiskey heading to Japan as gifts for colleagues with as much Japanese bought sake as we could legally carry through Customs coming back.  Arami has the best sake selection of truly special sakes that we have found in town.  More importantly, Armai has at least one server who is amazingly knowledgeable with regards to sake:  Lisa. Lisa completes our abbreviated list of things that are special at Arami.  She made the experience truly exceptional with her respectful but enthusiastic professionalism in service, recommendations, and downright enjoyable personality.  In her words she is a ""sake geek"" but I would prefer to simply call her a professional.  She was the exclamation mark on what was already an exalted evening.  We needed this night, we needed Lisa, and we need Arami!  It was perfection!",0.9986,0.789,0.19,0.02,0.543118822150072

2015-09-04,4.0,"Uni lovers, rejoice! The uni shooter is an absolute must get. The cucumber with wasabi tobiko and soy along with the fresh uni is a morsel made in uni heaven. I got the Santa Barbara uni as part of my sashimi dinner as well and it was absolutely fresh and buttery. The wagyu beef robata - we were very happy with the flavors but the texture was a little too chewy for our liking. The husband got the kampachi sake maki roll and liked it. He eats less in general but its worth pointing out that the roll was a little slimmer and smaller than what we are used to. An average person with an average appetite would need at least two or more rolls. I decided to get a bunch of sashimi for dinner. I got  1 kampachi, 2 Alaskan king salmon, 2 Hamachi and 1 uni. Note that one order of the salmon is just one piece, so if you want 2, that is two orders = $12 (more on pricing later). We finished with mochi ice-cream - which is another must get. Out of the three (strawberry & chocolate, green tea, tiramisu), the tiramisu was my favorite followed by green tea. So before I dive into the price point part, I just want to say that the food at this restaurant is impeccable. The ambiance is very comfy, you enter through a very unassuming entry way, followed by a waiting/foyer type bar area but in the back they have this nice and cozy room with exposed bricks and all and a very cute patio. Our Server was also very attentive and food came out as it was prepared. About the price point - people here on yelp are absolutely right when they say the portions are small and for the portions the price is high. The night we went, we were not particularly hungry, but on any other day, we would have gotten at least a couple of more things, putting us in the more than $70 per person range. My husband got a beer but I did not get a drink that night. Also, for sashimi - you are getting one piece per order, I am used to seeing at least two pieces per order, just something to know when ordering. This is definitely higher $ wise on the bib gourmand list.

We had to wait to be seated and she provided us with small talk while we waited.  At the time, the only seats they had available were at the sushi bar which was well worth it. Again, immediately greeted by the chefs behind the bar and the chemistry between the chefs made for a delightful atmosphere.  It can be difficult walking into a japanese restaurant, especially when most of the foods and drinks are so foreign and you don't have much experience pronouncing the names. Our server, Christina, was very helpful in this endeavor and informative when it came to the different sakes on menu, which neither I nor my girlfriend know anything about. We ended up with a very tasty dry sake that fit very well with the robata and maki rolls we ordered.  The serving sizes can be a bit on the small side, so it's important to savor.

We also had a few cocktails and they were well made. The space is pretty cool. Its got a chill vibe. Like a spa. The cons are the front of house. There's a little bit of an attitude when you walk in. I don't understand why they won't seat you until your one other person shows up when you have a reservation. The table is there just sitting empty. Meanwhile I could be racking up the bill having a cocktail. So I waited at the bar. The bartender seemed nice however he didn't ask if I wanted a drink until after 10 mins of waiting when I saw my friend drive by. There isn't a sign. In fact it looks closed down from the outside. I thought I had passed it by so I was getting out my phone to check the address when I saw movement inside. They should reconsider being mysterious. The last con is the price. It is on the expensive side although it is super fresh.  Given the huge number of choices in Chicago I don't think I'll become a frequent diner here. I do want to go back to give it another chance.

What kind of broth is that?? Service was great however. If you're going to charge top dollar at least provide your customers with good healthy cuts of fish...yikes.

2015-06-09,3.0,"Okay so I was super excited to try this place as it had been on my bookmarked list for quite some time now and I'm sorry although I had these high expectations, most of them were not met. First off, the place is cute, more on the casual side for being upscale and definitely pricey sushi. So I didn't see that much charm and the tables were very close to one another so I wouldn't suggest it for an intimate first date. But if you're looking to come here with friends and you're not on any sort of budget, then by all means. Also let's mention a positive-the service. Everything was brought out super fast and our server was very nice and was very quick to give us some suggestions since it was our very first time. So they get a star for really good and attentive service. They also get two more stars for this one special two piece concoction and for $11 for just two TINY pieces, I would still say it's worth it. It's the ZUKE SAKE HOTATE which is spicy Hokkaido scallop wrapped with marinated salmon and a taro chip on top. It was probably one of the freshest, most delicious and amazing sushi pieces ever that I split with my husband. I literally wanted to get 10 more of them but that wasn't in our budget. We got a plethora of rolls from a few special rolls to some simple spicy salmons and shrimp tempura as well as some pieces just to get a variety of their fish. I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. Let's start with the basics, the spicy salmon roll was also tiny and had very little fish to rice ratio, all I really tasted was spicy mayo. Same concept with the shrimp tempura roll, tiny and not that tasty. I was having much more hope for the special rolls and for $17 per roll, I would hope that they would be better. Not so much. They had more pieces but the flavor and fish quantity just wasn't there. This is supposed to be Arami for goodness sake, not some average hole in the wall. I mean I felt like I spent a LOT of money here and hated every single roll that we got. All had more fillers than fish and even with that, they just lacked flavor. Once again, the true savior was that zuke sake hotate, you should absolutely order like 5 orders of those and spend $55 for 10 pieces of sushi as well as the individual pieces weren't bad but also $4-$5 per piece.  When I go for sushi, I want a true good combination of pieces and rolls and the rolls ALL disappointed and I left with a huge overrated feeling of this place. I really don't have a motivation to come back besides the zuke sake which I loved.",0.9964,0.786,0.178,0.036,0.5342044595616023

2015-05-29,5.0,"We got our reservation through the app Reserve and was able to request an Omakase for our dinner tonight! We were served a total of 7 courses which I asked to have their fresh fish as the star of the meal, and they did not disappoint!  Course 1: Eastern Oysters (3.5/5) Average briny oyster that was good but not worth the price. Would probably skip on this Course 2: Salmon Cerviche (4/5) Flavorful and melt in your mouth salmon with sweet potato chips, jalepenos, and salmon roe Course 3: Sashimi Platter (5/5) All the fish was super fresh (Korean fluke, fatty tuna, salmon) but the fish that took the crown is the New Zealand King Salmon - MUST GET! Course 4: Nigiri Platter (5/5) Again, all the fish is amazing, buttery, and smooth (one of the best in Chicago) Course 5: ZUKE MAGURO GANI (3.5/5) Warm spicy king crab over tuna wrapped sushi. Good but probably would not order again because of price. But still good overall Course 6: Octopus with Sweet Potato Puree (Gril; 5/5) Beautifully seasoned octopus that was grilled to perfection. It paired so nicely with the smooth, sweet potato puree. Would definitely eat this again! Course 7: Sliced Duck Breast with Pork Belly/Potato Hash over a Sweet Potato Puree (6/5) So so so delicious. Duck was cooked perfectly with just enough chew but never rubbery. The hash was tasty and the puree helped with the salty-ness of the dish.  Dessert: Kiwi sorbet w/Korean melon AND Black Sesame Ice cream (5/5) We added dessert to our meal since it wasn't included in the Omakase. The Kiwi sorbet was wonderful though the portion was a bit small compared to the Black Sesame ice cream. the sorbet was tart and was more flavorful than expected. It paired well with the cool melon. The Black Sesame ice cream was more milky and creamy than the other ones I've had before. It had a hint of sesame to it, rather than being the absolute star of the ice cream. If you like a more light and creamy black sesame ice cream , then this is for you!

The maitake robata was delicious and the sauces were fun to try.  The ramen was very good even with soba noodles.  The toddler inhaled those noodles, even with the spices.

Unfortunately, the sushi rice was hard, overly salty, lacked acidity and crumbled into bits when picked up.

The mochi is good and the salmon is worth having. Although at 8 dollars for 2 (nigiri) very small pieces, be ready to purchase 4.  Service - Good. Fast service however a major issue I have is the dishonest nature around the service of soda. Even though they have a soda gun, and I had sake, but I asked to be refilled several times on diet soda only to learn on the bill I was charged 2 dollars/drink. Between my fiancé and I that accounted for 20 dollars on the bill!

This was part of the ramen quest at the end. after hearing so much about Arami and seeing it listed as place to grab a decent bowl of ramen, we had to test it.  Arami is not a ramen place firstly. This is a trendy/modern sushi and Japanese place. Menu items overlap with their sister store Ani (which seemed to have a more enticing list of ramen). The maki list here isn't too expansive but the specialty rolls seem to be more thoughtfully put together with a higher price point.  We ordered:   -KAMPACHI SAKE: super fresh and refreshing roll :).  -Hamachi crudo: there was an odd flavor. fish was perfect but overpowered with the other accompaniments. -Arami Ramen: it is less traditional and a more ""refined"" soy based bowl. the noodles are more wavy than Strings. besides the egg, the toppings were smallish. the pork belly looked more ""candied"" - still tasty. it wasn't a lot of meat. I didn't like the pickles and I don't recall seeing braised beef..it was probably the small portion of strings that came with thin mushrooms. for the price point, I expected more complex flavors/toppings. it just wasn't a hearty bowl to satiate hunger.  Otherwise, the food had a clean feeling. They don't have random maki rolls that toss in bunch of ingredients that almost sounds/tastes the same.  after this, I think Wasabi is still the go-to place for ramen and Strings is officially better than Arami.",0.9683,0.866,0.104,0.03,0.48978494623655916

2015-01-30,3.0,"Coming from San Francisco, it's not really fair of me to be judging the sushi in Chicago. But for what I've had so far in chicago, Arami is a good choice if you're craving Japanese.  I probably would hone in more on the more izakaya dishes rather than the nigiri/sashimi. We had a few of the specials for the night but none were SUPER memorable. Though lance did particularly like the king salmon nigiri. Other dishes we had besides nigiri:  - japanese mushrooms: sort of like a stir fry of various types of mushroom. it was a tad on the salty side, though that didn't stop lance from eating it all.. - gyu robata: lance said the beef was a little too tough for his liking - ajii kama: so the special of the night actually offers various options of kama but our waittress suggested the mackerel. it was really good! perfectly cooked and flavored. this was probably one of my favorite dishes here - arami ramen: the broth surprisingly wasn't too traditional of a broth but rather, a bit lighter in flavor. the noodles were pretty decently cooked. it's a good ender dish for the night if you're not full Overall, it's a decent and very modern styled japanese restaurant that's worth a visit if you're in that area. It can also get pretty busy so I'd suggest making reservations before you head there.

It's practically a health hazard. The special maki rolls were also small and nothing special really. Nothing special at all. In fact I can't really recall what I got.

2014-06-26,5.0,"The entrance to Arami is unassuming and provides a bit of mystery, having no proper sign and featuring a large cloth scroll bearing the restaurant's name in a window display not unlike a retail store. Inside, the details are understated and carefully executed. A few tables occupy the front room, but appear to go unused unless at capacity. Midway through is the host, who will guide you to the proper dining room in the back.  My friend and I had what would have been a lovely, romantic dinner for two ... were we not both straight males. Being a reasonably busy Saturday night, even our two-top at the sushi bar required a reservation. We first perused a unique cocktail list full of interesting takes on classics like the sazerac, the moscow mule and the old fashioned featuring ingredients like oolong and shochu. They could accurately be called Asian fusion cocktails. I ultimately opted for the sazerac, which did not disappoint. It was served with no ice in a chilled glass, which had the effect of making the drink look smaller, but watered down drinks are a big pet peeve and I was happy for the different approach. When it came time to order food, we knew we had to get a round of uni shooters, having sifted through a good sample of previous reviews.We ordered a hotate from the specials menu, along with a ramen each: me the tonkotsu, he the arami. While we both agreed this meal was way above par, the uni shooters definitely stole the show. The presentation (see picture) was brilliant, and the contrast of flavors was unlike anything I've tried before. The bang for your buck makes these a bit cost prohibitive because, at $6 each, they are simply gone too fast. If not for this, I would have ordered two more. As it stands, I urge you not to pass up ordering one.  The hotate included slices of scallops prepared like sashimi and did not disappoint, but were I on a tighter budget, this would be the dish to get cut. My ramen, on the other hand, was delightful, even though the printed menu did not mention that it was served chilled, which would have been nice to know up front. The benishoga and other toppings all provided interesting contrast in texture and flavor to the broth and noodles. All told, this was probably the best meal I've had since my visit to Longman & Eagle during my last trip to Chicago.

Reservations are definitely recommended. It was our first time in. We ordered the sashimi and nigri chef combination to start.  There was salmon, hamachi, tuna and two other fishes on the plate.  They were all delicious.  You can tell that they are getting their fish in daily because it tasted so fresh.  We also ordered the spicy tuna and spicy salmon maki rolls.  They were both really good with a right amount of zip.  Lastly we ordered two of their daily specials.  The one dish had only one piece each but had  spicy crab and shrimp that was amazing and one of the best things I ate.  The other special had octopus and was really good too. My only complaint is that the pieces were small for the special price.  I was set on only eating seafood but my husband wanted to try the robata so we tried the wagu beef on the robtata grill.  It was cooked well, but I was expecting more seasoning.  Had we known, we could have pre-ordered a whole fish!  Service was pretty good, but sometimes slow.  That being said, we were in no rush. The portions are definitely on the smaller side, but it some of the fresher fish in Chicago.  It is on the more expensive side.  If you have an appetite, it can run $100 a person or more depending on the beverages.  While it is not a weekly sushi/seafood spot, it is good for a special dinner or occasion.",0.997,0.776,0.208,0.016,0.5320512820512822

Our server was very good and she recommended an off the menu nigiri that was amazing. It was the smoked saki belly which was smoked salmon belly with garlic infused vinegar, soy, and micro shiso.

We were ready and starving... We ordered 3 rolls and 1 app. The sushi was okay - nothing special.

2014-04-17,4.0,"When I gave my partner-in-crime the choice of celebrating his birthday at Katsu again or heading to Arami, he chose Arami to expand our horizons. I suggested Arami because it made my short list of stellar sushi places in the city. For the most part, it did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is very unassuming. You could easily walk or drive right by the entrance and our cab driver almost did. Once inside, there really isn't much space to wait; the bar is small and dining tables fill out the front area - I recommend a reservation. We sat in the way back, in a relatively cozy area that looked like a now enclosed outdoor space, with three other tables. We were extremely hungry when we arrived and ordered the hamachi poke and togarashi seared tuna to get things started. If you're looking for a more traditional interpretation of poke, the dish - while good - will leave you wanting more. The togarashi was excellent, the seasoning on the tuna so flavorful. After our starters, we ordered three maki; two off the regular menu and one off the daily specials. I wish I remembered more about the special maki because it was our favorite of the three. Bold, balanced flavors and a perfect fish-to-rice ratio. Our other two rolls were the kampachi sake and hamachi maguro ebi; both creative and good, but not standouts in my book. The areas where Arami faltered for me were three: service, drinks and dessert. Service was friendly and attentive, but the delivery of food and drinks at times was slow and inconsistent creating awkward lulls in the meal. A table was seated and served well before some of the dishes we ordered (before they even sat) arrived. We ordered a total of four drinks; the mule and caipirinha for me and the manhattan and yamazaki scotch for him. My drinks were ok; to be honest, I wasn't overly impressed with either and they seemed heavy on the ice, light on the drink. My partner-in-crime definitely fared better with his drinks.  Dessert ended an otherwise great meal on a low note for me. Again, partner-in-crime fared better (maybe I should let him pick out my food next time). Not all of their dessert menu is made in-house. We opted for each of the items they made; him going with a japanese inspired tres leches and me with the strawberry ice cream. While he devoured his dessert, I ate my with far more restraint. Had I not known I was eating strawberry ice cream, I never would have guessed; it lacked creaminess and the tartness one expects from a berry ice cream. My overall assessment would be to skip dessert here since it's hit or miss. I'm not going to lie, Arami is spendy, a special occasion place in my book, but the caliber of food is high. While it hasn't won me over for the best sushi place in the city, it's a great experience that should be had at least once.",0.9964,0.821,0.152,0.027,0.545105663567202

I've never complained about portion size before but this bordered on ridiculous as compared to other places of similar high quality.  Perhaps they were adjusting for the patrons with on-line vouchers, but it seemed extremely expensive to all three of us, particularly given the proximity to several excellent sushi places with more normal sushi portions (like KaiZan a bit west).  We are not cheap, we do not have huge appetites, and we eat sushi a lot - and this was crazy expensive.  None of us remember feeling that any of the other times we went.  That said, the brussel sprout salad is great.",0.9143,0.804,0.138,0.059,0.5929629629629629

From the regular menu we had: 1. Kampachi Sake roll - also very tasty. 2. Brussel Sprouts with lamb sausage, garlic chips, pickled fresno pepper, ponzu brown butter - these were great, basically equal parts sausage and brussel sprouts but very flavorful. 3. Sashimi: yellowtail with truffly 4. Baby sepia (cuttlefish) red chili flake, garlic, shiso, yuzu - the one thing I DID NOT LIKE. I imagine this was not due to the preparation, but probably the inherent properties of the fish - it was chewy to the point that i couldn't take a bite without yanking it apart with my fingers, then mushy inside.  5. Dessert: AMAZING Jasmine tea ice cream - so incredibly aromatic and flavorful, I felt like i had stuck my face in a jasmine blossom. The Wasabi cream cheese ice cream on graham cracker was interesting and unique, definitely could taste the wasabi coming through. The miso peanut butter just tasted like decadent peanut butter ice cream. Don't waste time on the yuzu flavor. Other stuff: This place is somewhat unassuming, small bar in front but beautiful dining room in back - small and quite crowded, but somehow working well with the energy of the restaurant.

First Course (Sashimi and Nigiri) -- thin slices.  Fresh and clean taste. 2nd Course (Robata Grill pork belly and maitaki mushroom) -- I truly enjoyed the slightly salty pork belly.  Best in town for flavor.  Maitaki Mushroom balances the saltiness and compliments both flavors. 3rd Course: Arami Ramen -- significantly ordinary.  Over the counter pre-made noodles.  Just broth. Unagi Donburi -- lots of bones in eel.  Overwhelming sauce on rice.  One calls it 'fishy.' Fourth Course -- Mochi is from a delicious Hawaiian brand.  Excellent taste!  The Mochi craze is at least 10 years old.

However, I was a little disappointed with the atmosphere/ambiance. I've had Arami bookmarked for so long and thought the interior looked amazing from pictures. There's a difference between plain and minimalist. The dining room just seemed plain? It kind of threw us off when we arrived. Actually, the place reminded me a lot of Chizakaya, a restaurant that closed at least a year ago. Funny enough, Arami is expanding into that exact location within the next year! Service was good.

2013-10-06,1.0,"I don't know why Arami got good reviews, but for me.. Arami was meehhh.. I ordered carry out yesterday. One ramen and two maki rolls. The ramen was blah. I'm sorry but its true!! I'm half Japanese and I've spent my life eating Japanese foods. This is not ramen!! The broth didn't taste anything, its basically just taste like water. The noodle was not ramen noodle, and it was an overcooked noodle. For $15, this is not something I was looking for to eat. Instant ramen noodle probably taste better and a whole lot cheaper. The rolls (futo maki and I didn't know the other one, because my husband ordered it) were disappointing. The rice didn't stick. It fell apart. And also, the roll was sooooooo thin. I don't know how they made it, but it's so not japanese roll. They cut the fish really thin. I mean, come on, for a $15 roll, you better give me a good roll. The futo maki was so-so.  Overall, I'm not gonna come back to this restaurant. Sorry!! but it's just not worth it.

2013-09-29,2.0,"Rebekka T's review below was so spot on, I asked to Yelp-friend her.  My only criteria for getting Yelp-Friends are tastes in food and spelling quality, I so wish I heeded her review on the place.        Here's why I didn't, my father picked the place for his birthday. My father went to medical school in Hiroshima, met my mother ""Good Morning Vietnam""-style by subbing then stealing an English language class from his friend, so he has, or at least had a pretty good taste for authentic Japanese.  Here's what I didn't account for, the effect of the years with evil step-mother.  My mother passed away many years ago, and was somehow replaced by a trophy wife, also from Japan, but younger, prettier, and much more ethically challenged than my mother.  My father developed an odd passive-aggressive response to the misery wife number two gave to him, he developed a habit of dragging my evil step-mother (and innocent friends and family) to fake-Japanese restaurants, like those insulting ""Japanese"" steak houses with their stereotypical Hibachi chef performances.  Evil stepmother hated those places, like most Japanese, she couldn't handle the pseudo-Japanese cuisine, both in taste, nor  the ethnophaulisms and offensive racist insult of mish-mashing all the Far East Asian cultures together into a misshapen American ball of ethnocentrism.  Well, a divorce and another marriage later, Dad still likes to go to ersatz-Japanese places like this one.  Sorry, was that too much background?  Maybe so, but I'm half-Japanese, I was actually ashamed (in a Japanese fashion) to have sat and eaten here.  I wonder if this is how real Mexicans feel eating at a Chi-Chis.         This place is so not Japanese.  They don't greet you properly when you come in.  The decorations are mostly Japanese, but they've mixed in some Korean and Chinese, and it's all way too cluttered for real Japanese tastes.  Our server was clearly Asian-American, but knew absolutely nothing about Japanese cuisine, though in all fairness, neither did the chefs.  The presentation was quite not-Japanese, they serve the soups and noodles Chinese-American style, or in Korean bowls, it's as if they went out of their way to learn nothing about how Japanese eat their food.  The sushi didn't use proper sushi rice, the menu wasn't arranged Japanese style, the ramen noodles weren't hand-made, were overcooked (!), weren't served Japanese-hot, and just weren't quite right.  The noodles were better than the cheapest supermarket ramen, but not as good as the better supermarket ramen (the kind you get at Far East or Southeast Asian groceries), and priced at a staggering $15 a bowl.  They had a fairly good selection of sake, but didn't serve it properly with a choice of real sake cups.     It wasn't all bad, by American standards the service was good, our very not-Japanese waitress was quick, attentive, and they held our table past our reservation time even though some of us were very late.  I've been in other pseudo-Japanese restaurants, and the genre is generally overpriced, this place isn't that much more overpriced than the other ersatz-Japanese places I've suffered through. Your best bet if you get dragged to this place by someone like my father who has passive-aggressive tendencies bred by a bad marriage to a beautiful Japanese witch, is to order the American sushi inventions, the rolls they've created (in other words avoid anything purporting to be traditional Japanese), as that stuff was tasty in a not Japanese way. If you are looking for authentic Japanese, you're going to be very disappointed coming here.  I know I was.",0.8942,0.758,0.132,0.11,0.42234610917537757

If this was based on service alone, this would easily be a five-star review. The waitress was timely and attentive. The host, too, was very accommodating to adjusting our reservation time.  The reason for the two docked stars has to do with the food. For the price of the sushi, I expected high-quality fish and traditional sashimi. It was very average.

2013-08-28,5.0,"I've been to Arami about four times now and there is an argument to be made that it is the best Sushi restaurant in the city. This consistent place is about quality fish and very unique flavors. On the decor and atmosphere it's certainly very elegant, not too loud and comfortable to be in. It does feel upscale but without that overthetop Vegas showmanship that places like Sunda and Roka Akor boast. I also think that the dishes here tend to lean towards more traditional japanese dishes that haven't been overexposed by all the casual sushi restaurants (sorry I know that sounds pretentious but I couldn't figure a better way to explain it!). Foor food, it's hard to recommend things where the menu changes so often, but I can tell you that you want to order the ""off-menu"" spicy tako hand roll. That alone will make you crave the place morning, noon and night ...  As for the rest of the menu, pick and choose what you will because it's hard to go wrong!

2013-08-26,4.0,"We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday this past Saturday. I made reservation over a week ago just to ensure the restaurant can hold a table for 14 people (since most sushi restaurants are small, I was always cautious about space). I worked with Carol (the GM of Arami) few days before the event, because Arami only does pre-set menu for a big party. The pre-set menu comes with different price points ($60, 80, 100). We had the $60 menu - I worked with Carol throughout the past few days to customize a menu that would suit our liking. She was very helpful and put together a delicious menu for us. She was also very flexible, too, which we really appreciate. With our big group we were seated in a dining area in the rear. It is a nice private room for us to talk amongst ourselves without the distractions of other customers and the surroundings.  Our menu was a 8 course dinner. It felt more like a tasting menu because we didn't get an individual dish, but it was more served family style where couple dishes of the same kind came out to share amongst our friends. Each of the dishes were amazing. They are smaller portions (like Japanese tapas), and I  know few of our male friends were still hungry after dinner. The girls were comfortably satiated, but the guys went to grab some more food afterwards. Below is the list of dishes we tried: 1. Oysters - the east coast oyster was my favorite 2. Seared tuna - Really, really good 3. Enoki salad (mushroom salad) - Really good 4. Grilled Sepia - Okay 5. 3 pieces of sashimi - It was so buttery and good. Each pieces were amazing. My favorite was the salmon. 6. 3 pieces of nigiri - More on the smaller end, but still good 7. Maguro Ebi  (king crab wrapped with tuna) - A favorite amongst the group - We only each had one piece which was sad but it was really good. We wish we could order 10 of these! 8. Came with 3 rolls - they were all good. My favorite was the double sake.  9. Hokkaido Ramen - Broth was good. Noodle texture was decent. The broth was kind of sweet. Love the pork that was in it. 14 of us were originally given 3 regular orders (the typical bowl size for a ramen order) - it was way too little for us to share so we asked for another one which they kindly gave us without having to charge extra. So we ended up with 4 orders. Still not enough but at least everyone ate. Overall, the food quality is there. Really delicious food. Because we had the pre-set menu (due to our big party) it wasn't enough food for half the party. The next time we come back definitely wuold come in a smaller group just so we can order their regular size dishes.  Service was really good!",0.9993,0.74,0.25,0.009,0.49629830263633096

2013-06-03,5.0,"After being a patron of Arami for over 2 years, this review is long overdue. It's no secret to anyone who knows me that this is my favorite restaurant. I rarely wear my heart on my sleeves, but my love of Arami might as well be a tattoo on my forehead. Where do I even begin? The 3 words that immediately pop into my head when I think of Arami are: - Understated - Consistent - YUM --- Understated: exhibiting restrained good taste There is an understated approach to every aspect of the restaurant--from the unassuming exterior to the simple yet flavorful food itself.  The ambience is great, if you get there for an early dinner before the crowd, it's quiet but still warm and inviting--you won't ever feel like you are awkwardly walking into an empty restaurant. Once the crowd picks up, it definitely becomes more active, but it never gets so loud that you can't have a conversation with your dinner companion(s) without yelling. They always play great music and have figured out the right volume where it's loud enough to hear but not enough to overpower. This balance is also a core part of the food, in presentation and taste. Whether you looking to try out the sushi or the cooked foods, you can't go wrong.  --- Consistent -- marked by harmony, regularity, or steady continuity In the 2+ years I have been dining at Arami, I have never been let down. I can't say the same about many places, especially one that has gone through changes in the kitchen. There are also few places where I could blindfold myself and have the confidence that I will enjoy anything that is arbitrarily picked.  The service has always been phenomenal too.  --- YUM -- GET IN MAH BELLY Chef Uchi really is an artist. Don't believe me? Check out their Facebook and Instagram for photographic evidence! I am ashamed to admit that I have never ordered the omakase (chef's choice) but that's on my list.   Chef Ervin and his team know what's up when it comes to cooked food. Unlike, most places that basically serve ""teriyaki + meat"" and ""tempura udon"" as the cooked counterparts to their sushi, Ervin mixes it up with unexpected flavors and seasonal dishes that make me drool even thinking about them. He's always experimenting too which keeps things interesting for regulars like me. Now onto the actual dishes. I am going to really restrain myself and limit it to picking a favorite one item per menu category. // SEASONAL SPECIAL Brussel Sprouts: Rayu-marinated house-made squab sausage, pickled banana peppers, yuzu brown butter and pine nuts.  I've been tempted many times to lick the bowl after finishing it. // COLD (Small dishes) Togarashi Seared Tuna: Served on top of a seaweed salad with kelp noodle and daikon, topped with a meyer lemon dressing  I don't know why it took me so long to try this, but now that I have, there's no turning back. I've had variations of this type of dish at other places that pale by comparison. // HOT (Small dishes) Mushroom Salad: enoki, shimeji, shiitake, eringi, meyer lemon, sesame  I picked this one because it's only $6 bucks and packed with so much flavor. This is a good dish for all year round.  // Noodles Kuro Tantanmen: ground pork, black sesame, fried garlic, pearl onion, soy-marinated egg Not your typical soy-sauce based broth ramen. This thicker broth ramen packs a punch. It's got a nice spice to it that gives your taste buds a wake-up-call but is not overwhelming to the point where you can't taste anything. They introduced it as a special and it's so damn good they added it to the regular menu #winning. // DONBURI Braised Short Rib Donburi: with pickled asian pear, pickled fresno This is a super great comforting dish. It reminds me of a dish I grew up with but with a more sophisticated flavor profile. I've gotten it for take-out and it travels well. // ROBATA (Charcoal Grilled) Buto No Ago: pork jowl, gochujan, carrot-daikon These little skewers of meet are delicious, 'buff said. // YASAI (Vegetables) Eringi Maki: grilled king oyster mushroom, garlic vinegar Simple and delicate but very tasty. // NIGIRI Uni: sea urchin The sushi is always fresh and oh so delicious, and they always keep it real with the uni. Oh uni, how I love thee. I'm not a fighter, but I'll fight you for the uni. // SPECIAL SASHIMI Secret Hamachi: yellow tail, mushroom, truffle oil A must try for true fish lovers. // SPECIAL NIGIRI Zuke Sake Hotate: spicy scallop wrapped with salmon The scallop is warm and the salmon is cold.

2013-05-29,5.0,"We eat out a lot. Too much, even. But the ratio of Arami vs non-Arami dining is getting a bit out of hand.  Now, I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life. I'm not a snob-- I like fancy sushi, cheap sushi, uni I literally saw plucked from the sea, a wild variety of unidentifiable items in Asia.  I even did a spin waiting tables at another (to remain nameless) high end sushi joint in the city and this is still one of my faves. (Shh, even after BK left!) If you want something creative or unique, the spicy tako springrolls, maguro kani nigiri, any of the special sashimi, and the soft shell/ebi maki are always spot on. All of the ramens and the mushroom salads make great savory options, as well. And their spicy tako handroll, I could die happy eating that the rest of my life. But let's be honest. I rarely have room for anything fancy after STUFFING MYSELF WITH SASHIMI. Seriously. Why are you ordering nigiri? That rice is taking up room that could be filled with more pieces of fish. Take my advice and always try at least two of the nightly pieces, they'll be new and interesting and delicious.   (And they now have a private label sake that's quite delicious. I would not recommend drinking multiple, multiple, multiple servings and then trying to have an intelligent conversation, however. Just drink it and smile sleepily while thinking about all that delicious sashimi in your belly.) Also: Arami staff, we love you. But you know that, since we see you all the goddamned time.

2013-03-16,4.0,"I had an absolutely stellar meal at Arami last weekend. Technically, it was ""date night"", but Nishan P and Izzy N were nowhere to be seen, so I question that a little bit. The space is beautifully decorated, simple and lots of natural elements (wood, etc). The service, from Tiffany and support staff, were wonderful. She coursed out our meal for us, and made sure that we didn't want any more sushi before having our heavier red meat course. Lobster chawanmushi was on special that night. When I saw that on the specials menu, I pretty much this meal was going to be a winner I love all things eggs, especially delicate, savory, egg custards topped with king crab. We continued on with a variety of different nigiri (a maple smoked salmon), speciality nigiri (the salmon/scallop is divine), and rolls (the crispy salmon skin inside the double salmon roll is such a great idea). It was all fresh and delicious. There was no mango sauce or deep fried cream cheese. And if you love raw fish, make sure to start with a toro tartar bite. The scallop cake came with a spicy dipping sauce that I loved, and I loved rounding out the meal with gyu (robata steak with uni butter) and tantanmen (ground pork ramen), and finishing with some sesame fig gelato from Black Dog.  The meal was such a delight. I didn't feel leaving stuffed, which is important to note for date-nighters (a giant bowl of pasta = a night of snoozing).  The total for 2 including 4 drinks and tip was $180, which isn't cheap, but definitely worth it for the freshness of ingredients, service, and ambience.

The food is innovative without straying from traditional Japanese tastes or presentation.  The quality of the fish is excellent as well.  I think that is partially due to the fact that they don't seem to stock the kitchen sink.  They have all the staples with a few specials of whatever is seasonal or freshest, at least that's what it seems like.  I've always gotten the sushi specials and they tend to be one of the best items of the meal.   They make a Brussels Sprouts dish that is pretty intense too. I think the prices are more than reasonable given the quality of the food.  Portions aren't massive but I have yet to have something that I felt wasn't worth trying.  Service is prompt and knowledgeable.  The bar area in the front is great too.  Next time might try a ramen.",0.9481,0.851,0.128,0.02,0.5397058823529411

2013-02-15,4.0,"I snagged a prime time Valentine's Day reso at the 11th hour and I was really excited to finally eat here. I had a friend tell me it was 'the best sushi she's ever eaten.' The restaurant itself is great. Doesn't look like much when you first walk in with just the bar with a few high tops. A tip for any hopeful diners that can't get a reso, these high tops were for walk in guests and plenty available at 7:30pm.  The menu is kind of overwhelming at first, so I just took the recs of other yelpers and they didn't let me down. I'll pay it forward: TORO TARTAR BITES - Everyone raves about these. Beautiful presentation but these are legitimately teaspoon sized portions. I might suggest trying it for the flavor, but FOR SURE not worth $5 apiece. I'd say skip these. TOGARASHI SEARED TUNA - This was an excellent starter. Really nicely seared with a light dressing on top. Loved the seaweed salad and crunchy kelp noodles that it sat on. Our plate was completely empty. LOBSTER CHIRAMUSI - This was one of the specials for the night and it really impressed. Nicely presented in a small heated pot, it was a silky custard with a rich broth topped with lobster. Great flavor and kind of melted in your mouth MAITAKE - Off the Robata grill, these were Japanese seasoned mushrooms with a black sesame sauce on the side. Pretty tasty, not mind blowing. Appeased my vegetarian date so I was happy to try. SECRET HAMACHI - Special Sashimi - Super fresh, thick cut yellow tail topped with mushroom, & truffle oil. Probably the best sashimi I've ever had. No soy sauce necessary, it's all about the flavors here.  MAGURO KANI - Special Nigiri - My favorite thing I ate all night. King crab on top of rice and wrapped with marinated tuna with roasted almonds on top. The most disappointing thing was that this only came as 2 pieces, I wish this was an entire roll.  HAMACHI MAGURO EBI - All the makis are beautifully presented. Really neat and tasty, and rightfully so because they only have a hand full of selections. This maki is filled with yellow tail, tuna, scallion and jalapeno and topped with shrimp and a little spicy mayo. A little kick but not too bad.  ARAMI RAMEN - Served last because it is the heaviest dish. As previously mentioned, I love ramen and had heard a lot of hype about the Arami ramen. I hate to say it, but it was a let down. As Jeremy L said, it was surprisingly mediocre. The pork belly was way to chewy and the broth lacked flavor. He described it best... it's like the broth wasn't stewed all night like other places. It's too bad.  To be clear, this place isn't for the gluttonous sushi lover that wants to down 5 maki rolls. Don't get me wrong, I love doing that but you have to know that coming in. It's like tapa style Japanese in that they give you small portions one at a time. We never even got soy sauce which speaks volumes that they really want you to appreciate the flavors rather then drench in soy. I left comfortably full and not stuffed. The fact that this place is not BYOB is a shame, too. I hate to say it, but I would rather go to Yuzu down the street for a cheaper, more gluttonous sushi dinner.",0.9991,0.708,0.237,0.055,0.5632191250483933

2013-02-10,2.0,"I love sushi and ramen and really looked forward to trying out Arami.   Started with oysters that were great. Kumamotos from the west coast and a variety from Newfoundland, 2 each. The Kumamotos came with a wasabi roe, mixing up the sweetness of the oyster with a nice contrast of the roe. The Newfoundland oysters were served with peppercorn, surprising but really tasty. Loved them.  The sushi was great too. Superb variety and solid freshness.  The ramen was surprisingly mediocre. I ordered the Arami ramen and the first red flag was that my noodles came in clumps. Clumpy noodles are passable if they're cooked well to the standard chewy ramen noodle texture and come apart easily. But the clumps I had were hard. Maybe the noodles had been sitting around for too long before being put into the broth because at the same time of being clumpy, they hadn't absorbed the flavor of the broth.  And broth is everything with ramen. I've had ramen in Japan, Los Angeles, and New York. W/o good broth, the entire bowl is pretty much shot. The broth for my Arami ramen was meh. There was no depth as if the broth hadn't been stewed long enough with its ingredients to develop a rich flavor. The pork belly and braised beef were pretty good and the lightly pickled cucumber was a nice touch but it was clear that not enough time went into the soup.  My friend's ramen was pretty interesting. Her noodles weren't clumped and the broth was more like a sauce than a broth, which is fine; there are styles of ramen like that. The dish was very peppery, which I rather liked, but again, the flavor didn't have a lot of depth or richness to it. A unique dish but perhaps not one I would order over and over again.  The restaurant decor and service is great and my buddy who's really into music commented on the great musical ambience. Water glasses were kept filled and our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Very pricey for the quantity/quality of food. The ramen portions are not particularly filling.  2 stars because ""Meh. I've experienced better"" sounds about right; the seafood we had was great but the hyped expectations for the ramen were not met. But I'm willing to come back and give the ramen another shot in the hopes that it was an off night, so stay tuned as I continue to look for a go-to ramen place in Chicago.",0.999,0.741,0.247,0.012,0.571578884078884

There was no trouble getting a table without a reservation on a Sunday evening at 6:30 PM.  I might not go again on a Sunday, though.  On other days, fish comes in fresh daily, but not on Sunday, so they were out of salmon and a few other things.  There were plenty of other options on the menu, though, and we made the best of it.  We ordered the spicy tako spring roll for a starter (comes in four small but flavorful pieces), the chef's assortment of sashimi (14 very fresh and lovely cuts of fish in 7 varieties) and the Arami ramen, a comforting mixture of braised beef, pork belly, poached egg, pickled veggies, fish cake, enoki mushrooms, and noodles, in a beef broth.  It was the perfect amount of food to share, and we blissed out on fish and noodles, while getting pleasantly buzzed on hot sake. Service was friendly and attentive, without being overbearing.  The room was cozy and attractive (tables are maybe a little close together).  The bill for appetizer, sashimi plate, ramen, and three rounds of hot sake came out to about $100, which seemed reasonable given the fine quality of the food.  I will definitely return for more!",0.9947,0.756,0.207,0.037,0.5655172413793103

First off the mixologist at the bar and the sake/cocktail list - absolutely yum! I loved the Arami Aviation - great flavors!  Toro tartare bites melted in your mouth with a nice pop of caviar and hints of pear and the togarashi seared tuna definitely stood out from all others (since everyone has jumped on the seared tuna bandwagon even if they serve Italian cuisine). Arami ramen left me speechless - especially since the only ramen I had previously been in contact with was the cheap grocery store kind - pork belly, enoki, constantly evolving flavors - spectacular and a meal in and of itself. Do not miss out on the secret hamachi sashimi w/truffle oil and especially the Maguro Kani special nigiri - anyone familiar with the Kani Kani nigiri of Mirai and Japonais - this is elevated to another level and with the added texture of almonds - perfect marriage. Shrimp tempura asparagus maki is the mature older brother of the tempura roll - the salmon on top was perfection.  Also had the grilled madai special - with braised daikon and puffed rice - tender fish and aromatic consomme with the added texture of the puffed rice - really another standout dish.  For dessert: miso maple pot du creme paired with walnut bacon granola and bacon cream - a new Japanese American classic!

I've been to Arami several times, and I'm never disappointed with the variety and quality of the dishes.   This past weekend, I went with my boyfriend around 8:30pm on a Friday night.  We didn't have reservations.  The back seating area was full, but there were a few tables in the front and a couple of open seats at the sushi bar.  We opted for seats at the sushi bar where the sushi chefs checked in on us (we also had a great server) and pleasantly answered any questions about the menu. I started the night with my second favorite drink, the Nigata River, deliciously refreshing chilled sake infused with cucumber slices.  My first favorite drink is the sangria, but it wasn't on the menu because it's seasonal.  Blast you end of summer! We started out with the uni shooter, edamame and miso soup.  The uni shooter is arranged in a tall shot glass on ice.  It's one of my favorite because the sea urchin always tastes like the sea, slightly salty and fresh. We stuck to sushi and a noodle dish.  I had a special salmon sake maki roll - cooked salmon wrapped in rice with raw salmon and slightly spicy, creamy sauce on top.  The noodle dish had noodles, pork, egg and veggies in a spicy broth.   Finally, dessert was Black Dog sesame chocolate chip gelato!

2012-09-30,3.0,"Arami serves a combination of sushi and cooked Japanese food. We tried both.  The sushi was good, but nothing out of the ordinary -- salmon and sea trout were both good picks. The nigiri, maki and sashimi are comparable in price and quality to most medium-upscale sushi establishments.  The other menu items are more intriguing. The coolest thing on the menu is the interesting selection of tsukemono (pickled stuff). For $8 you can choose a selection of three pickled items suitable for sharing. We had burdock root (pungent sesame flavor), beets (good, pretty predictable) and quail eggs (crazy purple gems with super strange texture and a ton of flavor!) I'd recommend this as a starter.  I am a huge uni (sea urchin) fan, and had read about the uni shooter, which I was really looking forward to trying. Unfortunately, they were out of uni that night. Instead we ordered a cooked scallop starter, which was just OK. For my taste it had too much oil and breading. It reminded me of a crab cake (one of the few seafood items I really dislike; if you like crab cakes, you will likely enjoy this appetizer).  The ambiance is stylish. From the front entrance, Arami looks like a tiny storefront with just a bar and a few tables. Through a narrow hallway, it opens up into an attractively minimalist high-ceilinged dining room with natural wood and skylights. There's also a cozy enclosed back porch with additional seating.  Arami has an extensive sake list including bottles and a few by-the-glass selections. They also have a small, but interesting cocktail list. I had a refreshing and light cucumber sake cocktail, which I'd recommend.  Our server was really great.

2012-09-07,5.0,"Without a doubt, the BEST nigiri/sashimi place in Chicago.  My husband and I went here for our one year wedding anniversary and had reservations for their Omakase menu.  In case you didn't know, Omakase is a Japanese phrase meaning ""I'll leave it to you"" and the Omakase menu is chef's choice.  Meaning, you just sit there and look pretty while the chefs decide to bring you whatever they feel like making/bringing to you. I wish all places can be like this.  They even serve you special treats that aren't on the menu and are treated like royalty.  We asked for a mix and match of traditional nigiri/sushi with some grilled options (traditional Japanese street food, but elevated).  You're seated right in front of the sushi chefs, so you see all the action and hustle and bustle.  Overall, the quality of the fish is the freshest I've tasted in Chicago, and I've eaten at A LOT of sushi places.  While the prices are slightly more expensive than the others, it's very much worth it.

Tried the Arami Ramen and the Kimchi Ramen, and both disappointed, even more so at the price point of $15 a bowl.  Neither of these are traditional Japanese ramens by any extent of the imagination.   The Arami ramen consisted of a beef / soy broth.  Not bad, but not great either.  Lacked the flavor you get from a pork broth.  Came with pork belly and braised beef, both of which lacked flavor.  The pork belly was also not tender and definitely did not melt in your mouth (like all ramen pork belly should do).  The noodles in both ramens were very starchy and lacked the chewy ""bounce"" you get in great ramen noodles. The Kimchi ramen had the same issues with the pork belly and the noodles.  The soup that this ramen came with was basically like a jjigae that you get at Korean restaurants.  Pretty much something I could have made at home with a pack of ramen noodles and kimchi.  Not impressed at all.   Service was quick and professional.

2012-04-23,3.0,"We went to Arami in August of 2010 shortly after it opened and during the short time it was BYO. It was one of our best meals of 2010 and have recommended many people to try their sashimi and ramen. I'm also embarrassed that for one of our favorites we did not return for 18 months, especially since we moved into the neighborhood. A few weeks ago we re-acquainted ourselves and had a very nice sushi meal with the Dermans. While our first visit was flawless and amazing (and cheap), my second visit had a few more blemishes. I acknowledge it's impossible to judge a restaurant on one trip, and probably harder with two separated trips so far apart. The highlights remained the same: love the tiny space and casual decor, great service and likely the best sashimi in town. We didn't love the maki rolls this time around and the ramen bowl did not have the same amazing memory as before. I was also surprised by the price - I'll happily pay for quality fish, but considering we didn't leave stuffed and didn't drink a lot it was not a cheap experience. The presentations are all top notch and can transform an unassuming wooden table into a work of art. We are now better prepared to order what we like and stick to the high quality (and expensive) fresh fish and simple appetizers. It's a great place to have near by and a worthy destination for anyone in the area. If you're just craving maki rolls I'd recommend heading to a cheaper local BYO and lower expectations. In total our meal consisted of seaweed salad, edamamae fatty tuna sashimi dollops, salmon, three maki rolls, two specialty rolls, vegetable ramen and more sashimi served on the huge bowl of ice with flowers. As I mentioned, everything was good but few things were amazing - and they were the deliciously subtle flavoring of the sashimi pieces. Best quality fish I've had in the city in a long time.

We ordered a wide array of appetizers, soup, sashimi  and rolls. At first they began bringing food too fast to our table. It was manageable but annoying. Every dish was better than the next.  After a while, they left our dishes on the table and we were waiting for our last roll to be brought out. The  issue we encountered dealt with our ticket being misplaced in their kitchen and our last dish never being served. Tables which were seated an hour after us were continually getting food. We informed our waitress of the issue and came back to let us know about the problem. Twenty minutes later our food was not brought so I kindly asked for the check.  There is only metered street parking and our 2 hour time limit was expiring. The waitress knew it was my wife's bday and offered a free desert but by this time, I was done. I would have been extremely upset to have to wait and get a parking citation.  We will go back because the food was amazing, but would not recommend going on a Friday or Saturday.  It was too bad we had the service issues because we would certainly become regulars.",0.9118,0.824,0.108,0.069,0.4722831632653061
2012-03-31,5.0,"My new favorite sushi spot. Just went for my second time last night and saw the guy from Friday Night Lights-QB. The restaurant does not have a large store front but when you get inside its wonderful decor and lighting. They also have an outside patio that they open in warmer months. The food is delicious and the servers are very educated. I won't bother explaining all my favorites as they do a great job of it. I love the idea that they reccomended getting the Ramen or Short Rib after the sushi as a full flavor to finish off with.  I'm a bit confused by the yelpers that keep saying its so expensive. I'm not sure what they are comparing it to-some random neighborhood sushi bar. That is not what this is. Compare it to a Sunda or a Japonais and they are very fairly priced. My first time there I spent $100 on myself only because I drank good wine (great wine list). Last night we only spent $113 for 2 (before tip) and we ate a ton. I had to take food home. We also had hot sake. (I know cold sake is better). Anyways, if you are a true sushi fan, a lover of restaurant decor, or just like trying new places-go for it. Just remember to make a reservation!!! My only complaint, I hate those small tables where they pack people in 2 top by 2 top-but thats how most sushi places are these days-Enjoy!",0.9928,0.756,0.196,0.047,0.5708741550846812

First and foremost I have to point out that we spent $100 for two people with hot tea as our only drink and we left HUNGRY.  Well, the boy was hungry, and I felt in no way like I had eaten dinner.  We ordered a mixture of hot and cold appetizers and two sushi rolls.  It was two weeks ago and I can't remember a single one, except the tuna skewers which I remember for being overcooked.  Super bummer.",0.8892,0.785,0.144,0.072,0.6327876984126982

The baked crab and tuna tasted really fishy, the starters were all overly salty and we never received the edamame.  Highlights were the spring roll and the wine.  This used to be my favorite spot for sushi but I won't be running back any time soon.",0.9473,0.86,0.109,0.031,0.41428571428571426

I find many places that focus on a traditional sushi experience are the older, more underwhelming spots, where as, the high-end sushi places tends to be too modern in cuisine. Arami has fantastic quality seafood, expect to pay good money... and this isn't one of the those pricey, 'place to be seen' spots either... FOOD Must get: Sake Garlic (special), Secret Hamachi (special), Hirame Spicy Tako, Double Sake & Hamachi Maguro Ebi. Gelato Trio- The best of Black Dog gelato (my absolute favorite gelato and great to see Arami sourcing locally). Had Blood Orange, Sea Salt and Black Sesame- all fantastic!  SERVICE Meticulous, quiet & unpretentious- precisely what I appreciate when sushi-ing.

We ve been to this place three times and everytime its been better than the last time.  The staff are super friendly, the chef himself and the sous chefs are all friendly. Make sure to offer them a drink, as they work very hard and the chef makes sure that he drinks anything that u offer him. The place itself offers a good combination of casual or romantic. U can either sit by the sushi bar and feel a little more casual, or grab one of the tables in the back and have a nice romantic dinner. We ve ordered the omakase every time, and in all honesty, we dont know how they do it, but the quality of the fish is amazing. Combine that with the amazing presentation that Chef BK puts into ur dish and ur in for a nice ride. They have some of the best fish that we ve tired and to be honest, after living in NYC and Vancouver, we still cant figure out how a place in mid-west can get such good quality fish.

My husband's favorite sushi place in Chicago is Macku, so a lot of our friends told us that we should try Arami because it's similar in feel and food. Well, it's not.  At least not in my opinion.  I think that the sukiyaki is just plain wrong: the broth is wrong, the meat is not the right slice of beef that you're supposed to use, the portions are wrong, the noodles are cut (which is really weird - why cut the noodles?), and the bowl is not jam-packed with simmering goodness like it should be. My husband thought that the special sashimi and nigiri we good, but there weren't enough of them.   The presentation of the sushi was admittedly very elegant.  And we received attentive service by the wait staff.  But if I want to go to a great Japanese/sushi restaurant in the city with rock solid Japanese food, it's still going to be Macku by a mile.",0.9737,0.71,0.198,0.092,0.6316326530612245
2012-03-09,5.0,"Arami is now one of my favorite special occasion sushi places. Tucked away on the western end of a budding foodie paradise, Arami combines the thoroughly Japanese approach to food of appealing to all senses and friendly, down-to-earth Chicago-style service. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive while still being easygoing. The space is sophisticated in a minimalist, not-too-trendy way--the perfect balance between uber hip Japonais/Mirai and the no-frills Katsu. Most importantly, the food was aesthetically pleasing, texturally complex, and incredibly delicious. Whether nigiri topped with cuts of fresh, flavorful, undressed hamachi, rolls encased with deep-fried unagi and jalapeno sauce, or tasting spoons of shiso-dusted toro, Arami offered a broad range of delicious ways to part us of our money. The plain nigiri showcased the quality of the fish--the botan ebi and sake (salmon) were excellent. At the other end, the Toro Tartare Bite and truffle-oil topped Secret Hamachi, were carefully constructed twists on sashimi, as beautiful to look at as it was to eat, at once both experimental and faithful to the underlying fish flavors. My fiance and I delightfully savored the tiny morsel-sized edible ""artwork."" The special rolls, while very tasty, were least exciting because they merely reflected a better executed version of what a lesser sushi joint with lower-grade fish does and in doing so masked the natural flavor of the superb fish. And, after pieces of delicate, unadulterated nigiri and ambitious, one-of-a-kind takes on dressed sashimi, the rolls were less satisfying. In addition to many approaches to raw/barely cooked fish, the menu also includes Japanese homestyle foods like ramen and donburi; incorporating these dishes would likely keep costs down, but if you enjoy great sushi/sashimi, it's worth the (hefty) splurge.

We had a number of excellent nigiri and maki mono next - these change daily and I'm reasonably sure you can't go wrong.  They were all delicious and were well accompanied by the Chokaisan sake suggested by our server (did I mention she was excellent and always suggesting the right menu items?).  The highlight of the evening though was the Horse Mackerel (see picture) which was not only a thing of beauty, but one of the cleanest, most delicious raw fish preparations I've ever eaten.  I don't typically love sushi, but I still think of how wonderful this dish is.

Like many of the dishes themselves, no one ingredient/dish dominated, rather each struck a subtle note and contributed it's own texture. The result of each dish, like the meal itself was with each bite you had a symphony in your  mouth.  The first best dish I had all night was the uni shooter. The diced cucumber pops in your mouth like good caviar. The toro bite packs an unbelievable amount of fatty tuna flavor on such a small spoon. The secret hamachi was my next favorite dish. The tiny slices of mushroom paired with the truffle oil is perfection. The zuke sake hotate and soft shell crab with spicy ebi, the ginger infused Japanese ale and a bottle of the Narutotai Drunken Snapper sake all left me drifting in a cloud of hedonistic over indulgence. I order the Arami ramen and one taste of that rich deep broth and I know this is the best ramen I've had in Chicago. The braised beef and the contrast the sour pickles add is amazing. I have the braised duck donburi and the fact that the rice holds it's own, is in fact the star rather than the vehicle in a dish with the most amazing duck, chilies with just the perfect amount of heat, and pickled fresno, says all that needs to be said about that rice.     We're at the threshold now. I've written too much, you've read too much. Like I was at this point in the meal last night. Although I was pleasantly drunk I ordered a Japanese whiskey and green tea based cocktail.

We were seated in the covered outdoor back patio (complete w/ mini fireplaces, love) -- and then proceeded to order, oh, idk, pretty much EVERYTHING. The sake and beer selection is baller (try the 19.5% alc content sake and then try to use chopsticks. JUST TRY) -- and the menu is simultaneously creatively Japanese and American -- standouts were the uni shooters, mushroom salad, ebi yaki, sake mussels, chili-oil salmon roll, secret hamachi sashimi, and the kimchi ramen. My parents refuse to eat raw fish  (me: Just try the roll. Dad: I am not touching that salty nastiness. Me: fine, I'll eat yours, gobble, gobble, gobble), and all of the veg rolls I ordered for them were interesting and adult -- the avo roll came topped w/ toasted almonds, the grilled enoki roll had a gorgeous sauteed garlic on top, and the grilled asparagus roll was seductively sweet -- so if someone is a fussy eater, they can still leave feeling well fed.  Oh, and the presentation of everything is stunning -- lots of orchids, rocks, ice, etc etc -- enough to make a food porn photog out of me.  Lord, I don't know how much din for 12 was; however, there is only 1 piece of fish in most of the nigiri orders (minus one star, I'm too ravenous of a consumer for that bs) -- but I think we dropped at least $125/pp, though I think it could be done for less if you are perhaps more....delicate w/ your ordering.  Worth a trip.",0.9901,0.849,0.128,0.023,0.4165323565323566

On to the food: -Started with the toro tartare bites- wonderful and left us wanting much much more. -All three special sashimi- came with two pieces each, perfect for us. Each one was delicious and flavored to perfection. The truffle oil was my favorite of those. -Chef's choice sashimi- amazing presentation, reminded me of a tropical paradise. Our waitress instructed us on the progression of flavors, which was very helpful. It came with 16 pieces, two of each fish. All of it was super fresh, clean and just plain delicious -Hiarme spicy tako- my husband said it was the best roll he has ever had. The octopus and apple was such a unique and surprising combination, it just wowed us. Party in our mouths! -Hamachi maguro ebi- perfectly spicy and crisp flavors.  Each of the rolls came with suggestions on how to eat it with or without soy sauce. The wasabi is flavorful and has a great kick to it.

So, keep this disclaimer in mind. Arami offers high quality Japanese food, no arguments there. The reason my rating isn't higher is twofold. First, our waitress never took the time to welcome us and make sure we understood the menu and our options. Second, this place has an air of pretentiousness that I'm just not a fan of, with prices that just added to this uncomfortable ambience.  As far as the food, here's a rundown: Toro Tartare Bite - SUPER tiny offering, and not worth the price. Secret Hamachi - love truffle oil, but again, SMALL bites. Arami Ramen - meh. a bit blah, but a huge bowl of soup - definintely hearty, so if you order this as an app, it might fill you up fast.  Unagi Maguro - safe bet if you have a sushi virgin at your table. Shrimp Tempura Asparagus - love the asparagus with the mixed seafood. Albacore Unagi - my favorite of the night - the toasted almonds were a delicious add.

2011-12-04,4.0,"By far, the best sushi I have had in the Chicago area and a beautiful restaurant.  From the minute you walk into the dining room, you know you are in for something special.   The space is intimate and organic , with natural light streaming in from the wooden, slanted ceiling and brick walls.   The sushi bar is the focal point of the dining room and the chefs radiate with concentration and passion for the composition and art of each dish.  Some of the most beautifully composed sushi presentations I have ever seen. We started with the uni shooters.  Uni is one of my favorite things.  The musky, creamy texture of the uni was complimented by tobiko, diced cucumber, shiso and house soy sauce and served in shot glasses housed inside a dramatic orchid arrangement that was literally two feet tall! Recommended by our server, the mushroom salad had enoki, shitake and shimeji mushrooms and was served warm.  The mushrooms were delicate, earthy and balanced by sesame and meyer lemon. The grilled baby octopus salad was refreshing and tender.  Tender morsels of grilled octopus were tossed with daikon, napa cabbage and edamame and the acidity from the meyer lemon again rounded out the dish. We tried a couple pieces of house nigiri.  I was impressed with the quality of the squid, fish and the RICE! The spicy spider roll with ebi was also pure deliciousness. *Note that this is a very traditional Japanese sushi experience.  Chef will let you know if soy sauce is acceptable and it is not available on the table.  Chopsticks should not rest on the table.  The focus should be on the clean flavors of the fish and the presentation, not loading each piece with soy and wasabi. We also tried the arami ramen.  While the kimchi flavored broth and pork belly were sublime, I felt the noodles were overcooked and a little sub par. Finally, the korabuta pork cheek don buri was the absolute highlight of our experience.  Karashi, miso and vinegar made an amazing sauce to mix with the rice bowl.  The pork was delicately breaded and fried and had tremendous flavor.  Braised cabbage and pickled shishito added texture and acidity.   I observed serveral diners doing the omakase menu which is probably the option I would want to go with next time.  The masterpieces that the chef was  producing were unbelievable.",0.9943,0.861,0.136,0.003,0.6878078817733988

I enjoyed that it was different from the typical maki roll and was even sprinkled with slivers of sweet potato crisps. The braised short ribs were also amazing -- rich in flavor and perfect on top of rice! Another entree off of the day's special was the donkatsu, which was less intense and more bland in flavor compared to the braised short rib.

It's fresh, buttery and topped with truffle oil.  + Spicy Tako Roll - It's just ok. A little too sweet, imo.  Rolls are great and always a safe choice.

It was all just weird. We took it in stride and sat down inside, where it has a very clean feel.  The patio looked pretty from our vantage point.   Here is what we ordered (we ordered other stuff, but I'm drawing a blank right now as to what it was)-  Togarashi Seared Tuna - which is on top of a bed of seaweed salad dressed with creamy meyer lemon dressing. This was, by far, one of the best dishes I've eaten this year. I believe anything with togarashi will be delicious. And they killed it (in a good way) with the seaweed salad. Soft Shell Crab and Spicy Ebi - Pieces so flavorful that soy sauce is unnecessary, and frankly, recommended to eat without.  Very good. Hapu'upu'u - Hawaiian grouper.  This was a special, and luckily I got the last piece they had that night.  With the consistency and feel of lobster, it was quite tasty.  Order the triple gelato item for dessert. It's from Black Dog. You'll thank me later.

The only rules: it has to be somewhere none of us have been before, everyone tries everything, and we split the check equally at the end.  Our first stop was Arami for some good sushi and Japanese hot dishes, and we weren't disappointed.  We asked our waitress (who was extremely helpful and enjoyable!) for any suggestions on appetizers, and she pointed us to the Togarashi seared tuna.  The tuna was seared perfectly and tasted delicious paired with the seaweed salad and lemon dressing.  We also ordered the Sake Mussels which had some of the best sauce on mussels I have ever tasted and was a good dish to share around the table. My only qualm? - there was no crusty bread to soak up the extra sauce... there's the European in me coming out :)  While we also ordered hot dishes, the waitress insisted that we receive our sashimi and maki mono rolls first as to not ruin our palettes.

The rolls were equally fantastic and while we tried most of the rolls on the menu, the Hamachi Maguro Ebi and Double Sake rolls were table favorites.  After stuffing ourselves with raw fish, out came our hot dishes of Braised Short Rib Donburri and the must try Arami Ramen. The short ribs were tender and flavorful and melt in your mouth, and I will be craving that ramen come the depths of the Chicago winter.  Finally, we finished off the meal with a serving of the fig ice cream.  Add in some wine, beer, and cocktails split between 5 people, it came to only $50 a person. Now that's a good first dining club.  Arami was just shy of five stars for me because of the noise level. We sat inside and it was often difficult to hear the person across the table from you.",0.9902,0.852,0.125,0.023,0.5944570135746607

2011-09-06,5.0,"Best sushi in Chicago. I was shocked. Arami is on a pretty nondescript block of Chicago Ave, and if you blink you'll easily drive past. Coming in here I was quite underwhelmed. The ambiance of the place left something to be desired. It's a little on the loud side and we were moved from one wobbly table to another wobbly table.  I also felt the place was a little cramped, but once the food started coming I forgot all about these minor inconveniences. The Chef's choice sashimi was great, beautiful presentation and the fish tasted so fresh I wondered if Arami had a secret wormhole from Chicago to the ocean.  Also sampled several different rolls, the spicy salmon with shrimp tempura being my favorite.  The salmon just melts in your mouth. I was also pleasantly surprised by Armi's oysters ( 4 for $12). They put the sauce on the oysters for you, which I usually despise, but at Arami it worked perfectly. The mignonette sauce was great and Arami's wasabi sauce mimicked the tang of horseradish to great effect.  I wasn't overly impressed with the cocktails. Arami features a wide selection of sundry Asian alcohols, which if you're not familiar with before you go, you probably won't get much enjoyment out of. The cocktails we tried were ok, but nothing wowed me. I'd say come with a buzz on already and save a buck or two. It gets expensive at Arami, so come prepared to drop some dough on one of the best sushi experiences you'll have in Chicago. Oh, and free street parking on a Friday night around 9:30 was a cinch.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.",0.9952,0.721,0.216,0.063,0.5557291666666667

Reservations are easy to make via yelp (and recommended, it gets busy!), so we were all set for our dinner celebration in a jiff. The ambiance is very zen, with crisp lines and very clean and earthy feels to the space. The patio looked particularly green and lovely, but alas, we dined indoors. It is a bit loud inside, so it might be a little difficult for a date, but for our party of four, it was perfect. Starting with a lovely crisp sauvignon blanc, our palates were ready for some food. Mussels? Yes, please. Plentiful and absolutely delicious. For three girls, it was more than enough. The toro tartar bite wasn't half bad either. We also shared the grilled baby tako (yum), soft shell tempura (standard, but tasty), hamachi maguro ebi (YUM), and the shrimp tempura asparagus (double YUM). The fish was very fresh and beautifully presented. We all were extremely pleased with the food. In lieu of dessert, we all opted for a cocktail. We enjoyed the special cocktail (with blueberry and lychee), the ginger moon, and the shiso crazy. Thumbs up! I'd skip the wine next time and enjoy a cocktail or two. Even our non-sushi lovin' lady friend found something to enjoy (braised short rib)...and gave it a thumbs up. She also made her own veggie maki, which is a really nice option for those who don't do raw. My tips: -Bring a few friends to try more items. You'll be glad you did. -Skip the wine and go for the cocktails. They're really delish. -Save your pennies. It ain't cheap. -Make a reservation.

2011-08-12,5.0,"Arami has a delicious Chef's choice sashimi that I love, and is also presented gorgeously.  I've had it in a large fish bowl, with a banana leaf and stones, and also on a platter of three smaller glasses.  The fish is incredibly fresh and they tend to have a more refined selection of fish like hirame and kampachi, than other sushi restaurants might choose to serve.  Their other special sashimi have all been good as well, they have things like the secret hamachi with truffle oil.  I am not a big fan of their ramen, but I have very specific requirements when it comes to ramen, and if it's not daikokuya or santouka ramen, I tend to not like it. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, with two somewhat separate rooms and a patio (I think).  The front room, where the bar and the host station are located, is more spacious and more quiet than the back room.  I prefer the back room with the sushi bar.  They serve gelato from Black Dog Gelato, and their sesame fig chocolate gelato is my absolute favorite flavor. It's creamy, it's nutty, there's the crunch of the chocolate pieces inside...

For starters we had the special Bonita fish - it was so delicious, the fish literally melted in your mouth. Next we had the Tuna Tartar Bite - delicious, but we both agreed the texture was a bit too mushy. We then had the Spicy Tako Spingroll and O-M-G! It was absolutely delicious, my personal favorite of the night. It was super fresh and light, the Octopus was tasty and the dipping sauce provided a nice kick at the end! Our final starter of the night was the Togarshi Seared Tuna - another wow! The tuna was seared to perfection and the seaweed salad/kelp noodles it was placed on top of was delicious. It was topped with this creamy mayo dressing that was superb. My date wanted to lick the plate - literally. We then moved on to the special sashimi and we got the Chef's Choice. I cant remember everything we had, but it was probably the freshest, tastiest, most delicious sashimi I have had. They serve it in this fish bowl, with rocks and leaves for decoration, which was fun I thought.  Our FINAL selection of the night was the Ramen. We had the Arami - with pork belly, braised beef and a poached egg! Obviously, anything with a poached egg makes it that much better. The broth was very beefy and the Pork Belly was insane. The flavor profile on this dish was just spot on. We shared the bowl and there was enough for a 2nd or 3rd helping.  I would DEFINITELY recommend coming to this place.

2011-08-01,4.0,"My husband and I enjoyed this great new find in West Town - he felt it was the most delicious sushi he had in Chicago in a long time. This restaurant piqued my interest after the write-up in Chicago Magazine. Had the chef's selection of sashimi which were 16 cuts presented in a unique, vase-like presentation. Many different types of fish were offered: including daily specials like: kampachi, sea trout, fluke, etc. I tried the ramen with pork belly and beef. The ramen noodles tasted like they were home-made - delicious, though the broth was a little salty for my taste. Enjoyed the seared hotate and the toro tartare bite. Finished up with a specialty unagi roll - the unagi quality was such a pleasant surprise and really stood out. Drink menu also offers some specialty, boutique Japanese beers that I haven't seen before. A little pricey, but worth a try if you are a fan of sushi and want to try something different than the usual Chicago places - it is easily a $100-ish dinner for 2. Enjoyed the interior - a very bright, open dining room featuring neutral colored brick,  light coming in from skylights, and dining offered on an outdoor patio (so many of the sushi restaurants in the area have dim lighting/ultra trendy vibe).

2011-07-25,3.0,"I have to say that I am very mixed on Arami. I wish I could assign separate stars for food, atmosphere, service and overall value.  Food - 4.5 stars - we had a cold appetizer (spicy octopus spring roll), sashimi (garlic salmon), a couple of rolls (spicy tuna and hamachi maguro ebi), and shared an order of the Arami Ramen noodles (the ones with pork belly). The fish in the sushi/sashimi was super fresh (which you would absolutely expect at this price point) and the rolls were very delicate. But the noodles were by far my favorite - completely unlike anything I've had before. Note that the noodles are very rich and are definitely large enough to share.  Atmosphere - 2 stars - we sat in the very small courtyard in the back and it is so crammed that we felt awkward NOT talking to the people at the table next to us. They may as well have pushed all the tables together, as the 1-2 inches in between really don't make any difference. Also the main fringe seems to be in the separate building past the courtyard, so the chefs have to go in and out of it frequently. So overall, not your spot if you are looking for an intimate/romantic dinner experience. Service - 3 stars at best - a bit on the slower side, which was ok for us (except for the part where it took about 20 min to take our drink orders), but it was also inattentive. Case in point - 2 of us got seated at a table with only one place setting - no big deal, we figured they'll fix it sooner or later. But when they brought out our appetizers and left, I had to finally ask for a plate and some chopsticks. Also, we ordered appetizers first and asked for a few minutes to make further selections. No problem, said our server, and didn't come back until AFTER we were through with our appetizers (they have someone other than your server bring out the food)...  Overall value - with the exception of the noodles, I couldn't help but feel being ripped off. Sure, sushi is always pricey, and sushi in Chicago is no exception, but up to $7.00 for ONE piece of sushi, and $8.00 for TWO pieces of sashimi - come on, give me a break! The drinks are also not cheap, so overall dinner for two was $110. This would have been bearable, if the service was top notch and the atmosphere didn't feel like a very cramped back yard of a standard Chicago city lot.

You're vain if you do it too often, but you kind of have to do it once in a while to make sure you don't have shit on your face.  While perusing my page for new UFCs (yeah, I may as well have entered a fucking beauty contest, what of it), I noticed my last three reviews are for Yelp Elite events. Even for a questionable character such as myself, this was a pretty grim observation.  So here I am, reviewing a sushi restaurant. I'll qualify my review with this: I'm not a connoisseur of sushi. It's usually my third-to-last choice in terms of food groups, right before balut and other embryo-based foods. It's not that I particularly mind sushi itself, but I kind of despise soy sauce, so I have to get the rolls with a bunch of stuff in them or get something more straightforward and put comical amounts of wasabi on. In the latter instances, people generally flee the table as tears flow from my eyes and I start violently shaking in nasal pain.  Arami is a good place to get some more creative fish dishes that don't involve wasabi-induced seizures. It's a bit on the pricey side, and the Rising Sun cocktail I ordered on my last visit (my personal code of ethics dictates that I have to order any cocktail with Hum in it) was on the weak end.

2011-06-22,5.0,"I have to say that it has been quite some time since I've felt the absolute need to write a review for a restaurant.  Arami passes with an easy 5 star rating in my book and here are the reasons why.. 1. FOOD - should be pretty obvious right?  you typically go out to eat to get great food, but it's not always that easy.  well arami makes it that easy.  every single bite of everything that my boyfriend and i tasted was delightful, interesting, well balanced and properly thought out.  the fish they serve up is the freshest i've eaten in as long as i can remember.  my top favorites were the uni shooters, toro tar-tare bites, tako spring rolls and maguro kani.  they also offer red sea eel which is something i've never even heard of before and actually didn't get an opportunity to try but i will be back for it!  the only down side i'd have to add is that they don't serve escolar which is my absolute favorite and must have for when eating sushi.  oh well, trust me everything else made up for it. 2. SERVICE - from the time we were greeted at the door with what seemed to be a warm & genuine smile from the host to the time we said our last goodbyes to our server laura our service was solid and nothing short of spectacular.  food flowed out in a pace in which i enjoyed, lighter items first then carrying on to dishes a little heavier in richness and overall flavor.  i have to admit the beginning started out a bit slow but they were packed to the hilt and we even received a complimentary appetizer (the togarashi seared tuna, yum!) while we waited for our first course. 3. AMBIANCE & PRESENTATION - arami itself is a small and inviting space with a slightly modern look.  while at the same time achieving a comfortable, warm atmosphere.  the exposed brick is a nice touch as well but i'd have to say my favorite aspect was the outdoor patio.  very quaint and very relaxing on a nice summer day.  presentation is also something these folks don't take lightly.  the plating and variety of colors are impressive without seeming boastful. all in all, if i were made of money i'd probably eat here once a week.  because i'm not i may have to settle for once a month.  maybe twice if i can get my boyfriend to foot the bill ;)",0.9985,0.765,0.225,0.01,0.5417800453514738

Awesome beer selection....there are some Japanese beers here that I've only seen at one other place in chicago. We had the togarashi seared tuna which was delicious, the mushroom salad that was fresh and interesting. We also ordered the arami ramen (my Japanese buddy says, 'it's a proper bowl of ramen!!'). The ramen had wonderful pieces of pork belly, shredded beef, fish cakes and I believe it's in a mushroom broth.  The secret hamachi was a delicious twist on 2 pieces of hamachi....they were topped w/ tiny mushrooms, I believe and drizzled with truffle oil.  YUM!  We got hamachi maguro ebi and soft shell crab and spicy ebi rolls.......so fresh and picturesque! The maguro kani was TO DIE FOR!!!!  Spicy king crab wrapped w/ a fresh piece of tuna and topped w/ toasted almond slices. It is heaven in 1 piece of sushi!! The shocker is that the spicy crab inside is warm, so you have warm, cold, and crunchy deliciousness all in 1 bite!!

We started with the toro tartare bite, served on a white spoon.  Fresh and with a delicate smoked finish, the bite melted in my mouth.  It was also hot that day, but I think it would melt in your mouth in most climates, for the record. The shiro anago (white sea eel) was sweet on the tongue initially but broke down to a very good eel taste.  The secret hamachi, as a special sashimi, was very complex for sashimi.  The hamachi was nice and fresh, and the mushroom shavings on top were tossed in truffle oil for a perfectly complimentary texture and flavor.   We only had one special maki mono.  The flavors in the double sake paired perfectly together.  At a restaurant with such fresh fish, I was reluctant to order a maki with mayonnaise on it, as I felt it would distract from the pure flavors of the fish.  This lemon mayo was delicate and instead enhanced the flavors of the fish in this roll.  I highly recommend this roll.   The negi hamachi and spicy maguro maki rolls were good and fresh, but they were not special like the other items we ordered.   I look forward to returning to Arami with anyone who likes sushi, whether they are a purist or not.  Arami can teach all types of sushi eaters to appreciate the delicacy of flavor pairing with fresh rolls and dishes.   As soon as you walk out, you will want to turn around again and walk back in for more.",0.9931,0.736,0.195,0.069,0.502718253968254

But, the presentation was very cool - a wooden box filled w/ ice, blanketed by a leaf which was topped by a spoonful of the appetizer and accented w/ a couple of flower petals.

Lunch traffic is light so they keep the back closed off -- at least on the day we were there so we sat at the front at one of the five or six high tops. It was lunch on a Thursday and it was delightful. There was one waitress working who also served as the bartender which is fine because she handled both jobs very well. She was very nice and made excellent suggestions.  We ordered a couple of cocktails and they were as delicious as they were pretty to look at. My favorite was Nigata River with funaguchi kikusui sake & cucumber. It was served rocks in a champagne flute with slivers of cucumber lining the glass. The cocktail is smooth and refreshing with the subtle taste of cucumber. If you're like me and don't like your cocktails too sweet you will love this.  We ordered several rolls and all were impeccable in freshness and flavor. This cannot be overstated. I love soy and lots of wasabi but the waitress suggested we try the Hamachi Maguro EBI yellow tail, tuna, scallion, jalapeno, shrimp, spicy mayo sans soy. I was hesitant but gave it a shot and WOW. The flavor was so layered and everything complemented each other so well. I highly recommend this roll. The Spicy Maguro tuna, chili oil, scallions was another stand out. I always order spicy tuna and the ""spicy"" aspect often seems to be lacking. At Arami it is right on with just the right amount of subtle heat - and again with the freshness!

The last time I went, my mother and I basically just got something from every section of the menu to share.  Their specialty rolls are awesome, and even though I scoffed at the ""chef's suggestion"" of forgoing soy sauce, it was totally the right thing to do.  Why mask such incredible, fresh flavors with soy sauce?   Yeah, it's a little more expensive than a lot of other sushi places, but you are paying for higher quality fish and higher quality service.  Our server, Allie, was seriously on her game.  She was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu without seeming pretentious in the slightest. People who talk smack about the ""small portions"" or that they use too much rice are full of garbage and wouldn't know high quality sushi if it bit them in the ass.  Butterfly is a half mile east, kids, hop on the #66 and open up a table at Arami for me because I will definitely be back again soon.

Perhaps they thought it'd be hidden in the excessive amount of rice in the rolls? 2. The rice. Rolls are pretty small, but they're also over a third filled with rice. I can find white rice elsewhere, for much cheaper.  3. To piggyback on the rice, the serving size of the fish is abysmally small. No delicious, melt in your mouth sashimi/fish, frankly out of the 4 different pieces I tried, you could only distinguish the fish in one of them. Though I wouldn't claim to have a super palate, admittedly. 4. I don't understand why they put rocks in the soy sauce dish, but then serve sushi small enough that you could drop the whole piece in the dish on either side of the rock. Shrug. I don't use soy sauce, but it struck me as a disconnect. My SO claims that if they served better fish, he might treat it as such. 5. The entrance smells like a fish market located 500 miles from the nearest body of water that has their fish driven in over a two day time period in sweltering sunlight.  I was really overwhelmed by the putrid smell when I walked in; fortunately, this was absent from the back dining area.  The edamame was really good. The service was mediocre but not terrible.

Tip: Ask your server for their selection recommendations to create a flow and balance of flavors that will elevate your experience.  This is where the magic happens. Space: The design is genius.  The layout and materials absorb the spaces energy to maintain it's cool-chic atmosphere.  To create a warm environment around a flurry of activity and sound cannot be easy to achieve.  It was greatly appreciated as I was dining solo. Food: I enjoy trying new things and Arami had plenty to offer.  With several items on the menu I wasn't familiar with I asked a few of the staff for their recommendations.  In addition to recommendations they curated the order to create a flow of flavors like I'd never experienced. #lifechaging Tip 2:  If arriving by car get 2 hours on the parking meter.

On Saturday my fiancé wanted to take me to a sushi place he had heard about.  Now, he's not a HUGE sushi guy (I usually have to twist his arm to have a sushi night) so I was a little leery of him suggesting we have a  date at a sushi place i had never heard of. After our meal, I was adding yet another reason to the list of millions of why I'm marrying this guy. This was the best sushi I've ever had. It was sushi heaven. I hear it gets super crowded - we didn't have to deal with this since we got there right at 6:00 (with a reservation).  Once we found the place (we walked right past it initially) we sat at the tiny bar to have a cocktail.  I had the Nigata River - a cold sake/cucumber cocktail served in a champagne glass.  It was very refreshing & yummy. After drinks, we were led to the main seating area.  It is a really simple, clean & airy space.  It was sunny out so the skylights provided great natural lighting.  I thought it was super cute. My man had done his research and knew that the first thing we should order was the Togarashi Seared Tuna.  It was simply out of this world. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the kelp salad underneath was delicious.  Next we had the Uni Shooters that were served beautifully in a vase filled with ice and an orchid.  The shooters went down so smoothly.  I could have definitely indulged in a few more. Additionally we ordered: 1 of each of the specialty sashimi (wow, the combinations were executed perfectly - every bite was a pleasant surprise); softshell tempura (best soft shell crab i've eaten); and a piece each of rare eel nigiri which was on the specials for the night.   To compliment our meal we ordered a bottle of the  Tamajinman Tamrei - Circle of Pride, Sake. It was a perfect light Sake for a Sake novice like me.

2011-04-25,2.0,"I really wanted to like Arami but my whole experience there was very blah.  The fish was alright, but felt overworked and a lot of the garnishes on their nigiri and maki overpowered the actual flavors of the fish. The portions were TINY. $4 for a small sliver of salmon seems a little silly. BUT, I could have forgiven the somewhat mediocre food and chalked it up to poor ordering on my part had it not been compounded by the seriously mediocre service.  The BF and I were there on a Saturday night and they were busy but not over extended by any means. Our waitress appeared very attentive and helpful to the two tables surrounding us (seated so close that we would have to pause our conversation so that they could hear her whenever she came over to deliver their food or check on them) but that was definitely not the case for us. We had to repeatedly ask her for things- water, drink reorders, spoons, bowls, soy sauce...  Now, I know the chef recommends skipping soy sauce on certain things but come on, sometimes you just want a little bit of soy for your plain ebi sashimi and there is no reason to reason to scoff at your customers requests or simply ignore them because you think they're ridiculous. Just give me what I want. That's your job.  She offered absolutely no explanation of the menu or the items we had ordered when she brought them to the table (let alone which items were meant to be eaten without soy). We asked her specifically about the oyster donburi, what is was, how it was prepared, etc. and the only thing she could tell us was that it was oysters and that donburi is usually served at the end of the meal. Um, thanks, very helpful. (Sidenote- the oyster donburi is pretty awful. Three small, overly greasy panko fried oysters on a mountain of white rice served with a too sweet sauce.)  To top off our unsatisfying meal, when she brought out our credit card receipt there was no pen to sign with and she just disappeared. We had to borrow a pen from the neighboring table after 15 minutes of waiting for her to return just so we could sign our receipt and get out of there.

The Togarashi Seared Tuna appetizer is one of the most popular items on the menu.  One bite and you will understand why.  Thinly sliced tuna, just slightly cooked to perfection, is served over a bed of seaweed salad and lightly drizzled with meyer lemon dressing.  The dressing provides a little spice but does not overpower the tuna.  It is the perfect portion size for sharing. I have also ordered selections from the sashimi menu and always find myself returning to four cuts in particular: salmon, hamachi yellow tail, shiro anago, and king crab.  The sashimi cuts are thin, fresh, and melt in your mouth.    The shiro anago (white eel) is best served nigiri-style.  And please, for the love of God, do not use soy sauce!  I have never even SEEN this on a menu in New York, and I've been to some upscale sushi places.  It is sweet, but more in the way a white fish is sweet, rather than the typical eel.

2011-03-23,1.0,"1. Service was terrible, I think our waitress was having a meltdown. 2. There was a group of obnoxious girls having a birthday extravaganza and they were so loud that nobody in the restaurant could carry on a conversation. I understand that they were having a party, but the restaurant should have accommodated them a little better so that they could rage without impacting the experience of the other patrons in a negative way. 3. PET PEEVE - never got any water when we sat down. Finally we asked for it and got it about halfway through the meal. 4.Call me old fashioned, but I enjoy eating soup with a spoon. When my soup came out without the spoon, I asked the server for one. She said ""we normally don't bring out spoons with the soup"" and then made a gesture as if she was drinking from the soup bowl. WTF? In hindsight, I'm not sure if I was more annoyed because I had to drink my soup OR because the waitress made me feel like I just rolled out of a trailer park and I didn't have enough common sense to realize that in 2011 people don't use soup spoons anymore.  5. Manager/hostess/owner (not sure who this guy was) basically blew me off when I calmly (and in a very polite fashion) told him that my ears were bleeding due to the screeching noises coming from table 12 . 6. Overpriced - sure, my food came out on hunks of slate with exotic flowers and what not....but that just didn't compensate for the prices here.  Oh well, I gave it a try.

2011-03-22,5.0,"6 stars!!! probably should be reviewing other places i've never reviewed but just can't say enough about this place!! Had the omakase with chef BK Park for a special bday celebration and it was such an amazing experience. Definitely something worth going for, for a special occasion. The service was so attuned to you and obviously the chef dedicates his time to your tasting. The plating of every dish was so beautiful and to see it all in action (you sit right next to his station) was even more magical. Fish was so fresh. No soy sauce needed. No gobs of wasabi needed. Just perfection!! Hotate (scallop) sushi was my favorite.  Followed by sweet ebi with a searing of spicy mayo with their version of salsa.  The sashimi spread was heaven (red snapper, two types of fatty toro, a marinated salmon, kampachi YUM!).    Of note, this is not ""traditional"" sushi -- he takes the traditional amazing fresh catch and puts a new twist to enhance the flavor of the fish.  Not overwhelming and not taking away from the texture and flavor of the fish.   Chef BK Park is a perfectionist and true artist!  Amazing to experience his master.    Can't say enough, must DO IT, if you're a sushi lover.

2011-03-19,5.0,"My friend and I came here after finals week because our ""usual"" sushi place was closed for the night. A note of advice: make a reservation. We went at 7 pm on a Tuesday, and the place was pretty packed. We got squeezed in at the end of the sushi bar, thankfully, but it is a very busy restaurant. Our waitress was delightful - sweet, attentive, knowledgeable, and gracious. When we had questions about the fish, she was very helpful offering suggestions and recommendations and afterwards, was continuously checking on us to make sure we were enjoying the food. She went out of her way to make us comfortable and aware, which I truly appreciated. The sushi chefs were lovely as well. There were about five of them in a line, all busy in keeping up with the demand, but the one directly in front of us made sure to take a moment to ask us how we were enjoying the food. All in all - excellent service! So here's my next piece of advice: come here early. All of the uni had sold out before we even arrived, which was very disappointing to me. I had been looking forward to trying the uni shooter. Alas, next time, I suppose. Also, midway through the meal, we asked if we could have two more pieces of the goma saba (blue mackerel) that we had ordered earlier, but those had sold out too! I confess, it was a tiny bit heart-breaking... As you can imagine then, the food was simply sublime. I started with the special hamachi sashimi. Two pieces of delicately sliced fish draped over a smooth stone and garnished with tiny mushrooms and truffle oil. It was heaven. You've not had hamachi until you've had it with truffle oil, I'll just leave it at that. Afterwards, our nigiri was brought to us, beautifully plated, each one as perfectly delicious as the last. The meal was fairly expensive because practically every piece of nigiri I ordered was at least $4 each, and I'll admit I didn't leave the restaurant completely full. On the other hand, I do think it was worth it. I've been to other sushi restaurants where I've spent less money and have felt ripped off due to a lack in quality.  Quality is one thing that this place has, and in every aspect. Great service, great food, great environment. The ambience was very nice, very mellow and elegant. They were also playing dubstep (albeit at a lower volume), which I found somewhat amusing. All in all, everything was perfect, and this is definitely a place that I'll be going back to, regardless of how long it takes to get there.",0.9991,0.712,0.255,0.032,0.5422264739229025

2011-03-14,5.0,"I brought my sister here to kick off her annual visit to the city.  We had a wonderful dinner!  I could only snag a 5:30 reservation on opentable day-of, so we went early.  The place was virtually empty, and we were seated in the back area.  I love the space--it is very airy, with a sunroom-like feel.  Eating here in the summer will be fun! We both got glasses of wine--she had a sauvingnon blanc from NZ and I had Gran Sarao cava.  Both were exactly what we expected. Our favorites of the night were the sake garlic sashimi, which lots have written about already.  The salmon is nice and rich, and the garlic vinaigrette offsets that perfectly.  The presentation on a smooth stone is beautiful.  We also really loved the saba nigiri, with a dab of a ginger mixture on top that went perfectly with the strongly flavored (but very fresh) fish.  We tried the shiro anago toward the end of the meal, following a suggestion from our really friendly server.  She said it's different from the aka anago, which is prepared similarly to unagi.  The shiro anago is marinated in sake and meyer lemon and has a little sea salt on it.  It was absolute heaven, with a gentle but complex flavor profile.  The togarashi seared tuna with kelp salad was another favorite--the creamy meyer lemon was so addictively good with the slightly spicy, fruity tuna.  Addictive. A few of our selections were a little less outstanding, but none were bad.  I didn't care for the kampachi too much--just didn't wow me.  The king crab geungkang sushi, which was topped with the crab and toasted almonds, and wrapped with tuna, was good but not as awe-inspiring as I was hoping.  I liked the king oyster mushroom nigiri special, but I don't think my sister cared for it as much.  Kudos to them for offering a good variety of interesting veggie sushi!  We don't get that everywhere! If I had one minor complaint, it would be that their rice is pretty vinegary and can fall apart a little.  I prefer a little more sweet and sour balance, I guess, and I like my sushi rice very sticky and springy.  I don't know if that's how it's ""supposed"" to be, but in a perfect world, that's the way it would be!  If only we could pair such outstanding fish with outstanding rice, it would be absolutely perfect!  I can't wait to visit Arami again.",0.9984,0.739,0.235,0.025,0.5867200328407226

2011-03-04,5.0,"""B-K san, table 111 wants to know if they can have the omakase.  They said they are willing to wait...""  ~waitress Madeline to Chef BK Park. And so the night went.  I know that this review is a little late; I actually dined here with my girlfriend on the evening of February 20th in an early celebration of her birthday.  Onwards... Location: 4 out of 5 In a very unassuming part of the Ukrainian village, Arami is actually quite accessible via main modes of transportation.  Chicago or Damen bus are easy public transportation options, and if you must take the interstate, coming north is not a problem as you can get off at Augusta quite easily.  Street parking is cheap and plentiful. Decor: 4 out of 5 Seemingly, Arami occupies the ground floor of a low rise building, presumably with residents that live upstairs.  As others have mentioned, the door is actually quite austere, and I had to double check to make sure that indeed, it was the restaurant.  Once you get in, the foyer (which seats maybe...12 or 15) leads into a hallway that turns into the main dining room.  The walls are cream in color with hand drawn, simplistic green mountains and valleys.  The main dining room in the back is greenhouse-like, as others have said; additionally, tables leave a small, but adequate thoroughfare for other guests.  The joy of dining here, however - is at the sushi bar, in the presence of Chef BK.  This leads me to my next category. Service: 5 out of 5 I can fathom how when this restaurant were new, they might have had to work out some of the kinks with service.  None of the waitstaff I encountered seemed to be ""traditionally"" or ""professionally"" trained in the literal sense of the word.  Instead, the waitstaff was a good mix of well-grounded, quasi hipster folk.  It was clear that they were all conforming to some type of dress code and performance code, but the flexibility around the edges was welcome, and unobtrusive.  Mid day on the evening of our reservation, I got a reminder call from the restaurant, and upon entering the restaurant, we were sat on the edge of the bar, offering us a prime view of BK's work.  Madeline, who seemed to be our dedicated server for the evening - was soft spoken, familiar, and very quick to refill water and drinks.   As a matter of fact, I have nothing negative to say about the waitstaff. Quality of food: 10 out of 5. Yes, clearly the rating is hyperbole.  Each dish we had was not only high quality and taste, but also in portion size.  I watched BK quickly dispatch a whole fish, and muttered in amazement as I saw him throw away fillet pieces that other restaurants would have used without blinking an eye.  Quickly, our omakase consisted of: sake steamed clams in lemongrass broth; degustation of maki salad with crab, eel, asparagus, etc. wrapped in cucumber; trifecta of cold apps (fatty toro shooter, bonito, and spicy tako roll); quinfecta of sashimi (yellow jack, red snapper, house marinated salmon, medium fatty tuna toro, full fatty tuna toro); warm seared cod; fluke; garlic salmon; yellowtail with truffle oil; ebi with seared mayo butter and truffle oil; salmon with monkfish roe; two types of warm eel; rice, king crab, and almonds rapped inside salmon; and a hand roll made with top quality nori.  Each course was decadent, and I'd like to point out a few things that were interesting: a) Super fatty toro is almost like eating butter.  It's not a bad thing, but I prefer the  medium fatty toro. b) If I had the resources, I'd use truffle oil on everything c) Monkfish are so ugly that their roe are acidic.  Not in a negative way, but it was an interesting taste d) The garlic salmon sushi was superb.  Probably the best nigiri I had. e) People don't usually associate bonito as an eating fish.  It gets thrown back if you're a fisherman, and at best, you flake it and use it as a garnish.  Arami managed to make it taste good.  Wowzers. f) There is a distinct difference in cheap nori and expensive nori.  The hand roll at the end was definitely on the high end of the spectrum.   Presentation of food: 10 out of 5 A picture says 1000 words.  Check my pics.   Pricing: 3 out of 5 D'oh.  Tax and tip brought the total to 300 on the dot.  But consider the fact that I had two of the watermelon infused sakes (14 each), we both had a Samurai H20 (8 each) and she had an additional glass of sake (9 or so), I think I calculated that pre-tax and pre-tip, the omakase itself was between 80 and 90 pp.  Not unreasonable, but Arami does offer an extended version as well.  Price unknown to me.   Overall: 5 out of 5 Excellent experience.  I read an interview with BK where he says, paraphrased, that ""fish is simple, but must be treated well from start to finish.""  It's clear from watching him that he's a true artist in this field who treats his canvas with the utmost of respect and creativity.  His intense energy comes out through his work, and I'm glad to have witnessed/tasted it.",0.9993,0.828,0.163,0.009,0.45408709425950805

2011-01-30,2.0,"In two words: not impressed.   I was really excited to try Arami based on a friend's recommendation. We went on a recent Saturday night with another sushi-loving couple.  All four of us found that the service was rude (and just plain weird) and that it permeated our entire experience.   We had a reservation at 7:30.  We arrived at 7:30 but probably didn't sit down until close to 8.  Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.  Even more annoying that they didn't offer to comp us a drink (or a corkage fee - more on that later) or an appetizer for our patience. When we finally got seated, we sat for a good 5-10 minutes without any drink or food menus.  Another strike.  And mind you, we were about 3 feet away from the bar and 7 feet away from the hostess stand.  It's not hard to tell that a table doesn't have any drinks or menus. Mistakenly thinking that Arami was still BYOB, we had brought 2 bottles of wine with us.  We explained to the hostess upon arriving (and seeing the full bar) that we thought they were still BYOB based on the Yelp site (which says Alcohol: none).  She said she was sorry and that the corkage fee was now $25/bottle.  After buying some drinks from the bar while we waited, we decided to go ahead and drink our bottles with dinner (mainly because we didn't want to carry them around with us all night).  And, as they said they would, they charged us the full $25/bottle for each bottle.  Not a huge deal either if our waitress hadn't been so snooty and rude about it.  Surely they have had this come up before---you'd think they would be proactive about it and change the Yelp page and website (or at the very least, laugh with you and express some sort of human emotion -- we just got an off stare and a rude comment). Now - on to the food. It was fine.  Not great. The fish was fresh and everything was very light (sometimes bordering on bland).  We had the tuna tartare appetizer (a little too mushy for me), the sake mussels (fine but a little bland), the king crab wrapped with tuna (very good - favorite of the night), a negi hamachi roll (very good), hamachi with truffle oil (not as much flavor as I expected, which is a feat for a dish with truffle oil), and two specialty rolls - the hamachi ebi (spicy) and the double sake (just okay).   The bottom line is there are too many good sushi restaurants in Chicago to put up with weird and rude service.  I won't be back.",0.9629,0.83,0.101,0.07,0.5926854551344349

I was already made aware that they put little stones in the serving dishes for soy sauce prior to coming here ( I know people waste, and 'the chef recommends no soy sauce"" this I know). First problem: I made reservations for two at 8:45 (I called ahead of time all old school-like, and spoke to a real person three hours before). When we arrived ON TIME I was told that the table wasn't ready and we'd have to wait 20 minutes or take a seat at the sushi bar in 15. Why did you take my reservation? And yes my fine Yelpers I have worked as a manager in a very busy restaurant, and understand life, logic, and reason. They offered no compensation or apologizes for this... We waited for our table, and then were brought to the bar seat any way 20 minutes later?

The water came about 5 minutes later, and then the server 5 after that. Ok you're busy here.     Second problem: The menu has descent options but no room for substitute (fast sushi 'just like in Japan' I see). So the miso came quickly, and hunger pangs subsided, low-glycosed melt down cancelled. Then then nigiri and sushi followed. Of course, '...Chef recommends, no soy.' I'm aware of sushi purist as well.

As for the food, we ordered a variety of maki, including spicy octopus and a special roll that was served with a tangy ginger-apple dressing. Everything was delicious. The presentation was fine, although all around us our fellow diners all seemed to have ordered much more elaborately plated dishes, with orchids and glass globes and quite a bit of drama. We kept wondering about what we were missing. Maybe we're just boring. We had no problem getting a table for three on a Tuesday with a reservation.

2010-12-09,5.0,"Arami caught us by surprise. Located in an unsuspecting neighborhood for sushi, Arami really is a gem. We were there on a weeknight and that place was bustling. We ordered sashimi. That's the best way to judge the freshness of the fish as compared to when the fish is mixed into maki rolls along with other ingredients. If there was one thing that was memorable to our sashimi experience, it was how they were presented. Clearly our sashimi platter reflected the effort that the sushi chef took to decorate it. The props took up more than half the platter and there were fresh flowers (orchids and another flower type) to embellish the platter. We ordered 12 slices of sashimi of various kinds and while everything could have easily fit onto one platter (since you know, sashimi tends to be dainty slices) we were served two platters: 8 slices on one plate, 4 slices on the other plate. The decor took up 2/3 of each plate. It was beautiful. We could sense the next table (who did not get sashimi!) glancing at our well adorned platters and commenting that they were pretty. The sashimi was very fresh. Excellent. A combination of both beautiful presentation + fresh sashimi. Excellent.  We had the hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar). That's our favorite item in general and among the many hamachi kamas we've had in Chicago, I really I really liked the one we had in Arami. The fish was soft and moist. It was also drizzled with a bit of sweet-tasting soy sauce which I absolutely loved. I'm dreaming of it while I type this. The ramen. OK I get why some reviews below are not big on their ramen. First of all, if you expect their ramen to be traditional, then you will be disappointed. The taste of Arami ramen is by no means like the traditional shoyu ramen or shio ramen. But maybe the intention was not to make it traditional that's why it's called Arami ramen and not shoyu ramen or shio ramen. Maybe it's Arami's twist on ramen. So I'm not going to hate on the ramen just because it doesn't taste traditional. A spin (or fusion, if you will) on a traditional food like ramen can be good if executed the right way. The broth of Arami ramen is very rich and intensely flavored. The amount of braised pork in the ramen was generous. They've also managed to perfectly prepare the eggs like how it is supposed to be like in ramen: solid egg white, runny/soft yolk. The green tea was very fragrant with a hint of jasmine tea scent, which made me think their green tea was actually green+jasmine tea. Each of our cups was individually prepared with each cup having it's own strainer filled with tea leaves and hot water to brew. They have quite a good variety of sake as well. As important as the quality of food is, Arami also doesn't forget to bring out the prettiness of food. We will definitely be back. And oh yeah, street parking was a breeze.

Chef B.K. has been a well recognized chef in Chicago for quite some time anf this is his creation. I think it is not accurate to qualify this place just as ""Sushi"": certainly you can get all the normal fare of a sushi restaurant and they are great!  But where it excels is in the Chef's creations which are a mix of classic Japanese and other influences (many French classic ideas adapted to Japanese). The sake mussels are a must as well as the Tuna+monkfish foie gras.  But the Salmon Sake roll is just OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Leeche sorbet to finish is also subtle and delicious.

The caviar on top of the tuna is the perfect complement. We also tried the baby octopus spring roll, which was cut and presented in the form of a maki roll (basically substituting the rice for cilantro/greens). Again another rich and unique dish, something you won't find at your typical sushi restaurant.  We also tried the Arami Ramen, the first time I've tried ramen and I thought it was really good. The noodles had a great consistency to them and the pork belly, beef and other ingredients were plentiful. Kind of pricey for $15 and the broth, as some others have noted was a touch on the salty side, but it was still an enjoyable dish I would get again.  The sushi was phenomenal. All the fish was as fresh as I've had in the area and the one specialty roll I had the Hamachi Magura Ebi was unique and memorable. The sushi was topped with a pico de gallo type salsa and surprisingly complemented the fish and other ingredients, which resulted in a roll that was not only delicious, but also quite memorable.  Despite the pricey items, there are some cheaper alternatives which averages everything out and given the quality of the food and BYOB, it is a good value for what you are getting.

I walked into the Arami to what seems to be an empty restaurant at 7pm, but the real suprise is the actual dining room is in back.  The decor of the room and ceiling is made out of wood and provided a very cabin like feel.  Half of the ceiling was on a slant and decorated with windows, which allows sun to shine through during the day. Nice touch.  1 star. The service:  extremely friendly and overly attentive but that's never a bad thing.  1 star. We ordered the 2 Arami ramens, 1 Toro Tartar Bite, and also an ebi tempura maki. Ramen: Nice thick broth but was way too salty.  The noodles were clumped up together, so either 1) it has been sitting out too long after it was cooked or 2) the soup was not hot enough.  I think both.  The ramen was disappointing and not worth what they were charging. The Toro Tartar Bite:  Beautifully presented in a tiny white spoon, topped with caviar and something else (possibly fruit).  It was ok, nothing to rave about and definitely look better than it tasted. The ebi tempura maki was average, at best. Hot tea is not free here.  Keep that in mind if you're one who is used to drinking complimentary green tea at Japanese restaurants.  However, they do have a unique selection.

Everyone was sweet as pie, the hostess, servers, bartender and the owner and the chef even popped by to say hello.....love!  Anyway, down to business.....we got the Toro Tuna Bites.....which were a nice start to the meal but not a necessity.....however, the Togarashi Seared Tuna....is a must order!! Seared tuna, seaweed salad, kelp noodle, creamy meyer lemon dressing.....I could have easily eaten a whole bowl of just the seaweed, noodles and the delish creamy dressing! We also got some otoro & sake sashimi, a hamachi maguro ebi roll, a spicy tuna roll (they do it the way I like...chili oil....no mayo), the Secret Hamachi sashimi (yellow tail, mushroom, truffle oil) and the show stopper.........the Maguro Kani. Do not miss this! It's been 2 months since I've eaten here and I am still thinking about this little nugget of amazing-ness!! In the end, even with all that.....I knew bf was still going to be hungry so we also ordered the Arami Ramen......I am a huge ramen fan.....and I have to say this is some of the best ramen I've had in the city. Broth was deep, dark, flavorful and delicious......generous pork and noodles were perfection!! I cannot wait until they start serving lunch......it will be my new noodle stop. Overall......great experience.....can be a little pricy but food is def worth it.....Arami you had me at Konnichiwa! PS: They serve Black Dog Gelato for dessert!!!",0.9858,0.882,0.11,0.009,0.506962481962482
2010-11-06,3.0,"The sushi is fresh and delicious.  The Hamachi Maguro Ebi roll, the Secret Hamachi sashimi with truffle oil, and the Sake Garlic salmon were flavorful and so fresh.  I keep mentioning the freshness, but it is noticeable in their sushi and made a huge difference in the flavor.   The main reason I went here for dinner was for ramen.  It was a cold day and I wanted something warm and comforting.  We ordered the Arami Ramen with pork belly and braised beef.  I did not love the ramen, and this is why I'm giving Arami three instead of four stars.  I thought it could be more flavorful and the portion size a bit small for $15. My husband and I ended up spending around $30 per person without drinks (it is BYOB for now).  However, we left hungry.  We could have easily spent over $100 here if we felt like eating to our heart's content with no mind on cost.  However, it wasn't one of those nights for us. The place is a bit small, but the ambiance is nice.  I enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs put together very interesting presentations of the sushi (think dried flowers, glass globes, and glass tubes filled with orchids).  Our waitress was great.",0.9866,0.793,0.176,0.031,0.6066666666666667
2010-11-05,4.0,"This place was sooooooo good.   1st - the fish was super duper fresh and amazing 2nd - the rolls were INCREDIBLE!   I'm usually a fan of nigiri or sashimi over maki.  Arami is one of the few places I've been to that used the ingredients in their rolls to enhance rather than mask the taste of the fish.  They did an amazing job heightening the fresh fish flavors rather than covering it with tempera and (ugh) creamcheese.  (but, seriously, why Chicagoans insiston on putting creamcheese in sushi is totally beyond me)  I actually think I liked the rolls better than the nigiri --- which is a first for me! We had the following: Togarashi Seared Tuna Double Sake Hamachi Maguro Ebi Spicy Maguro plus three special nigiri: Kanpachi Hamachi Hirame I think the double Sake roll was my favorite.  It was all delicious! BYOB kept the prices down, but it was still pretty expensive. My only complaint was the rice.  It was undercooked, not sticky enough, and didn't have enough vinegar.  But that is such a minor detail in the grand scheme of awesomeness!",0.9764,0.809,0.17,0.021,0.5320932539682539

2010-10-29,5.0,"I'm only giving this place 5 stars because that's the highest Yelp! will let me rate something. But to say it's 5 stars doesn't do it justice. It deserves like 38. My friend knows the owner, so I wasn't surprised when he came over and greeted us. He's absolutely wonderful. I was surprised, however, to watch Ty (the owner) deliver food to several tables himself. You can see how much he legitimately cares about his restaurant, the entire time I was there (about two hours) he was constantly observing his diners to make sure everyone was satisfied. It's a true testament to a good restaurant. Okay, so now onto the food. We told the chef to just go nuts because we trusted his judgment. With that, he grinned and whipped up a toro tartar bite, and an uni shooter for each of us. First of all... this isn't food. It's art, plain and simple. From the presentation down to the taste, it cannot be described as anything else. The tar tar bite is AMAZING. You eat it and want 50 more. And the uni shooter... I mean, it's essentially a shot glass filled with seafood and liquid. It looks terrifying. And then you shoot it and are so pleasantly surprised you don't even know what to do with yourself. Its a perfect splash of flavor that sets you up for what follows. Next, the mussels. Oh, the mussels. They come hot in a bowl, drenched in broth. I saw that other Yelpers had said that they drank the broth and I thought that was kind of weird... and then I did the same thing. It's just so good. Bring on the sushi. We had about 12 pieces of sashimi, each one was perfectly unique and fabulous. I realize calling sashimi unique is weird, because its a piece of fish on rice, but the chef paired it with subtle flavors like apple or ginger and it was just incredible. The fish literally melted in my mouth. We kept trying to pick a favorite and had to stop because it wasn't possible. We ended the sashimi with two pieces of Unagi, and I HATE unagi and liked this.  We were on such an incredible food high that we ordered two rolls after this was all done (double sake and something else that is escaping me) and they were both AWESOME.  Best meal I've ever had.

2010-10-27,2.0,"This could be 2 1/2 stars right now, but I rounded down.  They are still hitting their stride, and hopefully things will improve.  So, let me break it down... Space.  The restaurant is in a long narrow typical Chicago storefront.  You have to pretty much walk through the entire bar to get to the host/hostess.  There isn't a good spot to stand and wait.  The space right in front of the bar, while ample for standing, is also where the men's room is located.  The space after the front entryway, is where the women's room is located.  Not sure if this is temporary, but the bar shelf has a family shrine displayed.  With incense burning!  I have no issues with family shrines, or religious paraphernalia, or the Thai King's portrait.  But, I just don't think it is good for any restaurant to be burning anything scented.   The main dining room is reclaimed backyard space.  The acoustic was really bad with all the exposed brick, duct work, and hardwood surfaces.  The lighting also flickers at regular intervals.  Hopefully it's not some electrical problem.  Oh, and the men's room.  It is painted a sickly lime green, and a bonus faucet and drain area that is clearly for utility purposes.  You'd think they can at least somehow put up a partition. Service.  We snagged a space at the bar to wait.  A staff came by and asked if we wanted our wine opened.  We saw her broke the cork and pull half of it out.  She then called on another staff person to help.  10 minutes of grappling with the bottle between the 2 of them, we took out the rest of the cork ourselves.  We spent the rest of the evening fishing out cork debris from the wine glass.  We were offered a bar table that was stuck at a corner of the hallway.  When we said we'd rather sit in the dining room, we were then led to a 2-top, a minute later.  The 2-top next to us was empty as well, we noticed.  There were good dining room seats, but they tried to put us at a lousy bar table.  Even with reservations! Food.  The only saving grace was the food.  We had Toro Tartare Bite, Spicy Tako Springroll, Chef's Combination Sashimi, Oyster Katsu Don, Arami Ramen and Black Dog gelato.  The Tartare had a wonderful texture with a nice flavor from the house made soy sauce.  The Springroll is toothsome both on the octopus and the wrapper itself.  All dishes were painstakingly pretty in presentation.  The Chef's Sashimi was a study in ikebana.  Cuts of the fish though were on the stingy side.  The oyster katsu don was unusual, but the sweetness of the sauce masked a lot of the oyster flavor.  The ramen was the best thing of the evening.  Rich complex broth.  Better than Urabn Belly.  The special Black Dog gelato and sorbet was a nice cap to the meal. Why 2 stars?  Hope they improve over time.",0.995,0.78,0.153,0.067,0.5215916197623515

We also had the Kimchi Ramen (broth was fantastic), hamachi sashimi (great), spicy tuna (solid), and one special sashimi, the bonito (my least favorite dish of the night).  The great part about Arami is that there is such a focus on the fish without being too creative with rolls which definitely annoys me at some sushi restaurants.  The staff is great and knowledgable (letting you know when you should not use soy), the decor is really sleek without being pretentious, and Ill definitely be back while it is still BYOB.",0.9909,0.741,0.204,0.055,0.5678130511463844

Next time~! As soon as we set, we were welcomed by a sushi chef with a big smile on his face which made us feel whole lot better. he looked like japanese but they called him branden-san...so...i dunno....never heard of japanese name ""branden"" lol It was very busy for a restaurant that was only opened for few weeks now...that;s what the owner of the place told me...btw he was very helpful with explaing the meun for us...i believe his name was tie?

Next we tried Uni shooter.....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm uni~~~~~~~ the sauce had a similar taste with the tartarbite but a little lighter....adding a diced cucumber was an excellent idea imo. first sushi bar that I've seen that uses different sauce than ponju for their uni shooter....very interesting but very tasty at the same time~ :) chef's choice sashimi!!!!

As we were getting ready to leave, branden-san reached over to us again and made sure if everything was alright....I told him everything was FANTASTIC~! lol he smiled~ :) I'll be back with my family next time and seat at the table! maybe order a omakaze for my entire family!! lol Good service Great food 5 star",0.9991,0.742,0.228,0.03,0.5792857142857143

So why the three star rating? I guess my big issues with the place would be portion size and atmosphere. Let me preface this by saying i am usually a person that eats 1 roll and i am full. So our group of four split four of the specialty rolls and at the end i was still hungry. Whaaaa??? which leads me to the logical conclusion that their rolls must be smaller than average. ( although delicious). i honestly contemplated picking up a burrito on the way home.  the other issue i had is it is a bit chi chi. which is fine. But my miso soup didn't come with a spoon and like i know i know you are supposed to sip it straight from the bowl but i just feel dumb doing that. However i felt exponentially dumber when i asked for a spoon and was presented with a metal spoon that looked like it was meant for daintily sprinkling something as opposed to eating soup.  Also they have a rock in the soy sauce tray so "" you don't drown your roll in soy sauce"". apparently the owners have been wronged by soy sauce in the past.

A small storefront and bar area leads back into a deep sushi bar and restaurant filled with bustling people and beautiful food flowing out. Feeling semi-frugal, we skipped appetizers and went straight in for what many Yelpers had raved about - the ramen, along with a variety of different pieces of nigiri sushi.  (Upon reading the reviews, I see we should've gotten the mussels... we'll have to correct that in the future.) Arami Ramen - Tasty noodles with two wonderfully braised slices of pork belly, braised beef shreds, some naruto, and a perfectly cooked egg to top it off.  The broth itself was too salty (perhaps from simmering too long?) but otherwise, overall good dish.  The noodles are not made in house, as per the waitress's confession, but still quite good! The nigiri was fresh and excellent, and about par with prices of high end trendy sushi places in the city overall.  Flavored well and enjoyable, the shiro and aka anago (white and red seal eel, respectively) are two pieces that I have not seen in most other restaurants, and worth trying.  Zuke sake - A spicy scallop wrapped with marinated salmon was done quite well.  I'm curious as to the other special nigiri, and will have to make time to go out and eat again.

2010-09-25,1.0,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.  This place is truly and utterly terrible.  First, let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a ""portion"" guy.  I'm not someone who complains when a restaurant serves small, but delectable dishes and I don't expect to leave with with a doggy bag---because it's quality, not quantity that counts.  But Arami offers neither.  For the tune of $13, you get two PAPER THIN slices of tuna or salmon that practically dissolve in your mouth like a Listerine breath strip.  And worse yet, the sashimi is fishy and not even good quality.  And when Arami ventures beyond sushi into other areas of Japanese cuisine, it actually goes from bad to worse.  I ordered the ramen noodles which somehow managed to scientifically baffle me in their ability to smell so terrible and yet taste so bland.  Literally, the noodles smelled like pancakes smothered in too much syrup, but tasted like unsalted beef stock.  $80 later I actually left dinner MORE HUNGRY then when I arrived and had to go get a hot dog so that I didn't go to bed with an empty stomach.  And then there's all the other crap they pull.  Like the fact that the hostess ""accidentally"" gave away our table away for which we a reservation, even though we arrived 10 minutes early.  Or the fact that it took about 20 minutes just for the first dish to come out.  Or the fact that when I asked for soy sauce to go with our sushi rolls, the douchbag server prententiously informed me that their rolls are ""not intended"" to be served with soy sauce.  Well, that's fine and dandy, but when your fish tastes like rubber and is paired with a sauce that has no flavor, then I think you at least owe your customers the courtesy of giving them soy sauce when they ask for it. Coast is  better. Sushi wabi is better. Toro is better.  Hell, the sushi at Dominicks is probably comparable and at least appropriately priced.  Bottom line.

2010-09-17,4.0,"I have to prelude this review by saying that I have pretty high standards when it comes to food. My motto is that anything CAN be good, it just has to be done RIGHT.  There are a lot of sushi restaurants, many of those mediocre. Each component, from the fish and sauces to the all important rice, must be prepared with integrity and precision.  Amari, nice work! Not only was each ingredient by itself handled very well, the compositions were harmonious. Here is a run down of my meal...  Toro Tartare Bite - Hand cut, well seasoned, loved the pop of the caviar in my mouth as well as the additional depth of flavor it provided, sweetness of the Asian pear provided a good balance, buttery. A personal favorite cut of fish.  Aji Sashimi - Killer presentation (photo in my profile pics), Aji is a horse mackerel. I found the flavor to be pronounced, the fish slightly oily and the flesh firm. Dipping sauce provided was not too overpowering.  Tuna with Monk Fish Liver - Great cut of tuna, I LOVE liver in general and this piece was not a disappointment...well seasoned and oh so fresh.  Tuna Wrapped in King Crab - This was a winner for me. The toasted almond was a genius touch (crunchy and nutty), the sushi rice was seasoned perfectly adding that hint of sour I love, spicy mayo and the sweetness of the crab.  Insanely well balanced. Shrimp and Asparagus Tuna Roll - Thanks for bruleeing my nori flakes, mixing a perfect spicy mayo, adding tobiko to the minced tuna on top for that pop, and finally, thanks for one of the best tempura shrimp pieces ever!!!  Thick and tasty (no oily weak batter here), really stood up to the roll.  High five. Sake Mussels - Lovely liquid, tasted of the sea.  Finished the broth off using the shell as a spoon. :) Mochi Trio - Served with a fig and crushed pink peppercorn sprinkles.  Red bean (my favorite), green tea and mango.  Kind of hard to go wrong here.

Or go really early as there was no one in the place at 6:30, but by 7:30 this place was jumping and stayed busy until around 10. And this was on a Tuesday night!  So what is so special about Arami, the latest addition to this stretch of Chicago Ave where so many places are empty? FRESH FISH and friendly service, all in a space that has been redesigned from the old hookah bar that once graced these premises.  Open for about a month at my visit, we were greeted and took a seat at the bar (BYOB at this writing but I hear a liquor license is in the works) as there was really no space open in the place. If you go- ask for a table in the very back. As the front space is casual high tops with more of a bar feel, the middle is a long sushi bar and in the very back- is a smallish space under huge skylights which is where you want to sit if you can. Next year-they hope to have the patio beyond that open as well.  We started with the mussels. I had heard so many good things about these sake soaked wonders, that I was a bit disappointed with them when they showed up. They were basically flavorless. Hmm . . . I hoped the rest of the food was going to impress.  And impress, it did. We ordered several of their rolls from basic to fancy and they were all quite good. Couple those with the fish eggs that popped in your mouth and we were all smiling by the end of the meal. The soft shell crab roil as well as the hamachi and shrimp rolls were our favorites although they were all good with an interesting blend of flavors and textures.  For dessert- they brought out some ginger ice cream which was a nice ending to the meal.  They are still working out a few service hiccups but that is to be expected. They work on some kind of a team approach where everyone seems to be your server (but in some cases, no one is)  Lots of metered parking on this stretch of Chicago Ave.  So check it out.

2010-09-16,5.0,I would say that I have had good sushi before. That would be a total lie after tonight at Arami. OMG! Everything was amazing! I get the hype now and it is well deserved. The plate presentation was absolutely amazing. I have never really liked soft shell crab or Salmon before and I devoured both at Arami. The mussels are as good as advertised. The DOUBLE SAKE roll is a must! The tuna melted in my mouth. The food came out a bit slow but they were busy. Any person who would knock the service beause it is a little slow because they were busy is an idiot. Everything that we ordered was well worth the wait. Maybe it was just so good that we ate it too fast!  LOL Still many more items on the menu that I want to try very soon. And to those that said it was pricey.........are you kidding? Please stick to dollar value menus. Arami you guys ROCK in my book and I will deffinatly be back soon as well as spread the word. Congrats! P.S.

2010-08-31,5.0,"I don't quite know where to begin, because there are so many great things to say about Arami. First of all, it has beautiful, simple decor - I loved the exposed brick and the high ceilings with the skylights. All this gave it a very comfortable, airy feel. The space is also larger than your typical sushi place, which is great - I hate feeling like I'm eating on top of 10 other people.  There was not a thing we ate during this meal that was disappointing - I loved every bite. The fish was fresh and flavorful, which is so important. We started with the Toro Tartar bites, which were tiny, delicious, beautifully-presented bits of heaven. They provided the first of many ""don't talk to me right now, I'm savoring this"" moments that my friends and I had during this dinner. Next, we had an order of the secret hamachi sashimi with truffle oil and mushrooms, and it was also delicious. We followed the hamachi with two specialty rolls - unagi maguro and the hamachi maguro ebi. They were both just ridiculous. A word about sushi rolls - I feel like at most of the sushi places I frequent (even the good ones) there's an attitude of ""let's cram as much business into this roll as possible"". There's no doubt you're getting your money's worth, but this strategy leads to enormous pieces that you have to cram indelicately into your mouth, which diminishes my enjoyment of the experience somewhat (especially when I'm attempting the sushi cram maneuver in polite company). And while these rolls are normally very tasty, they tend to be kind of a mess of different flavors. Not the rolls at Arami. Each piece was the perfect size - no cramming required. The flavors were exquisitely balanced - no ""hey, let's throw in some cucumber and cilantro and a bunch of mayonnaise just because we can"" at this restaurant. You can tell the chef is an artist.  It should be said that my fish-phobic friend who ordered ramen and veggie nigiri tried the two rolls that we ordered, and loved them both - which is real testament to their deliciousness.  We also had several pieces of nigiri, all of which were delicious. The best by far was the red eel nigiri (can't remember the Japanese name). It was sweet and warm and full of flavor. It might have been the best thing I had all night, which is really saying something. All in all, one of the best sushi meals I've had! You'll be seeing a lot of me, Arami.

Four of us met for dinner at 8 p.m. on a Friday. The place was jumping already, but we got a table in the front. Then we just stared at the menu. I can't tell you what all we ordered, because we just kept ordering, but I do remember a few highlights: the grilled baby tako: a hot appetizer of grilled baby octopus on a lovely shredded salad. The grilled octopus was awesome by itself. The lovely salad was awesome by itself. Put both in your mouth at the same time: WOW. Just ... wow. We ordered three rolls for the table from the special maki menu: the double sake (salmon, scallions, spicy mayo and deliciousness),  the hamachi maguro ebi (yellowtail, jalapeno, shrimp and scallions and really nice heat) and an amazing, amazing shrimp tempura asparagus maki. This had a wonderful smokey flavor and was my favorite.  And then we just all ordered nigiri and sashimi that caught our fancy. When I tasted the akami ankimo, tuna with monkfish foie gras, I knew that I wanted to devote the rest of my life to sushi. The secret hamachi, yellow tail with mushroom and truffle oil, is super subtle with a lovely clean flavor.  At this point, they accidentally tried to deliver a bowl of the sake mussels to our table by mistake. We all stared wide-eyed and drooling as they carried it away to its rightful home. And then we ordered it. The wonders of Arami's sake mussels are well-documented on yelp. Trust the reviews.  The mussels are amazing.  Something needs to be said about the magical things BK does with veggie sushi. If you're like me, your experiences with veggie sushi have been uninspiring, probably. Never fear. Your veggie friends can enjoy gorgeously presented and tasty veggie sushi while you chow down on raw fish. I had the garlic and chive nigiri and the avocado nigiri. The avocado came with large slices of avocado, a couple of slivered almonds perched on top and a sweet-spicy sauce of some kind.  What did we have for dessert? The braised short rib donburi. One of my dining companions ordered it just for himself, but we sort of took over it. The server came back and said ""Wow. I've never seen a donburi go so fast."" It was melty and flavorful and warm. And happy. Have I mentioned happy? Then we found out they actually DID have dessert. Gelato! From Black Dog! We had a scoop of each of the two flavors they had: a lemony one that was like pie. Really. The best pie. And a plum moscato one that was the opposite of pie in the best way possible.  Bill: $160. Time: 3 hours.  Also, Arami is BYOB, and they have the wine list from Noble Grape on hand if you want to order a bottle to be delivered to you.",0.9994,0.728,0.253,0.019,0.6362332112332111

2010-08-23,5.0,"There is a god and he has graced me with BK Park's presence again! BK is a bit of a master, a sushi master.(ok, he's my sushi master/hero and any other exemplary word you can think of) There's just something about BK's beautiful platters that makes sushi THAT much better. You can tell that this man most certainly enjoys his art and has a passion for what he does. It is most easily illustrated by the beautiful sculptures of fish that grace your presence. The sushi here is amazing. All pieces come out on leaves that are placed on a foundation of ice pellets which calls for amazingly fresh sushi. Besides the great quality of the fish here, the presentation on ice makes it taste even fresher...alright heavenly. The sushi is so fresh here there is not a trace of ""fishy odor"" that I often find at all those thai/sushi places and a few other sushi places around the city.  You must try all of the special nigiris and sashimis. My favorite sashimi is the tuna w/ monkfish liver. If you're a sushi connoisseur, you have probably had this. Monkfish liver is pretty much the foie of the seafood world. Best part about the signature pieces is that no soy is needed because all the pieces come out seasoned in its own special sauce. (If I catch you dipping your pieces in soy, I will have to hit your hand with a ruler).  The regular ala carte pieces were also delightful. My amaebi was nice and sweet. The fried shrimp head came out and was amazingly easy to eat since the chef's prepared it by separating the pieces for you! (This is a first!) Try the anago! I love unagi sauce as much as the next guy, but the simplicity of the anago is one that cannot be surpassed. What I like about this piece is that you actually taste the eel and not just the sauce. If the 12 in Aji is available you have to get it. The only other place I've been able to get this at was Mirai (funny ... that's where I was introduce to BK's art). Here they serve it with ""chef's special sauce"" -- well worth the $20. The Uni Shooter here is spectacular! I order this often (probably because Uni and I have a inseparable relationship) and it is often too salty. Over here it is perfection. Light, crisp and buttery. The addition of the cucumber helps lightens the shot. What I like most about this shooter is that it isn't straight up salty, tangy ponzu. There's a lot of umami so this dish isn't so one-note like many other places. The Toro Tartar Bites are out of this world. It may seem a little expensive but a lot of work goes into mincing the fish perfectly. From my understanding you can't just toss the tuna in a food processor and call it a day. The chef's actually have to painstakingly hand mince and chop the fish to a fine paste. So if it's gone, it's gone for the day. The Hamachi Collar Bone is off the hook (no pun intended)! Perfectly grilled it comes out on a drizzle of sweet soy. mmmmmm yummmay! Alright .... the boring stuff Decor: The space is a bit on the smaller side but the skylight and french doors definitely make the space feel bigger. Otherwise, the decor is crisp and easy on the eye, which is what I like when I'm enjoying sushi.   The Sushi Bar is well lit and a great place to sit and watch BK work his magic.   The front of the restaurant houses the bar, but as far as I know this place is BYOB for the mean time. When I went the front was empty, which made the restaurant look a tad empty from the outside.

2010-08-14,5.0,"Arami exhibits all that I love about Japanese culture...its exactness, attention to detail, undying pursuit of culinary perfection, and appreciation for aesthetic.  Arami not only does all of these things, but it does them all well. What initally makes Arami stand out from the other Japanese sushi restaurants and itzakayas in Chicago (i.e. Katsu, Maku, Masu) is it's interior decor. The dining area is a beautiful open space with high, partially glass ceilings, exposed brick walls and bamboo tables/benches. A unique blend of contempory Japanese design with the urban Chicago style.  But the food is what truly makes Arami stand out. The maki rolls, nigiri and especially the sashimi were all outstanding. In fact, to illustrate...I normally do not order red snapper in Chicago or in most cities for that matter becuase I do not care for the texture and taste of lower grade red snapper. However, the snapper sashimi here at Arami was the exception to the rule...quite possiblty the best red snapper I have ever had...extremely fresh, soft texture, a light flavors - a wonderful treat. The owner said the snapper had been flown in that very day. In addition, the toro sashimi was outstanding and we loved the Zuke Sake (soy marinated salmon) nigiri.  I must add that the ramen was spetacular. We ordered the pork belly ramen (pork belly, braised beef, tsukemono, kamaboko, and egg).  In a city where finding good ramen is almost as hard as getting bleacher seats for a summer game at Wrigley (pre-2008 of course), I can't think of a single restaurant aside from Takashi that even comes close to the quality of ramen delivered here. While it seems like a lot of ingredients for a ramen dish, everything was added in moderation and the both exuded complexity and flavor - it reminded me of the great bowls of ramen noodle you can find tucked away in the streets of Tokyo. Finally we ended with the mochi ice cream which was fantastic. If you can discipline yourself enough not to over indulge on the fabulous raw fish prior to dessert, you will be rewarded with red bean, green tea, and mango mochi icream along with pieces of fig waiting for you at the meal's end. The mochi ice cream reminded me of the fatasic stuff you can get only in Hawaii. The service here was stellar, our server was very friendly, visited us frequenlty, and made sure our we had an exceptional experience. Overall we loved Arami, wonderful decor, great service, and awesome food. It definitely ranks among the top sushi restaurants in chicago and I shudder to say this, but I think the tuna we got here was actually better than at L2O!",0.999,0.757,0.226,0.017,0.530951476507032
2010-08-12,4.0,"Lesson of the day: How to eat mussels, Japanese style (works also for Belgian, French, Spanish, American, .... styles. In that case, skip step 1 and 2, or at least swap it with something more appropriate to your culinary travel of the day) Step 1 - Walk to Arami. If you are not lucky enough to live in within 2 blocks like me (me? boasting? no way) you can also ride your bike, drive and park around (you only have to pay in most streets until 6pm), take the #66, the Blue Line (and the #66) or even the Damen bus (#50). I am not responsible for other means of transportation. Enjoy the classy decor, very zen inspired and request a table at the back. Step 2 - order the secret hamachi (hey....pssst...it's not that secret.....it's on the menu). Two wonderful pieces of yellowtail, micro greens, mushrooms and truffle oil. Wonderful combination where all the ingredienst work very well together; no overpowering truffle taste. Clean and luscious. Great to prepare your palate. Step 3 - when your mussels arrive in their cute little vessel (a 'nabe' according to my knowledgeable hubby....I just think he watched too much ""Iron Chef Japan""), grab one with your fingers (it won't burn, promise) and detach the tasty mollusk from its shell. Leave the foot on (or eat if if you want, it's a free country) Step 4 - keep the empty shell. Use it as a pair of tongs to detach all the other little guys without having to touch them. Step 5 - lick the scallions, garlic, ginger and sake broth from your shells before tossing them in the garbage bowl.  Step 6 - try not to fight with your dining partner to get the last mussel. It's not polite and it might attract unwanted attention. Careful. Step 7 - use one of the discarded shell as a spoon (chopsticks won't do) to eat/drink/loudly slurp the remaining broth. Don't care if people stare, it's too damn good to pass. Step 8 - order another serving. Step 9 - come back home, dream all night about your dish and write a review to let the whole Yelpdom know that you (probably) found  your favorite mussels in Chicago. They don't come with fries (duh) but for $10 they are so delicious that I would gladly have them every week. The sake is a wonderful change from the usual wine or beer - it's rich, flavorful, slightly sweet and the combination with the scallions and ginger couldn't be better.

But ooooooooooooh that broth...  The flavor of the sake broth was incredible.  Truly was... I longed for some bread to go sop up that left over liquid, but without it, I used the tools that were given to me- the left over mussel shells.

My favorite part about the menu: it's primarily Japanese. Not ""Japanese for Americans."" Sure, there are some immigrant dishes and ingredients that crept their way onto the menu, but for the most part it's rooted in simple Japanese culinary techniques you see in Tokyo, not the crap  that was started in L.A. and permeated to the rest of the USA (i.e. the ""Monster Roll"" with soft shell crab, graham crackers, moth balls, cream cheese, dirty underwear, foie gras, tuna, wallpaper paste, jalapeño, and carrot that's covered with seared salmon, a cherry glaze and Spam® served atop a 32 oz. prime rib).  It's evident the Arami chef team knows how to identify quality fish. I've been twice, and both times the sushi has been top notch. The mussels are my favorite in the city. As one who likes to cook them from time to time, I appreciate the extra work done to ensure they are thoroughly cleaned (this challenges even the best chefs) and the steaming technique with the sake gives them great flavor. Ramen noodles...who doesn't like gourmet ramen noodles? Right now it's BYOB, but they will be getting a liquor license soon. Quite frankly, I enjoy BYOBs, so get it while you can.

Now on to the food. If you think that Japanese restaurants in Chicago are a dime a dozen, you would be correct, so it takes a lot to stand out. So far, the only places that stand out to me are Katsu on the Far North Side and Macku Sushi in Lincoln Park (of Kaze fame - by the Chan clan). Now, add Arami.  The beauty of the menu items at Arami is both in the taste and aesthetic of how the food is offered. The flavors of any dish are very vibrant, complex and multi-layered, yet the use of salt and soy, which often drown out the freshness and organic flavors of the fish or meat, is absolutely expert and not overwhelming. Each dish is expertly presented in a way that creates a bit of a conundrum - the presentation is so exquisite that it personally makes me not want to eat it just yet! A few things I had that were absolutely amazing: Toro bite - this was a beautiful small dish with succulent diced fatty tuna, presented on small spoon. Light, subtle flavors of onion and soy make this toro bite a perfect foray into the adventure of flavors to come at Arami. Uni shooter - a perfectly small sized shot glass with sea urchin, again with a light flavor that doesn't overwhelm the uni, yet perfectly complements it and hides the usual pungent taste. Again, perfection. Sake mussels - recently I went to Belgium and had the most amazing mussels, naturally. I was tempted to see how Arami used sake broth to make mussels. I must say these were every bit as good as the mussels in Belgium, if not better, mostly because the sake broth was so delicious. The broth had a subtle hint of sake, and everyone in my party picked up a mussel shell and used it as a spoon to lap up every last drop of the broth.  Special maki and nigiri - we had a nice assortment, and I have to say that the best thing about the special maki at Arami is that unlike almost every single place serving maki, Arami sticks with a few items, but executes it well but not drowning every maki roll in mayo and sauce, and also doesn't make the pieces so big that you can't fit them in your mouth. So, while the volume-seekers may be disappointed by the relatively smaller size of the maki here, the taste more than makes up for it. The quality of fish was also top notch - although we didn't really focus on nigiri or sashimi this time around. Ramen - Where to start with this... absolutely amazing and extraordinary. I've had lots and lots of ramen in my life, and this is hands down one of the best ramens I have *ever* had. The Arami Ramen has pork belly, a really nicely poached egg, and berkshire pork (organic from Ohio) soup base. Again, while this is one of the heavier ramens on the menu, it was neither over-salted or under-seasoned. The pork belly was just right, and the broth has a subtle herbal taste that balanced some of the natural saltiness of soy. The quality of the noodles was top notch and had the right consistency. All-in-all, I was more than pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, which is just down the street from where I live. I think once word-of-mouth gets out, people will really come to enjoy such an amazing addition to the Chicago dining scene. Like Macku, which is amazing in its own right, Arami has gotten off started on a very strong foot, and if it keeps up the quality of the food, it's well on its way to success. My only complaint is that it's so convenient to my house, so it will be extremely tempting not to want to go every few days!",0.9985,0.821,0.158,0.02,0.572580266955267
2010-08-05,5.0,"I wandered in w/o a reservation tonight, a Wednesday, at 7, and was seated at the sushi bar in 10 minutes after a genuine welcome by one of the owners and the hostess. The green tea was, somewhat unusually, a floral genmaicha, rather better than the excessively astringent bancha that most Japanese restaurants in the U.S. serve, although I personally would have preferred something more subtly flavored. I ordered several kinds of nigiri: hamachi, chuutoro and ootoro, sake, ikura, uni, botan ebi, and shima aji (a special). All the fish was very fresh and, just as importantly, the rice was sufficiently moist and acidic. (Cheap places always, always, get the rice wrong.) The nori accompanying the ikura and uni was still crisp - in fact, those two pieces were served separately, after the other nigiri, to ensure that when I ate them the nori wouldn't be soggy - a very nice touch. The botan ebi was topped with minced vegetables, among which were tomatoes, completely non-traditional but a good match. At the advice of my neighbor at the sushi bar, I also got two kinds of sashimi, the ""secret hamachi"", hamachi with truffle oil, mushroom, and kaiware, and, because it wasn't too off the wall, the ""sake garlic"", salmon with garlic, vinegar, and kaiware (there might have been some scallions in these, too). The non-traditional ingredients here, too, nicely complemented the fishes they were paired with, rather than overwhelming them. (I think it was kaiware these were served with - the waitress said it was oba, but I'm skeptical.) I also got the ""oyster katsu don"", deep fried oysters over rice with pickles, with  ponzu (I think) at the bottom of the bowl. The oysters were more lightly breaded than are most kaki furai, and the pickles and ponzu were, to my taste, a much better match for the oysters than the Bulldog tonkatsu sauce that usually accompanies kaki furai. I can't speak to the ramen, but it's willfully perverse to get anything but seafood here, given that it comprises 95% of the menu. That said, I quite liked the mochi ice cream I had for dessert, esp. the mango. The space itself is lovely, with high ceilings and lots of natural light. If I may be allowed to cavil: the droning BGM eventually grew tiresome, and the design of the sushi bar itself is such that I felt like I was separated from the sushi chefs by a wall.",0.9865,0.897,0.094,0.009,0.5987973137973136
2010-08-04,4.0,"(Review #100!) Another addition to the Raving for Ramen list as well. So, I'm not going to lie to you all. I have been cyber-stalking the opening of this place on Metromix's fairly accurate Countdown list. Why, you may ask? Well, as many decent options there are for sushi, Japanese-Thai sushi bars, and regular Japanese cuisine, I greedily want another close option. Secondly, I'm dying for another ramen option. Finally, BK Park also powers one of my favorite sushi-spots in the city, Mirai. So how did it all turn out? If you order green tea, you'll actually get it in loose leaf format, where you can control the amount of time it steeps. You'll want to take it out in about a minute and a half, unless you want it bitterer. It's a nice roasted green tea leaf flavor. Sushi-wise (sashimi-wise actually)  I sampled their maguro chutoro (medium fatty tuna) and the special hamachi sashimi. The chutoro was an excellent cut, served in 3 decent sized pieces. The special hamachi sashimi was a similar play to one of my favorite Mirai appetizers, the bin cho salad. Here, yellowtail is drizzled with truffle oil, and served with mushrooms. Do yourself a favor, and don't dip it in soy. Both came out really well, and i will definitely return to try more sushi, sashimi and maki. Now, the ramen: the Arami Ramen. This is essentially ramen noodles served in a very light soy or salt broth. (that's how light it was, I couldn't tell if it was a soy or salt broth, though I'm no expert.) The ramen is served with enoki mushrooms and thin-sliced fish cake and cucumbers. Not bad. The 3 stars of the bowl are the 3 different proteins that come together to bring the flavor to your mouth: an overhard poached egg, thin sliced (potentially lightly flavored) beef, and two good pieces of soft and tender pork belly. The noodles? Somewhat average. The broth? Okay, but not exceptional, and not in an overwhelming amount either. The 3 meats? Delightful. I wouldn't recommend it as an everyday dish, much like traditional ramen can be, but it can be quite a treat if you are in the mood for some flavor. Eventually, they plan to offer handmade desserts, and as such only offer mochi right now. Unless you are a huge forgiving fan of mochi, I would wait to see their real desert menu emerge. The service, staff and chefs were quite friendly and attentive. I'll update this review again, once I get a chance to try more things on the menu.",0.9898,0.84,0.13,0.03,0.5636945054945054
2010-08-04,5.0,"i absolutely love sushi as much as i love steak...but for whatever reason...neither are available in the ukie village area.  UNTIL NOW!  finally a an amazing sushi restaurant in my hood!  not only is arami a few blocks from where i live, but the sushi and food is amazing.  the menu has so many types of food and options outside of sushi, and alot of the dishes have great finishing touches and surprising tastes or flavors i was not expecting.  for instance, truffle oil and mushrooms with hamachi?  yes, believe it.  and it tasted amazing.  other goodies such as the scallops with unagi and mushrooms with miso & slow braised short rib donburi rice bowl were also killer.  and i have to echo comments on BK Park's awesomeness - i concur.  room and energy is very welcoming and relaxed.  no overly priced ""pay for pretentious scene first & sushi second"" vibe whatsoever.  very reasonably priced considering the high quality of their menu.  arami will definitely my new favorite sushi place to visit!!!",0.9916,0.698,0.245,0.057,0.5353151515151515
2010-08-03,5.0,"I love BK. Thanks for making the best Omakase ever for us.  The space is really nice, very green looking and feeling. The back of the restaurant is almost completely skylights, and they have a back patio I think they are planning on opening soon. Arami is still byob for now. The menu looked very nice, although we opted for Omakase, and I feel like we probably tried almost everything on the menu.  I think the prices were extremely reasonable when you take into account the quality of the fish and the awesomeness of BK. I can't wait to go back all the time, I'm so happy I moved nearby. Expect the population of east village and Ukrainian village to go way up so people can be closer to Arami.",0.9782,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.4575
