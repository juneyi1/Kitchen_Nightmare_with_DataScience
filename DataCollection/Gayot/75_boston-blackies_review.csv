They got me new wings and when they got to the table they were overly hard. I guess they wanted to make sure they were done this time. The server was at least nice this time. So I tipped him.

Everyone but me had been drinking but they were no where near drunk. Buzzed at best. Here is my story.... We (7 of us) walked up to the bar. We asked to be seated because of their drinking rules... The first thing the woman who greeted us (which later we found out was the manager) said was ""Don't yell in my ears"" and quickly brushed us off to the serving staff. (we were a little loud, but so was the rest of chicago....never greeted with a hello or welcome either).... the servers quickly pushed together tables for us. We immediately asked to be served by anyone but the manager. We had our drinks, paid our bill, and before we left we asked to speak to the GM. The manager from before comes over with a bad attitude and said ""They said you wanted to speak with me...why?"" We calmly and politely told her that the way that SHE acted towards us was rude and she was lacking in customer service. She quickly became EXTREMELY defensive and saying that we were drunk (which we were not), rude to her and that we immediately started pushing the tables together (no one touch the tables, the servers did). We had a little back and forth argument which ended her saying DIRECTLY to me and my 2 African-American friends: ""We should have never served you and your n****r friends"". We immediately walked away as soon as they called security on us for arguing with her for the past three minutes that ended in blatant  racism. We walked about two blocks down and I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the owner, when he picked up, I calmly explained what just had happened... he listened to my whole story, when I was done he said: ""Yeah, ok, have a good day"" and hung up.

Decided to go early to make sure we got a table.  We did get a table and pretty much could have sat at any table in the entire place.  When the game started, we counted a total of 8 people in the bar!  8!  That should have been our big clue but as it was looking like it was going to rain and we had a couple of pre-game drinks (they had a special for $5 beer and wine) we decided to stay.     We decided that we would also get something to eat.  Again, a special of any appetizer for $5 except for one that was like a selection of several items. Not wanting to get too much food we decided just to do a couple of apps each.  I got the onion rings (I saw someone else had them and they looked good and were clearly real onion rings vs. onion bits in the shape of a ring) and the rib eye sliders.  My friend got the chili and a ceaser salad. She said the chili was actually very good.  I'm not a fan of chili so I didn't have any.  The salad was super large and she said that was ok - nothing special. As for my apps, this is where things really pulled the rating down.  I of course wasn't expecting 4 star cuisine, but I would have expected a little bit more than what I got in terms of quality.  The onion rings showed up first and they do give generous portions.  It's served with a ranch sauce.  I tried the first one and it was cooked well - nice and crispy - but had an odd flavor to it.  I tried another and now there's an odd smell to go along with the odd flavor.  I asked my friend to try one and she said she tasted something odd as well and could smell what I was smelling.  It became evident to both of us that the oil they were using had passed it's prime and clearly was being used for many other things - MANY times.  It was bad.   The server - who spent much of her time talking to the 2-3 people that clearly were regulars vs. attending to anyone else, I was finally able to flag down.  I don't know if that annoyed her that I kind of exagerated getting her attention with my arms, but she finally came over and when I asked her just to smell the onion rings, she of course said ""Nope.  Smell perfectly fine to me.""  Please - in Botswana they could have smelled the odor!   So she takes them over to the manager who isn't doing much but watch the game and they have a little ""chat"" with their backs to us and of course he comes back to say they smell fine.  But he did offer to get something else which I politely declined figuring that I wasn't really up for more bad food. As for the sliders, they were B O R I N G!  You get 3 on a small bun and on each you get a small piece of fatty, grissly rib eye and.....that's it.  Nothing else.  No lettuce.  No pickle.  No tomato.  Just a small piece of well done ""meat"" on a dinner roll.  Whatever... So the food was a disappointment, the game was a disappointment (except for my dinner companion who happened to be from Boston and I'm sure is the reason we lost that night) and therefore I am going with 2 stars.  Nothing worthwhile here other than when they have specials on drink prices.   (I wonder if the reason it was empty that night is because it's call ""Boston"" Blackies?!?

2013-04-11,3.0,"I came here for a quick work lunch, and I wasn't impressed. We arrived around 11:45 on a Tuesday and the restaurant was bustling with business people and tourists alike. They wouldn't seat us until our entire party arrived, which seemed a bit annoying, but I understood considering how busy they were. Once our party of four was complete, we were seated and given menus. Our waiter came by, didn't welcome us or have any sort of introduction, and asked us what we would like to drink. The drinks came out shortly thereafter, and then he disappeared for about 15-20 minutes before coming back to take our order. This didn't really phase our group as we were deep in conversation, but I could see this being a problem if you needed a quick lunch spot. Regardless, I put in an order for the chopped salad with the balsamic dressing and added the grilled buffalo chicken for an extra $3.99. When the salad came out it looked fresh and delicious, and HUGE. There was at least a bag of mixed greens that you'd buy at the grocery store for each salad. There were ample toppings on the salad, but I noticed that it was missing the avocado. This was a huge disappointment to me that I wasn't able to point out to our waiter because he never came by to check on us. Although, that minor issue aside, the salad was generous and filling, and the buffalo chicken was a delicious addition.  I can't comment on their burgers, which I know are their claim to fame, but a lot of people were ordering them. If you're ever here and looking for a healthy alternative, I'd definitely recommend the chopped salad. The atmosphere was very loud, but it wasn't cumbersome to our business lunch.

Seriously, though, if you want to talk about injustice, one needs only look to the drink sizes at this location of Blackie's.  I was recently having a bad week and a wise girl told me, ""if life gives you lemons, drink vodka lemonade.""  So on a post-work outing, I tried to do just that.  For $6, they might have tried to put just a smidgen of vodka in my happy maker.  I mean, the beer specials aren't horrible (though the choices are basically Miller Lite and Miller Lite), but isn't the old saying, ""if your life's in the clear, then you should drink beer?""  I need a little bit stronger a drink sometimes!

(FYI:  The term ""happy hour"" originated in the United States Navy. In the 1920s, ""happy hour"" was slang for on-ship performances.  ""Happy"" in this context meant slightly drunk, but it didn't hit main stream America until after a 1959 Saturday Evening Post article coined the phrase..............useless trivia I know *grin*) Beer specials, as noted previously here, are bucket of beers.  Usually 5 or 6 at around $15 or so.  Other drink prices are comparable to establishments in the city.

The meat is a delicious mix of chuck and sirloin (oh yeah, I can tell) and I'm pretty sure there's some bread crumbs and worchestire sauce. You know how I know? Because excellent BBQ-masters and devoted fans of Steve Raichlen alike know that a good hamburger maintains composure without being soggy and gross by imitating meatloaf and meatballs! This is one awesome hamburger and at half a pound, it's not for the faint of heart. It's a minimalist burger without the superfluous toppings of a California style joint. Then there are the cottage fries they serve on the side. These are the greater and more obese cousin of the potato chip. Slightly thicker and salty while soft and almost creamy in the middle while crisp on the outside. When Governor's Pub used to be open on State/Lake, they had far superior cottage fries, but I can take what I can get when the going gets slim.  You know what is friggin fantastic?

Boston Blackie's for all it's blood and gore about burgers has one of the most amazing GRILLED PORTABELLA sandwiches. It's this cheesey grilled vegetable goodness that is a towering delight to the senses. It's a great change of pace for the burger fan too because these slices of Portabella mushroom are thick and huge.  The onion rings are great!
