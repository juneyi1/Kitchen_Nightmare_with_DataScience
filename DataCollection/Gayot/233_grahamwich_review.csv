The sandwiches are tasty and fresh, and the service was quick and friendly. I ordered the pastrami Reuben, my husband ordered the roast beef, and we split a roast beet salad. My only criticism is that the salad could have been less expensive and the roast beets didn't really taste roasted at all.

I ordered the Mediterranean Veggie, and was able to get it on wheat with the herbed oil on the side. The bread was perfectly crispy and buttery, which was amazing because I thought it would definitely be soggy from ordering ahead of time. The sandwich itself was great. Roasted red peppers and mushroom, goat cheese and greens, balsamic. There was some sort of spread on it as well that was amazingly delicious. I would say you could do without the herbed oil, as it did little to add anything to the meal (besides calories). It definitely needed a pinch of salt. I also ordered the potato salad. Your standard potato salad, but it definitely needed more salt and paprika (or some sort of spice). While leaving, I picked up a popcorn to go since I heard everyone raving about it.  They make it fresh to order which is great (not the popcorn, just adding the seasonings). It's heavy handed on the truffle oil and parmesan, and thankfully I'm a fan of both. The popcorn itself was stale, which was not appetizing.

First of all I waited 40 minutes before I was even able to order and then waited another 10 for my sandwich, which was a mediterranean veggie. It was good but doused in a bit too much gourmet balsamic. But my two star review comes not from the sandwich but from the wait time. I remember watching a show on food and restaurants and a world renowned chef saying that no restaurant is worth waiting 50 minutes for food, because there is something surely better down the way that is better without the wait. And that is true. But because I was already waiting 30 minutes I just thought ""ok"" I can do this. Fact is... I will not be visiting Gramwich again till they get themselves running more smoothly. Sure I could have ordered online (had I known) but they should be able to accommodate ""walk ins"" within a timely manor or tell customers they will be waiting for about an hour before they will get a sandwich. None the less the wait time is awful and the sandwiches pricy and if customers have to wait over 30 minutes that popcorn of yours should be free.  I can understand all the not so great reviews due to the slow service and yes they are not ""friendly"" but at least one of the guys behind the counter who handed me my sandwich to go said ""thank you for your patience"" as I bolted out the door, because I had blown my whole lunch hour just waiting for one overpriced sandwich.  So to sum it all up. If you want to wait for an hour and deal with a not so happy cashier (who looked a bit under trained) for an overly expensive sandwich then this is your place.

Maybe have one of your fellow tenants move out so you can knock down a wall and make your place bigger for more seating?  It sure can get crowded sometimes. Thank you to most of the staff for being so nice and service oriented.   It makes a big difference with all of the choices in Chicago.  There is one guy...you might know who he is who has a bit of ""attitude""...I am sure you have already asked him to be nicer and kinder.  Hope he takes your advice.

For example, I got a 'small pickle' and it ended up being a container of various vegetables that were pickled. I was not expecting this overly fancy pickle dish, I just wanted a normal pickle.

You know what I'm talking about right? When you're eating something so fantastically cheesy that it nearly takes your breath away? That was my experience with this sandwich.

2012-12-12,3.0,"visit  shutupandeatme.blogspot.…  for the entire review/pics. Most Chicago 'foodies' know who Graham Elliot is. He's the jovial, chubby judge on MasterChef, Two Michelin star chef extraordinaire, and apparently, makes one mean sandwich. The store front is very old-fashioned dineresque. Their 'claim to fame' is supposedly having the best grilled cheese in the entire nation. After having the Pastrami Reuben and Waldorf Salad sandwiches, I'm sure that claim is a bit of a stretch. Don't get me wrong, everything was edible, and for the most part pretty good, but I was just a little... disappointed. As soon as we walked in the door, an almost awkward counter clerk peered at us through thick framed, over sized hipster glasses. His ""PLEASE believe me when I say that I'm an intellectual being"" vibe was a little uncomfortable, but it is what it is. By the way, what exactly is a hipster, and where the hell did they all come from? Anywho, we ordered with little guidance from the clerk. A couple recommendations would have been nice considering that it was clearly our first time as we gawked at the menu board, mouth agape. A hefty price nearly made me swallow my tongue. For 2 Sandwiches, a pickle, two sodas, and a small order of potato salad, we paid nearly 40 after tax. I mean, the sandwiches were good, but I could have gone to Patty McGenericIrishName's Pub and got a Reuben that was equally as good. The ratio of kraut to pastrami was off. There was a ton of meat and a little sauerkraut. Yeah, I know most people won't complain about too much meat, but I am. I'm all kinds of carnivorous. I just reeeeeaallllyyy like sauerkraut, which this Reuben was desperately lacking. I'd probably try something different the next time around. The Waldorf Chicken Salad Sandwich was alright. The grapes were so fresh and really good. I wish there were a little more in the mix, though. Honestly, the entire meal was lacking any depth in flavor, which isn't what I'd expect from a 2 Michelin Star Chef. The potato salad needed some serious salt, and maybe a little mustard to add something to the starchy, one note cubed potatoes. The best part of the meal was the pickle. It was so crisp and not overly sour or sweet. I could eat a cement truck full of them, granted if I had enough money to buy them at a dollar a piece. They were pretty small, so I found a dollar was a little ridiculous for a single, pinky-length pickle. A very delicious pinky-length pickle though. The root beer was very good as well. I mean, you can't go wrong with root beer, right? I'll probably visit grahamwich again, but the next time around I'll try something else. Hey, Graham! Stop in and visit this store... sample the potato salad. I'm pretty sure you'd agree that it needs a little help",0.9981,0.748,0.206,0.046,0.583388888888889
2012-12-09,2.0,"As a huge Masterchef and Graham Elliot fan I was excited to finally try Grahamwich as I've been to one of his other restaurants and I enjoyed it very much. I was severely let down however by this visit. We walked in around 11:30 with only 3 people in line. Two people ahead of us had a take out order consisting of 25 sandwiches for their office party so I was gearing up for a bit of a wait to eat. Fast forward 15 minutes later to when we finally even got to order, keeping in mind only 3 other people were in this entire place to begin with. I ordered the roast beef with the ranch and bacon chips while the person I was with ordered the cuban with cheddar bbq chips. I would have liked to order the potato salad but they were all out and then I went to order a bottle of water and was informed they were also out of that so I had to settle for a glass of warm tap water with no ice cube in sight. The person who was taking all of our orders was left to man the cash register all by himself but it was clear he was new and had no clue  what he was doing as he would have to wait for someone to come over from behind the counter to help him.  After 35 minutes of waiting I finally got my roast beef and it was pretty good. The grainy mustard and shoestring potatoes made the sandwich but it wasn't anything out of this world. It was actually kind of funny because I don't even like mustard and I thought that the mustard was the best part of the sandwich. The chips on the other hand were stale and tasteless and the smell they gave off reminded me of when you open the packets of instant potatoes. My friend who had the cuban thoroughly enjoyed her sandwich and chips. She even went as far as to say the cuban was the best she had ever had.  Even with the sandwiches being great I just couldn't get over the fact that a place right before the lunch rush could be out of potato salad and bottled water. By the time we actually got our sandwiches and finished eating their were about 20 people crammed around the cash register with the person taking orders still struggling, no place in sight for anyone else to sit down and the people with the 25 sandwich order still actually waiting for the last of their order to be finished. What upset me most was that right before we went to leave in walked a worker of some kind who waltz in past the long line and struggling worker taking orders, starts to brew himself an espresso behind the counter and then proceeds to sit against the counter and drink his espresso while the rest of the workers struggled to get orders out. To make the visit even more awkward when we went to leave we saw zero garbage's or places to return our tray and we didn't want to try and conquer the 20 person line to return our tray so we ended up just leaving our dirty tray where we were sitting because we didn't know what else to do with it. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon especially when I can get equally good food and better service from other places for half the price. My friend on the other hand says she'll be back again but only for a pick up order.",0.9929,0.826,0.118,0.057,0.5689152609842265
2012-12-07,2.0,"After checking into Hotel Palomar right down the street around 1pm, my eastern time zone tummy was ready for lunch, and my four female co-workers seemed to agree.  We stumbled upon Grahamwich and decided to give it a try.  We arrived at the opportune moment as a longer line began to form when we were ordering and waiting for our food. I ordered the Heirloom Turkey (turkey, cranberries, stuffing, brie and mayo on a pita) while my co-workers ordered two Mediterranean Veggies (veggies + goat cheese on flat bread), the Grilled Cheese, and a salad. Both the Mediterranean Veggies and the Grilled Cheese looked delicious, and I was quickly regretting my decision to order the Heirloom Turkey. The turkey had a nice flavor but was pretty dry. The top half of the pita was very bland -- all I could taste was dry turkey and plain pita. I was hoping that the bottom half would be better. Though the pita improved once I reached the cranberries and brie, I was still disappointed. Plus, the promised stuffing and mayo were essentially nonexistent. The restaurant is attractive and has a cool aesthetic but is very small with almost nonexistent seating. There are bars toward the front with seating for 10 or so people that were nearly full. The back of the restaurant had one family style table with awkwardly low and crowded leather ottomans to sit on. My team and I squeezed into a section of the table, but I found it very awkward to get up and down from it. While trying to get up from my seat and throw away my tray, I almost stumbled onto a baby in a stroller whose mom was sitting at the end of the table. Definitely not a kid friendly place... The wait time was probably 5-8 minutes for most of our meals though the Grilled Cheese probably took 15 mins. I was confused by this... if the Grilled Cheese is one of the specialties of the restaurant, why wouldn't it come out quickly? After eating our food, one of my co-workers decided to order a coffee beverage. All five of us stood waiting at the front of the restaurant while she ordered the drink and then we waited... and waited... and waited for that drink. I think it took five minutes to make a simple coffee drink. Though the restaurant is cute, I was overall unimpressed with the experience.

2012-11-07,4.0,"Flew into Chi-town and jones'n for a late pacific-time lunch (yeah, 4pm for lunch). Found Grahamwich courtesy of Yelp and thankfully had their address because there's no sign above the storefront (their little artful logo on the door is cool, but not visible across the street). Anyway, place was totally empty so we - me and my work colleague - had time to browse the menu unencumbered by a pressing crowd. Here are tips for those in a hurry: 1- Get the grilled cheese. Forget your lactose intolerance already or just take a Lac-taid. This stuff is awesome! Literally, buttered bread, crack, cheese, more crack, more cheese, tomato marmalade, crack, and buttered bread. Not sure what makes this so great, but it is. Share half with your work colleague because you feel badly he didn't order it.  - really, if two people come, one should order something else, then agree to split them. A half grilled cheese is enough to stop your heart. 2- They make their own homemade sodas. Get one. Sure, they serve the nectar of the Gods, Diet Coke, but you're gonna hit 7-11 around the corner for that 44oz-er later. Now is the time to take up your diabetic cross for all epicurean kind and drink 12-oz with some real sugar for a change. The root beer was sublime. 3- I know it's not breakfast time but get a German chocolate donut NOW! On my way out, I saw a donut in the case that looked like a weird chocolate old-fashioned (my go-to). A worker informed me that it was their German chocolate donut. Now, having just visited Voodoo Donuts in Portland two weeks ago, I wasn't about to let a sandwich shop trick me into getting a donut... until he gave it to me for free because it was closing time. ORDER THE DONUT. EAT. Thank me later. I'm finishing mine as I type this. Oh, and they take credit cards now (no Amex or Discover) so don't freak out about hitting an ATM.",0.9908,0.809,0.145,0.046,0.4837606837606839
2012-11-01,1.0,"After almost 22 months, I gave Grahamwich another shot.  And it's still (trilling the r's in my condescending, faux Spanish accent) CDDDDRRRRAP. I expect a high degree of polish from a chef who won a reality show...or whatever his claim to fame was. Metal food trays that are supposed to look like they're from a farmhouse diner look worn, dinged up and dirty.  I hope the paint they used on the trays is lead-free, because it looks like it's peeling.  It probably isn't, but still...the flea market/garage sale chic only looks good in those glossy ""Country Living"" magazines.  The only place I expect to see trays like that are southern roadhouses that serve drinks in mayonnaise jars.  I don't think a place like Grahamwich would stoop to that level, but I wouldn't bet against it in the future. The tacky-ass ATM machine is STILL in the front as you walk in.  Nothing says class like an out-of-state bank's ATM that gouges you a huge fee just to get the twenty note you'll need for an expensive meal here. They now take credit cards?  Oh thank heaven.  Grahamwich, welcome to 1975. This place still looks like it's in the middle of a rehab.  Are you going to fix up the interior so it doesn't look like you bought everything at flea markets, or not?  The wood is splitting in some places, the walls could use fresh paint, and the floor could use a good cleaning and a shine.  This place is not as fresh as I'd expect from--again, remind everyone--a chef who won a reality show...or whatever his claim to fame was. The food is not worth the expensive prices they charge either.  I noticed my tofu sandwich thing ($7) was sort of tasty, but it couldn't overcome the lousy, soggy pickles served in--I kid you, not--a plastic drink cup.  Oh, for the love of bejezus...spend some money and get something else to lay the pickles on for people who dine in.  Did they run out of something called, PLATES?  Yeah, plates...to have them might be a novelty in a place like this.  I paid $3 for six friggin' slices of wilted-looking pickles in a see-through plastic Solo-style drink cup. So Yelpers, go ahead and love this place as much as you want.  I'm done with them.  I won't be back...FO'EVAH.  Judging from the slow, dismal trickle of people ordering during what I thought would be a noon lunch rush, I doubt you'll have to stand in line for any length of time.",0.9976,0.773,0.197,0.03,0.5120454545454545

I work in customer service so I really respect and will always go back to places with superior customer service.  Even if the food isn't as great as I'd like it to be, great service is really hard to come by and should not be overlooked.  So today, when I walked in  at 1:15pm (just after lunch rush) to a sparsely populated restaurant, I figured grabbing a sandwich would be a pretty easy task. First of all, they were out of a bunch of stuff (ice cream, salads).  Second of all, I WAITED FOR 33 MINUTES FOR ONE SANDWICH - TO GO!  This is ridiculous.  When you are on the go and have a limited time for lunch every day, 33 minutes for a sandwich is unacceptable.  I might as well have ordered something on Grub Hub and had that delivered to my office.  It probably would have arrived faster. There wasn't a long line of people, it wasn't peak lunch rush, so what was the hold up?  The employees looked like they were just walking around doing whatever the hell they pleased.  There was NO sense of urgency whatsoever and the organization of the sandwich wrapping station was extremely off putting.  There was sticker paper left on top of people's completed sandwiches that were waiting to be wrapped up.  And the knife they use to cut the sandwiches in half is just that, A SINGLE KNIFE.  It's wiped off (barely) with a towel between slicing.  I have some severe food allergies so this makes me particularly nervous.  Honestly, SUBWAY does a better job of cleaning knives between sandwich cuttings.  SUBWAY! Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed and I will not be going back.  Not going back to a restaurant because of poor food is one thing.  Not going back because of poor service is just ridiculous.  The foundation of any service based business has to been great customer service.  If you treat your customers well, they will come back to you.  Take note, Grahamwich.",-0.5194,0.777,0.109,0.114,0.49070767195767195

I know.  Shock and awe.) But yet, it comes back to that. The turkey harvest sandwich, while decent, wasn't $9 good. For a half of a pita. And the pita was really thin and the avocado dressing was all crammed in the bottom so that it soaked through the pita, making the bread fall apart and I was left with a mound of messy meat, cheese, dressing, and soggy bread. Logistical fail. The flavors ideally would go well together , but given that I had to eat through a mound of sprouts sans dressing before I got to the meat and the cheese and the dressing, it wasn't really...working.  The boy's reuben failed a bit better in the ""holding it together"" department, but he's a volume eater. Hence, I braced myself for a hungry tantrum post-lunch.

The $6 salad was very mediocre.  A bunch of tasteless greens and cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices and a blah dressing.  No cheese, fruit, salt, pepper or crunch.  I suspect part of it was that salad doesn't taste very good when you are eating standing up, annoyed that you are waiting 25 minutes for a grilled cheese.     My $7 grilled cheese came at 12:24 am, after 7 people who ordered after me go their food.  The guy behind the counter apologized for taking so long and I'm pretty sure the massive cookie he put in my bag was a consolation for the long wait.  Either way, the cookie wasn't very good and it is way too big - the equivalent of 4 regular sized cookies.   The grilled cheese, I will admit, was stellar.  But since I was now late for getting back to work, I ate it while walking and spilled grease from the cheese on my tie, which I now have to get dry cleaned.  I don't blame Grahamwich for that, but it probably didn't help this review.

Upon entering, the first thing I thought was the guys working were dressed like modern-day newsies sporting trendy newsboy caps. We had checked out the menu prior to stopping in, so I already knew I was going with the grilled cheese and my fiance went with the waldorf chicken. Both were delicious. Yes, I did sneak a bite of his sandwich. How could I not? The tomato marmalade on my grilled cheese was amazing. Plus, they toss on white cheese curds to give you a little bit more cheesy deliciousness (and a bit more calories, but who cares about that!). We also tried the fresh-squeezed lemonade, which was not too sweet so I loved it.  As we waited for our order, I took time to survey the rest of the restaurant. It has a large table in the back and a few bar seats, most of which were filled with people enjoying their tasty sandwiches. Made me glad that we were taking ours to go. The other thing I was able to watch was the sandwich-making process. This was trouble because it made me want to try every other sandwich on the menu. The Southern BBQ looked phenomenal with huge cornbread crumbles. Overall, this was a solid stop during our weekend in Chicago.

This purple glazed donut sitting in their display case also caught my eye so I added that to my order as well. The sandwich was super fresh. The ingredients sounded very gourmet, but the sandwich didn;t taste that fancy. It just tasted flavorful and good. The ingredients were very fresh and the baguette was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. Super good! I don't think its $9 worth though. It seemed like what I was paying for was more for the quality and freshness of the sandwich. Plus, in the neighborhood that its in, I'm sure rent is expensive so they have to price things a little high. The donut was delicious! I'm not sure what kind of glaze was on it, I just know it tasted good and the dough was really soft and moist. The outside had a nice fried crust. I could eat a dozen of the stuff! The shop itself seemed a little small. There were stairs that led down, so I'm not sure if they have extra seating downstairs, but upstairs had one large communal table and counter seating by the register.

To me, the marmalade elevated the sandwich beyond just a regular ole' grill cheese. Also had the popcorn - awesome, great umami flavor with the truffle oil and black pepper. Chips were good too - reminded me of what a twice backed potato would taste like if it were turned into a chip!  The shop had a light, airy atmosphere and I like the respect they paid to the environment by using environmentally friendly plastics, reusable trays, etc.  I would like to try the other sandwiches and soft serve at some time, because they all sound good.

May not be great ingredients at taco bell, like at Grahamwich, but that friendly service just pushed the experience over the top!

I also find the lack of enough seating to be a problem as one can't eat gloppy sandwiches standing up, unless one wants to wear it as well as eat it.

2012-01-30,2.0,"My husband and I stopped here after several years watching Graham Elliott on Top Chef / Master Chef, convinced this would be the heaven of sandwich shops. By the end of lunch, we agreed if this is the best he's got, he shouldn't be judging others... ATMOSPHERE: Rather barren. The walls were colored primary white and yellow, and there was little else to look at. Reviews are right, there was no where to sit but a communal table, filled with 20-somethings who didn't seem to want to move their coats for us to sit down. Frustrating to be forced to share lunch next to a guy who ate his sandwich ""Guy Fieri"" style (elbows straight out, and in my face). It was a bit dismal.  FOOD: Interesting on the menu, but falls way short on the plate. We expected great things from a ""master"", but what we got (save for the fresh-baked bread), was an average sandwich I could have gotten anywhere else on the planet, and in many places for much less money. We had: (1) Southern BBQ Sandwich - Fell short on the promise. The meat was on the cold side (we pictured this as a warm sandwich, not sure if this was intentional or not). The cole slaw was tasteless, and the cornbread crumbles were, well... weird. Too mushy, and added nothing but strange texture. (2) Italian Grinder Sandwich - Again, missed the mark. I don't know where the ""pistachio mortadella"" was (maybe they were out this day), but it wasn't on my plate, or in my sandwich, and if it was they shouldn't have wasted their time. The sandwich was very sloppy, oily to the point I almost couldn't eat it for worry of spilling, but otherwise a far cry better than the BBQ above. Still, other than the bread it wasn't any better than Subway or  Jimmy John's, and for my money I prefer Jersey Mike's (which isn't saying much). (3) G'Wich Chips - Great concept, but very oily (the bag it comes in was saturated, and ours tasted like they'd been made 2 weeks ago. The flavor was mild, but after 5 chips became a little annoying. The chips had a strange powder on them that didn't wipe off your fingers, and turned me off. (4) Lemon Lime Soda - Meh. ""Make your own soda"" is a fantastic idea, but this version was $3.00, and I could have gotten more flavor from a 7Up at $1.25 at the local gas station. Being a soda fan, I'm not sure if the sandwich or the soda was the biggest dissapointment. (side note - they offer ""g'wich popcorn"", and according to the sign it's flavored with all sorts of grahamtacular seasonings, but we opted out because the popcorn looked stale, and smelled like every other popcorn). SERVICE: None really to speak of. The counter help was nice, they each said hello and goodbye, which we felt was a nice touch, but at no time did they make any suggestions, or add anything to the experience other than making the food so we didn't have to. VALUE: On the poor side, given what you get. The sandwiches were around $9.00 each, the soda and chips at $3.00, plus 10.25 % tax (!!!!) so the total lunch experience was just around $30.00 to be really, sadly underwhelmed. In summary, you're paying brand name prices and getting generic food. Worth the stop to see for yourself, but there is plenty better to be had in the area at much more reasonable pricing.",0.9839,0.783,0.131,0.086,0.4893601190476191

GREAT:   The interior is well done for such a small space.  Light, airy and modern with a view of what is probably (not so much now) a lovely outdoor space in back. Because I was there at such a weird time, I had the whole place to myself.   LIKE A BOSS. Staff was polite, order arrived quickly and nicely presented, and the music they were playing was fantastic. NOT SO GREAT: The giant communal table I sat at, while impressive in its size, would be quite irritating to me if the place was full and I had to mash myself in between 2 strangers.  Likewise with the space itself.  It is narrow and long and I feel with a ton of people it would easily get claustrophobic quickly.  The sandwich I got, the pastrami panini, was really just OK.  For the price it had good quality ingredients, but I would have loved some brown mustard or something to wake it up.  And since I was fully aware of the Grahamwich mantra of not making changes to anything ever, I didn't even bother to ask. The cider I ordered was given to me in the exact same size cup as a Starbucks tall.  But it cost as much as the sandwich!  And it wasn't even fancy cider either, not caramelized, sweetened, mulled or spiked.  Just plain old cider.  This was kind of a bummer.   But I would come back for sure, I would just make sure to come a bit later and skip that damnable cider!",0.9776,0.81,0.147,0.043,0.5487103174603175

Well, how about don't hide four slimy pieces of mushroom drenched in liquid smoke under a blanket of sour cream, smear it on a limp flatbread, and tell me I'm getting a gyro. Honestly. You may wonder why an overpriced sandwich inspires this level of disdain, but then, you might understand it if you ordered the ""portabella gyro,"" which, to be clear, I am not at all recommending that you do. This was the saddest possible incarnation of a gyro that I believe I have ever halfheartedly jabbed at with a spork. Let's work our way up from the base, which was composed of a flabby, gummy ""pita."" Then the aforementioned mushroom slices. The portabella mushroom, when treated with respect, is among the noblest and most delicious of fungi.  When cooked down to a chewy, slippery mess, it is basically the poster child for uninspired vegetarian cuisine.  But uninspired doesn't even scratch the surface. The mushrooms were tossed with mealy diced tomatoes and cucumbers, and then drenched in salty, saucy ""tzatziki."" The quality of the ingredients here is definitely problematic, but the real crime is in the proportions. What you are essentially getting, for eight dollars, is sauce on bread. Because the whole thing is so wet and sloppy, you have no hope of eating it folded as a gyro is meant to be eaten, and so you will be left picking the meager vegetables off the flatbread while feeling like an idiot for having obviously ordered the wrong thing. Which, after you think about it for a few minutes, you will come to realize is not your fault at all. Inconsistency is the name of the game at Grahamwich. And, if you're a vegetarian, you only have two options to begin with, both of which are lazy conceptually and in execution (The other one is grilled cheese. Yep. You can have a portabella mushroom sandwich, or a grilled cheese. Which verges on insulting.).  If you want mushrooms and cheese on a sandwich, go to Potbelly, where it costs half as much and tastes ten times better. Grahamwich, it's not me. It's you.

Their website is phenominal, their presentation is fantastic, and the atmosphere makes you feel like you should be paying $9 for a simple sandwich. When it comes down to it you probably shouldn't. I was debating between the Southern BBQ and the Italian Grinder. I went with the Italian Grinder considering it's a tried and true classic. I passed up going to Subway to try Grahamwich out and I wish I hadn't. And don't take that as ""I'm expecting a Subway-esque sandwich"". I was in the mood for a gourmet sandwich, and it wasn't one. The ""crusty baguette"" is a typical soft, mushy deli roll (read: not crusty) that you would get at a generic hole-in-the-wall deli, and the meats, while top quality, are applied sparingly. It's only about 6 inches long as well. The ""meat-to-bread ratio"" was pretty poor, and if you have a bunch of cakey, dry bread with a minimal amount of meats it doesn't matter how high quality they are, you're left wanting more. Also, for $9 bucks you think you would get a side of chips or at the very least a pickle or something. It's just the sandwich. For $4-$5 this sandwich would be acceptable. I still wouldn't order it again even at that price, but I wouldn't feel as if the overblown cost is predominantly attributed to the fantastic initial atmosphere of the place. I say initial because when I got there there was no music playing, and the only thing you would hear was the sandwich guy unpleasantly and borderline-angrily yelling people's order numbers as they were ready. I don't know how the other sandwiches are, It's usually pretty hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but I will hesitate before I give their sandwiches another chance, especially at such a high price point.

My visit there for lunch today was, in a word, disappointing.   Now, granted, I only had one sandwich, so maybe every other sandwich on the menu is mind-blowing, but somehow I doubt it. I had the ""lamb gyro,"" which was basically cold, shaved, rare lamb meat on what appeared to be a store-bought pita with a Greek salad on top.  Which is absolutely nothing like any gyro I've ever had.  I expected something different and better than your typical hole-in-the-wall gyro shop, but this incarnation of a ""gyro"" seems to have entirely missed the point.  None of the best qualities of a gyro were present, and things that have nothing to do with gyros were substituted in. Cons: No discernible seasoning on the meat. Tomatoes diced so small you couldn't taste them. Flaccid, cold pita. Very little tzatziki sauce. None of the crispy, spit-roasted edges on the meat. Meat was cold. Feta.  I love feta, but it doesn't belong on a gyro!!!  If the meat had any flavor at all, you wouldn't need a sharp, salty cheese.  As it is, because of the feta, you can't taste this mild, under-seasoned version of lamb at all. $9 Pros: It wasn't very big, so at least the taste and visual disappointment didn't  last too long. Tasted a little mint, which was, I thought, the only creative positive change from a real gyro. Other notes: Couldn't taste any onions.  I think that's a negative, but some people don't like onion so I won't list it as a Con. I'm all in favor of putting a spin on old classics, but when you ditch the things that make a classic classic, and bring in things that actively interfere with the core of the classic, it's a sign you don't know what you're doing. Beyond the food, the guy at the cash register was friendly, albeit considering there were only about 8 customers in the shop, half of which were already eating, the staff of four seemed quite slow.  I know Graham is going for a higher scale then Potbelly's, but I didn't see any reason they couldn't have turned out a cold sandwich that's mostly assembling pre-made ingredients as fast as Potbelly's make me a grilled sandwich. At any rate, I probably won't be back.  It wasn't so terrible that I wouldn't consider going back, but there's really no inventive to pay $9-10 for another sandwich that seems on track to disappoint me.",0.3123,0.808,0.093,0.098,0.5171212121212122

I guess it's because he's from Chicago, has his namesake restaurant located just a 5 minute walk away from my apartment, and also apparently likes one of my favorite brands as well. Some of my coworkers and I took a cab up north from the Loop to grab some good eats. Grahamwich's philosophy seems to be simple enough - a modern twist on the old school sandwich and soda parlors. It definitely had that type of vibe, and it was a pretty comfortable place. However, the girls in skirts had some difficulty with the ottoman like stool chairs, so reader be-warned. Seating was also limited to some bar stools at the counter and one long continuous table that seats around 16. It's pretty clear that most people grab food and bring it back to the office. A friend and I decided to split a couple of sammiches to get the most of our trip. I had my mind set on the pork belly bbq grahamwich, which was basically pulled pork spun in some tangy bbq sauce. Notable toppings were cornbread (not as sweet and flavorful as I was hoping for), and some sort of creamy slaw. The slaw was decent, but wasn't really all that creamy; it was like an attempt at combining the standard creamy slaw with the zippy vinegar slaw. All together, the slaw wasn't too memorable. The pulled pork belly didn't really remind me of pork belly - I expected it to be a bit more moist, but it was a bit dry. I also opted to go for the homemade vanilla cola; it had the right amount of vanilla taste, but it was a bit flat. Initially, I was a bit underwhelmed. Second half of the meal was the grilled cheese. I'm definitely a fan of grilled cheese and the addition of proscuitto? Sign me up! This sandwich was definitely delicious. Sometimes, it's the simpler foods that really deliver, and I was definitely 100% pleased with this sandwich as it even exceeded my expectations.

2011-10-09,3.0,"On its face, Grahamwich is yet another example of a high profile chef branching out into ""everyday"" food with a few haute cuisine touches.  That's not to say the concept is a bad one, though. Obviously pining for sandwich counters of yore with its inclusion of soft serve and flavored sodas (vanilla kola anyone?), Grahamwich provides an upscale take on classic sandwiches. And in a perfect expression of this concept, the decor mixes just the right amount of retro with an airy modern space.  As for the sandwiches themselves, some things work, others don't. Take, for instance, the ""Pork BBQ"" sandwich I tried on a recent visit. Mediocre pulled pork typically has two fatal flaws: 1) meat cooked until it's essentially mush and 2) an overabundance of sauce to make up for the flavorless meat. Grahamwich solves the former by using pork belly rather than the more traditional pork shoulder--the crispy layer of fat lends the meat the ideal tender consistency and smoky flavor. The sandwich is also perfectly sauced. Unfortunately, Grahamwich opts for an overly sweet BBQ sauce, which, when combined with the similar sweetness of both the slaw and the cornbread bun, makes the sandwich rather too cloying for my taste. A more savory sauce would have been a much better complement to the other elements. The other sandwiches we tried ranged from clever and tasty like the grilled cheese with tomato marmalade to the just plain ordinary, like the lamb gyro and Mediterranean veggie. The best part of the whole experience, though, had to be the popcorn. While I'm definitely a sucker for anything with truffle oil, I think anyone will agree that the popcorn was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of cheese and chives to complement the strong truffle flavor.  Others have commented on the high prices, but really, this isn't Subway--you're going to pay a little more. I would disagree with having to pay the same $3 for Diet Coke that you do for the custom-flavored drinks, however.  So, what's the verdict on this celebrity chef nostalgia trip? I'd say it's worth a visit, but it's probably not going to join Chicago staples like Kuma's and Hot Doug's as revelatory takes on fast food.",0.9593,0.849,0.106,0.045,0.5112458471760799

I had a Mediterranean veggie sandwich which was the worst Mediterranean sandwich I ever had,.. The focaccia was stale and the veggies were also kinda stale... The double Latte looked like just milk prepared for a kid with like a tinge of coffee. It was cold and when I asked to replace the same..the second coffee was the same.. In fact I came home sick after eating the sandwich and coffee. Never ever would go there again and would recommend everyone else to be very careful of what you eat there.",0.0369,0.814,0.1,0.086,0.6006973795435333

Really expensive at $3, and it tasted like IBC.  The soft serves were a little disappointing.  The better of the two is the cinnamon stick, which is cinnamon ice cream, salted caramel, pie crust crumbs, and stewed apples.  This was a nice combination, but the stewed apples tasted old.  The other soft serve was vanilla ice cream, mashmallow fluff, nutella, and bananas.  First of all, not nearly enough nutella.  I love marshmallow fluff, but on top of vanilla ice cream, it's just...vanilla.  Pretty boring combination.  Not special or gourmet in any way.   I would come back to Grahamwich, but due to the pricepoint, not for a while.",0.9967,0.745,0.21,0.046,0.600896501457726

Since this place has opened, I have heard about the terrible reviews the critics gave which prompted a rehaul of Graham Elliot's menu. I wanted to visit earlier, but the hours of operation during the weekday made it difficult to catch them after work, however this past weekend I had the luxury and time to try the gourmet and expensive sandwich and I was less than impressed. The wagyu beef is sliced very thin that it taste like roast beef with mustard. The assortment of toppings combined for a crunchy texture, but lacking in beef flavor. The grilled cheese was top notch, but at 7 dollars you would expect a heartier sandwich but the proscuitto with cheese curds makes this worthwhile. The 5 dollars for chips with cheese powder etc was worth it. You get a enormous bag of chips that taste like krunchers. Overall it would have garnered 4 stars, but the cost is just ridiculous.... Fyi: the seating arrangement is like a park bench so be prepared to be cozy with your neighbor Also I find it ironic that graham elliot ripped on a contestant for master chef using ""truffle oil"" and he goes ahead and uses it for his signature popcorn.....

2011-09-03,2.0,"Let me start out by stating that my plan was to have dinner at Graham Eliot's actual restaurant. However, I had already been in Chicago for the night prior and already spent $90 parking two cars at our hotel. If I wanted to make my reservation at GE I would have had to pay another $84 for parking plus tip. So I decided to forgo GE and go to his sandwich shop instead.  I was extremely disappointed! The outside of the shop was fine, exactly what I would have imagined. The girl at the cashier station was friendly enough. The first thing I noticed in the shop was the ATM machine, clearly indicating that the shop does not take credit cards. It's 2011! All eateries should be taking visa and MasterCard by now. Their cash register must have been from 1990.  I ordered the pork BBQ (pork belly, root beer, creamy slaw, dill pickles, cornbread). Now when you read this description you think it comes on corn bread right? WRONG the cornbread was crumbled and mixed in.  Lets' start with the pork belly: the pork was extremely dry, it was not tossed in any type of BBQ sauce, instead it was very clearly squirted on. The pork looked like it was a day old and had been sitting in a warmer for a while. It was dry and stringy.  Dill pickles: based on the menu description of their side order of dill pickles they are homemade (""hopefully"" - I'm serious, that's what it said!)  These pickles were sweet and bitter, there was no dill, no sour, no salt, nothing! They were awful with the dried up pork. I would think that any normal cook would know to pair sweet BBQ sauce with a sour and tangy pickle.  Creamy slaw: there was nothing creamy about this slaw, it wasn't even evenly distributed onto the sandwich, it was one big clump of warm overly dressed slaw which made my bun super soggy.  Cornbread: I will admit that I do like the idea of mixing cornbread crumbs in with pulled pork and BBQ. However, the cornbread was dry and had no flavor at all. I don't understand the point of having this item as one of the ingredients on the sandwich.  Walking through the city and to the shop I was really hoping for freshly baked bread. Graham seems like the type of celebrity chef that prides himself on the best ingredients and having everything homemade, however there were bags of vendor bought bread on the shelves. Very disappointing. If he won't make his bread, at the very least he can partner with a local bakery.  G'Wich Popcorn: I like the popcorn, and if I'm ever int he area again, I would get it again. HOWEVER, the truffle oil made the popcorn soggy. Who likes wet popcorn? But truffle oil is so addicting so soggy or not I would have to have this as a guilty pleasure. I would also like to remind you all of Tracey on MasterChef season 2, she was almost sent packing because she used truffle oil, Graham, Gordon and Joe all agreed that truffle oil is their least favorite ingredient and it should not be used ever. Hypocrite?  Vanilla Kola: My dining partner had the vanilla kola, it was good, but a little too sweet, almost too much vanilla syrup.  I had the diet coke which was good and refreshing, only it didn't taste like regular diet coke, it tasted more like coke-a-cola but without the sugary aftertaste.  Last but not least, let's discuss the dessert. Cinnamon stick: can I just say DELICIOUS, I've been craving it for days. The soft serve was not over powered with cinnamon, it had just the correct amount to give me that edge of spicy cinnamon. The caramel was very clearly homemade, it tasted like butter and sugar...mmmmmmmm. The pie crust crumbles were a nice crunch and the roasted apples were warm and mushy. The entire dessert was divine and left me wanting more.  The absolutely most disappointing aspect of my experience was the decor. There is one large family size table for anyone to sit at who wishes to eat at the shop. There was an outdoor patio but it was closed. There were two very large windowsills in the back that had MOLDY DEAD HERBS on them. YES, I said MOLDY, DEAD, HERBS. I was shocked, absolutely shocked. What kind of chef allows his sandwich eatery to have dead, decaying plants? It was so disgusting. Gordon would be appalled.  All in all I would not eat here again and I would not recommend this to any of my friends. In fact when my friends and family visit us in our neighboring Chicago suburb I am going to specifically tell them not to go to Grahamwich.  I've lost complete respect for GE and I am so grateful that I did not go to his restaurant and spend $300 on a meal I probably would have regretted. I would love to invite Chef Ramsey to Grahamwich and see what he thinks. I think he would agree that Graham has failed as a sandwich shop owner and should quit the business altogether.

(2) Soft serve - had the nutella one and it was brilliant. Recommend highly.  Cons:  (1) Popcorn - normally love this popcorn - what I got was stale and inconsistently heavily coated in pepper, to the point where it was inedible. I personally cannot eat soggy balls of pepper. Maybe it was the fault of the guy who happened to season my popcorn? I don't know but I can't recommend anything that causes people to start coughing excessively as a result of trying it.  (2) Wagyu beef sandwich - this was really the biggest disappointment of them all. The bread is cheap, chewy and had indentations in it from sitting in some sort of bin or container or pushed up against things that cause indentations in cheap bread - if I had any questions about it being fresh, after I took a bite, there were no more. There was no flavor and the sandwich was very difficult to chew due to the chewyness of the bread. The beef itself - well, others on here have commented that it was good roast beef. Maybe for you. For me, this tasted a lot like a popular appetizer on trays and sometimes at events but unfortunately, this didn't even taste as good as what you get on trays. It also had very hard parts to it that I couldn't chew and when I took a look at them, looked like they had been left out and dried up. The onions had no flavor (not surprising as they were something between raw and cooked and nothing had been added to avoid the loss of flavor that cooking onions causes) and even the mustard was flavorless, which I thought was somewhat impressive as I've never had ""grainy mustard"" before that lacked flavor - I didn't know that they made such a thing. I will say that the arugula, in all likelihood because there isn't really cheap arugula and so there was actual fresh flavor involved, was fantastic and the one thing that popped out of the sandwich.  I thought this would be a great outing - I didn't expect it to be like his restaurant because that would be absurd. It's a sandwich shop. But I didn't expect it to have such a horrible standard of quality. I would go back for the soft serve, but I'm not even sure I would be willing to try another sandwich since the fundamentals were so off on this one.

The chicken waldorf might be in the top three sandwiches I've ever had. Just thinking about it makes me so hungry and it's 12:17am. Sigh. My friends sampled the lamb gyro, grilled cheese and mediterranean veggie. Even my super-picky mother loved her sandwich here. To top it off, the vanilla coke was delicious--I want to bring a gallon home.  I stopped in once during a quiet afternoon and got the cinnamon stick soft serve. The employees joked around about who would have to make it (I remember hearing ""Well, YOU'RE the pastry chef ha ha!""). Anyway, the layers of pie and apple and caramel were to die for.

I really enjoyed the ambience.  High ceilings, large back window looking out into a garden. The food was also delicious- my sandwich was messy but had such a great combination of flavors and textures.  I would certainly get it again.  The cola was very tasty, but could have had a bit more carbonation.  The popcorn, with parmesan, chives, sea salt, cracked pepper, and truffle oil, was delicious but very rich.  The ""small"" size order that I got was massive, enough to take back and share with the office.  I would certainly go back to Grahamwich, and will be a bit conflicted on whether or not to stay with the tuna or try something new.  Highly recommended.",0.9777,0.738,0.191,0.071,0.5257151515151515
2011-08-03,1.0,"I have tried to like this place, I REALLY have.  I just can't. Am I a 4-5 star acclamed chef/restauranteur? NO! Do I think Potbelly's or Jimmy John's is better - NO!  I have been working in this neighborhood 10+ years and am tired of the food choices. I looked forward to a new place to eat. Although I watch Masterchef, I did not even realize who the proprietor was. Silly me! Now I cannot even watch the show when he yells at people for tasteless, unattractive food without yeling at the TV ""Have you been to your deli place lately? Or at all!?""  Trip 1 - co-worker said the gyro was to die for. Not so much so. In fact, if I were blindfolded and asked to name the ingredients, meat would not be one of them. The lamb is sliced as thin as those bad ""gyro kits"" you see at the grocery store. The sandwich was largely tomatoes, onion, cucumbers and cucumber sauce a plenty! Oh and feta cheese - much to my annoyance. It was not listed on the website sandwich ingredients. Noticed it too late at the shop. I also had a root beer and a pan au chocolat. Soda is soda. Not worth the $3.  The croissant was light and flaky but very salty and very little filling.  Meal total was around $16 or so.  Trip 2 - Wagyu beef, lemon-line soda, croissant. Read one reviewer's comment the mustard almost burned her mouth off. Was lookind forward to the kick - never happened.l If there was 1/4 teaspoon of mustard on the sandwich I would be surprised. Barely tasted it. The beef was thin and flavorless when taken off the sandwich. The greens had a dressing on them which was not distinguishable on the sandwich, but on the bits that fell off the sandwich. Loved the pretzle roll.  Lemon-lime ok, no great thrill. Croissant again just ok. Total for lunch $20.  Trip 3 - breakfast croissant - the cheese/meat one. VERY greasy, very messy. Needed something for flavor. Just did not do anything for me. My co-worker had the nutella paninni and said it was quite a mess, but ok and at least she could say she had tried it before she quit working at our office. They do not open until 8, and I start at 7:30 so no more jaunts over there for me. Cider donuts ooze grease - and I love a good cider donut, but won't go near those.  Trip 4 - Pork BBQ. Sauce nice, meat dry & crunchy. Slaw messy. Messy seems to be a key factor with the food here. Not so big on the cornbread roll. Skipped the soda, tried one more croissant. The croissant seemed to have like 5 chocolate chips in it - it was all salty bread. Lunch total $12.51. The popcorn or chips do not intrigue me. I hear good things about the ice cream, I may pop in one hot day for that as my lunch. My sandwich efforts are done. I saw the gooey mess that is the grilled cheese and have no desire to try that any more.  If I enjoyed the food the price would not be an issue. But for something that is just ""meh"", the cost is just not worth it for me.  OH, and YES they really do pour Diet Coke out of a 2 liter plastic container! Unless you are eating there - go across the street to Jewel and buy a 1.25 liter diet coke for .99!  I also realized nobody there wears gloves when handling food. Kind of bothered me that someone will go from clearing trays to wiping a counter to wrapping my sandwich.

If the answer is a  ""Master Chef"" sandwich shop, well, we are far away from what I define Master Chef food. The sandwich are messy and  definitely without style. I tried either the cheese sandwich or the croissant with nutella and banana. The first is a mess: cheesy and greasy. I mean you bite a small piece and it starts leaking cheese and marmalade everywhere. As regards to the second, the croissant is not homemade. In fact, it tastes like those that you can buy in the frozen department food of every grocery store. It's so rich in butter that it will drive my poor French friends crazy. In addition, like the cheese sandwich it is too full of nutella and banana a bite and it likes for ever.... We are talking about one of the most acclaimed chefs in the country. A few weeks ago I watched one episode of Master Chef and he correctly pointed out how the style and the attention to details is important in his job.

The beef was thin cut, and tasty but nothing life changing.  Mustard gave a nice kick - it was appropriate, not too overpowering or subtle.  The potato sticks add a nice textural element.  Probably wouldn't buy again just because I'd want to try other things. 2. Mediterranean Veggie sandwich: Total win.  The focaccia was rich in herbs and tomato, the smokiness of the veggies matched perfectly with the pesto punch.  The goat cheese gave a great creaminess and cohesion to things.  This is how vegetarian food should be. 3. Popcorn: Classic.  Quality popcorn drizzled with manna from foodie heaven.  My only qualms were that the popcorn was being bagged ahead of time, so it wasn't warm, and that the drizzle needs to be more evenly distributed.  Some pieces are *bam truffles* where others are just lonely (but still delicious) 4. Chips: Pretty average kettle chips.  The bacon bits seemed to be MIA.  Not bad, but not great either. 5. Pickles: Great pickles.  Nice, flavorful brine infused into fresh veggies - can't go wrong.  My only complaint was that the portion size was really lacking compared to the chips and popcorn; it's probably less than a cup of veggies vs 4 cups of chips or popcorn (aka ""why America is so fat"") 6. Vanilla Bean soft serve: Excellent.  The flavors all fit together and, as my girlfriend pointed out, the soft serve on it own is really stellar.   More generally, I was a little bothered by: 1. Store Layout: The register is right near the door, leading to a weird bunching up of the line.  Maybe 10 people can squeeze in before you're getting pushed into the doorway - it would have made more sense to have the food prep area near the entryway and then the registers farther down to accomodate more people. 2. Hands + Food: Nobody was wearing gloves.  I'm no Howard Hughes but it was a little iffy.  I didn't see anyone doing anything extremely unsanitary (touching themselves, petting animals, juggling trash, etc) but it did make me go hmmm. Overall, it was a very solid experience.  A little expensive, but the reference point should really be another River North eatery, not Subway.",0.995,0.779,0.163,0.058,0.5928749315818282

2011-06-23,2.0,"Dear Grahamwich, Oh how I was hoping my fellow yelp-ers were wrong (although I deep down I knew they weren't).   Despite all of the 2 and 3 star reviews, my friend I decided to taste things for ourselves.  Armed with an open mind and brief knowledge of the menu, we walked through the doors.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, my partner in crime ordered the tuna sandwich, and we ordered the chips and popcorn.  We said ""no way jose"" to the $3 diet coke out of a 2-liter (b/c no one wants soda out of a 2-liter) and found a spot outside. The sandwiches were pretty good, I'll give you that Graham.  My chicken salad was tasty, I enjoyed it and finished it - good enough to make a second trip back? Probs not. My friend also said she enjoyed her sandwich but that it wasn't worth it to come back again.  So sandwiches? Fine, better than Subway, maybe not better than Jimmy Johns. (Too harsh? sorry). And then came the sides...oh so oily.  I love me some truffle oil, but all I could think of was ""too much of a good thing is a bad thing"" - we didn't even come close to finishing the popcorn.  The chips were fine, nothing stellar and not worth the consumption of calories.  Also, on a side note. Not a fan of the communal table.  I know they do they same thing at Hanna's Bretzel...but Hanna's eats are so good I don't even care.  Here on the other hand...I do care.

I was pleasantly surprised at how the sandwich prices were lowered by a few dollars and there seemed to be a bit more variety on the menu.

Negatives: It was sort of gross to see the waitstaff touching the doors, the register, and running their hands through their hair and not wearing any gloves, and then touching the food. This was my biggest complaint. I hate saying this about the workers there, as they were all very friendly-but I caught one of the guys picking his beard and then making a sandwich. Sort of gross.

You're as likely to see Lime Jello Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise on the menu as caviar, but I digress.  I work near Grahamwich and have really, truly, tried to like it...  Here is the good: Graham Elliot still serves up unexpected food combinations which are generally tasty.  Breakfast is Fast, Inexpensive, includes a Latte or other coffee drink. For Lunch, I've tried the short rib sandwich and the grilled cheese, both nice. The pacific tuna is pretty good too. (the Wasabi Peas are surprising and adds Grahams whimsical signature)  Here's the bad:  Ambiance: The place has the feel of a hot dog kiosk at a county fair. No more than a handful of seats available, and none of it comfortable. There is one table in the back with bench seating for about 6.  Service: Absolutely NO sense of urgency from any of the staff. (including the owner, Graham, whom I've seen there a few times.) You step up to give your order to a nice kid who looks like Hermey the Misfit Dentist Elf, who takes your order cheerfully, rings up your card or takes your cash.... then forgets to give your order to the cook. With very little seating, you stand there, waiting and waiting even if there are 5 people behind the counter. They just chit chat, or work on prep, while customers wait 4 feet away. (this has happened quite a few times) You end up using the bulk of your lunch break waiting for the cook to realize that there are orders waiting at the register.  Food: Everything on the menu is oily, drippy, messy, and expected to be eaten with your hands. Expect sauce/oil/goo to run down your arm while you are eating. This is food that should really be eaten with a spoon.

(Stephanie and The Girl and The Goat, you're next.) Grahamwich isn't too far from my Saturday stomping grounds (the Magnificient Mile) so I made a point of going there today. It's quite spartan and simple on the inside, with a few stools of counterspace and some table space in the back (from what I saw; it looked like a big party may have pushed the tables together), and waiting space across from the counter. The menu consists of about 10 main items, some sides, ice cream sundae-ish things, but I was here for one thing, and one thing only: the sandwich. After a bit of deliberation, I went with the reuben because I had been a good kid that morning and went for a run, and honestly, I wasn't there to delicately choose some frilly healthy salad-on-a-bun -- maybe another time, but this was no time for jokes. I also chose for it to be to-go, which ended up being a mistake, but we'll get to that later. Service was relatively quick and I was handed a brown paper bag with my sandwich all wrapped up, which I tore into like a child on Christmas Day.. to have my hands COVERED in dressing. I knew I was in for a treat. From the shop, I wandered over to Michigan Avenue, getting absolutely DRENCHED and COVERED in this sandwich, but enjoying every single moment of it. It was really delicious and everything was very well-balanced, and the rye bread was toasted PERFECTLY. The dressing was probably the best part though.. so good! I kind of felt bad for anyone who passed by me on the street, though, that had to witness me maul this delicious while trying to keep the wind out of my hair and the sandwich from spilling on my dress, but what are you gonna do.

And that says a lot - considering I also think the grilled cheese I make at home with Kraft singles is pretty darn awesome. However, the short rib sandwich was average-to-below-average. And the truffle popcorn was disappointing. I love me some truffle. But it was only drizzled on the top, which made the remainder of the ($5!!!) bag to be simply plain old popcorn. Bummer. Maybe I'll come back one day if I'm in the neighborhood and craving a grilled cheese. Or possibly to try out the ice cream that people are raving about.

From the reviews, I was expecting a tiny, overpriced, lackluster sandwich.  I can officially say that I have no idea what everyone is talking about.  My friend and I decided to split a grilled cheese and a wagyu beef.  Ummm...the grilled cheese was gigantic.  Overflowing with cheesy goodness and super tasty with the prosciutto and tomato marmalade, this sandwich still makes my mouth water.  I appreciated that the prosciutto was chopped up so I didn't have to mess with any stringy pieces dragging the meat right off my sandwich.  Hey, I'm all about efficiency and equal distribution of meat when I'm devouring something so delicious.  My half sandwich was so filling, I had to take a break before diving into the wagyu. Three hours later I was anxiously unwrapping the other sandwich.  It was refreshingly light and tasty.  Usually I find beef sandwiches to be way too heavy.  Not so with this one.  It was the perfect combination of beef, potatoes and mustard.  The onion rings were a nice touch but not overwhelming.  I really liked it.  And I really liked the sliced potatoes on top.  Never seen that on a sandwich before.  Yum. I'm not a truffle oil girl but my friend decided to have the popcorn.  I was surprised to see that the small was about the same size as a medium popcorn at the movies.  Nice.  Had I not been in for take out, I totally would have gotten the soft serve with pie pieces.  Oh man, I want to try that.  I'll just have to go back, or call the Grahambulance (love it!). As far as wait, I didn't have one, which is great because I hate to wait.  As far as price, I really didn't think that $7 and $10 were that unreasonable.  Maybe I've just been spending way too much time in Vegas where $12 gets you a nightmare on bread.  Who knows. All I know is that I loved it.  And would not hesitate to go back.  Especially for that pie soft serve.  Mmmm...can't wait!",0.9802,0.826,0.126,0.048,0.5608304297328689

While playing a rivia game about the group of friends: - ""Joey's favorite food?"" - ""SANDWICHES!"" Too funny. Whose favorite food is sandwiches? Well, folks, sammies are in my top 3 fave food groups. Next to sushi and pizza. I digress. Now, while I love sandwiches, I am oh-so-tired of the chain restaurant brigade. Not gonna lie. My bro came to take me to lunch & I suggested this place because neither of us had ever been. We arrived at 1pm on a Thursday, the place was hoppin' (read: no place to sit and very warm), and there was a sign that said ""Now Accepting Credit Cards."" Just an FYI. After waiting about 15 minutes in line and probably another 15 for food, we split the Short Rib sandwich and the Jibarito Tacos. Two totally different things, but it was nice to get a taste of each.  Short rib sandwich Mmm. The meat was very tender and not fatty at all. Like Colin C. pointed out - it's difficult to physically hold/eat the short rib sammy because it's more like a pretzel roll *topped* with the meat and fixings. The horseradish sauce (Erin L.!) was a fantastic complement to the sandwich. The other toppings were just kind of ""there."" They were necessary but nothing all that exciting. Tacos The tacos (3 per serving) were pretty light and nice for a change of pace. The pork was pretty good and mango habanero gave it that flavor of sweet and savory - something I am generally not a HUGE fan of - but these tasted pretty good to me. There wasn't a whole lotta meat and I craved a little more spice.  So, $10 per sammich. Hm. While I know the ingredients are fresh and tasty (yet not quite a-mazing) the sandwich sizes aren't all that big. The popcorn serving is huge so $5 was not all that terrible. My bro and I split some and I still had half of the paper bag to take home. To save 3 bucks on a full-sugar pop, I brought my trusty Nalgene full of water.  Was I totally impressed? Not really. Was it great for a change of pace? For sure.  I don't get to the city much and am tired of the same ol' suburban shops.  EXTRA POINTS for the free sample of soft serve while we waited.

Cold 2. Bland.  The only thing you could taste were wasabi beans.  Otherwise, everything else was flavorless.  They might as well given me a dish of wasabi beans. 3. Not filling.

I hate to do this but I feel it is my duty to.   For those of you who have read my other reviews, you will know that I am very critical of places that purport to serve ethnic food, especially ones that try to pass it off as authentic ethnic.  Granted this place was in no way trying to be ""authentic"" I feel that they might be misleading their patrons by using the ethnic name for their sandwiches (i.e. banh mi or jibarito).    Let's get things straight.  The food tasted decent, but I am offended by the concept and the value of the place.  With that said, lets start... I went to this place expecting my socks to be knocked off.  Given the reputation of the man who owns the restaurant, I was expecting nothing less than awesome.   I ordered the jibarito tacos and my friends ordered the grilled cheese sandwiches.    $10 for A sandwich and $5 for each side.  The sides available were seasoned potato chips, seasoned POPCORN, salad or pickles.  Seriously... $5,,, for potato chips...I was so offended and still am that I can't think clear enough to write anything constructive.  FIVE DOLLARS for potato chips.  I think the absurd price should speak for itself.  If we were at a movie theater, a place where I know junk food costs an arm and a kidney, I wouldn't be as put off.  At least then I would have consolation knowing my initial $10 and the additional $5 for a small popcorn might afford me naked people or some crazy explosions on the big screen.  Anyways, on to the real kickers. A vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) should never cost more than $4-5, period.  But yeah - $10 at Grahamwich.  Also, the more expensive knock off included shiitake mushrooms and pineapple.  Now, like I said at the beginning, Grahamwich isn't trying to be authentic, nor do they claim to be, but pineapple and shiitake mushrooms on a vietnamese sandwich?  A traditional banh mi consists of seasoned meat, jalepenos, cilantro, pickled diakon (radish) and pate (liver/kidney spread).   Jibarito tacos - NO THANK YOU.  A jibarito is Puerto Rican-American food. Moreover, Puerto rican food does not include tortillas, let alone tacos.  Granted the jibarito was invented in the US, a traditional jibarito is - steak, melted cheddar cheese, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and garlic sandwiched in between two deep fried plantains.  The Grahamwich jibarito taco had pork shoulder, cilantro, mango habanero salsa with a few plantain chips that looked like the ones you buy in a bag from the convenience store.  The taste was nothing like a jibarito.  It should've just been called a pork taco with plantain chips, seriously.",-0.3501,0.852,0.071,0.077,0.535

So please, throw out every review you read complaining about cash only, and just trust my review, because those other lames are out of date. Went to Grahamwich for a late lunch a little after 2 pm on a Friday afternoon, a great time to check the place out because there was virtually no wait. I sampled the beef short rib, the grilled cheese and the $3 root beer. I decided to stay away from the $5 chips because it seemed like way more food than I was interested in eating and the $5 popcorn seemed to be the same stuff you can get at Graham Elliot.  The beef short rib is a sandwich in the loose sense of the word, in that it's a bunch of meat lumped on top of a pretzel roll that was more like a pretzel hot dog bun. It was smaller than I thought it would be, and difficult to eat. That said it was pretty tasty. The grilled cheese was a disappointment. I've definitely had better grilled cheese that came with a fries and a drink for less money. Maybe I'm to blame for ordering a $10 grilled cheese. The root beer was alright. Not sure why it's three bucks, but at that point they already got you, so you might as well have a tasty beverage to quench your thirst. As for the restaurant itself, they have one communal table in the back and a few spots along the wall. Definitely not an enjoyable atmosphere in which to eat, quite frankly. Graham, just spend a buck or two and put some more damn tables in there. Communal eating is the lamest fad ever. America is in desperate need of a celebrity chef to speak out against the grade school-ization of our dining experiences. Are we going to start drinking out of cardboard milk cartons next? I don't see myself coming back here. I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon complaining about price. Grahamwich charges pretty much the same price for lunch as you'll pay at other downtown lunch spots that don't have ""Sub"" or ""McD"" in their restaurant name. The problem for me is that the food just doesn't deliver on the potential of a Graham Eliot sandwich joint. If you're going to go here because you want to try Graham Elliot's food but not spend the money you would at Graham Elliot, don't. You're just cheating yourself and the food at Grahamwich doesn't live up to the Graham Elliot experience.

We placed our order and requested waters where we were directed to the back to the restaurant. This is where it goes downhill. In the back of the restaurant there were two water pitchers and plastic cups. The water pitcher I grabbed had a greasy handle (thanks to whomever grabbed it before me).  We found a seat and waited about 8 minutes for my name to be called.

The first time I went, Grahamwich had only been open 4 or 5 days and the line was crazy. I waited in line for 45 minutes (they handed out free tumblers of drinks and apologised like crazy for the wait, which was down to the number of people trying to get a sandwich as opposed to any errors on the service side) and ordered two Banh mi' and popcorn.  The banh mi's weren't really worth the wait, they were tasty but pork belly always has an extreme layer of fat that works when you make it crispy. Unfortunately, the banh mis I got had a tender slab of fat that just felt horrible in my mouth as opposed to being any sort of sandwich experience as Grahamwich is billed as.  I do give credit to Graham Elliott working behind the line even though he looked like he was fit to drop due to fatigue. He was apologizing to customers and making jokes and doing his best to get his new shop off to a good start. I went again today to Grahamwich and there was no line.

Then since we had nowhere to sit, we just stood at the counter and waited almost 20 minutes for our food.  I can't imagine what a clusterfark this place is when it's actually busy.  There was probably 6 people behind the counter and seemed very unorganized.  They put our $3 12oz 'gourmet' sodas on the tray right when we placed the order, and since the sandwiches took 20 minutes, our ice had melted by the time we got the sodas and were nice and watery when I finally got to drink it. And from what I could taste of the soda it wasn't anything even remotely special.  At that price I thought it would at least taste a little unique.

Luckily we are all into sharing our food, so I got try three different kinds of sandwiches...awesome.  First off, the shop itself is super cute. They've managed to make you feel like you hopped back in time to the 1940's, yet everything also has that brand-new feel to it. Hmm, tricky.

There are a set of stairs that I saw staff going up and down, but I'm not sure us patrons were welcome down there.  As for the food, one was a major hit, another was pretty damn good, and the third was nothing special. We ordered:  * Grilled Cheese: ridunkulous! This sandwich has got it going on. You've got cheese, prosciutto, and this sweet tomato spread that makes it all blend perfectly together  * Beef Shortrib: I was surprised with how much I liked this one. The meat was delicious and all the ingredients really complemented each other.  * Pastrami Reuben: Mwah...mwah. So bummed about this one; I didn't like it at all. And those who know me quickly learn there are few things I love more than reuben sandwiches. The flavor was all wrong, and the texture was kind of mushy.  *G'wich Chips: why not? They were yummy, but not what I expected. I thought they were going be more like nachos. But really they were like fancy potato chips seasoned with ranch and parm.  All-in-all it was good, but for a sandwich meal that costs $15+ I was expecting to be blown away. I am eager to relive the two sandwiches that I enjoyed...and the Turkey Confit is calling my name.

All I tasted was the tart/acid tomato part and none of the various cheese flavors. Plus, the prosciutto made it WAY TOO SALTY. And this is coming from someone who was hung over!  The redeeming factor was the popcorn - delish, even though I wish it were crisper/warmer when served bc it does start to wilt under the parm, truffle and butter - but, it was delish even still and who really complains about parm, truffles and butter, not me!  Also, I took a bite of the whitefish sandwich that my friend had - it was a flavor explosion! Everything from the bread choice to all the different toppings were just amazing, I was kinda turned off from this selection bc I always thought whitefish was too fishy - but this sandwich changed my mind. I recommend getting it!  Lastly, the communal tables. The seating sitc in this place sucks. Especially, when you're trying to wrangle 4 seats during a weekend lunch rush.

My experience there was lackluster (nothing negative, just not memorable), the staff was friendly, service was quick (although it was nearly empty at 5 pm on a Friday) and my food was good.  The Reuben was tasty, albeit slightly messy and an artery clogging heart attack wrapped nicely in wax paper, then again if you are worried about clogging your arteries you should stay away from this place to begin with. It was a good Reuben, not the best, not the biggest, but solid/above average. The popcorn was delicious, doused in truffle oil and parmesan was easily the best popcorn I've""ve ever had (the same that he puts on the table at his namesake restaurant, just in much larger portions). If you are going to go with the popcorn though, make sure you give the bag a good shake, I saw how they prepared it and from some of the negative reviews, it seems like the ingredients aren't properly distributed.

2011-02-14,4.0,"I had the Pastrami Rueben.  The rutabaga kraut made me skeptical, but it ended up being the most delicous sandiwch I have had in a while.  My wife had the grilled cheese, she shared, it was delicous as well.  We lucked out and were able to get a seat at the table which made the meal most likely more enjoyable.  We had 2 sandiwches, a popcorn, and 2 drinks.  The $34 price tag raised an eyebrow, but it was good.   Now for my one problem.  We walked in, it was crowded, and made our way to the register.  The CASH ONLY sign was easy to spot, unfortunately we didn't have enough cash.  So I looked at the disinterested glassed mid 20's hipster working the register and said ""Oh, we don't have enough cash, we'll have to go find an ATM"".  Thats verbatum, exactly what I said, making full eye contact.  The response of ""Yeah"" is what would eventually infuriate me.  We left, walked a couple blocks, found an ATM, came back, and got ready to order.  It had cleared out a little bit, thats when I noitced the ATM machine that was 3 feet behind where we were originally standing, hidden by customers.  It may have been too much to ask for ""Excuse me sir, there is an ATM located right behind you"".  I'd even take an impolite ""Right behind you"".  The food was good, the staff seemed to work like a well oiled machine, there just seemed to be a lack of personality.  If I'm paying $34 for a lunch, can I at least get a smile?",0.9637,0.786,0.141,0.073,0.5019717261904761

2011-02-13,2.0,"After nearly two years of anticipation from celebrity chef Graham Elliot, his latest venture is, well, somewhat underwhelming. The food is good but pricey. The layout and cash-only policy, inconceivable. The small, rectangular space in the historic Tree Studios building is so poorly designed. Upon entering on an early Saturday afternoon, a hoard of people was clustered in front of the long prep counter, making it hard to tell who was in line to order and who was waiting for their food. Viewing the full menu, located along the wall behind the counter and partially blocked by the popcorn machine, required maneuvering past the cash register and through this standing crowd of customers. Making matters worse, the seating is extremely limited. One long table with ottoman-like chairs is available in the back. Those not lucky enough to score a seat are forced to stand along one of two counter tops or, in our case, crouched on a ledge near the entrance with our $16 meals in our laps. For a counter-service lunch of a sandwich and dessert totaling that much, I'd prefer to eat at a table, please. The only redeeming part of my meal, the delicious cinnamon soft serve ice cream topped with diced roasted apples, salted caramel, and pie crust pieces -- like apple pie a la mode in a cup -- helped curb my anger at the seating situation. The jibarito tacos were a nice mix of spicy pork shoulder and sweet, fried plantains, although $10 was a bit much to fork over for three corn tortillas presented on a cafeteria tray. I would be open to trying a few other sandwiches and snacks -- but now I know to visit during off-peak hours in hopes of landing a seat or take my food to go.",0.8277,0.826,0.102,0.072,0.45567226890756296
2011-02-13,2.0,"Another bougie sandwich shop? Well, obviously... I gotta try it. I rolled into Grahamwich with low expectations, and sadly... it met them. Wow. What a disappointment. Here we go. I went in on a Sunday around 12:15 PM. I walked in and immediately: confusion. Do I walk to the sandwich prep station or do I go to the register? There was a disorganized line of people crowding near the front door and throngs of individuals standing around looking either irritated, anxious, perplexed, or all of the above. Two girls - presumably confused by the line situation - cut ahead of several people after using the ATM machine (INconveniently positioned near the register line. why inconveniently? because though it's good to put it up front since the place is ""cash only,"" it's best for the customers who have cash not to have to deal with people using the ATM while standing in line to order/pay).  Anyway, after about 12-15 minutes of waiting in the so-called line, I wait for the food. I ordered a turkey confit sandwich and orange ginger soda ""for here."" After about 7-8 minutes of waiting for the food, I tried looking for a table. Unfortunately, there is inadequate seating (one or two long tables with low stools meant for ""communal dining""). Many people who had food to eat in-store had to stand against awkwardly positioned bar areas where you would think there should be stools (near the espresso bar and near the waiting area) and scarf down their sandwiches while people waiting for their to-go orders watched. Not to mention, since there are no stools designating the area as ""eat areas,"" people weren't sure if they were supposed to stand against the wall or allow people to eat there. As for me (and three other customers), we sat on the windowsill awkwardly balancing food, drink, and heavy coat. I ate the sandwich (turkey confit). The sandwich itself ($10. Remember that. It's ten dollars. I know it's the city, but come on... read ahead...) was decent. However, my particular sandwich had too much mayo. The relish was nice and sweet as were the pickled carrots. The shredded turkey itself was pleasant, but with the sweet pickled carrots and relish and the sweet toasted bread... it started to taste more like a dessert than lunch. Don't get me started on the so-called ""orange ginger soda."" Definitely orange, but no hint of ginger. It tasted like Fanta. Oh, and the soda was $3.  After I rushed to eat my sandwich and soda (I had nowhere to go, but felt so awkward sitting on the windowsill with peoples' behinds in my face), I tried to return my ""vintage-looking tray"" (was Graham trying to be cute? Oh, please.), but the problem is... where do you put it? There was no stack of trays near the front or in the middle. I asked the cashier and she took it for me muttering, ""Oh you can give it to me... otherwise, you'd have to move to the back and... well, yeah..."" Okay, obviously even SHE was annoyed that there's no efficient way to return the trays.  I wanted to try Grahamwich just to say I tried it... and especially since most of the reviews on Yelp, CS, Time Out, etc. were critical if not, harsh. I walked in with an open mind and low expectations, and left regretting my $15 on a subpar sandwich and orange ginger soda sans the ginger flavor. If I'm going to pay $15 on a sandwich and a soda, I might as well go to Xoco. I'm just as critical of Rick Bayless for commodifying ""ethnic food,"" but hey, at least my $15 doesn't feel as thrown away there as it does at Grahamwich.",0.9324,0.822,0.09,0.087,0.5784113060428848

I had read good things about the grilled cheese, so I went for it.  Now I like picking up a big messy sandwich and shoving it in my face, if it means that the flavors come together in a delectable array of taste that simply cannot be achieved with knife and fork.  The grilled cheese was messy, but that's about it.  The amount of cheese was overwhelming, so much so that I felt sick the rest of the night.  I couldn't even taste the prosciutto.  The tomato jam would have been this 'wich's saving grace had it not been completely engulfed by cheese curds.

I think that helped the experience. $10 for a sandwich isn't the most outrageous, but for what you get, I do think the price is rather high. I had the Bahn Mi and it was difficult to eat. I had to pull the pork belly apart and in the end, I think it was more fat than meat. The pork belly itself was rather flavorless. I tasted the grilled cheese and that was a lot better, but still overpriced at $10.  Skip the chips, there definitely wasn't any wow factor and for $5 I was unimpressed. The popcorn with truffle oil was tasty but again, I think it's something I can do myself at home for a fraction of the price. I did really like the ice cream samples. They were tasty and I will say that everyone working was quite polite and friendly.

After checking out their website, I decided to put them to the test by having their turkey confit sandwich. It has plenty of decent, shredded turkey between two soft and buttery Hawaiian buns.  Dressed with candied yams, stewed cranberries, field greens, sage mayo.  Is it worth $10? It's a special sandwich in a high rent area so probably yes.  I'd LOVE, LOVE, LOVE for them to offer this with duck instead of turkey! Now what really takes the cake is their Greek yogurt.  THIS is something special! It isn't your usual, overly-sweet stateside offering... it's a beautiful European (think Belgian) treat.  Complimented with glazed chestnuts, pomegranate seeds and shaved dark chocolate. My friend had the bahn mi sandwich and loved it's fatty flavor. Comes with pork belly, roasted pineapple, daikon slaw, shittake mushrooms, french baguette. (Check my pics.)

I've had the grilled cheese and the short rib sandwich.

Even for a $6 sandwich. The restaurant set-up needs some major re-work. It's clear they hired a designer to choose the light fixtures and the cashiers' hats, but the designer neglected to advise the restaurant on the best layout. There is ONE table in this ""restaurant"", and it's a communal dining table. We thought we could eat our sandwiches in the restaurant, but after realizing we'd have to wait and then fight for a seat, we took our sandwiches to go. There is lots of wasted space - why not add a counter and some stools by the front window? - and it leads to cranky, impatient customers. We also had to wait a long time for our sandwiches. There are only 8 items on the menu, how hard could it be to take some cues from Potbelly's and pick up the pace? I heard they don't let you make any edits to the orders, so it's not like it's custom-made. COME ON. They were cooking on two (yes, 2) small panini grills, and most of the food ingredients were stored downstairs and needed frequent replenishment. Again, my sandwich was quite tasty (and probably 1,000 calories, but oh well) and the pork belly was decent but not worth $10 each.

We ordered the beef shortrib sandwich, banh mi, g'wich popcorn, and a lemon lime soda.  Reviews below: Shortrib sandwich - The sandwich was good (quality of meat was good, ingredients all went well together) but was a bit small.  I would probably give this sandwich 4 stars. Banh mi sandwich- Boy was I disappointed with this sandwich!  The pork belly was very bland and tasteless.  I was fully expecting the melt-in-you-mouth pork belly that you get at places like Ippudo (NYC) and Takashi, but got something that was unseasoned and possibly overcooked.  I could not taste the roasted pineapple that is supposed to be in this sandwich.  The baguette was fresh and tasty at least.  I would give this sandwich 1 star. G'wich Popcorn- DELICIOUS!  It's slightly different than the popcorn that they serve at the restaurant but still super tasty.  They are not cheap with the ingredients and you get a fairly large amount for $5!  I think I would come back and get the popcorn as a snack, even if I don't come back again for the sandwiches.  5 stars! Lemon Lime Soda-  Very good!

2011-01-26,4.0,"Stopped in at Grahamwich today for a change of pace.   Some things familiar, some things different.  Overall, pretty good. We went with the Bahn Mi and Reuben sandwiches along with seasoned potato chips, popcorn and a couple of drinks. The Bahn Mi was quite tasty.  Savory, sweet and spicy all mixed together in  a sandwich that's a bit of a handful to eat without wearing.  The best word for the Bahn Mi would be ""fresh"".  Maybe it's the cilantro or the daikon slaw, but that crunch really made the sandwich come alive. The twist on the Reuben was a bit different.  Rather than classic cabbage sauerkraut, the rutabaga kraut had a much more delicate and less overpowering flavor.  This sandwich is not piled high like Manny's or Steve's.  It's a very normal sized sandwich.  In addition to the rutabaga kraut, I was really interested in the gruyere fondue.  Sadly, the gruyere was overpowered by the thousand island dressing.  Next time I order the Reuben, I'll have them hold the 1k island and just enjoy the gruyere. I was not a fan of the popcorn.  And while the potato chips were tasty, both seemed to simply have seasoned powders sprinkled on them.  My friend likened the chip texture/coating to your run-of-the-mill Lays sour cream and onion. My recommendation is to pass on the popcorn, and share a bag of chips to get a sense of them.  They are flavorful, but the texture leaves much to be desired.  Note, I am a fan of the seasoned chips at LaBriola in Lombard.  Different process I assume. Lastly, I enjoyed an orange ginger soda.  It did enjoy it, but it was much more orange than ginger.  It was pretty hard to even taste the ginger.  That said, the sodas are not overly sweet or syrupy.  Be aware, they have a 10oz and 20oz size.  These are smaller sizes than you may be used to given the renal-failure sizes pushed at other establishments. On a side note, my friend picked up a salad as well.  While she enjoyed the salad she was more than annoyed that the only utensil available to eat it was a spork.  I have to agree with her.  Since there doesn't seem to be anything on the menu that requires a spoon, give me a proper fork to eat with. Con: there is one long communal table that seats about 12 -14.  If that's full, you're standing. Bottom line:  it's good, and I'll likely be back to try their other sandwiches, out of culinary curiosity if nothing else.",0.9936,0.812,0.144,0.044,0.4719047619047619

2011-01-21,4.0,"First, those people ripping this place based on the $10 price need to relax.  That's pretty standard for gourmet sandwiches.  Just because this isn't a sit-down restaurant doesn't mean they should be pricing their sandwiches like Jimmy Johns.  That said, this place is definitely worth repeat visits, if not just to try the sandwiches on the menu. I've had the Banh Mi, Reuben, Beef Shortrib, Whitefish, Jibarito, and Grilled Cheese.  The one that truly stood out was the Banh Mi.  A great mix of pork belly and veggies makes a rich sandwich taste relatively light.  The one that I simply didn't like was the Grilled Cheese; it was a bit too greasy and the cheddar was overpowering.  With the addition of prosciutto on the sandwich, I just don't think the taste was worth the calories.  Not that I'm one to watch my calorie intake, but when something's this greasy, it should be worth eating because it tastes great.  The other sandwiches were all good, I would get them again, but I generally keep going back to the Banh Mi. The soda wasn't bad, but the flavors didn't really blow me away. I really couldn't taste any ginger in the orange-ginger so it was basically a $3 orange Crush for me.  This part may not be worth the $$.  The popcorn's great, just like the stuff they serve at the restaurant.  It's a huge bag, and the $5 price tag may not be appealing to some, but really this bag is a meal in itself...so a $5 meal really isn't that bad. All the soft serves were great, but I'm a sucker for ice cream so I'm not hard to please when any dessert has ice cream.   As for the operations, I agree with most people here that things could be run a bit more efficiently and it wouldn't hurt for the workers to wear gloves when they make the sandwiches.  This said, it's a new place and as with any restaurant opening, there are going to be some operational kinks that need to be worked out. Graham Elliot is one of my favorite restaurants and Chef Bowles has done a great job with Grahamwich.  Definitely worth a trip to River North for anyone who enjoys a good, creative sandwich.",0.998,0.753,0.226,0.021,0.4955926748689906

However, Those handicaps don't come close to how mediocre and bad the sandwiches are.  The Reuben: was more of a sloppy Joe or sloppy something. the bread almost was nonexistent within 45 seconds of receiving the sandwich because of the sauce.  The Banh Mi: was poorly architected in terms of ingredients and flavors. additionally, the way the pork was cut was not conducive for eating a sandwich. it was too chunky and fat pieces were flying off. (my suggestion to the chef and staff to go check out Bon Bon on North Ave. to see what a good Banh Mi tastes like)  Drinks: were too sweet. we didn't think anybody can mess up a vanilla coke but they managed to be creative enough to mess that up. and my lemon lime soda had overbearing sweet punch with an intense bitter after taste.  Chips with ranch powder: were salt, salt and more salt topped with salty stale ranch powder.

It's a downtown joint that has good potential because there aren't so many ""thoughtful"" specialty sandwich places in the area where you can buy two people dinner, a drink, popcorn and dessert for $35. Atmosphere-wise...totally a fast food joint. Graham, if you're reading this, MAKE YOUR SANDWICHES LESS GREASY and switch up the menu so your diners don't get bored! 2 sandwiches were ordered and shared, $10 each,  1) Turkey Confit - (should be renamed turkey salad!) Highly mayo-ed red meat turkey salad sandwiched between toasted soft hawaiian bread. The candied yam and greens went unnoticed probably because there was so little of it. If you like thanksgiving in a sandwich with a mouthful of mayo, you'll like this hot little sandwich.  2) Smoked whitefish - Smoked fish with a ton of shredded carrots, plump raisins and almonds all soaked in a greasy vinagarette...and wrapped in a luke-warm floppy ""naan"". I loved the unique combo of ingredients and actually really enjoyed the flavors of the fish with carrots and raisins (!!) but the naan was hugely disappointing. It needs to be toasted longer, and the sandwich, overall much less greasy.  The orange ginger soda was yummy, but it was basically fanta with a hint of ginger.

Slightly soggy when served, but still full of flavor. ($5) Greek yogurt (frozen yogurt $5) was really tasty. It is tart yogurt topped with dark cocoa, pom seeds, and chestnuts. If you ask me, FORGO those chestnuts. Ick. Bad flavor and texture combo.  Service was pretty fast, but there's too many people there doing too little.

Had the Bahn Mi sandwich, which was hearty chunks of pork belly nestled in crusty french bread topped with a roasted pineapple/daikon slaw. Very flavorful, except that the slaw was really ""wet"" - too much aioli which when combined with the pork belly, was quite overwhelming. The roasted pineapple helped to break some of that up but not much.  I'm not one to shy away from hearty, fatty, melt-in-your-mouthness, but it was a whole lot of pork belly and mayo for one sandwich. So much so that I'd kind of had enough after a few good bites, which is frustrating given that I'd spent ~ $12 (with tax) for just a sandwich (no side, no drink) that really is not re-heatable. I'd agree with a few other reviews on here: cash only in downtown Chicago? Doesn't seem like a good idea in the long run. I get the appeal from a restaurateur's perspective, but when your likely lunch clientele are business folks who mainly pay with plastic, I can see it as pretty off-putting.  Grahamwich is certainly worth a second chance, especially considering it's brand new. The grilled cheese and short rib sandwiches looked delectable. And the truffle popcorn smelled like a must-have.

ALL of the food and drinks were DELICIOUS.  I give the quality of food 5 stars.  I love that they make their own soda, I LOVED the turkey confit sandwich (thanksgiving themed sandwiches are my jam - the fact that they put candied yams and cranberry sauce on it won me over completely), I loved the shortrib too, even though the open faced factor made it a bit difficult to eat.  That should be remedied.  And of course you can't go wrong with the popcorn or chips.  They're both homemade, the popcorn is truffle flavored and the chips are cheddar ranch - if you think they seem expensive, don't worry, they come in giant bags and the two of us couldn't even finish them together, so we snuck them into our movie later!  And I STILL had some popcorn left for my lunch the next day! Side note:  I also loved the adorable vintage silver trays that everything was served on.  Super cute. Here's where things go downhill.  The place is small and crowded, so people don't really know where to wait in line and where to wait for their food, so everything gets a little chaotic.  There needs to be a specific place for a line and a specific place to wait for your order and they need to be marked as such.  Despite the downward staircase that fools you into thinking there is more seating (there's not - the stairs go to the kitchen), there is only one long, short communal table with teeny stools that were more like ottomans (ottomen?) and a line of counter space against the wall with no seating.  For as popular and new as this place is, they need to think of a way to fit more people in there, especially during the cold winter!  I understand that communal seating is very ""in"" right now (I despise it - always have, always will - I came here with a specific person to eat with.  This isn't a bar, I'm not here to make new friends.), but this is not the place for it. Additionally, I don't have a problem with waiting for quality food, but for the love of god - they had EIGHT people behind the counter (one guy on the register, one bored girl on the coffee station and seemingly SIX people making sandwiches) and everything was still taking between 20 minutes and a half hour to come out.  A guy spilled his chips on the way to the table and it seriously took three different employees saying ""we got a spill over here"" for someone to actually come and clean it up.  (Props to the bored coffee girl for taking over the broom from one of the sandwich makers - she knew she needed to find something to do.) And of course, I know everyone is saying it, but the prices are pretty astronomical.  I don't mind paying for quality, and the food was very high quality, but I want my dining experience to be as high quality as my food, and it was not.  If I'm being seated at a table and served my food, the $40 lunch doesn't sting so much - but finding my own seat at a crowded communal table, brushing knees with a bunch of strangers and STILL paying $40 for lunch just ain't right. I wouldn't be against going back when I've got an extra $20 for lunch laying around, but I will be sticking to take out.  But where to eat my take out in the middle of downtown Chicago?",0.9899,0.893,0.085,0.023,0.5656592028660995

Kind of intimidating and really odd especially considering the size of this place (one large banquet table that seats 20 and a stand up bar). I am not sure if all the employees stood in front of the menu board talking to each other on purpose to be annoying or if they are always just that oblivious to their paying customers. The too cool for school attitude seems to be a trend experienced by other reviewers too. Well sorry to be the barer of bad news GW but people generally prefer to feel welcomed rather than ignored.  Tried the Ruben because one of the employees behind the counter recommended it, yeah I know I was also surprised he talked to me I guess not all of them are indifferent.

2011-01-11,4.0,"Finally got my Grahamwich fix and for all intensive purposes, yes, I'm a fan.  I decided to go with the Reuben and thought it was really tasty, likely the best I've ever had (not that I'm a Reuben expert by any means).  I couldn't  necessarily tell that the kraut was made from rutabaga, but it served it's purpose and provided a nice sour kick to balance the richness of the 1000 island dressing and gruyere fondue.  The amount of warm, tender pastrami was more than adequate and the marbled rye had a perfectly toasted exterior to hold up to all that sandwichy goodness.  I also appreciated the choice of pastrami over corned beef.  After all, pastrami is the most sensual of all the salted cured meats...  My wifey thought the horseradish in her Short Rib sammich was a touch strong, but she still enjoyed it and actually liked the open face presentation in what I can best describe as a carved out pretzel roll canoe.  We also ordered the g'wich chips which remind me of an upgraded version of sour cream & onion, or maybe cheddar & sour cream.  They don't skimp on the powder either so these chips are quite flavorful.  While $5 is pretty pricey for a side of chips, the bags are densely packed and I ended up zip locking the rest for lunch the next day.   If you're looking to dine in they only have a few spaces at a stand-up counter near the entrance and one communal table in the back that likely seats no more than 15 people.  On a busy day I can see how this wouldn't be convenient, but the crowd was light when we dined here around 6:30 on Monday so finding a seat was a non-issue (as long as you don't mind potentially sitting next to/across from a stranger).  I know a lot of reviewers are taking issue with the ""cash only "" rule, but I don't really see what the big deal is when some other highly touted joints around the city enforce the same edict (see ""Hot Doug's"").  If it really irks you that much then just think of it as Graham's way of keeping you out of credit card debt, and at least they have an in-house ATM conveniently located next to the entrance.",0.9946,0.839,0.142,0.019,0.47903703703703693

I also can't believe this place is cash only. I'm well aware that they have an ATM in the store, and frankly I'm just going to call that a requirement if a place like this is going to go down the cash only road. I'm sorry, when I'm sucking it up and paying $37 for my lunch for 2, a credit card would sure come in handy!  Finally, the seating situation in here is a little bit of a joke. Most of their sandwiches are on the messy side; no one wants to sit at a JAM PACKED table full of strangers while dripping rutabaga kraut all over themselves. This place is basically designed to encourage take out orders, except they are getting a LOT of eat in traffic (myself included). This is obviously causing somewhat of an annoyance in terms of being comfortable.  So - the sandwiches at G'wich are actually pretty amazing, thank goodness. The short rib submarine is 5 stars; it's legit amazing. The bahn mi is ok, I honestly thought the pork belly was very disappointingly lacking flavor. The toppings on the bahn mi were excellent... i kind of want the daikon slaw on its own as a side salad. it's that good. But alas, I didn't think it was even possible to feel ""meh"" about pork belly, but this sandwich somehow evoked that reaction. Literally every single person sitting around me was eating the grilled cheese, and if I make it back here, that is defintely next on the list of what's being tasted.... it looks decadently delicious. Last tip, GET THE POPCORN. The truffle popcorn laced with generous amounts of parmesan cheese is absolutely addicting. By the end of our lunch we were joking that it was crack-corn. The chips are...chips. They aren't bad by any means, but if you would have told me they were Better Made Potato Chips, I completely would have believed you.

I love preserved fish of all sorts (sardines, anchovies, kippers, herring, whitefish, etc) but this wasn't good at all. Texturally, the whole sandwich was off. Very mushy and the thick na'an didn't help. Carrots should've provided some snap, but didn't.  Flavor-wise, everything was sweet. Too sweet. Tough to differentiate the different components. I threw it away after two bites. Me. Throwing a sandwich away. That's a first.  It took this place quite a while to open.

I'm sincerely surprised by all the bad reviews, but I guess I understand some of them. It is a little inconvenient for a restaurant to be 'Cash Only'. It didn't bother me one bit, though. It's really not that big a deal.  I understand why someone might want to add/substitute an ingredient on a sandwich, but I applaud Graham Elliot for not accomodating this request. Each component seems carefully thought out, and it would no longer be his creation with a substitute.  The staff seemed very friendly, and the girl who took my order was really cool. There were a few sandwiches I couldn't decide between, so I asked which one is most popular. She recommended the beef shortrib g'wich. The pretzel bread was so fresh, the beef was perfectly cooked, and the flavor profiles were spot on. I see a lot of people on here dogging the 'Jibarito'-- maybe I chose wisely-- I highly recommend what I had. The only teensy tinsy downside is the shoestring potatoes on it made it a little messy to eat. They added a great crunch and salt though, so they are necessary! I also ordered a side of the pickled vegetables. They were a lot of fun, and delightfully crunchy.  I went at 1pm today. It was busy, but from what I could see behind the counter, the staff was working at a quick and steady pace- after I ordered, I waited maybe 10-15 minutes. No big deal. I was getting it to-go, so I can't comment on dining in. The decor was pleasant. A pleasant yellow color on the walls, white 'light balls' dangling from the ceiling, dark wood communal table. Nice.

2011-01-03,5.0,"Really, I think G'wich should be 4 stars, but as a tactic to raise the overall I am giving it 5. I do not normally do this, but I am offsetting the utter BS coming from a lot of these 1 star reviews that complain about 1st world problems such as ""diet pop,"" ""parking"" and ""cash only."" It is not conducive to yelping to complain about frivolous aspects of a sandwich establishment at the expense of a great point in culinary progress.  Personally, if you're wanting to put a sandwich on a credit card, I think it may be advised that you re-evaluate your assets... Food placed between bread is a great thing. In fact, personally, it is my favorite way of filling my belly. It seems to me that a lot of low reviews failed to give any sort of comparison to any other sandwiches (although I saw some), which is a fault. I also see people are complaining about the prices of things like a reuben or the grilled cheese. To those people, I ask, WHAT are you expecting from a reuben or a grilled cheese?  From my impression of the place, G'wich has delivered a light, creative and contemporary sandwich environment which rivals all others in the city (you just need a couple bucks more to get it). I had the Bahn Mi, which was exactly what I had expected. The sandwich was a good size, the sides seems a little skimpy, and my pop (AT A NEW LOWER PRICE!) was great.  I'm hoping all you reviewers' noses are just clogged, and are therefore not tasting what is to be had at G'wich, because I firmly believe you are all mistaken.  With a vast breadth of a menu, smart and forward-thinking culinary combinations, a nice blend of great design and nostalgia (olde timey soda fountain, popcorn machine) this place tops my list, as I can't wait to try more. Its unfortunate that early on this place is getting this awful mish mash of reviews from people who's ideal eatery seems to be something with a parking lot and DiEt sOdA, like cracker barrel, but I suppose there are reasons why places like chili's exist.",0.9916,0.722,0.184,0.094,0.5725448361162647
2011-01-03,4.0,"So yeah, I can see why not being able to substitute or omit something from a sandwich can be annoying, but at the end of the day, it's their policy, and well, if you don't like it, you can eat at plenty of other places. If you're willing to try their sandwich as Graham intended it be eaten, I'd have to say this place is fairly amazing. The popcorn is a staple from the restaurant; and it's very, very good. The orange - drink thing was amazing, and the turkey sandwich was out of this world. I'll agree that it's hard to mess up a sandwich, but graham just does a phenomenal job of taking your everyday sandwich & giving it a little bit of a kick - making it delicious in the process. Definitely worth a try..service was great, food was great...the only reason I gave 4 stars was the lack of eating space, come on guys 1 communal table?!",0.9877,0.704,0.23,0.066,0.6497916666666667
2011-01-03,3.0,"Let me start with the good. The sandwiches were great. After reading all the negative reviews, I was prepared for the worst. But surprisingly the sandwiches were pretty good. Me and my husband shared 3 sandwiches, short rib, Banh mi and white fish. They all had bold and distinctive flavor, not bland at all. Banh mi was my favorite. Pork belly was tender but I wish they put more pineapple or add some more citrus that'll ease the fattiness. My husband liked the short rib which I really enjoyed too. The beef was flavorful and tender and the chips added crunch but couldn't taste the horseradish. White fish was an ok sandwich for me, the chutney was a bit overwhelming but loved the almonds and curry aioli. The naan was cold and soft, (not warm and crispy like Bellyshack's).The sandwiches were not small at all, of course they're not huge but it definitely filled us up after finishing the whole shortrib, half banh mi and half white fish.  Now the bads: there are too little seats. I wanted to sit down and enjoy my food especially fine sandwiches like these. We had to stand at the bar to eat and tried to get out of there as fast as we could because there were a bunch of people carrying their trays looking for a place to put down their trays to eat. Another bad thing is their $3 home made soda. It comes in 16oz cup filled with ice all the way. We shared the orange-ginger one, it tasted just like orange sunkist mixed with gingerale, nothing special. So we didn't even finish it and threw it away. Can you believe it?? We threw away the $3 soda!!  So I gave three stars for sandwiches. They're good but not good enough for me to close my eyes and go ummm....and forget about the flaws.",0.9951,0.747,0.206,0.047,0.5658910533910535

While mine was more than enough, I saw a few ""grahamwiches"" go out that were much smaller.  The decor and overall feel of the place is nice but I was a little dissapointed that for the money I spent not only did I not get a drink and/or side but I also couldn't find a place to sit or stand.  Cons: Cash only - my single sandwich was $11.01, no drink, no side  Very little available seating - had to take my food to go $5 for sides - popcorn/chips/pickles/salad Overall, I think its worth a try but it definately won't be a regualr in the rotation.",-0.0009,0.879,0.064,0.057,0.4529448621553885
2011-01-03,1.0,"It breaks my heart to write this. This review doesn't reflect the food, but that's because I never had the chance to eat it, please, read on. I LOVE Graham Elliott, (see my ass kissing review for his upscale eatery). The man is a genius with food, but he really missed the mark with Grahamwich. It was my biggest food disappointment of 2010. It killed me, but after waiting 2 years for the rumors to come true, I waited yet another 3 weeks for things to calm down at Grahamwhich and the lines to go away. I had hoped the poor reviews were trendsters not knowing what they were talking about. I remembered to hit one of my banks ATM's to avoid whatever outrageous fee the on site ATM was charging since there's a cash only policy. There were at least 4 sandwiches on the current menu that I couldn't wait to try. Alas, when I finally arrived, I went during the holidays and although there was no line in site, I walked in and immediately walked out. Why? Because when I decided to order my all time favorite sandwich, the reuben, I was thwarted by rules and regulations. I couldn't wait to eat here, and when I ordered my Pastrami Reuben with no sauerkraut, I was told, ""Sorry we don't make substitutions."" ""But no sauerkraut isn't a substitution, it's an omission,"" was my response. ""Sorry, we don't do substitutions."" I again responded, ""I'm not asking you to substitute cheddar for swiss, I'm asking you not to put the sauerkraut on the sandwich at the end of the line."" Again, ""We can't, it's our policy."" And that was it! ""Then I guess I can't eat here."" I said, and I walked out, crossed the street to M Burger and I got a burger, fries, and a shake for less than I would have paid for a single ""grahamwich on it's own."" Did I bother to tell the young man that ""took"" my order I'm allergic to sauerkraut? Nope. Why? Because it would have made me even more mad had I said that and then they WOULD have made the change. A policy is a policy right??!?!?! Your intolerance can be equally matched by mine! The truth is, something in sauerkraut makes my tongue swell up and my lips numb. But the reuben is still my favorite sandwich. I've ordered it over 100 times in different restaurants all over the U.S., but this was the first time someone told me they couldn't omit the kraut. And probably the last. Because no self righteous idiot running a sandwich shop charging $10 for a sandwich and $5 for chips would ever turn away a customer for asking for a reuben without kraut! That's not a substitution, it's an omission. I'm paying more for less! Chef Bowles should re-train his staff to understand the difference. I know Grahamwich isn't Burger King, and I don't expect to have things ""my way"" but I can't eat sauerkraut because I'm allergic to it! I've had the pleasure of meeting Chef Bowles. He is a wonderful man with a great culinary talent. I wish he were there so I could ask him personally if I really couldn't order my favorite sandwich because of some silly ""no substitutions"" rule when in fact, I wasn't even asking for a substitution, I was asking for an omission to accommodate a food allergy. I frequent his namesake restaurant and bought a ticket to Lollapalooza last year and the year before just to try his Lobster Corn Dog when I found out he wasn't serving it at Graham Elliott. I am a fat man, I spend nearly all of my paycheck eating out all over this city. I eat out nearly every meal of everyday, I LOVE new and exciting food. It doesn't bother me the least bit to spend over the average amount to try something new and different. Graham Elliott lost more than $10 when his sandwich maker turned me away last week. He lost a loyal customer. If the sandwich was even half as good as I imagine it would have been, I would have gone back again and again to try new sandwiches, as I'm sure they will change frequently just like the menu at Graham Elliott does. It was the perfect stop for me on the way home from work for dinner. I only wish I would have ordered the Turkey Confit, or the Grilled Shortrib first so I didn't have this as a first impression. Things would be different. I WANT to go back, but I just can't give a business $20 for a sandwich, some chips, and a soda when they won't omit something that takes no extra effort at the end of the sandwich making process. There's just no excuse for that kind of attitude.",0.9808,0.772,0.125,0.104,0.5369528619528618

2010-12-30,3.0,"Based solely on the grilled cheese, this place rocks. It's fatty perfection: cheese, cheese curds, a heavily buttered exterior that crisps up really well, and a yummy sweet tomato spread (and no attitude getting it without prosciutto). So salty and buttery you almost can't finish it. Almost. This sandwich is a heart attack waiting to happen and I am more than happy to let it. The transactional costs of G-wich are kind of off-putting and might keep me from coming back: cash only, high ATM fee, long lines, long waits once you order, and the sammies probably lose a little of their deliciousness on the 20+ minute train ride home. Plus I try to avoid the kind of calorie-splosion that this place serves up. $10 seems a bit steep but I've paid more for less. Delivery would help ensure my continued patronage...(hint-hint).

What I mean is that a place with a 20 minute wait better give me more than 3oz of short rib OPEN FACED on a pretzel roll, sprinkle some crushed potato chips on top, and finish with a dab of horseradish mayo that, well... tastes like mayo... for $10. Now, that's a harsh critique, but I'm a sandwich snob. I don't mind paying $10 for a sandwich that tastes like pure joy between two slices of bread. However, when I get minimal meat and the sandwich is sloppily made, you will hear about it.

I had the short rib (mmm... meat) and some of my friend's grilled cheese (incredible rich - especially with the prosciutto).  *Friendly people: I like a nice hello and goodbye with my meal. The not so good: *The price: I was prepared - I read the reviews that griped about price, but I also read the ones that countered them, mentioning places like Jerry's. Yes, $10 is not a lot to spend on a sandwich - as long as it's VERY filling and/or comes with sides. Thank you, Jerry's on both counts - Grahamwich, not so much. I'm the kind of gal that needs a doggie bag at every restaurant and it is very rare that I leave a meal still hungry. I could have EASILY eaten a second sandwich (but only if it cost less). Or, some chips along with the sandwich would be nice. *No substitutions policy: I get it - in a place with a wait, such a well-oiled machine needs to get these sandwiches out quickly. Hmmm... did I say well-oiled machine? This place is more like the 1953 pick up truck in my grandfather's back yard than a well-oiled machine. I really don't see the big deal in not putting shallots on my sandwich if they make me sick to my stomach. I shouldn't be denied yummy short ribs because of that.

2010-12-29,4.0,"I went back to Grahamwich yesterday, and ordered the smoked whitefish again--it really is that good. It's salty, sour, sweet, and smoky. I also sampled the two yogurts--much to my surprise, the cinnamon one was superior to the plain Greek yogurt. It was sweet, and heavily spiced. I also had the popcorn, which was good, but nothing to write home about. I ordered pickles, knowing what sort of veggies to expect thanks to other Yelpers (brussels sprouts, pearl onions, turnip, some other unidentifiable root veggie). Although the quantity is, let's be honest, pretty sad for the $5 price tag, I did really like the snap and mild sourness of the pickles, and I discovered that they tasted great on the whitefish sandwich. My lunch companions ordered the banh mi and the jibarito tacos, and were disappointed by both. As others have mentioned, the banh mi bread looked and tasted like a hot dog bun. Now, ok, but you can get top-notch banh mi on a crusty french baguette at several places around the city for much less than half the price. So, if Grahamwich is going to serve a $10 one, you would think it would not only be up to snuff, but would excel. This is not the case. As a side note, I don't know if this is a fair complaint, but I will say that I find the lack of vegetarian options kind of annoying. There's something that rubs me the wrong way about a menu of interesting, thoughtful sandwiches with ""veggie wrap"" tacked on the end. Like, here, give them a veggie wrap. So maybe that's a personal thing, but anyway.  So I'm sticking with 4 stars for Grahamwich, but those 4 stars are for the whitefish sandwich alone, which I think is all I'll ever order here based on the disappointing items I've seen my friends order (and have sampled).

2010-12-29,4.0,"Wow! Looks like only the people who got coal in their stocking this Christmas are writing reviews for Grahamwich. Talk about a bunch of grinches! And, if you really read between the lines of most of the negative reviews, they are not so much negative on the food, but rather the cost and ""experience"". But what is the most important reason to go to a restaurant but the food?!? Well, I am here to simply review the food at Grahamwich. So here it is: I got the grilled cheese and the graham chips and they were both extremely tasty! And I do not exaggerate when I say that the grilled cheese was the best sandwich i have ever had (not including burgers which is a different matter altogether and a category all their own). It was even better than the amazing grilled cheese I had at the Spotted Pig in New York. Which, if you really get down to it was a true grilled cheese because it did not have meat so it still has a near-equal place next to the Grahamwich grilled cheese. But Grahamwich still wins by a pig's nose (for the prosciutto, get it? Yeah, sorry, that was bad...). And if you want to know the truth, it was worth the money. Jeesh, you go to Panera and you spend ten to 15 bucks on a mediocre sandwich and soup! And who cares if it is cash only? Whenever I go out to eat with friends we are always all trying to pay for our portion of the meal with a twenty so now it seems that everyone is struggling to find a couple bucks when they are at Grahamwich?!? I don't buy it- just something else for the grinches to complain about. So all you haters, go to the Mickey D's up the street. It just leaves more grilled cheese for me! And it is more than enough sandwich to fill you up (not sure how it would not be??) Unless, I guess, if you are a 5 dollar foot long type (??)...but then there is the Subway that is also nearby.

I should start with this; I hate the entire celebrity chef phenomenon.  I've never seen Graham on any of these shows.  I simply liked what he was doing at his restaurant when I went and the guy seemed to let his appreciation for 90's punk rock permeate his atmosphere.  Hearing Jawbreaker during a fine dining experience hooked me.   I may just have to settle for the memories of that experience.  Has he lost his way in all the pseudo stardom?  This place seems like it was a great idea three years ago and then became an afterthought once celebrity set in.  I often wondered if that was the reason for the long postponement of the opening.  Now, the pricing seems to merely be making up for the rent payments for those months.  They certainly are not justified by the atmosphere and quality of the food alone.   These reviews seem to detail every nuance of each menu item so I'll spare you mine.  I will simply agree with many that it was underwhelming and overpriced.  But why listen to me?  Give it a try for yourself; it's your money.",0.9618,0.829,0.124,0.047,0.6422932330827069

Like: Chalk board paint in the bathroom.     Dislike(s):  I'm so disappointed!!  I've been wanting to try Grahamwich since I first read about it 'coming soon' months ago.  My boyfriend and I stopped in for a snack yesterday afternoon and after much deliberation, decided to split the Jibarito tacos.  What a let down!!   $10 for a sandwich/tacos/meal doesn't phase me, when it tastes WORTH it, which in this case didn't.  Lets start with the foundation: a single, cold, El Milagro, corn tortilla.  (News flash - you can get a pack of a dozen from Target for $0.47.  I'm sure GW gets them cheaper wholesale; you do the math.)  Every dishwasher in the city knows a good Al Pastor taco takes two tortillas to hold up to savory pork juice (stop being cheap).  Although, since the pork shoulder @ GW is dry and bland, maybe one tortilla is just right, so my only suggestion here is that they heat the tortillas a little to make them more pliable.   Lets move on, shall we?  As alluded to, the pork (the main attraction/star of the show/headliner) was bland and flavorless.  Graham, have you tasted this stuff?  Has Chef Merlin??  If not, he needs to work his magic ASAP because there is a taqueria here in Uptown that is eating your lunch (for like, uh, 1/5 of the price).  Sorry to harp, but come on, pork carnitas are being done right all over town.  Unforgivable!!  On the plus side, if you like bland and flavorless, there is a generous portion! Ok next, the toppings:  mango, queso fresco, habenero mustard and plantain chip (singular).  Mango:  fresh and crisp.  Queso fresco: not like the Mexican versions I had growing up, but not a crime.  Habenero mustard: curiously absent.  Apparently every one of the 8 employees behind the counter failed to noticed that the secondary means of flavor was missing (maybe that would have saved me the diatribe).  Plantain chip:  love 'em, wish there had been more, but wouldn't have improved the experience.

2010-12-28,3.0,"Twas a rare occasion where I was able to leave work for lunch and none of the regular River North joints were calling my name so I decided to give Grahamwich a whirl. While I was definitely lured by the name and the thought of some high brow fast food, the food at Grahamwich was okay at best. The ideas are fantastic, but the execution leaves something to be desired. Hopefully, like a fine Franzia, it will improve over time, which is why I'm giving it three stars, but, in all honesty, it really only deserves two.  The staff was super friendly and responsive to my questions and I ended up gong with the Banh Mi (pork belly) sandwich with the g'wich chips. The Banh Mi's bread and daikon slaw were really fresh and tasty, but the pork belly was bland and inconsistent, except for the last bite which was burnt to a crisp and rock hard. Boo. Hiss. Also, the chips would have been pretty damn fabulous if it weren't for the avalanche of ranch powder that overpowered everything and coated my mouth for the next hour.

2010-12-27,1.0,"Just got to town and had to try this out... no line so walked right in, but communal seating was full.  Got the veggie wrap and the jibarito tacos, and root beer.  The veggie wrap  was good but not worth $10, dissappointed the veggie tortilla not made fresh. The tacos were a  mess... tortilla broke all over the place-- and no forks.. so we were eating with our fingers.  Also dissappointed for $10-- 3 small tacos the tortillas are not made fresh.. we saw the el milagro packs coming up from downstairs.  The pork shoulder was tender but had NO flavor.  The only bit of flavor was on the last taco..  all the other ones were bland.  It listed queso fresco.. but only had one little piece of cheese on my last taco.   The root beer was good.. but so much ice... almost no soda.  I chose to get a glass of water and that was also ""conveniently located"" at the back of the restaurant behind the communal table and the coat rack.... (Bring your own water! The water cup holds about 5 oz ) So we figured for the 12 people working behind the line to produce the food.. that is why everything is $10...(paying for all the labor/hour) the girl at the counter when i was deciding what to order informed me only take cash only and I would need at least $20 to eat there for one person. If i didnt have enough $ i could turn around and get more money at the convenient ATM that is in the shop.  So overall-- dissappointing and wont be back.",-0.9285,0.915,0.014,0.071,0.4929421768707482

Well... really the sandwiches just aren't spectacular. They're pretty good to  good. I can't say they are great. This is WITHOUT thinking about the price so hopefully we don't have people here thinking it's another person complaining about the price. No need for the go to Subway comments here... I am saying the sandwiches aren't great for gourmet or normal. Best adjective I've thought of is underwhelming. Take away the name and the sandwich becomes even less special. You want a good sandwich from a celebrity... try one from Xoco. I spent more there, but I loved it there because that was worthwhile to me.  Sadly, people seem to forget that with any place there is a experience (food, decor, service, etc.) to price ratio. When you account that then the place is not so hot.  Sides were pretty good, but honestly not impressive enough to warrant any raves from me.  Go here to try the sandwich with the celebrity chef name, but really to me it was something to try and I am over it all now. If only the stuff was better. Btw... I commend them taking down the jibarito press. That thing just sucked. Even if given time to work out more kinks I don't see this getting much better than between 3 and 4 stars.

2010-12-26,3.0,"I came here 12/18 so Grahamwich had only been open for a short time. I was disappointed to see so many negative reviews as I had been eager for their opening since I saw the sign on the door... months ago. My friend and I met up so that we could split some sandwiches (ordering more than one per person may be frowned upon unless you're ordering out). There's only a small standing area in the front so once you walk in the door, you're instantly in line. I was overwhelmed by the amount of people standing behind the tiny counter - but I found my way to the front of the line and gave them our order - the bahn mi and the smoked whitefish plus the side of pickles. As we were sitting down in the communal table towards the back, GE was there himself - which makes me think the operation was running more smoothly than usual under his watchful eye. Everyone who worked there seemed busy and enjoying the fast pace. The whitefish was my favorite because it was so unique in texture and probably something I couldn't replicate on my own. The bahn mi was good too but I'm not that into fatty meats (sacrilege?). For some reason, I didn't read the pickle description and was expecting actual pickles (with flair of course), but out came Asian style pickles. Good, but unexpected since I had been craving real pickles. If I gave this place two stars, that would mean I wouldn't want to come back. I do want to come back - try something else (next time the ice creams!). It's not four star because I'm not completely sold on the place either. Three stars is just right. Two random notes: I've had the popcorn and think it's only Ok. I OD'd on truffle oil in school because my roomie and I had way too much for two people. Also - you only get sporks to eat with. There are no knives. So when they didn't cut our whitefish sandwich in half, I had to get up and ask someone in the kitchen. They did it willingly, but it reminded me of airplanes - no sharp objects in the restaurant allowed?",0.9443,0.895,0.071,0.034,0.5173357327427095

2010-12-25,2.0,"Like everyone else, I was really excited to try this place. Went with my girlfriend just before noon on a Sunday and was very pleasantly surprised to find only a minimal wait. JIBARITO TACOS - I'll start with the food itself. I ordered the Jibarito tacos, which were pretty flavorful and good, but not delicious. Tortillas were a bit cool, as was the pork shoulder meat. Mangos could barely be tasted. The combination of ingredients going into the food is unique and clever, but ultimately, the taste was only mildly impressive. If these tacos had been $6-7, I would've been very happy, but $10 for merely ""good"" tacos is not a steal. Which brings me to a tangent - I strongly disagree with people who claim that the price shouldn't be complained about. If it isn't worth its money, then it sure as hell deserves complaints. Yes, I get that Graham Elliot is an illustrious chef. Sure, this is downtown Chicago. And yes, this is a so-called gourmet sandwich. But was it worth $10? In my own opinion, no. Not what I got. I don't mind paying good money for a sandwich, so long as it's worth it. Subway has mediocre footlong sandwiches for $5. Xoco and Frontera Fresco, both by Rick Bayless, have outstanding sandwiches for $8. And Bandera's prime rib french dip sandwich, registering at $19, is consistently AMAZING. It's pricey, but I don't complain about it b/c it's well worth the occasional splurge. All of these establishments are in the Streeterville/Loop area, where real estate is similarly priced. A $10 sandwich should be consistently excellent in all aspects. I felt like I got ripped off, honestly. GRILLED CHEESE - My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and she absolutely loved it. She was much happier with her sandwich than I was with mine. I tried it myself and the flavor was really rich and interesting. I'm not a fan of grilled cheese myself, but I can totally see how someone who loves cheese would go crazy for this sandwich. For this person, $10 would be a fair deal. POPCORN - A small bag of popcorn is $5. The flavor is quite intense and unique, but as others have stated before me, the seasoning is not evenly distributed. I saw one employee seasoning the popcorn who accidentally let the lid drop, spilling several generous tablespoons of seasoning onto the popcorn. He didn't throw it out or even shake the bag to distribute the seasoning more evenly. Terrible. Thankful I didn't get that batch. Again, tasty, but not worth $5. CINNAMON SOFT SERVE - Cinnamon soft serve was excellent. Creamy, flavorful cinnamon soft serve ice cream topped with apple bits and pie crust crumbs. Really tasty, generous serving size, and overall a pretty good deal at $4. LAST THOUGHTS - One thing that really irritated me: when I ordered the Jibarito tacos, I requested easy cheese. They said that no modifications are allowed. Seriously? On a sandwich? I didn't ask for a substitute. I asked for less cheese. On a SANDWICH. I could understand if they refused to substitute something at a nice, multi-course, full-service restaurant, but c'mon, a sandwich shop that won't hold back the cheese a little upon a customer's request? The snobbery is really uncalled for. This is not sound business practice, Graham Elliot. What if your customer is lactose intolerant? Or just as importantly, what if your customer simply wants easy cheese?  Rick Bayless, whom many would argue is a more widely acclaimed chef, allows for minor adjustments at his casual eateries. Yeah, I said it. OVERALL - 2 STARS. Taste and flavor range from good to excellent. Value ranges from poor to fair, depending on the sandwich or side that you get.

Not a good start. Similarly, the temperature of the pork shoulder meat itself was also slightly cool.  But most damning, the flavors were just not there.  The meat was under-flavored and the mango, instead of being bright and acidic to balance out the pork shoulder, tasted like it had been sitting out all day.  I also had the Graham Chips which were just fine, and the portion was huge, but not a reason in and of itself to visit. That all being said, my friend had the beef short rib sandwich, which he said was very tasty.  And a lot of other folk in the place were eating the soft serve and I heard some positive comments about it.

I hate getting screwed and paying extra for something just because it's some hoity toity name brand. That's not what's happening at Grahamwich. You're getting huge, freshly made, creative, gourmet sandwiches. $10 is a steal.  I got the grilled cheese (choosing between all the great options is tough). It's a little rich and decadent for a daily lunch, but it's the holidays and dieting is dumb! It's Wisconsin cheddar, cheese curds, prosciutto, and a tomato marmalade which I think makes the sandwich really special on a fresh doughy bread, but toasted perfectly crisp. Naturally I had to get chips to complement my meal. My only complaint would be that they don't have multiple sizes of chips. You get a huge bag of them that one person couldn't eat on their own along with a sandwich. For how much you get $5 is a great deal, but I'd prefer a small bag for just me. The place is tiny. I do agree with the complaints about layout, but real estate ain't cheap. There really isn't much of a place to line up; and there is always a line. Suffer through it though, you won't be sorry. I got my sandwich and chips to go, but it appeared the only seating was a long communal (and low) table that sat about 14 people. Better than nothing, and I think for what they are and where they are, the bulk of their business will be carry out anyway.

2010-12-19,4.0,"Grahamwich gets an extra star for potential and for Graham Elliot's many daring and creative decisions. Ultimately, his foodie sandwich shop will deserve a solid 4-star rating; I ascribe all the problems with my meal to growing pains in a restaurant's first week. First, the highlights: -The whitefish sandwich with raisins and carrots, served on naan, was exceptional. Truly a treat -- this type of creativity and execution fulfills the promise of Grahamwich. -The friendly staff, single long table, water pitchers, and bathroom chalkboard create a unique and communal environment. My girlfriend and I spent part of our meal talking to the couple across from us. I believe these decisions are an asset, and I admire the courage it took to set up the shop this way. -The soft serve desserts raise the bar for fro-yo. Admittedly, it's a low bar. However, there were a number of problems and I hope Mr. Elliot or an employee are scrambling to fix them for week 2: -The jibarito falls apart, and can't be eaten as intended. It would be easy to eat with a knife and fork, but... -For no good reason, the shop only has sporks. My friend was reduced to sporking the jibarito. (That sounds like a sex act you can only order in a low-rent Tijuana whorehouse.) -The side of pickles was an inedible disaster. The menu board promised fresh, local, organic produce. Fair enough -- but when the only relevant options are rutabaga, ramps, parsnips, brussel sprouts, and turnips, you need to wait for spring before putting the pickles on the menu. I loudly heckled the line staff for serving this goat swill. This dish is a good concept -- and again, daring -- but it has to be edible. Grahamfail. -I didn't try the chips or popcorn sides, but other nearby diners were complaining about them. My sense is they felt ripped off. Unfortunately, I don't expect the slow (though not unreasonably slow) service to improve, as the staff is actually cooking and preparing your food. This isn't Subway -- so the speed is OK. The non-Subwayness is doubly apparent from the prices, which I also don't expect to change. The biggest impediment to success will be that the Grahamwich equivalent of a $6 Subway meal will run you $21 ($10 ""6-inch"" sandwich, $4 soda, $5 side, plus tax).

The Highlights: - The Beef Short Rib sandwich with baby watercress, shoestring potatoes, pickled shallots, creamy horse radish on a pretzel roll.  Great flavor profiles and perfectly balanced. - Pastrami Rubin with rutabaga sauerkraut, toasted caraway, gruyere fondue, 1000 island on marbled rye.  Absolutely fantastic version of the classic slightly twisted with premium ingredients. - Embracing my prepubescent immaturity and fully loving the graphic  scenes drawn on the bathroom wall.  Chalk/Chalkboard available for the inner artist in all of us.   Constructive Criticism: -  The sandwich's are over sauced, which seems to be a common complaint.  Perhaps with the pressure of opening weekend they got a little trigger happy with the squirt bottles. - The g'wich popcorn with grated parmesan, chopped chives, sea salt, cracked pepper and truffle oil.  How could you go wrong, one might ask?  In reality, you could put truffle oil on a dirty sneaker and it would taste delicious.  Although most yelpers just bitch about the $5 price tag for popcorn, I understand the value of high quality ingredients and I'm happy to pay for them, not my complaint.  The problem is that the popcorn was completely over seasoned  (specifically the salt & black pepper) and failed to be evenly distributed throughout the bag.  I have had this at Graham Elliot before in a much smaller portion and it was perfect.  GE, this should be an easy fix...... - The g'wich pickles:  This was misleading, although in all fairness it does say seasonal veggies.  The pickle, usually a perfect accompaniment to a delicious sandwich, would have been right on the money.  What I received was a C- at best.  The pickled veggies which consisted of a couple slices of carrots, beets, pearl onions and what appeared to be pineapple core, were bland and severely under pickled.  GE, you should hook up with a guy like Paul Virant from Vie and learn what pickling is all about. - The four sandwich limit:  When you walk in the door you are made aware of two things right off the bat.  One, this is a cash only (Greek Diner style establishment) and two, there is a four sandwich per person limit.  That is such horse-shit.  Not that I want more than four sandwiches for myself, but I think its funny when people try to feign scarcity and build demand.  Unless you really just don't give a fuck, like Doug Sohn of Hot Dougs fame, this is a poor business model. Kiss any chance of scoring corporate accounts goodbye. Overall I think Graham Elliot has brought a fun concept and much needed gourmet sandwich shop to River North and I would absolutely go back.  I look forward to trying the soft serve and the soda, both of which have received high marks.  There is definitely tremendous potential for Grahamwich which will be fully realized with a little refinement. As Graham works on building his restaurant empire and admittedly shameless self branding, I look forward to eating at Grahamburger, Grahamburrito, Grahambalaya....",0.99,0.827,0.121,0.053,0.5700780640124902
2010-12-18,2.0,"I was excited, like many others, after reading the Red Eye feature about a very accessible and casual Graham Elliott sandwich shop. This cozy eatery is quite vibrant on entry, with an easy to read menu on the wall. I ordered three sandwiches for carryout: the Shortrib, Banh Mi, and Reuben, as well as a bag of popcorn. As I was waiting for the sandwiches, I could tell that the workers (or cooks?) behind the counter were very frantic and unorganized. They were moving between and behind each other, refilling dressings into bottles at the counter, putting things in the oven, and then turning around to start another sandwich, then telling somebody else to pull the sandwich out of the oven. I even heard one of the cooks had to refire a grilled cheese sandwich. Really? And then another cook served up some nice shortrib for a sandwich that was already made... But I didn't care too much, since I'm pretty patient and understand mistakes can be made... except when it's my food. Unfortunately, when I got home, I found out they made a mistake in my order, putting two shortrib sandwiches in, and missing the banh mi sandwich. Kind of unacceptable for a Graham Elliott restaurant I would think. (Minus 1 BIG star) Anyways, as for the food itself, the popcorn to start off with is very tasty. A nice kick with good flavors. My sister-in-law instantly noticed the truffle oil. The Reuben is nice since it's made with pastrami, and the condiments go well with each other. However, it is a little on the greasy side as it seems to be grilled in butter or some kind of oil. The Shortrib sandwich is a good idea, especially sitting on a soft pretzel roll. The shortrib itself, however, was kind of bland. It was missing either some kind of marinade or seasonings. And I was expecting more of a kick from the horseradish dressing. This young sandwich shop has some great concepts and a lot of potential, but as of right now, it is very unorganized and the food and kitchen need a bit of refinement. I would probably give this place another try in a couple of months. Hopefully by then, they will have worked out the kinks. But for $10 sandwiches, my wallet can't give them too many shots.",0.9228,0.884,0.079,0.037,0.5838732004429679
2010-12-18,4.0,"I wanted to give Grahamwich 5 stars only because I got to see Graham Elliot today in person and speak with him briefly! (I love Top Chef so I was real excited) Only reason a star was lost is because the sandwiches were good, but not GREAT. If you want a GREAT sandwich go to Panes on Sheffield.  Anyway, Graham Elliot was so knowledgeable, passionate, friendly, and genuinely excited to greet everyone that came into Grahamwich. He was giving the line cooks tips and making special coffee drinks while casually chatting with customers. I love that he was approachable and hands on, to me this is the true mark of an outstanding chef. Kudos for creating innovative, high-end, delicious cuisine at Graham Elliot, but he's really commendable for branching out and putting together a whole other thing, worthy sandwiches in a totally different setting.  I went for lunch on a Saturday, walked in at 11:30 with barely a wait (awesome). I got the Jibarito tacos and my boyfriend got the Bahn Mi. I loved my tacos, LOVED the popcorn, and loved the few bites I got of his sandwich. His only complaint was too much mayo (it was kinda drowning) and the white bread. I would most definitely go back and try the veggie, whitefish, or grilled cheese. If your downtown and need a fun new lunch place, GO! The atmosphere was clean and pleasant, I enjoyed the communal seating and looking down the long table to get a sneak peek at what the other sandwiches looked like.

There was a lot of ice too.  I wouldn't order my the pastrami Reuben again, I would go back to try what looked like a really good short rib sandwich in a pretzel roll.

2010-12-18,4.0,"There's a lot of complaining on here by people, but either their expectations were way out of control or they had a very different experience than I did. 5 minutes into eating I turned to my friend and told her grahamwich is a place where nothing bad can happen.  We both had the whitefish on naan, which not a lot of people on here seem to have tried; it looked enormous to me (so not the ""small"" or ""over-priced"" portions other have mentioned). I still managed to eat every bite. The marcona almonds, raisin chutney, carrots and aioli were delicious and well-proportioned. The naan did start to fall apart at the end, but only because so much was crammed in, not because it was poorly made. We also got the truffle popcorn. We could have split one bag between us as we were very full from sandwiches. It was good but does not keep well - needs to be eaten ASAP.  We also got samples from Graham himself, as an apology for the crowd and wait;  we tried both the cinnamon stick and Greek yogurt with dark chocolate and chestnuts. Different sensations - one very sweet, and the other very tart - but both tasty. As for the crowds and wait. We got through line quickly. The cash only thing was an issue as I didn't have enough cash on me to get a drink and I wanted to try the vanilla kola - I would have spent much money given the opportunity so I hope they allow debit soon. Also, although seating was limited, people were being polite, not sitting until they got their food and getting up as soon as they were done.  As mentioned in some reviews, music was fun, all the staff was smiling and friendly despite being so busy, and the decor was cute.

2010-12-18,3.0,"Graham Elliot versus the Perception of Value - $10 sandwiches in River North! As our office is in the River North area, we have been quite aware of Grammwich's impending presence back when it seemed like it would open back in the summer. It only seemed right  to give it a try on its opening week, though I'd thought I'd miss a bit of the lunch rush by going after 1:30 pm. Though the line wasn't out the door, it was about a 15 minute wait until I was able to order my sandwiches. Also, it wasn't quite clear where to line up to order either, no signs or staff people tried to help in that regard. There was a staff person that shouted out occasionally, to apparently no one in particular it seemed (rather than to the people in the order line) that there was a 4 sandwich order maximum, CASH only, and that they were out of the Jibarito Press. Um, what? How are you already out of a sandwich? I was considering ordering that, but I was saved from myself, as it turns out that sandwich has been getting the least favorable reviews according to fellow Yelpers and the Red Eye. Anyway, I finally get to order: a Banh Mi for a coworker, a Beef Shortrib for myself, and just in case sides are necessary (called Snacks here), I grabbed a bag of Chips and Popcorn. I gave my name and the wait began!  Then, in another opening week logistical challenge, it became unclear where you were supposed to wait. There was a holding pen area (complete with separator rope) that appeared to be conceived as the ordered queue, but since the limited community seating was in the back, people were splitting up between this area, and trying to stay near the seating area in case spots opened up. This lead to some somewhat comical moments when a name would be called out a couple of times, some times repeated by Graham Elliot himself. A lot of times, the only reason for the delay was because these folks had to extract themselves from the back. The funniest line that Graham threw out in this situation was ""If you don't come pick this up, I'm going to eat your order."" Funny because he was partially joking, partially annoyed, and partially I wasn't sure if he seriously MIGHT just eat it! Finally, after a shorter wait for the food, and a short walk back to office, here's my impression of the sandwiches. For $10, you look at the sandwich, and it already feels like you should have more. Or maybe it should cost less. Or maybe it should come with a pinch of a side, like a small bag of chips or a small bag of popcorn. I truly think that the Perception of Value is what Gramwich's biggest challenge is going to be over time. The same principle also applies to the Chips and Popcorn, where for $5 a piece, you just *feel* like you should be getting more. Oh, right. How did it taste?  The Beef Shortrib was pretty tasty. A nice mix of texture and taste, from the lightly fried thin strip of shoestring potatoes on top, the juicy, well seasoned beef shortrib in the middle with the horseradish, and the soft pretzel bread on the bottom; it was great combination of ingredients and textures. It plays out as an open face sandwich, so you'll want to plan your eating strategy accordingly. Tasty? Sure! But does it feel like it should be a $10 sandwich? Decide for yourself. On the first bite into the Popcorn, the flavor seemed fine, but I could already tell that I would start to like it less and less the more time went on. Despite splitting the bag with a co-worker (and trying to share it with more folks in the office), we ended up not finishing it.  The Chips on the other hand delivered a much more consistent experience and taste. Although it looked like a small bag, we ended up not finishing that either. The ambiance of the location was very nice, and it wouldn't surprise me if Graham had a hand in all the little details, such as the fixtures, the hats worn by the staff,  the presence of a chalkboard in the bathroom, and even the spigots for the root beer.  Overall, I think it's an okay place to have a sandwich, I'm not quite convinced it will crack into my regular lunch rotation, given that the just-opened-curious crowds will keep things fairly chaotic for the next month or so.   As a final note/rant, it always amuses me when people review the service of a place that just opened while they are at their busiest, as if that is what the service will normally be like. These same people must also review retail stores on Black Friday. #justsaying",0.9969,0.835,0.122,0.043,0.47984488125333186

Still a bit pricey to make it a consistent lunch spot, but it's definitely improved since the first few months after it opened. After two lunches there, my impression of Grahamwich is that it's over-priced, has too long of a wait, and ""meh"" food. I had the whitefish and banh mi sandwiches, and the pickles and chips sides. For the parts I liked about each, there were problems with each -- the pork shoulder in the banh mi was too chewy (if you're going for headcheese gelatinous fat texture, just use headcheese), the pickes were boring, the chips over-salted.  If I'm going to wait 30 minutes for a ""fast food"" lunch, I'll go to Xoco or Hot Doug's in a heartbeat before I go back here.

She also got the Vanilla Kola. We both agreed that the short rib sandwich was superior to the grilled cheese...shocking to me since I am as big of a cheese lover as you can get.  It was just a little bit too rich for me.  The short rib sandwich, although difficult to eat as others have mentioned, had a better balance of flavor and the short rib was very tender.  The chips weren't worth the 5 dollars..the flavor components (bacon, chives, cheddar cheese, etc) are great in concept, but end up being a powdery explosion...and not in a good way.  I think I'd try them again if they could get their flavor to chip ratio better balanced out.  The Kola was good but tasted like a good fountain coke, with no hint of vanilla. I am definitely interested in the soft serve..but not on a 20 degree day like today.

2010-12-17,1.0,"This place was thoroughly disappointing. I was pretty excited to try this place after reading the hype in the Trib and on Twitter. I convinced a friend of mine to accompany me there. I had to remember to hit the bank first because they don't take cash. I got there at around 1:00 PM to join the huddled masses. After some guess work I managed to find which huddle mass to join. I waited in line for 20 minutes before I placed my order. After placing my order, I got to join the other mass of humanity to wait 30 more minutes for my sandwich to be made. I wanted a glass of water while I waited so I had to squeeze by the crowd to find the tiny brita they had set down in a remote corner of the place. I guess they make it hard to get the water so you'll be more eager to buy a soda. I didn't get my sandwich to go because I didn't want it to get cold on the way back to work. That was a mistake. Now I had to make way through the crowd to snag a seat (an ottoman actually) at the community table. It was a tiny table that could seat maybe about 12 people. It's ridiculous that this place even attempts to have seating there. It's so tiny, they should just scrap the table and add another prep station. As for the food, it wasn't bad. All the sandwiches are $10. I had the short rib and my friend had the reuben. The short rib was pretty tasty but a little small. It was also hard to eat. Rather than using two pieces of bread, they just stack the ingredients on top of a roll, making it really easy to fall apart. I had a bite of my friend's reuben, it tasted fine but didn't seem worth the $10 and the 50 minute wait.

We didn't try any popcorn, but I will agree with others--$5 is a bit steep for popcorn, even very good popcorn. Service was pretty friendly--nothing to rave or complain about.

The foodie community has waited so long for the opening of Rock star chef Graham Elliot's upscale sandwich shop, and believe me, I was at the front of the pack. Last Night I tweeted to Elliot, ""I think I've googled grahamwich more times than you..."",  which he responded generously to, saying that my first time in was on him. :)  I had a single final exam today, the opening day, and it started at 10:30. Well, I got myself up earlier than I previously planned, so I could race to Grahamwich and get me some Metropolis Coffee and Fritz pastries. And as I walked in I saw the man himself standing in the window. I placed my order and payed. And he then asserted that he was going to pick up my tab, so I promised I'd be in later for a sandwich.  He then gave me a tour of the 18-seat, beautiful interior, which was built to keep the integrity of the original building. And the chalkboard walls in the bathroom, which he encourages genitalia art. (which I took his words of encouragement and drew a portrait of a phallic family, what can I say, I'm 15!) I thanked him for the tour, and promised to be back later. By the way, the doughnut was fantastic. After my French final (Finale de Francais) me and mother jumped back in the Jeep, and came back for round two. This time, things were more hectic, as I came in dead in the middle of lunch.  I got my grilled cheese with cheese curds, prosciutto, and tomato marmalade, served on a pullman loaf. WONDERFUL, fantastic flavor shining through from the marmalade. And the popcorn. Well, it's GE's signature truffle-Parmesan crack-cocaine-corn. I Topped it off with an orange-ginger soda, which is subtle and refreshing. I said Hi to Graham again, and thanked him. WILL BE BACK VERY SOON. (perhaps even for dinner :P) OH....

2010-12-15,2.0,"The food definiteley did not live up to my expectations for a Graham Elliot operation. In fact, my grilled cheese sandwich was nothing more than a greasy, salty mess. When I think of a grilled cheese sandwich, I think of gooey comfort food. Unfortunately not the case here. Let's hope there are improvements as time goes on, but I probably will not venture back. There are too many other good restaurant choices in the area.",0.6956,0.833,0.122,0.046,0.45625
