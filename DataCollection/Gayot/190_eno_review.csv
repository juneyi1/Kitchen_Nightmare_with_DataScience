2017-08-18,5.0,"I have been wanting to try this ""new"" and ""popular"" trend of pairing wine flights with chocolates.  It was a phenomenal experience and I even purchased some of the chocolates to bring home after. Upon entry into ENO you sit at a bar...it seems more like a sushi style bar...but it is chocolate and/or cheese...you select the kind of flights of wine that you want i.e. white, red, rose, sparkling, etc. and then they are paired with gourmet house crafted chocolates....so delicious and very filling.... I love the creativity of the names on the menu as well...you can tell that someone has a great sense of humor! If you do not want to pair the wines with chocolates they also have cheese options. Definitely worth trying as it is a unique experience!!! FYI-Each month they feature a ENO university in which you pay $55.00 and have a specific tasting of genres of wines, i.e. rose for example and it is paired with cheeses and chocolates. They also rent backpacks to take with a bottle of wine, cheese, and chocolate in case you feel like picnicking.  Great idea as they are a few blocks from The Riverwalk!",0.986,0.807,0.178,0.016,0.5488636363636362

The coolest thing was the flights - they have both wine and chocolate flights. For chocolate, we had the ""dark and decedent"" flight, as well as the fleur de sel flight. The chocolates were pretty good! My favorite was the pomegranate Malbec. I also tried the ""Bubbles"" champagne flight, which was really yummy. A range of dryness, a range of fruity, and all of them were great.

The service was very disappointing, from the host staff to the bartender.

For a place that touts themselves as a wine and cheese bar, the cheese selection was disappointing. I've had better charcuterie boards from hotels as a side. For $30 from a place that makes wine and cheese their business, I expected a lot more. Our total for the charcuterie and four glasses of wine was $130. Definitely not worth what we paid. This place is definitely taking advantage of its location on Michigan Avenue and it's attachment to the hotel. Steep prices, crappy selection, almost rude service.

2016-10-19,4.0,"I'm a little mixed about this place. The food and ambiance was awesome here, but the service left me a little unsatisfied.   What was good:   The place is in an easy to find location inside of a hotel and next to the Michael Jordan Steakhouse.  There is also lots of shopping nearby if you want to engage in some retail therapy before or after.  There is a happy hour during the week in which wine flights are half off.  Most of the wines included with the wine flights are $30 and up per bottle, so happy hour between 4-6 is a good deal if you happen to be in the area during the week.  I had the bubbles flight, and I really liked each of the ones included with this flight.  To snack on, I had the mozzarella pizza, cheddar is better cheese plate, and smoked salmon deviled eggs.  All were worth getting, but I liked the pizza and cheese plate the most.   What was meh:  Our waitress was okay at first, but towards the end of our visit she was hard to get a hold of.  Also, if you are coming with a group, I suggest that everyone bring cash.  One of my friends helped our waitress separate the orders by person, but the waitress still charged all of our cards incorrectly.",0.9909,0.756,0.196,0.048,0.525
2016-10-19,3.0,"My experience was pretty good until the end.  I started with the port wine flight, which consisted of 3 sweeter wines. I liked that it included more expensive wines. For happy hour, wine by the glass and flights are 50% off, which is definitely worth going to try. For me the $19 regular price for a flight is a lot, but at least they give you expensive good quality wine.  The best value on their food menu is the pizza. It is $11 which is pretty normal for anywhere you go and it feeds two to three people. This was probably the only thing on the menu that didn't have a huge up charge.  We also shared the ""cheddar is better,"" which consisted of three cheddar cheeses, bread, jam, nuts, and grapes. I enjoyed all of it except for one of the cheeses. It was good to split between two people.  So I knew that the chocolate was going to be way over priced, given you get 3 pieces for $11, but I thought ""Hey, if they are pricing 3 pieces of chocolate that high, they are making a statement that it is going to be worth it."" Well, it wasn't worth it. For one, a lot of pictures show very beautiful plates of chocolate with hearts in coco powder or their logo. My plate was simply three chocolates, nothing exciting. So they lost me on presentation value. Second, they weren't just 3 pieces of chocolate, they were three incredibly small pieces of chocolate. You're really going to charge me $11 for practically one piece of chocolate!!!??? I thought it was ridiculous. The chocolates were very good but I would NEVER buy it again because the value just wasn't there for me.  Our waitress started out ok but once I asked her to separate our checks for three people, she expressed ""that I should have asked for that when I ordered."" COME ON, It's 2016, you are telling me that you really can't split up 3 people's checks, especially if I remind you what we each person ordered! She then gave me one bill and said we could use three credit cards, I tried to make it really simple and clear but we all got charged incorrect amounts. It wasn't even that busy. I'm sorry I was an inconvenience to you. She also got really slow as the dinner progressed and it took awhile to get our check.

2014-10-05,1.0,"Worst hospitality experience ever! My second review, going hand in hand with the review of the InterContinental Hotel. Staff of Eno Wine Bar are at best inept at their jobs and have no clue how to treat/handle guests of the hotel and should probably be removed from their positions or should attend remedial managers training.  My husband and I live in the near west burbs and are in our mid 30's. Every once in a while we come in for a night in the city for special occasions. This was the case on last Friday to celebrate my husband's birthday. During dinner we had wine with our meal, and decided that we wanted to go to another bar afterward, and committed to booking a hotel room for the night so that we would not be driving for the evening. We book the InterContinental online. One of the reasons was to try out Eno Wine Bar. After dinner we checked in at the hotel, then left to go to the other establishment for a couple drinks, knowing we'd return in enough time to visit Eno before the 1 am closing time. To get to the point of this review, we were denied service at the Eno Wine Bar because someone there decided we had been ""over served.""  We had never experienced this before, EVER. We didn't know what we did that was the basis of this determination, and they didn't like the fact that we would ask questions. We didn't believe we were walking or talking funny. We got a real run around just because they didn't want to properly answer a simple question for us. When we finally did get a response from the waitress, it was because we ""looked tired"" that we must therefore have been over served.  When I ask to speak with a manager, I end up getting the manager from Michael Jordan's steakhouse (who does not work at the wine bar). He gives us the same run around (at this point I'm rather ticked). We didn't understand the ""looking tired"" explanation. When did looking tired become the basis for such a determination? It seemed like a response pulled out of nowhere, and we weren't satisfied with it. We assured him that if it's really about (looking tired) that we were in fact guests of the hotel and wouldn't be driving afterward. It became obvious talking to this guy was a waste of time. He didn't care that we were trying to just get answers and added more insult to injury by saying that ""he understands why they decided not to serve us."" (Yes, because at this point, I was pretty livid over this nonsense). After this, we no longer wanted to order anything there, it became about the principle of how we were being treated when we'd done nothing to deserve such treatment. I proceeded back to the hotel lobby, where I briefly spoke with a gentleman to try and explain. He says that he would need to refer me to the night security manager as he could not address the issue. The next hour was a lot of us sitting in the lobby waiting for the night security manager to do his job, go and ask questions etc. Even the security manager knew to take us seriously once I started asking for his and everyone's names. It became apparent to him we weren't as out of it as everyone was assuming. In the meantime, John Doe behind us in Michael Jordan's gets into a drunken argument with his pals and starts dropping F-bombs! Security manager excuses himself to go address, and the guy tells him to ""F"" off. Yet that guy was allowed to stay in the restaurant (and probably order more drinks). We were nowhere near anything like that! Finally tell the night security guy that this is the most horribly we've been treated at a hotel, and then I tell him we are going to go up, get our things and check out of the hotel...had zero interest in staying at that point. So we do, we come back down...night security guy is still in the lobby, we go around to a woman sitting at a desk and tell her we are there to check out, a refund would be nice, but if not, okay we just want to go.  She then says to us, ""my night manager here would like to speak with you about everything."" Guess who the hotel night manager was?? Same gentleman who previously said he couldn't address our issue and passed us off to the night security manager. So basically, we just kept getting pushed around to other people, because the employees that were actually responsible for dealing with this situation didn't want to, and everyone thought they could just keep passing us around until we would decide to give up. Zero respect! Night manager then tried to placate us to keep us at the hotel (why would he really have cared if we left?)  Offers a bucket of beers or to send up a couple glasses of wine. I defer to my husband at this point, since it was his evening...he doesn't want to have to look for another hotel, so we start to head up to the room to wait for measly wine. Night manager then also offers us vouchers for breakfast. I was sure to tell him these offerings were not going to prevent me from writing reviews online of the hotel and Eno Wine Bar.

Food: We ordered the salmon bruschetta.  You can get one for $4 or three for $10 or $11 bucks I believe.  It was delightful and a perfect pairing for our wine.  If we didnt have a dinner reservation I would have ordered more. Ambiance: The space was very quiet.  Its not hip and bustling and happening so go for a first date or quick drink with a friend downtown if you want something quiet and a lil icognito.   We were there for an hour on a Friday and there were only 7-8 people in the bar. Price: Its up there.  My glass was $14 and my boyfriends was $22.  They were both good, but we were both like hot damn this is a bit much. LoL.  But atleast it was a delicious experience.

We probably would not have stopped in there otherwise, but am so glad that we did. Having worked in a brewery for a couple of years, I was familiar with the concept of a flight, but had never considered that such an idea could be extended to wine. Let's just say... mind blown (obviously does not take much). I ordered the Tickled Pink flight which provided three varieties of Brut Rose. The M. Lawrence was my absolute favorite of the three. Plan to buy a bottle next time I need to celebrate something, like the end of a tough week or maybe just the end of a completely average day. So delicious. We also ordered a cheese plate served with bread, nuts and pickled grapes. Pickled grapes, you say? Yes, I did. I love cheese, but can't remember much about the plate other than the pickled grapes as they were so amazing. Who would have thought to pickle a grape? Well, obviously Eno did and with great success. They taste just like a really juicy grape at first blush and then explode on your tongue with flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg. So awesome, and the unexpected standout on the cheese plate.

The business is located in a beautiful building with an old-world interior design of dark woods and intricately carved ceiling tiles and moldings. Being enveloped into this feeling of warmth and opulence, you are instantly ready to sit back and enjoy the day over vino as you watch the passer bys. The actual wine shop is not as traditional in their set-up, however it does denote that universal theme amongst most wine shop - charm. My favorite element had to have been the floating candles all along the windows. Something about a cold December day with candles flickering everywhere is just something that can't be described. Mix that with some bold reds wonderfully described by the server and some stinky - but wonderful - bleu cheeses and you have yourself a wonderful Birthday afternoon.

In no way do I consider myself snobby, however when I pay for a bottle of wine I do expect my server to come over to poor it, especially when there are almost no other guests. Back when I worked as a server, allowing a guest to poor their wine was poor etiquette, perhaps this has changed. Nonetheless, the server had passed numerous times and also had the time to stop and chat for a while with a co-worker, but took no time to see how we were doing. When we were finished, almost an hour later, I even had to get up and tell the hostess that we were ready for the check.

I have never tasted combinations that augment and complement each other so well. I am a fan of sweet wine and the staff suggested the candy land wine flight and informed me that it should go nicely with the roasted fig and apple salad I had selected. Then the helped me put together a custom cheese flight that would compliment the wine as well, which I found amazing!!!!  I have to say, the home made berry jam with mustard seeds and white wine brought all the cheeses to an all new level. I would have bought a jar of that jam if they sold it that way!!!  Finally my server customized a chocolate flight to go with the wine and did this from several I had voiced interest in. It was spot on and an all around wonderful experience.  If you don't know your wine and cheese, I would recommend going on a weeknight as they are not swamped and will do a better job helping you pick out the perfect wine pairings for your tastes. I went back that weekend and the wait staff were not as helpful, likely due to the place being packed. I think they are a little understaffed too.

It was a great assortment of 3 whites and what I thought would be my least favorite was easily the best, so a welcome education for me as well. The staff warmed up considerably and we ended up chatting about food and wine and I totally enjoyed my time with them both. Also, one chocolate - the curry turmeric dark chocolate - is explicitly vegan. Absolutely tiny for $5 (and I like small but this was small!) but absolutely delicious.

Contrary to my expectations, the place was not crowded, not reeking of tourists and my drink companion and I found a fabulous table by the window - a little more comfortable than a cosy tight table for two, way more private than the community tables, great for people watching on the mag mile. The ambiance was great all around - warm, dark tones, dim lighting to cover up makeup imperfections while still letting you observe the people around you; music mellow enough that you could have a great conversation without working up your vocal chords!  Picked a winner with a light white wine flight, with some help from the hostess - a perfect pre-dinner concoction to rev up a Sat night! Wine flights are definitely the way to go at Eno - a little cheat sheet with the flight helps you sound mighty intelligent about your drink!  The price tag is perhaps a bit on the higher side, but making an evening out of a trip there - worth every penny!

This would be understandable if it was busy, but we were one of three tables in the entire place, and there were two servers. Finally, we ordered 2 wine flights, one cheese flight and one chocolate flight.  Our flights were brought relatively promptly and the descriptions of each selection were helpful. The wine was okay. Of the 6 tastings total, there were probably 2-3 that we would order a glass of. The others were lacking any depth. Glasses were about 1/3 full (so you get 1 full glass, not 1.5 as the server specified). The Spanish wine selection was especially disappointing. The ""moo"" cheese portions were all good, albeit small. The chocolates were all fabulous, albeit small (and difficult to share because they were so small).  Once finished, at least 15 minutes went by before we grew tired of waiting for someone to come over (despite frequently looking back at the bar to try and get eye contact), so I walked up to the bar to ask for our bill. The servers had been talking and texting on their phones behind the bar. When they finally brought our bill, there was no apology for the lack of service, and the server seemed to have an attitude that she didn't care if we were there or not. Also, keep in mind that Eno coupons for the Fairmont location are not valid at the Intercontinental location.  I love fine wine, cheese, and chocolate, but I can't stand pretentious and poor service.

Then we order three pieces of chocolate to pair with it and those 3 small pieces (think pre-done butter slices at a restaurant) were like $12. The plate the chocolate came on was large and when you looked at the itty bitty pieces of chocolate on it, it was sort of a slap in the face. My wife and I were thinking if we both had our own wine sampler and chocolate we would have spent over $80 with tip. So in my opinion it's a good place marred by very over the top prices.

Here's how Eno works: you can order single glasses of wine or a bottle, or choose from one of several wine flights, the net total of which amounts to a little over a glass.  You can also get cheese flights and chocolate flights.  The biggest bang for the buck option is the cheese flight: for about $12, you get two little slabs of each of three cheeses, plus bread (white and brown-and-fruit), a fruity compote, and cured olives and almonds.  We skipped the wine flights in favor of glasses of sparkly Spanish (about $6 each) and skipped the chocolate flights too ($12 for three pieces of chocolate that I could have inhaled on my own in 5 minutes was over our budget).  We went for the blue cheeses, a French, an Italian and an American (Vermont), which may not have been the best pairing for the wine, which turned out to be a little too sweet for our liking, but we did feel fully satisfied at the end of the night.  Deeeelicious. The downsides: you have to seat yourself at Eno, which would be well and good if it weren't for the seating options themselves.  If you're lucky, you can snag a little round table to yourself in the corner, but such tables are few in number.  Chances are that you'll have to sit at one of the long tables, and what this really means is that you have to squeeze between the other diners at the restaurant.  This is just weird, since it's a place that lends itself to dates and couples like ourselves.  The dimensions of the table are such that you feel kind of far away when sitting across from your dining companion, and are in fact much closer to the other strangers sitting around you.  So we had a hard time conversing and, in my case, overhearing the conversations of the couples sitting on either side of us.  But hey, it's not just that I'm nosy!  They were talking so loud that it was almost impossible not to overhear, and it was easier to do that than to shout across the table to my own date.  Next time, I'd get there sooner to get one of the little tables.  Otherwise, it makes for an awkward dining experience.",0.9887,0.887,0.097,0.015,0.5033857142857143

The best thing about it is definitely the atmosphere.  It's cozy, which you don't find many things on Michigan Ave ""cozy"", so it was nice to be able to hold a conversation without giant groups of tourists and their screaming babies to ruin a good time.  I ordered the Sparkling Wine flight because I am not a big drinker, let alone a wine connesuir.  My more wine-experienced friend ordered a red wine flight and said she enjoyed it.   The only thing that kind of perturbed the both of us was that we wanted to order a Chocolate flight, but the server did not ask for our choice, he simply pointed to one and then assumed we wanted to order it.  It felt as if we weren't allowed to order something different.  At the time we just assumed that he was pairing the right flight to go our wine choices, which is nice, but I think we should have been able to choose the one we wanted.  This wasn't a big deal because hey, chocolate's chocolate, how can you go wrong?  The server's choice did pair nicely with our wine, but I think next time we might speak up and say we want something different.  The chocolate flight was a little on the pricey side, I don't really think it was worth the $11 or $12 that it cost.   The service seemed to go on this way the whole night.  A man would come up to us and ask us if we needed anything else once in a while, but he didn't make eye contact and hardly waited for our answer before he turned around to walk away.  We stayed until almost closing time, and it did seem that they were pushing us out because they would come by more frequently.

2010-02-21,1.0,"So disappointed.  I have been there before with friends after work and enjoyed it, even if it is a bit spendy, but my 1 star is not about the atmosphere, the wine selection, the chocolate or the cheese, but the complete lack of customer service. I was there on a Friday night, the place was nearly empty and co-workers and I went it to do damage.  When our bill came, it had the 19% gratuity added already, which is not a problem.  I scratched out the additional tip and signed the slip for $171, my share of the bill.  When I check my online bank statement, an additional 20% tip was added.  Now, the service was fine, but a 39% tip... come on! I got bounced around a lot when I called to correct the problem and was assured that a manager would call me when he arrived at 3 pm that day.  No call.  I call the next day and get bounced around between people again.  When I start to explain to the manager what happened, he RUDELY interrupts me, tells me that it's his turn to talk and I need to be quiet (oh no he didn't!) and proceeds to tell me that stuff happens all the time because the bank adds the extra tip on.  What?!  Who has ever heard of the bank adding additional tips onto bills.  I challenged him on this.  He says that it was just typed into the system wrong (excuse #2)... yeah, because $171 is easily transposed on the computer to $206.  An accidental slip of exactly 20%?  C'mon.  Perhaps this guy is used to dealing with: a) naive tourists who believe this bull or b) people too drunk to remember what they put down on their slip. What this manager didn't grasp is that it wasn't about the additional $35 he added to my bill... I was clearly going to get that money back.  This was about the fact that I wrote $171 in on the slip and they changed it.  Then they lied about it.  Then they were rude and attempted to be a jerk to me about it!  Unbelievable! The manager, after telling me that he didn't feel compelled to return my call because it was the weekend (mind you, I was told I'd get a call and he was actually working... it's not like he'd have to call on his day off), the message had been passed through 20+ people, accounting wasn't open and he couldn't do anything until Monday, etc. etc. wanted my credit card number again.   Yeah, that's right.  He wants me to give him my number so he can handwrite the number and pass it around to lord only knows how many other people.  I told him he didn't need my number, he had my name and knew when I was in the bar... look it up by my name.  He starts to argue again with me!   I can go on and on, just like my stupid conversation with this guy who doesn't know the meaning of the words ""customer service,"" but you get the idea.  It was not nice.  The good times with my friends at Eno... not worth the hassle and not worth the risk of getting money taken from me again. Gosh... it only Chicago had another place I could go to get drinks after work... oh wait a minute... I am not going back, encouraging co-workers to hold on to their credit cards and not go back and now that I have all that off my chest, I'm going to grab a glass of wine... at least I know I won't get charged 39% gratuity and have to deal with a wretched manager in my own kitchen.

2009-02-05,3.0,"""A Sleek And Sensual Alternative To Traditional Wine Bars...""  That's the Eno motto, not mine... and if I do say so myself, it's a bit misleading. While I do think Eno does a good job hitting the 'sleek' element they certainly missed the mark tremendously on 'sensual'.  Thankfully I was there last night with two fabulous girlfriends for drinks and a heavy chat session and not looking for an evening of sensual romance... had I been looking to get amorous, I would have been sorely disappointed. The Eno bar is set up communal table style - which of course is not very conducive to intimacy - and is lit way too brightly with an exclusion of candles on any of the tables, likely because they don't need them with those halogens! Perhaps I'm too picky, but as a girl that loves some mood lighting I noticed how 'off' I felt sipping on my vino without the gentle glow of candlelight to drink by. This is a wine bar after all, right?  Trivial complaints about lighting aside, I really had a delightful time at Eno. Their menu is thoughtfully planned out with an abundant selection of nicely priced wine (and champagne) flights, cheese and charcuterie selections and of course, the chocolate. We skipped chocolate's calories in favor of extra wine, natch, and boy was it worth it! My flight of brut champagne coupled with an additional glass of rioja and french créme fromage flight was idyllic.

We all had the brut sparkling wine flight, which was ok and I really enjoyed the cheese. They do a really great fig/raspberry jam. I will definitely try some of their chocolate truffle flights on my next visit - cheese and chocolate in one night is just too much. I had a nice Malbec to finish my night.

Inside was a unique and comfy wooden atmosphere, not at all pretentious considering the area and nature of the business.  The Sommeliers were hardworking and professional.   The high prices did not surprise me at all.  Actually, $12 for a cheese flight with accompaniments such as french baguette, fruit and nut bread, nuts, jam and olives is not bad.  They will also refill your accompaniments as much as you'd like.

A funique (made up my own word by accident) and refreshing floral scent and taste. Very good quality of wine and pleasing to all senses. Cheese Flight- ""Gold Coast"" 1. Pepato- Sheep Cheese from Sonoma California- my favorite of the three. 2. Roth's Private Reserve- Cow Cheese from Wisconsin- didn't care for this too much.  It was good quality cheese, just not my personal preference. 3.  Hook's 10 Year Cheddar- Mineral Point, Wi.   Who doesn't like aged cheddar?

The staff in whole is very hard working and never rushes their descriptions or let you know how busy they are when conversing with you.

My favorite flight is the ""Towering Whites"".   I have been to this place three times and on every occasion, they recommend the ""roaming goats"" cheeses. They are so so tasty, especially with lighter, white wines. My main complaint (and it's a big one) is that they give you four SMALL pieces of bread to go with your cheese. And at least with the roaming goats cheeses, one of those is spreadable. I mean, what am I going to do...dip my finger in and lick the cheese from my fingertip? Lame. So I always have to ask for more bread. And every time they only bring out four more pieces. It's really really frustrating; in fact, I think I'll email them about it. In any case, they'll short change you on the bread but just ask for more...they don't charge you extra. The service has always been extremely friendly and zippy.

I agree with Elizabeth n.; you smell Eno long before you cross the threshold.  The staff appears to tag team the customers.  I had a couple of gals help me out, who were also acting as hostesses.  The folks behind the bar itself ignored me almost altogether (the guy did glance up and say something once, after I already had my order).  I just couldn't decide if I was actually welcome while I was there.  The space is nice - lots of communal seating, and a few small two tops by the windows. $11 for three cheeses, $15 for three wine tastes.  Not bad, but not ridiculously cheap.  I mean, you really are just tasting - this is not a meal.   I do recommend the flights I had (Hardliners & The Godfather).  The Piave Vecchio was delicious, and I really liked the Romao too (brushed with olive oil and rosemary, both of which you can taste).  The Stravecchio was only meh.  I guess Wisconsin hasn't quite mastered that one yet.  The wines were good - I especially liked the Friuli and the Barbresco stood out (hello, the Friuli has a bouquet of ""blueberries and baking spices"" - sold!).  The cheeses are served with Marcona almonds & French olives, two slices each of baguette and wheat/fruit bread, and quince marmalade. I really liked the chocolate and wine pairings, though I didn't sample them myself. I guess I'd go again if I was in Chicago, but I'll take Cav in San Francisco over Eno any day.  A great idea, maybe a not so great execution.  If you're local, I'd say it would be a good start or end to a date if you were in the area.",0.9938,0.83,0.139,0.031,0.5210269066976385

I sat at the bar with a date and it was interesting to look into the wine cellar and see the staff working through the selection. Our server was helpful and tried to assist us in pairing a selection. My only negative was that she was a little short with me when I substituted in the choices we had made on our own. (I'm sorry, but even if it is a horrible combo, my date is going to win any decisions that are made during the evening) All in all, I'd go back. It was a nice ending to the evening...",0.9428,0.814,0.132,0.054,0.6394927536231885

I liked the decor and the atmosphere plus the staff was friendly. Eno is a decent bar, I would definitely visit again especially if I had a large group.",0.8979,0.811,0.189,0.0,0.6178042328042328
2007-06-11,2.0,"After a day of shopping on Michigan Ave, the girls and I usually pop into the Hotel Intercontinental for a Kir Royale at the lobby bar (because shopping is hard work that ought to be rewarded).  Yesterday, we finally tried Eno, the wine bar adjacent to the lobby, and I was very disappointed. I liked the decor and the location, but that was about it.   As someone else mentioned, I didn't see the value in paying $20 for a flight that added up to one glass, and even their glass pours seemed too expensive for the varietals and vintages they were offering. Next time, I think we're going back to the lobby bar.",-0.3942,0.897,0.048,0.054,0.5333333333333333
2007-06-11,2.0,"I concur with Alyssa--the Intercontinental lounge is much better. The people watching at Eno is good--with near floor to ceiling window facing south and west.  And I liked the bar-like seating, b/c who knows who you could ""conveniently"" end up sitting next to on a busy night. But that's about it. Service was slow and uninspired--our server spent a lot of time explaining the layout of the menus to us, and we spent a lot of time waiting for the credit card to be picked up. As far as I could see, there weren't any glasses under $9 and all the flights were over $13.  None of the wines seemed illustrious enough to be so expensive.",0.8074,0.928,0.072,0.0,0.43636363636363634
2007-05-15,2.0,"I've been wanting to try Eno for a long time, so I was excited a few of my girlfriends and I made time for it last Friday.  We had wine flights and chocolate flights.  The wine was delicious, and the chocolates were also very, very good.   Unfortunately, you're not getting a lot for your money - the waitress told us that the three tastings in a wine flight equal about one glass of wine, which for $16 - $20 had better be a damn good glass of wine in my book... The chocolates were delicious, but you only receive three little truffles, and though they slice them in half to make them easier to share, it's kind of hard to swallow when you just paid $11 for three of them...  The service was a little lacking in the middle of our visit.  I had to finally go hunt down who our server was, because apparently she ""went off shift"", and they didn't reassign us to somebody attentive.  That was annoying.   You know, the more I write about Eno, the more I would suggest avoiding it.  In addition, like Elizabeth wrote, it's just not set up well.  We were sitting next to a bunch of loud cackling sales guys in town for the weekend, and given the long table seating, they were practically elbowing me in the side, and my friends and I ended up nearly shouting to hear each other.   Go if you are in the mood to seriously splurge (or if someone else is picking up the tab), and if you're not overly concerned with too much personal space or fast service.  The chocolates and wine flights really were delicious...",0.8652,0.85,0.092,0.059,0.5495873015873017
2007-05-15,2.0,"This wino loves her wine bars so I was excited when Eno first opened. However, this wino didn't love Eno.   A friend and I came here on a Wednesday night when we were both desperately in need of a glass of wine. It looked like the rest of Chicago was desperately in need of a glass of wine too because this place was packed! We squeezed ourselves into 2 seats on the bar like tables and anxiously awaited for our server to take our wine orders. My friend and i each ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc (my favorite Summer wine), which we finally received after the waiter tried to sell upsell us.  The wine was good, but I wasn't feeling the atmosphere. I love the posh, yet relaxing atmosphere of Cru and Pops for Champagne....but Eno is neither posh nor relaxing.",0.6718,0.747,0.135,0.118,0.7883333333333333

And for all those reviewers that complained of the sharp cheese smell.  It is a cheese bar as well and if you have ever walked into a great cheese shop anywhere in the world that's the smell.  And if you really love cheese then it's the best smell in the world.  It reminds me of good wine, good times and good friends.",0.9977,0.613,0.37,0.017,0.559375
2007-04-27,2.0,"The concept of Eno is great- a wine, cheese, and chocolate bar.  However I don't feel that this is a standout place like it has potential to be.   First, as soon as you walk into the Intercontinental Hotel, the gorgeous lobby is ruined by a strong smell of cheese.  It's almost overpowering at first, but once you get into Eno you get used to the smell.  Once you are in you can seat yourself which is nice but they are long tables and you have to sit with other people when it is crowded which is awkward and can be uncomfortable.  The waitress was nice and she guided us through the menu.  We informed her that we do not like strong cheese so she recommended the creamy cheese flight and she helped us pair it with a wine flight.  The wine was delicious as wine usually is but the cheese was disappointing.  There are three hunks of cheese and 3 little slices of bread.  so we finished our 3 little slices of bread and the waitress looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for more, but she did bring us a tiny little basket.  Two of the three cheeses were good but the third was awful.  We then finished with the chocolate flight and it was disappointing as well.  The chocolate was hard and crumbling as you took a bite and I wasn't that impressed.  I would go back for the wine flights but nothing else.",0.9008,0.757,0.144,0.099,0.646551724137931
2007-04-03,3.0,"Just inside the lobby of the Hotel Intercontinental on North Michigan Ave here in Chicago, there is a wine bar called Eno. (The full name is apparently ""Oenology"", but since that's a mouthful, the ""Eno"" in the name is emphasized). They're a rather unusual wine bar, however, in that they emphasize three things: wine, cheese, and chocolate - and they want to educate you about all three. Oh sure, you can simply sit down and enjoy a glass of wine or a sampling of cheese or chocolate, but why not sharpen your palette with a little foodie education? Eno takes up a streetside corner of the IC, so it's as much of a place to be able to people-watch as indulge your culinary senses. It does have limited seating, however, so I imagine the place can get pretty jammed on weekend nights.  Unfortunately, I didn't really have time last night to sit down and indulge in some wine and cheese, so I instead got a small sampling of Gail Ambrosius chocolates to go. Divine - some of the best chocolate treats I've had in the States - yes, even better than Vosges truffles. (Although nothing can touch the mindblowing Grand Cru Criollo truffles from Zurich's Confiserie Sprngli!)  I like that they offer not only their wines but also their cheeses and chocolates in ""flights"", allowing you to sample a variety. Unfortunately, despite their website touting the vast number of wines, cheeses and chocolates they had a available, it seemed they had a pretty limited selection of chocolates available. (Although what was available was top-notch.) One star taken away for that. The other main drawback of the place is the size - which in and of itself is not so bad, but because a lot of the cheeses they offer are, shall we say, pungent, you get a pretty powerful whiff of cheeses walking through the door. If their windows open or if they improve the air circulation it would not be a problem, but it's the type of thing that might turn you off before you even choose to sit down. The second star taken away for that. Eno currently has two locations open: International Chicago, and the Ritz-Carlton Lagnua Niguel, located in Dana Point, California (near San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Beach). They are currently working on opening locations at the Chicago Fairmont, the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, and the historic Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego.",0.9956,0.824,0.151,0.025,0.5103350970017636
2006-12-27,3.0,"This is a new wine, cheese and chocolate bar that just opened up on the ground floor of the Intercontinental on Michigan Avenue. I had the opportunity to check it out this weekend while my family was in town and staying in the hotel. It was fairly empty when we were there, but I imagine that's because they had only been open for less than a week.  Pros:  The inside is very sleek and dark. There are small tables for two next to the windows which look out onto Michigan Avenue, while the main part of the bar has long high tables which seat about a dozen people. One really creative touch was that the table surfaces have cut outs of the names of various varieties of wine with some kind of lighting inside the tables so you look around and see glowing ""Sangiovese"" and ""Merlot,"" etc. Very cool.  In addition to wine flights (which come with handy pre-printed cards describing each wine), they have cheese and chocolate flights. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Cons:  The offerings of wines by the glass are fairly sparse and they were actually out of at least one kind, which seemed odd considering they had only been open for a few days and couldn't possibly have sold that much.  The whole place had a pungent sort of sour cheese odor.  It is pretty pricey and the portions on the cheese flight are absolutely miniscule. I think that this place will definitely be worth stopping by once they have been open for awhile longer and possibly expanded their wine list, especially since it's one of the few if not the only wine bar on the Mag Mile.",0.9495,0.891,0.079,0.03,0.5651165501165502
