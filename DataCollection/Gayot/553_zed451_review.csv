2017-08-15,4.0,I really love this place and its rustic yet Urban appeal and Decor we sat in the bar area which had a wooded modern  appeal. As we walked around to get acquainted with the restaurant we noticed another area which had plenty of greenery and lots of lighting and Astaire Clarice going up to who knew where but it was absolutely gorgeous for photo-taking in getting the correct lighting and correct perfect pose As for the food we got a variety of appetizers including the sliders the fondue  it was was absolutely amazing I was able to share that with the table of three other ladies and we had the chicken wings which we all split but my favorite I would say was the fondue I mentioned to the bartender that it was my birthday actually it was 3 of of us who share the same birthday week we present and I IDs and he confirm that we are all celebrating and birthday that week and mine was actually the same day I have one friend whose birthday was in August but she felt left out so he brought me a birthday drink more of a shot plus all three of my girlfriends and was absolutely awesome his customer service was top-notch his attentive he lives in to us and what we wanted to eat his suggestions were absolutely on point I would definitely give this place another shot for a different occasion Oh and also they were doing a free shuttle we took the shuttle there to the Godfrey Hotel so we didn't have to walk and that was another extra added bonus which was absolutely free,0.9967,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5481481481481482

2017-07-25,3.0,"Forewarning- I visited on a rainy summer night so I'm sure I didn't get the full essence of the place (didn't even see the rooftop bar). This might also explain the lack of a crowd? We came @ 9pm on a Friday & it wasn't busy at all.  The ambiance and decor was simple & modern but very cute. A good atmosphere for a nice sit down dinner. The salad bar was very very limited. A selection of light finger foods that weren't very tasty or unique. A waste of calories basically. My table ended up ordering 2 sides- mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. I'd say these were below average but edible. Now- for the meat! Most of it was delicious (the sausage was the only thing I didn't like). Be ware that most of it comes rare, which I'm not a fan of even though I know it's not the ""right"" way to eat a steak. You can request for it be done to different. Unfortunately they weren't too attentive to those requests. Also, the variety was lacking. Maybe 4 or 5 meats total? All in all I wasn't impressed with the food. I won't visit again.

Our waitress was nice, a little timid in my opinion. I could barely hear what she was saying since he music was close to us. I'd recommend this place. The only thing that I didn't like was outside the restaurant: VALET. He didn't open my door when we got there. He didn't open my door when we left.

The brunch was a buffet but they have rocks on the table that you take off of the plate that they were on to signal that you wanted staff with roasted meats on a skewer to come over and place meat on your plate.

Not even just the food, but a level of service that went above and beyond. I attended a birthday brunch at ZED451 downtown with my 9 month old. About halfway through she was getting hungry and divebombing me crying, and a waitress from the next section came over to talk to me. She smiled and said, ""I remember that cry. She's hungry isn't she?"" I smiled back, said yes, and was looking around trying to figure out what was going to be the best place to feed her without making a big deal about it or showing off the goods to too many folks. She then asked, ""would you like a room to feed her?"" ""You have one?"" I was surprised by her question. ""Give me a second to check"", she said and walked away. She then went back to the back of the restaurant and came back a minute later to get me. She had taken a chair in one of party rooms, set it up in the corner and blocked it all off with the foldout partitions to make a little private room for me and girlie. After I got set up to start feeding her, the server came back a few minute later, knocked, and asked if there was anything she could get for me while I was there feeding my little on. I appreciated this so much!! Especially from somewhere you wouldn't consider to be a ""kid-friendly"" place. It's this kind of service that really makes a place stand out.

Although the bar was packed, the waitress steadily came by as we asked for round after round, we did not feel neglected.  After happy hour, we sat down for dinner ($52 fixed price pp) where there was a huge selection of salad options, soups, and charcuterie. At our table were stones to place at the end of the table to let the waiters know we were ready for selections of meat. We had various selections of steak, sausage, fish, and chicken. The manager also came by and asked how the service was, if we thought the service was overwhelming or if it was too slow. We gave him a thumbs up and let him know the more the better and they delivered. We did not have to wait more than 3-5min to receive more selections of meat.  We used a first time customer coupon to receive $30 off $100 (make sure to check their website!) After dinner we went upstairs to the rooftop for drinks which was also incredible at night.

Therefore the pictures of my plate so empty.  The reception took up the whole restaurant. But everyone is so split due to the layout of the restaurant. The bride and groom and immediate family sat in the center of the buffet setup.  All the meat or catfish brought to the table were cut in small helpings so a lot of us asked for two pieces. The best thing I had was the chicken and waffles. The sausage was very tasty but the pieces were small. We asked for them to bring more and they never came back. The buffet food was a mixture of breakfast, salads and dessert.  Oh yeah my friend found a latex glove in her potato salad. Yes a glove. By the time I was back from the buffet with my food, her plate was taken away. She got an apology from the manager and a voucher for a return for dinner.  Maybe they aren't good with larger events. The valet service to get your car was disorganized. Another guest gave his valet ticket and waited 20 mins for his car. People that came out after him were leaving before him. He went to the ""room"" where the keys were and his key was still on the hook. So what do they do when they take your ticket? Our car took a while as well. Gave ticket and waited.

The weather was unseasonably warm for February and we were hoping the kickass rooftop would be open. Unfortunately it wasn't so we shimmied up to the bar.  Our bartender was very nice and attentive. Their Friday HH special was $4.51 grey goose. So we had a few vodka cocktails. I thought they were decent for the price but my bf insisted they were a little weak....I think after we left we can both agree I was right.  We also sampled their fried mac n cheese balls off the bites menu which were half off. SO GOOD. What made them so amazing was the red sauce served with them. I could've drank the sauce but resisted since the scene is pretty upscale... The crowd was mixed. Older, younger, hipster, swanky. I liked it. You could tell it was half tourists half downtown workers that just clocked out for the day.  The atmosphere was romantic. Dimly lit and their fireplace was going in the bar area. I will definitely be back...most likely once the rooftop is open for summer.",0.9914,0.784,0.196,0.02,0.48459821428571426

We really filled up on the salads and meats/cheeses (I mean, who WOULDN'T with that kind of selection), but I wish I had more of the meats. I tried the moroccan chicken, the salmon, and the steak. They were all phenomenal! Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Also the bread pudding for dessert was to die for, with the toasted marshmallow on top. I will have to come back when the rooftop is open to check it out, looked like a great spot to grab a drink.",0.9681,0.729,0.226,0.046,0.6451923076923076
2017-02-20,2.0,"For the price, I was expecting to have a wider variety of meats including lamb, pork, duck, etc. There was only chicken, beef, and salmon. It was a little disappointing to spend over 50 dollars per person and not have a wider variety of meats like all of the other Brazilian steak house have.  Even though the menu on zed 451's website has lamb listed as one of the meats offered, among other meats, the waiter informed me lamb is not offered and it ""may"" be back in a month or so. It would have been nice to have known that before I made reservations and all. I would have gone somewhere else. The waiter also told me while we were eating that there is a smaller menu with ""other items"" that are ""included"" in the meal that we can order like mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. When I got the menu there were prices on each item but I paid no attention to it since I was told they are included. I ended up ordering mashed potatoes and I was charged 7 dollars. The waiter claimed he never said they were included.... So there was that issue.  In my opinion choosing to eat mashed potatoes over more steak and salmon saved Zed money, since potatoes (last time I checked) are super cheap compared to meat. So to be charged for that, especially after the waiters loose words, was the deal breaker. I'll never go back here again unless I am given a free meal or something along those lines. I wish I went somewhere else to spend $125 for 2 people.....",0.9071,0.875,0.081,0.044,0.5431980056980058

After reading the reviews by other yelpers for this specific arrangement, I was a little bit nervous, but to be honest, it turned out to be a great meal. It's been a while since I've been to a ""brazilian steakhouse"" but even with the limited options for meat, I was pleased with the value of the meal. We had access to the entire salad bar throughout the evening. Solid flavor and variety but nothing mind-blowing (not a surprise as the meat is the main feature).  I didn't feel like they ""cut-corners"" with the meat component of the meal. The flavors were quite good for the sirloin (we had a choice of done-ness for the sirloin), morroccan chicken (it had a kick to it!), and salmon (good but small pieces). I also really appreciated the deviation from all red meat.  Definitely on par with other brazilian steakhouses I've been to, just less variety. Dessert was also solid - some type of bread pudding with marshmallow cream on top! Yum! Took off one star because while overall the meat was well flavored, the sirloin was inconsistently flavored (i.e. too bland sometimes), and they very seldom came by with the salmon. I would go back though to sample some of their other meat offerings.",0.987,0.802,0.163,0.035,0.40581501831501837

I tried almost all the salads and I liked all of them. I went back for seconds. For the meats, you get multiple options for the sirloin, Moroccan chicken and sczechuan salmon. It was an endless supply. All you had to do was place your river stone on the side of the table and someone will come with the meats. Usually (not during restaurant week), you will have a choice of 12 different meats. That is so amazing to me. Lastly, we go our dessert. It was a butterscotch bread pudding with homemade marshmallow on top. It was so delicious, but I was a too full to finish. My boy friend and I had a great time.

I guess the restaurant was like a meat buffet like fogo de chao so i was excited about that. The appetizers were really good especially the potato salad. Honestly that was probably the best potato salad ive ever had! The atmosphere was lovely great ambiance. They ended up giving us the full menu because we waited too long so i guess that was nice of them. When the meat came literally maybe 3 or 4 of my friends had like UNCOOKED meat. It was so red and disgusting i felt like they cooked it in a rush. It was as they just sliced a piece of meat off the cow didnt even cook it. Afterwards the server gave everybody free banana pudding and that was really delicious as well.

We loved the Cesar salad, and the roasted chickpea salad. The soup was alright too. That's probably the only good thing about this restaurant. The meats were really bad. The sirloin was tasteless, and chewy. The Moroccan chicken was a hit or miss. Some pieces were good. I loved those because they are very tender, juicy and well seasoned. But most of the chicken we got were overcooked. The salmon was cooked okay but not impressive. Our waitress was nice. But the meat service was very very slow.

2017-01-28,1.0,"Completely disappointed.  We were excited to dine here for Restaurant Week 2017.  When we arrived around 645pm the valet told us we were the lucky as we were the last car they were taking which seemed strange, but whatever.    As we approached the hostess to check-in, another patron approached to check the status of her reservation and was told they're running a bit behind.  This patron had a 630pm reservation.  We then checked in for our 7pm reservation and were told it would be a 20 minute wait.  After about 30 minutes we checked on our reservation status and nothing was available yet.  I reached my boiling point at an HOUR- YES 60 MINUTES after out reservation time.  We were then seated.  Seriously- what is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?  After being seated the service was mediocre at best. It took a long time for our drinks to arrive.  We literally went to the salad bar, came back and ate, then back to the charcuterie bar then back to the table when our drinks just arrived.  After our waiter explained how we start the protein service, we immediately indicated we were ready.  We waited quite a while before the first meat was served...it was a flavorful sirloin.  Quite some time passed before the next server stopped- this sirloin was a little rare, bland,  and extremely chewy.  As we sat with empty plates, we noticed other tables around us getting more frequent service and other types of meat.  After a while we were served spicy chicken croquettes- seasoning was good but the chicken was dry and overcooked.  We were also served a salmon that was ok.   When our waiter finally stopped to check in with us we inquired about the other meats being served.  It was then we found out they were not part of the restaurant week options.  We didn't even know there were options.   Dessert was a butterscotch bread pudding which was very good.   Throughout the evening,  the hostesses and wait staff seemed to be scrambling around.  I felt as though we were in a bad episode of ""Top Chef- Restaurant Wars"". Overall, not impressed by the service or the food.  To me the reservation debacle was an epic fail.  I've been to many restaurants that were far superior.  Will not be going back.",0.9174,0.838,0.094,0.068,0.52625

It was only when I received a call to confirm my reservation a few days prior that I was informed the meal would actually be $80 because they added a seafood bar, dessert bar, and glass (more like a half glass) of champagne for an extra $30. I did not care for this add-on or the additional price. For $80 I could have made reservations elsewhere and eaten a higher quality meal, but since they only told me this a few days prior, all other good restaurants in Chicago were booked. In regards to the food, I thought the salads at the harvest table lacked flavor. At the seafood bar, the shrimp was good, but the crab legs were tiny. When the meat came around, I was disappointed that they didn't offer a variety of temperatures but rather mainly rare to medium-rare! In addition, I found it off putting that the waiters came by to offer meats even when we had placed our rocks in the center of the table (indicating that we would like some time to eat slowly and chat). Because of this, we felt very rushed. I was excited for the dessert table, as I had seen that they offer butterscotch bread pudding normally. However, this was not a selection that evening.

We worked with Sammy, and after talking on the phone and looking over prices, we decided it was definitely doable.  Both of us took a Friday afternoon off of work, and made an appointment to walk around and get all our questions answered.  Unfortunately, when we arrived for our 2 PM appointment, we were told she made one for a half hour after ours, so she apologized for having to rush.  I should've just left then, but since we were there 15 min early, I figured we had at least 45 min to work with. Long story short, we were shown the rooftop (which had my fiancé drooling), but I already knew it was not available for the September dates we discussed.  Also, during our last phone convo I had asked Sammy about October dates and she said she'd get back to me during our meeting, so I assumed the she was only showing us the rooftop because it was available on those dates, and asked her again about them.  She said she forgot to check and to send her a reminder email.  Uh, ok.  Then, the answer to my second question solidified what a waste of time our appointment was.  For the food and beverage list she talked about three options for a liquor package, but I got confused when I only saw one listed for brunch.  When I asked about that, I was told to go home, review everything and decide what we wanted, and calculate the final price.  Total letdown. We took an afternoon off of work to iron out a contract, not to be told we'd have to ask a third time for available dates, and to go home and figure out the room rentals, dining, beverage, and minimums ourselves, especially when we were going to be charged an administrative fee for such a service.  We already knew our dining and beverage plan choices, I don't see why we couldn't work out the room rentals and minimums right then and there.  Needless to say, we were in the car by 2:10 PM, and if we didn't already think we weren't a priority, it was confirmed when there was absolutely no follow up.  What a waste of time.",-0.8922,0.937,0.02,0.044,0.49063492063492065

2016-11-20,2.0,"I dined at ZED451 for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. Trying to coordinate a party of 12 naturally comes with challenges - making sure everyone's dietary restrictions are considered, communication re: valet parking, bringing in a birthday cake, etc. For the most part, everyone I spoke to over the phone was helpful and took the time to help me work out the details. Unfortunately, there was plenty to be disappointed about over the course of our meal which earned them this 2-star rating.  Our reservation was for 8:30pm on a Friday evening so it's safe to say that everyone was starving. Sadly, the harvest table food options were running low when we arrived and what remained wasn't looking particularly fresh. Both soup options were also cold. It simply wasn't a great start but we figured hey...we're at a steakhouse, surely the meat won't disappoint.  Wrong. So wrong. Other steakhouses can accommodate requests ranging from medium rare to well done. At ZED, you pretty much just have one option - medium rare. Thus, we had lots of options for bloody meat but the salmon (which was perfectly cooked), chicken, pork, etc. were much harder to come by.  Besides the disappointing food, our waitress was also really low energy. Typically, when trying to serve a large group, the waiter will either make sure they have everyone's attention or communicate the same message on both sides of the table or smack in the middle so all can be included. Our waitress pretty much just mumbled her way through the dinner service. Only a few folks in the dinner party had dined at ZED before. The extent of her value was bringing our check.  Last but not least, I mentioned that I called a few times in advance to work out details. During one conversation, I asked about the side options and received a list of options including macaroni and cheese, roasted brussel sprouts, and more. However, it was never mentioned that the sides (beyond the harvest table) are an extra charge on top of the flat dinner fee. Le sigh.  The only thing that didn't disappoint was the white peach sangria. I wish I ordered a pitcher instead of a glass. I'd actually give the restaurant another chance because I've heard great things about ZED's Sunday brunch but I can't imagine returning for dinner.",0.9838,0.775,0.149,0.075,0.5548378926038501

The place was beautiful, the upstairs patio exciting and more importantly the food was bountiful and varied.  Over the years this place has slowly spiraled out of status. The nice outfits are gone, the variety of choices gone at the salad buffet and now sides are purchased a-la-carte. The French fries was $8 but very well cooked. I recall the brunch, that was solid on Sunday.  We went last night and frankly I am never returning. They added plated selections (tuna, duck, and salmon) drizzled with a sauce but that makes the meat runners a rare commodity. We asked for one type of meat and after 30 minutes - seven request we got a middle manager offer free dessert.  They obviously are run with someone too preoccupied by the cost of goods. It's a buffet experience and it feels like ripping a plush toy out of the hands of a kid. This place will be closed for sure within a year unless the fire the person managing the meat bottleneck.

But ZED451 was just okay with decent cocktails and pretty uninspired food.  I came here with a pretty big party for a friend's birthday and we were seated in the second floor rooftop bar area. Our waitress was super nice and tried to seat us in the warmest area possible as it was a chilly night! Stuff we ordered: Calamari - it came in a paper bag and there DEFINITELY was not a lot of calamari in there. Skip.  Mac and cheese croquettes - a little heavy for me. The cheese taste was overwhelmed by the marinara sauce, which was good, so if you're a fan of that, get this. I wasn't so if I came back, I'd skip. Tempura cauliflower - I honestly can't remember what this tasted like. Hand cut fries - Actually really good! I enjoyed the chipotle ketchup and Sriracha ranch. Sweet potato tots - Also good! The chipotle aioli was quite tasty. Cheese fondue - A little confusing. There was a lot of veggies and meat, which was good, but not very much cheese. Also the pot the cheese is heated in isn't the best design for outdoors -- our fire went out very quickly and then the cheese congealed rapidly, which... wasn't so tasty. Moroccan chicken flatbread - Another good pick! Everyone in our party enjoyed this -- well-seasoned and balanced. I also had their gingered bourbon lemonade, which was really yummy!

My mother requested the salmon and my boyfriend and I requested the lamb, and the chefs made sure we kept receiving those.  The food was phenomenal. We ordered the horseradish mashed potatoes and were perfectly whipped and not to overbearing with horseradish flavor.

I particularly like it for team building style events with my office staff. Forget the price just enjoy the scene and the food service with your friends or co-workers. Overall, I have been to this location six times in the last year. Consistency is very good and the ambiance always impresses. It is slower paced than Fogo de Chao which I appreciate.  Food is on par with peers though I do think the meats could use a bit more seasoning, but the addition of the paired sauces makes up for that. (Note: get the tomato marmalade with the sausage - it's spicy!)  The fish dishes (salmon and tuna) are very good. The harvest table also offers solid offerings. I was a particular fan of the cheeses on my last visit. I have also had the Wagyu beef on every visit and it is good (I do not believe it is legitimate Wagyu from Japan but it's still tasty).  Service can be hit or miss. A few...Karen, Leila have been great. Sous Chef Nick was excellent. Others seem to not realize what a great job they have based on a pay/work ratio.

2016-10-03,5.0,"I'm a huge fan of Fogo de Chao because I'm all about different cuts of meat being brought to my table for as long as my belly can stand it. ZED451 offers the same, but almost better experience. Their pre-meat on stick selection is better, I think, and I cleaned my plate of all the different types of salads and cheeses I piled onto it. Their meat selection also includes fish, and while the cuts aren't always as red as I like, the fact that they offer them with sauces and toppings allows for a customized experience. Whereas I rarely take the chicken or pork selections as Fogo, because I'm there for the steak, at ZED451, the chicken is a marinated in a spicy sweet sauce that makes it worth trying and the pork has a lovely charred glaze on top that transforms it from the dry white meat it could potentially be. There isn't as much meat coming your way at ZED451 as often as at Fogo, but it almost makes for a better experience because you are given the chance to savor each selection as it comes rather than piling a bunch of meat on your plate because you are afraid of missing out. I do like the fluffy cheese bread at Fogo better than the cornbread at ZED, but that's not enough to make me want to go back to Fogo before I go back to ZED.

I reserved a table for a Saturday for four and was looking forward to the experience and ambiance.  Service: 3.0 Stars Food: 4.5 Ambiance: 4.5 The food was great and a typical Brazilian steakhouse. I was a little disappointed they didn't have varying options of how the meats were cooked. Usually they ask your cooked preference but that didn't seem to be an option for any red meat. I love red meat rare or medium rare so I was in heaven. However my parents prefer their red meat medium/medium well (which I think is against the law in some states but hey, too each their own). This resulted in my parents not trying any of the red meat because all of them are rare (yay for me, no yay for the parents). The whole point of going to a Brazilian steakhouse is to eat like a viking and fill yourself with delicious meats! My parents never got that opportunity.  Regarding service - Our waitress never introduced herself and was just a little overbearing. She didn't really match the ambiance of the restaurant. Everyone is entitled to a bad day and I don't expect to like everyone I come across, however she was consistently overbearing and slightly abrasive. She kept questioning our wine selections which was kind of awkward (I appreciate a recommendation or added flavor note, I don't appreciate when someone tells me my wine isn't as good as the other option, and the other option is only $9.99 on sale outside of the store. Thanks, I'm paying $14 a glass, I don't want to know how much I'm being ripped off). She also disappeared for half our dinner which wasn't useful when we had questions or needed something.  Overall, our waitress was nice and friendly but did the bare minimum in my opinion, and did it in a slightly abrasive way. I would expect a better experience for $300+ for four people with how many options we have available in Chicago.  Would I go again? YES, for happy hour.

2016-08-24,5.0,"I did a staycation to Chicago for the weekend and went to a bunch of fun, exciting places, ZED451 among them. I was hoping to enjoy the rooftop, but it was raining all morning, so that was a no go. I made reservations for two for a Saturday morning brunch just in case as I have no idea how busy some Chicago restaurants will be. Reservations were not needed, but they were nice to have. I am sure Sunday brunch is much more popular.  We were promptly seated once walking in. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Blood & Sand, which is a great late morning whiskey cocktail and my girlfriend ordered a Mimosa. Mimosa's are still $5 for anyone wondering and they are still a fantastic value. The waitress explained the process of how brunch worked. (We haven't been to Zed451 before, but we have been to other Brazilian style steakhouses). It works pretty much the same way. You place the stone from the tray onto the table. The waitress will come by with a plate and the chefs come around with different skewers of meat and you tell them how much you want. You then use your tongs to grab the meat, When you're done with wanting meat, put the stone back and enjoy the food until you want more. I thought brunch was a great value. All the meats were phenomenal, which included: brisket, steak, buffalo chicken & a mini waffle, maple cajun bacon, blackened catfish, and roasted turkey breast. They also come around with fresh homemade cinnamon rolls which were delicious as well.  I am not the biggest fan of buffet style and try to avoid them as much as possible, but I think Brazilian steakhouses are the exception as everything was fresh without any touching the food and then putting it back, which is the reason I avoid buffet style. Anyways, enough ranting on why I don't like buffets. There is a huge selection of items at ZED451. I had a bunch of the charcuterie and cheese selections along with fresh fruit. They also have ample desert options such as creme brûlée. All were very good.  Additionally, my girlfriend has a pretty bad fish allergy, so the chefs were able to create a sampler platter of meat that didn't have any cross-contamination between fish and other meat so to be on the safe side as they do serve catfish in the morning. I thought this was very accommodating.  Two other small tidbits. Bathrooms are on the second floor for anyone wondering... And they have a shuttle service available after you're done paying for your meal available if you want to use it to get to somewhere downtown.  Overall, the place is gorgeous, the food was very, very good, and service was excellent and very accommodating to my girlfriend's fish allergy. I will definitely be back to ZED451 when I am back in Chicago and recommend this over some of the more ""popularized"" Brazilian steakhouses out there right now. Enjoy the experience.

I didn't care for the prosciutto either not sure if the salmon touched it. The Australian cheese was good as well. For meats we had the:   1. Maple sausage- good. nice crisp on the outside casing. Sweet and salty taste. 2. Turkey- very moist and tender, seasoned well 3. Sirloin- cooked medium rare to medium. A little salty but very tender.  4.Buffalo chicken and waffle- a unique dish. Seemed to be deep fried chicken breast tossed in Buffalo sauce and placed on a small waffle. The waffle was made well. Not to hard or soft. They drizzle it with maple syrup when serving. 5. Blackened catfish- I wasn't a fan. Not much flavor except salt. 6. Lemon Cinnabon was very good. It helped to balance the meat flavor. It came out before any of the meats. Dessert is also set up buffet style. Chocolate chip cookies were good. Bite size raspberry cheesecake swirl was just ok . Strawberry macaroon was to sweet. You also had fresh fruit available. I also ordered the spicy strawberry margarita. Great taste, but the bartender took so long to make the drinks. Had to wait about 30 mins for the 1st round.

An impressive spread of salads, side dishes, bread, cheeses, soup, etch to accompany your meats on sticks.  Our favorites of the meats on a stick:bottom sirloin and chicken.  The rustic/ trendy decor with the fire pit is the surrounded by glowing candles suspended over the Salad/appetizer bar creates a cozy ambience that is edgy and spacious...not cramped for sure.  We have been here several times and the food and service has been consistently great.  Although, I will say this time,  it did take a while for us to get a piece of the chicken, lamb, and duck but our server kept checking on us frequently to see if we had gotten them. We came to dinner on the early side around 5:45p and it may have taken them a while to have all the varieties of meat cooked and available.  The virgin mojito was quite good as was the charred corn sprinkled with cheese side dish.

When guests are ready for meat they place a small stone next to their plate. Several servers will gradually approach the table with different types of meat on a skewer, then they will hand slice it for you. Everything I tasted, I loved. They had a range of rich and savory foods to simply cooked steak.  The restaurant is dimly lit with lots of heavy stone features and guests are seated around a dramatic fire place.

To start, the service and meal were on point!  We were seated as soon as I arrived for my 12:30pm reservation on 6/26/2016 promptly and were seated right by the fire pit.  The server, a young lady who's name escapes me, was pretty attentive and we were served mimosas and carne until we couldn't move. My low rating actually stems from the service that was received nearly a month after our meal.  We were a party of six and had a total of 3 checks.   Last week, one of my friends reviewed her credit card statement to find that the ENTIRE bill was charged to her card despite the fact that two other credit cards were used to split the check.  She reached out to the other diners to verify if they had been charged, in which they had not.  After calling repeatedly to speak with the manager, she was finally told that the bill would be compensated for the inconvenience.  However, as of yesterday, a balance still remained on her credit card statement. Ultimately  responsiveness of management has been extremely disappointing.  I wasn't even aware that an establishment could charge an amount that was not printed on the signed receipt.  Hopefully, the situation is rectified soon because I'd hate to discontinue my patronage of Zed451.",0.9431,0.825,0.117,0.058,0.5205486542443064

The crowd was dressed very tacky and made you feel like you were at a Friday's food chain.

2016-07-16,3.0,"Really wanted to like this place. I've been wanting to come here for a long time. I was a little disappointed that the hostess seated us right next to another party and also a GIANT birthday party- when the restaurant wasn't even full at 8:30pm on a Friday. I think I would have liked a more private table. I didn't think anything at the salad bar was amazing. The food was just okay. I liked the pork belly and some of the cuts of beef. However, there were some things I tried that I just didn't like. The ribs and chicken were dry and hard to chew. I really wasn't expecting to not like anything, but here we are.  I thought that although our waitress was nice (she tried hard to be conversational and friendly), the overall service wasn't top notch. The food was slow. When we requested a particular item, the waitress said she would go find it for us. Over the course of 30min, she asked us 3 times if it had come by yet and the answer was no.  2 stars for the slow service and food taste. 3 stars because this place has a pretty nice rooftop bar.  If you want 5 star service, a better salad bar, complimentary cheesy bread, mashed potatoes, and fried plantains...and better meat courses- go spend your money at Chama Gaucha in Downers Grove. The service at Chama is literally 5 star. They are so attentive and warm. If you request something- they bring it out right away or at least tell you it's cooking and will take a few more minutes. Fried plantains are bomb. They keep bringing it out. Cheesy bread is bomb. They keep bringing it out. The meat selection is WAY better and everything you try is sizzling hot and very good. And you literally have to turn your chip over because the servers are fast and always come by with different cuts of meat. I just wasn't all that impressed by Zed451, sadly.

We arrived approximately 15 minutes early, & although it was not busy, the hostess was a aloof & curt. We proceeded to order a bottle of champagne to celebrate. A myriad of meats followed. One of the meat presenters attempted to serve a portion of steak & clumsily broke a champagne flute. Glass shattered everywhere, including the cast iron saucer utilized to catch any juice from the meat selection. The meat presenter scurried away with the meat & the saucer. We sat & waited in a puddle of glass shards & splinters only to have the meat presenter come back with the same piece of meat! We were stunned. Not only because the employee had not asked anyone to come & clean up the disaster he created, but that he actually offered us the same piece of meat that had been caught in the glass crossfire, to us & the entire dining room. 20 minutes passed, I excused myself from the table & went to the hostess station to attempt to find a manager or our server who had disappeared. After I returned to the table, 2 servers attempted to clean the glass & champagne puddle, 2 separate times, each. Their ineptitude was apparent. Each time I would shift my feet, I could hear & feel the glass under my shoes & my guests & I continually discovered glass shards & splinters throughout our dining experience. The only amateur attempt to remedy the ruined evening was 1 ""comped"" dessert (on a $300 bill). The manager came over once, but did not see the gravity of the situation (glass...food consumption...poor service...) Needless to say, I was appalled & there are no words that adequately captures the utter neglect the ZED staff has for basic fine dining service etiquette & poor customer service, not to mention the lack of concern for potential bodily harm at the fault of their staff.

Parking is available across the street as we booked reservations for parking at $15.00/all day parking.  Towards the end of our meal I did notice the staff being less tentative - not sure if this was due to our bill being paid or if it was the abundance or influx of people that came in to dine.  Good breakfast/brunch starters, meats, some poultry and a good amount of grains, oats and fruits can make for a healthy meal! Overall a very good experience that brought up previous memories that were nearly forgotten when it came to the city life.

2016-04-10,5.0,"What a great surprise Zed451 was. I met my son for dinner on a Saturday night. We used OpenTable to make our reservation. This feels like a top-shelf Brazilian Steakhouse (similar to Fogo but higher end), without having to empty your pocket book. The waiter was very helpful. Explained their setup and recommended we try their Harvest Table (an upscale salad bar setup on several stations surrounding a fire pit), but be sure to leave room for the real meal.  I had several of their unique dishes on the Harvest Table. I loved the Pulled Pork Cole Slaw. It was actually light and tasted so great. They also had a Charcuterie station. So fresh. Really interesting cheeses that were fun to try.  Finally we went for the main course. They had the standard beef cuts like top or bottom sirloin. They had a twist on them, like buttermilk soaked etc.  It was very good, but similar to other very good places (NO complaints).  Most came with a recommended sauce or accompaniment.  Aside from beef, they had chicken and even some game-meat. But what I loved were the homemade Bacon and Ale sausages with accompanying mustard, the Mahi Mahi, Crab Cakes and Salmon. The Chef's were great. The desserts were tempting. We ended up getting the Butterscotch Bread Pudding, had a small taste and took it home. We were really full. The wine and beer list were great! We will definitely be back and bring others. You have to be really hungry. And if you live or work downtown, they advertise a great happy hour.

2016-04-10,2.0,"I was quite disappointed in our experience here on Saturday.  I had been here in the past and had drinks and apps at the bar that were just fine, so I expected the dining experience to be at least as good.  It wasn't. There were 7 of us who came here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We were seated at a lovely high top table but when we sat down we all were commenting about how uncomfortable the seats were.  The way they are made don't allow you to sit back into them, instead you're pushed forward.  They were quite uncomfortable.  Next, we thought the fire in the center of the dining room that our table was connected to was beautiful initially, but after only a about 15 minutes a few of our guests were uncomfortably warm. :(.  We also had a couple kids in our party who ordered chicken and fries, no surprise.  They were brought their fries, but no chicken, then a second plate 10 minutes later with another big batch fries that included the chicken. During the main course, a couple of the meats were very good, the rest were average at best. The salads were mediocre and don't come close to the other local Brazilian steakhouses.  Another disappointing issue was that I'd given the waitress my credit card so the bill could automatically get charged to avoid any discomfort at the table when the bill came.  When we were done our waitress did not bring the bill, another wait staff member did and knew nothing about my card.  We had to go in search of our original waitress, ask if she still had my card and to please take the bill back to make the transaction. In the meantime, all of that only called more attention to the bill, which is exactly what I was hoping to avoid Overall this was a very disappointing experience.",0.4028,0.756,0.126,0.118,0.5006481481481481

I could not understand my waitress. Literally, I just nodded and pretended to kind of know what she was talking about. But it's a partial buffet so who cares right?  As others have commented, their brunch is set up like their dinner buffet - you go to the self-serve area for salads, etc. and then the servers come around with skewers of meat and slice them for you as you'd like. I'll save you the extra reading as to what was served - my fellow yelpers here have covered enough. Everything was good..theoretically. However, everything was SO SALTY. Holy sodium!! I downed so many glasses of water, all I could do was keep running upstairs to empty the bladder. Everything was so salty even my bloody mary tasted like relief from the sodium.

Our food selection was actually fairly extensive.  I tried yummy BBQ brisket sliders, a mini burger, mini hot dog, a variety of flatbread squares, bacon wrapped dates, mini samosa, sweet potato tartlet with a hazelnut.  Desserts included lemon meringue tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, and mini cupcakes.  Everything I sampled was good to very good.  I also enjoyed the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (always looking to try a new beer at a dinner function!).  Perhaps I will have to impress someone with a full ZED451 experience sometime.",0.9814,0.85,0.143,0.007,0.5238492209544842

A lot of different sections that granted efficient use of space without sacrificing design. The service was also pretty good, with people coming around frequently to inquire how we are doing etc.  Then onto the actual food (where it didn't work out so well). First I tried the salad bar. Nothing was out of the ordinary: bread, charcuterie, kale salad, potato salad, some cheese; exactly what you'd expect. Decent but didn't blow my mind. Then there are just things that are OH MY GOD SO SALTY. Like the sauteed mushrooms? At least it was still borderline edible, but I had to stop after 3 bites. Then there was the grilled zucchini and tomato that just took it to a whole another level. I felt like I'm ingesting salt cubes that somehow look like vegetables. If I wasn't at a theoretically fancy establishment I might be guilty of just spitting it out...  Then onto the sampling of their ""real food."" Perhaps because it was lunch, there really wasn't a lot of variety. However I have to give them credit that whatever was actually served was all good. The turkey was perfectly tender, the catfish was fresh, and the chicken & waffles was very well seasoned. I gotta say though as a beef lover I was very sad that the only beef choice was top sirloin (and apparently I'm at a steak house?).

2016-02-05,3.0,"Ok, I am struggling with the rating on this one because there was a crazy duality of my dinner experience last night. My date and I were dining there for the first time. And it's worth mentioning I am in the restaurant industry, so I have good insight and empathy to what's going on, but also know what the level of expectation should be.  Let's start with the good: --Did the 12-course restaurant week prix fixe: It was fantastic. The meats were unbelievably tender, each with a unique, complementary and not overbearing use of sauces/ seasonings. -----Their presentation was gorgeous, and the chefs who came around to serve them were all of the utmost professionalism and congeniality.  --The atmosphere was absolutely beautiful; pictures do not do it justice. It was open with high ceilings but yet maintained a feeling of warmth and comfort.  --One of the hosts (perhaps a manager based on his attire) was a gentleman who could not have been more kind, He thoroughly apologized for our wait (mostly due to their internet being down), took our coats, explained some of the facets of the restaurant like their the wine tasting room and made sure that we were comfortable and happy. We waited 40 minutes to be seated for our reservation, but we had a drink at the bar, and this man's demeanor more than made up for it.  --Free shuttle home!! Amazing! Now for the bad: --The other host, a 20-something girl, was incredibly rude. This was so strange to me since the other gentleman was so nice and professional. After 30 minutes of waiting for the table, I very nicely inquired about where were on the list. She looked at me and said nothing. I asked if it would be much longer, and bluntly said, ""I'll call you when it's ready."" Ok then.  --Our server: in one word, strange. He seemed like he had something else on his mind the whole time, spoke in short, non-descript statements, and was generally shuffling around  atypically- like he had taken 10 5-hour energy drinks and wasn't sure what to do with himself. I don't want to say he was rude, because he wasn't, but I don't know, there was something odd going on. -When we inquired about the prix-fixe menu, his description of it was ""12 courses.""  -When we ordered a $160 bottle of wine, it seemed like he had  never done a wine presentation before, throwing the trash on an occupied table next to us and the wine key with the cork on the table.  -He did make sure to be available to continually fill up our glasses, which was very much appreciated. And the Cab was delicious. By the end of the meal, he did open up a little bit about his thoughts on their wine selection and what they were planning on bringing in, but that was by far the most human-like conversation we had.  -When we got the bill (we split it), we were each charged an extra $50 for um, nothing. When we mentioned it, he went back and just said it was a mistake, but where did that $100 even come from? Granted, the internet was down and so the itemized receipt was hand written, so benefit of the doubt, could have just been a math mistake. But a bad one.  Would I go back? The atmosphere, the chefs, the gentleman host, the food make me want to. The other host, and the uncomfortable and odd service experience make me not. The next time I decide on a $360 meal, I may chose elsewhere, but that is unfortunate. Still struggling on how I feel about this one.",0.9959,0.749,0.163,0.088,0.5431393298059966

The salad bar was really impressive.  Multiple types of salad, potato salad, a whole charcuterie table, two types of soup... all in all, I think it was five tables. We went for restaurant week, so we only got three of the 12 available meats.  They were all fabulous though.  However, I was really disappointed in the service.  Two of the three meats came while I was up at the salad bar, and one (the steak) never came back.  I ended up eating steak that another person at my table had gotten and decided they didn't want.  The other meats only came by once.  As someone who is accustomed to Texas de Brazil, where they keep giving you food even when your card says you don't want any more, this was shocking to me.  It might be due to the rocks- you put a stone on your table to demonstrate that you want more, as opposed to TDB's bright green and red cards.  I kept wondering if maybe they didn't see my stone, because they're pretty small and blend in with the wooden tables.  Either way, the service was disappointing. The flourless chocolate cake was really good, but it was really just super thick mousse with frosting.  Calling it cake was a bit ambitious.  I put on the reservation that we were celebrating my uncle's birthday, so they put a candle on his slice of cake.  That was nice. For the RW price of $33 it was worth it, but it's not worth the full price of $50 (even with 12 types of meat).",0.9898,0.789,0.159,0.053,0.5465053763440861

2016-01-20,5.0,"Zed's NOT DEAD, baby! Those who've seen 'Pulp Fiction' should quickly pick up on the reference, but in case you're not a big fan of Tarantino movies, all you need to know is that of the Brazilian churrascarias throughout Chicagoland, ""451"" ranks in the upper echelons.   We arrived on 1/14/16 to celebrate my turning 26 and upon arrival were immediately greeted by no less than 84 hobos asking for money.  After what felt like forever, the restaurant manager came out and politely shooed them before the valet whisked our car away (at least, we think it was a valet.....maybe we turned our keys over to a homeless guy).  The inside was lightly but tastefully decorated and had a lovely, warming ambiance. Our server, Eric (nice name buddy!) greeted us and asked if we had ""experienced Zed before"", which we had not, so he continued on with the house rules.  He explained things well and came off as a consummate professional, which I would expect at a place such as this.  Overall he took excellent care of us, as did all the other waiters in between.  Water glasses never needing refilling and the dining area was immaculately clean. My main criticism of an otherwise *outstanding* dining experience was this:    I found the 'bring me food please/GO' and 'cease with the meats already/STOP' system to be totally arbitrary and asinine.  At Fogo de Chao--a similar place that gets equally high marks--they utilize a red/green - face up/face down drink coaster as a means of conveying when you want more of anything. At ZedFourFiftyOne, well......they use rocks.  As in, tiny polished stones that rest in a small dish in the middle of your table.  When you're ready for the parade of waiters, you're supposed to removed a rock from the dish and place it......uhhh, in front of you?  On top of your head?  Perhaps throw it across the dining room to attract attention......none of us were entirely sure, since the placement/location of stones had absolutely  _zero_  impact on whether we were attended to or not.  Stone in the dish = we got more meat.  Stone in the middle of my place setting = nada.  Stones in both nostrils = every waiter comes by my table and wishes me a happy birthday.  Madness I tell you! Inherent silliness aside, I'm hard-pressed to think of another time when I ate as well as I did here.  The 'salad bar' was stocked with delightful charcuterie, ranging from aged cheeses and pickled asparagus to poached pears and hearts of palm.  Very impressive, I could've easily made an entire meal out of just the breads (5 kinds) and homemade butters (3 kinds).  But we were cautioned to restrain ourselves, which was wise advice..... .....because then came the carnivorous cavalcade.  The meats.  OH, the meats.  No less than 4 kinds of beef, pork, chicken, fish; the selection was more than ample and I found no shortage of things to enjoy (although at one point I did run out of room on my plate).  I've taken the liberty of listing all the things that eventually landed me in a blissful food coma: + buttermilk sirloin + Argentine hanger steak + Moroccan chicken + ribeye + duck breast + pork sausage + seared tri-tip + Wagyu beef sirloin + crispy pork belly + parmesan salmon filet + wild boar ribs + About an hour into our meal I developed a serious case of the meat sweats.  I had to explain this to my mother that yes, it's a real thing, and yes, I had succumbed to it.  And I didn't care.  I loosened my tie, unbuttoned my pants, and trekked onward.  You better believe that I more than beat the cost of admission (roughly $50USD/pp).  I loved virtually every item that was brought by, with the one exception being the wild boar ribs, which I found to be tough and barren.  The Moroccan chicken, buttermilk sirloin, and parmesan-crusted salmon were standouts. The wine list was extensive and they offered lots of incredibly high-end liquors, like a Louis XIII de Rémy Martin that was priced at more per ounce than I care to type here.  I was surprised by a lovely sauce painting and birthday 'dessert shot' from the house, finding out later that the shot was made with vanilla vodka and Rumchata, intended to taste like a piece of birthday cake.  Nice touch. Bread = 5+ Circuses = 4.5 Although no fault of our server, they ran into an issue with running my dad's (a.k.a. Mister Mealticket's) Amex card, so he had to use his secondary plastic.  'Twas a mild inconvenience during an otherwise flawless experience, but an inconvenience nonetheless, and for that I'm docking their 'circuses' half a star [no effect on overall rating]. I would not recommend this place to two types of people: 1) vegetarians and 2) light eaters. Everyone else should indulge to their heart's content and can bank on an exceptional dining adventure.  Heck, even my wine glass had a custom monogram with the name of the restaurant on it.  Truly, a magnificent meal from start to finish.

The brunch options are very limited! And the food isn't anything new or glamorous. Not sure I'll be returning.  $5 mimosas were great  Food was just ok. They used to serve a smoked salmon eggs Benedict and they do not anymore. The server comes back to the table with those mini bagels from the buffet area, smoked salmon from the buffet area and some scrambled eggs On top of it. Really??? I used to be a regular. Now, not so much... Hardly any new offerings. The only hot items walking around was that sirloin, that same buffalo chicken and waffle thing, turkey, and some sausage. Come on now. For $35 a person, it should be a lot more quality options in the buffet area and served walking around. Plus the survey that they give the customers is extremely long and arduous.  Cinnamon roll was good.  The food servers barely came around and it was too dead in there for them not to be within arms reach of them if we needed them. This place used to be a happening brunch spot but now, it definitely doesn't warrant its price tag. It has the potential to be so much greater and offer so much more but they're taking it for granted and it's showing in their lack of customers every time we attend on a Saturday.",0.898,0.882,0.085,0.033,0.48460537478394616

My friends wanted to go to a Brazilian steakhouse restaurant so I suggested ZED given they had never been here. Both of them were impressed with the food and the service received!  This place will keep the food coming and are more than happy to answer any questions you ask about the food or drinks. The chefs walking around with the different meats are super friendly and will accommodate any requests for meat (prefer well done or medium rare, etc). Some of my personal favorite were the pork belly (which was great mix and shockingly good), rib eye, and the salmon. My least favorite was the duck but I was glad I tried it and knew I wasn't a fan. Duck is an acquired taste to me so please at least try it and see for yourself if you are a fan or not.

The turkey was gross- 24 hour brined left the turkey with a very strange rubbery texture and salty after-taste. The place was fairly empty. After drinks and food- our bill was $160 for two people.

Great for groups :)  Harvest table more interesting than fogo's version, and cheese/charcuterie/coldmeat selections more memorable (although unending smoked salmon at fogo is pretty great). Personal favorites: wine poached pear, broccoli salad, Rosemary manchego, duck pastrami, port poached fig. Really, the cheese/charcuterie table is amazing.  Personal favorites on the meat side: buttermilk sirloin, the red-wine-something beef with onions on the side that idk the name of, the ribs, probably other things too...more on that below. Why this review is only 3 stars: I have a small appetite, so I took smaller cuts of meat each time it came around so I could try everything, and eat more of what I liked without wasting food. Unfortunately most of the meats came only once, while some came multiple times. The staff didn't notice that although most of my friends had finished eating, I was still waiting for more ... So they just skipped our table. When I requested a specific item, it never came, so I requested it again to another member of the staff. It still didn't come, and we even had the check already. Finally, I got a plate of meat, cut in the kitchen and kind of cold. I still don't know what it was called....

The restaurant is a Brazilian-steakhouse style, where the servers bring enormous slabs of steak or sausage or trays of duck and seafood and more to your table for the taking.  The meat is essentially all you can eat.  My personal favorite was the wagyu steak, and the duck was a close second.   However, prior to sitting for the main course, the harvest tables at the heart of the restaurant have numerous tantalizing appetizers, from charcuterie to kale and quinoa salads.  These appetizers are all you can eat as well, and all options were savory and delicious.  The desserts were exceptional.  Our table shared a variety from the dessert list, and while all were delectable, the bread pudding was superb.  The wine list provided several great options, and the cocktails were well-made. Because it was a work function, I cannot comment directly on the price.  However, this restaurant is virtually all you can eat of top notch quality food, so I'd imagine it's likely worth the price.   Bottom line, I'd highly recommend Zed451 and hope to have the chance to visit again.",0.9902,0.825,0.175,0.0,0.5206944444444445

We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. Honestly, for a Friday night, it didn't seem too busy, but there were a couple large groups. Because this is a Brazilian steakhouse, there are servers that bring out different cuts of meat. The meats were...disappointing to say the least. I've been to about 4 or 5 other Brazilian steakhouses, and it was nice that they offered duck and pork, but the beef meats were incredibly underwhelming. Their ""signature"" cut was...whatever. I honestly don't even remember what it was. The cuts that they served did not match what they listed online and by the way did I mention how SLOW IT WAS? Our main server who refilled our drinks and whatnot claimed that it was how they did things, but it was honestly just frustrating. We were so hungry and it took at least 15-20 minutes for us to get our first serving, even though we moved those stupid rock things. We saw all these servers walking around with meats, but they would skip our table. We had to ask our server to speed it up at least 3 times and we were still waiting about 10 minutes in between each server. We also kept getting the same cuts over and over again. We requested certain cuts, but didn't receive them for at least 30-45 minutes. Our server was nice, but she made my friends and boyfriend feel uncomfortable. She was kind of handsy/touchy-feely, which I didn't really mind, but my boyfriend definitely was getting annoyed that she kept touching him and not sending over more food. Overall, this place was not worth the price ($50/person) and the service was incredibly slow.

About 45 minutes into our meal after the salad bar, we moved our rocks from the tray (that's the signal to bring more food.)

The portions were tiny and for the money you're spending you would at least expect constant service to have a full plate. There were times where my family and I would wait 30 minutes until the chefs brought us a new sampling of meats. The chefs were all Irish teens here for summer break(we asked) it all seemed very unprofessional for the status of this restaurant. This may sound really silly but even the knives wouldn't cut the meat that they served us, for a place that serves a lot of meat it is a necessity to at least have a sharp knife that cuts.Overall very poor service and I do not recommend this spot.",-0.6822,0.854,0.061,0.085,0.5153451178451178

2015-09-20,2.0,"I'm going to start this off by saying I never review on yelp, so for me to write means a lot. My husband and I live in the area and we wanted a dining experience for our one year wedding anniversary so we made reservations at Zed451. We arrived and were sat in the middle of two huge groups back by a window, so right away the ambiance was diminished since we couldn't even hear each other talk. We were not blown away by the buffet style food, so we sat at our table with empty plates waiting for our meat to be served. 20 minutes after waiting for meat selections, the waiter came over to check on us and realized that he hadn't told us about the rock system that communicates to the meat providers that you're ready to be served. The meat selections were finally served and we weren't really loving anything since the meats had so many harsh spices and even the steak was charred on the outside and raw and chewy on the inside. However the salmon was ok and it was my favorite, so when a meat server asked if they could send over anything and I said the salmon, I was disappointed that it took 3 more servers including our dedicated waiter to ask if they could get me anything until cold salmon finally arrived at our table. After that the same meats kept coming to our table so we sampled 6 out of the 12 being served, but that was enough to know we were not impressed and done with this experience. When I asked our dedicated server for the check, his reaction was very rude acting offended by my question and stating, "" don't you want any dessert?"" Obviously I don't if I asked for the check. We paid and didn't even go to the rooftop for a night cap as planned. The wait staff was very attentive to serving water and the wine selection was ok, but a little overpriced compared to competitive steakhouses. I would say if you have a huge group and want quantity instead of quality this is a place to go for the deviled eggs and cheddar biscuits, but if you want great food I would look elsewhere.",0.3948,0.867,0.067,0.066,0.5895887982984757

I had been here about 4 years ago and everything back then was really great but this time, not so much.  I made reservations on OpenTable and we were seated right away when we arrived. We were told about the rules and how we would be served, then we went to the harvest tables to get started. The food was mediocre and the Duck Confit Hash Browns, basically only had potatoes left in it the entire time we were there. We placed the stone on the table, signifying that we wanted to try the sampling items. NO ONE noticed our table at all and we didn't get our first sampling until 20 minutes after we had sat down. The first person to notice us was super nice and friendly - always smiling and personable - kind of wish I knew his name. Then one of them went to the table next to us to serve them, looked back at our table and proceeded to walk away until I called him back. He claimed that he was making sure we had plates.....really? And this is the same guy who actually had made eye contact with me earlier but chose to not come by our table. The sirloin was delicious and so was the ham. Everything else was only OK.

2015-08-14,4.0,"A great Brazillian grill style restaurant. Rule #1: Pace yourself! Step 1: Harvest table- filled will salads, cheeses, meats, breads, fruits, etc... You will want to try everything at the harvest table. And you should, but remember, you still have 10+ meat preparations to eat! Step 2: Meat on Spits- employees will circulate around with giant meat sticks and will slice off pieces of it for you at your command! If you liked something a lot, just grab a meat carrier and let them know what you want more of and they will send that meat carrier your way. They will keep giving you meat until you are about to burst, you have been warned. This can easily turn into a wafer thin mint situation quickly. I've been here on 2 occasions, and each time the harvest table was a little different. I was very impressed with the salads, they are very unique and tasty. It is really easy to get carried away at the harvest table.  The meat preparations tended to be on the simpler side the highlight the flavor of the meat.

Anyway, when we were seated, several members of the waitstaff immediately filled our waters, took our drink orders and explained the process of a typical Brazilian steak house (how to get the guys walking around with swords of meat to serve you). We then started with our first course which was a buffet of very well prepared salads, charcuterie and fruits. All very good, the wild mushroom salad was the fan favorite. The meats were all really great. I loved the chicken waffle, that in itself will get me to come back, wow. The other meats on the menu were grilled sirloin, turkey with cranberry sauce, sausage with horseradish mustard, catfish and salmon benedicts. Unknowingly, I just wrote those in order from my favorite to least favorite (which still wasn't bad at all). The water guy quickly became my best friend. I go through waters really quickly, every time I turned back around, there he was filling my glass. I tried to tell him I could handle it myself, but he kindly insisted every time. Our hosts were also very helpful and polite. Service in itself gets five stars. Finally, big shout out to the complimentary shuttle driver who took us all the way home despite being a little further north of their typical route. Really appreciated the quick trip home to lapse into our food coma. Overall, great service, awesome food, excellent for large parties. Thanks guys!",0.9991,0.668,0.328,0.004,0.5481696428571429

The hostesses are uninterested as I walk in. When I make my way to the bar, the staff is in a meeting, getting prepared for the day. Um if you open at 4:30 shouldn't that happen at 4? So I sit there and the man, whom I guess is a chef in a white coat glances at me but no one pays attention to me while they conduct their meeting. I'm early and I don't really want to start drinking so soon so I just settle in and start answering texts and stuff. Because it's a rainy day, my friends are late. It's now 4:50. The meetings are over. I walk over to uninterested hostesses and ask 'you open at 4:30 right?' ""yes"" they say. ""well can I get service?"" H: ""from the bartender."" so I walk back, the bartender is cutting up his fruit and setting up his station. Um shouldn't this happen at 4? All the while I'm seeing staff show up ready to change for work. I get the bartenders attention and ask for a drink. OK, he says. ""Well do you have a drink menu, a wine menu?"" He fishes one out. ""Do you have a food menu?"" He fishes one out again. If Zed451 opens at 5, they should say so. My friends eventually show up as the place fills up, the staff is now attentive. I order ahi tuna tacos assuming the ahi tuna will be rare, it's fully cooked. There are so many places in the city of Chicago that want your businesses, I'd try there first. If you are willing to sacrifice a trendy atmosphere for friendly, attentive service Zed451 is for you. I'll only go back reluctantly if someone really wants to go.

The server also told me there is no longer shrimp offered. They actually didn't offer any seafood until I asked for it. They offered about five different types of meat, and then stopped coming over. After a little while the server asked if we were done eating. Really?!?! I asked about the seafood, and she sent over salmon, and that was it. Granted, we were full already, but this really wasn't the experience I had before where food was offered until ""I"" said no more. Also, they plated a slice of chocolate cake with the word ""Congratulations"" for us, and I thought it was complimentary.  However, it was actually $10 on my bill. See, I don't mind paying for it, but you should at least ask first. They are really cutting back, but with this type of service, it won't help the cause.

I've been to every steakhouse in the city/burbs including Texas de Brazil, Brazzaz, Chama, and Fogo. I was eager to try this place and we came in ready for a big meal. I was shocked at the lack of options at the so-called salad bar. Yet the worst part is how slow the meat handlers come by. It feels like waiting for a bus and God forbid you miss it, the next one isn't coming for 30 minutes.  If you plan on eating here just make sure you stop at McDonald's first and grab a few burgers to help you store calories for the long wait.

The brussel sprout salad and broccoli was quite good, but I would pass on several of the other options including the asian noodle salad and the BLT Panzenella salad. Cheese options weren't anything specifically special, but good. The meats were quite good, but typical of a Brazilian steak house at this price point. We were too full to get the desserts if that is any indication of the portions available and the fact that our entire party kept eating. The decor I would put as above average with a warm fire hearth and gorgeous wood beams running throughout.

I first discover Zed451 during my search for a venue for my office's holiday party a year and a half ago. Since then, I have frequent for their brunch, and also had opportunities to partake in wine and cheese tastings. The food is nothing short of amazing, and though it is a tad bit on the expensive side, my friends and family have enjoy their visits and left full and content. However, the service (the wait staff, host staff, valet, etc.) is what keeps me going back again and again. Everyone is so personable and welcoming. The host staff will remember you if you frequent often and will ask if you are celebrating a special occasion when you make your reservation. The wait staff are hilarious and will personally direct the food handlers to your table if you haven't sampled it yet.  The food handlers are just as hilarious and witty, and are super accommodating. One time, my friend and I wanted a plain Belgian waffle without the buffalo chicken strip on top; within five minutes, we had three FRESH, HOT waffles. Another time, one of the handlers gave his cranberry sauce container to the same friend because she loved it so much. For vegetarian entrees, they are willing to make a plate for you. You want more glaze on that ham? You got it. You want your steak to be more medium? You got it. Whatever you want (within reason), it is all yours here.  This year, I became engaged to my loving fiance and we celebrated with a brunch with friends. Our waitress during that visit gave us a lovely decorated plate of dessert for this occasion. I have never experienced such warmth from a restaurant before, and I will continue to patronize this establishment. Not entirely sure if it is within our wedding budget to have the ceremony/reception here, but if it is possible, please be sure I will have it here! I wish I could give this review 10 stars, because I honestly cannot find fault with their service or food. Keep doing what you're doing, Zed451 - you have found a fan :D!",0.9947,0.819,0.172,0.009,0.6022794389073458
2015-03-01,1.0,"I was insanely disappointed. The food was great, however the service was absurd and I've never felt more uncomfortable in a restaurant. We had a party of 12, which I understand is annoying for anyone working in the restaurant industry, and especially annoying because of people wanting to pay separate. However, I didn't expect us to be treated as if we were not worthy of their service. Prior to even ordering drinks we inquired about possibly grouping the check to one, make it easy on the wait staff but also to make it easy on us (the paying customer).  Byron was our main server and I could not believe the attitude he had when asking about the check and after everything we ordered. It was almost as if he was annoyed or had some pre conceived notion that we would not spend a lot of money (and yield a large tip), which I assure you was not the case.  I had a reservation to bring my parents back this upcoming weekend and immediately canceled that reservation. WILL NOT be going back.",0.6056,0.854,0.081,0.065,0.654621848739496
2015-03-01,5.0,"If I could give it more than 5 stars I would! I have 2 severe food allergies which makes eating out very nerve wrecking. From the minute I mentioned it to our server I was knew everything would be ok. He immediately got the chef, Nick, to come to our table and discuss my options ensuring I would be safe. He went over options and what was in the marinades, sauces, etc. He knew quite a bit about cross contamination and possible trouble points. He suggested a salad and and even brought me the bag of quinoa so that I could see it was free of my allergens! He prepared my meals for me and treated me like this was no big deal. I know its extremely difficult to pull a chef from the kitchen on a Saturday night to focus on one guest and the fact that he didn't act rushed or annoyed in the least bit was downright awesome. Our server was extremely professional and attentive and the chefs who brought my fiancee the meat were very nice too. Even the guy who cleared our plates gave great customer service. Needless to say I ate safely and for the first time leaving a restaurant since both allergies developed I was stuffed! Oh and the food was fantastic!",0.9708,0.792,0.152,0.055,0.5856060606060607
2015-03-01,4.0,"Great food and atmosphere. Came to this restaurant with family while I was visiting Chicago and it was a great experience for my first time at a steak house. The choice in salads was fantastic (and I'm not a big salad person) and all the meats (especially the steaks) were cooked to perfection. The only thing I didn't like was that when we first started to eat the meats, the gap in time between one piece of meat and until the next waiter brought their skewer of meat was somewhat long. You would finish eating one piece and then have to wait until the next waiter came along, but this could have been because they were cooking the meat. As the night went on, the waiters were coming up to our table more often. I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion, especially when meeting up with friends.",0.9432,0.876,0.114,0.01,0.5435897435897437
2015-02-26,5.0,"I should preface this by saying that I am not at all a chic restaurant person. I consider a restaurant ""fancy"" if it has complimentary bread and cloth napkins, so don't mind me if I seem enthusiastic over otherwise mundane things.   I wasn't too excited about coming here. I was under the impression that this was a (Brazilian) steakhouse, and I'm probably the only male on the planet whose attitude towards steak is that it's better than a bowl of Grape Nuts. I really don't care for steak.  We went in and were politely greeted and asked if we'd like to check out coats (for free). We were a bit early for our reservation so we told the hostess we'd grab a quick drink at the bar so we can be seated at our scheduled time, but she insisted that there was no rush for us to be seated and we can take our time at the bar. I didn't order one of their signature cocktails, but one of us tried their ""vodka old fashioned"" or some name like that. I tried a sip of it, and then several more when she went to the bathroom. The best way to describe the taste was Christmas in July. I highly recommend it.  When we were seated we were immediately greeted by a very friendly and informative server whose name I'm sorry to say I can't remember. He explained the process of the harvest tables and what to do when we were ready for the meat course. He advised us not to fill up on the harvest tables and, for the love of all that's holy, please listen to him.  The harvest tables (or ""posh buffet"" as I referred to them) had a wide selection of appetizers and regardless of how picky an eater you might be, you'll definitely find something you like. It was everything from an Asian soft noodle medley, to tortellini, to lentil soup. There was even an artisan cheese table.  The main courses that day were steak, Moroccan chicken and a glazed salmon. I wasn't too wild about the steak because, as I said, I'm not into that. However, the salmon was one of the best I've ever had and the chicken was like nothing I'd ever eaten before. The best way to explain the chicken is to compare it to a wet sponge. That's how soft and juicy it was. I don't know what the hell they did to make it that way, or maybe I've just been eating shit chicken my whole life, but that was very impressive. The biggest selling point for me was the service. Our server was very quick and spoke to us very cordially. In fact, the entire staff was extremely friendly, and not in the contrived ""I'm just going to call you sir a hundred times"" kind of way; it seemed more like I was at a friend's house than a restaurant. Same with the various servers who came around carving meat off of swords for us. Everyone just seemed genuinely happy to be there which means that the management takes good care of its employees or they're just really good at hiring friendly people. Either way, it's a very pleasant experience.  I most likely won't end up being a regular here, but I could see myself making future visits to this place.",0.9975,0.798,0.16,0.042,0.5380349650349651

2015-02-16,5.0,"A very upscale churrascaria. The atmosphere is quite inviting. The decor is modern that kept making me look around every corner. The fireplace in the middle of the harvest table area made me want to cuddle up with a blanket and a book. The harvest table did not have your typical ceasar or mixed green salads.  The had delicious unique salads, veggies, fruits, meats and cheeses in a variety of tasty flavors. I could have gotten full with just trying everything on the harvest table.  The variety of steak, chicken and seafood was on a grand scale. Everything was so tasty that no add'l seasonings was needed. our waiter and bus boys were very attentive keeping our table clean and our drinks full. The only downside I noticed was that the gauchos didn't cut large pieces of meat, we had to ask for several pieces at a time.

2015-02-14,1.0,This review is for the bar area only. I like to go there for a drink or bar food and they have lovely fire place and nice ambience. The food is good and so are the drinks. That being said the service was horrible the last two times we went there. Once we were completely ignored for 20 min and we left. The other time we had to chase the bartender to get a menu and to order. In both instances they were not busy so I find it hard to understand. That's why I gave them one star.,0.4297,0.795,0.111,0.094,0.5484848484848485
2015-02-13,5.0,"Lovely! My SO and I went for Restaurant Week. I had been to the restaurant before, but only as part of a private event that did not serve anything but wine, cheese, and charcuterie. So we decided to take advantage of the price cut to try the real food. And I must say we were NOT disappointed! First of all, the ""salad bar"" area is very upscale and offers an array of delicious items like a kale quinoa salad, roasted carrots, and pastas. They also have two soups available at any time, and the most delicious array of cheese and charcuterie I have ever seen and tasted. Their custom butters were amazing too (we realized that the black truffle butter was amazing when we put it on the sirloin, so I took a little swab of just butter back to my plate during the meat part of the meal). You can go back to the salad bar at any time. The waiter also brought us a little bread appetizer directly to our table. Next up was the meat portion of the meal. For restaurant week we only had the chicken, sirloin, and salmon, but they were all quite delicious. The salmon was probably my least favorite, but salmon is my least favorite fish anyway. The one piece of it that I got was a tad cold, but it was flavored nicely. The chicken was FABULOUS. Incredibly well-seasoned. It was a Moroccan chicken, and it kind of tasted like a yellow curry seasoning. My SO doesn't like curry, but he really liked the chicken. I probably got 4 or 5 pieces of it throughout the night and only one of them was on the drier side. The others were all cooked to perfection. The sirloin was FABULOUS. Also well-seasoned and very well cooked. It was definitely rare/medium-rare in most parts, but I like my steaks bloody so I was fine with that. If you like well-done steak then churrascarias are probably not for you anyway.  The service was also very good. People were constantly checking up on us (but not so much that we felt like we had no privacy). We were given two bottles of water to refill in case we needed to, but we never had to anyway since people were always filling them for us. Our waiter was very nice and easy to talk to. He was also very personable and gave a great wine recommendation. All in all, a great place. The ambiance is fabulous, the food is delicious, and the service is superb. I definitely want to go back, if only for their drinks because their Fiery Orchard Cider is TO DIE FOR. Thanks Zed! Note: The one downside was the price (normally, not during restaurant week). While $50 per person is pretty standard for most churrascarias, it's definitely not a place you can frequent. I wish they had more options (like maybe to only eat their harvest foods, or to only get certain meats, or to get a cheaper price for lunch) so that I could eat here more often.",0.999,0.714,0.235,0.051,0.6395741113346746

We had a 6:30 reservation so the restaurant wasnt very crowded.  Valet held the door open for me upon arrival and hostess was very nice, telling me to watch my step due to a slight dip in the floor.  I appreciate that as I am a total klutz.

2015-02-10,4.0,"Came here during Chicago restaurant week with my roommate and Lydia R with VERY high expectations and this place didn't disappoint.    This is a very upscale place, they take your coats right when you walk in.  I would highly recommend making a reservation to ensure you get a table.  There are two areas of the restaurant;  to the right there was a bar area with a large TV screen where they had a basketball game on and to the left was the main dining area where we were seated.  I imagine this would be a great place to come with co-workers for drinks as well as a fancy dinner since they have that bar area. Ok so let's get to the dining experience.  We each got a different cocktail; I tried the hazelnut old-fashioned and it was fantastic.  It was strong, but not overpowering.  My roommate got the cider, and that seemed like the best bang for the buck since it took her FOREVER to finish just one drink.   For restaurant week there is what I can best describe as an ""appetizer bar"" complete with different salads, soups (the potato soup was fabulous), breads, and other bite-size appetizers.  That was unlimited and honestly you could easily just get full from that.   Then comes the meats; for the typical $49 option, you get to try an unlimited amount of 12 different meats.  For restaurant week for $33 we got to try 3 types (salmon, chicken, and sirloin) and that was perfect for us.  I'm not a huge fish person, but the salmon wasn't bad.  It had a BBQ type sauce on it which was very tasty.  I thought the chicken was ok, a little dry for my taste.  However, by far the best of the meats was the sirloin.  It was perfectly cooked, tender, and melted in your mouth.  We actually stayed a little afterwards to have another serving of the sirloin.  All in all, great experience.  Will definitely be back to try out the rooftop in the summertime.",0.9968,0.804,0.189,0.007,0.5764308943089431

2015-02-08,5.0,"A staff member opened the front doors for us (nice b/c on the way out they were a little hard to push) Hostess not particularly friendly. Restaurant wasn't crowded (it was 5pm on a Sat) but the 3 of them were standing there as if not knowing what to do... Luckily the coat check guy was super friendly (coat check = free) and by the time we turned around he said ""[name] will show you to your table."" Opted for ""the Zed Experience"" and not Restaurant Week, although the latter included dessert. $50 is the same price as all the other Brazilian steakhouses around. I think it's neat that they don't have just plain veges and salad bar like the others-- although I did miss the giant asparagus that Fogo de Chao has. Their 'cheese popper' things are a little sweet and come with a dipping sauce. You can also buy sides- mashed potatoes, etc  for $6 each. Cocktails were yummy-- $12 ea. I got a juice- OJ is freshly squeezed- and it was $5. Small glass tho. Service was great!! In OpenTable I asked for a quiet table. The waitress asked proactively if it was ok for us! And the water filler guy was quick to refill (and they leave a pitcher on the table). The meat guys were really friendly. I was impressed with everyone 'on the floor'. The sides a varied and lots of fun imho. Dal lentils, kale salad, green apple salad, shitake mushroom and green beans... Meats were good-- 3 diff't kinds of steak (I liked the ranch one, hubby liked the wagu), catfish, ahi tuna, salmon, sausage (yumm), chicken (was a little sweet), and this crispy pork thing was really good. Lady at the next table said on the last one ""it's as if Chinese food and bacon had a baby."" There was some ""chef's table"" seating (bar top near the meat section)-- idk what that was about (lots of fresh meat?) but people seemed happy there. Bathrooms felt a little dirty, and were upstairs.  One note, 2 years ago I had an event here. They had a big minimum order, and we had many people not show up. So we paid like $1500 for $500 of food. I asked them for a few meats to go, to bring to my hubby. They were soooooo resistant. I asked for a manager. $1000 for $15 of steak. Seriously. So, unless you are a huge party (20+) you may just want to book on Open Table or something... the restaurant is surprisingly big, although it doesn't feel that way.",0.9959,0.794,0.159,0.047,0.5135811467444121

2015-02-06,1.0,"I'm really sad to make this update, but my experience here tonight was nothing short of disastrous.  I've been to Zed 451 for brunch and after work cocktails, and was excited to see them participating in Restaurant Week to try out their dinner.  The service here was extremely disappointing. The hostess was very friendly and we were seated promptly, but our waitress was clearly not pleased that we were partaking in the lower priced RW menu, and this was reflected in every interaction we had. She refilled our water glasses, but never offered us an option to order a second drink (we both would have absolutely ordered a 2nd drink!). If we were finished with a plate, she didn't come by to take it until I moved it precariously close to the edge of the table. Our reservation was at 7:45, so it was relatively busy, but there were at least 4 empty tables in our section, so it was not a function of busyness.  The restaurant week menu included three meat options: one beef, chicken, and salmon. All three options were very good, if you could get any! We had an extremely difficult time getting anyone to come over to serve us. As in, we would have someone come by, offer us something, and wait 10 minutes or more for someone else to come by. We were seated behind a large party, and some of the patrons were enjoying the full menu, and they had very attentive service. At one point, they brought a tray of salmon around (on both menus), offered multiple slices to each person at that table to empty the tray, and then walked away. The manager was making the rounds and checked in with the table, noticed me watching her, and came over to our table. I was honest with her about the inattentive service and she said she would make sure people came to our table. Directly after the manager came over, our waitress came to our table and offered us a ""taste of one of the chef's specials"", which we declined. It seemed like she was offering to comp one additional type of meat based on the service and our chat with the manager. I was confused about it, so I pressed her on the issue, and she clarified that she was allowing us to upgrade to the full menu if we wanted to pay full price. This was not transparent, and I would have been extremely upset if I agreed and was charged without disclosure.  There was also a very awkward scene at the table next us. Our waitress clearly noticed some unauthorized sharing going, so the manager came back to inform someone that it was noticed she tried something from someone else's plate and that she would now be charged for it. The woman was upset and pointed out that it was a bit of sauce (which comes standard at most Brazilian steakhouses), but the manager just informed her she would be charged and left. Most places will not allow tables to split between menus for exactly this reason, and they clearly shouldn't as it creates awkward problems for that table and surrounding tables.  The manager also did not take the time to check back in at our table to see if things had improved (they hadn't). The service highlight of the meal was when our waitress got me a dessert without strawberries (I'm allergic), which topped the cheesecake that came with our meal. I was expecting plain cheesecake, but she went to the trouble of adding some nuts and chocolate shavings, which was very unexpected and nice. Overall, this experience was disappointing and will likely mean I don't return to the restaurant in the future, even though the ambiance and decor are fantastic and the food is good. The management did not handle the issues well and I do not recommend they participate in restaurant week in the future if they can't handle the volume. If your business model involves serving less food and providing sub-par service to certain customers, you will not be a restaurant I continue to patronize.",0.945,0.812,0.099,0.089,0.5376642996379838

What made matters worse was that we asked for several varieties of meat to return, and it took over 15 minutes before we saw them again. I know this is probably a common knock against places like Zed451 or Fogo de Chao, but it seemed like Zed451 just did not have this aspect of their game down, which is a shame because this is otherwise a 5 star restaurant.

2015-01-03,2.0,Went here for a recent birthday party party of 20. Food was outstanding but service was hirrible.  Our waiter seemed like he was upset I bothered the whole night and even forgot my drink twice. We had brought a birthday cake and somehow he forgot to serve our half of the table so we ended up cake less and I happened to take offense to the poor effort. I mentioned to the waiter that we still needed cake and not even a sorry or effort was made to bring any.  One of the members in our group had a gift card valued at $100 and they declined to use it without reason.  I am extremely disappointed in zed and their service!!! They do offer a complimentary shuttle service around the area and that is the only reason I gave it the extra star.  There are plenty of restaurants like this in Chicago with much better service and a welcoming environment.

I contacted the hostess to let them know the situation and he had to go searching for the server. Finally, our server came and told us how the restaurant works. I was very annoyed by this time. I have no idea why it took about 25 mins for our server to come to our table. Then, he told us to go check out the Harvest Table and when we're ready, placed the rocks on the table. The chefs took a while to come to our table and serve us food. It was a very slow process.  Food: 4/5 The chef served us UNCOOKED CHICKEN!!! After eating a piece of chicken, we noticed there was a raw section in the chicken and immediately the host apologized for the inconveniences and brought us some new chicken. The chicken wasn't even that tasty to begin with. It was shocking to know that a place like this would served uncooked chicken. Be careful with your food and cut it up before you eat it!  Beside the chicken, everything else was amazing! This place is definitely known for their meats! The steak definitely make up the bad services and the uncooked chicken here. They had the most delicious Kobe beef, which is so tender and juicy! The buttermilk sirloin was also one of best tasty dish ever. Another favorite was the ribeye steak with caramelized onions. Don't get the salmon, it tasted very fishy.   Environment: 5/5 The decor is beautiful. The place is dark, but very intimate. The design of the place is very beautiful.

The feel of the restaurant is warm & welcoming, which is a perfect segue into their Harvest Table.   Harvest Table in a word?  Fabulous!  I could have just grazed here all night and skipped the rest of the meal.  Adored the figs & giardiniera.  Of the salads, the kale and beet were two of my favs.  The salami selections were unique and incredibly tasty... nicely complemented by the assortment of cheeses and parmesan crisps.   The Hazelnut-Infused, Spiced Cranberry Old Fashioned was my drink of choice for the evening.  I'm a bit of a cocktail snob and I must say, very nicely done, Zed451!  There are definitely a few more of those delightful drinks in my future.  We also had Sangria at the table and I don't know what they do to the green apples they serve on a skewer to accompany the sangria, but they were delish! The service really made the experience enjoyable.  We've been to a couple of other restaurants with similar table service (i.e., Brazilian steak houses) and this team definitely stood out.  As they brought the 'chef selections' around, they would engage the group, talk about their favorites, explain what we might like about the dish...you get the picture.  The pastry chef was one of the team bringing around the goodness and he did a great job of prepping us for the dessert course.  If only we didn't have other plans for dessert - the choices sounded amazing & definitely something for us to look forward to next time.   There were so many great selections, but my top picks were the Ahi Tuna (loved the grilled pineapple salsa!), the Pork Belly (delightfully crispy, but the kimchi is what knocked this out of the park!) and the sausage.  I usually don't take up retail space with sausage when dining at one of these experiences, but the server convinced me otherwise and I was not disappointed! At the end of the night, Zed 451 extended their passenger van to get most of our group home.  This was a fabulous touch, demonstration of their fabulous customer service and a great way to end the experience.   You've won us over...

Zed's wagyu is absolutely amazing - it manages to be tender and deeply flavorful at the same time. It is the best beef I have had at a steakhouse like this. But some of the other beef cuts are good not great. At  Fago, the picanha (top sirloin) was the best cut, so if you prefer sirloin.. Fago had a wider range of good second place beef cuts and better sauces.  On every other basis, Zed wins hands down. The salad buffet is far superior, especially the smoked meats. (Don't waste time on the soup or cheese). Fago's buffet is substandard. Zed's cheese biscuits are addicting.Also, they don't just have meat offerings - the grilled salmon was truly fantastic. I thought they put too much sauce on the tuna, but others loved it. The chicken is overcooked - don't eat poultry at any Brazilian steakhouse!   I also prefer the ambiance at Zed, it is a bit better lit. And the desserts were incredible. The sangria and drinks are great at both.

2014-11-17,4.0,"I must admit that I had the wrong impression about places like Zed451.  The idea of a Brazilian Steakhouse was never appealing since I never wanted to eat all the meat I could eat.  It all seemed so barbaric and who likes the meat sweats anyways?  Sure I heard about the salad bars that go on for miles, but who goes to a place for the salad bar? Well things could not have been further from my original opinion.  Zed451 was a delightful meal, with civilized portions of meat.  The salad bar does go on and on, but it was less Sizzler, more steakhouse sides.  There was a whole charcuterie and cheese section that I could have feasted on for hours, but I held back and moved on to their many vegetable salads.  These are sophisticated sides, like grilled pineapple and caesar brussel sprouts.  I liked everything that made it onto my plate.   Next came the men with their skewers and knives.  However each of them gave you two bites at the most, so you never felt overwhelmed or stuffed.  There were many different offerings, but the wagyu beef and salmon stood out the most.  The staff was super friendly and helpful. They managed our large group well.   We shared desserts and I got to try a bite of the Elvis (good but too rich after all of that food), the panna cotta (light and wonderful, but did not care for the berries) and the bread pudding (heavenly).  I would have skipped dessert had it not been on the company dime.  I doubt I will get to go back but at least I know they have forever changed my opinion about this kind of restaurant.",0.9943,0.777,0.191,0.032,0.5776135741652982

Once we sat down I can honestly say we sat for about 15 minutes without a single person approaching the table. I'm not sure if they were short staffed because we noticed the manager's running food out which I don't see too often but maybe that's how they do it there.

She informed us our server would be with us shortly and she greeted us about 5 minutes later.  I forgot the server's name but she was extremely attentive and informative.

We were greeted by the receptionist and seated immediately. I can say the interior design was though a little bit dark, gorgeous. Then this happened... We waited 10 minutes for our waiter to come and greet us. He was middle-aged. He looked bored and uninterested with our group which irritated me instantly. He was speaking in low voice which half of us couldn't make out what he was talking about. We went to the salad area which was great. I love the mushrooms, apple salad and the red bell pepper soup. I heard the waiter complained that nobody ordered a drink in our group. So there are stones on the table and supposedly, if one is ready for the meats then you can put a stone near your plate. (Personally, it was a stupid idea. The place was dark to see small black stones near our plates.) We waited for about 5 minutes to be served with a small sampling of ahi tuna. Then another 5 minutes for the next meat/fish. It was so annoying especially when one is hungry! This went on for 30 minutes until we got bombarded with every chef slicing meats on our table. It seemed like they didn't have organization with their chefs. One moment nobody's coming to the table, and then next moment, there were 3 meat servers on table. The waiter asked the birthday celebrant if we had brought a cake. She politely said no. He asked her what flavor of cake she wanted and she replied butterscotch. The bill came and what we thought was a ""complimentary birthday cake"" was charged to our bill. We brushed it off and didn't complain. We waited AGAIN for 15 minutes for the waiter to pick up our credit cards. I finally had it and walked to the receptionist and handed them the bill. They were ever so nice and apologetic but the damage had been done. We had time to go up to the rooftop bar. We were treated the same way by rude bartenders. Tsk, tsk. Food was good. The meats had sauce or salsa to go along with which I enjoyed. Will we come back here again? We don't think so. Although we enjoyed the food and the ambiance, we are ""traumatized"" by the lackluster service. For the price, we expected better service than what we had. The whole experience really fired me up.

When I called, the manager sounded irritated that I even pointed it out and finally after being put on hold several times, admitted that his server 'accidentally' added the total amount of the bill as a tip.

This is my first unlimited steakhouse where they bring you the meat out, so I can't really compare, but my experience here is fantastic. There are different steaks, pork belly, and even salmon. My favorite meats were the wagyu beef, the hangar steak, and the sirloin. The salmon was also particularly juicy and tender.  The atmosphere and the decor of this place is also amazing. The service is also pretty great. Our waiter was really helpful in introducing the restaurant, and every server of the meat was knowledgeable about what they are serving.",0.9901,0.768,0.232,0.0,0.6401041666666666
2014-10-06,2.0,"From the menu and the reviews, this place looked phenomenal.  I took one of my best friends here for a celebratory dinner and I was thinking of this restaurant sort of as a fancy brazilian steak house, in the sense that they bring around fancy meats and then would have a fancy salad bar and cheeses.  Well, everything was okay. Not great. Nothing really stood out as being amazing, and if it were only half as expensive, that would be fine. For the price, though, it really was below my expectations.  Also, the service was really weird and awkward. Our hostess alternately made me feel unwelcome and then later, like she was trying really really hard, all while not being good at her job. She took forever to bring us water and when she asked us if we would like to try any meats (or if there were any we hadn't tried yet), they never materialized. At least 20 minutes passed, and she asked again, and we told her we were still waiting on one more. I doubt that would have done anything but by that point, one of the superb chefs walking around had asked us and he made sure to bring it out himself.  I don't know if this can be helped, but one of the chefs walking around with meat kept awkwardly inviting us out to give us a ride in a pedicab or something he drives. That was awkward.  To sum it all up--  Food: okay Service: bad/weird (with some exceptions)",0.9459,0.829,0.116,0.056,0.5894675925925926

I usually don't like sangria because I don't like wine but the sangria here was actually pretty good and you get a good amount in the pitcher.

2014-08-27,4.0,This is only a review for their rooftop bar as I have yet to eat there (though I want to). I would definitely recommend getting to the rooftop around 10/10:30pm as they close the line once they hit capacity. They hit capacity a few times by 11pm even though there were plenty of tables/seats open. I definitely get it as a large part of the crowd just stands. Thankfully the wait was not long as people tend to head out throughout the night. The rooftop does close at midnight.  I was able to get one of the corner tables that had a nice backdrop of the Chicago skyline. Seating is first come first serve so it's another reason to come early. Drinks were very good and affordable (esp for River North). Would highly recommend the Bourbon Lemonade as it packs a punch and hides the alcohol well. By far my favorite drink there. Service was okay as it was crowded so it's probably for the best to order a drink each time you see the server.

2014-08-25,1.0,Over the weekend I dropped off some flowers that were left from another event  the night before to help a dear friend of mine who is also an event planner since she fractured her foot and could't do it for her daughter's christening.  Upon my arrival the manager kicked one of my boxes full of fresh centerpieces across the floor then complained about water everywhere. In the interest of keeping peace I set my tables up and grabbed my now sopping wet boxes to take them out to my truck when the same manager began terrorizing me and ultimately left the restaurant to come out to my truck and pick a fight with me like a 12 year old.  Never in my 30 years of event planning have I ever experienced this and I've produced events from Australia to Istanbul. Fortunately this was a friends event and not one of my client's events.  All event vendors from setup crews  to the talent work way to hard to be treated with so much disregard. Had it not happened to me personally I would never have believed it. I would advise any one who reads this to kindly address this issue with your event professional at Zed 451. Having your event professionals mistreated is not an efficient way to successfully execute your event.  To the owners of Zed451: Having managers that pick fights with vendors coming in and out of your establishment not only puts your employees at risk but it also endangers the welfare of your customers.

There are some very unique combinations that I would describe in a way that yelp would be proud, but I honestly don't remember. There were so many! The cheese/meat area was limited, but also offered unique selections. The soups...well I honestly didn't have them cause I was saving room. Meats (ribeye, wagyu, chicken, salmon, crab cakes, pork belly, etc) are all served table side. Let's me put in a disclaimer: chicken is a waste of time in a world of beef! The wagyu and ribeye were my favorite. Hands down! Just tell your waiter ""send over the wagyu and ribeye!"" That way, you won't be too full if they come around the end.

We made a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night and when we arrived, we were some of the first people in the restaurant.  Our service was great throughout the whole evening!

Some advice from our waitress- don't get too full on the harvest table (it will be hard considering how delish everything is)! Together in my group, we sampled most of what they had to offer at the harvest table and everything was great! The charcuterie was phenomenal and the roasted vegetables were spectacular. Now on to the main event.... THE MEATS. I literally sampled everything they came around with, and there was nothing that disappointed. Every cut of steak was tender and juicy, and the additions went together with them perfectly. The hanger steak is a must-have. Every time. With the chimichurri sauce..... HEAVENLY. The pork sausage was sooo tasty. If you like a little bit of spice, then this is for you. The Moroccan chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I'm a seafood person, and the salmon was one of the most well-cooked pieces of fish I've ever had. The blackened catfish was also really really great! Crab cakes were nice and tender, just bursting with flavor!! This was also the first time I tried venison and duck breast, and it won't be the last! Finally, the pork belly  was so tender it melted in your mouth. It's like bacon, but has a bit less of a salty flavor to me. It's really nice how they offer small portions of everything; makes sampling quite easy! For dessert, we ordered their spin on the banana cream pie. It was so nice! It came with a special happy birthday message and a birthday candle! It didn't have a traditional crust, which I liked, but instead came as a a mousse-like banana filling and a crunchy coated (almost the texture of cornflakes, not sure exactly what it was, but it was delicious).  It was topped of with caramelized bananas and accompanied with milk chocolate-Guinness ice cream!

It is a Brazilian steakhouse (the only one I've ever been to, actually).  I just have a few specific things to mention: 1)  Take it easy on the salad bar (aka harvest tables).  While it's truly magnificent, you must save room for the meats. 2)  THE MEATS.  My favorite is the buttermilk sirloin.  Try as many as you can... maybe start with small pieces or skip ones you're truly not interested in, so you can have room for more of your favorites.  The pork belly is another favorite of mine, though lots of my co-workers loved the rump roast. 3)  The service here is top-notch.  If you have questions, ask! My co-worker asked for her meat to be well done, They even have a shuttle available!  We usually have it pick our group up, and then we walk back to our hotel as to not feel so guilty about the food we took in. 4) Come hungry!  Get your money's worth and enjoy every food option you can fit in your belly.  Also, feel feel to take a breather if need be.  Make some more space in your stomach when it gets full. 5) Wear stretch pants.",0.9946,0.753,0.213,0.035,0.53

2014-07-26,1.0,"this review is for the restaurant itself, not the rooftop bar (which is quite nice). my ""experience"" at zed451 can only be described as comical. their model is one where you pay a set price ($55) for a buffet of salads and meat servings. the quality of the food was utterly mediocre, and the meat servings' delivery just hilarious.  some of the salads (arugula strawberry) was clearly not fresh -- the type you get at a cheap bad chinese takeout place, not an upscale restaurant. the soups were boring and tasted like a mouse committed suicide by drowning her sorry self in the soup pot. but the ""highlight"" was the meat servings, or rather how they were delivered. the idea is neat enough: an array of waiters with different meat choices pass by your table and cut you a slab of that animal protein. you have a stone on the table which you can place in the plate which tells the waiter that you've had enough, and they shouldn't  disturb you. the waiters blissfully ignored the stone signals and interrupted my conversation with my date every few minutes, rattling off the same story about a particular meat selection -- then looking confused at the stone, and trying to remember what it means... LOL.  if you want expensive culinary circus, with untrained clowns (waiters) and lazy acrobats (chefs) -- this is your place.",-0.4487,0.82,0.08,0.1,0.6420454545454545
2014-07-25,5.0,This is my absolute favorite Brazilian buffet. They are far better than others. They also have is the stop fire on the second floor which is completely designed in wood. Long log benches and flaming torches make for really nice ambience in the evening after an enjoyable dinner. You'll spend approximately 75 dollars per person here with drinks. However its difficult to serve over 30 different kinds of marinated meats. That's if you have room for it after their awesome salad bar!

2014-07-22,5.0,"Our wedding was already a couple months ago, but family and friends' compliments are still rolling in about how much they loved our brunch wedding reception at ZED451.  With the help of their friendly event planners (shout out to Sammy!) our whole day was amazing.  Sammy helped design the perfect late morning/early afternoon brunch wedding reception that included a ""cocktail hour"" with some fantastic, light passes appetizers, mimosas and Bloody Marys (or coffee, or soft drinks if they wished) to entertain guests after our ceremony while we went to take photos for a bit, followed by an AMAZING brunch. Seriously, when we started our reception venue search, food was the most important factor for us and after visiting ZED451, we knew it was THE place for us and hosting a brunch reception was going to be a super affordable option for us to make it all possible.  Having a brunch reception is a little bit off the beaten path, so guests weren't sure what to expect and we were happy to surprise them all even more with all of the wonderful food. Besides ""best wedding food ever"" a lot of people have let us know that we have ruined bacon for them at any other restaurant ever. Bacon will never be the same for them anywhere else. Trust me, their bacon is amazing. Guests were able to eat, drink and mingle for the afternoon in ZED's very pretty, and private event space. Their lovely Fireside room and Mezzanine were the perfect size for our 65 or so guests. The spaces are warm and modern--definitely not a boring banquet hall set up or backroom stuck away in a hall. And since it was such a gorgeous spring day, some of the guests popped out to their very cool rooftop bar to enjoy some of the sunshine.  And the service is INCREDIBLE. They have an entire team of servers for food, drinks, whatever you need. The meat servers were always around to offer guests plenty of choices and guests' glasses were never empty with their beverage of choice. Again, all of our guests were incredibly impressed and so many of them are still raving about it. The icing on the cake--ZED451 has a complimentary shuttle that was able to drive some of our older and less-mobile guests from our ceremony site to the reception. Then the shuttle even swung back to take the bridal party out to the Wells Street Bridge for some photos.  And, speaking of CAKE, ZED451 also has an amazing in-house pastry team that will create amazing desserts and also wedding cakes.  Overall, I can't recommend ZED enough. We were able to host such an incredible and AFFORDABLE day with great food and service, spending time with all of our favorite people. It was just the best.

I will say that the ""special"" steak option is great (and my boyfriend loved the pork belly) but that's about it. I feel like I payed $150 for a few slices of mediocre meat and lack luster sides. The sliced meat (I literally gagged when I tasted one of them )and cheese side options were dried out. The pastas were a bit tasteless and the meat option offered by the servers were brought to the table far and in between.... One really huge issue I had with this experience is the fact that the servers do not ask how you would like your cut of meat.... We either ended up with raw meat or cold ends....

The kale salad, grilled pineapple, and cheeses were my favs there. The mango sangria was tasty too. Only missed the cheese rolls that I usually find at these places. They also didn't have lamb on the menu at this time. The desserts were awesome too. Really liked the bread pudding. Good flavor and portion size.  While I liked the ambiance, we were by the fire pit and without ac directly overhead it got a bit warm. Maybe some fans overhead?

They were extremely attentive and realized right away (without me even telling them) that I do not eat beef or pork, no exceptions. I am 98 percent vegetarian so I will eat chicken and fish once in a blue moon, which was tonight. Due to this observation, they started bringing more chicken and fish to please my needs which I thought was thoughtful and demonstrated their excellence service.

To be fair, they did comp a meal which was appreciated.  Ultimately though, we felt everyone around us was having a completely different (better) experience than ours.  They had plates of food brought to them that we never had mentioned as options and had servers asking them for favorites to bring.  Too many other good places to return here again.

No problem with that though because we were able to have a wine flight at the bar and order one of those fun fruity mango drinks. When we got to our table, our server explained everything to us since we've never been there before. He started us out with some cheesy bread that came in what i thnk was a cast iron muffin pan. It's mini so you don't get a ton like Mom's Sunday breakfast. Loved the bread that I probably ate too much before actually eating dinner.  They offered a fresh salad bar and some soups to try but the best part was the meat and fish they serve throughout. We had a table near the kitchen which was surprisingly quiet but lucky for us, we were the first table out of the kitchen so everything we were served was still piping hot. I like trying all the different kinds of meat like the duck, chicken and steak but what's nice is they also offer you fish if you want something a bit lighter.

I remember getting so fully and not wanting to sit around until I got hungry again. As my appetite and appreciation for food has grown, I would say this was a much better experience. With the deal we had the option to a few meats and all of the salad bar items. The salad bar is great and many options but don't fill up! There were some meat options I wish we tried but I think this experience was enough for me. I wasn't blown away that I'd come again.

I have been to Zed countless times for events, cocktails on the beautiful roof, for brunch, and most recently dinner. Zed451 is a Brazilian steakhouse. For the life of me I don't know why I took my vegetarian friend there for brunch to watch him eat $29.00 worth of oatmeal. Although he did say it was good. With that said if you are a carnivore this is definitely the place for you. I most recently went for a wine tasting my friend won. We sampled a few wines with cheeses and meats. It was a nice surprise when the chef came out to explain the pairing selections.  After the wine tasting we proceeded to have dinner there. For $50.00 it's set up all you can eat style. For those who haven't been to a Brazilian restaurant basically the waiters come around with meat and you can decide which meat you want to try. They also have a buffet selection you can choose from, which included tasty salads, soups, and cheeses. Although we were stuff we still craved a little something sweet and ordered the Butterscotch Bread Pudding. OMG!!!! We still talk about it till this day. It was delicious and big enough for three people to share. My favorite part was the giant marsh mellow on top. A little tidbit that some people don't know about Zed is you can get a free ride to where you're going next in the restaurant van free of charge (of course you should still tip). I had the driver take me home, which wasn't far, but after that meal it was nice to save a few bucks. Zed451 is a must during the winter or summer.

All of our guests were so happy with the food and could not stop commenting on the impeccable service.  The event coordinators were so easy to work with!

To be honest - it was one of the few places we could secure a reservation for a reasonable time on OpenTable. The bar area was pretty dead - and it's a cool bar area.  So I'd say the owner needs to get a new management team - and spend some money on rebranding and PR and make a place to go again. The food is OK for what it is - salad bar was a nice variety and acceptably fresh and fun.  The meat was a little salty and cheap meat tends to be...but nothing bad.

Its about $30 a person which isn't bad considering the selection and amount of food that you receive.

They want you to fill up on a sub-par salad bar then when we were waiting for the meat to come around they were coming to every table but ours. When they did come they shaved off tiny morsels of meat. It was dry and disgusting. And they seem to really push pork which is the cheapest to prepare. Over all this place is a rip off. Your mainly paying for the salad bar. I probably ate two ounces of meat. And this is supposed to be a brazillian steakhouse specializing in meat? It was a joke.

Came with my very handsome date :)  to celebrate Valentine's day and I must say this is possibly my favorite steak house ever now, and Fogo was at the top until now.  I absolutely LOVE the decor it fit the night's theme, it was beautiful and romantic just perfect we were seated promptly at our arrival in a nice cozy corner away from the rest of the table so it was nice and intimate.   Our waiter came quickly and presented us with the tiniest chip that was soo delicious and had a horseradish garnish on top of it.   Before out dinner coma commenced we ordered some drinks and MY OH MY OH MY were they strong just how we like em!!   NOW Let's get to the salad bar I absolutely love the selection choices they had. I topped my plate with this crazy good spicy Thai apple  with pecans omg it was amazing it was lightly glazed too I wish I can remember everything in it.   Also tried their potato salad and we both enjoyed it a lot really good and creamy.    We made a pit stop at the Artisan Cheeses table and I really loved the this smoked sharp cheddar cheese they had amazing.  AND of course we made a stop at their soup station and enjoyed the Philly cheese steak soup TOOO DIE FOR!!    At this point we KNEW that we were in love with this place.  Once the meats started coming it was over!! I absolutely LOVED their Hanger Steak and chimichuri sauce  they serve on top of it.  And their Fire Grilled Rib eye was amazing as well served with red wine caramelized onions.  There was nothing we didn't try! And everything was amazing!! It was our first time Venison and man on man I never knew deer could taste so good!!! It was cooked perfectly as well.  I was also a fan of the Moroccan chicken and the Amaretto Pistachio Duck breast.   The salmon was also great. OHH and let's not forget about the amazing crab cakes AND the amazing biscuits they bring that are so cute and little but pack a great big bite of flavor.  BUT I MUST say that my favorite that I request seconds of was the Linguisa pork sausage!!1 OHHHH MY GOD I was in heaven it was served with a horseradish sauce and it was possibly the best sausage I have eve ate.   It had a really nice KICK to it and I mean KICK but it was great!!  He was also a BIG fan of it too.   We also order some sides for the table  that were all phenomenal!! ; the Gouda cheese top mashed potatoes, creamy spinach and a wild style corn of some sort I swear I've never tasted anything better!.    What I truly enjoyed most about this place was that for every cut of meat that was offered they paired it with some type of sauce that complimented it perfectly. Some of the cooks even gave suggestions to what it would go great with at the salad bar.    Overall our experience was amazing and the meats were always coming around. Everyone was friendly and our waiter ensured our drinks were topped of.  I must say we were def in a food coma by the time we were done and didn't get a chance to indulge in dessert but IT will def not be our last time here!!!",0.9992,0.732,0.244,0.024,0.6644900497512437

I would pick fogo de chao over this. I still had a good time regardless.,0.9108,0.842,0.143,0.015,0.5428571428571429
2014-02-16,2.0,"Booked for a Valentine's Day with another couple and our table was ready before the other couple arrived so we spent time in the bar, which was very swanky and service was good - she even offered to change my drink when I said it was too strong but we just added more mix instead. The reason I gave the low-to-fair rating was because the experience is to be able to eat all kinds of meats - we didn't even get two of the items we wanted until our server went to the kitchen and actually retrieved a plate of the meats. The carvers almost never stopped by; we had to request several items (a new knife, some more bread, etc.) several times from several people; disappointingly, the meats that did come to us were lukewarm at best.  The server was attentive for the most part, but it was just difficult to enjoy the experience for everything else occurring around her. I would be willing to try it again, but would be fine never going back too. And that's sad to me because I loved the ambiance and what foods that were warm were tasty. The Harvest Table is an A+. Maybe in the summer I can try out the rooftop.",0.9347,0.831,0.12,0.049,0.47453379953379954
2014-02-15,5.0,I really enjoyed our dinner at Zed451. Even though it was Valentine's Day it was not over crowded like many restaurants tend to be. Our waitress knew the menu well and made excellent recommendations. I enjoyed the décor and the feel of the place. They had modern music playing.  The Salad Area. So many choices! I really enjoyed the sautéed shitake mushrooms and the guacamole deviled eggs. I kept going back for more!  The Main Event: None of the meat choices disappointed! My favorites were the catfish and the pork belly. I loved that everything came out piping hot. I also thought that all the sauces they had to go with the meat pair perfectly. I ate until my poor dress was going to pop a seam!  This was a great dining experience for me! I would recommend this place to any of my friends!,0.9833,0.693,0.236,0.072,0.6239583333333333

2014-02-11,3.0,"My best friend and I decided to try this place for Restaurant Week because the buttermilk sirloin sounded too good to past up, what we didn't realize was Zed451 is a Brazilian Steakhouse, which ended up being a nice surprise! However, I'm very skeptical of Brazilian Steakhouses, I've been to a few and not all of them impressed me for the price, so being restaurant week the price of $33 wasn't too shabby.  We were seated next to window which had a cold draft throughout our entire meal so it made it a bit unpleasant. The service was pretty general, it didn't stand out in any way but it got the job done. We got three options of the char grilled buttermilk sirloin, Moroccan chicken, and forae island salmon along with the harvest tables: soups, charcuterie table, artisan cheeses, and various salads. We had the option of getting all 9 meat options for additional $15, but we decided to past as the 3 options plus the harvest tables was a lot of food on it's own. I thought the harvest tables were delicious! The variety of salads and the charcuterie table was fantastic! The broccoli and cheddar soup was pretty good, but Panera still gets the win.   The char grilled buttermilk sirloin was cooked to my desire: medium rare, yum. It had a decent flavor, but not something I dream about about. The salmon lacked a lot of flavor and the chicken was just okay. Also we got a pitcher of their Red Apple Orchard Sangria and was not worth the $38, it was extremely sweet and you can't even taste the liquor. Eck.  Overall, a decent experience, but we decided we wouldn't pay the full price.

2014-02-10,5.0,"I went here for Chicago Restaurant Week and could not be happier with my choice. This was my first time here so I was a bit confused as to how things worked, but after speaking with the server, she explained everything and the fun commenced. They have an extensive wine, cocktail and beer menu. I had the Sangria and a wine flight. The  Sangria was one of the best I have ever had - not too dry because of the wine and not too sweet with the juice. It was close to perfect. The buffet appetizers were amazing as well. I had a bit of everything and had no regrets. There is a section for veggies, bread and cheese and meats. I went with two friends and between the 3 of us, we had maybe 6-7 plates on the table. The variety was superb.  Then the brought the meats!! And continued to bring them. The steak was juicy and flavorful, the salmon tender and the chicken was bold and moist. I ate so much I literally had to unbutton my pants and ask them to stop coming by. At this point I thought I couldn't eat another bite...but there was chocolate cake. Now, let me tell you, if someone knows chocolate cake, it's me. I have had it all and so I know what I like and don't like. I am not a huge fan of flourless chocolate cake because I have never had a particularly good one until Zed451. My friend said it was like having spirit fingers in his mouth. It was food heaven! I wasn't too heavy or overly chocolate, it was moist and creamy.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and even though the music was background, it was great. It put you in a happy mood and this happy mood makes you want to eat. I was literally eating and bopping along with the music. I just enjoyed it so much.

2014-02-09,2.0,"Here's the deal, folks.  I would give 5 stars for service, but I had to settle on 2 stars because...after all, it's about the food & drinks.  There was nothing good about either!  (So sad considering the high reviews & the high price). Picture a Brazilian steakhouse & then picture our waiter telling us, ""we are not a Brazilian steakhouse.""  Um, ok...not sure what the difference is?? In a nutshell, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet of salad items, cheese, soup and waiters who walk around with different cuts of meat, chicken and fish.  Eat as much as you like until your pants want to bust open. The cold bar, which I believe they call, ""harvest bar"", is a mixture of unique items like brussel sprout Caesar salad, beet salad, cheeses, breads and soup. My friend & I ordered ""handcrafted"" cocktails...a cucumber & pear mule. I love a well-made Moscow Mule and figured this would be the same, but with a fresh cucumber twist...nope!  It was full of lime and tasted like a margarita gone bad.  I sent it back and asked for a regular Moscow mule...I received the same drink, only more limeade added...blech! The waiter was kind enough to take the drink back and accommodate me with a craft beer.  He didn't charge me for the yucky cocktails either, which was nice.   After we did a few salad bar plates (which were nothing to rave about), we put out our stone to signal the waitstaff to bring the meat/chicken/fish to the table.  It was like a well choreographed dance that happened within minutes of our signal....they kept coming by...with giant skewers of grilled meat!  I think I was more amazed with the staffs' attentiveness and graceful caper around the restaurant than I was with the actual food.  I didn't have one favorable or memorable piece of meat (and we had about 5 different types); my friend whom is allergic to fish kept having the staff come by her with the fish skewer (we made it clear to the chef & waiter well in advance that she was highly allergic & to keep all fish on my side).  The chef even gave us a tutorial when we arrived as to which salad dishes contained fish and should be avoided. Here's my opinion of Zed451: Pros:  They have a free pick-up & drop-off shuttle, the service is excellent (I would give 10 stars for their personality, attentiveness, knowledge...all restaurants should train/hire people like this!) & restaurant is clean. Cons:  The mediocre food was NOT worth $100+, the cocktails were pricey & not made well.  For me, Zed is dead.",0.9935,0.754,0.171,0.075,0.5791233837387684

2014-02-06,5.0,"Recent visit was on 2/3/2014, a Monday, for Chicago restaurant week.  Dinner option was for $33 and you get your choice of 3 meats( salmon, chicken, and bottom sirlon), the salad bar, and a piece of cake. The restaurant serves you meats at table side and is all you can eat. For regular price of $49, you get a choice of 12 meats(salmon, chicken, and bottom sirlon.... wagyu beef, venison, crab cake, chorizo(spicy sausage), tilapia, pork belly, ribeye, and duck breast, with the salad bar, no desert at the end. You can order hot sides, their cream of spinach is fantastic, can't recall the price.  The salad bar, using the term very loosely, included 2 types of soups, kale salad, thai apple salad, pad thai ( noodles), grilled asparagus, cold cooked beans with a thai dressing, an assortment of cheeses, deli meats, perserve fruits, spreads, crackers, and a beets with goatcheese slices. The salad bar was phenomenal and does not disappoint. If you are not an adventerous eater or you dislike veggies, this is section is really not for you.  I made it a mission to have a bite of everything:  salmon- flakey, buttery, and a little fishy because it is cooked with the skin on. chicken- dry and over seasoned bottom sirlon- seasoned with buttermilk ranch. Words cannot describe the deliciousness. must try. wagyu beef- has a cripy ring of fat, very tender, think of it as a filet mignon with a little crispiness texture of bacon on the edge. can't recall what it was seasoned with for the life of me, but this is delicious as well. a must try. venison- also known as reindeer was in my opinion very gamey. it almost tastes very bloody and was served rare.  crab cake- very good, had a good crab to breadcrumb consistency. served with a cucumber relish instead of a creamy dipping sauce, which is what i'm used to. it was good.  chorizo(spicy sausage)- it bites back. spicy, juicy, and nicely done. tilapia- wasn't a fan. was bland. pork belly- sweet, i didn't think it was crispy enough and was servd with a taiwanese kimchi... which i love kimchi in general... but thought it was too bitter. ribeye-  seasoned with garlic and was ok, not was good as the bottom sirlon. duck breast- was served rare, soaked in what tasted like honey and mandarin orange slice on top. i was not a fan.    Overall the foods was worth the money, the service was very attentive and friendly. Keep in mind, it was a Monday and the place was not jammed pack. Ambience was romantic, almost makes you feel like you're at a ski resort log cabin.

For dessert we had the chocolate marquis which was pretty good. The dining area is relaxed and spacious, almost like a lounge setting.

Favorites were the Brussels sprouts and the asparagus as well as the charcuterie selections.  On to the main event. Salmon came first and it was good. Liked the taste but after all I came to a steakhouse. The chicken was surprisingly tender an tasty with a good kick. But the sirloin was by far the highlight.

Personal Tip: Try the meat first, and get full of the deliciousness before you indulge in the salad bar and get to full and come in with a hungry appetite. The Faroe Island Salman, Moroccan Chicken, and Hanger Steak were my favorite.  Our server was not a 'friendly' type. It was as if we had a businessman for our waiter. He spoke to us with 'yes' and 'no's'. Didn't have any expression.

I had been here twice before for drinks on a weekend night over the summer (a great rooftop). The second time was for appetizers and drinks at the bar on a random Sunday. I remembered it was a bit pricey on both those trips but that's expected in river north, so it doesn't come as a surprise. I had a great time on both occasions so when I saw the average rating on yelp without actually reading the reviews I jumped on the opportunity to make a reservation online. I was called the day before to confirm the reservation and explained that it was going to be a surprise birthday dinner.  To my surprise when we arrived we had a round of tequila shots waiting at the table and after a brief explanation I learned that this was going to be a similar dining experience like Fogo. This had an impressive and delicious salad bar. I tried a lil more than 5 different items from their salad bar and was greatly impressed with every option. After that first trip I never had to get up again because the meat servers kept coming around offering us an abundant amount of meats from pork belly to steak to linguiza etc. My favorite was the pork belly with the kimchi. The sangria was on point. Without having ever asked for that standard birthday dessert for my little brother they brought out a beautifully written birthday message on on a plate along side a piece of cake.

It will seriously put you in a food induced coma.  The ambiance is also very nice, modern yet cozy. Service is always spot on.",0.9874,0.707,0.25,0.043,0.7394791666666667
2013-10-28,5.0,"Wow...Zed451 might be a new addition to my top ten in Chicago.  While I have only been once, yesterday, for brunch, the buffet, staff/service, space and price point have me convinced I'll be back. I'm not even sure where to start, but maybe it's this: $34.  That's the price for an unlimited buffet that included fresh fruit, a ton of hot and cold options on a beautiful four-part serving area, and about ten different meat options brought around to the table during the Brazilian steakhouse-like portion of the day. The individual food items were mostly incredible, but there were a couple of dishes worth skipping.  The egg dish brought to the table was fairly weak, and while I skipped the french toast (I can't do nuts, and the toast is littered with walnuts and/or almonds), another person in my party reported that it wasn't so great.  The cappucino cheesecake was also below par., and the cinnamon roll brought to the table was just okay.  But everything else was fantastic: --Chocolate-chip cookies, fudge brownies, and red velvet cupcakes: incredible --Beef, salmon, turkey, sausage (the name is much more complicated than that, but the house-made mustard was crack cocaine), duck, buffalo chicken & waffles: incredible --Cheddar muffins, the bean salad, the oatmeal, the hash browns, and all of the fruit offerings: incredible --The smoky maple cajun bacon brought to the table:  incredible Bloodies and mimosas were separate and priced well, but after seeing the spread, I saved all of the day's calories on the food.  But two other people in my group got the Bloody Mary drinks and thought they were great.  The servers who brought the meat got to know me quite well over the course of two hours and started to bring me my two or three favorites, and dishes were cleared exceptionally fast.  I don't know if my water glass was ever empty. The day's only major misstep?  The soundtrack playing in the background featured a number of not-quite-right songs, including a remix of Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", strangely playing to a techno beat.  Otherwise, well done!",0.9598,0.806,0.128,0.066,0.6053731762065095

2013-10-16,1.0,"I have eaten at Zed451 for dinner and was very please with the food and experience.  Unfortunately, my experience for brunch was drastically different.  I had reservations at 1:15 for brunch.  My parents and I sat there for at least 10 minutes and no one came around so we just helped ourselves to the salad bar.  The waitress finally came around to take our drink orders after we had started eating.  They came around with all the meats, but no one ever came with the chicken and waffles or the crab cake benedict.  Come 2:00 and no one has come around with either still.  Finally, I have to ask our waitress then again to the waiter that is helping her clear the table and they come around 15 minutes later with Buffalo chicken and waffles and the crab cake benedict.  If I hadn't asked, I doubt they would have come around with either considering they kept trying to take away our big plate.  Overall, I felt rushed and the food was only mediocre.  I was very disappointed in the fact that I had to ask several times for some of the dishes to come around.  I was even more annoyed at the fact the guy kept trying to clear our table, but there were two large parties next to us in which weren't being rushed in the least bit.  They were able to keep their plates and the waiters were coming around constantly to see if they wanted more food.",0.0727,0.867,0.067,0.066,0.5451428571428572
2013-10-14,4.0,"Came here for dinner with a couple couples at the recommendation of friends. I've been to one other Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago, so I knew what to expect but was curious how ZED would be different. We started off with drinks in the bar (I had sangra - delicious) before our party arrived and we were seated in the dining room at one of the long tables around the firepit. Very nice ambiance. Dinner started with visits to the harvest tables - soups, salads, charcuterie, etc. Everything was quite tasty, the pamesean cauliflower soup and guacamole deviled eggs were hits among out group, and I also loved this mushroom with feta dressing salad that they had, and the charcuterie table had lots of options to try. Once we had our fill of that course, we put our little rocks out to indicate we were ready for food, and we had a steady stream of the meat guys (I'm sure there is a proper name for them) coming around. I tried everything but the chicken (I'm not a fan) and everything was delicious. The hanger steak, duck, salmon and sausage were my favorites. For dessert, we tried the cookie skillet (so good), creme bruele and chocolate cake, and a few of us had port. All very good. After dinner, we headed up to the rooftop for a nightcap, which was lovely. And overall, we had excellent service.  I would definitely love to come back for drinks on the rooftop, and perhaps try their menu up there. I wouldn't mind coming back for dinner, but personally this isn't my favorite Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago. Although it is quite good.",0.9957,0.785,0.194,0.021,0.5901495726495726

2013-09-28,5.0,"Zed is a Brazilian style restaurant with an American twist. I found food to be better than Fogo De Chao.  The first course is buffet style. There were a variety of cheese and quality cold cuts. The salad bar was interesting with tasty pickles, savory wild mushrooms and crisp lettuce. Even soup to choose from. But I recommend not to over eat with the first course since the best is to come. Servers are signal that you are ready for the second course. Then they bring meats to carve right in front of you. I enjoyed their variety very much. I would recommend buttermilk steak, duck, venison, pork belly and catfish. It certainly a place you come hungry and leave full for about $50 a person.

Fine that doesn't really matter, I still decided to give it a try and went to the salad bar, they had the same options all around in different locations and not so much of a variety as listed on their website. I mean come on , am I the only one who noticed it ?? , The taste of the salads & cheese were ehhhg not out of the ordinary, but I still was optimistic to try their steaks & sea food, buddy was I wrong, I'm no chef but I think I cook better steak and fish than what I tried that night. Their meats were to spicy and over seasoned !!! The duck was disgusting according to my wife, it tasted gooey and with a horrible flavor, I'm no chef but that only happens when the duck is not clean well.  Over all I paid an expensive dinner for the location and ambiance , which I wont lie is nice, but I just don't like to look fancy I like to taste fancy.

2013-09-12,4.0,"...so the night before my birthday, my friends told me to get a good night's rest because they made brunch reservations at a surprise location. The next day, I got ready, met up with them and waited for our other friends to pick us up. Something you should know about my group of friends: NOBODY is ever on time...so we waited, waited AND waited...all of the sudden, out of the blue, this big black shuttle bus came rolling down the street. It wasn't until it got closer that I realized my friends were taking me to Zed451! It was a moment of pure bliss -- I've been eying this place for a while so I was absolutely thrilled to finally try it out! My friends are the best! Fast forward 15 minutes later when we arrived at the restaurant, this place is niiiiiiiiiiice! The interior combines a blend of earthy wooden trim and fire places, which exudes a sense of warmth and comfort. The hostess greeted us and we were seated promptly. Soon after, our server appeared and wished me a happy birthday which was a nice touch. He then went onto explain their concept for brunch which includes a harvest bar before diving into the shared plates all of which are AYCE. During brunch, they serve $3 mimosas and $5 bloody marys, which of course we had to have. After a brief explanation, our gluttonous pursuit of deliciousness ensued. The harvest bar is located in the center of the restaurant with seating area on either side with additional seating on the second floor and rooftop. Items included an assortment of roasted/sauteed veggies, unique salads, charcuterie, artisan cheeses, biscuits, french toast, duck confit hash browns, fruit and mini desserts. Word from the wise: don't eat too much of this; you wanna save room for all the items that are brought to your table! After finishing your harvest bar plate, you'll find a small saucer with stones at your table. I guess these are the equivalent to the green/red circular discs you'll find at churrascarias which signal to the staff that you are ready for the main courses. The items we tried included huge cinnamon rolls, crab cake benedict, glazed ham, maple cajun bacon, buffalo chicken and waffles, roasted turkey breast, tomato basil frittata, buttermilk bottom sirloin, Atlantic salmon, and linguica sausage.  Standouts were definitely the bacon, crab cake benny, turkey and chicken 'n waffles. The bacon is thick cut with a great balance of sweetness from the maple and spicy kick from the cajun spices. I'm a sucker for anything involving runny egg yolks so this was a no-brainer. The waffle was crispy which is the way I prefer it. The chicken also had that sweet/spicy combo similar to the bacon with sweet syrup and spicy buffalo sauce. The turkey was some of the most moist and juicy I've ever had - make sure you get it with the cranberry sauce. The frittata was ehh - a bit dry. The salmon was inconsistent -- my first was waaaay too rare and the second piece was completely overcooked. The rest of what we sampled was great though. Overall, I had an amazing experience! So why only four stars? While most of the service was excellent, our server wasn't the best. He started out very friendly and engaging. However, as the meal progressed, he became complacent and seemed increasingly annoyed with us almost like we were burdening him, which was disappointing because we were celebrating a special occasion. Needless to say, his attitude put a damper on our experience. People go for the food, but they return for the service. Even with the small hiccups here and there, I had an overall positive experience and had a great birthday! I highly recommend trying Zed451 for brunch!  Oh, I almost forgot -- in regards to the shuttle bus, a great amenity that Zed451 offers and other restaurants should consider, is a complimentary shuttle service to and from the restaurant.

2013-09-02,1.0,I'm one of those people that does not love crowds or waiting in line for hours to get into a club.  That being said on Monday night my friend and I were in the mood for cocktails on a rooftop.  Zed451 was our second choice.  Now keep in mind I am rating the rooftop lounge area and not the restaurant.  Rooftop access is first come basis. PROS:   No wait (for Monday@6pm).  Plenty of seating on the rooftop.  Very nicely decorated with great ambiance. Abundance of comfortable seating.  Easy to carry a conversation.  Friendly staff. CONS:  Sadly the cocktails are so watered down that you literally do not taste the alcohol.  I had a Mojito and my friend ordered the Moscow Mule and neither one of us got tipsy.  We did complain to the waitress and asked they improve our second round.  Sadly it was just as bad.  So after two drinks we still were faced with the fact that it was still Monday.  Cocktails are very pricey so there is no excuse for skimping out on the alcohol.  In addition the food menu offered on the rooftop is quite disappointing.  None of the choices listed jumped out at us.  They need to add appetizers that offer more substance and save the bits of cold cut meat and miniature bread bites for the pretentious crowd. I'm giving Zed451 only 1 star for the ambiance.  It is without a doubt relaxing and beautiful.  But this is a lounge and it should be serving memorable cocktails not kiddy juice.  For this reason I will not return for cocktails.  Recommendation:  If ambiance is important then request a beer.  There's no way they can mess that up.  Good Luck!,0.9365,0.753,0.146,0.101,0.6229700854700855

2013-08-13,4.0,"The hubby planned me the surprise of all surprise parties for me at this place, so this review may be a little colored by the event itself. Nonetheless, this place raised the bar and kept it elevated on one of the best nights of my life, and for that I am very thankful.  I don't openly admit my real age very often, and this year was a milestone. Let's just say that finally I cannot be a victim of age discrimination if I am a finalist for a job. The hubby did quite a bit of orchestrating to get fifteen of my friends here to celebrate with me. We were all impressed. The drink menu is sublime. There are few other words that can accurately capture how wonderful it is. Trust me, I had four of their specialties (watermelon mojito, Pims cup--actually, I had two of those, the bourbon lemonade--yep, two of those puppies as well, and the sangria, but it was over almost five hours, and it was my birthday). There is something for everyone on the drink menu, and the wine list was impressive as well. My friend had a couple of different reds by the glass and said each was as good, if not better, than the one that had preceded it.  Now, for the food. The charcuterie and salad bars are phenomenal. I tried to get a small bite of everything there. The cheese and fruit selections on the charcuterie bar, notably the apricots and figs, were divine. There were several different cheeses, and all were phenomenal. The salad bar had several different options. I did not sample either soup, but a couple of friends raved about the selections, and these friends were two of the pickiest at the table, so I can vouch that they would not rave about something unless it was absolutely rave-worthy. That's all. They also brought some great biscuits to the table during the appetizer phase that were very good. Now, to the main course: the meat! As I've said before, I am a pescatarian, but on this night I was gladly a carnivore. Some of the selections were out of this world, particularly the chicken and the salmon, and though I didn't get to try it, everyone at the table who had the hanger steak said it was the best of the evening. The prime rib was good, as was the sirloin. My only feedback would be that for a table of fifteen, when an option is brought, perhaps two servers should come to the table and start on either end. It made it difficult for all of us to try the same thing at the same time and compare. (My work wife, Brooke, was the only lady at the table and got the lion's share of the attention: she found it entertaining, as did the rest of us.)  There were a couple of concerns. The crab cakes were not good, and that was disappointing. Perhaps it is not the best option for skewer service, and we never saw the catfish that they supposedly were serving that evening. Moreover, we almost had a scare as I was served the duck that had an almond crusting (side note: I am deathly allergic to tree nuts, and dessert would have been an Epi-pen if I had not overheard the server describing the dish to my friend sitting across the table from me.) They did apologize and brought me fresh silver and a plate, but that kind of lapse in detail could prove costly. They might want to think about either asking about food allergies or explaining things such as nut crustings or other potentially common allergies before serving anyone from the skewers.  Service was great and made the evening enjoyable. After dinner we did get to go up to the rooftop for a nightcap (yep, another bourbon lemonade) but it felt very night-clubbish, complete with the velvet rope admittance. That causes the loss of a star. With a few tweaks, this place could be the gem of Chicago dining. Those tweaks notwithstanding, it was a great experience.",0.9982,0.81,0.156,0.035,0.5431481481481482

Then, one-by-one, we were served buttermilk ranch marinated steak, some amazing turkey and salmon, and buffalo chicken and waffles! There were a few other things too, but they're escaping me.  With brunch they also have $5 bottomless bloody Mary's or mimosas.

2013-08-11,1.0,"I was a regular at this place and enjoyed their lounge area several times.  I hadn't been there in about a month and today I went and ordered what I usually got.  Turns out they canceled their Sunday special for the $6 dollar burger which used to be a good deal.  The music was louder than usual today, I guess they thought it was a hipper place now which it's not by any means.  The waitress and bartenders are all fat and not very attractive.  They carry the pretentious attitude but, there is nothing in this place that can back it up.  They need a freaking reality check.   So today I ordered the Zed Burger medium and when I got it back the cook kind of just threw it up on the bar.  I took two bites and got closer to the middle.  It was almost raw wouldn't pass anywhere as rare.  I asked them for another burger and it took about 25 minutes and they apologized and asked me how the second burger was.  I responded ""its cooked"".  Even the second burger was messed up, it didn't have the bacon on it as advertised in the menu and I paid $12 bucks for it.  I should have just got up and left but, I was already too hungry so I ate it anyway.  The only consolation was a free glass of Stella.  The dinner crowd is usually slow at this place except for Friday and Saturday night where there is a line because nearly everything else in River North is crowded.  This place has gone way down hill and their attitude really sucks.  I always tipped about 20% and had decent enough experiences.  They seemed to have had a lot of staff turnover and I can't seem to recognize anyone here anymore.  They have a lame tacky as hell bus with Zed 451 painted on the sides always coming through the neighborhood and often it's parked outside the restaurant.   So if you are looking for a good Brazilian steakhouse run from this place and go down to any of the other Brazilian places in the area where your going to get better service and better food.  Zed 451 is a wannabe place where their fat ass bartenders and lame staff need to get a grip.  Just because you have a line for your rooftop bar on the weekends doesn't mean you can act like your restaurant and lounge are up to the same standard.   I'll never go to Zed 451 again and anyone rating this place above two stars probably works for this place.",-0.6909,0.868,0.063,0.069,0.4016069821990875
2013-08-07,2.0,"The food was 3 stars. The rest brought it down to 2. The food needs more variety. Also, they made us wait for the venison for 15 minutes after we were done eating. And they were out of the duck, which our waitress promised was there at the beginning of our meal. The meat was not very flavorful, and they do NOT have different levels of cooking on the skewer like some other places (my parents like medium to well-done [I know, I'm ashamed to admit it], while I prefer medium or medium rare). The salad bar/antipasto is just okay. A LOT of pork so if yo don't eat pork, you may miss on a lot of stuff. The servers were pretty nice, especially the one who offered--and followed through--to make my parents a platter of well done meats. But they each really only came once. And after that, the waitress came and asked if there is anything else we would like to try. I prefer the system of cards or tokens on the table, and for the servers to keep coming. Don't worry, I won't end up with meat on my plate that I will not eat. Overall, the experience was just not what I was expecting. The meat wasn't delicious, the salad bar was just okay (although the broccoli soup was amazing). And the rooftop was just place to be seen while you are packed like sardines. You know, ZED451 used to be in the suburbs on Finley and Roosevelt. In its place, Chama Gaucha opened. Now THAT is a place that I can get behind.

They do not come around frequently  enough and when they do, it was the same few items .No lamb, limited beef selection.

2013-06-06,5.0,"The day before I went to Zed 451, I got married. My reception was at Texas de Brazil, and their restaurant rocked it so hard that I didn't think I would eat anything nearly as good on my honeymoon.  In less than 24 hours, I knew just how wrong I was. It turns out that I can be quite naive sometimes. I can also be quite analytical at times, so while I was enjoying my dinner I was actively making comparisons between my dinner at Zed and the dinner I had at Texas de Brazil, trying to determine which had the better meats, sauces, and extras- probably so I could sound informed when I wrote my inevitable Yelp review. It seemed to make sense at the time. Both have that Brazillian steakhouse service, with a primary server and gauchos who come to the table and cut as much meat as you'd like from skewers. Both places have the ""Salad Bar"" which really isn't unless you've ever seen things like Salmon Ceveche and Duck Pastrami when you hit the Sizzler. Both have similar price points and food quality.  Then at one point during my meal, perhaps for the first time ever, I just gave up comparing anything. When your food is fantastic, your servers nail the experience, and the stylish atmosphere is perfect, do you really need to worry about whether you'll be back again? Or whether you'd recommend the experience to someone else? It's not like there's a Texas de Brazil that's around the corner and you'll have to think carefully before deciding where to spend your money. In the end I think I'd say Zed has the better salad bar and Texas has the better meat. The focus of the restaurants are just on different things. But again, who cares? Great is great. It may help the experience a little when you say ""it's the first night of our honeymoon,"" and the staff there goes ""OHHHHHH!!!!"" but really, I think the experience we had was on par for just about everyone there.  Apparently Zed has rooftop seating, which a friend of mine claims is ""baller."" So I am going to recommend it now. Try to get the rooftop seating. Although, if your seating happens to be in a back corner near the window looking out onto the city, it's a good a place as any.

We've been to the other Brazilian steakhouses in the city (Brazzaz, Fogo, Texas), and by comparison, Zed served up a lot more seafood (swordfish, salmon) and service in general was a lot slower / more calm.  Food was excellent, but we experienced pretty long wait times between meat servers, and we were often passed up by servers heading to larger tables and a private party in the room behind us.  That got old, and the meat-eaters were not happy, especially after we requested more meat multiple times.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly and did mention that they encourage a more leisurely meal and suggested pacing yourself, so the wait may just be a part of that.  It was a noticeable change from other more swarming restaurants (Fogo, Texas).  The salad bar (Harvest Bar) was plentiful with a range of cured meats, cheese, two soups, salads, fruit, bread.  A nice selection.   A leisurely meal was indeed had, and we enjoyed ourselves for 3 hours on a Saturday night.  Our waitress called the meat-eaters ""champs"".  The restaurant was full, but never had a packed / swamped feel to it.  Seating was spread out enough that we never felt crowded or rushed.

She forgot to get us chips when we ordered them, since she told us they were out of the salad, then came 45 mins later and they were not out of it. So no chips, but we waited for the salad. In the mean time we asked both her and another server to bring us some more water. We weren't able to get any until we reminded our server when she brought the salad. When we got the bill, she charged us incorrectly. Supposedly the transaction was voided.  My account has still not been refunded the larger amount that was charged by mistake.

2013-05-12,4.0,"$29/person brunch here is the bomb dot com. It will make you more full than you have ever been, like on par with post Thanksgiving food coma. But every once in a while, stuffing yourself with delicious brunch foods is just what the doctor ordered. Ok, maybe a doctor wouldn't recommend it, but you get the idea. My advice to newcomers at the Zed brunch is PACE YOURSELF. Yes, everything on the harvest tables is awesome and you could have a really satisfying brunch just from those buffet offerings. I think I might actually like the harvest table stuff more than the meat-on-stick/main dish options. They have really creative, delicious salads (kale + quinoa, shaved asparagus, Brussel sprout Caesar) and an amazing charcuterie spread with some really unique cheeses (blackened cheddar) and meats. Also, don't skip the duck confit potatoes. In addition to unlimited harvest table visits and meats-on-sticks that are carved table-side, each table also gets a giant cinnamon roll (very Cinnabun-esque, with gooey rich frosting), a frittata, and a side of maple cajun bacon. Bacon and cinnamon roll are muy bueno -- the frittata is skippable, in my opinion. I guess it's for those who must have eggs with their brunch.   Meats are very varied and most are delicious -- love the ham, the bottom sirloin, and the spicy linguisa. Also love the buffalo chicken and waffles. Also, $5 Bloody Marys and $3 Mimosas. I can't figure out how this is cost-effective for them, but I ain't complainin'. The service is usually on-point and everyone is friendly/seems not too pissed to be working brunch. We had trouble finding our server to pay toward the end of the meal, but other than that, it was smooth.   It's a giant, cavernous space and they cater to a lot of large parties, but when I come in with just one other person, I never feel neglected.

2013-05-07,3.0,"I ate here.. And it was okay..  It's not a Brazilian steakhouse but they serve it like Brazilian gauchos do. Everything I tasted was good but my palette was VERY confused. The salad bar has a lot of interesting salads. The meats and cheese were really good (especially their duck pastrami). Their meats were good and I love how they also have fish there. I LOVED their salmon. It made everything I didn't like go away.  I ordered their pitcher of sangria and I had to return it back because I really didn't like it. It didn't remind me of sangria AT ALL. I'm happy they took it back and took it off my bill and I just got a glass of red wine instead. This place isn't the place where you gorge yourself with meat. Everything seemed like a tasting. From the salads to the meats they didn't really mix well together. Asian pork belly, hanger steak with chimichurri, and then some steak with grilled onions? It's hard to have all that on your plate and just enjoy eating.  The bacon butter bread that they provided was okay. It was a little sweet though.  I'm upset that their sides were ala carte. We ordered their corn side dish and it seemed they tried to imitate elotes from Chicago, but didn't get it right (too much lime!).  I think what I'm trying to say after all my confusing jibber jabber is this place is confusing. I was going here for steak hoping that was the main focus, but it was not. Everything seemed very complex and they went for different flavors for everything, which I can appreciate, but not at this extent. I believe all the steaks and meats came with a sauce (not the salmon, and it was my favorite) or an accompaniment and that just really sucks. Good steak shines through by themselves and doesn't need sauces, fancy poached pears, or sauces with 30 ingredients in them.  If you prefer simple good food, this is not the place. It'll boggle your mind what stuff they can come up with to try and tickle your senses. They were all good but it's not a good transition to have a spicy sausage to sweet asian pork to a navy bean soup. As my boyfriend said, it was like we were on the show ""CHOPPED"" and trying different things from different places with weird ingredients. I like simple GREAT marbled aged steak without the fancy sauce names and unfortunately this place does not do that for me.",0.9975,0.753,0.195,0.052,0.51375

Not a great view, but you really don't even realize it. Plenty of places to sit, no shortage of wait staff. I thought it was great. There is a rule in place which does not allow them to have music on the rooftop, so if you are looking for some type of wild roof top party, you won't find it here. On the way out, I took a look at the inside restaurant and it looked awesome. I will certainly be back next time I am in Chicago. Until next time.",0.9676,0.746,0.202,0.052,0.4636363636363636

The service has never been great, but was always ""good enough."" Well, not anymore. My husband and I met a friend for drinks and were there for about 2-3 hours. Their wine list used to be pretty impressive, but it definitely shrunk significanatly since the last time we were there. We asked if there were any barolos on the list anymore, and our waitress, who really had no clue, said she didn't think so. My husband asked if there were any Tuscan-characteristic wines, and she proceeded to look at the menu and slowly point out the two wines that explicitly stated ""Tuscany."" Obviously. If you have absolutely no idea about wines, SAY SO. Don't pretend and point out the obvious on the menu. We can read, too. Later, she gave me an ""old"" drink menu that had been switched out about 4 days prior. When I ordered a cocktail, she said they didn't have it anymore. When I asked if they could make it anyway, she said no. When I asked if she could ask the actual bartenders, she said no. She claimed they no longer had the ""clementine"" liquor, and I asked if she could maybe inquire about another liquor that might be similar to make a cocktail that was just somewhat like that. Of course, she wouldn't even ask for me. Their other 5 cocktails on the menu didn't look appetizing, so I just said forget it.  When we were leaving, my husband, who is a disabled vet on forearm crutches who has visible difficulty in walking, was struggling to get the door open and through the second door where I was picking him up in the car.

Another thing to note, the Harvest bar had no desserts at dinner time.   For $50, you would think they would.   They have desserts out for brunch.   You can pay extra if you want dessert, but we did not.  It ended up being $65 a person without any drinks or dessert.   Really, not worth it.  The food was high quality, but the experience was not fun.

We make our way over to N Clark St and from outside I could not help but notice the large windows and the unique style architecture of the building itself. The floors are all wood and inside the main dining room there is a large fireplace. We were greeted as we walked in and seated promptly at our table.

Our server was superbly attentive to our table and even had the good grace to joke around with a few awkward statements made by a team member. Not his fault just all brain fried from a long week of work haha shrug. Anyway... We order a few bottles of vino with help from the server and I was impressed by how knowledgeable she was over the vino list.  The Harvest table was fantastic. Plenty of salad items, charcuterie items, and cheeses to choose from. It was a nice way to pick a few items and have some veggies to offset the meats that would come to the table. From the meat selection, the chefs brought around rib eyes, sirloin, lamb, crab cakes, Moroccan chicken, And Asian Pork Belly. Honestly all the meats were super tender and flavored really well.

One is that they have the best deal for their full Farmhouse Salad Bar and Assortment of Specially Prepared Meats in town. The salad bar has so many options that you can easily stuff yourself on two full plates of food and still not have tried everything in it. There are cheeses, cured meats, soups, salads, and different flavors and types of vegetable dishes. Their meat options range from fish and crab cakes to duck breast and venison.  The second thing I love about Zed is their roof top bar. It is in a beautiful location with great views of the Chicago skyline and serve filling, vibrant and flavorful appetizers/ small plates. Their bartenders pour proper dirty martinis but can also whip up some fun, fruity house cocktails. There is no better spot in the area for great drinks, warm sun and fresh air! When I first started coming to Zed, my favorite meat options where the crab cakes, the duck breast and of course their perfectly cooked salmon. Since I have become a vegetarian I truly appreciate how much effort they put into making their Salad Bar stand alone.

Walking in, you'll notice that Zed451 is very inviting with its warm wood tones and multiple fireplaces.  Service is great and we were seated quickly. I particularly like their dining format.  It is like a Brazilian steakhouse, where meat is brought to you and there is an extensive salad bar type buffet known as the Harvest Table.  The meats were tender and flavorful, while the Harvest table had a diverse plethora of foods to balance the meats including poached pears, cheeses, and black bean soup. Such a dining format is very quick with little wait time for food, offers a variety of foods, and is excellent for conversations. Instead of waiting hungrily for the food and then trying to converse after your large meal is brought, Zed451 allowed us to have a plate of assorted food, chat, grab some more food, chat, and so on.  Check it out!",0.9815,0.844,0.156,0.0,0.5369747899159664

2013-02-04,3.0,"I dined here for Chicago Restaurant Week, which means that I didn't have the full experience. With Chicago Restaurant Week, we had access to the harvest tables (the buffet); three of the meats, which servers bring to your table and carve for you; and a dessert, for $33. However, with wine and a cocktail, I still ended up paying over $120 for my evening here (this is for me alone). Go figure. My friend and I enjoyed the selection on the harvest tables. My favorites were the red wine poached pears with blue cheese and the artisan cheeses. The tableside meats available to us were also tasty. I especially enjoyed the char grilled buttermilk sirloin and the Moroccan chicken. We also had an extremely friendly waitress, and having the chef come out at the end of the meal to introduce himself was a nice touch. That said, we also ventured into the lounge, and that's where I was a little less than pleased. One of the waitresses was not particularly kind and seemed put out by our requests, so we moved to the bar, which was decidedly better service. Still, I wasn't wowed and I felt there was a slightly snooty vibe about this place, which seemed ridiculous. How can an all-you-can-eat feast be snooty? Furthermore, I've dined at several Brazilian churrascarias and this was the first time I felt this vibe -- it was as if the restaurant were trying to be trendy and exclusive. Quite simply, this wasn't for me. It's a pity because most of the service we received was wonderful. If not for the waitress in the lounge, this 3-star experience would have been truly top-notch.",0.9679,0.853,0.111,0.036,0.5676587301587303
2013-01-23,3.0,"Zed451 is a fancy buffet, which isn't a terrible idea. Unfortunately, as with most buffets, the emphasis can sometimes lean more towards quantity than quality. When you sit down, the server asks if it is your first time dining at Zed451, which is actually a necessary question here. He or she explains that dinner will be in two parts: the first part is the buffet (or ""harvest tables"") followed by the parade of meats. In this second part you take one of the small polished stones from the plate in the center and place it on the table, indicating that you want the servers to keep bringing large skewers of twelve different meat options to the table. Put the stone back and they stop. It's a nicer version of that little flipcard they have at other Brazilian steakhouses. Like everything here, the harvest salad bar varies widely in quality. There are platters of rich and juicy roasted pineapple (from Madagascar, if it makes a difference), a salty duck pastrami that pairs well with the wine-poached figs, a tasty American grana, airy deviled eggs, and a crisp apple salad with lots of fresh mint. But there is also a too-chunky mushroom soup that tastes of everything but mushrooms, a boring potato salad, and many ho-hum greens, breads, and meats. The server will probably tell you not to fill up on any of this anyway. The meat/seafood also varies, in quality and preparation. The selections are beef-heavy; I believe a quarter of options were beef. The prime rib was flavorful, with a smoky and crisp char on the outside. The venison was rich and cooked perfectly. Linguica had a welcome heat. Chicken and seafood was almost all dry and overcooked - the catfish was a gritty paste. Sauces are only so-so. They REALLY like chipotle here. The stones don't really seem to matter - they bring meat until your plate is cleared. They give you so much that it feels wasteful - you want to taste it all, but there is no way you can eat twelve different meats in the portions they serve. Honestly, the best idea would be to share one piece with everyone at your table. You can always get more. The restaurant is very warm and inviting, with lots of candles and fire. Service was so-so. Our waitress was friendly at first, but then became uncomfortable and distant. They refold your napkin when you get up from the table, but then ask you to keep your dirty forks and knives to use again (so you have to put them directly on the table). When the meat comes you are supposed to continue using the same dull butter knife to cut the meat, so you end up hacking away at some of it. Now that I have been, in the future I would know what to get and what to stay away from. But, to be honest, for the amount you are spending you can eat an excellent entree at any of the city's best restaurants.",0.9941,0.817,0.137,0.046,0.520549565738245
2013-01-19,2.0,"I think that Brazilian steakhouses are fun in general. It's cool to have servers come by and put delicious meats on your plate like a buffet that comes to you. They'd be great for a bachelorette party because splitting the bill would be easy peasy - everyone's food is the same price plus the cost of their drinks. Zed451 has the atmosphere. It is spacious, high ceilings, impressive decor, and dim lighting. It also has the service. Everyone who came our way was friendly, generous, and accommodating. I really have no complaints. Heck - they even sent their free shuttle to pick us up and bring us to the restaurant! I guess I'm a food snob. I've mentioned in some other reviews that I once considered TGI Friday's to be my all-time favorite restaurant. The only time it crosses my mind now is when I think about my palette evolution. Zed451 used to blow my mind. I've been to it about three times over the past seven years. I think it's changed and so have I. I seem to remember that the Harvest Bar was crazy amazing. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. This time not so much. The food was really salty. There weren't as many fresh veggies. It was good, but not incredible. I only went to the Harvest Bar once. I also remember that the meats were like, OMGoogle WOW. This time I found them to be overly seasoned and also dependent on accompanying sauces to lend (disguise?) flavor. My favorite was the catfish, but we also liked the Wagyu Beef. In the end, I think I had two or three different pieces of beef, two pieces of catfish, and one piece of swordfish. The pieces were only slices and not whole steaks or anything. You know - enough for a sample. Everything was so salty that I drank my water. I don't usually drink a whole lot of water while I'm eating (it fills me up and takes up valuable stomach real estate intended for food), but this time I made an exception. I also drank my entire seasonal Old Fashioned. It was delicious at first and then too sugary about half way through. I drank water after that too. The drinking was all rather irritating considering that I didn't eat enough to justify paying $49 for food alone. The entire bill for two dinners, my Old Fashioned, and two glasses of wine came to $142 (before tip). We agreed that the price was CRAZY considering that we could have eaten better quality food at nearby Cafe des Architectes or Naha.",0.9928,0.817,0.146,0.037,0.5954666666666666

Two of us were there on a not-so-busy night and got a taste of everything. After we had about 6 or 7 different meats (that crispy Asian pork belly is DIVINE) a serving chef came over and asked us to point out which ones we hadn't tried yet and made sure they all made a stop at our table shortly after. I preferred the service we got from the chefs than our actual server who was kind of absent when we needed drinks or had questions, but it wasn't too terrible.

He helped recommend a couple of wines and even brought some samples for us to try before we made the decision. Throughout the meal he catered to our every need and continually asked if there were any dishes we had not received, if we would like extra of anything, etc. The highlight of the meal was the chicken...very tender and amazing flavor! None of the meats were as salty as most other steakhouses, which was good because who wants to be dehydrated for the rest of the night?

2012-12-06,2.0,"ZED451 is located just west of Chicago's Magnificent Mile.  It is a Brazilian style steakhouse even though it doesn't advertize itself as such.  It has a large barroom and a separate large dining room with both having a very sharp modern motif.  Basically, this type of restaurant serves an assortment of barbecued meats brought tableside on large skewers by servers for a fixed price.  Each server carries a single item, e.g., beef, pork, chicken, and lamb, and goes around to the tables where pieces are sliced off and served.  I had never tried a restaurant like this before because I didn't think that I would like it.  However, this past Thanksgiving plans were made to eat out and when ZED451 was suggested, I agreed. Our party consisted of four first-time customers.  We arrived about 20 minutes before our early evening reservation and found that both the bar and dining areas were doing a booming business.  After a short while we were seated in the dining room.  We were given a waitress to oversee our table and acquaint us with the dining procedures.  First, we all helped ourselves to the ""harvest tables,"" which were buffets with a wide assortment of appetizers that included cheeses, salads, fruits, and processed meats.  Subsequently, a procession of servers began bringing the various meats (and one salmon dish) to our table one item at a time.  Small amounts of each selection were provided at a brisk pace with the intervals between servings set to allow us sufficient time to consume the food but with little time to spare.  Because of the holiday three kinds of turkey were offered that was consistent with what I was told when I had made an inquiry with the restaurant in advance of our visit.  What I wasn't told was that the turkey selections displaced the duck, venison, and lamb offerings that are usually on the menu, which was disappointing. The quality of the food at the buffets was just so-so.  Although there was a wide variety of items, some tasted dried out and nothing was remarkable.  Equally unimpressive were the skewed foods.  The rib eye steak was the best of the lot but nothing special.  We all passed on the side dishes, e.g., sweet corn, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach that were available for an additional cost.  Although our servers were personable and efficient, I found that their parade repeatedly interrupted the flow of our conversation and became intrusive.  In effect, the servers became a show and too much the focus of our attention, which detracted from our enjoying one another's company.  Also, the noise level in the dining room was very loud and inhibited our conversation.   I did not care for the serving style of ZED451and thought that the quality of the food was mediocre.  Moreover, for the fixed price of $48, which did not include sides, beverages, dessert, or tip and taxes, it was grossly overpriced.   To be fair, our party had mixed feelings about this restaurant.  Two persons really liked the experience and the other one shared my opinion.",0.9525,0.866,0.082,0.052,0.4667828106852496

Check the table before getting the party from the bar and seating them at the table.  The place is beautiful.  Our server was super friendly.  And possibly the worst server in the world.  Several people were not given plates until asking multiple times.  Unacceptable.  Who wants to eat alone at a party?  The small plate selection is minimal.  After our plates were cleared the other party had left our area.  The waitress never came back.  It was over a half an hour before the waitress returned.  We had wanted cocktails and perhaps dessert.  I go one diet coke with my meal, despite asking every single staff member that walked by our table.  I had high hopes.  I really wanted to like the place but all I can say is the waitress had a very nice smile and was polite when we actually saw here.",0.9847,0.735,0.195,0.07,0.4135921325051759

We were seated, and after 10 minutes of not being greeted, and no water, I called someone over and asked them if we could be service.  They apologized and quickly got a server for us. The harvest bar, was good, nothing spectacular - Texas de Brazil has a much bigger selection.  As for the meat, we literally got one piece at a time.  There were many times where we were just waiting for someone to come around.  And when they did, they gave us a little portion, (which was fine, we could of asked for more ) but extremely rare.  I personally like medium rare, but the lamb was so rare it didn't look safe. There were no sides included, like the mashed potatoes or plantains, like the many other steak houses.  If you did order them, it was extra.  Every 10 minutes the waiter came  by and asked us if the lamb, fish or ..... came.  At the other steak houses, they would just come over, we never had to ask nor wait as long as we did. To top off the poor service and the bad food, the music in the restaurant does not match the ambiance.  They played hit music like Adele, but sung by another artists.  Fine for a bar, but a steak house???

It's a lovely, airy, open space.  The whole massive-amounts-of-meat-for-brunch was a new, and sort of odd concept  to me. I enjoyed most of it, but it had that ""this should be dinner feel"" about it. It has the feel of Fogo or Brzzzazzz with the guys strolling to offer slices of various meats. I tried just about everything as far as the meats go--I did not taste whatever sausage they had on a skewer but I had the salmon, (good) the steak, (quite tough though everyone else at the table felt it melted in their mouths--mine was awful) turkey (amazing) ham (delicious and I'm not a ham fan) Some of the combinations just did not work-for example the waffle with buffalo chicken on it, to me was revolting. Other people at our table liked it-it just tasted really awful to me. The waffle by itself was good--the buffalo chicken did not work. Also, the crab cake was more liike a salt-lick. The cheese biscuits were unappetizing, not like either Brzzazzz's or fogo's which are both amazing. These were very heavy and flour-y with shredded (jack?) cheese on top. the combination did not work. The desserts were delish! I had samples of just about all of them including the red velvet cupcake, the pumpkin cheesecake, (fab)  the peanut bar (which I didn't like but others did) I also thought the cinnamon roll tasted hard/stale.

The kitchen crew was also constantly coming over with dishes that were made in smaller quantities, but with much more care.  Some might argue it's their way of filling you up, but I would say these dishes are often better than any of the BBQ meat or harvest bar stuff, so I'm not complaining. The desserts are all so intricately made, I can never bare to eat them.  I just take a ton of pictures of them and leave the eating to my friend.  But they do make quite amazing desserts too! After our awesome meal, we were headed to the shopping district nearby, and they had a small van waiting outside to take us there.  Complimentary service, they said.  HOW AMAZING IS THAT!!  I had known that they could come to your hotel to pick you up for the meal, but had no idea they would also drop you off at your later destination!  This was by far the best service I'd had from a restaurant!  On my later trips, I had also had them pick me up at the hotel, but asked if they could drop me off at the airport afterwards.  They agreed!  It was awesome!  And they were super nice about it too, even giving us discount cards for our next visit! I should have written this review much earlier, right after my initial trip to Chicago, but I never found the time, and lo and behold, I ended up going there again on my next trip out to Chi.  Time and time again, they surprise me as to how great the service is here. The decor here is very suitable for dinner and bar/lounge atmosphere, although I've personally never been here at night.  I imagine it would be quite the intimate date spot.",0.9978,0.794,0.181,0.025,0.5240127758420443
2012-09-14,5.0,"ZED451 is my new favorite restaurant!  I went to ZED yesterday with my mom for my birthday. We came upon the restaurant by happenstance after driving around for almost an hour deciding where to go. As we drove past, she mentioned seeing it before and wondering what was up with it. It looks awesome from the outside architecturally, and doesn't disappoint inside either. We walked in at about 5:30 on a Thursday night without a reservation and had no problem getting a table. Having been our first time, the hostess was great at explaining their concept of the harvest table, where you serve yourself with amazingly fresh prepared seasonal selections, situated around a central fire pit.  As we were seated, our server brought out a small plate of a specially prepared daily item, some sort of corn flake with a pana cotta, which was delicious. Stepping up to the harvest table was so exciting! All of the selections were beautiful and tasted amazing! Peruvian potato salad, salted melon salad, Fiji apple salad, the list goes on and on! Of course, I had to try a bit of everything and don't regret that at all! The also offer a ZED dinner and serve house prepared meats table side. I really love their concept of river rocks on the dining tables. At the table, there is a small platter with river rocks and to indicate you would like to be served, you place the river rock near your place at the table. Almost immediately, the chefs brought around steak, lamb, chicken, and fish they had personally prepared and told you about the cut and preparation technique. Not only seeing but hearing about what I was about to eat made it a great experience. Although everything I tried was excellent, my personal favorite was the feral island salmon. It was the best tasting, most wonderfully textured salmon I've ever eaten. Ever.  While dining, one of the chefs visited our table to ensure we were enjoying our meal and talk with us. It was great to see such an emphasis on making sure what they were serving was really providing a quality experience.  Moving on to the dessert, I had their ""house favorite"" as our server called it: butterscotch bread pudding, while my mom chose their banana cream pie. Both were so delicious! And they even personalized my plate for my birthday, which was a nice touch.  Speaking with the manager after our meal just showed again the attention to detail and focus on creating an enjoyable experience everyone on the staff seemed to posses. She mentioned they also offer brunch and I can't wait to return to try it!

2012-08-31,5.0,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while now. I got married in September 2011 and we had our reception here after the wedding in their upstairs private room. We had about 70 guests, some vegetarians, some vegans, and really, they took care of it all. It was probably the least stressful part of planning. We picked out a signature drink to serve for the first few hours and got the wine/beer package for guests to booze on. From the get-go, people were impressed with the classy fire places, the delicious hors'douvres and the unlimited salad bar (which really included so much more than salads). Someone described the biscuits as crack. But when that meat started coming out, I saw people's mouths drop. There's actually quite a funny photo of my husband's cousin gaping at some food. I only wish my adrenaline wasn't so high and my dress wasn't so fitted that I could have pigged out more. We had a pretty modest wedding ceremony, but decided to splurge on this dinner experience and it was worth every penny. The best part was that guests commented on how it was some of the best food they'd had at a wedding.  Since then, I've been back many times to have a great cocktail with some of sophisticated bar snacks. The rooftop is a great place to be in the summer and the fireplaces make it cozy in the winter.

First off, my favorite thing about the restaurant is the service. Our server was Garren, this really friendly guy with a good sense of humor. He knew the menu from all sides and could answer all my questions without needing to ask. All the chefs that come out bearing various meat offerings once you lay your stone out were  also friendly, knowledgable, and a diverse kitchen staff. (all ages, ethnicities, etc). They also taught us proper etiquette for taking the meats from the Kebaps or plates. (which in case you are wondering , the tongs are only used to grab the red meats). The harvest bar was an interesting appetizer bar with soups, breads, small salads, meats and cheeses, etc. definitely try the miso soup with pork belly and the watermelon, arugula, and feta salad. My two favorites. Also delish was the truffle butter with thinly sliced baguette. Mmmm. Unlimited meat that came around was also delish, but go light on the harvest bar if you plan on eating the main courses! The duck and the pork stomach were my favorites.  And, because I'm such a lush, I saved my favorite part of any dining experience for the end - the cocktails. The cocktails here are updated regularly and are creative little twists on everyone's favorites. Fan of vino? Definitely hit this up because their selection is endless. I had the white peach sangria and it was deliciously light and refreshing. Yum. A little sweet for me as I prefer dry wine, but the sangria paired perfectly with my harvest bad selections.",0.9935,0.804,0.181,0.015,0.5800080128205128

The servers are extremely attentive and did a great job explaining how the ZED works. The food was amazing. You start with a buffet that features unique fusion type salads  and gourmet quality meat & cheeses. Afterword, you put a little stone on the table and servers immediately rush to your table with almost every kind of meat you can think of. Steak, Pork, Sausage, Swordfish, Salmon, and a few I can't even remember.

We went during the NRA show in Chicago twice, as we are friendly with the owner and executive chef and we had people, people and people. The first night was amazing, we had some apps at the bar, then we went into the wine room with them and they opened a bottle of amazing champagne... We talked shop and then we (work and clients) got seated... The food kept coming, and coming, and coming, the meats were beyond insanely divine... The theme is - you serve yourself all the heavenly salads and cheeses in the center of the huge restaurant which is a circle and it carries you around, theme wise... breads, olives, figs, vegetables, spreads, amazing. Then, as you sit, each chef that prepared a meat brings it out in these 4 feet tall skewers and carves pieces to you... And they really keep coming... I had some venison that I will never forget... And I dont eat red meat...  oops! Dessert came and I died and went to heaven!  I must upload the pictures of the food as words cannot express the heavenly delights. We came back two nights later with a party of 15 for drinks.  We got red velvet rope service and a server that took care of our group only.  It was a great experience, our clients loved it.... (Towards the end, when I was feelin slizzered, I ordered some apps to slow my alcohol blood flow down, but it was so good, before I looked down at my plate, it was empty!!! - guilty faces around me!)

At first I was about to get a heart attack from the price of $29 a person, but believe me you need to eat smart to make it worth the price. The place is simply gorgeous ! It would elevate anyone's mood ! So our waitress allowed us to start off around the buffet. Go light, and I mean a small teaspoon of each little thing. No need to stuff your plate since that food is going no where and you could always go back for more if you have room in your tummy. Around 5 mins into the salads and light appetizers, they come in and serve 4 random dishes. My friend loved the bacon, and when I meant love, I meant that she refused to share any of it. I like their idea with the usage of stones where the chefs would delightfully bring some of the selections. During this time they served us chicken waffles (first timer for me) Salmon, Beef, and more ! What I love is that we could always order more of what we really liked.  The food was so delicious that we had a second helping of bacon. Too bad we were so full that we couldn't finish, and they don't do to go boxes.  Unclassy side note: My friend really wanted to take the bacon, so I took some paper napkins and wrapped it.

2012-06-24,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants in Chicago. The meal is divided into two parts- the salad/ appetizer bar (a.k.a The Harvest Table), and the meat. The salad bar is phenomenal, it's far from your typical salad bar. It consists of award-winning cheese, cold pasta, asian salad (e.g. veggie with thai dressing), corn chowder, and many more. The trick is to resist eating too much so you can still enjoy the meat.  When you are ready for the meat, put the stones on the table (you'll understand what I mean when you're there) as a signal to the waiter that you're ready. The waiters stroll throughout the restaurant, offering unlimited appetizer-sized portions of different types of meat- from citrus salmon, to grilled rib-eye, to pork belly with rosemary sauce. There are usually at least 8 choices of meat, so again, make sure you don't devour too much at the beginning so you get to try everything.  Zed451 is a lot of fun and a great place to go to for any kind of celebration. The only downside is that if you are going with a big crowd, the wait can be quite long (even if you have made a reservation). The ambiance is elegant and classy. The best thing is you can head to the outdoor rooftop deck for a drink after dinner.

My party had 7 people in it. The only minus which why the four stars and not 5 was that i made a reservation early and may moved it because of nato and then switched it to June. I talked to the hostess Gretchen because I needed to change the time and she assured me we would be fine and we ended up having to wait still about 30 minutes when we got there. They tried to give us the high seated tables and my aunts and parents are older they need to be as close to the ground as possible. wth So my favorite from the harvest table was the Duck Confit Hash Browns and the strawberry salad. I also ate about three red velvet cupcakes. For the entrees. I loved the chicken and waffles, the bottom sirloin, and the roasted turkey. The worst: the corned beef hash, the frittata, and the crab Benedict fell flat for me. The  decor is gorg very peaceful and zen like and relaxing.

They made sure they went to the parents table, and to the table next to them. But continuously skipped ours. We literally waited over 30 minutes for the next meath skewers to come. We asked repeated for the venison, we finally got it after we were served dessert. One of the parents told us that they got it really early on in their meal. :( So sad because it was one of the best ones. never got the wagyu beef, red snapper, or the crab cakes. sigh..  In order of favorites was venison, lamb, pork belly, dont' remember between the beefs, and the duck was my least favorite. I kept asking for meat. I have never been to a brazilian bbq place and left hungry and wanting more meat. I was sad because I thought their food was pretty darn tasty.  One of our waitresses was amazing, remembered my drink and always brought out what we asked for. The other waitress (some chick with short blond hair) was awful, one of my cousins ordered a drink and never received it. She also purposefully slowed down our drink orders and told us we were allowed to only have one drink a person. Then proceeded to count each drink and find out which person had what drink in order for us to order another. I thought that was ridiculous, and then she started to take our drinks away before we were done with us. If we weren't sitting there, our drinks would disappear.

2012-06-05,5.0,"This review is for Sunday brunch only, but I will be coming back for dinner soon! Who doesn't love a good nasty brunching session on a Sunday morning/afternoon??  My husband and I couldn't decide on what to do, given that he likes a brunch buffet format and I just want something with options that incorporate more than eggs and bacon.  After consulting yelp, ZED451 seemed to offer both of us what we wanted.  At $29 a person, its not totally crazy, and with all the good reviews I wasn't too worried about getting our money's worth.  I should also mention they have $3 mimosas and $5 bloody marys. We made reservations at the urging of other yelpers just to be sure we got a table.  Wasn't too busy at 10:30, but it did start to get busy, so I'd say go ahead and hit Open Table before you plan on coming.  The harvest table spread was pretty impressive, but as they tell you, don't go too crazy because the good stuff is only starting.  The stuff they bring to the table was okay, cinnamon roll not as good as it looks, frittatta the same, but the hash was good.  The bacon...oh, the bacon.  Pigs dream of making this bacon one day.  Other bacon wants to be this bacon.  Thick, crispy outside, chewy inside, coated with a spicy sweet dusting of something angel's must make.  Its that good.  Then once you are done with the minor leagues, the big plates start circulating, mind you not in the aggressive way that you expect at a churrascaria where you have a heap on your plate before you have even taken a bite.  They pace everything really well.  The panetone french toast, the chicken and waffles, and the meats are what really stood out.  Its worth saving room for this part of the brunch. Service was very friendly and efficient, and the decor was really zen as someone else mentioned.  All in all, a great place.  We will be back to check out the patio up top and also be taking advantage of the free shuttle when the weather gets bad and we don't want to walk here.  Definitely will be back for brunch, dinner, and roof top drinks!",0.9923,0.746,0.181,0.073,0.49074074074074076

2012-05-22,5.0,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the downtown area of Chicago.  Could it be the meat, meat, and then more meat?  Quite possibly, but the are so many other great things to behold there.  First is the atmosphere.  It just has a great feel.  Dark wood and fireplaces everywhere like an old ski lodge.  The rooftop bar is great! The harvest table has a little of everything.  Lots of flavorful salads and cheeses.  Many of the combinations, I would never think would go together. Like the smoked poblano deviled eggs. The black truffle butter goes great on any of their delicious breads. Another must mention is the duck pastrami. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. The harvest table done, the meat parade begins.  The buttermilk sirloin was probably my favorite, followed closely by amaretto pistachio duck breast and the pork belly.  The lamb deserves mention, but it all was good.  Did I also mention the meats and harvest table are unlimited?  I am not going to do a separate review for the brunch which is equally great, but I will give a shout out to the maple Cajun bacon and corned beef hash with a poached egg. The service has been great every time I have eaten here.  My quick tip would be not to rush, you need a minimum of 2 plus hours to enjoy this feast,  The only bad thing I have to say is that parking can be a pain depending what is going on at the time.",0.9954,0.749,0.209,0.042,0.6296666666666666

2012-05-10,5.0,"This review is also for Brunch only: I agree with a lot of what reviewer Nadia S. stated - so I will try not to be to repetitive.  First off - make sure to make a reservation because the place does get packed.  The decor off the restaurant is very well done - lots of wood on the floors and ceilings.  Giant fire pit in the middle.  It is ""Japanese Garden-esque"" but very modern at the same time.  Cool contrast.  We all started with a $5 bloody mary that is well worth the price.  Spicy, smokey, and deep rich tomato flavor will get your brunch kicked off nicely. You start off with the Harvest Table (buffet) of some really great things - lovely salads (Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad), cheeses, meats (chorizo!), fruits (Apricots are awesome) and the must get Duck Confit Homestyle Potatoes.  Holy moly you could eat a ton of that but don't because you are just getting started with the meal. Next - the table gets a serving of Corned Beef Hash with a poached egg on top, Maple Cajun Bacon, Tomato Basil Fritata and a giant Cinnamon Roll.  The fritata was bland and tasteless - the only thing not worth eating in the meal.  On the other end the hash was awesome with the runny egg yolk.  OMG! And THEN the ""chefs"" start bringing the skewered and specialty items to your table.  Best things for me out of that lot were the Maple Bourbon Glazed Ham, Flank steak,  and Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  But other people in the group really enjoyed the French toast, Citrus dusted Atlantic Salmon and the Roasted Turkey Breast.  The Buffalo chicken and waffles was just a little weird for the group - but it was still tasty.  Everyone in the group had a different favorite.  There is enough variety in the main course selections to cover a wide range of palettes. And there are a few more meats I haven't listed.  And it's all you can eat.  And let me tell you by the time you are done trying everything the first time around you don't have room to do a round two. And to finish it off they have some very good chocolate chip cookies back up at the Harvest Table.  Ugh... tummy starting to hurt again just thinking about it.... ;) Service was excellent as well.  The main waiter constantly checked in on us to see if there was anything we missed or wanted to try again.  And when we mentioned to her we really loved the apricots she ran back into the kitchen and wrote down the recipe for us to take home.

Enter me complaining to Aaron S. about having to be at work at eight am on Easter Sunday. Well Aaron S. got all sneaky and made brunch reservations for us here the morning before at ten am. Really? We never do brunch together, so I was excited.  We arrived in time to watch the doors be unlocked. We notice how big the place looks from the outside. Walked in and realized it's just as huge on the inside. I loved how open everything was, the wood everywhere. There were at least three fireplaces that I counted. There could have been more, we only really saw one small area of the place.  We sat down and the extremely friendly host explains the harvest tables and says that there will also be some small plates brought out to us, and whenever we were ready we can take our stones and take part in the food going around to the tables.  After taking our drink orders she let us know we could head over to the harvest tables and get what we wanted while we waiting for them to bring our the table food. I was really really impressed with the selection they had out. A salad table, a table with various fruits, a cured meat, cheese, and bread table, then one more table that had the duck confiet home fries and steal cut vanilla oatmeal. Also a dessert table. It was really an impressive spread of stuff. I tried a good hunk of it. I loved the aged cheddar, the chorizo, the cheddar rolls with tangerine butter. Yes TANGERINE BUTTER. It was delectable. The duck confiet home fries were pretty much one of the the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Soft tender salty potatoes with tender pieces of duck meat all throughout, and perfectly caramelized onions thrown in. So good. The oatmeal was also really nice. The vanilla was very subtle but very good. I added all the mix ins too.  The table items were also fantastic especially the thick cut and crisp Maple Cajun bacon. I think we got three orders of it. It was some of the best bacon I ever tasted. I am drooling thinking of that now. Then the Corned beef hast with a perfect poached egg on top. It was super good. There was a fritata too. Which I have to admit in the grand scheme of things didn't really stand out. A huge Cinnamon bun which stayed very warm for a shockingly long time had to be the cast iron pan they baked it in and sat in on the table.  As for the items that were going around? I think we tried it all. I really really loved the chicken and waffles. It was a mini waffle soaked with maple syrup, and atop sat a perfectly fried buffalo chicken breast. It sounds like an odd combination but it was so very tasty. The buttermilk sirloin was so tender it was melt in your mouth. The crab cake with a poached egg on top was very rich and the crab was so fresh tasting. It was all really good. I was way too full to even try the deserts.

We went during Restaurant Week but decided to go with the full menu.  Unfortunately for half of our meal, they had mistakenly marked down that we wanted the limited menu, so we were getting skipped on half the good stuff!  After noticing this, they profusely apologized and a sudden rush of servers hit our table.  The one thing I did really miss though from Fogo de Chao and other Brazillian-style churrascarias is the pan de quejao. The little muffin things here were....underwhelming.  And the foccacia from the bar was good, but a variety would be nice. And last but not least, dessert.  I ordered the Bread Pudding a la mode and my wife got the Banana Cream Pie.  I won. The Bread pudding was amazing.  And I have tried looots of bread puddings.  Perfect consistency, with a beautiful blend of sweetness and creaminess without being cloying. Glad I added the a la mode.

2012-04-07,5.0,"I need to start this review off with an apology. Mouth - I'm so very sorry.  I simply can't always give you such incredibly delicious things like what we shared today.  You'll have to make do with what I give you until we're able to go back for another brunch at ZED451. It started when I realized my girlfriend would be stuck working Easter morning, and we wouldn't be able to have Easter Brunch.  I did some searching and picked ZED451 for a little ""prEaster Brunch"", because they do a Brunch Buffet on Saturdays as well (from 10am to 2pm).  Went to OpenTable and made a reservation for 2 at 10am, just in case they were busy. We arrived in time to watch them unlock the doors.  We were shown to our table and had full run of the house for 15 minutes while they finished setting up the buffet stations and eventually another group would be entering. Our server Karen was fabulous, explaining everything to us as first-timers and follow-up conversation throughout the meal.  She was one of the best soda-refiller attendants I've ever had, though I suggest that a larger glass would have meant much fewer needs to refill.  Basically, ZED451 is set in the style of a churrascaria (if you've been to one).  There is a salad bar (called ""Harvest Tables"" here) where you have a lovely pick of salads, charcuterie, and the like.  There is a set of ""table plate"" side dishes that they bring out and refill when you run out.  And there is a token that signals the serving staff to stop by your table with their delicious wares for you to grab - or to stop harassing your table for the time being and let you eat your grabbed delicious wares.  At churrascarias, it's a round token you flip on a red side or green side.  Here, it's a bowl with stones, and you place your stone by your plate for service and back in the bowl to ""turn off the meat faucet"" - as I like to say. So where to begin?  The Harvest Tables were our first stop.  Of the 5 stations, one was covered in fresh fruits (ho hum).  One was full of tiny desserts (not yet).  One was full of salads, salad-type dishes, and vegetables (yawn).  Then there's the charcuterie station, which featured a delicious aged white cheddar, interesting cured meats, and these cheddar-buttermilk biscuits with TANGERINE BUTTER.  I never thought I'd ever encounter such an odd-sounding item.  But it was insanely good.  INSANE.  And speaking of which, the last station featured vanilla steel-cut oatmeal and DUCK CONFIT HOME FRIES.  ""What"", ""the"" and ""hell"" were my exact words - as I spooned the duck and potato mixture onto what remained of the space on my plate.  It was fab-yoo-lous.  All three times I grabbed some. But before digging into my salad bar plate, the table side dishes had arrived, and interrupted any thought at all of my duck-tatoes.  Because just beyond the fritata, and past the poached egg and corned beef hash, and over beside the giant cinnamon bun - there was a small pan full of MAPLE CAJUN BACON. It was my first bite at ZED451, and I made sure it was also my last bite an hour and a half later (on our third or fourth helping that was brought out). I could write eight pages on how delicious every individual item listed so far was.  But I don't need to.  I wouldn't be giving ZED451 a 5-star rating if I felt I needed to ""win you over"".  ""Tangerine butter"", ""duck confit home fries"" and ""maple cajun bacon"" don't have to tell you they're awesome - they're already awesome and they don't care who knows it. Which is good, because I need to move right on to the ""meat faucet"" portion of the meal. Homemade sausage w/ honey mustard.  Citrus-dusted salmon.  Buttermilk herb bottom sirloin.  Panettone French toast. These are the things they brought for us to eat that I don't even feel like wasting words to describe to you.  Because they need to be saved for two of the best dishes: Chicken 'n Waffles: It's NOT what you'd think, actually.  Well it IS, but it's BETTER than that.  It's a miniature Belgian waffle, brimming in every hole with maple syrup.  And perched on top was the crispy chicken.  But this was not a ""standard fried chicken"".  This was BUFFALO-style chicken.  A fabulously-flavored hunk of meat atop a fluffy-syrupy doughy treat.  The combination left me...  staggering to think of any other thought beyond ""I need another bite of this"", even to the point when it was finished and I was craning my neck to see if the Chicken 'n Waffle Man was lurking anywhere nearby to give me another. Crab Cake Benedict: It's a meaty, delicious crab cake - that alone should be enough.  But no, they topped it with a perfectly-poached egg.  And then, the obvious Hollandaise sauce drizzled on top.  This was the item that had me mentally jotting down the actual apology written at the start of this review.  I knew that anything beyond this item for the rest of the meal, day, week, would simply not compare. But as I mentioned, I finished with more Maple Cajun Bacon.  Sorry, mouth.  We WILL be back.  I promise.",0.9929,0.882,0.088,0.03,0.49640313390313406

Also impressive was that our water glasses remained full throughout the meal, even though they were itty bitty and had to be less than 12 oz.

Zed451 brought all of my palate back in one evening. Their cocktails are fantastic and inventive, especially the cranberry old fashioned (the bourbon lemonade is great too). The service is unbeatable-- the (sous-)chefs who present the meats really do make them in the kitchen! And their pastry chef deserves awards... Try their peanut butter and jelly ice cream. Even if you don't have room, this is impossible to regret. Everyone here is impossibly friendly and knowledgeable and good at what they do... They even made me a special tofu and vegetable skewer when I was just planning to indulge without remorse on the harvest table. Don't pass up a chance to come here, and if it's nice enough to grab a drink on the rooftop, DO IT. It's absolutely gorgeous up there.",0.9905,0.8,0.175,0.025,0.5617216117216116
2012-03-28,4.0,"This review is for Zed451's brunch, my favorite in the City!  At $29 (previously $24), my initial reaction was that it wouldn't be worth it.  Rest assured - you'll get your money's worth and more!  There's something for everyone here, and you'll eat enough for your next two meals.  And, at $3 and $5, the Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are a bargain.   The Harvest Table offers an assortment of fresh, unique salads as well as cheeses and charcuterie.  Be selective here or you won't have room for the other courses! The waiters then bring out unlimited amounts of several dishes, my favorites being the cinnamon buns and bacon.  A couple are egg-based, and the fried chicken and waffle seems to be a staple. If you're not full yet, you then have the option to try the traditional Brazilian meats (similar to dinner, I imagine). I've never had any room remaining to visit the dessert table after all of these courses, but there is a decent-sized spread. My only complaints are that they can't substitute or omit ingredients in the standard dishes as they're pre-made, and sometimes the same dishes are offered repeatedly, while others never come around.  In fact, we've wrapped up our meal only to realize that we weren't offered some of the dishes. So be sure to ask your waiter if you've seen everything.   Don't plan on eating any meals the rest of the day!",0.6828,0.906,0.061,0.034,0.4835858585858586

2012-03-08,4.0,I was never a big fan of Brazilian steakhouses and thought it'd just be too much meat and thought I would never enjoy anything there. My ZED451 experience tonight changed my mind. I didn't know what to expect going to ZED and started with some soup and salad from the bar. The food from the bar was not like any salad bar. The food was nicely presented and properly heated (and of course they were delicious). Then the meat started coming around and I had the Moroccan Chicken first. I never liked chicken breasts because they were always too dry but this chicken was very very moist. The honey and ginger sauce covering the chicken gives it a really nice taste. The rest of the dinner continued to surprise me.  Food that I had and really enjoyed tonight:  - Tomato Bisque (Market Soups)  - Fire Roasted Vegetables  - Asian Pork Belly  - Hardwood Grilled Citrus Wild Salmon  - Moroccan Chicken  - Pork Sausage with horseradish honey mustard Definitely will return.

2012-02-28,5.0,So glad that my first review can be to one of the best restaraunts in Chicago. I took a very special person here for their birthday and it was absolutely amazing. We started with a wine and food pairing in the all glass champagne and wine room. The chefs really knew how to compliment cheeses and meats to their red and white wine selection. After the mini tasting we were escorted to our table. We started with the winter harvest tables. What a selection! There were so many different salads meats breads fruits to choose from that there was no way we would be able to try everything in one trip. Throughout the experience our server kept bringing us little goodies. Our favorite was the mini stuffed red peppers! When it was time for our meat selections we were excited. Chefs came table side similar to a brazzilian steak house except the variety was much more than steaks. We tried all the different chicken salmon ribs and pork. Our tastebuds were overwhelmed with the different flavors and food combinations. Though we thought we couldn't bear dessert our server brought us the s'mores cake... ummmm Aaaamazing! The price was high but I left feeling no regret. The food was the best I have ever experienced and the service was impeccable.

2012-02-27,5.0,"My boyfriend wanted to go to a Brazilian steakhouse for his birthday and after talking to a friend of ours we settled on ZED451 over Fogo and Brazazz. Honestly we chose not to go to Brazazz simply because of their 18 or so cuts only 6 were available at dinner and we wanted more variety.   The ambiance was lovely and not too loud like most restaurants. The drinks were good, but I would suggest staying away from the Fallen Pear martini. It tastes like Thanksgiving in a glass and not in a good way. My dirty martini and the sangria were fantastic though so it wasn't a total loss. Our table was in the middle of the salad bar next to the fire, which was quite nice. We had easy access to all the deliciousness (the cream of mushroom soup was surprisingly stellar) and we had chefs at our table very consinstently bringing a different cut of meat/chicken/fish. The server was great, she was always checking on us making sure we were doing well and whether we needed more bevs. Basically we had an almost perfect night out thanks to ZED451 and I would definitely go back for more.",0.9901,0.688,0.233,0.079,0.5807172251616696

The buttermilk biscuits with melted cheese on top with the side of tangerine butter was surprisingly delicious. Putting so much attention into something so simple was a nice touch. Then servers running around with skewered farro salmon, buttermilk ranch sirloin and Moroccan chicken threw down piece after piece upon our plates. My boyfriend, Jeff got called out by our server for doing the happy food dance and that was even before dessert! Dessert. Oh. Dear. God.

2012-02-25,3.0,"I want to start off by saying that I struggled a bit with this rating. I have been here now on two occassions, each a completely different event/experience, and they both had their merits. However, when it comes down to the food, I had to go with 3 stars because I have simply had better at Brazzaz and Fogo de Chao. The first time we came here was for NYE. This was a wonderful New Years experience and I highly recommend it. You really cant beat the price on this particular night out in Chicago, and the drinks were top notch! The energy was great on NYE, and there were plenty of people, but the the place never felt overcrowded nor did we ever have to wait for a drink. They offered fun cocktails and passed apps (plus champagne), and the bartenders were awesome!! Definitely 4/5 stars! I also came here last week for restaurant week. We had about 8 girls, and our server was really nice. However, I just didnt think the salad and food bars were that great. The cheeses and breads were awesome, but I wasnt too impressed with the soups or with the mixed sides. The meats were okay, but because it was restaurant week, we were only offered 3 choices. The salmon was by far my favorite, it was cooked perfectly. The moroccan chicken like thing was good, but it was an interesting choice of flavoring for me at this type of joint. I initially liked the setup of the long tables extending from the central fire pit, but partially through the meal our guests who were seated close to this were extremely warm from the fire pounding on one side of their face the whole night. Overall, I still like the vibe of this place and I'll most likely try the rooftop when it gets warmer.",0.9969,0.744,0.225,0.031,0.5901029087871192

2012-02-17,5.0,"One of the BEST BRUNCHES I have ever experienced!! We didn't make reservations and the tables were filling up when we arrived. The hostess suggested that we sit in the ""kitchen"" and said that we would see that it can be kind of fun to watch some of the action.  The seat was actually at a bar overlooking the final stages of the food preparation and was the COZIEST spot.  Every chef made a point to chat with us and tell us about what they were preparing and gave us the first dibs on everything.  We ended up having a great conversation with the head chef who couldn't have been nicer.  Our server was knowledgable and accomodating and as good as it gets. That is just the service...the food?? Oh my goodness, the food was amazing.  There is a buffet (well 4 of them) with all kinds of wonderful meats, cheeses, vegetables prepared in different ways, fruits and ridiculous desserts... but after you've gathered these things, you sit back down and your server brings a frittata, corned beef hash, an absurd cinnamon bun, the most insane brown sugar/maple syrup bacon you've ever tasted and more. Then, on top of all of this, you're given an endless selection of any kind of meat you could possibly desire.  What I have just described is all $24/person... WHAT!!! The bloody marys are only $5 a piece during brunch as well. We were literally giggling by the end of the meal that we just happened into the most wonderful brunch of our lives and couldn't have been more full and content.  (To top it off, there was a woman that stopped by our table and gave us a gift card she couldn't use -- THANK YOU, that was so sweet!)  As a River North resident, I have to comment ZED451 as being the BEST in River North!

Table not quite ready yet?  No worries, you can sip on a drink in the nice lounge while you wait...maybe even catch some of the Bulls or Hawks game.  Beer drinkers, try the Left Hand, milk stout...excellent. The Chef's Counter.  You an inquire for seating at the Chef's Counter when you make your reservation.  The really good thing about it is you can pretty much tell the chef what you want and he'll get someone to pull it off the pit and bring it to you RIGHT AWAY.  The really bad thing about it, in my opinion, the pit is right there!  So it might get hot, especially after a few drinks haha.  I'd rather be comfortable while I eat so probably no more Chef's Counter for me. I wasn't too impressed with the food at the ""Harvest Table"" but I didn't really go there for the little fillers as I'd call them.  The place is much like other Brazilian steakhouses, but ZED has a much larger selection of meats (& other ""meats"").  You definitely, MUST MUST MUST had some bottom sirloin (they marinate it for 48 hrs!!!), pork belly & catfish (I was surprised by the catfish).  As a matter of fact, if/when I return here, I'll probably take the Chef's advice and just tell them to bring me out a plate of each! hahaha!  The other options are all good and if it's your first time here, you might as well try them out I supposed but the three I listed are the best in my opinion.  Just remember, pace yourself! Against my suggestion, we had the creme brulee for dessert but it was good. The setting was a nice, really calm, music not too loud.  The service was pretty good as well.  They're always ready to answer your questions or make suggestions.  It did kind of suck that the bathrooms were on the second floor though (unless we didn't know about ones on the first) because it's hard to climb stairs when you're stuffed! haha!",0.9957,0.725,0.202,0.073,0.5516379601485984

Picked us up at our friend's apartment, and dropped us back off again after our meal. When we called for the shuttle, we said we had 8:30 reservations and the shuttle was outside at 8:15, waiting for us. Didn't have to wait! Also didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes for the return trip. 2) The food. Lots of variety for all walks of life at the harvest tables (5 tables of gourmet salads, house-made truffle butter, house-made focaccia, cheeses, meats, sides, and appetizers ranging from a bean salad with duck compote, to a veggie pad thai, to penne puttanesca, to sauteed wild mushrooms, etc.). The actual meats that come by are very good as well, although the red meats are pretty rare-medium rare. So I mostly stuck to the salmon, chicken, duck, and venison. With some end pieces of sirloin thrown in since those are the most cooked parts. Bread pudding for dessert was great, the triple chocolate mousse was just ok... wouldn't spend $10 on that again.  3) The ambiance. Very low light inside, which made for an intimate experience. You hardly notice the tables of 10+ people to your left and right.  The inbetween:  1) Service. Got a wide range here. The host was ok enough... we had to wait around for almost 45 minutes at the bar for our table, even though we had a reservation and the place didn't seem that busy. There wasn't a line of people waiting or anything. Not sure what the hold up was. Our waitress was also extremely nice, but very slow. She would leave us hanging when we had questions (they ran out of the mushrooms :( the kitchen actually ran out!) or needed fresh plates. It also took quite some time for our bill even after clearing dinner plates and after eating our desserts. But the other random servers running around (not waiters or waitresses, but more like support staff) were excellent. Constantly refiling your drinks and bringing new napkins, etc. Never said a word to us since they are probably meant to be like background music, but still, extremely attentive nonetheless and made up for our near absent waitress. The annoying: 1) The bathroom. Unisex and oddly placed. The speaker is literally right over your head while washing your hands and Rihanna was blasted into my ears. I don't know why they need to make the music so loud?  Overall, great place for carnivores and I would return. Good for a relaxing, long meal if you have no place to be (since you can easily spend 2-3 hours eating dinner here!).

A few weeks back the BF and I were stuck downtown during the fluke snowstorm that had all melted a day later, and hailing a cab was a big problem.  We wanted to go out for a nice dinner, having been downtown all weekend.  Answer?  Call the ZEDbus!  Seriously.  They busted through slushy roads across town to pick us up and bring us to the restaurant (free of charge!) The atmosphere is fantastic.  Modern, yet rustic.  I immediately fell in love with the clean lines and natural finishes.  The music fit the décor.  The fireplace in the center of the harvest table was mesmerizing.  The fireplace upstairs near the bathroom...

I didn't eat anything that I didn't love.  The harvest table selections were all delicious, and a large variety of options.  All of the protein selections were perfect, there was one piece of meat that was very very rare (almost blue) but the flavor was still excellent, just a little under for our taste. My favorite part was that the proteins weren't all MEATS.  There were three different types of fish, a duck and chicken option as well as several different cuts of beef.  The fact that many of the proteins came with accompanying sauces or chimmichurri just made it even better.

2011-12-26,4.0,"My husband and I got married on July 10, 2011 and had our ceremony and reception for about 80 people at Zed. Since the first day we mentioned via email that we wanted to have our wedding there, there were nothing but positive feedback and invitations to come and try what they offered. We were able to enjoy a complimentary brunch on our private time thanks to the manager that offered to cover our bill when we said we would have our wedding there. During our tasting, we enjoyed the drinks and food that would be provided at the buffet area, as well as all TWELVE meats that would be passed Brazilian style for our guests.  Overall, we can not complain about the service and the location. We did not have to decorate much. We only had to provide centerpieces and tablecloths in order for the place to get a full wedding look. All of the guests enjoyed the architecture, and how intimate of a feel we had throughout our entire event.  The manager and event planner, Sammy Ojeda, were present at the event until we left and extended their appreciation by offering complimentary items on our bill. We did not give them 5 stars because the email responses sometimes were delayed, but always asked to be excused for this. Also, it was EXTREMELY warm. I understand it was an 85 degree day and there were lots of people, but I think they should have turned on the A/C a lot earlier and higher when it was empty. Also, I had stated for them to set up the tables and decor while our wedding party had left with us to take pictures in the city and allow people to start eating since we didn't have photographers/videographers all night and because it was so warm on the rooftop during cocktail hour. When we returned from pictures, they still hadn't finished setting up (an hour later) and people were still outside in the extreme heat and humidity. I understand it might have taken a long time to setup and make sure everything was in place before allowing people to come in. They also went out of their way to set up table name cards on stands and tables that I had not don't prior to the wedding day.  We believe that at weddings people always criticize the food first, then everything else. Zed makes sure there is a high quality and quantity of everything they offer. There was a variety of appetizers, entrees and soups there at an incredibly reasonable price. The waiters, manager and maitre d were outstanding with catering to each one of our wants and needs.  Our family and friends continue to boast with us and others about how it has been one of the best weddings they have ever attended. They enjoyed having different environments to talk or dance. They loved the Chicago style rooftop outside to be able to chat at a normal volume and having a dance floor if they were in the mood to dance inside.

Not the best I've ever had but probably the best I've ever had for $5. Probably one of the better I've had for $10 which is the normal price. Its a 1/2 lber with cheese, and they offer a variety of cheese to choose from, and bacon and lettuce and tomatoes and pickles on a pretzel bun. My only issue with it was that juices weren't dripping from it while I was eating. It was well seasoned however and cooked to my request- medium rare. The accompanying fries were almost shoe-string thin, crispy, and also well seasoned.  The beer selection is great. No bud or miller lites that liter the limited offerings of other bars.

It's trendy but mellow at the same time.  The harvest table area is amazing. Our waitress told us that the items on the table are all made on-site and are seasonal. When we were there, they had a tuna crudo situation that brought the happy. The various salads, fruits and cheeses were all splendid. Their deviled eggs, however, are something I could go back for over and over.  They also bring you hot cheddar biscuits with tangerine butter. Eat the heck out of this, and then let them bring you more.  Then, the meats. Oh, the meats. My favorites were the waygu beef, the scallops and the smoked sausage. The chefs who prepare the meat are the ones who bring them to your table (making it mildly awkward to turn down any of their offerings). They explain the cooking methods and cut things up and put 'em down on your plate for you. They'll keep coming back to you until you're so full that you beg them to stop.

2011-11-20,3.0,"Finally got the chance to eat here last night and had I been a ginormous meat eater, this place would be getting a 4 or 5 star from me on this review! To begin with, the bar and restaurant are very pretty.  The restaurant is a little too well lit for my liking, but still pretty none the less.  The bartenders are extremely nice and friendly.  The bar area is spacious enough to accommodate many people waiting for tables AND other people just having drinks.  Huge plus from me on that as so many restaurant's bars are overly crowded at dinner time! So, 2 big things keep me from giving this place 4 or 5 stars and it's not the food or the service:  1)  I am not a vegetarian, but not a big meat eater.  This place is meat centric.  2)  This place is pricey at $48/person and dessert and true sides are not included.  I don't know many people who could actually eat enough of the meat to actually warrant that price!!!  Let me explain.  You don't get all of the food and meat at once.  You are instructed to go over to the buffet style area to get your choosing of such things as antipasto, cheeses, breads, veggies, salads, etc.  You can have your fill of any of this.  Then, once you are finished with that portion, you place a stone on the table and the meat chefs come around to carve meat of your choosing for you.  The meats are spaced equally apart in timing.  Meaning, you are able to finish one piece of meat before another choice arrives to your table.  Humans are more likely to overeat when all of the food is placed in front of them at once and they don't have time for their stomach to tell their brain to stop eating.  This whole process at this restaurant has you filling up before you barely begin on the meats!!!  Brilliant on the part of the restaurant!!! With that said, everything else was spot on!  The food was very, very, very good!  I had the opportunity to try some things I have never tried before due to not wanting to have to order an entire dish.  One thing I fell in love with that I have not had before was the catfish...yum yum and yum!!!  Also, to begin with, they bring around cheesy buttermilk biscuits.  OMG!!!  I requested that these be kept as far away from me on the table...very hard to resist!!!  The service was unbelievable!!!  Our waiter Jacob was excellent with our table and so friendly!!!  All of the meat chefs that came around were great.  A lady even stopped by my table when she saw my plate clean and untouched at the beginning.  She was just checking to make sure  I was okay and that something wasn't wrong with the food.  I was just not interested in the meats that had come around so far.  Pretty awesome if you ask me.  Shows they are paying attention and on top of things!  Something did occur that I am sure would have been translated into a low rating by other reviewers, but the way it was handled made it almost non important in my book.  During dinner, I took a sip of my drink through the straw and felt something rather large and hard come up with the liquid.  It seemed like a piece of ice at first, but I soon realized it wasn't cold.  Thank God I realized that before deciding to bite down on it or swallow because it was a very long sliver of glass!!!  Our waiter or one of the chefs was at our table when this happened and saw the incident.  My glass was whisked right away and a manager came over within 1-2 minutes to apologize profusely.  She assured me that the ice thingy would be cleaned out and then they brought me a fresh and glass free drink. Our meal was kind of expensive...$614 for 6 people.  The restaurant took one of my drinks off for the glass incident.  However, one of the other people in our party felt that glass incident was more of a big deal than I did and she got them to agree to another drink taken off.  They didn't have to do that, but I appreciate that they did!!! I doubt I would return to Zed451 for food, but definitely will for drinks and the rooftop.  That is, unless they reduce their price...I would pay $25-$30/person for the same experience again.",0.9988,0.817,0.155,0.029,0.5824404761904763

Loves:  -Cinnamin Rolls (if you have a sweet tooth) -Salmon (SERVED RAW) - - Ignore the ""(VERY fishy)"" ignorance below -All the meat ranging from chicken, pork belly, filet migon, duck, shark -Crab cakes -All the fish: white fish, salmon, ahi tuna -Cheese selection The Menu/Entrees change frequently so check out the website before going and love food with an open mind.  There is so much to choose from that I will doubt you'll leave unsatisfied. (If you do, get off yelp b/c you obviously don't like food) -----My service has always been great here.  Always welcoming and friendly and caters to needs (not like there are any given the entrees come to you and you go get your own sides).  - -  (Once again) Ignore the ""we either served ourselves or had the guys with the meat service slicing things for us."" from below. Because A) YOU DO SERVE YOURSELF and B) THE GUYS W/ THE MEAT ARE SUPPOSE TO SLICE THINGS FOR YOU. :o)  Cheers!",0.9913,0.774,0.171,0.055,0.5620192307692308

The good stuff: the cinnamon rolls, the hash, the cheese selection, the ranch-marinated beef, the turkey and a few of the salads. The eh: the salmon (VERY fishy), the buffalo chicken and waffles (good separately, not so much together) and the frittata. The service was not very good.  The place wasn't crowded and we either served ourselves or had the guys with the meat service slicing things for us.  Not sure why it took our waiter 20 minutes to bring coffee, more mimosas, etc. every time we requested something.",0.9238,0.855,0.117,0.028,0.4933618233618233

On top of that we waited over an 1h and 20m for hour food and between that time never came by to check on us on drinks nor update us. We order simple items off the menu like salad and flat breads.  When the food finally arrived it was half wrong, some were so cold we had to send them back and he forgot one dish completely.  One of the girls got her food after everyone was done. We did speak to a manager during the meal because of how frustrating it was and for the bride to be on her special day and they comped a lot of food however, it was very apparent that he was given a talking to he was even more upset.  After the manager spoke to him he became over nice and sarcastic purposely forgetting drinks of some girls on the table and then making comments such as ""I'm sorry I must have gotten busy and forgot your drink"" showing his frustration and how upset he was.

2011-09-25,4.0,"I've been here for dinners before but never brunch until now. It's no longer 24 dollars, it's 29 dollars for the buffet which is just fine because it's worth it! My other pick was Tavern on Rush for brunch but glad I went with this one instead. That's right. I pick where we go in this relationship. Lol jk. Actually no I'm not.  Even though we had reservations at 10, they don't seat for brunch until 10:05. This is the perfect place for a relaxed, low key brunch. With no crowds nor bright lighting, it's perfect for any hangovers or general grumpy morning moods when you need to ease slowly into starting your day. Even when we left before noon, it was still not even that busy.  Their bacon is fucking AMAZING. And I usually don't care for regular bacon cuz it's too salty and smoky. Yeah I said that. Theirs is sweet, not too salty- perfection. We wanted seconds! Our server was Mark and he was fantastic, attentive enough and witty. We start off at their harvest selection- I love the veggies and duck confit potatoes. I had a second plate of that it was so good! You can skip out on the french toast cuz it's not all that and a total waste of stomach space if you ask me. Then they come around with these little mini cutesy servings of fritattas, bacon, cinnamon rolls (mine are better cuz mine are softer and fluffier, theirs felt under done in the middle like the dough was still a tad gooey and the outside was hard, mama don't play that), and corned beef hash. Then when you're ready, you whip out those rocks baby and let the entrees come. We had pretty much everything- chicken and waffles which their version was a buffalo chicken filet on top of a waffle. Crab cake eggs benedict, portugese sausage, salmon, bottom sirloin (rare) yum- it's so tender. I said nay to the turkey. Then my friend and I thought we should make it a wrap and get dessert and go shopping. We had a plate full of their miniature desserts; red velevet cupcake, rasberry cheesecake, passionfruit tart, dulche de leche chocolate bars (those were really good). All washed down with mimosas. I wish I had more room for their bloody mary but I just couldn't. Next time and believe me, there will be a next time. This is now my favorite brunch place and I'm not even that big of a fan of brunches! It hurts a little to walk all over shopping but it's an excellent way to start your morning. Love. It. You'll be full all day my friend, ALL DAY.

So this is not intended to address the regular menu or service. What I can say from the experience is that the rooftop environs are pretty luxurious. What is nice is you are only a few floors up, so the surrounding buildings provided a kind of concrete and steel forest around you. Not the same as a big view from may stories up, but still very pleasant, with night lights and sampling of Chicago architecture. And the layout, the furnishings, the outdoor fireplace made for easy mingling on a cool night. The staff who served us were really gracious and polite. The food items I got to sample were appetizers, flatbreads and desserts. The appetizers were fine. Nothing to write home about. But the flatbreads were really flavorful with the cheeses, mushrooms and veggies they used. The desserts (served in little tall chunks in the shape of the Aon building) were phenomenal little bursts of sweetness and intense flavors. Try the samore concoction sometime. I could have devoured the entire tray. I did poke my head into the bar and dining areas and was impressed with the size and decor. I was expecting something narrower and smaller, perhaps because of its tiny name. But this would be a great spot to meet friends or colleagues for drinks and ""snibbles"", or  to bring out-of-towners to impress. On this occasion, it was free; so natch, a good value.

Last time the girlfriend and I brought a couple from Louisiana. Needless to say they were a little baffled at the way we do things up here.  The decor is superb. Modern yet comfortable. Great seating arrangements around some interesting architecture. The lighting is comfortable for a dinner setting and does not leave you squinting to see your company. They were actually filming a  match.com  date when we were there, so that may have helped with the lighting.  The food was great. I arrived late and had to catch up as everyone was finishing up with the meats. The salad bar was filled with multiple selections of vegetables, sides, and everything you could want in an upscale salad bar.  When the meat came I was so happy. Definitely the best part of the meal. Great cuts of meat, and a lot of different options in case you aren't strictly in a beefy mood. The habenero glazed chicken and the ribeye definitely were the best. The only problem was getting one of everything. I felt bad, but I kept flagging down the same guy to try and get the last few samples I had yet to try. Took about 15 minutes, but I finally got them and was satisfied.

It's not a bad concept since there really isn't a trendy, chic brazilian steak place.  I like the place and will come back, but would recommend that they ""BEEF"" up their menu....literally.",0.9951,0.763,0.221,0.016,0.584126984126984
2011-08-24,4.0,"If you want a quiet, upscale place to have brunch, then you definitely need to check out Zed451.  I've been hearing about how great this place is for brunch and every now and then I need a break from the ""same-old, same-old,"" and I want to don a nice outfit instead of peeling my jeans off the bedroom floor and heading out to nearby diner for Sunday brunch.  This isn't the kind of place that you're likely to go often for brunch, that is, unless you enjoy spending $29 for all-you-can-eat brunch on the regular. Add in a couple of bloody marys or mimosas, tax/tip, and you're looking at $50/person.  We purposely timed our visit so that this all-you-can-eat extravaganza would be our only meal that day, so, not too early that we'd be hungry later and not too late that we'd starve all morning either.  Instead we eased into it, starting with mimosas and bloody marys, both specially priced at a reasonable $5 for the bloody and $3 for the mimosa. The mimosa was in fact cheaper than just ordering a glass of fresh-squeezed oj, which was priced at $4. The mimosa could have used a touch more champagne because it was kind of weak, but for $3, I couldn't really complain, especially when the juice was so fresh and delicious. The bloody mary was pretty spicy and came with a skewer of salami, peppa dew pepper, and a big chunk of maple-cajun bacon (which I'll rave about later). These were both first-rate brunch drinks, and priced to sell. And sell they did. I lost count of how many I had.  The server came by and gave us the shpiel of how everything worked (which is pretty much the same as every other Brazilian steakhouse on the planet). They bring you a few items from the kitchen and you're free to start grazing at the harvest table, which features cheeses, fruit, charcuterie, salads, duck confit potatoes, panettone French toast, and lots of other stuff I'm probably forgetting. But suffice it to say that there's plenty of stuff. But don't go crazy and overload your plate; you'll want to save room for all that's going to come.  We were brought out cinnamon rolls in a little skillet (so cute), a mini tomato-basil frittata, corned beef hash with poached eggs, and maple-cajun bacon. All of it was great, but the frittata really stood out --it was more souffle-like than any frittata I've had; they probably used more egg whites than yolks, but whatever they did it was fantastic. The poached egg was perfect (no easy feat if you ask me) and the hash was nice and chunky (I hate when it's the consistency of baby food).  There are really no words that can adequately describe the maple cajun bacon. It was crisp, it was sweet, it was spicy, it was made of all that's good in the world. I've been dreaming of that bacon for three days.  Next you move on to the meat-a-palooza. Instead of discs or chips that you flip over when you're ready, their thing is rocks. You set the rock next to your plate which is the signal for the meat fest to begin. Before long, little meat fairies began to appear at our table, bearing gifts.  Linguica sausage, ranch-dressing marinated bottom sirloin (it sounded weird to me too at first but it was really good), perfectly roasted turkey breast with cranberry sauce, bourbon glazed ham, crab cake benedict, and my favorite, the buffalo chicken and waffles.  Everything was terrific and we ate until we could eat no more. And we drank until our heart's content.  Service was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the meat fairies were mostly fun and engaging --when you could track them down, but on several occasions, they passed right by our table without stopping to see if we wanted any of their offerings (and believe you me, we did), so we had to be a little aggressive in order to be able to try everything. Our main server was good, but she probably could have sold us at least another round of drinks if she'd been watching our table better.  Overall, it was a great brunch and I'll for sure go back. Again, it's not a ""regular"" brunch spot (unless you're a baller), but for special occasions or when you just want to ""change it up,"" it's more than worth it. 3.5 stars.",0.9986,0.799,0.16,0.042,0.5429048167812214

The restaurant has a slightly organic, outdoorsy feel with heavy wood accents, dark.  The space is clean and rustic with modern and unique fireplaces through out the restaurant.   Our waitress was helpful and attentive, clearly explaining the process at ZED451.  She did an excellent job of recommending and pointing out their best dishes.  The set-up of ZED451 is like that of a Brazilian steakhouse, where it is pretty much unlimited/""all-you-can-eat.""  I went for the Brunch, which is quite a deal for 29.00- you have choices of premium meats and ""Harvest Table"" offerings.   You start with the Harvest Table with a large selection of fresh fruits, desserts (YOU HAVE TO TRY THEIR RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE TART), warm french toast (plain french toast), salads, cold plate (sesame noodles, spicy green beans, octopus salad), gourmet cheeses, a moist duck confit hash brown.  The fare available on the table is completely delicious, BUT MAKE SURE YOU SAVE ROOM FOR THE BEST STUFF!! After hitting the Harvest Table, you put the rock out on the table and the chefs start coming around with a few small plates: corned beef hash with poached egg, egg fritata, cinnamon buns, AND THE AMAZING CAJUN BACON.  The corned beef hash is good with a nice, brown crunchy outer layer with a nice warm gooey egg.  The fritata was a little too heavy on the cheese and egg factor, I definitely taste the eggs.  The cinnamon buns were of the same quality of with that of Cinnabon's!!  The melted cream cheese topping completes the soft inners of the bun with the crunchy outer layers of the cinnamon bun.  THE BEST THING BACON I HAVE EVER EATEN WAS THEIR CAJUN BACON THAT COMES IN THIS SMALL IRON SKILLET.  It is slightly spicy, slightly sweet, and fully savory, which appeals to pretty much everyone.  There are unlimited refills of the bacon with roughly 5-6 slices per order, I MUST HAVE EATEN ROUGHLY 3-4 ORDERS OF IT.. SOOO SOOO AMAZING!!! The chefs then come around with the premium meats and offerings.  The first piece was a play on Eggs Benedict with poached eggs on top of a crab cake with a light Hollandaise sauce.  The combination was different and unique, but each component by itself was okay.  The next thing we got was a miniature buffalo chicken and waffles, which was good with the syrup and the spicy.  However, the buffalo sauce overpowered the syrup and the sweetness of the waffle.  It would be amazing with a little more syrup.  The next part was the Ranch Sirloin Steak.  The steak was moist, juicy, and delicious.  IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH; IT'S PERFECTLY SEASONED.  I had the chefs come back 2-3 times for the steak.  We also got the roasted turkey and cranberry dressing.  In terms of the premium meats and offerings, the ROASTED TURKEY WAS MY FAVORITE WITH THE SWEET DRESSING AND THE SAVORY TASTE OF THE TURKEY.  I also had a roasted sausage that was meaty and full of flavor, but I have had similar sausage.  I feel like I'm forgetting a meat, there were so many.  If I remember, I'll be sure to comment.. I also ordered a Bloody Mary that was slightly too peppery, but had the right amount of kick and spice.  It was a part of their drink specials for the day for 5.00. ZED451 gets 5 stars for the excellent customer service, atmosphere, abundant mostly delicious fare, and cajun bacon.  I can't wait to go back for their Brunch and next time I'll jst get a mimosa!! :D AHH CAJUN BACONNN (mouth-watering over the laptop keyboard now)!!",0.9986,0.82,0.174,0.006,0.5505240130240129

The set-up here is a little different.  There's not a menu.  Well, I supposed technically there's a menu, but it just says 'brunch - $29.'  $29 for brunch, you say?  Outrageous!  Let's keep in mind, folks, that your $29 is buying you basically an unlimited brunch of the highest caliber of foods.   So let's break it down. Round 1 is a trip around the harvest tables.  The harvest tables house everything from cheeses to fruits to salads to roasted veggies to breads with truffle butter to boozy French toast to duck confit hash browns to desserts.  Round 1 also includes family style items brought to the table including HUGE, gooey cinnamon rolls, frittata, maple bacon and corned beef hash with poached egg.   Round 2 is when the servers walk around with skewers of meat and other brunchy items and offer them up.  I'm talking steak, turkey, salmon, salty ham and the like and also things like buffalo chicken and waffles, crab eggs benedict and sausages with mustard dipping sauce.  Just like dinner service, diners get a little rock to put next to their plate and the servers will keep coming with food until you move your little rock back into the middle of the table. Brunch at Zed451 is no joke.  I was so full I was certain I'd have to be rolled out of there.   Not only is the food amazing, the location is fabulous, too.  The main dining area boasts a huge, gas fire in the middle of the restaurant, deep, dark oversized wood tables and chairs, dim lighting and an all-over sexy vibe.  I would love to come back during dinner service to see everything all lit up against an evening sky backdrop. There were, however, two main flaws I see in the whole brunching process at Zed451.   First, the service is a little slow meaning it was difficult to flag down our waitress for coffee/mimosa refills and to actually get our check.  And second, as brunch carries on and it gets more crowded, I noticed it was increasingly difficult to snag one of the servers carrying around meat skewers and crab cakes for food service.  My party was there at 10:30am, but by the time we left at around noon, it was pretty crowded and I could easily see that other diners were getting impatient with the meat service. So there you have it.  Fancy brunch done pretty early is a total and complete win.  But get there early, especially if you're a meat-a-saurus and hate waiting for your beef.",0.992,0.814,0.132,0.054,0.5115684691955877

I think perhaps it's a different experience if you're here for a regular meal or if you're here with a large private group.  We came to a private dinner here and it was upstairs, with a mini salad bar area set up.  Not surprisingly, the more expensive charcuterie and salads weren't in our area - those were only downstairs and of course we couldn't just go down there and carry up plates ourselves.  The selection upstairs was ok, but it wasn't as generous and delicious-looking as downstairs.   But you come to a place like this for the carved meats, not the salad bar.  When the chefs came out for the meat carvings, they all came out at once and it was nonstop - for each of the meats, one time.  Each gave out very small portions, which was fine so you could try everything.  However, we expected that they'd come back a second time so you could have a little more of what you loved.  That didn't happen.  It was a big disappointment, as I literally had two bites of some of the meats and would've really liked more than that!

It was insulting as we've all come from big cities and are used to the game to get into a small area/rooftop bar but this was one big slap in the face- especially when our group was spending a considerable amount of money with this restaurant/bar.

The roof, touted as the best in Chicago based on their signage at the entrace, was not overly crowded, and they regulate the capacity up there with bouncer-types so people do not have to squeeze in.  My group of three who arrived actually had to wait a few minutes before being let up to join the rest of our friends, and we saw a group of 10 girls get told they had to wait about an hour to head up. When we finally did get up there, I would have to say I was impressed.  Cool fireplaces, ample seating, and a nice... second-story view.  Ok, maybe you're still looking up at all the tall buildings around you, but I have severe rooftop envy and I'll take any chance to be outdoors with any view.   The special drink menu was simple, and not overall impressive.  Nothing really stood out at me as something I needed to try, so I ended up getting the Parisian Blackberry-something drink.  A lil fruity but delicious.  Not very strong and, at $11 a pop, you may want to pregame beforehand if you plan on staying here for a long period of time.  The service was pretty slow; I think they may have had only one, maybe two, waitresses serving everyone up there.  It probably would have been easier just to go up to the bar. Best rooftop in Chicago?  Maybe.  But being on the second story of a building disqualifies it as the best view in Chicago.

I ate a whole tray of the biscuits before the food even showed up! The moscato, which generally I am not crazy about, is phenomenal with the food.  ...Brunch..... Brunch needs a new name, beholden to Zed all its own.    $3 mimosas. cinnamon sugar donuts. Bacon. egg benedict corn beef hash. spicy chicken and waffle. tomato basil egg fritata. duck confit hash browns. Steel cut oatmeal. French toast. egg benedict crab cake. in addition to the meat selection!!!! And not just good food... DE LI ICIOUS food. Slap me... I think I'm in heaven. AMAZING FOOD.

I met up with some of my girlfriends here for a grown up breakfast buffet.  OMG I almost died.  The fresh buffet tables were enough to fill me up, but they also delivered breakfast meats to the table!   The fresh buffets had a wide variety of fruits, salads, sausages, cheese, and desserts.  They deliver sweet cinnamon buns to the table, along with (get ready and brace yourself here) duck confit hash browns, corn beef hash topped with poached egg, buffalo chicken and waffles, crab cake benedict, tomato basil fritata, salmon, steak, amazing bacon, and more!  They have mimosas at $3 and smashingly good and dangerous bloody mary's at $5.   Although the brunch buffet is $24 and is pricier than I would normally pay, I definitely would go back.  The food is good.  You can eat as much as you want.  And the service was excellent.  I recommend spandex or at least a very forgiving waistband.",0.9899,0.696,0.24,0.064,0.5840000000000001

Zed451's harvest table spread was amazing  - your eyes will undoubtedly prove bigger than your stomach, but that's okay. While everything I tried was superb, my standouts were the sauteed mushrooms with feta sauce and the duck confit. And of course, EVERY SINGLE CHEESE on the table.  I'm not kidding when I say every single one. It's just not right if you miss out on any of them. Unfortunately, I wasn't in a meat loving mood when my parents and I enjoyed an evening at Zed, so I opted out of the meat extravaganza. However, my dad and mom perservered, and my dad (ever the carnivore), couldn't get enough of the buttermilk herb bottom sirloin and the ribeye. If you love quality meat, you will love Zed. Their craft beer list isn't too shabby, and their Spiced Apple Bourbon was a perfect end to the evening.

You might be thinking that is stupid... take your vegetarian girlfriend to a steakhouse. This is much more than just a steakhouse. The Harvest Table is perfect for your vegetarian girlfriend and I would have been happy with just that also.  If she doesn't mind watching you stuff your face with delicious meat and fish. The best thing I ate was the red snapper and the Pistachio Duck. After we ate they even drove us to a neighboring bar.

All were very pleased with the food.  The vegetarians paid $25 for access to the ""Harvest table"" buffet - cheeses, spreads, salads, noodles, eggs, vegetables, soups, etc. A lot to choose from (I particularly enjoyed the cheeses, the tuna poke, the brocolli rabe and the apple mint salad).  The non-veg people paid $44 and had access to the Harvest table as well as about 8 or so meat dishes that are brought out to the table once ready. About 5 of the 8 meat options were great. The Moroccan chicken was delicious.  Our plates were cleared on time and the meats were brought out quickly.  Our waiter checked in frequently.  Overall, I would recommend this place for sure.

2011-03-10,4.0,"First things first...the ambiance in this place is sexy, from the high ceilings and exposed wood to the plethora of candles and open fire in the area of the salad bar. The bar/lounge area is quite large with a large screen projection TV tucked into the far side -- perfect for those who want to watch (NCAA was on) but unobtrusive to those who don't. I don't recall hearing any audio from the TV, just the generic hipster lounge music that was piped in.  The bartenders were very friendly and they serve a variety of 'muddled' drinks. I went for a glass of a Washington state Cab 'the Sharecropper,' which was jammy and delicious. Zed451is a churrascaria with an emphasis on the chefs. You see, they are the ones who serve the meats as well as cook them. One of them even took his meat back to the kitchen to cook it a bit longer after seeing the inside color. We also got amuse bouche dishes of corn chowder with jalapeno and apricot glazed warm dinner rolls. The art of the chef is also on display in the salad bar which  features more prepared salads than a traditional 'make your own salad'-type salad bar. In this regard I must say that I still like individual ingredients and missed the hearts of palm, artichokes and sun-dried tomato you get at Fogo. Then again, the garlic wild mushrooms, duck pastrami and homemade tapenades were awesome... The best meat of the night was the Moroccan chicken -- moist and savory with complex spices. The New Zealand red deer venison was a treat (tastes like veal, not gamey) and the Australian leg of lamb was well seasoned. One more thing -- they even run a shuttle to bring you home if you've decided to get your drink on in addition to getting your meat on. They run as far north as Irving Park. Call ahead if you're thinking of this option. There also is a separate dining room in the back for large groups.",0.991,0.858,0.126,0.016,0.5271197691197691

Last week I joined a group of 10 or so peeps for dinner at Zed451. This really is the perfect spot for a big group dinner since you don't need to worry about ordering.   I figured there wouldn't be much for me to eat at Zed, but boy was I wrong.  I was in heaven after filling my plate from the harvest table. I was stuffed to the max after so many yummy veggies, but did help myself to some delish pieces of chicken, salmon and even some beef when the ""meat boys"" came around. Even the 1 vegetarian at our table was thrilled with the experience- our waiter was kind enough to bring him a vegetarian platter even after the harvest table!

Okay now that we have gotten the boring details out of the way on to Zed451's stunning interior full of multiple 5ft long gas fireplaces, rustic wood benches along with luscious white leather chairs and a fun use of candle light. The service was probably the best I have had in the city; our server Brandi was very attentive but it definitley took a team to make this dining experience superb. The Chefs all thanked US after they served us, odd to me but I nice touch I guess. First you are directed to the harvest tables which are stocked with lots of gourmet options such as vanilla bean oatmeal, red wine glazed pears with orange balsamic and walnuts, sauteed mushrooms with feta dressing, vanilla apricots, artisan cheeses and roasted figs and mozzarella. I recommend getting the smallest scoop possible of each because this is only the warm up of the feast you will have over the next hour. Next they bring around a few warm dishes right out of the oven for your table to share; a delicious frittata, maple smoked bacon, huge cinnamon rolls, and duck hash browns. When you are done devouring these yummies you put your designated river stone on the outside of the table signaling your server to get you a new plate and the 3rd part of your food service to begin. Chefs will bring around another round of delectable dishes such as a cut of beef marinated in buttermilk dressing, roasted turkey with cranberry sauce, brown sugar baked ham, a crab cake topped with a poached egg and buffalo chicken served atop a syrup'd waffle. We all left overly full though there wasn't one thing that I can say was FABULOUS. Zed offers an unlimited amount of really good and interesting food and an amazing atmosphere.

Dinner is slightly more expensive than at Brazzaz or Fogo, but the quality is 10x better.  Almost every meat, with the exception of the wagyu steak, is GRASSFED and bursting with flavor.  The thing that Zed does best is concoct flavor combinations tailored to their specific meats, and I could never tire of eating said dishes.  Meats go by: Pistachio-crusted duck breast, buttermilk marinated steak, braised bbq short ribs, charred polish sausage with homemade mustard, new zealand venison, and honey-kissed moroccan spiced chicken breast, to name a few.  Everything was so MOIST, I had to do a double take to make sure I was eating white meat!  Much better than Brazzaz, where the meats were indistinguishable from each other and tasted like stale cardboard.  At Zed, the harvest table also offers fresh and unique selections (try the forest mushrooms with creme fraiche, or the jicama salad with cilantro and berries) that are both impressive and novel.  Honestly I could have gotten full on just the harvest table alone but I could not deny myself a chance to sample their meats.  Totally worth it. We returned just yesterday for brunch.  Even though it was 11am, it wasn't crowded at all.  Zed's brunch is perhaps the best brunch deal I've ever had.  Most of the selections from this all you can eat buffet are MADE TO ORDER.  Highlights were the bacon (I think it was maple brown sugar chipotle spiced), cinnamon buns, buttermilk ranch-marinated sirloin steak, south western crab cakes, and mini red velvet cupcakes.  Seriously, brunch anywhere else now will just be obsolete.   As part of the holiday season, our server handed us gift cards worth at least $20 to be used any time in January, 1 per table, and we were handed 2 chocolate covered cake pops by the hostess.  As I walked out I made a reservation for 2 weeks later.  I will definitely be back.",0.9958,0.8,0.166,0.034,0.43628141883955845

Ambiance was great If you have some vegetarians in the group, check out Zen, if not I'd go to Fogo de Chao, which has better quality, more flavorful fare (both in terms of meat and vegetarian options).

Dinner operates a lot like the Brazilian churrascurias.  There is a ""salad bar"" with veggies, sides, and soup that is buffet style.  Then the servers come by your table to serve you the mains/proteins.  Some meats are on large skewers that they carve off for you, while others are already pre-sliced and laid on a large platter.  Everything tasted pretty good, but I didn't get all the offerings they list on their menu.  For example, I never got the salmon or chicken.  And the food, by the time is served to you, is not hot.  I only saw 1 round of the proteins, but a server said he could bring back more if I requested it.  My fave items were the wagyu beef and the brisket.  The duck and venison pieces (served on a platter) were all too rare for my taste.  The blackened catfish was way too salty.  Unlike at Fogo or Texas de Brazil, I definitely wasn't exploding from being too full.  We had a mini dessert buffet too, which I think was special to our party, but they were all fantastic, especially the lemon meringue tarts and mini red velvet cupcakes. The nice thing about Zed451 is that everyone - vegetarians, pescatarians, and carnivores - can be happy here with all the variety, but I'm the type of person who if I love something, I want a lot of it and a little of everything else.  At Zed451, you just get a little of everything.  So it's a good place for large parties or picky eaters so you can please everybody, but I personally wouldn't come back for $45/pp unless it was for a special event.",0.9978,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.5891917293233083

I particularly liked the vanilla glazed apricots and the pears... and no I wouldn't normally describe myself as fruity.  The event I was at featured mostly light fare so I didn't get to dabble in some of the meatier selections Zed is known for, but I'll definately be back.   My friend had their white peach sangria and said it was delish, although light on the alcohol.  They have beer too so no worries. So Zed, if i decide to show up with a blow torch and a pair of plyers do you think you'll be able to handle me?  I hope so, cuz theres a 5th star in it for you if you do!",0.931,0.816,0.123,0.062,0.48743697478991593
2010-08-31,4.0,"On a long weekend to Chicago, with a late Sunday flight home, were looking for a good place for brunch/lunch that would see us through the day. This was it ! It's similar to a Brazilian steakhouse with food served directly at the table and a salad bar ( Harvest Tables) that you can visit as much as you like.   Personally I found the Harvest Table fare a little disappointing as many items were too sweet, but this was brunch so that was to be expected. The table service food, however was excellent. Rib roast, turkey breast, ham, linguisa and salmon (though I don't usually eat farmed salmon) were all perfectly cooked and served freshly cooked from the kitchen. There were also more brunch-like egg based dishes - a poached egg on spinach and a frittata-like dish with corned beef. The servers will keep coming until you throw in the towel - or rock in this case. We definitely ate enough not to be hungry the rest of the day. $24 per person was a very reasonable price for the food offered, though we spent double that as we had a bottle of wine in addition to a sangria and a flight of wine ( 3 x 2oz for $12). Actually the wine selection was reasonably priced in comparison to some of the other Chicago menus I had seen.   All the staff were friendly and very attentive - we arrived at 1pm, there were only a few tables occupied, so I don't know if that applies during busier times. Unfortunately, I probably won't get back to Chicago for years, so I won't be able to check out the dinner at this place.",0.9667,0.892,0.09,0.018,0.5025

2010-08-09,3.0,"How would I describe Zed451?  Meat-fest meets a wallet heist.  While I am glad I have gone once, it is likely not a place I will visit again by choice.  I am not a big fan of the ""these are your two options"" menu style - perhaps I don't like being pigeon-holed into such limited options?  It is nice if you're in an indecisive and hungry for an unlimited quantity of food.  But to each their own, and that's just not my favorite way to dine.  You are given two options at dinner - basically, to meat or not to meat.  That is the question.   Atmosphere - outstanding.  It's a very cool space and I liked that it wasn't super crowded with tables so that I couldn't hear myself think.  The music was eclectic to say the least and wasn't overpowering in their high-ceiling rooms.   Service - excellent.  We had a very attentive waiter who did the one thing I asked:  ""send over the rib-eye man"" (more on that meat later).  He even did a little lyric change of the Gingerbread Man to the Ribeye Man for us.  For whatever reason he thought that I looked like someone who had a lot of cute gay friends to set him up with which made for a slightly awkward conversation while he escorted us to the rooftop, however, we had been joking all night with him so I guess he just felt comfortable soliciting for a new boyfriend! Food - where to begin. Let's start with the sides.  I was really excited to see there were three large tables of ""salads"" (aka cold side dishes) and two of cheese/meats/soup.  I thought for sure I would end up filling up too much on these dishes, which is where you start.  However, I was surprised by how many of them I didn't enjoy.   All in all they were mostly just bland to me.  Sides I liked were the sautéed mushrooms, chicken salad and the chicken tortilla soup.  You can't really screw up prosciutto and cheese and bread (DEFINITELY try their flavored butters) so these are a safe option.  But I found their asparagus to lack any flavor; the balsamic on the caprese salad to be way too sweet; and any other sides I had were just unmemorable to even write about.   The meats were plentiful.  I will warn you now that if you're someone who likes your meat well cooked, this is not the place for you. everything is done medium to medium rare (which works well for me).  And when you throw the signatory rock on your table to indicate you're ready for meat, they sure do come quickly.  The rib-eye was outstanding.  Hands down my favorite.  It was so well seasoned and done perfectly medium rare.  The rump roast was a close second to the rib-eye.  I avoided the sausages and venison (not particularly favorites of mine) so I can't speak to these.  The salmon was flavorful but overcooked, as was the chicken (in a curry seasoning).  For a place that has minimal multiple dishes to prepare at once, I find it difficult to understand why two of these were so overcooked.  The ahi tuna was also excellent.  I would avoid the fried ball of mashed potatoes and cod; this was another dish that fell flat on any flavor. For drinks I stuck to my Grey Goose martinis and was thrilled to hear they had blue cheese stuffed olives.   For six people doing the meat option and one doing the vegetarian, plus two bottles of wine, a single glass of wine, two martinis, two scotches and one beer our $570.00 (or $80 a person).  That's a bit steep for me for somewhere where I probably don't take advantage of the endless meat as much as a big-eater would have.",0.9769,0.857,0.095,0.048,0.627554440508986
2010-08-06,1.0,"How do I even begin? Well, let's start by saying that I came to the restaurant (for the first time) for a birthday party/dinner.  The restaurant was amazing - very classy - however, I can honestly say that I will not be a returning customer this horrible place ever again.   There were roughly around 30-35 of us; and with such a large group, we were put into a private room/section.  In this ""so-called"" private section, we were given ""bottom of the barrel"" customer service.  The Maitre d' ignored us the entire time...as well as the waiters.  Why...you might ask?  Well, for the simple fact that with any given large groups/parties...an 18% gratuity will be automatically added to the bill.  Which means...the servers/hosts/maitre d' are getting the service charge (tips) and can care less about us.  They gave us absolutely NO SERVICE whatsoever.    The entire time we were there, we had to ask for the ""waiters or servers"" to come around - which never happened.  I politely asked for steak sauce and other sauces they had available, maybe, for about six times...and they NEVER brought us anything.  I had to wait for my drinks, when they should have came around to ask us if we needed a refill.  Basically, they never came around us to bring us any food.  Wonderful customer service - wouldn't you agree?   I was raised in the restaurant business and certainly understand that, yes, there will be times when the restaurant is busy and customers are going to be unhappy with the service.  However, we strive our best to ensure that all of our customers are satisfied.  We try our best to give that 110% and do whatever it takes to get them to return.  Customer satisfaction is our number one priority.   I can honestly say that ZED451 can care less.  They do not even understand what EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE means.  The service was ridiculously poor and food was mediocre.  We could have spent our $1,800 (between 30-35 people) at a 1-star restaurant and received MUCH better service than at ZED451. With that being said...I rate this HORRIBLE place with...1/4 of a star.  Yes, not a full star...but 1/4 of star.  Or as my friend would say...""IF I HAD TWO MORE HANDS, I'D GIVE THIS PLACE A FOUR THUMBS DOWN!""",0.9902,0.783,0.157,0.059,0.5796186067019402
2010-08-01,3.0,"The restaurant itself is gorgeous, I'd been here a few times for drinks both at the bar and at a cabana upstairs where I also sampled some great mussels so I was excited when I found out our company dinner was here.  The Harvest Table, the salad/pre-meat bar was great, lots of options pre-main event. I was especially a big fan of the lobster bisque, but it had everything you might expect, from cured meats and cheese to nice grilled vegetables. So all was great leading up to the real food..but the wheels fell off a little. So Zed aspires to be a fusion version of a Brazilian steakhouse, meaning they do the whole bit with meat on swords brought around from table to table.   First off, the servers could use a little more training, on a few occasions in one night they almost dropped items as they pushed them off the swords. Then there was the common sense issue; while navigating a big party with many tables, wouldn't it make sense to arrive at a new table with at least half the goods on a sword? If only for appearances, the diner would feel like they are getting fresh wares. Instead a nearly-finished sword makes the majority of the table see food that has no chance of being served - particularly if the table service order is haphazard as it was that evening; there were definitely some promises of coming back that weren't fulfilled, resulting in me not getting any flank or rump roast.

I realize that something like that is fun once in a while, but Zed is more subdued, which makes a huge difference when your gimmick is people coming by to offer you meat. We started with the appetizer buffet which has a ridiculous amount of options, from potato salad to cured meats to sauteed veggies. I got mostly sauteed vegetables (the mushrooms were great!) and the cured meats were fantastic. I also enjoyed a few little bits of the parmesan crumbles, and I'm not much of a cheese person. I also had two glasses of moscato - hooray for sweet sparkling wine. They brought ridiculously buttery but delicious naan to our table. But still, I wanted to save up for the ENTREES. Friendly and polite servers came to offer each of us different types of meat, and they honored my dad's vegetarian requests by bringing him a variety of types of fish. I usually dislike lamb and find it gamey, but it was very well seasoned and delicious. I also enjoyed the buttermilk-cooked sirloin, as well as basically every cut of meat they gave me! The venison was a bit too ""earthy,"" though. I also liked the pork belly, which was not as fatty as I thought it'd be. Basically, with the exception of venison, all of the meat they serve you is AMAZING, and they shave it off in respectably small slices so a food coma is less inevitable! We didn't have desert but I'd like to imagine that they cook cheesecake on a rotisserie and then slice it off for you.  The service was well above average. I didn't love the high tables we sat in, especially since I wasn't too comfortable in the seats, but that's barely anything compared to how delicious Zed is.

The harvest table/salad bar can be very satisfying and filling, but be sure to save room for all the incredible meat! There is so much flavor in everything they serve here that I promise I have a new favorite food every time I take a bite. I'd skip the venison though. It's a little too tough and dry for my liking. If you opt to skip out on the main dining room, the bar area has great food too! Every time I stop in with my friends we order ZED margaritas and the fondue. The fondue comes with tons of bread, meat, and veggies.  The cheese is very creamy and savory. By far my favorite thing on the menu. Oh and if you do order the ZED margarita, get it smoked. The smoke flavor compliments the meat and fondue nicely. And if margaritas aren't your thing, definitely try the strawberry basil martini. It's slightly sweet and  very refreshing. Also in the summer, the rooftop bar is one of my favorites! It's definitely a chill place with good vibes. The music isn't too loud that you're yelling to have a conversation with the person next to you, but it can get loud depending on how crowded it gets.  I've never had a complaint about this place and have never got tired or bored of coming here!",0.9948,0.738,0.219,0.043,0.6825036075036074

The only prerequisite was a nice outdoor seating area.  Zed451 Check!.  However from the minute we walked in until the we finally left a few hours later the service was poor to nonexistent, the ambiance pretentious, and response from management was cavalier.  The group of 7 or 8 arrived about 530 and asked to be seated upstairs for drinks. They took our name and put it on a list. I thought, WOW they must really be busy already so we grabbed some seats in the normal bar area only to be ignored for 20 minutes until a waitress finally decided to assist us. Soon after, our buzzer went off and we were headed upstairs. I'm thinking ""great"" that was rather quick considering how ""busy"" they were upstairs...until we actually made it to the roof . There were a few people up there on the roof but there was definitely plenty of room up there for them to ""seat"" us immediately instead of making us wait 40 minutes. Once on the roof, the service continued to be poor. It took another 30 minutes just to track down who our server is. Then for our second round, we had to order from her twice, only for her to disappear for an hour after that. We had to go to the bar another two times to track her down and the bartenders ""suggested"" that we do not reorder our drinks from them b/c she HAD to be around somewhere.  The night continued along the same negative experience - we finally had enough and decided to leave. On the way out, I spoke to the manager of the roof and he seemed to care less about the poor service and negative experience our group had that night.  Never again Zed451, Never again.

It was my first time here, and I fell in love! The buffet is pretty good, however, I didn't go there much. It was the entrées that I was after. (If you only eat from the buffet, like I saw one girl do, you probably won't really like this place. Also, if you are a vegetarian, almost every entrée is meat, so this wouldn't be the best place to go.)  The entrées were all amazing, the swordfish especially. It takes a while for the different entrées to come around since there are so many, so go with people that you can have great conversations with. You're looking at an hours-long meal here. Also, I remember this place being a bit pricey, what with all of the fine and high-quality meats they offer. Also, I was there for dinner, so the prices could differ for other parts of the day. The serving staff are all very nice. (Or, at least, they were when I was there. It's been about 2 years since I was last there, I think.) Our waiter overhead my one cousin talking about how he was studying to be a chef, so the server brought him into the kitchen so he could see how everything was assembled! I thought that was very kind.  All in all, I can't wait to go here again and relive that delicious food-induced coma.

But this turned out to be the very best seat in the house! It's very warm and cozy because you are right by the stoves/ovens. It's very close to the harvest table. The staff were really personable - we asked them questions, they answered and asked us what we especially liked to eat and so that it came around to us more often than the other choices.  The drinks! Oh wow! The spice/fruit is marinated in the liquor which creates an infused blend of aromatherapy & flavor! My words can't describe how good they are.

2010-03-28,5.0,"451 degrees is the temperature at which books burn.  I am no fan of censorship; instead let's burn meat.  Should be Zed 125 through 151.   The churrascaria genre is dominated by expensive, touristy options that aren't really that  unique though still great for a night of protein dripping in fat on swords of greatness.  Zed defies this with bold modern style, a different variety of well executed offerings and competent friendly service.   We were seated in the inner circle, an arrangement not unlike some sort of cult ceremony with long tables point outwards from a gas fire that intermittently fired, probably as virgins were sacrificed on the roof deck.  This area is the best, I think it can be secured with an earlier reservation in the 6 to 7 area.  The harvest table ring around was nearby and we made several trips, a rarity for me but the pears poached in wine with walnuts and varieties of salamis were good to whet the appetite for meat.  There were a few unique cheeses, a paprika rubbed was a highlight.    There were far less cuts of beef than usual but the spice rubbed sirloin was excellent, the flavors wafting down the long table.  The rib eye, in square form and speared on to a trident like sword had delicious melty fat and grilled onions were available on the pedestal of meat.  Asian pork belly was fairly decent but pork belly should be more succulent.  Small squares of venison was probably the group favorite; we cleared a plate, one of us even taking four at a time.   The rare tuna with seaweed salad, wasabi cream sauce and ginger was a bit elaborate but wonderful.  The lightly fried Mahi with pineapple dollop was pretty good when freshly arrived.  The Moroccan chicken was spiced very well, a sweet cumin scent hung in the air; though chicken is never the favorite in the land of beef.  The lamb was absolutely excellent, a decent amount of gamey flavor; a clearly high quality sourcing job.  And this goes back to my other churrascaria reviews, each steakhouse like this excels with certain meats and not with others; though Zed 451 has been the best all around.   As my tablemate suggested, ""Why can't they have a season pass here like they do at a theme park?""  Well Zed, I just gave you a business model and I'd be happy to buy a 6 month pass.",0.9984,0.76,0.223,0.017,0.5885063492063493

A certain someone came here for their Sunday brunch and all I read was ""$24 all you can eat... chicken and waffles"". I screamed, ran out to inform J that we were going to be eating here the following Sunday and made reservations right then.  A week later:  I set multiple alarms. We find easy parking on Clark. The hostess compliments me on my shoes AND shirt. And we feast.  Did I mention the Sunday brunch here is only $24?! And this is what you will get: 1) Harvest Tables aka the salad bar. But this is no ordinary salad bar! There is a fruit station with fresh cut mango. There is a pastry station with too many chocolate desserts and cookies. There is a prepared salads station with all sorts of different mixed salads - pasta, potato, veggies, noodles, etc etc. There is a charcuterie station with breads, meats, cheeses, flavored butters, olives (can they move this to my house please?) And finally, a station featuring some tasty vanilla infused oatmeal and brioche french toast. 2) While you are at your table eating your Harvest Table plate (you can always go back for more but I recommend watching your pace for this mammoth meal) servers start to appear with tiny cast iron pans of food. What is this?! Maple glazed bacon? Cinnamon rolls? Hash browns? Frittata? Is this really happening right now? 3) After Step 2, any normal person would be exploding at the seams but this isn't over yet. Whenever you are ready, by placing a rock on your table, you allow for a stream of brunch deliciousness to be brought to you. Craved meats in the form of sausage, turkey, beef. Corned beef hash. Crab cake benedict. And the star of the day: CHICKEN & WAFFLES. This is no ordinary chicken and waffles. This is buffalo chicken and waffes - so salty + sweet + KICK IN THE MOUTH!  4) (Optional) Cleanse palate with fruit and/or dessert from Harvest Table.  Honestly, where can you eat that well and much for $24?  Our ""waiter"" did ruin our experience a little though. He basically disappeared for most of our meal. Never brought us plates, kept us hostage for over 20 minutes getting the check (and someone else had to get it for us in the end). Unacceptable.

You get started with the harvest table where they have a variety of fruits, vegetables, salads, soups, meats, cheeses and breads. The setup is very nice. Tip: don't take too much! You will regret it! I was warned, but I didn't listen! Take a little of everything. You get a rock, which you place on the edge of your table when you want some meats to come your way. Chefs will walk around with meat for you to try, 12 in all. They are served medium-rare unless you request them cooked more ""well."" My favorites were the Moroccan chicken (Could eat that all night), orange-tempura mahi mahi and the buttermilk steak. There is also salmon, lamb chops, sausages and venison. It's pegged as a steakhouse, and yes, there is a ton of meats, but I don't think vegetarians/vegans would have much trouble here. I'm not a big meat-eater myself. I have it maybe once a month, if that. The harvest table has a lot of non-meat options. I love vegetables and fruit, so I could have been satisfied with the table. If you like, Zed451 gives you the option of just dining at the harvest table. There are also a few delicious sides; we got the gouda mashed potatoes. So good. Also, we got a complimentary bread basket of hot pita bread. For drinks, I had a glass of white whine and a glass of sangria. The sangria tasted like watery juice. For desert, my date and I tried to split the s'mores pie. What I DID manage to get down was delicious. This is HUGE. They say it can feed 2, but I think 3 or even 4 would be more appropriate. You get two scoops of marizan, 2 coconut macaroons, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a scoop of chocolate, the actual pie made of (duh) graham cracker crust, chocolate and marshmallow. It's finished off with a garnising of 2 toasted square marshmallows. Yum. Also tempting: the butterscotch bread pudding. Totally almost got that. I ate so much, I was actually uncomfortable. My date and I went out to a club and it was hard to simply drink. It's been 2 days. I'm still kinda full. Service is also impeccable. They are very attentive and friendly. Very non-pretentious.

If I hadn't been saving room for meat, I would have been content to eat several of the little poppers. On that note, their sides were all not bad at all. They had this yummy mashed potato dish that I would have been quite happy to eat as part of my meal, had I not been really set on eating a lot of meat. And the meat was good. They had a large assortment from beef to chicken to pork to lamb to fish to venison. I am not a fan of venison so I did not like that one, but enjoyed all the other ones. They were also less salty than  the comparable dishes at Texas de Brazil. I would return to Zed for sure!",0.9953,0.735,0.242,0.023,0.5555916305916305

The only piece of meat I really liked was the rump roast, but one cut is not passing for a $44 meal. The ""Harvest Tables"" are really just not great - most of the charcuterie and cheese is average and the salads are all pretty limp and too oily. The wine list was ok and a bit overpriced in my opinion.  It was a tuesday and I was at a business dinner.

From the great pre-dinner cocktails at their fabulous bar with cool waitstaff, I was highly impressed from the start. The owner of ZED must have forked some serious $$ for the decour & ambiance as it was brand-new, crisp&clean to perfection, and had a great vibe. Wine selections were very good along with the well-written menu and food selections.  Great for carnivores as well as provided an excellent salad bar (I hate that word, reminds me of pondersosa steakhouse back in the day) which my mother loved. The meat selection was awesome, from Lamb to Filet, all unique and differently prepared, thoroughly enjoyed. The only big turnoff is buffet style (get out of your seat and wait in line for the salad bar) but fortunately there were no old ladies in the line (there were also 2 different salad bars to choose from). Although I'm not a big fan of the turn your stone over and smoke signal for more meat thing, their runner meat carving system seemed to work well, no complaints as the entire table was well fed.

Most important- MAKE SURE YOU'RE HUNGRY! We came around 5pm on a Wednesday, so we had no problem with seating. We ordered a bottle of wine, and filled up at the Harvest Table (which is essentially a salad bar, only without the do-it-yourself salad of a normal salad bar, more like unique salads are presented). Unfortunately I filled up a little too much, and was kind of full by the time the entrees started. I tried a little bit of almost all the meats, and absolutely loved buttermilk sirloin, the rib, and the crab beginets. We also bought a Smores Pie. Yum! I'm glad there were 3 of us, because I was stuffed by the time dessert came. Our server Dwayne was hysterical and great- he made sure we had a great time. The chefs and managers were friendly.

Come for the drinks!!!  The mixologists here know what they're doing and they can put together crazy-@ss cocktails to set you free and make you speak in different tongues.  I love the fact that the drink menu changes seasonally.  The drink you were chilling with this summer on the rooftop is not going to be the same drink you kick back with by the fireplace in the winter.  Whether it's spirits, wine or beer, there's something always exciting on the drink menu.  Sometimes, in the mixologists zeal for adventure, they swing and miss.  But, I'd rather have a drink that aimed high, missed and have the option to replace it, than uninspired drinks that do nothing but taste wet. My selections: the winter drinks.  Every winter, Zed comes with a couple of signature cocktails that rock my socks.  Last year, was a brandy year.  I am not a brandy drinker, but they infused it with something sweet, served it with ice and coolness and made my mouth happy.  I recently tried an Autumn sangria.  It was pear and apple and wine and other stuff I can't remember and it was smooth.  And not summery.  I also tried a maple syrup, brown sugar, apple/ginger drink.  It wasn't to my taste (too much muddled ginger) but I appreciate the effort.  It's weird, but they always hit the season exactly right. In the summer, the rooftop deck is a sexy place to be seen, shoop on some honeys and laugh at the strike downs (it's close enough to the VT that you get some tragic run off).  Downstairs, when it's cool, the fireplace is the place to sit with a beverage, lap in the warmth...and laugh at the strike downs.  I will admit to liking the food off of the drink menu.  The crab sliders are substantial, satisfying to the taste and quite filling.  It may be the brioche bread.  It may be the size of the crab cake (quite large).  It may be the fact that my belly was full of booze.  Who knows.  It was good.  Get it. Three stars sounds a little weird given the effusive praise I have just heaped onto the drink menu.  But, the food menu...it's too hit or miss.  If this were a cheaper place, maybe the hit-or-miss wouldn't be a big deal.  But, it's not.  Spend your money on what's not gonna let you down.  Come here for the drinks.  Stay for the strike downs.",0.9961,0.812,0.146,0.042,0.5413015873015874

Overall, a lovely ambiance with respectable food. My issues are primarily service related. First, food. The harvest table is a more limited version of a salad bar than one would encounter at competitors. That said, the food is prepared in smaller quantities and is fresher than it would be sitting in a large bowl elsewhere. The soup was quite nice, and the mushrooms quite good. The side dishes are fine. The muffins brought to the table are different than you encounter at other similar places (cornbread like). The potatoes were quite good, and I heard the creamed spinach was nice. The meat selections are nicely seasoned and brought to the table by individuals dressed as chefs instead of in gaucho garb. So, service. Leaves quite a bit to be desired. Most of the meats made only one trip through the dining area, and there was little apparent effort on the part of the server to inquire about our welfare and the status of the meal. We were there as part of a larger group in a side room...but in such an advent one would expect more effort to be made in ensuring that guest are enjoying the meal and being served properly.

Not only do you get to chill-out in the swanky lounge with mahogany tables and Napa's top rated Caymus by the glass as you wait for your table, but the Zed takes the salad bar concept foody-heaven direction with the kicked up artisan cheeses, roasted veges and 6 different antipasti meats. But that may all seem like noise when you've saved up your calories all day for some serious bottomless meat on sticks. Your $50's gets you a carnivore pass to 4 beefs, 2 lambs, pork ribs, chicken and, how'd a thunk, 3 fish. The meat quality was not really any different than what they throwing in fire pit down the street at Fugo and not sure I understand how the fish thing fits in here.  Actually, the fish tasted like tofu when my pallet had just been through 3 beefs and a lamb.

You can't go wrong with that.  We also got the sliders - beef, crab and vegetarian (why we bothered with vegetarian, I'll never know - I didn't eat any). Of course, I tried the beef, and it was . . . okay. Just good enough, not spectacular.  We got some other appetizer that was so forgettable I don't even remember what it was. Not cool.  Our last appetizer was the Chicken Samosas. I didn't try one of these 'cos I was full by then. I'm sure the Samosas were . . . really average, like the other stuff.

Since I do not eat red meat we ordered a seafood dinner for the table, which looked very pretty but I did not feel as though the seafood was the highest quality.  I was also not impressed with the fish and chicken options that they brought around and served throughout dinner, the fish was a little overcooked and the chicken was nothing spectacular.   The highlight of my dining experience here was the dessert.  Bread pudding is one of my favorites and this place had a butterscotch bread pudding that was marvelous.

Good deal we thought considering it is normally $55 per person without drinks.  We sit, we converse and laugh, we order drinks, which according to our waiter, we can order anything.  Anything, really?  Anything.  Mistake number 1, never listen to the waiter.   We have the ""harvest bar"" and get ready to eat some meat.  Some of us having been to Fogo or Brazza bring back some vegetables to each with dinner because you have to break up the meat monotony somehow.  To our surprise, suddenly we have side dishes of vegetables, potatoes, breads and so forth at our table.  Complimentary we ask?  Of course.  See mistake number 1. More laughing, wine and stories are told.  Dessert trays comes along and the red velvet cake was to die for.  We get ready to settle up, finish our drinks and head out for a night on the town stuffed to the gills.  Simple math says $60 per person plus 18% gratuity and 10% tax would be around $80.  $80 for 25 people would be $2000.  Our bill, $4000.  WTF?!  Pandemonium naturally ensues.  Drinks?  No, the drink package was only for red and white wines and the mid level spirits, who said you could have a negroni?  The side dishes, not complimentary.  Oh, and those desserts, cha-ching.    We ask to speak to a manager and get crickets.  We ask to speak to the event planner who we can see walking around the restaurant and spoke with us earlier.  No response.  They basically blew us off without giving us the respect or the explanation that we rightfully deserved.  We felt charges were weaseled in and for 20 minutes we did not have anyone from the restaurant answering our questions.  Not even a waiter.  It was bullshit at the highest level.  And terribly unprofessional.  No one from our group was belligerent, intoxicated or out of control, just shocked and needed some answers which ZED451 was unwilling to answer. In the end, we lost and all had to pony up nearly $130 per person.  Somehow the bill was reduced.  Always good to have a lawyer in the group when you dine out.  Will we go back?  Maybe for drinks on the roof when one of the organizations we are involved with has a networking event, but not by choice.  The food and service are not spectacular by any means and for $55, there are more qualified and talented chefs at restaurants that deserve your dollar.  ZED451 is not one of them.",-0.6658,0.8,0.097,0.103,0.5051020408163266

2009-05-29,4.0,"I love ZED451.   First of all, anyone familiar with me or my reviews already knows I'm a sucker for a great ambience, and ZED doesn't disappoint.  I love the combination of sleek, modern glass/decor against rustic wood in the lounge.  Combined with the beautiful glass fireplace, it's like being in a stylish Aspen ski resort, a theme that continues on the all-wood rooftop bar.  The dining room is entirely modern, and the long, wide shelf hanging from the ceiling with white pillar candles of assorted sizes is gorgeous.   Drinks are always high quality.  ZED has an excellent wine list that pairs nicely with food, including several interesting options outside the cabernet/chardonnay/merlot norm.  The lounge features seasonal sangria, something I almost always order, and it's spectacular.  My favorite, the summer sangria, is potent, fruity and FINALLY in season again!  Cocktails also have a unique, seasonal twist that, again, sets them apart from the standard cocktails offered at many lounges.  I mostly go to the lounge, but I've eaten at ZED twice, and the food is pretty good.  The first time, I sat in the dining room and ordered the harvest table option, where you select from an assortment of non-meat sides dishes, pasta, soups, etc.  A meat/wild game table (which I didn't try) is also available.  During my second visit, I had passed appetizers as part of a work function.  The food is good; just be prepared to pay for a lot more food than what you might be able to eat if you sit in the dining room.  I don't believe ZED offers an a la carte menu in the dining room, so even the harvest table option will set you back a bit, but if you're OK with that, you'll enjoy it.  Their lounge menu, which I haven't tried yet, does offer small plates.  I hear their new summer lounge menu is out, so I'll update my review after I give it a try.  Service is friendly and professional.  Everyone, including the hostess, bartenders, servers, chefs (who sometimes stand out by the harvest tables), etc., is always warm and helpful.  I haven't had a single bad experience since I began going to ZED last year.  And the biggest draw at ZED?  Without a doubt, the rooftop bar.  The lounge is always far more packed during warm months when the roof is open than in the winter, and it offers a nice view with spectacular people-watching.  Get there early if you want to check it out, however, because the line to get upstairs forms quickly, and the rooftop closes around 11 pm.  As others have mentioned, the crowd is a mix of classy, late 20s/early 30s professionals.  The bar area of the inside lounge is small enough to facilitate conversation, and most patrons are friendly without being overly social.   ZED is a great spot for a group dinner, an evening on the town or a date.  You can't go wrong!",0.9974,0.821,0.165,0.014,0.5261268333656394

When we finally made it upstairs, it was crowded.  On a beautiful day like yesterday, a rooftop is a place to be especially with views like ZED451.  The crowd was urban professional, but in my opinion, not that impressive.  However, good people watching.

I'm a savvy diner.  I'm a chef.  I've been in this business a long ass time.  Even after the bill was paid I was confused about my experience here.   On Mothers Day I went here with my little brother and the parental units.  They had been here before, but had only ever sat in the bar area and order little appetizers from that menu.  Much to my (and my mothers) surprise when we were seated (albeit promptly) in the dining room - only to see chefs wandering around the dining room with skewered meats going table to table.  Gross.  We did not know that this is what we had in store... I suppose it was our own fault...I should have Yelp'd the place first before we made reservations.  But this is where the rest of the family wanted to go, so I made no judgements and was along for the ride. Once we were greeted by our server, he informed us about how everything works, including what they referred to as the ""Harvest Table"".  Which was only a glorified salad bar.  Sure, they had alot of options and everything looked fairly fresh - but for the price we were paying...well, I wanted more than that.  The four of us had made at least two trips to the salad bar before our server finally came over with the plates that would be used for our meat offerings from the skewer-carrying attendants wandering around the dining room.   Apparently, you were to place a small rock by your plate when you wanted your meat...Not sure how they can spot that from the other side of the dining room - but whatever. The few things I did try off the meat sticks were okay...nothing to write home about.  Salmon, pork, rump roast.  Again, not really worth the price we were paying. The drinks were okay, overpriced.  The first one I ordered I had to send back; as it was so awful I couldn't even swallow it.  Something with alot of lemon, and little of anything else.  I ended up with a grape-rosemary martini which sounds awful but honestly was the highlight of the meal. We ended the meal with the s'mores pie...I'm a sucker for marshmallow, so I didn't care that it said it served 2 or more people. It's what we were having!  It was good, not great.  But the portion size was huge, and it was more than enough for 4 people. The interior of this place is massive. Seriously huge.  I just can't believe that it ever fills up, because I can't believe that people want to eat communial meat off a stick that badly.  The roof deck was really pretty, and I imagine it might be a nice date night kind of thing - if you stick to the bar menu.  I don't see it very romantical ordering meat off a stick on a first date - but that's just me.",0.5172,0.825,0.093,0.081,0.6201851851851852

2009-04-18,2.0,"I asked my boyfriend where he wanted to go for dinner for his birthday and he saw an ad in the Red Eye for Zed 451.  We go to Zed and receive horrible service and the food tasted bad. The service was slow and we left there hungry. Zed is a Brazilian steak house where they keep coming back and serving meat to you. The meat carvers were standing around the kitchen and talking and waiting for the cooks to get the meat ready.  It was like they didn't prepare enough food. I spent over 160 dollars for bad service and bad food. It was my boyfriend's 31st birthday and it was ruined. How do you spend 160 dollars and leave hungry? I wanted to complain to the manager, but my boyfriend was so disgusted and fed up that he just wanted to leave. We spent almost 3 hours there! I called the next day to complain, I spoke to Kelsey the manager at the time. She apologized for the experience and gave me her cell phone number. She said to come back in and she would take care of us. She seemed to actually care and wanted to make things right. So I tell my boyfriend and he is reluctant to go back as it was just a waste of time the first time. We decided to go back a month later in the hopes that things changed. I called the manager on her cell and she said she would put us in @ 8:30 for that evening. We get there at 8:15 and the hostess informs me that my reservation is for 9:30...I said, I talked to Kelsey and she put us down for 8:30? They tell me I'm not in there. The hostess tells us to go upstairs for a drink and she'll try to get us something in 20 minutes. We didn't want to argue, so we go upstairs. We have a drink. The view up there is beautiful, drinks were okay. Do not get the sangria, wasn't that great and they ran out of fruit that night. After 30 minutes, we went back down. We wanted to make sure they had enough time. Now the place isn't even crowded, so I do not know why we had to wait. We sit in the middle section, next to salad bar and get stuck sharing a table with another couple. The waiter this time around was much better and service had improved. The meat service was faster and I can say that we were both full. We had wrapped up everything now in less than 2 hours. Seems like they only had one guy carving the meat that night, the same guy kept coming to our table with different cuts of meat. Now after talking to the manager, one would think she put notations of some kind under my reservation...I was expecting to at least get a discount, have one dinner comped, something. Well we get the bill and it's for 120...No discount, no comp, NOTHING. Now we are sharing a table with another random couple and I didn't want to cause a scene. They said they were visiting from out of town and it was their first time in Chicago. My boyfriend pulls out his credit card and shakes his head...Now, instead of wasting 160, we threw about 120 more away. $300 spent on okay food and okay service. We would not have gone back if we didn't think we were going to get something out of it. I call the Kelsey back the next day to complain and she asks me why I didn't ask for her, I said my reservation wasn't even on there and we were sharing a table with another couple and I didn't want to draw any attention. She says she is out of town and will call me back in 2 days when she returns to work. 1.5 weeks later, I have not heard anything from her. I left her another message on her voicemail and have not gotten any kind of follow up at all. Why give someone your cell phone and say you will take care of them, when you really had no intention to. Honestly, for the amount of money spent, go to Ruth's Chris or Joe's on Grand or Wildfire. Fogo and Brazazz are so much tastier if you really want to go to a Brazilian steak house. Zed is not worth it. I wasn't satisfied by writing a bad review on Metromix, so what I did was file a complain with the BBB. I didn't hear back for 2 months. Someone finally contacted me, a new manager. He was nice and REFUNDED my credit card and my boyfriend's credit card. This is why I'm giving this place 2 stars, only because this guy was nice enough to refund us and apologized for our experiences. I still wouldn't go back there again. I don't think he is there anymore as I got an invite to go back in an email for an event and I requested that they remove me from their email list. A new manager emailed me back and asked me why so I had to go over this whole explanation again and she apologized and said that we should try coming in again and she'd take care of us.

People were arriving for their shifts and getting the place ready for a night of business.  However the hostess was nice and welcoming and pointed us in the direction of the bar. The bartender was nice and chatty (which I appreciate). Upon the recommendation of my friend (Thanks Kelly S) I had a beer over the usual glass of wine. The bartender let me try a bit before I bought it and it was the best beer ever (ok, maybe not but it was pretty good).

The ""gaucho"" meats came.   Don't come here for the red meat since you'd be a bit disappointed.  I did love the seafood and game meats since I still had the mindset of Brazzaz in my head.  It was a great surprise.   Overall, great stuff.  It won't be a place to go frequently, but perfect for special occasions.",0.9844,0.683,0.23,0.088,0.46768707482993194

My recommendation is to start with a drink at the bar then mosey on over to the dining area.  I have had a couple of their signature martini's that are to die for, the white grape and rosemary and the clementini.  Definitely be adventurous when you are at the bar.  They have a decent sized bar menu and it will be expanding soon from what I have heard.  I recommend the tuna carpaccio, the wild boar ribs and the various sliders.  It is not a place to go alone, take someone with or even a group, you will have a blast.  During the warmer days the rooftop is open for cocktails and has a great view of the city. If you have the chance and it is present on the charcuterie table, try the duck salami!!!  It is to die for if you love aged meats!!  There are a couple of great dishes the chefs bring to your table that you should try and they are the Ahi with 2 diferent types of sauce on the top and bottom of the plating, the venison with a bordelaise sauce and sautéed onions and the roasted duck breast with a grand marnier sauce with mandarin oranges.  The salmon, Moroccan chicken and prime rib are good choices that are brought around by the chefs.

The bartender couldn't have been more charming- very courteous without being fake. We then proceeded to the modern dining area to be seated in the semi back.

The upstairs outdoor bar makes the place a cool hangout in the summer, but I'm here to tell you that it was terrifically warm and cozy in the main dining room during the dead of winter. We had a terrific time here during its previous incarnation as Sal & Carvao, and I think I like the redeveloped concept even more. I have virtually no complaints with the old way of bringing over a dozen kinds of beef, lamb, chicken, pork, etc. around on the skewers, but Zed also brilliantly expands that to include such items as, on the night we visited, swordfish, seared tuna steak, salmon, mahi mahi, and even venison.  Everything I ate was delightful, including the items on the harvest table.  I guess if I had to complain, I'd limit it to the servers either being very attentive for most of the time, but distant at others. On 3 occasions I'd hoped to exchange my plate for a clean one but no one was around to do it before the next fabulous skewer-de-viande arrived. Our server was extremely gracious throughout the meal, particularly with regard to welcoming us and wishing the little lady happy birthday which was much appreciated. However, they didn't do as restaurants usually do and provide a small birthday dessert.

2009-01-28,2.0,"THE REVIEW This year I got to celebrate my B-Day twice! I chose the venue and my friends picked up the tab. Awesome friends, I know. Zed451 has two parts: the steakhouse and the lounge/patio bar I ate at the steakhouse which is $55 a person and modeled after a Churrascaria. Oops! I didn't know that! So my poor friends which have varying incomes were forced to spend $55 plus 10% tax and 20% tip just for the price of admission.  Ouch!  I'd love to say that a Max M Birthday is worth that price, but I'd be smoking crack. So I felt guilty, but I figured that Zed451 would vindicate my choice of venue. It is a beautifully designed steakhouse that could easily pass as one of Vegas' upscale restaurants. Fiamma or Craftsteak at the MGM Grand comes to mind. Fireplaces, clean lines, intimate lighting are just a few of the aesthetic strengths.  We had a beautiful table towards the back of the restaurant. Big mistake. This table was the only one able to accomodate our party of 10. It was right below the heating vents. Needless to say, everyone started getting shiny faces. It took 4 requests before they turned down the heat. By then ,everyone was ready to strip. Note to self: request large table for 10 when accompanied by hot females.  We ordered 2 different bottles of wine to start. The server asked some guests if they needed a glass change when switching wines.  Hello??? Umm, Yes!  Cabernet? Syrah? Malbec? Who cares? It's all the same. ""C'mon Zed. Get your act together! You're making the host look bad on his B-Day!""  At this point, I'm praying that the food saves the day. ""Steak is pretty money"", I tell myself. If this place is as good as Texas de Brazil, then I'll save face. The salad bar selection isn't as good or vast as Texas de Brazil's. Unfortuntely, the meat isn't as good either. Zed's does score points for creativity. Instead of using the green puck or coaster, they use river stones. You simply just place a river stone by your napkin to cue the servers. The servers took way too long in between servings. That has NEVER happened to me at a Churrascaria. Usually, you have to fend the waiters off. I was tempted to throw the river stone at the servers. The meat wasn't seasoned well. Some pieces were still mooing. The selection wasn't very deep or broad. The best thing I ate was the tempura Sea Bass! I repeat: The best thing that i ate was the tempura Sea Bass...we're in a steakhouse. The best things that i had were: Sirloin Soy Ginger Glazed Flat-iron Flank steak Tempura Sea Bass Short Ribs Granted, none of this tasted better than Texas de Brazil. Dessert is also not included. When the check finally arrived, I had given good thought to jumping into their gigantic flame oven. I didn't see the check, but I estimate the average came out to $120-$130 a head! Yowsers!  Thank god that I have terrific friends. As of now, they still return my text messages, phone calls, and emails. Then again, they could be waiting for me to return the favor. Let me guess, we're heading to Charlie Trotter's or Joe's Stone Crab and Steak and Max is picking up the tab. =) I'll be back to chill on the patio when the weather warms up.

Second place to the ambience is the food.  The dishes were more miss than hit, I think.  Because the dudes w/the mega meatmissiles were either swarming you all at once or taking 20 minute breaks in between ""Kielbasa, folks?"" rounds, we ate more from the 'harvest tables' than anything.  Those dishes were bleh and felt like the kind of food you'd get at a party with a mediocre caterer or a formal dinner on a cruise ship.  The desserts were mostly without much taste so a bite of each of the mini servings was taken and the rest discarded  The creme brulee was actually liquid..  The cold salads were good, but hardly worth the price of admission.  The crabcake benedict was the best highlight of the day and the only food that really felt like it belonged on a brunch menu.  I don't know that the formula is quite right for brunch - I think it would make more sense as a dinner restaurant, so i'm giving it 3 stars vs. the 2 I feel it deserves. I would add that the current state of the economy makes most of us feel like the douches we've been for the last few years, going to restaurants and bars because of what we think our going there says about us vs. actually having an enjoyable meal/experience with friends.  Being a low-key type who is more comfortable in jeans and a tshirt that allow me room to breathe AND eat a shrimp skewer on occasion, it felt disingenuous to be there.  Next time I'll go for a warmer ambience and a more consistent menu and toss the ""What will people think when I say I ate there?"" notion.",0.9917,0.843,0.138,0.02,0.4678869047619048

2008-12-12,4.0,"So I base my rating on the following... 3 stars for the food, 1 star for the lounge/outdoor area.  Let me start off w/ the food which is good, but not great.  My meal started out very well, as they have an outstanding salad bar w/ focaccia breads, meats/cheeses, and tons of inventive side dish plates and spreads.  Our waiter brought us these little seafood coctail shooters which were quite good as well.  We also received this jalapeno cornbread to our table that was so good i could have eaten that all day.  I tried this cranberry seasonal mixed drink which was awesome, w/ hints of cinnamon and ginger in it.     Now to be honest, the meats were a little disappointing.  There were a few good highlights, like the bottom sirloin, portugese sausage, and glazed chicken.  But the ribs were mediocre, as was one or two of the beef options which were either too salty or too fatty.  They did come around w/ some seared ahi tuna and fried mahi mahi which were pretty good.  In general I thought the selection was a bit limited, and we had to specifically ask for certain items like the beef ribs.  Despite our full stomachs, 4 of us split the graham cracker smores dessert which was outstanding.  There was this great graham cracker crust w/ rich, gooey chocolate and marshmallows inside w/ ice cream and some brittle type of stuff on the outside... outstanding!!  So the lounge/outdoor area, on the other hand, are pretty sweet.  The lounge is small but very inviting w/ the rockin fireplace warming things up and huge projector showing the daily sports events.  During spring/summer you must check out the outdoor space on the second level, it's truly a unique and awesome experience.  Don't forget to get there early because it's starts to fill up fast on the weekends!   I'll def be back for drinks and loungin, but probably not for the food.  Maybe I just can't eat enough meat to make it worth it :)",0.9984,0.704,0.26,0.036,0.5854103343465045

The highlight of the Brazilian Style of service (where they bring the meats and fish to your table on a big skewer) was the Butter Beef.  Tasted like Heaven.  The Mahi Mahi also great.  A lot of oohing and aahing at the table, but not everything was oh-my-gosh.  You have to try each to see what you like, with some more memorable than others.  I liked my Grape Martini.  My wife thought her Lemon Drop Martini was a bit odd tasting. We shared the Butterscotch Bread Pudding which met the expectations of the waitress who described it.  It was a birthday dinner, so one of the Puddings was served with candle on a plate with happy birthday spelled out in chocolate (nice touch). Given the focus on all-you-can-eat here, we may come here for a large group event (from time to time) but not on a regular basis if it's just the two of us.  At least not for the full menu option (about $55, I think).  The bar menu offers a scaled down, plated version of the meats for under $20 and I might opt for that next time.  Beautiful and comfy decor in bar area.",0.9884,0.807,0.149,0.043,0.5132455151685922

So we complained and the manager asked us to come back and said she's ""take care of us"".  The 2nd time back, same thing.  We asked for the manager but she wasn't around so we ended up having to pay again for bad service.  We contacted the BBB and listed reviews on other sites and finally after about a month, another manager contacted us and refunded our credit cards. This place is what it's like when a couple of rich business people get together and build a restaurant off of something currently popular, in this case, Brazilian steakhouses.  I think they neglected the fact that the food should actually taste good and the fact that you go to a restaurant to eat, not sit around, flagging waiters to come to serve you food.

I had a great time.  I showed up early to a dinner party for 25 in the private dining area, so I sat at the bar and had a conversation with some folks there.  The folks were good people, very friendly and open to a conversation with a stranger in their city.  The waitstaff was very nice and when I asked if others from my party had arrived, she did not know the name I gave her, so she went to find the party.  Ultimately the name I had was wrong, but she found the right party by asking the 3 large parties that were being hosted here yesterday evening if they might have guests looking for a different name.  Of course, it didn't hurt that the drinks were tasty. Then, when I finally found the party everyone was just sitting down to dinner, so the Zed451 hostess introduced me to the gentleman who was hosting the event before she walked away.  This is important because I didn't know anyone at the event (I am the out of towner and I had been sent to the event by someone I know from San Francisco, who was not coming).  Whether intentional or not, she made sure I knew someone there before she left - VERY good service. The direction on how the evening would go was great, the food that came around was great the Mushroom/Barley soup was wonderful as were the duck breast and ribs.  The cherry cobbler was fantastic and the bread pudding was quite good as well. Finally, it was a very nice touch when the chef came out with a big smile to say hello, thanking us for the business and asking if we needed anything else.   I would give it a 5 star, because it was quite good and I, perhaps because I am not young enough, did not experience the aforementioned cougars.  My only knock is similar to my knock of  Espetus Churrascaria in San Francisco - the meats are good, but they are not generally the meats I would choose if I were going out for dinner.  I would normally get a filet or a ribeye and neither of these cuts were available (I assume because they are more expensive cuts of meat).",0.9984,0.762,0.218,0.019,0.5825448585231194
2008-08-12,2.0,"There is bad news and good news about my experience at Zed451 First the bad news...this ""one price all you can eat"" menu is very good and a bargin at around $49.  From cheeses to excellent salads and veggies you can eat a little bit of everything.  But the core reason for me  eating at this establishment was for the meat.  For the most part all the meats that were served were dry  except for the duck breast and sirlon....the fish, pork, etc....were all dry and very few were med rare which I requested and was a huge disappointment.  In addition, a wine steward (very young I might add) asked if I wanted to try a Spainish red as I was already having a glass with dinner.  I agreed and she pulled a glass from a table close by....just before the moment of pouring she noticed the glass was dirty and proceeded to get another glass.  At that moment I noticed a lipstick mark on top of the 2nd glass and told her it was also dirty....but she continue to lower the wine glass and I moved the glass at the same time...spilling wine on the table...needless to say this place should have folks polishing silverware and glassware before every opening and throughout the evening which they don't seem to be doing! The good news is that the service it top notch.  I had multiple people consistently inquire to my meal and ask additional questions even though I was by myself.  The next bit of good news is that if you dine you should be able to access the rooftop deck ahead of folks waiting in the bar.  This deck area seems to be one of the best in the city.  Raymond came by during dinner and inquired to when I wanted to access the deck and would look for me when I began to head up to the deck.  He took care of me and my guests to ensure I was seated in a great area.  The cocktail waitress was less than stellar with their service, so I get the impression they are a bit understaffed for that section of the establishment. The place does attract a mostly 30's-40's locals and a good mix of casual and business casual which is quite refreshing as there are few of these places around that are not full of tourist. In conclusion I think Zed451 is a ""good"" place, though at the prices and popularity they lack some very basic and key things I think are important in receiving a higher rating.  They are fixable, though I doubt these gaps will be closed any time soon as the business has no way of receiving feedback unless you do it immediate at the restaurant.  Their website does not provide any such capability.",0.9806,0.843,0.111,0.046,0.5068703703703705
2008-08-11,1.0,"4.5 hours of my life that I won't be able to get back. For some context, I was with a party of 6 sitting at an upstairs round table.  We dropped roughly $140/head and are a fairly laid-back group of people.  I'll get through the positives first, then on to the real story: 1) Pleasant architectural setting 2) Cool rooftop bar 3) Unique drink selection 4) Items at the serve-yourself Harvest Bar section were solid Now...the stuff you should know.  1) Service was horrible.  I'm not even really sure why we had a waitress b/c it took over 1/2 hour to deliver a simple drink and she had absolutely no control over the food being delivered to our table.  Seriously, at one point I just went downstairs to the bar to order.  She smiled. She was nice.  But she really made things worse rather than better.  Oh, and she is the front person to lie to you about the food they are going to serve and how often it will come.   2) Food delivery rarely comes to the 2nd floor.   Take note, over the course of several hours at the table, we saw most items only once...and the ""lower grade"" meats were the only ones to make it back for repeat performances.  We finally saw fish after 2 hours at the table.   Never saw the alleged Seared Tuna or Ono.   When we complained, we were told there really wasn't anything they could do and all the meats came out when they were done cooking.  Whatever that meant... 3) Food was overcooked and of poor quality.  If you can believe it, almost every person at our table agreed that the best option was simply the sausage...if only b/c it was cooked decently.  Lamb was bland and overcooked.  The other meats were mostly overcooked and tough to chew b/c of all the fat.  The duck would have been ok if it wasn't served in portions the size of a penny.   ...I think you get the point here.  It's all about appearances for this joint.  And, I must say, this certainly looks like a place that should be serving a good meal...especially for the price tag.  Sadly, that's all it's got...a pretty outer shell but no substance.  I walked out of there feeling violated.  I just needed a hug.

2008-08-11,5.0,"I spent all of last week extremely keyed up about attending the opening event for this restaurant and after having gone, I can say it DEFINITELY doesn't disappoint on any level. I came in with my friend Jenny A., and was immediately greeted with champagne and a quick tour.   This place is SEXY.  It manages to natural, simple, and inviting without losing a shred of stylish elegance.  Everything from the dark wood of the tables to the fire in the center of the harvest table area, to the lights peaking subtly through the slats that line the walls and ceiling.  And don't get me started on the outdoor area.  It smells like cedar and you can sit with your feet in the grass while looking up at stars and taller buildings.  It's literally and figuratively a breath of fresh air. And there's the FOOD. Harvest tables - as far as I could see, there was one table with a vast array of meats, olives, cheeses, and breads, another one with fondue and vegetables for dipping in the fondue, one with small dessert items, and two with salads.   And we are not talking about your typical salads either.  Their red skin potato salad was unbelievable and I don't even like potato salad! Other highlights would be the balsamic pear salad, the winter melon salad, and the sweet potatoes with ginger maple syrup. Appetizers - they walk around with trays of appetizers and offer them to you.  The best one BY FAR was the goat cheese encrusted lamb, but I was also quite taken with the encrusted sushi roll. MEAT -  Throughout the evening, I referred to the bar where they carve the meat as ""the meat orgy"", and I was really not far off.  You grab a plate, sidle up to the bar, and glide along served a number of sumptuous offerings off of skewers.  My favorites were the garlic steak which was lovely and RARE (there isn't enough rare meat served out there, in my opinion) , the tender and perfectly-seasoned leg of lamb, and the St. Louis style ribs that basically just dropped off the bone.  The only thing there I wasn't terribly impressed with was the salmon, but that's just because I had fallen so deep into eating beef, pork, lamb,and even the chicken, that seafood seemed like it didn't fit in. I can't quite explain it.  It confused me a little though, namely because every other Brazillian style restaurant I've been to, the meat is brought to tables, rather than staying behind the bar area.  Was it this way because that's one of the things Zed 451 does differently or is it just because it was the opening?  I don't really know. It didn't bother me to have to get up to get my meat, but I am simply curious and a little confused. Drinks - I only had the wine and the sangria, but both were lovely.  More amusing was the Patron station upstairs where they would serve you shots with lime then push on this odd little contraption leaving a puff of salt on top of your hand.  I think I need to go back and try some more specialty cocktails before I know what I'm talking about in that regard. Desserts  - The desserts were tiny and magnificent. The little fruit tarts were to die for, as were the small squares of key-lime pie.  I do wish they'd had something other than those teeny truffles in regards to chocolate, because I really can't get enough of chocolate dessert items.  Something like a flour less chocolate cake or a lava cake would have blown my mind.   Okay that covers the food and the environment, but before I'm done shooting off my mouth, let me commend the staff here for being endlessly attentive, friendly, and willing to kid around with you a little.  I enjoyed the meat carver's response to my Amiga Stacey A's assertion that they would be ""best friends"": ""Don't be one of those best friends who takes what they want and forgets about you, then! Come back and take MORE.""  Hopefully this level of service is not just amped up for the opener but is expected on a general level.",0.9979,0.814,0.153,0.034,0.5650067069081153

Okay.  Remember the ""Yadda yadda"" episode of Seinfeld in which Jerry believes that you cannot ""yadda yadda"" sex, and Elaine proves that you can by recounting a date in which the highlight was not the sex but the lobster bisque??  That is ZED 451.  The highlight was the butternut squash soup.  (Remember, this is a Brazilian STEAKhouse.)  The soup was lovely.  Then it was very much downhill.   The vibe was trying very hard to be trendy and cool, but most of the people there did seem to be in from the suburbs for a good time.  Our waiter was pretentious, obviously having consumed the kool aid that management is feeding him, that this is a very hip and trendy place with outstanding food.   He was clearly inexperienced and lacked much polish.  The drinks were over-priced, and the wine list was a yawn.  The food....apart from the soup, it was lousy.  The ""chef-crafted salads (oh please!!  some prep cook made those salads!!) lacked fresh and seasonal ingredients.  (Example: the tomatoes were of the unripe and tasteless variety, although I bought tasty ones from my local farmers market that same week.)  The ""artisan"" cheese and charcheuterie (sp??) station was stocked with selections from a Jewel deli.  The  meat was no better.  Although I did not sample the fish, the other cuts of meat were tough and flavorless.  There was an obvious attempt to make the preparations interesting, but you cannot make great food out of very sub-standard ingredients.    Plus, they did obviously push the cheap stuff (sausage), which wasn't even interesting stuff.   As we lingered over our dessert, we were not-so-gently nudged out the door so that a private event could take over the space.  It was quite rude. Overall, I cannot believe that we payed $50/each plus drinks, dessert and tip for that stuff.   One final note: the music was awful.  It was as though management decided that its target audience - late-20's/30's - just LOVE Elton John, and so they placed a lot of it.  Too much.   Don't waste your time and your money.  There are so many great restaurants in this city that do interesting things with good-quality ingredients.  Don't be like lemming following the pack (do lemmings travel in packs??) over the [culinary] cliff!",0.9851,0.788,0.137,0.075,0.5005000000000001
2008-07-01,5.0,"Hip decor/ambiance (5), very good food (4.5) and great service (4.5). I live across the street from Zed 451 so I've been watching the construction take place for over a year -- waiting for it to open and hoping it would be good. Thankfully, it didn't disappoint. After a quick tour of the place, I realized why it took so long to build. They completely gutted the old restaurant (another Brazilian steakhouse - Sal & Carvao - that went out of business) and created an incredibly warm, hip, and zen-like atmosphere. Just inside the door to the right is a zen rock garden - very chill. The lower level bar is enormous and has some funky tables and chairs. The main dining room on the first floor is nicely organized so the tables aren't on top of each other. The ""harvest bar"" buffet area takes up more than half of the main floor dining room. There are also several private rooms on the first floor and another one on the second floor. The place is huge! Probably the highlight of the whole place, though, is the rooftop patio bar, which isn't that big but has lots of great seating. The place is always packed (there are lines around the block just to go to the patio) and it has a very L.A./Miami ""see and be seen"" vibe to it. OK, on to the food... I admit that I was very skeptical about the no menu/Brazilian steakhouse theme to the place (I've only eaten at Fogo once and I got sick I was so full), and this IS very similar, but Zed has a bit of a different feel to it. The ""harvest bar"" offers a selection of 25+ different salads, cheeses, breads, etc. - each with their own dipping sauce. I tried about 10 different things and they were all really good (favorites were the chilled ravioli, the peaches, and the apple coleslaw). I tried not to fill up, as I knew that the onslaught of meat would soon be coming. And once you put your ""river stone"" beside your plate (same idea as the red light/green light system of all the Brazilian steakhouses, only a little classier), the parade of meat just keeps on coming. Best cuts were the garlic steak, the lamb chops, and a special duck confit that was out of this world. I went with my family and they insisted on ordering dessert (oh, the humanity), and they were all really tasty. I'm a chocolate fan, but my favorite was the cherry cobbler, followed by the skillet cookie. The service was very attentive and had a lot of personality -- not stuffy at all. Our main waiter was extremely friendly and had a lot of passion for his job. He didn't do the best job of explaining the whole process of how the meal worked, but we easily figured it out. The one thing they never explained that I still don't understand is the ""seafood"" upgrade they list on the menu (lobster, clams, etc - no explanation of what this was, nor was this ever offered to us). The chefs who brought the meats were incredibly knowledgeable and did such a great job explaining their dishes that you just had to try what they were serving.Our reservation was early, so as the night went on the service dropped off a bit (I had to wait 10 minutes for the glass of wine I ordered with dessert).  Overall, I'd give this place about a 4.5, but I really hope they do well so I'm going to round up and give them a 5. While this isn't the type of place you'd want to go on a regular basis, it's a great splurge every once in a while.",0.9951,0.83,0.127,0.043,0.4927792356896835
2008-06-30,4.0,"I went to Zed451 on a Thursday night several weeks ago. It was probably the first, super hot summer night in Chicago so EVERYONE was out in search of roof top action. The line to get to the roof at Zed was a little ridiculous. A bouncer was only allowing small groups in at a time, assumingly to stay within capacity guidelines. I only visited for cocktails, not dinner. The crowd was totally mixed... young professionals, the ""older but still trying to look younger"" folks, hipsters, you name it... they were there that night. The drinks are pretty darn yummy but way over priced. Unfortunately, you're paying for the phenomenal views and beautiful ambiance. That's okay with me occasionally as long as I have a great time.

Now I am not the biggest fan of the Brazilian style steakhouses, but I live a couple of blocks away from Zed and Fogo, so we have been to Fogo and now we had to try Zed. What a difference of food quality. The servers/chefs were so much more personable and knowledgeable.  Overall, the experience was great and the price is more then fair. We had a great experience. One slightly negative note, our front server (tall blonde guy) was a bit pretentious about his own food and wine knowledge, which was not that impressive. He actually talked to the table slowly as if we were children trying to educate us. We told him after the second encounter that all three of us were in the f&b biz, but he went on to talk to us like we did not know anything.

2008-06-08,4.0,"Went here for dinner last night and developed a love-hate relationship with Zed 451. This place is actually more like 3 different places on a crowded Saturday night because a distinct line forms for each. You have the dining guests and the wait for the table, you have the main floor bar and the line out front for those trying to get in, and finally you have a rooftop garden- which we didn't get to see because there was a separate line outside on the side of the building for that!  I suggest if you want to dine here DO NOT go late on a Saturday night. The lines, the crowds, the 20+ minute wait for a drink during the 30+ minute wait for your table reservation and no where to sit is all too much for me. Not to mention the crowd was the low 20's miniskirt varietal. AND you cant get near that darn garden. Once at your table service still lacks. It'd be nice if they took your plate away after the salad bar, or even offered you a different one while dining churrasco style, but they don't. (Unlike Fogo, who has it together- maybe bc theyre servers are actually over 22 years old) The 20+ minute wait for a drink continues once at your table as well. The chefs with skewers are slow to arrive, while your server seems to rush you to place your ""rock"" back in the middle (to signify your done) before you have even gotten a chance to sample all the fare.  However, the food and the ambiance is why im giving this place with overall horrible service 4 stars. I cant really describe the interior, you just have to go see for yourself. Very beautiful. The salad bar blows any other out of the water, just when you thought Fogo had the best, try this one. My favorite part- everything in the Harvest Table had its own dressing or sauce! The meat skewers were more ""world barbeque"" than Brazilian style. They differ from the traditional Brazilian churrasco's- they come by with salmon and parmesan crusted pork chops and mango ribs. Their beef cannot compete with the quality of that offered in the tradition churrascos, but their variety and unique spin make it a gem of its own. I sampled tons of really delicious food in a beautiful restaurant, and I will be back on an off day to try and check the entire place out and hope for some actual service.

2008-05-07,2.0,"OK, some of my review start out like this...ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? and this one is one of those for sure! I went to Zed451 tonight based upon a recommendation from a colleague.  I had a former client with me who was looking to host a corporate event for 150 people with a budget of 80K in November.  We went into Zed451 tonight and asked to see the space for 150 people for a buy out of certain spaces.  For any professional person this should have been a clue to at least be on your best behavior. The manager on duty did a great job of showing us the space and WE LOVED IT!  We looked at Trump, Martini Park, HOB, etc., and we really liked this space for its unique design and cozy decor.  Next, we had to try the food.  The manager asked us if we prefer ed the bar of the dining room.  Being that the dining room was all a fixed menu (much like the former spot brazzaz) we opted for the bar.   Once we got to the bar, we were shocked by how utterly stupid the bar staff was.  One chubby and less cute bartender seemed to know her ABC's but the skinny, fake boob bartender clearly still had to count on her fingers.  Here is how bad it was....on the bar menu there are THREE ITEMS, WE ASKED FOR A DESCRIPTION and she could not produce ONE ANSWER!  NOT ONE.   I wanted to know more about the cheese plate and the butcher block (and trust me, neither one is complicated) she was not just clueless, she told me one was meat and the other was cheese.  When I asked what kind, she said, ""it changes"" and then smiled at me as if that was acceptable.  I made her go get someone who could speak in full sentences. We ordered the wine flight and both the cheeses and the meat.  Both girls behind the bar were very smiley and polite, I must give them that.  The wine list is OK, don't let that giant wine room in front with the burning candle fool you, it is not a top caliber wine list.  And, I dare you to ask them what the candle is for, I guarantee NOT ONE person will be able to answer.   As the night went on, and it was getting late, the wait staff started to drift into the bar area and sit at the bar to do their homework.  The guys sitting next to me were clearly employed by the restaurant as was the guy sitting 2 seats away.  The bartenders completely ignored us, completely, and continued LONG AND DRAWN OUT conversations with their co-workers.  The guys on my left, in suits, were either district managers or something of the like, they should be  fired.  The server doing his homework in the lounge, fired.  The two bartenders who completely ignored everyone in the bar all night long and spoke to their co-workers, they will likely starve due to NO tips because they're not working and that bar will make NO money.  I had to flag down a server to order a second drink.  I have to say that unless this place pulls their act together, they will shut down just like the last spot did.  The staff is from Iowa and belongs in Iowa.  HERE IS THE WORST PART....so when our bill was presented, it was for $22.00 which we knew was wrong.  We asked, ""is this our bill"" and the answer came to us by a third party, he had never waited on us until our check arrived, he said, ""yes.""  We knew this bill was incorrect but we also knew that the bartenders had been ignoring us for 30 minutes  and we could even get their attention to pay the bill.  After presenting us with a check for $22 (which we knew was wrong) they charged our card and presented a receipt for $57.00.  I flipped out.   The correct way to handle such a debacle on your behalf is to approach the person and apologize for your mistake, accept responsibility and let them know that they owe more - which we already did know.  But instead, they pulled the bait and switch.  When I questioned big  boobie girl, she said, ""in our defense, we are dumb and we don't care.""  OK...she didn't say that, but she may as well have.",-0.9041,0.807,0.097,0.096,0.4869451170298626

2008-04-26,4.0,"So I have had the opportunity to visit the newest incarnation of this space both during it's opening pre party as well as for a ""regular"" visit.  Zed 451 is a Churrascaria (Brazilian steakhouse) which for me- feels a bit like a ""vertical buffet"" and not my favorite way to have a meal- but if you like that sort of thing- then Zed is for you. This location is beautiful.  If only the space could talk as it could tell the tale of what it has been in past lives.  I know it has been apartments where a fire took off the top floor (look for the original window located in the bar), other restaurants and now Zed 451.  This reincarnation surely has to be its best.   The bar area has several fireplaces, areas to mingle with friends or to escape with that ""special someone"".  You can climb the stars to the roof top bar- feels like it could be my new favorite place (note:  as of this writing- they are still waiting for their liquor license to be able to serve up there)  There are pine seating areas and they've even planted an area with grass to relax and take in the views of the city.  The large skylight looks down on the main bar below. I like their specialty drinks.  My two favorites are the cucumber sage martini, or the margarita with the chipotle salt on the rim.  If you order a drink on the rocks- they actually will chisel the ice from these giant blocks into your glass.  Unnecessary but theatrical all the same! This is a one price- all you can eat- buffet, done in an interesting way.  The ""harvest table"" is where all the salad, soups, breads and cheeses are that change seasonally.  There is also a wide array of desserts that you can choose from if you have room after consuming more meat than you would ever imagine! With meat as their specialty- you can bet that the Parmesan crusted pork, the lamb chops, and all the various forms of steak (sirloin, tenderloin, with garlic, etc) are delicious and all were really rare which was appreciated by this carnivore although the person I was with really wanted everything more done.  The only thing that should have been more done was the salmon on the night we were there.  It was uncooked in the center. The service is quite good- in all aspects from the valet who quickly grabs your car (there have to be at least 8 of them standing out front) to the women who open the doors and welcome you back to the servers- all were accommodating and appeared to want my business.  I also like that a few of the people that I met at the opening party- actually remembered me as I sat at the bar and had a couple of those great margaritas. This place gets my vote for the bar alone.  Those cushy leather chairs at the bar will be seeing me frequently and once that roof top area opens- look out!  As for the restaurant- it unfortunately is not going to be a place where I come back to on a regular basis.  It's just not my favorite kind of dining experience.  But don't let that stop you from trying it.",0.9976,0.808,0.158,0.034,0.5073056059167171
2008-04-26,3.0,"Very nice looking restaurant from the inside.  They definitely spent some bucks remodeling this place. Service is a bit a slow, which some people may actually prefer as it is unlimited meat.  One knock I have on Fogo is they keep coming and coming with the meat that you feel bombarded.  Zed is a bit more laid back in the regard.  My favorite items were the parmesan crusted pork, chimmichurri chicken wings, and the sausage.  The salmon, well, tasted like salmon.  Nothing really stood out at the harvest table and I thought the sides were bland. I still prefer Fogo, particularly when it comes to the sides and the variety of beef.  It seemed like Zed only had 2 or 3 different types of beef while I think Fogo has more.  Also, Zed has no filet, which is a major negative in my book.",0.8399,0.853,0.108,0.04,0.5260416666666666
2008-04-23,5.0,"I got to go to a practice dinner last week and to the opening event. I will start first with the build out.  As someone who owns a restaurant, I can tell you some of the most amazing things about the build out are things that only operators would even see.  Every aspect of this restaurant was built to not only be aesthetically pleasing but also to lead to better customer service.  The decor is rich but not in the traditional manner that you would think of rich....I normally would think of the RL buildout as rich but this modern rich....Walnut Bars but with unique shapes and designs and accents.  They have put in three of the coolest fireplaces plus they have an open flame in the middle of the main dining room.  The floor is one of the coolest wood floors I have ever seen.  ( I want it in my home)   The most amazing part is the Rooftop deck above the lounge.  There will be no better place to spend a nice summer night in Chicago this summer...(we'll have to see what Trump does in '09 but the bar has been set)  This place blows away the Nomi and Conrad offerings.. There is even an area with a grass seating area....and one of those cool fireplaces is on the roof. To the food: I was able to try the food in that will be available in the lounge and the dining room. The food in the dining room is in two parts.  The first part they call their Harvest Table.  To equate this to a salad bar does it no justice.  I am the high cholestoral meat eater but I could have an entire meal of just the harvest table.  Things like vanilla infused green beans, grilled pineapples, sweet potatoes,  an antipasto section, gourmet soups, potato salads....almost everything is paired with a special dressing/sauce that are things most people have never heard of....and they match the item perfectly. The second part for lack of better term I am going to call Chef service.  It will remind you of the brazilian style service but the people serving you the food are the chefs that actually cooked the food.  Favorites: the goat cheese encrusted rack of lamb, Bottom sirloin with an amazing marinaide, and the pork......for the non-meat eaters i also had mahi mahi and salmon. The Bar food was at the level of avec.....the garlic mussels were amazing...fondue was sooo good and fun!! They call the drinks the Liquid Market.  I tried most of them.  Big fan of the Ginger Bourbon lemonade and the Blackberry Mojito.",0.9976,0.813,0.169,0.018,0.5357023809523811
2008-04-21,4.0,"I went to the opening party last Friday, and while I left this restaurant happy and completely stuffed with delicious food (and shots of Patron!), I'm going to hesitate on a 5-star rating until I go back on a night that isn't the opening. The experience was incredible, and every single staff member (of which there appeared to be thousands) was attentive and pleasant, but I can't help but wonder if everyone was trying extra hard to please the opening-night crowd. That said, wow.  I like good food. I especially like good food in abundance.  The ""harvest table"" is gigantic, and it's so loaded with food that you could easily forget about the meat and fill up on fruits, veggies, pasta, hors d'oeuvres, and desserts. I'm moderately obsessed with the red-wine poached pears (with crumbled cheese, candied walnuts, and balsamic vinegar sauce) and I plan on trying in vain to recreate them at home. Other favorite harvest table selections include the pineapples ""Madagascar,"" the spicy apples, the sweet potato bits, and the chilled ravioli with pesto sauce. I'm not a big dessert person, but the tiny fruit tarts are excellent. As far as the churrascaria element goes: the meat is tasty, and the sauces/marinades/spices are very well-selected, but I felt like there were fewer options presented at any given time than at other similar restaurants. My friends and I went up to the carving station at different times, and rarely got the same kind of meat. While variety is great, I missed out on some of the meats because of bad timing. Definite must-trys: goat-cheese-encrusted lamb (heaven!), blue point oysters, garlic steak, roast lamb. The outdoor terrace is quite nice - there's a delightful outdoor bar and a little area with fresh green grass and benches that smell like cedar. I wonder how long that grass will continue to look nice? My friends and I left Zed451 extremely full. I felt compelled to taste everything, and re-sample my favorites (those poached pears? on every single plate I had), and I almost had to be rolled out the door. Next time, I'm going to have to learn about moderation! I'll definitely be back, and it will be interesting to see how different (if at all!) Zed451 is on a normal evening.",0.9979,0.724,0.227,0.049,0.5603641456582633
2008-04-21,4.0,"Disclosure: I've been heavily bribed due to attending their epic opening night blow out extravaganza... All in all, a vast improvement of Sal Y Carvao, which I happened to like anyway.  I'm really not an ""all you can eat"" kind of person, because I generally would prefer to spend $30 on a nice steak instead of $50 on all you can eat in quantity. The employees were spectacular.  Everyone from the expediters, to the waiter, to the managers came around to chat.  Gina--the events coordinator--was very nice and helpful at explaining a lot of things...  We asked our waiter if we could get some oysters (they were circulating), and a minute or two later the manager came to say ""I hear you're looking for oysters"" ...  Then they subsequently came out.    They have about 30 full time chefs on staff now, and each of them each day get their assigned skewers and kind of have free will to do with it what they want.  So potentially there's a chance for innovation in food that you won't see elsewhere.   The food itself was very good, and in comparison to other Brazilian Steakhouses, probably unbeatable.  The meats themselves were OK.  The St. Louis style ribs kind of were ""ehh"" ... I waited in a long line to get some lamb, but he took it away just as I was approaching to throw it on for a few more minutes.  Then came some beef, which was good.    I had some encrusted lamb that was above average as well.  And some pork.  and some sausages.  Nothing I had was really below average except for the BBQ ribs. The uber upscale food bar/buffet thing is what really sets this place apart.. they had a lot of great options on it.  There was a fondue station that was really great food.  The side vegetables were a lot more creative than you'd see anywhere else... My favorite thing in the whole place was probably the pineapples that were lightly roasted in brown sugar/orange juice served with peppercorns.  It was an oddly great combination and I kept going back for more. The desserts were kind of ""ehh"" and definitely not their strong point from what I had.  Every time I walked by they had something different out though, so it might have also had to do with what I had. The price point for their very corporate sounding ""full experience"" is $50.  Which is on par with what others are charging, probably potentially a better value even. I had my first Sidecar at Sal Y Carvao, so in an attempt of nostalgia and just to keep the bartender on his toes, I ordered one.  Well, attempted to.. The first guy was stumped so he passed it off to another more experienced bartender, but he said he didn't have the cognac that went in it.  So he said to come back to that bar in a bit and they'd have it...   I ended up getting a few Ginger and Bourbon.  The first tasted completely different than the second.   It could definitely take on the margarita as a popular not too manly drink the way they made it.   Both were a little on the too syrupy side, but for a single drink it was pretty good.  Ginger is one of my favorite things in a drink though. They also flew Greg Gauthier, who is a wine maker at two small producing wineries in Napa and Sonoma.  Bouchaine and Gauthier Cellars are the two wines.   I really enjoyed the Bouchaine Pinot Noir, and having it poured directly by the wine maker was a nice extra touch they put on for the party.  We sat and talked to him for a good half hour, very nice guy....   Outside of him getting the word out about his wines, I believe Zed451 will be his main restaurant serving his wines in Chicago.   Far and away the best part of this place is the interior.  It's an amazingly detailed massively huge place inside.  The first level is divided into a lounge area and a large seating area.  The second level is designed for very large events, and that's also where the roof top bar is.  The roof top bar is pretty amazing, I can't think of anywhere else in Chicago that really compares.  Their decor budget must have been absurdly huge.  (The sliding pocket doors in two of the bathrooms are annoying to lock... or not lock in my case, I just gave up) On the main dining level they have a chef's bar... something I recently sat at in another restaurant, but haven't really seen in Chicago yet.  If I go back, I'm definitely dining at the chef's bar!  (The people sitting at it for the opening event were over the top annoying though!).  This could possibly be the best table in Chicago!   And I know other places have ""chefs tables"" but that's totally not the same thing. They mysteriously ran out of the gift cards just as I was leaving... Well that's what they said, then someone who walked out just after me ended up getting one?  :( Initially they're open for brunch on weekends and dinner only, no lunch. I'd rate this place a 5 star relative to other Brazilian steakhouses... perhaps 4 relative to other restaurants.  But if Brazilian or all you can eat is what you're in the mood for, this is the place to try.",0.9992,0.828,0.154,0.018,0.5218348623853211
2008-04-20,5.0,"Slight Update: This isn't worth a full blown ""update"" but I came here again in September just for drinks on the rooftop, I think it was a Wednesday or Thursday night.  It was crowded but we still managed to find a really nice table in the grassy area (most of the crowd was standing- I think it was some sort of convention).  Service was slow slow slow, and they took a lot of the drinks I adored from opening night off the menu.  Make that ALL of them.  But the drinks are still good.  They are weak, which, not gonna lie, was probably for the best (this was a second date, and on the first date, I got inexcusably hammered at Motel Bar).  There wasn't a wait to get upstairs or anything, and once the rooftop closed, the lounge area was a great place to continue the evening.  So I suppose my overall 5 star review treats this mostly as a night spot, more so than a restaurant.  Although I still remember liking their food from opening night. ORIGINAL: I was really blown away by the opening Friday night.  This place is unlike any I've been to in Chicago.  I wasn't really expecting to be quite this impressed, knowing it was a chain of sorts, but don't let that, or any preconceived notions about Brazillian steakhouses, sway you The food was just phenomenal.  Unlike the Fogo's and Brazzazz's out there (ok I've only been to Fogo but whatever), they've got much more than a salad bar option for non-red-meat eaters.  For one thing, they come around with options like mahi-mahi (I think, now I'm blanking on whether that's what it was, but just know that it was GOOD), lamb, some sort of sushi roll option, and on and on (so no one is carting around a big slab of cow carcass, which frankly just grosses me out- I like my food with a little presentation :)).  On top of that, instead of a salad bar, they have their ""harvest tables"" (fancy talk for buffet).  I could get my money's worth on this part alone- there were so many things to choose from! I loved the bread and cheese portion too.  And while we managed to not take full advantage of the dessert section (it seemed to have disappeared part way through the night, but maybe we just hi it at a bad time when they were trying to keep the dinner options more available for the enormous crowd).  But the coconut truffle I had- could have filled a plate up with those and called it a day :) (I think it is comparably prced to Fogo for dinner as well- I'd pick this ANYDAY) The space itself is beautiful.  As the others so far have said- they clearly spent a lot of money to make this a place you don't want to leave.  to your right is a great lounge area with some high tops surrounding the perimeter, and some benches and chairs laid out in front of the so very cool fireplaces (seriously, if nothing else, go to check this out- I want one!!!).  There's even this little rock garden set off to one end with a few benches offering more privacy.  The dining room is also just gorgeous- it manages to be trendy and elegant at the same time- the designer is brilliant.  I personal just can't stand things that are too trendy and would rather have a touch of comfort, and this hits it perfectly.  I imagine that the rooftop is going to be the area's crown jewel for the summer- if you work in the loop or river north, your colleagues will be trying to make this their after work drink spot.  If they'd had their liquor license for up there yet, I imagine we would have been up there for a good chunk of the night. (I'm guessing this wil be bar only and not food up here?) The drinks are also amazing- and the staff's recommendations were dead on- the ginger bourbon mix that we were told we had to try, despite any confusion at that combo, was incredible, the strawberry kiwi martini was freshly muddled to perfection, and waitresses were coming around with a fabulous white sangria.  There is a wine tasting room that was reserved for private parties, and the bar in the main dining room had its own lovely collection.   I know a lot of people think about the all-you-can-eat restaurants and figure its a night of trying to stuff yourself silly on lower quality food just to feel like the cost was justified.  But seriously, this was so different, it was all really good, and I don't think I'd ever feel compelled to eat a ton just to feel like it was worth it, because the quality was there.  Frankly a night out for sushi isn't any cheaper.  Here you have the added element of getting to try out smaller portions of so many options (or fill yourself with one if you'd like!), rather than having to decide up front what you entire meal will be, and to have them brought out to you by an amazingly friendly staff that clearly cares about service I will most certainly be back!",0.9993,0.786,0.174,0.04,0.5608028792912513
2008-04-20,2.0,"I accompanied a friend with press connections to the opening of Zed451 on Friday night.  I was curious, as I'd found a training manual for a busser that read more like an etiquette pamphlet for a coat check boy at a sex club. This place completely defied my expectations - I expected the food to be unbelievable and the staff and atmosphere to be unbearably pretentious.  I could not have been more wrong! The food was the pinnacle of mediocrity.  Some of the flavour combinations were just plain odd, the pastries (while beautifully presented) had as much sugar as a Hostess cupcake and only slightly more flavour.  The vegetables were bland even when drenched in the ""creative"" sauces they were served with.  The meats ranged from okay to disappointing.  I do not eat red meat, but I partook of the pork ribs (rough and chewy, with a bland barbecue sauce I can only describe as ""clotty""), the salmon (so rare I couldn't eat it most of it, even though I'm a fan of rare fish), the chicken (dry, but spiced nicely), the sausage (by far the highlight - spicy and juicy), and the parmesan-encrusted pork (I kid you not - it tasted like day-old chicken breaded in White Cheddar Cheese-Its - which is not to say it wasn't tasty, just seemed like an item more suited for the menu of Harold's). The two stars are for the myriad of sexually attractive employees who were surprisingly friendly and attentive.

2008-04-19,4.0,"After leaving the newest member of Chicago's tony steakhouse club, I could only think of one word to describe Zed451. Inimitable. I knew that Zed451's opening party would make for an unforgettable evening.  I smartly began my adventure with a gorgeous man in tow and was instantly greeted and seduced with a glass of champagne. Beginnings are beautifully simple. Admittedly, I didn't know much about Zed walking in.  Though touted as a contemporary steakhouse, Brazil's heavy-handed influence clearly shines through in the rotisserie-roasted meats.  What's a fantastic exercise in sensory tantalization?  Eliminate the menu.  Let's wait and see what the chefs (yes, chefs!) will bring out next.  A hot premise for sure. The chefs' wild imaginations result in a meeting of brazen flavor and complementary sauces.  Rack of lamb encrusted with goat cheese, citrus-soaked chunks of salmon, zesty chimichurri chicken legs, tender St. Louis-style ribs and more.  The ""harvest tables"" boast an extensive spread of sides ranging from artisanal cheeses to chilled ravioli to crisp bites of wedge salad.   If the cocktail lounge were a woman, she'd be a siren.  Plenty of voluptuous curves in the design and liberal does of blonde wood lend the space a drop-dead sexy but sophisticated feel.  And, there's a fireplace elevating that incandescent glow. As for the drinks, the blackberry mojito is honestly my new favorite designer cocktail. Refreshing yet slightly sweet and a smidgen tart.  Loved the texture that the fresh blackberries brought to the mix. The staff went out of their way to ensure that our experience was top-notch.  And I'm talking about the kind of service that eliminates the ""feel-guilty"" typically associated with being spoiled.  A busy chef had no qualms about leaving his post to find us some silverware. I can't wait to return once Zed's nabbed their liquor license for the rooftop lounge.
