2015-11-22,3.0,"I really wish that I could give this place a good review, but for me it really comes down to the food, and what I got wasn't really something I can endorse.  I came here on a Saturday night around 11PM, to refuel while out on the Milwaukee bar strip - the person taking my order was very helpful and glad to explain the menu. Basically, choose a protein and then choose the veggies and other mix-ins. I got a shaved pork doner, and started to add veggies and sauces, then waited for it to come. There were two mix-ups - first, their credit card machine was having issues, and since they couldn't get it to work, the meal was free. A plus for this, I certainly can't complain - although on the other hand, I had already begun to eat before they gave up on the credit card, so I think their only alternative was to send me on a quest for an ATM due to their error, which probably would not be a good customer service choice. Second, the veggies I chose to order were not the ones that came as part of my meal, but the credit card problem was still ongoing, so I just decided to let this slide.  Unfortunately, the food that came was just OK. The pulled pork didn't have any of that fatty, rich goodness that you hope for with pork, and the sides and sauces didn't make up for this. I liked the space, and the server was nice, but besides me the place was nearly empty, and i certainly didn't feel that what I got was worth the ~$10 after tax that it would cost. There are plenty of places in this area where $6 will get you a more satisfying taco/burrito meal - it's nice that you can grab a good craft beer here with your doner, but I don't think this compensates for the negative. This is a pass for now.",0.9971,0.723,0.231,0.046,0.5446693121693121
2015-11-02,5.0,"I think this place is great! The sandwiches are super tasty and the sauerkraut baked beans are possibly made with crack, I have to order 2. Authentic? Can't say for myself as I have never been to Turkey. They are, however, authentically delicious, made from good stuff, and a steal for $8, the staff is cool and it feels healthy and the balance is great...so, go. If you go to chipotle and the like, switch it up, support what they are doing here, it's legit",0.9678,0.718,0.25,0.032,0.7395833333333333
2015-10-18,2.0,"Drunk food for drunk people.  I made the mistake of not being drunk, and I thought the food was barely average. If this place is associated with The Radler, they should be embarrassed.  The neat was flavorless, the topping were bland, and the bread wasn't even warm.  And I was the only person in there at 10PM.  People were friendly and the place was clean, but I don't think that's enough to get me to visit again.",-0.2342,0.802,0.075,0.124,0.7533333333333333

2015-08-15,2.0,"As others have said, if you're expecting real German doner here, you're going to be disappointed. The meat may be spit roasted, but it is definitely not the somewhat crispy thinly shaved kind you expect. There's no traditional toppings of onion, tomato, or red cabbage. They do have the options of garlic sauce, harissa, and yogurt. That aside, I just didn't think the durum doner was very good. It was very soggy and the strongest flavor was the feta cheese. Disappointed for sure.",0.905,0.724,0.188,0.088,0.5880808080808081
2015-08-09,3.0,"When i heard there was a döner kebab place opening in Chicago, i was ecstatic. I had had döner kebabs in Germany when i was a kid so i was pretty eager to see how this place compared. Overall, i was pretty disappointed. It does not offer beef, lamb, shredded cabbage with spicy sauce, basically nothing you would expect from a typical Turkish kebab.  While the food was well prepared, it was nothing terribly special. It honestly seemed like an underwhelming chipotle experience while paying the same amount of money. There was a dearth of options on how to make the kebab. I read an article on this place and how it prides itself on being a cheap place to eat. Two kebabs and one drink cost $20. While that might be cheap for Chicago standards, it's certainly not what I expected as ""cheap"". Two stars deducted for my döner dreams being stepped on, but it maintains the three stars for its quality of food that they *do* offer.   Overall, decent effort, DAS Radler, but maybe consider installing a ""suggestions box"".",0.8733,0.852,0.116,0.032,0.5723015873015874
2015-08-04,3.0,"I've been going to their sister restaurant The Radler and I enjoyed it, so I was extremely excited when I heard that the same owners are opening a Döner restaurant. Boy did we get disappointed.  To give a little history, I was born and grew up in Germany, so I've had plenty of Döners in my life. It's a German-Turkish street food that consists of meat that's thinly sliced off a spit, stuffed inside of pita/ flatbread with various vegetable toppings and a yoghurt or spicy sauce. Although it has Turkish roots, the Turkish guest workers in Germany perfected it and made it popular. There are more Döner stands in Berlin than there are in Istanbul and it's a perfect snack after a night of drinking.  Which is exactly why and when we ended up at DAS. My friend who came with me was stationed in Germany in the military and also had plenty of exposure to the original Döner. We drove through half of the city (yes, we had a designated driver) to get some Döner after our beers. After finding relatively easy street parking, I was quite impressed with the decorations of the place and it definitely looks nice. But then it came to ordering and I was surprised to see certain items on the menu (i.e. they have mushrooms, which definitely don't belong on a Döner), but OK, maybe some people enjoy it. We ordered the traditional style (or what we thought would be the traditional style) and of course Bitburgers (German beer) and sat down. A few minutes later the food arrived and our faces couldn't be more surprised. What we expected to be a traditional Döner, was some puffy flatbread wrap. The food itself was pretty good, but again, tasted nothing like a Döner. We finished our food and beers and while we were stuffed, we didn't leave happy. Not that the food is bad (it was actually quite good), but it was the disappointment of the false advertising. Don't call it Döner when it is far from being one. I would go back for the tasty German beer, the fun atmosphere and maybe have food again once it's called something else than Döner.",0.9744,0.825,0.129,0.046,0.5500440917107584

They were both huge and tasty, but I really liked the chicken. As far as sides go, the potato salad and tabbouleh were a little bland, but the sauerkraut was amazing.",0.9397,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.7986111111111112
