We were seated near the open air kitchen and not even 45 minutes into our meal, the manager approached us and told us several guests complained about how loud we were and shhhsed us. It was so embarrassing. I couldn't be more disappointed how this was handled.  There might have been three tables in the same space as us. We were there celebrating a 40th birthday, not a 21st. Meaning we might have been a little loud, but not intrusive. There are many acceptable options on how to resolve a situation like this, but sadly the manager on duty made us feel unwanted and was just rude and we left.

2016-07-04,1.0,"Food 3-1/2* Service 1/2* On our last day in Chicago, my fiancée and I finally decided to try brunch at the restaurant in our awesome hotel, Loews in downtown. We had originally made a pact to only dine at places with 4* plus Yelp ratings while we explored the city, but having such great experiences everywhere else we had a feeling that we couldn't go wrong.  Upon entering we both felt the décor and smells coming from the kitchen were quite nice and we were wondering why we hadn't given it a chance earlier. However, 10 minutes after being seated and with no server to be found, the sinking feeling started to kick in. When our server finally showed up to take our drink orders we'd actually had enough time to decide on what we wanted for brunch. But his visit was so brief that we had to wait 5 more minutes all while watching a very nice young gentleman pay much needed attention to the table on my right, while our guy did a disappearing act. When out orders were finally placed, it was yet another 25 minutes or do before the food arrived, but this time it was a being delivered by a totally new face. I must admit that the food was quite tasty to both of us but for the prices that are charged you'd think that the service would be somewhat on par. After he delivered or drinks and took our orders the only other time we saw our original server was when he hastily refilled our water glasses, without making eye contact, asking us if we needed anything else, or how our food came out. Then we waited at least another 10 minutes for our check, which was delivered by a hostess who must have been alerted by another of the servers about the dissatisfied looks on our faces. Totally unacceptable for a dining experience in a hotel like Loews and at the costs that this place charges. But we made sure not to let this Rural Society experience put a sour note at the end of a visit to the windy city that was so friendly and fun. So when we got to the airport, we made sure to tip our friendly and polite cab driver the extra money that was withheld from our ghostly server.

First off, ORDER THE LAMB CHOPS!  They are grilled to perfection in the open kitchen and come with great flaky sea salt.  Other dishes worth trying: (1) The octopus carpaccio with malbec chips-- the octopus is sliced really thin and the chips give a nice crunch to the appetizer. (2) The dry age prime NY Steak.  Again, good grilling and good flavor.   You can skip the saffron pasta-- it came with only a few small clams and it all stuck together (though this may have been because it sat in the window for a while).   I unfortunately took off a star for the service.  Both times we came we had to wait a long time to get our food.  The second time we went, we sat right next to the kitchen and could tell they were having a hard time coordinating the timing so the whole table was ready at the same time.  I ordered the saffron pasta when my boyfriend ordered the lamb chops and I watched my pasta sadly sit in the window under the heat lamp for 10 minutes before the lamb was done.  Our waiter both times was very quirky for lack of better word.  They were awkward when they spoke to us and both times we ordered wine, the waiter spilled our wine when pouring it.  Finally, I'd warn you that if you don't like a smoky deep wood smell while you eat, this may not be the place for you.  But if you don't mind that, aren't in a hurry, and want a nice quiet meal with cool decorations around you, check this place out!",0.9602,0.837,0.11,0.053,0.5719614512471654

It made for a stiff dining experience instead of checking out this chef's interpretation of Argentinian food. Berkshire Pork Chop - They use a Sous Vide; which is a great restaurant trick to get food out quickly that would otherwise take too long. They have it set too high so that the only way you can get a good sear on it after taking it out, is to over cook it.  So, when I asked for mine at a specific temp, they couldn't get any color on it because the souse vide was set at my preferred temp.  That said, it's not a deal breaker, just disappointing for a higher end place. The menu was way too limited to get a taste of Argentinian food, and nothing was a home run, but still good food. If you compare this to Rio's in Addison, it's night and day. There, the waiters are friendly, informative, and the menu is a great representation of the variety of flavors of South America.

I personally had asked for the Bife Chorizo with a side of mushrooms. When the orders came out, they did not come out at the same time. So everyone ate at different times. When I finally got my order, I could not describe what I got, but it was no ribeye. It was a $40+ cut of meat that I could not describe. Waiter assured me it was a ribeye. It was sliced up ( which is fine. I a lot of high end restaurants do that), but if the menu says ribeye, that is what I expect. I can tell you this, Bife de chorizo y really supposed to be a sirloin strip steak, so the menu is completely misleading with their description. The taste was ok, but nothing great. I never got my mushrooms and one of my friends never got her meal. She cancelled her food after realizing she would be the only one left at the table eating. The waiter was terrible. We had initially asked for separate checks, and the waiter said it was not possible. That we would have to figure it out once we got the final bill. You can imagine figuring out who ate what with that many people. It took us 45 min. Not to mention they tried charging us for my friends dinner that never arrived.

2015-12-13,5.0,"Ben is the charming manager who shared a tip with me and now I am going to share it with you. The best night for Rural Society is Wednesday. The chef acquires a single type of animal from a local farm and prepares an entire pre fixe menu around it. M and I went for rabbit. I started the evening with a Martinez. It was a bright, light and mature beginning to a lovely evening. The bartenders patiently waited for me to select one of their tantalizing beverages that evening. I already knew that I loved the coffee based cocktail and wanted to try something new. They let me try the 5 Rabbit ""5 Vulture"" beer which was a sure winner. I sipped on that during my meal. The meal was heavenly. Everything we had foudroyant, evoking a sense of whimsy in both of us. Each dish utilized rabbit in a unique way and was fundamentally different. Our taste buds skipped from epanadas to ravioli to a spread of bare rabbit. We road the waves of intense and then delicate flavors and interesting textures. On other nights I've savored the richness of 3/4 cheese mashed potatoes and truffle mushrooms (sounds redundant but is incredible). There are plenty of options for folks who are meat-shy; however, I am in love with their blood sausage! The atmosphere of Rural Society is appropriately varied. You can wait for your party in the bright and modern hotel lobby. Then you enter the bar that is dimly and seductively lit and pucker your lips on a cocktail. There are stools at the bar and standing tables. Finally, you go to the albumen of the dining room which is decked with semi-circle booths and an open kitchen at the end. The kitchen is illuminated like a stage. The service was spectacular. Besides the manager Ben, I appreciated the keen attention from the bar tenders, server, bus boy and even the chef! They all carefully discussed the dishes with us and expressed genuine enthusiasm and pride for their craft. Our server surprised us with a superb sparkling Malbec. It was effervescent and flavorful and a sure elevation of Champagne. We contrasted our delight at Rural Society with the superfluous bovarism of Fig & Olive. They are comparable in price but Rural Society delivers a superior experience. M's tastes have been leaning toward vegetarian so it would follow that her preference would be for Fig & Olive; however, Rural Society was such a pleasant surprise that she came away saying that she could never give up meat. Thank you Rural Society. Thank you.",0.9981,0.782,0.214,0.004,0.5468926275744456

2015-12-10,3.0,"I ate last night with my husband for date night. The vibe I get is that this is still a relatively new restaurant with a few kinks to work out. We showed up at 7:29 pm for our 7:30 pm reservation on a Wednesday evening. The hostess was very friendly, but said our table wasn't ready yet which surprised us as the dining area certainly was not full. We were seated within 5-10 minutes at a booth in the main dining area.  Decor:The decor is rustic... based off of a rural village in Argentina. Open kitchen concept.  Service: Less than desirable. I don't know if it's because the restaurant is understaffed, but it took a while for us to be greeted by our waiter. We did look for him several times throughout the night to order food, get our drink order, get our bill, etc. That being said, he did seem to be busy. They definitely need to hire more people! The busboy who put together our leftover food put all the meat in 1 container and all the sides in a 2nd container which is alright BUT he didn't place it properly in a bag big enough. When we got home, all our food had slid and basically turned into a mess since our containers were placed vertically in a bag. Food: Inconsistent. The complimentary bread and malbec butter was good! For an appetizer, we ordered the mixed sausage platter (blood sausage, chorizo, chorizo and cheese, veal and sweetbread) which was hit or miss depending on your palate. My husband and I split the ribeye which was cooked perfectly medium rare. Our sides were the asparagus (yummy!), mushrooms (yummy!), and the cream potatoes (incredibly gluey in texture and too salty). For dessert, we split the torta which was good but not at all what we expected. It was describe as a cake with goat cheese fondant, but the dessert was more goat cheese than cake. Overall: It certainly has potential but there are so many other great steakhouses in Chicago that I likely won't return.",0.9911,0.852,0.127,0.021,0.44092079092079084

As you arrived the staff was extremely friendly and greeted each guest with a smile with the added bonus of a coat check on a chilly Chicago night. As you entered the restaurant you had your choice of either white or red Argentinian wine or speciality cocktails. I decided to go with the Strawberry Caipirinha and stuck with that all night, light and refreshing. Before dinner was served a round of impressive appetizers were passed. Focaccia Bread with Malbec Butter, Blood Sausage, Squid Carpaccio and what happened to be my favorite were the Lamb Chops. They were grilled and seasoned to perfection. I highly recommend you ordered them!  Dinner is severed, a lovely caving station was set up and you dined on Grilled Asparagus, Mushrooms, Crema Potatoes (mostly cream and heaven on a plate)  Roasted Potatoes and the highlight Roasted Pig. The food was impeccable. After dinner you seat and listen to the live band with a small plate of Roasted Red Peppers, Cheeses and of corse White and Red Sangria.

Their Chorizo con Queso is decadent.  I was expecting just spicy sausage with cheese.  No... the flavors are very subtle and every bite explodes with a little bit of that cheese.  Their Morcilla Sausage had notes of clove.  I've tried many a blood sausages in my day, and I gotta say it was the first time a blood sausage had a sweet and savory taste.  A pleasant surprise. Don't let the color deter you.   Definitely get vegetables with your Carne.  You won't regret it.  Their Esparragos and Crema potatoes is just perfection.  The crema potatoes is cheesy, hearty, and very creamy.  i could eat a bowlful of this and be completely content.  And who doesn't love a perfectly charred, grilled asparagus?

The reason for the poor rating is due to the wait staff.  Our waiter wasn't very good at checking in on us and making sure our food was okay.  We were without drinks for about 15 minutes until we ordered another round before our entrees came.  We waited about another 15 minutes for our drinks to come, at which point we were almost done with our meal.  It was only then that the waiter asked us if our meal was okay.  Then after we finished these drinks we sat there for another 15 minutes with no drinks and were clearly not eating anymore.   The meal itself took over two hours for two people.  We weren't in a rush, we were on a date, but it was frustrating at the end when we were clearly finished and couldn't find our waiter.  We definitely could have resolved it faster if we had flagged one of the bus boys (who, by the way, were amazing and super attentive -- hat's off to those guys!).  I noticed that there's another review about slow service, I think this is an easy change that would make a significant difference here!  The food really is great!",0.9917,0.795,0.171,0.034,0.6422633744855967

Our waiter was nice, but not too sharp. He forgot to charge us for the bottle of wine we had, so we had to point out to him that the wine was missing. But the worst thing is that although we dined there in July the dinner is only now billed to my card (I've even forgotten about the dinner by now, but a weird sum just popped up on my statement). I am not even sure if it is the dinner posted, since it doesn't appear as Rural Society, but as Loews Hotel, thus raising suspicion that someone might be using my card to book a hotel room. Obviously I was alarmed, since I thought it might a fraudulent transaction using my card. What is worse is that I've been trying to figure this out with the management - I've been literally calling them everyday asking for assistance. All of them promised to call me back, but I still haven't heard from them. I explained carefully that this is an important issue for because if it fraudulent I need to alert my bank. The managers are not helpful at all.  Rural Society is attempting to position itself as a prime and upscale restaurant. Well, it looks like they have a long way to go before they actually become one.

We were seated promptly in connection with our 7 PM reservation; service was personable and terrific all night; We each ordered the top end tasting menu with the top wine; we  each advised of a favorite dish we wanted and that was incorporated into our experience.  The wine list was, not surprisingly, heavy on Mendoza AR wines which I've found decent but not extraordinary; there are other choices (like the Prisoner, which I like very much) but we decided to go with the tasting accompaniments. it turned out that the wines served with our dinner were of the same modestly pleasant quality  in large part; pours were generous, but none of the wines were outstanding. Bread and fixings were nice, but not anything to die for; the following courses contained some modest winners, but the Morcilla was disappointing:  I've had much better in Madrid, and our dining partners had much better in Argentina.  The empenada was another disappointment. The mains included a somewhat soft lobster, nice lamb chops (but not as flavorful as the Moroccan grilled rack of lamb my wife made the night before) and steak with salt on the side. The steak was decent but lacked the flavor of the aforesaid ribeye.   The quantity of food was not an issue except for slight excess; accompaniments which included carrots, mushrooms, fries and pototoes (we requested the last two), were good but not ""amazing"" and the fries were a tad salty. We had a very leisurely dinner (no timing issue) and were not rushed at all; we enjoyed the service so much we left a 25% tip so the damages ran to $200 pp.  For that money I would expect a (much) more memorable dining experience.  And it's true: your clothes will smell smoky but today was wash day and we were prepared!",0.9931,0.792,0.162,0.046,0.5706562137049942

It took our waiter a while to greet us and take the other drink orders, but whatever. We just perused the menu and clucked away like hens. As for the food, I was beyond underwhelmed. The arugula salad was fine, but the strip steak was dry and fatty. Not marbled...fatty. And the mashed potatoes were incredibly salty. Actually, everything was incredibly salty. The best part of the meal were these little cookies they brought out with the dessert for the birthday girl, which was very nice. But all-in-all, not a good first (and probably only) trip to Rural Society. I thought for a sec that maybe they still had some kinks to work out since they were still relatively new. But after looking at the other reviews, I discovered that RS has been open for at least 5 months. Way past the kink deadline (imo). However, it looks like the majority of the other reviewers had better experiences. I still won't be able to recommended Rural Society, but will throw in the ""off night"" caveat.  Sorry, I just expected waaaaay better.",0.9841,0.845,0.129,0.026,0.5284992784992785
2015-07-26,5.0,I love trying new places when I travel. I rely on sites like Yelp or food sites like Eater to give me recommendations. I'm a big fan of brunch so I was excited when Eater Chicago recently updated their brunch map. Rural Society made the list and after viewing the menu my friends and I decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed! I ordered the Ruby red grapefruit brûlée as a start and it was delicious. So delicious my friend and I ordered another at the end of the meal! For my main course I ordered the rural society Benedict. It was fantastic. The black truffle hollandaise was so flavorful and was a unique twist on one of my favorite brunch meals. My friend ordered the dulce de leche waffles and they were excellent as well.  The service and the ambiance were also fantastic. I would highly recommend checking out Rural Society if you are traveling through Chicago and need a good spot for breakfast/brunch.,0.995,0.707,0.293,0.0,0.5529148629148628

First off the food we order a few things on the menu (the menu can be a quite bit confusing) the empanadas were delish we had the ones with cheese and spinach, the morrones were equally as flavorful, the cheese stuffed sausage I'm seriously craving one as I type this little shindig...... For the mains we have the Skirt steak for a skirt its pricy hovering around $50 dollars, but this is a damn good piece of shirt (best ever), my companion had the Lomo which is dry aged as explained by our server mostly in house (great steak) as the server Marcus recommendation we had the zetas, the carrots, and the crema all of which were fabulous..... So overall the food was excellent  The service was equally great our server was very calm, knowledgeable and knew his craft, I always say good can be OK but rockstars in the front will bring you back....Kudos young man. My only gripe and its not a very big gripe is I personally don't understand the set up of the restaurant the bathrooms were forever and a mile away (its in a hotel) and the random non Argentinian pics all over the place kinda through us off......  5 stars R.S",0.9822,0.851,0.13,0.02,0.49341947115384616

The wait staff was pleasant and went out of their way to accommodate some of our guests' needs (there was no domestic beer on the menu, so they went out and got some for a few of the people in our group).   The music and ambiance were both excellent and the interior had a very unique, rustic feel to it.  On the walls were pictures of Argentine gauchos (cowboys) and other symbols of the country, which I loved.  The restaurant is located inside the Loews Hotel, so after dinner we went up to the third floor and had a drink on the terrace, which had a huge lawn with tables and games and a fantastic view of the city.   All in all, I would highly recommend this place for someone looking to try authentic Argentine food in style!",0.9879,0.846,0.145,0.009,0.6316666666666667
2015-06-14,5.0,"This surprisingly large restaurant, as the name implies, strikes a balance between rusticity and sophistication. As soon as you enter the smell of the wood grill sets the tone for the highlights to come. The decor features many private booths in curtained alcoves, although they are for parties of four or more. Couples are seated in the middle, where the acoustics seem like they should be good, but were defeated by a very large party seated nearby. Already several drinks in when they arrived, they should have been placed in the empty adjacent room. Ah well. We decided to try the tasting menu and accompanying wine paring. This turned out to be a great way to sample much of the menu, and it's a good buy compared to the individual food pricing. It's available in two versions. We went for the upgraded version, which features more premium ingredients and better wines. The tasting menu is billed as four courses, but it's actually a dozen, since many plates are served for each course, and staggered preparation means that not everything arrives at one time. The accompanying five wines were excellent quality, almost all from Mendoza, and were full pours. We particularly loved the Alma sparking Malbec, a blanc de noir that was mouth-filling with a crisp finish.  We began with Focaccia bread with Malbec butter, which went great with the sparkler. Empanadas filled with Braised Wagyu Beef Belly were indeed savory, and improved by some of the salsa condiment. It didn't particularly go with the accompanying pinot grigio. Braised Octopus with Tomato Escabeche and Malbec Chips was an interesting combination, more about the accompaniments than the octopus. Roasted Red Peppers were a surprising standout. Thin sliced and served in oil with Whipped Eggplant and Anchovies, they were quite complex. Roasted Beets were served with an amazing Orange Coriander Vinaigrette that elevated the beets to something quite interesting. I was wishing I had some of that sparkler left for this course, although it somewhat matched the pinot not that was served. The Seafood Pasta with Cockles wasn't my favorite, although the past was nicely cooked, and the bits of Rock Shrimp were tasty. Grilled Wild Mushrooms were laden with butter, and absolutely delicious. The final course consisted of three items from the grill. Maine Lobster tail was split in half and served with a piece of claw meat. It was a straightforward preparation that let the flavor of the tender lobster come through. Although I'm not usually a pork fan, the Pork Chop was actually the highlight of the meal. It was a thick chop, sliced into succulent pieces, each with a charred crust. This is the only item I could not find on the regular menu, and I wonder if it was a special or a variant of the stuffed pork tenderloin. I'm pretty sure the tasting menu we had included the Prime Dry Aged NY Strip. Whatever the beef was, it was exquisite, and perfectly matched by the malbec/cabernet/syrah blend that accompanied it. Crispy Roasted Potatoes were pre-sliced into thin wafers held together only at the bottom, which allowed them to crisp around the edges. The accompanying Hollandaise was suffused with Truffle. We finished with a rolled up crepe-like pastry accompanied by Tres Leches ice cream. I felt it was the weakest course, although we were stuffed at this point, and the final wine, a delicious late harvest Malbec, made up for it. It was like drinking chocolate mousse. Service was friendly and efficient. While Rural Society isn't cheap, It is a good value for the money, but if you plan to order the tasting menu I suggest you arrive very hungry!",0.9987,0.799,0.172,0.028,0.551250587019818

There is a strong smell of fire smoke in the air within this place which will have you thinking about your dinner for the rest of the night but once the food comes, you will forget all about it.  The menu is large and can be confusing so we just let the server order for us his favorites and we weren't disappointed. For starters, we had  a couple of the house made sausages (delicious), the octopus, and the charcuterie plate.  For our mains, we split the stuffed pork tenderloin (so good!), the short rib and the NY strip.  Couple those with some of the truffled potatoes and mushrooms and a pasta dish, and we were very happy campers! The wine list is quite expansive with most of it by the bottle.  Wines by the glass are much more limited. If you drive- there is valet parking out front of the hotel.

They have a nice selection of sandwiches for lunch and the steaks and sides are excellent. Our favorite parts are the Argentinian bread and the flan.  The reason why I'm giving the restaurant only 2 stars is because of their deceiving/bizarre pricing on drinks which I only noticed last time we went for dinner (I should look at my bills more closely!). I ordered a whiskey on the rocks and my wife ordered a martini. On the bill I noticed a $2 charge for the rocks in my whiskey and a $2 charge for my wife getting her martini ""up"". I didn't want to make a big deal about it so we left and my wife called the manager the next day. To our surprise, the manager was pretty rude and said, ""that's how the restaurant industry works..."" And said they add the additional charges because there are bigger pours with rocks but then struggled to explain why the martini should have the additional charge because ""up"" just means no vermouth.  Regardless of the reason, the manager was rude and was confused as to why we were even calling. Needless to say, this isn't a common practice (adding additional charges for ice etc) and there are plenty of restaurants that are more transparent and more responsive when issues arise so we aren't planning on going back. It's not to $2 it's the principle.  Ironically, I ordered the same drink the following night at Fig and Olive and it was $2 more on the menu and I had no problem with it because it was the same price on the menu and on my bill.

What is billed as Argentine cuisine never actually comes close.  Having lived and travelled throughout Argentina, the food is pretty boring and completely predictable. Pizza is always thin crust, meat is typically medium rare off the grill, vegetables are served plain. At Rural, they are selling pizza with full thickness focaccia bread. For vegetables, these are covered in cheese or cream sauces. While the bread basket was fantastic--earning a star here--it isn't typical of Argentina in any way. I'd offer another star for the meat but the service was poor... so we are stuck at two stars. Have had both breakfast here and dinner.  Breakfast is typical American hotel fare. For dinner, sampled chorizo, lomo, arugula salad, asparagus and don Pablo dessert. Again, meat was fine, salad was under seasoned, asparagus was covered in a butter or cream sauce, dessert was bizarre: honey cinnamon ice cream drowning in a sweet red wine--I never turn down dessert but one taste of this was enough.

Most varietals only have one choice if ordering by the glass, but the Chardonnay I ordered was excellent and to my preference- strong oak, rich, and buttery.  The asado mixto is excellent and worth the splurge. You get full servings of the sausage varieties, which includes a classic beef and pork sausage, blood sausage (my first!- it tastes like Christmas!), a cheese stuffed sausage, and sweetbreads (also a first- so good!). The table bread includes chimichuri sauce, focaccia, cheese bread, and Malbec bread and is excellent.  We ordered the entrana medium rare, which they roll out and serve to you table side. It was excellent. My dinner partner and I thought some of the supporting dish flavors were underdeveloped. The choclo pizza had a heavy hand on the toppings and red pepper, so you couldn't tease out the delicate flavor of the crab.  The beets were not appetizing. They came with an orange sauce so simplistic that I thought it tasted just like orange juice. The dish was also topped with at least a tablespoon of whole, raw coriander seeds, which overwhelmed the balance of the ash-roasted beets. Service was great and attentive.

2015-03-29,4.0,"Part two of my parents' anniversary celebration involved a lunch at this new restaurant at the Loews Hotel. Since we live down the block from here, we were very excited to try this place out especially since it was an Argentine steakhouse with a wood-fired grill.  It was very easy to get a last-minute reservation here for lunch through Open Table on a Saturday though I imagine that'll quickly change during the busier summer months or when conventions are in town since this is the hotel's restaurant. The ambience gets 4 stars since you certainly almost feel like you've just stepped into someone's house with the wood-fired grill giving it a very smoky smell so I thought that was different. Fair warning that you will smell like smoke if you spend at least an hour here, which includes your clothes and hair. It may also stuff up your nose if you have allergies.  The food itself is delicious if you like meat, especially the gaucho sausage, lamb chops and ribeye from the grill. Our initial ribeye order came out well done, but they gladly replaced it with a new batch free of charge as the kitchen is still experimenting with getting just the right temperature and cooking time for a wood-fired grill. They also gave us another side of fries on the house! The bread they provide you at the start of the meal with the Malbec butter and chimichurri sauce is also very good! We kept asking for more and even got a batch to go along with that delicious Malbec butter.  The Wagyu empanadas weren't very good so skip those if you want to save some moolah. The ""Mixta"" which is a mixed order of their sausages is a good way to sample those with the cheese-infused one and gaucho being the two faves.  Do yourself a favor and order the chocotorta and dulce de leche flan for dessert - both are yummy! Service was a bit slow but again chalking that up to being relatively new, so they get 3.5 stars for that with the half star for making sure they corrected our ribeye order for free along with a free side order!

2015-03-23,4.0,"I went with my wife. She is from Argentina, and I am a first-generation American Argentine (both parents).  We assumed the food would be excellent given Jose Garces' pedigree, we did not however assume we were in for such a treat. The food is not ""tradictional,"" it is Garces' take on the  Argentine classics, so be warned, things maybe disappointing if you are expecting something out of Doña Patrona's cookbook. Most Argentines know that the best parilladas (grillouts) are to be had at someone's house. As a large-carcass, wood fire griller myself, I couldn't agree more. I would say though, if a well-seasoned vet is not available to cook for you out if their home, Rural Society would be a close second. The mollejas were some of the best I've ever tried...here or in Argentina. Crispy outside, creamy on the inside, and not chewy at all. That is a massive feat, Also, the empanadas were delicious, Truly delectable, they really seemed ""caseras.""  If I had to give one criticism, it would be that the meats should have been served at a slighty higher temperature.  This could be a calculated thing back in the kitchen, or the ""right"" way to serve gourmet meats, but in Argentina (and at my house), slightly lower than hot of the grill is the way it should come to your plate. The Picanha (which is actually a brazilian cut) was served luke warm. I've noticed that is a common thread in steakhouses in the states. Again, not sure if that is proper technique or not, I just know what I like. The service was excellent. If you have the opportunity to be seated in Anter's section, you will be pleased. Also feel free to walk around explore, the restaurant is very inviting and they encourage it, The temperature commment is why I gave RS a 4 star marking Please don't let it shy you away though.  After having made countless asados with some of the real masters in the old country,  I feel like I can speak comparatively and fairly.

The rosti had a nice texture, although it was a little bland. We shared a mushroom side dish which was cooked well, but also a bit bland. My friend enjoyed his Filete (grass-fed beef from Uruguay) cooked Medium Plus. I loved the Trucha (sea trout) which was very flavorful and cooked very well. All in all, it was a very pleansant experience and didn't feel at all like a hotel restaurant. before leaving the restaurant, I asked the host to tell me more about the private room which seats up to 60. They had two TVs in the private area for presentations. I may consider this location for one of our private events.",0.9843,0.843,0.157,0.0,0.5055555555555556
2015-03-14,1.0,Ouch. Went today for breakfast. Have never walked out of the restaurant before but unfortunately had to leave. We waited 45 minutes for two omelettes that never arrived. Never offered coffee refill or additional table service of any kind. Hopefully they work out the bugs before they subject customers to poor training and planning.,0.1531,0.746,0.124,0.13,0.7083333333333334
2015-03-14,5.0,"Beautiful restaurant with great food and fine service. It's obviously an upscale place, but I would say it definitely still had a comfortable vibe, which seems so fitting for an Argentine restaurant.  The food-- started with assorted breads with malbec butter and chimichurri - delicious. The tradicional fugazza was a really interesting twist on a pizza or flatbread-- it was like focaccia with a sweet red sauce and subtle cheese. Shared steaks at our table-- Entraña and Bife De Chorizo-- both were well cooked on the wood grill. We finished with the cheese plate, which might have been the best part. So many different, tasty cheeses (goat and cow) from Argentina and elsewhere.  Overall, a great new find in Streeterville!",0.994,0.675,0.325,0.0,0.5248006379585327
2015-03-13,5.0,"This place is outstanding from start to finish.  When you walk in, it immediately does not appear to be a hotel restaurant.  It is not cookie-cutter at all and has a ton of personality.  The bar area is very large.  The bar staff was very friendly and offered some suggestions for our dinner reservation (which I took, of course).  You walk through the bar area to get to the dining room.  It smells like the first cold day after Thanksgiving when winter is starting and you light a cozy fire.  I certainly disagree that it is off-putting as I found it added to the experience.  When you enter the dining room, it is quite large and you can see the kitchen in front of you, which was nice.  There is also a little, hidden table to the right of the kitchen, which is where we were fortunate enough to be sat.  Service was impeccable.  Our server was Anter and he is definitely on top of his game.  Helped us with selections on both food and wine.  Two of the people we were with had been to Buenos Aires and said this was very authentic! Now onto the important stuff: food.  Legua...yes, just yes.  It melted in my mouth.  We also got the roasted red peppers which were amazing.  The bread they brought was much higher quality than your typical run-of-the-mill bread basket.  I tried this one that was like a cheesy ball and it was so great.  They bring some giardiniera type garnish as well as a chimichurri.  Both were very tasty.  We also got one of the empanadas, which was so yummy.  We tried the asado mixto, which is an assortment of meats.  I think the chorizo gaucho was the table favorite.  The sweetbreads could have been a bit crispier but were still good.  The blood sausage and other chorizo were solid as well.  If you have a group, I would recommend this.  We then tried the saffron taglierini, which I thought was good but my two companions thought it was one of the best things they've ever  had.  We had to try a bunch of steak for obvious reasons.  I can't even remember all that we had but one was a bone in ribeye that was amazing.  I know we got the rump as well.  They were all succulent and cooked to a perfect medium rare with the nice char on the outside thanks to that fire that you smell upon entering.  We had two desserts and I can't even remember what one was (at this point I was stuffed beyond comprehension) but one was a flan.  Normally I'm so-so about flan cause it tastes good but there is nothing overly impressive about it.  This was stellar.  It was like a sexy, velvety flan that was elevated.  I will be back many, many times and would highly recommend!  There was literally nothing that we had that any of the four of us didn't love.",0.9966,0.809,0.163,0.027,0.5936181139122316
2015-03-08,3.0,"Four of us had a nice meal here on Saturday night a few days after they opened.  I feel bad giving them only three stars but given whole experience I feel a little disappointed.   What we ate: They started us off with three great breads, malbec butter, chimichurri, and olive tapenade Matambre - nice simple favor, enjoyed Empanada Tucumana - tasty, great crust Chorizo Con Queso - Nice strong flavor Sorrentino - best thing we had, warm big blankets of cheesy ham in cream sauce Tradicional Fugazza - great app, was like well loaded focaccia bread  Tenderloin - solid, was pre-cut to share and felt like it was a little cold/could use more seasoning Skirt - good, but for the same price as the tenderloin not worth it Zanahorias - pretty carrots, came out cold and flavorless Crema - simple, very good and creamy Fritas - completely meh french fries, how are they $9 for a small cup? Dessert - completely the best part of the meal - we got the chocolate torte and an ice cream with dessert wine. Our waitress was clearly still learning the menu and was a bit awkward. We placed our apps/entrees at the same time, so were pretty disappointed that half came out cold and we finished the meats before we got the sides.   With the wood fire being the central theme, it was also really sad that we didn't taste it much in the food. The place is beautiful, but sadly you leave smelling like the wood fire (the next day my hair and clothing still stink).  I would assume that comes along with the wood fire territory, but places like ARC in Costa Mesa and Ned Ludd in Portland didn't have this problem.",0.9967,0.619,0.27,0.111,0.5722188449848022
