2013-03-27,4.0,"Gone and perhaps forgotten.  After less than a year, Maison is closing its doors at the end of the month. It may have carried on with ""business as usual"" but there was something in the air-- besides delicious scents of french fare-- more like a sense of mournful melancholy. My date and I were seated at the best table in the house, smack dab in the middle of their wall-to-ceiling window overlooking Lakeshore East. Dinner reminded me of that scene in Titanic, you know, the one where the quartet is gallantly playing on as the ship's sinking? Their menu was already starting to phase out. Indeed, we had to check out the best french onion soup in the city and it definitely lived up to its cheesy-creamy-broth glory. The escargot with pastry was divine as well as their butter lettuce (hard to mess a simplistic salad dish such as this). The gnocchi was a little too much for us to handle, but the highlight of the evening was the trout: fresh, well-prepared, drizzled in some lemon and topped with some green beans 'n almonds. Simplicity at its best.  Maison was a beautiful thing. Still pristine and chic. I'm glad we had the chance of dining there before they officially closed its doors. There's still a few days left to experience Maison. The location may have contributed to its untimely closure. It's easier to get there from Randolph then trying to navigate from Benton Pl.

I ordered a double portion of the steak tartar, short ribs and cold lobster.  1) lobster was cooked to perfection, sweet and sea-tasting.  2) short-ribs: very tender, but something is always up with the seasoning at this place, same with Custom House. Not enough salt? Wine cooked down too  much? Bad quality wine in the sauce? Something funky was going on with the flavors and not in a good way.  3) steak tartar: tender meat, very fresh, but OVERWHELMED with lemon. So much zest and juice that it overpowered the meat flavor, the capers, and everything else in it. In fact, I could have eaten a lemon and had a much cheaper meal.  Overall delightful place, but they need to fix their seasoning. Good food...but just not seasoned well.  *still washing lemon off my tongue*",0.989,0.747,0.212,0.041,0.5234829059829059
2013-02-28,3.0,"I made a reservation through OpenTable and wrote in the comments section that we were celebrating a birthday. When I got to the restuaurant before my friend, the hostess confirmed that we were celebrating my friend's birthday. So I thought, great, we're set, they'll either bring out a dessert or a piece of something sweet with a candle on it or something. Service was friendly, though the first guy who showed up at the table had a haughty attitude. We were served by at least three people, so I really don't know who our actual waiter was. One person took our order, one person brought the wine, etc.  Starting with the good--you can't go wrong with any of the wines here, even the cheapest glass of the red was deliciously flavorful and good. The French onion soup was good, not the best I've had, but pretty good. My friend's gnocchi was fresh and tasty. My burger was beautifully presented/plated, but needed to be seasoned better. It left a strong aftertaste. I'm not one to not enjoy a burger, but I had a tough time chewing through this one. Shoe string fries were too salty. The bad--apparently after confirming that we were celebrating a birthday, the hostess didn't relay the information to the server--or she did and nothing was done about it. At any other restaurant, they will bring you a piece of cake, a piece of pie, a scoop of ice cream--something--with a candle in it. Nope. Not here. So I insisted we order dessert, thinking ok they'll comp a lousy dessert in honor of us celebrating a birthday and choosing this establishment to do it at. Or that they would at least stick a candle in our dessert. Just a lousy candle and light it and bring it out. Nope! Again, nothing. The bill came to $105 for two people, no birthday dessert comped, which was a slap in the face. I left with an overwhelming disappointment that my friend's birthday passed by unceremoniously, thanks to Maison Brasserie's lack of caring. Thanks for ruining my friend's birthday celebration.

The setting is pleasant (though I imagine it could get quite noisy if full) and the service smooth and attentive. For starters, the baguette was above reproach and was served with a pair of lovely radishes(with butter and salt, in the French style). I enjoyed a lovely butter lettuce salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette -- the presentation was exquisite. My companion enjoyed brandade (not really my thing, but OK). Her pasta with rabbit was quite nice -- terrific pasta, good bunny/sauce. I had ""cassoulet"" (their quotes, not mine); it was OK, but kind of one-dimensional (which I guess cassoulet is: you got your meat, you got your beans). I had to try the frites, based on Vettel's recommendation; they were almost perfect (just a little too salty for me -- in fact, saltiness was a weak point for the brandade and both entrées, too). Profiteroles made for an nice dessert, though the alleged hazelnut ice cream had little flavor. Café au lait was good and well-presented. Maison has wine list that admirably broad and compact at the same time; there are good choices at all prices points. Similarly, it offers a nice, though not overwhelming, selection of Belgian style ales. Salt notwithstanding, I'd like to go back and explore the menu further.

2012-10-29,5.0,"What a nice addition to the Loop restaurant scene. We considered going to III Forks since we hadn't been there yet either, but based on the Yelp reviews picked this place instead. Good choice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed excellent service so I can't speak to the attentiveness of the waitstaff, which other reviewers have mentioned. I prefer to sit at the bar anyway for a late-night dinner, makes for more interaction and speedier access to alcohol when it runs out. Also bartenders are usually more overtly jaded and cynical than servers which suits me fine. We ordered a variety of starters and a main dish to share and very much enjoyed the warm and fresh demi baguette bread with butter, radishes, and sea salt while we waited. Meanwhile, the bartender helped pick out a Sancerre and a lovely red Burgundy, served by the half liter for $27 which was an almost criminal steal for such a great wine.  The shrimp were gigantic and delicious, and the cured salmon was very good,  served with huge roe and buttery toast. The steak tartare was also well executed with good texture and freshness, and paired excellently with the recommended wine. It was served with a gooey semi soft boiled egg and some of the best fries I've had in some time. We followed that up with the cassoulet, which I'm glad we split as it was very rich and might have been a little too much for one person. Delicious sausage and fall-off-the-bone duck was served with pork belly that was just okay and thick meaty navy beans. Very good overall, the pork belly was an anomaly and the dish came together.  We had heard the desserts were excellent as well, so we ordered a scoop of banana-passion fruit sorbet, a scoop of apple cider sorbet (my girlfriend's favorite hands-down), and a scoop of rosemary brown butter ice cream. The rosemary brown butter could have done with a sprinkle of sea salt and a mint leaf, it was good but missing something. I also ordered the dark chocolate mousse which was firm, thick, rich, and flavorful. We left full and satisfied. Overall great food, great service, good value, and a great location. They also have a half-price raw bar daily 5-6 and Monday-Saturday 10-11. That means you can get a whole Maine lobster for $15 or their giant seafood platter for two for $45.

2012-10-16,3.0,"My bf and I met another couple here for dinner last Saturday and things were off to a rocky start with respect to parking. I'd been to another restaurant in this Never- Never Land of neighborhoods (Lake Shore East) so I was familiar with the quirky ingress/egress of the location. Considering it's a downtown restaurant, we naturally assumed it offered valet parking. Ah, but that's where we'd be wrong. Our friends arrived first and couldn't quite figure out where to park. My friend had to go up to the restaurant on the fourth floor and ask them and was told to park in the garage (quite hidden and not easy to find). I wasn't about to pay $24 to park for dinner (according to the signage) so we drove up to III Forks and valeted our car there. Guess we should've parked in the garage because Maison Brasserie will validate your parking at a cost of $4 for three hours. Might have been nice to know that ahead of time, you know, like on their website, when they called to confirm the reservation, or when we asked where to park. So far, not starting off on a positive note. The restaurant had a pleasantly busy feel to it but it wasn't overly crowded. The décor is warm and modern and very appealing, which was a nice surprise. I didn't really know what to expect since it's located in the same building as Mariano's. We were seated immediately and started with a round of drinks while we looked over the menu (one oddity: a prix-fixe menu was offered of which $5 of the cost would be donated to breast cancer research, except the cost of the prix-fixe menu was never mentioned). I ordered their version of a kir royale, with house-made cassis. It was good; no complaints there.  Next we ordered some appetizers: steak tartare with frites, fresh oysters (sold individually which is ideal for a group) gougeres (cheese puffs) and a butter lettuce salad. Warm bread with delicious butter, sea salt and fresh radishes was also brought out. We all enjoyed everything; I especially loved the butter lettuce salad. It's a testament to the sheer power of simplicity: soft lettuce, a light Dijon vinaigrette and fines herbes. We were finishing up our appetizer when we noticed we hadn't gotten our cheese puffs. We told the busser as he was clearing our plates because we couldn't find our waiter. Five minutes later our waiter comes by and says we didn't order them. I know I ordered them because the rest of the table heard me. Also, I am someone that loves food, so I don't ever forget to order something I want. It felt like the waiter was arguing with us but to his credit an order was brought out quickly and all was forgiven once we tasted them. For entrées, we ordered traditional bistro dishes: two of us had roasted chicken, another had trout, and another had a croque madame. We also shared some potato puree and brussel sprouts. The chicken was delicious, and served with pan juices over a thick piece of sourdough toast. Everything else looked great (although I didn't taste) but none of us liked the potato puree. It was overly creamy and smooth and was the consistency of straight-up baby food. Not good. Desserts were better; we shared a tarte tatin and profiteroles and both were as good as any I've had elsewhere. Overall, the food was good but the service was definitely lacking. It was a Saturday night and we were all having a good time and excited for a night out. Our waiter was not very engaging (despite our attempts to draw him in) and the level of detail was almost what you'd find in a counter-service restaurant. We had to ask for fresh pepper and other accompaniments, were never offered another round of drinks or coffees with our desserts...stuff like that. It felt like the kind of place where someone merely takes your order and never checks back until it's time to drop off your bill. Not what one should expect from a downtown restaurant at this price point. I am a big fan of straightforward bistro-style French fare and Maison Brasserie executes the classics quite well. I am hoping the service was an anomaly, but I liked the food enough to give them the benefit of the doubt, and will likely visit again.",0.999,0.766,0.188,0.046,0.546162811547427

Infrequent checking and auction at the table when food arrived.  I hate that. 4)  Even busboy was poorly trained.  While we were eating our entrees, he removed our bread plate (they serve little demi baguettes and ours was gone) and our B&B plates.  Mine was where I had placed the seafood fork I was using on my mussels.  We asked for more bread - more B&B plates and I needed another seafood fork to complete my meal.   5)  Water was filled ridiculously.  Take a sip - he's back.  And he doesn't just pour, each time he picks up the glass with his hands around the rim.  WAY unsanitary. 6)  We asked our server for bread with our salads.  Never happened. 7)  Food saved the place from getting one star.  Had mussels and frites, trout, frisee and mixed green salads - all very good. Service staff from servers to bus help in need of training.  Not sure anyone in management has the chops to give it to them. Great location may save them for awhile but service issues will ultimately sink them if they're not addressed.",0.9905,0.805,0.157,0.038,0.6684444444444445
2012-09-16,4.0,"This place is a HUGE add to the food desert that is Lakeshore East. I enjoyed a fabulous girls night here, with many martinis and glasses of wine - it lends itself quite well to this occasion. And they score extra credit because the food is actually good, too!  Let me start by telling you (since you asked)  that you should just order the chicken, everything else be damned. It's literally the best chicken that I've ever had. I don't know what kind of crack they use in the sauce, but I'm hooked. And I will be back.  I should also add that I absolutely adore french fries, to the point where I would eat only french fries, all of the time, if they somehow had a nutritional value more similar to baby carrots. This place DELIVERS on the frites. Delivers. Truth. We had  a number of delicious things: Gougeres, bread and butter (!!!), oysters, moules frites (if you ask nicely, they might give you half the mussels and fries as an appetizer), rabbit pasta (amazing), beef ribs (not bad) and green beans.  Next time, I will probably go make a meal of the cheese and meats course... with fries. Love this place!",0.9908,0.796,0.196,0.008,0.5733333333333334

2012-08-20,2.0,"I ADORE the ambiance of Maison Brasserie. I want to get a huge place and then snag decorating ideas from Maison Brasserie. And I'll have them provide me with the Picnic Punch cocktail while I'm doing it - the decor and that cocktail were my favorite things about Maison. Maison is divided into two rooms. The front room is very casual, sunny, and light. As in, it's decorated with light colors that play with the natural light from the windows. The second room is modern and elegant. It's dark. Some of the walls are painted black, some have dark wood, others are covered in silvery metal, and still others are concrete. All of those dark walls and alcoves are in stark contrast with the one wall that's a window, making silhouettes of everything and everybody who passes before it. Our server was nice and friendly. He was a bit familiar with us, which was fine. I ordered my cocktails based upon my own whims (the Picnic Punch is my new favorite and I might return to Maison just to have it again) but I got my food based on Yelp... and what the Yelp?! My braised rabbit entree was unappealing. The pasta was undercooked and the rabbit looked and tasted like chicken. The sauce was good though. M got some cold mussels and a steak. She was happy with both of them. She was not happy that our bread was not removed from our table when everything else was cleared. She was also unhappy that she could not seem to get anyone's attention. It's true that we were not checked on very much. They also didn't seem to notice that my food was practically untouched. We got dark chocolate mousse for dessert. It was pleasing - a little thick in consistency and not very sweet. I liked it and so did M. It went very well with her 10 Year Port. All of our food and drinks came to a little more than $100, which was surprising considering that we got a lot (an appetizer, two entrees, a dessert, and four drinks). I suppose it was good for that price.  Then again, it would have been nice to have been able to enjoy my entree.",0.9939,0.808,0.166,0.026,0.6277306397306398
2012-08-15,4.0,"I stormed this cleverly-hidden brasserie in Lakeshore East this afternoon for the French picnic lunch special, in honor of what would have been Napoleon's 243rd birthday. I suppose that I didn't read the fine print, as I was under the impression that the lunch would be packed up, in boxes, and that diners would be sent on their way. It turned out this was only for the first 100 dine-in guests. It all worked out for the best, as I could take a seat and imbibe, seeing as how the restaurant also offered $2.43 house (tap) wines during the day as part of the celebration. I went with the rose, a solid pour. The service was professional, no small feat given that this spot only recently opened, and the level of bustle today at what I'm sure is customarily a relatively sedate lunch spot.  I checked on the menu and this picnic lunch is normally $12, so it is great that Maison offered it for free, even though I ended up leaving most of the pate, as I am not a fan. The demi baguette was excellent, as were the other accompaniments (salad greens, blue cheese, and eggs mayonnaise). I look forward to returning to Maison to redeem my 15 percent off lunch coupon and sampling some of the other menu offerings, especially on the dessert side.",0.9702,0.859,0.117,0.025,0.5133477633477633

It was that good.  We had the gruyere gougeres, chicken liver and cheese plate for apps and they were excellent.  The chicken liver pate was outstanding.  Also I had the cheese onion soup.  It was rich and slightly creamy, in short it was great.  For dinner, the veal liver; braised rabbit; and parisian gnocci.  We all enjoyed our entrees and finished them.  Dessert was the profiteroles.  We enjoyed.  They gave us caramel and hot fudge. Both homemade and both wonderful.   But the best was the service.  We had Wendy as our server.  She took the time to answer all our questions.  More importantly, the little things.  With the cheese and chicken liver apps, she watched as we ate and brought out more bread without being asked.  The attention to detail made an excellent meal outstanding.  We didn't drink and for a party of three our bill was $112 before tip.  What a deal.  We will be back.  The service and the food are just that good.  As a new place it will be easier to get in, once it catches on, tables will be real hard to come by.",0.995,0.745,0.248,0.006,0.6833484848484848
2012-06-22,5.0,"Delicious with great ambiance.   Of course, the food is the best part.  We started with the gruyere gougeres which are like flaky pastry with melted cheese inside.  They were good, but I was more excited by the hot bread that came out with ""good butter"", sea salt and radishes (their tagline for this is ""just like in France"").  For mains I loved, loved, loved my duck confit, it was cooked perfectly, moist and full of flavor.  The turnip gratin was a really unexpected delicious side.  My friend had the Parisian gnocchi, which is different than Italian in that it was toasted on the outside and cheesy inside.  It was quite good, and she enjoyed it.   We were not wowed by the dessert menu, so we had some liquid dessert: Rose Brut and Cuvee Abbaye (super sweet nectar-y dessert wine).  Here's how you know the service is great: I inquired about a more expensive dessert wine, not knowing much about it, and she recommended the less expensive one.  I really appreciated that she went for taste and not trying to drive up our bill.  Throughout the ordering process, she was ready with suggestions, but was never pushy.  She answered our questions (ie pronunciation) without making us feel dumb.  Well done Maison.

2012-05-29,4.0,"French done very well. My wife and I consider ourselves foodies and as such are fortunate enough to try and visit a new restaurant each weekend. This past weekend we selected Maison and we were extremely pleased with the selection.  In very French style, the table is greeted with a wonderful mix of ""french breakfast"" radishes, whip butter, sea salt and bread. The combination of the radish butter and salt is so traditional french. My wife and I shared the steam lobster chilled appetizer. It was so fresh one could almost smell the sea water. We shared a pate campagne, house marinated olives and a selection of farmstead cheeses. Truly a delight. The pate was simply wonderful.  We moved from the appetizer level dishes to soups and salads. My wife had the caramelized onion soup. Oh my god...hands down the best onion soup I have ever eaten. Creamy and rich. So unbelievably good. I had the veal sweetbreads. I am a real fan of sweetbread and it is always a treat to have if it is on the menu. These sweetbreads were by far one of the best I have eat. Tender and creamy small bite of heaven.   Our main entrees: My wife had the Parisian Gnocchi. They were like eating little pillows of puff with incredible taste. This is the first gnocchi I have ever eaten that was not made with ricotta cheese. I had the sauteed veal liver. Melted in your mouth like butter. The roasted grape sauces was simply divine. The real texture of the dish was found in the layered crispy potato. This dish ranks as a 12 on a 10 scale. Just really well balanced and full of flavor.  The staff was great. Friendly like you were at home but very professional. There was not a single request that was not met.  Even with all that was going on with the opening of the new place, Chef Perry Hendrix made time to visit us table side.
