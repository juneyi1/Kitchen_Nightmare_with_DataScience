2007-09-25,4.0,"The food was very good, delicate but flavorful.  It's definitely quite pricey for small portions, but I still left satisfied.  Wine is overpriced for a small domestic list, though we liked the Bearboat Pinot Noir.  For starters, the chorizo risotto is tasty though I could have had more.  The arugula salad was simple, yet very good with chunks of delicious bleu cheese.  I ordered the pork entree--the main portion of pork was good, not unbelievable;  The cube of bacon is tasty and the sides were good (creamy orzo, frise, whipped onion).  My girlfriend ordered halibut, which had a nice tea flavor and perfect texture.  Desert was the highlight as we had the ""Berries""--a muffin-like pastry topped with sorbet, berries, cream and sitting in a berry 'soup'.   It has the air of being a trendy spot that people would seek for the decor and ambiance.  The service is top-notch and incredibly attentive, though we went on a quiet Monday night.  However, I have been to places of this ilk and have had snooty staffers who loaf around when it's quiet.     A strong positive was when I made the reservation, I was asked if it was a special occasion and I mentioned my girlfriend's birthday.  The desert was comped!  Also, we were given a small appetizer before the meal for no charge.  The popcorn was relatively blah. Overall I was impressed by the friendliness in a place with such a trendy feel.  The food was great and I would recommend it for a special occasion when you are not seeking a hearty pile of steak and potatoes, but something light and more clever...",0.9975,0.73,0.25,0.02,0.6190031897926636
2007-09-16,2.0,"It's hard to say anything bad about Butter, mainly because they were so NICE.  This review will get worse, but I have to say up front that the service was thoughtful and accommodating (and we tipped accordingly), because that was the main thing we took away from our experience here. There is a level of pretension in the service that I have no doubt is not the fault of the servers.  They don't give you a food menu when you sit down, you have to wait for that.  If you get up and go to the restroom, the server will come back and fold your napkin while your dining companion watches, not knowing whether or not to make conversation while this is happening.  I'm ok with coming back to the table and finding my napkin in the same crumpled heap I left it, and if I knew they would do that I would have just taken it with me to save them the trouble.  When the server poured our wine he took the bottle away and set it on the bar (we were told it was because the tables are small), but I like to be close to my wine so we went and got it and put it on our table.  Also when we were seated the hostess demanded my purse and then produced a little metal hanger that she attached to the table and hung the purse from, where it banged against my shin for the rest of the evening. The first alarming thing about Butter is the wine list.  I'm no expert but I know a little bit about wine, and I found myself staring at the list in disbelief.  A restaurant of this caliber, charging these prices, and 95% of the list is comprised of big name Californian wineries that you can pick up at Dominick's (Rutherford, Ferrari-Carano, etc.).   The fortunate thing is that they sell some of these wines by the glass, and they were really nice about letting us taste a few of our choices before we plunked our money down on one.  (A word of caution:  don't be tempted by the  Australian Shiraz-Viognier.  Horrifying.) We ordered the rabbit sausage to share for an appetizer.  We were told later that it was a dish the chef particularly likes, and frankly it shows.  The sausage is house-made, nicely seasoned, maybe a little dry in texture but I was so pleased with it and the sauce it came in that it didn't matter.  I swiped my roll through the leftover sauce on the bottom of the dish because it was that good.  It also went nicely with our merlot (Merlot!  I know, right?  Really, you have to see this list to believe how bad it is.). We were encouraged, but unfortunately that was the culinary highlight of the evening.  I ordered the duck, excited about the promise of confit, which I can never turn down.  My husband got the lamb.  Again with the sauces - excellent.  My fig sauce and my husband's pesto, both delicious.  I guess I usually expect confit to be the leg of the duck, but here he had confit-ed the breast (so I was told - I'm actually not sure now).  Hrm.  It had none of the wonderful flavor and richness of confit, and all of the dryness of overcooked duck breast.  It made me wonder what he did with the legs.  I even asked (I know, what a jerk), but we never did find out.  The dishes are elaborately arranged by the chef, who we think is channeling Kandinsky, but ultimately the food is not worthy of the arty design.  My husband found his lamb dish ""confusing"", in that he kept trying different combinations of things on the plate but could never find one that tasted quite right.  It seemed more theory than practical execution.  The lamb itself was cooked well, as was the non-confit duck breast. I'll go back to re-emphasize that the staff was outstanding.  We gave honest feedback throughout the evening, to the point that we pretty much knew it was a little obnoxious, but we gave the honest good with the tempered bad and they responded by doing everything in their power to make sure we were happy.  They sent us out a new dessert that wasn't on the menu (we didn't order dessert), a panna cotta with apple gelee, brunoise apples and crushed peanuts.  The panna cotta was absolutely delicious - creamy, delicately flavored and not too sweet -  but the gelee - nice on its own if you like gelee - bullied it, and we felt welcome to give our thoughts to that effect.   Despite the heroic efforts of the staff and some interesting things happening in the kitchen, I'm disappointed that I can't recommend Butter.  The chef is young and has some great ideas and he clearly takes his job seriously, and I think with some time and practice he'll pull it together nicely.  Butter is aiming for something it's not quite achieving (Guys, if you do ONE THING - please fix that wine list!!), and while I'm not sorry we went, I can spend $200 for a more satisfying meal elsewhere.  Five stars for service, but two on the review to direct you away.",0.9984,0.77,0.157,0.072,0.5868502198859339
2007-07-03,5.0,"I had an incredible experience here.  To begin, my friend and I were cold, so the staff brought us PASHMINAS!!! Talk about great treatment! Our waitress was very knowledgeable and passionate about the food and so was our bartender.  The chef brought us tastings of different things on the menu and everything was a burst of flavor...talk about many mouth-gasms throughout the night! The carbonara melted in our mouths, the scallops were succulent, the rabbit sausage was incredibly unique and again, very tasty, and the entrees (bass and pork chops) lived up to all the great flavor as our appetizers.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone!  We felt so welcomed and well taken care of and that always gives a place extra cool points!

2007-05-06,2.0,"Note - Ryan Poli is not the chef here anymore.  When he was at the restaurant, Butter was named one of the top new restaurants by John Mariani (Esquire).  I think it's misleading for the restaurant to make that claim with the new chef.   Eh... Food was good (decent), service was not that great.  The servers spoke as if they were reading from a script.   The popcorn with truffle oil is a fun idea, but nothing special.  The popcorn was actually kind of stale.  We started with the beef tartare, It was pretty good, actually.  I had the halibut with asparagus, green onion, wild mushrooms and a beef tea broth. It was cooked very well, but lacked flavor.  Portion sizes are ideal for a light dinner.  My friend had the salmon (I didn't try it, but he said it was good).   We skipped dessert... nothing too impressive. I give this restaurant another year... unless their food and service improves drastically.",0.9633,0.778,0.164,0.058,0.5798593073593074

2007-01-21,4.0,"Went to Butter last night with my girlfriend and had a fabulous time.   THE GREAT: - The Sweet Corn Risotto appetizer was the best thing we had all night.  Creamy, garlicy, buttery.  Just awesome. - The Duck Confit appetizer was great, too.  I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of duck meat, as I had been warned to expect small portions. - As far as entrees go, the Sea Scallops in Foi Gras Emulsion was outstanding.  I thought it was an odd combo, but I took the waiter's advice and went with it.  I'm happy I did. - The snacks they give you to start off were excellent - the truffle popcorn especially.  I also really enjoyed one of the amuse bouches, a shot called Guac and Chips (it was really an avocado soup with a warm tortilla foam).  I like the creativity. THE NOT SO GREAT: - The Linguini with Crab appetizer was too salty to enjoy. - Our second round of martinis was undrinkably bad.  I am typically not one to judge a restaurant on its drinks, but it's still worth mentioning.  My girlfriend had a specialty cherry martini that tasted like cough syrup.  I ordered my vodka martini ""extra dirty,"" but it tasted like there was no olive juice added whatsoever.  I seriously would not have been able  to tell the difference between my drink and shot of straight vodka. Total bill came close to $200.  A bit pricey, but a great atmosphere for a date made it worth it.",0.9962,0.692,0.264,0.044,0.5924242424242423
2006-11-21,5.0,"Amazing.  Really amazing.  I left dinner at Butter wracking my brain to remember when the last time I had such a great dining experience was.  It was at least a year ago.   The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, though obviously classy.  The pillows behind your lower back on the banquet seats are a nice touch, as was the hook to hang my purse off the side of the table.  The service was impeccable.   The food was unbelievable during our visit.  With the tasting menu setup, though the portions are smaller than a normal restaurant, every single bite that you put in your mouth is beyond flavorful.  It is a savoring experience.  They brought us several ""courtesy of the chef"" amuses-bouches treats throughout the meal, which was such a nice touch, and delicious.  I had the linguine / pesto / crab meat for my first course, the rib eye for my second course and the passion fruit puree with coconut sorbet for my dessert.  Every single bite was heaven.  Everyone should go to Butter. They have valet service, but if you take a cab, be forewarned that Butter is on a small street, so getting there is fine, but you'll likely want to walk over to Halsted to hail a cab for the ride home.",0.9674,0.847,0.145,0.007,0.5473544973544974
2006-11-04,2.0,"After reading all these reviews I realize I must've gone on a bad night. We had reservations for 2 on a Saturday night. The hostess said she couldn't find our reservation and gave us a worried look. We asked ""do you have room?"" and she was like ""Oh, yeah!"" ....Why bother worrying us with the whole ""We can't find your reservation"" thing? Anyway, we were seated. Our waiter was great, but the bussers and people refilling our water were a bit intrusive. I'd called ahead to get a vegetarian meal and our server said the chef could ""whip something up with whatever vegetables they had"". Not a single vegetarian option on the menu-that's very strange these days. I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but his ingredients differed from the menu completely. I ended up with 5 tiny vegetarian raviolis. We ordered 2 desserts (one mostly comprised of foam) and left hungry and disappointed. We will give this place another try because everyone has said such good things, but our experience was not good. I'll give it 2 stars for the good server and funky decor.",0.5944,0.833,0.086,0.081,0.47685374149659854
