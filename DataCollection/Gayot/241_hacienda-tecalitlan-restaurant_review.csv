The website is up and running, and I was still able to make a reservation for it. However, we got there and it's CLOSED. A man walking by said they closed about 5 years ago. But the owner opened another place on Chicago Av. We went there, and it wasnt nearly as good and the decor was not much. However, the tres leche cake was fantastic.",0.8688,0.859,0.116,0.025,0.4901515151515152
2008-01-27,1.0,Never quite figured out what happened to this place.....walked in there one night and it was surreal: huge sprawling indoor hacienda but completely empty and ghost like...seemed a little to expensive for the time.   Now there are chains on the door and broken windows....who knew,-0.8585,0.772,0.032,0.196,0.6666666666666666
2007-12-20,1.0,"The worse service that I have ever received.  I went there back in 1999 only to be ignored by our waiter.  I've had numerous opportunities to go with friends but I always decline.  To make a long story short, we waited 20 minutes for drinks, received no refills, no one picked up our dirty dishes, and no one offered us dessert.  After waiting for the check, my party and I decided to walk up and pay at the register.  As I was walking out the door, I heard someone call out ""Senor, senor...no propina?""  (Sir, sir, ....no tip?)  I told him ""NO!  the service was horrible.""  I wrote a letter to the owner and we ended up playing phone tag.  In their defense, the food was tasty!",-0.8378,0.783,0.079,0.138,0.575
2007-10-22,1.0,is this place closed?  we went on friday night after reading some great reviews and it was not open.  disappointing.  we ended up at the place around the corner on chicago that was not good at all.,0.6511,0.788,0.156,0.056,0.53
2007-05-30,4.0,"I've been to their sister restaurant on Chicago many times, but never stopped in here until last Friday night.  At 5 or 6pm we walked in and were seated in a large mexican hall complete with carved chairs and white linens.  It has a neat stone look, but strange at the same time with a disco ball hanging and the biggest oddity of all - WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE.  For a whole hour no one came in.  That's why I want to share with you all - it's worth a visit.  Our waiter was truly accomodating and let us know about the potential spice issues with some of the foods.  Most of the standards from the sister restaurant were there - the salsa and guacamole were all delicious and flavorful.  The difference menu-wise between the two restaurants is the entrees.  This restaurant has less typical (not combination-based options, or burritos) and more meat based options.  I had the Carne Asada, which came with a salad and was perfectly flavored.  The beans and rice were a nice compliment.  Boyfriend had the steak fajitas which were great too.  We both ate our leftovers (huge portions) the next night.  Bill was less than $40 with each of us having a tecate or two.  Perfect for groups, dates, or families - in fact maybe all of you should go all at once so the place isn't so empty.",0.9929,0.794,0.186,0.019,0.4781428571428571
2007-04-07,5.0,"This place is amazing.  The interior alone is so impressive with it's high archways, elegant seating and tall-backed chairs.  They also have a nice-sized dance floor for their friday/saturday night music and dance.   The margaritas are awesome and decently priced.  I would personally suggest the mango margarita.  mmmmm!  The food is also very tasty.  I am definitely a fan of the fresh pico de gallo with chips. The servers were so friendly and personable.  Even though I'm nowhere near up to par on my spanish, they were very nice and helped me learn some new words!  One thing they suggest is showing up early (before 9) on the weekends as they are usually packed. I would highly suggest the hacienda because of it's unique atmosphere , yummy food and, of course, the margaritas!",0.9857,0.765,0.222,0.013,0.5869059011164274
2007-04-07,5.0,"I have driven by this restaurant countless times, but had never bothered to stop until this afternoon. This restaurant is amazing! Once you set foot inside, you are transported into an old mexican courtyard. The prices are a bit high, but you are also paying for the beautiful experience inside. My friend and I sat at the beautiful bar and had a couple of refreshing margaritas. We ordered guacamole and the queso fundido with chorizo. I never order queso fundido with chorizo because i'm a bit picky, but this cheese was the absolute bomb! I will definitely go back with a large group of friends. I highly recommend just doing beverages and appetizers if your wallet is on a diet. Also if you are ever bored on a friday or saturday night, get there before 9:00 pm so you don't have to pay the $10 entrance and dance your booty away. This is definitely a hidden treasure I will help myself to more often..",0.992,0.711,0.253,0.036,0.5894603174603176
2006-01-23,4.0,"Jessica is right about the decor.  This place is a hidden jem.  The food is tasty (they have a decent mole dish here).  Prices can be a little high for the cuisine, but you'll have a good time.  Grab a bottle of Bohemia or Pacifico...and then a Margarita before dinner!  We came here for a birthday party, and they treated our group wonderfully.",0.933,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.5965306122448979
