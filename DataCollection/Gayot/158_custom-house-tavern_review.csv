2012-10-31,4.0,"Overall, very impressed with this place.  A friend of mine asked where a good place to eat.  This place would need to have a decent menu, more revolving around steak and potatoes) that all would be able to enjoy.  So, after providing at least 5 options, CHT was chosen.   The decor was very nice. Location was great (Printers Row) and close to the EL. Service was excellent.  Food was delicious (main course).  The desert was ok.  We tried a few things but nothing was orgasmic.   Unfortunately, a friend sent me an article indicating this restaurant will be closing effective 10/31/12.   Really unfortunate.  There were a few more items I would have loved to try from the menu. Sorry for not listing what we ate but since they've closed it doesn't matter anyways.  :-(",0.9822,0.705,0.25,0.046,0.6364583333333335

All in all, it is very unlikely I will go back there, the food is good, if a bit overpriced, and the service and attitude make it not with the time and aggravation.",0.0516,0.865,0.066,0.069,0.4690972222222223

2012-05-19,3.0,"I get a little irritated at restaurants that are unnecessarily pretentious, and I found this place a little obnoxious (Serving a circular slice of butter on a tile with sea salt on top is ridiculous).  It looks like every other upscale American tavern: modern decor, ""edgy"" touches, well-dressed waitstaff, etc.  Our server was kind of a jerk, too, especially after we told him we weren't headed to the theater and turned down the wine list, because I'm pregnant.  He even retorted that my husband wasn't pregnant!  Not a good first impression.  It is also perplexing to me when a restaurant has the trappings of a fancier place, but the waitstaff don't know how to read your silverware or to not interrupt to clear plates or crumbs or ask for the order.  I suppose it's possible that he decided that we were low class tourists and operated accordingly, but that's not exactly going to get me to recommend them.  We sat next to the window into the kitchen, which was a nice touch.  The only drawback was the time we saw a sous chef taste a dish with his pinky finger... If you're willing to put up with the service and the atmosphere contradicting themselves, the food is actually pretty good.  The server unbent enough to offer a custom soda with fig and vanilla syrup, which was sublime.  I had a plate of seasonal side dishes, which were all good, although everything was completely drowning in butter.  The squash casserole was delicious, and had a great crumb topping, but the squash itself (and the basil that is allegedly an ingredient) was overwhelmed by butter, cheese, and the crumb topping.  The wild mushroom saute was great: nice selection of mushrooms, well-seasoned, but served in a pool of butter (and garnished with an infused oil--overkill!).  The black-eyed peas were forgettable.  The standout was a mix of brussels sprouts and baby kohlrabi with mustard seeds.  To die for.  I would have preferred less butter, but the mustard and vegetables were perfect together.  My husband had a competently prepared steak with a delicious blue cheese butter (again with the butter!!!!) and really nice fries.   I liked that everything was fresh and seasonal: they clearly take a lot of pride in the ingredients and the preparation.  I wish that they would take less pride in the butter, though.  And I wish that the atmosphere was a bit more fresh and relaxed, like the food.",0.9968,0.743,0.198,0.059,0.5752893518518519

Despite the name including the word ""Tavern"" it's nothing like any actual tavern I've been to.

The Short Rib Pot Roast was really good, like one of the best entrees I've had so far this year. The meat was tender and everything was well-flavored. The drink (I don't know what it was called, but it was pink. My drink menu didn't have the cocktail page so I just for what my friend was drinking.) was also sweet and gingery (just gingery enough). The service on the other hand, was polite but slooow. We only had one course and we barely made it out of there in under an hour and a half  and we had a Show! To Catch! (It was. Shatner.) It didn't help that they made a mistake processing one of the credits cards and had to do it all over. The menu here is pretty small.

A place that doesn't overcook pork to where it's still moist and tender.  My friend ordered this medium.  Perfect because it will still pink in the middle.  Worried?  Don't be...the FDA said it was ok.  The spiced peanuts encrusting it were very flavorful.   4) Lake Superior Whitefish - Didn't try this one, but my friend finished his plate. * Sides:   1) Roasted Beet Risotto - Odd color that may have been off putting, but it was unique and had nice flavor.  I'm just a fan of ""normal"" risotto with mushrooms or asparagus, not red beets and walnuts.   2) Wild Mushrooms (Lemon & Herbs) - I could this as an entire meal.   * Desserts:   1) Brown Butter Medjool Date Tart - Who knew dates in tart would be so good?  Not to mention the spiced caramel/ pistachio ice cream was great too.  It was wonderful to have the spiciness of the tart to still linger after the bite.   2) Chocolate Caramel Ganache - Now normally I'm not heavy on the chocolate for dessert, but this ganache was velvety and smooth.  The best part was the salty ice cream.  It was the most unique.   There you have it.",0.9986,0.76,0.225,0.015,0.590817610062893

I will put it out there up front: it's not because they need to convince people their food is good. It is very good. it's because their location comparatively sucks, and it's hard to get people to trek down to the Harrison stop (also known as the point where the el starts turning a bit... hooker-y and sketchy) for a genre of comfort food more often found in Lincoln Park. Printer's Row is actually a cool neighborhood, but its mini-renaissance seems to have moved west. Familiar concept: same local source blah blah as everyone is doing now, but they've been doing it for a long time, and they're a really well-rehearsed place with a solid rotating seasonal menu. The last time I was here I went on someone else's Gilt deal for a Friday night, and we got many more courses than we otherwise would have. I had some sort of ravioli appetizer and the braised short ribs for an entree, which is the single best thing on their menu. Tremendously tender. Some type of flourless cake for dessert. I normally order cocktails - here, I order wine.  Total out the door was unbelievably affordable for a pretty lavish dinner. But it was weird how quiet this place was. It's got so much to offer and clearly has good service and a progressive chef/owner that cares about the food... but it's in the middle of nowhere, in a place that doesn't get restaurant attention and can't pull the crowds that Fulton Market (an even worse cesspool right under the green line and scattered between industrial alleyways) can by being the molecular gastronomy capitol of the city. Worth eating at full price - this place has a lot of heart and tasty food, and I feel sort of sad that it takes gimmicks to lure the customers now when I remember it being packed. But that was when this area had a lot more businesses than it did residences, and time has changed it in challenging ways. I'll still come here again.",0.9678,0.847,0.105,0.048,0.4735972222222222

Here's a view into the kitchen through the long, rectangular window in the dining room that was decorated with pumpkins and gourds.  The team at work....   The passed hors d'oeuvres were wonderful and, might I say, right up my alley.  They definitely spoke to the abilities of the team in the kitchen.  I chatted with the owner for a brief moment (who is lovely, by the way) and she expressed how pleased she is with what they've got going in regards to the food.  I certainly would be too, if I was her. Smoked Whitefish with Apples on Pumpernickel.  Smoky, nutty, sweet, crisp, creamy; yummy! A burger bite.   A fried oyster with remoulade served in its shell.   Duck rillette with pickled raisins.   And my fave:  chicken liver mousse with pickled grapes on brioche.  I had 2 of these.   There was a pretty sweet spread of cheese and desserts, too.   Four or 5 cheeses with grapes, dried figs and toasty, salty almonds.   Pretty desserts, too!   Panna cotta, a dense fudgey thingy, mini cheesecake, some filled ginger cookie deliciousness and a couple of different gelees. Oh!  And Custom House Tavern is hosting one of the Baconfest satellite dinners.  Apparently, the demand for the smokey, salty pork product could not be satisfied by the sole annual Baconfest event itself.  A bunch of restos are hosting a dinner with a menu dedicated to pig belly.  Custom House's is on December 8th.  I've heard promise of the inclusion of bacon in every course from hors d'oeuvres like PB, banana & bacon mini sammies & bacon fritters to desserts like brown butter and bacon fat blondie with maple ice cream.  Hey, nothin' wrong with that!",0.9969,0.772,0.204,0.024,0.6383114395183361

2012-01-10,3.0,"Really deserves a 3 1/2 but since the Yelp gods have not granted us such, 3 it is. Custom House is a quiet alcove tucked away on a busy corner (Congress & Dearborn). Definitely a great, upscale-ish addition to the Printer's Row restaurant scene. Lovely, minimalist, modern space, comfy seats, good drinks. My dad and I came here for the prix fixe Thanksgiving Dinner and it was truly absolutely delicious. At least once a week, I still dream about those shredded, marinated Brussels sprouts. But it was such a small portion, it was laughable. In fact, it seemed we and everyone sitting around us finished our meals in about 3.75 minutes and then were sitting there looking at each other wistfully like, ""hmmm...sure was good."" The quality of the food is the star, here. Everything is super fresh and for the most part they buy local or make what they serve in house. The vanilla ice cream that was part of the dessert, for example, was home made -- and delicious.  One of the best kept secrets here (I'm about to spill it!) is the Sunday brunch. It's always quiet -- almost eerie quiet and empty -- but I like that. I can read my New York Times at the table without worrying that I'm table-hogging. The service is great and the selection of breakfast food, while not particularly innovative, is solid. My only quibble with Custom House is that everything seems a scootch overpriced for the relatively small portions. Nobody is expecting gluttinous ""super sized"" portions, but certainly more than 3 or 4 bites for the price. Perhaps it's because the restaurant is connected to the hotel next door that the prices are a bit jacked, but I, frankly, always feel like I've spent too much for what I get.  Is Custom House a destination restaurant? No. Is it a good option for people in or around Printers Row and the South Loop? Sure.

The burger itself was very tasty.  It may be the best $5 burger I've ever eaten!  True to the waitress's promise, it was cooked to the right temperature.  The toppings and seasoning worked well, somehow giving your mouth a new flavor during or after every bite.  I don't know how they did that.  The fires were also an exemplary version of skin-on fries.  Yum! That said, it isn't a burger I would go back for at full price.  Instead, you might find me stopping by the bar for french fries and the WTF porter, a collaboration between the chef and Goose Island.  My beer may have cost more than my discounted burger but it was worth it.

The restaurant is modern but without the coldness that usually accompanies that genre of decor and has a more formal atmosphere without  feeling pretentious.  The service was GREAT even though I'm sure the burger special was annoying as hell (having spent many years in the service industry I can tell you specials can be a server's worst nightmare - cheap food or drinks and people tend not to tip on the pre-special price, even though the server did the same amount of work. TO ALL DEAL SEEKERS (and I am definitely one of them): tip your server well! It's rude and bad etiquette not to, and trust me, as a former server, WE REMEMBER YOU.) but we were treated with the utmost respect and courtesy despite being cheap asses.  Ok so now that that's off my chest, on to the burger! It was delicious. Juicy, full of flavor, and all around awesome burger. The fries were perfect, crisp on the outside and perfectly seasoned.

I'd like to reiterate that 1. we were in THE BAR (not the restaurant.) 2. it was FRIDAY NIGHT. 3. we were spending MONEY. We weren't even being that loud! Since when is laughter such a bad thing? Meanwhile, there was a couple sitting at the bar who were literally having a tickle fight. I'm not kidding and they were not admonished.

For the price, there are many finer places I'd rather visit.  (And I'm one of those people who gets annoyed when I see low reviews because people say food is good but expensive.)   On one visit I had a duck dish that was fairly bland and had no texture whatsoever.  On another I had a chewy beef dish.  It would be passable for a $10 or $15 meal, but I certainly expected more from such a highly-regarded restaurant.",0.9274,0.786,0.152,0.063,0.6041666666666666

Outrageously expensive, but great service and interesting and unusual menu offerings along with standard items.  Look for specials, like their summer $25 dinner choices of fried chicken, grilled steak or pork.  Other entres are at $30+. Wanted oysters so ordered 6...AT $3 EACH!   Ahhhhhhhhhhh:  $18 and I was just starting. Drinks were $10 each...good pours, but not a place to regularly inbibe. One of their specials is their burger, which people rave over, and the other is mussels, chorizo and fries, offered in two sizes.  I opted for the appetizer size and was glad I did as the regular portion was huge and more than I could handle. The mussels were done in beer and along with spices had small squares of minced sausage.  Scooping a spoon-full of mussel, sausage, beer sauce, along with a soggy fry or a hunk of bread was very flavorful and heavenly.  Not as good as mussels at Alexandria, VA's Magestic, but almost. The fries were pretty worthless:  soggy and oily.  I ate a few but left the rest preferring the fresh, soft bread for sopping. Two drinks, 6 oysters and appetizer portion of mussels was $57.  If you were with a friend and had main courses you would be well over $100 even sharing an appetizer and having a glass or wine or a couple of drinks between you both. Service was excellent, the menu interesting and the food good, but a little too rich, price-wise, for me to fully enjoy it.  For what they charge I would rather go to one of the main-line upscale steak houses.",0.9973,0.75,0.238,0.012,0.5221440018315018

For appetizers I had the Carrot Mint Risotto, and he had the French Onion soup.  I found the risotto to be delicately flavored, well prepared and very delightful.  His French Onion soup was smooth, flavorful, and tasted fresh.  The cheese on top was ooey and gooey, and nothing like any other French Onion Soup we've had before. As for Entree's, he had the Tavern steak with Blue Cheese butter and a side of French Fries.  The fries were perfectly crisp! Without having to request that they be done ""extra crispy"" (which is what we usually tell a server)  The steak was tender, and very flavorful. I had the Lake Michigan white fish over the polenta and wild mushrooms.  I requested no shrimp due to dietary restrictions, and they were happy to accommodate.  The fish was light, flaky, and the skin was perfectly crispy.  The flavors all went well together. Overall, our experience at Custom House was incredible.  From the moment we walked in until we left, we felt as though the staff was attentive, happy to help, and the food stood on it's own. Only con was that it got pretty busy (was a Saturday night after all) around 7:30-8, which made the waitress less attentive then when we first walked in.  Something like that is understandable and out of their control.  When they did come around, they were always very attentive and available if we needed them.

From top to bottom: perfectly fried egg, a little bit of hollandaise sauce(I think?), beautiful bread that the most amazing texture that I can't properly describe, slices of shaved ham, cheese and another slice of that amazing bread.

So we travel down there and walk into a dead empty restaurant.  I'm already thinking that this is not going to be the amazing dining experience I had hoped if NOBODY ELSE IS INTERESTED IN HAVING IT.  The hostess asks ""Will you be joining us for brunch?""  I say no, for lunch actually?  Thank you.  You'd think this would be a good time to let me in on the secret.  Nah.  She says ""Oh, okay, great!""  She seats us with two menus...for brunch. A second person comes out to take our drink orders.  I'm looking at the menu with a you're-about-to-piss-me-off-aren't-you? kind of face because I don't come all the way downtown on a Saturday for expensive coffee and fancy descriptions of egg sandwiches when we've got that in spades in the Logan Square.  I ask for lunch menus.  ""Ohhh it's just brunch right now!""  Well, when do you start serving lunch?  Subtext: ANY TIME IS A GOOD TIME TO OFFER THIS INFORMATION ON YOUR OWN.  But no.  Custom House seems to like for you to guess what the hell is going on.  I guess there's not much else to do in a dead-ass empty restaurant.

No yummy appetizer.  The burgers, one of the only two non-brunch foods on the menu, were sloppy and the buns were soggy: just a wet mess everywhere and without any redeeming flavor.  Why don't I just roll around on the floor at the stockyard? The waitstaff confused the hell out of us, as three different people (including the hostess, the clueless waiter, and a third party) took turns waiting on us.  That, and they were the opposite of forthcoming with information.  Like lunch and dinner hours were classified and required high-level clearance.  The two employees who had the chance to explain to us how the restaurant operated just ran away like one of us had farted.

Hubs and I would be deep in conversation and he would come up to clear a plate or glass or ask if we wanted anything. It happened several times and was very disturbing. I have three ss who all have or do wait tables and from what they've said, this is serving 101. 2.5 So the food; it was really good. It wasn't as creative or unique as we expected, but what we had was really good. We started with the seared sea scallops on braised pork belly & lemon risotto - tastes were fantastic, pork belly could have been cooked a little more. I then had the winter vegetable salad & hubs had the butternut squash soup. The salad had cured pork head on it, which I can now say I've had, but it was nothing special. The butternut squash soup with the homemade marshmallow was incredible!! Hubs had the NY strip and I had the braised pork rib. Both were fantastic. The rib was just delicious and tender and the whipped potatoes were divine!! The chard that came with it was good too. The NY strip was cooked nicely and tasted good, the creamed chard was not good. 4 I love when I can make it to south loop since I live in gold coast/river north area, there's not much reason to venture down. Custom House Tavern was good, but I probably won't be back unless we happen to be down there.",0.9963,0.778,0.175,0.047,0.5863655969634232

2011-01-30,5.0,"""JUST GO!"" is all I can say. Maybe a bit more... I sat at the bar and had the chef's tasting menu. The bartender Yin (I think that was his name) was super knowledgable about the food and was quite professional. I ordered their signature tequila drink and waited about 10 - 15 for it. Yin then cam back and asked whatI'd like to drink. I reminded him that I wanted the tequila drink. He was a bit embarrassed for forgetting. Later on during the meal, he said that the drink was on him. Quite nice! Now for the courses: 1) Poached shrimp served in a spoon with chives I think. - tasty 2) Frisee salad with bacon, yogurt dressing and chick pea puree sprinkled with smoked paprika. Amazing! But the bacon was not impressive - like of like the precooked bacon you find at your grocer. But the paprika was well smoked and gave more substance to the dressing and puree making the frisee delicious, 3) Scallops and Pork Belly with cherry mustard - ""sublime"" came to mind while I was eating. two delicate flavors complemented each other perfectly and the mustard gave it that zing. 4) Short ribs - super moist and tender that melted in my mouth easier than ice cream. 5) Chocolate ganache with homemade ginger ice cream - they both danced together excelently. The rich ganache was tempered by the light and airy ginger ice cream. The ginger wasn't too potent either. I should have asked for some it to go! Custom House can be a tad pricey but when you get chance to go, treat yourself to a wonderful meal.",0.9835,0.85,0.137,0.013,0.6241228070175439
2011-01-30,5.0,"Chicago truly has these lovely places where the food is delicious and the atmosphere does not reflect pretense. Everything about my Custom House Tavern experience was top notch. I really like the fact that the restaurant was easy to get to. It took us a bit of time to get seated, seems like the maitre 'd was quite familiar with the guests before us. Coat check was super friendly. We came here with a Groupon for the chef's tasting menu, and what I really like about this tasting menu is that it truly highlights some of the best that this restaurant has to offer and plays to its strengths - meat, potatoes, midwestern food done well with various flavors, nothing too mysterious, and we were on a budget so we didn't get any drinks, but the service continued to be phenomenal. Amuse-bouche - I believe this was a herring ceviche. It was a bit overwhelmed by the lettuce bed first course - roasted squash salad with frisee, bacon, and maple yogurt. The maple yogurt was my favorite part of the dish, but the frisee was overly sour to my liking second course - scallop with pork belly on polenta with a raspberry jam on top and lemon zest on the bottom. I believe. No complaints here - though my cut of pork belly was a bit on the lean side. A rich and very satisfying dish that almost made me want to lick the last crumbs off the plate. The lemon zest cinched it. third course - the famous beef short ribs with potato puree, cipollinis, winter greens, and tomato jam. Hands down, had this been my only dish (and the scallop), Custom House would have blown me away with a 5.  Dessert - a very generous chocolate ganache with coconut shavings and a very light ginger ice cream. I found the treatment of the ice cream to be elegant, but as I'm not a chocolate lover, can't really comment on the ganache. One amusing thing is when you look around at a table that is being cleared, one of the waiters will iron down the table cloth. That is impeccable attention to detail. I absolutely love the dining room chairs... I feel like I can lean comfortably back without feeling overwhelmed. The ambiance was also extremely laid back, I didn't need to strain my voice to have a conversation at all.",0.995,0.782,0.184,0.034,0.5361561561561562
2011-01-27,4.0,"A friend of mine bought the Groupon for the Chef's choice menu at Custom House and asked me to join in for the experience.  The entrance was slightly odd as there were two doors and signs were posted on one of the two doors indicating ""please use other door"".  So at first I walked around the building only to find that was the only door and it was just referring to using the other ""half"" of the door.  Not the best start, but upon entering the hostess was very nice.  She offered to take my coat and after finding out my dinner mate was not yet there she suggested I sit in the waiting chair or head to the bar for a drink.  Upon taking in the decor I was fairly impressed.  Very open and minimal as to be expected in this type of establishment.  The bar area was a little congested but it offered a buzzing vibe which is not entirely bad.  Minutes later my friend arrived and we were taken back to our booth seating.  I really liked our location because the window to the chef's station was right next to us and I could watch all of the chefs in back cooking away.  This was a great touch!  Our server was delightfully unpretentious and very easy going.  We told him my friend had a Groupon and I was hoping to order in a way that allowed us both to be eating at the same time.  He suggested I choose an appetizer along with an entree and that would set us up perfectly.  I went with the flank as my entree and gnocchi as my appetizer.  Paired with a fantastic warm concoction of pinot nior, brandy, cherries, mulled spices and some other wonderful flavors.  First off we received the complimentary small salad and it was very good.  I was served my gnocchi next and it was fantastic!  There were large pieces of tenderly cooked duck meat mixed in and the flavors were amazing.  Next up was my friend's scallops on lemon polenta accompanied by pork belly and a raspberry accent.  I was lucky enough to get a taste and this was just delicious.  Next up was my flank steak cooked perfectly at medium rare and accompanied by a mild reduction, fries and an absolutely delicious side of greens.  All were very well thought out and I enjoyed each very much.  Last but not least my friend let me try the dark chocolate cake with ice cream...seriously out of this world.  The flavors were exploding in my mouth!  What a great end to a really well done dining experience.  The only caveat, I don't make enough dough to allow me to come back often.  If you are looking for a great meal and you don't mind dropping some moolah to do so...definitely stop in at Custom House!  Don't forget to ask to be seated near the chefs window.",0.9993,0.743,0.25,0.008,0.5399047619047617

2011-01-24,5.0,"As much as I loved my omakase experience at Takashi, there's a new player in town, and the entity in the once (and still) downtrodden South Loop.  Yes - there is the Blake hotel on one side of Custom House, and Congress Parkway on the other.  Depending on where you sit, you can get a great view of the BP station.  Categorically: Location: 5 out of 5 Easy walking distance for me.  Public transportation facile with the Red Line Harrison stop, the Blue Line LaSalle Stop, and the 22 Clark Bus.  Should you need to park, there does exist some street parking, but if you know your away around the neighborhood, you can probably find a public pay lot for cheaper. Service: 5 out of 5 Just as trained as Takashi's, just as friendly, but with an extra bit of charisma.  Everyone from the nice redheaded gal who took our coats to our actual server, to the people who cleared the plates and refilled bread/water were spot on.  Super attentive and quick to notice when things were amiss, but not overbearing.  I have no greater example of their attention to detail than the fact that while I was in the restroom, they did NOT clear my empty plate from the table, but instead waited until I returned to ask if it would be ok.   Quality: 5 out of 5 As Heather D alluded on her 1/20/11 review, the bartender was was an older woman wearing, gasp - of all things, a plain gray turtleneck.  To others' credit and heads up, the tequila old fashioned with home made vermouth was astounding.  Sweet but with a kick of spice, it went down smooth and cozy.  As countless others did, we went with our Groupons in hand, and were treated to a very well arranged 4 course meal.   The amuse bouche was in essence, a very light spring salad with vinaigrette and anchovy, on top of a toast.   Nothing terrible to say about that, but nothing that would really jump out at me either. Course 1 was a grilled squash with bacon and greens, accompanied by a sweet mayo'ish sauce.  The grilled squash was actually quite the pairing with the mayo sauce, and I thought that the two fit quite well.   Course 2 consisted of scallops on pork belly, all on top of lemon flavored polenta.  Gastronomical orgasm was the best way to describe the pork belly.  I've had the best of pork belly dishes at Tony Hu's empire, and even Takashi did an impressive pork belly, but this one...absolutely transcendental.  I mean - the scallops were cooked perfectly, and had I not been whisked off to pig belly heaven, I would have said, ""these scallops are phenomenal.""  Well, I'm still saying that, but they were overshadowed by the pork belly. Course 3 was a decadent, well-seared but incredibly rare and tender steak with onion and lightly sauteed spinach.  I made the off-comment half-jokingly that the steak I had at Custom House was better than Gibson's, and as I took every bite, I realized more and more that perhaps I was onto something there.  The only complaint I had of the evening also also attributed to the steak, however.  I had a little strand of sinew that just wouldn't cut easily.  But small complaints compared to how good it tasted. Course 4 was dessert: a semi sweet (I would almost say bittersweet) chocolate ganache with some type of ice cream and a fruity reduction on the side.  The ganache was lightly rolled in what looked like white chocolate/nutty nougat.   I love dark chocolate, what can I say.  I had no complaints here. What I thought Custom House did better than Takashi, however - was the wine pairing.  Yes, I realize that it's easy to pair a dessert moscat with dark chocolate, and it's probably not terribly difficult to find a robust red wine that goes with steak.  But I would mention that the one of the only food-related complaints I had at Takashi was with one of the wine pairings, whereas Custom House executed each wine pairing flawlessly. Portion Size: 3 out of 5 Not the biggest, but come on - it's a tasting menu, not a buffet.   Pricing: 3 out of 5 Subjective, I guess.  Since my girly friendy paid for the groupons and thus my meal, and paid for my drink and the tip, it was free for me (hell yeah).  But if I were paying out of pocket, I would rate 30$ as being reasonable for the tasting menu and 60$ as being somewhat on the high end.  The 30$ wine flight I thought was commensurate with others, and had added value because of the excellent execution with food pairings.   Decor: 4 out of 5 They got what they were looking for - an upscale ""lodge"" looking experience with the layered stones next to the kitchen, almost resembling a fireplace.  Whereas some restaurants will go with frosted glass for the kitchen viewing area, Custom House was completely transparent (haha pun intended) with their viewing area.  Might I compliment the chef on his excellent ink, too.  Seating was on comfortable microfibre chaises, with larger ""booth"" areas in the back for bigger parties. Overall: 5 out of 5.  Out of space now.  Peace.",0.9994,0.78,0.192,0.028,0.5387773642346811
2011-01-20,5.0,"I went to the Custom House Tavern for a four course chef's tasting menu (I had a Groupon to use up). The experience was sublime from the service to the food to the company. I showed up a little bit earlier than my date. The host took my coat and I went to the bar to get a cocktail. The bartender was an older woman - I love to see a good woman bartender (not some trixie with a shot tray). The cocktail line-up was impressive with a selection of about 12 craft cocktails. There was even a sazerac on the menu and the fact that they make their own vermouth totally scored them some points. I went on the bartenders suggestion and ordered a tequila old fashioned. This was simple cocktail of repisido tequila, house made vermouth, and brandied cherries. I would have never considered this sort of tequila cocktail, but I do adore Manhattans so this wasn't that far off. The cocktail was superb and I got a little buzzed before my date showed up. I also have to say that the beer and wine list were well put together, but it's hard to choose one of those when you can put the skills of the bartender to work. The dining room is dimly lit and cozy. It's decorated in darker earthy tones and the booths are arranged for an intimate meal. The only thing I would change is the view. We were looking out a window at the bustling Congress Parkway and a BP station across the street. That's Chicago for you! The service was first class. I don't think I emptied 1/4th of my water glass before someone showed up to refill it. Also, I tend to be a messy eater, but you wouldn't know because after each tasting someone was there to sweep away the crumbs and hide my shame. What struck me as interesting was when we were first seated I went to put the white napkin on my lap a waiter walked up and offered me a darker one. I can only assume it was because I was wearing a black dress? I've never seen that before.  Guess I don't eat at enough classy joints. But let's get to what we all came here for...the food. The waiter explained that the chef's tasting was a 'best of'. If this meal was designed to show off the skill of the chef he certainly did a fantastic job. The evening started off with an amuse bouche consisting of poached shrimp on a horseradish creme fresh. My palette was certainly stimulated by the creaminess of the shrimp and pop form the horseradish. First tasting was a roasted butternut squash salad. Now, anyone who knows me well knows that in my world I don't eat salads. No matter how many times I try I just can't seem to choke down a salad. However, I cleared my plate on this one. The salad was a frisee salad with a tangy vinaigrette. It was served over some roasted butternut squash and there was some bacon mixed in as well. The bacon was okay, but I think that the dish would have been fine without it (and that would be something I rarely say). The real stand out was the Greek yogurt on the side. It was homemade and mixed with maple, but the stunner was the dash of paprika on top! A winning flavor combination that i will certainly try at home.  This combination just makes total sense a dash of smokey spice with the rich tang of the yogurt. The next course was scallops and pork belly which to me is like saying let me wrap up a night of awesome sex in bacon.  The scallop was served over the pork belly and some grits. I really wanted to lick the bowl and could have eaten 5 more servings. By far this was the best dish.  I really feel that the scallops and pork belly speak for themselves.  Is your mouth watering yet? The main entree was short ribs. They were certainly tasty and cooked well, but didn't stand out. I also prefer mine still on the bone, but these were served like a piece of pot roast over some mashed potatoes that lacked flavor. Still a good dish, but not blown away like the other courses. Dessert was a chocolate ganache coated in sea salt and served with a dollop of cinnamon ice cream. The ice cream was the winning element of this dish, but the ganache was the perfect way to end the meal. Would I go back and pay full price for this meal? Yes, but only if I had some Gs to spend or it was a special occasion.  They are offering $5 burgers during January so I think I will pop back to the bar for another cocktail and one of those sometime soon.",0.999,0.824,0.159,0.018,0.5359066859066859
2011-01-14,4.0,"It was my first time to Custom House last night, and I'd go back again. We went to use our Groupon, and like others diners have said, the 4-course tasting menu really was awesome - they did not spare any service or food quality for Groupon diners. The amuse bouche at the beginning - shrimp with creme fraiche - was so light and fresh. The frisee, bacon and butternut squash salad course wasn't my favorite - the bacon kind of seemed like it had been cooked the day before and taken out of the fridge 2 minutes before being thrown on the salad. But the next 3 courses redeemed the failed salad: delicious pork belly with scallops, followed by short ribs cooked to perfection; then dessert of super-rich chocolate ganache with a sea-salt crust and accompanying spicy ice cream. I ate half the dessert, declared I was wayyyy too full to finish, and then proceeded to devour the entire second half. It was just that good. In terms of atmosphere, I had been to Spring a couple of times and was hoping for a similar ambience. Custom House doesn't have the same sort of quiet peacefulness that Spring did, but I still enjoyed our comfy little booth.

I had the salmon which was so perfectly cooked, and the almonds gave the dish great texture.  Two of my girls had the beef short ribs which were amazing.  The meet was SO soft and the bursting with flavor- not too sweet not too salty.  One of them practically licked her plate clean!  Another had the walleye which was very tasty also, especially with the mushrooms and green beans.  And one ordered the pork loin (medium) which was a huge portion and quite good.   Desserts were also fantastic but we just had tastes of it because we were so full!  The chestnut cake and hickory ice cream was SO perfect for the winter.  Brought back memories of my childhood with roasted chestnuts.  The panna cotta was delicious with some lingenberry sauce that added the right amount of tartness to it.   I know this is long but I had to give Custom House Tavern the review it deserved.  The service was perfect.  I know we were practically the only ones there on a Sunday night but they weren't too overbearing, and one of the chefs came out to say hi!  =)",0.9988,0.735,0.247,0.017,0.6652678571428571

My scallops were overcooked and the pork belly was too fatty.  I understand that pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but I think I only got one or two bites of meat.  The rest I just had to leave on my plate.  Anyway, it was served on top of grits.  The grits didn't really bring anything to the dish at all, so I didn't see the point in them.  The third course was probably the best. Beef short ribs, again slightly overcooked, but quite good tasting.  The chard was perfectly cooked and the potato puree was delicious as well.  Dessert was good.  Ganache with ice cream.  Nothing special.  We had a delicious bottle of Pinot Noir and I was quite impressed with both their wine and cocktail lists.  All in all, it was good, just not great.  I'm glad we had a groupon.  If I could go with 3.5 stars, I would.",0.9972,0.74,0.224,0.036,0.5318936877076413

2010-12-05,4.0,"Living in the South Loop, I often whine that there aren't enough good restaurants here (because there aren't).  But I often forget about this little gem, and I really shouldn't.  I've dined here a few times before, twice very recently, and this last time was so very good that I felt compelled to write a review.   My friend and I went for dinner and we both had the chef's tasting menu.  Consisting of items from their menu, they refer to it as the ""best of"" Custom House.  And it really is.  It's normally $60/ea. but I managed to snag a Groupon so it was only $40/ea.  First course is the roasted squash salad with this incredibly yummy maple yogurt, which pairs beautifully with the crisp bacon.  Next was the sea scallop with pork belly which sat on a bed of lemon grits.  To. Die. For.  This might've knocked the main course out of the spot as my favorite, but I still haven't decided.  Both the scallop and pork belly were cooked to perfection.  The main course was short ribs topped with a delicious tomato jam and much like the pork belly and scallop--cooked to perfection.  My least favorite part of the meal was dessert.  But I'll admit, I'm not a big dessert person and unless it's something extraordinary, I usually don't order it.  It was some rich chocolate cake but more like fudge bar consistency, with a small dollop of cream and some sort of orange glaze on the side.  It was good, but I could've done without it. Every time that I've been there, service has always been very good and attentive and at the right balance.  They aren't overbearing but stop by just enough to make sure you have everything you need and are enjoying your food.  The servers also seem very knowledgeable about the menu and can make suggestions.  Also, the time between courses is just right.  I think our dinner went on for about two hours so we certainly didn't feel rushed, nor did we feel like we were tapping our fingers on the table waiting for the next course.",0.9953,0.781,0.177,0.042,0.5231726674409602

Bittersweet chocolate ganache, just a few bites to finish the meal.  Had coffee, which was on the weak side, if you like stout coffee, order the espresso.

Our server was very gracious and nice, without any weird awkwardness when the Groupon topic came up. I also ordered a cocktail.. I forget the exact name but it was the only one on the menu under the ""bubbly"" section. It was a combination of plum wine and cava - definitely liked it. Amuse Bouche: smelt with watercress - very fresh tasting. Liked it! 1st course: salad with apple, black radish, and poached shrimp with buttermilk dressing and poppy seeds - good, though the radish was a little bitter. The flavors were pretty subtle but went together pretty well. my boyfriend had the roasted squash salad with frisee, candied pecans, and maple yogurt. yum! Definitely digged the roasted squash. It was seasoned a little with smoked paprika which gave it a kick. 2nd course: chestnut soup with sea scallops, matsutake mushrooms, and golden raisins. The soup was DELICIOUS! So much so that I could have forgone the rest of the components, even though they weren't too bad either. Scallops were a good addition, the matsutake mushrooms (my first time having them, I admit I was really excited) didn't really match flavorwise, and the golden raisins added some sweetness. Overall, I liked it though the flavors didn't all go together.  My boyfriend got the same thing without scallops and more mushrooms. vegetarian approved. 3rd course: steak with butternut squash puree, mushrooms, and sweet potato. yum! the steak was done perfectly and the puree and potato were delicious.  my boyfriend had cauliflower instead of the steak, which came with a red wine reduction. the cauliflower was (disappointingly) completely unseasoned. no salt or pepper at all. =[ 4th course: we had a bavarian dessert which was basically cornbread covered with milk chocolate, blueberries, and (what i think are) roasted cocoa beans. very good, and creative.

The dessert was the best course by far. No complaints, great flavor combinations and the textures were fantastic with the fig and coco nibs. The other courses were just ok to me.

2010-09-19,5.0,"After visiting Blackbird last month, my fiance and I decided to go to a new place every month in the same caliber and rate it side by side.  Getting reservations - both were easy with friendly staff Waiting for our reserved table - Custom House had it ready, Blackbird was an additional 20 minute wait. Service - both were impeccable and on top of everything. Lag time between courses - Custom House timed it perfectly. Seating - Custom House is more intimate as opposed to the neighbors dining at elbow length at Blackbird. Here is where Custom House blew Blackbird out of the water: The sweetbread course was perfectly cleaned. It was delicious, well seasoned, well crisped. The heirloom tomato dish is hard to mess up. The tomatoes speak for the plate. But I did love the thai basil instead of the Italian style.  The corn soup was velvety and sweet. Our entrees, the short rib was exactly how the fiance wanted it. He was looking for a meat dish done to perfection. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just good food. My philosophy is keep innovation and new tricks to the smaller courses, like apps and amuses. The main dish can have new elements, but don't mess with it too much. At the end of the day, we all just want good food. My dish was the wild spot bass, which had a nice touch of citrus foam. I didn't expect that, but it balanced the fish with flavor without overdoing the salt. The lemon polenta with shrimp was just a great touch to the perfectly cooked bass.  The cheese plate was wonderful with the accompaniments. I just wish we got to choose our selections. the fig armagnac ice cream was beautiful.

The ensuing ceviche was a great refresher, as was the chilled cucumber soup with pickled shrimp and watermelon. That soup was amazing; the barely bitter soup mixed well with the fresh watermelon and the sweet shrimp. Next was the bass with eggplant puree and some heirloom tomatoes.

2010-08-22,3.0,"When, oh when, will I learn the a restaurant serving contemporary American food is not for me? Because the dictionary definition of ""contemporary American"" seems to be a small portion of odd food combinations artfully presented with high prices. But I bought a Groupon for it anyways, $30 for the $60 tasting menu, because every so often I forget. We visited on a Sunday night at 6:30pm, there were some tables filled but not a lot. Our waiter was very friendly and explained each course to us, timing between courses was good. The interior is modern and comfortable. The tasting menu is four courses selected by the chef. Most of the food tasted good but they should have brought it out on smaller plates because the portions were laughably small. We started off with an amuse bouche, followed by a cold cucumber soup with shrimp. The fish portion was a seabass over squash and a puree of some vegetable, the meat portion was three small pieces of a NY strip steak over sweet corn puree with oyster mushrooms. Dessert was a plum tart with hazelnut ice cream. I'm not a big fan of cold soup and am not overly wild about plums but those dishes were still OK, the fish was prepared very nicely and the steak was very good but I actually went home still a little hungry.

The first course was a very good cucumber soup with shrimp. The bass with eggplant puree was my favorite course, but the third, flatiron steak, left something to be desired. The steak was overshadowed by sweet corn puree that was great in its own right - maybe more seasoning or some spice could have brought the focus back to the steak. The cocktails were excellent, particularly the caraway syrup and whiskey cocktail, which was like a sweeter take on a Manhattan. My wife enjoyed the caprese cocktail, which was surprisingly close to actual caprese salad. If you are a fan of the salad, you can expect to enjoy the drink.

2010-08-02,4.0,I bought the 4-course chef tasting menu Groupon for Custom House and took an out of town friend. I expected it to be good as Chef Eric Aubriot is the chef for a couple months before the permanent chef shows up on Sept 1. The market inspired chef tasting menu had a common flavor of fennel. The first course was aparagus with a foie gras mousseline which was light but smooth and wonderful. The second course was scallops which was fantastic. The third course was a duck breast with a cauliflower puree. Didn't like the duck breast that much but dessert finished it off very well. Dessert was a toasted fennel cake with berries and whipped cream.  I would definately go back but beware the prices on the menu are on the higher end.  I started the meal with a ginger margarita which was sooo good!,0.9669,0.83,0.152,0.017,0.43555555555555553
2010-08-02,3.0,"We also had the 4-course Groupon tasting. It was good, but I'm glad we paid $30 and not $60. To start the chef sent out a complimentary amuse bouche of duck sausage, which was a pleasant surprise because sometimes you only get the bare minimum when you have a Groupon. This came at the same time as a the bread: a crusty white and a slightly sweet wheat. All good. Before we started our tasting we ordered the veal sweetbreads, which were excellent and my favorite dish of the night. The crunch of the light breading and rich flavor of the sweetbreads was perfectly matched to the light, creamy celery root puree, while the meyer lemon capers and golden raisins add the perfect amount of salty and sweet. It was a perfectly balanced dish. The vegetable course of the tasting was asparagus with foie gras mousseline. This was my least favorite dish. I thought the asparagus was oddly soft and tasteless while the mousseline was oily and didn't taste much like foie gras. It was also hard to eat, as the mousseline slipped right off of the asparagus. It wasn't bad; it was just a lot of soft food without much flavor. The second course was soft shell crab which was lightly dusted in cornmeal on a bed of fennel (and maybe apple?) with orange and grapefruit slices. I was excited to see soft shell crab on the tasting menu. The crab was a little too much shell and not very much crab, but that seems to be the norm with soft shell crab. I don't like things dusted with cornmeal - to me it's too grainy as a coating - but it's used often enough that I seem to be in the minority. I think the best part was the grapefruit slices, which really brightened up the dish and made me think more seafood and shellfish should be paired with grapefruit. Still, it was a large, flavorful dish that I wasn't expecting to get for only $30. The meat course was sliced duck breast on a cauliflower puree. The duck was very tasty and perfectly cooked and I don't know what they do to their cauliflower puree but it has a surprisingly deep, earthy flavor. It was a good, rich dish that came at the perfect point in the meal. Finally, for dessert, we had toasted fennel cakes with peach sorbet, fresh blackberries, small pistachios and lemon balm, which was fantastic. Toasting the fennel cakes was a great idea as it held up under the flavorful sorbet well. The blackberries were very fresh and had just a bit of tartness and those baby pistachios were phenomenally good. A very bright dish that ends the meal on an up note. We finished with perfect coffee. Service was very good. The welcome when we arrived was warm and quick, we were seated immediately even though we had arrived a little early (in a booth that looked right into the kitchen) and our waiter was helpful and friendly though never overbearing. A few times the person who brought our food described what was on the plate and then the waiter came by a few moments later and described it all again, but I'd rather have them try too hard than ignore us. Wine selection is very good, with a wide variety of price points and options. The meal was hit-or-miss over all, but nothing was actually bad and when it was good it was great (like the sweetbreads). It sometimes felt like the same flavors and techniques were being repeated over and over, like fennel, duck, a piece of fruit in every dish and purees. However, I would like to try Custom House and order from the regular menu, as it looks delicious.",0.9995,0.733,0.24,0.027,0.5734262820512821

2010-07-26,4.0,"I've been wanting to have dinner at Custom House for a while, and finally was able to do so recently. In a nutshell, the experience was well worth the wait! Highly recommended for your next special occasion, or just to treat yourself!  The decor is lovely and quite relaxing. I also enjoyed the relative quiet of the restaurant. I was dining with old friends so we wanted to be able to talk, and it was a treat not to be talking over a loud room or too-loud background music.  Of course, one really comes for the food, which was very very good. We shared appetizers to start: the calamari (good but a little too chewy IMHO), the gnocchi with peas and asparagus (excellent), and the heirloom beet salad with goat cheese (fantastic). I had the beef shortribs, which were very good. The accompanying onion rings and mashed potatoes were excellent. My friends each had a fish or seafood dish, and all were impressed.  Drinks and dessert also deserve a mention. Several of us had a house martini that had local North Shore vodka, cranberry juice, and ginger syrup. I loved it, and we all had two! The ginger really added a unique touch. For dessert I shared the dark chocolate mousse with cherries and sesame ice cream--again, unique and outstanding!  The meal was quite expensive, but: 1) the price was in keeping with other restaurants of this quality; and 2) we didn't hold back at all: foregoing the extra $12 martinis, for example, could have reduced the cost (but wouldn't have been as much fun!).  I am giving four stars instead of five pending another visit, and also because our server was competent but somewhat brusque. Nothing too terrible (and everyone else, hostess, busboys, etc. were very pleasant and efficient), but enough that several of our group commented on it during dinner and then again later.  All in all, an outstanding experience. I'm looking forward to going back.",0.9964,0.792,0.197,0.011,0.5215097402597403

I made reservations for 7:00pm on a Saturday night, and was surprised to find the restaurant half empty upon arrival (or half full--I guess I'm forever a pessimist). Personally, I found the decor drool-inducing. Sometimes I wish I were a bachelor just so I could decorate my imaginary one bedroom, high rise condo in just such a fashion just as Custom House. Fun. The service was hit or miss. Our server seemed to hate us from the get go. I think the manager sensed this because she was at our table several times, delivering food and taking requests. If not for her it would have been a stressful meal. I had the sweet corn soup as a starter, and was blown away. It was somehow light and rich at the same time, and was poured table side over a few fluffy pieces of popcorn. As adorable as a soup could be. The rest of the food was very good, but not great. My risotto was at the level that I could make at home, but with pricier ingredients. The dessert was quite lovely: black raspberry sorbet in raspberry consommé. It was fresh, not overly sweet, and the perfect light ending to an overall good meal.",0.9717,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.502202380952381

2010-07-09,5.0,"My wife and I eat out quite a bit and had a stretch where we explored the various fine dining establishments for their tastings.  Our experience at Custom House was top notch... and one of the best meals we've ever had.  I understand, of course, there were a few things that we experienced that may not hold true for everyone. We had called ahead (with our reservation) asking about a tasting.  We were told that they do not publish this offering, but it could be arranged.  So, off the bat, they were quite accommodating to us.  At the time, my wife was pregnant so was not drinking and they separated foods to avoid too much raw stuff (like raw butter) for her while keeping those elements in my portion.   We had a 6 course tasting (small but plenty) and I had my wines paired.  What made our experience so good was the waiter who was with us, was apparently a former chef with McClain and the gang.  He was back in town, now waiting tables temporarily to help and old friend while he was finishing his masters degree for hotel management and food service.  He was exceedingly knowledgeable about the foods and beverages we had.  He helped us pair non-alcoholic beverages for my wife as well. The food itself was very tasty and well presented.  It was meat-heavy, but we knew this coming in.  Without going into each dish, we were very impressed with the offerings and left full and satisfied.  Anyhow, I highly recommend Custom House, especially if you can call ahead to see if they can accommodate a tasting.",0.9851,0.86,0.125,0.016,0.4755944055944056

2010-05-22,3.0,"Our evening started well, but at the end, we left just unimpressed.  Custom House, maybe because of its location in South Loop is not nearly as busy as its River North counterparts, and I was able to book a reservation on OpenTable the same evening while street parking was easy across the street.   Decor I liked the decor, it was modern with a ""squarish"" theme - which I'm actually a big fan of.  I liked the couch seats, the proper white tablecloths, and decorative bar. Service The staff were very courteous and seem to take pride in their work, I saw them pressing the tablecloths, literally with an iron!  The bread guy was also very nice, offering extra bread (the multi-grain was great, the sourdough only ok), never letting my water glass go empty, and maybe being a bit too aggressive in cleaning the breadcrumbs.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and great at speaking through the menu and the dish preparation.  However, what was a real bummer was the extra long wait time for the food to arrive.  It really wasn't that busy, but whether they were understaffed or just not trained to turn tables, the lapse between dishes was very noticeable, and I actually got hungry while waiting. Food Short and sweet menu, with enough choices.  On this Friday nite, there was the option of a fixed price ""Date Night"" menu, which included a cocktail of your choosing, and a reduced menu selection of 1 appetizer, 1 entree and a dessert.  What we noticed was the heavy influence of nuts on the menu - be it almonds, cashews or whatever (take note, those with nut allergies).  Between the two of us, we had the oysters (great), duck rice (excellent, rich foie gras that adds lots of taste to the deck leg bits over paella rice), the duck breast and hanger steak.  In my opinion, the appetizers were much better and more original than the entrees.  The duck breast and its glaze and the steak and its sauce plus the mushrooms/potatoes were ok, but I felt like I'd had those flavors before more than a few years ago.  In contrast, the dessert was pretty creative.  My ""fry bread"" item with sugared fried dough, vanilla ice cream, some caramel tasted like a root beer float.  The price was very reasonable ($42 for the 3 course Date Night menu), but the main courses were frankly uninspiring and the wait was way too long on a night where it didn't seem all that busy.",0.9964,0.812,0.159,0.029,0.49123188405797114
2010-05-22,4.0,"Hiding in the Blake hotel in the South Loop, Custom House doesn't skimp on quality or service.  Though I dined there before their menu changed around the beginning of 2010, I would be very confident to head back. Despite being under-dressed compared to the other guests (I was meeting a friend at the hotel and we decided to try it for dinner rather than walk around) we were still treated impeccably, which is notable for restaurants as classy as Custom House. I keep seeing ""overpriced"" in other reviews, but I would definitely use the word ""expensive"" instead.  I am chagrined to see that my two favorite dishes (a ravioli appetizer and the amish grilled chicken) don't appear on the new menu.  Their steak was average, but the chicken was easily the best-prepared I've had in my life (no joke).  The ravioli were small and few but they were an incredible way to start the meal.   I give Custom House 4 stars because of confidence in the chef.  I'll reserve my fifth star until I return and get to experience his artistry again.",0.9493,0.863,0.113,0.025,0.6159932659932661

We decided to try Custom House last night because we were continuing to explore Chicago Magazine's list of top burgers in the city (Custom House is #4). We sat at the bar since they have the menu with the burgers.  They have an excellent selection of craft beers that aren't overpriced. The bar menu had gourmet options that you would still be comfortable eating in its bar section, but we came for one thing - the burger.  The burger was a simple cheese burger, but executed nearly to perfection in every other aspect. It was served on a soft poppy seed bun that was the same size as the burger (I hate when you have overlapping bun). The burger was nice and thick (made of steak ground onsite), juicy, seasoned simply but wonderfully. Some of the burgers I've had were a little fatty or poured TOO MUCH juice once we opened it up, but this was not the case with this burger. It came with a side of fries served on a cast iron plate to keep them warm (nice touch). My only initial complaint was the size of the burger. After reflection I realized this was probably a good thing. Sometimes if a burger or a steak is just too big then you get sick of it by the end instead of leaving you wanting to come back for more. There is nothing flashy about this burger, it is just a super high quality execution of a basic cheeseburger that makes you want to come back for another.  The bartender was very knowledgeable about the cooking, the entire bar menu, and the neighborhood. She was a pleasure to talk to and was attentive without being overbearing.

He also made sure to add that the C.H. burger will  automatically be in my Top 5 Chicago burgers. This was an incredible enticement, because normally the burger is $12. You do have to order the fries separately, but let me tell you it's all well worth the menu price! I work nearby in the South Loop, so I decided to check out the hype and go there for lunch yesterday. My lunch date met me after I'd been seated by the accommodating hostess. I requested a booth, but there's also a nice, wide bar and multiple tables available around the interior perimeter. Our booth was very comfortable and positioned almost perfectly in the middle of the dining room (the booths are  elevated compared to the rest of the seating, so you get a perfect vantage point for people watching as well). On to the food: We decided to share a burger (which comes with a tasty, house-made steak sauce) and fries, some cauliflower bisque, a beet salad with goat cheese and Brussels sprouts finished with maple syrup and bacon.  The bisque arrived first after a slight wait. The server brought out two bowls, since we were sharing everything, which was very thoughtful and then placed a few curried florets into each one. Then he topped them off with the creamy, light and very flavorful bisque itself. Delicious. Along with the soup came the beet salad, consisting of red and golden beets arranged around several little mounds of whipped goat cheese. The goat cheese was so smooth and creamy that it  almost tasted like creme fraiche! Finally, there were some sprouts on top of it all. 2-0. The servers were very attentive and made the experience even more enjoyable.  While still smacking our lips from the bisque and the salad, our burger arrived (already divided in half and plated individually with a pickle). The burger was sooo good, with melted cheese, lettuce and the aforementioned steak sauce. Onion and tomato were also provided. I had commented to my lady friend  a few times about how well seasoned the burger was! It was really good. There's no way I could eat a whole one by myself unless I had time for a nap afterward, but I would definitely enjoy the attempt. The bun was a little large for the burger, but then again the burger was nothing to scoff at. I'm a huge fan of Brussels sprouts and so is my lady friend. These one were absolutely perfect. Nicely caremelized, a little sweet from the maple syrup and smokey/salty with the bacon. The fries were crispy on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt added. The pickle was even good -not salty like a dill and not a sweet pickle, but something in between with a bit of spice. I happily ate it all! Bottom line: This was the best lunch I've had since moving to Chicago and may possibly be the best lunch I've had at any restaurant period. This lunch was so good, it even rivaled some of the more memorable dinners I've had. Come here for lunch and definitely go back for dinner...",0.9992,0.794,0.198,0.008,0.5097219530055351

2009-12-01,2.0,"...I don't really get how this place got 4 stars... Here goes... The atmosphere was nice, very modern and trendy. The tables had bench seats and it made the waiter have to come twice once from each side...I thought that was inefficient and you'd have your water but your table mates...hold on...kind of thing...weird.  Our companions ordered wine (pinot noir), and surprisingly it was one of the tastiest red wines I've had (I don't tend to like red as much as white). They also ordered the quail as an app while we went for the much mentioned oxtail and goat cheese ravs. The quail was very good, succulent and cooked just right, it tasted best with the sauce that was drizzled over the plate (balsamic I believe). The ravs for me were a great let down. The pasta was al dente and prettily folded, the goat cheese filling...it was like 1/3 filled with goat cheese...and the rest was air...the oxtail was maybe one segment of oxtail meat...i mean that's nothing...although the meat was cooked the proper amount of time. I'd much rather go home and stew up my own oxtail...for that price I can buy 2-3 trays (8-12 oxtail segments) of oxtail and ...it is so good. Anyhow it wasn't anything amazing...it is literally what it sounds like...go get some pasta sheets put a dollop of goat cheese and stick some stewed oxtail meat on there...no wow factor at all. I had high hopes for it after reading yelp...then I realized...maybe people in Chicago don't eat oxtail normally...so that's the wow for them...but for me ...nada Main course After hearing all about the pork shoulder my date got that and I got the veal cheeks. Our companions also got the wagyu sirloin steak. The pork shoulder...I don't get it. Its two tiny cannellonis with shredded pork basically. They're about 4 inches in length and yes the meat was tender...but once again no wow for me...go to a cheaper bbq store and get yourself some pork, shred it and stick it in some pasta sheets. The pork rind thing on top looked like it came out of a package and they lovingly sprinkled on paprika or whatever. My date was not impressed either. The veal cheeks were really tender, but that's about it...3 small pieces with some small diced carrots.  Wine sauce was ok. There was also a small toast with marrow on it...too salty. Both of those dishes were $28. Side were $8 a pop I believe. The wagyu sirloin ($35) looked delicious and she seemed to love it. Kinda wish I'd gone for the basic steak rather than those recommended dishes ...yelp failed me on this one. Two sides were ordered...kale I believe and polenta. The kale was nothing special...actually a bit salty. I like the one I make at home better. The polenta was like PURE butter, so rich the 4 of us couldn't finish it off and it wasn't even a huge portion. When I put a spoon on my plate, the whiff of butter smell hit me hard. Kind of amazing.  For dessert we shared a panna cotta with grapefruit sorbet. It had lil pomegranate seeds and this burnt looking mini walnut looking thing on top. The panna cotta I really liked, it was very silky. I also liked the grapefruit sorbet, it had a strong flavor. The pomegranate was all right but the lil burnt nut thing was really burnt tasting...killing all the other flavors. I avoided them so I could taste the rest of the dessert.  Anyhow, the company was nice but the food was mediocre. I strongly suspect that people reviewing don't cook, because while the meat was tender...I mean ISN'T that kind of a basic requirement...come on. If you always make your meat into shoe leather...yes this place will impress you.  Some things stood out, but overall not a place I would go back to. Oh wait... the service was really nice...no snootiness there that night. They were very welcoming.",0.9985,0.792,0.163,0.045,0.550968501984127

2009-11-10,5.0,"Custom House was one of my two favorite meals of 2008 (not to mention my second-ever Yelp review).  I was very excited to return and see if they could live up to my high expectations with a repeat performance.  Blissfully, they did. Cocktails first:  in my case, the Old Algonquin, with rye whisky, sweet vermouth, and a dash of pineapple juice, shaken and served up in a martini glass.  I liked that the pineapple was merely an accent and did not dominate the flavor of the cocktail:  this is Chicago, not Kailua-Kona, and I like to be able to taste the liquor base of the drink.   With our first courses, my date and I showed our stripes--she going for the mushroom soup and I for the beet salad.  But there were so many other delectable choices that we wanted something else to share, so we settled on the octopus--brilliant choice!  It's so easy to overcook octopus, but this was done PERFECTLY and tasted amazing, accompanied by caponata--an Italian relish with eggplant, red pepper, pine nuts, and golden raisins.  My beet salad featured a pistachio vinaigrette, a paper-thin slice of dried whole fennel, and a wonderful mozzarella-like cheese called buratta.  Excellent, excellent salad.  The mushroom soup was deep and rich.   My main was another knockout--the pork shoulder.  Our server explained that this was actually a pulled-pork treatment served in two cannelloni shells; he felt that this wasn't explained well on the menu, and we appreciated the clarification.  Great job by the chef, because the neutral pasta helped to balance and provide a canvas for all the heavy flavors of the dish--smoked eggplant puree, shitake mushrooms, and the amazing meat itself.  Every bite of this dish was bliss. I also nabbled on my date's scallops, which came over a cauliflower puree with celery root, apple straws, and a bacon vinaigrette.  Another home run.  We shared a side of the goat cheese ravioli with oxtail.  That dish was just as simple as it sounds, but very, very good.   Throughout the meal, we enjoyed fantastic service from all of the staff, not to mention the elegant and romantic ambiance of the space.  We also enjoyed observing our fellow diners, which included a pompous boyfriend lecturing his poor companion on economics, restaurants, cinema, etc; the most prim and proper woman I've ever seen, who later got her ass squeezed by her husband; an older couple from the South, the husband of which ate with gleeful gusto; and a party of eight on the raised platform, one of whom called attention to themselves with the outburst, ""He slept with my wife!"" to which the adroit wit at my left drily uttered, ""That sucks.""  Ha!  Fun times for us (but not for the cuckolded guy). To finish our meal, we ordered the s'mores dessert, which left us feeling underwhelmed.  The chocolate mousse was bland and the marshmallow altogether flavorless.  Sad face.  Again and again, I dine at these high-end restaurants that cannot seem to master a decent dessert.   Why? They have a satisfying beer list, yielding me a Lagunitas Pils with the first course, and a Goose Island Matilda with dessert and beyond.  The service was perfectly paced, and we were surprised to realize that we had spent over three hours in the restaurant, between drinks, meal, and linger time.   Except for the dessert, the food quality ranged from ""excellent"" to ""rapturous.""  Everything else was absolutely lovely.  Where does Custom House rank among my great meals of 2009?  They have some stiff competition from MK and Otom, but they are definitely in the top three.",0.9991,0.76,0.208,0.032,0.580032967032967

We made some tough decisions regarding the menu and our server was very helpful in describing dishes.  We decided to share a few first courses:  Octopus--tender, flavorful, sweet raisins, and salty pine nuts Mushroom soup--layers of rich flavor--best soup I've had in ages Beet salad-- creamy buratta cheese + earthy beets = a BIG win!  Main: Scallops--3 luscious scallops seared on both sides (I love that!), with  prosciutto and a puree of root vegetables.  They also took the time to skillfully slice green apples into a perfect julienne for garnish--always nice to see their attention to detail. Pork Shoulder-- 3 tubular cannelloni filled with rich, shredded pork shoulder.  This was paired with smokey eggplant and mushrooms.  Quite possibly the perfect fall dish. We shared a side, oxtail ravioli, and it was very filling and quite a highlight of the evening.  Actually everything, prior to dessert, was outstanding. Dessert was a total disappointment: s'mores.  My favorite dessert that can be dressed up and turned into an elegant dish or made very simple and playful.  I could see the potential.  It was deconstructed with a pile of bacon crumbs, bruleed marshmallow and a graham cracker-ish tuille cup of chocolate ______??  It wasn't mousse.  Warm pudding, maybe?  I don't know.... Good concept, poor execution.  Our server was excellent, water glasses were refilled constantly, the food was absolutely impeccable.  The restaurant was packed with well dressed couples and small groups of 6-8 so be sure to secure your reservation on Opentable.  Do NOT wait and save the Custom House for a ""special occasion""--go asap!!!  Their fall menu is pretty much flawless.",0.9973,0.727,0.235,0.038,0.6379752676264305

I wasn't nuts about the sherbet but the cake was served warm, and the curd was just tart enough to curl my toes!

2009-10-11,5.0,"I went here for dinner on Friday night with a friend. We were going to see a show at the Chicago Theater and decided to dine at Custom House  to take advantage of their pre-fix theater dinner menu which is offered for reservations at 5 or 5:30 PM. We arrived at 5:30 - the place was not busy at all - there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant....of course our service was top notch.  For 46 dollars you get a three course dinner with one side. I am presently dieting (ugh) so I tried to be relatively good. So, I ordered mixed greens for my first course, skirt steak with a side of baby carrots for my main course and ended with the cinnamon donuts (uhh yea...we'll get to those babies in a minute). My fellow diner ordered the procuitto & mozzarella app, skirt steak with a side of gnocci and the chocolate cake for dessert.  I started my meal off with a little cocktail - vokda tonic. CH makes their own tonic which was a nice little treat. The mixed greens were good...but you know...they are mixed greens. Microgreens, pumpkin seeds and I believe granny smith apples tossed in a light vinaigrette. It was good but the old me would have ordered something else. We both enjoyed the skirt steak. I ordered mine med. rare while my friend ordered hers med....both were cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. The portion was also huge. The baby carrots are...well baby carrots (damn diet). They were tasty and cooked with shallots and served with a honey/citrus sauce. We thought they could have been cooked a touch longer but my friend and I still still enjoyed & ate them. I tried some of my friend's potato gnocci and it was fantastic....so good that I went back for a bit of seconds...I just could not help myself.  Dessert was also fantastic (at least on my end). I had cinnamon glazed donut holes (3) served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream that had an espresso sauce served over top. The sauce was a bit strong but was a nice contrast with the ice cream. The donut holes were perfection...how can you go wrong with warm fresh donuts with a warm cinnamon glazes? *drools*  My friend did not enjoy her dessert so much. She thought it was too sweet. I tasted it and didn't think it was so sweet that it was inedible...but then again this was the first time I'd eaten any sort of real dessert in two weeks. It was a slice of chocolate cake with a coconut cream layer, dark chocolate smear, whip cream & macadamia nuts.  Our total bill was 120 (minus tip). I thought this was a steal for the service & food we received. I would definitly take advantage of the theater menu when seeing another show. The 15 minute walk over to the Chicago Theater was just what we needed after that filling meal. I had mulled over going to Trattoria Ten since it was closer to the theater but was glad we chose CH.

2009-08-25,4.0,"This was the second restaurant I have tried since I was put on a massive salt restriction that has basically left me unable to dine out.  I used to eat at Chef McClain's Spring every Friday; his cuisine has always been heavenly to my palate.  Custom House is his downtown steak joint: in the lobby of a hotel in the South Loop, it is clearly aimed at the modern business lunch/cocktail/dinner crowd.  Not quite as pricey as some of the other steakhouses of its ilk, it also is approachable for people who just want a solid, notch-up meal in a bright, modern setting - this is not your old mahogany and thick leather impregnated with 50 years of cigar smoke kind of place. So we called in advance to ensure they could work with us, and after being mollified that there was a good chance I could say ""no salt"" and get it, we showed up just slightly before they were open.  They were very courteous about holding doors for me, letting us in early, and giving me space to recover from the three front steps I had to traverse.  We sat at a table just past the bar (they have a few that aren't in the little ""three steps down"" recess that dominates the dining floor) as the first patrons of the day. We ordered a shared appetizer and two entrees; I had the skirt steak.  They modified the appetizer and steak to both be sodium-free preparations; the chef threw together a light four-vegetable side with lemon beurre blanc (from unsalted butter) for me and left of the two salty parts of the steak prep, which was also not drenched in any salty marinade or pre-cooking sauce.  All the food had a very fresh, robust flavor and it was blissful to enjoy someone else cooking for me - and well - for one of the first times in over 3 months.  I snuck a tiny taste of the chilled mushroom soup (which was salted) and it was fabulous - a chanterelle-tasting soup that had lots of lemon and lightness that made it a perfect light summer soup (which one does not think of when you say ""mushroom soup"").  I also stole a tine dip of my companion's sauce and it was pleasantly balanced with some complexities that integrated. Is this as good as Spring?  Nowhere close.  Is this a great steak joint with some refinement, civility, and a chance to get significantly above average fare?  Absolutely; I'd heartily recommend this to anybody in a heartbeat.  They do have some vegetarian offerings and the kitchen will obviously work with you if there is an issue (this is one of McClain's strong points at all his restaurants), so you can have a mixed group and they'll all be okay.  (If it's a group of power vegans solely, then I'd probably recommend McClain's Green Zebra instead, however.)",0.9965,0.84,0.151,0.009,0.49444444444444446

2009-04-19,4.0,"The Custom House Breakdown:  Decor/Ambiance: 4  Service: 5  Food: 3.5  Wine: 4  Music: 1  --------------------------------  Total: 3.5 stars (in this case I rounded up)  The Details:  1. Decor/Ambiance: Eh... what can I say? The space was much smaller than I had envisioned it would be and incredibly understated... it's an open room with tables along the sides and an elevated cluster of booths in the middle. With just a few touches of modern floral aesthetic, it's incredibly minimalist. Really minimalist. Between the floor-to-ceiling glass and muted tones of beige and grey, it's totally unfussy, perhaps even slightly boring... of the 3 McClain spaces (he also owns Green Zebra & Spring), it's certainly the least dramatic.  2. Service: Fabulous!! I felt very pampered and well taken care of all evening. Between the managers attentiveness, our bussers sense of urgency and our servers familiarity and bubbliness, it was a trifecta in formality, function and friendliness. The CH staff sets a high bar in accommodation.  3. Food: Hmm. Where to begin? As a median, it was ok. Definitely not the consistent level of expertise and perfection I've come to expect from master Chef Shawn. There are high notes and low notes throughout the menu, which is unfortunate... everything sounds positively exquisite, and a few things actually are...  The quail breast and confit appetizer was downright mouthwatering. Tasty, moist crispy morsels of delicate quail atop yummy squash accents... I love the blend of salty/savory with succulent/sweet, this is a must have! The entree of braised short rib with horseradish creampuffs was also nothing short of magnificent. Served in its own cast iron individual-size pot, tender beef simmering away in its own tangy, rich juices... dip your little snappy, spicy puff in and sop it all up for an earth shattering good time.  My entree of loup de mer was sadly not quite as mind blowing. I wasn't bowled over by the fish itself (a bit slimy, honestly) or its chewy trumpet mushroom accompaniments. My loup was tasty, but cooked with the scale side up, was not nearly as crisped as it needed to be to facilitate eating that skin. Glutinous is not a word I enjoy associating with my fish, thanks. The waygu tartare with fried egg also left a bit to be desired... a bit mushy and quite frankly, bland, it left my hankering for raw, red meat totally unsated. At least the egg was good!  A side of eggplant gratin rounded out the meal. Also served en cast iron pot, it was bubbly hot, cheesy and luscious... also a tad on the squishy side, but totally flavorful. I passed on our servers suggestion of the ricotta and ragu ravioli side and regretted not taking her up on it... how can you fu*k up meat sauce and pasta? I bet this side is the way to go. 4. Wine: We'll keep this brief. The CH Offerings are robust and quite well rounded. We opted for the Cote du Rhone by the glass and were pleasantly surprised by it's nice heavy pour. Score!  5. Music: Downright horrible. Almost embarrassing. Shitteous smooth jazz. At one point I even heard a muzak-esque version of The Eagles. This is music even my Dad wouldn't be down with. Fix this Custom House, seriously, you're food can be mature and sophisticated without your tunes eking out their last breath on life support.  A nice experience overall, but one I won't necessarily be rushing back for... my taste for contemporary American cuisine does find the likes of Province, Table Fifty-Two, Otom and NaHa a bit more well executed.",0.9942,0.84,0.125,0.035,0.5363683692850358

2009-03-16,3.0,"3.5 for the food, but 4 for the service, decor, and drinks. I came on a Saturday night around 9pm. There were still a decent number of diners at the time. The Food:  + duck confit salad: This was probably my favorite of everything we had. I loved the texture and the flavor. I always appreciate a well constructed salad.  + flat iron steak: This was perfectly cooked and tasty. + roasted brussel sprouts: These were delicious. The homemade bacon was wonderful.  + chocolate mousse cake: Great presentation and delish. - mushroom risotto: A bit too al dente for me. It probably needed about 8-10 more minutes of stirring, but the flavor was excellent. - duck prosciutto: Great presentation but wasn't that wowed. - roasted sweetbreads: This was my least favorite. I think I prefer sweetbreads to be crispier. They were on a bed of polenta, which is also soft, so the squishy sweetbreads on top made it all kind of mushy and gross. Overall:  I really liked the decor. It was simple and modern, but in a cozy and calming way, not sterile and severe. Our waitress was very attentive. It's definitely worth a visit. We had 1 4 course tasting menu, 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 1 side, and 1 drink = $110 total for two.",0.9968,0.678,0.29,0.032,0.631952380952381
2009-03-08,4.0,"We're big fans of Spring so decided to try their little sister for my husband's bday celebration this weekend.  I had mentioned when making the reservation that it was husband's bday and they did a great job of making a big fuss...a nice happy bday greeting when we walked in the door, they even printed ""happy bday"" on his menu, and they brought out some complimentary truffles at the end with a candle in it.  He's not a big bday person so he seemed a bit embarrassed by all the attention, but I'm a huge bday person (no matter whose bday it is) so I loved it!  The service was spot on and our waiter did a nice job of helping us decide from all the delicious sounding choices on the menu... Drinks: Reisling for me Some sort of whisky drink for my husband The reisling was nice and sweet, which was what I was in the mood for.  The whisky- quite strong! After 1 sip my husband said ""well that will make a man out of you!"" Appetizer:  Baby Octopus Salad for me Beef tartare served with potato chips and a huge white anchovy for my husband Both= excellent! I'd definitely order the octopus salad again! Entree: Scallops for me Veal Cheeks for my husband The 3 medium sized scallops on my plate were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The veal cheeks came highly recommended by our waiter and my husband seemed to be a fan proclaiming that it tasted just like his grandmother's brisket, which is a compliment. Sides: Brussel sprouts  Pommes Anna potatoes The brussel spouts had bacon in them and I decided I would have eaten way more of these as a kid if they were cooked this way.  And the potatoes tasted just like hashbrowns, but even better...if that's possible. Both very nice choices! Dessert: Banana Caramel Cake 1 scoop of salted caramel ice cream Complimentary truffles for the bday boy By far the best part of the meal.  I'm craving the cake just writing about it now and can't ever go wrong with salted caramel ice cream. YUM! The truffles were a little rich for even a chocoholic like myself, but can't complain about those since they were complimentary. While the portions aren't very large, we still left in quite a food coma.  We didn't find Custom House to be quite as good as Spring, but it was still VERY good.  And definitely a good spot for a celebration...",0.9992,0.722,0.275,0.004,0.6279072681704262
2009-03-01,4.0,"Thanks to Janet E, I managed to savor Custom House's $5 burger on final day of it's month long January Promo. Custom House is worth a visit even without a catchy $5 burger. This review is for lunch only. THE REVIEW Custom House is an upscale restaurant located just minutes walking distance away from the heart of The Loop in Printer's Row. The area vaguely reminds me of Varick St in NYC's Tribeca.  The decor is modern. The atmosphere is definitely serious in tone. So be sure to dress appropriately: business casual. The dining room is filled with spacious window views overlooking the street. There are a cluster of booths slightly elevated from the tables along the windows---defintely a comfortable setting for a date. I ordered the $5 bacon cheddar burger (normally $14). I spent the difference on a very nice glass of wine. A quick glance of the menu certainly intrigued me enough to want to try Custom House for dinner.  Three words: Braised Veal Cheeks.  The prices are expensive, but manageable. Lunch prices range between $14-$19 while dinner prices range between $24-$38. Is it worth it? The $5 burger def was worth every penny. The buns look like they're freshly baked on premise. The fries come in a metal pot. The portions are perfect for lunch: not too big or too small. The food is beautifully presented. Yes, it can seem too precious at times. It tastes good. That's all that really matters. And t\he burger did taste good.  The server was polite and attentive. There were a handful of other tables dining for lunch. I do think this is a terrible restaurant to dine in when there are few tables. The open dining room and minimalist decor can make you feel like everyone is staring at you.  I will come back and try dinner. Custom House is definitely a solid restaurant choice for a date or special dinner.",0.9947,0.802,0.183,0.015,0.5335063085063085

OVERALL SUMMARY: Food: 6.5/10 Wine Selection: 8.5/10 Price: 6/10 Service: 8/10 Environment: 8/10 Recommended to try: no Portion was small given the price. With tax and tips, the bill was around $150. Can get more value and quality else where in Chicago.  APPETIZERS  1: Quail Squash Beignet/Confit Quail: 9.5/10 One of the best quail dishes I've had in a long time. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sauce, which had a balsamic based, was outstanding with the quail.   Recommended: yes MAIN 2) Bone in Short Ribs with Puree of Yukon Gold sidedish: 7/10 This is a solid dish by no means, but I can probably make the same dish at home. It wasn't anything spectacular, but for $35 (with the potato side dish), it wasn't worth the price, not the mention the portion was small. Recommended: no 3) Veal Cheeks Bone Marrow Toast Tomato Preserves: 6.5/10 The veal cheeks were nicely prepared. However, the bone marrow toast was below par. The bone marrow didn't taste fresh and it wasn't rich at all. I was expecting the traditional French presentation with the roasted bone and you spread the marrow on yourself. Portion was again on the small side. Recommended: no DESSERT 4) Had the sample dish for dessert. It was decent overall, but again nothing to brag about.

2009-02-06,4.0,"Clearly, when a fancy restaurant charges only $5 for their fancy burger that's usually $14, it is a transparent attempt to lure people in with prices they'll never, ever see again, part of a quasi evil attempt to get you so hooked on said burgers that you will then come back in and buy them at full price from now on.  So I went into this with full knowledge. After all, how often do you get a chance to pre-judge a more expensive restaurant for only the cost of a ""five dolla... five dolla... five dolla foot loooong""? Because if you can't even get a burger right? Stay the hell away from my steak then, yo.  This burger was really delicious. The toasted bun is amazing, almost tasted like challah - great bread. The waiter told us that Custom House grinds their hamburger meat every day, so their may be some pork, steak, might be different each time. I thought it had almost a sausage quality and was very juicy. Asking for it well done came back with a slight pink in the middle - it was perfect. I imagine asking for it rare will win you a $5 version of the steak tartare on their dinner menu... The fries - fantastic, really. They have an amazing similarity to Hot Doug's duck fat fries, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if they aren't vegan. Ahhh, but the rub? The usual $14 burger includes bacon - the special didn't. Figures, because I kept thinking ""This burger needs some bacon.""  Service was good.  Also everything was very nice and pretty inside and the food looks beautiful on the plate.  Lunch for four came to only $40 - including tax and tip! Don't expect anything like that if you go though - our soft drinks were almost the same cost as our discounted burgers! Ha! So did their lure work on me? It was pretty good and I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again if I was in the area, but I'm kind of married to the $14 burger at Hot Chocolate. I'm kind of a ho though, so future cheating should always be expected.  Either here or somewhere else - I kind of get around like that.",0.9937,0.801,0.165,0.034,0.6164596273291926

2009-01-19,3.0,"I'd say that of the three Spring Restaurant Group restaurants, I'd have to list Custom House as the 3rd.  Not that it's a poor showing, but the competition is stiff and Custom House just doesn't have the same verve as Spring & Green Zebra.  Perhaps its the location-- 500 S. Dearborn just doesn't have that neighborhood feeling as Uke Village or Wicker Park.  Combine that with its hotel adjacency and you rather get that corporate downtown restaurant vibe. The food, however is quite good and the menu, with its local products and flavors makes narrowing your choices difficult.  I began with a house cocktail,  the delicious Pear Shrub-- champagne, fresh pear and pear shrub (a sweet, tart concentrated syrup that dates back to colonial times).  Josh had a Lagunitas.  We did try to undermine fancy restaurant convention by requesting oysters before putting in our dinner order, but the waiter said it wouldn't be a problem since it was a fairly slow evening and oysters are oysters.  Our plan failed though-- either the waiter forgot to put in that order or the chef decided to spite us-- as our first courses appeared before the oysters.  The waiter was awfully apologetic, but it hardly mattered to us-- I'll eat oysters for dessert. So, 1st course-- sweetbreads with soft polenta in a cute Staub roasting dish and the white anchovies with capers and oven-dried tomato.  Both were lovely and the anchovies reminded me of boquerones, but smaller and more delicate (and more plentiful than a tapas serving). Oysters, 3 Long Cove and 3 Kumamoto were served on a bed of rock salt garnished with juniper berries and red peppercorns and accompanied by house cocktail sauce and a fennel relish that reminded us of unseasoned ratatouille.   Main course:  Duck breast with beet tartare for Josh and rabbit two-ways for me-- there was the rabbit loin wrapped in house-made bacon (sliced, it looked like sausage) with braised rabbit leg topped with shaved fennel.  I couldn't taste the fennel much, but the rabbit leg was so fantastic I could have eaten it all day.  The waiter told us that the main courses were served with ""seasonal accompaniments""-- a euphemism for ""without vegetables"".  The beet tartare was a scant tablespoon of color on the duck plate and the shaved fennel was garnish.  We split a side dish of the wonderful baby turnips with sunchoke puree, but rather wish we had gone for a green vegetables (they were out of Brussels sprouts) or had had a salad starter.  The sunchoke puree was put on bread and enjoyed as a dip for both the duck and the rabbit.  The turnips were tasty and tender but several were rather blackened on a side and suffered in flavor for it.  We paired the course with an Utiel-Requena. Although I read great things about Custom House's coffee and enjoyed seeing the shiny French Presses go to tables near us, we took a pass on coffee and dessert and went for the cheese plate paired with the loveliest apple ice wine from Quebec.  The cheese (a goats milk with ash, a blue and an almost pecorino-ish cow's milk cheese) were served with fruit & nut crisps, macerated figs, a spicy mango chutney and the most amazing honey I've had in awhile.   Now, the bathroom review (very important)-- it's a hotel bathroom.  You actually have to leave the restaurant, pass through the entry (chilly in January...) and use the restrooms in the hotel.  Not a far walk, but you feel odd walking by the host stand and out of the restaurant.   The host was very nice and pleasant, the GM said hi and welcomed us while we waited at the stand and the waiter was competent if not over-apologetic.  We did pour our own wine a couple times, but made sure he wasn't looking when we did.  I've been scolded for this before... All in all, a very good meal, but I'm much more likely to revisit Spring and Green Zebra before returning.",0.9974,0.833,0.131,0.035,0.523888888888889

The food: course 1:  smoked trout with green beans in herb dressing.  Light and flavorful, the beans were so fresh and crisp and the trout was a small portion of flaked smoked fish.  Delicious. course 2: wagyu carpaccio!!!!!  The chef adorned the carpaccio with micro greens, capers and a  few other flavor drops of 2 different sauces.  I'm still not sure what the crispy stuff was sprinkled on top, but it made for an escellent textural experience. course 3:  wagyu NY strip with bone marrow and bone-in prime filet with tomatoe jelle.   We are steak people and I must say that the chef prepared these steaks perfectly!!!!  I couldn't have asked for more. Course 4:  Nichol's strawberry crape cake with roasted pistachios and a dollap of vanilla ice cream. Every course was executed with perfection and the flavors were bright and well matched.

Dessert was great, though.  I had the frozen lemon custard, served with white chocolate beignets.  The custard was very good, but the beignets?  Out of this world.  The only downside to this was the jasmine mint whipped cream, which my boyfriend described as medicinal.  He had the ice cream cola float, which was also incredible.  Wattleseed ice cream?  Awesome.  And the black and white cookies served with it were also wonderful.

My friend and I waited at the bar, ordering drinks to pass the time.  Mistake.  Do not, under any circumstances, order the ""Custom House"" cocktail.  The ginger is so overpowering - I felt like I was drinking chilled ginger tea.  Ew.  That was a rather disappointing way to start the evening. Thankfully, it went uphill from there.  Our hostess seated us immediately.  And I silently oohed and aahed over the ambience.  Like its sister restaurants, Custom House is composed of warm lighting, clean lines, wooden accents, and muted colors for a very comfortable ambience.  It's also spacious, but not as much as Spring, so there is a bit of a cozy element. We ordered oysters to start off the meal.  And they were so fresh, cold, and yummy.  Yes, I love oysters.  And Custom House serves two wonderful varieties.  My friend ordered the scallops and I had the wagyu medium rare with fingerling potatoes on the side.  Like Spring, the scallops were meltingly tender and perfectly cooked.  As for my wagyu, it was...wonderful.  It was perfectly seared to medium rare; the knife just grazed through with little effort.  There was no need to add any sauces because the meat spoke for itself; it was tender, with a robust, gamey flavor.  And the fingerlings went perfectly with it.  Yes, a very sophisticated take on steak and potatoes. For dessert, I opted for carrot cake while my friend had the rhubarb cheesecake.  It was so good, we both polished off our plates.  We ended the meal with a nice cup of organic brazilian coffee.  The meal came up to $140 for two.",0.9979,0.746,0.236,0.018,0.6870833333333334

Between the 10 of us, I'm pretty sure we ordered everything off the lunch menu.  They have the $20.08 (aka 2008) 3 course lunch menu, which I took advantage of.  Unfortunately, the menu isn't currently on the website, but they offer two choices of an appetizer, entree, dessert.  For the appetizer, there was the pear ajou salad with parmesan gelato - yum!, or a duck dish.  I had the former, and loved the salad!  The entree selections included maine scallops with pancetta, or a rabbit dish.  I just couldn't get myself to order the rabbit, so I opted for the scallops.. It came in a trio, and was so delicious - prepared very well, crispy/seared on the outside and buttery on the inside - quality-wise, it wasn't too meaty (I don't like meaty scallops).  For the dessert, there was a choice between the chocolate pave and an apple/cheddar/pastry puff dish.  I ordered the apple dish, since the table had ordered 2 chocolate paves, and I thought it was interesting, but I wouldn't order it again.  It was worth trying, but will not do much for your sweet tooth.  Other noteworty dishes that were ordered were the flatiron steak (looked delish), the winter squash soup (which featured butternut for the winter), veal cheeks (interesting!), and of course, the custom house burger with duck fat fries. Another thing I loved about this place was that their dessert menu -- which was quite extensive and inventive: they offer a candy bar of the day, and assorted cookies of the day.  The candy bar was called monkey something (how could we not order that), and the cookies came in a trio (chocolate, an apricot one, and I'm blanking on the 3rd).   The presentation of all the dishes were excellent, and the decor was nice.  I would want to come back for dinner when it's a little more lively, coupled with libations, which we didn't take advantage of during our work lunch ;).

These lovely little thymus glands were served with the house cured bacon. Absolutely perfect. Followed it with the short rib with horseradish cream puffs. The short rib was so rich and buttery that I initially thought that it was infused with goat cheese. It wasn't and it probably wasn't remotely healthy. Finally, my wife and I split the lemon rosemary sorbet and the table shared the carmel corn. The sorbet was one of the most interesting desserts that I have every had. The caramel corn was one of the most playful. The caramel corn was a top choice. It was a perfect finish to a great meal.",0.9865,0.757,0.228,0.015,0.6029411764705882
2007-11-15,4.0,"We went here for a work celebration dinner, and it was excellent, from soup to nuts.  In fact, I think I was sated for about two days afterwards. First of all, I knew I was in for a treat when for our aperitif I asked for a Tanquerray and Tonic, and they didn't carry Tanquerray, and then the waitress told me they made their own tonic water.  When the tonic came, it was a little cloudy, and I wondered if it was direct from the lake, but then I tasted it and it was really good.  Definitely made the gin taste a little smoother. I had the beet and goat cheese salad for a starter, and it was excellent.  One of Alyssa's Laws is that if there is goat cheese on the menu, I must order it.  But sometimes a beet/goat cheese mix can get too tangy (an example is Lula's bruschetta) but this was perfect.  I ate every bite and if my boss hadn't been there I may have licked the plate. For my entree, I had the duck confit, and again it was very good.  Tender, and with just enough fat to cut around.  I had a side of mashed potatoes.  They brought ""share"" plates, but since I was with work people, I thought that would be weird, no?  My co-worker had the skirt steak, and from the way conversation dimmed on his side of the table, I think he liked it too. For dessert, I had a pineapple/maple cake-thingy with marscapone custard, and it was super.  I kind of wish I had gotten the ice cream, though, since the selection for that night was pumpkin, butterscotch and chocolate, and my boss got it and he looked delighted. The service was excellent.  The decor is fantastic, it looks vaguely LA - ish but not out of place in Chicago, like other restaurants that try to hard.  I didn't have a chance to check out the whole wine list, but the bottle chosen for us was very, very good.  It was a Pinot from Walla Walla (which is never not fun to say).

2007-06-14,5.0,"So day Two started downtown with lunch at The Custom House.  Aydin, myself, and my step-dad all met at this absolute gem of a restaurant.  Aydin and I left and his first words were...""it was one of the best choreographed lunches I've had in a long time!""  Perfect words for a perfect lunch.   While A and I were waiting for Norm, we were asked the now commonplace...still or sparkling.  We went with sparkling and it turned out to be some artisian water from GB.  A claims its all in the bubbles (esp with Champagne) and gave this water a thumbs up.  Hence...go for the gold and get the sparkling.  I wish I would have kept a list of the wines I drank, because their site is not updated, but I will refer to the varietal and it is easily copied (because they only offer one per type by the glass). I started with a WA Riesling and A went with the Sauvignon Blanc.  To pair with this we ordered the White Anchovies with a Tomato Relish, garnished with slivered radishes, microgreens, and capers.  AMAZING!  The essence of spring; a completely clean taste.  A and I quickly devoured it with the one piece of grilled bread that came with the plate and finished it with the house bread (nothing to write home about).   Norm finally made it and we proceeded to start chatting and failed to look at the menu.  I thought this was a good aside to this review, because the booths are super comfortable and encourage looong lunches.  The dining room is quite open, but does not have the open kitchen element, which I appreciate here.  The exposed wine walls were a nice addition and I could see having a great dinner here (although it is right off Congress Pkway...not exactly gorg views).   Norm ordered a Pinot Noir and I went with a Syrah.  Both awesome again.  I got the Bibb salad and the Scallops, N ordered the same and Aydin went with the Mizuna salad and the Quail.  My salad came with a hot piece of rustic fry bread and dressed Bibb lettuce greens in a Broken Caesar dressing with large pieces of Parmegano Reggiano.  It was light and crisp and I inhaled my fry bread.  A's salad was perfect for him.  The greens were spicy and bitter and the dressing had a great citrus kick.   Now for the meal...The Quail was INCREDIBLE!  It was seriously perfectly roasted and tender and juicy.  I wanted to steal more off his plate.  My scallops were served over a sunchoke puree with fresh peas.  It was great and super light.  So light that I justified coffee and dessert. This place serves Intelligentsia French press and A being a Seattleite understands my snobbery.  We shared the Los Immortales and the Doughnuts.  The Doughnut dessert came with homemade strawberry ice cream and strawberry jam.  A is not a dessert guy and he loved it!  He kept making sure his returns to the dessert bowl were not met with disappointment on my part, but I am not a strawberry ice cream girl and we have a huge dinner ahead of us (Fogo de Chao) so I was happy to share.  The coffee was wonderful and A admitted that it was on par with Seattle standards.  N's cappuccino was beautiful and if we didn't have an engagement at 2 I could have sat there a lot longer.   So next time I go I am heading there for dinner and I am going to start with one of their libations and eat to my hearts content.  The meals here are quite small (which I appreciate) but I want to put out that warning.  This is a multi-course lunch place and not ideal for a one entre order.  Love it, love it, love it!  BTW: as we walked out I looked into the kitchen and it was spotless...reminds me of the stories I have heard about Keller's FL and his maniacal cleanliness.  I'm all about it if kitchens can turn out magic.",0.9992,0.743,0.21,0.047,0.6431329028786654

But alas, it is not the meat-eater's haven you might  think.  Then menu is pretty varied and could feed pretty much anyone, vegetarians aside. The boyfriend and I went to Custom House for lunch as part of our pre-Valentine's Day Valentine's Day.  We arrived at around 1:15 on Friday, and the place was empty. I'm assuming they draw a decent dinner crowd; otherwise I don't know how they stay open. The hostess was very friendly, the atmosphere, while a bit 'power lunch'-y, was clean and modern, in typical McClain fashion. The waiter came over and explained the specials as well as some changes to the menu, and answered a couple of questions that we had, very friendly and un-pretentious.  And now for the food: we started with an appetizer of tuna tartare, which was good, if nothing special.  I had a beet salad with mascarpone and frisee, the boyfriend had a wonderfuly creamy fennel soup with Tasso ham. For the mains, he had the fish special, which was Grouper served with a tomato fume and potatoes. I am not a fish eater, and I could have eaten the entire dish, which was light and smokey and delicious.  I had the ricotta and caraway tortelloni, which was served with carmalized onions, cherries, and braised pork belly.  The boyfriend picked out all of the belly, though it did impart a nice smokey flavor to the dish which I quite enjoyed.  The pasta could have been a bit more delicate, but flavor-wise it was amazing. Dessert was okay, nothing to write home about though.  We shared the baklava, which was flaky and not too sweet- typically the downfall of the pastry.  The meyer lemon ice cream was rich and creamy, though a bit too bitter ( I think it was actually made with marmalade), and I could have done without the candied fennel salad on the side. Personally I like my desserts to be desserts, and to leave the veg with the mains. The waiter had explained that the desserts were called 'Sweet Bites' because they were so small; however they seemed to be the same size as any other fine dining desserts- yet at a smaller price.   All in all, the food was delicious, the service was great, the atmosphere is classy without being pretentious.  While it is a bit pricey for lunch, it's definitely worth a trip for a special occasion.

I had the NY strip steak for dinner, which our server claimed was voted the best in Chicago, and while it was good, I asked for medium rare and it was most definitely not. When ordering I explained to our server that I don't eat red meat very often and I wasn't sure how it should be cooked. After he told me that the restaurant's medium rare had a warm pink center, that is what I choose, but when my steak came out it was red not pink, and definitely lookd a little bloody. I suppose I could have sent it back, but I am always hesitant to do that, particularly when eating with three other people who have already received their entrees. In any case, I might recommend ordering your steak cooked a little more than normal. Aside from that I enjoyed the experience.
