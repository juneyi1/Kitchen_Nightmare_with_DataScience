Amazing; had the kitchen table for Valentines.  It was the most perfect night.  Loved to be able to people watch legally.  Smoothly run kitchen; clean beyond clean.  Quietly efficient.  Food was beautifully presented; definitely a memorable, magical night.  Thank you Chef Trotter and Chef Carlson.  Chef Trotter was quite amusing to watch.  Sad to see the restaurant close down after 25 amazing years.  Way to go and enjoy your next journey.  I am proud to say I've been to Charlie Trotters.",0.992,0.606,0.37,0.024,0.6862373737373738

The wine selection was also fantastic.  Furthermore, the staff that worked here were kind, expedient, and professional.  This was the best establishment I ever had the privilege of dining at.  It saddens me that I will never again have the opportunity to dine here under Chef Trotter's guidance.  However, I am glad to hear of his family's recent announcement to maintain their ownership of this site and turn it into a non-profit business focused on benefiting the culinary world.",0.9678,0.757,0.191,0.052,0.5208333333333333

2013-07-21,5.0,"I was fortunate enough to come here before the restaurant closed its doors after 25 years in Chicago.  The restaurant itself is very hard to miss, as there isn't a huge sign or blazing lights or anything in the front - only a brownstone building with some beautiful ivy all around.  Our courses included: Faroe Island Salmon with Roasted Salsify, Preserved Shallot, and Kumamoto Oyster; Big Eye Tuna with Green Tomato Juice, Kalamata Olives, and Avocado Sorbet; Citrus Streamed Line Caught Cod with Braised Beef Cheek, Cumin Scented Apple Chutney, and Saskatchewan Chanterelle Mushroom; Muscovy Duck with Smoked Coconut, Spring Onion, and Venezuelan Chocolate; Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Shank with Curried Sunchoke and New Zealand Spinach; Raspberry Sorbet with Lemon Verbena Cream and Chambord Curd Tart; Brown Butter Corn Bread with Michigan Cherries and Corn Gelato; and, Triple Criollo Riviera Cake with Lemon Balm Puree and Strawberry.  Chef Trotter himself scared the daylights out of me (I actually screamed) when he came over to our table to say greetings and said that after dinner, he would be more than happy to give us a private tour of the kitchen - HOLY COW!  After a pleasant meal, we had a tour of the kitchen, saw the different stations, saw the chefs delicately plating several dishes, took a picture of Chef Trotter himself, and saw the studio kitchen where Trotter films his shows.  The whole experience was amazing, and it was sad to see one of Chicago's institutions come to a close.  Maybe one day, Chef Trotter will come back?!  There was limited street parking on Armitage, and I was lucky to find a free spot. +chef's tasting +kitchen tour +pictures with the Chef !!! +owned by Chef Trotter",0.9614,0.857,0.099,0.044,0.5555090742590743

2012-09-06,3.0,"I have lived in Chicago for almost 10 years and have heard that Charlie Trotter's was THE restaurant in Chicago for fine cuisine.  So, when I heard that Trotter's was closing, I had to go.  I went with a friend and my sister on the third to last night they were open, 8/29/12.  Sorry Charlie, but my meal was only ""adequate"", ""OK"",  or ""acceptable"".  I was going to give it only two stars but I felt gulty because of the staff who were losing their jobs and the fact that they were probably not at the top of their game.  Reasons I am giving only three stores: 1) Way too expensive!  $195/person for 8-course fixed price and another $125/person for wine pairings.  2) We were seated upstairs where it was uncomfortably hot.  One of the servers toild us that the A/C was broken earlier in the day, but it felt like it was still broken. 3) The decor was very 1980's (and not in a cool way).  Yuk! 4) Out of the 8 courses, two were good and the rest were edible at best 5) Our entire meal took 3.5 hours.  Things could have moved much faster. I will still buy Charlie Trotter's lox at Whole Foods.  Now, that food deserves 5 stars! Good luck to Charlie and his entire staff.  Maybe you will reinvent yourself someday and I will give you another try, but only if I can order a la carte!

2012-08-30,5.0,"Oh Katie V, If I could kick you in the crotch, I would.  What a terrible review you put up, and how desperate you seem to be negative!  If you prefer a place like Alinea to Trotter's, then go to Alinea.  It seems that your entire reason for coming to Trotter's near the end was to ""say that you've been there.""  And to judge it so harshly, on standards of your day and age is highly unfair.  You walked in negative.  And so you had a bad experience.  It's as simple as that. I am writing this review of my experience at Charlie Trotter's years after it happened.  And because the experience was so profound, I can tell you by sense memory what happened to me when I was there.  I wasn't drinking at the time, so I didn't have my food palate dulled by the ferment of wine, and I didn't get heady with all of the words of the servers.  I will admit I was a bit spoiled - I dined in the studio kitchen and the chefs that brought out our food were not servers.  The servers were silent.  There were about 14 of us.  At each course, the chefs for each segment came out and told us what we were eating.  We were served tiny ciabatta rolls, hand-made that day.  You can TELL the difference between ciabatta that is sourced and ciabatta that is made by hand.  The butter was hand-scooped into small and delicate ramekins. I never thought I would eat veal brain, but that night, I did.  Fried and lightly breaded.  I had freshly flown-in small, delicate japanese oysters.  One of my co-chefs actually found a pearl in hers!  (But she got so dippy on the wine she dropped it and it slipped somehow between the floorboards).  We had popcorn crab - tiny crabs, the size of a nickel to a quarter, cooked in butter like popcorn.  It was incredible.  Loin of venison.  Course after course came through, explosions of flavor on our tongues, in small portions that built and built on eachother to make us all orgiastically, finally, happily full!...  Then, a dessert from Chef Della that involved a Bodhisattva's hand.  And a few chocolate truffles that - tasting one after another each - were like being hosted in another world.  I felt my body separate from my spirit more than once during the experience.   Around the table, we all got to know eachother better than we'd ever been able to as co-workers.   Yes, Katie V.  You insult me, and you insult the entire staff of Charlie Trotter's - and every single person that ever sweated from the individual random elements of 1) washing a dish to step 36) prepping your vegs for just one component of the 5th course to 57) clearing your finite plate.  I'm being conservative with the numbers here. Chef Trotter did something amazing for the world.  He created an environment that focused solely on service to the point of incredible detail.  He envisioned a place that lived and breathed on the lips and hearts of his diners, critics, chefs, students, and the lowly classes of kids he bussed in from under-represented school districts to inspire people that would not otherwise understand or even be able to cultivate a passion - for something ethereal.   What he did for the culinary world is astounding.  What he meant to do for his guests he mostly accomplished.   Except for reviewers like you, Katie V.  He let you into paradise, and you took a big steaming crap in the middle of Eden.",0.9913,0.838,0.111,0.051,0.5346068660022149
2012-08-29,5.0,"I spent a good amount of my early young life watching PBS as my parents don't believe in cable. Hell they still dont. Instead of MTV, I had the ""Box"". I lived on Sesame Street, Mr Rogers, Electric Company. As I got older I would get my early culinary television in Jacques Pepin, Julia Child, Lidia Bastianich, Rick Bayless, and Charlie Trotter. For years I watched not knowing what the food tasted like. In fact it is not until present day that I'm now trying the cooking of the aforementioned chefs.  It took Charlie Trotter announcing that he was closing to force my hand to head out and visit the restaurant. To dine on the eve of the 25th anniversary was the goal and to finally try the cuisine of the chef I used to watch on TV. If you start at the Loop and you're in a taxi, it is hell to get through town to the restaurant. In fact my trip to the airport fro the Loop was easier. We arrived slightly late and one man down due to illness. We however were greeted graciously and after a short wait were taken to the upstairs dining room. We passed a ton of staff, offering their greetings. With one of the managers, telling us ""Dont get too crazy up there!"" Did my reputation proceed me here? Now the downstairs room was very quiet. Eerily so. I was hoping that this wasn't one of those places where you had to be super proper. WHen we got upstairs, we noticed that it wasn't quite full however the larger parties where in the main room and they were having a good time. We decided to do the Grand Menu with the wine pairings and we were on our way....

One of the most renowned restaurants in Chicago if not the country for a reason. After so many years of watching the man on TV, I finally got the cuisine. However deep down I can't help to think that after the many fine dining experiences I have had in recent years, Charlie Trotter's is frozen in time somehow. Was it really time for him to move on and get a fresh perspective? Regardless of the answer, it will always be a classic.  Our server Fran has been with the organization for 25 years, the 2nd longest behind another server and Chef himself. I think as non regulars it took them a while to warm up to us. I felt a bit of rigidity, lack of comfort as we're not regulars. Apparently there are folks that have been there 400 times and lots of powerful and famous people. Well even though Im not one of them, you expected to be treated that way in a place like this. We then honed in on Tomasz one of the other servers which totally changed the experience. He turned what seemed to be a by the books service into something more personable. From there on out after much talking, gathering stories,and questions, we broke through to the others. It turns out Tomasz's sister was even recruited by him to work the floor in the last days of opening. After finishing up our last dessert, I made my way across the room and ran into Rajat Parr of Michael Mina Group fame. Weird to think I'd travel across the country to run into someone in my area.  Afterwards we were given a tour of the kitchen and got to speak with some of the line where the magic happens. The giant stockpot, the binchotan grill, the chefs table, the Pass. So many cool things that will no longer exist come end of month. Im guessing the many people that are working here will move onto many new future ventures. Will Chef Trotter come back after a sabbatical and get the band back together? Will he try something new, get new inspiration? Only time will tell. If he does, Ill make sure not to wait so long before giving his new venture a visit.",0.9921,0.874,0.091,0.035,0.486635954135954
2012-08-24,5.0,"Obviously, this review is long overdue so here is the ditty. Trotters had been on my bucket list of restaurants for several years and my dear friends were kind enough to take me here for my birthday back in June. I was blown away with this offer, not only because CT is the best of the best, but also because they are closing at the end of this month.  You all know the drill with course tastings so I'll leave out all that jazz. Clearly, you're going to drop a load of cash here for very small, well presented portions but it's all about the experience and service.  The food? Out of this world. As each dish arrived, we kept saying ""this is the best thing we've had so far"", only to be blown away when the next plate was put in front of us. We had a choice between the meat or the vegetable courses. Duh, we picked the carnivore selection. How could you not when you're paying that much money?  Service was absolutely flawless. Our waiter was a doll and so many different people were helping out with the table, not a single thing was missed. Waters refilled as soon as you take a sip, bread and mouth watering whipped butter whenever you want it. Every. Single. Thing. is thought out here. We decided to do the wine pairing as well which was full of information and fabulous vino.  One thing that still stands out is the fact that it was so quiet in there. Seriously, it's like you're eating in a very old filthy rich mansion. Tables are very close together so if you feel like talking dirty, the entire restaurant will be bending over to listen. I wish they had played some low classical music or at least some Sinatra. I was also surprised to find out that there are only about 10 tables in the dining room so it was a very intimate experience.  We were there for a little over 4 hours, so make sure to block out some time... I'm VERY glad I got to try out this one of a kind restaurant before their time comes to an end.

2012-08-18,3.0,Not being one to blow smoke up anyone's ass here is a truthful review. I ate there on the 14th of August one of the last nights they were open. I have heard this is one of the finest restaurants in the world and figured if it was going to close I have to give it a try. Drove in from GR Michigan for the meal. As I walked in I was astonished at the decor. I understand it's closing but the place looked like it has needed a little breath of life since 1984. As one of the most highly recognized chefs in the U.S. with limitless staff under his command You would think he could change things up a little as far as menu items go. Reading other reviews and the website before dinning I new what was going to be offered. One vegetarian and one meat eaters option I mean come on. I was in the business for a while and found myself turned off by the repetition. It becomes factory work with food. Challenge your boys a little let them be creative. The food was prepared well with a few exceptions such as the duck it hadn't been rendered long enough the skin could not be cut as hard as I tried. The beef cheek was absolutely cooked to death not fall apart and unctuous but dry and formed into a puck. With a large Hispanic population in my town I can get better down the street for 6.99 a pound and it will be cooked properly. We were not up for having alcohol with the meal so we tried the n/a beverage pairings some were good but not anything you couldn't do at home. I thought it was a little strange that they were served with as much sediment in them as they were and one had a couple whole ice cubes floating around in it. Woops. I will say I am glad I ate there but I think they have the right idea close up shop and re group.,0.9579,0.876,0.091,0.033,0.4957597868081739
2012-08-16,4.0,"Overpriced?  Absolutely, but ... Worth the price?  Yes!, H E double hockey sticks YES I didn't think that I would ever eat here, and with it closing I knew that if not now, then it will be never.  So I had to have my first two Michelin star experience and it was fantastic! I understand people being upset that there were three desserts.  BUT c'mon people they will probably be some if not the best three desserts that you will eat in your lifetime.  Nothing was too sweet or heavy.  The raspberry sorbet and corn gelato were freaking ridiculously good.  If I was sitting in a corner and no one was watching, I would turn around and lick the plate clean.  The best desserts that I have eaten have been from Michelin star restaurants, and this is not an exception.  In fact, I seriously just hope that I get another opportunity to eat a better dessert! Entrees were fantastic.  Expectations were definitely achieved.  I am not a red meat eater, so no beef cheek or lamb for me.  Instead they just removed the beef cheek (if i knew they would do that, I would have given it to my friends who loved it) and squab instead of lamb which honestly could have been more duck, I couldn't tell the difference, both were fantastic.  Presentation on each plate was so precise and beautiful.   of course price/value is not there.  It's not about the quantity of the food which kills me that people think they should be rolled out on a wheelbarrow because they think that paying almost 3 hundo (with a glass of wine) per person should keep you stuffed for a week.  GET REAL, the more expensive food is, the less you get.  but the experience, OH the experience can never be matched at any other non Michelin starred restaurant.   Service was slow and more relaxed.  I did not mind it too much.  They could have filled water a bit faster or asked me sooner if I wanted a glass of wine, p.s. the Riesling by the glass (18 bucks) was outstanding. best part of the night was watching all the different decanters come out for my friend that did the wine pairing.  also getting a tour of the kitchen and side room wasn't too shabby either. It was very exciting and all you have to do is ask for one and they are more than happy to give a tour!!  Also Chef Charlie Trotter signed our menu.  What a fantastic keepsake. I am glad to have been able to experience such a wonderful restaurant by a world renowned chef.  It is one that I will never forget!",0.9978,0.722,0.209,0.069,0.5950396825396825
2012-08-15,2.0,"* * This review is based upon enjoyment/price/value. There is that person who wants to be at the best CSO concert ever, can't wait to shout Bravo and applaud before the last note is played.  Sometimes it's not the best.   I've looked at some of the recent reviews since going to Trotter's for the first time (at its closing moments).  We had a major gift so we were going no matter what.  I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before going.  But I must say the most recent seem accurate. The bottom line is that I don't think the dining experience warrants the price--this is true despite a third of our bill being paid by the gift. On the décor, there is something to be said for its simplicity--maybe a quiet conservative canvas to draw the focus to the serving of the several courses, a simple classical image honed by years of stellar food.  Perhaps.  For some reason I was reminded of the old Chez Paul dining room. Food on the whole was 8/10.  Three dessert servings did seem too much--three courses of sweet for a sweet-aholic is even too much.  (Of the desserts, the ice cream with Michigan cherries was very good--intense cherry with a contrast of bourbon ice cream).   The entrees preceding the dessert courses were better.  Of those, the duck and lamb reached exquisite--simple preparation of the meat and a combination of flavors brought the top quality essence of the featured selections to the front. Service: good start, followed by poor execution.  A companion was gluten and dairy intolerant.  The head waiter said not a problem at all.  This, of course, would trigger a service of gluten free bread one would think.  The breads did come very slowly for the table and yet more slowly for the one gluten free guest.    Once presented, they were quite creative and varied--not the gluten free ones however, sporadically offered. Approximately an hour to an hour and a half after the first course, a hostess came to ask us our taste reaction to the previous course.  She explained that the chef oftentimes looks for feedback.  Really?  I truly had a hard time remembering the taste sensations.  The consensus was that they had lost track of what they had served the table and were trying to recover.  A better approach is to just say what happened and make amends. At meal's end, the table next to us complained to the server about the lack of attentiveness to drinks, that they had been attended to better on earlier visits.  One patron's drinks were removed from the bill.

I am like everyone else.  As soon as I heard Charlie Trotter's was closing after 25 years I knew I had to go.  How can I be in Chicago and not got?  So I went on Open table and tried to book one immediately...  nothing... nothing... nothing.  I called and got a reservation!  Woo Hoo!  I am in!   Last night was the night.  We arrived at about 9 for our 9:15 reservation.  The door man greeted us and made a little small talk which instantly made me feel comfortable.  I always get nervous when I think it's going to be stuffy but he set the tone for the night.  The hostess greeted us even thought the foyer was packed with people, some coming and some leaving.  Less then 2 minutes later and they took us to our table.  We were seated upstairs which was nice because on the way up the stairs, there were old menus and other memorabilia on the walls.   We were greeted right away at the table.  We were given our menus and they explained the Grand Menu and the Vegetable Menu as well as the wine pairings and the wine menu.  I didn't even look at the wine menu because it was the size of an encyclopedia.  ""Grand Menu and the wine pairing, Please.""  ""Make that two!""  He grabbed our menus and was off.   Now, normally I focus on food, but I just have to say, the service was amazing!  Our water glasses were never empty.  Our bread plates were always filled with soft warm rolls (wheat, pretzel, sourdough, some sort of bacon filled) that were amazing.  Various people brought our plates, cleared our plates, filled our glasses, and removed the empty glasses.  Each one was polite and prompt.  They were happy to explain each item (food or wine) and were knowledgeable enough to answer any questions we had about either.   Now on to the food.  It was amazing...  I haven't been to Next or Alinea or Tru so I can't compare like some others have on here.  I judge it solely on it's own.  I loved it.  The first course set the tone.  Salmon with shallots and an oyster.  It was rich and flavorful.  The broth it came in was amazing.  You could taste the butter and lemon so clearly.  The champagne served with it complimented it so well.  Each course and the pairings were perfectly matched.  My favorite course by far was the Duck with spring onions.  I'm not a foam person but even the coconut foam was amazing.  It was tender and perfectly cooked.  It was served with a beautiful Italian red wine.  The night ended with a chocolate cake with toasted hazelnuts, a coco nib powder and a Strawberry and Tonka bean sorbet.  I could have done without the sorbet (which reminded me of cough syrup) but the rest of it was amazing.  It was served with a desert zinfandel that I loved!  I'm not a huge dessert wine person but this was amazing.  It was sweet but not too sweet like a port or a white dessert wine.  I am now a fan of dessert wines.   Goodbye, Mr Trotter.  Thanks for the 25 years.  I am so glad that I got to experience this and so sad that I will not be able to experience it again.",0.9993,0.749,0.236,0.015,0.6444885361552026
2012-08-12,3.0,"As others have said, nothing was bad, but nothing blew my mind. And for $195, I wanted some mind-blowing food. I won't echo what others have said about the dated decor -- I went in expecting to have a sense of humor about it. And it wasn't ugly, just not what's ""hot"" right now. Fine, whatever, I'm not there for the interior design. Nothing was that memorable on the tasting -- and 3 desserts out of 8 courses seemed silly. It was 3 fish courses (oyster, hamachi, a tiny piece of salmon that was my favorite), 2 meat courses (duck and lamb, both a little overcooked and uninspired in preparation) and 3 desserts. More than a 1/3 of the meal was dessert. And dessert is where restaurants recoup a lot of costs because they are the cheapest to make, so when you're getting miniscule pieces of fish and meat and 3 dessert courses, one of which is sorbet, it's kind of bullshit. A cheese course would have been nice in lieu of one of the desserts.  We did not do the wine pairing, because $125 for 8 half-glasses seemed ridiculous. I took on the task of navigating the wine tome and we found a $70 bottle of Sancerre (which was opened before it was brought to the table, oddly enough) and a $145 bottle of Barolo. So instead of spending $500 for 4 people to have the tasting, we spent much less and had plenty of good wine to go around. The oddest thing about the experience was the service. We were sitting for at least 10 minutes before our server came over. And nice as he was, he did not have an indoor voice. He was really loud, like he was missing the internal volume control most people have. It was funny and awkward. Everyone else who presented food was almost inaudible. Finally, after we finished our bottle of white, we ordered our red wine and were brought new glasses. No one cleared the empty white glasses. Finally, we asked for them to be cleared. 20 minutes later, we had to ask again. 20 minutes later, we asked a 3rd time and finally, they were cleared. This was astonishing to me, as a former server. Clearing empty glasses is like Server 101, whether you work at Applebee's or Alinea.   So while I'm glad to have made it in before it closed, for those of you lamenting the fact that you never got to try Trotter's, you haven't missed that much. Maybe in its heyday, it was worth it, but now the only reason to go is just to be able to say you went.",0.9638,0.846,0.102,0.053,0.5600764483743208

We had to get here before they close the doors forever, and so a couple of my girlfriends made the night happen. My girlfriend was so surprised as her husband had only put down that she was going to dinner with me that night. As we parked at valet did she see the sign for Charlie Trotter valet. It is located in a very inconspicuous place, like someone's home. As we entered there were several staff and other guests in the foyer making the experience feel very much like we were at a gathering in someone's home getting ready to eat. We were led to our table and seated with beautiful plateware in front of us. We were given wine menus that could easily bore weights. I decided on a bottle of red wine which was rich and earthy and went down way too easily. I think I might have finished two thirds of the bottle myself.

The 8 courses were all very good, some outstanding.  My favorites were the oyster and the duck breast.  The duck breast was truly a stunner, marrying earthy rich duck breast with coconut and subtle Asian spice.  Too bad there were only a few bites of this.  I found the wine pairings nice, with the star being the Valpolicella which was very memorable.  While the dishes were generally delicious, there was a noticeable lack of any vegetables to accompany the meats. The 8 courses initially came out one by one, with plenty of time given for us to savor and appreciate.  But then the final two desserts came out together.  What's up with that?  Between the two large plates, several wine glasses, bud vase, and silverware, my space at the table was really cluttered and it was difficult to focus on either dessert let alone figure out where to put down my spoon.

2012-07-13,3.0,"Came to Chicago on a business trip and went here with several coworkers. Being from the bay area, I have access to a lot of fine dining destinations, so hearing the reputation of Charlie Trotter, I came with fairly high expectations. Overall the food was very very good, every dish was progressively better and better. The duck dish with chocolate sauce was definitely very good and the lamb with crushed espresso bean was very good as well. The King Salmon dish with sweet potato was also very good. My favorite dish of the night was the hamachi in squid ink, that was truly one of the most interesting dishes of hamachi I've had. However, nothing was *truly* outstanding. The flavors were certainly there, but I honestly can say that I have had better back in the bay area, in terms of dining experiences and food.  This restaurant deserves 4 stars (truly does), but the one thing that kinda put me off was Charlie Trotter himself. He was a total jerk, not friendly to his paying patrons, he was arrogant and very cocky. He yelled at us for being in the kitchen!  Although the food was good and the service was very friendly and warm, I don't think it merited the $195 price tag for JUST 8 courses. The food was good in general, but there was nothing really unique and didn't introduce anything that was unique and new to me. I felt that I could have gotten a lot of the dishes I had tonight at other restaurants at half the price I paid that evening. The entire tasting menu were basic ingredients and had nothing super interesting or introduced new flavors. I mean, okay King Salmon, ho-hum. Hamachi? I can go down the sushi restaurant for that. Duck? Okay that's pricey and it was good. Lamb? okay I guess. Where's the real unique and weird stuff man?!  I've dined at a 12 course place that was still less than CT (Manresa in Los Gatos @ $175 ) and I even felt it was more interesting and more adventurous and worth it than CT. I guess you're paying for the reputation. I also felt that $150 for the wine pairing was a bit much even though they did pair very nicely.  I truly wanted to love CT and the food was good, but the attitude and the price was a bit much for what you were getting. I'm hoping to go to Alinea on my next visit and it's only $10 more than CT with twice as many courses and real cooking techniques...   CT, sorry but you will not be sorely missed in the food world.",0.9966,0.742,0.197,0.061,0.5534429899906089
2012-07-08,3.0,"Hearing that Charlie Trotter's was closing in a month (because Charlie is going to travel with his wife and then go back to school) is like hearing that a guy your friends have been dying to set you up with is getting married to someone else.  I have been wanting to go to Charlie Trotter's restaurant for years, but in my 20's, I didn't have money. Then, I got to my 30's... and suddenly Girl and the Goat and Graham Elliot were a priority. Both did not disappoint. But, I felt like I had time to do an excessive Chicago culinary tour well into my 40's, but Charlie Trotter's early departure from this tour moved them up to this weekend.  On my phone, I plugged in what I thought was a shot-in-the-dark attempt at getting a reservation and got one, however late. We were seated at 9:15pm, although our reservation was at 9:30. I was surprised by the quantity of empty tables as we walked through the restaurant... and that we were walking past them to some other location. They took us up a steep flight of stairs to the hot second floor. Minutes later, a couple, that immediately started talking about head cheese, was seated directly next to us.  Our selection options were a vegetarian or a meat-centric prix fixe menu, which we attempted to research before we arrived, but there is no information online about the day's selections. We were still quickly comfortable with the meat lovers $195 Grand Menu. Just to clarify: that $195 does not include alcohol. Our first service person told us in detail about the wine pairings (""this is a SYRAH that is made from FOUND grapes on a PINOT orchard""), but when we asked for their scotch options, he said they didn't have scotch. We mulled that over for several minutes and decided on other options. Then, the second service person came and told us they did have scotch and whiskey... or rather that he could ""get"" some for us. This was said in a ""you-want-whiskey-oh-I-know-a-guy"" kind of tone.  After getting through the prohibition-like drink ordering, we had some time before the first course.    Eating in this restaurant is like eating in a mid-price restaurant that happens to have a prix fix menu... in the 80's. We started to have a running theory that the reason Chef Charlie may be closing is so that he wouldn't have to redecorate. It was like going on a date in a John Hughes movie. It felt like at any moment someone in taffeta would get proposed to. Here are the specifics:  1.  We were seated at 9:15pm and we left at 12:15am. There could have easily been 90 minutes taken off of this total time.  2.  There were eight courses and three were desserts. I have a sweet tooth, but this was intimidating. 3.  We had no less than seven people serving us during our time there. Some were more confident than others, but most seemed to have ""senior-itis"". They were basically signing year books in the hallway. 4.  The tuna with fennel was a great start. I want that as an appetizer every time I eat sushi. 5.  The hamachi covered in squid ink was unimpressive... and a little scary. It still tasted great for however worried I was about undoing any teeth whitening treatment I have ever done. 6.  The salmon, the duck and the antelope were the highlights and the reason why people should have come here... in the 80's. 7.  You would think that three dessert courses would come out quickly at midnight, but that is an inaccurate assumption, although the raspberry one was absolutely beautiful. Crunchy, cold and tart. Two things that pulled us out of our overly critical experience:  1. The BREADS. Yes, they get capital letters. Amazing. Bacon rolls. Pretzel rolls. Yes, yes, yes. 2.  With Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin playing in the background, we would occasionally remember, fondly, the world outside. The final score is an 8 out of 10. Not better than Graham Elliot... which may be the best meal of my life, but I haven't eaten at Alinea yet. In closing, ladies and gentlemen, I got needlessly defensive about the recent reviews of Charlie Trotter's before actually going there and now I support them.

2012-07-06,2.0,"My husband and I decided to dine here before the restaurant closes at the end of August.  Part of me debated whether posting a review was even worth it because the restaurant is closing anyway.   We had a 9 PM reservation and arrived on time.  We waited approximately 10-15 minutes before we were seated, which wasn't the biggest deal but sort of annoying.  There were several couples waiting to be seated and we were all standing in the cramped lobby together.  Not exactly ambiance.  After being seated at our table, no wait staff even approached us for another 10-15 minutes.  We finally received the menus and waited another 20 minutes.  When the server finally came back, I wanted some input as to a type of Oregon Pinot Noir to order.  The server knew nothing about any of them and just said ""they're all good"".  I would expect that at an establishment such as CT the staff would be knowledgeable about the wine selection or they would send the sommelier over.  Our server just looked at me annoyed that I even asked any questions.  When you're spending $120 on a $40 bottle of wine, I would think one deserves to enjoy it and have their questions answered regarding it.  After we finally ordered, it took another 45 minutes to get the first course. I would have to agree with the other reviewers that the food was just ""meh"" for what it was supposed to be.  My husband and I both commented that it took so long to get all of our courses that we just couldn't wait for dinner to be over.  The service was so slow and poor that we both just couldn't wait to get into our jammies and go to sleep.  I literally started to fall asleep at the table.  A late reservation (because we couldn't get in any earlier), super slow service, a bottle of wine, and so-so food that was poorly coursed out= nap time for me! The best thing about our experience was the wine, which is ironic because I picked it on a whim as our server knew nothing about it.  Go to Binny's and pick yourself up some for a fraction of the price (Soter 2009 Willamette Valley Oregon) Overall, for the $600 we spent, it was totally not worth it.  I would suggest going and staying a night at the Peninsula (as we did for my 30th birthday), enjoying their spa, and ordering room service.  You'll spend the same amount of money and have the amazing experience you deserve.",0.9599,0.887,0.076,0.037,0.4887096774193548
2012-07-06,3.0,"At a high-end establishment like Charlie Trotter's you come for three things: food, ambiance, and service.  Food 6/10:  It's a tasting menu with several courses (around 8) that's rather random. I believe a meal of such a high caliber restaurant should be a gastronomical story, and this is more like a collection of random poems.  Some of the courses were fairly bland. For instance, there was a Hamachi dish that was maybe half a bite and was very rubbery. Some of the dishes, however, were true standouts: for instance, an elk dish with a sweet and savory sauce with some sort of crispy rendered fat.  Normally, when someone complains about there not being enough food, I dismiss them as having a grotesque apetite, but the dishes are VERY small. Unless you go through several bottles of wine you might end up hungry.  Compared to Alinea, Charlie Trotter's really doesn't hold a candle.  Ambiance 7/10: Upon arrival, you're greeted by the Maitre D' and led to an elegant yet not overly opulant dining room. The noise level is perfect. We were a little loud but this promoted conversation among other parties so it didn't feel awkward. There were some extremely awkward dates going on, however. Some strange music started playing halfway through our meal. Service 6/10: At the begnining of your mealThe waiter brings out an incredible wine list, waits a few seconds until we all get the Grand Tasting menu, and is on his way for 45 min. The time between courses is very long, and occasionally bread is served along with the wine refilled, but our first waiter was often inattentive and left some wine glasses unfilled for 15 minutes at a time.  At the end, we were given a tour of the wine cellar and had a neat conversation with some of the people that maintained it. This was a nice way to end the night and overcame a some of the wait problems we experienced. Overall:  3.2/5",0.9896,0.846,0.135,0.02,0.5475925925925925
2012-07-06,2.0,"Went there in late June with my wife for my birthday.  It was overall an okay experience.   The one thing I would like to point out is that the servers forgot to bring out one course for us!  We ordered the Grand Menu which has 8 courses.  Sometime around the 3rd of 4th course, we waited a good 45 min until the next course.  We thought something was a little strange at the time, but didn't really think too much about it. As we were driving home, we were looking at the souvenir menu that they handed out and noticed we were not served one of the main salmon entrees!  A little shocked that something like this could happen at a restaurant of this caliber, we promptly called the restaurant the next morning and explained the situation.  The person on the phone looked into the issue, apologized and said they would mail over a complimentary gift for the mistake.   My wife and I were satisfied with this response because hey, mistakes happen. We eagerly awaited the package wondering the possibilities.  Could it be another free meal?!?  A voucher for some items at Trotter's To Go?  A nice bottle of wine from that ridiculously extensive wine list?  Being an accountant by day, I couldn't help but do a little math to estimate the value of that one missing entree.  Considering the Grand Menu costs $195 per person, add in tax and the automatic %18 tip, I calculated that each course is a little over $30.  With the 2 of us, we were cut short over $60! So with figure in mind, we were expecting something pretty significant. To cut to the chase, a package arrives as promised.  Inside is a signed copy of Trotter's book, Lessons in Excellence.   just a bit ironic...   Disappointed?  yes.  The restaurant's victory lap really just seems like a last cry to stay relevant.  I wish we had taken our $600 somewhere that still cares about its reputation.",0.9926,0.718,0.195,0.087,0.5018229166666667
2012-07-05,1.0,"My girlfriends and I were in Chicago over a weekend in June 2012.  Before we arrived in Chicago, we tried to get reservations at Alinea but they were full for several months.  So at the girlfriend's suggestion, we went to Charlie Trotter.  Went to check his bio out on Google and also the price of his fixed price menu.  His website at that time said the fixed price menu (non vegetarian) was $150.  Now on his website, all you see is his darn virtual clock, counting the number of days and minutes til it closes....there is a reason why it is closing and should be closed.  The food, the atmosphere and the Chef does not live up to its hype. The service was excellent and attentive.  The food was creatively presented, but certainly was not all that tasty and flavorful.  First of all, I expected my meal to cost $150 as it was indicated on the website.  However, on his actual menu, the cost was $195....is he trying to gouge his customers one last time before it closes?  With all the money he makes from the business, he can't pay someone to update his website? I ordered a bottle of 2005 Riesling from California and it is the ONLY wine in my life that I had to send back.  I guess the tell tale sign was when both the Sommalier and his assistant had to taste it a few times to see if it was good.  When I tried it, it was the worst Riesling I had ever tried.  There was no sweetness to it and it tasted like rocks...guess I should have known better considering it was a 7 yr wine.  The Sommalier explained that through time, it had mineralized and that was what I was tasting.  BULL$*@!...it was wine that had gone bad and should have been taken off the wine menu.  It was better left for cooking wine.  The Sommalier did suggest a younger, slightly more expensive Riesling (2009) that was from Germany and it tasted like a Riesling should. Near the end of our meal, we were ""ordered"" to go on a tour of the kitchen.  All we did was say ""hi"" to him once in the evening and he took that gesture as our intent to see more of his operation.  We obligingly accepted the tour.  One of his interns gave us the tour.  The kitchen was small and for the amount of staff working there, it felt cramped.  I observed that the kitchen staff there did not appear happy to work there.  The intern told me that they work 15 hours days!  I wonder how much of my $200 meal goes to pay the interns? Next, we were shown his kitchen TV studio.  There we met Charlie and he was being pleasant.  But he certainly wasn't pleasant when another patron tried to take his picture.  He ripped into him, calling his customer ""rude"" to take his picture without his permission....I thought he was a ""celebrity"" chef and would welcome the publicity.  As we were leaving, we noticed that Charlie was giving this same patron the middle finger while his picture was being taken.  That certainly topped off a rather, largely disappointing evening of what was supposed to be a ""mind blowing"" food experience.  At least, I had the lovely company of my girlfriends to contend with. Utterly the worst fine dining experience in my life at CT....spent over $300 that I will never get back and shitted it out the next day.  Thank GOD it will be closed down.",0.993,0.829,0.123,0.047,0.468563492063492

2012-07-02,1.0,"I honestly expected to come here and find people ranting about their recent experiences at Trotter's. My wife and I went there 10 years ago and it was easily one of the greatest dining experiences we've ever had, everything a world-class meal should be. We decided to go once more after hearing it was closing, and now we regret that we did. Everything about it has seriously declined. The food wasn't nearly as inventive, well-presented, or (most importantly) tasty. In fact, a couple of courses were just boring and bland, both in presentation and flavor. The service, a true fine-dining machine on our previous visit, was an absolute mess. Early on I had a server reach across my face and basically fling a roll onto my plate; it landed upside down. Most courses either came too quickly or took too long: e.g., dessert took over 45 minutes to arrive, which was about 40 minutes after its wine pairing had been poured. We also received both dessert courses at once, which was not how it was served to the table next to ours. Finally, we had to listen to staff complain about customers while they prepped the table next to us. None of this would have happened at Trotter's previously. In fairness, it appears they have a lot of very young people on staff now, maybe as some sort of internship/apprenticeship or perhaps because the professional staff is leaving. That's fine, even admirable, and we might have forgiven the subpar food/service accordingly had it not been for the fact that Chef Trotter decided to significantly raise his prices immediately after announcing his closing. We'd assumed that was because the restaurant was going to go out with a bang and do some really special things to celebrate its closing. Instead it's just price-gouging, plain and simple. I never imagined Trotter's would ever drop its standards so low. Definitely seems that Charlie is phoning it in at this point. In any case, if you are planning to go one last time before it closes, please reconsider, and if you have a reservation, consider cancelling it. Maybe you won't be as disappointed as we were, but consider whether you want to take the risk at around $300/person. Previously I would have recommended Trotter's without hesitation. Instead I now have to recommend finding a place that isn't closing soon and still has an interest in providing a memorable (for the right reasons) experience for that kind of money.

2012-07-02,4.0,"*/  Very sad to hear of Charlie's passing today, Nov 5, 2013, at the age of 54 /* Not sure if this review would make any difference (except for those who are curious to know).  If you plan to dine there in the remaining 45 days before the place closes down, you had to make reservations 2 months in advance, and if you are fortunate enough to have a reservation, you better go there irrespective of what anyone tells you.  If you don't yet have reservations, good luck. So here it goes.  It was a very special dinner, like I said we had to make reservations 2 months in advance.  My wife wanted to go there for the past 10 years, so finally we did and I am glad. And, I think it was the most expensive meal I have ever had, or at least one I had to pay for.  (Advise: if you are going, you might want to bring back some souvenir, I wish I had the ""menu of the day"" signed by CT, or names of all the wines...) Like others have said, they have two set menu for food, one Veg (although not strictly vegetarian) and another one Grand. You can chose either one with the option of paired wines ($125 extra, per person).  Both of us chose the Grand Menu, but shared the Paired wines option. There with 7 or 8 courses, incl. 3 dessert courses. Each came with a special wine... starting with a limited edition Champagne, specially  for Charlie Trotter's Silver Jubilee.  All portions were small and they took long to serve each one of them, serving some breads in between along with the wines. The entire dinner took about 2:30 hrs. and I was a bit tipsy at the end it, even hungover the next day.  On the whole, the food was delicious, wines were well matched, but I would NOT call it EXCEPTIONAL. Best part for us was when Charlie Trotter and his recently married wife, Rochelle greeted us at the entrance and escorted us for a personal tour of Chef's kitchen.  They even posed for pictures with us, which we will cherish.",0.992,0.839,0.146,0.015,0.5524651274651275

There were some comments on Yelp saying there wasn't enough food, so I just want to throw in my two cents.  Both my husband and I felt really satisfied (I was pretty full) after we ate all the 8 dishes, all the drinks, some of the bread, plus the coffee (him) or tea (me).  Unless you are a really big eater, I don't think there will be a problem fulfilling your appetite.",0.9953,0.766,0.218,0.017,0.682905982905983

It was such a great experience to see the various chefs in action - and to see the detail and precision that goes in making a dish and plating a dish was phenomenal. It was truly awe inspiring.

After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I kind of thought I'd be dining in a time warp, surrounded by black lacquer with gold accents and silk floral arrangements, a la 1984.  I had visions of pretentious waiters in pleated suits rambling off memorized scripts.  I also expected that the food and service would not live up to the experience I had at Alinea and the like.  Boy was I in for a surprise. The first thing that struck me was that the atmosphere was comfortable.  No black lacquer in sight.  We were there to celebrate my birthday and the staff could not have been nicer.  Since I'm sure that everyone going to this place is celebrating something,  it has to get old for them.  You wouldn't know it, they made a big enough deal without making it obnoxious.  I was a little afraid when they threatened to sing but thank goodness they were kidding.  I loved it. The staff was friendly and relaxed.  Attentive enough but not overbearing and our meal was paced very nicely.  It was perfect.  When they noticed that we were there to have a fun night, they even came out with a sense of humor.  A pleasant surprise. We both went with the Grand Menu.  Sure, none of our food was served on a slowly deflating pillow of scented air, but all of the food was outstanding.  The flavors were unique and delicious in every dish.  There was not a single one that I didn't like, or want to lick the plate.  I feel like in a lot of restaurants, taste is sacrificed for presentation.  Not here.  The presentation was beautiful but the flavor combinations were definitely the highlight. I chose the wine pairings with the menu, which were very good.  The non alcoholic pairings, however, were exceptional.  I swear, I was ready to bribe one of the chefs for a recipe book.  If I could make these juice combinations at home, I would never drink again.  So so good.  Get these. After dinner, we asked for a tour of the kitchen.  I'm so glad we did.  I was struck by how young all of the chefs were but Chef Trotter definitely runs a tight ship.  It was a pleasure having the opportunity to meet him and nice to see that he is present throughout the service. It was truly a special experience having the opportunity to go.  I was afraid it wouldn't be worth the hype but everything far exceeded my expectations.  I hope we haven't seen the last of Charlie Trotter.",0.9991,0.692,0.264,0.044,0.64744708994709

2012-05-25,3.0,"My wife and I dined at Charlie Trotter's on Saturday, May 5 to celebrate our anniversary.  I had the Grand Menu ($195) and my wife had the Vegetable Menu ($150).  We spent about $140 on wine - a $100 bottle with dinner and two $20 glasses of dessert wine.  With a 21% tip (18% of which was mandatory), our total was around $650. We previously dined at CT's in October 2008.  That meal was one of the best we've ever had and was certainly a five star experience.  In contrast, this dinner was a big disappointment. We arrived at 9:30 and the lobby was packed with diners waiting to be seated.  The hosts/hostesses and the wait staff looked a bit disjointed and agitated.  Our service throughout the evening was fine.  We were served by a team of waiters, some better than others.  Often, the dishes were nervously or inadequately described (sometimes omitting elements of the dishes, including elements mentioned on the menu).  We were not offered petit fours at the end of the meal (I believe other tables around us were, but I could be wrong).  Our anniversary was not mentioned at any point during the meal.  We were not given our menus after the meal.  I believe CT's always does this; we did receive a phone call the next week offering to mail the menus to us.  We were offered a tour of the kitchen but we declined given that it was after 1 am and we toured the kitchen on our last visit. While exceptional service is nice, my wife and I think the food is much more important.  And the food was the big problem on our visit.  The meal was exceptionally formulaic.  Between the two of us, we ate 15 unique dishes (we doubled up on a dessert).  Almost every dish involved the same basic plan:  (a) two sauces - always on the bottom of the plate and next to each other; (b) four to six other elements, all slightly stacked on top of or right next to one another; (c) one of these elements was a foam, puree or crumbles, (d) each of these elements was approximately the same size; and (e) some greenery as an accent. All of the elements were expertly prepared and some of them were quite interesting (a punchy fava bean puree, unagi, antelope).  However, because of the repetition in style and presentation none of the dishes was memorable and it seemed that almost any element could be used with almost any dish.  For instance, the ch-ch-ch-chia seeds in a clear slime was fascinating but could have been served with the halibut instead of the strawberry dessert.  The goat cheese foam could have been served with almost any dish.  To walk away from a 3.5 hour dinner with no strong memories is a shame, especially since we can still remember some of our dishes from October 2008 so clearly. I heard from friends that CT's has been in decline for a couple of years.  We had such a wonderful meal there before that we had to travel to Chicago to eat there again before it closes in August.  The service was OK.  The food was good and interesting.  However, given the restaurant's reputation, price and our prior experience there, we were very disappointed.  If CT's was staying open, we likely would not return.  I write this review as a warning for those who might try to fit in a visit before August 17.  It's just not the same.",0.991,0.848,0.109,0.043,0.4942577030812325

2012-05-23,2.0,"Went here while visiting Chicago after hearing it was closing in a few months.  We were very excited to experience it as we had heard it was absolutely amazing.  Also, my SO recently completed culinary school and was interested to see what made this restaurant so famous. Dinner started off fine - one of us had the Vegetable Menu and one had the Grand Tasting Menu.  One of us chose the non-alcoholic beverage pairing (juices, teas, etc.), which was great, and one just opted for wine by the glass.  The food was overall very good, although the deserts were the least exciting part. However, the experience overall left a lot to be desired.  It was clear that much of the long-term waitstaff has departed in preparation for the closing, and those that were there barely knew the menu, stuttered over ingredients and generally behaved nervously and confused (although we're not sure if this has something to do with the man running the show).  We were not offered coffee or aperitifs, and had to ask for coffee after finishing the final desert course, although we waited for literally 20 minutes for the sorbet intermezzo. A puffed-up Chef Trotter was in the house and making his presence well known - he punched a wall, said ""it is what it is"" and huffed about until being introduced to a VIP guest at a corner table, who he then spent much of the evening with yukking it up and guffawing and speaking so loudly that we could hear most of their conversation.  He made the rounds to most of the tables (of the over-50 crowd), inviting them to the kitchen for a tour, but skipped over us and another table of younger patrons (we also heard another younger couple have to ask for a tour upon departing).  We had to ask one of the waitstaff for a tour.

We ate at Trotter's a number of times while we were living in Chicago, and always had a memorable, top-drawer experience.  When we heard it was closing, we flew back for one just night for the sole purpose of having one last Trotter's meal with a couple of close friends.  Let me start with the few good points:  The wine pairings were, as always, excellent.  The halibut on the grand tasting menu was out of this world, as was the stinging nettle soup.  Everything else... -We waited at least 20 minutes for our first course.  In the meantime, they gave us butter, but no bread....   -After the first course was whisked away, we sat for 27 minutes (we timed it), with empty wine AND empty water glasses before the second course showed up.  -When the second course finally arrived, we asked what was going on.  We were told that they were baking fresh bread and it would be out shortly.  Okay, that's fine, just tell us why we have no bread - don't leave it as a puzzling mystery.  And no one apologized for the lack of water or bread, or for the glacial pacing of the courses. -Still, our water wasn't refilled for another 10 minutes.  -While we sat waiting for the third course, bread was finally dropped on our plates. It was ice cold and stale.  Not just day-old...it was dried out, hard-as-a-rock stale. -Our main courses were brought out and presented with a flourish while one of us was in the bathroom. -Three desert courses were brought to the table with absolutely no explanation of what they were (these came quickly - the staff obviously was in a hurry to get home at the end of the night).  Finally, we flagged down a server who told us that a plate of soft candies were ""apricot, apple, white fudge and...something else.""  At the outset, we had told the server that one of us had a severe allergy to apricots!  If we hadn't asked, we might have been doing an emergency trach on the dining floor.  -No one asked us how the meal was, they just plopped down the check ($400/head).  After giving our credit cards, we waited another 15 minutes (with no water) for someone to bring the slips to sign.

I should mention that I did not order the wine tasting, however, there are many half bottle options that are perhaps a more affordable way to drink here, if, like myself, you are looking for a good value on alcohol.  My friend's Mom ordered the beverage pairing (nonalcoholic) and she let us sample all of the drinks - they were fantastic, very flavorful, fresh juices with various herbs.

But this, time, this time, Charlie pulled a full-on George Lucas on us last night.  In one shot, he not only managed to clobber stuff that I held dear, he managed to retroactively rewrite my memory so that they were never cool in the first place! Seriously, the rip-off-ness was awesome, Awesome I tell you!  Once seated, we sit around for around five minutes, until nattily dressed Dude A shows up, and shows us the menu and wine list, and us being simple folks, we just said ""Bring It On, and Do The Wine Pairing please"", a choice to the tune of $400/head, but what the heck, its The Experience, isn't it? Mind you, we did tell him to skip on Rabbit and Apricots/Plums/Peaches/Any_Stone_Fruit 'cos of allergies (remember this bit) Then we sit back, relax, and wait for experience to start. 20 (!) minutes later, we're still waiting, with empty glasses. I catch Dude A's eyes, he gives a bit of a perceptibly start, vanishes, and shortly thereafter, our first course - an amuse bouche of some kind - shows up along with a glass of bubbly. Its an amuse bouche, which means that its gone in about one bite, which is a bit of a problem since we're zombie-starved at this point, but whatever, surely there is more food coming, right?  We'll just wait for the next course, because the first 20 minute delay was just them gearing up for The Experience, right? Right?  27 (!) minutes later (oh yeah, we're measuring the time at this point), we're still waiting, with empty glasses once again.  No water either, by the way.  Mind you, some random dude had come by and dropped off a few dishes of butter on the table, but that was about it. Dude A had absolutely vanished at this point, and based on everything thus far, I suspect was standing by the door behind the kitchen smoking a doobie.  Which, come to thik of it, would have been ok by me if he had just shared a bit, since it would have made the interminable wait somewhat more bearable.  Then again, maybe not, since I would then have had the munchies, and remember there was no food on the table, certainly no fritos, and no edible flowers either. So yeah, we corner Dude B, and do the ""Hey, dude, we're still here, y'know?  Perhaps some water might be nice?  Or some wine?  Maybe some bread to go with that butter over there? Or, and we're going out on a limb here, maybe some more food?"" bit. This does produce an ""I apologize"" from Dude B - the only one of the evening - who gets us our next course, and who we then proceed to never see again, (The mystery of the vanishing Dudes at Charlie Trotter's.  Discuss) but that doesn't hold a candle to the bread that showed up shortly thereafter. (Omit entire section of ridiculously stale bread that we get served.  I mean - hard as a rock. The staleosity, was at the level where, I swear, it had to be the bread equivalent of the waiter spitting in our drink.)  Me, I was reduced to helpless laughter, to the point I almost peed my pants.  Seeing as how that would be somewhat uncool, I decided to go pee in the restroom instead, which was pretty much OK, except that I come back to find that Dude C had showed up with the main course, dropped it off at the table, explained the foam this, emulsion that, beet and parsnip something else to the rest of the folks at the table, and had taken off, leaving them to do the honors for me.

About this point as best as I can tell, Dude D, and Dude E took over (Dude C vanished too.  I was really expecting Soylent Green to be one of the courses) but the next hour's highlights were     Breadcrumbs left on the table, presumably for us to snack on.     Napkins that vanished if one went to the restroom, never to reappear (the napkin, though perhaps us not reappearing may have been a good idea)     The ever present lack of water.     Mysteriously appearing bread (which was quite good this time), but only offered to some of the people at the table.     Three successive desert courses, silently left at the table, with no explanation or context (and in my case, no spoon) (more here:    dieswaytoofast.blogspot.… )",0.997,0.83,0.117,0.053,0.5150059795607741

My wife and I were enjoying the Grand Menu and midway through our waiter surprises us with a dish from the veggie tasting: miso tortellini with red cabbage, turnip confit and ponzu. Holy shit ballz! All those fancy proteins were delicious and all, but this dish was an amazing explosion of flavors and smells. It stands out as one of my top five all-time favorite dishes.

The menu on the website was exactly what we got and it was promptly and beautifully served.  Our server (from Guatemala) was knowledgable and attentive.   The food was gorgeous and the flavors developed.  Two of our party had the wine pairing, while one had the non-alcoholic pairing and the other drank non-stop cappuccinos.  The wine pairing was great except for the chocolate dessert and port pairing.  We ended up ordering a better port with the course, which was WAY better.

Everyday, as I read, one thing became apparent. Charlie Trotter is a game-changer. He's a pioneer that is responsible for Chicago being one of the hot-spots for good food. The list of chefs who've trained under him is mind boggling.  I was very pleasantly surprised that the restaurant looks like somebody's charming home. We were early, and we were ushered to our table courteously but our hostess. We had the vegetarian tasting menu (8 courses). I won't go into detail describing every course but a Frederic Raphael quote comes to mind....   ""Great restaurants are, of course, nothing but mouth-brothels. There is no point in going to them if one intends to keep one's belt buckled.""  This experience deserves respect, which is why the gentlemen are required to suit up.

2012-04-22,5.0,"Over the past year I've developed a new personal rule: I only wear spanx to Michelin starred restaurants. I know CT is closing in a few months but I think my review is valid in that if you haven't gone yet, you should.  Three of us settled into the Grand Tasting without the wine pairing. We opted for a bottle of Pinot noir instead. We ended up ordering two bottles and I loved the decanter it was served in.  To the food, I trust any chef. I know if I go somewhere decent I will be served proteins the way they were meant to be served, properly. But for some reason I have a mental block against rabbit. One of the 8 courses was rabbit. I did try a bite and ate everything around it. No big deal. Our waiter noticed I didn't eat it all, he said they would find me something else I would like. Cut to them bringing all three of us a lamb dish. IT WAS AMAZING.  HOW DID THEY KNOW? I mean after 5 courses I didn't need another protein and I didn't mind that I didn't finish the rabbit. But they cared that I didn't finish it all and brought us all something to replace that dish.  As our dessert courses started my sister isn't a fan of green apple. For that dessert she didn't eat all of the apple and it's accompaniments. The waiter also noticed that, he brought us another dessert off the vegetable tasting. It was the st. Germain/pear that I wanted to try so desperately. IT WAS ALSO AMAZING.   So after technically 10 courses we were stuffed and it was amazing. We also were seating upstairs in the loft type area and it was great to look out the windows with daylight onto Armitage. Chef Trotter also came out to greet our table, mind blowing. We asked for copies of the menu and were given them in an envelope. And finally we did get a tour of the kitchen. This was all on a busy Friday night.  I can't recommend enough that the cost of the meal is worth it for this Chicago institution. It's really a steal for the service you receive. And with the clock counting down, literally on the CT website you only have yourself to blame if you don't go before August 2012.",0.9812,0.82,0.117,0.063,0.5258370744481856

2012-04-19,5.0,"I doubt I'll say anything in here that hasn't already been said 45 times, but I was quite impressed by the 10th Michelin Star restaurant I've been to, despite the fact that I had very high expectations.  Unlike other Michelin stars I've been to aside from Everest and Tru, this is actual high end fine dining so those are the two comparisons I'm using.  Let's say pretty much everything about Trotters was better than Everest so we'll exclude that.  I have to say service was better at Tru.  This isn't unique to Trotters, but my husband and I (who appear to be in our 20's even though we're in our 30's) commonly get the 'ugh, you're young and thus don't have money and you're my lowest priority' attitude at most high end restaurants.  It's quite annoying because if they knew I've been to more high end restaurants than most of the other patrons and have plenty of money to spend (not to mention my continuous Elite Yelp! status), perhaps they would treat us differently but we continue to encounter it.  That being said, the service was still good, but noticeable that we were getting slightly snubbed do to inaccurate preconceived notions.  We didn't have the sommelier come over, which I did before each wine at Tru to explain the wine in detail as well as why he chose to pair it with that course.  I would have enjoyed that at Trotters as well.  The timing between courses was roughly the same as Tru so that was nice.  Overall, very good service but not blow me away like I experienced at Tru. Onto the food, which was exquisite.  My favorite seafood standout was the unagi.  I've only had unagi in sushi before and this was a very unique preparation.  The best way to describe the texture is sort of like a pork belly.  It was just awesome.  It came with a hunk of trout, which was succulent and great as well.  I have to say I wasn't a fan of the lime foam, until I had it with a sip of the paired Riesling and then realized what they were going for.  The halibut was tasty as well.  I loved the rabbit but the star was really the antelope.  It was unreal.  The preparation was with some expresso, oats, and boudin noir.  It was perfectly medium rare and fabulous.  The T Block Pinot that was paired with the rabbit was out of this world yum.  I'm not usually a dessert person, but the banana dessert was so wonderfully yummy!  The chocolate cake was great as well but the banana stole the show.  Not a big fan of sweet dessert wines, but the LBV port (which I expected to be too sweet since it's a late bottle vintage) went very well with the chocolate cake.  Overall the food was outstanding and the wine pairings were very well matched and really brought out flavors in the courses. As an extra bonus adding to the experience, because let's be honest, you're not paying $850 for just food, you're paying for an experience, we ran into Charlie Trotter on the way out.  A staff member had gone out to get us a cab when he stopped us and said 'do you want a tour of the kitchen?'  Um, duh!  That was really cool and made the evening even better.  After the staff member finished the tour we ended up back by the foyer and Charlie asks 'how was it?'  Of course we told him it was very nice and thanked him, but he started up a conversation with us.  I told him I appreciated he used Broken Arrow Ranch meats because that's where we get our game.  He asked if I owned a restaurant and when I said no, we just order from there he seemed quite impressed.  I told him about a wild boar papperdelle we made with some boar from Broken Arrow and how it was from a Mario Batali cookbook.  He asked us to hold on and went into the back and brought us back his cookbook.  It was a hard cover, $50 cookbook that he gave to us.  He asked us to bring in what we make from it for him to try, lol.  Okay, so at this point we knew he was just being cordial but still, taking the time to speak to and get to know your customers is what separates a place like Trotters from the tons of other great restaurants in Chicago.  He certainly tried to elevate the evening for us and it was a successful attempt.",0.9995,0.745,0.212,0.043,0.5624254792826221
2012-04-15,4.0,"After hearing that Trotters was closing its doors in August a large group of friends decided we finally needed to dine here. I haven't been to the other ""high-end"" places like Alinea, Next, L20, or Moto so I don't have a similar comparison for this review.   We were on the top floor seated in kind of our own space and in the adjacent room there were 4 other parties.  Charlie was making the rounds in the adjacent room and even sat down at one of the tables for a bit.  We were hoping he would come our way but it never happened.  Guess we looked like the kids table (despite us all being in our 30s/early 40s) compared to the other patrons in our seating area.   I looked at the Grand Menu and Wine Pairings before we went and I was pretty excited about everything.  However the menu we had this weekend was not what was featured on the website - so my bubble deflated a little bit.  C'mon Charlie - for as much as you rake in, you could pay someone to keep your website updated.   For the drink - Over half our table got the wine paring along with the grand tasting menu.  I love wine so I wanted to see what would be paired with each course.   I read other Yelp reviews that said they would come around and top you off between courses and that happened a few times to me, but not everyone at the table (maybe b/c I was at the end of the table).  Some of the pours were quite small to be honest.  I felt like I was at a wine tasting rather than a dinner.  We started with champagne. Then we moved into a Reisling which was quite nice and then a White Bordeaux which wasn't my cup of tea.  For the Reds we started with a Pino Noir which I was surpised to enjoy (normally don't like that varietal) and then onto a Temparnillo which was great.  I don't recall the red after that, and then there were the dessert wines.  That was my only negative about the pairing (not a big fan of dessert wines).   Our last 3 courses were desserts/sweet so this made for a lot of sweetness at once, and I don't have a sweet tooth.  Several at our table didn't like the muscat or the port.  I drank them simply b/c ""when in Rome..."".   For the food - as I said I went in expecting a different tasting menu than we got, but I was hoping to see what they came up with.  The first 2 fish courses were great. The flavors  really popped and was exciting.  The 3rd fish course was a little more subtle, but still well received.    Then we moved into game.  I believe we had rabbit and antelope.  I've never had either and while they were good, I didn't enjoy these courses as I did the first 2-3.  Might be b/c I'm more of a fish person and my palette doesn't appreciate game.   As others have posted, there can be quite a lull between courses. This is where our friends who bought wine by the bottle came out ahead.  B/C those of us w/the pairing would be dry, the wait staff would come by the refill their glasses.   The small breads the staff provided between courses was great and the butter was to die for.  Personally I could have eaten the small pretzel rolls all evening w/that butter and died a happy woman.    The sweet courses were good, but after having 3 of them, combined with the dessert wines it was a little much for me. I would have preferred more fish or maybe some veggie courses and less dessert.   Service - They work in large teams so you're always being attended to.  Most everyone was very pleasant and incredibly accommodating. However our ""main"" waiter just felt flat.  I don't know - just a vibe.  He didn't describe the courses or wine with any personality. He didn't project his voice so it was hard for everyone at our table to hear (it was kinda loud where we were sitting). For one course he poured the wine and walked away and we had to get him to come back to tell us what we were drinking.  He didn't explain *why* this wine we were drinking was chosen for the course.  He just kinda gave facts off the bottle.  I don't know - I guess I expected more from him.   There *was* a great guy moving around our service area, I figure  he was the sommelier.  He dropped by a couple times to explain the wine and food pairing and he was awesome.  Enthusiastic, answered our questions, oozed personality.  We really liked him.  Figruing out our bill at the end was comical.  We had a mix of couples and singles and then they told us they only accepted 6 credit cards per bill so some of us had to double up (we were a large party).  Maybe we should have asked for separate checks at the start? Or maybe we're the anomoly where 1 person doesn't pick up the 4-figure tab :)  Guess I need to hang out w/wealthier people.   All in all I'm very happy I went.  Lived here a long time so had to go before its'gone.  But I'm sad I just can't give it 5 stars.

I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but 3 (plus some petite fours at end to take home) is a bit much.  Would've preferred 7 proteins and 1 dessert. * Bread - they bake their own breads and have some insanely good options.

When the 'retirement' was announced, we immediately made a reservation.  Three people, 6 pm, Friday night.  In a couple of months (see aforementioned cash hoarding). Finally, the much anticipated date arrives, and my friends and I meet there.  From the outside, Trotter's is pretty unassuming, but the bar/waiting area front room were lovely.  Someone came in immediately to greet me and take my coat - my companions arrived within minutes and were promptly seated. We had seats in the first room, and I have to admit - I thought it was a little dated.  It was all mauvey and drapey curtains and it reminded me slightly of a funeral parlor (Mr. Trotter, I'm sorry - I know you've got this whole fine dining thing down - please don't hate me).  We were given our menus and then the dance began. And I do mean dance.  This stuff is choreographed perfectly.  You end up with about 8 servers or so throughout the evening.  We all did the vegetarian menu, and two of us opted for the wine tasting.  Seven courses and seven wines involves a fair amount of explanation and I loved every single second of it. Yes, the courses are small.  Bigger than just a taste, but really just several bites each.  And that's what we expected.  If you want to walk out stuffed to the gills, this is not the place for you.  If you want to savor some of the most amazing flavors you will probably ever experience in your lifetime - well, hurry up, cause they won't be around much longer. I liked some courses more than others.  The first course (eggplant) was good, but not spectacular.  The second course - Fennel Custard with Marinated Cauliflower, Puy Lentils & Green Garlic Sorbet - holy shit.  No, really.  Out of this world.  I took the smallest bites I could to prolong the experience.  Ditto the Miso Tortellini with Red Cabbage, Turnip Confit & Ponzu.  I was quite literally stunned by it.  I was actually hoping one of my friends wouldn't like theirs so I could eat them.  Please please please please please release a cookbook with this recipe in it!  I know it won't be as good as it was when you made it, but damn I'd like to try.  The wines and desserts were out of this world, as well.  One thing I wasn't expecting, but which was a lovely surprise, was that they give you a copy of your menu, and then give you a tour of the kitchen (WOW), and the private event/television kitchen.  Charlie Trotter's is about the whole Experience (yes, with a capital E).  It's certainly not some place you'll go every weekend, but I found the whole thing very special and I am so glad we had the chance to go.

2012-03-25,4.0,"4 stars for superlative service, for 3 of the dishes off the grand menu that were deliciously inspired creations, including the most flavorful dessert I have ever eaten (toffee-glazed banana financier) and a stimulating non-alcoholic beverage pairing. Not 5 stars for the overly priced menu, the inconsistency of the savory dishes, the unnecessarily long time in between courses where we were plied with bread (presumably so we wouldn't leave feeling hungry?), and the valet service that should have been better played out at the end of the night.  When you pay $165 a person, you have certain expectations of the experience. They are very high expectations, and overall the experience was very good, but it didn't quite live up to other fine dining we've had, to the hype or the bill.  We chose the grand menu, which consisted of four savory courses and three sweet courses. (Technically, it was three savory dishes and the first dish, the ""amuse-bouche"".) While it was comically sparse on the large white plate, the amuse-bouche was very flavorful. An actual postage stamp-sized piece of poached halibut. The first two non-alcoholic beverage accompaniment were amazing - cold chamomile infused tea and a lemongrass and grapefruit mix with a really neat ice cube with sorrel and ginger. Clearly created by a highly trained food scientist and passionate chef pushing the limits. The rest were just so-so, nothing memorable. A fussy moment came during the last savory dish (venison and goat shoulder) when the waiter described what the chefs did to create this one small, translucent crunchy piece of meat on the plate. ""Slow roasted for hours, then frozen then sliced thin and quick fried."" Excuse my ignorance, but it didn't taste like anything. No flavor, just texture. I guess that's the downside to haute cuisine. It makes you feel kind of like an arse for paying someone to do all that to this little bit of food on the plate and you're left thinking, Huh? ""Hand picked by Sardinian virgins at midnight under a full moon...."" Overall, our service was outstanding. Our ""lead"" waiter, as I'll call him (because we were served by up to 5 different staffers) was engaged, funny but not hilarious, knowledgeable and courteous. We asked a lot of questions, and when we asked him something about an ingredient or process that he didn't know, he went directly to the kitchen and promptly returned with a detailed answer.  When my husband left to use the restroom, the staff replaced his napkin, refilled his wine glass and pulled out his chair for him upon his return. I was sitting where I could see the bathroom, and after every patron came out, a staffer went in to clean up and, I discovered later, fold the toilet paper into a point. And there were warm cloth towels in there. Classy! A down side to the experience was how long we waited in between courses - up to twenty minutes. We were seated in the first floor main dining room, and we could see the staff waiting in the hall by the kitchen holding dishes for up to two or three minutes before serving them. I understand plating everything at once, but when the coriander-encrusted quail is presented and it is luke warm, you have to wonder, Are those guys standing there waiting for the food to get cold? We weren't offered a kitchen tour. We got to keep our personalized menus as souvenirs, which is fun.  After three and a half hours dining, it ended on an oddly thoughtless note with the valet service. I'd like to suggest to Mr. Trotter and his house manager that you include the valet in the bill. Paying an additional fee after paying the mind-blowingly high bill seems tacky. And it's not hard to coordinate one of the wait staff to ask us before we finish if we used valet, then bring the car out front. We've seen it done at other places. Please don't make us wait 10 minutes for the car. And I completely respect valet dude's hustle - it's no joke to run five blocks to a car tucked somewhere hopefully legal in Lincoln Park.

2012-03-25,5.0,"We went here many years ago and returned to witness the ""farewell tour"" for this iconic restaurant.  Our expectations were exceeded.  You enter from street level up a staircase and find yourself in a bar area/waiting area.  We were seated promptly after arrival and ascended a steep staircase to the second floor which includes different dining areas (dining is also available on the first floor).  The decor was understated and the lighting was fine (not very bright, but not so  dark that we had to read the menus with a flashlight app on a smartphone).  Diners are presented with a menu that provides a choice of two tasting menus; one tasting menu was a vegetarian menu and the other was the so-called ""Grand Tasting"". I chose the Grand Tasting, which consists of several courses (all with small portions, but extremely well put-together and thought out) including a couple of seafood courses and a couple of meat courses (with three dessert courses).  The wine list is hefty. I simplified matters by choosing the wine pairing that paired various wines to each course.  Several small pours provided an enhanced dining experience.  Service was impeccable (of course, they had to explain what we were eating with each course), well-paced and not rushed at all (over 3 hours, but, we never thought that it lagged).",0.9292,0.928,0.072,0.0,0.4880904183535763
2012-03-23,4.0,"I'm slightly delayed since we went to Trotter's for valentine's day in February. It has always been on my list of places to try in Chicago and when news broke that they were closing shop in August I decided to act quickly. If I could afford more high end fancy dinners that equal the cost of rent I probably would try it more often. I enjoy the entire experience of ultra fine dining because you're there for more than just food, but also service, setting, special occasion, exclusivity, what have you. I enjoy trying the best to see what the elite in their field can produce - similar to attending a World Series or Rose Bowl. Part of the reason for my delay in writing the post is that I was disappointed in our overall Trotter experience. Some aspects were delicious and fantastic, but you need more than just a good course now and again to make a four hour dining experience remarkable. I can appreciate what the restaurant represents and how it started a revolution and set the standard for fine cuisine and service. The old house setting in the middle of lincoln park is classic and timeless. Menus from the most famous restaurants in the world line hallways and bathrooms, and the tables are well spaced to enjoy an intimate dinner without feeling abandoned in a field. But our disappointment came from the food as well as the service that did not seem to keep pace with other standouts like French Laundry, Alinea or L20. Not that we were in any rush but 45 minutes is a long time to wait to speak with the somelier to order wine. They made up for that with extra cheese courses and a dessert course, and the services or meals was very well orchestrated. However, there was an overall lack of urgency or sophistication that permeated - perhaps a talent loss due to the wind down. Whatever the reason, both Erica and I agreed it did not represent the five star service expected with five star pricing. The food component of the meal was very good though inconsistent with significant peaks and valleys. The Grand Menu has eight courses including three desserts, as well as an additional dessert course from the vegetarian menu and cheese course. About half the courses were fantastic and beautiful, and the other half interesting but not memorable. The presentation on all of the food was fantastic and each dish had a simple mission without any gimmicks. I will let the pictures speak for themselves, but our favorites include the venison loin, steamed skate wing and toffee-glazed banana financier. Even if I don't think our meal was ""worth"" the money, I'm glad to have experienced a culinary icon in Chicago and the standard for the country more than 20 years ago. We had a fun and romantic experience with decent service and some memorable dishes. I might not return before the doors close  but I will be sure to follow Charlie into his next kitchen adventure.",0.9986,0.755,0.207,0.038,0.4874566544566545
2012-03-22,3.0,"I'd been curious about the restaurant before and had a reservation made last year before canceling it.  I was moved to book a reservation here again after discovering that they were closing in August. Am I glad I came here (subtext: before they close)? Yes. Would I go back again? Probably not. I had the Grand menu at a 9 PM seating a month or so ago. Since I'm not a big wine drinker and heard great things about the juice pairing, I went that route. I really enjoyed the first 5 courses. The sashimi dish was a delight, the quail was well cooked if not super interesting, and the ""steak"" dish exceeded expectations. There were many combinations of flavors that I had never experienced before that worked together wonderfully. The presentations, for the most part, were very well done and photo-worthy. The juice pairings were awesome. I still think about the fennel-infused apple fondly. The 3 dessert courses is where my meal fell flat. The flavors were either too sweet or too sour or too rich or just not right somehow. I felt, very much, like the chef tried to be adventurous and unusual at the expense of actually making the dishes taste good. There was one juice pairing with these which I found interesting -- the combination of acai berry and some other stuff I can't remember had a distinctly chocolatey taste -- but ultimately it proved to be cloyingly rich and difficult to finish. I'm not sure if we were supposed to receive an amuse bouche, but it was mentioned during our kitchen tour, so maybe I got the shaft. Overall, actually, I got the impression that the kitchen wasn't fully coordinated with the wait staff. What we were served didn't fully match what the menu suggested, and often didn't match what was described by the servers.

Yes, it's somewhat hard to get a reservation here (e.g. my 10 PM reservation), so plan accordingly. I was seated upstairs and had the grand menu. I mostly thought it was fine/good. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think I was expecting a little bit more based on the reputation of the restaurant. The servers were good, but slightly stiff.

The food was outstanding.  High notes included buttermilk poached pheasant, roasted squab, slow roasted pork tenderloin and grilled venison. The servers were all very friendly and answered all of my questions. Desserts were great, and so was the wine.  We were stuffed after the meal, but were graciously offered a tour of the kitchen and the studio even though it was late.   Of course it was pricey ($700 for two of us, including 2 bottles of wine), it was a very memorable experience.",0.9741,0.864,0.121,0.015,0.6344871794871796
2012-03-11,2.0,"After being given a very generous package of gift certificates, I talked my extremely hesitant husband into going with me to Charlie Trotter's. We jumped on a reservation when it was announced that the restaurant will be closing in 6 months.   I was very curious to see what all the fuss was about, and whether the price of the experience was justified. Let me tell you that what came to mind for me was that this was a case of the Emperor not wearing any clothes, and few being willing to state that out loud. Given that our dinner was underwritten by my generous friend, I opted to try the wine pairing selection with my Grand Menu, and my husband tried the juice pairings with his Vegetable menu.  We went all out, so to speak. $195 for my menu, $150 for his, $125 for the wine pairings and $46 for the juice pairings. While the staff was extremely warm and friendly, the environment is staid, to the point of stuffiness.  In some cases it was difficult to understand the waitstaff due to foreign accents, a frustration when they were presenting a complex food dish or one of the wines from the pairing menu. As a result, half the time we weren't sure what we were eating.  And in spite of their charm, the waiters weren't always on the ball; after asking me about food allergies and food dislikes, to which I replied and rejected one of the dishes, they attempted to serve it to me anyways, like we'd never had the conversation. I was shocked, to be honest. They did replace the dish with something far more to my liking but it was a burp in what I expected to be a flawless experience. The food was beautifully presented. The tastes were nice, but not anything deserving of the praise I see here in Yelp or have heard in other reviews and contexts. Some of the combinations seemed weird for weird's sake - a chocolate cake served with parsnip sorbet.  It was interesting, but I am not sure it worked.  In my husband's Vegetable menu, some of the dishes were so subtle that they came across as bland and taste-less.  I will say that I did enjoy the wine pairings with my meal.  The juice pairings were a little odd, and one of them was undrinkable as it was so flowery tasting.  The wine pairing portions, like the food, were incredibly tiny and the menu felt extremely overpriced given the sips of wines you are given.  All in all, a disappointing experience for the time and money spent. Even with the hundreds of dollars in gift certificates, it was the single biggest restaurant bill for two persons I've experienced, and that's with only one adult drinking.  Had the experience lived up to the investment, I'd have written an entirely different review than this one.",0.987,0.834,0.115,0.051,0.6583423520923521

Trotters takes the cake for service.  The sommelier and all servers were fantastic.  As we were seated, we were greeted promptly and I was wished a happy birthday by 2 staffers.  I understand they probably have to do this but it seemed very sincere and it made me feel very special.  Also, the menu I got to take home had ""Happy Birthday Julie"" and the date on it. Great memento. Also, right away we were asked about allergies (standard) but also asked to look over the menu and if we didn't like an ingredient to let them know b/c they will substitute it for something else. It was all about us and I loved that.  I prefer Trotters for service b/c I felt like they were on our schedule.  The timing was impeccable.  It wasn't one dish immediately after the other. They gave us time to talk and appreciate our surroundings. At Alinea, we were definitely on their schedule and I understand this b/c they have 21 courses but twice while I was there they tried to take my plate before I was done. Tsk Tsk. At Trotters, they always asked if you were finished before taking your plate. I was at the latest seating (8:45 p.m.) and the crowd was lively in there, which I appreciated.  The gentlemen working our table were very professional but I also enjoyed that they talked to us and answered our questions genuinely.  At Alinea, it was very formal, too formal for me. Wine:  If you are debating ordering bottles of wine or the wine pairing, GET the wine pairings. Holy smokes...they are on point and as another yelper mentions, the pours are generous and they fill you up if you have finished your glass before you are done with the course.   Food:  It's beautiful and delicious.  Is it as creative as Alinea? No.  But it's damn good. At the end, we got a tour of the entire restaurant including the wine cellars where we saw a bottle from 1870. Cost $35K. Yikes! Javier (pronounced with a ""J"") gave us the tour and he was so down-to-earth and friendly.   It's sad that they are closing.

I'm a vegetarian, so I was looking forward to trying the vegetable tasting menu. The waiter was careful to explain that the dishes are vegetable focused, but not necessarily vegetarian. He said he would be sure to instruct the kitchen to prepare mine all-veg. How kind of him.  ...except that didn't happen. A few courses in, I noticed something smokey, something crunchy, something bacon-like in my supposedly vegetarian dish. Meat-eaters confirmed it was in fact bacon. Now, truth be told, I couldn't possibly have cared less, but there are plenty of vegetarians out there who take it much more seriously than I do and would have had every right to be upset. Plus, for a hundred dollar meal, it does seem like the kind of detail that should be taken care of.  The other nick in an otherwise stellar evening was the service. Not bad, just... odd. I think we may have had some trainees. There was a lot of staring at the plates while describing them, as in ""umm, there's some... sweet potato? Uhh, No, carrot... yeah, carrot."" That was when they bothered to explain the dishes at all. We were handed a few without comment, as well as multiple wine pairings that were poured and served unannounced.

2011-10-29,5.0,"Amazing! And I am not sure if that right word. We went to the restaurant on a Tuesday night for the first Kitchen Table seating. The whole evening was spectacular. The food was impeccable as well as the service and the kitchen staff was fantastic. We got to watch them prepare and inspect every dish that came off the line. It was incredible to see how they fuss over every dish to make sure that everything is just perfect. We ended up getting 17 courses which were all phenomenal. They started us off with 6 Asian dishes and then they went on to various light dishes, all of them amazing and paired very well with the white wine that we had brought. (Yes, you can bring your own wine, but you have to call them and tell them what you are bringing, they might veto your wine choices and you will also be charged a corkage fee) We then went into the red wine territory and again everything was just amazing! All of the dishes were well balanced, complex and interesting. This was my second time at Charlie Trotter's and they managed to surpass my already high expectations. They are an expensive restaurant, but this is the place that everybody should go to at least once in their lives. It is amazing, from the moment that you walk in everything is taken care of.

Now for the nitty gritty...It is a Prix Fixe menu with a vegetarian option. Each dish is exquisitely prepared, plated and presented.  The staff is very knowledgable and friendly without being snooty.  I think we had 9 courses because they added a few that were not on the menu. My favorite was the Hearts of Palm with an aged balsamic and mango  reduction...I can't remember exactly and it was something that was not on the menu.  We did not opt for the wine pairing but in retrospect I think we should have.  They were out of 2 of the wines by the glass that we wanted.   So why not 5 stars you ask?  The bar is set extremely high for me when you are paying almost $300 per person for a meal.  We had empty wine glasses for a little while...Okay, I'm changing it to 5 because I see that is just too picky of me!  We did get an awesome tour of the kitchen, wine cellar, studio house...the staff was great and I loved their team approach, we got a different artisan bread with each course, the flavors were out of this world, the gastronomy fusion was not excessive but existed...yea, 5 stars for sure.

We had our choice between a vegetarian and Grand Tasting Menu.  Of course we selected the Grand Tasting Menu.  One thing I regret very, very much is not saving the menu or sneaking a picture of each entree before I inhaled the amazing mixture of flavors and unique food combinations. The plates were flawless, the food was delicious- even some of the items that tasted odd were still fabulous.  They may have not been something I would eat every day or order ever again- but the experience was worth every bite. The service?  WOW.  The service is much more vivid to me more than the food!  Five years later I am still wishing I could find some place in Orlando that could use a napkin to wipe off the top of my Fiji water after refilling my glass from my first sip.   I am planning another trip to Chicago with my boyfriend and the first place we will be dining at is Charlie Trotters.  Many may be in shock with the price ranges of the menu from $165-$200+ or even $500+ per person for a kitchen table, etc....but after trying it once...the price will not even phase you anymore.  You will be made into a food snob and remember the service forever.

2011-06-06,5.0,"This was one of the top 5 meals of my life.  My wife and a group of 6 of our closest friends decided to splurge on dinner at the flagship restaurant in downtown Chicago.  Since we had about 8 people and it was a special occasion, they gave us a private table at the top of the stairs on the second floor.  It was beautiful and even our menus had been custom printed with a special message at the top acknowledging the occasion.  It was a nice touch and started the evening out perfectly.  Without hesitation, we took our seats and immediately dove right into the Grand Tasting Menu which had been selected ahead of time so that none of us would need to make any choices, except for what wine to drink.  Even then, that choice was not too difficult as we each chose to do the pre-selected wine parings to match each course.  It was a no brainer.  Here is a small snippet of our courses from the Grand Tasting Menu: -Japanese Kindai Blue Fin Tuna with Seawater & Shiso -Chilled Snow Lake Trout with Watercress, Sorrel, & California Crawfish -For Story Hill Farm Quail with Chorizo, Spring Onions, & Clover -Forty-Eight Hour Braised Short Ribs with Chanterelles & Fermented Black Garlic -Young Coconut Granite with Lychee & Cachaca Jelly -Michigan Raspberries with Angelica Ice Cream & Angel Food Tuile All of these dishes were cooked perfectly, executed perfectly, and look absolutely superb.  It was everything that I had pictured in my head and more.  In addition,  the service was impeccable, professional and welcoming.  We were treated like kings for 5 hours and the ladies even had escorts to the bathroom.  Its not everyday that you get to experience a meal like this and it was worth every penny.   To end our night, our head server lead us on a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar.  I actually got to see a $20,000 dollar Magnum of wine and he even let us go in and walk around.  I have no idea if this is the norm, but I was terrified as I walked through the cellar with my elbows snug against my sides so as not to knock over a $6000 bottle of Chateau Petrus.  It was amazing though to see it in person.   In the end, my experience at Charlie Trotters was superb.  From the artisan bread that was served with each course, to the impromptu cheese course that was added to the menu for us at the last minute, every moment was flawless and I will remember the meal until I am old and grey.",0.9882,0.854,0.123,0.023,0.5601020408163266

For fifty weeks a year, twice a week, he welcomes twenty high school students into his restaurant for his signature tasting menu for free of charge. I mean, he is essentially giving out thousands of dollars of food each week free of charge. I should also note I have heard of some other great philanthropic things he has done in the community. As a business and a community man I really respect Mr. Trotter. He actually came out and spoke with my students, and he actually treated them like adults. I loved that when one was speaking while he was he called them out on it. He can come off as a cocky man, however he has very high expectations of people and he included my students in that. The food was excellent, start to finish. Also, I know I shouldn't have liked it as much as I did, but the bread and butter might be the best thing I've ever had.  My only complaints would be that our menu was very fish heavy. While all the fish was enjoyable, I would have liked to try something else.

The portions were tiny, but after eight courses we were more than satisfied. We're usually red wine people, but we enjoyed even the white wines they chose for us because they complimented the courses they accompanied so well. As for the reds, we liked the 2005 Valpolicella Classico Superiore Bussola that came with the braised lamb shoulder so much, we had our wine dealer find some of it for us a few days later.

So we were sitting there till midnight before we even got to course #5.  What's even better is when I voiced my concerns, the wait staff gave a half-a** apology without even providing an explanation of what went wrong. What's even more degrading is that they attempted to give a free glass of wine to makeup for things, as if we were complaining to get perks from it!...and if a free glass of wine is suppose to make up for things.  An experience at a restaurant highly correlates to the worth. There are many other restaurants where one can find excellent service and food quality together.

The Som was the snootiest prick we have experienced and obviously did not know what the hell it was doing when he paired the wines. Our server was nice, but we learned after leaving that they are on salary (~$30K) and get no gratuity - so really have little incentive to serve.  They must not be allowed to taste the food very often as they could not answer some of our basic questions. We also learned that Trotter is not in the kitchen and it is all staffed by interns that want to learn how to cook....so we paid $600 to be served by !%#%! trainees!

2010-09-10,4.0,"Had dinner at Charlie Trotter's with three friends.  Three of us, including myself, opted for the Grand Menu while one ordered the Vegetarian Menu. First Course: Chinnok Salmon with Grapefruit & Chive Blossom.  A very good light start to the meal.  The grapefruit was a perfect way to refresh the palate for things to come. Second Course: Terrine of Skate Wing with Roasted Heirloom Tomato, Cucumber Sorbet & Arbequina Olive Oil.  I thought that the terrine was solid, but what really stood out was the Cucumber Sorbet which was combined with jalapenos.  With just a little bit of the sorbet on the edge of your spoon, the soothing taste of the cucumber immediately succumbed to a jolt from the jalapeno like a punch in the face...a good punch in the face!  That part of this dish was probably my single favorite taste from the evening. Third Course: Roulade of Four Story Hills Farm Poularde with Curried Prawns, Chrysanthemum & Cockscomb.  Very tasty small morsels of poularde, and the curried prawns were also very good.  The combination of these two items in a single dish was a little lost on me, but separately they were very good. Fourth Course: Grilled European Turbot with Caramelized Cauliflower, Black Olive & Grilled Kumamoto Oysters.  The turbot was just okay, but the grilled oysters were very good. Fifth Course: Elysian Fields Lamb with Crispy Buckwheat, Parsley Root & Sprouts.  This dish was essentially various parts of lamb, including sweetbreads, surrounding a mini-parsley and sprouts salad.  The lamb was good, but like the turbot, I didn't really find it particularly outstanding in any way. Sixth Course: Lychee Sorbet with Hibiscus & Candied Vanilla.  Very nice and refreshing taste and an excellent presentation.  The hibiscus came as a thin, round, gelatinous slice--almost like a piece of pepperoni. Seventh Course: Michigan Raspberries with Young Coconut & Green Peppercorn.  The raspberry and coconut combination worked out well.  The dish also included pieces of Japanese sponge cake. Eighth Course:  A third dessert!  Plantains with Milk Chocolate & Hemp Seed Ice Cream.  I was a little disappointed as the caramelized plantains came as thin strips--almost like mini-french fries.  The hemp seed ice cream was a welcome new taste (which gave me the munchies...just kidding) and the chocolate mousse was superb. SERVICE: The service at Charlie Trotter's was absolutely fantastic--very likely some of the best service I've yet to have at a restaurant.  Our server was at first very cordial and warmed up to be more informal as he got a feel for our table.  Water service was quite frequent.  Particular points I liked: First, when our plates were removed after each course, care was taken so that the two people taking the plates away moved simultaneously--almost like choreography.  Second, when a question was posed to the person refilling our water glass (who was not our particular server) about a dish, he was able to answer the question.  Having everyone on the dining room floor be invested in and knowledgeable about the food being served certainly separates stellar service from merely very good service.  Finally, after talking to the waiter about how happy we were with the wine that we picked, he removed the label and laminated it onto a Charlie Trotter's postcard for us to keep. OVERALL:  As for positives, the service, as I mentioned, is outstanding.  The wine list is extensive and well-stocked.  The presentation on each of the courses was exquisite. My biggest problem with my visit to Charlie Trotter's was the tasting menu:  Having the last three courses of an eight course tasting menu be desserts seems to be a poor design.  Also, the portions were a little too much on the small side.  I understand that it is a tasting menu, but if the diner does not have enough of the taste to capture its essence, then the whole effort is all for naught.  A prime example would be the lamb--instead of offering several diverse pea-sized morsels of different parts of the lamb, why not concentrate on one of the tastes and build a plate around it?  Finally, while I really enjoyed the Cucumber Sorbet and to a little lesser extent enjoyed the Poularde with Curried Prawns and Kumamoto Oysters, I cannot say that the tasting menu made enough of an impression on me to warrant a top shelf rating. The standard for a five-star restaurant is one that is worth making a special journey to get to--a distinction I've only awarded to two fine dining establishments, Masa and Zinc (with a custom-designed tasting menu).  A four-star restaurant is one that is worth making a slight detour to get to--perhaps an establishment that was already in a city you were visiting.  Would I make a trip back to Chicago solely for Charlie Trotter's?  I cannot say that I would.",0.9993,0.808,0.176,0.016,0.5018836032880978

2010-07-29,5.0,"I've wanted to visit Charlie Trotter's for about ten years now.  When I first wanted to go, it was generally considered the best, most creative restaurant in the city.  That is no longer the case, but it is still an excellent place to dine, putting out exquisitly crafted food with excellent service. A large part of why I finally went is that Charlie Trotter's has become a legend in Chicago culinary history.  He raised the bar here, giving Chicagoan foodies something to talk about locally.  More importantly in the long run, though, he inspired the people who worked for him to go out and try their own new concepts playing a critical role in getting Chicago dining up to a level that gets it regularly mentioned with New York and San Francisco as a center of dining excellence in the U.S. Now to my actual visit. I had the grand menu.  There were at least 9 courses - I kind of lost count.  Out of them 2 1/2 were surprisingly good.  That's not necessarily bad - I'm pretty hard to surprise.  And fine dining doesn't have to be surprisingly good.  It can just be excellently executed and served with appropriate levels of service.  All the dishes were excellently executed.  Service was near-perfect, with no misteps worth mentioning. The 2 1/2 I liked included an amazing squab dish served with a black sesame sauce.  It didn't sound exciting, but the flavors were clear and worked really well together with a pleasant lingering of cardamom at the end.  It was surprisingly delicious.  The second surprisingly good one was one of the dessert dishes, a coconut ice cream over ginger with dessicated raspberries and something else.  It sounded pretty ordinary when described, but was really excellent.  The 1/2 one I liked a lot was a lamb dish.  There were four main components to the dish, a well-roasted bit that was just boring, a sweatbread that I didn't mind (which says a lot, because I really dislike most sweetbreads), a bit of fat that I think was intentional but kind of strange, and then a really wonderful rare pieces of lamb intensely flavored.  On top of this was a crisp piece of ""lamb procuitto"" which was nice, and under it all some crisped buckwheat for texture.  The chocolate course was very refined but definitely overkill.  The fish dishes were nicely done, but not attention-grabbingly good. There were a few things I think should be improved.  The easiest and most important is that Trotter's needs to rethink their silverware.  They use the same spoon style for everything.  I'm really not snobbish about these things - except when using the wrong spoon actually makes it hard to eat a dish.  For the sorbet course, they spoon in question was bigger than the food, and so thick that it was nearly impossible to get the gelee off the bottom of the plate.  A smaller, finer spoon - a dessert spoon, for example - would have been far more appropriate. Additionally, the decor needs some help, both in style, which is quite dated, and in attention to detail.  Why, for example, were the counter-sunk finish nails on the trim not backfilled before being stained, leaving visible nail marks?  Details matter in more than just the food, after all. Finally, one other thing I noticed is that a significant number of the ... what to call them ... ""assistant waiters,"" maybe, were latino.  I mention this because in the restaurant industry there's been some discussion lately about how unbalanced the front vs. back of house staff makeup is in many restaurants.  A majority latino in the kitchen, a majority white in front-of-house in many places.  Part of this is language and cultural background, but some have argued that part of it is simply a lack of restaurants taking the time to do good training, preferring instead to just hire people who already have experience or formal education. It seemed to me that this was probably a conscious choice at Trotters.  No doubt if Charlie wanted to only hire culinary school graduates for all his positions, he could.  But it appears that his training program is more broad than just hiring well and being demanding in the kitchen.  And that's good to see, especially since the latin waiters were every bit as professional while managing to be more personable and less snooty-sounding. All-in-all, when the meal was good enough that I'm left only complaining about a bad spoon and improperly filled nails on the decor trim, a restaurant deserves five stars. I'm very glad I finally went to Charlie Trotter's, and I enjoyed the food and service and feel the price was appropriate for the food and reputation. That said, having experienced it once I don't feel I need to go back. Unles you want to pay ;-)",0.9994,0.734,0.213,0.053,0.5785585067106807

We arrived a little late for our 4:30pm reservation.  When we walked in, we were greeted by some of the staff in the foyer.  We then took a tour of the kitchen and the red wine cellar.  After the tours, we were then taken to our table.  It was in the same room where Chef Trotter would film his PBS show. We were treated to the grand menu.  While eating each tasting portion, there was either a front of house or back of house staff that would come and talk about what excellence meant to them and answer any questions the students had.  It was such a great experience for the students and for myself.  We were treated to an amazing meal.  The service was impeccable and the food divine.

It was amazing! We sat upstairs, and it felt like we had the whole loft to ourselves for quite a while, which was great because the staff was able to practically dote upon us. The food was unreal, and the drink pairings were fantastic. They answered all of our amateurish foodie questions, let us take all the pictures we wanted, got our menus signed (which we now have framed), and really took care of us. As we were leaving they gave us a tour of the kitchen and the private dining rooms and I am not sure that it could have gotten any better. My mom and I have now decided that we will go every time she visits. next time we want to sit in the kitchen.  The dishes were so thoughtful & provoking. It is my dream to be able to dine at places like that on a regular basis. Or at least more often than I get too now. Can't wait to do dine there again.",0.9771,0.843,0.138,0.019,0.4749592999592999

The staff was great they interacted and took care of our needs and were also very knowledgeable of the menu. What i really like was our server had a great attitude and carried on conversation with us throughout the evening.  So lets get into the food it was decent for the price. They offered only two courses one of which was the Grand Menu and the other a Vegetable menu. This made me happy cause it took care of my needs during the Lenten season. But with that said it was kinda boring and didn't have much flavor. The Grand menu was okay my dinner partner didn't complain but it was nothing mind blowing and the presentation of the dishes also kinda boring.  One of the highlights to the menu was that they offer not only a wine pairing to the menu but also a water pairing. This was interesting as who would have thought there was so many variations in water. This was a ""WOW"" as interesting...  Now the part that ruined the entire evening and the main reason we will not be returning or referring this location. When the bill came they automatically added an 18% gratitude to the bill. There were only 2 people on the bill. This was a huge surprise. As many of you know that read my reviews my partner and I eat out at many of the high end restaurants here in the city and we have eaten at all of the top. This is the 1st time a gratuity tax has ever been added to the bill.. I still cant over the fact that they did this.  So if you choice to go for a so-so dinner, at a large price then go ahead a try this place. They do have great service and the servers are very friendly and interact very well but I'm not sure its worth the 18%.

2010-01-03,2.0,"I spent 5 years in graduate school in the early oughts and always longed for the chance to eat at legendary Trotters. 5 years later I had the chance to come back when I am more experienced with fine dining and they are a more reasonable budgetary expense. I made a reservation before I even booked my flights and had my first ""memorable"" meal on 2010 at the legendary Charlie Trotters. What a serious disappointment! The 2 stars are granted for the service and two above average dishes out of the 8 course. The night we dined, the wind chill was -20. We walked in and were served first course - a barely seasoned raw oyster sitting on a pile of salt. I hadn't even warmed up before this dish was served. The next two dishes were light seafood related dishes that really left us unexcited. The first meat was a rabbit loin. This was the redeeming protein dish of the menu. The hamachi that followed was fishy. The pork loin was a good representative of using the animal with feet and tail included, but was overly salty without a demonstration of particularly appealing flavors. I was eating bread which was at least warm to try to fill up. And I still wasn't warm. Sure pork is red meat but lamb or beef or a soup or stew might have helped and truly been more ""seasonal"".  Then on to desert. It seemed a little out of proportion with 3 desserts listed on the menu and 5 proteins. The first dessert was maybe meant as a palate cleanser. Grapefruit sorbet - BRRRRR. Dessert number two was a warm date cake with yogurt sorbet. This was a highlight. But again, more freezing food? Is there a pastry chef back there? Then the final dessert designed to show off a chocolate acquired off of west africa (or was it south africa - that's what another waiter told the next table). Another frozen chocolate dessert with some chocolate flake, cookie crumbs and melted chocolate - and for chocolate lovers not very good. Thank goodness we got some $5 coffee to finish things off or I would never have never been warm enough to leave the building.  I live in San Francisco where the norm is locoregional seasonal menus. I understand that locoregional is limited in the dead of winter in the midwest but then I suggest cooking to the season. The artistry of this meal was lost on food that did not wow nor comfort us. Anyone can smear sauce on a plate. Our final tab neared $600 and we immediately tried to figure out if it was at all worth it. The Michelin Guide does not rate Chicago restaurants.

I was dining alone and was lucky enough to score a last minute reservation. The restaurant was located in what appeared to be a townhouse, but was elegantly furnished inside (more corporate than romantic, however). The business-suited servers provided impeccable service, and did not treat me, a lone diner, as a second class citizen. I much appreciated this. I opted for the Grand Degustation menu, with paired wine choices...this set me back three hours of my time (spent in pure culinary heaven) and over $325. It was well worth it. What was remarkable was the deft touch Chef Trotter had with his food...its flavor was accentuated but allowed to stand on its own without being drowned by heavy sauces and there was almost no butter or cream used!

Of course, we got two bottle of wine, each being over 200$, and the staff had the nerve to card both my finance and I. Its instering to me because I doubt little teenagers would order 200$ bottles of wine. Furthermore, they decided to give us to two courses complementary, which went unnoticed because we were so tipsy off wine and incredibly hungry!

2009-10-05,5.0,"This was our fist visit to Chicago.  My wife and I don't consider ourselves""foodies"", but we do appreciate fine dining.  We booked a table at Charlie Trotter's, on a friend's recommendation. Just a quick aside:  The night before our reservation, we felt like having steak for dinner and ate at David Burke's Primehouse - on the recommendation of our concierge.  The steak was ordinary at best, relatively unseasoned, and we left $390 lighter.   I knew that Trotter's was going to be expensive, and it was.  $720 including their 18% service charge.  I came across this website before our meal, and was bothered from some of the negative reviews that we might have a repeat of the Burke experience, but that wasn't the case.   Dinner lasted three hours.  We chose the ""grand"" menu with wine parings.  Like other posters have said, they are willing to have you pick and choose items from their vegetable menu if there's something you don't like.  This place is ALL about the food experience.  Servers are elegant, but not pompous.  The room is regal, but not ostentatious.  You knew you were eating in one of the highest end restaurants in the country, but it still had a ""down home"" feel to it (it's difficult to explain).  Every server knew every ingredient, wine, pairing, and reasoning behind each flavor combination. In a word:  Awesome.  Even though there were a couple of courses (sardine, octopus) that pushed me a little outside my comfort zone, every course was something special.  For those of you that said there wasn't enough to eat; you must be a 400lb linebacker and be accustomed to eating two chickens for dinner.  You will NOT leave the place hungry.  After dinner, we asked for a tour - our server was happy to oblige.   Without a doubt, Trotter's is in the top three dining experiences of our lives, and the most expensive - but with incredible value at the same time.  Highly recommended.",0.9888,0.814,0.141,0.044,0.5518636096413874

2009-09-13,5.0,"Charlie's was the definitive top chef of Chicago in the late 80s and 90s.  Every detail was impeccable, every morsel wonderful, every dish brilliant.  This was my favorite restaurant for quite some time, and has spawned some brilliant offshoots such as Homaro Cantu (Moto).  It was my opinion you couldn't do better in Chicago and barely anywhere else in the US. And that's still mostly there. BUT... my last few experiences have been hit-or-miss, and it seems to track with whether or not Chef Trotter is onsite that day.  And for the kind of money you are paying for his fare, I can't easily forgive an off meal.  One off dish in a tasting menu, sure, that has always been the nature of avant-garde cuisine.  But not a lackluster evening. I initially gave a 4 star rating because of this.  So when I moved it to 5 stars, I worried it was based on memory, passion, and my respect for Chef Trotter himself and fondness for his cuisine.  Does 5 star necessitate every bite be flawless, every trip?  Do we hold a place like Trotter's to more stringent standards because of - expectations? cost?  So, I am trying to be realistic and give you a review based on what you'll get now, not what my golden memories have.  (For goodness' sakes, I flew from New York City to propose to my girlfriend here; the next meal, Charlie, on a tour of this then-new cooking studio, was prodding me incessantly to get married there.  And I still resent her for not letting us go to the Gaja-paired Trotter's 10th anniversary dinner, which we had invites to attend.) Let me say this: when he is on, though, he is still *on*.  Impeccable service - every knife and fork aligned perfectly, wines decanted and at proper temperatures, dishes of sublime creative brilliance.  He also offers a vegetarian full tasting menu as well that in no way is lesser than the meat one (just different), and I frequently am torn between which of the two (or, sometimes, three) tasting menus for that evening.  I also used to dine there quite a bit, so the kitchen would often have ""a little extra something"" for us - which I really loved.  (Boy, did they do a number on us the night we got engaged!) Interestingly enough, I noticed that Gary Danko's in San Francisco seems to be staffed with about half Charlie Trotter's expats from the ""golden era,"" and I have found my meals at Danko's to be exquisite.  Chef Trotter demands excellence, but he gets it, and his people grow immeasurably for it. Practically: the first and second floors have radically different atmospheres.  The first floor is more closed and ""old-world"" - probably the ""grandparent"" feeling many other young reviewers have mentioned in scorn.  The second floor, being an open balcony, is much airier and fresh feeling; that's the aerie of the mid-30s executives and such.  I personally love that older, refined feeling from the first floor, but to each their own.  There are also many fewer tables downstairs so it's more private and secluded (and much quieter). In sum: If you have never gone, and are a fan of top-flight culinary encounters, you should consider it if it will not set you back too far monetarily.  It is still an amazing experience, and you are going to get excellent food - and, on the right days, brilliantly outstanding.  If you were an old fan of his, you can still go, but caveat emptor: some days, it used to be better.  Still, when he's on, he's one of the absolute best chefs in the city - and country.  I owe a lot of culinary influence to Chef Trotter and his restaurant, and my own cooking, and love of and passion for fine dining, would not be where it is today without him.",0.9977,0.828,0.147,0.025,0.5017854800322333

The food continues to be impressively creative, yet, and I don't know why, it's not memorable.  I have no recollection what I ate during either visit, which is odd.  The portions are small, but all together, perfectly adequate.  Complaints?  Several.  First, the menu described two deserts, yet they only provided one apiece and we had to share another. I didn't even notice it at the time, but this was strange.  Second, the menu did not show the price. Unnecessarily pretentious. Third, and most annoying of all, they added 17% to the bill as the tip, without asking. (There were just two of us). There was no option either.  This was added to the credit card slip.

I like souvenirs! -Very aware of food preference: they were happy to accommodate my cilantro aversion and offered to swap dishes between the veggie and main menus to create the diner's ideal menu. -Topping off wine- my wine was topped off without a fee.  I also noticed diner's with the wine paring's wine topped off often- rathe than a strict 3 oz pour. -Extra course- after our savory courses were over we were offered an option of an additional course before desserts started.  We had another course- which was not on the bill and one of the best! -Warm bread: fresh from the oven bread periodically during the meal. CONS: -Did not love the food- I just did not enjoy some of the flavor combinations (like ell and banana) and was not wowed by some of the courses.  I did love the veal and sweet breads though.  I have to wonder if it is just my palate- maybe it's not advanced enough for some of this? -Pricy: $160 each for the food (not including tax, tip, wine and coffee) I nkow its part of it, but I have had less expensive meals fine dining meals that I have enjoyed much more. -Crowded: I felt the tables were very close together we could hear all conversations around us. -Slow moving though the courses: 20 min between each course made the meal 4 hours long and made me impatient. Maybe I'm just not ladylike enough for meals like this. -Did not have a full bar: I was looking forward to my pre dinner martini, but champagne worked fine. Bottom line:  If you are a food fanatic I would recommend going to have ""done it"".  I will not be back, but am happy I went.",0.992,0.747,0.181,0.072,0.567361111111111

There another more detailed review from this day but I still thought I'd add my late review. This would a first for me for razor clams, oysters, lobster, sweet bread, and I'm sure some other things I dont remember now. I believe its an aquired taste and I havent and will not be acquiring a taste for those things, but it is a taste and the combinations of flavors and spices were perfect. A person would go to have an experience and it definitely is. The presentations were very creative, artistic, the table and room was where he taped his show and actually had a couple monitors that you could look at and watch the kitchen at work. A great touch. If they bring out the option that you didnt order, the waitress walks back to the kitchen and the sous chef(is that right) tells her its on the house and we see her come back. So I actually ended up being very very full, because i felt I needed to eat not only mine but my companions meal too, because of course she had never had those things either. I mean what would Charlie Trotter think if it came back half eaten, and he was there, I saw him in the monitor. anyway. if you want to experience something you can only experience in Chicago and very few other big cities. go. take your time. enjoy. bring some money.",0.9864,0.881,0.119,0.0,0.5032298752834466

They got every detail right from the moment we walked through the door. We were served complementary glasses of wine when we could not decide on a glass to have while we waited for our table to become available.

2009-04-10,3.0,"I went in with all the accolades in my head for years: one of the best restaurants in Chicago, the country, and the world. Sometimes that hype creates expectations so high that I leave disappointed. Of course it wasn't a bad meal by any stretch of the imagination, but it wasn't anything that special for me.  Cost to worth it rating: 2 (not counting French Laundry, most expensive meal I've had at $350/person including gratuity and wine pairing. Other meals for almost the half the price were better)  Highlights:  - Francisco: 5+ stars! He was our favorite part of our dining experience here by a mile. While other staff members at times made us feel second rate and not deserving of excellent service--possibly due to our age or apparent status--Francisco seemed to notice and went out of his way to pick up the slack and made us feel welcome and attended to. While talking to the hub, I mentioned I really liked this pinot and a few minutes later, Francisco magically appears to pour me a bit more, saying he knew I liked this wine. That is the high level of impressive experience I expected to encounter across the board.  - Kitchen tour: A few parties were being taken into the kitchen, while we just left our table unnoticed. Francisco caught us on the way out and asked if we'd like to see the kitchen AND the wine cellar. ""HECK yeah!"" thought my foodie wine self. :-D This turned into the best part of our dining experience. The kitchen was huge and the entire staff was amazing allowing us into their space and enthusiastically greeting us. Francisco showed us around, pointing out each station, etc. The wine cellar downstairs was wonderful as well, with a U-shaped room rack full of bottles, one being 35k. The hub got to ask the question we always wanted to: do you get insurance on those things? Yes is the answer for those we who were curious. 8-)  - Wine: liked the pairings (especially the pinot and shiraz) however at this level, I would have appreciated more descriptions about them besides the basic producer and varietal.  - Non-alcoholic beverage pairing: first time I've seen this one and it's a selection of unique juices. - Customization: it's a set tasting menu, but they are more than happy to accommodate any allergies or even dislikes. I dug that they were flexible and not adverse to changes. I don't care for lamb, but wouldn't have said anything unless our waiter had graciously left the door open to the possibility of change. The hub doesn't eat seafood and they didn't just give him a bunch of veggies--they substituted with chicken and steak which were more up his alley.  - Cuisine: being a rather traditional spot, I was surprised to encounter not just classic, but a few more interesting dishes with the chef dabbling in Japanese flavors like eel.  - Plating: attractive from the oyster in it's shell above a mound of salt to the thin small slices of sashimi propped looking like shark fins to the arc of sauce drizzling on top of morel mushrooms along the way ending by the slices of beef. Pics:  yelp.com/biz_photos/gk3p…  and  yelp.com/biz_photos/gk3p… - Silverware: first time I've seen standing up knives, instead of being laid on their side, they were designed for the blade to be parallel to the side walls. Pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/gk3p… Lowlights:  - Atmosphere: meant to be classic, but a bit grandparent's home for me from the chairs to the show platewear.  - Desserts: none were fabulous, however I appreciated them giving the hub and I different dishes increasing our sampling size.  - OMG factor (or lack thereof): besides being in the kitchen (for the historical purposes given the stature of the restaurant and chef), no part of the meal or dining experience whole excited me... and I can get awfully giddy about great food. - Service included: tips are discrenciary for a reason--the consumer gets to decide how much they want to contribute based on their level of datisfaction, but that is taken away here. No matter how you rate their service, there's an automatic addition. Come on, people. This isn't a big group of teens at TGIFridays that may stiff the server--this is a fine dining establishment where patrons know enough to tip based on their proficiency.  - No OpenTable points: you can reserve on OpenTable (one of my favorite sites ever), but they don't give you points for dining there. I know it's a popular restaurant but this is lame. All restaurants should give you credit for dining there. It's been on my list for years, so I'm glad I finally visited, but on my next trip to Chicago I'll probably try another establishment. Unless Trotter fills the restaurant with a bunch of Francisco-esque staff... then I'd be back. 8-)",0.999,0.784,0.172,0.044,0.5412195767195768

I would not recommended the wine pairing as I didn't like all of the wines nor do I think it's a good value. But if you want to try new wines go for it. I personally would just rather go with a Red I enjoy. Overall it was a good experience, and although the portions are small I left satisfied.

I got the chances to go to this resturant as a senior is high school. The restaurant has this wonderful program where any high school in CPS can call in an sign up a class to go to the resturant. The only requirements are that students must try everything that is served, must dress formal , and ask questions. We got a tour of the kitchen, wine cellar, and the dining room. We were then seated in our own private room. I was treated like a princess by the wait staff. No small detail was over looked. My water and juice glasses were never empty .I accidently dropped my napkin and not even two seconds later a new one was placed in my lap   For each course the chef that prepared it would come and talk and we would have to ask questions. The staff treated us like real paying customers. At the begining of the meal they asked about allegies and what one can't eat. My teacher is a vegan so her menu was from the vegetarian one. I on the other hand only eat seafood so mine menu completely differrent from my class mates.  We had a 7 course meal. The three greatest things there were the bread, the butter, and the desserts. The bread was so so good. The aroma got to you first and that first bite was unbeliavable. It was still warm a bit cruchy and soft. The only world to descrided the butter is sin. It was that amazing no other butter can come even close to this one. My friend finished three of the butter bowls by himself. The desserts where heavenly just thiking about it makes my mouth water.

One reason I was so looking forward to this meal was the dedicated vegetarian tasting menu.  I went vegetarian, my boyfriend went for the regular one, and we both loved our food and seeing what was served to each other, too!  I would say that 7 out of the 9 courses we had were amazing.  We went with the wine pairings, and had 8 separate glasses with our meal- one for each food course and two for the three dessert courses.  I think the masterful pairing of the wine with the food was the highlight of the meal- it was one of those experiences that really makes you realize what a difference a true sommelier can make.  Other than this, the bf and I both loved seeing different elements of our travels- halva from Jordan, a delicious Tokaji wine from Hungary- show up in this interesting meal in Chicago.  The service was also impeccable but never intrusive.  I am one of those people who loves to get an in-depth description of every course and glass of wine at a restaurant like this, and I wasn't disappointed. Taking the suggestion of other yelpers, I asked to see the kitchen and wine cellars after our meal.  This is definitely worth it!  I was so impressed by the cleanliness and action in the kitchen, and getting to see that famous $35,000 bottle of wine wasn't bad either.  Combined with the personalized menus and wine pairings list they send home with you, it was the perfect end to a delightful meal.",0.9957,0.809,0.191,0.0,0.630318138651472
2009-02-17,5.0,"The kitchen table for two for Valentine's Day. Perfect idea, wrong day.  We had a world-class dining experience at Charlie Trotter's on Valentine's Day. My wife is a gourmet cook who can taste every seasoning in every dish, and usually tell you both what it is and where it came from. So for Valentine's Day, I thought she'd enjoy sitting in the kitchen at Charlie Trotter's and watching all the kitchen action of this famous restaurant.  She loved it. A warning: The kitchen table is not for everyone. I would expect the majority of diners to not enjoy it. It's busy, crowded, and intense. They say they can seat six at their kitchen table-I can't imagine how crowded that would be. With only two of us, there was no privacy for our conversation, with 2-6 waitstaff constantly nearby waiting to pick up their dishes to take out to the dining room, or assembling bread plates, or pouring coffees. But, if you want a unique experience and the chance to see it all come together, it's great. It's exciting, it's informative, and it's pretty unique.  Chef Trotter and his Sous Chef chatted with us throughout the meal. All the staff was delightful and talkative when we initiated the conversation, circumspect when we didn't. It was interesting the way every single dish went from preparation, at stations throughout the kitchen, to the chef, then to the servers only after the chef personally checked out each dish and barked out which table it should go to. Hectic, but organized and loud. Everyone knew the chef's voice, and when he talked everyone listened, even from the far corners of the kitchen. People who have worked in kitchens would probably say, ""Yea, so what?"" But for us it was really interesting.  Charlie Trotter's has been on top for a long time, from ""Best Restaurant in the World"" by ""Wine Spectator"" in 1998, to more recently ""Best Wine Driven Restaurant in America by ""Wine Enthusiast"" in 2006. It keeps getting awards for its food and wine for good reason. OUR FOOD WAS AWESOME. We had a nine course meal, supplemented with eight wine pairings. Each dish was a delicious combination of tastes. For example, the Maine Day Boat Lobster tasted like any good lobster-no big deal. But with it was watermelon radish, small cubes of sweetbread, and small stalks of mizuna (a Japanese mustard green). Delicious. My favorite course was the steamed fresh water sturgeon (from the Columbia River, if you must know), with razor clams and a Kaffir lime emulsion. Damn, that was good. A close second was the Japanese hamachi (a yellowtail fish) with a thick sweet and spicy miso sauce.  There are already plenty of good photos of the food on Charlie Trotter's Yelp page, so I don't need to add more. I did add a picture of the view from the kitchen table to the top of my Yelp profile.  An additional advantage of being in the kitchen was being able to ask all the questions we wanted and getting immediate answers from the experts. What is amaranth? I just got that figured out and we moved on to kombu. After that I stopped asking about anything green, but did still want to know what and where the tahini was in the dessert (now I know - it's a Middle Eastern paste made from sesame seeds, part of the wafer). I could ask dumb questions all day, but some of the items even my wife and the waiter didn't know, so the cooks came over and explained. And explained well.  We did the wine pairing, which was a good decision. French, Australian, Spanish, and Italian wines, plus a great Hungarian Tokai with the second dessert. None were bad, and several were exceptional. All well complimented the food. The pours would never be considered generous, but having started with a kir and going through eight wines, I guess we needed to be paced.  Service was absolutely perfect. It was never interrupting or in-your-face. It was simply executed right at the right times, so that we often didn't notice. I don't know how many pieces of silverware they placed on our table throughout the meal, but I only once noticed it being done, when I moved my wine glass to the same spot a new knife was being placed. Our waiter could usually describe everything on our plates, but when he couldn't he calmly and professionally called in the cavalry.  My one complaint was that I felt rushed. We were told to expect a 2-3 hour experience. But our dishes kept coming in fairly rapid succession. There were few breaks to sit, savor, and soak in the atmosphere. Maybe it's because we were in the kitchen and they could see when we had no plates. But I think it was because it was Valentine's Day and they were so fully booked. Normally they get two turns from the kitchen table every evening. On V-Day they served from noon until 2:30am. We were in and out in just over two hours: I would have been happy to do four.  My suggestion - Don't go on Valentine's Day. And, yes, it is expensive. More than I've ever paid for two at any restaurant in Paris or New York.",0.9983,0.826,0.136,0.038,0.5340596150837115
2009-02-15,5.0,"Went to Charlie Trotter's for a Valentine's Day dinner and had a fantastic meal.  I do admit that I'm a little torn on the rating.  Trotter's is truly a top notch establishment, but it feels a little strange to give it the same rating as Alinea, Gary Danko and French Laundry.  It aspires to be in the same class as those places, but I think it falls a bit short.   However, since Trotter's is still so far ahead of 99.9% of the rest of the restaurants out there, I'm rounding a 4.5 up to 5 stars. One caveat, as I've said we went there for Valentine's Day and I know that we probably didn't get a chance to see them on their best night given the volume of people and the well-heeled culinary amateurs that come out of the woodwork on that day.  Despite that, they did well. Some highlights: - Had to wait for our table to open up, they were running 15-20 minutes behind  due to the V-day rush.  They provided free sparkling wine to all the couples waiting in the bar/waiting area.  Nice touch. - Francisco was assigned to our table, and did a great job.  Attentive without being intrusive, very knowledgeable and ultra-friendly.  Plus, he gave my girlfriend and I an extra glass of the Chassagne-Montrachet which gives him an ""A"" in my book! - I think doing the wine pairing is essential.  I was impressed by the way some of the wines changed character with the food.  At least two glasses were a little underwhelming when they were first poured, but when the course arrived, the wines just blossomed with structure and complexity.  The Chef and Sommelier are absolute artists. - Goes without saying that the food was excellent.  Innovative, good depth, complex but in a good way, great flavors and textures.   - Nice decor and ambiance.  It's very unassuming from the outside, but inside is upscale and comfortable - Good pace of service, with plenty of time to savor the wine between courses.  We were there almost 4 hours, it's an experience not just a meal. - The service was great.  Stemware and plates removed in a timely manner, glasses refilled without asking, plates and silver swiftly replaced, all without you ever being really aware of it.  As I said before, attentive and unobtrusive. - One quibble:  A couple of the servers who brought out plates were extremely English challenged.  Either they were so uncomfortable with their speaking that they didn't even try to describe the dish, or they were so unintelligible I couldn't understand a word they were saying.  I would say that for half the dishes, we had to wait until Francisco came by to get the lowdown on what we were eating.  That may have been a V-Day phenomenon due to the busy night (extra staff?), but a pretty lame thing to get wrong at a high-end place. - Nice kitchen and wine cellar tour at the end (at 1:45 in the morning no less!),  Again a nice touch.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend failed to create a diversion so I could snag that bottle of 1961 Chateau Mouton Rothschild.  I guess I'll forgive her.  This time. ;-)    Really stellar experience in how well they treat their customers from taking your coats to securing your ride home and everything in between. Highly recommended place.  Hard to not have a great experience here, and I'll likely come back at some point.",0.998,0.766,0.18,0.053,0.5531989247311829
2009-02-10,5.0,"I am a lucky girl, I got to enjoy Charlie Trotter's VIP style!! I used to work for a well known restaurant. My former employer happened to be friends with Mr. Trotter and chose his restaurant as the venue for our management team's holiday luncheon. I stepped out of my cab in front of the restaurant nestled on Armitage Avenue, there was a gentleman in black standing outside. I walked up and he ushered me towards the door where another man in black was waiting. He opened the door for me and I was greeted by another staff member that took my coat and Secret Santa gift. I'm not even sure where they were whisked away to. As I walked into the bar to greet my co-workers I was handed a glass of champagne. The waitstaff served us various passed hors d'oeuvres (sweet & sour miso with eel, radish with an oyster) while our group assembled.  Once everyone arrived we were greeted by Charlie himself and he shared some of his thoughts on food, excellence and anecdotes about my former employer. He then led us to the studio kitchen where his television show is taped. Charlie stood there to welcome us and greeted everyone personally.  We were seated and the table was set beautifully. I was totally and completely overwhelmed at this point, I was just a sponge taking this all in. Charlie said a few more words and then pointed to two TV monitors in the room that were broadcasting the kitchen. We could watch our meal being prepared while we were enjoying it. So awesome. We then began to meet all of the restaurant's chefs. For each course a different chef proceeded to come out to introduce/describe the course as it was being served. They also each discussed their idea of excellence. Once the chef finished their presentation, a sommelier introduced the accompanying libation. The service was like nothing else I've ever experienced. It was like a quiet army of servers in black storming the room and almost invisibly (and silently) setting dishes down, removing them, filling glasses, taking glasses. There was never a second where I needed anything. When I got up or sat down - someone was there to pull out my chair or seat me. Flawless. The food was beyond amazing. Each course was better than the next. I tried so many things that were new to me. It was just the ultimate food experience. I don't have the words do this food justice. We finished our meal, exchanged our gifts and our coats were brought to us. As we exited the building we were given gift bags that included a copy of our menu, an autographed cookbook and a bottle of sauce. Could this afternoon get any better? Yes. It did.  Charlie and his ENTIRE kitchen staff assembled themselves in a line right on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. They gave my former employer a chef's salute! We then got to meet all the people that made this fantastic, amazing meal for us and shake their hands. I can't even begin to count all the times I said ""Thank you"". It was just surreal. I was lucky to attend this VIP lunch and it is an experience I won't soon forget. Gosh, it's been 2 years and I can still remember it like yesterday.

2009-01-29,4.0,"My girlfriend and I decided to dine her during our girls only foodie weekend to Chicago. The food was delicious and the wine selection was unbelievable. I did find the sommelier a little intimidating and condescending but I do admit, I'm not as knowledgeable about wine as I am food.   My husband is the wino in the family so he usually does all the ordering. Without him, I was on my own and needed a little coaching. Despite this being the sommelier's primary job, he was not very helpful at all...isn't he supposed to ""educate"" us on wine and help us select the wine. Anyway, it is what it is. The meal was very tasty and you can taste the freshness of each ingredient. The biggest disappointment believe it or not was dessert. After a few bites of it, my girlfriend discovered a hair in her food. We summoned over the waiter and he immediately turned BRIGHT RED! He apologized quietly (the tables are really close together so I'm sure he didn't want to draw attention to the situation) and then the dish disappeared to the kitchen. We didn't expect anything but we were kind of disappointed that they didn't even offer to make another one or even credit the dessert from the bill. It was strange...but we chalked it up to them being super embarrassed about the situation.

2009-01-03,5.0,"Best meal of 2008 to slightly edge out Michael Mina in SF and Le Bernardin in NYC. My girlfriend and I were visiting from San Francisco and we absolutely fell in love with Trotter's.  The impeccable manners of the staff, the intimacy of the dining room, even the homage paid to Charlie from other chefs such as Ferran Adria in the men's room were all memorable.  My girlfriend doesn't eat red meat but she does eat chicken/fish and the kitchen was more than happy to blend the regular menu and the vegetarian menu to appease her sensibilities.  Quail with chorizo, spring onions and clover was a tasty course. Ditto for the grilled diver scallop with boudin, pig's tail and fennel. But the best dish was the rack of lamb with blue foot mushrooms and fermented black garlic.  The sommelier was a class act and the 1998 Bodegas Leda wine from Rioja was phenomenal. And for a great finishing act the staff provided us with copies of menus from our meal, which is about as classy as it gets.",0.9845,0.853,0.147,0.0,0.508440170940171

Even before entering the building, I knew we were in for a treat.  The valet service was better than any I have ever experienced.  The service was the absolute best. I literally almost started crying during one of the courses.  I had to tell my fiance to stop talking so I could savor the moment ,truly incredible tastes were flowing through my mouth. The $500 meal was well worth every penny , I do not know when we will come back but I sure can not wait.  In the mean time I will focus on cooking, reading, and learning all I can about culinary so next time I will truly enjoy the entire experience.",0.9608,0.808,0.168,0.024,0.5434027777777778
2009-01-02,5.0,"See profile site for full review with formatted pics. Going into my meal at Charlie Trotter's I can honestly say I didn't know what to expect.  As I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen in some time I certainly expected a good time, but despite Trotter being one of the most celebrated American Chefs of all time it seems as though many recent reviews have not been as wowed with the landmark restaurant in the same way as they are by Iconic restaurants like TFL or Jean-Georges, or even the local temples of Molecular Gastronomy like Alinea or Avenues.  Additionally, after having the most fantastic meal of my life at Alex in Vegas earlier this year I certainly didn't want to go in with expectations too high and end up diappointed.  Oh wait, did I say Alex was the most fantastic meal of my life.......make that second most fantastic.... Course two of the evening consisted of Maine Day Boat Lobster with Beets, Chestnut, and Bull's Blood and although each dish that followed was spectacular, this was without a doubt my favorite of the savories.  A perfectly butter poached lobster claw lied trisected on the plate interspersed with thinly sliced chestnuts, fine diced bulls blood beets, yellow beet juice, vanilla saffron cream, and heirloom red beet reduction.  Somewhat salty, mostly sweet, light and fresh in every way - quite possibly the best lobster dish yet to grace my palate and certainly as good as the blue lobster at Alex and Ducasse's famous Lobster Au Curry....simply breathtaking. Course three was another winner and possibly the most ""complex"" of the evening's dishes - Poached Pennsylvania Duck Egg with Perigord Black Truffle, Torpedo Onion, Parsley.  A 14 hour poached Duck Egg was served next to a Vidalia Onion chip and literally covered with shaved Black Truffle and a reduction of torpedo onion with a drizzle of parsley broth.  Multiple textures, multiple flavors, both potent and subtle with basenotes of taste from the onion and topnotes of aroma provided by the truffle - a true masterpiece of composition. Honey Crisp Apples with Cider Granite and Ginger Jelly was an apple served in no less than 5 different ways - from flash fried over a sweetened semifreddo to an unadourned finely chopped slice over a spicey bread pudding, and finally a pairing of spicey icey cider granite and a ginger jelly compote - a true work of art and amongst the best desserts I've ever experienced....yet not even the best dessert of the meal.... Black Mission Figs with Shaved Fruit Cake, Marcona Almonds, Pedro Ximenez, Proscuitto, and Bacon Fat - possibly the single most impressive combination of unexpected flavors yet to grace my palate.  Essentially the dish was a piece of nutty fruit cake topped with Raw Cows Milk Icecream, chopped almonds, fresh figs, and a slice of Proscuitto that was then topped tableside with a reduction of sherry and bacon fat.  Sweet, savory, crunchy, spongey.....nearly indescribable.....possibly perfection. After completing this phenomenal dish our server arrived to ask us if there was anything else they could do for us.  Jokingly I suggested another half-dozen servings of the dessert and much to our surprise we were met with the response - ""well, I think we could do another one.""  When I stated I was joking she quickly quipped ""I'm not"" and disappeared with a smile, returning less than 10 minutes later with another more substantial portion of the figs and fruit cake concoction.  Along with this dish we were served a tray of 5 mignardises - a passionfruit jelly, a hazelnut ""nutella cup,"" an ""after eight"" mint, a cranberry nut nougat, and an incredibly creamy caramel - and the bill. With the bill settled we prepared for our departure and as a final treat were offered a tour of the kitchen, the display kitchen, and the wine cellar as well as complimentary copies of the menu as take home souvenirs.  All throughout the tour the staff, from server to chef to dishwasher, was notably smiling and working in flawlessly clean and gorgeous surroundings.  Nothing appeared overly stuffy, nothing extremely pretentious, everything simply gracious and wonderful. Without overstating I can absolutely say that my trip to Charlie Trotter's on 12/30/08 was the best overall dining experience of my life and although not every dish was ""perfect,"" the meal was as close to perfection as one should ever expect.  Flawless service, immaculate presentation, progressive flavors and wonderful innovation.....when is Michelin coming to Chicago so Trotter can get the same respect as that lavished on Keller and others?",0.9996,0.754,0.229,0.017,0.5338266178266178

Overall, the food and service was excellent, but based on our experiences at other fine dining institutions around the US Charlie Trotters was a sub-par for the $700+ price-tag for 2 people. The good: - excellent service (similar to the butler from ""Mr Deeds""....the staff is always there) - Food:  while my wife and I prefer a more french/asian fusion we really enjoyed the bulk of the tasting menu for the night.  The staff was extremely accommodating if we had requests to change any of the menu items. The bad: - wine pairing:  we opted for the $100/person pairing, not the $250.  The dessert wine pairing was poorly conceived and often times the wine was poured so far in advance of the food showing up that it really wasn't a pairing. - wine list:  this is more a an annoyance that I seem to have everywhere but why do most fine dining establishments find the need to list every wine ever created.  Really...slim it down - ambience: the restaurant is really crowded and it's hard to have an intimate conversation.  There was even a couple next to us who answered and then continued to speak on his cell phone.   It was a nice experience but we are unlikely to return.",0.9658,0.84,0.122,0.038,0.5468888888888889

These were the words bestowed upon me.  Let me warn you for those of the faint of wallet, save up, sell a kidney, eBay your first born.  I've been to hyped up restaurants (Nobu in San Diego, Mesa Grill in NYC) before and it just didn't live up to expectations.  That alone can kill off your virgin perception.  I went into this place doing my best to kill of the critics, drown their voices, and let my inner foodie reborn.  It's time to eat.   Portion control so as to keep them wanting more - I get it!  Reminds me of a beautiful woman who just whispers her breath on the back of your neck.  You want more. Colorado Lamb, Prawns, a slew of desserts, trout, yadda yadda... Pair up funky flavors and marry them like Anna Nicole Skank with old billionaire.  Why?  Because you can.  Most fail, but Charlie Trotter delivers.  Who knew?  Tequila sorbet?  Gadzooks! What was ordered: Tasting Menu with Wine Pairing (not the Grand Wine Pairing which can set you back an add'l $100).  Too many to mention and they change out the menu frequently: highlights, Colorado Lamb, Prawns, Trout with roe. Price: For 3 of us, over $800.  My 8 course ""dining experience"" set me back $400.  For out of towners, tax here is higher than in CA and they already include gratuity.  They have a few bottles that are $35,000! Insight: G'dammit, Charlie!  I fricken get it.  Why do you have to be such a culinary badass.  Have you ever seen that scene in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"", where Oscar nominated actor Johnny Depp, upon eating the finest pork dish he ever had said that he would kill the chef because it was too good.  He must restore balance in the universe.  Lucky for you, I am a pacificist and am not a caricature that is Johnny Depp.  Everyone else, ask the wait staff if you can tour the kitchen.  We did, cool dude.  I'm sure they'll let you do that when it's closer to closing time.",0.9024,0.851,0.085,0.063,0.43512544802867387
2008-10-21,5.0,"From the moment I stepped out of my cab and placed my hand into the receiving hand of the Trotter's cab greeter, I knew the service would live up to what I've heard.  I've heard about Trotter's from friends for a few years now and I knew when I went to Chicago, I HAD to check it out. I booked my reservation two weeks prior and the only time I could get was 930 p.m....which really was 730 p.m. west coast time, and the perfect time for dinner.  Since my friend and I had plans to party in Lincoln Park after, we told the waitress that we needed to step things up. Afterall I was dining with my coworker and bff, so we didn't need time to chat.  It's true about the Fiji water...they refill your glass constantly and they carry the Fiji water in this perfectly sized silver container...The servers were really attentive and polite. The service actually reminded me of The French Laundry.  It's sorta quiet and hush hush inside and they had two menu options. The grand tasting menu for $165 and the vegetarian for $135. I'm a huge meat eater, but I saw that they had soups on the menu for the vegetarian and I know that the best way to test one's cooking abilities is to try their soups.  Trotter's artichoke soup with spun honey was insanely AMAZING and by far the stand out dish of the night.  I was sorta worried that ordering a vegetarian menu would leave me hungry, but after the fifth course came out (potatoes) I could barely eat my three dessert courses.  We were in a time crunch at that point, so we had 6 desserts on the table at the same time and took bites from each. The sorbets were good ( I had concord grape) and my chocolate dessert was delicious.  As for the bill, I knew it would be expensive. We shared a relatively cheap $55 bottle of wine between us and I think my portion came out to $240ish....",0.992,0.851,0.139,0.01,0.5600694444444444

Some of the courses were truly wonderful -- unusual taste combinations that were delightful -- a spicy soup with fresh wintergreen (or was it spearmint? anyway, tasty), and yummy things done with mushrooms and potatoes. But on the down side, it felt kinda Disneyfied. The tag team wait staff approach looked busy and efficient, but it also felt kind of impersonal. I asked for a second piece of bread, and the waitress smiled and said I'll get that for you...then it never came. Maybe she just had other tables to deal with, and I know i shouldn't be filling up on bread, but I think two rolls with a meal is reasonable...right? With flavors as intense as they are, I really felt like I needed something more in my stomach. (yes, this is the ""I didn't get my second piece of bread revenge review, you have been warned.)  I had the basic wine accompaniment, which was actually a great bargain. Seven or eight small glasses of wine to accompany your courses,  Only problem was, it was too much alcohol in proportion to the food. I gave away my last glass of wine, and still left there mighty tipsy. So on balance, a nice experience, but not super-special.

2008-10-07,4.0,"On my recent trip to Chicago, I had Charlie Trotter's on my to-do list. The restaurant is housed in a charming garden entrance with a modest yet elegant entrance bar that only seats a few people. Chef Charlie must run a real tight ship because the hosts were engagingly friendly but seemed a bit unsettled as if the restaurant was still in previews. All in all, it was a solid dining experience. Although, there were a few service faux pas. First of all, they served us FIJI water, albeit in a silver container. I mean really, one doesn't go to one of Restaurant Magazine's Top 50 Restaurants in The World and be served water you could buy at a 7-11. Also, when my wine arrived, the sommelier took a sip to test it, but didn't give me the courtesy to sip the wine first as well. He just poured me a full glass. A big no-no. I found the servers to be a little disheveled and clumsy at first. Bread plates laid empty for too long. But then the food arrived and things got much better. The large wine list had a nice selection of reasonably priced labels but I decided to order by the glass because my friend was not drinking. I enjoyed a Pinot Gris and a very good Barbaresco later in the meal. We each ordered The Grand Menu and it was fantastic. Japanese Kindai Bluefin Tuna melted in the mouth. The Lake Trout with Roe, Watercress and Crayfish was a smart dish. Four Story Hill Farm Quail with Spring Onions, chanterelles and chorizo met my palate with a savoriness which was a delight. The Nantucket Bay Scallop was too large to be called a bay scallop but it was cooked perfectly and had a sweetness expected from those waters. The Forty-Eight hour braised short ribs with chive blossoms were the highlight of the night. 3 Star Michelin all the way.

2008-09-04,5.0,"Couldn't have asked for anything more. Amazing restaurant that really doesn't feel like a restaurant at all. Its a rather small quiet room with about 8 tables and about twice as many servers. There is an upstairs as well, but when we were there it was empty.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, was incredibly friendly, helpful, and patient. Its obvious that the staff takes their jobs very seriously and feel honored to work at a place like Charlie Trotters.  The entire experience is about as lavish as you could imagine. The tiniest details are taken into consideration. Let me provide several examples. 1. Our cab arrived at the restaurant and a man dressed in a suit literally came running to hold the door and greet us upon arrival.  2. He asked for our names for the reservation (which you have to make 6-8 weeks in advance BTW) and passed the information forward to the host. At which point we were greeted with a Happy Anniversary and welcome from at least 4 or 5 staff members within the 20 steps from the door to our table.  3. The lobby/waiting area/bar is a small square room with a very high ceiling that looks up to the second level of the dining room. Very soft music was playing and their were massive floral arrangements in the corners of the room.There were also 4 bar stools at the bar, which I wasn't really sure of their purpose since Charlie's doesn't allow walk-ins and I could never imagine your table not being ready when you arrive since your reservation actually guarantees your table with a nice $200 cancellation fee. 4. The menus are custom made just for your dinner. Ours said Happy Second Wedding Anniversary. You also get to keep them and they give them to you in a large envelope at the end of the night. 5. They will customize the menu to your exact specifications. I have never been asked so many questions about allergies, foods we like/dislike, etc... at a restaurant before. They than take your comments and adjust the menu to your exact desires, which is an experience I have never seen before. The end result is dish after dish prepared as if you had your own private 4 star chef. 6. Service service service. The smallest little details like forks, spoons, knives, glasses, plates, and napkins are swapped out at a moments notice all night long. The staff is so on the ball, its as if they are reading your mind. I placed my napkin on the table for no longer then 30 seconds to talk to my wife and I look back and fresh linen napkin has been placed there. Trying to tell who was a server, host, busser was impossible as everyone was doing every job basically. Everything came in and out with at least 2 people assisting, so transitions between courses were done in a matter of seconds. I think we had 6 different people introduce the dishes to us, almost as if everyone was getting practice.  7. The wines were introduced with a little background, description of the character of the wine, and served in a wide variety of different glasses to perfectly match the associated wine. 8. They take you through the kitchen when you are finished and every chef in the back greets you and one of the chefs personally takes you on a tour and answers any questions you have. The kitchen is tiny and very hot, but incredibly impressive with the absolute top end stoves, pans, pots... you could every imagine. On a different note, lets clear the cost question out for anyone wondering. Its expensive. Really really expensive. Based on the current menu, there is no way for 2 people to dine for less than $320. My wife and I selected the Vegetable menu and the less expensive wine accompaniment menu, and it cost $620, which included an 18% gratuity already. I added an extra tip and walked out for 650. That's more than triple the most expensive meal I had ever had before and I will say that Trotters will be limited to a once a year event for me. Ok, now onto the food. I have read some of the negative reviews about the food here on Yelp and to be honest it seems like people were truly upset by the price, not the food, but decided to vent their frustrations in an attack instead. I can't imagine having a bad experience here with the food since it was simply outstanding.  Each course it prepared like a work of art and is delivered with much pomp and circumstance. 2 servers rush out and deliver the food, one explains the dish in detail and sometimes delivers an accompanying part of the course such as a sauce that is poured on by hand at the table in front of you.  The courses represent such a wide variety of techniques and flavors its really difficult to describe them. There is a lot of experimenting with flavors I never would have thought to put together like thai curry, honey, jasmine tea in one soup dish we had. Which was phenomenal btw. Also, since the menu changes so often, describing the dishes might be a waste, since visiting even a couple weeks from now may yield a completely different lineup. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",0.9935,0.83,0.107,0.063,0.5197867189069721

(So excited!) The service was excellent--the staff was extremely attentive, down to showing me the restroom before I could actually ask (I'd just stood up, and the server already knew what I was looking for). I'd say about half of the staff described the food well as it came out, and half only gave a cursory explanation (given the nature of the tastings, the more thorough explanations were helpful). Courses were perfectly timed, and I left feeling full but not stuffed. When we left, one staff member asked if we'd like to see the kitchen, and we were treated to a short tour of the kitchen, show kitchen (they tape a PBS show in there), and wine cellar. Outside the restaurant, the atmosphere is really cute, with a cottage feel, and I like that indoors consists of many rooms with wood floors. The furniture is a bit dated though, and I think the average age tonight was around 45 (at 27, I definitely looked like the youngest person in our room). They really should change the upholstery. The servers were quite accommodating about customizing the tasting menu, and I switched out two of the menu's courses for other options because I'm not a fan of coconut and wanted something with chocolate. Given all the hype and Charlie's reputation, I wanted to be totally wowed by the food, but to be honest, not every dish was amazing. I'd say 75% of the menu was fantastic, and the remaining 25% was mediocre, though the presentation for every dish was impeccable. A couple of the combinations were totally surprising, particularly because they were unexpected but worked--it would have been fun if more dishes had that ""wow"" moment. I knew it was going to be expensive, but both my friend and I got a little sticker shock (and that even though I didn't pay): $434 for two people without wine (unfortunately wine is something I just haven't learned to appreciate very well).

2008-08-05,5.0,"Nine years ago I learned of the Holy Grail of dining that is Charlie Trotter's.  And for nine years I tried my darndest to get there, but was barred for one reason or another (usually it was because I was poor or my friends were).  I obsessed about this place - I read articles, followed blogs, strode slowly by the building craning my neck just to try to see in.  Then I heard a rumor that he might close up shop and either retire or open another restaurant in another country.  My panic was palpable.  I would just die if I never got to go!  The worst irony was when I started dating Andy M.  Andy is what you nicely call a ""picky eater"".  He was terribly wary of my description of this place and how there was no ""menu"", just whatever Charlie decided to make that day, with the certainty of offering many hated vegetables and the worst offender - seafood.  However, after a year of my dropping random information into conversations ""you know Charlie won ten James Beard Foundation awards"" and ""Emeril says Charlie Trotter is one of his favourite chefs ever"", one day completely out of the blue he says ""OK, I will go with you and try it.""  After I picked my jaw up off the floor I ran to make a reservation before he could change his mind. I was so excited the night we went - I was jittery and lightheaded walking up the steps to this place I had so often passed by, into the clean, cool, neo-classic entryway.  The staff all wore black suits and everyone smiled and welcomed us.  We were brought up to the second floor where I was seated so I could look over the balcony.  It was very posh, subdued and felt so very, very money.  We were presented with a massive tome of a wine list and I made sure to look up the Titanic wine I had always heard he had in his collection.  And there it was!  $12,000!  We laughed and debated about whether a wine that expensive should even be drunk.  I was terribly impressed when Andy admitted his hatred of seafood and the server told him that if he didn't like it another dish would be made just for him!  I think that was when Andy decided to let many pre-conceived notions go and just let Charlie wow him with his abilities. We selected the Grand Menu and a rather cheap bottle of wine (an Oregon Pinot Noir for $35).  The Grand Menu consisted of: -Japanese Kindai Bluefin Tuna with Wasabi -Chilled Snow Lake Trout with Watercress, Sorrel, and California Crayfish -Four Story Hill Farm Quail with Chorizo, Spring Onions and Clover -Grilled Diver Scallop with Boudin, Pig's Tail and Pickled Fennel -Forty-eight hour braised Short Rib with Chanterelles and fermented Black Garlic -Young Coconut Granite with Lychee and Cachaca Jelly -Michigan Raspberries with Angelica Ice Cream and Angel Food Tuile -Stewed Rhubarb with White Chocolate Yoghurt and Coriander Shortbread -Milk Chocolate Semifreddo with Carrot, Star Anise and Red Wine And an Olive Oil Ice Cream which was not listed on the menu, paired with a Chocolate Nut Panna Cotta. My favourites by far were the Tuna, the Scallop, and the Olive Oil Ice Cream.  Even with bread constantly offered, this was just enough food.  You did not end up hungry or stuffed.   The staff was incredible - so professional, quiet and with excellent precision.  They paid attention but did not hover.  When Andy got up to use the restroom, one server directed him towards it, another came over and brushed the tablecloth and another replaced the napkin with a new one.  Dishes came out perfectly timed and beautifully presented.  Wine and water never were allowed to run out. It was run like a very well-oiled machine.  The gratuity was included in the bill, which made sense seeing as how we didn't have an assigned server - we had no fewer than 12 different people attending to us throughout the night.  How else would you tip each one of them? Finally, we were presented with copies of our menu and given a tour of the kitchen.  I was glad we didn't opt to sit at the kitchen table, as it seemed cramped, hot and too loud.  Besides, the tour group stood right between the table and the kitchen, which had to get annoying after awhile.  Plus Charlie wasn't even there that night, so what is the point!   So now I am so happy for my experience, so happy I have a more open minded foodie boyfriend, and so happy my dream was finally able to come true.  This is a once in a lifetime experience, and I urge everyone to go once.  It is worth every penny spent.  But now I have a different problem.  What restaurant do I obsess about for the next nine years?",0.9927,0.79,0.127,0.084,0.5830205828122494

2008-08-02,5.0,"Before I give you my two cents on Charlie Trotter's let me set the scene of how this evening came about.    Carolynne R. and I have been together over three years.  As long as I have known her she has been telling me how much she really wanted to go to Trotter's.  She was up front about the type of establishment this was and how much it cost.  In the great words of Roger Miller ""I'm a man of means by no means"", but we decided in Lieu of Birthday presents and Birthday diners for each other, we would pool our resources and give Charlie Trotter's a try.   Since Carolynne has been put through over three years of baseball games, hockey games and and concerts that have probably bored her to tears, I figured that this would be a great way to make all of that up to her.    The staff welcomed us with open arms and pampered us like I have never experienced before.  The restaurant is beautiful and elegant.  The staff could not have been more courteous and went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed every aspect of the evening.   The food:  I have to preface this review by saying that I'm a very simple guy when it comes to food.  My ideal dinner is a Steak the size of a football and a baked potato the size of my head.  And I would rather walk through hell in a gasoline suit than eat fish in any form.  Trotter's offers two different menu's.  One menu is a Vegetarian menu, and the other is called the Grand menu which includes the Fish and meat courses.    Before you order the staff asks you if you have any allergies or food preferences. I told one of our waiters that I do not like fish, but if I can't enjoy fish from Charlie Trotter's, I will probably never like it.  In other words, I challenged them.  To my surprise he told me that if I didn't like any of the fish courses that they would be happy to make me something else.  I was quite impressed by that.    Our first course was a bluefin Tuna with Wasabi.  To my surprise I really enjoyed it.  The second course was a lake Trout dish which which was wonderful.  I walked into this joint being the biggest fish hater on the planet, and ended up wanting to lick the plate of two fish courses that were served.    The other courses included a Quail dish, Grilled Scallop with Pig's tail and the best course was the braised short Rib that had me drooling.    The deserts were mouth watering as well. They served a Coconut Jelly, and a Venezuelan Chocolate cake.   For a guy who had never been to a establishment like this before, I came away quite impressed.  The staff was great, the food was wonderful and everybody there went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed ourselves.    I really wanted to make this a wonderful night for Carolynne.  I wanted to make sure that it was everything that she had hoped for.  We have been through a lot in our three plus years together.  She has put up with me and my drunk friends in the left field bleachers at Wrigley, my football games on Sunday's and has never complained once.  She is the most wonderful woman a guy could wish for.  And I'm Grateful for all the people at Trotter's who helped make this a wonderful evening.  Happy Birthday Beautiful.",0.9993,0.733,0.231,0.036,0.6492711370262391
2008-06-28,4.0,"If you know anything about the Chicago scene or fine dining anywhere, the ""Trotter"" name precedes itself.  I didn't, and it was only upon a friend's recommendation (""you've GOT to go to CT..."") that brought me and my wife to this landmark restaurant in the Windy City in June.   My friend Paul had warned me that I needed to make a reservation well in advance.  It appears that times are rough for everyone, incld. CT: I had to change my reservation a couple of times, and both times, within a week of the date, they were able to accommodate (not that I'm complaining).  We were greeted and seated promptly and courteously - while not completely packed, the place was hopping all night.  I'd advised it was our anniversary, and the menus, which were ""customized"" for us and brought in a nice envelope after we ordered, show they've done this sort of thing before.  I was also pleased that they gave you a choice of bottled water (Fuji for the non-gas) with no extra charge - but I suppose that's not unusual given their price structure.  One weird thing: no music all night - quite unusual.  While I didn't miss it entirely, and would far prefer silence to what could be intrusive sounds, my preference would have been to have something classy-classical or a quietly elegant jazzy in the background.   Talking about price... CT has a choice of 2 tasting menus: the ""grand"" ($135?) or the vegetarian ($125) (there's also a Kitchen Table menu for around $200, I think, and only if you have 4 or more people will they let you reserve that).  So this is not exactly ""blue-collar"", but I understand there's ""worse"" even just around the corner in the Lincoln Park area.  For wine, they have two different wine flights as accompaniment: $100 for the ""pedestrian"" one, and a premium one for I think $200 per guest that starts with a half glass of the 1999 Dom Perignon.  I resisted the temptation to go with either, mainly because it'd be too much for my wife, but also because I was unimpressed to see a Riesling served BEFORE a bone-dry Montrachet!  They offer a mind-boggling array of wines that included a grand selection of small house champagnes at ""reasonable"" prices.  I'm old fashioned when it comes to wine pairings - you dare risk having a chianti with your fish, and I'll call you out and beat the tar out of you before Mr. Bond gets a chance to.  With such a diverse selection of food items ahead of us, champagne was the only sensible choice.  We settled on an Henriot BdB that was delightful, and it only set us back $78. I will not go into details or blow-by-blows: suffice to say that the 7-course dinner ranged from ""out-of-this-world"" to ""that was interesting!"".  Especially memorable were the lobster coupled with the oyster and the lamb was delicious too (where I REALLY wished we had more than one tiny noisette).  But I'd have the say the one that stood out the most (get this) was the sorbet made with sake.  Unlike other formal dinners I've experienced, this one came AFTER the main course (I guess Charlie needs to be different), but regardless of timing, it was the one course I'd single out as being the one that most tickled my taste buds in an exquisite and indescribable way. One (more) grace note: with the lamb in front of me, and the champagne bottle almost bottomed out, I asked for a glass of red wine.  One was suggested, offered, and brought.  It was an Argentinian Luca something or the other, and it was splendid.  I tried to get details, but was told it's not readily available to the GP.  When the check was brought, I pointed out to our waitress that the wine was not on there.  She smiled and said ""don't worry about it"".  I guess that calls for a few additional dineros to the 18% that is automatic (not that we wouldn't have done that anyway). Charlie has said on his website that he wants guests to go away satisfied but not bloated, and I'd have to say from that point of view the portions were perfect.  We asked for a tour before our departure.  Charlie was not there that evening.  Kitchen was impressive in its din of activities, but the most remarkable part was the expansive wine cellar housed in several different rooms. I think there are some well-heeled connoisseurs out there that will literally KILL for that collection.   So that was our much-anticipated 25th anniversary dinner.  While it didn't ""blow me away"", we certainly enjoyed our evening very much, and are - even with millions of starving people all around the world - unrepentant toward the exorbitant tab of close to 6 Benjamin Franklins.  A time and a place for everything, right?  And that's the bottom line: for many reasons, Charlie's really more a place for special occasions than a weekend night out, and whats wrong with that?",0.9958,0.864,0.103,0.034,0.6087823129251699

We knew this would likely be the first and last time we'd dine here so we splurged on the wine accompaniment.  Total cost w/ tip for 2 people: Nearly $600 We're sushi lovers, but the bubbly froth on the raw seafood took some getting used to. Otherwise the dinner was really good (though not $600 good) and I gained an appreciation for wine pairings. Note: the server would only pour about a 1/4 glass of each wine. We're not shy so we simply asked for more. The desserts and paired wine were amazing. Decor was dated. Would I go again? Sure, as long as someone else was footing the bill.

2008-06-10,3.0,"I tried very hard not to set my expectations too super-high for my first ever visit to Trotters.   When you expect too much from a dining experience  just because it's fancy-pants and expensive, you'll likely walk out at the end of the night feeling either: a) Satisfied that everything lived up to expectations b) Betrayed & bitter because the evening was not quite mind- or life-altering. c) Not really satisfied but willing to delude yourself into thinking that you had a great time, because isn't that the way you SHOULD be feeling? I came seriously close to letting myself fall into that last semi-delusional state of mind after my dinner at Trotters.  After all, the restaurant itself is beautiful, the service was attentive and professional without being too stuffy or stifling, and all but one dish we had - right down to the desserts - was delicious.  So why was I not grinning from ear to ear at the end of the meal?  The big turn-off for me ended up being the length of my dinner.  We were excited when we were seated around 6:00.  By 7:00 we had sampled a couple of courses & were anxious to try more.  By 8:00 our eyes were getting a bit droopy & we were counting how many courses we had left before we could get up & stretch our legs.  By the end of the third hour I was seriously squirming around in my seat trying to keep the circulation going in my legs. I'm not always averse to long, liesurely-paced meals, but generally those work best when I'm with a large group that can order a diverse array of dishes to share freely.  Charlie offered only two multi-course menus, with each course in portions so small that sharing isn't terribly convenient.  Honestly, I probably would have been happier if I'd stopped by Trotter's To Go on Fullerton & picked up a picnic dinner. I'm giving Charlie three stars just because the food was so good. If you are a serious foodie with the disposition and patience to endure the slo-mo culinary marathon that is Charlie Trotters, then by all means you should try it.

2008-05-29,1.0,"I actually left Charlie Trotter's hungry after sitting through a dinner with a $3,000 check.  Please note that this review is specific to the Kitchen Table at Charlie Trotter's. I was tremendously disappointed in the Kitchen Table at Charlie Trotter's. I organized a group of six. The BF called ahead to notify them that the dinner was to celebrate my birthday and a promotion at work, but nothing was done to acknowledge that during the meal.  We had to ask for copies of the menu as we were leaving and a happy birthday message was written at the top, but it was too little too late. They also highly discouraged the BF from bringing an outside birthday cake. I really wish he had because that would have brought one decent dessert to the table. I was also the host for my group and the server picked up on my displeasure with the food and wine, but then it became awkward when he asked me how things were going as I did not want to embarrass the restaurant in front of my guests. My experience at the Kitchen Table was exactly the type that people hold up as an example of why fine dining is ridiculous. Given my previously wonderful experience at Charlie Trotter's, I was stunned. I was amazed at how lackluster the food was this time vs. my previous visit. Then I remembered the part on their website about cutting back on cream and butter. The site states, ""Food doesn't have to be rich to taste good."" I get that, but the food did not taste good. The server should have caught on to that as I only ate one bite of almost everything that came to the table. To be honest, the six mini dishes in a bento box that started the meal were good, although the cuttlefish was not sliced completely through. The summer squash blossoms were good.  Everything else was mediocre to awful.   By 11 PM, I was watching the clock and waiting for the meal to be over, but I knew it would drag out until nearly 1 AM. The tasting menus at Restaurant Guy Savoy in Paris are immeasurably better than what was served at Charlie Trotter's. Jardiniere in San Francisco serves a delightful tasting menu with exceptional wine pairings. The night before, we ate dinner at Topolobampo and then had the dessert tasting at TRU and that meal was far and away better than what we had at the Kitchen Table. I was embarrassed to have chosen Charlie Trotter's for my celebration dinner given the food (and wine) that came to the table. The most egregious course was dessert. First, it was highly inconsiderate to serve five desserts at once when four were ice creams and immediately began melting in the stifling heat of the kitchen. Either I was supposed to scarf down all four of them as quickly as possible, or eat several bowls of melted goop when I finally got to them. Second, the pastry chef was lazy. The main components in all five desserts were pre-prepared. There was no pastry to be seen and frankly, the entire presentation looked like a business class airline dessert tour de force/farce. I never thought I would use ""lazy"" and ""Charlie Trotter"" in the same review.   Chef Trotter is famous for seeking perfection and perhaps things would have been better had he been in the kitchen. Trotter purports that the Kitchen Table is a ""spontaneous degustation menu,"" but I saw the same dishes going out to main dining room and quickly realized it was just an unflattering combination of the Grand Menu and Vegetable Menu. The wine pairings with our meal were stunning, but not for the right reasons.  Overall, the wine pairings were like adding insult to injury. Our server seemed nice and he must have been very experienced to be given the Kitchen Table. However, he had a heavy accent and the kitchen was really loud. None of us at the table ever fully understood what was in any of the dishes because we couldn't hear him well enough to compensate for his accent. Had menus been presented, this could have been alleviated. The server did catch on that I was not enjoying the experience, but then he asked me about it in front of the other guests at the table who were mainly enjoying it because 1) they were enamored with being in a professional restaurant kitchen; 2) they were excited to be dining at Charlie Trotter's; and 3) some of them didn't know any better. This put me in the very awkward spot of having to lie and say I thought things were ""okay"" when clearly that was not the case. The fact that nearly every plate I was served left the table with only one bit gone and every glass of wine left with only one sip gone should have been a clear signal that I wasn't happy. Calling me out on it in front of the others at the table was the height of rude and anything but world class. Charlie Trotter's failed to create an enjoyable evening for me. I seriously question the level of taste at Charlie Trotter's now in both food and wine. Fundamental mistakes were made in a restaurant that is supposed to be near perfection.

2008-05-24,4.0,"It's been two days since our dinner at Charlie Trotter, and I'm glad I decided to put some distance between myself and the experience, you know, objectivity and all that jazz.  And objectively? Well, it was very good, but still disappointing, if that makes sense. Maybe we just expected too much - I mean, we waited two years to dine here, waiting for the perfect occasion to merit a visit. And ultimately, it seems like this is not a restaurant in its heydey. Or maybe Alinea is just doing such a goddamn amazing job that Trotter's doesn't shine in the inevitable comparison.  For me, it was all in the details. To start with, I was a tad disappointed when we received valet and coat check tags. (Don't hate me, I really think my Alinea experience has spoiled me for life! They knew how to woo me. Bringing our coats as we was ready to leave, and having the car ready as we stepped outside were definite flirtations.) I felt like if you're paying this much for the food, they could go the extra mile to make you feel like an honored guest.  Food aside, I couldn't help feeling a little hovered over by the staff. They're polished and professional, and it's not like they're in your face, but their constant presence in the vicinity was a bit unnerving. Maybe it was the location of our table? I did love our hostess for giving us a tour of the kitchen at the end of the meal, though. That was a nice touch. She also made some amazing wine suggestions for me when I decided not to go in for the paired tasting.  Finally, the food. My husband sampled the grand menu, and I nibbled on the vegetables. Some courses, like the artichoke soup with spun honey, and the white asparagus and fava beans, were spectacular. Others not so much. The odd water chestnut and jasmine granite comes to mind in particular - this dish was a risky move that didn't quite pan out, floral perfume on your tongue, anyone? My husband had a similar crossed experience. He went into raptures over the lamb and quail, but the dungeness crab left him strangely unsatisfied.  These guys have the dessert department covered, though. All four sweets were amazing, with subtle flavor and texture combinations that were a revelation. And the little sampling of chocolates to round it all out? Pure perfection.",0.9972,0.732,0.205,0.063,0.5422967479674795

When we were finally seated we were handed menus that said ""Liz's 24th birthday"" on the top of them.  They had printed up special menus for my birthday.  I actually still have one three years later.  Okay almost four years later.  (ack)   Our table was served by a group of what seemed like about 8 waiters, although I'm sure that it wasn't in reality.  However, they never hovered.  I have a severe dislike of hovering waiters that can't seem to get the hint that maybe you don't want to be asked how you're doing every. five. seconds.  These waiters knew exactly when we wanted them and when we didn't and disappeared into the shadows when they weren't needed.   And then there was the food.  The food.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food.  CT's is one of those places where you could literally order a piece of poo off of the menu and it would taste flavorful and fantastic.  Well maybe not literally, but you get my drift.  There were several things on the menu that I had never eaten before or knew I wasn't a huge fan of, but I ate them anyway.  And it was worth it because regardless of my fear of what exactly squab was (it's a type of pigeon), it didn't matter because the chef prepared it so delicately.   Charlie Trotter's.

I was not disappointed.  It lived up to all of my (admittedly lofty) expectations.  Trotter's may be the perfect restaurant. The room is elegant, yet understated, and surprisingly intimate, but not stale or stuffy.  I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the room at Alinea, which may be even more beautiful, but somehow uncomfortable.  The service could not be more perfect.  Our waiter, an impeccably dressed, courteous individual, helped us select a magnificent, and very pricey, bottle of Chateau Mouton-Rothchild, serving out of a beautiful decanter.  He offered to serve a customized menu based off of said wine.  And the meal came off without a hitch. Every course astonished me with its presentation, the complexity of the ingredients, the freshness of the meats, seafood, and vegetables, and balance.  The variety of poultry and game (capon, elk, pheasant, squab, venison, duck) in this single meal was incomparable.  The wine, of course, paired beautifully with each dish.   The only negative I had with the meal is that they may have gotten a little too cute with one of the desserts, attempting to pair bacon with a chocolate baba with somewhat disastrous results.  Though I must say, I appreciated the creativity of the dish.

A name like that to the average Joe would probably conjure  images of stuffy steakhouses where old men who look like the monocle-wearing monopoly dude smoke fat cigars and sip cognac. Fortunately, Charlie Trotter's is much more than some mundane steakhouse.  Most serious foodies consider Trotter to be in the same league as Gandhi, God, or even (hush) Keller... Since wifey and I have been concentrating our dining efforts on the coasts, we figure we'd give some of the places ""in the middle"" a try.  Our Chicago hopes and dreams were more than fulfilled. Trotter's is located in a charming and understated brick townhouse in the very tony Lincoln Park neighborhood.  You'd probably walk right by if it weren't for the lavish seasonal displays they have adorning the staircase and the incredibly friendly valets greeting you.  Speaking of friendly, this is one of the things which struck me most at Trotter's.  Yeah, everyone here is paid to kiss my ass (and I like it), but there seems to be a genuine earnestness and Midwestern charm that's lacking on the coasts. The menu is refined and flavors range from light asian-inspired to really bold and  unusual offerings.  The highlight of our meal was wild antelope with eggplant puree... nice. Something else that Trotter's does better than most places is dessert.  More than once, wifey and I have been abruptly startled back to earth with a lousy dessert to complete what could have been a divine meal.  Not so with Chef Trotter.  He inundates you with multiple desserts of such wild variety, that you just have to shake your head and grin from ear to ear.  I think our table for two had at least 5 different desserts served all at once.  The oddest one was a Brazillian chocolate number with chorizo... goddamned CHORIZO in my dessert!!!  And it was GOOD!! Thank you Chef Trotter for a wonderful meal and an eye-opening experience.

All the plates' flavors blended together nicely and there were so many new, different flavors to my taste buds. The sorbet course was a sour cream sorbet with beets, which I've never had before. The dessert course, sadly the last plate we saw that night, had a tiramisu ice cream with chocolate on one side and then this symphony of different flavors paired with dark chocolate like lemon cake, Greek yogurt, and lemony tasting thyme curd or something. I asked for copies of the night's menu and received them. Lastly, we got to take a tour of the kitchen which was so cool!

(excuse my memory, it's been like 3 weeks).  the last dessert came with a vintage port from the 60's, which tasted like chocolate wine goodness.  i'm taking away a star only because the lack of my fine dining skills and how awkward i felt at times because i felt like i had to be so quiet and proper. but i must say, it was worth pointing my pinkie finger up when i drank my wine.  btw, i didn't pay for the meal but i remember seeing my meal for $120 and $150 for my man's. i'm not sure how much the wine pairing was, but i'm sure it wasn't cheap.  lastly, i had to use the restroom, and being that there was only one (really nice) bathroom, i was waiting in line. i just so happen to run into the chef (at the time i didn't know it was good old charlie himself), and i got to shake his hand and thank for the delicious meal. when i told the manfriend, he was jealous. i should have asked him to say hi to him. i feel bad.

The food is, unsurprisingly, amazing, and the wine pairings are if anything even better.   It may not be crazy cutting edge (for that, go to Alinea), but it's flawless, beautiful, and subtly surprising.  Anybody can tell you this. But it's the service that I love--it's not just polished, it's perfect.  Unpretentious and relaxed, with an unobtrusive warmth that makes you feel both at home and perfectly taken care of.   When I went here the first time, both my husband and I were in college and I had never been in a restaurant more posh than the Olive Garden, but I was treated as if I belonged there as much as any of the bejeweled middle-aged women around me.  They answered my questions with a quiet and unfeigned delight.  I never once detected an ounce of pretention or smarminess, and trust me--as keyed up as I was (it was our first date!), I would have noticed. A note on something I haven't noticed mentioned: The Kitchen Table.  Yes, this is fun, and not as difficult to get reservations for as you'd think.  But the experience is very different than the main dining area.  I would recommend that people who have been to Charlie Trotters a couple of times and want to see the kitchen working try it with a couple of other like-minded couples (you need a bunch of people).  You'll be RIGHT in the kitchen.  The room around you will be in a perpetual swirl of hectic noise.  You have a dedicated server, and an on-the-spot custom menu, but you won't be able to order wine pairings (one of the great things about the regular menu).  It's harder to have a relaxed conversation, and it's not romantic.   But it's fun!  Definitely try it once.",0.9986,0.743,0.246,0.011,0.5699349816849815

2007-04-28,5.0,"Trotter's is flawless and the whole experience made me rethink my view of a dining experience.  To serve a juice pairing with one's meal was one of those things that I never experienced. But to serve two seperate menus, one focusing on meats, the other focusing on vegetables, this is what I found so immensely remarkable.   Charlie Trotter 's embodies what every fine dining restaurant should be.  With the great food and wine,  the service was impeccable.  Every single person in there was like a maitre d.  They all held the same knowledge and knew of all the hundreds of wines that they carried as well as the preparation of each dish that they presented.  The food alone speaks for itself but the pairing with juice and wine created a totally new experience.  The way to eat food is with wine... and the wine must be as good or better then the food never being overbearing or rash, they must work like long lost siblings.  One having an apparent and distinct flavor, the other, a faint yet reminding hint of that certain flavor.  The wine should compliment the dish and the dish should surround the wine as if it were curious about the complexity of such a simple looking fluid.  At Trotter's, they really shined on this light. One has to recognize Trotter's as a legendary restaurant and a foundation for new cuisine for they set the bar so high.  It has been around for over 20 years and their standards of fresh produce and the best meat and seafood have not changed a bit.  This place is a food mecca and everybody who has the intention of ever opening a restaurant has to experience this place at least once. Our meal was amazing but I think it was the overall experience that made me realize that food, service and wine all work together to create a harmony to the guest... a certain fluid motion whose outcome can only be... the best dining experience you will ever experience.",0.995,0.807,0.172,0.022,0.519956124956125

The wait staff is polished and professional, well-heeled with easy smiles.  I think around 5 different people worked together to bring food, clear plates, providing an extra pour of a favored wine and generally provide a seamless dining experience.  They staff is knowledgeable as well, answering questions about the food, wine, and dining/visiting the Chicago area in general. The decor of the restaurant was a touch simple to me.  It did give a very homey feel along with a refined and older air.  My girlfriend and I were definitely the youngest people in the dining room around us.  Despite it all, I did not feel self-conscious. The food here is excellent.  We both had the Grand Menu, although we contemplated the Kitchen Table Menu.  Having had a molecular gastronomy experience the night before, Trotters might seem a touch blase, but each dish that was presented to us tasted wonderful.  The ingredients might not have included flavored air or liquid nitrogen, but Chef Trotter has a knack for pairing ingredients that work well together. I mentioned to our server that I lamented not getting the Kitchen Table Menu and he was kind enough to have the kitchen create a special extra dish for us, Angus Beef.   The menu changes every night so it is difficult to predict how a return visit would be, but I am willing to bet no matter what day you go, you will leave with an unforgettable memory.

Charlie Trotter is one of the most notable Chicago celeb chefs and we thought we HAD to try his place. The interior and overall dcor of Charlie Trotter's appears to be the same it was when they opened in 1987. Dishes seem a bit worn, bathrooms and hallways feature celebratory menus featuring Trotter from the early 90s and much of the crowd seems to be straight out of the 70s/80s classic soap opera ""Dallas""---big hair, floor length mink coats, gaudy jewelry, etc. As for the tasting menu, it's sub par in comparison to other Chicago area tasting menus, with the Indonesian chocolate and beets being the only memorable course.

From a service standpoint- this place is amazing!  From Christian who greeted us as the door to the team of Sally and Nick who waited on us, everything was impeccable. A point of humor in the evening was as we were toasting my birthday- the servers showed up with the next course and they were ""horrified"" that they had interrupted such a special moment.  I thought it was funny but they retreated so fast that I didn't have a chance to tell them it was okay. The only service flaw was that there was at least a half an hour wait between two of the courses.  I don't know what the problem was but we were getting a little restless at that point and since the wine that they were refilling my glass with was not one of my favorites- it just made it seem longer. The tasting menus included a wide variety of items.  We chose the ""grand"" menu which was good- but I wish our server had offered us the option of swapping out those courses that we didn't think we would like with something from the vegetarian side. Ask if you go as there were a couple of things I might have made a change on had I had the chance.  I had the complete wine flight with my dinner ($100) while my dining partner took the vegetable and fruit juice selections ($45)  My recco is go for the wine as the juices were bizarre.  One was a seaweed and mushroom juice concoction that smelled and tasted like dirt!  Of course they swapped it out when we mentioned it- but there really wasn't a winner among them. We did take the kitchen tour which was nice and even nicer- when I mentioned that my dining partner liked to cook- they presented him with three books from Charlie himself along with a bottle of Trotter's organic ginger soy sauce. Given that the bill was over $600 for two of us- I know we won't be going there every day.  But for a special occasion, it was a memorable night.",0.98,0.831,0.119,0.05,0.5646962233169128

2007-03-15,4.0,"They rounded the corner, and pulled up in front of Charlie Trotter. The name of the restaurant sounds like the cousin of a one famous boy wizard and little bitch. There we were, three young gentleman pulling up in a less than fashionable steed. Handing the keys to the valet we proceed inside. One of the young men is slobbish, and must borrow a coat. The excuse he gives: I'd spilled on my coat today, and it was at the dry-cleaners. The young men, looking much like a corporate gay couple and their corporate gay friend, sit down at a table overlooking the lower floor and bar. They've arranged for a course of meals not on the menu, the kitchen course. 3 Kitchen course meals: $200.00 a head = $600 The wine list was extensive. The slobbish young man discusses the options with the sommlier. The two other gentlemen prefer sweet wines, and so a sweet, white sparkling is ordered. 1 Bottle of sweet, white, sparkling wine: $65.00 Total: $665.00 The first course consists of several small dishes, each filled with a different delicacy. Most of them are unappetizing. The young men enjoy about 2 of the 7 dishes. They drink their wine. And drink their wine. Other parties spring up around them. Friends and family and lovers alike. The servers bustle about serving the young men a barrage of fishy flavors. They sneer at some, and delight at some others. The memory has blended together the meal. Common denominators: Emulsion and Truffles. Emulsion tastes like a delicious essence of some kind of food filtered through Dawn brand dishwashing liquid. And it looked like it. And tasted like it. The slobbish young man did not like bubbles on his beef. When the wine was gone, it was time for a second bottle. The in-joke of the night: ""Excuse me, sommlier? We'll have *two* bottles...of your cheapest wine."" Also, the restraunt offered a vintage that was found in the wreck of the R.M.S. Titanic, for a scant $10,000.00. The men ruminated and joked of asking for a bottle of that particular grape, then upending it on the floor or throwing it out the window. Possibly taking it with them as they left and handing it to a wino on the street to enjoy, unbeknownst to him it was probably one of the rarest and most valuable wines in existance. The meal changed to meat, and the men rejoiced! Bread and butter was served with everything. They ate more than their fill, of that you can be sure. Much bread, and with each bite a heaping helping of butter. So smoothly, did it spread. The second bottle of wine was to be cheaper, and red. The slobbish young man choose randomly a wine for it's name and price alone. ""Grande Reserve"" was to be their wine. It was more dry than a nun's cooch, and had a higher alcohol content than Keith Richards. A truly brutish wine. Brutish, car-powering, nun's cooch wine: $35.00 Total: $700.00 The meat was superb, but the bubbles were not. Neither were the truffles. Fuck the bubbles. The meal ended with a cornucopia of deserts. The richest chocolates, the sweetest of the iced creams. Their minds were sufficiently blown away. The check came. A friendly game of ""The Price is Right"" ensued. Said the slobbish young man: $1.00 Said the butch of the gay couple: $920.00 (The slobbish young man's original guess) Said their friend: $950.00 Actual retail price and final total: $906.54. Taxes were $70.00~$80.00 Gratuity was ~$120.00 The bill was paid, the young men left. As they approached their car, the slobbish young man stated: ""All I need now is a blowjob and Burnout: Revenge to make this night perfect."" The slobbish young man is a vulgar and daft charlatan and rogue. The previous was the story of Emulsion and Truffles. This is the slobbish young man, and that was my tale.

Food:  As I mentioned, the more I think on it, the more I enjoyed the variety of flavor and texture and taste combinations on a single plate.  I was/am amazed at the amount of flavor in foamed sauces and reductions and how one small addition of a tiny item can change the whole bite.  That said, it did feel like I was sitting in a 1980's American effort at French food; it was a bit cliche.  One reviewer said"" While it may look like lack of choices, waiter explained that you could pick and mix the dishes of the two courses.

It's got to be hard to be one of those restaurants where there are expectations are perfection every night, but Trotter's is one of those establishments We went in on a busy Friday night to a very full front room of people waiting to be sat for the second seating.  We we're walked upstairs to the back room which was nice (a little quieter since it was away for the entryway).  The staff was surprisingly young (a good thing) they were thankfully far from pretentious or stuffy.  Unfortunately here is where I've got some complaints, I feel bad since I was and probably will be back in their shoes when I go back to Grad School, but I was expecting to be' Wowed'. Our initial helper who helped with the wine had bad breath.  Also, his suggestions where safe, without great explanations or Varity.  We ordered one White ( a Macon) and a Red (California Pinot) which were both below $100.  He asked what varietals we like went directly to one of each.  It was like he was coached and new those were standard picks, he didn't even try and walk through a little bit of the list or similar wines which would have been interesting to compare some flavor profiles or at least educate us about a few different ones before making our choices.  To his credit though the Roar Pinot matched the meat dishes perfectly. Our lead server didn't have a very good table presence at all.  He regularly mixed ""Uh's"" and ""Umm's"" into his descriptions and answers.  When some people questioned him on whether he could remember or orders right he came back (luckily) and repeated them back wrong so we were able to fix that quickly.  He also would trail off as he talked and would walk away without saying anything.  He never was in command of the table or really enhanced our experienced -- believe me the table was all about talking with everyone it was me a four southern women who are travel writers.  I can tell though he knew his shish.  He was very well schooled in the food and the history of wine, service and even our silverware! Without going into much detail since I've already written too much.  The food was great.  I was seriously thinking about begging them for a job in the kitchen prepping food for free just to see how they do what they do.  One thing I didn't expect to be amazing was the flavor they created in what they called ""Tomato water"" which was part of a bigger dish.  We also were almost embarrassed when they brought out 13 dessert plates for the 5 of us (We really just felt cool because we didn't see anyone one else getting spoiled like that).

2006-06-09,5.0,"SUMMARY: Wow, I had one of my best dining experiences ever, at one of the best restaurants in Chicago, if not the country.  I agree with past Yelp reviews that you should go here to enjoy the whole culinary experience, not just to fulfill your hunger.  In a way you enjoy paintings at an art gallery, you could come here to appreciate creativity & passion Charlie Trotter expresses through food and wine.  $145/person price for meat course was justified, when you consider what it took to provide first class service and have 10 chefs in the kitchen making first class dishes using the finest ingredients.       Note that this restaurant prides itself on spontaneity, so my review is applicable for early June 2006, but don't be surprised if they changed up on your future visit.    DETAILED VERSION:  MENU: As I opened their two page menu, there was vegetarian course on the left for $125 and meat/seafood course for $145.  While it may look like lack of choices, waiter explained that you could pick and mix the dishes of the two courses.  Contrast to their simple food menu, their wine menu (more like a book), was quite extensive and included selections from small wineries.      DECOR: With trees in front of this Lincoln Park restaurant, you may pass by here without realizing there is a premier restaurant here, although valet parking guy in the front is a hint ($10 plus tip).  You walk into a bar area, which is really a staging area where they get your coat and make sure all members of your party is there.  Then they guide you through the first floor dining area.  Our seats were upstairs, so we were directed upstairs where there were two more rooms.  My initial feeling as I was walking through here was, 'country club atmosphere.'  Interesting enough, after the meal, it felt more like someone's home.  Zagat rated Trotter's decor lower than food and service, probably because this restaurants, which looks like it used to be a house, is not very spacious like many other luxury restaurants inside hotels.    SERVICE: Service was top class starting with our main waiter to the 'food expert' that explained in detail each stage of the course.  Everyone, including the guy who takes the plates away, dressed in a nice suit.  Fork and knife was replaced after each dish and I never saw the bottom of my wine glass.    FOOD:  The portion size of each dish was no so big, but by the time we finished the course, I was quite full.  The course is set up so that intensity of flavor increases though out the stages.  Food quality was excellent; moreover, the presentation and the colors were very extertaining.  I won't get into details of the dishes for two reasons: (1) They change their menu weekly, (2) I cannot begin to describe all details the food expert told us.  One thing I can say is that I tried Squab for the first time.  It was good, but I would only trust Charlie Trotter to cook me a pigeon.    TOUR: After the meal, we were offered a tour of the restaurant starting from their kitchen.  I was first surprised to see there were over ten people in the kitchen, which explained the high price to enjoy first class food.  It was late at night, so chefs had time to explain what was going on in each section.  We then went to their two wine cellars, red and white, in the basement.  Our guide explained that Charlie Trotter was friends with many of the best California wine makers thus acquired some hard to get bottles.    BEST SEATS:  No doubt, the best table in the restaurant is the kitchen table (probably seats 6 or 7).  Our waiter told us that if we called and told them that we've dined here before, he could reserve the kitchen table for us.  The second best was the special events dining room with a large table and two CCTVs showing the live feed of the kitchen.",0.9978,0.827,0.139,0.034,0.4276883345930966

2006-04-05,2.0,"I was expecting one of the most amazing meals I have ever had; however, I was quite disappointed. I felt like the menu was a little bit outdated-seared scallops, seared ahi tuna. 10 years ago these items would be great, but you can find these items at Cheesecake Factory and every other restaurant in town now. I was expecting something more dynamic. I was hoping for a dining experience like Chez Panisse in Berkeley (which only costs a little over half of Charlie Trotter's). On top of that, the wine pairings were only mediocre. It is not that the food was terrible.  It is just that when you pay over $300 per person you expect amazing food that is somewhat unique. I feel like if the price was closer to $150 a person (including wine), I would give it closer to 4 stars. If you are interested in getting a great meal, there are many other better options in Chicago. Plus you can save a lot of money.   Even though the food was not as good as I expected,  I will say, the service is amazing, but I usually do not choose a restaurant based on service alone. However, the kitchen tour and complimentary bread and sweet package was a nice touch.",0.9951,0.685,0.26,0.055,0.635632183908046
2006-03-05,4.0,The service at this restaurant is superb. All of the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the the food and wine - and what is great is that they are not stuffy at all.

2005-08-30,5.0,"Sublime balance of flavors!  I felt wonderful after eating this meal - Trotter inspects all his food suppliers regularly and it shows.  He personally visits the livestock and vegetable farms to see how they operate, in an effort to serve the freshest food available.  He's also a jazz music lover, and strives to be their culinary counterpart by being as inventive as possible.  I was blown away.  My husband took me there as a surprise, and I was about six months pregnant at the time, and dressed a little casually I thought.  The hostest said ""please don't worry, fancy attire is not necessary.""  Very gracious of her to say, but everyone else in the room was dressed very elegantly!  The meal was about three and a half hours, then Mrs. Trotter (his mother) took us on a tour of the kitchen.  The service was unparalleled!  Feel free to order dishes not listed on the menu, they'll rise to the challenge.  Worth the money.  Ask for a tour of the wine cellar - they'll gladly accept.  If you want a real opportunity, try to get the chef's table, where Trotter serves you in the kitchen.  Good luck, you have to be the first caller of the day and it's a six-month wait.  I won a live auction item to be the guest chef at Trotter's for the day.  I sent my husband, and he said the educational benefits on the topics of service, management and excellence were truly rare.  He got to join the crew for the staff meal and everything.  NO FOIE GRAS: I learned Trotter made the controvertial decision to stop serving foie gras about four years ago.  Since he personally visits the farms that supply his food, he sees how the animals are treated.  He couldn't continue serving this delicacy based on what he saw - the force-feeding of ducks to enlarge their livers.  This was before the recent discussions about banning foie gras.",0.9944,0.797,0.178,0.025,0.5377435897435898

2005-05-25,5.0,"This is our great nation's NUMBER ONE dining experience.  You can't just call it a restaurant, dinner at Trotter's is a full evening's entertainment (several hours), not to mention the most decadent gustatory orgasm you're ever likely to have.  First off the place is tiny, maybe 10 tables spread out so even though you know people are around, it feels like you have the place to yourself.  The service is unbelievable.  We had 6 waiters I think ... and no, they were never obtrusive like een one waiter at many ""fine"" restaurants can be.  One was the head waiter whose only job was to smile and describe what we'd be eating.  One was the sorbet waiter.  They make a couple dozen flavors of sorbet every day in small batches.  They seemed to just pop up during the evening from time to time.  I'll have to check at home to see what we ate (they gave us a little package when we left with the night's menu and a cookbook) but everything was great.  I'd never experienced so many distinctly layered flavors in one dish before, and every one here was superb.  I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that it is a truly amazing experience.  I once flew from NY to Chicago for a one night stay, no business involved, just to go to Trottter's for dinner (ok, I also hit my favorite burrito place in the south side).  It's that good, and worth the hassle of needing to make reservations 6 months in advance.",0.989,0.831,0.153,0.016,0.5673333333333334
