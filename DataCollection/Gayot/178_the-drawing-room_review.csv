2015-02-27,5.0,"The atmosphere was cozy with a touch of romantic class at the Drawing Room, Chicago! My friend and I were seated at a cozy corner table for two. The plush chairs had a side and back which made it very comfortable, and if need be, easy to push together to make miniature love seats, for tables of four! Greeted by our personable and knowledgable waiter, we ordered drinks from the list of uniquely designed cocktails. Of course, wine and beer are available but the cocktails are really worth a try! I ordered what the waiter described as a 'holiday' drink, ""Orange is the New Black"" with hints of spices and orange. I ordered it because of the same name show on Netflix! I would describe it as two drinks in one. The spices are definitely dominate until the last few sips where a foamy sweetness with a hint of orange flavor takes over. After ordering drinks, it was time to look at the food menu! Even with the short list of menu items, about five choices in each section of First, Second, and Main, it was hard to decide what to order. I could have chosen two items from each section! After narrowing down our choices, we asked our waiter what his favorite items were. He mentioned our top choices and it was an easy decision from there. We started with a First, Steak Tartare, reluctantly skipped the Second, and chose Pan Roasted MonkFish and Duck Confit as our Main. Everything was delicious. We left nothing on our plates except for the duck bone. We never wanted for anything! The water glasses were always filled before they were empty. The food portions were perfect! We did not leave feeling stuffed but, honestly, very satisfied. The staff we came in contact with were very friendly and professional. The Drawing Room is definitely a place to consider for a date night, special romantic outing, or a nice dinner with the girls! I am already thinking of reasons to go again!

Dim lighting, velvet cushioned lounge chairs, candles, and linen draping from the ceiling to the floor combine for an elegant meets swanky vibe, without a dress code or pretentious feeling. The appetizer my husband and I had was some version of pork belly and IT WAS THE MOST TENDER MEAT I have ever had. Flavorful, and delicious, I could eat it again and again.. my husband and I fought over the last bite!  The entree was mediocre, I took a chance on a lamb burger, only having had lamp as a chop before, and I found it entirely too bloody.. quite unappetizing. The waiter and manager were incredibly accommodating and sweet about it all. They also compensated for it by lowering our bill. (We still tipped as if it were there out of gratitude.. the server shouldn't be penalized) My husband ordered some sort of cajun steak and it was different, but good. For dessert, we each got something different. He got creme brulee and I got a deconstructed pecan pie, both of which were INSANELY delicious. They use only what is in season, and only local ingredients. This leads to very few selections on the menu, but ideal choices nonetheless.

It's more of a lounge than a restaurant. We sat on little couches with a table. We first ordered drinks from their cocktail list. So the reviews are right.. Their cocktails are delicious! They are made with fresh ingredients! I had a drink that was made with cinnamon, apple cider and butternut squash. It sounds gross but was amazing! My boyfriend had a drink called the Peruvian  trying to do me in and he really enjoyed it. We also shared a drink with lavender in it.. That was my favorite! If  you are coming here for drinks..skip the beer and wine! Just stick to their cocktail list and you will be satisfied!  As for food..pretty tasty! We ordered the mussels which were a hit! We also ordered the braised short rib.. It was just ok. The reason why I say just ok because they fried it. I am not a big fan of m short rib being fried. Lastly we ordered the duck confit! It was cooked perfectly and mouthwatering! I recommend the duck! I am sure everything else on their menu is good too! Wish I could of tried it all!  Lastly... The ambience of the place is different.

2014-04-16,1.0,"I'd like to say I have been coming here for years and I have never been someone who doesn't enjoy change. They refresh their menu every season which is alway welcomed. Usually their drinks stay the same, this time they had a new drink menu and I was more than okay with it... while I'm not someone who expects consistency in their menu I do expect a consistency in how I'm treated. I walked past the doorman as usual and down the stairs and was seated immediately (which is never an issue unless on the weekend when they are rather busy). Like most places when the waiter saw a new face I was asked if I'd 'been there before' I told him yes but not for bit I'd been out of town on business.  He went on to explain some things to me that weren't available due to this and that, which I greatly appreciated. I asked for a drink I always get and he told me they did not make it anymore. I was more than happy to look over the new menu, he gave me a few minutes and took my order. By this time my friend had joined me and that's when the nightmare began. The waiter immediately started hounding us about what we wanted to order about every 5 minutes. We had clearly been talking every time he came up and instead of just letting us finish what we were saying he felt the need to interject and push for an order. After the 6th time of intruputing our conversation we just gave in to his passive aggressive demand for a food order. I ordered a small plate and so did my friend hoping to send him off to do something and instead of just taking it, we were asked, in a tone I can only describe as the tone an angry parent takes with a child, if we 'were going to order more food because those plates aren't entries...' I explained that we would start with that and maybe order more later. He huffed away... My friend and I continued our conversation and all was going back to being alright until our food came... immediately as it was set down he asked us how it was to which I informed him that we have not tried it yet. he huffed off again and came back as we both had our first bite in our mouths to ask us the same question. At this point he had another table that was seated in his section and I could not have been more releaved! They took so much of the pressure off of us it was unbelievable. The only issue now was that when we were both done with our food he came and asked for our next choice. I informed him that I was okay and he kept pushing me to try things and then asked if I wanted a suggestion. I informed him I had already eaten before I  came here and I was alright. My friend ordered something else and the waiter asked me again and I just wanted him to leave so I ended up ordering something as well. Again, we started having a good time up until I tried to get our check... it took 2 hours just to pay it. I have never in my life not wanted to tip someone. I'm a very generous tipper I usually tip  75% if not more when I come here... but never have I wanted to not tip someone. (I did tip him but not as well as I'm accustomed too. I couldn't bring myself to leave nothing. ) While we waited I timed it and was baffled by the amount of time it took for him to get our check but the entire time I'd felt like I was being rushed out of the place up until it came to paying. I have brought so many people here including some very high profile people who have fallen in love with the place as much as I had but after this last experience I can't see myself going back. The staff was not the same, I didn't know a single person working which has never been the case, and the service was so aggressive, I didn't feel welcomed at all in a place I use to call a favorite...",0.9963,0.86,0.11,0.03,0.4061967291967292

We were there on the first night of the new spring menu and while there can sometimes be issues with the roll out of a new menu, the Kitchen was phenomenal and had no issues and all the food was on point.  The Vietnamese chicken thigh and Zucchini cakes were both delicious though the chicken thigh was the winner, the southern cabbage slaw was really what won it for me.  The Lamb Burger was probably one of the best i've had in a long time and the lamb was perfectly seasoned.  Do know that the chef will recommend it medium rare which could be a bit too pink for some.  Desserts were also top notch.  Really you can't go wrong with the DR for a cute date night out on the town.  Also, there is a Jazz club right next door that is a great way to continue a great night out (20 cover).",0.9967,0.754,0.222,0.024,0.633192933192933

2014-03-13,4.0,"The Drawing Room has the best cocktails in the city. The list is short enough to be manageable but has something for everyone. Their Manhattan is my standard, and their rotating list of seasonal cocktails always surprises and delights. The worst ones are pretty good, and the best ones are revelatory. Which is why I rate the Drawing Room a 4 out of 5, despite its dated and slightly awkward decor and the fact that they have a gatekeeper who always makes me feel like I've only just been allowed in the restaurant by the skin of my teeth, despite the fact that I usually go at times when the place is practically empty. The table servers are knowledgeable and friendly. The Drawing Room is definitely better suited to fall/winter, because it has a very dark lounge-y feel.  I recently bought a Groupon deal for a 4-course meal with whiskey pairings. I had the mussels (the best part of the meal), a salad course I don't remember, the quinoa crepes (good and a large quantity), and a ""carrot cake"" that was still in the testing phase, and rightly so, because it was so awful as to be amusing. Dinner AND entertainment! The cocktails, which used to be priced evenly at $13 a piece, are now priced individually from $10 to $21. Yes, twenty one US Dollars for a cocktail. I'm not paying that. Most of the ones I wanted to try were in the $17 range, which is still pretty galling. They use unique, house-made, and hard-to-find ingredients, so I get it, but I would have much preferred a more modest and across-the-board increase. Make them all $15 or something. It's definitely dulled my enthusiasm for the place a little bit, but, that said, if you want a fantastic cocktail, this is your place. You just might pay out the nose for it.",0.9955,0.739,0.206,0.054,0.5964935064935064

2014-02-16,4.0,"Drawing Room is located in a part of Chicago known as the Gold Coast. Around the area you see a couple big name fashion lines and also the Waldorf Astoria ($$$$!), but Drawing Room was a pretty down-to-earth kinda place with mixologist style cocktails. First thing the bouncer asked us was if we had reservations. While we did not, we were lucky enough to snag 2 seats at the 7 seat bar. Inside most were just lounging and drinking. I felt right at home with my suit and tie, but nice jeans and a button up would work for you here as well. -=-Grandhattan-=- The name changes often but it's pretty much a whiskey sweetened up with bitters and vermouth. Classy and typical. -=-Pepperoni Drink, name?-=- I love pepperoni, but just don't know about drinking it. The liqueur used was more pepper than pepperoni. It didn't work too well as a drink since it was hard to down, but definitely unique. I asked for it. The big draw here comes from the live music room in the back called The Backroom. Our mixologist, Owen, was happy to walk us out to the back after we downed a couple of cocktails and some dessert.

So now we are seated and waited a good 10-15 minutes before anyone even came to fill our water glasses, let alone greet us.  We finally get a server to come over and we order a bottle of wine and then our food.  During restaurant week, I guess you have to put the full order in at once.  We literally watched our apps come out of the kitchen, head towards us to then turn around and go back to the kitchen. Guess the server realized we hadn't gotten our wine yet.   Waited patiently for another few minutes for our bottle of wine ( I think they were stomping the grapes in the kitchen) Oh, this was delightful.  My glass had a hair in it, I know it happens, but it was gross.  I didn't see it until after the waiter poured the wine.  I gave it to one of the bus boys at which point a manager came over to apologize and bring me a new glass. Fine. Done and done.   The appetizer was delish, had the steak tartare.  For entrees, I had the lamb burger and my friend had the monkfish.  Both were very good.  The food was fantastic actually, until the dessert came.  That left a little to be desired, my friend took a bite and almost spit it out in her napkin.

2014-02-03,5.0,"This place is one of my favorites!  My boyfriend and I first discovered it through Groupon and were blown away at the quality of food and wonderful drink selection.  We've been back several times, even bringing friends along.   Food: amazing.  Ingredients are locally-sourced, fresh, clean, and DELICIOUS!  I'd describe the fare as American with a twist.  Some ingredients are inspired by different cultures (Asian, Eastern European, Spanish, Italian, etc) but each dish is so carefully crafted that I guarantee you will enjoy every single bite. Drinks: serious business.  Servers have always been extremely helpful in picking out items that align with your tastes and will even take drinks back for the bartender to adjust if they're not exactly what you wanted.  Their house-made infusions and bitters just show you how serious they are about their cocktails and the time, effort, and quality ingredients put into them. Ambiance: eclectic speakeasy.  Decor is modern and cool, and when you first walk in you need to check in with the person at the podium outside and be let in at the base of the staircase, very James Bond-ey :) and cool.  The only thing that I sort of dislike is the low level of the chairs and tables.  If you spend a few hours there enjoying the food and cocktails, like we did, the super low level of the seating may bother you a bit, but it's not too bad. We love The Drawing Room so much and have been here three times already, we're sure to go back many more in the future.  I highly recommend this place!",0.9952,0.724,0.224,0.053,0.4578112874779543
2014-01-21,5.0,"I loooooooove this place. I have literally come here to drink alone before meeting someone for dinner and I never feel like a complete degenerate because the bartender always chats me up.  You know the drill, amazing cocktail lists, bartenders just standing there with a wealth of knowledge at your disposal. I've only ever sat at the bar so dunno what the servers are like. I also have never eaten here so, let me just throw my AA 1 month chip into the garbage realllllyyyyy quick.  My favorite bartender is this one kid whose name i think is Gareth? No, no one's name is freaking gareth BUT he's got dark longish hair that he wears tied back neatly, average height and build, wow I'm really painting a vivid picture here aren't I. Anyway, if he's there I just give him a spirit choice followed by an accent liquour that I love and he goes nuts and I love it. My boyf does NOT like it here he thinks its pretentious, I don't know why the miser in him isn't thrilled with the fact that they give you the little leftover part of your cocktail that won't fit in the super cute coupe glass in another glass, woohoo its like getting 1.5 drinks!  Anyway I brought a friend visiting from NY here, now she, like most new yorkers thinks that the best dining, drinking dancing blabla is in NY. It's a fun game we like to play where I try to take her to dinner and wow her to the point that she gets gout and then we drink until we forget what we had for dinner. I'd been saving up the Drawing Room to really knock her socks off.  WE walk in, she thinks the whole back alley-theres-not-much-of-a-sign thing is 'cute' but 'done', whatever I like it. WE sit at the bar she thinks its cool that it is so small. I ask gareth to do something with vodka my weapon of choice as a 28 year old WASP, she goes with a gin drink  from the cocktail list because s its sooooo in right now. Things go swimmingly, boy they do. We're a few cocktails deep and have both tottered off to pee a few times etc etc.  My friend admits she's having a good time, the drinks are great, but I see that NY bitch gleam in her eye. She says she's ready to order off the menu, a part of me knew what she was going to do, what horrible mean thing she was going to order. But she wouldn't...she wouldn't embarrass me that way. but she does. She orders a Ramos gin fizz. If you're unfamiliar with a Ramos gin fizz, google it I'm not even exactly sure what goes in it except for egg white, heavy cream, beautiful citrus and drops of freaking orange flower water and gin. Sounds yummy right? DO NOT EVER ORDER IT unless you want your bartender to hate you for life. It requires like 8 full minutes of vigorous shaking for it to emulsify or the angels to have time to come down from heaven and blow their airy breath on it or whatever the hell happens in that glorious shaker to make the lightest most delicate tasting, not too sweet, well balanced cloud of a cocktail ever made. I have only had 3 in my whole life, and I had to swap sex for it 2/3 times (I dated a bartender in grad school). Gareth does not bat an eye. He goes to WORK, oh it was beautiful. he handed it off for someone else to shake it for maybe 2 minutes but besides that it was all him shaking away. the damn drink was overflowing with beautiful airy light goodness, she asked for a spoon to eat it. I mean. I just. WHAT. Of course it was the best tasting thing I'd had all night, my friend still talks about it reverently, no NY sarcasm lilt in her voice at all.  review over.

2014-01-18,1.0,"So let me begun by saying I've been here twice, my first experience was as one could expect from a nice bar/restaurant at Rush & Division, but the second was not so. I went on 1/17/14.  We were sat down and the waiter explained the menu, which was very limited. (I say this not to complain, but it's an important point later on). So we ordered four courses and some drinks.  After about 30 minutes (not a joke) we finally got our drinks. Really?  Our first course which were the mussels and some sort of salad did not come out until 75 minutes after sitting down.  There was no delay in ordering.  The tables around us which had been seated after had already received their second course before we even got our first.  Our waiter finally realized this only after this amount of time. The worst part, the tables around us, throughout the entire course of the night, had ordered the same exact things we did.  We were continually told ""the kitchen is really busy tonight"".  Really?  There's only like 20 tables, and everybody seems to only be ordering the same four plates.  NOTE TO DRAWING ROOM, if table A orders two plates, and table B orders the exact same plates at the same time, you can put those orders on the grill or whatever at the same exact time! Additionally, the waiter came out and informed us and the tables around us that many of the items were no longer available because they had run out of food.  This was not mentioned at time of order, but rather over 90 minutes into the meal. The rest of courses took an extremely long time to come out as well, with the same excuse and same tables getting their food long before us.  Long story short, we spent over 3 and half hours in the restaurant, most of it with no food or drinks.   The waiter near the end I think finally realized how bad things had gotten and seen our desperation.  This may have happened when the table next to us got up and left after waiting too long for their food, and handed the waiter some cash as they walked out.     I think it's fair to say that at a certain price point, you expect a certain level of quality from the kitchen, management, and wait staff.  I'm sorry to say that was not the case here.  I will say that all our drinks were comped and the waiter brought out another set to help smooth things over, but I cannot recommend this place at all, and shall venture elsewhere in the future.",-0.8749,0.873,0.056,0.071,0.41631476489967056

If you want overpriced portions that can fit into a teacup, this is the place. This is really more of a drinking place for people who are desperate to be seen as evidenced by the stunning lack of anything on the vast majority of tables except scotch and wine glasses. The drinks are poured heavy but the place is under staffed so you still have to wait to get prompt service after your order is placed.   The meal portions are small and have barely any real flavor. Clearly food is an after thought. We made it through dinner, after sending the steak back to the kitchen,  and dessert was equally as small and flavorless. I had the Pecan Caramel Bar and I can honestly say you would do better getting a pecan pie from a local baker. If you are tempted to try them let me save you the work. These are flavorless nuggets of indescribable pecan-like filling that taste more like stale I don't know what.  What I did notice is the odd little balding man that was perpetually injecting himself into every aspect of the operation. I assumed he was the manager and did not reasonably expect him to be so involved in delivery of service instead of coordinating it.

A perfect date night out for visitors in town, first dates, and couples who just wish to keep the romance alive. Start with an affordable and delectable dinner in The Drawing Room (and definitely get the Hush Puppies as a starter - not your average home fried ones, trust me!) where it's quiet and romantically lit, and if you don't drink alcohol, be sure to order one of their delicious ginger cocktails - Lucien's Elixer! Then, be sure to ask about The Back Room for a livelier portion of your evening. Different band nightly - blues and jazz primarily. The service is excellent, and the staff has a way of making you feel like royalty. Hamid, the manager of both rooms is a gem and gentleman in every way.

2013-06-28,2.0,"Let me preface this review by saying I met a guy here who ended up being a total nightmare and letting some creepy skeletons out of his closet.  That being said, I'll get on with my review. First, it's super close to my apartment, so the walk was enjoyable.  The guy who checked my ID was lovely, he was drawing something, looked a bit bored, and I was surprised it was as empty in the neighborhood as it was on a warm Thursday night.   The hostess was sweet.  I walked to my table, sat down and I was greeted within just the right amount of time by our server.  We were only having drinks and I was pretty impressed with the available options. I ordered a roasted cider from MI and it was extremely tasty.   The mood was relaxed (except for the loud suits at the bar who left shortly after I arrived) and the seating was comfortable.  Very sexy vibe, I liked it.  The music could have been a lot better.  It didn't even leave an impression with me.  And while I've noticed a lot of people compre this to Violet Hour, at VH I remember the music amongst the slew of other incredible qualities VH has going on.  Drawing Room's music was forgettable.  So, that should be their first priority. Next, I stepped outside with my friend while he smoked a cigarette and while we were walking out, he mentioned to the hostess we'd be right back and asked she make sure they did not clear away our drinks.  They were more than half full.  Well, we came back and she immediately told us that they didn't listen to her request and cleared them anyway. Our server brought us new drinks, however, he was rude.  He didn't apologize for the mix up.  Instead, he poured my cider at the table and stood there tapping his foot like he was Regina George in Mean Girls.  Get a clue, guy!  It was YOUR mix up, not ours.   That completely ruined my experience.  I finished my drink , was sure to tip him very, very well in order to let him know that I it was their fault for the mix up and while I acknowledge that, I can still be nice.  He needs lessons in serving etiquette. I will give it another shot because the interior and overall mood is sexy and chill.  I hope they take my advice and pay more attention to their music selection, volume, etc. as it truly makes a big difference.  As far as Mister Regina George, I will try to sit in his section again as I believe he could use another lesson on manners.  It's his fault for the 2 star rating.",0.9941,0.806,0.152,0.042,0.5760485103132162
2013-06-24,1.0,"From reading the other reviews here on yelp, I figured something had to be wrong with me. You see, I've been to the Drawing Room before, and I didn't like it. Maybe it was just an off night. Also, again, maybe it was just me since I've seen these good reviews on yelp. However, after my second visit to the Drawing Room, I discovered that it wasn't me. In fact, this place is just not good, and people who think this place is good either have low standards when it comes to quality, have never been to some of the top spots in Chicago as well as in this country, or just delusional. To begin, the decor is decent. However, it was empty for a Saturday night. Usually, I don't comment on whether or not people show up, but this time, it correlates with the terrible time that I had here because I now see why this place was empty on a Saturday night. We had already eaten, so we just came here for drinks and a small appetizer. We had the olives, and they were absolutely awful.  Now, the drinks. To begin, the menu is awful! Why? There's no variety in the menu when it comes to drinks. If you are going to offer a cozy atmosphere, then match the menu with the atmosphere. The Drawing Room fails at this miserably. I look at the menu, and there's not one drink that grabs me; the ingredients are difficult to recognize, so you are really taking a chance with any drink you order. I tried the Circa 1711, which was decent, at best. However, I then tried the Charlie's Manhattan (worst Manhattan I have ever had in my life), the Ready, Fire, Aim (no real taste there), and The Old Man, The Monk, and The Sea (this drink was so bad, I actually started laughing). I said, okay, let's try the scotch because even though some feel that scotch can be too strong, some have developed a better taste over the years. I asked about the Johnny Walker Gold. That thing cost $31. I laughed again. Why? I can get the EXACT same Johnny Walker Gold at various 5 star restaurants throughout the city of Chicago for half the price, and that includes downtown. Our waiter was slow as molasses. This guy took forever to get to us, even when we tried to flag him down. Maybe his dreads slowed him down, I don't know. All I know is that it took him forever to get to us, which was annoying. Please don't go to this place. I dine out VERY often. I've been to the top Speakeasy spots in the city and some of the top restaurants in this country, and this place is a waste of your hard earned money. Go to Sable Kitchen and Bar, The Violet Hour (if you like quality drinks with a stuck up crowd), or the BarrelHouse Flat. Heck, you should try Ay Chiwowa before the Drawing Room.

They were all just very standard, nothing exceptional. You can also get customized drinks at the bar, but again, none of my customized drinks have been all that memorable.

It's is a very sexy and intimately low-lit place.  They use deeper-colored wood, which is always a great look.  It's a big space, which I appreciate.  The bathrooms are spacious and clean, too.  Additionally, the music is fairly soft, so it's easy to conduct and hear conversations.  All pluses for a girl!   I love the service.  The waiters make great recommendations for your palate.  When I ask for ""fruity"" and ""very sweet"" drinks, a lot of times I don't get a drink fitting that exact standard.  But they're excellent about making the correct recommendations and mentioning to the bartender to really make your drink sweeter.  Their drinks are really phenomenal here.  Best of all, they don't treat me shitty for just ordering 1-2 drinks (sometimes it happens at places, they pay more attention to heavy-drinking customers).  That's important to me. Aura-wise, it is not a fantastic place for meeting people.  It's great for coming with friends (particularly if you're a girl) or someone special.  That's a big reason why I think it depends on what kind of night you're looking to have, and what your personality is like.  If you like all-out dancing, a very wild locale, and hookups--this isn't your place.  It's a good place to go out with friends, or to begin a night with delicious drinks, or to end your night quietly. I highly recommend The Drawing Room for those who like places like Hub51, the bar at Gibson's, etc.  This is not for those seeking a place like Sub51, Paris Club, Theory Sports Bar, or an Irish pub.  This is not a ""wild"" or ""crazy"" place.",0.9991,0.735,0.246,0.018,0.5590192566054635

The music playing isn't too loud so it's nice and relaxing.  -The food is presented in adorable tapas style white plates, very cute. At the time we had steak sliders served with pickles and some kind of sauce. Tasty, but not cheap.  We also ordered some kind of potatoes almost looking like potatoes bravas (possibly in a paprika sauce). The portions are smaller but for late night munchies after all the calories you just consumed next door from the alcohol, EVERYONE could you some portion control on the food especially if you are eating at 2am. -The small plates or appetizers run from $7-$10 and the larger entrees could be anywhere from $17-29 depending on what you order so a little steep. -The service was okay, not memorable, considering they weren't super busy, it was just okay.  -Dessert we ordered (because i always want something sweet after my something salty) was also okay, got some kind of tart that we didn't finish so obviously didn't love it.

We arrived and found our reservation had been made at the wrong time. Somehow we were down for 8:30 rather than 7:15. What was the most odd was that they offered that time. I asked for something around 7 or 8 and the person who has answered offered 7:15. Not a huge deal, just a little weird that I was offered one time and a completely different time was noted. There was an awkward moment, but the were able to seat us promptly.  The restaurant is beautiful, but I definitely get what others meant about the chairs. They are weird and something about them is slightly uncomfortable, but you get used to it. Our waiter, clearly an actor/ aspiring bartender, was personable and gave good drink recommendations. The drinks were very good, though I was slightly disappointed by the lack of a copper cup for my Moscow Mule. The dinner was good, but not great. It's definitely a place to go for cocktails first with food a secondary concern. Foodies can probably live without it.

I snuck a bite and really liked it. For our mains, I had the artic char and the other two had the steak. My fish was cooked to perfection, and I seriously ate every last bit.

2013-02-11,3.0,"I'm leaning towards a 3.5 star-review, but I really can't bring myself to round it up a notch.  The Drawing Room is an intimate lounge appearing to have located in the basement of a restaurant. It's contrary to the typical dim and enigmatic lounge as you would find in the Hancock. Their bright setting catches one off-guard leading one to believe the plush couches would do the ultimate catch and save. Not quite. We mostly sat in hunchback style on the low seats.   Our party of seven shared the Guild punch bowl, steak tartare, coulette steak, and vanilla custard with chocolate chip cookie as well as two glasses of Riesling. The portions were generously served. The punch bowl sufficiently allowed each of us to have 3-4 small servings. Be aware, it is not the typical punch bowl your aunt makes at a family gathering. The Riesling was also surprising in its own sense. It was alarmingly and eye-wincing sour. The steak tartare was a butterfly kiss to the cheeks but not enough to leave a strong impression. It was served with homemade potato chips which were healthily greaseless. The flavors were very subtle. The steak on the other hand was perfectly completed in a peppered and medium-rare fashion. Just the way I like it! The vanilla custard didn't seem too lively but the fresh-baked, homemade chocolate chip cookie brought it to life - crisp on the outside but warm and melting on the interior. Scrumptious!  Service was charmless in the presence of the bright lights. Our waitress was very attentive and constantly checked in on our table. BUT she succumbed to slippery hands and clumsiness. She was knocking off plates as she brought in the coulette steak and she even allowed the potato to roll off the plate and sit abandoned on the table. In another incident, she dropped the knife and fork as she cleared the table. My friend caught the knife before it stabbed me and the fork landed on my dress. The waitress ended that with a quip, ""Ooh, nice catch!"" I'm reluctant to say the same for her.",0.9928,0.769,0.171,0.061,0.5416666666666666

2013-02-09,4.0,"This was the place for this year's Restaurant week after Blackbird, Topolobampo went out of the picture.  We made a reservation on Saturday night, luckily, since I reserved the table way earlier.  Looks like it is more of a bar place which opens well into the early morning, so there was an ID check at the door which is rare for a dining place. The place was pretty dark, but overall had a hip vibe and nice ambience.  The server was nice.  I ordered a non alcoholic drink because I am very sensitive to alcohol, but I guess they used the same shaker that they usually use of alcoholic cocktail for my drink.  They should have been a little more considerate.  Also they didn't serve bread.  I don't know if it is just the restaurant week thing or they don't serve bread at all, but it was a little odd to start my appetizer at a fancy place like that without amuse bouche and/or bread.  Anyhow, the course dishes were pretty good considering it was a restaurant week food.  I had steak tartar, arctic char and sweetbread, and my wife had farro, sirloin and whiskey gelato.  Especially I loved arctic char.  It was so tender and perfectly cooked without the unique fish smell.   Recommendation for this restaurant week (which ends in 24 hrs anyway).

2013-02-08,2.0,"I'm so disappointed by this place that I'm compelled to write my first review on Yelp. Let me first preface this by saying that my rating is based on my expectations for a trendy place in the Gold Coast that I've actually heard good things about. Like Sierra G. below, I might have ordered the wrong things, but they were mediocre to downright bad. I went here for restaurant week, and the first course I got was a grilled octopus soup (that I was somehow expected to eat with a fork) with chickpeas and pickled onions. I've eaten octopus dozens of times, prepared in many different ways, so I don't think I'm being disingenuous in saying that the octopus was hardly cooked, and had zero flavor. My first bite was so undercooked that it was like chewing on a rubber bouncy ball, and I actually had to go to the restroom to spit it out. Aside from that, the entire dish tasted like chickpeas (I don't dislike chickpeas, but I didn't expect for that to be the dominating flavor). My main course was the arctic char, which wasn't nearly as awful as the octopus soup, but wasn't really anything special. There was some sort of slaw with bacon and mushrooms underneath it that was actually very good, but when paired with the fish, that's all I tasted. The fish was bland, and tasted and looked just like a frozen salmon steak I could buy from the grocery store, but without the seasonings I'd put on it at home. My dessert was an absolute joke. Whiskey-flavored gelato sounds pretty awesome, right? Well, I'm sure it would have been, had they not served me something that looked and tasted identical to vanilla ice cream. The mini cookies that came with it were great, though. The other dishes at the table were better than mine, to be sure, but nothing stood out or justified the reputation or price of this place. My girlfriend's steak was good, not great. If you're going to go for restaurant week (which I'd recommend against), the ""Crespella"" (which is really just a pretentious word for a crepe) was easily the best entree. Even the pork belly--which I find nearly impossible to screw up--had little flavor, and was paired with cannellini beans that were hardly cooked. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is the service and the cocktails. Both were great. I would not come back here unless I was coming just for a drink, and even then, I'd rather go to Violet Hour (I know, different neighborhood) or another specialty cocktail bar.",0.9977,0.775,0.192,0.033,0.6140924775707385
2013-02-08,2.0,"I went for Restaurant Week, so I'm not sure if that is indicative of how it is normally. I loved the look of the menu and the variety of options they offered, so I put together a little girls night with some friends. When we arrived, it was packed, but we we were seated at a table near the bar. The tables are low and some of the seating is on couches...FYI.  The cocktail list is pretty creative and I had heard good things, but I needed a translator for the ingredients. I'm pretty sure one of the cocktails included ""shrubs""...is that a real thing? I thought that was like a small bush?  My first course was the steak tartar and it was incredible. I've only had steak tartar a couple times, but this was prepared beautifully with lots of flavor and crispy homemade potato chips.  They were out of the fish option for the main course and didn't offer any alternative fish options, for several of our diners, this was an issue. Considering it was a set menu, they should of offered another fish main course. I was planning on having the fish and ended up getting the pork....bad decision. Very fatty and no flavor...tasted like very gamey meat.  Dessert was also weird. Black Dog gelato is supposed to be this magical experience, but I'm 95% sure something was wrong with the batch we got. It was whiskey flavored, but had a weird fruity flavor and the only taste was sweet, sweet, sweet. No whiskey, spice, or bite to it. I thought it was a personal preference, but everyone that ordered it agreed. The mini shortbread cookies on the side? delectable.  So....it was ups and downs.

I tried one of the citrus beverages and it was delicious (but of course I can't recall the name -- but if it has grapefruit try it! )  We ordered the calamari to warm up our palate.  I was so content with the calamari and the delightful pieces of chick peas.  For our entree, I had the duck breast and the spouse had the Pork Chop. We were both very pleased with our order.  I absolutely enjoyed every bite of the duck breast. I swirled every piece through the sweet and savory sauce on the plate before every bite-- magnificent!  After our very much filling meal, we decided to continue our evening at the Back Room (literally in the back of the restaurant).  I would recommend making a reservation in order to find seating closer to the stage or the center of the room. However, although we did not have any reservations, we were able to find a nice comfy spot on the side by the bar and we enjoyed the sounds of the blues.  The place got pretty jam packed by 10pm.   Overall, a great dining experience followed by great music!",0.9972,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.6008804370232942

Well, if I could sell my soul for a life time supply, sign me up.  Our table had the duck and the brisket which was heavenly.  Once again, this place makes three hours glide by with the wonderful drinks, food, service, and ambience.  Best dining experience in the city hands down.  Don't try to get in without a reservation.  If you want to continue your great night of drink, hop next door to their jazzy lounge spot, The Back Room.  You won't want to miss this spot if you live in the city.",0.9968,0.736,0.264,0.0,0.49104938271604937

As for the meal: I had steak tartar for a starter, a shrimp and avocado dish followed that, and Wagyu beef for the main course.  All of it was tasty.  They don't have a ton of options; so don't let that shock you.  Also the price tag rose quite quickly (but I was prepared for that.)

The place was low key and friendly, which is surprising given the neighborhood its located in. The Groupon came with a set of 3 'original' cocktails, as in they were some of the first recorded cocktail recipes. I though all of them were very tasty, particularly the Manhattan. I like that they added little flourishes without changing the major ingredients. After the flight I ordered an Old Fashioned that had a hint of citrus in the bitters, highly recommend this to anyone considering it. The food was also very good. I mostly expected it to be a vehicle for the drinks, but it stands out on its own. I think my personal favorite was the steak tartare, which was light, creamy and included a delicious spicy mustard garnish. Honestly the only killer here is the price.

Anyway, once we had reached the end of the tunnel we were greeted by the host, she is either psychic or pretty damn good at her job, she greeted us by our last name. Call me crazy but I've NEVER had that happen without it being a question, nope she said, ""Welcome Mr. Orozco"" they had us in the bag with that one! You don't get that type of service just anywhere.  The lounge, how to explain it...very modern, classy, intimate, and a candle always sets the proper tone, right?!  I was very skeptical of the  velvet chairs since so many people wrote in their review s how low/uncomfortable they are. We actually liked them, I think they are meant for you to loosen up the body a bit, of course not slouch, but to be comfortable... no one says you have to have perfect posture at all times, right?!  We went with the 3 course dinner, I wanted to try more but my wonderful husband made reservations at 10:30 pm, lol. what an exquisite menu... I won't go into detail about the food only because their menu will be changing soon. To start I had  the steak tartare, ok, I've had tartare several times but what I liked the most about this was the bone marrow mustard, it was great. My husband had Hamachi Crudo and also loved it.

I was even trying to taste all the spices to see if I could possibly try and make it at home, woah, it's the type of dish that makes your mouth water even when you're talking about it.

It could have used some tobasco, lol. That's about it. My husband had the Poussin, he claimed the chicken had small bones within the meat. : / making the dish a bit harder to enjoy.  Our server was great! He was very knowledgeable of the food and drinks. The people that refill your water, take care of proper grooming of the table were excellent!, I don't remember having a glass half full at any point. AHH the Cabernet Sauvignon was exquisite!

After dinner across the street we were literally a hop, skip and a jump away. Behind a non-descript door flanked by guard/check-in, down a sleek stair well, and you are home. Soft lighting, intimate seating arrangements, beautiful and subtle decorations; I kept having to remind myself I was in a basement. Doorman, hostess, and waiter alike were friendly and helpful, and wonderfully did not judge me or my man, a welcomed change from earlier debacles. We shared a chocolate creme brulee with blood orange. Honestly, I had stuffed my face full at dinner and was only planning on getting drinks, but the name alone piqued my interest. When it arrived at the table, it looked so freaking delicious that my stomach made itself bigger to accomodate at least a bite. It was so light and delicious, not too sweet, but not tart at all. I'm drooling thinking about it.... For my drinks I got an old-old fashioned-pirate style and a long island iced tea. The first was a specialty order. I can understand now what my grandma is perpetually looking for when she orders this. Usually a susbstantial mix with a swift kick on the intial drink, this old fashioned rocked my socks. Still substantial, way more subtle, and intoxicating, both literally and figuratively. The long island was also delicious and held its own against our other cocktails, a good sign.

The bar chairs are cozy (with about 8-10 chairs at the bar). Each time I've come the mixologists have been engaging, instructive, sometimes challenging (""you've never had a pisco drink?!"") and overall delightful. Christiana has created a cocktail list that has something for everyone - with an emphasis on flavor profiles rather than liquor preference.  I've only ever had appetizers here, but they were solid as well. The steak tartar was tender as a butterfly kiss, but significantly less awkward than smooching bugs.   The drinks are amazing, but they don't come cheap, and will run you about $13/$14 apiece, but for the amount of time and effort put into each creation, it seems perfectly reasonable.  They're also open until 5am on weekends, in case you're lying awake at 3:45 with the kind of insomnia only abated by a perfectly poured Manhattan (that's a kind of insomnia, right?).

Even though I don't like gin which the first and third were made with, they were mixed beautifully so I didn't get that strong juniper taste.  But, the Manhattan was my favorite.  My husband later ordered a scotch citrus thing that was pretty awful, I thought.

I showed up with two friends around 9pm on a Friday night, with no reservations.  We were told that there was standing room only at the bar, which is what I was expecting with no reservations, but once we were in we saw quite a few open tables, so we asked if we could be seated and without a problem we had a nice cozy little table with extremely comfortable lounge chairs.   We were quickly greeted by Brandon who was one of the talented men working behind the bar for the night, and he explained the concept of the Drawing Room and spent a good 5 minutes talking with us about what we like in a drink and what we were looking for that evening.  He created unique cocktails for each of us, which genuinely were suited to our tastes, and were all different than anything that was listed on the menu.  This level of attention and service from Brandon alone made me want to go back immediately, and that's before even trying the drinks! My first drink was THE BEST COCKTAIL I HAVE EVER HAD.  Brandon came over, presented our drinks, and explained what were in each of them.  There were so many wonderful things within my drink I can't even remember all of them, but I do recall there was some thyme, cinnamon, fruity herbal tea, egg whites and of course various types of liquor, none of which I can remember.  We were originally only planning to do one drink there, but I was so impressed with the drink I got, I wanted to see what else Brandon could craft up.  The second cocktail definitely did not disappoint.  It was a little simpler, but still kept my tastes in mind, and was a little stronger than the first (which was a nice contrast).

2012-07-12,3.0,"I met friends at The Drawing Room for drinks the other night. We had dinner elsewhere, so this review refers only to cocktail hour. I'm not sure what to make of the ambiance. I think we were anticipating a speakeasy vibe, which may be why we were a little thrown. The decor is lovely and well-executed, but the couch/chairs are difficult to maneuver, and I can't imagine any configuration of the tables and chairs that would allow for an intimate date. Many of the diners were dressed waaaay down from what I would've expected. Our cocktails, on the other hand, were exquisite. The server was knowledgeable, if a bit inarticulate, about the drinks and their ingredients, many of which were foreign to us. I loved The Sun Also Rises, with clear nods to Hemingway in the name and ingredients. I'm glad that I had an excuse to trek downtown to try The Drawing Room - it provides a welcome niche for upscale drinks in the potential sea of awful that is bars on Rush. On the other hand, with excellent and somewhat more affordable options like The Whistler and Scofflaw close(r) to home, I can't imagine that I'll make it back any time soon.",0.9878,0.776,0.185,0.038,0.6081196581196582

2012-07-02,4.0,"1830: France invades Algeria beginning a 40 year conquest. D. Hyde patents the fountain pen. Rush Street is born. Fast forward 182 years on Rush street. The Drawing Room. In my relentless search for the perfect beverage, I stumbled upon The Drawing Room's cocktail menu. The drink that stood out: Kick in the Cashews:  Monkey Shoulder infused with lapsang souchong, Koval Jasmine, cinnamon syrup. As a tea aficionado, I thought this combination would be sublime. As I walked up to the restaurant I had my reservations - not literally, but figuratively. The emaciated ""bouncer"" gave me the ""There's-no-room-at-the-inn, Mary"" look, but waved me in when I stated I only wanted a cocktail. When downstairs, I found the décor to be modern and inviting. The waiter, who bore a striking resemblance to Gerard Butler, was fantastic. He gave an overview of the restaurant, and its concept. He asked me what I would like for a beverage. Since every beverage seemed like a good choice, I handed him the menu and said to surprise me. He came back with one of the best beverages I've ever had: the Thirty Year Mortgage'. This cocktail contained Malort, Becherovka, arbol chile syrup, ginger beer, lemon, Angostura, and maybe a controlled substance because it was addictive. The 'Thirty Year Mortgage' galvanized me to get the three course meal for $47. Still leaving it to the waiter for a decision, I asked for another beverage. The second: 'The Avenue': Banker's Club, Lecompte Originel, passion fruit, house made grenadine, orange flower water. It was the quintessential summer beverage. The first course arrived: cucumber gazpacho with an herb infused oil and hearts of palm. It was remarkable. The soup was crisp, and the oil pulled the entire soup together. The second course: roasted lamb with caramelized rhubarb, roasted asparagus, and mint coulis . This was possibly the best lamb I've ever eaten. The flavors were transcendent. The execution was flawless. The third dish: Wagyu flat iron steak with ramp-bone marrow butter, braised fennel, asparagus, preserved lemon - the flavor was wonderful, but the meat was tough. I ordered my third drink at this time. It was time for a 'Kick in the Cashews'. The nose presented smoke with jasmine. This drink wasn't my favorite. I can appreciate a peaty scotch such as Ardbeg, but the smoke consumed most of the other flavors in the beverage. I applaud the effort, but I think less smoke would let the other flavors have a turn. Overall, The Drawing Room was fantastic. The service was stellar. The food and beverages - remarkable.",0.9967,0.823,0.156,0.022,0.5057142857142857

Loved the oversized padded bar stools and the corner sectional chairs at the dining tables. The single washrooms are pretty cool. Now on to the drinks. We had the pleasure of having Charles take care of us. If it was just drinks, I would have given him 5 stars for the impeccable service and delicious drink combinations that he came up with. I told him that I wanted a Jack sour and he came up with this lightly sweet bourbon drink that used egg whites to get the froth. Then I had a Nooner and it was quite tasty. I told him that I liked Ginger and he made me a gin concoction with ginger in it that tasted like southern lemonade. I loved when they squeezed the rind and lit it to get that burnt bitters taste. It was an enjoyable evening with our own personal mixologist. The prices for the liquor are reasonable for being on the Gold Coast. And now on to the food. I started with the fried pickles and they were a nice complement to the drinks. Light and flaky but not greasy. The radicchio salad had me wanting more, with the citrus, nuts and cheese. Love it. That is when my enjoyment ended. I had the lamb and it, like everything else was presented in an elegant fashion. But it was overly salty and had an old flavor to it? I ended with the flat iron steak. It was very chewy but had good flavor. I just found it odd that the food did not match the caliber of the drinks. And there were two ladies at the front desk that seat you when you arrive. But the rest of the time they stood there laughing and staring at people. Really! The place is not that big for anyone not to notice. Will definitely be back for drinks. And then on to dinner somewhere else.",0.9933,0.819,0.158,0.023,0.5383640552995392

We were somewhat worried about how it was so empty while the restaurants around it were pretty busy. I had read from the reviews that they had amazing drinks. The drinks were all pretty strong and good but I do wish they would explain the drinks a bit better on the menu, not a lot of people would know what certain alcohols are on the list.  For the food we decided to go with the three course meals since we figured this way we could try a lot more items on the menu. Get the fried chicken skin, probably the best item on the menu. It was fatty and crispy and i could feel my heart clogging with every delicious bite. Nothing else in the menu really stood out though, we had the beef tartar and grilled octopus (tender) for the first course. Carnitas taco salad and herb chicken cracklins for the second course and main courses of steak and halibut. Halibut was ok, not a lot of flavor but the fish was cooked good. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back, mostly for the drinks and the cracklins.",0.9901,0.796,0.185,0.019,0.5285714285714286
2012-06-24,3.0,"We have friends that have raved about TDR for years. So, when planning a downtown girls' night, this seemed like the perfect swanky spot. And swanky it is! The atmosphere is really the best thing TDR has going for it. Located right on Rush, in the midst of all the action, TDR's small, basement location adds to the kind of members-only mystique that draws in a trendy crowd. We were impressed as soon as we walked in. However, unfortunately, that's where our surprise stopped. Yes, there is a great cocktail menu. And yes, the waitress was very attentive. But I can think of a million places to get a good cocktail in the city. So, that's not really enough to earn this place 4 or 5 stars. (I will go ahead and say that, if you're JUST looking for a good cocktail in a swanky setting, this is a 4-star spot.) The food was the real let-down. All 4 of us tried the 3-course tasting menu. So, among all of us, we tried nearly ever dish on the small-ish menu. Here were our chief complaints: 1. No one had a single bite that blew us away. Okay, I lie. The salted caramel gelato was DELICIOUS. But, of the other 11 plates, nothing was memorable. Much of the food was under-seasoned. 2. I'm always a fan of using seasonal ingredients. However, that shouldn't mean that variety suffers. We had several different dishes that were essentially the same mix of ""local/seasonal"" ingredients: mushrooms, peas, fava beans. It seemed like everything we got was served on a bed of those things. 3. One of my friends is vegan. Yes--that's her choice. No--she can't expect every restaurant to accommodate her (though, more should). But, one of the deciding factors when choosing TDR was that, of their 4 or 5 selections for both appetizers and entrees, one of each was vegetarian and seemed easy to make vegan (gazpacho, tempura mushrooms with tofu). Also, I think that high-end restaurants, especially, are usually the most creative and willing to accept the challenge of meeting the needs of guests with dietary restrictions. So, when we kindly asked the waitress if the chef could make a vegan tasting, she came back from the kitchen and told us, ""It will take a little longer than usual for each course, but he will happily do it!"" Since we were wanting to knock back several cocktails anyway, we told them not to rush. Well, the resulting vegan tasting was really uncreative and uninventive. There was no protein AT ALL--no tofu, no mushrooms. What happened to those things on the menu? Instead, she got gazpacho (which was HORRID), a salad, and a pile of sauteed vegetables. Again, had this been the only problem with the night's meal and had we all loved the rest of the food, I would never think to knock TDR for this one offense. But, on top of an already underwhelming meal, this was a real disappointment. And at nearly $100/person for the final bill, there's really no excuse for this kind of mediocrity.  Needless to say, we probably won't be back. We all left saying, ""Well, at least that one is checked off of our list.""

2012-06-22,4.0,"We went here on a Friday night. It was really nice and classy. It was filled but not crowded, and certainly not loud. Reminded me of what a Mad Men's place would be like if it were slightly changed for the 21st century...and sans smoking. I think we only intended to stay for a little while, but well, that didn't quite work out. The drinks were absolutely delicious and so we stayed a little longer....and a little longer. The service was also amazing - the waitress knew tons about the drinks and was always pleasant and friendly. We started with one of the punch bowls. It might look small upon arrival but that thing is deep. And strong. You can smell the liquor before it even gets to your cups (and in a good way). Then between the five of us we tried nearly everything on the cocktail menu (and some of them more than once), including the Manhattan, Old Old-Fashioned, The Nooner, Three Wheeler, The Sun Also Rises, The Armada, St. Andrew's, Manatee Musk, Queen's Ration, and maybe another one I can't remember. I really like the Three Wheeler. The Sun Also Rises was kind of a disappointment, and I know I didn't like the Queen's Ratio at all.  We also ordered food intermittently: beef tartare, grilled octopus, lamb breast, tempura mushrooms, chicken cracklins, and polenta cakes. The food was just okay as far as I was concerned, esp. since the octopus seemed overcooked and the mushrooms nothing special, but my meat- and poultry-eating friends loved the food, especially the beef and lamb, which they ordered multiple times.

2012-06-16,5.0,"Judging by the near-emptiness at 7:30 on a Thursday night, I'm guessing that the Drawing Room is known best for its cocktails. And yes, the cocktails are delicious. BUT, did you also know that DR is a triple threat?? Food, drink, and service were all impeccable, probably the best I've had all year. I learned about this place from seeing Nick Lacasse, chef of the Drawing Room, on Around the World in 80 Plates. Not a bad looking guy... but I digress. The place is intimate and trendy, good for a date or small groups. Both food and drink menus are seasonal; our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about both, which was supremely helpful considering my date and I what two-thirds of the drink ingredients were. For example, a cocktail comprised of Monkey Shoulder infused with lapsang souchang, Koval Jasmine, and cinnamon syrup. I understand about 5 letters in that sentence. We shared four plates, two cocktails, and a dessert: Cocktails: The Avenue, The Sure Thing: 4/5. both were light and refreshing. I'm not a huge cocktail connoisseur, but they're in the league of Violet Hour, BarrelHouse, and Gilt Bar. Good company, no? One day I will try the Kick in the Cashews and Manatee Musk Punch purely because I give bonus points for name creativity. Green Gazpacho: 4/5. Continuing with the light and refreshing theme, high (but not offensively so) in cilantro taste. Tempura Mushroom: 4/5. The mushrooms themselves were pretty good, probably half and half between batter and mushroom, but that yuzu-silk tofu puree was crazy good. It tasted just like creamy aioli, amazing since its, well, tofu. Grilled Octopus: 5/5. Perfectly grilled and tender, and all the little fava beens, artichoke, little fried something-chips, etc. matched well. Herbed Polenta Cakes: 5/5. If you can only get one thing on the menu, get THIS. It's quite rich, but sooooo worth it. Creamy polenta cakes with a nice char/crisp on the outside, and mushrooms, squash, and kale mixed in this insane white wine garlic (probably butter) sauce.  Black Dog Gelato: 5/5. First, it was FREE with our foursquare check in. Second, it was friggin DELICIOUS. The gelatos rotate from day to day and we had salted peanut. I know, this is not technically a Drawing Room creation. who cares, so good. As if the food and drink weren't good enough on their own, I noticed about halfway through the meal how perfect the service and pacing of the meal was. Our waitress was super nice and checked on us throughout the meal, and the waitstaff replenished our plates and silverware with every course. They seemed to know exactly when to bring out the next dish so that we never felt rushed nor were we ever twiddling our thumbs wondering what was going on in the kitchen.

She sends out a seriously great vibe and didn't dock me any points on not being super hip-to-it when it came to knowing exactly what their menu entailed. I gave her a few drinks that I liked in general and she was able to take that and turn it into a recommendation and explained her way through the menu. I have been wanting to try a cocktail with egg whites in it for a coon's age and I finally had the chance when I got The Priority Cocktail. I enjoyed this along with my second divine mixture, The Sure Thing, chamomile infused gin? YES PLEASE! Both of these were her recommendations and I am SO glad that I tried them. My counterpart always gets the Corpse Survivor #2 and it's his go-to drink anywhere we go. So there was no sampling anything new on his side, but it's still a fabulous drink. The environment tends to be good because they uphold a standard of who they want in their restaurant. More classy, no TV's tacked up on the wall for your eyes to linger upon when there is a lull in conversation. You just feel very ""cool"" when you're here. Unfortunately I have never dined here, but hopefully the opportunity arises! I will definitely keep making my rounds at The Drawing Room.",0.9971,0.707,0.233,0.06,0.5657806637806638
2012-04-09,4.0,"The handcrafted cocktail bug has bit me and after visiting Violet Hour and Barrelhouse Flat, The Drawing Room was next on my list. I was happy to hear that my friend picked this place as a stop for her bachelorette party. We had a party of 14  and a reservation for midnight on a Saturday. We had to wait a few minutes for the previous party to leave and were then led to a private room with conference-style seating. We felt fancy with the plush seating and sleek decorations! As soon as we sat down, we were given water and our server (Liz) came with menus. She gave us a minute to look it over, then explained a few of the popular drinks and told us that the bartender could make something if we didn't see anything we liked. One girl wanted something similar to a mojito, and Liz said they had a drink called The South Side that was not on the menu.  A few of us ordered The Avenue, which was a fruity and refreshing drink. We all loved it! I tasted my friend's Sure Thing (a chamomille-liquor infused drink) and was impressed. It tasted like tea and you could barely taste the alcohol, which is a plus in my book. I wish there was an updated menu on the website because I forget exactly what was in my drink.  Overall we had a great time and service was excellent. I will be back for sure to try more of the creative and delicious cocktails! I did take away one star because one unisex bathroom I used was disgusting! There was a urine lake all over the floor around the toilet and no way to step over it. I would have walked out but I had to go really bad and didn't want to wait in line again. Oh and like the Violet Hour, this is the kind of place to go with friends who can appreciate and enjoy good cocktails and are willing to pay $13 for a great drink.

Speaking of which, a few favorites were the Nooner (hehe), one with prosecco, gin and Peychaud's (the cocktail menu online hasn't been updated and I can't remember what it was called) and a Manhattan made with rum (weird, I know, but it was amazing).  It's always a good sign when you don't recognize any of the spirits on the cocktail list, and when they don't serve vodka (yay, a legit cocktail bar!) Re food, we did the 3 course prix fixe (using my Travelzoo deal).  Everything was pretty good, so I'll just list in order.  I started with the Carnitas ""Taco Salad"" with crispy pork shoulder, tomatillo and other latin accompaniments.  The pork was well seasoned and the ""salad"" (really more garnishes) were well paired.  For my main course I had the waygu flatiron steak.  The description sounded amazing: ramp-bone marrow butter, braised fennel, asparagus and preserved lemon.  The dish itself was, again, good.  The steak was fairly tender, however the butter tasted nothing like marrow.  It was a nice seasonal dish that worked well with the sort of cold, sort of spring weather we had.  I finished with the cinnamon gelato, I just couldn't resist when they mentioned it was Black Dog.  I had hoped they would add something to it (a cookie maybe?), but it was just gelato.  Delicious, nonetheless. My friend had the tempura mushrooms (it was supposed to be a terrine, but they were out of some ingredients, pet peeve), the halibut and the chocolate crème brulee.  She agreed the food was good but not the best she's had.

I prefer sitting at the bar, even though it's small, just so we can talk with master bartender Christina and Mea the apprentice bartender.  They are a very fun crew and don't seem to mind us being a bit foolish, I think of it as being charming but I'm sure they would disagree.  So like always after a great night of being border line stupid drunk we think we won't be welcomed next time for our behavior and every time we go back we slowly walk in and peak around the corner to see what face reactions we will get. It's usually the slight ""oh no"" smile with the side to side head motion and then a description of our antics.  It really wasn't our fault, I blame the Ah-Ah-Ah-Alcohol or the idea of 5 punchbowls.

As a vegetarian I didn't have as many options but everything was very good.

2012-02-28,5.0,"I came here about 3 years ago and then last week for Restaurant Week. Both times were wonderful. The Drawing Room is located in a trendy area of the Gold Coast, but it's not pretentious. Don't be fooled by the inconspicuous door out front with the doorman who inquires about your reservation before letting you enter. Once you go downstairs, you see low tables with plush seats and lots of dark wood with modern stone accents. It feels like a secret, swanky club, and you're on the VIP list. At least that's what the staff makes you feel like. The real star of The Drawing Room is the drinks. They have fancy cocktails with lots of house-made ingredients and garnishes. When our fantastic waitress told me that they make their own sour mix in house with fresh egg whites, I ordered a whiskey sour. I did not disappoint. My fiancé tried 3 different cocktails as pairings with each of his courses. 2 of the 3 contained gin, one of the only spirits I detest, but when I tried them, I could barely taste the gin at all. While the cocktails are the main attraction, the food is like a supporting actor that steals the show. Everything I've ever eaten here has been fantastic. The beef tartare is delicious, the short rib is so tender that it falls apart, and the airline chicken breast has a juicy center and skin so crispy it's sinful. But make sure you leave room for dessert! And when I say dessert, I mean the chocolate crème brûlée. It. is. to. die. for. In case that isn't your speed (which is impossible), they serve Black Dog Gelato. Just a word of advice about what to wear when you make a reservation, Yelp says ""dressy,"" but you're fine in a nice sweater and jeans. Make sure your jeans are a little loose so you have plenty of room for all the delicious food and booze you will consume. The Drawing Room has the whole package.

There is no quicker or surer way into my man's heart than a dish combining both alcohol and cheese. As expected, the BCS delivered like gangbusters.  Aside from the creamy and super fatty soup, he had the roasted vegetable tart and the lasagna. The tart looked amazing and tasted just as good. I thought there was a good chance it would be dry and bland but it was neither. I didn't get to steal any of his lasagna as he devoured every last bite. Glad to see Drawing Room doesn't skimp on the vegetarian dishes.  For my part, I had the winter greens salad, lemongrass mussels and monkfish. The salad was one of those great combos that I never make at home but always dream of one day replicating in my quest to become Gwenyth Paltrow. Pear, walnuts, chevre and a great dressing. Husband loved it, too. The mussels were delish but needed to  come with a big hunk of crusty bread for sopping up that amazing curry sauce! So yummy. My monkfish only made it partially into the gullet as I was pretty stuffed from what preceded it. The cannellini beans were my favorite part.  My intent was to skip dessert but DR had other plans. When husband notified our server of the special occasion, we were brought champagne and (I think) a really amazing creme brulee. Who am I to protest a (free!) dessert?!

It beats out Violet Hour for me, and that's not an easy thing to do in this town from the looks of it. It beats out my all-time favorite Gilt Bar. It's not in the same spectrum as the Aviary. These mixologists are magicians, and they know it, so they'll challenge you to keep it fun for them. Do you feel like having a long-lost drink from a menu you had 2 years ago that you only half-remember and haven't found since? Sure, they'll do it, and it'll be better than the original. Because that's what they do here - blow things out of the water, and then add a flaming piece of garnish for effect. Their own concoctions are really fabulous too, and my friend's Nooner is one of the most spectacular whisky cocktails (with Navan vanilla) either of us have ever tasted. Funny thing that this place can make everyone else's cocktails so well - no one can make the Nooner like they can. First time here, I had Eve's Answer, which was really beautiful and sweet - but not that fruity, and not syrupy - as a reco from the server. Hard to describe, but tequila based, and a definite tequila effect  to it. The most recent time, I got a drink that isn't on the menu: the Oaxaca. Burnt-glass reposado mezcal drink that tastes of pure smoke and summer. It's a remake of Gilt Bar's dearly departed Bee Sting done up special for my birthday. Happy birthday to me. That bartender wins at life. The service here is always so attentive and lovely. Really nice people who are smart about the stuff they serve, they go out of their way to make people happy and taken care of (which I cannot really say for the hotter places like Curio, which I want to like but can't), and treat everybody great. In some ways I feel like the out of the way location and hidden underground address help it stay a little bit of a secret late at night, and that's exactly why I keep coming here.  I get no cell phone signal, seeing as it is in a basement. Not that you need reception. It's an easy place to get lost in for awhile: a sultry, luxurious space with velvety chairs around low tables and dim lights. It invites a certain amount of seduction potential, which is not useful to me most of the time given that I'm usually here with the same girl I go everywhere with - but you never really know what will happen.

We weren't really sure where the door was at first, but quickly figured it out when we saw a man who so obviously looked like a high class bouncer hanging out in front of a door on the sidewalk. He checked our IDs and asked for our reservation, and then sent us down the stairs while warning them over the walkie that we were on our way. Our table was ready and waiting for us when we got down the stairs, and we sat down right away.  The atmosphere is lovely. Very warm and yet modern at the same time.

I wasn't thrilled with the way my chair was arranged, and so I stood up to move it, and by the time I had turned around, there was a staff member there to move the chair for me. I really appreciated that as I wasn't particularly equipped in my four inch heels to be moving furniture.  Like I said, the food was glorious. We started with a cucumber and lychee amuse bouche, which was fresh and a perfect palate cleanser. Then I had the salmon tartare, squash soup, vegetarian polenta napolean, and finished with the chocolate panna cotta with orange compote.

2012-01-03,5.0,"The Drawing Room is an incredible mixologist lounge than also happens to double as a fine-dining establishment. Or is it the other way around? Delicious restaurant that happens to have a dang good cocktail hour? I'm not quite sure. Sans reservations, we hit up The Drawing Room right as it opened and were lucky enough to stumble into bar seating with a party of 9. The downstairs trek from its clandestine entrance is exciting; the opaque white dimness of the space is enlightening. Our bartender, Charles, was absolutely phenomenal. He was knowledgeable without being condescending, a very rare trait for the new breed of ""mixologist"" infiltrating the Americas. Charles, I tip my cap to you. You're truly a master of your craft. The cocktail menu is seasonal, and if you have an intimate understanding of more than half the liquors displayed, you're either a drunk or an alcoholic. Or a mixologist! Seriously, there's some mystifying stuff on there. If you're confused or embattled, just ask Charles, and he'll guide you in the right direction. Tell him what you like, and he'll conjure up some liquid gold for you. As for me, I was immediately smitten by the Cohasset Punch #2: Pyrat XO (turns out to be a spiced rum) with Punt e Mes (an Italian vermouth) and an absolutely divine cinnamon syrup, aided by a twist of lemon. I don't normally drink rum, nor do I normally drink cocktails, but my mouth is salivating thinking about Mr. Cohasset. The kitchen menu is equally appealing. Like the cocktails, the food is seasonal. Despite sitting at the bar, we kept seeing dish after delightful dish being brought out and finally relented. We resisted to just two appetizers: tempura avocado and steak frites.

The 5-course pre-fixe menu started with a very simple amuse bouche of cucumber, litchi and an in-house prepared cracker that was tiny burst of flavors once we ate them. The first course was a simple salad, followed by the best butternut squash soup we've ever tasted. The main course was the highlight of the evening. It was a polenta cake napoleon on a bed of romesco sauce with mushrooms cooked to perfection and caramelized onions. I swear it was so good that I could've eaten two more orders of it.

2011-10-01,5.0,"Sorry Honey, I have a confession to make: I was gushing over Charles Joly when I had dinner at The Drawing Room with my friends. Not to worry though, it was probably the cocktails talking.  My friends and I attended the opening night of the Chicago art galleries over in River North. After a couple of hours, we were starving! We had a few choices. The Farmhouse was one of them, but unfortunately there was a wait due to its proximity to the galleries. Then a friend suggested that we go to The Drawing Room since it's ""never"" crowded. She was right: it wasn't crowded, and I don't understand why... unless the price is a big turn-off. Our dinner, cocktails included, came out to be around $75 per person including tips. Yikes! Now, before that night, I had no idea who Charles Joly is. I didn't even know that there was a TV show called America's Next Top Bartender. I mean, really, how many ""America's Next Top..."" shows can there be? Anyway, my friend told me about Charles Joly. She initially said that Charles Joly is her friend's boyfriend, so imagine my surprise when she didn't say hi to the guy. Apparently, she left out the word ""fantasy.""  I first ordered the Florodora. I wasn't pleased with it. I thought it was too frizzy and too fruity. Our awesome server noticed that I hadn't touched my drink in a while and asked if I'd like a different drink. I took him up on his offer, and he asked me what I usually drink-- vodka, rum, whiskey, etc. I said soju, and he asked me what I didn't like about the drink I had so I told him. He then told us that he'll be presenting this challenge to their chief mixologist, Charles Joly. A few minutes later, Charles Joly presented my drink to me himself. Now that I think about it, I should have taken a photo of it! He told me that he decided to take the savory route. The ingredients were as follow: Bombay gin, white (dry? i may have heard wrong) vermouth, celery bitters, lemon sour (? I may have gotten this wrong... but it has egg-white in it), and a fresh piece of thyme. It was amazing! So amazing in fact that I ordered another one immediately after... AND got my friends to want MY drink as well as presenting Charles Joly with new challenges (and also to get him to come back to our table. Ha!). We said that he should name the drink after me, but it didn't take. Darn! However amazing the cocktails at The Drawing Room, the food was at least on par. We ordered: For appetizers: - Steak frites. This was good, but it was probably one of my least favorite dish because I've had better steak tartar at the Market Bistro. I also wasn't too fond of the potato-steak-tartar combination. And our waiter lied to us when he said they don't have bread (you'll see why I said this later on). What? - Avocado tempura. Amazing! Who knew that you could deep fry avocados?? Ok, well, I guess you can deep fry anything, but you know what I mean! The avocado just melts in your mouth. Delicious! Second course: - Shellfish a la Nage. This was good, but not entirely amazing. I liked it a lot. It reminded me a little bit of boo-yah baze, and I think there's where I'm a little put off by it. There was no meat in this though, nor were there any okras. Third course / main dish:  - Rainbow Trout with herb soft polenta, heirloom tomatoes, crispy parmesan, pea tendrils, lemon-olive oil. Possibly my favorite part of the meal. The skin was crispy, and the trout was fresh. What more can you asked for? It was delicious, and the tomatoes were so fresh and juicy!

2011-08-21,3.0,"Longest-dinner-of-my-life! Oh my goodness, this dinner took forever. My friends and I went to celebrate our friend's birthday on Friday and had 730 reservations. Two friends got there at 730 and opted to sit at the bar until we arrived at 745. They both ordered drinks and when we were sat at 750, one had got her drink but the other had paid her bill and didn't get her drink until 5 minutes after we sat down. So, about 20 minutes for her cocktail. We understand the cocktails have a lot of homemade ingredients so they must have harvesting the oats before putting them in my friend's drink. It was like this through all of dinner, literally 30 minute waits between completing each course and when the next was brought out. That includes before dessert. We waited 30 minutes for our dessert, seriously ridiculous. In all, we ended up spending three hours at The Drawing Room for appetizers, main course and dessert. These insane waits brought The Drawing Room down a star. Especially since the restaurant was not even fully seated. Let's focus on the positive. The Drawing Room is hidden next to Le Colonial and you have to go down a stairwell to reach it. It's a pretty cool layout inside! I loved that it was a downtown (well---near north side) restaurant that had some breathing room. Tables aren't stacked on top of each other like so many of the other chic places in the city. We were seated at a nice 6 person table which reminded us of a family dining table. It was kind of in a sectioned off area with another table of six seated beside us. It was nice to have our own little section like that. The entire place had a warm and inviting atmosphere with classy decor that I was sure promised amazing food to follow! My friends and I did the Prix Fixe G-Dine menu which was $37 each including tax & tip but not including drinks. I order a diet coke which came in a small glass bottle (see picture) and cost $5! Goodness high prices gracious! For our GDine menu, we got to pick from 3 items for 3 courses and the choices looked pretty darn good. I started with the Steak Frites which were amazing! They came with a pile of beef tartare which when you took a little of that, half a potato piece and some truffle mayo made for some amazingness in your mouth. Four of my friends got the same appetizer and we all agreed it was fantastic! Every one of us cleaned our plate completely. For my main course, I got the breaded spiced portabella. I'm a huge mushroom fan, and in particular portabellas. I could eat them every day, nomnomnom. This dish fell short for me though. The portabella tasted a bit soggy and the accompaniments just did nothing for the dish. I ended up only eating the mushroom portion. If I had to pick a main course next time, I would opt for the amish chicken instead. It looks delicious! Finally for dessert, I had the lavender corn gelato. The concept sounded cool! I've had corn ice cream before and lavender gelato...Truth is that how the flavors should stay. They don't mesh well at all. It really was not good at all. None of us who got it liked it one bit, plus we had everyone at the table try it. Gross. Honestly, I love trying new foods and am an adventurous eater but this just was not appealing on any level.  Overall, appetizer was amazing, main course was meh, dessert was gross. Service was very friendly but slowest I've ever experienced. They have some innovative cocktails which are $13 each. I recommend going here if you want a reallt drawn out meal. Keep in mind I spent 3 hours here with my friends for 3 courses. It was a decent meal but I don't see myself going back here unless it's just for drinks.",0.9993,0.756,0.214,0.03,0.5721160130718952
2011-08-14,4.0,"Came here on a random Wednesday night for dinner and drinks.   I thought it was a little over the top that I had to let the hostess at the door know I was there for a reservation, then for her to call the hostess at the bottom of the stairs to tell her I was there for a reservation.  Really??  Its  a Wednesday night. So the atmosphere is sexy and sultry.  It reminds me of a place you can go and cheat on your significant other without anyone seeing you.  Why did I get this vibe?  I have no idea.  Maybe it was the older gentleman with the teenage looking girl in the corner that was ready to get it on at the table....of course, I was the first to arrive so I had to entertain myself by looking around a little bit :)   The tables and chairs are the most awkward thing I have ever sat in.  So the chairs are too big to fit under the table and the base of the table is too large to put your feet in any comfortable position....AWKWARD!  Its like a weird, round base that was not fun for three girls trying to sit at the table. The drink list is amazing.  I wish I would have tried more.  So we had the Florodora, The Holdup, and Absolute Tea Time.  All were fantastic.  The food was great as well....steak frites and the scallop ceviche to start.  Both apps were delicious.  Then the rainbow trout to end.  Everything was great.

2011-08-03,4.0,"I have to say I was quite surprised by how much I liked The Drawing Room. I had been there once before for cocktails (which are spectacular; however, they treat everyone like tourists who have never had nice cocktails before), but finally came to eat this past Tuesday night. With an impending storm, there were more people at the restaurant than I thought. The crowd ranged greatly in age. The décor was good; however, the most particularly great part about the décor was the seats which were velour and seemed to be mini fainting chairs - very comfortable. And, they looked like mini-couches when pushed together. For drinks, I started with a cocktail, the Pennsy Co. (a wonderfully balanced and frothy bourbon cocktail which the waiter greatly recommended as a good first drink), and my boyfriend had the Great Lake porter (always a winner). We ended up ordering a good tasting and extremely reasonably-priced glass of red ($8, Garnacha) afterward. Oh, and we were given an Apertif when we sat down. For service - one word, exceptional. For food, we debated for a while but decided to both do the three-course dinner selection for $49 that is always offered ($7 more for the rib-eye). One great thing is that you can choose anything on the menu and portions are surprisingly large. One bad thing, especially for a person who does not eat meat, is that they were out of a lot of options, particularly the seafood options. We had the following. FIRST COURSE Beet soup with mushrooms and a pesto center:  Good but I thought it had too much citrus; however my boyfriend thought the pesto cut the citrus nicely. Saikou Salmon (sushi grade New Zealand salmon, thin sliced raw snap peas, cucumber, Sriracha-citrus sauce, basil, palm heart):  HANDS DOWN WINNER. This was exceptional. The salmon was so smooth, the sauce was delicious, and the snap peas added great texture. We will remember this dish. SECOND COURSE Bacon2:  Smelled great and it looked like a pork sushi roll. My boyfriend would recommend not getting the pork as your main after this one. Salad with grapefruit, brioche-like croutons, etc.: Overdressed and fine (besides the croutons which were like less sweet Twinkies), but I had no other choice THIRD COURSE Rib-eye (sugar snap peas (?), cauliflower puree):  Good but a little too much going on. Plus my boyfriend said it was a little fatty. Rainbow Trout (pink-peppercorn crisped skin, semolina fried gnocchi, baby beets, peas, pea tendrils, St. Germaine white gazpacho sauce):  Really flavorful, and again the sauce made it. The skin was exceptionally good, and the gnocchi was crispy and still melted in your mouth.",0.9987,0.76,0.217,0.023,0.5562775825706858
2011-08-02,2.0,"Unimpressed - kind of disappointed since many reviewers mentioned the superior cocktail service. It was a decidedly adequate cocktail experience, seasoned with a healthy dose of euro-trash cheese from the decor and general ambiance. I felt positively under dressed without any gold chains or European jeans with pocket flaps.  I ordered the twelve-fifteen - kind of a cross between a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned with a side of maple syrup. I should have known better - too many things going on so it just came out muddled.  We had a couple of appetizers to munch on, and I must say that the Tempura Avocado was kind of tasty. Otherwise, I'd say this menu is trying too hard.  Service was lackadaisical - it was a 1/3 full room when we were there (6pm on a Saturday) and still had trouble getting service. The lack of attention was problematic - and no, it wasn't that the waiter was trying to give us enough ""space"" to enjoy our cocktails. It was that he wasn't around much.  I must say though that the Dressing Room fit right into our impromptu cheesy over the top pub crawl - we started at Trump, then the Drawing Room, and finally dinner at the bar at Gibson's. All cheese, all the time. Kind of fun, but no need to go back to either the Drawing Room or Trump. Gibson's is still good for a few laughs though.",0.8688,0.826,0.105,0.069,0.4970677759740259

My parents were in town and, although they aren't big drinkers, they love a great atmosphere so I took them here. Never been here before but I read the Yelp reviews and it seemed like a cool place. My parents only had one drink each (my boyfriend and I had two). My dad paid with his credit card and we left. The next morning, my dad realized he's left his card there. I called but they said they wouldn't be open again until Tues., which was fine. I told my dad I'd Fedex him his card. Tues. rolls around. I call and the girl that answers tells me that I need to talk to the manager who won't be in until 6 on Wed. but I can call his office number and leave him a message. Turns out the office number is the same as the main number?  I call at 6 PM on Wed. and the girl that answers tells me the manager isn't in but she'll give him a message as he should be in by 8 PM. At 10 PM, after hearing nothing, I call and ask for the manager. He tells me there is 60 cards to look through but he's ""pretty sure my dad's name isn't one of them."" Since he said that 5 seconds after answering the phone, I assume he didn't look through them. I tell him if he does't have time to look through them, I could come by after work tomorrow and look through them myself.  The manager (Michael), tells me no, he's pretty sure it's not there.  There are two things I am sure of: 1. My dad's card is there 2. Michael didn't give a shit and didn't bother to look through them.

My friend and I shared a few small plates and had two cocktails each. We loved the unique flavors of everything that passed through the doors of our lips. My positive first kiss of food and drink with The Drawing Room left me wanting more. I've been dying to share the sophisticated basement lounge with my potable highbrow girlfriend. She finally gave in last night. I ordered a divine cocktail that mixed fresh ginger with Bourbon in a high-glass. Miss GF asked about Bourbons and was pleased that there were several offerings of her favorite Black Maple Hill brand. Initially she ordered one, but the server dropped a tantalizing additional detail that had her exchange it for the rye 23 year - a true rarity. The server was an angel who did the swap and only charged us for the latter. I came away elated that I was able to turn such a skeptic into someone who eagerly wants her frequent dining card at the Drawing Room.

Pros: nice ambiance, great people-watching (especially when the gentleman at the next table is hosting two pros), great server (whose name I didn't get, but she was great at describing the cocktails), clean, not as touristy as I expected, and I think that's because it's tucked away. Cons: what is going on with those kindergartener-height tables and chairs? I imagine it's uncomfortable for tall people, but it's equally uncomfortable for ladies in cocktail dresses. Why? Because when you're sitting in the otherwise comfortable chairs, if your feet are flat on the floor, you end up giving any passersby a look up your dress because your bottom is lower than your knees. Get it? Also, I wish there were more of a sound barrier between Drawing Room and whatever dance party is going on next door.

2011-05-24,4.0,"Ok, I have to say it first off. There's no way around it. Our server at The Drawing Room was BOMBED! I mean, totally, blatantly, wasted drunk! Really. Now, normally I wait until the end of the post to talk about service since I view the food as the most important aspect of the restaurant, but this is just too good to hold back. From the time we sat down, he was a little, well... off. At first we thought maybe he just wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer or perhaps he was just a little slow due to some other reason, maybe a medication or something. But by the time we got our drinks (which was not quickly) and we began to inquire about some of the menu items, it became strikingly clear that this guy was just good ol' fashioned, sloppy drunk. I'm not exactly sure what tipped us off...it could have been the 2 F-bombs he dropped in one slow, slurred description of the rib-eye steak. Yeah, I think that was it. Or, it could have been any of the other odd behavior like silently stopping at our table to push the silverware around like he was trying to tidy up the table setting, but missed. Or maybe it was that he rang the wrong drink and delivered it to me... TWICE....in a row....after I pointed out that it was, in fact, not what I had ordered. Yes, indeed, totally smashed. And eventually, someone else caught on to his shenanigans because, none too soon, I spotted him walking through the dining room, untying his apron, as he headed for the exit. The manager closed out our table and discussed our 'experience' with us. He was very apologetic and kind. We assured him that it had added an interesting dynamic to our dining experience and since he hadn't screwed anything up too badly, it had also given us something to laugh about. He tried to comp our entire bill but when we insisted that that wasn't at all necessary, he comped half instead. I'm sure he was mortified. Had the food not been as good as it was, we might have not been able to laugh it off as we did. But the food was great, so we were happy. First, the salad: arugula, poached pear, goat cheese, coriander walnuts, celery root vinaigrette. It was wonderful. Fresh and light and well balanced. It had sweet and salty and acidic and spicy and nutty and creamy ... all playing so nicely together. It was kind of the perfect salad. Then the braised oxtail with red onion marmalade, aged Cheddar and grilled sourdough. Beside the fact that neither one of us gathered any information from the menu that led us to believe that there was going to be a sandwich on our plate, we were so pleased. We confirmed with one another that the description needed help, but that it was so good, we didn't care. The pulled oxtail was rich and deep and soaked into the toasty, butter-grilled bread while the onions were a sweet but bright bite necessary to counter them. It also had a little shallot, herb salsa on the side, which reminded me of a light version of a mignonette that added a nice little zip to the rest of the richness happening on the plate. Delicious! On the last course, unfortunately, we felt the wrath of our sloppy server a bit. We'd ordered the 'F-ing fantastic' rib-eye along with a side of veggies of the day, which happened to be sautéed yellow squash and zucchini with onions and goat cheese. I knew something was up when the wait between the second and third courses was EXTREMELY exaggerated compared to that between the first and second courses. When it arrived, I had a clear understanding of why. The steak that we'd ordered med-rare was much closer to medium and quite cool while the squash were so under cooked that some were just plain ol' raw. Dang! Drunky McDrunkerson had forgotten to ring the side of veg and didn't realize it until the steak was already done and in the window. They had to hold the steak while they threw the squash together as fast as they could. Thus, overcooked, cool rib-eye; undercooked, bitter squash. Total bummer too, because the meat was quite tasty and I sure wouldn't have minded if it was a bit more bloody and juicy. Not terrible but considering how well prepared our first two courses came out, I'm positive that this could have been a lot better. The steak's presentation could have used some help as well, since the combination of beet puree and some interesting tamarind steak sauce evoked a sense of 'the scene of the crime.' But the meat itself was quite tender and tasty as were the sautéed asparagus and fingerling potatoes that accompanied it. I had a couple of issues with the ambiance of The Drawing Room.  I found it to be a little uncomfortable and awkward. In creating a super cool, modern look, I think they forgot to consider functionality. First, the tables were so low that it that one would think the restaurant's target clientele was fourth graders. The 3, poor 6-foot men in the room seemed to have to tangle their legs into a little pile in order to cram them under the table.

I am a non-drinker but this is a bar I actually feel comfortable in.  There is a selection of non-alcoholic cocktails that are created with as much care as the boozy options.  I think some people are put off by the cost of the food because they think it is too much for bar food, but it is NOT bar food--this thankfully is one of the few places in town that is trying to buck the trend of upscale bar food and small plates.  What the Drawing Room offers is fine dining with bar hours-- a godsend for people in the restaurant industry who, after waiting on douche bags all night, basically just want someone to wait on us.   Definitely go for the prix fixe menu.  Also note that reservations are required.",0.9932,0.762,0.222,0.015,0.3892857142857143

2011-04-24,4.0,"Things started off rocky at the Drawing Room for me. Lucky for them things got better so they went from a 1 star to a 4 star rating. Initially when I approached the DOOR (its an underground restaurant/bar so there's only a door to recognize the place) there was a guy (the valet parking guy?) asking me if I had a reservation. Apparently if I didnt have a reservation he would not have let me in. After I had told him yes, he asked for the name on the reservation.  After I had told him the name on the reservation, he finally let me in. What was ridiculous was that he did not even have a list of names for the reservations he was questioning me about! An employee was walking up the stairs as I was walking down the stairs and thats when valet guy asks the employee if my friends name was on the reservation. WTF? If this place is known for their drinks, and has a bar, why would I need a reservation to come here to begin with? That totally annoyed me!! Then, after we got seated, it took about 10 minutes for someone to approach us or to hand us menus. There was an employee that did notice us because I noticed him asking who was serving us.  Even he noticed that we had been ignored for some time!! Finally, after the neglect, someone came up to us. I still dont know the name of our server because she never introduced herself to us. Oh well.  The service from her was good so no complaints there. As for the food, it was pretty good. The Drawing Room is known for their drinks and luckily for me they served NON-alcohol mixed drinks as well. I ordered the Hera's Crown which had pomegranate and citrus juice. It was delicious.  But even before our meal arrived, we received sample drinks in small shot glasses. NICE TOUCH. For our meal we started off with the bacon squares, and for entrees we ordered the veal cheeks and duck pecan pie. Everything was delicious.  We thought the portions would be small but they were actually of decent size. We were full by the end. Their desserts did not sound that great so we opted not to have any. The atmosphere here was weird for a dining experience. It felt more like a lounge/club with the TINY seats and tables.  But overall it was still quite comfortable for us and we enjoyed the experience!",0.9642,0.852,0.098,0.05,0.6684587813620071

Thank you, company, for sponsoring all of our alcoholic intake, and the twenty shots we took when someone said they wanted to sign! It was a very memorable evening for all of us. They set aside one of the more detached rooms so we could mingle about without falling into the low tables where diners were eating. I've also been here using my  restaurant.com  certificate (sitting in the aforementioned low tables: ladies, make sure to wear the appropriate skirt) and enjoying the different appetizer plates and the mixed cocktails. When I was here on a low key Tuesday night, the server promptly delivered us a tasting of a mixed cocktail (aviation? not 100% sure) so we could start the evening out in a spirited manner. I would come here again anytime. Well-priced for the area and close to me. How could you go wrong? Just remember to dress up and not dress down.",0.7226,0.83,0.096,0.074,0.491967291967292

I had a Gloomlifter, which was so delicious I had two more. This drink was so good, it tasted a bit reminiscent of pink lemonade, but much much better. My significant other did a Manhattan and another rye whiskey drink, but after one sip of my Gloomlifter he and I were sold that this was the best drink. We did the steak tartare and fried avocado for the first course. Steak tartare was the clear winner here. The fried avocado, while novel, ultimately kinda just tasted like guacamole. Second course: hazelnut-crusted quail and ox melt. Oh my god ox melt. The best type of grilled cheese you'll ever have. Let it also be noted that the ox melt was a meal on it's own basically. Third course: I got the scallops, the boy got a steak. Scallops were overcooked, steak was overcooked, risotto was oversalted. This was very sad, as up until the third course, this whole evening was a great food experience. My recommendation: get drinks and more appetizer-like courses, and steer away from the entrees. The thing that knocks this review to 3 stars is the service. The bartenders were awesome. While we sat there, they chatted with us, recommended drinks based on what we liked, explained technique. Pretty awesome. And I liked that the feel wasn't pretentious, you could actually see the bar from all parts of the room, and the drinks tasted really good (unlike a certain other artisan cocktail Chicago hotspot).

So ok, not a great start, but at that point I had no reason doubt that the reason for our reservation being late was out of their control.  After about 25 minutes I realized that every table was full and not a single person had any food in front of them.  It was about that time that I was told that the kitchen was now running behind and it would be at least another 30 minutes before they would be able to seat us...  It's also worth mentioning that at that point in time, there were about 15-20 people that were all waiting for their reservations and had not yet received a table.  I've worked as a waiter and as a bartender, so I know sometimes things go wrong, but this was ridiculous.   Here's what I think happened:  I think that they WAY overbooked the restaurant and then could only accommodate about half of the people that showed up.  Since it was going to be almost 10PM before we might potentially have been seated, we paid for our drink and left.

2011-03-04,5.0,"it was THE PERFECT dinner place for us!!  despite its small space, the server and management were very friendly and cooperative in accommodating our large bacherlorette party group of 14.  we loved the ambiance and the service was superb. the food was served timely and the server never frowned once as he repeated himself multiple times to our chatty and inattentive group.  we ordered from the 3-course restaurant week menu. i placed a (*) by items i personally LOVED and would highly recommend.  for appetizers:  steak frites - loved the seasoning on the beef but it is pretty raw (very slightly seared) and cooler temperature-wise, so beware.  escargot - although i prefer mine with less prominent sauce to bring out the flavor, these little critters were delish!  fried avocado - a creative and yummy way to serve avocados!!  for entrees:  * veal cheeks - DELICIOUS!! the meat was super tender, literally melted in my mouth. it was seasoned perfectly and the vegetables added just the right amount of complimentary flavor variation.  braised pork osso bucco - another WINNER! again, the meat was super tender. unavoidably because it's pork, it was a little more gamy than the beef but nonetheless, it was yummy!  for dessert:  * white chocolate blood orange bread pudding - this dessert combined all of my favorite desserts! i was very impressed at how fluffy the bread pudding was and not soggy!  perfectly paired it with a cup of coffee.  YUM! profiteroles - after we all took lesson on how to pronounce it properly, we tasted it. and to our delight, the cream bursted with flavors of rum? or brandy?  all in all, it was a very successful dining experience and would love to return to try out different items on their regular menu!",0.9988,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.6232274032274033
2011-02-27,4.0,"I'll get my gripes out of the way 1st. The chairs we sat in were super awkward.  They were low to the ground cushiony style but only had an arm rest on one side.  I mean, this by no means broke the meal, but I was kind of like, ""chair, what's up?"" ... then I forgot about it, but throughout the meal was reminded of chair and his awkward ways. Also, I think it was because of how low the chairs were, but every time our server spoke to us, he'd breathe really hard on my head.  It made me feel uncomfortable, so as he spoke, I couldn't listen.  I just kept thinking..... ""breath... on my head... ew."" Next gripe: I got a butternut squash soup.  It was strange.  I suppose the ingredients may have made it that way (what else could it be really...), it included fennel and feta cheese, which I think gave it a really sharp taste.  The way the flavors blended together made it an odd tasting soup, and that can be verified by my friend who tasted it as well. Alrighty now that that's over. !!! For my main dish I had a vegan polenta.  By no means am I vegan, but it sounded so yummy and yummy it was!!!! There were so many flavors on my plate ranging from something curryesque, cornmeal, kale,  a fruity taste, and some other sauces or marinades.  All the flavors combined made it so good, and it was hard for me to not eat the whole plate, even though I was probably full after the first two bites (it was a big eating day for me). I also sampled their pork and veal cheeks.  Both were SO good, melt in your mouthy-scrumptiousness. For dessert, I had something that starts with a P.  We were all trying to pronounce it and I have a feeling none of us got it right.  I think it was ""profiteroles"" ... anyway, I was a fan, mostly because there was ice cream involved.  Very rarely am I not a fan when there's ice cream involved (there was one time, but I don't like to talk about it) ... but anyway.  I loved the ice cream and chocolate sauce, and then it was like almond-filled cream puffs.  They were ok.  I didn't eat one of them.   So TO CONCLUDE (i feel that when people make concluding statements, they should yell them loudly to let everyone know it's almost over) ... The main dishes are where it's at here.  Avoid the awkward chairs (I think you have other choices than the plush low to ground ones) and I'd stay away from the squash soup.

2011-02-25,4.0,"We absolutely loved the ambiance and vibe of this restaurant.  Down a flight of stairs, the restaurant was cozy but luxurious and inviting. The tables are low with plush corner seats; a table of 4 created almost a faux booth when the 4 chairs are pushed together.  We were attracted by the restaurant week menu, and sold on the cocktail list.  The plates were fresh and creative, with perfectly sized portions,not too small,but not overwhelming. A small stack of plates in the center of the table was a nice touch for anyone generous enough to share.  The staff was very welcoming and we were seated almost immediately.  Our server was casual, friendly, and happily accommodated our special requests (FYI - there are several gluten free options on the menu!). Our only complaint was that the cocktails were a bit extreme.  We were initially intrigued by the creative mixes, but  once there, we felt that the mixologists were trying a little too hard with a lot of excessive or extravagantly odd ingredients.  Our biggest complaint was the liquor used in each drink was noted by brand name and not type (vodka, rum, brandy, etc.), and didn't say how the drink was served (on the rocks, straight up, martini, etc.).  We were adventurous and blindly ordered a variety of cocktails, which ended up being hit or miss.  We had a few light, crisp and delicious drinks, but were also blasted by a few overly potent hair-on-your-chest killers.",0.9954,0.685,0.247,0.068,0.591076516076516
2011-02-24,2.0,"Well, I am not the best person to write reviews for the typical yelper because I feel like everyone writes generally good reviews and I usually an disappointed by places that are highly yelped reviewed.  This place fits the bill, so to speak. But I will get to the bill later. Food was mediocre like most river north spots. Not any more or less mediocre than other places in my beloved neighborhood, just sort of on par for the putting green that is the river north food scene.  The much vaunted cocktails were better than most places around, and provided the highlight of our experience. Bill comes, I had ordered a la carte and my fiancé did the restaurant week. We had a livingsocial coupon (really, in retrospect the only way I would ever go here), and offered it to the waiter. He comes back and says, sorry not accepted.  I ask for the manager, who is less than helpful and more than robotic in parroting what apparently is the party line. I work in the hospitality industry and I know that If someone complains, it's costs nothing to appease them, given the cost of running a restaurant. They however felt that doing nothing was a better way of conducting themselves and even after a bad yelp review was brought up (apparently in addition to not understanding that restaurants and hotels provide a commodity and the difference is how customers feel is the difference between the four seasons and the motel 6, they don't understand the power of yelp), they told us to pound salt and pay the full bill which came to around 80 bucks. Let me remind you it was a mediocre meal.  So basically this place ranked up there in the special olympics that is river north eateries in terms of food/drink, but clearly they missed the boat in customer service. Walk a couple blocks down and eat at gibsons. Then read my review about how shitty it is that gibsons doesn't have fountain soda :)",0.5045,0.853,0.079,0.067,0.5076073762838468

For some reason, I had a different expectation than what was delivered. We arrived late-ish, around 11 pm to find that there wasn't really a line at the door and the place was a bit on the empty side. We opted for a lounge chair instead of sitting at the bar, perhaps my mistake? We were ordering a few bites since we had an early dinner and a show and definitely wanted to check out some drinks. We ended up with three dishes and two drinks, both of which were horrible. The food part was good, but a little pricey, you do pay for the location. However, I asked the waitress to give me a creative gin drink and she picked something off the menu. It was really gross, so much that I had to get another one because it was just undrinkable. The 2nd one was better but still kind of terrible. Bf's drink was ok, but he didn't like it too much either.

2011-02-18,2.0,"Came here on Valentine's day and was shocked by what I was greeted with: 60 minute wait when I had a reservation that I was on time for (10 minutes early actually). Also don't lie and say 30 minutes when you sure as hell can see the 7 other couples waiting for reservations  I usually don't care about this stuff but on a Monday night when I have to work the next day this sucks. The icing on the cake being that they made this reservation a HUGE deal - multiple calls to confirm, credit card number, making sure I was ordering from the pre-set menu. So why make me feel like this reservation is as special as a white house dinner just to end up standing at the bar for an hour (no seats available since 14 other people were waiting for overdue reservations)? Now I have to show both sides of the coin: once we did actually sit down it was damn good. The edamame and spearmint foam soup was unreal. The dishes were complicated but not too contemporary that I couldn't even figure out the menu. And as everyone else knows the drinks are excellent (but expensive). The ""bitters"" they use to make the drinks unique and strong are fun - orange, celery, citrus, etc. The celery, grape juice and wine combination was absolutely amazing. I would suggest bringing your smart phone/dictionary to type in all the ingredients so you know what type of liquor is in each drink (the drink menu uses all Eponyms and buzz words so it's like reading another language). I would have given the place a 4-5 out of 5 on food alone but the service was a 0 out of 5 and the main dish wasn't cooked to my liking. It was a duck confit dish that was cooked rare. I haven't had rare duck before found it a bit chewy. I think medium rare would have taken some of that chewiness and gumminess out of the meat.",0.9915,0.801,0.154,0.045,0.5327188940092166

When you walk downstairs it's a very chic, new yorkish feel. The seats are low and the lighting is dim. We had drinks at the bar first. I would go just to watch the mixologists make the drinks. I got this girly drink first and my boyfriend got something with rum in it. No idea what we ordered but it was yummy. All the drinks have ingredients I've never heard of but they aren't too strong in flavor, well balanced but you don't need many! We sat down and ordered a goat cheese salad and fried avocado....both amazing. Then we had a drink called a southern (not on the menu but if you tell them what your liquor of choice is they will make u a bomb ass drink). The service was kinda slow, I'm gonna say it was bc it was valentines day but I don't know, I need to give it another shot. I ordered the Polenta Cakes with cashews, cauliflower puree, chutney and kale. AMAZING! My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Squared but they ran out of Pork Belly so he had bacon wrapped scallops instead. He didn't seem too impressed.  Overall, I give the place 4 out of 5.

It seems there was some miscommunication, and while our reservation was at 11, we were told we could show up at 10:30 for drinks.  I'll chalk this one up to simple mis-communication, and say this was our fault. 2) With an 11pm reservation, we weren't seated until 11:40.  They weren't particularly apologetic - simply saying there was nothing they could do until the other party left.  No drinks or concessions were offered. 3) Dinner came with a champagne toast at midnight.  Champagne was served about 12:05.  Whoops. 4) Speaking of midnight... no countdown, announcement or anything. 5) When we went to pay the bill, 3 of our cards were rejected.  Apparently Citi's network was down or something...  Again, not their fault, but it added to a less-than-5-star experience.

2010-12-20,4.0,"After a long day of christmas shopping, we found ourselves a stone's throw away from The Drawing Room.  Having wanted to try this place for quite some time, we decided to make this the capstone to our shopping excursion.   We had the address thanks to the phone-ternet, so finding the door was not difficult.  Once we entered the lounge, we both immediately felt underdressed (i.e. dressed for the sub-freezing weather in big coats and boots, etc) but we did not feel mis-treated due to it. We were seated in some odd chairs at a small table, hugging a square column, which meant that if we both leaned back in our chairs at the same time, we wouldn't be able to see each other anymore, which was strange, but we didn't mind leaning forward slightly. The menu was smaller than I had imagined, and many of the liquors were things that I wasn't familiar with (Maker's Mark being a notable exception) so we would have appreciated a bit more attention from our server. We did receive a cocktail amuse, which was lovely; a little double-shot glass full of some deliciousness while we decided. I chose the Burlesque L'Amour, which was actually quite savory.  I loved it, I thought it was refreshing but still complex and interesting.  Bf had the ""nooner"" modified with rye to become the ""12:15"".  I don't think he liked his drink as much as I liked mine; I wasn't crazy about his either.  The menu indicated that maple syrup was an ingredient, and unless they used somehow the tiniest drop, I tasted no syrup.  In fact, there was no sweetness to the drink whatsoever.  It was quite boozy and lacking depth. My drink was fantastic, though, so I had a lovely time. I will say that the decor seemed a bit anachronistic to me (or, to be blunt, out-dated).  It felt somewhat early 2000s to me, a bit pretentious and too-cool-for-school.  It was dark, but not too dark, I thought. With Violet Hour in our neighborhood, we wouldn't come back here, unless we happened to be in the area.  If you're looking for a masterfully crafted cocktail and the choice is between The Drawing Room and the Violet Hour, I'd pick Violet Hour every time.",0.9882,0.827,0.125,0.048,0.4820175438596491

My fellow Violet Hour lover and me went to this place and after erroneously walking down a sketchy back ally to try and find this place we finally found it... being the guide I felt stupid for having walked by it twice before finding it. Overall I think the atmosphere is lovely and the design is very upscale although my friend said it wasn't her style. Our focus of the night was on their cocktails and after having four of them between us we decided that while they were good, we liked the Violet Hour better. I know it is a never ending battle between which place is better but for us it is the good ol' VH.

2010-10-31,4.0,"I really wanted to give The Drawing Room a 5, but there were just a couple things that take it down a notch. The good: - Drinks. I agree with all the raves below, you come here for the drinks. I just love watching them prepare drinks at the bar, the crisp clinking of ice cubes in the shakers puncturing an otherwise sleepy atmosphere (we were there on a Thursday night, so it was kind of slow). Definitely take time to talk with the waitress with regards to what you like to drink, they're very knowledgeable. Even my ginger lemonade was refreshing.  - Food. Drawing Room's food is quite fantastic as well, and if I were to rate this place based on food alone, it would be five stars. Given that this starving grad student has not had anything decent beyond noodles and spaghetti, every item I sampled was worthwhile. The truffle mayo makes the steak frites pure heaven. We also had the duck pecan pie and hazelnut crusted quail. There's definitely heavy French influence in the cuisine, all the ingredients work well together The minuses: - Small portions. Even the largest plates leave some room to be desired.  - Slow service. We were there on a sleepy night and even then it took the waitress forever to serve us, get back to us, and bring us the check.  - Music. Normally I don't really listen to the music people play in the restaurant, but this one was just a little offbeat enough to make me notice. I don't think it really fit the vibe they were going for - Seating. The seats at The Drawing Room are low and there are some corner seats - I was at one of them.

But alas, I went, and I'm so glad I did.  They are famous for their mixology, and that did not disappoint.  Much like a sommelier at many restaurants, The Drawing Room has a drink guy who comes around and helps you pick drinks.  And the general waitress was very knowledgeable as well.  And instead of an amuse bouche, you get a little shot sized drink!  So fun!  The Midnight Mary was a fresh martini version of a Bloody Mary, and the Beachcomber was delicious.  The boy had the Manhatten and the Old Fashioned, and especially liked the Old Fashioned. But what makes The Drawing Room stand out is that the tastiness doesn't stop with the drinks.  The food was absolutely delicious.  DO NOT PASS UP THE STEAK FRITES.  First glance says $13 fries.  Omg, no.  The beef tartar on them is amazing, and it meshes so well with the truffle mayo, a combo you wouldn't normally think of if it weren't for the fries tying it all together.  We also really enjoyed the pomegranate shrimp appetizer.  Then for main courses we opted to each have something from the middle section of the menu, which is considered large appetizers or small mains.  Oh my gosh it was more than enough food.  The bacon squared has a really mouthwatering texture and is lots of meat to fill you up, and the ox melt sandwich is both good and gigantic for a sandwich.  Mmmm, my mouth is watering thinking about it all!",0.9893,0.812,0.154,0.034,0.5834485407066052
2010-10-29,2.0,"How to begin this review. We came here because a friend gave us a groupon. The first adjective I would use to describe this place is silly. The girl at the door makes us feel like it is a big deal to come inside and has to walkie talkie downstairs to make sure we have a reservation. We do, but we are a bit early. She let us know that the bar was full but that they had a table open. Thank god, because what were they going to have us do otherwise? Stand outside? Downstairs is a cocktail lounge, not a restaurant really, with generic lounge music playing in the background. They seat you at these low cocktail tables at tables with large bases that make it awkward to find a place to put your feet. In general it just seems like everything has been designed to be pretentious cool, but ends up just being cumbersome. For example, the bathrooms aren't labeled--as either bathrooms or with sexes--fine, but it means you have to find staff to ask where they are. When you go inside, there are no paper towels anywhere to be seen beside the sink--there's just a strange shelf/box above head level, so you have to stand on your tiptoes to remove this box lid and then reach in for paper towels. On to food and drink. Our waiter was very helpful with questions we had about several of the obscure alcohols in the cocktails this place is known for. I got a bourbon cocktail with orange, bitters, and some slight vanilla flavor. I thought it might be too sweet, but it was very nice. They mixed up a gin and citrus concoction for my husband that was good. However, my drink filled a third of the glass, my husband's filled half of his glass, and looking around, others had full drinks in their coupe glasses. A third drink, a gin and tonic was mixed with house made tonic that was very interesting (and filled to the top). I'd have liked to explore the cocktail menu some more (and had a full glass of my drink). The food struck me as kind of an afterthought. The service was spotty during dinner--it was difficult to get our waiter to come over to get the order. I would have more sympathy, but this place is tiny, so I thought the service should've been better. We started with the fried avocado, which Yelpers raved about. The tempura dipped avocado came out lukewarm and kind of sodden, topped with a cold tomato and onion dice straight from the fridge. Someone just left our order waiting. Not good. The entrees were better, fortunately. My husband had the ribeye, which was huge and a delicious piece of meat--cooked perfectly. However, it was on top of a cold (seriously--cold!) portion of parsnip puree. I had the salmon with roasted sunchokes on top of quinoa. Again, the salmon was cooked perfectly and was a very generous portion. The quinoa, on the other hand wasn't even cooked all the way through and was crunchy, and the sunchokes were lukewarm. Their grill/meat chef is great, but whoever plates and preps everything else is way off.  Even after the $50 Groupon, for 3 drinks, an app, and 2 entrees it was $80 with tax and tip. I would never eat here for $130 or $80. Between the bizarre pretention, the mediocre and pricey food, and the spotty service, we won't be back, probably not even for a drink, even though they're quite good.",0.9981,0.807,0.162,0.031,0.5356894841269841
2010-10-28,1.0,"My experience at the Drawing Room has to be one the worst I've ever had. I had my birthday dinner there with a group of 15 people. I spoke with the event planner beforehand to make sure everything would run smoothly with such a large group, and was told that everything would be taken of. The dinner started smoothly with drinks and the waitress was great at offering suggestions. We noticed that the drinks were taking a long time. When we spoke to the manager, he said this was part of the experience. Well, the ""experience"" took 3 hours and we each only had two drinks the entire night. The food also came out in interrupted bursts so that my group didn't get to eat together. We were told it was because of a wedding party that was going on in the club portion of Le Passage. However, we weren't told that in advance- either when I spoke to the event planner 4 weeks earlier who should have alerted me to this, or when we arrived. If anyone would have taken the time to tell us beforehand, instead of after we had waited and hour and a half for our food, we would have been much more understanding of the service. The manager was also very condescending when my friend spoke to him on my behalf about the terrible service.  At one point, he told him he should sit down and enjoy the ""complimentary dessert"" I had gotten for my birthday. Not only was this dessert given to me only after a number of my guests asked the waitress to acknowledge my birthday (which was in my request on OpenTable and mentioned to the event planner weeks in advance), it was a single scoop of gelato for 15 people. And did I mention that we were also charged $6 for the ""complimentary dessert"" on our bill? Talk about the icing on the cake. When you come to place that advertises an 'experience that is not to be missed' and pay a premium to dine there, you expect at the very least to be treated with respect, courtesy and for the restaurant to make good on their promises. Not only did we have an experience that I wouldn't even stand for at a McDonald's drive-thru, but the manager made my guests seem foolish for trying to better my birthday experience. I don't blame the experience on the large group because nearly every table was there for as long and there were many other unhappy faces. Rather, it was the attitudes of the people in charge of the ""experience"" We did receive a small discount on our food but nothing else. I had planned on inviting guests the club portion of Le Passage afterwards but because of the wedding, the lounge would not open until 12 or 1am. We were only told this, again, when we asked the manager directly and I had to personally call my other 20 guests to move the party elsewhere. I would advise against anyone going to this restaurant under any circumstances, not just a party. The Drawing Room does not care about your experience or making you feel whole if there are special circumstances.",0.9704,0.881,0.085,0.034,0.5658075396825395

The decor is perfect for a date at one of the more out of the way tables, but it's also great to bring friends, sit at the bar, and shoot the shit.

So I started off the night with 5 stars and i subtracted or added as the night progressed...  Reservation process was easy but finding the place was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. The needle was the sketchy hole in the wall of a doorway and a single hostess with a podium in front. Already feeling that this was sketchy, we still ventured down the stairs that led to a basement known as The Drawing Room.  The decor was tastefully done while the lighting was dim. Definitely more of a lounge atmosphere than a dinner one. BUT OMG, the seats were low. Thank god the BF and I are asian and not very vertically gifted. I don't know how blood was circulating through other taller people's legs. There was no leg room at all. MINUS 1 STAR On to the entrees:  The day we went, the restaurant was switching over to their new fall menu, so I was a little scared of what to order..  We both ordered the pre fixe and a drink each for a total bill of around $140. 1st COURSE 1. Steak Frites - beef tartare with fried potatoes. It was different and flavorful. The potatoes were the best part of the dish..  2. Belgium Endive - apple and shallot salad. It was very disappointing. The BF hated it. It was def not worth the money. I could have made this at home.. MINUS 1 STAR for the worse dish of the night.  2nd COURSE (THEY RAN OUT OF THE BACON^) what a disappointment- MINUS 1 STAR So instead we ordered:  3. Crepe Ratatouille - nothing special - not very unique. There was no pro as to why they made it into a crepe. The crepe was soggy from the ratatouille and made the dish even worse. MINUS 1 STAR 4. Ox Melt - tasty but overly oily. After eating this, I just felt full and heavy.. this should be a 3rd course entree, not a 2nd course. MINUS 1 STAR 3rd COURSE  5. Scallop -  seared nicely but def not the best scallop I've ever had  6. Ribeye - BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT. flavorful, not too fatty, and oh so tender medium rare steak. Even better than some steak houses. PLUS ONE STAR As for the drinks:  I had high expectations because The Drawing Room is famous for being a lounge and its mixology. We received a complimentary starter shot of some apple mixed drink and it was so smooth and refreshing!  PLUS ONE STAR However, after being disappointed by the fact that we can't order that starter as a whole drink by itself, we asked for recommendations. We ended up ordering the Manhattan and the Gloomlifter, both disappointing for our expectations of mixologists. MINUS ONE STAR PLUS ONE STAR for valet parking.  OVERALL, 2 STARS at best.

The Drawing Room's lounge atmosphere was comfortable, while the dull roar in reminded us that we very much downtown. Not a connoisseur of cocktails for which the DR is known, I passed on booze for the night (though they did have a modest selection of craft beer). Still, a complimentary sample was provided while we looked over the menu, which was a nice touch. We had reservations and were seated right away - though they only provided us with one menu. In fact, it took our server about 10 minutes to round up another menu, despite only a half-full restaurant as we arrived (around 7:00). Puzzling. They then left us with one menu after we placed our order, ostensibly so that we could order more drinks as the evening progressed. As the DR began to fill in, our menu was recruited from our table. There are easy solutions to this menu deficit: print more menus or have a cocktail menu at each table. I digress...  We shared the heirloom tomatoes, which were quite good, though the portions were rather small. For our entrées, my girlfriend ordered the roasted chicken with couscous, and I opted for the Filipino bbq pork. My pork was very tender and the sauce had a tang to it (but wasn't overly spicy). I enjoyed my dish, but I didn't love it. I had a brief sample of the roasted chicken, which again was good but nothing extraordinary. For dessert, we decided to do the flight sampling, which consisted of a chocolate/peanut butter cookie, cheesecake, and gelato. Each of these were decent on their own, and together they made for a fairly nice ending to our meal, though for $15 I think it was overpriced.

I've been here twice.  The first time was with a group of eight people for a celebratory dinner.  This time wasn't perfect but our group didn't really have a consensus on what our game plan was.  The menu has three different parts - basically small appetizers, bigger appetizers to share, and the entrees.  We choose to split a three course meal and choose one from each, but the other half of the table was going to do ""just appetizers,"" picked the small appetizers, and were unhappy when that was it.  That side got a little riled up with their lack of food and also because there was no diet coke (they import the coke from Mexico so it has delicious sugar vs. syrup).  I thought our waiter should have handled the situation better and he had a little attitude (although I really can't blame him because even I was getting frustrated).  Nonetheless, we had a great time and the food was all really good (tuna, bbq pork, calamari) with my favorite being the spicy raw tuna.   The next time around I went just with my boyfriend and it was perfect.  We called ahead to make sure we could get a table and we were seated right away by the friendly staff.  Our waitress Marissa was excellent.  She was sweet and patient as we tried to find a cocktail I ""loooved"" and not just liked.  We found a winner: it wasn't on their current menu but was a nice rum, that was smooth/frothy with some egg ingredient, and nutmeg.  It was TO DIE FOR.  What is really neat is I have never had a drink like that - they really know what they were talking about.  We tried the OxTail dish which was served as a sandwich and it was also very tasty.  Last but not least, the Manager knew we were celebrating a birthday, took us into Le Passage, and gave us a complementary glass of some kind of good Rose champagne - a very nice touch!    I will definitely be back!",0.9963,0.724,0.21,0.066,0.5778772555946468

They were very friendly and approachable. My bf enjoyed the manhattan over the old fashioned and I liked the three times the vine better than the one starting with an 'f' that I couldn't pronounce. Oh and a quick tip we learned - ""acid"" as a descriptor for the drinks means egg white in case anyone is adverse or allergic to it.  For dinner, we ended up splitting 4 appetizers/lighter plates. In order of deliciousness: bacon2 (super tender), ox tail (which was a sandwich, I wasn't expecting it to be, but it was great) and then the calamari and the ceviche.  Service was good although our waitress joked about rushing me along as she asked me if I was ready to order before I was and how dishes were before I had tasted them, so then she came by the table less often.

Here's the meal: Heirloom Tomatoes - this platter of tomatoes, cucumbers, lemon zest, hummus, and yogurt foam looked like a jungle on my plate. I'm all for jungles, but the foam and hummus didn't really go together. And unfortunately, the salt seasoning was not evenly distributed.  Polenta - I needed a knife to cut through the crust on the polenta, not in the good way. And the stuffed peppers were not roasted enough. The de-skinned peppers seemed uncomfortable in their naked, unseasoned state. The corn inside was not freshly cut off the cob, which I've found is the best way to honor the taste. Gelato - hazelnut gelato is creamy and delicious. The two baked desserts were not recommended by the waiter, which infers this course is not a high priority for the restaurant.

Chicago is not exactly known for being a city of lounges, so I was excited to try this place out, having a reputation for being trendy and having good drinks. First impressions: door guy was a douche and made the place seem over pretentious. It was early and just us two. There was no line, but the door guy made us stand outside while he used his walkee talkee, finally pulling one of those ""I GUUUUESSSSS i can let you in"".  Another guy led us downstairs to the host table. ""Um 17 of our 20 tables are free right now but reserved for reservations sometime later this evening, maybe even 4 hours from now. The bar is full, but you have stand near the bar until something opens up"". UMMMMMM unnecessary. After standing near the bar for 30 mins we were relieved to get a table. Not a great start, but once we got a seat we had some fun. The place has a very trendy vibe to it. The drinks were great and the food was top notch too (we had the scallops.  if you can look past the pretentiousness, this is probably one of the best lounges in the city. Rush is super touristy, but because of the classyness of this place, the door men seem to do a good job of keeping out the trash that frequent the other bars/clubs in the area. One other thing to note: although this place keeps it pretty trendy, it IS connected via a hallway but blocked by glass doors to a super touristy nightclub called Le Passage. Don't be fooled, this place is not a hot spot, it is more like a Senior Frogs.

The food was equally impressive.  We began with the Spicy Tuna Tartare, which was surprisingly large and a real treat.  It was almost too much to split, but it was so delicious that we had no problem finishing it.  Our meals with both excellent.  I had a pork shoulder dish that was also a very nice size for the price.  It was on the bone and at first I wasn't sure how I was going to eat it, but then I stuck my fork in it and the meat slid off the bone.  It combined with some unique and surprisingly delicious garnishes for a fantastic plate.  My girlfriend chose the scallops, which were some of the largest I had ever seen.  They were perfectly cooked and served in a sauce that I think would make rotten garbage a delicacy.  We finished with a trio of desserts, all of which were delicious.  I would recommend taking advantage of the three course meal option at $43 a person and sharing everything as it is all wonderful.  Also, return frequently as the menu is constantly evolving.  I tip my hat to executive chef Nick Lacasse.

2010-05-09,3.0,"Only if we could give 1/2 stars... so, if you're reading this, it's more 3 1/2 stars than 3. When you get to the restaurant, there's a doorman with the reservations list. I didn't have to play 20 questions with him like a lot of folks had to... just told him my name and reservation time, and he sent us right down. There's 2 flights of stairs you have to go down before you get in the restaurant... it almost makes you feel like you're going to a secret, underground bar... prohibition era-esque. once you reach the bottom of the stairs and open the doors, a cute and cozy lounge awaits. There are these unique little chairs (that like many others, I had a hard time finding a comfortable position) that really gave it a unique, cozy feel to the place. So, 4 stars for ambiance. Now onto the cocktails! Like you read about, this place is very focused on their signature drinks. We read over the list and realized we had no clue what a lot of ingredients were (they use a lot of brands that we never heard of... not the typical brands you would see). So, the waiter said one of his favorites was the Trifecta and we order that to start. You have the option of the drink being made table side or at the bar so since we were newbies here, we opted for the bar. The mixologist rolls through with a cart right next to our table and starts explaining the drink we chose. She has us sample and smell some of the ingredients that are going in and even tells us some history about it. We ask for one more drink recommendation and she says the Manhattan is a good one so we go with that. My fiance loved his s Manhattan and my Trifecta was good... just a little too sweet for me. We realized towards the end that it helped if we stirred the drink before I drank it (weird). We ended up ordering one more drink, The Easy Virtue. It's very strong and the coffee flavor is actually an aftertaste... and when you sip it, you get the smell of the mint which my fiance loved. Again, awesome explanation of all the ingredients and asks us if we have any questions. Nope, we're good and ready to get our drink on. 4 stars for drink experience. Now for the food... we decided to share a bunch of plates and we went with the following: +New jersey oysters: these really appealed to me because i love oysters and the franks red hot caviar sounded interesting (and i am a big franks red hot fan). But, they ended up being really fishy and left a bad tasted in my mouth. Not a winner. +Spicy Tuna Tartare: cubed spicy tuna, slices of avocado, and tempura nori. All worked very well together and the tuna tasted fresh and as advertised, it definitely had a kick to it. Very good. +Veal Nuggets: these veal nuggets melted in our mouth... my fiance said it almost reminded him of fois gras because it was so rich and buttery. They were very good and the accompanying beet slaw was interesting as well (not in a bad way). Very good. +Fish and chips: definitely not your traditional pub fare fish and chips! The plate was covered in their lemon aioli, then on top was the halibut thats potato crusted, then a layer of tarragon, and then the croquette. My only gripe with this was that there was sooo much aioli (which is not a bad thing if you like that sort of thing) but I dont tend to eat very rich, heavy creamy sauces but that was unavoidable since the bottom side of the fish was drenched in it. The fish itself was very good with the tarragon and the potato crust... so lesson learned, ask for aioli on the side next time. So, overall, food was good. I wouldn't say it was amazing or one of my best meals ever.... food experience for me gets 3 stars. All in all, a good and fun atmosphere with a very unique, cozy loungy feel. Very cool drink menu and neat concept with table side drink making with decent food. 3 1/2 stars.",0.998,0.837,0.149,0.015,0.5633173308173309
2010-05-08,2.0,"My mother always says,""Rude is never an option"". I guess she should have told that to the bouncer at the outside door of The Drawing Room the other night.  I was late for my reservation (darn that road construction) but I had called and a very nice guy on the phone had said ""No problem"". And while it was ""no problem"" for me . . what they failed to mention was that my friend who was going to get there before me would not be able to have a drink as the 6 seats at the bar were reserved. So he left to do something else in the neighborhood until I got there.  So I show up, not knowing all of this is going on and am met by a guy at the door who tells me, ""You're late"".  ""Yes, but I called.""  ""Doesn't matter anyway as your friend already left. I didn't think you were coming back."" ""Why would you think that?"" ""You're late"". As I tried to make sense of this inane conversation, I finally just pushed past the guy and walked down the stairs into the restaurant.  Here the service was a scant bit better as they actually acknowledged that I called and showed me to my table. My friend arrived at the same moment.  Now ladies. I don't know about you, but I have long legs. The chairs in this place sit so low to the floor that if you are wearing heels, you can either sit with your knees above your thighs all night, or cross your ankles and kind of sit over your legs. Neither option was very comfortable. And since this low chair has only one side, you end up kind of lounging across the thing. Always an interesting pose to eat soup in!  They have a prix fixe menu ($43 for one item from each of the sections of the menu) but we chose to go with a few small plates to share and then split an entree.  We went with the tuna poke (delicious! the best thing we had all night) the fried guacamole (basically deep fried avocado), mushroom soup (way too salty) and the fish and chips (quite good and very interesting.) The bison skirt steak that we split was interesting with plums atop it but again, salty. And for our side dish- the polenta was quite tasty.  While the Drawing Room might be known for their drinks-on this night it was almost a laugh. When my friend's second martini came- we noticed the glass was less than half full. We sent it back.  The manager, Brian, then brought the same drink back to the table to tell us that they use a ""jigger system"" for making drinks and it was the ""perfect pour"". Then he went on to say it was the lighting that was making it look short. Really? And yes- I've heard of a ""jigger"" before too. Thanks for the measurement lesson. Now just go and fix the drink! He finally ended up comping the drink.  The highlight of our evening was our server, John. Patient, clear on his explanations and quick with a recco. Too bad the food and drinks he was serving and the rude beginning caused such a poor rating.  I eat out all the time. I put up with a lot of mistakes. But rude?

The polenta was excellent too. Totally vegetarian and totally fresh and not one of those wimpy vegetarian dishes that they put on the menu as an afterthought.

2010-04-07,5.0,"5 stars... singularly for the drinks. Now I had a peeking eye at this place before it opened at one point when I was at Le Passage, which is (or was) a conjoined space to what is now the Drawing Room. I generally cringe a tad when anybody mentions going to Le Passage because it is the hoighty toighty clubby crowd that floods this place at least for the majority of my visits there. But when the Drawing Room was under construction I peeked in and got a chance to meet the designer Hughes N'Cho-Allepot; I remember trying to butcher his name 3 times aloud before he gave me his business card. As a young enginerding student at the time I found myself cooing over the construction and more interested in piquing the imagination of a visionary than forging a smile to some cheeseball in the club next door. I disappeared from the scene and hadn't returned until my girlfriend's ""quarter of a century"" birthday extravaganza included a personalized menu and drinks at the drawing room. I thought ""dinner"" was at my gals place with a pregame of champagne and that we were just going for drinks. Doing some homework on yelp, I was aware that drinks were gonna be pricey and my beau and I devised a plan to enjoy a drink and split before we get tangled in a bill neither of us would be prepared for (Mama O. was coming to town in a few days so he wanted to save for indulging in outings then). .. turns out there WAS a DINNER and he had to fork over $100 bucks. I think I am on the ""you STILL owe me for springing that one"" list. Despite the confusion, I think if 1) prices were on this special menu and 2) we were better aware of the game plan for the night, that this dinner would have been closer to a perfect 5 star experience. There were pleasant surprises to balance that though. The decor finally revealed to my eyes in entirety was classy. Simple with a neutral cream palette complimented with espresso wood beams and inviting with soft textures: sheer drapes across the walls and champagne-colored velvet chairs across from our modern formal family dining table that was paired with off-white leather seats. Cream stucco on the columns and great dim lighting. I generally prefer a bit more life in my environment, but his was suiting. It was a very comfortable scene.  The avocado tempura my friends shared was yummy and the starter cod fish-n-chips I had was a good appetizer, but had me skeptical of what was to come: (""is there gonna be a fancy meatball given a frenchified name and a $$ pricetag?""). So far I wasn't convinced yet that what I had seen would be hard to commission my russian roomate to replicate. But the main dish experience was a complete 180. I got the ""almost 1/2 chicken"" with barley, carmelized eggplant, and goat's feta and Ben O. got the ""Osso Buco"" braised pork with risotto and beets. They were both great and sophisticated dishes. Now it a rarity for me to eat pork, but I got curious and tried Ben's and was almost in that single instance converted! Mine was good, but safe... at best I appreciated the dressing of the chicken. Onto the 5-star portion of the evening. If you are itching for the PERFECT drink, get it here; I didn't think it existed, better yet existed in such a plentitude of PERFECT options until this night. I would go back again but solely for the drinks. Now I was there with over a dozen folks and I got to sip and try most of em and EVERY single drink was amazing in its own right. The drinks are well work the $12 per glass, and a brilliant mixologist comes and blends the booze with the bitters and the zests into ""culinary cocktails"". After this experience I'd put ""personal mixologist"" above ""personal chef"" on my fantasy list of indulgences to have when I accumulate the wallet of Bill Gates.",0.9984,0.829,0.153,0.017,0.5405753968253968

The Sazarac alone put a smile on my face. I've been looking for an excuse to ""officially"" dine at Drawing Room ever since that amazing bash. I finally got the opportunity this past weekend with the hubby and another couple. While my hubby complained that the menu was somewhat limited, I didn't seem to have any trouble choosing from it.   For an appetizer the table split an order of the tempura avocado. It was pretty awesome, but then again you can't go wrong when ordering fried anything. I enjoyed perfectly cooked scallops for my entrée and I think the sides that came with it were even better than the scallops themselves. The hubby went with the mini burgers as his main entrée and it was served in such a creative way  - mini toppings on the side! He seemed very pleased about his choice from their ""limited menu.""

And it wasn't the stuffy-type basement i was expecting... the staff was actually very down to earth and friendly.  Twelve dollar drinks sounded steep, until i bought one and somehow let the words ""perfectly balanced cocktail"" slip out of my mouth, at which point i felt high-brow enough that i should be paying a lot more for that 9oz of liquid. With all the libations flowing, I was suddenly glad the Drawing Room wasn't actually built on stilts, I felt fancy enough with the Rye Manhattan.  The food was pretty good considering the price. I had fish and chips to start, which was essentially cod rolled up, deep fried, and used to minimally decorate a plate that happened to have some tartar sauce and a few stray potato chips on it. The neat presentation did not make me feel like i was getting any more out of a fifteen dollar finger food that i could've easily made at home. Next was the Osso Bucco, which was a tender and moist pork shank on a bed of white chedder rissoto and a beat sauce. It was actually delicious, though there was a bit of a squabble over who should finish the left-over portion of my risotto. The ambiance was relaxed, inviting, and intimate. Though the Sanseveria plants were looking a bit undernourished (these minimilistic plants apparently haven't evolved to thrive in candle-lit basements), the space was contemporary, and only just bordered on that 'overtly sterile' feel.

2010-02-27,4.0,"To whoever invented Restaurant Week ... a great big thank you!  Because if it wasn't for you, my fiancee and I probably would've never thought to have a meal at The Drawing Room. My fiancee and I had dinner at The Drawing Room on Thursday of Restaurant Week.  Food-wise, we were pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality.  Quick rundown: Starter 1: Grilled Calamari- Stuffed with crab meat with a bit of heat.  Good sized portion too for a starter. Starter 2: Veal Nuggets - Delicious!  Lightly battered and perfectly cooked.  Sweetbreads are my weakness like nothing else. Entree 1: Sauteed Scallops - Cooked well and the creamed arugula that accompanied it was quite good.  Only gripe was that the dish only came with three scallops (not sure if they skimped because of Restaurant Week). Entree 2: Osso Buco - Big hunk of braised pork shank on top of a equally big pile of white cheddar risotto.  The pork was a little on the dry side but not noticeably so, especially since I ate each bite with some risotto.  Good dish nonetheless. Dessert 1: Bread Pudding - Good but nothing special. Dessert 2: Creme Brulee - See Bread Pudding above. Cocktail-wise, I had the Paramour (very orange-y, both in terms of color and flavor) and the Improved Blood and Sand (nice and stiff).  The cocktail menu in general is quite impressive and you can definitely tell that the bartenders pay great attention to detail when assembling each drink. So after hearing me heap all that praise onto The Drawing Room, you might be wondering why only four stars?  Simply put: slooooooooow service.  After placing our order, we waited a long time for our starters (~20 minutes) and then after we finished our starters, it took another 25 minutes for our entrees to come.  I don't know if they were understaffed or if they just move at a leisurely pace, but our meal took much longer than it should have.  My fiancee also wanted me to dock a star for the uncomfortable chairs that we sat in during our dinner but I didn't mind them too much. Slow service aside, we were pleased with our meal at The Drawing Room.  There's a good chance we will return again, if not for dinner then definitely for drinks.  Thank you again to the creator of Restaurant Week!",0.9959,0.808,0.169,0.023,0.6081400081400081

The Restaurant Week menu differed from what was available online, no doubt due in part to supply and demand.  Bacon Squared was not on the RW menu, and at the very start of the night (our reservation was for 6pm, when they opened) they were out of both Bacon^2 and the tuna tartare.  (We snagged the last B^2).

This was the first time we went to the restaurant and normally, I don't write a review for something we've done only once (unless it's so bad that I feel the need to warn others!) but this one was sort of special. This is why I am reserving that last star for my return review...  My husband and I decided to order different items off the menu so we can try a handful of their offerings. Here are the dishes we tried: fish and chips, bacon squared, osso buco, short rib pasta, bread pudding, and white chocolate creme brulee.  It's Tuesday and I still thinking about our dinner. At first, I didn't want to order fish and chips but my husband has a thing for them and insisted on trying it out at every place we go that offers them. They ended up being the highlight of my night! The fish were crispy on the outside and literally melted in my mouth when I bit in. It was moist and took me by complete surprise. The chips were good and the entire dish was exquisite. Bacon squared was also delicious but their fish and chips took the gold (can't help it, I have olympics on the background...) Now onto the main course: I loooove both dishes. The intense and surprising flavoring of anise in the pasta was a welcoming change to the typical red or white sauce. I also love the roasted tomatoes in it. The osso buco was cooked perfectly: meat fell off the bone and the combination of roasted beet with the risotto was very delicious. The dessert was also very solid. I personally liked the bread pudding more but then again, I am usually not a big fan of white chocolate.  Service was great! We were seated on time and our waiters/bus boys/host/hostess were all fantastic! We will definitely return to try their other dishes! OH!

And I save up my money and wait until Restaurant Week, and go to town in a ladylike fashion. Last year, my Restaurant Week experience was kind of mediocre. That restaurant has since closed. This year, my first of two (!! TWO) Restaurant Week experiences was really very stellar, hence the five stars. The Drawing Room is kind of amazing. Firstly, the staff is excellent. Our server/waiter/whatever you call him was great in terms of explaining the drinks (and yeah, since the menu lists brands instead of types of liquor, about 99% of us need recommendations) and the menu. He seemed really excited about everything and we all felt special after he visited the table. The drinks -- amazing. I had the Fistful of Dollars and the Old-Old Fashioned. The former was really, really great. I mean, the Old-Old Fashioned was very good, but the Fistful of Dollars was exquisite -- and my experience drinking it was eerily similar to what the server had described, down to the smoky aroma. Spooky! Dinner was great too. Note: the Restaurant Week menu was a bit different than that listed online. I started with the arugala salad, which I loved (and I usually don't ""love"" salads). Then I had the pork tenderloin (not on the regular menu, but served with the white cheddar risotto that the Osso Bucco is). It was really quite good. The mushrooms and beets were a great accompaniment. I finished with the blood orange bread pudding. I did not necessarily taste the blood orange -- it was a bit fruity but I would not have been able to call the specific flavor if asked -- but the bread pudding itself was wonderful. I was there with three friends, we all got different dishes for the first and second courses, and we were all very pleased. We have plans to go back, and I say this as someone who was asked, ""Are you sure you're okay with this? It's connected to Le Passage.""

2010-02-20,4.0,"We went there during the restaurant week, and we love it. Food, ambiance, experience, service are all great. Definitely worth all the $  The place is known for cocktails. Ingredients for cocktails are so fresh.. they squeeze fruits right in front of you for juices, no more juices in those plastic bottles! I tried The Kiki Dee, pleasantly sweet and a little bit of juice. All cocktails are at $12 which i think it's very decent given the quality of what you get.  We had Bacon2 and Stuffed Squid for appetizers. We ordered the Bacon 2 'coz we read some very good reviews on Yelp before. We fell in love with it right away. The pork was so tender, soft, and juicy. I usually don't eat the fat part (feel too guilty for it).. but for this place, it was way too good to say no! We feel like we can finish 5 orders of this thing. Stuff Squid was the special dish, not the regular menu item. The squid were stuffed with shrimp puree. I was not too impressed with this one. The dish was more of asian fusion which i wish to taste the stronger asian spices.  For entrees, we ordered sauteed scallops with truffled parsnip+arugula puree sauce, and roasted chicken dish. Scallops paired with the sweet sauce was kinda unexpected, but it was such a great combination. I love it. The chicken was very tender + tasty too. i don't know what they did with the chicken but you can taste sweet+nutty flavor on the skin, really really good!!  For desserts, we had bread pudding and white chocolate creme brulee. Bread pudding was just ok for me. Creme Brulee was the must, very creamy and not too sweet.  I ordered coffee which turned out to be kinda bad. They use the press pot which i think they pressed it too soon that you can't really get the taste of coffee.  When we checked with the waitress about this one, she said sorry and cancelled the order for us.. smooth and easy.

This place was WAY too nice and WAY too expensive for my country ways.  I paid as much for one drink as I do for a night's worth of drinks in my hometown.  But, still. The drinks were amazing, the atmosphere was great and, christ, did the bartender do an amazing job.  I gave him a recipe that I concocted on my own (I call it ""Blair"" and it's Bourbon, triple sec and cranberry juice) and the bartender improved it to the utmost discretion.  It became Old Weller (great Bourbon, by the way), top shelf triple sec and miscellaneous juices.  It was AMAZING! The warm rum drink we ordered for the table was pretty good, not AMAZING, but it was decent.  And the scotch and whiskey/whisky selection is just godly.  I can't suggest them enough, if you have the money. But, for those of us from middle state, the cost of a single beer can buy us a six pack for the night, so don't make a specific trip to visit.  But, if you're from Chicago and have the cash or have the cash and are visiting Chicago, then it's a great place to visit.

2010-02-02,5.0,"Words can't describe how much I love this place. Tim, Charles and Christie are all very talented and knowledgeable about their craft. Don't bother asking for one or the other... If someone is standing behind the bar they are more than qualified to make you a cocktail. I have had so many excellent cocktails there that I couldn't pick out one to write about here if I tried. The menu changes seasonally, and I must say the one they are featuring now is particularly great. There is something for all tastes. If you can't decide, ask for help. If you don't recognize a single thing on the menu, say that. No one is going to judge you. Do not go in there set in your ways. You don't like gin you say? Forget that. Ask for a gin based cocktail. You like gin. You just haven't had it prepared properly yet. Do not ask ""What is your favorite cocktail?"" in a vain attempt to make a decision. Hey, Van Gough, what is your favorite color? Yes, of course everyone who works there will say ""Well, it depends..."" or rattle off 10 different cocktails.  If you are having trouble, tell them about flavors or smells that you like. Ask them real questions. Please. And if you order a vodka-Red Bull, I will personally hunt you down. If it were me, I would refuse to make you shitty ""cocktails"" like that or the god-forsaken chocolate ""martini,"" but they are nicer than I am. Don't waste this experience on that. And don't order something with vodka. The food here is not to be missed. Nick, Boo and Matt are all able to create dishes that stand up to the cocktails. This menu also changes seasonally. Right now I am liking the foie and the osso bucco, but that doesn't help you. The short rib ""burger"" is great for late night I've-been-drinking-amazing cocktails food, as is the tuna poke... but don't think of this place as a bar with food... it is a restaurant with an out of this world beverage program deserving of national attention. Nick is a really fabulous chef and deserves a whole hell of a lot more recognition than he gets. I can't wait for him to blow up. The menu online doesn't always update immediately, so stop in personally and check it out. It will be worth every precious penny you spend on it. Make a reservation if you are thinking about coming in for dinner... you might not need it during the week, but lately weekends have been very busy and they have even reached capacity at times.  My personal advice to you, if you really want to experience this place for all it has to offer, is to come in early in the week (Tuesday or Wednesday) around dinner time and plan on a 3 hour meal. Share courses and try everything. Maybe ask for some cocktail pairings. I think that they would probably agree with me on this, and in fact the first Wednesday and Thursday of each month they host ""At the Bar with Nick and Charles,"" a very limited seating for up to 8 people at the bar, which includes 3 courses with cocktail pairings for $45 per person. Charles explains each cocktail; its history/inspiration and ingredients, and Chef does the same with his dishes. It is a great way to introduce yourself to this place, or simply remind yourself of how much you love it. Everyone should try The Drawing Room. You are really missing out if you don't! Plus, they have a really sexy door guy on the weekend. Careful, he will beguile you with his charms. Props guys, you the best.",0.9967,0.805,0.144,0.051,0.5006538992408559

One of the few things on the menu worth ordering in addition to the Hawaiian Poke Tuna. After tasting those two dishes, it was difficult to be impressed with what followed afterward. I got the Asian fried chicken. Not too impressive - small portion and not very crispy. The barbecued beans were far undercooked and therefore hard. The kale was just too sweet with the kumquats. I really couldn't taste the lemongrass in the biscuit. My gf couldn't eat the short rib burger as it was too greasy for her. As usual the drinks were creative. I recommend the Bread and Wine cocktail. Sadly that night they ran out of two beers that my friend Chris wanted. The service is excellent.

2009-12-15,5.0,"I think The Drawing Room is ofically my favorite restaurant in Chicago.   This restaurant is so cool; it is primarily a cocktail bar- they specialize in prohibition-era cocktails and freshfreshfresh ingredients. The cocktails are almost indescribable- unlike anything you can find elsewhere made with liqueurs and spirits that aren't widespread, and prepared tableside with a history lesson.  We had a long, slow dinner- the food at this place is just superb. We started with the oysters- ok, I started with the oysters, served with a gardiniera mignonette, Josh was a good sport and tried one but I had the rest all to myself.  Our first course also included the yellow tail poke- avocado, sesame, quail egg, and, something I can't remember, some sort of emulsion came together to create an incredibly balanced dish. Second course was the Sweetbreads and the fish and chips. The sweetbreads were lovely, served with pineapple, pomegranate, artichoke and pancetta brittle- each bite was perfect. The fish and chips would be better described as ""fish and chips""- creative, fun salt cod croquettes served with aioli, American chips and malt vinegar powder.  Our third course was rich, meaty and decadent. Josh and my mom loved the wagyu cheeks- the meat braised and so tender that it melted if you looked at it funny and served with an addictively salty truffle oil and frisee panzanella. My favorite was what they called bacon squared. Perfectly cooked pork belly wrapped in crispy bacon served with smoky eggplant puree- this might have just ruined pork belly for me forever- it's absolutely amazing. I definitely ate more than my fair share of this rich little dish. For dessert we ordered the flight- perfect pistachio gelato, some sort of praline tart, an amazing curry spiced apple crisp, and peanut butter crème brule. I never would have ordered peanut butter crème brulee, and thinking about it I'd never think the flavors would work, but it was really, really good.  The cocktails here can't be glossed over. I wholly recommend everyone order a drink called an Aviation, not on the menu, it's still the most popular drink they serve. It's a really subtle introduction to the type of old-fashioned cocktails they serve. All together we tried six or seven different cocktails, and the remarkable thing is; it doesn't seem to matter if you don't like gin/tequila/bourbon/whatever, the drinks are so balanced and the ingredients so fresh that you will completely change your mind by the end of the evening.",0.9987,0.754,0.227,0.019,0.6261904761904761

Christie was our mixologist - she was fine/informative but not particularly entertaining.  But you should definitely have the drinks made at your table (no extra charge). The food highlight was easily the grouper, while the fish & chips (aka soupy cod balls) fell flat.  Can't go wrong with bacon^2, and the poke tuna was decent - the pieces of fish seemed a bit large and firm to me, but the taste was solid. We ordered the dessert flight, which is conveniently served on a platter from best (peanut butter creme brulee) to meh (chocolate tart).  The apple crisp with curry was one of the more intriguing desserts I've ever had...

2009-12-03,5.0,"This place is amazing and totally topped off my visit to Chicago. I'd never been to a lounge where your bartender -- err -- mixologist moves a cart to your table, explains every step of making the drink and what contributes what flavors to the mix, and squeezes/shakes/stirs all the fruit and booze right in front of you. All the fruit purees are made fresh in-house, and the juices that are in your drink of choice are squeezed fresh right in front of you, so you know that there is no bottled junk in your drink. At the Drawing Room, you're definitely getting your money's worth for your mixed drink, unlike a lot of other bars/lounges which rely more on their ambiance than the quality of their drinks. Lucky for us, the Drawing Room has both ambiance and amazing drinks!  I had the anthurium cocktail, which is a unique drink made by a mixologist at the Drawing Room, so you probably won't find this anywhere else (our mixologist has participated in drink mixing competitions, so she's pretty damn good!). The Anthurium is made of fresh blackberry puree, Right gin, Aperol, agave, lime, fresh basil (it's surprisingly really good in this drink), and a slice of enflamed orange peel. It's probably one of the best, if not the best, mixed drink I've ever had. The presentation of the drink being made for me at our table was also pretty cool.  For some small plates, we had the bacon wrapped pork belly with eggplant puree and the burger, which is not any regular burger, but a short rib burger that really melts in your mouth and has little toppings made in house that you can put on top, such as sweet and spicy pickles, oyster mushrooms, and a yummy tomato chutney. And because our friend's friend knew the manager, we also had a complimentary plate of the avocado tempura - not as great as the drinks and the other dishes we had, but it was decent. We couldn't leave without dessert, and since we were so tempted by the dessert flight, we got that - it came with a chocolate pecan tart (good, but not ""wow!""), peanut butter creme brulee (I'd never would have thought this would be good, but it was pretty satisfying), a rosemary granny smith apple crisp (the rosemary was an interesting addition), and a pistachio gelato that had some large grains of salt in it. The salt added a really nice dimension to the gelato. I love the ambiance of the place - the decor is beautiful and swanky without feeling too snooty, the lights are dimmed just enough so that you don't have to squint at your dining/drinking partners, and the service is really friendly. The Drawing Room is easy to miss since it doesn't have much of a front and is in what seems to be a basement, so watch out for it if you are looking. I'd recommend it as a place for a date, or just as a place where you could catch up with friends in a semi-cozy place.

We started out with the yellow fin tuna poke and then moved onto steak frites, which was a nicely sized portion of wagyu beef tartare and fries.  The fries were amazing.  So crispy on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside.  The server said that the chef took them off the menu a while ago, but brought them back for this special occasion.  Too bad, cause they were top notch!  It was paired with the calvados a la minute cocktail, which consisted of VSOP Armagnac, pear liqueur, apple cider, agave, prosecco, and an allspice dram.  It was a deliciously autumnal cocktail!  The main course was roast chicken, which I'm normally not a fan of, but this was pretty good, nice and juicy.  It was paired with my favorite cocktail for the evening - The Spice of Life - North Shore aquavit, Galliano L'Autentico, apricot jam, and lime.  Lightly sweet and a nice pairing with the chicken.  For dessert, we had blackberry-white chocolate bread pudding with vanilla bean whipped mascarpone.  I've never gone out of my way for white chocolate, but this was satisfyingly rich, and the bread was perfectly crisp on the outside edges.  All in all, a very delicious and satisfying experience.

2009-11-09,5.0,"Awesome. I found The Drawing Room listed on LUPEC's website while looking for cool cocktail places in Chicago and it definitely delivered. Sure, it's a little bit pretentious -- not the best place to grab a beer or ten with a big group of friends, but the cool, lounge-style ambiance is a great place for one-on-one conversation or small groups. And let's come to the point: it's an awesome place for cocktails. I came here on a Saturday night earlyish, and was alarmed at how slowly the place filled -- we could have come in nearly any time during the evening and gotten seated or hung out by the bar. We sat at the bar right away, and enjoyed a few cocktails and conversation with the bartenders. They're well versed in the classics -- a proper and delicious old fashioned, sazerac, manhattan, or aviation is right there, and they also have tons of interesting and new liquors to bring a new twist to an old favorite -- Bols Genever, CapRock Gin, cool ryes, a house-smoked cachaca (what?! awesome!). Where The Drawing Room really shines, though, is in their modern cocktails -- cool twists on old favorites, along with funky new ingredients -- cumin tinctures, local jam, grilled pineapple puree, house-made sodas and syrups. If prompted, the bartenders are happy to whip up something new on-the-spot, as well. Also cool - usually passing up bar seating means you miss out on the theatrics of drink creation, but the Drawing Room has a couple of rolling bars, so you can relax on the couch-style seating and have the bar COME TO YOU! Sweet! We passed on the food here, save for sampling the pumpkin risotto, which was... okay. The rice was a bit tough, I though, but not terrible -- I think it was just so terribly outdone by the cocktails that it didn't really register. Double points for serving awesome shot-sized amuse-bouche cocktails between drinks. All in all an amazing place. Not cheap, but an excellent use of your cocktail dollars. Also of note: Le Passage next door is okay, but an extremely sharp contrast from the cool chillness of The Drawing Room. A decent place to have a few drinks if you're planning on hitting the clurrrrrb, I suppose, but The Drawing Room is entirely worthy of a trip in its own right.",0.9985,0.723,0.24,0.037,0.5619035594035593

Was so very looking forward to a sexy, enigmatic, plush evening of adult fun featuring expertly crafted specialty cocktails, exquisite surroundings, and charming staff all enveloped for my lounging pleasure in dim, lavish and utterly sexy environs. Not here, Babes. Nuh Uh.  Upon entry I was immediately caught off guard by the décor... for all intents and purposes it's a restaurant - and a pretty bright one at that - not the magical lounge a la Violet Hour that I was expecting. Tables abound are set for dinner... you know the drill; forks, knives, place mats. Ay Chihuahua, no me gusta! The mix of people standing around drinking in said dining area coupled with groups and folks on dates actually dining is a weird (and uncomfortable) mish mosh. I specified to the host that my group would only be partaking in drinks, yet we were still seated at one of these awkward tables, brought menus and then were looked at disappointingly by our server when we failed to order anything but cocktails. Um, ok...  Speaking of the cocktails. They're ubercomplex. I find myself pretty well-schooled in the art of imbibe and was hard pressed to find much of anything I recognized... it's definitely a bit of a smoke and mirrors show, which is fine, but the staff needs to be tremendously more accommodating in helping the clientele navigate their way toward something enjoyable for the individual palette. Fortunately, (sarcasm font) my server guy was intent on making sure this task was as difficult as possible for me. He not only refused to name a 'most popular' drink at TDR, but when requesting his favorites, he couldn't name those either giving me the most arrogant, blow-off response ever... ahem, ""well, like, I have so many favorites, do you want me to name, like, four or five of them?""... Dude. Yo. It's a simple question that you should be, if anything, trained to answer... I don't give a shit really what your favorite is, help me pick something!!!  Of the three cocktails sampled none were actually drinkable. Either too strong, too medicinal or just too weird, we skipped a finish of anything leaving our glasses half full and bolted for the door.

2009-10-12,5.0,"This is officially my happy place. Drinking companion and I finally dug out our dusty old Groupon and gave this place a shot on a Saturday night. We got there just after it opened and were both thrilled and surprised to have the place to ourselves for the majority of the evening. There were four or five other small parties throughout the evening, but the host kept intact our own boozy, comfy little sphere. Our server 1) was super cute, and 2) harbored no resentment toward our coupon usage. And he did that thing I like, where I think I want something from the menu and he preternaturally knows me and knows that no, that's not going to taste like what I'm expecting and what I'll really like is this one. His suggestions were unequivocally spot on for me and drinking companion. And while he may not have been the head mixologist, he provided thorough answers to all our questions, from flavor to technique, helping us to narrow down our choices from every drink on the menu to the four that made our night perfect. In addition to counseling us through our conflicted ordering process, hot server brought us complementary little tastes of other concoctions in between. Everything was heavenly. When given the option of receiving our actual drinks from the bar or having them made tableside, we opted for the show. We asked the mixologist more incessant, burning questions (from 'why are you doing that?' to 'wtf is bitters?') and received a (yet again, preternatural) wealth of information. He stressed the process: why they order some ingredients and make others in-house; the chemistry; the smells; the consistencies. We ended happily drunk, in sensory heaven, and darn well-educated. Oh, and one of the demos definitely involved fire. Speaking of senses, I'll avoid commenting on the seemingly universal attractiveness of the staff and mention the music. The house hooked up a Mac with a playlist composed of whatever tracks the staff wants to hear that night. This made for a consistently excellent mix and certainly didn't hurt the moods of everyone on the clock. We didn't order any food. And the specific drinks we ordered are inconsequential; get your own personal recommendations and you'll love what you get.

2009-07-27,3.0,"Although I'm giving the Drawing Room three stars, I think it is entirely possible to have a 4 star experience. We started off on the wrong foot by not being sure how to enter the restaurant.  Denton said that their website said to enter from the alley.  I just checked and don't see that info.  Once we arrived, the hostess was very nice and wished me happy birthday.  Seated immediately, we were asked tap or sparking water and given our menus.  The waiter asked if we had every been here and gave us the 411. We ordered drinks and requested that they be made table side.  It was very cool and interesting.  I'd recommend the experience.  They offer a three course option, which Denton ordered.  I just wanted two small plates since I had already over done it this week. The first course came and we both loved the dishes: salad and beet soup.  When the waiter brought the second course, he asked if Denton  wanted another drink.  He asked for the menu to check out some other options.   And then, we waited.  And then we waited some more.  And some more.  Finally, our second course came.  I devoured my mini-short rib burgers (most excellent) while Denton had the Meat and Potatoes (good).  After the course arrived, the waiter *finally* came back to take his drink order.   I was annoyed because I was ready to leave until Denton reminded me that we still had another course to go.  The third course finally arrived: roasted ono.  It was really good but at that point, I wanted to go.  2.5 hours is way to long for three courses of small plates.  I'm all about enjoying your meal but this was ridiculous.

I went with a group and I ordered the three course meal, which is prix fixe style of about 40 bucks.  The three courses are mainly two appetizers and a main course.  For the appetizer, I ordered sushi, which, to my dismay, you must eat with a fork because there are no chopsticks.  Who eats sushi with a fork?  Now, I've never eaten sushi with a fork, so that by itself is an adventure on its own.  Sushi is a delicate type of food, so I'm not used to stabbing raw fish with a fork.  The other point is the Sushi wasn't really sushi and it wasn't sashimi...it was fish over avocado without rice.  I know the chef wants to push boundaries, but if the menu lists ""sushi"" I expect sushi. For the second appetizer, I ordered crab cakes.  Picture crab cakes.  Got the image?  Now just flip that 180 degrees and think completely out of the box.  I thought I would receive crab cakes as per the menu, but I really received crab pan-cakes.  I mean, I felt like I was eating breakfast, and I needed some Aunt Jemima's syrup on the side.  What irks me is that there is so little crab, and a la carte, the crab cakes were the most expensive item in the section ($15).  I really really expected crab but got more flour and dough than crab.  Sorry, but there really needs to be either 1) more crab 2) no pancake 3) change name to crab pancake or 4) lower the price a la carte. For the main course, I had the halibut, which by itself was very good in my opinion.  It was a large filet of halibut, which was welcoming, and most importantly, it was tender, flavorful, and nourishing.  This for a-la-carte was $18 which was $3 more than the crab cakes but was eons better.  I say crab cakes needs a complete makeover because I should have ordered two halibuts instead of having the halibut/crab cake combo. Service and effort could have been a lot better for a higher end place.  Food came very slow (total dinner time was 3 hours).  Water and plates weren't replenished for an hour.  The explanations for each food were, however, informative. In summary, my advice is to skip the crab cakes and sushi, and place more emphasis on the halibut.  Also, leverage the other reviews for drinks.",0.9784,0.881,0.089,0.03,0.5309062960848674

One thing I commend Chef Lacasse is for his creativity and his effort of cocktail pairing.  Many of his dishes are deconstructed and unexpected.  I tried the ""fish & chips"" and it was a dish that made you go hmmm, interesting (while you raise one eyebrow).  But, I'm not sure it's something I'm willing to dish out $11 for again.  I think I would enjoy the Drawing Room much more if they had more small plates priced under $10.   As far as ambiance and decor, it's definitely an eye appealing lounge.  I liked that it wasn't too crowded.  The lounge chair was a bit awkward at first because there was an arm rest on only one side, so I felt unbalanced and was unconsciously leaning to one side.

As I've mentioned before, I love a classic cocktail so I was all about the table side preparation of the drinks.  Both of the cocktail chefs who came by were very knowledgeable and personable, answering questions but still having a good time with it.  On round 2, our server asked if I would still like the table side preparation.  Ummm, YES!  I don't mind waiting.  The chairs are super comfortable, I want one.  Wonder if they'd miss it...hmmm....might be hard to get up the stairs, though...  And for $14 a drink, I might as well get a show too! The drinks were all made with local and homemade ingredients.  My favorite story was about the local couple who quit their jobs and now make absinthe in their home in the 'burbs.  Sounds like a plan to me!  I was glad the drinks were explained because I really noticed the complexities in each cocktail.  I tried the Nooner and the Back to the Stick.  The Nooner was amazing, and really does have 3 stages of taste.  The Back to the Stick was also great, and not sweet at all despite the use of egg white and torched bitters.  Both cocktails were extremely well balanced and just, well, delightful! So on to the food.  We ordered the mahi mahi with tempura avocado, potato flight, burger, and the hangar steak.  All of the food was very good, and despite the small portions, we were both full after sharing these four dishes.  The standouts were the burger and the potato flight.  The white cheddar & nutmeg gratin with crispy pork belly was A-mazing and I loved the spicy home made pickles with the burger.   So I'm in love...again.  Drawing Room, how dare you change your menu and cocktail list so often, you know I can't stay away!  I left so happy last night, so today I'll just have to bask in the afterglow until next time. hehehe hehe",0.9989,0.742,0.231,0.026,0.5350396825396826

Had some friends in from out of town and took a chance it might be a good place. I went to Le Passage when it first opened and it sort of freaked me out that it was in a basement - so I have been hesitant to try the Drawing Room because it's connected to Le Passage in the former Ya Bar (or whatever it was called). It's small, intimate and the decor is loungy and inviting. It reminded me a lot of the Shochu Lounge at Roka - also in a basement. It didn't feel as ""basementy"" as I had remembered - probably because they have their own entrance. It was pretty dead for a Saturday night at 8:30 and I was able to get a seat right away at the bar (the seats are really comfortable - plus). The bartender was really friendly, helpful and knew what he was doing. We enjoyed chatting with them and learned a few things. I had the Bellini, my friends tried a few of the other concotions and enjoyed them - I like that they use fresh ingredients.   We sat for dinner and, again, the seating was really comfortable - the chairs were very cushy and had a sort of wrap around back and arm rest. The food concept is small plates and we tried almost one of everything on the menu - everything we had was delicious - the biggest hit was the ""burger"" - beef sparerib with (i think) a sun-dried tomato sauce.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly - all the staff members were nice enough but not over the top. It got a bit busier around 10 - I'd imagine that given how late they serve dinner, it's a good late night dining spot. Because of their concept and pricing, the crowd is definitely a more mature crowd - a good mix of people in the neighborhood, etc. I think if you want to go to the club - they discount/don't charge cover, but not totally sure because we didn't ask about it.  The only negative thing that stood out to me was how quiet it was - when it's not busy, silence makes for a strange ambience in that type of setting.

We went with cart service (drinks were prepared tableside), where our mixologist prepared our beverages while giving us the history and chemistry behind the cocktails. Ask about the ice, it's totally neat!  Taste: I went with the Definitive Manhattan... And then back for a second! All I have to say is that it was by far the BEST Manhattan I have E-V-E-R had. Made just the way I like my cocktails, smooth, classic and ""sexual"" (sorry, inside joke. I couldn't resist!).  If you are in the city visiting or you live there, I highly recommend you visit this ""magnificent"" find!",0.9794,0.797,0.169,0.034,0.5341773504273504
2008-04-14,2.0,"Went with a group of ladies, we received a free bottle of champagne and that really helped set the mood. I decided to get the pork ribs which were pretty good they had a smoked chili honey sauce and was served on top of a poppy seed slaw, now I wish I would've tried my friends 'burger' which was a braised beef short rib with a bun.  I also ordered the lemon lavender risotto which was really good.  I can't recall the drink I had but I remember enjoying it.   Gosh if I could only remember what I had for dessert because I devoured it. I wouldn't come here often because I need a much larger meal, I'm not so good with the tiny portions ;)",0.9716,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.6307692307692307
2008-04-14,4.0,"So I went here last Thursday with a group of friends for dinner and I had a really nice time. The whole atmosphere is cozy and private.  We had the whole back section also which made it nicer.  I ended up having the 'burger' with spicy pickles, bacon and sauce as my entre. For desert had the apple desert (4got the name, sorry) but it was really good. The French 75 cocktail was REALLY good. Overall I had a great experience here.  Our server was very attentative and helpful. I must say the best part though is having your cocktails mixed right in front of you or next to the table. Great place. Check it out!",0.99,0.733,0.267,0.0,0.425125313283208
2008-03-26,3.0,"I absolutely love Shawn McClain so for me to give 3 stars here evenwith those ""fish in chips"" which are completely off the chain is tough to do. That however is what I'm doing. I was in here on a Friday night and it was refreshingly not too busy which was a good thing because this mixologist operation tableside is kinda fun but it really takes a long time.  First though, let me hit the food. The food is good. If you leave without getting the 'Fish n' Chips', you are missing out. I also had the crab cakes which were solid but not spectacular. I thought the same of the 'Greek Salad'. It was an interesting interpretation of the dish but it didn't really shock me. I needed the name Greek Salad to realize that this was the origin of the dish.  If this was just a review of the food, I'd give Drawing Room 4 stars. However, the mixologist thing seems great in theory and I think it could be. However, it took at least 10 minutes to make two of our drinks tableside without as much ""education"" here as one might think. I don't know about you, but I'm looking to get my drink on a little faster after a long week, so this just took too long and I didn't notice much difference from a traditional pour that I might get at my local watering hole. I was reluctant to order another cocktail and switched to beer due to being bored with the whole thing. I think they need to work on this execution.  The food is good, the decor is nice, the execution though is probably a little flawed. Still, it's worth a spin one time. I could see some people really thinking this was the bee's knees. I'm just not one of them.",0.978,0.857,0.11,0.033,0.42207207207207204
2008-02-14,4.0,"Stunning space with excellent and chic small plates and cocktails.  This place has gone from clubby celeb hangout to a more relaxed, lounge-y vibe.  I hope it succeeds, and actually appreciate the makeover.   For the food, I especially enjoyed Shawn McClain's uber-tasty salt cod begniet bites!  A tasty, compact little popper!  Perfect!",0.981,0.577,0.423,0.0,0.6222222222222222
2008-02-04,4.0,"I wanted to give The Drawing Room 4 and 1/2 stars, but do we have the option?  People, please, work with me here. The Drawing Room may simply have the best tasting food in town.  This place is serious about what it offers and will accept all challengers.   Though I have dined there three times, my most memorable experiences were the fish and chips and the burger. And though it may sound like standard bar fare to some of you foodies, The Drawing Room takes it to not just another level, BUT TEN ADDITIONAL LEVELS!! and what the hell, A BONUS ROUND!!! ::ahem:: The bonus round being the fabulous service and fantastic design.

2008-01-27,5.0,"Love this place! I just had dinner and cocktails with friends here and we couldn't stop talking about how great it was. The highlight of the evening was the ""master bartender"" who mixed our cocktails table-side.  She was a walking encyclopedia of mixology and had us all so entertained that one of my friends nearly proposed by the end of the night.   The drinks were exceptional and the hospitality/educational/entertainment value really made the evening special.   I expected that the food would take a back seat to the cocktails since the Drawingroom is more of a cocktail lounge than a restaurant, but our meal was also top notch.  The menu consists of small plates, but unlike other tapas restaurants, each dish is like a mini entree -- complex, beautifully presented, with a mix of foods and flavors, rather than just one dish.  The sushi and tempura plate and the crabcakes (more like crab pancakes... very interesting twist) were highlights.  And the lemon and lavender risotto was rich, delicious... perfect. The atmosphere was elegant, understated and not snooty as I feared it might be.  We were especially delighted by the chairs -- a cross between easy chairs and dining chairs -- comfy, but not the kind of thing you sink so far into that you can't eat your meal. A great place for a date or special occasion!",0.997,0.727,0.273,0.0,0.6178996598639458
