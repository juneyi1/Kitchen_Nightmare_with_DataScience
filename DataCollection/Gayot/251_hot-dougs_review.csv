2015-01-19,5.0,"I was warned about the huge line, and I was not disappointed: it was. Arrive early to secure a seat in this colorful oasis of dog-dom. Their famous foie gras hot dog ($10; cash only) was a bit ridiculous, richer than it needed to be. Of course we ordered it, since, you know, YOLO. Did I mention the truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de Sel on it? Don't get me wrong, it's decadently delicious, but you won't (or shouldn't) have it daily if you know what's good for you. On the more rational side of things, the Anna Kendrick dog (formerly the Keira Knightley) was a mere $3. It's essentially a Chicago dog, tender and topping-packed. My friend (visiting from California) and I agreed it was a hit, and reveled in its deliciousness. I was lucky enough to see Doug, and I told him he rocked. Chipper guy!

2014-10-03,5.0,"Think it is only fitting to write my review of HD's on their last day of business.  Came exactly 2 weeks ago with a friend on a Foodie Crawl of Chicago.  We waited exactly 3 hours in the line, from 8:45-11:45am and which with the hype and wait times of this week seems like a miracle!  See my review of that experience under ""Hot Doug's Waiting Line"". Food:  So worth it.  This definitely IS the encased meat emporium!  I wish I could have done what the large group behind us did, which was all 6 of them ordered 3-4 items each and split all around to try as much as possible but my friend and I just had too much eatin' to do in 3 short days.  I'm glad they at least convinced us that it was sheer insanity to only order 1 item to split between us.  There is no way you could compare the 2 items we had in any way with a standard hot dog.  We got the ""Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel"" and the ""Lamb and Pork Belly Sausage with Mufaletta-Onion Butter, Double Cream Brie Cheese, and Tomato Preserves"".  I mean, who comes up with this stuff? It was AH-MAH-ZING!  (And poking around online it looks like the sausage + sauce + toppings combo switches up like one of those roulette tables depending on the day!) We also got the duck fat fries, well, because it was Friday and we could. Doug: As nice and chatty as everything i've read since going.  He gave props to my hometown of Seattle and said it was one his favorite cities in the country and one of the few other places he'd live.  Asked if I brought him a porchetta sandwich from Salumi but had never heard of Paseo.  He wrote it down to remember, and i'm going on record to say that if you contact me while in Seattle, Doug, i'll take you there and even take care of the check. :) RIP Hot Doug's~  A very fond memory of your fair city for my foodie friend and I!",0.994,0.826,0.154,0.02,0.5531169994879671

First, I should tell you that we got in line at 3am so that I could get to work around noon. Yes, even though we were 15 in line we did not get out of of here until 1145. It was totally worth it.  If you are going to get in line I would say to get there before 5 AM so that you don't have to wait until close to place your order. Bring some coffee and snacks, and definitely bring a chair.  The food:   The shrimp and grits: absolutely delicious. I never thought you could have a sausage made out of shrimp and it would taste so amazing. Then the grits, cheese ,and Dijon mustard on top. Genius The cheeseburger sausage:  this one was really tasty too. It tasted like a cheeseburger, but fancier I guess. It was really good.  The ribeye with chimichurri:  this one was pretty good but not as good as the two above. It was a little dry, but I liked the chimichurri.  Corndog:  this was fried it to the perfect Golden crisp Cheese fries:  some of the best cheese fries I have ever had. And to be honest, If someone hadn't told me to get these, I never would've thought to order them. I thought this place was all about the encased meets. But man, you're really have to get the cheese fries too. I am a little sad that I will never been able to try the duck fat fries,  as you can only get those on Friday.  Doug:  super nice and totally patient with everyone. We got a to go order of an andouille sausage, a brat and that specialty chili.  The brat and andouille were standard, as expected, but the chili was really good.  Glad we got food to go!",0.9965,0.808,0.182,0.01,0.5762254901960784

2014-09-29,5.0,"Although Doug is closing up shop, I wanted to leave a review for those that have 8-9 hours to kill in line. God knows you have time to read all 3300+ reviews before Doug even opens the door.  I've had Hot Doug's bookmarked since 2012 but was never brave enough to wait in line. Leave it to me to wait until the final week and really learn what waiting is all about.  We dined today 9/29. The first person in line was a diehard Doug's fan that had been coming for years. He decided to take up an offering and run to the liquor store and get Doug a going away bottle of Scotch. We later learned that Doug's office is filled with tons of bottles of Scotch from others that thought of doing the same. He was still super appreciative and grateful. Some may not understand waiting in line for a hot dog, but I was buying into more than just the food he was serving. This is a guy that could keep working and make hand over fist for a few more years, but he's decided to walk away to do something else. You have to appreciate those in life that don't think money is the end all be all. THAT is why I waited today.  So how bad was the wait? Jeff, # 1 in line, arrived at 1:30 AM. We were # 10 and arrived at 4:30 AM. There was much abuzz in the lines by those diehards who all admit that they'd be camping out Thursday night for the final day. If you're planning on making the trip Friday, I don't think midnight would be too early, maybe even earlier if you could swing it. (suggestion, check Twitter and search tweets to see if anyone has started lining up) Line survival tips- *Don't cut. There was a grandma and her son about 5-10 behind us. When WGN showed up, they decided to go talk to the camera crews and just keep their place in line. To make it worse, their family showed up 30 minutes before they opened and acted like it was all cool. Of course, they were also the ones that had no idea what they wanted so they took their sweet time. It took everything within me to not tell them to get back in line where they were.  *Bring a chair, book, electronic device with tons of battery power, food (enough to share gets you bonus points), and possibly a blanket.  *The wait does go quickly. We waited just under 7 hours but it didn't feel that long. Am I crazy? Sure but I'd do it again tomorrow if I had anyone to go with.  *Don't try selling your spot in line. Doug's not okay with it so don't do it! *8am is too late. Today, 8 am would have bought you a 9+ hour wait but I'm sure the line will be cut off even earlier for the rest of the week Food- *Tater tots - so crispy that I swear they may have been deep fried twice.  *Fries - I sadly never got to try the duck fat fries I heard so much about but the regular fries were so delicious. They were nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  *Corn dog - deep fried and delicious. It puts your local carnival dogs to shame *Brat with sauerkraut, caramelized onions and mustard - I brought this home and heated it up in the microwave and it was still fantastic. The meat was so juicy on the inside and the toppings had plenty of black pepper.  *Veal saltimbucca sausage - I will die dreaming about this sausage. Definitely the best thing I've ever put in my mouth and I can't even quite describe why. Every flavor was perfectly balanced and I loved the sauce and cheese on top *Shrimp and grits sausage - this is only one small notch behind the veal for best thing I ever ate. I was a skeptic but Doug won me over.  If I had to do it all over again, i'd skip the sides and regular dogs to try more of the specialty sausages.

My suggestion is to get a mix between the regular items and the specialty items because the specialty is pretty heavy and savory. The regular items like the bratwurst have a nice balance between salt and acidity. I actually liked the bratwurst out of all the dogs. Cheese fries are good and well portioned.

2014-09-20,5.0,I really expected this place to be over rated but I was mistaken. Since Hot Dougs is an experience here is the tale of my journey: My boyfriend and I arrived on the scene at around 9:30 am. Hot Dougs does not open till 10:30 so we were prepared to wait. We were lucky and beat the crazy crowd that gathers at around 10 and we ended scoring a decent spot in line right where the chain fence begins. We waited and waited and finally the line began to move! We ended up at the counter at 11:30! We already had our order planned so we rattled it off to Doug who was so nice but quite chatty which is why the line takes so long! We actually ended up being a few dollars short and Doug said it was no problem! I was blown away by how nice that was and really shows how much he cares about his customers.  Now onto the most important part the food! We ordered:  -a Chicago style dog -a corn dog -a bratwurst with mustard  -an Italian sausage   -the apple cinnamon pork sausage with sheep cheese and apricot drizzle  -an order of duck fat fries  I was stuffed after eating fries and the brat but tried to power through to eat the pork sausage because OH BABY IT WAS AMAZING! I did get so full I couldn't finish it but I seriously have never tasted a better sausage in my life.  To top it all off the service of Doug and the other employees is spectacular! Everyone is so nice.  My recommendation is order one of the specialty dogs! They may be pricey but they are worth every penny. I hope I'll be able to come back before the close one more time to try something else because honestly if I could I would eat everything on the menu but sadly my little tummy just can't handle all that encased meat.,0.9837,0.81,0.131,0.059,0.5691876750700281

Arriving at 10:30am on Saturday, we watched as the line stretched down and down the block. It looked as though we'd be waiting two, maybe three hours max, but time just marched on inexorably as we shuffled ever closer to the front. We waited so long that I was concurrently able to try Honey Butter Fried Chicken, an awesome eatery on the other end of the block. But more on that another time. As the sun began to set and we inched along the off-red brick of Hot Doug's itself, I could only apologize to the group is brought with for the long wait. I was impressed they'd stuck it out so long when we'd watch others give up or outright complain constantly throughout the course of the day with mismanaged expectations of what to expect from a food hot spot closing in less than a month. I bet you're wondering, ""Okay, but was it exceptional when we got in the door?"" It was. Doug was so immensely polite and friendly, it was flattering to have ordered from the guy. $93 dollars later before tip and having waited to try it, damn right it was.  Everything from the Alligator to the Foie Gras was staggeringly good. Even The Dog, the one and only Chicago-style hotdog was able to easily raise the bar on what encased meats we should all be savoring. Think I'm crazy to have waited it out? Maybe. But I'd do it again in a heartbeat to have one more dog at Doug's before their last on 10/3. It's, dare I say, a Chicago institution I'd overlooked for far too long.

I came on Saturday 09/13 at 10 am.  Line was very slow moving and waited 8 hours to get my food!  We estimated 4 hours at the most for a popular place that was closing.  Not sure if they were backed up in the kitchen, but I would never have gotten in line if I knew I would wait 8 hours.  But after waiting so long, it's like how can you leave after investing so much time in line. But once we finally got to order, we were greeted by Doug himself.  Considering the long line and tremendous amount of orders he had to take, he was so calm and friendly.  Even though the place closes at 4, his promise is to serve everyone that got in line before 4.  I wouldn't be surprised if his staff and himself stayed till 10. But the food was quite good.  Very exotic and delicious.  I would never condone waiting in line for even 4 hours, much less 8 for any food.  But.... it's a story I can live to tell and say that I got to experience the famous Hot Doug's.  Doug himself deserves all the good things that people say about him and his food.",0.9879,0.815,0.17,0.015,0.6787777777777777
2014-09-14,1.0,"I had the worst experience of my foodie life at Hot Doug's.  This place has always been on my bucket list so when I heard about it closing I knew the clock was ticking and I had to get there.  I found a free Saturday and made the trek to California and Roscoe, arriving at 10:15 am.  The place opens up at 10:30 and there's already a line 2 blocks long.  I park about 2 blocks away and take my place in line.  It was a sunny day but chilly, about 50-55 degrees.  Reading the Yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait a few hours but I knew there would be a payoff so I hunkered down.   Well this line was the slowest moving line I have ever seen and it seemed to move slower the closer I got to the door (or maybe that was just my perception).  Actually, there were a lot of people holding spots for groups that would show up as they got near the front so the line actually did get longer the closer I got.  This line was so long people would bring in food from other places to eat while waiting.  What I wouldn't give for a porta-potty! So 2 hours go by, then 3, then 4 and I'm still pretty far back.  At 3:30, which by that time meant I had been there 5 hours, a lady from the restaurant comes out and announces to the line that technically the place closes at 4:00 but they will serve anyone that is in line by that time.  She said things were moving slower because they only had one person taking orders (Doug) so please be patient.  Ok, I've been standing here for 5 hours - WTF does ""please be patient"" mean?  I did a quick calculation of my situation - still at least 50 people ahead of me and we're not moving.   Another 30 minutes goes by and I have advanced about 10 feet.  By now my bladder is about to burst, I'm having back spasms, and my feet are swollen like melons.  And I'm so hungry anything would taste good. So 4:30 comes around which is drop dead time for me - gotta get back home because I have DINNER RESERVATIONS at another restaurant.  I had been in this f*cking line for 6 hours and still had at least an hour before getting in the door.  With mixed emotions (mainly rage) I admitted defeat, turned around and headed to my car.   On the way, I checked out the inside of Hot Doug's through the window.  Doug (apparently) was at the register and there were two or three people in a tiny prep area making food.  There were empty seats!  For as long as people were waiting and with the simmering dissatisfaction that I was overhearing from many people in the line, the restaurant itself looked pretty serene.  Heck if I've waited 6+ hours to sit down I'm not getting up too soon. This was quite simply the most frustrating and humiliating experience of my foodie life.  I feel like a total idiot because of sausage!  I'm not sure why Doug has decided to close his restaurant but I wonder if it's because it's so ridiculous?  People standing in line for hours on end for hot dogs?  He doesn't appear to care about the people in line - no updates, no time estimates.   No care to make his operation more efficient so to serve people more quickly.  Looking back, I'm glad that I didn't get a hot dog ... the best hot dog I never had!  Makes me wonder about all the 5 star reviews ... after investing so much time, it surely must have been the best f*cking hot dog ever.   Actually, I was thinking about eating grass so a hot dog would have been at least 5 stars. On my way back to the car I passed by Honey Butter Fried Chicken.  I ducked in there, visited the bathroom (aaaahhhh...) and ordered a chicken sandwich to go.  Now that, my friends, was the best f*cking best chicken sandwich ever.",0.9778,0.797,0.116,0.087,0.547919584500467

We saw the extremely long line and thought, why the hell isn't everyone at work?  Regardless, we decided to go for it.  After 45 minutes, we realized the line hadn't moved that much.  But at that point, we'd driven our asses there, we'd already waited, whatever.  We'd committed. FOUR hours later, Doug greeted us at the counter to take our order.  Doug's the only one taking orders.  He's very friendly, will make small talk, take pictures with people, etc.  You realize why the line moves so slowly.  On the upside, it's not a zoo inside, which does help. We ordered a number of the daily special dogs (all good, I don't think you can really go wrong here), the duck fat fries (meh, I'd heard so much about them and there was no way they were going to meet expectations) and the corn dog, which I thought was the underdog of the bunch (see what I did there?).  Corn dogs are usually mushy and gross, but this was crisp and delicious.  We wanted another, but that would have required going back to the end of the line.  And that wasn't happening. Honestly, I'd say go since it's closing and the wait is part of the experience.  Or maybe I'm just telling myself that so I don't feel like such a schmuck for spending a day in line for wieners. I also just noticed that Yelp categorizes Hot Doug's under fast food lolololol.",0.3317,0.857,0.078,0.066,0.45436507936507936
2014-09-05,5.0,"I'm so sad to see this place close its doors, but if you can get a day off and go before the end, I give it my absolute highest recommendation. Doug is the nicest guy and this place just doesn't open unless he's behind the counter. Cheery, down to chat. Doug's a guy to meet for encased meat at least once in your life.  Duck fat fries (Friday and Saturday only), exotic dogs (duck meat, lamb, boar sausage, rattlesnake etc.) grace the menu week after week. Hot dog memorabilia litter the walls. THEY HAVE FRESCA (huge plus for me. Non-grandma sodas also available).  All the employees are gracious and accommodating. When I realized I had a medical condition aggravated by gluten-related inflammation, I got the go-ahead to bring my own gluten-free buns to Doug's.  Honestly, the line has been out of control since Doug announced the closing, but I do assure you it's worth the wait. Pro tip: Show up at quarter to 9:00a and you'll have the shortest wait time.

At 11 we had placed our order and the food arrived quickly. Between the two of us we ordered 6 hot dogs and 2 small fries. That was A LOT of food, but we finished it!

2014-09-03,5.0,"I've been warned about the Hot Doug's wait, so I wasn't surprised to see the line. However I never expected to be waiting almost 5 hours! I thought maybe 3, at most 4...I've waited 3 hours for grilled cheese before. This totally takes the cake though. Doug should sell shirts that say ""we made it!"" because I can't believe I spent most of my day in line for a hot dog. I had to though, I was visiting from California and wanted to try this place before it closed forever. The reason why the line takes forever, is probably because they have only one person working the front counter taking orders- Mr. Doug himself! What a charming and sanguine man he is. You can tell, just talking to him in the first few minutes, that he is a very worldly person. The decor inside is quirky and charming. So many hot dog paraphernalia and saturated primary colors. Kinda retro, makes me sad that this place is closing, when I just finally met it. There was plenty of seating, and they do have their own bathroom for use (thank god because it looked like there was nothing else in the area!). I was a little timid going to this place, since I don't eat mammals. But he had a lot of poultry based sausages as well as a vegetarian sausage. Plenty of places do poultry hot dogs, but the problem is that they usually use pork or lamb casing...I asked Doug if he does the same and he assured me that he doesn't! Either it'll have no casing or a gelatin casing (still not completely pork free though but it's a start!). I got the turducken sausage. It's turkey, duck, and chicken, all in one! On top of that it had cranberries, cherries, raspberry cheese, and pumpkin raita (Indian yogurt based sauce!). Guys. It was amazing!! Now I'm REALLY bummed it's closing. It was not overly salty, and the flavors were so unique. This totally beats Wurstkuche in LA (which I can only eat veggie dogs anyways). Very glad I tried this place. Also ordered some duck fat fries since it was one of those special days that they serve them...not the best! I've had better duck fat fries in LA (Beer Belly!)..these tasted slightly burnt and too salty.  Just go for the hot dogs!!! You will be missed Doug!",0.9708,0.859,0.094,0.047,0.6377177700348432

I just went along with it and after 4 hours of waiting in line... we finally got to EAT! We ordered 4 hot dogs and an order of duck fat fries with cheese on the side. Ok ok ok... hands down... my favorite hot dog was the FOIS GRAS. Rich, buttery, salty... just foodgasmic was all that is the fois gras hot dog.

2014-09-01,4.0,"When we visited for lunch, I wanted to try their take on a Chicago-style dog, as well as one of the specials of the week. Along my with Chicago dog, I also ordered The Badger - a beer & cheddar pork sausage with Anti-Hero IPA mustard, cheddar-garlic cheese spread & bacon lardons. Both were very good, but I think I was actually a bigger fan of the Chicago dog. While I really liked the creamy, cheddar-garlic cheese spread on The Badger, there is something about the ingredients on a Chicago dog that I find to be just right. Fresh tomatoes, a dill pickle spear, celery salt, onions, relish and a grilled hot dog on a poppyseed bun are simply meant to be together. My wife tried the alligator sausage, which was good, but didn't have any type of distinct flavor to make it very unique. Had it been randomly served to us, I doubt I would have known it was alligator meat. Along with our various dogs, we also tried the duck fat fries. These are only available at Hot Doug's on Fridays and Saturdays, and we lucked out by visiting on a Saturday. To be honest, I'd say these are overrated. Similar to the alligator, I wouldn't have known the fries were cooked in duck fat if it didn't say so on the menu. They're still good fries, but I'd just stick with a regular order of french fries and save the extra couple dollars. Our entire meal was $25, which seemed relatively reasonable for the amount of food we received.

I've been born and raised in Chicago, but couldn't call myself a true Chicagoan until I experienced the wonderfulness of Hot Doug's. It all started with waiting in line. An angry man who parked nearby drove away in his car and yelled, ""It's people like you that are waiting in line that keep peeing on my car!"" It's free entertainment like that that makes Chicago so special. This was my friend's and I first time at Hog Doug's, and we just happened to be standing alongside two groups of regulars. In fact, the guy in front of us had me hold his place in line by using his bottle of scotch that he bought for Doug as a gift. Once we finally got into the air conditioned restaurant, we decided on four hot dogs to share among us two. We ordered the celebrity dog which had Mezcal, chorizo, and tomatillo on top. Also had the foie gras, apple and bacon smoked sausage, and porcini and parmesan. All of them were DELICIOUS and unlike anything you've ever tasted before. TIP: Only order the celebrity or game of the week hot dogs. People in line will secretly make fun of you for ordering the corn dog. I mean come on, you waited 3 hours in line for THAT??

2014-08-29,5.0,"Yea, yea, yea, 3000+ reviews and counting and everyone in the loop, as in the Chicago Loop, knows that Hot Doug's will be PERMANENTLY shutting their doors after October 3rd despite being one of the most popular joints to get a dog in the city. In a way, it's kind of admirable that Doug (who isn't hot, but short and balding resembling the very sausages he serves) decided to shut his restaurant than to be a greedy wiener by selling the place for some poser to run.  So yes, as an out-of-towner, I had to get my hands on Hot Doug's before they closed just so that I could say that I tried it. And as one of the dads in the 2-hour-fucking-line told his son, ""anyone can go to Disneyland, but not everyone can say that they have been to Hot Doug's"".  Preach on pops, preach on.  Now waiting in line at Hot Doug's is an experience in itself with various milestones. Since I arrived at 11:50 AM, there was at least a 60-person line outside the restaurant. It also meant that I would end up waiting in the sun for 50 minutes.  Which led to the first milestone - shade.  You see, 50 minutes in the sun combined with the humid ass Chicago summer not only gives you a sweaty wiener, but it makes you cranky and angry to the point that even the SPF feels like it isn't working. I was even tempted to buy an ice cream from the opportunistic Hispanic ice cream cart vendor, but I held on until I got to the shade.   After getting to the shade came the next milestone - getting into the building. This took another 50 minutes. Reaching the second milestone is quite an achievement since if you have reached this point, you are pretty much committed as well as cotton-mouthed dehydrated and delirious from hunger. Once you get passed the doors you quickly forget about the hours waiting. Once inside comes the third milestone - deciding what to eat and then ordering with Doug. This takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes as the line finally decreases to where you tell Doug what you want and hand him your cash. At this point, the pain in your heels is forgotten and you even forget about your urges to punch the shit out of the Asian tourists that got to Hot Doug's before they opened at 10:30 and then smugly took photos of you waiting in line as they exited the restaurant.  And of course the final milestone would be the following - finding a seat and finally getting your hot dogs, which takes about 5 minutes. That's right, after 2 hours, I ordered not one, but two hot dogs to devour. One for each hour of pain. What amazed me is that I ate them in what seemed like less than 2 minutes.  As for the hot dogs themselves, the buns were simple and had a coating of ""poppy"" seeds, which undoubtedly added to the ""high"" of finally getting food in my belly. I ordered The Dog and the Malin Akerman and both sausages were grilled to perfection. And of course I put the works on them which included the most delightfully neon green relish that I have ever seen. I wanted to ""relish the relish"" and savor each bite, but after being famished and suffering from heatstroke, I heaved them down so quickly that I would have made Joey Chestnut fucking proud.  Now was the wait worth it? Probably not. But at the end of the day, not everyone can say that they have been to Hot Doug's. So yea ""do do do do do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do do do do DO!"" Do the Dougie before they are gone forever! I must be a masochist because despite the 2-hour wait for a 2-minute meal, I am giving them 5 stars.

Two block line down the street by opening and we ordered by 11. The line does move fast, but it's humongous. Down to business: ordered 5 dogs so I could try a bunch and a friend got two more, plus duck fat fries, some specialty sodas, and a T-shirt just for good measure. Won't be going back ever again, right? I should stress that when you get there, there is no chance of being disappointed with the regular menu, let alone the specials. These are spot on renditions every time, and well worth the less than $4 for the classics. First, my one beef: the duck fat fries were way too hyped up to me. They were crispy, not bad, but I might as well not have known they were special. I expected some popping flavor or a great sauce but had to grab ketchup. Don't sweat it if you can't go Fri or Saturday for these! Now, the main attraction-- encased meat! Yes, you're reading these descriptions correctly... Kale, Walnut and Raisin Pork Sausage with Curry-Coconut Mayonnaise, Jalapeño Havarti Cheese and Crispy Smoked Pancetta-- my personal favorite, if only because it tasted a little more familiar than the other specials. F-ing phenomenal, not too messy and layered with flavors. Über Garlic Pork Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise, Carrigaline Cheese and Garlic Confit-- Not shy about the garlic, but luckily it's roasted so you won't have to worry about what your date will say. A good take on polish sausage. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel-- it's hard to taste past the topped foie gras, which after a bite for me was great in an earthy way. This really packs a punch, so don't say you were never warned. Apricot, Paneer Cheese and Garam Masala Lamb Sausage with Vindaloo Mayonnaise and Buttered Apples-- finished sweet and with some fruit flavors on top of savory lamb. Couldn't have asked for better from anyone else with these ingredients. The Atomic Bomb: Damn Spicy Jack Cheese-Stuffed Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Smoked Onion Marmalade and Pepper Jack Cheese-- this is what my friend got. Look closely and you'll see the menu warn you that every ingredient is spicy. But, when you're done you'll be crying in pleasure. (Unlimited water, too) The Dog, Chicago Style-- nothing out of place here, you can eat it whole, piece by piece, or any other method, it has all the right seasoning. A true classic. The Corn Dog-- the best I've ever had in my long, sordid history with meats on sticks. The batter is sweet, flaky, and just the right temperature to alleviate any scalding hot wiener fears. Had some ketchup on top to finish. There won't be another place like Hot Doug's, it will be sorely missed. Honored to have gone in the nick of time.

But even with all that, I think I would've left feeling exactly the same -- it wasn't worth the wait. I arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I ate 4.5 hours later. The hot dogs were average. The duck fat fries were cold and many were hollow and dry inside -- they tasted like they had been sitting for a while. The corn dog tasted like the ones you get from Sam's Club. It was food I'm not sure I'd even buy had I been able to walk up and order straight away. Add the excessive wait and I left feeling like everyone who passed by watching us stand in line felt -- all of you guys are idiots.

As always, none of the sausages disappoint. Ended up trying 3 this time: 1) The Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Foie Gras Rouille, Sheep's Milk Brigante Cheese and Port-Soaked Dried Cherries was amazing! It's not as creamy as the foie gras with truffle dog, but combination of flavors with the cherries and cheese was unbelievable! 2) Escargot and Guanciale Sausage with Parsley-Garlic Butter and Double Crème Brie Cheese. This was my favorite this trip. I'm a sucker for brie cheese; compliments just about any meat well. The escargot in the sausage wasn't that noticeable. But the garlic butter was ha! 3) Hunter's-Style Venison Sausage with Smokey Bacon Sauce, Emmental Cheese and Chicken-Veal Pâté. This is also a can't miss. Smokey bacon sauce and veal pate = winner!

Here are some suggestions: bring a chair and something to drink while waiting in line. Yes the line is like this all day, every day.  Once you get inside, check out the today's special board and the game of the week. This is where to order from.

I don't think I would have waited in line if we hadn't gotten there a little early.

2014-07-31,5.0,"This is a late Yelp review but a recent Yahoo article stating the top 10 longest restaurant lines in America prompted me to give my praise for this institution. During my trip to Chicago last month hot dogs were a must and Hot Doug's was were it was at. We arrived around 11 which was about 30 minutes after opening and waited a mighty long 3 HOURS AND 14 MINUTES. I can safely say that I have never waited that long for anything in my life that is including Disneyland. Worth it? My advice if you are a tourist - try it on the weekdays (not including Friday) and you might be able to cut a little bit of time.  While you are waiting in line you can... talk to the people around you, observe how many people give up on the line, have your friends grab some ice cold water (there's an ice cream man who might come over and sell water for 3 bucks... ya 3 dollars), look up on your phone what specials they have for the day, dance... or maybe, don't dance since you might pass out from the heat But once you get there, this will be one of the best hot dogs you have had... they have an amazing selection ranging from duck sausage, steak sausage, chicken sausage... etc. All unique and wonderful choices. It may also be the most expensive hot dog in your life, but I assure you it is worth it. I had the Foie Gras topped Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli - Fancy Fast Food if there ever was! A bit on the shorter side but flavors so rich that a couple bites is definitely enough. I also had their Quarter Pound Cheddar Dog, topped with mustard and mayo... super super delicious and filling! I love how their dogs have a crispy outside and juicy delectable inside. In summary, my tips - come early on a weekday, bring water, and stay strong it is definitely worth the wait... you have until October, now GO!",0.9983,0.77,0.224,0.007,0.5877314814814816

It is my hope that Doug Sohn isn't just pulling a publicity stunt with the plans to close to just to make extra dough.  Every item on their menu is delicious, freshly cooked after your order, and served promptly after a brief wait at a table. I tried the garlic thuringer and the merguez. Plus a corn dog to wash it down... The staff here has a system where anyone ordering will always have a seat inside. The tables and floors are spotless, and the feng shui is rockin'!

We ordered four dogs and an order of duck fat fries, which was plenty. We ordered the dog, the Italian sausage, the hunters style venison sausage, and the foie dog. Our two favorites were surprisingly the two regular items... The dog and the Italian. The best of each I've ever had! The venison was smokey and creamy, but the foie was a little too rich for my taste. Could have used something crunchy to create a texture difference. But I'm glad I tried it. Duck fat fries were subtle and crispy...delicious! What surprised me the most was how friendly and accommodating everyone was. Doug himself was super friendly and treated you like you were the most important person there.

The menu is impressive. You can pick your own sausage, preparation and toppings, or get a special. The specials are gourmet and unusual, like Thai chicken or venison or escargot. You can have any sausage grilled (a clear choice), steamed, fried, or fried and grilled. You pick your toppings, from the basic Chicago dog toppings, with a bunch of other options. This seems like a place that wouldn't necessarily tolerate pickiness, but in fact they make it exactly to order, which is great and explains the wait. Cash only really annoys me, and it's not just a minimum to charge here, some people place big orders for lots of people, and it's still cash only. I think it shows a disconnect with customer preferences, and potentially shady behavior. But I can deal, and Doug's is up front about it. I didn't see an ATM, so I'd recommend having some cash on-hand before waiting in line. The staff made me forget my annoyance because they were very friendly and calm despite the hectic setting.

Now...the food is very good, but...definitely NOT worth waiting in line for, especially on a hot day! I wanted to go because I was working from home and could get there more easily than a standard day when I'm working downtown. My weekends are usually booked, so I knew my best shot was to go there on a day when I worked at home. Once we got inside, we quickly found out WHY the line is so freakin' long: Because Doug is quite chatty. Yup, we got in there, and Doug was talking with the group in front of us for at LEAST five minutes before he said, ""Okay, what'll it be?"" and took the order. Now....figure five minutes per party, that means that for every twelve orders that's an hour...three minutes, that's 20 parties per hour, etc. I had the chicken satay sausage special and the Paul Kelly, which is a beer-soaked brat, and cheese fries. Totally my fault for not checking, but the peanut sauce listed on the menu was loaded with chopped onions and peppers, both of which I despise. Unfortunately this meant that when I got home and discovered these ingredients I had to pretty much scrape the thing dry, but the sausage itself was...okay. That's about it. Nothing better than what you'd have if you took a chicken sausage and threw it on your Weber. Gotta tell ya this: the Paul Kelly was the best brat I've EVER had. Very nice! Fries? Well...boring. Yeah, I know, the duck fat fries are the bomb, but I was there on a Monday, and the duck fat fries are only available on Fridays and Saturdays...

On our first full day I decided to take my gf out to Hot Doug's to see what all the hype was about.  First off, the rails are not too close, so you will have to do a good amount of walking.  It didn't help that the buses that lead up to the trip had missed our stop 3 times and we had been sitting at the bus stop for over an hr. These guys close at 4 pm.  We did not really know what that meant, if they would stop serving at 4 pm or as long as you were in line you were good.  We arrived on the front side at around 3:50 so we figured we were good, there was a few people outside of the door, then we swung around the building and saw that the line was down the road.  We awaited, since we had already spent over an hr traveling to this place it was worth at least another 10 minutes to find out what happens. So right at 4 pm, they send an employee out with a sign that says we are now closed.  So if you are in line you will be served.  He stays outside with the sign the WHOLE time.  We were the 2nd to last people and 2 hrs later we were inside ordering. I ordered the pork belly, the foie gras, and the shrimp and grits, with an order of the cheese fries. Overall, I was not impressed by any of the sausages.  The foie gras was by far the best out of the 3, but it was not mind blowing.  If I was able to walk up and order without any wait, this place might warrant a 4 star at most.   The lines are possessively going to get longer and longer since they are closing their doors for good soon.  Check their website for hours, because they are closed on most holidays and some weekends.  It's all about supply and demand.",0.8828,0.914,0.053,0.033,0.3758901758901759

If Hot Doug's has been on your ""Bucket List"" of Chicago area hot dog joints to hit up, what the hell are you waiting for? GET your hot dog fix here before it is forever a memory.  I have always patronized Hot Doug's and have made the long trek to this place too many times to list here. I love their unique condiments and love the vibe that this place gives off. The customers are loyal, fun and interesting. I've never had a bad hot dog here, and it is definitely worth your time and gas (even if you have to drive a long way). People are never disappointed when they eat at Hot Doug's. People of all ages come here from near and far. If you build it and if you cook it to perfection they will come. The line starts forming about 30-minutes before the doors open for business. They take orders quickly and efficiently. The owner, Doug, is always there with a smile on his face and a passion for what he does. Thanks for the memories, Doug! TIP: Bring a portable chair in case you cannot get a table inside (table/seating is limited) and enjoy some people watching while sitting outside eating the best hot dog and fries ever!",0.9919,0.782,0.195,0.023,0.5510461760461761

Wasn't really sure how this little hot dog shack could ever rise to the levels of awesome that I'd read so much about, but after my first bite into their standard Chicago Style Dog, I was sold! Whatever they're doing to encase their meat is pure, unadultered genius. The meat takes on a smooth, softer, creamier texture. Maybe that's not how you want your meat described, but it's exactly what it is. There are none of those harder chewier bits I find in most hot dogs, and sausages you buy anywhere else. I also got myself one of the special blended meat sauages that day, it came with a house made thyme mustard that continued the silky, flavorful experience that was constant throughout my entire meal. The sausage filled with veal and pork was full of flavor, and cooked just right. After attempting to get fancy by frying the flavor filled link, the owner stopped me saying it would be best to just get her char grilled. I acquiesced and sat down with anticipation rolling over me.  The rest is history, I inhaled this moment in time, and found out a day later they're closing in October.

I also enjoyed their selection of drinks, as I got a diet black cherry pop that was quite good.  I split 4 dogs with my cousin. To note, these dogs are somewhat small or regular size from what you would get at a small joint/stand. However, the flavor and concoctions of course are what these are known for. I recommend choosing off the specials as they are more unique. We got the atomic bomb, shrimp 'n' grits, foie gras, and the smoked Texas pork link. The atomic bomb had a nice kick to it, but didn't care too much for the cheese stuffed peppers. The shrimp 'n' grits was quite forgettable, as the goat cheese didn't go too well with the sausage, and the shrimp flavor was lacking. The foie gras was pretty good, as it all did melt in my mouth. The Texas dog was quite good and balanced in flavors. There are probably better options to choose from here.  All the sausages itself here were tasty.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon at about 12:30pm and despite the rainy weather, there was a line of about 20+ people waiting outside and probably an additional 15 people on the line inside. As the afternoon went on, the line began to grow much longer to about 50+ people outside. Anyhow, the wait was about 45-60 minutes, but worth every second in the end! The décor inside of the restaurant is everything hot dog you can think of and the menus are located on the right side of the entrance. Once I got to the front, I was greeted by Doug himself, who was the one who took everyone's orders! Rarely do you see the owner being the one who takes down everyone's orders, but he was helming the cash register the entire length of my stay! Not only that, but he was super nice, very professional, seemed to be very easy going and most importantly patient since they have such a large menu. After he took our orders, we were directed to a table. The restaurant wasn't huge so it was full, but every time a new customer placed an order, a table opened up. After a few minutes, our order of cheese fries and hot dogs was brought to us. As I said, it was absolutely worth the wait! My friend ordered ""The Dog"", while I ordered the ""Sonoran Dog"" with cheese fries on the side. Both were amazing! I loved every bite of the ""Sonoran Dog"" as there was an abundance of toppings (jalapenos, jalapeno mayo, jalapeno bacon, pinto beans, tomatoes and onions). The hot dog was also pretty large and cooked perfectly too. The dog was hot and the bun was fully intact despite the amount of toppings on it. Also, there was no shortage of cheese fries either in the ""small order"" as the cheese was smothered all over their delicious fries!

Hot Doug's is exactly everything you'd expect it to be.  There are no pretensions or anything more than as is advertised.  I think my girlfriend thought I was nuts when I told her that we needed to take a cab ride in the morning and check out a hot dog shop where we would likely have to wait in line for awhile.  But thankfully, she trusted me and came along for the ride. We showed up at about 10:15 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, and sure enough, there was already a line about the length of the side of the building.  I think we waited in line for about 45 minutes, maybe a little bit more.  I had flashbacks to the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld, and I hoped everything I read about Doug was accurate. Thankfully, everything that people have said about him is true.  Doug was excellent, and very friendly.  It's hard to believe he wants to give up on this cash cow of a business, especially with how upbeat and happy he seems with every customer that walks through the door.  When I ordered large drinks, he told me that I'd save money by ordering small drinks since I was dining in.  Most employees of any restaurant wouldn't bother saying anything, and I respected that. The two specials I had did not have names, so I'll just copy and paste the descriptions from the website: Bacon and Cheddar Smoked Elk Sausage with Smokey Bacon Sauce and White Cheddar Cheese Curds and One-Third Pound Cheddar and Beer Pork Sausage with Anti-Hero Beer Mustard and Garlic-Cheddar Spread. I think I liked the one with cheddar cheese curds best, but they were both wonderful. Quite surprisingly, there was a decent amount of seating despite how many customers funneled through the building.  We didn't feel pressured to hurry, and enjoyed our encased meats to their fullest.

The Line spread forward for miles, with no hot dogs in sight DAY 25 We could finally view the river separating the office building and Hot Doug's, occasionally cars would pass by. It would be a relief to see the changed landscape, however, we knew that by stepping out into the river, we would no longer be shielded by the branches above... DAY 40 We made it to the river. There were few cars in the way, but the sun wouldn't let up, apparently, we picked the wrong year to visit Hot Doug's. Luckily, I had packed a protective garb which I quickly threw on, protecting my neck and arms from the cancerous rays of the sun.  DAY 60 We cross the river. A man travels past The Line to let us know that our food is still 120 days away. We look at one another, but know we've come too far to turn back. Even as we reach the Garbage Moor, the scent does not repel us, though the sun continues to shine. Relief is in sight, both in the shadows of the Garbage Moor, but also The Gates ahead. DAY 90 We finally reach The Gates, and see ceramic sculptures of the sacrifices Hot Doug's makes to create its food. Some relief from the sun is found, but it is only partial as The Gates do not block the sun completely. DAY 110 We are almost at The Wall, the last stretch before Hot Doug's, but to the left is a temptation: A man drives a vehicle filled with frozen goods. Doesn't he know why we're here? Who would waste valuable stomach space after our months of fasting, to go to some overpriced generic frozen goods? ""Supply and Demand"", one friend says, but demand is not enough.

I saw he offers a veggie dog, but ovo-pescetarianism be damned: if you're going to do something, do it right. (Right?)  I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($10) and The Dog ($2.50). Can't forget the Duck Fat Fries ($4) and a drink. The Foie Gras (which I've never had) had a slightly sweet flavor and was smooth while also slightly gritty. The duck sausage was smoky, and it was an interesting combination of flavors + textures. I'm glad I tried it, but once was enough for me.  I had my Dog (Chicago-Style Hot Dog) grilled, which proved to be an excellent choice. You really can't go wrong with a Chicago style dog, and it didn't disappoint! At the end of our meal (we ate until after closing), Doug indulged my inner groupie and graciously posed for a pic with me. :)  I'm sorry to see Doug go, but love that he's had such a great run!

We ended up waiting from 9:45 to 11:45am on a Saturday. The people who live nearby had come and said that it's been like that everyday though... I'd imagine that it'll only get worse as October nears. So was it worth the 2 hours standing in the hot sun? Ehhh. I don't like the Vienna style Chicago hot dog franks and Hot Doug did not make me a fan. We tried the sausages though, and they were delicious. I wanted to try the foie gras duck sausage out of curiosity, but it completely blew me away - creamy foie gras, flavorful perfectly seasoned duck sausage. I will also say that for once, I didn't hate the hot dog bun bread (which is one of the reasons I don't like hot dogs), but their stuffing:bread ratio (and thus moisture ratio) was perfect. The specials are expensive $8-10 so BRING CASH (but no tax!). Worth a visit because it's closing soon - I don't think there's anything quite like this anymore.

2014-06-13,4.0,"Things I didn't know when a friend and I decided we had an afternoon to try the esteemed Hot Doug's: 1. Anthony Bourdain had listed them as one of his ""13 places to eat before you die"" 2. They're closing permanently on October 3rd after a highly successful run as one of the most famous spots to eat in Chicago (a list might start: ""Alinea, Hot Doug's...""). Thursday at 3pm. Line down the block. Me, always thinking: Don't people have jobs?! Everyone on line was wondering what would happen at 4pm, their listed closing time: would they cap the line then? Cut the line off at the counter? Or maybe they keep taking orders until every dog is sold out? What actually happened was that an employee with a sign heralding the end of the line didn't come out until the line had shortened to within the restaurant's vestibule - about 4:40pm. Chicago is littered with quick and dirty hot dog shacks in a way that makes me sad that all we have in NYC is crappy tourist water dog carts and quickly-diminishing Papaya spots. Hot Doug's looks like many of these shacks: kitschy red/yellow/blue motif, venue calendars posted on a window, ketchup squeeze bottles and napkin dispensers sitting neatly on tables and counters. A classic Chicago dog is just $2.50. There are a few fun hot dog varieties (wish I'd tried the spicy). But check out the specials board, featuring the more unusual items that make them a (self-declared, slightly ironic) ""Encased Meats Emporium and Sausage Superstore."" The foie gras dog was a supremely duck-y duck sausage covered in four generous slices of foie gras mousse and a little fleur de sel. Holy shit. It tasted very similar to Chinese-style roasted duck, actually. They were out of the alligator dog, so we also went with the elk sausage, topped with dressing and cheddar cheese curds that were suspiciously not rubbery like the Montreal kind. The seasonings in the sausage do obscure the elk flavor. All was intensely creamy and delicious, and even the regular fries (not the ones cooked in duck fat, served Friday/Saturday only) were amazing and had a certain resistance about them. We waited 45 minutes. Worth it? Well, since I was on vacation, yes! No, I couldn't taste the bacon and cheddar in the elk sausage or even the truffle aioli on the foie gras dog; the ingredient combinations are more fun flavor-slinging than anything more nuanced. If Hot Doug's were in NYC, you would not see me on that line. But Chicago has fewer great spots with personality like this. Of course, there's now also a bucket-list sort of urgency to coming here.  Here's the other thing that made the wait worth it. Owner Doug Sohn stands at the counter all day, every day, taking orders with immeasurable cheer. I replied, ""I'm good, and how are you?"" and he answered jubilantly, ""Well I'm doing great, thank you for asking!"" Their door had a sign stating that they'd be closed July 4th, in accordance with their tradition of not opening on holidays they could generate the most revenue. Doug, the apparent nucleus of the shop's identity (not the encased meats, even) is shuttering permanently in the midst of a long, intense public obsession about his restaurant, solely because he felt it was the right time - even though as we all know, he could hand off management to someone else, sell it entirely for a tidy sum, or go the franchising route. ...That's equivalent to Dominique Ansel sustaining cronut mania in NYC for 10 years and then closing with not even a stray rat for an explanation. But unlike the tourist-fueled cronut mania, Doug's seems to have its share of true-blue local fans and is a source of hometown pride. They had this thing where getting a Hot Doug's tattoo gets you their hot dogs free for life.

2014-06-09,5.0,"I loved Hot Doug's when it was located in a little storefront in the heart of Roscoe Village. I went there practically every weekend from almost the first day it was open. Then a fire hit the place and Hot Doug's was no more and re-opened further away from my house (California Ave.). Hearing that the place was closing, we tried to go but the line was out the door and down the block (in the mid-afternoon). I will probably never get to go to the location on California but I will always have memories of the old place. What Hot Doug's did for me was create a love of the hot dog and made me appreciate it as a food. To all those that will miss Hot Doug's, I say learn to grill a hot dog -- there is nothing better than a char-dog like I watched Doug make for me. Everyone tries to do eclectic foodie things on the grill. I say ""Less is More"" -- I served classic Chicago hot dogs at my block party and everyone loved them. Get with your parents, children and / or grandparents and have a hot dog. It is a simple, wonderful pleasure. P.S. -- For those true grill masters, my preferred way to grill a hot dog is over the Lodge cast iron hibachi grill. When you make a char-dog, you need to make a cross at each end of the hot dog with a knife (plus a couple slits in the middle of the dog) so that the hot dog flares open in true char-dog fashion.",0.9869,0.793,0.153,0.054,0.5806878306878307
2014-06-08,3.0,"Come here when it's raining or if there's a snowstorm (though highly unlikely since this place is closing its doors in October)... but not when the line is by the dumpsters, that means you'll be waiting for about 2 hours like we did. And the truth is, the line wasn't terribly long... it just moved at a snail's pace. As we waited and waited, we grew hungrier and hungrier. Surely there is more efficient way to take orders than just one man behind the counter? Finally the moment arrived. We orded a corn dog, a fois gras dog, an apple and bacon dog, and the paul kelly. I thought the fois gras was the best.. rich and creamy and you can't go wrong with the truffle aoli. The Paul Kelly bratwurst with all the fixings was my friend's favorite... We both were not big fans of the apple and bacon dog.. too heavy on the blue cheese.

2014-06-07,3.0,"Welp, we finally did it.  We stood in line for over two hours for a hot dog.  I was born and raised here, but my baby girl of a wife is a transplant and she had been bugging me about going to this place for quite some time.   When you are considering waiting outside in a two hour line for anything you should factor into account various possibilities: the weather, your level of hunger and the possibility that you might be standing directly next to someone who talks.............non..................stop............for the entire duration of your ordeal.  Such was the case with us, as we were treated to the entire life's story of a dear young lady who is a lawyer from Chicagoland who now lives in Japan and drove 1800 miles in 10 days and got a haircut and had just been in Ohio after a trip to St. Louis for a wedding and loves ramen more than anything now and realizes that the stuff here is nothing compared to the real thing in Japan and just got a new iPhone and gains sooo much weight when she comes back home, and....and......and..... Anyway, we wimped out and got veggie and chicken dogs with everything and a large cheese fry.  We stopped short of getting one of the specialties (cause we wuhn't finna pay no $9 for no hot dog).  Everything was good, they have refills on their fountain sodas, and Doug, who was manning the order desk, was very friendly.  The place was supposed to close at 4, but it seems as though he decided to stay open a little longer for the sake of the line.  If you really love specialty hot dogs perhaps the hype and wait would be worth your while.  Or, if the historical bug bites and you would like to say you ate there before they close for good (which was the case for us), go for it.  Doug runs an efficient operation and every employee we encountered was super friendly.  Beware of the time element and the fact that his is a cash only establishment.  We heard stories of them being fairly strict on the closing time, leaving some in line with sour grapes.",0.9948,0.848,0.14,0.012,0.5031182359307359

2014-05-31,3.0,"3.5 stars. Alright, so we know this place has hype. It has a line going down the block, which, my friend and I waited in for almost 3 hours. Are we crazy? Crazy serious foodies that is! If you would have told me I'd wait almost an entire afternoon for a hot dog I would have laughed in your face but I did it, and would I do it again? Maybe--but probably not. It's the kind of thing you do once to say you've done it. The actual place itself is small, and being cash only with all these people constantly coming in the door I'm thinking the reason why he's closing shop is because Doug is rolling in some serious dough and doesn't need to work. (When I asked him what his plans were he said ""onto other things, travel, etc.""). The guy is like maybe 40 and retiring. No question the man's made a LOT of money off of fancy hot dogs, but hey-- that's just my speculation. Now, all that said, I so appreciate that he takes the orders and interacts with every customer. That deserves respect and appreciation. the cash only thing? Shady IMO and tax is included in all the prices. I don't like cash-only places because it means essentially they can report what they want when it comes to their earned income. And it's a pain for the customer. Now, onto the food. Duck fat fires ($4): disappointing. Tasty like regular fries just a tad more crispy. I would have rather bought another dog. The hotdogs themselves are pretty expensive-- expect to spend more than $10 on one if you want a fancy one. I got the Foie Gras, because I've never had foi grais and probably wouldn't ever find it at another hot dog place ever. I want to say that rang me over $12 but I'm not too sure. So was it worth it? The dog was not as big as I maybe thought it should've been for the price. However, it was really tasty, and the foi gras, duck sausage was filling and delectable. I was very glad I got it. There was a moment where I thought to myself, ""this is one of the best things I've ever eaten"" and it's true. It was awesome. My friend got a really yummy hot dog with goat cheese, I wish I remember the name. It was also delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. All that said, I don't know if I would spend $15+ on a lunch of a hot dog and fries, and waste a whole afternoon in line, but I am glad to say I've made it here and checked out what the hype is all about.

Like others have said, it is a bit far from any major transportation (we took 2 buses!), but there seems to be some parking around, if you're driving. When we arrived, it was a beautiful day out, and the line stretched around the corner and down the block. ""Not too bad"", I thought, thinking it would only be an hour, 2 hours top,wait. Oh boy was I wrong. My boyfriend and I ended up waiting nearly 4 hours (!!!) to order, on a Saturday morning. At least they had an employee come out to let us know how long we'd be expecting to wait.  We were both starving by the time we made it to the beginning of the line, and so we ended up splitting 4 dogs, and the duck fat fries. We went for the Alligator sausage, the wild boar, the foie gras duck sausage, and a regular Chicago dog. We loved the Alligator and the foie gras hot dogs the most.

Plan it out and don't do what I did, which was only have gummy bears to eat all day before getting in line at 2:00pm. I didn't get to order until 3:30, by which time I was incoherently hungry. That being said, once I finally ordered my food, it came out in less than five minutes, which made me very happy. Everything else about this review is positive. I was just about at my wits' end with the wait by the time I finally stepped up to the counter, at which point my tune completely changed. Doug is just the nicest guy, fully willing to answer any questions and make sure he gets every person's order right. Granted, this was part of the reason the line was so long, but I very much appreciated the personable touch and the genuine kindness I got while served there--much better than the sort of Soup-Nasi-esque ""know what you want to order or get yelled at"" mentality that can be kind of common in big city establishments (although certainly less so here than in New York--zing!). The food was wonderful and the price was extremely reasonable. I got two different hot dogs (the classic Chicago dog and the ""mighty hot"" one), french fries, and a soda for $10.50. I don't think I've ever gotten a better bang for my buck in a restaurant. I decided against getting the expensive specialty hot dogs, but there were plenty of them that seemed really interesting and I'll have to indulge myself in the future. If that was a little tl;dr: Come hungry, but not too hungry, as you'll be waiting a while. Don't be afraid to order more than one hot dog, because you can get a lot for your money and it's really worth it to try a couple different dogs.

This may be why the line is always longer on Fridays and Saturdays, but those fries are what baby potatoes hope to become when they grow up.   The specials are what everyone raves about and features the more exciting and interesting sausages.

Drats, next time. -=-Cheese fries-=- Freaking cheesy. Seriously it's exactly how it sounds, but not until it is in your mouth will you go oooooh aaaaaaah. -=-Foie gras dog-=- The specialty dog that we tried. It's not cheap, but well foie gras ain't cheap. It's no frills other than the pate of foie on top, otherwise the rest of the construction is your run of the mill hot dog. Flavors are interesting, but I cannot exactly say it didn't mesh. Try it yourself before October and you'll know what I mean. -=-The dog-=- Typical, ordinary....and CHEAP. 2 forms here: chargrilled or boiled, no brainer for you too I hope.

Now I knew from reading YELP that this place always has a line and somehow I just kinda 'forgot' to tell the sometimes impatient Hubby.    As we approached it looked like we had lucked out and only a few people were at the door waiting to get in.....but as soon as we turned the corner we saw the line wrapped along the side of the building.     Too Late to turn back now...so we hopped in line and it did go by pretty quickly...about a 30 minute wait on a Friday at about 2:30pm.     You place your order with Doug himself who seemed like a very nice guy in the brief ordering interaction I had with him.     The place is fairly small, but surprisingly it seems like their system works and we didn't have to wait for a seat after we ordered.   I think the special sausage of the day was some kind of Kangaroo concoction.....   I had never tried a 'real' Chicago Dog....so I kept it safe and had 2 ""Chicago Dogs' with all the fixings (mustard, neon green relish, caramelized onions, plump red tomatoes, a pickle and celery salt) and some of the highly touted ""Duck Fat Fries"".     My better?

My friend and I split 4 dogs and some duck fat (yum) fries - it was too much food but it was fun. Everyone else has talked the food to death - it's freaking good - you get it.  Let me talk about Doug. He took our order. There was a young man in front of us, by himself, who had been standing close to us in line the whole time and we could tell he was a little different, maybe having a rough time. Anyways, he got up to the counter where Doug was waiting and told him that he had come into the city for a concert and that he always makes it to Hot Doug's when he comes to Chicago. He started ordering but after each request, he would ask ""now how much will it be"" and pulled some singles and coins out of his pocket. He didn't have enough for the fries and the drink he wanted to go along with the dogs. Doug told him to order whatever he wanted and to not worry about it.

They must have had a think tank of gourmet sausage people locked in a room for a month to figure these all out and they did so with flying colors. I had the apple and cinnamon pork sausage, the atomic bomb and a few bites of the venison dog. The apple cinnamon was fairly sweet/cinnamon tasting but not too much. The atomic bomb was fairly spicy and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has a aversion for spicy foods. The venison dog was good but with the bbq sauce on there just kinda left it tasting a little like some kind of BBQ creation and not as special as the first two.

I took some out of towners here once.  My friends had been trying to convince me to go be an extra in a movie at Revolution Brewing but I decided to stuff my face and my friends' faces with fancy hot dogs instead.  So we wait in line, debate our orders, make decisions, chat with Doug... the usual.   Then, as we're finishing our order, this woman who looks super familiar to me cuts the line and says hi to Doug.  Then she and her friend take a seat at the table next to us.  You're definitely not supposed to take a seat before ordering.  It's one of the very few rules.   I still can't place her as Doug leaves the register for a moment and walks over to the table.  I wonder if he's going to explain the procedure to them.  But then he's like, ""What'll it be?""  And she's like, ""I mean, I'll have the hot dog.""  And her friend is like, ""Me too.""   Wait, what... OH! THAT'S FLIPPING ANNA KENDRICK.   You see, Doug names a few of his sausages after people.  He has a red hot that he names after some super hot lady.  Then he has a super spicy red hot that he names after someone who is really, really hot.  It changes every couple years, I assume based on his current celebrity crushes.  At that point in time, the super hot one was named ANNA KENDRICK. So here we were, my friend to my right eating an Anna Kendrick at a table next to Anna Kendrick eating an Anna Kendrick.  It was so meta amazing. She and her friend agreed to each other that the sausage was super hot but super good. Then she signed the wall menu. Yeah, remember those friends who were extras in a movie?  It was her movie.  Filming at Revolution Brewery, which I also recommend.  And the movie was Drinking Buddies, which I also recommend, mostly because I love Olivia Wilde in it.  Anna Kendrick is good too but she doesn't have as much space in that role to totally rock, like she does in Pitch Perfect and Up in the Air and all of the other wonderful things she's done.

What am I doing at a hot dog place then, you ask? Well Hot Doug's is like no other hot dog place you've ever been to and, most likely, will ever go to. They have allllll sorts of sausages from the familiar to the unfamiliar, and the specials change every week. The basic menu has the safe vegetarian dog that I can eat (and have eaten), but I usually like to treat my palate to more exciting flavors. I've had a chicken sausage, a scallop/salmon/shrimp sausage, and alligator sausage...all of which were surprisingly delicious. Yep, you heard right. I've seen the game of the week change from alligator to rabbit to antelope to rattlesnake and so on. If you're feeling daring, go ahead and try! Each hot dog is topped with unexpected and uncommon sauces, cheeses, and toppings that end up complimenting the sausage perfectly.  The line is almost always out the door, but it's worth the wait and usually doesn't take too long to move along. Once inside, Doug takes your order himself and is always a pleasant man. It's a cash only establishment so make sure to bring enough or you'll just waste your time standing in line for nothing. I've only gone on weekdays so I can't attest for the duck fat fries, but the regular fries and cheese fries are fine with me. Prices range from $2-$10 depending on what you get, but you're really paying for the unique and yummy experience. The only other hot dog place that I can enjoy nearly as much is probably Japadog in NYC. Too bad we have neither in Florida.",0.9947,0.778,0.188,0.034,0.600616889570378

Mr. Doug himself was taking the orders, so I thought that was pretty neat.  We ordered the following to share: Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Golden Cheshire Cheese (the special of the day; I really loved this one as it was so delicious - the sausage was snappy, flavorful, juicy, and the topping of the cajun remoulade and the cheese made this a great overall gourmet dog), a Paul Kelly (bratwurst soaked in beer; this was okay, but I thought there was way too much sauerkrat!), a Keira Knightley (which is now called the Malin Akerman that is a fire dog; also a nice dog and I enjoyed the caramelized onions and the nice dill pickle on top in a poppy-seed bun), and a Atomic Bomb (another special of that day, but was just way too spicy for me!).  We also ordered a side of their famous duck fat fries (that are only available on Fridays and Saturdays), which were cut-fries, but they were just okay.  We did get a side of chili and cheese to dip the fries in.  The place was jam-packed, and the experience was cool.  I'd love to try more of their exotic sausages as well as their other items on the menu.  I'm glad I tried this place out! +Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Golden Cheshire Cheese",0.9935,0.778,0.198,0.024,0.6725840336134453

We need to go now.      Incase you haven't read any of the other reviews, Hot Doug's isn't exactly convenience food. There is always a line. You better check the website to make sure they are open before you make the trip on a frigid February day. I whined twice on the way. Thank goodness it was open. Then I saw the line. I whined again.      Listen to this because this is important: my fiancé wants to order a Chicago style hot dog and The Elvis, which is basically a Polish sausage. I can't believe we had to come all the way here and wait in this line for a regular hot dog. I convince him that we also have to get the Boudin Blanc. Later that night when we were still eating our take-out Hot Doug's feast, he explained he thought that the regular hot dog would be superb. He said this is not the case. So you should probably order something a little different if you stand in the line. Doesn't have to be foie gras.      I highly recommend the Boudin Blanc. If you don't know what that is you can google it. It is the least gross sounding of many sausages. Hot Doug's serves theirs with double cream brie, fig mustard, and pate de campagne. It's one of the best things I've ever eaten.      We also got some duck fat fries and those are totally not worth the calories IMO. The first bite you taste it's like, ""what's the big deal?""

WHY WAIT: People trek out to this little hot dog joint and wait in line for good reason.  It is local, unique and kind of an adventure, to eat a hot dog with duck liver or pineapple salsa or sriracha mayonnaise.  When I came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was snowing outside... the kind of SNOW that even people in Chicago would avoid driving in... and the snowfall was heavy and sticky.  It made people standing outside, wrapped westward along a side of brick wall, look like accumulating snow(o)men. Yes, the WAIT is long (i.e. standing in snowfall for 30 minutes) and they are cash only.  If I were to twist it positively I could say that you kind of get chummy with the people you rub elbows with... or you get to overhear a string of different conversations.  The anticipation builds to an almost unbearable angst as you shuffle forward. But (as a first-timer here) it's worth trying and waiting.  For me, I've made two previous attempts to eat here... both were foiled because I didn't know they were closed on certain days.  As their website indicates, call ahead to make sure they're open because sometimes they take random vacations. The friendly group of 8 in front of us (here for the Chicago Auto Show) had a bill of $100+.  Whoa, I know.  But  it's implied that if you come here... you come for the experience, eat to your hearts content and you're ready to pay $10.00 for a hotdog.  You go all out.  Our bill between two was around $40.  You're ready to support a local business owner and gain bragging rights to having tried foie gras on a hot dog. TWO FAVORITES: First place is the Foie Gras Hot dog (#1 from above, an easy win) and in second is the Boudin Blanc (#3).  The melty, creaminess of the foie gras and the brie went best with each bite of the hot dog.  For the Boudin Blanc, the fig mustard adds a sweet-spicy kick to the milky, double-cream brie. For the others, the chicken sausage (on the Spicy Thai dog from #2) was a little dry compared to the other dogs, but I liked the sweetness of the baked ham sausage, with cubes of habanero jack-cheese.  Overall, glad I made the trek out to this place to try a bit of Chicago's hot dog fame.  After two attempts to eat here, the third time is the charm and it's even worth it in the snow... though it won't make the line any shorter.",0.9942,0.886,0.11,0.005,0.533713649815345

I was so shocked by how flavor the Thuringer was. Best I've had, by far. The Texas was the absolute perfect combination of flavors. I never thought I would be this impressed by a hotdog/sausage. The combination of creamy and spicy was incredible. I also tried a bite of the ""Vietnamese Chicken Sausage with Sweet Chili Aioli, Cheese-Stuffed Hot Peppers and Fried Rice Noodles "" from the specials and the Santa Fe Style Chicken Sausage.

When we went, it was snowing, so there was virtually no line, though I've heard it gets pretty intense with the line wrapping down the block and stuff like that.

Visiting Hot Doug's is a Chicago rite of passage. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere, unless you go to the Target on Addison, and parking is hit or miss in its residential neighborhood, but buck up and do it once. If for any other reason than to not be the one loser at happy hour who cannot chime in with their own tale of standing in line for 45 minutes and getting hit with the interior door in said line at least twice.  Hot Doug's has their standard menu on the wall, followed by their specials. I don't know why, but I couldn't find the specials and almost ordered a Chicago dog, which I hate. Go 'head, let the hate rain. Chicago dogs are gross.  Anyway, skip the standard menu in general. You stalked a parking spot for at least 15 minutes, then you waited in line for double that, so why would you get a hot dog you can have anywhere else? Get the elk/chorizo/iberico cheese/pickled salami whatever to have a real Hot Doug's experience. Also, don't get just one dog. Try at least two. The menu is forever changing so I won't recommend anything, but I had a spanish dog and it was pretty good. The mister had the fois gras dog and was more impressed to be able to say he ate it, than with the flavor.

I've come in while having an awful day only have to have Doug turn it around completely just by being the nice, friendly person that he is. He's even nice to customers who are rude to him--I've seen him deal with people griping about the line/cash only policy/whatever and totally kill them with kindness! It's not just Doug, either; his positive outlook trickles down to every employee, who are always working their best to make sure you have the best experience possible.  As someone who's been working in the service industry (bars/restaurants) for years, Doug is a huge source of inspiration for me on how easy and remarkable it can be to brighten someone's day through a simple 5-minute interaction.

The standard sausages are pretty good and they are your tried and true brats and thurings and corndogs. Then, there are the specialty dogs of the day! These are your more adventurous and gourmet meats and blends. Here you could find an Irish banger or alligator meat and even more creative sausages like Carnitas, which is topped with tortilla chips. Amazing! I usually recommend getting one of the standard sausages and one of the daily specials. If you're there on the weekends you can grab a basket of duck fat fries to go along with it.

Ultimately, I think the plane hotdog was the best in terms of its texture and mix of flavors - a hotdog with a pickle and tomato, green relish, and ketchup?  Colorful, crunchy, and flavorful! The foie-gras one that everyone gushes about felt very .. colorless and mushy. Maybe it's also b/c I'm not a super big fan of foie-gras.  Also, the aioli (?) and such, it just felt super rich. and overly soft.  Also tried the al pastor one, and .. I'd prefer a regular al pastor taco. Barbeque-y flavors, fun cheeses, but pretty strong.  Didn't finish it.  (C and I split the 2 half and half). The duck fat fries are a bit overrated in that they smell heavenly and are delicious when you begin, but after a while, when it's cold, it just.. tastes like cold fries.

2013-12-31,4.0,"Like Frankie said Doug did it his way. Purportedly the best hot dog joint in the city, I don't disagree. But it takes significant effort to procure said dog. Hot Doug's is located up ""north"" in Avondale, making public transportation access quite difficult. Driving is definitely the way to go, and there's ample (free!) street parking to boot. Hot Doug's is also open from only 10:30 am to 4 pm, and only Mondays through Saturdays, making it difficult to bring weekend visitors. Finally, lines during peak times (Friday and Saturday lunch rush) are notoriously long, further deterring said out of town visitation rights. But if you can handle all that, Hot Doug's is a heck of a time. The line that stretches out the door only makes one yearn more for a delicious dog. By the time you make it inside, the kitschy decor and gargantuan board of a menu will send your mouth watering. If you're into complete overindulgence, the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage and fresh-cut potatoes fried in duck fat (served Friday and Saturday only) should be enough to have you running for the hills towards Hot Doug's. Both dishes are truly as artery-clogging as they come. I personally don't think the duck fat fries measure up to the (recently-closed) Burger Guys in Houston, but they're very good. The duck sausage is so wholly rich, the large slices of foie gras and heaping of truffle aioli are just mind-boggling cherries on top. Switching back to the regular stuff, and a regular Chicago dog runs only $2.75. Hot Doug's adds flair by making the sucker fairly customizable (get it deep fried! add giardiniera!). Vegetarian and chicken versions also exist, as well as a run-down of some neatly named always-on-the-menu dogs. The real fun comes from the specialty dogs, which can run up to $8-$10 per dog.

And I must say the atmosphere is cool and vintage like, however, your hot dogs did not wow me. They were good, but not over the hill amazing. I came here with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm in order to beat the lunch crowd and our wait was less than ten minutes, so in that respect, we succeeded. Because, I would never come back and want to wait over an hour for your hot dog. Remember, it's just a hot dog we are waiting for. Anyways, the guy who takes your orders, I'm assuming is Doug is very chatty and nice so they get a star for having great customer service. The place is cash only and you have to pay right up front, which is no big deal, but you don't have to pay for taxes so that's a plus. Now, we waited about 10 more minutes to get our hot dogs and fries and were able to snatch a table since they do have a few of those, but with how many people they have it may be hard during a Saturday lunch rush. I got the Chicago Style dog with all the trimmings for $2.50 and it was yummy. It's simple and yet classic. However, it was not the best one I've had. The best Chicago style dog in my opinion is actually at Poochies in Skokie. Nonetheless, I gobbled the whole thing right up. I also ordered the Paul Kelly which is a brat soaked in beer with sour kraut and caramelized onions for $4.00. I didn't like this one at all, it was almost drenched in the beer to the point that my bun was soggy right when it was served and the sour kraut which I typically like, was overly sour taking away from the beer flavor of the brat. I took a few bites and left the rest since my friend was full from her Chicago Dog and the corn dog she got. We also got a large fries for $3.00 to share and you get a large portion of hand cut fries that were okay. I would have liked them on the crispier side but I did do the whole belgium mayo plus ketchup thing and that took them to a whole other level. So overall, the place is neat, has hot dogs everywhere, is kept very neat, very diner like and super busy, so if you do come, come on a weekday around 2pm and your wait will definitely be shorter. But am I dying to go back? Absolutely not. Although I do love my comfort food, it just didn't steal my heart.

We showed up, pondered over our order the entire 20 or so minutes we were in line, ended on 4 dogs and an order of duck fat fries, put in our order with Doug himself (Cash only!), found a table in the corner, and anxiously awaited the arrival of our encased meats. As I said, we ordered 4 hot dogs along with an order of duck fat fries. I would've ordered more because it was so hard to choose (um hello curry-coconut mustard!), but out of fear of looking like a total glutton I restrained myself. Next time though, next time. We ordered The Sonoran Dog, the Saucisson Alsacienne, the Foie Gras dog, and the Mozzarella and Bell Pepper Chicken Sausage. Mike was really lobbying for the Game of the Week, the Rattlesnake dog, and although it did sound like it could be good I just couldn't get on board. Again, next time. All the hot dogs we ordered were so different but great in their own ways. The Sonoran spicy, the Foie Gras rich and truffle-y, and the others just totally unique and delicious. I will say that the Foie Gras dog doesn't look all that enticing...but trust me, looks are deceiving when it comes to this ducky dog. Oh..and the fries...can I just say that more people need to do duck fat fries! Salty fried potato goodness...yum.

I applaud the foie gras dog for trying to elevate the sausage game and don't get me wrong I love pate and foie gras too but I was seriously underwhelmed by this creation. My foie gras on top, a seemingly very generous amount, was totally off taste and seasoning wise. It just didn't taste right. I couldn't even finish it and furthermore felt like absolute shit after eating it. I never thought I would throw away anything with foie gras on it but I did. I will say that they have great fries and the service was very friendly. I don't however think it is worth waiting in a crazy long line for.",0.9768,0.72,0.198,0.082,0.5962454212454213

There are two menus of sausages here.  One appears to be a regular menu that doesn't change, with a variety of Polish and Italian sausages, hot dogs, etc.  Those are $3/each, and the specials of the day/week/month/whatever, which vary in price from $8-10/each. I had the Juniper and Garlic Sausage.  I loved the gin & tonic mustard on it, it really had a zingy, fresh gin flavor.  My sausage was topped with Gouda cheese.  Worth the wait?  You betcha. My husband had the Cheeseburger Sausage, topped with crumbled bacon and cheese curds, and the ""Elvis,"" a Polish sausage with sauerkraut and the toppings of his choice. We shared an order of the duck fries and a large order of cheese fries.  The duck fries were much crispier than the house fries, but I don't think they live up to the hype.  The large cheese fries were a huge portion, I should've had a small. I was alarmed by the seating situation.  The number of people in line far exceeded the number of available seats.  But somehow, their ""rule"" works - do NOT take a seat until you have placed your order.  In other words, don't be selfish and have a friend reserve a table for you while you wait 30+ minutes to even place your order.  Following the rules works out beautifully here.  We found a seat easily, and it looked like no one else had a problem either. Doug himself was working at the counter and took our order.  You have to have respect for a business owner that not only comes into the establishment, but does some of the work, after achieving so much success. Hot Doug's is worth making a destination spot.  If you don't want to wait, I'd suggest getting there before they open.  That should do the trick or at least cut down your time in line.",0.9896,0.817,0.137,0.046,0.5195476908712203

2013-09-20,5.0,"May 2013 I heard about this place a long time ago when they made news during Chicago's temporary foie gras ban for serving it despite the ban.  I decided while visiting that I had to try the infamous sausage.   If you don't have a car it's kind of a pain to get to using public transportation.  I think it was a 20 minute walk from the subway station.  Probably a good thing to get some extra walking in before feasting on sausage. When we arrived there was a line out the door which we expected.  It only took about 15 minutes from waiting in line to being seated and served.  The whole process was efficient and Doug was at the counter taking orders.  They won't let you sit until you order and the timing really does work out perfectly.   The sausages were on the small side.  We split 3 between 2 of us and it was a good thing we weren't hungry.  However, each packed a lot of flavor.   It was hard to choose since all the sausages sounded enticing, but here's what we ended up ordering: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (what I came here for) - It's definitely unique.  The foie gras adds a nice fatty creaminess that compliments the sausage.  The aioli added more richness and had a hint of truffle flavor.   Cognac-infused Pheasant Sausage - I could have done without the duck confit topping, which tasted more like duck pastrami, but it still tasted good.  The weakest of the 3 sausages.   Game of the Week - I wish I could remember exactly what we ordered, but all I remember is it was my favorite of the 3 and so delicious.  I believe it was a elk with goat cheese and an apricot mustard.   Loved the menu and concept.  Extra star for the creativity.",0.9919,0.799,0.162,0.039,0.5830128205128206

I had to get the foie gras dog.  First of all, they are not skimpy at all on the foie gras!  I actually had to take some of it off and just eat it separately cause there was so much (oh darn, too much foie gras).  I was wondering at first why my dog was so much smaller than my husband's but quickly realized it's cause that foie gras dog is rich...very filling.  The mousse that is on there is unreal.  The dog itself was tasty on its own as well.  My husband got the Anna Kendrick and it says hot but it was not hot at all.  That being said, it was sooooooo tasty.  They had the special habenero one and I totally want to get that next time so hopefully it will be hot!  I agree with many people who said the duck fat fries are overrated.  That really isn't anything against Hot Dougs...I really have felt that way everywhere I've had duck fat fries/chips.  I just don't get much of that fatty goodness.  We already have a date to go with some friends and I think I'll get the cheese fries next time.  Overall I think it lives up to the hype and depending on what else I get, I may need to do a 5 star bump.",0.9832,0.9,0.095,0.005,0.39111631832220056

I went on an early Saturday afternoon and waited in line for about 40- 45 minutes... definitely enough time to muster up an appetite. But don't fret, it was worth salivating in line for!  The service: The service here was on point! I believe I placed my order with the owner Doug and he was just a pleasure to speak with. Although the line behind me was terrifyingly long and I had to place three other orders Doug was super chill, patient, and very suggestive considering it was our first time there (don't mix pinto beans and sauerkraut lol). The place was busy and from my perspective the line looked overwhelming as it grew longer, but Doug kept his cool and was very attentive towards me and my order and was not distracted by that. Upon placing my order amongst 3 others, finding a table for four was not at all a challenge. People come and go which makes it quite convenient after the 45 minute wait. Our food took maybe 8-10 minutes (give or take) which is not long at all! Once I went to the ladies room, grabbed drinks, & additional condiments and made my way back to the table our tray of food was already being brought to us. The food:  I ordered ""The Dog,"" a classic style Chicago dog with everything that comes with it (pickles, tomatoes, relish, celery salt, onions) as a first time Chi-town hot dogger. In addition, I also asked for their duck fat fries (weekend availability only). The hotdog was like.. two bucks and the duck fat fries were $3.50.  The cheap prices at Doug's do not reflect mediocrity! My hotdog was nicely chargrilled and everything was freshly made to order. The relish was bomb! The fries were crispy duck fat goodness. The fries complement well with the packaged dijon mustard they have by Grey Poupon made with white wine. I... crushed it.  Overall: Ok, moment of truth. I've never been a believer of hotdogs... I mean, what's so special about them right? But after Doug's... I'm converted! A hotdog can actually be really good and super bomb with just the right cooking style & sausage... not to mention fresh condiments to top it. ""The Dog"" was just right, not too heavy and non fussy. I was full with just one with fries but I could've probably ate two even if you didn't double dog dare me.",0.9868,0.844,0.119,0.036,0.48113662131519275
2013-09-09,5.0,"2nd stop on my culinary tour of Chicago.  Went there after eating a Smoque.  Wow!!! even with light rain there was a line outside.  Fortunately we had umbrellas so we lined up.  The wait was about 40 minutes, but ultimately well worth it.  Had seen Hot Doug's on the travel channel on Hot Dog Paradise, and I believe No Reservations with Bourdain.  When we finally got inside it was just like it was portrayed on Hot Dog Paradise some 6 or 7 years back.  Doug Sohn the owner was behind the counter taking the orders (aging real well despite being in the restaurant business).  Once inside we still had a 15 minute wait so I spent my time observing, and listening.  Doug is a master.  He paces his order taking by chatting with the customers.  Pacing the orders ensures that a stool or table is available when your turn comes.  It was amazing to watch as it really works well.   Have been to too many places where customers are allowed to save tables while someone stays in line.  The busboy at Hot Doug's, and clearly written signage on the door prevents this from happening.  When our turn came, having just eaten at Smoque, we only ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, and   the Escargot and Guanciale Sausage with Parsely-Garlic Goat butter and Double creme brie.  Also ordered the Chicago-Style Hot Dog to go, for the wife who was in seminars at her medical conference.  We were there on a Thursday, so we skipped the fries, since they were not being cooked in duck fat.  BYOB is allowed at Hot Doug's so we enjoyed a couple of Blue Moons with our exotic dogs, which were both delicious.  Doug Sohn is so friendly, that when we asked if BYOB was ok, he replied by asking us if we needed glasses, and an opener.  The wife later said that the Chicago-Style hot dog was delicious even though she ate it cold.  Will definetely stop at Hot Doug's whenever I am in Chicago.  Gotta try all their exotic game dogs on different visits.  Next time I wil make Hot Doug's my primary stop for a full lunch.   Working for a major airline I may just have to fly in on my day off for lunch, and return to NYC the same day.  Hot Doug's is that good.",0.9965,0.821,0.157,0.022,0.5701666666666667

Sadly, some had to be left behind due to stomach-busting concerns (I'm looking at you, Green Curry Pork Sausage with Spicy Peanut Sauce, Toasted Coconut and Fried Rice Sticks and Red Mole Turkey Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Queso Asadero and Fried Tortillas).  But the A-plus-plus of the afternoon was the Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Smoked Bison Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise, Prästost Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions.  Maybe one of the best two or three sausages I've ever had at Doug's.  So good it makes me cry to think about it. Lunch was great but the main reason for my update is Hot Doug's:  The Book.  I attended The Interview Show at the Hideout back on August 2, at which Doug was a guest (I would argue the star guest--he killed).  After the show I bought a copy of the book which Doug cheerfully signed.  I took it home and devoured it like Doug's awesome sausages.   The book is full of Doug's lovably snarky but also gracious personality, as well as the history of his two restaurants, descriptions of some of his operational and creative methods, a small sampling of the countless professional praises that he's received over the years, and--best of all--oodles of testimonials from actual customers--real people like you and me--each relating how Hot Doug's has been important to him or her.  Family stories, romantic stories, friendship stories, travel stories, business stories....  It's awesome to see so many different perspectives all coming to the same conclusion--that Doug is a great guy who sells fantastic food in a really fun place, but he has built something that transcends the mere idea of a restaurant.

Every-time I did, it was worth it. Do not go there expecting to casually walk in, sit down, and order. I have only been on Fridays and Saturdays, so each time I got duck fat fries. Always order cheese sauce also. Fries are crispy and delicious. However, I can't compare them to their regular fries, so I won't comment on whether the duck-fat makes a difference. Their hot dogs are amazing. The creativity that goes into making each one truly amazes me. My personal favorite is the foie gras hot dog and I order that (x2) every time. I can't remember any of the other that I've had since I try to get something new on each visit. I can say that some hot dogs have a tendency to be a little cheese heavy, so watch out for that.

Consistently 45-60 minutes for a wait, but since the place is pretty small it works out pretty well, by the time you get in, there are tables to sit - if the line went any faster, there would be a second line waiting for tables. As advertised, tons of different types of sausages. We ended up with the kangaroo, shimp and grits, and the truffle infused pork sausage. The kangaroo sausage was a little tough, and overwhelmed by the sauce. Similarly, the goat cheese was the main flavor in the shrimp and grits - though the sausage was great when eaten separately. We did get the duck fat fries, and though I have heard amazing things - they seemed pretty normal. Maybe a bit richer, but in general, just well made fries that would taste good in any fry oil. There is a ""normal"" hot dog/sausage menu with more mainstream items (brats, polish, corn dog), that is more reasonably priced, but that's not why you come here - it's to get the specialty meats. Hot Doug's is a very unique place, with good eats. It didn't blow me away, but everything was very well made, had good flavor and seemed to be freshly made.

So that's just what I did.  I ordered the duck and foie gras sausage.  And it was glorious.  The dog actually came with decent sized slices of what I am assuming was foie gras torchon on top, not to mention the delightful aioli which was seasoned with truffles by a very deft hand.  It was good, mkay? The duck fat fries on the other hand?  Sadly, I was disappointed.  They seemed way over-done to me; all crispy crunchy, no soft and fluffy interior. We didn't have the regular fries, and perhaps ours came from an overdone batch; I can't speak to the doneness of the fries on average. I think it was worth it.  Not everyone would agree with me, but you know, that's just how it goes.",0.8,0.832,0.111,0.057,0.5300801282051282

Oh, and while I'm on that note, the Chicago dog is not a ""classic Chicago dog that out-of-towners must try"" as every other review seems to say - the sausage itself is TINY and overwhelmed by the giant hot dog bun. IMO, the hot dogs I get at ballgames are far superior.",0.9764,0.827,0.173,0.0,0.5270350020350021
2013-08-02,5.0,"Our first stop while heading into Chicago was to try a Chicago Dog from Hot Doug's. Of course we couldn't just try a Chicago Dog, we also had to try a few of their gourmet dogs that they had on special for the day.  Aside from the Chicago Dog's we each ordered, we shared a Hot Sauce Chicken Sausage with ""Buffalo"" Mustard and Smoked Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey, Smoked Texas Pork Hot Link with Ancho Pepper Mayonnaise, Garlic-Cheddar Spread and Crispy Fried Onions and a Curry Pork and Veal Sausage with Spinach Raita, Slow Roasted Tomatoes and Haloumi Cheese. All of which were extremely delicious and well worth the price.  If you find yourself in Chicago for any period of time. Hot Doug's is definitely a must try spot.

2013-08-01,4.0,"Could it really be? Have I really just found an amazing place to eat a hot dog without consuming meat? It is true, indeed. I'm not sure what my review will add to the many, but what the heck? I can't believe I had never even heard of this place until I saw the many, many reviews on Yelp a few months ago (I was raised in the Chicago area). When my out of town boyfriend came to visit, I figured that now would be a good time to explore Chicago hot dogs for the first time together.  The line wasn't atrocious for a Monday afternoon; we waited for about twenty minutes. Despite the fact that there were SO many people there, this place runs like a well-oiled machine. Even though I kept thinking, ""There's no way we're going to get seats!"" we did. When we ordered, the guy running the register was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We did not feel rushed at all even though the place was really packed. There is a menu on the wall, which we consulted with. I got the vegetarian dog and my boyfriend got the Anna Kendrick (the hot, spicy dog) and the Chicago dog. We also split a large order of fresh cut french fries and birch beer. Our total was only ~$11 for all of that food! Incredible. You're allowed to have a bunch of different toppings added without any extra charge, so we went for everything on it.  We sat down and before we knew it, our food had arrived. We discovered pretty quickly that a large order of fries is, well, LARGE. The two of us could barely finish the fries after enjoying our hot dogs. The fries were crispy and not greasy at all, so I didn't feel too guilty eating them. My vegetarian dog was really good and, to me, tasted just like the real hot dogs I used to eat when I was younger. Ah, nostalgia! Thanks to Hot Doug's, I was finally able to revisit a food that has been totally absent in my life since I I gave up meat.  Bottom line: +Awesome, friendly service. +Incredible bang for your buck. +Kitschy cult favorite decor -Long wait -Food is not mindblowingly good to justify said wait Would I come back? If I had a friend visiting Chicago who wanted to try a few quintessential Chicago hot dogs, then I would have no qualms about returning with them.  Tip: Duck fat fries are only available Fridays and Saturdays, so don't come on a weekday if you have to have those.

2013-08-01,4.0,"I had to visit this place during my vacation after seeing it on The Food Network and having a friend suggest it to me. Since my fiance and I had to sit through a bit of traffic to get there and wait in a long line, we were overzealous and ordered way too much food. I was leaving Chicago soon so my fiance wanted to make sure I got to try all the different flavors I wanted that day. We decided to order more than we needed to share so we could both taste multiple hot dogs. We ate the leftovers for dinner anyway so no food was wasted. Our order comprised of: Baked ham sausage (topped with cherry fig mustard, pineapple salsa and pepper jack cheese)--the toppings on this hot dog was very tasty. It had a very tropical taste because of the pineapple salsa. I'm not a fan of ham but when I saw pineapple salsa and pepper jack cheese I decided to give this a try and it ended up being one of my faves. Foie gras and sauternes duck sausage (my friend highly recommended this and so do a lot of other yelpers so we had to try it). It's topped with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse. To my surprise, I really enjoyed the foie gras. I was scared to try it since I'm not a fan of liver but this was good. My fiance enjoyed this hot dog too but he wasn't a fan of the duck sausage. Ken ober (blue cheese pork sausage with sir william pear cream and almonds): this one was very light tasting and the pear cream wasn't overly sweet. I did like that it wasn't overpowered by blue cheese either. Game of the week: Wild Board Sausage (roasted garlic and provolone cheese)...this one didn't really leave a lasting impression on me Cheese fries: they weren't that good. We found the fries to be just blah and too soggy for our liking. We would have preferred more crispy fries Overall, we enjoyed the hot dogs we tried but though it was a bit too pricey (roughly $10/dog).

I wasnt head over heels in love with it but it was DEFINITELY worth the try. If you love that strong ducky after taste, then youll love the foie gras dog.

I was disappointed that they didnt have the elk, bison, antelope, etc burger when I came OR the duck fat fries which I was dying to try since its only served on weekends.  On the plus side, the hot dogs are fairly cheap here. The classic chicago hot dog or polish sausuage is only $2-3 and corn dogs are $1.50. The hot dogs arent ginormous so you probably want to order more than one hot dog if you are a big eater. I also tried the Smoked Texas Pork Hot Link which I enjoyed a lot.

First off - I don't particularly crave hot dogs, at least not in the most basic form (i.e: on a plain bun with mustard and possibly some relish or onions). Now, after eating at Doug's, I can't seem to satisfy my craving for hot dog's (Chicago style at least). The Chicago style dog elevates the boring old hot dog to a new level. The combination of textures and flavors: sweet, sour, spicy, salty... it simply can't be beat, and no place executes the Chicago dog better than Doug's. The all-beef dog has a great snap to it, and all of the toppings taste fresh and add their own unique flavor to help make the dog what it is. We also tried a vegetarian version of the Chicago dog, and you wouldn't have even been able to guess it was vegetarian if I hadn't told you. No tofurky here, Doug's veggie dog is great - so don't feel like you have to eat meat to enjoy Doug's - although it certainly helps (see foie gras dog with duck sausage and truffle aioli, redonk).

I went with the sig o at the time to Hot Doug's because he had never had a Chicago-style hot dog (he's not from around here). We made sure to follow the tips above to have a pleasurable experience. We tried going on July 6th, a Saturday, for duck fat fries, but the line was 2 hours. We successfully went last Tuesday at 1:47 pm and waited in line for only 20 minutes. There was also ample seating available, indoors and outside. We ordered two regular menu items and two specialty sausages.  Regular menu: - The Dog: The Chicago-style hot dog is only $2 with tax.  - The Elvis, which is the Polish sausage version, is only $3 with tax. When we got up the counter we asked Doug - the man himself - whether it was better to get the hot dogs grilled or boiled for authenticity. He recommended grilled, and of course, being the sausage-master himself, he was spot on. Both dogs were delicious but I have to give a standing ovation for the Elvis. GET THE ELVIS. It is so flavorful with all of the Chicago trimmings! I LIKED THE ELVIS MORE THAN THE SPECIALTY DOGS. For specialty dogs we ordered: - Bacon and Jalapeño Duck Sausage with Blood Orange Mustard, White Cheddar Cheese Curds and Spicy Olives. I enjoyed this sausage. It has a nice kick to it, and the spicy olives were tasty. However, I did not taste the blood orange mustard, and the white cheddar cheese provided more texture than taste. - Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Tartar Sauce and Jarlsberg Cheese. I was expecting more shrimp taste with this sausage. I did not like the taste of alligator so much, but then again, it might have been because I got psyched out at the idea that I was eating alligator.  Of the two sausages, I preferred the duck sausage over the alligator sausage. However, of all four that we ordered, The Elvis wins!",0.9914,0.896,0.098,0.006,0.5300474833808166

2013-07-10,5.0,"I'm always skeptical of places that have been featured on tv with so many rave reviews, especially if it requires me to wait in a long line just to get what can be considered ""fast food.""  However after a visit, I can proudly say that I'm a Hot Doug's fanboy. Food: 5/5- The foie gras duck sausage lived up to the hype.  The truffle aioli and foie gras mousse worked perfectly with the creamy foie gras torchon and the hot duck sausage.  I am salivating just thinking about it right now...  We also tried another more conventional chicken sausage with cheese and bacon and that was also good, though obviously not as awesome as the foie dog.  To round out the meal, we also ordered cheesy fries, which were just so-so.  I wish they served duck fat fries during all days of the week! Service: 4/5- Doug is a really nice guy.  He's genuinely friendly with all his customers and helped us out with our order.  When I finally got to ordering and eating, I realized the staff served out the food very quickly.  The bottleneck in the long wait was the small space with limited seating for the mass of people in line for their Hot Doug's dogs. Environment: 4/5- The restaurant's decor matches the food perfectly.  Humble, quirky, homey, and exactly of what you'd imagine a hot dog shack to look like.  However, the wait is excruciating.  You can easily wait up to an hour for hot dogs.  That's a bit nutty.  My whole time waiting in the line, I just kept thinking if they just open up a to-go window, they can make so many people more happier... Value: 4/5- Foie Gras torchon on quality duck sausage for $10 is a pretty good deal.  High for a hot dog, but good considering the ingredients used Return?  Yes, when I get to visit the Windy City again.",0.9665,0.876,0.1,0.024,0.6664761904761906
2013-07-09,3.0,"FYI - $30.00 (one way) cab ride from downtown.  So make friends in line and share return trip or go with a group. 1 hour wait - although outside, you get shade from the building, I believe there is free cups of water inside HD and there is a super creepy ice cream truck guy that you can get water from too. Doug is actually taking orders - he and the rest of the staff were pretty cool and down to Earth. Tips-  If you order a special dog, have the dog prepared the way they perfer.  It Is possible to get the dogs cooked 4 different ways. CASH ONLY - there is a bank on Belmont which you will pass, so stop by this bank prior to arriving at HD.  Otherwise it is about 6 blocks/10 minute walk.  ATM in the  drive thru. Ordered: Foie Gras ia somerhing special and makes Hot Dougs worth the visit, time & money. Wild Boar Special -  not bad! Regular Hot Dog w everything - surprisingly the actual hot dog is on the smaller side.  Not bad for the price! The Anna Kendrick Fire Dog! - Not hot at all / bummer. Duck Fat Fries - nothing special.. only way I can say this is I recently experienced DFF at a spot in CA, and WOW they were great.  These on the other hand didn't even compare.  I would save the money/calories or get different kind. 1 hat (super sweet)  All in All - Chicago has a lot of spots but I highly recommend visiting at least once. I mean, this place has some of the most dedicated/loyal customers out there.  I was chatting with a guy in line and he said there are about 60 people with Hot Doug Tattoos... WTF!!!  Then he showed me his tat, about the size of my hand, near his rump... Hat's off because that is Next Level!

I really lucked out on my visit, because the Line was only about 5 minutes long on a sunny Friday afternoon. The gentleman at the register was so pleasant and welcoming. Even as the line was growing, he was efficient but never rushing.  The decor has a 1950/60s feel draped in the  wackiness of a teenage male's mind. I say this in a complimentary manner by the way. The place is fun and visually stimulating.  I don't remember the exact names of each hot dog, but I did have The Dog, a thai curry hotdog, and a chipotle style hot dog. Each one was delicious!  You can also preference as to whether you want steamed or grilled dogs which was nice.

We were in town for a few days and I wanted the best hot dog I could get, so thanks to Yelp and a few ""Best Hot Dogs in Chicago"" lists we decided on Hot Doug's.  We got ""The Dog"" with everything, The Paul Kelly (brat) with sauerkraut and caramelized onions and the Celebrity dog which was a Kale and walnut dog with curried mustard and gouda. We ate them in that order and they were increasingly amazing.  The regular dog was the reason we were trying to find a hot dog restaurant in the first place and although I don't normally opt for mustard or pickles on anything, it was great! The mustard was a little sweeter than normal.  The Paul Kelly was delicious, huge and perfectly grilled. the sauerkraut and caramelized onions were a good combo (and seemed appropriate for a bratwurst) The Celebrity Dog was oh my god amazing. I'll pretty much eat anything with gouda on it, but the curried mustard was great (again, coming from someone who doesn't normally like mustard) and the hot dog had chunks of kale and walnuts in it.  The large fries were handcut and perfectly cooked (didn't get any cheese or duck fat) Best of all it was a fantastic value. I wasn't even calculating price when I ordered for us but with those three dogs, a large order of fries and two san pellegrino cans it was only 18.25 --- I picked a great meal to volunteer to pay for!

My single favorite hot dog (so far) is the kangaroo but the bison and alligator are also strong choices.  The infamous Foie Gras Dog is worth ordering once if it peaks your curiosity but honestly, I just can't handle that much foie in my mouth at one time (they really pile it on).  Something about the texture (that's a me problem though, not a Hot Doug's problem) just doesn't sit well with me even though I'm a pretty adventurous eater. The specialty dogs are all around $7-$9 but the quality of the ingredients and overall product justifies that price.  If you still don't feel like shelling out that kind of money for tubed meat in a bun, just order the Chicago Style Hot Dog at $2.00.  You won't be disappointed.  The fries are pretty standard and I can't really tell much of a difference between those and the duck fat fries, which are offered on a limited basis. If at all possible, avoid going on Saturday afternoons.  The wait is insane for something you'll devour in 2 minutes.  At least at Kuma's it takes you 20-30 minutes to eat your food after you've waited patiently.",0.9264,0.794,0.123,0.083,0.6496715927750408

Hot Doug's definitely hits high marks on all the categories.  As mentioned before, waiting wasn't much of an issue, the farthest I've been waiting was on the sidewalk, and even then, the line was moving so quickly, it really didn't bother me.  I 've gotten the regular hot dog, fried, grilled, in every way it's prepared - and you can get all the fixings you desire.  On the exotic side, this place made me realize that I don't like Foie Gras at all - my first visit was pretty much ruined by this.  It's not that it was bad - the duck sausage was good, foie gras was creamy but too rich for me to stomach.  I've had the buffalo sausage before and was great as well.  Kiddies always get the bagel dogs, and they seem to order them all the time despite the many different hot dogs they can eat - must be a good thing.  Fries are pretty standard, but good - fountain drinks, condiments are on the side.   Always a great experience there, even if the seating area is full, people don't linger too long and the rotation is always good.  Wish I could have tasted the duck fat fries, but oh well, I'll settle for the regular ones...",0.9946,0.778,0.203,0.019,0.5436457776457777

So worth the extra $4. - The duck fat fries are good, but they are better with cheese. - Bring your out-of-town guests here, but only the low-maintenance ones. Waiting in line for things is apparently a foreign concept to some. - Order more than you think you'll be able to eat.

2013-04-11,2.0,"Don't.....don't....don't believe the hype! I've driven by Hot Dougs at least once a day since they've opened.  Rain, snow or shine a herd of people line up daily to get a bite of Hot Dougs.  I've seen people in the dead of winter in cargo shorts and Birkenstocks pacing back and forth, risking hypothermia waiting to get in.  Then they run to their computer to write about it.  I'm review 2311.  What do these people, 90% of which are not from Chicago, see about the food here compared to the hundreds and hundreds of other hot dogs stands in Chicago?  Is Hot Dougs really the hot shit?!?! So today, after years of watching suckers wait in line for some Hot Dougs, I decided to venture in.  Then I ran to my computer and tell Yelpland about it. I'm such a conformist! There was no wait today.  I was the third person in ljne when I walked it.  Yes, the owner was taking orders.  He's the owner, he should be taking the orders and operating the cash register.  I don't know why so many reviews mention this like it's unique. I ordered a regular char hot dog, the Andouille (Bridget Bardot) and cheese fries.  My food which I took to go, was ready in about a minute.  That was my first clue that something was going to be wrong.  As someone who has had couple bouts of food poisoning recently, my biggest fear of eating at very busy restaurants is that the food is going to be undercooked.  Everything I ordered was undercooked, way undercooked.  Both the char dog and andouille had a very slight char mark on them.  The casings were rubbery, not crisp like they should be. The char dog didn't have the ends split like every other hot dog place that chars their dogs.  When the ends are split, they char and expand.  It's the best part of the hot dog.  It wouldn't have mattered here, they have to be cooked enough.  The andouille  was mushy and raw in the middle.  Most hot dog places that service char dogs will prep the dogs and then throw them on the grill for a few minutes before they're served.  Not here.  Mine were ice cold.  Raw pork ain't healthy.  The cheese fries were barely cooked and served with a processed cheese not a whole lot unlike nacho cheese.  After a few bites of my Hot Dougs, the whole meal went in the garbage.   So what do people see in this place?  Well, it's cute.  It looks like a typical Chicago hot dog place.  The owner sure knows how to market his restaurant.  People must enjoy the tv shows he's appeared on.  Now, I haven't tried the specialty sausage that is 2 to 4 times more expensive.  My guess is the kitchen prepares those a little better than what I ordered.  I won't know either.  The Hot Dougs Experience is over and unsuccessful for me.  If I wanted raw food, I'd get sushi.",0.7726,0.867,0.074,0.059,0.5331623931623932

I don't even remember what we got, but I do remember this one: Foie Gras and SAuternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel There was a (tiny) hair in our foie gras, so we were a little grossed out. We were still able to force it out of our memory and try it, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't keep thinking about it LOL. Anyway, it was a tiny bit too heavy for me, but I guess that's what you get with a foie gras (already very rich and heavy) hot dog (very greasy, heavy, meaty, savory). There needs to be something fresh and crunchy or something that will balance out those heavy flavors. I dunno. Not complaining, tho. The wait: Yes, it's a long wait. Yes, I wouldn't recommend it when it's freezing cold outside, but it seems to make the wait a bit shorter during the months where people tend to stay indoors. I think we only waited like 20 minutes at the most? But I guess 20 minutes could feel like an hour when the temperature is in the teens.

2013-04-07,5.0,"I try not to give away 5 stars despite being one of the least picky eaters you'll ever meet. To me a 4 star is a place you go back to often and the 5th star is only reserved for a place that is perfect for the kind of place it is. As an informal and fun hot dog place there is little doubt in my mind that Hot Doug's is as good as it possibly can get. Pros: +Quality: The hot dogs are gourmet. Exotic blends of meats are carefully paired with cheeses, toppings, and sauces. +Variety: On my visit I had the Foie Gras (duck sausage topped with cold foie gras), The Paul Kelly (bratwurst soaked in beer with saurkraut), the corn dog, The Mountain Man (elk, antelope, buffalo, and venison), and the Steve Swisher sante fe (chicken sausage). Everything was good to great. +Service: Doug is a hoot and welcomes each customer as though they are his personal guests. Despite lines that are out the door and down the street he is friendly to everyone and you don't feel rushed. It's as though he understands that you've waited an hour in line so there's no sense in hurrying you through. Cons: -Crowded: This is to be expected with any business that does a great job and long lines are an indicator of doing a lot of things right. Still you can't help but wish that Doug would expand or relocate to a larger building that can service more customers. The seating is very crammed but the food makes it worth it. -Price: I'm only going to say this was a con as a fair warning to those who might be interested in trying the place out. It's a hot dog right? You're probably used to buying a whole pack of Sugardales for basically nothing. Well, check that cultural expectation at the door when you come here. You won't be getting a Sugardale. While these dogs are served on buns that are standard hot dog size, each dog packs a punch that surprises you. The Foie Gras is $10 which is mind blowing when you're ordering it. Within two bites of the buttery rich dog with zesty and creamy sauce you find yourself eager for another and willing to pay $15 if you had to. If you're on a budget, the corn dog is $1.50 so you can always fill up on those or like many you might want to consider splitting items as a group so each person gets a taste of a large variety. Having gone alone I didn't have this luxury but I wanted to try as much as I could. I went with 5 different dogs, duck fat fries, and a small soda (Doug kept me from buying a large, suggesting a small since I was dining in and they offer free refills). My total came out to just over $30. I can say that being a big guy (260lbs) I was pushed to my limits well before the halfway point. For the average person not looking to feel sick from over eating you could probably walk away with a $10 meal and feel very satisfied. I went with 2 specialty dogs which also drove up the price. Overall, it's as good as it gets for the genre and will keep me returning to Chicago in the future.",0.9882,0.859,0.103,0.038,0.5758857709750567

Well the truth is, this lady isn't the biggest fan of hotdogs. Now I'm not saying I hate hotdogs, but they aren't my favorite food.  I'm a self proclaimed foodie. Finding great food and eating are my two biggest hobbies. I mean I visited Chicago because I consider it one of the many food Meccas in the world: known for their deep dish pizza and Chicago dog. It was one of my main missions to visit the great Hot Doug's. We took the arduous trip (okay it wasn't that bad) from our hotel off of the Magnificent Mile to Hot Doug's. It took about an hour (one bus and one train and a five minute walk) and viola, we were there.  I've loved food long enough to know that when you see a line of people wrapped around a restaurant, it means one of two things: it means either the food is worth waiting in line for or people just want to see what all the fuss is about. While waiting in line, we met a native Chicagoan (not sure if that's even a word, but it seems appropriate), she mentioned to my sister and I that she comes here once a week, orders the same hotdog: the Chicago dog, and she's never disappointed. She said her boyfriend is more adventurous and tends to get one of the more outlandish specials (like a wild boar sausage). She said ""whatever you get, you won't be disappointed.""  When we finally got inside hotdogs, it's a simple looking establishment. There is hotdog paraphernalia everywhere and it just adds to the overall charm of Hot Doug's. The menu is on the wall and all the regular menu items are on hotdog shaped frames. The one item that sticks out and must be the Hot Doug's mantra is hilarious and wonderful: There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats' my friend.""  I wasn't sure if Hot Dog's is one of these establishments where the person taking your order will yell at you if you order incorrectly, so I had a bit of anxiety when it was my time to order. When I stepped up to the counter it was none other than Mr. Hot Doug taking my order. By the way he looks exactly like the hotdog man on the Hot Doug's t-shirts. He was warm and friendly and even better, he wasn't going to yell at me for ordering incorrectly. I ordered the Chicago dog, no onions. Then Mr. Hot Doug asked how'd I'd like it prepared. I said, ""Please tell me how I should have the hotdog, and I'll get it the way you suggest."" He suggested grilled.  Prices at Hot Doug's were overly reasonable: Two dollars for my hotdog.  We grabbed a seat and waited for our food. The food came out shortly and it didn't disappoint. The hotdog was perfectly grilled: juicy on the inside a slight grilled crust on the outside. Each bite was perfection. Hot Doug's has changed my outlook on encased meats. It was delicious and I'm regretting not being in Chicago longer, so I could try more items on the menu.

Holy crap i don't even know where to begin with this.

As i waited in line, i was determined to make this worth my while. To be honest, i wasn't even going to order the original chicago dog because i did not wait 2 hours for original. I wanted something special and spectacular, but thank the hot dog gods i decided to just throw in the original for the hell of it. IT WAS FRIGGIN THE MOST AMAZING HOT DOG IN THE WORLD! The pickle and lack of ketchup and mustard, and the soft buns and perfect sausage and that jardiniere ( which i think is their version of relish, but SO much better) and even their tomato was just amazing. I can't even explain it. but i have dreams about that hot dog. I came back to California in the search of a decent Chicago dog but it is nowhere to be found.

The whole thing is an experience in and of itself and honestly everyone should go at least once. I wasn't blown away to the point where I wish there were six stars, but HD's is by far has the best meat in town. It is called the sausage superstore and encased meat emporium after all. I mean, they know sausage, the flavor is outstanding.  I ordered a spicy Thai chicken sausage something or another. It was a spicy chicken and cilantro sausage with spiced seaweed and duck cracklings on top. I know! Yes please. And since I was there on Friday I ordered the duck fat fries (only available on Fri/Sat). Regarding the dog - the combination of flavors from the toppings and the delicious tasting sausage was superior to any dog I have come across in this city. So far. I would skip the duck fat fries, other than having a slightly different smell I would challenge anyone to distinguish them between regular fries. Go for the cheese fries, they looked a lot better.  Two guys in front of me ordered most of the specials to split. Sounds like a stellar (albeit expensive) adventure!  I do think $8.00 for the ""specials"" of the day is a bit high. I hate when a place is cash only. And it's in the middle of nowhere. With all that being said, I would still urge you to go. Take a $20, prepare yourself for the line and take advantage of the less expensive sausages listed on the board. You can top them as you want and most only cost $2-$3.

The Anna Kenderick - was good, but a little on the salty side. Again, not good if you're hung over 3. Duck Fat Fries - NOT WORTH THE HYPE. it tasted like regular fries. should have opted for the cheese fries my thoughts now: I really enjoyed the foie gras because of the texture with the hot dog. I would not however recommend eating the whole thing, it's just too rich, so do what i did and split it with someone!

My fiancee tried a couple of their regular sausages (the foie gras sausage and the Norm something sausage) and was very pleased with both, but said the foie gras was absolutely amazing.  That's pretty consistent with everything else I've read on yelp.  If you're going to Hot Doug's for the first time, you simply must order the foie gras. Now for the vegetarians...we have searched long and hard to find a tofu/soy hot dog that doesn't have that awful overpowering taste of well...soy.  I wish I could say that Hot Doug's has created one, but I can't.  Their veggie dog does still have that strong soy taste.  But the beauty of Hot Doug is that you get to choose the preparation of your sausage, including the veggie dog.  So if you're looking for something different from your every day Morningstar hot dog...get your veggie dog fried and then grilled.  It's delicious - a wonderful crispy dog with a grilled flavor on top.  You can choose your toppings and create any type of dog you want.  I'm a simple girl and went with the standard Chicago style (""when in Rome""...after all) veggie dog.   The service is quick and efficient, the atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect when you think of a Chicago hot dog joint.  And if you happen to get there on a fluke light day, you can be in and out in under 30 minutes. As for the duck fat fries, they do have a nice crisp to them, but to be honest, I couldn't really tell much of a difference between them and regular fries.   Hot Doug's is a great place for veggies when you're with a meat eater who has a hankering for some great sausage.  I wouldn't stand in line just for the veggie dog, but if you stand in line with someone else so they can enjoy the other sausages, you won't be disappointed in the veggie.",0.9978,0.806,0.173,0.021,0.6209134615384616

2013-01-20,5.0,"Finally, I've made it to Hot Doug's!  I heard about this place a couple of years ago and have wanted to try it ever since but never got around to it until now.  In retrospect, I should have chosen a warmer time of year to go, but I guess the hardship I had to endure made the meal that much more delicious.  It wasn't the coldest day in Chicago, but it was cold and I kept wishing I brought my hat with me while I waited in line for an hour.  I got there at 2pm thinking that the line must be tapering off after the lunch rush, but that's not the case with this joint.  The line, in fact, grew longer and longer as the afternoon wore by.  Hungry patrons waited in line, some knowing the full value of this wait.  I, on the other hand, not having had a taste of the greatness of what was to be, thought about coming back another time (especially when the wind blew).  If you find yourself in a similar situation, don't give in to that little voice.  The wait is well worth it! Once inside the first set of doors, I was willing to wait as long as it would take and was grateful I was no longer shivering from the cold.  Now if you find yourself in front of the door, don't be that person that holds the door open to wait because you're letting all the cold air in.  If there's no room yet, keep the door close and wait until more people leave.  Seems logical, but there were a couple of people that didn't get this memo.  This place is much bigger than I imagined on the side.  There were several tables and even 2 countertops seating areas. Once inside the 2nd set of doors, I was able to pour over the menus.  From the regular menu, I considered The Paul Kelly soaked in beer bratwurst and The Norm Crosby made of beef, pork and garlic. Another thing to think about is how you would like the dog prepared - char grilled, deep fried, steamed or fried and grilled.  The chef recommended any of the specials to be char grilled, and I went with that.  I was in the mood for something fancy, so I went with the following: Duck Confit-Infused Duck and Pork Sausage (topped with squares of brie cheese) $7.50 - I had a bite of this first and thought the brie was a little overpowering.  If I liked brie more, maybe I would love this, but I didn't. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage $10 - It was love at first bite, this one.  I think the Truffle Aioli sauce did it for me.  Wow, was this dog impressive!  The flavor and texture were heavenly.  I even converted some of the duck fat fries into truffle fries by dipping it on the dog sauce. Duck Fat Fries $3.50 - Pretty delicious. Good flavoring, but I still dipped it in ketchup. This is the first restaurant I've to been to with over 2000 reviews.  I'm going to be 2250th review just to round things out.  Also, I heard that if you get a tattoo of the logo, you get to eat at Hot Doug's for free for life!  That's like winning the lottery, except you decide if you hold the winning ticket or not.",0.9983,0.824,0.159,0.017,0.5746723646723647

For my hot dogs (yes, two, which I would never do elsewhere), I got one that had the duck sausage with foie gras, and it actually kind of grossed me out after a couple bites, and I think the other one had Wisconsin cheddar and some sort of bacon sauce. Maybe the issue is that there are too many rich flavors, so they seem good in the first two bites, and then start disgusting me because they're too heavy.

The shop was clearly not designed with huge crowds in mind because the flow of people in and out is awkward. The hot dog choices are simply spectacular. On top of their normal 8 or so choices, there are about 8 specials, and a couple of other specials on the chalkboard. We're talking about 20 different types of hot dogs. Their take even on the basic Chicago style dog is delicious. The duck fat fries are good, although I am not sure how different from their original fries they really are. Nothing too special there. The duck confit dog was really good, too, with a knockerwurst sausage under.  They have old fashioned sodas like birch beer and ginger beer, none of that canned HFCS crap! The only thing I would improve on this would be to serve actual beer! And maybe use better buns. Oh, and parking was tough there, too, so either take the bus or be prepared to wait a bit.

The food is excellent not the hot dogs but the sausages.  Doug is a PR machine therefore the wait is too long for me to stomach.  It was better place before when he was on Roscoe and had only local customers.  It started out as a local lunch place to eat and now it's like pawn shop in pawn stars.  I go there about once a year now when I was a weekly regular before all the hype.  I don't get all the people coming form out of town to go to this place cabbing up from the loop etc.  Then they order a hot dog.   I give it 5 stars for food and 1 star for the hype so it's average 3 stars. I am rating the whole place not just the food.  I would love to see he expand or open a second location to make it more accessible for regulars.,0.9636,0.877,0.123,0.0,0.5106006647673315
2012-12-07,4.0,"Ahhhhh!!!! Beautiful, delicious and the oh so elusive foie gras. I have traveled 2,000 miles from California just to have you in my mouth again ;) The Foie Gras hot dog consists of four circular pieces of duck liver on top of duck sausage with some Truffle Aioli for $10. The foie gras was very creamy and matched the saltiness of the duck sausage perfectly. Overall, I would give the Foie Gras dog 4 stars. It's unfair of me, but I expected a higher quality duck liver. I know, I know. Unrealistic expectations. My friend got the Spicy Cajun Heritage Pork Sausage with creole mustard and cheese-stuffed hot peppers for $7.50. He really liked it a lot, but I thought it was just average. The dog was indeed spicy, but I personally didn't taste the cheese inside the peppers. I would give it 2 stars. The Mountain Man Sausage is a MUST TRY if you are feeling experimental. The meat is a combination of elk, antelope, buffalo and venison. It is topped with sweet peppadew dijonnaise and St. Nectaire cheese for a total of $8.50. The taste of the dog is on the gamier side, which is a plus for me since I love gamey meat. I would give this 5 stars. Finally the Chicago dog. Classic. The contrast of flavors, textures and temperatures in this hot dog was incredible. The warm, soft bun was balanced by the cool sour pickle and tomatoes. Furthermore, the salty, hot wiener (heehee) wrapped it all together to make this one fun bun (pun --intended).  Overall, I would recommend trying Foie Gras dog (especially if you're from Cali), the Mountain Man Sausage and the Chicago dog.

2012-12-02,4.0,"I've always wanted to try the famed Hot Doug's and, while on vacation in Chicago, I knew I just had to eat here. Coming from The Loop, getting here was quite the journey at an hour before closing during rush hour on a Thursday. I dragged my girlfriend onto the metro. We headed north to the California stop and waited for the bus to go the rest of the way. The bus was running late and I called to confirm the closing time. A guy informed me of their strict 4pm cutoff-- basically you get their right at 4pm or head home hungry and defeated. We had already come all this way and I was determined but also anxious. The bus finally arrives, but traffic was ridiculous. My girlfriend suggested I get off the bus early and run the remaining 3 or 4 blocks and we agreed whoever got there first would order. So I hightail it over and almost enter the wrong door to some closed establishment next door. But, I made it in time!...and my girlfriend who didn't have to run also made it a few seconds after... Anyways, there was no wait as I went right up to order. I ordered a Chicago-Style dog (got it grilled, not steamed, as suggested) and a Foie Gras Duck Sausage dog with a Coke. Doug, the nice guy that he is, appreciated the valiant effort and let me have the original dog and soda on the house! My shortness of breath made it hard to enjoy the meal, but the Chicago dog was good and I enjoyed all the fixins. Though I wish it was more snappy. The Foie dog was full of great Foie flavor.

2012-11-27,4.0,"So when a restaurant has more than 2,000 reviews on Yelp, the average individual review is just a drop in the bucket and adds little to the discussion.  In other words, the People Have Already Spoken.  It's also safe to say that, when about 1,500 of those reviews are five stars, the sheer weight of acclaim creates a mountain of hype that's difficult to summit.   There is also this personal caveat:  I'm no hot-dog freak.  I like 'em just fine, but I can't really think of any examples of hot dogs that blew my socks off.  And I'll say this:  I'm wary of any place that is known for lines that can be measured in hours rather than minutes.  (Seriously, that is some horseshit.  And I don't care how good the food is; I can almost always find an alternative 85 or 90 percent as good with no line at all.) But I'll still add my two cents:  Hot Doug's is very good but, based on a single visit, a little underwheming, too.  We had the good sense to arrive soon after opening on a Tuesday, at 10:45 am.  The line was only about five minutes long, which was just long enough to absorb Hot Doug's relatively extensive hot-dog menu and ever-rotating specials (and ""game of the week"") and make a reasonable decision about what to eat.  (I highly recommend visiting Hot Doug's at this odd hour.  Because we aren't the sort of folks who are wiling to wait in a two-hour restaurant line, let alone a two-hour restaurant line for a sausage-in-a-bun and french fries.)   We ordered the wild boar and venison sausage dogs.  Both were very good, the wild boar especially.  But not earth-shaking.  And sauce-and-provolone toppings were decent, but didn't seem to add all that much zip.  And the buns were blah.  I'm not really a fries freak, either, but these are fresh and crispy and way better than average.  And served in a very generous portion (a large order is more than enough for two). Still, without all the hype and lines, Hot Doug's has to be one of the best and most interesting hot-dog shops in Our Great Land.  Although this location is only a few years old, it feels like it might have been here for decades and has an old-school feel.  Doug Sohn himself is one of the most famous food ""personalities"" you'll personally encounter at the front of a house, and he is a warm, welcoming, friendly, and yet efficient host. The ""History of Encased Meats"" mural is an Instant Classic.  Good, non-dorky music on the sound system for the short time we were there.

2012-11-12,3.0,"I've been here like 2-3 times now, so I feel pretty confident in saying that Hot Doug's is overrated. I'm still giving it a 3 (it might be higher, but I'm not comfortable saying it's a 4) because the sausages are pretty decent, but the line is way ridiculous, it's pretty expensive, and the portions aren't huge. I guess you don't have to pay much if you just get a Chicago dog, but nobody goes here to get that. You go for the specialty sausages. Exotic. Sauternes duck foie gras (which is actually kind of weird and too rich). The most positive part of my experience in coming here is probably that they gave us a free hot dog once. That was pretty great. Pros: - cute - nice staff - novelty Cons: - price - ridiculous line If I weren't from Los Angeles and had never enjoyed the glory that is Wurstkuche (yeah you should yelp this now), I'd probably be more impressed by Hot Doug's, but having had a better version of what they're doing here, I can't help but feel sort of underwhelmed.",0.986,0.648,0.241,0.11,0.8031818181818182

The reason why I give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the duck fat fries.  The fries do not taste like they were fried in duck fat, or at least its not obvious.  I've fried fries in duck fat at home, and the flavor and smell is so much better.  I assume this is because they fry such huge quantities in duck fat that the flavor gets lost by the time afternoon customers come into eat.

Bacon Cheeseburger Beef Sausage - this is a bacon lover's hot dog with sweet barbeque sauce and a smokey flavor. This wasn't my favorite but my friend loved it. The Atomic Bomb - the name gives it all away. It comes with a very spicy sauce and some hot peppers. My second favorite hot dog out of the ones we tried. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage - this is hands down the best hot dog from this place. Originally, I thought the foie gras would be embedded in the sausage but it actually came with 4 circular shaped pates of foie gras on top. This was delicious...we got two of these because we were not sharing.  Saucisse de Morteau - this was a garlicky sausage with brie on top. It was a bit on the salty side for me but still an interesting dog.  Overall, I thought it was worth it to come out here to try some specialty hot dogs. The service was good and the restaurant had a very diner like atomosphere with colorful chairs and cool signs all over.

Not joking. I love it. It is so freaking delicious.  I've been here so many times and each was magical.  To those of you that complain about the line: DEAL WITH IT or don't go :) You will wait an hour on a Friday or Saturday. You will not wait an hour on a weekday especially if you go at 3pm.  It's not that complicated. General observations because I've been here so many times I can't talk about any one experience: Order two items off the specials menu. Do not waste time with the regular menu! I'm not saying it's bad, it is in fact also delicious, but you seriously just waited in line for an hour only to get a polish sausage? NO. Get something you can't get anywhere else. Get two specials. You will not be disappointed. When you take your order at the front, Doug asks you how you're doing and he sounds as if he truly cares how you're doing. The man's a genius. It's cash only because they can. The hours suck because they can.  The duck fat fries are not that special. Again: All the specials are delicious. I once ate something called the ""Mountain Man"" and it had five different animals in it. FIVE. I've also eaten rattlesnake, kangaroo, antelope. Where else can you say you've done that? And the condiments they use are truly unique and delectable and they're half the reason your meal will be so damn delicious. Do not get Hot Dougs confused with imitators in the Chicago area. I have been to those places and yes, they are also delicious, but they bring you nowhere near the taste bud  explosion you get from Hot Dougs.  Also, you will hear people say you can get a better Chicago style hot dog elsewhere. Well that could be the case, but where else can you eat five different animals at once? Hot dougs is not about hot dougs. It's about encased meats.

Chicago Style Dog - your typical Chicago dog.  They way the construct it and the ingredients they use make it stand out a little from all other Chicago dogs.  Their ingredients are super fresh and give the dog the flavors and texture that it truly needs! Foie Gras Dog -  overpowering!  The foie gras is tasty, but it completely overpowers any other flavor that would be in this dog.  The foie gras is super rich so you better share this dog with someone.   Duck Fat Fries -  fries on fries on fries.  They give you a hefty portion of fries at Hot Dougs.  They are super oily, but you can taste the duck fat which makes it perfectly okay to consume in my opinion.  They only serve these fries on Friday and Saturday.   We've had a handful of their other offerings, but with their constant name changes I lost track of the one's we've had.  They have all been tasty and wonderfully prepared.  The service is wonderful.  Everyone is always pleasant and willing to help you out, especially if its your first visit. #hellaYUMMS",0.9956,0.762,0.216,0.022,0.6522435897435896

Al nearly fainted after we were standing in line a while, I noticed the ""cash only sign"" and asked if he knew it was ""cash only"". I brought $20 just in case (usually I don't carry cash at all), 'fortunately my brother found $20 in his wallet.  We split two of their specials to try, and an order of cheese fries, and he had an extra Chicago Dog: I looked up their specials over the Internet before we went and it was funny when I was looking at the list of their specials on the wall, I couldn't find the ""Rabbit"".  Later I noticed there was the stuffed rabbit head hanging on the side of the list, highlighted ""Game of the Week"".  If it were alive it could have hopped into my face.. We tried: Ginger-Spiked Rabbit Sausage with Pumpkin Raita and Covadonga Blue Cheese -tasted autumn-like.  Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - tasted rich as in ""Life Styles of the Rich and Famous,"" rich. My brother also had a Chicago Dog, which he said was salty.  In my opinion, you can't trust health nuts when it comes to taste.  I didn't try his Chicago Dog.  If I ran the marathon and could afford the extra calories of an additional Chicago Dog, I'm sure I'd have thought it was perfect. We both liked the Rabbit the best. I liked how the prices posted on the wall reflected the price with taxes. When I ordered, I told them I'd have it ""to go"" in case we don't get a seat.  Doug was willing to bet me that we'd get a seat and sure enough, we did.  I told my brother, ""He knows his restaurant."" Doug was nice to advise my brother who was ordering a large drink, to get a small drink since we were eating in and they have free refills.  My brother observed, ""you can tell he loves his job.""

Today I went in around 1:30 PM with my mom for a quick lunch.  There was definitely a line that extended out the door, but it didn't take any longer than ten minutes to get to the register to order our food.  While my mom is less adventurous when it comes to food, neither of us dabble too exotically when it comes to what we put in our mouths.  Duck, I can do, Kangaroo, I. Just. Simply. Can't.  So we decided what we wanted before we got to the register (something everyone should do as the line is constantly long and it would simply be rude not to), my mom got the Bacon Cheeseburger Beef Sausage with Coca-Cola BBQ sauce and Maple-Smoked Cheddar Cheese while I got the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel.  We also got cheese fries to share.   We sat in their alley like patio as it was nice out and it felt a bit crammed inside with the amount of people surrounding us, either sitting or waiting in line.  With high expectations, I took my first bite... and it was simply just okay.  I wanted to find it to be the best sausage I've ever tasted, but it just wasn't.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not five stars worthy.  I don't blame the restaurant soley as I am unfortunately a HUGE texture gal and the texture and size of the foi gras mousse circular chunks just did not sit well with me.  I could handle them a bit better as I spread them out rather than ate then in whole chunks.  Also, the sausage itself was bursting with flavor.  On the other hand, the truffle aioli was decious.    My mom's was pretty tasty and she thought so as well, but again, nothing mind-blowing.  Our fries were the same as you would find at any other hot dog joint, but mind you, we weren't there on a Friday or Saturday to try the duck fat fries, which I will definitely get the next time I visit.  Yes, there will be a next time, as I have a lot more to try before I make my final overall opinion on the restaurant. I give this place four stars as their food was good, but mainly because of their originality, spunk, and wide-ranging eccentric menu.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something new out, but I personally prefer Frank 'N' Dawgs.",0.9944,0.845,0.123,0.032,0.5243298877992756

This feast was a bargain for the amount of food we were to inhale. First up was a spot on Chicago dog, complete with poppy seed bun, neon relish, and celery salt, this had it all. And to top it off, the dog itself had that perfect snap to it that every dog needs.  yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… The other dog I'll highlight here is their famed foie gras dog. Knowing that foie was about to be banned in stupid California, I knew I had to load up at every chance given. The foie here was more of a mousse, which wasn't bad at all. I'm not sure pure seared or raw foie would have worked on a dog. I take that back. Of course seared foie would work on ANYTHING (just like cream cheese) but beyond the cost savings, I enjoyed the fluffiness of the mousse. The richness was only intensified by the creamy truffle mayo sauce and you had to rely on the dog itself to cut through it all. Truly an indulgent treat that I now crave.  yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… The other two dogs we got were also very nice; one being a spicy fiery dog and the other was the daily special, a play on bangers and mash I think.

I'm not a fan of the duck fat fries and I could live a happier life not having to wait in line for 45 minutes to get some food; however, that doesn't detract from Hot Doug's serving some of the best cheap food anywhere. Where do I begin? Well, one should always order the Foie Gras Dog--if you come here and choose to forego this epic wurst and then proceed to say that Hot Doug's is 'meh', then your opinion lost all credibility. It's iconic to Hot Doug's and it's a best-seller for a reason; where else have you seen foie gras mousse on a hot dog that doesn't explicitly pay homage to Doug for creating it? Exactly. Second, the Chicago Dog is a clear-cut side-order when ordering the Foie Gras Dog. I'm really not a fan of the fries here as they have been too limpy and soggy (I've ordered both the regular and DFF), so you'll need something to cut through the richness of the Foie Gras--BAM. You take a bite of a Chicago Dog with its bright acidity to cut through the fatty goodness of your pièce de résistance. It's also only $2 (tax included) and simply well-made. Third, don't complain about the line. You should be very well aware of it by now if you're reading this review or this webpage. Your decision to come here should have already taken this into account. If you're surprised by a 30-45 minute wait, then it's your own fault. End of story. If you want to make the trip ""worth it"", load up on some non-saucy dogs that can hold up its structural integrity for a few hours (most of the cheese-based ones are great for this). Lastly, enjoy the company. The great thing about Hot Doug's is that it IS a tourist trap, but you mainly get the tourists who are also foodies. Even though I live in Chicago, I still feel like a tourist when I come here because I get to share my experiences about traveling to indulge my epicurean impulses. The patrons are serious about food here and you will have a chance to exchange recommendations for cities around the US--if not the world.

My hubby got the the specialty dog that was going to benefit charity -100% of the sales, not some cheesy 2%.  It was the Taco Pork Sausage with Green Chili Mustard, Elote Relish and Queso Asadero.  This is what I should have got as well.  Not that mine wasn't good, but this one was delish.  Luckily I talked him into sharing with me.  Mine was a portabella and swiss stuffed pork sausage with duck fat fried mushrooms, anchovy mayo and crispy onions.  We also split a polish sausage with caramelized onions and a huge serving of duck fat fries.   All in all, it was a good experience - even a great one.  But it just wasn't a solid 5 star experience.  Maybe scouting the specials menu for a month leading up to the trip and drooling over the thousands of Yelp reviews slightly ruined it for me.  4 star or 5 star we will be stopping next time we're in Chicago - and maybe it won't be a Friday!",0.9393,0.833,0.104,0.064,0.5351058201058201
2012-09-01,5.0,"Ok, so I am going to state up front that I am a hot dog fan. I have a tough time passing up any hot dog joint. So i was somewhat looking forward to a trip my fiancé planned to Chicago. I've never been, but a trip from Los Gatos to Chicago for the Labor Day weekend brought to mind visions of deep dish pizza and...epic hot dogs.  So I'm not going to pretend I have never heard of this place, although the guys in front of us in line were there randomly without a clue on the place. I have seen the Travel Channel shows and Food Channel exposé and read the guide books.  We encountered our first problem when my fiancé let me know that Hot Doug's is closed on Sundays, also closed for Labor Day Monday, the following Tuesday and Wednesday. Oh, and they close at 4:00 PM. My problem...we landed at 1:45 PM on Saturday and left on Tuesday night. That meant we had a 2 hour window to hit Hot Doug's. Problem solved by taking a taxi directly from the airport to the restaurant. Do not pass go, do not go to hotel. Baggage and all.  When we got here I knew we would be expecting a wait. A friend had prepared me for a 2 hour line. Got lucky. We arrived at 2:00 PM and we only had a 1 hour line on a Saturday. Felt great with that. DO NOT think it is going to be a quick trip. You will wait.  Finally got in at 3:00 and already had my order planned out. First and foremost was the Foie Gras Dog. I thought I may have over-hyped the idea of this hot dog beyond it's ability to deliver. SO WRONG! Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. I should have ordered 3. The $10 price is WAY worth it.  Next dog I went with was Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce, Caramelized Onions and Carrigaline Smoked Farmhouse Cheese. I had high hope for this. $8 per dog and sounds amazing. Anything with caramelized onions gets my buy. Wasn't quite as flavorful as the Foie Dog, but I feel like I should have eaten it first to avoid comparison.  It was still delicious. Don't take this paragraph as a negative.  Also got a ""The Dog"". ""Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the trimmings: 'nuff said"". At $2.00 it's one of the best buys on the menu. I was looking forward to this one almost as much as the Foie Dog. If you're going to go to Chicago, you'd better get a Chicago style dog. All the fixings...no exceptions. It was delicious. I mean good. They give you the option of a grilled or steamed bun. I went steamed. Can't argue for the grilled, but I like the ""squishy"" bun. Never had the neon green relish before...need to find a place to buy it in CA.  Now to the fiancé's order.  Her first choice was a bison special. Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Bison Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Mustard Seed Gouda Cheese. Very cheesy and over the top flavor. Amazing dog. $8.00 Then she got a little old school and went with a Corn Dog. It's a dog deep fried in batter. If you don't like that...there's no hope for you. Also, it's $1.50. Win, win. Last but certainly not least. Not even second...the Duck Fat Fries. They are unreal. Rich and flavorful. Anything deep fried in duck fat should be as good as these. $3.50. Huge basket, but only Friday and Saturday. Ok, this is the longest review I've ever written, but I felt each item needed a touch so you know that you HAVE to hit this place. No question, if you are in Chicago, this should be the first place you send your taxi. Do not pass go, do not go to hotel!",0.9984,0.796,0.168,0.036,0.5508435960591131

2012-08-30,5.0,"Big big fan. I wasn't sure it would live up to its reputation, but it sure does. Bring cash. Be patient if there's a line. I arrived on a summer Friday around 11am, and the wait was about 30 minutes. Like everyone claims, the owner Doug Sohn takes your order and couldn't be more friendly. He's very patient and gives s recommendations to those who are overwhelmed with all the delicious-sounding sausages available that day. After placing your order, find a seat and prepare yourself for what's about to come. The food comes out shortly. Then you feast, and your stomach becomes very happy. Mr. Sohn announces two sausages of the week on the Faceook page and Twitter. You can also check their website for the other sausages currently on rotation. (Hot Doug's closes for vacation on certain holidays and random days so it's smart to check Facebook, Twitter, or their website beforehand to make sure you're not making the trip to this sausage mecca only to be disappointed). Many of the sausages and their accompanying sauce/toppings change often so you can visit Hot Doug's many times and never have the same item twice. I haven't come across a bad one yet. The buns are soft and fresh, but they aren't toasted, buttered, etc like Franks N Dawgs. It doesn't matter though because these sausages and toppings are outstanding (far superior to Franks N Dawgs in my opinion). While many people love the duck fat fries available on Fridays and Saturdays only, they are thinner than their regular fries. I prefer a thicker cut fry so I actually like the regular fries more. The regular and duck fat fries are great, but focus on the sausages. Glorious. Prices are more than reasonable as well. One of my favorite spots in Chicago.

YES. 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel: hands down the best one and worth $10! 2) Chardonnay and jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with fig cream and dutch meadowkaas cheese: sweeter than expected but good 3) Regular chicago dog: I hate to admit that I like it better than NY dogs.

Every Hot Doug's adventure results in the same fantastic experience.  Whether it is the dead of winter, sweltering heat of summer or anytime in between, the line is long.  Forty five-minutes to an hour and a half, long.  For most, this excruciatingly cold, hot, mild wait for ""hot dogs"" is unacceptable.  For those who've ""seen the light"", this momentary sacrifice is a necessary evil that is eclipsed by good.

2012-08-23,5.0,"ENCASED MEAT HEAVEN! I came here on November 2010 and I STILL dream about the food here. I don't care if my review gets lost in the already 2000+ reviews for this place or if my review is even necessary to highlight how amazing the hot dogs are here. I would actually be doing myself a disservice by not writing a review of my experience.  To this day, I still have not found a hot dog place that comes close to how delicious the food is here. I don't know what they do, but they're doing something right with encased meat. The boy and I came here on a cold November Saturday morning. If someone flicked my ear, I'm pretty sure it would have fallen off. And on top of that, we stood behind some cranky person in line who wouldn't let us through the door when we got close to the front of the restaurant just because she wanted to keep the cold air out. But no cold weather and cranky person could ruin our Hot Doug's experience.  Between the two of us, we ordered: -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris (I can't say that ten times repeatedly because I'll be drooling after saying it once.)  -Spicy Jerk Dog with Jerk Mayonnaise, Mashed Plantains and Baby Belletoile Cheese  -Bison Dog: Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Bison Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mayonnaise and Irish Porter Cheese -Regular Chicago Dog -Duck Fat Fries Honestly, we didn't even touch the Chicago Dog and I honestly can't remember what the duck fat fries tasted like. It was all about the three special hot dogs we ordered. The Fois Gras duck sausage KILLED IT! But my personal favorite was the Spicy Jerk Dog. The cheese, plaintains, and mayonnaise surprisingly went well together and just melted in my mouth. And it had a slight, spicy kick to it. And the Bison Dog was smoked to perfection and had HUGE blocks of cheese that crushed easily in our mouths. The quality of the sausages here is seriously top notch. Smoked and grilled just right. Flavors really packed in there. Toppings complement the flavor of the meat. Not too dry, just succulently right. You know it's good sausage when you can hear and feel the encasing snap when you bite into the sausage. I dream about the day that I'll return to this heavenly place to take another bite out of their sausages.  I'm having Foie Gras withdrawals in California!

Why am I doing this again? 11:00 AM (!!!!!) - The restaurant is already packed with a line pretty much out the door!!!! Ummm, is Hot Doug's really that good? 11:30 - Well it does smell delicious, but I can't wait to take my first bite and just think about the bad review I will write.  11:31 (First bite)- WOW! (Repeat every 30 seconds) If you didn't get it from above, let me tell you here: Hot Doug's is by far the best sausage!!!!! We ordered the Kangaroo Sausage (with yellow pepper aioli and feta cheese) and the Philly Cheesesteak (cream cheese mustard, onions, and provolone cheese)! Hot Doug's does such an amazing job designing their sausage sandwiches! They take flavor, color, and texture all into play to create the most delicious sausage combinations. They must have a flavor laboratory that they do research in! You can actually taste the gaminess of the Kangaroo. The provolone cheese is actually stuffed into the Philly Cheesesteak sausage casing. All the flavors were synced in perfect harmony and I could not ask for more.  Unfortunately, this was only stop 3 out of 10 of a full day's worth of eating in Chicago, so we could only try 2 sausages. You can come here daily and still not have tried all the sausages they offer. I need to stop now before I spontaneously book a flight to Chicago just for Hot Doug's.

In fact, there was a worker who came out and said, ""We are glad that you guys came all the way here for our food, but the fact is that you will be waiting on this line for around 2 hours. We recommend going to another place to eat. We will always be here. If you do decide to stay on the line, please be sure to stay hydrated.

You can't be featured by Anthony Bourdain and just shut down for a whole WEEK, and then brag about that reasoning on the door. Several other people walked up while we were standing there, with the same reaction. We all left angry and hungry.

In response, how would you like me to edit my review to be more fair? I'm sorry, I'm not saying nobody needs a day off, or that successful entrepreneurs can never take a vacation.  He should have a days off like everyone else.  I respect him for giving ALL of his workers Sundays off!  If he wanted to give them Mondays too, more power to them. I don't care that Doug himself or his workers take a week off, that's not what I was going for; he just has to have enough hired help to cover his business.  The restaurant business is not known for being able to drop off the face of the earth for a week at a time; keeping a fair schedule is part of being in the industry, especially for a restaurant that has been featured on the Travel Channel and regarded as Chicago's best and exists as more than a neighborhood favorite.  Please tell me, am I wrong?  I can't think of too many industries, such as restaurant and retail, who get to just take a week off without making customers mad.  And, I think others had a right to know in case they ended up trying to go there in those eight days.... it wasn't like we just picked one bad day, we wouldn't have made it the whole time we were in town. I know things come up.  I would have been sympathetic with a needed DAY or two or even three off (not eight), or a reasonable excuse (""My son is getting married on the East Coast"", ""my grandma is in the hospital"", ""my wife is in labor!"", etc.) ...  Or, take a couple days off around one of the the other holidays in the other eleven months!  Take four days off for labor day, nobody will question that.     OR, if you must take eight days, less is more: let us wonder if someone died or your kid is going to college or if you've got the plague.

2012-07-31,5.0,"One of my favorite spots in Chicago! I have been there at least 7 times and it seems to get better each time.  On my first visit I I waited in the line for two hours and it was worth every minute (if the line wraps around to the alley/dumpsters expect about a two hour wait).  In fact, after the first hour I said to my roommate, ""This wait better be worth it...""  After another hour in line and then eating our meal, I felt bad for even questioning it. But don't worry, the line isn't always that long.  If you can go on a weekday before the lunch rush, the wait can be a matter of minutes. Make sure to try a specialty sausage.  If I am with a friend we usually each order a different one and then split them.  The regular dogs and the ""fire dog"" are always great as well.  If you go on Friday and Saturday and fail to order the duck fat fries, there might just be something loose in your brain.  If you think that pork fat tastes good (think bacon and smile), then duck fat will be right up your alley.  Different flavors, but the same savory experience. If you stick with a dog and fries, it is a pretty cheap meal.  Once you venture into the wonderful world of specialty sausages, the costs begin to rise.  But, just as the wait, the cost is worth it.   And finally, the rumors about the tattoo are true!  I asked Doug and he told me that if you get the Hot Doug's logo tattoo, you get free Hot Doug's for life. The Rules: 1. It has to be big enough (check with Doug for actual size requirements). 2. Doug won't always ask to see it, but when he does, you have to be ready to show it. 3. You get your food for free, not the people who you bring with you. 4. You do not get to skip the line, as Doug says, ""That's crazy talk.""",0.9876,0.83,0.136,0.033,0.5210564960564962
2012-07-30,5.0,"So I took my second visit to Hot Doug's in my second visit to the Windy City.  I'm pretty sure Hot Doug's will be a staple-stop on all return visits.  I'll break down both my visits on this review: #1 - This visit took place back in April of 2011.  I was by myself and it was on a weekday for lunch.  I got there at about 11:00 and there was a line just outside the door.  The wait to order was about 20 minutes.  I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Sausage with plantains and remoulade.  It was quite simply one of the tastiest items of food that have ever entered my mouth.  After the first bite all I could think about was how long I could take savoring this sausage.  I even looked at the line and considered getting back in line to order another one.  The fries were solid but not spectacular.  I'm not a fries guy anyway and immediately regretted not just ordering two sausages.  I can't explain how well the flavor of the sausage worked with the plantains and remoulade.  It was just perfect. #2 - This time the visit took place on Friday, July 27th.  This time I also had the family with me (wife, 9-year old son, 12-year old daughter).  I ordered the game of the week.  It was a Kangaroo Sausage with Yellow Pepper Aioli, and Goat Feta Cheese.  It was outstanding.  The kangaroo had a very different flavor that I can't really describe but it went very well with the condiments.  I also ordered the Norm Crosby, which is a German Thuringer sausage with beef, pork, garlic and other spices.  It was very good also.  I got mine with spicy mustard and tomatoes.  My wife ordered the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Creole Mustard, Hominy Grits, and Goat cheese.  She got hers minus the grits.  The Creole Mustard and Goat Cheese were too rich for her so she scraped it off and put mayo on it.  Thank god Doug didn't see it or he might have banned us from the restaurant.  I almost slapped her for the sheer embarrassment.  After she only ate 1/2 of hers I reapplied the creole mustard and goat cheese and finished hers.  It was even better than the Kangaroo.  Daughter got the Polish and son got the Italian.  They were both solid, but to me the way to go is the specials. In closing I can't recommend Hot Doug's enough.  But get the specials, not only because of the sausage, but the special condiments add a world of flavor.",0.963,0.868,0.087,0.045,0.45393901420217214

2012-07-25,4.0,"There are many restaurants in Chicago that have a Buzz Gap, where the buzz a particular place gets does not delivered in terms of how good the food is. There is something about people waiting in line and popularity in general that woos foodies into believing something is much better than it actually is. Hot Doug's is definitely not one of these places.  If you live in Chicago, at one point or another you've heard about Hot Doug's-- about how good it is, and how hard it is to get inside the place. They're only open 6 days a week, for 5 hours a day, only accept cash, and there is almost always a line. ""Go during the week,"" people will say, ""because you will have to wait at least an hour on a Saturday."" You will wait that long on a Saturday and probably about 15-30 minutes on a weekday. But if you are free and up for it, by all means.  The specialty Dogs run about $8.00, with normal dogs running about $3. The specialty are the way to go, because they are great and the menu changes.  For example, ""The Dick Kelley"" is a Curry Pork and Veal Sausage with Spinach Raita and Queso Zamorano. The spinach sauce and shredded cheese on this were mouthwatering, as was the actual sausage. It's just one of the most unique set of flavors that you will get anywhere in the city. Most importantly, the flavors work together and aren't just piled on for quantity like an ""Awesome Meal Time"" dish. Kangaroo, Alligator, and other exotic sausage are also currently on the menu, each with a gourmet array of toppings.  Doug's is definitely a touristy/popular place to go, especially after the Anthony Bourdain appearance, but it will cost you time and patience. For that reason, it's not a place that I want to take a group of friends/family if they're in town. But, if I do get off work early for a doctor's appointment, it's one of the first places for lunch that comes to mind.",0.9384,0.915,0.071,0.014,0.6182291666666666

Mind-Bendingly Good (in order of preference): * Thuringer - Best dog ever.  A perfectly charred dog with a perfect mix of garlic? * Chicago - Awesome.  The pickle, the snap of the dog, I want one right now. * Chicken & Gruyere  - Melts in your mouth into a puddle of cheesy deliciousness Also Awesome: * Elk - Great flavor, but a bit drier than the perfectly oozing dogs above. * Andouille - If my local market did this as well, I'd have sausage weekly. Tasty, but not for me: * Duck & Fois Gras - It's rich, it's tasty, but while I like it...

After waiting about 25 minutes on a Monday afternoon, I knew that this man had to be right. Once we were inside HD's, Doug was at the counter taking orders. I had scanned the menu and knew what I wanted and Doug was incredibly friendly and efficient. He truly knows how to run a successful business. You are not to sit until after you order-this ensures that you will get a seat no matter what. Because of this my friends and I sat down and were promptly served our food.  I ordered the ""Celebrity Sausage"", which was a shrimp and pork dog topped with grits, grainy mustard and goat cheese. Not only was the sausage uniquely flavored, but the contrast of flavors and textures on this dog were incredible. My mind was blown. We also shared the Chicago Dog which was delicious. And the fries? Ok, I know I didn't come in on a duck fat day but I can only imagine how delicious they must be. These regular fries were just crispy enough and delicious.  I would consider myself lucky to have waited less than half an hour to eat at Hot Doug's. I would easily wait another hour to taste this deliciousness again.

My bf's ribeye sausage hot dog was better and had add-ins that complemented it well, but it wasn't amazing either. We also split the foie gras and duck sausage, topped with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse. That one was better than expected, but once again, not worth the wait.

2012-06-09,5.0,"Hot Doug's is one of the most famous restaurants in the city of Chicago. Arriving a little more than 30 minutes before they opened on a Saturday morning I was able to find street parking and my place in the already long line built up to enter this establishment. The line moves quickly and soon I was ready to place my order. Obviously, I had to try the Chicago style hot dog. I also tried the ""Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Smokey Bacon Sauce and Sage Derby Cheese"", and an order of Duck Fat Fries. To my delight Hot Doug's also had a cooler stocked with bottles of Green River soda. On to the actual food itself, the ""Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Smokey Bacon Sauce and Sage Derby Cheese"" I received was a delicious smoky sausage with bits of cheese on it. I can't really think of anything to compare the flavor to. This was absolutely fantastic and is one of the best things I've ever eaten. I seriously wish I could have bought a second one to take home without having to re-enter the line again. The regular Chicago-Style hot dog was a well steamed Vienna Beef dog, it came on a nice poppy seed bun, all of the regular Chicago style fixings were there. The pickle included wasn't long enough so that you could get pickle in every bite however. The sport peppers were slightly hotter than I preferred, overall this is a very good Chicago style hot dog, but certainly not the best.  The duck fat fries were tasty and for the 3.50 or so they cost I got a huge amount of them. They tasted like normal fresh cut fries, there's a slightly different aftertaste to them compared to most places, these were good but on my next visit I'll stick with cheese fries. Overall, Hot Doug's is a great place to eat at. While there are better places to get a Chicago-Style Hot Dog. No one has a greater variety of unusual sausage combinations. It's hard for me to emphasize how fantastic the Buffalo Sausage was. I will definitely be making a return trip sometime in the near future. Big thumbs up!",0.9951,0.817,0.161,0.021,0.5265437447168216
2012-06-09,5.0,"Most Amazing Birthday Lunch Ever! My bf and I visited Chicago for a short vacation. We share the same birthday, and wanted to have a fun, outrageous, and only-in-Chicago experience. After spending the early afternoon on the Architecture Foundation Boat Tour, we took a cab to Hot Doug's (we walked to the nearest CTA station afterwards, and it was a pretty far and somewhat shady journey). It was a Wednesday afternoon, so the line wasn't long. Only 2 people out the door as opposed to the block-long line you would see on Fridays and Saturdays. True, coming on the weekday means no duck fat fries, but we came for the hot dogs. Plus, I would imagine that locals avoid Hot Doug's during those tourist days. Instead, the weekday line is populated with locals - we struck up a long conversation with the guy in front of us who lives nearby and visits Hot Doug's once a week! Following the local's advice, we ordered off the Specials menu: Saucisson Alsacienne, Antelope Sausage, and of course, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. Doug was there taking the orders - it's very refreshing to meet the owner of a small business, and all the more reason to visit Hot Doug's. My bf and I split the three hot dogs, so that we could both taste each one. The Antelope Sausage was lean yet juicy, with a spicy mayo sauce and sliced cheese, slightly melted. The Saucisson Alsacienne with its creme fraiche and cheesy toppings provided a great contrast: a spicy hot dog followed by a smooth and creamy one.  But the showstopper was the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage! The duck sausage was incredibly meaty. The truffle aioli and bursts of fleur de sel added depth and flavor. And the foie gras came as 4 perfectly round discs, artfully layered on top. I've seen various photos on Yelp of the foie gras served as a crumbled mess - perhaps we lucked out! The trip out to Hot Doug's is definitely worth it, even without the duck fat fries.

After the requisite wait outside, we sat down with some equally food savy patrons at a table. I ordered the duck sausage dog with foie-gras, alligator dog, and chorizo chicken dog with mole. The duck sausage and foie-gras was absolutely sublime. I don't remember what sauce was on it but it was ridiculously rich and decadent. The alligator dog was well done and the star was definitely the alligator meat which was surprisingly slightly swampy. I think the mole on the chicken sausage was probably the best sauce out of all three. It was a very interesting mixture of different spices that somehow didn't get muddled out all together. After seemingly eating my body weight in hot dogs, I stumbled out of the restaurant in a meat induced trance. I have no idea or recollection of how I drove home with that degree of food coma setting in but the entire experience was perfect.

It had fantastic flavor and fried prosciutto on top. So very good and juicy..... The Rib-eye was my fiance's favorite. The Andouille was in no way disappointing, it was very very good.

On Saturday, another attempt was made for lunch but our lack of knowledge of public transportation caused us to be late.

Ten minutes before closing, we finally make it to the front of the line.... to find out it was cash only. We had about $20 between the three of us so we sadly agreed to split two hot dogs between three empty stomachs.

2012-05-28,5.0,"My dad wanted to get a Chicago style hot dog since I moved out here 3 years ago. For whatever reason, it has taken this long for us to get our act together and get that darn hot dog. During my parents' most recent visit in April, I sifted through tons of reviews and decided to take them to Hot Doug's, as it appeared to be the leader of the pack.  This place absolutely did NOT disappoint! I read that it gets crowded and to be prepared for a wait, so we arrived about 30 minutes after opening. The line was already out the door and starting to form along the side of the building, which appears to be the norm. By the time we got to the counter to order we were hungry and ready to go! I tend to expect big hotspots like this to have a snooty, stuck up way about them - like how some philly cheesesteak places in philly yell at you for asking for ketchup - but Hot Doug's was the opposite. The man taking our order (Doug?) took his time with us first-timers, explaining the menu and how to order exactly what we wanted. He also answered all my dad's questions about the meat. And to top it all off, the three of us were stuffed for a mere $20 bill, which included 3 really tasty root beers.

2012-05-21,1.0,"During the sixties and into the late seventies a whole generation of liberal white Americans participated in numerous counter cultural movements including joining with Black and Brown human rights activists and every day people to fight for justice from Selma Alabama to Vietnam.  What we have today is The Walking Dead standing in long lines at Hot Dougs a right of passage  into mindless American midwest pop consumerism.  I went there once along time ago with a friend from India who was studying American political culture during the 1960's and 70's and I felt bad when I could not explain why so many seemingly educated Chicagoans could make an event out of standing in a long line in the cold to eat greasy fries and designer nine dollar hot dog that taste similar to a polish suasage or bratwurst sold down the street for a a dollar ninety five. All I could say was out of Woodstock, mass consumerism based upon nostalgia for 1950's segregation replaced civic engagement  for white liberals in the form of cultural phenomenas like Hot Dougs cause, you know the Elvis dog is just so like uhm totally rad.  What's hilarious is that suburanites and tourist from Iowa call Hot Dougs ""the quintessential Chicago experience"" How ridiculous is that? Studs Terkel and Mike Royko would spit down from above if they heard this. So the moral of the story is, if you want the quintessential Chicago experience don't go to any place where consumer driven hipsters are standing in long lines. Real Chicagoans don't go to places like that for a hot dog.  Also, Chicago isn't 98 percent white, which should be another dead give away with respect to authentic or quintessential, unless it's a Cubs game. Finally, any place with Maui chicken or ""foie gras"" in their hot dogs? Not real Chicago. And I doubt it's really ""foie gras"" because its banned in Chicago so I'd think PETA would be up in arms if a ""politically correct"" place like Hot Dougs broke that law. Well actually it would make sense for a politically correct place like Hot Dougs to brake an anti cruelty law because that's what they do for a buck. Now if you wanna the best Polish in Chicago, go to Sam's Red Hots on the Armitage, just remember no one has ever died from eating there and the Latin Kings and Insane Unknowns on the corner are far more entertaining than jabbering hipsters with captions over their heads that read ""Empty""",-0.7582,0.819,0.085,0.095,0.48238378684807265

Excellent product but not culinary nirvana.  Well prepared, well-conceived and well-crafted sausages.  But it's a sausage, and if you or I made a sausage (even our first crack at making a sausage) it would taste 80% as good because it's just salty meat.  Elk tastes like bison tastes like alligator tastes like pig tastes like turkey tastes like lips and assholes. The food is good.  The line obviously adds mystique.   There is no magic here.  I can't really offer any better options but if you want ""Chicago Dog"" go to Portillo's or, hell, Home Depot.

Elvis -- I love polish hotdogs (Kielbasas) and they put relish, a pickle, and grilled onions on it. For $3, it was worth it. Overall rating: The food was a 5/5.

2012-05-13,5.0,"Hot Doug's is a part of my history! I went to Lane Tech for high school and I use to go to Doug's when it was on roscoe and Oakland. The place was so different from big boy gyros and other hot dog places. My lunch mates and I loved the dogs and we went almost EVERYDAY our sophomore year- he even signed our year books. It was so hip and he'd put vh1 on the tv. I still have a monkey pin I got from Doug's and I keep it on an old belt I had. I feel like I've seen Doug's place grow from the beginning and he has remained genuine.  First time I had rabbit, elk, buffalo, antelope, kangaroo and much more. My favorite was something called the frankenwurst- 10in hotdog with 1.5 in diameter- stupendous. I'd go eat Doug's and then go to gym class and outperform everyone due to the warrior topping on hot Doug's dogs. Then, it happened. Dougs burned to the ground. The people above him were careless and and those hot dogs were too charred. However, like the Phoenix Doug is, he rose from his ashes and moved across the river. 1st day he opened a new location, I ran during lunch to get there. I literally climbed the fence separating high school property from public property, crossed the river and ran to Doug's all sweaty and all- I felt like the girl in ""The Village"" finding the cure for Joachim Phoenix. Ever since, Doug is so nice and he knows what it means to make loyal customers. Anyway here's the low down: Price- great price for what you get. Regular dog is $1.50 (cash only). Special dog is around $7 but they are so unique- fois gras done, chicken peanut dog, alligator...dog. Quality- can' be beat. Char dog is my fav. My friend use to love char and fried. Fries are good to and very homemade. Quantity- you can get a good amount of food for what you pay- Frankenwurst- $10 maybe. Atmosphere- lots of blue, red and yellow. Very retro place with lots of memorabilia. Staff- Doug is rude- he's like his own Ed debevics but he's actually loveable. He gives tough love and has helped me grow in my career. Check this place out and buy as much as you can because you probably won't go everyday- unless you are a sophomore at lane tech and have 4th period lunch",0.9906,0.861,0.115,0.025,0.5320510970510973

We waited an hour and fifteen minutes to just order our food. I definitely wouldn't call this place ""fast"" food by any means, but I think it's worth the wait. You're not allowed to sit down until after you order. Surprisingly enough, the tables turn over pretty quickly so no one is ever with food and without a seat. Once you place your order, it comes out fast and you consume it fast. I guess that's where the ""fast"" in the ""fast food"" saying comes from.  The food is really good and it's fairly cheap too.

The flavor in that sausage was excellent, great combo of all things tasty, that Truffle Balsamic drizzle was like liquid crack. The Wild Boar Pate was diced up & sprinkled on top, I thought it was cheese at first because they have the same consistency, but you can pick up a hint of that boar. The cheese fries were heavenly, had that ooey gooey cheese that I love & the corndog was great as well.  Had outdoor seating feeling the windy city doing it's thing. Added more to the experience.

2012-04-26,4.0,"Chicago has always been famous for their hot dogs and Hot Doug's does it well. It's a staple in Chicago and an institution in the hot dog realm. Los Angeles has their Pink's, New York has Crif Dogs, and Chicago has Hot Doug's. Alligator, ostrich, duck... I heard about the wild flavors at Hot Doug's but never did I imagine they would have rattlesnake! I'm not so adventurous that I would order the rattlesnake on my own but my friend did along with the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. Talk about rich, sinful, and out of this world snack food. The texture of the rattlesnake meat was very soft. Good thing it had the casing to keep it all together. The foie gras hot dog was heavy. I couldn't imagine one person eating it all by him/herself. It's best cut up and distributed amongst the table. The foie gras on top was shaped in coin slivers. The heat of the hot dog did begin to melt it and only then did the hot dog really come together. The Fleur de Sel helped bring out the flavors. These two hot dogs were not my favorite but in terms of something different and a bang for your buck, these were it. A high end restaurant could do these hot dogs and charge an arm and a leg for them.  I had the brown ale chipotle buffalo sausage, bacon garlic mayo and carragaline farmhouse cheese dog. It was great. Lots of the hot dogs come with some sort of mustard infused sauce. I am not a mustard fan but the sauces are really good and I do like the variety of cheeses they use. They definitely don't skimp on their ingredients. For classics sake, we got a Dave Pound (corndog) and a Classic Chicago dog. What a deal. For about $2 you can indulge in what I call nostalgic bliss and a piece of Chicago. The Chicago dog comes with whichever toppings you want- tomatoes, pickles, mustard, etc. Good luck stuffing it in your mouth. We also got the weekend duck fat fries. I wasn't too impressed with them. They were just regular fries but one serving is plenty for four people. We actually got two fries. Too much but best believe we packed all that food away. Guilty pleasures! Hot Doug's is a fun stop in the suburbs of Chicago. The line is knee deep. We got there half an hour before they were open and were in the first batch but any later and you could be waiting 2 hours or so. The people come in droves.

The people I was with ordered a variety of things, including the rattlesnake dog, which they all raved about. The duck fat fries were good, but not great. I've definitely had better fries elsewhere.

And, what I found was about $8 and three dimes and a button from an old dress shirt.  I immediately turned to the board is a fevered panic and began crunching the numbers to see what I could afford with the only CASH (and a button) I had on hand.    Then in the midst of my panic state, it was my turn in line.  I explained to Doug (who was working) that it was my first time there and that I some how overlooked the whole CASH ONLY thing.... (with a meager smile). Doug was really cool and the woman behind me reassured me that everything would be okay - and that if you're a bit short just tell Doug that **** sent you.   So, I ordered with confidence and everything from there fit perfectly into the theme of hot dog happiness.  I was able to enjoy two Chicago dogs, a brat with kraut and a root beer with a little help from *****.      Hot Doug's is what everyone says it is - perfect hot dog bliss in one of the greatest food cities in the world.  Just remember, bring CASH!",0.9963,0.794,0.173,0.033,0.6749396135265701

Bring cash and I'd say big eaters can probably put away 3-4 dogs, with the most expensive ones being $6-7.

2012-04-21,5.0,"My lawdy, I am glad that my blogger friend told me to go here. The line was quite long on a Saturday morning even though we had just gotten there about 20 minutes after they had opened for the day. I believe we waited in line about an hour in the cold windiness before we could even get to the menu. I snagged a picture of the random pig they had outside and the menus they had inside. Talk about crazy! There were normal hot dogs with sausages you'd think of such as hot dog, andouille, chicken sausage, etc but then there were the ""specials"" which had a wide range from rabbit to elk to buffalo to rattlesnake. Feeling adventurous (and also because I had waited so long), I opted for the most decadent one. So my first was the regular ""The Dog"" which was Chicago-style complete with Kosher pickle, carmelized onions, tomatoes, lots of mustard, poppy seed bun, celery salt, and NEON relish. I mean, look at the picture! It was bright green and kind of awkward. I know I pictured it first but it was actually the last hot dog I tried so I didn't finish it. To be honest, nothing remarkable seeing as the sausage itself was fairly normal; I felt that all the toppings were overbearing but hey, gotta eat the Chicago way! My friend got the Chardonnay and jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with roasted pepper aioli and Pere Joseph cheese. Wow. The aioli and cheese paired so perfectly with that rattlesnake meat. It was like a bite into the Southwest with the spicy kick from the sauce and the juiciness of the rattlesnake sausage. My order was to opt for the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (sea salt...basically). It was the creamiest, most awesome hot dog I've ever had. Even my friend who has never tasted those ingredients before thought it was the best he'd ever had. I mean, I love all of those flavors but who would've thought to stick it on a bun as encased meat and top it off so lovingly with foie gras rounds. The fleur de sel curbed the overly savory-sweet but light creaminess of the foie gras mousse on top while the heavy truffle aioli pulled us away into a different kind of heaven than the gamier duck meat. I loved licking my lips after every bite to get the most truffle flavor out of my experience. Best. Hot Dog. Ever. Completely worth the wait, especially with the nice touch of having bottled gourmet sodas (had a birch beer) and an atmosphere completely fitting with a hot dog culture. Fantastic. Lastly, I made sure to come here on the Saturday I was here because they had their duck fat fries (Friday and Saturday only). Some pretty heavy fries, those. I liked them a lot but definitely had to throw in the towel after so much food.

Arrived here on Good Friday a little after 10am to find a line (already!) of other meat eaters on a Friday during Lent.  It doesn't matter what your religion is, when you come to Hot Doug's you celebrate the religion of delicious encased meat. all are welcome! And visiting with a group of meat lovers is a great way to worship!  I ordered the Duck Sausage and the bro and I decided to split the Lamb Sausage and the Chicago Dog.  Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, topped with Truffle Aoili, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de sel.  This is one super rich dog. The sausage was delicious and I loved the Truffle Aoili.  The Foie definitely added the richness, I couldn't finish it, I think if I order it next time, I'll ask for more Aoili and half of the Foie. I loved the Aoili--I kept dipping the delicious fries in it.  The Lamb Sausage, topped with spicy Harissa and Feta. This was very tasty also.  I didn't like the texture of the sausage (a little dry for me), but the flavors together was good.  The Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Goat Cheese--I got to try this one and even though it was only a couple of bites, this one was definitely my favorite of the day.  So flavorful--who knows, if i had a whole one, i might have left speaking a cajun accent! The poor Chicago Dog was almost an afterthought since I was already full from the other dogs.  But the taste of Sweet Home Chicago was there--this was one solid dog.  **For the stroller set.  This is not the place to bring a stroller--unless HD is not full of folks.  I got here when the place was fairly empty so my little guy in his umbrella stroller maneuvered well. (and we're talking the basic basic umbrella stroller--the one that looks like it's for dolls. Anything bigger would have been a horrible hindrance)  Grab the table in the corner near the window--a great place for stroller and table as there's not room for anything else and stroller is out of the way of anyone tripping. Because of the long line we had to walk through on leaving, I carried little boy out while my brother carried the folded stroller. Worked well without running over people's feet with stroller wheels. If I would have gotten here any later, said stroller would have stayed in the car and I would have toted the prince in the baby bjorn.

The Foie Gras hot dog is (again) OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've never tasted anything like it. It's so unique and delicious. Definitely worth the 20 minute wait outside.  Service: excellent. Doug (the owner and operator) is always there taking orders. He doesn't rush his customers. He answers all questions. He jokes around and he helps us get the order correct (he doesn't jip or trick you). He encouraged us to just share drinks, since it doesn't make sense to get one drink per person. He could have easily made us order more fries, but he helpfully suggested that we go with only one - he claims he doesn't believe in portion control and therefore gives a lot more fries than one person can eat. The duck fat fries (served only on Fri and Sat) aren't all that spectacular. But if you've never tried it. Def try it here.  Drinks: They have unique bottled sodas. Try the Green River - a 7-up/Sprite type of drink, but made of pure Sugar Cane AND no caffeine or artificial flavoring.  If you go, BRING CASH ONLY. They don't accept anything else.  DECOR: Funny.

Oh well, more reasons to come back to Chi town. I ordered the foie gras duck hot dog with white truffle aioli. It's about 3x the cost of the other hot dogs which are about $2-3 each but it is so worth it. The foie gras was not seared, which disappointed me at first. However, after one bite of the dog and I knew why. When the foie gras is seared, the texture of it becomes a little firmer and therefore, does not melt in your mouth as quickly. By not searing it, you are ensuring that the foie gras melt in your melt with the juice of the duck sausage. With the addition of the truffle aioli, the combination is just superb. AHHHH, what a superb combination. I wished LA had something like this. I've said it once and I'm not afraid to say it again. The foie gras hot dog with the duck sausage and white truffle aioli is the best hot dog I've ever had. Hands down.  A friendly reminder - this place is cash only. Not sure if they have an ATM machine, but bring lots of cash! You'll want 2nds! Very friendly service. A little smelly though, from the grease. All worth it for the best hot dog I've ever had.",0.9958,0.809,0.186,0.004,0.5726697530864199
2012-03-26,5.0,"100th Review!  When your friend tells you that there is still an hour long line in the middle of Chicago winter, you know this place has to be good. I can't say that I loved hot dogs until my last trip to Chicago and I tried Portillo's Chicago dog, and it was love at first bite. So I now have a new love for meat in a tube. Doug's was a quick bus ride, and as expected the line was wrapped around the building. With 4 of us eating, we all decided we would each order 2 and all share. We stragetically planned our meal, and of course with duck fat fries. Duck fat fries, what? Holy fried goodness! These were delicious, not oily or greasy at all. Perfection! I have to say my favorite dog was the Pecan-Smoked Jalapeno Pork Sausage with Mustard Girl Horseradish Mustard, Fried Tortillas and Chihuahua Cheese. Oh man, I'm still dreaming of it. The following is my other favorites, in order... Bacon Cheeseburger Beef Sausage with Cherry Coke BBQ Sauce,  Smoked Cheddar Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions Smoked Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and Aged Iberico Cheese,  The Teuben: Swiss Cheese-Stuffed Corned Beef Sausage with Russian Dressing, Sauerkraut and Swiss Cheese.

2012-03-07,5.0,"A trip to Chi Town without the infamous Chicago Dog is injustice. Rave reviews from Anthony Bourdain, Zimmerman, and local food critics pointed me to Hot Doug's.  An ever changing menu of dozen or more varieties of Dogs and Duck Fries; how could one go wrong? Unbeknownst to me the week we traveled to Chicago, Chi Town was hit with a heat wave with sweltering unimaginable hot temperatures.  However, I wasn't to be deterred by 100 degree temperatures.  Since we were staying on Michigan Mile, it was a bit of trek to check out Hot Doug's. I decided to stop by after my lunch at Sabri Nihari on Devon Avenue (both on North West side). Now all of us were already carbed out with our Indian/Pakistani luncheon. My son (such a trooper) shared my enthusiasm for Hot Doug's.  We reached Hot Doug's a bit after 3 pm in our cab. To my surprise, there was still a long line out the small shop. Did I make the right call? Should we wait in this heat? Well, after all we were already there. Why not? The wait in line gave us the time to decide from the multitude of choices facing us.  I had to make my decision wisely since only 2 of us were willing to taste and share. I ordered the classic Chicago Dog and the glutton in me picked Foie gras and Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, and some Fries. (Note the Duck Fat Fries are only made on the weekends). Incidentally it is a cash-only counter.  One bite of my Foie Gras and Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli; I was literally in decadent hog heaven. Yes!! It was absolutely worth it. And my snooty ass will withstand any long line for another bite, any time.  I wish I had the appetite to try their other game concoctions, but there is always the next time.

2012-03-02,5.0,"On this last trip to Chicago I was asked ""If you only had time to eat at one place in Chicago, where would it be?"" My instantaneous and emphatic answer was Hot Doug's. No Alinea, No L2O, I want Hot Doug's. Let me say this first, there is NO reason for Doug or his staff to be as nice and welcoming as they are. They make the meat equivalent of black tar heroin, and they could treat me like utter garbage and I would still come back. But anyone who comes here is impressed that Doug himself is taking your order and is nice as could be. The rest of the staff is great as well and always offer to take your tray and garbage for you. We had our suitcases with us this last time and they found a place to store them for us while we were there. I mean crap dude, they must serve hundreds of people EVERY day and they are willing to go out of their way to accommodate some obvious out-of-towners. Doug even told us that if we wanted to order more we could just bypass the line and order from the side. Dude ... you rule man. We always get the foie gras dog. I would liken it to petting a platypus. It's something that just shouldn't exist but there it is in front of you and you just need to partake somehow (I do realize platypi have poisonous barbs. I would avoid those obviously). Sorry, got off track. The foie gras dog is truly a pinnacle of food in some way. It's right up there with the first tomato sauce or the first loaf of bread. The first time I ate it I felt a sense of fulfillment, like an empty spot in the collective human existence had been filled by a sausage. It was a moment of clarity where all I could do was smile and say ""Oh, I see. I get it now. It all makes sense."" We also always get an original Chicago style hot dog which I think is the best I've had in Chicago. It's just perfect. Beyond that we always get a few more, but our choices depend on how our fancy is tickled that particular day. This last time I tried the portobello mushroom and swiss cheese pork dog with duck fat sauteed mushrooms and duck cracklings. It was DAMN good. Not foie gras dog good, but nearing it. I'd come with some friends and get a whole bunch of different dogs. Go nuts, it's not that expensive at all.

They are quite organized and that is a plus when a place is both popular and small. The server brought our order over very quickly. We were a party of three and we ordered 4 hot dogs and 1 order of duck fat fries to share. If you are getting specialty dogs (and of course you are) be careful not to over order. Some of these items are very rich. We chose The Dog (the classic Chicago-style hot dog), the Smoked Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and Aged Iberico Cheese, the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Spicy Cajun Remoulade and Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese, and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. The Linguica was our hands-down favorite. We all agreed that the Foie Gras was just too rich. I was glad to only have to eat a third of that dog. An entire one would have given me agita.

We visited on a cold, windy February Saturday and even though we got in line 15 minutes after it opened, it was still an hour wait.  And did I mention it was cold?  But once we got inside the doors and the delicious odor hit our nose holes, all I can say is Wow.  The encased meats (as they prefer to be called) range in price from about $3-4 for the ""standard"" fare to 8-10 for their weekly specials.  And while the original Chicago Style dog (with everything of course) is top notch, the money is in the specials. As the name weekly specials implies, the specials change weekly.  But no matter what is on the list, I'd suggest focusing on those.  You'll have a little time to browse the menu once you wait in line inside the restaurant, but it's not a bad idea to prepare by checking out the menu online.  Keep an eye out for the game of the week under the jackalope. While there, my group of friends sampled rattlesnake, yak, jalapeño duck, kangaroo, and their 40-sausage chili.  The chili was rich and meaty with a great smoky taste.  Highly recommended.  Each special sausage has it's distinct characteristics and it's hard to go wrong with any of them.  They were all good, but the favorite of all the types we got was the rattlesnake.   As an added bonus, on Fridays and Saturdays, they serve their famous Duck Fat fries.  These were great tasting, but came out a bit limp and I would've preferred them a crispier.  But still good enough to get them again.  The order is big enough to share between a few people.

French fries were natural cut, great.  Cheese fries would be excessive as there's a good amount of cheese on many of the specialty hot dogs. Cash only.  Closed Sunday and closes at 4pm.

I mean I really love sausage more than the average person (I blame my German heritage for that) but these are the best sausages I have ever had. When I went I ordered the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri, Crispy Fried Onions and Carrigaline Farmhouse Cheese and I ordered this Portuguese linguica sausage with some kind of smoky cheese on top. The ribeye steak sausage was very good but the Portuguese linguica sausage. OH. MY. GOD. I need a new paragraph just to describe this sausage. I'm not sure if it was the sausage itself that was so good or the combination of it with that smoky cheese but this was seriously the best encased meat meal I have ever experienced. I dream of this sausage. And Hot Doug's has now become my benchmark for all things sausage-related. I also tried the duck fat fries and thought they tasted like nothing special. Someone I was with bought the normal fries so we could compare and, yes, you can taste a difference but nothing substantial. I would recommend just getting sausages and no fries.

2012-01-24,5.0,"The day after Alinea, Hot Doug's assured me that my palate had not been ruined by its brief frolic with culinary heroin.  Sure, foie gras hot dogs are not quite the Food of the People, but hey, that was my least favorite dog.  I'm still cool, guys.  I know hot dogs only cost like $20 or whatever. We meant to line up at 10:30, but we got out of bed about three hours too late.  Lucky for us, the shit weather kept the line reasonable, and we only waited about 20 minutes before placing our orders.  Half of that time was spent waiting inside. I loved the cheery interior, which was decked out in primary colors and hot dog kitsch.  I enjoyed scanning the collection of hot dog memorabilia, and I chuckled at the historical hot dog timeline occupying a large portion of the main wall.   Service was friendly and fast, and due to a well asserted rule that you could only sit after ordering, seating was easy to come by.  Our food came out quickly and we were out the door soon after. The dogs were delicious.  Michael K. and I shared four, and split an order of duck fat fries with Janice K.  Mike and I agreed that the top dog was the chardonnay and jalapeño rattlesnake sausage with berry-currant mustard cream and trugole cheese.  I've had two rattlesnake hot dogs in my life, and so far it looks like I love those disgusting animals as long as they're well encased.  The sausage here was snappy and ideally firm, and it brought a nice balanced heat.  The sauce was perfect, and I loved the shredded cheese, which seemed to melt into it with each bite.  Where chardonnay swayed us, sauternes fell short.  The foie gras and sauternes duck sausage came with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel, and despite and because of the overload of fancypants ingredients, the dog ended up falling flatter than its siblings.  The sausage was overwhelmed by the cold rich cream of several discs of foie gras, and though the truffle aioli helped ground the flavor, it also didn't help cut much fat.  The dog didn't taste bad - in fact for a bite or two, it was quite good - but I wouldn't order it again.  We had one more dog with elaborate trimmings in the Uber garlic pork sausage with smoked gouda, roasted garlic cloves, and smoky bacon sauce.  This was a success, with a juicy link and, well, garlic and bacon and smoky melting gouda on top.  Though the special dogs were delicious fun, we couldn't leave without getting the basic Dog - Chicago-style with mustard, caramelized onions, relish, tomatoes, pickle, and celery salt.  This was cheap and fantastic, and just as interesting as its more unusual cousins.  I'm not used to having pickles right on my hot dogs, but the phallic layers do go together well.  As we wolfed down our dogs, we also dug into the duck fat fries.  They were nice, well seasoned and golden-brown, if not quite the reason to stand in line. When we left after 3PM, the line looked about the same as when we arrived.  Out the door at all hours, I suppose, even in the bitterest cold.  I can see why.  Hot Doug's is a fun restaurant with an approachable price point, and most spots that fit that description don't offer delicious delicious sausages.  Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll try and tack myself onto the end of that line.",0.9993,0.729,0.239,0.032,0.6075644841269842

The specialty dogs may be a bit pricey at $7-9 each, but you can always opt for a good old fashioned hot dog or sausage ranging from $2-4. Duck fat fries are only available Friday and Saturday, but their normal fresh cut fries are piping hot with potato-ey goodness.   You'd would think that since Hot Dougs has such a great food reputation and long lines to back it up that the staff would be less than pleasant, but that's far from the case here. Doug himself will be there to greet you at the counter with a smile and friendly suggestions. You can tell he loves what he's doing and he loves sharing his ideas with his Chicagoans.  The personality you see featured on food shows will be the same guy you meet in person. Hot Dougs is a Chicago gem and worth a wait in line. They are to encased meats what peanut butter is to jelly. They just work. So if you find yourself with a  day off, get up early and head out to Hot Dougs. In fact if you're a Chicagoan,  put this on your bucket list.",0.9977,0.772,0.209,0.019,0.5847412425537426

Steve Swisher: A solid classic Chicago style-esque dog Lamb/Pork Sausage: A lamb-pork sausage with the artichoke-lemon pesto really does make it taste like a gyro if not for the Haloumi cheese. These two dogs were good, though wouldn't be worth the half hour wait (much less the 45 minute wait on a day when the weather isn't cold and sprinkly). But hold your judgement until you hear about the next two dogs -  Mountain Man Sausage: Probably the most awesome sausage filling ever created - Elk, Antelope, Buffalo and Venison all in one tube.

As we walked up, there were about 8 guys already in line ~20 minutes before opening. Our wait went by fairly quickly, and we were soon inside...to wait yet again, but this time to order. There's quite a few choices on the menu!  What I got:  The Cheesy Atomic: Spicy jack cheese, stuffed pork sausage with spicy passion fruit mayo and habanero jack cheese. My favorite - great flavor, and the right amount of heat from the various peppers thrown in the cheese and mayo. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage: with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (fancy salt). I found the foie gras on the duck sausage to be there more for texture than flavor, and the sausage itself was fairly bland. That's to be expected for duck I suppose, given my past experience with duck sausage.  I think this would greatly benefit if Doug were to saute the foie gras a bit to warm it up. Norm Crosby: a hot dog with beef, pork, and garlic, served Chicago style. Didn't really notice much of a difference between this and a normal hot dog given all of the condiments thrown on top.  Duck Fat Fries: only served on Fridays & Saturdays. Delicious. Spectacular! Some of the best fries I've had. Overall, I'm happy with the food I got at Hot Doug's, and I know my friend is in love with the place and keeps going back any chance he gets.

I'm not sure what began my undying affection for encased meats, but Hot Doug's takes my love to some sort of impossible perversion that makes me want to go back again and again. The last time I was there with my lady we tried 4 dogs, the foie gras (insanely good,) a chicken chorizo topped with Mole, a rattlesnake dog with a prickley pear raita (kind of tasted like a gyro, but better) and a lamb sausage with harissa, which was pretty good as well. My only issue with Doug's is that its seemingly impossible to choose what to get because, in addition to they're evderyday menu, they have specialty dogs that all sound awesome. If you show up at the right time, the line is almost non-existant, but if you assume that by showing up at 1 on a saturday that there'll be no line, you'll be sorely mistaken.",0.9733,0.753,0.185,0.062,0.6939594356261024
2011-12-08,4.0,"Ordered the foie gras and duck sausage dog. Was it as good as everyone says? In this world of hungry children and failing economies and corrupt governors, did this specialty dog warrant the $9 price tag, the commute, and the lines? Hm... I don't know... I don't think so. Firstly, I will say it's very very good. It was definitely duck flavored and good combination of flavors and I don't regret at all coming here and trying it once. However here were a few thoughts I couldn't help thinking: 1. Was this the best hotdog I ever had? Maybe but I can't say for sure because this is a unique specialty dog. So it didn't really fix my traditional hotdog crave nor did it fix my foie gras crave (I like mine grilled).  2. Was it worth $9 and perhaps a wait? It was definitely worth $7 and a short wait. And definitely $5 (I am dreaming obviously) and an hour wait (at that price I would order 2 for sure).  3. It's hard for me to give any place 5 stars that didn't blow my mind, or affordable enough for me to visit regularly.  4. Hm, smaller than I imagined... (that's what she said) Take friends and family? Sure. Try at least once? Totally. Regular spot? I don't think so. Still, very very very good.",0.9836,0.804,0.163,0.033,0.5251435897435897

2011-12-06,4.0,"You know amazingly enough, growing up I wasn't really a big fan of sausages or hot dogs.  Then a decade ago I had a REAL sausage from a butcher shop and my entire opinion changed.  Actually, now I love a good hot dog and/or sausage. When a friend of mine came to visit, we decided to try and get into Hot Doug's.  We have seen it on a few TV shows and written up a few places, so luckily we knew to arrive kind of early.  It was a Friday too, so luckily the line wasn't as long as on say, oh a Saturday. Waited outside for maybe 30-35 minutes before giving my order to the man himself, Doug.  I ordered a Foie Gras Dog, a standard Chicago Dog, and a Kiera Knightly.  I joked with Doug for awhile that I'd order ketchup on my Foie Gras Dog.  He was a good sport, and no I would never think about doing that.  Anyway, I really don't remember what my friend ordered to be honest with you, but that doesn't even matter, because we got duck fat fries too. The Foie Gras Dog had a very, very healthy (uh, but not really because Foie Gras is terrible for you) portion on top for only $9.  I bet there was $20 worth of Foie on here so what a great deal!  The dog itself was good, but I was not expecting it to be as rich as it was.  All in all it was good, not ""I am having an epiphany amazing,"" but yeah I would get it again. The standard Chicago Dog was also good, but nothing amazing and the same for the Kiera Knightly.  The fries were really good, but they did not taste as good as they cooled down.  Eat them fast!  Still good cold though. The other dogs do look awesome, and everytime I've tried to get back to Hot Doug's, the line has been extremely long and I've been hung over. A good combination? No.  I'm not going to wait in line for 90 minutes hung over. 4 stars for now, until I go back and have more.  It was really good, but didn't blow me away.  I recommend it too.  I would say to come early, but if I do, everyone is going to come early. So come early, and maybe not on a Friday or Saturday.  Hmm, but then again, you wouldn't be able to have those great duck fat fries would you?",0.9975,0.765,0.201,0.033,0.5185185185185187

We waited about an hour or more in line, but it was a nice day and we got to catch up. We knew we'd be waiting awhile... but finally we arrived inside! I decided to go with a normal hot dog and a specialty, plus duck fat fries. We sat outside in the alley on the side since they have outdoor seating. Don't get me wrong, the food is great. But I think it's more of an ordeal than it's worth to enjoy the tasty hot dogs. Besides being extremely far from my place (I feel like you need a car) and the extremely long line, I might have had too high of expectations. Maybe I just don't really like hot dogs?

2011-11-28,4.0,"Doug is some sort of strange sausage wizard. He is the Gandalf of hot dogs. I've never seen so much innovation in the realm of encased meats. Because I love to wake up early and punish myself, I ended up taking a cab from the loop to Hot Doug's and was lucky enough to be first in line. After I sat down to wait for my food, a nice man who works for the establishment interviewed me about how and why I ended up there. He gave me a coupon which I used to purchase my 3rd helping of encased meat(therefore stuffing my gourd way more than needed). So, word to the wise - if you are first in line, you might get some free stuff. Anyhow, I was a little disappointed by the foie gras and duck sausage. The foie gras mousse on top was overwhelmingly thick(which I expected) but apart from being extraordinarily rich, I didn't feel it had much flavor. I cannot say the same about the rattlesnake sausage, which really impressed me. There's something about deadly animal meat that makes it all the more succulent. It was topped with something I can't remember but it was kinda sweet and all delicious. I also had a shrimp sausage of some sort and it was really good. Honestly, the damn menu here changes so much that it is probably pointless to look at reviews for specific suggestions.

I've had all of the special hotdogs and can vouch for all of them!

After Doug took my order, I was surprised at how easy it was to procure a place to sit considering how incredibly busy it was.  The food was brought out promptly, and the Chicago dog was as good as it gets, but the real heroes are the Specials.  The Chipotle Buffalo sausage with gouda cheese was certainly unique, and I heartily enjoyed every bite.

It seems to be more about bringing gourmet food to the average person who can't afford a $150 four-course meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant than just making the maximum profit possible.

2011-09-27,5.0,"Dear Hot Doug's, First off i want to apologize, Yelp will only allow me to give you up to 5 stars.. but if it was up to me, i will give you infinity. When my friends and i planned out our vacation to Chicago, we knew we had to make room for this place even if it meant standing in line for hours.  We got lucky because we came here on a Monday morning at exactly 10:29 a.m. and there are about 10 people in line already. The owner Doug greeted us with a smile and took our orders.  We didn't have to wait too long for our orders.  Here's what we ordered  1) The Paul Kelly-Bratwurst soaked in beer - This was ok,I feel there could have been more flavor to this but  there wasn't much to it. i could kind of taste the beer but my friends can't. But i love the cheese. they put the brie and goat cheese on it.   2) The Rabbit- it was my first time having rabbit and it didn't taste like chicken as i expected.. It was a little heavy .. i didn't really like this one 3) the Cheesy atomic- This was one was very good, even if it was super spicy.. i ended up downing almost to cups of coke because it was really hot.  The best part about this one is the passion fruit sauce they put in it.. it was so tasty, a perfect combo of spicy and sweetness 4) Curry Pork Sausage- this one was pretty good too, it wasn't as spicy as the cheesy atomic. but it still gave the perfect kick 5) cheese fries-  i love their fries,, it tasted super fresh, but it's hard to eat it when you want to save room for their hot dogs.  i love fries with the skin on it!  and last but no least 6) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage.  all i can say is that this just totally melts when you take a bite. This is the type of food you don't want to share. You take your first bite and the next thing you know is that you are done.  You can probably finish this in one minute or less. It's that good. i Highly suggest getting more than one, because you will crave for it the second you are done.  i love this one so much.. i kept on thinking about it even in my dreams.   the next time i come back to chicago, i will need to try their duck fries..i need to find out what all the craze is about!",0.9961,0.755,0.181,0.064,0.5289716312056739

2011-09-26,3.0,"Not sure why this place has so much hype & such a long line.  It's good, but it's also just a hotdog...i didn't think it tasted any more spectacular than any other specialized hot dog joint. Not worth standing in line for 30-45 minutes (random Monday). Ordered 2 hotdogs for myself (1 special & 1 regular chicago-style dog): 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($9): 2 stars. This sounded good...so good that almost the entire group ordered this as one of the two dogs to eat.  I was not a fan, & neither was the rest of my group.  It was way too rich (& I normally like rich).  But I felt like it wasn't that flavorful..just creamy, fatty, & slightly bland. 2) Chicago-Style Hot Dog ($2): 4 stars.  I liked this $2 dog better than my $9 special dog.  I had it with ""everything"" topping & dog deep fried & grilled. ""Simple"", yet flavorful & tasty...can't really go wrong w/ your typical dog. 3) Had a bite of my friend's rattlesnake dog (daily special)...ok this ""dog"" was AMAZING (5 stars for this one).  It was topped with dried fried onions & was bursting w/ flavor.  I couldn't tell it was rattlesnake over any other meat, b/c it tasted just like any other hot dog, but it was the toppings and sauces that made the delish flavor.  ORDER this if it's available. Sides: Unfortunately, no duck-fat fries on week days.  We ordered an order of regular fries to share.  They were good, but nothing special.  Just your typical thick-cut steak fries.",0.9945,0.773,0.199,0.028,0.5549374236874238

Further, Doug is unbelievably nice.  Talk about a people person.  The last thing any establishment needs after 99.9% of their clientele is waiting outside in line for a minimum of 40 minutes is an a$$hole with a poor attitude greeting you from behind a counter. An a$$hole Doug is not. In fact, his entire staff is nothing but friendly.  Everyone is willing to answer questions and help you out. The food, oy, the food...just...I mean...there really are no words.  One of the most creative menus in existence, in my opinion, can be found at Hot Doug's. Yes, there are your standards chardogs and corn dogs, etc, but the ""specials'...man, they are special. Some personal past favorites of mine include (but are not limited to) the: -Apple and Cinnamon Pork Sausage with Curry-Honey Mustard and Brie-Blue Cheese -Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Goat Cheese -Curry Pork Sausage with Curry Mayonnaise and Smoked Blue Cheese drizzled with honey and last but (certainly) not least -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie-Gras Mousse, and Fleur de Sel.

My girlfriend gives me a look, you know that look, the ""we're seriously going to wait 45 minutes for a hot dog?"" look. The line was about 2 hours long by the time Hot Dougs opened at 10:30. We were a little bit behind where the red bricks started and it took us about 45 minutes to get to the counter. 15 minutes into the wait, rain. Fuck.

We finally got into the restaurant, right before it started heavily pouring. One thing that really surprised me, there were dudes still waiting outside. There was still a long line. People must really like these hot dogs.  And it was very fortunately for my relationship that these hot dogs were the best damn dogs I've ever eaten.  Foie Gras dog - The heaviest, tastiest thing I don't think I can ever eat again for the sake of my health. Shitake dog - My favorite. FOrgot what exactly was in there, but it was a damn good dog. The duck fat fries are also a must have. Just a different taste to it. Delicious. I definitely recommend showing up way early, because I don't think I would have had the same great experience if I had to wait 2+ hours for this.

Everything that I've ever had has been great.The regular fries are also good. A few days a week they have fries cooked in duck fat. The corn dogs are also great.  I was once told that you can get a regular hot dog, but why wait in such a long line for that? Doug greets each customer at the counter with a friendly manner and spend as much time as needed helping you decide to what to order. The bad news is that the restaurant is only open 10:30 -4 Mon-Sat and closes for anything resembling a holiday. The line is absurdly long and an hour wait would not be usual.

For reference, the line started along the sidewalk just on the other side of the alley behind the restaurant.  An enterprising ice cream truck sold frozen treats and $1 bottles of water to the waiting crowd.  It really wasn't a ton of people, but the line just moved so slowly.  When I finally did get to order, I was still perplexed why the wait was so long--our group of five got their food in less than 5 minutes after ordering and while all the tables were taken, there were still a number of outward facing seats along the window.  On top of that, there was an outdoor eating area available that I didn't visit. As for the food, the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel is extraordinary.  The foie gras and truffle aioli combine to make every bite rich, creamy, and memorable.  The other two items I had were just so-so:  The Corn Dog is exactly what you would expect and not that different than what you would get at a ballpark or a fair.  The Duck Fat Fries were...not all what they are quacked up to be.  I really didn't experience any extra ""oomph"" from the fact that these were fried in duck fat. To be clear, if the wait were 30 minutes of less, I would bump Hot Doug's up to four stars--the foie gras hot dog was just that good.  But to rate the whole experience--an experience I wouldn't want to go through again--I'll leave Hot Doug's at two stars.",0.9538,0.917,0.067,0.016,0.508080808080808

Cons - With all the anticipation of waiting in line and then the stress of ordering fast because of the long line, there's too many menu options!  - The day we went the hood was broken and they gave us choice: (1) Wait more and take your chances (2) Wait more tomorrow - I was upset because I took a $30 taxi just to be sure I was there super early Conclusion It's like Pink Hot Dog in LA, if you are in the area, you just have to go and try it.  It's like a rite of passage into the city.

2011-09-16,3.0,"So to begin, my friends told me to meet them there at 10am.  I thought, ""Hot dogs at 10 am? Yuck.""  But I knew that this place has a line so I figured maybe we would have to wait 2 hours or something.  Well, they open at 10:30 am and one of our friends got there at 9:30 to be the first person in the line.  An hour later the line was a block long and the people at the end surely would wait another hour before they ordered.  So, we did eat our sausages at 10:30am.   Anyways, the menu changes daily.  They have a list of their basic sausages which you can get anytime with the typical Chicago hot dog style condiments.  Then their specialty items vary every day.  We got the following: Cheese-Stuffed Chicken Chorizo with Mole a la Carlos and Queso Asadero; The Brigitte Bardot- Andouille Sausage: Mighty, mighty, mighty hot!; The Mountain Man Sausage (a damn tasty combination of Elk, Antelope, Buffalo, Venison and Caribou) with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mayonnaise and Tetilla Cheese and duck fat fries. Surprisingly, the Mountain Man was my favorite.  The meat was good, not like shady hot dog meat.  The Chicken Chorizo was also good.  The Andouille Sausage, one of the regular sausages, was not very good, and not spicy either.  I really enjoyed the other two.  Their concept is that you can take three distinct ingredients and flavors and put them together in interesting, delicious combinations.  The fries were ok, nothing too exciting.   Despite how much it seemed like we ate, and the random assortment, it was less than totally satisfying, although the flavors were yummy.  I would say that this was a fun place to try, but I wouldn't necessarily go back, unless I wanted to wait in line for an hour to eat sausage at 10:30am.",0.9522,0.871,0.101,0.028,0.5346756519833442

Considering this place is all about the gourmet, a Toffutti branded vegan sausage would have been legit. Grill that up a little and vegetarians would have a lot more to talk about.  Not that this place is catering towards people of my persuasion, but it makes the experience better when you're trying to oblige your meat eater friends.  Everyone that works at Hot Doug's is great. Super friendly, relaxed atmosphere, so that makes up for the lackluster vegetarian fare.

The dude makes like a bazillion dollars(yes, that much, I checked) selling delicious specialty ""encased meats"" to the masses.....and masses.... and masses. Yet he is still super down to Earth. He shows up everyday and takes everyone's order. You would think doing that 6 days a week to probably 176,892 people a day would make you cranky, but no, he was honestly the nicest guy ever.  I've never meat an encased meat I didn't like, and that includes Hot Dougs.  We showed up about 145 on a Friday afternoon and the line took about an hour. It was like a Disneyland line though, not like you have to go to the bathroom at half-time at a football game line. It went quickly! Since we were all starving, we decided to all order 2 dogs each, and a couple orders of the infamous duck fat fries. I thought the duck fat fries were good, but not really anything special. I didn't really taste any sort of difference that made them better. They tasted different, no better, no worse. Just.... different. My dad thought they tasted like regular fries, so anytime after that we had fries he would say they tasted like Duck Fat Fries. (Pretty much, what I am saying is if you can't make it on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be ok).  I had the ""Bacon Cheeseburger Beef Sausage with Coca-Cola BBQ Sauce and Maple-Smoked Cheddar Cheese"", my dad had the ""The Cheesy Atomic: Damn Spicy Jack Cheese-stuffed Pork Sausage with Spicy Passion Fruit Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese"", my mom had the ""Irish Banger with Dark Beer Mustard and Ardagh Wine Cheese"" and my boyfriend had the ""Apple and Cinnamon Pork Sausage with Curry-Honey Mustard and Brie-Blue Cheese"". We also all got a dog off the regular menu, my parents both had the ""Chicago dog"" with everything, and my boyfriend had the Anna Kendrick with everything. I tried the Paul Kelly with grilled onions and mustard(cuz I am weird, and don't like pretty much anything on a Chicago Dog).  All of the dogs were super good. I loved my bacon cheeseburger dog. The cheesy atomic was seriously atomic, my dad was crying and sweating afterward. I had a bite, and I loved that I could feel the progression of heat. I totally couldn't eat a whole one though. I really don't think you could go wrong with any of the dogs though, they are all super interesting, and you could tell a lot of thought was put into making it different, but still delicious.

2011-09-10,5.0,"On our recent trip, we waited two hours to eat at Hot Doug's.  Knowing that you are going to wait in line ahead of time helps.  It's part of the experience and is pretty much inevitable.  Either accept it or move on.   Is it worth it?  Hell yeah.  Where else are you going to get sausages like these?  Nowhere.  In my opinion, it's a must do at least once when in Chicago. Once you get inside, you will be helped by Doug himself who is very cool.  And when you get inside, it will make sense as to why he has you wait outside for so long.  It's not very big inside.  So the good news is once you're in and you've ordered, there's always a place for you to sit and you get your food in about 5-10 minutes.  There's a method to his madness. Personally, my focus is on the specials.  I'm sure everything on the regular menu is great but what sets this place apart are the crazy concoctions he dreams up.  We had: 1. Saucisse de Toulouse with Dijon Goat Butter, Pate de Campagne and Creme de Brie Cheese.  Amazing!  Our favorite of the day.   2. Taco pork sausage with green chili mayo and queso asadero.  My boyfriend did not like it but I did.  It wasn't as original as some of the other selections but it was quite tasty.  I did have to take off some of the cheese though. 3. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel.  This was the boyfriend's pick and he really liked it although he preferred #1.   We also had the duck fat fries and this might be totally sacrilegious to say but I don't get their notoriety.  Neither does my boyfriend.  They taste a little better than regular fries but they did not make the earth move or the sun shine a little brighter or even make me swoon a little.  So next time I'm in town I might hit up Hot Doug's when they are not available and maybe wait 15 minutes less in line.   Personally, I didn't find it difficult to get here by public transportation.  We took the blue line to California and then took the 52 bus which drops you off right in front.   Given that the bus drivers in Chicago think they are starring in their own private version of Speed, we got there in like 10 minutes from the train station.  There isn't much else around here though which is a bummer unless you count Kuma's Corner.  And if you can eat at both in one outing, you need to be calling Adam Richman.",0.9872,0.864,0.108,0.029,0.5083426434676435

Granted that I had to wait more then 2 hours to get a taste of their well known dogs, I would have to say it is something to have to come to at least once in your lifetime.  Luckily, I came with a group so hat we were able to taste a number of them. (Because to be frank, I don't know if I'd want to stand in this line again.) - fois gras and sauternes duck sausage: a must! It's my favorite dog here. There was a certain degree of flavor that permeated through each bite. For only $9, it's quite the deal if you ask me.   - the special of the day: lamb & beef gyro sausage: This was one of the top 3 ones I've tried. I'm a huge fan of gyros so I absolutely loved this one.   - smoked yak sausage (with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and smoked gouda cheese): one of my favorites.  It was very flavorful and the gouda was just icing. - bacon sausage: i thought this one was not as flavorful as the others and the creme was overwhelming.  - reg chicago hotdog: it was good but lacked the taste explosion as some of the other gourmet ones.  There were toppings that made it taste fresh but it was difficult to taste all the toppings in each bite.  They simply overwhelmed it. -duck fat fries: a must! Unforunately, they only sell these on certain days (Fri & Sat), so get them if you happen to be there on the days they are served.   The line is ridicously long and tables are first come first serve.  It's not the most ideal restaurant arrangement, but it's definitely worth giving it a try.  I hear it's only an hour wait if you stand in line at 11am.  The rule here is ""the earlier the better.""",0.972,0.849,0.127,0.025,0.6263655462184875

Alright here's what we had and what I thought about them.  I was starving too: The ""Dog"" - Classic Chicago hotdog with all of the trimmings: 2 rating This was like any hotdog that you would get at a baseball game.   Tasted pretty homemade-ish with the relish, mustard, and pickle.  I thought it was aight. Gourmet Hotdogs Bacon Sausage - 4 rating Dude... this was a super heart attack hotdog.  It was SO RICH.  The sausage made of bacon AND creme fraiche which is very rich on it's own.  I mean it was slathered in the creme fraiche.   1st bite was WHOA... dannng so good bc it was exploding in flavor. 2nd bite was getting too rich. 3rd bite I felt a little sick. Advice: SHARE this one The Norm - 5 rating This was DELICIOUS.  It was very simple but the sausage was so flavorful with garlic and other yumminess.  This was the best hotdog I had here and a MUST order. Foie gras & duck hotdog - 4 rating Even though it had slabs of foie gras in it the duck was much more over powering in taste.  Foie gras + duck = sweetness.  It was pretty decadent and you would need a pretty big bite of foie gras to get a nice taste of it.  At moments I had to close my eyes to concentrate on the foie.  Nonetheless this is a must try and I am craving for one right now. Despite of the very long 2 hour wait just for hotdogs it's pretty bomb here.  Would I wait here again for 2 hours.  No.  Maybe 30 min but tha'ts bc I can officially say I've had this already.

Yeah, I know there are lots of places in Chicago where you can get a pretty good red hot, but Doug's has just the right amount of char on it - you can really taste the grill. And his buns are super soft and tasty (hey man, the hot dog buns, get your mind out of the gutter!). Not to mention that, but Doug himself is awesome. He really moves the line through (and there is a line, so don't be thinking you're gonna get your dog after a 5 or even 10 minute wait) without being a total tool, and makes the service there super personal. I even tried to speed up my ordering process for him because the line behind me was long and it was close to closing time, but I think it's really hard to get past Doug without him engaging you in a little chit-chat. So I got the regular old red hot and the legendary foie gras dog. I've already mentioned the red hot, so now let's talk about this foie gras dealie. I don't know about the calorie count - frankly I don't care. I'm sure my pant size went up exponentially with each bite I took (and maybe my serum cholesterol level, too). I think I may have blacked out a little somewhere in the middle. It's kind of like a drug. I swear, you can taste every single flavor that goes into that puppy. The truffle sauce is light and not overpowering (when I make stuff with truffle oil, I just like to dump it in, but not everyone likes that, and then all you can taste is the truffle flavor - this was not that), you can taste the tang of the sauterne in the duck sausage, and I just don't know what to say about the foie gras. It's like meat butter, right? So good. One Saturday when I've got a good 2 hours to spare I'll head down there and dive into the duck fat fries - I don't know how that can be wrong. A couple of warnings: you will have to wait in line here. It doesn't matter what time you go or what day of the week. There will be a line, and it will take you at least 30 minutes from the time you get there till the time you get your food - plan on anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours for the whole process to go down. Hot Doug's closes at 4, so don't get there at 3.50 and then be upset because you couldn't get in. That outside door locks at 4, and whoever's still outside when it locks stays outside.

Once I spied the menu, I began to understand what the fuss is all about.  To say that this restaurant serves hot dogs, is to say that Gucci sells t-shirts.  The menu descriptions alone transcend ""hot dog place"".  A great deal of inventiveness and culinary care is taken in creating the sausages from often unusual meats (antelope?  quail?) and pairing them with toppings that will blow your gastrophiliac mind.  Each dog is huge.  One could easily be a meal with fries, but me and my hsuband, our reason effectively blocked by the food equivalent of titties shaking in your face, ordered 5 dogs and split them between us.  We did not eat for the rest of the day.  The dog that sticks out most in my mind, and that begs me to return despite having since adopted veganism, was the one topped with creamy, delicious coins of foie gras.  Heaven.  We also split an order of cheese fries, because fitting into pants is for nerds.. The best order of cheese fries I've ever eaten, this coming from someone who hates soggy cheese fries. The fires are spiced and the cheese... well, it's not Velveeta, that's for sure. Something a bit nicer.  Too bad Monday is not duck fat fry day (gotta get down on duck fat fry day).  I really wanted to try them, so I know there is a round of vegan turncoat-ism in my future.

The fries are fresh cut and very good, but nothing mind blowing. The 2 hot dogs i got where the regular chicago dog and the duck sausage truffle foe grais fancy dog so first i want to comment on the regular chicago dog. Being from New York, I bow down to the Chicago dog, way better than what New York has to offer. Now, New York still kicks your ass in pizza...sorry but the thick crust deep dish thing aint working. But when I first had the Chicago hot dog I was like ""why didnt we think of that? Just sauerkraut and mustard is trash now! i can never go back!"" For a chicago dog though, you can get one in many places in Chicago. Not worth the 1/2hr wait in line. Now, the fancy duck sausage/foie gras-y hot dog? That was good. The flavors really worked together and it didnt come off as gimicky but rather as a well thought out culinary creation. It was very good and worth the $9 it cost. I am glad to have the experience. So i give this place a thumbs up. If you have an iphone and you don't mind waiting in one place for long periods of time, check it out.

""...do a Groupon."" Doug just does it his way, and it's always been his way.  I do not want to intimate that, with the exception of the ""Groupon"" thing, any of the above observations are akin to soul-selling, but so many businesses have lost their way when attempting to grow and change.  Hot Doug's has not made any of those changes hence, there has been no degradation.

They have daily specials of dogs so check online for a list of them, I'd say while you wait in line. We ordered 12 dogs , 2 for each of us 6 people.  The popular ones I've listed are as follows: -Hot Doug's B.L.T.-good toppings, fresh so I would get it again! This was a popular dog in our group. -Thai Chicken Sausage with Sriracha Mustard, Sesame-Seaweed Salad and Duck Cracklings-it was OK if you REALLY like Spicy Asian flavors.  -Philly Cheesesteak Sausage with Cream Cheese Mustard, Caramelized Onions and Smoked Provolone Cheese-I liked the flavors, onions chopped into little bits.   -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel-The most expensive dog on the menu $9 bucks, but it was pretty good if you like the creamy texture of the foie gras. -Corn Dog-eh, it's a corn dog.  Anything fried is good, LOL! If you get drinks, just order a small as it's free refills if you dine in. And don't forget the DUCK FAT FRIES!  One order is good enough to share with two people unless you LOVE ""DUCK FAT FRIES"" or bag the rest for later munchies!  It's crispy, regular size length fries:)  The duck flavors gets lost if you start putting Ketchup on it so alternate plain and with ketchup...   If you go on their website,  hotdougs.com/default.htm .  You can even listen to their theme song called ""The Theme From Hot Doug's"" And yes they sell T-shirts there too. Over all, I'd say go for the experience and try the duck fat friend (Fri-Sat only!)!  This way next time you see it on TV you can brag to your friends/family and say yeah I've been there:)",0.9975,0.828,0.16,0.012,0.5810717556253271

I didn't realize that you can get so creative with sausages.  The Selma Hyeck dog had some large lumps of fat, so there were two bites that weren't all that enjoyable, but everything else was just amazing.  You can taste the really cool meat combinations in each hot dog.  Service was sooo friendly and warm as well.  While I probably won't go regularly because the wait is a killer, it's worth it to go at least once to try and also again if you have out-of-towners visiting and want to show them amazing dogs and sausages.",0.9761,0.734,0.217,0.049,0.5648580586080587

2011-07-19,5.0,"From the looks of things on this Yelp page, the last thing Hot Doug's needs is another exemplary review. Well, I just can't help myself. My kind words may be but a drop in the massive ocean of praise that Hot Doug's affords, but I really love the sound of my own voice and, perhaps even more so, I loved my experience at Hot Doug's. The wife and I were on a long weekend trip to Chicago, and when she asked me what I wanted to do I thought of two things: a game at Wrigley, and Hot Doug's. I had never known anyone to eat there, but the reverberations of their greatness had echoed all the way out to my neck of the woods through various foodie avenues. Hot Doug's was a destination to be visited, and it was at the top of my list.  Access is a bit of an issue, especially for out of towners without a rental car (and a starting point in Oak Park, thanks Frank Lloyd Wright), but a $40 cab ride dropped us off in front of Hot Doug's, to take our place at the end of the massive line at 3:30 on a sweltering afternoon. We took a leap of faith that they'd serve everyone in line even once 4 came (they will, so don't worry) and waited. We saw an ambulance come and tend to one of our encased meat brethren that succumbed to dehydration, prompting the staff to (very, very kindly) water us from the garden hose so that we wouldn' t pass out, too. We even had some ice cream while we waited thanks to the very industrious Good Humor man that pulled up alongside the line (Good Humor Toasted Almond... YES!) After about an hour and a half we had made it into the doors and were face to face with Doug himself.  But first you have to contend with the menu. You've got the basics: beef dog, bratwurst, polish sausage, italian sausage, andouille, Thuringer (garlicky and awesome) and so forth. You can get them topped with any variety of things, and that's all well and good. But what really sets Hot Doug's apart are ""today's specials,"" which from my gathering are every day's specials. And good for you, too, since you need to be a part of these things. On to the selections: The Sauternes duck sausage with foie gras gets a lot of pub, as well it should. This is, quite simply one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. I'm not even going to attempt to describe the taste, because I think something akin to opening the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark might happen and burn my face off. Just go there and eat it. Then smuggle another one onto a plane and fly it back to me, please. I took my first bite of my duck sausage to ""White Man in Hammersmith Palais"" by the Clash. It couldn't have been much more perfect, short of having it fed to me by a nude Brooklyn Decker.  I also had the uber garlic pork smoked sausage with roasted garlic, brick cheese, and chipotle dijonnaise. Anything that allows me to eat whole cloves of roasted garlic is ok in my book. And this thing was more than ok. Very nice.  My wife got the Thuringer with giardiniera (spelled that right the first time, and I'm mostly of German descent) which was good. I'd get down on a Thuringer as a go to weekend sausage on a regular basis. She also tried the celebrity dog, a crawfish/smoked pork sausage combo topped with cajun remoulade and goat cheese drizzled with honey. This was another out of this world combination that I didn't see coming. So great.  And, oh yeah, duck fat french fries to go with it. This place is heaven on earth.  The service is fantastic. Even though they're one of the busiest places that I've ever visited Doug could not have been nicer and took time to chat with us when we ordered. Their seating policy of grabbing a seat after you order was also great, because everyone had a place to sit and enjoy their hard earned meal.  You may find yourself in line, sweating of freezing your ass off, wondering if all of this was worth it. I'm here to assure you that it most certainly is, and then some. From now until the time I visit again, or die, whichever comes first, I will think of that duck sausage, and Hot Doug's. Thanks for a truly memorable experience and I hope to visit again soon.",0.9989,0.81,0.159,0.031,0.5343886913739856

This is how good it is, though.  My girlfriend and I went to Hot Doug's on a Thursday.  The line was about an hour and a half long.  We got up to Doug at the counter, and we ordered up five dogs.  If I recall correctly, we ordered the famous Foie Gras Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse, and Fleur de Sel; a quarter-pound veal and pork knockwurst; a lamb and pork Loukaniko with olives and goat cheese; a classic Chicago dog; and a sausage made from smoked crayfish and pork.  It was glorious.  It was so glorious that we went back the next day for more.   The line on the next day was two and a half hours.  That Friday, we were able to get the duck-fat fries, which are only available on Fridays and Saturdays.  At Doug's suggestion we got his truffle aioli as a sauce for our fries.  That time we got two of the foie dogs, a Chicago dog, a corn dog, and IIRC a bratwurst.  It was worth it, for sure.  There was a British visitor, a sailor, who was in the queue with us the second day.  He was incredulous that we would wait in that line two days in a row.  We told him to keep the faith, that it was really that good.  He came up to me and thanked me for encouraging him to wait.  He loved it too! Doug is a great guy too.  He even has told his competitors where to get the same sausages he has.  He has freely shared this knowledge, and it's out there on the internet.  I like that sharing spirit.  I think that's what make him share such great food with his customers.",0.9958,0.806,0.194,0.0,0.43962962962962965

2011-07-12,5.0,"The line was long when I arrived and stretched all the way to the drive way of another business.  I waited in line for an hour and a half and it was definitely worth the wait.  I ordered three Hot Dougs: Turducken, duck sausage topped with truffle aioli & foie gras mousse, and the rattle snake sausage.  Wow, wow, and wow!!  All three were amazing.  The sausages are real meaty and plump in size  so you do not have to worry about leaving there hungry or having to buy more to fill up. I would say to the average eater that two Hot Dougs should be enough.  I consider myself a big eater so when I ordered three, I was only able to finish two and half; which I regrettably left my other half in the taxi cab by accident (still bummed about that).  I never ate rattle snake before so I took a bite of the bottom portion, with out the sauce, and it was not gamey at all; which I do not mind gamey.   It was topped with cheese-stuffed hot pepper and a black garlic rouille sauce and was very delicious. The Turducken was good as well and was the meatiest out of all because it had three different meats in it (turkey, duck, and chicken..there could have been other meats in it as well, I am not sure).   It consist of the Turducken Sausage with smokey bacon sauce, pate de Compagne and brie-blue Cheese. Out of all three Hot Dougs I would have to say the foie gras duck sausage was my favorite only because I am a sucker for foie gras, but the rattlesnake was very close to me saying that it was my favorite.   If your are there on a Friday or Saturday order the fries deep fried in duck fat.  Fries are just fries to me, but something about it being deep fried in duck fat made them really tasty.  The fries are cut skinny so they come out really somewhat crispy, which i really liked.  I would have to say all three were the best hot dogs I have ever ate in my life.  In addition, hands down, this place is THE BEST hot dog joint ever.  I recommend this place to anyone that is a fan of encased meat in a tube.  You never really had a real hot dog until you've gone to Chicago, and you definitely have not had a real dog if you've never been to Hot Dougs.  I am from California and anytime I am in the Chicago area this is a ""must go to"" spot.",0.9925,0.856,0.124,0.02,0.5619614512471656

Two hours later we got to Hot Doug's, and as everyone else has said the line was out the door and down the block. The line only took about 20 minutes.... When we got in Doug was working the counter, and even with his line around the block he took time to give us advise on the menu, and chat with us about his experience to AZ (where we are from).

But stand in line for 1-3 hours? No way.  Today was a lovely summer day and we found ourselves with a little time, so my boyfriend decided we should go to Hot Doug's, because he'd been one of those schmucks who stood in line and said he wanted me to be able to have the experience. We drove by and when he saw the line, he said it'd probably be about an hour. After some debating and realizing this would probably be the last time we could do this for a while, we decided to go for it. Our total time, including eating, took us a little over an hour. I had planned to get only one dog, but he said I'd likely do fine with two. So I chose one from their cheap ($2-3) regular menu and one from their specialty menu ($7-9). We also shared a small order of cheese fries.  We ended up splitting our dogs so we'd get a good sampling, and it was delicious. The foie gras dog was a new experience for me, as I'd never actually had foie gras before. But it was good. The service was excellent. The cashier was very friendly and thorough and patient, which made the experience so much better and worth the wait.  Pros: variety of dogs, reasonable prices, friendly service, delicious food.

OMG the line.  2.5 hours on a friday early afternoon.  I think they have it setup where they will have a line.  The eating area is small. and they don't wait on people until a table is free.  I think they make a line on purpose.  Just to keep the hype.  The dogs are worth the wait.  However... they could make it smaller by setting things up a bit better.,0.9217,0.863,0.137,0.0,0.48989898989898983
2011-06-02,5.0,"This is a top-tier Chicago restaurant, there is no doubt about it.  The lines are ridiculous, but they are that way because the menu is absolutely unique, uncannily delicious, forever metamorphosing, and not very expensive.  Just look at some of the current and past menu items and you will realize that this is a special place: Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Caraway Havarti Cheese Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Chive-Dijon Goat's Butter and Duck Rillettes Rattlesnake Sausage with Smoked Gouda and some sort of nut that I can't remember right now As a seasoned veteran of this place, I know a few secrets which I will share with you now. You're Welcome.    1) If you get there at 10:30-11 on a weekday, the line is relatively short. Like 5-10 minutes short. 2) If it is a weekday and you are ordering more than 25$ worth of food, you can call your order in and pick it up, thus avoiding any line.  Yes, you will receive the ire and burning wrathful stares of the hundred or so people you walk past going straight to the counter and picking up your food, but it's worth it.  25$ is probably more than a normal person's order, but I usually always clear 25$ because I have a problem. 3) The specialty sausages are honestly why you are here, why you waited in line, and why Hot Dougs is Hot Dougs.  The choices rotate frequently, so if you see something delicious sounding, you should get it, it may not be there for long.  I recommend always getting at least 2 sausages, trust me you won't regret it.  Also, if you finally get to the front of the line, order 1 regular hot dog with nothing on it (I've seen this done before), you are doing it wrong! 4) The Duck Fat Fries are also amazing, only offered on Friday and Saturday, which adds significant wait time and why Doug does not allow aforementioned tip #2 of calling in your order.  They are a specialty which I love, bring a book. 5) The tip jar is not just there to look at people. 6) If you get a tattoo of the Hot Doug's logo, you get free Hot Doug's for life.  This is true, ask Doug yourself when you go there. When I think about all the times I've been here and all the fabulous encased meat varieties I've tried, it's really quite impressive that Doug can still come up with new menu items that still satisfy just as much as his previous masterpieces.  Thankfully Doug seems to really love doing this, and I am glad to have known his work.  A true sausage genius!",0.9984,0.745,0.212,0.043,0.5692706332129409

And they are right. 4.  Know that duck fat fries are Friday and Saturday only, and that one order can feed two or more people, depending on your fry needs.  One order is about $3, and is the size of one of those ubiquitous fast food boats everyone uses, nicely loaded. 5.  Make sure you look at  the specials.  They are wickedly good. _________________________________________ I had the foie gras dog, the special elk dog with foie gras sauce, and a straight old school Chicago dog.  Every bite of every dog was delicious.  My husband had the crayfish dog with shrimp remoulade and an Italian sausage.  When I told the owner I wanted a Chicago dog done the right way, he was very informative.  He said the whole reason he started Hot Dougs was because it was hard to get a Chicago dog that was hot and done right.  I'm glad he was inspired.  This place is fantastic!",0.9914,0.773,0.174,0.054,0.668121693121693

We made the forty-five minute pilgrimage by car for the sole purpose of trying Hot Doug's wieners of lore.  This is our tale.... Once upon a time, in a land far, far away (Hyde Park), three souls set forth on a journey to find the fabled Hot Doug's. Over highways and avenues, through concrete jungles and treacherous traffic jams, we rode in search of glorious sausages and duck fat fries. At long last, we arrived. As foretold, the line of sausage seekers began at the end of an iron gate where many a weary traveler wondered aloud if the wieners were worth the wait. Alack, the wait was long.  *""I wish I was eating,"" a young maiden lamented.  But still the line wound its way past pigs and pines to end in a wonderous room filled with psychedelic hues and the sweet aroma of wieners and fries.  But not just any wieners and fries. Lo, it is Hot Doug's and it is good.  (Along the way you will pass a sign instructing you not to choose a table before you've placed your order. Trust this sign.) After all was said and done, our journey lasted an hour and forty-five minutes on account of our obstacles. The great Mr. Hot Doug, himself, greeted us cheerfully and took our order.  We tried the Sally Vega (the corndog to end all corndogs),   the Cheeseburger Sausage (don't knock it till you've tried it),   fries and duck fat fries.  The duck fat fries (which are available ONLY Friday and Saturday) were the stuff of legend. They had a depth of flavor that the regular fries lacked. Their regular fries are awfully good, though.  I chose the Marty Allen (a Thuringer), fried and grilled and topped with ""everything."" My only lament is that I did not show more restraint with the toppings because it was a shame to mask the deliciousness of the dog. As weird as it may seem, I could actually discern the pork from the beef and taste the garlic. And I LOVE garlic so I was quite pleased with Hot Doug's Thuringer.   My fellow travelers tried the Elvis and the Chicago dog and both were satisfied with their wieners of choice. The Chicago dog was declared ""the best"" of all Chicago dogs, and this from one who has sought out the Holy Grail of Chicago style hotdogs.

However, this is one of those times when the hype was true, the expectations were met and the wait well worth it. For some odd reason it's taken me 2 years to come here from when I first heard about Hot Doug's. I had to come on a Friday or Saturday to get the duck fat fries and the foie gras sausage. I driven past a million times when they were open during the weekday but it just didn't feel right. My fiancee and I had some time to kill, it was a warm day with a few raindrops and we were in the neighborhood, so luckily she mentioned Hot Doug's and it just felt right. The line was, as usual, long and to the alley around the corner. We waited in line for about an hour and the the feeling of anticipation definitely came over us, especially when we actually set foot in HDs. We figured out what we wanted and got to the front where Doug (I presume that's the owner's name, lol) graciously took our order. We got the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and fleur de sel, the cognac-infused pheasant sausage with chive-dijon goat's butter and duck rillettes and an order of duck fat fries (an order is def big enough for two).  The foie gras and duck sausage was one of the tastiest things I have ever had in my entire life. Bar none. I've said this in the past but I thoroughly enjoyed this and could have had two. The foie gras mousse was creamy and a perfect topping for the juicy and delicious encased sausage. The truffle aioli was a great touch and whatever fleur de sel is I know I liked it cuz it was somewhere in the tasty thing.  A encased meat like this needs a good bun and the bun HDs used was perfect. The cognac-infused sausage was just as good. Different than the foie gras but so tasty. The chive-dijon butter was perfect and the moist duck rillettes sitting on top of the sausage was a fantastic touch. The duck fat fries were pretty good. You could taste a bit of the duck fat but it wasn't like the fries really stood out from regular fresh cut fries. Very good fries but I was expecting to be blown away. HDs really is like having a four-star meal in an encased meat. The specials are well worth the price. I like the fact that they have regular dogs that you can fry, grill, steam or char along with different kinds of sausages (andoille, thuringer, etc), corn dogs, a veggie dog, etc. There are so many specials that change each week along with the celebrity sausage (named after a celebrity of course) and the game sausage of the week (today was yak sausage with bacon-garlic aioli).  I'm already planning my next trip - I'll not have a problem waiting in line again.",0.9985,0.79,0.191,0.019,0.5264681916722733

The salma hayek was good, but nothing special - I probably wouldn't order it again. I LOVED the Chicago style dog. This was my first time having one and it tasted just like a hot dog with typical hamburger fixings, such as pickles! So so good! Lastly, the foie gras one was DISGUSTING. I'm sorry, but it just was. I still can't believe I paid $9+ for that stupid hot dog because it tasted nastyyyyy - the texture is totally fatty and falls apart greasily in your mouth, just like lard does. For those Asians, the taste of the actual dog is comparable to bright pink Chinese sausage - only it tastes worse. I still want to barf, just thinking about this hot dog. Thankfully, my loving bf ate this hot dog because he didn't wanna waste money and instead, let me eat the tastier dogs :) He's the best! So to reiterate...do NOT order the foie gras hot dog!!!

I guess i should begin by mentioning that on my last trip to chicago nearly 3 years ago, we were on a damn mission to get here to try the infamous hot dogs & duck fat fries that Bourdain raved about on his chicago episode. A long train ride, and a long nearly mile long walk over in the sketchy part of chicago led us to hot dougs. We were so stoked about finally eating here. We didn't do much research though, and came near closing time (around 3:30ish, and they close at 4). So what happens? the worker guy cut the line off right in front of us! I think at the time i was stunned more than anything, bc usually i would be more aggressive and talk my way into getting us in. Needless to say, we were devastated and bummed that we made that long journey, only to be dissapointed!  Well this time around, i was way more prepared! I planned my whole trip around making sure we were able to get here early saturday morning (already anticipating the long line that awaits, since duck fat fries are only served fri & saturdays!). We caught the train to the belmont station and grabbed a taxi this time. Went and stood in the already long line, but was already mentally prepared for this. The weather was overcast and windy. We waited a total of 1 hour and 35 minutes in line, and lucked out as the rain started pouring after about an hour and 20 min. Felt bad for the others who waited in line after us though bc they were literally drenched! the crazy things we do for the love of hot dogs?!?!  When we finally made our way to the front of the line, Doug was at the counter to greet us and to take our order. Chipper and friendly as what others mention. Between the 2 of us (who both don't eat pork or red meat), we opted for the veggie dog (chicago style, and grilled with all the fixings), the duck sausage special with foie gras, the chicken sausage with gouda cheese, and of course the infamous duck fat fries!!!  All were delicious and I particularly enjoyed the foie gras dog and the veggie dog. Very tasty and definitely hit the spot. They gave us an extra order of fries, and so we were a bit overwhelmed with a bunch of food left over. I recommend coming with a group so you can order a bunch of different flavors of encased meat. And would definitely come when you can experience the duck fat fries! One serving is definitely enough to share amongst 2 people.  Yes....finally. My trip was complete.",0.993,0.843,0.124,0.034,0.564374797538063
2011-05-17,5.0,"Best.  Hot Dog.  Place.  EVER.  Seriously.  This is the best hot dog joint I have ever been to.  And like every other kid who grew up in America, of course I'm an expert on hot dogs. I got here a little after 11:00 right before the lunch rush.  Good thing as the line goes out the door to the sidewalk during this rush. Doug's serves about a dozen kinds of hot dogs on their menu.  The 1st one being the original Chi-Town dog with or without everything.  'Everything' being what your normally find on a Chi-Town dog.  $1.75 just for this.  Seriously, I really think this is reasonable.  I mean, come in, get two dogs and a small drink and your lunch is less than $5.  And definitely get only the small drink as it's free re-fills.  Doug himself actually tells me this at the bar when I order.  And on top of this, you can have your dog prepared different ways.  I mean not just the original steamed way, but also grilled, deep fried, and deep fried and then grilled!  A true sign of specialty in hot dogs.   So I'm getting really excited just standing in line looking at all the other dogs (polish, some kind of spicy dog, some kind of spicier dog, corn dog etc.) when I notice a smaller menu on the wall.  Their specialty dogs for the day.  I'm guessing this menu changes a bit week to week.  But holy!  I'm reading this menu and I'm thinking, seriously?  Maybe I just died outside in a car accident and fell into hot dog heaven.  'Cause this menu has got dogs for $7-8 but one of them is duck sausage (in a dog bun) with foie gras.  Another is antelope sausage with a specialty mustard and sweet peppers.   So when I get to the counter I ask Doug (who takes the orders) whether all that meat is 100%.  Meaning is the antelope 100% antelope meat?  He tells me some of them are, some of them aren't.  The antelope is.  I order one.  How about the pheasant?  Is this 100% pheasant?  The pheasant is.  I order one.  How about the duck?  Is this 100% duck?  The duck is.  I order one.  Seriously, I order these three dogs plus an OG Chi-Town dog, grilled.  And Doug is really nice.  I tell him I'm really excited and he laughs and thanks me.  The only problem with this place is that it's CASH only.  Surprising considering how much traffic they get, I'm pretty sure their profits could offset the credit card fees. I grab a small table that fits two and see all sorts of people in this place.  From kids and moms to college kids to me!  My order comes and I chow down.  I mean, these dogs are really, really good.  Because I've never head pheasant, duck nor antelope in sausage form, I almost want to eat these outside of their hot dog form.  To get the raw taste of these.  But I chow it all down.  The specific ingredients served and made with the specialty dogs are designed to enhance the taste of the specific meat.  In some cases it didn't quite work out well (like the pheasant) but in some cases in absolutely did (like the duck).  Still, to get exotic meat like this you really gotta look hard.  And even then there's no success you'll find anything like this.  Outstanding.  A place like this almost makes me want to move to Chicago.",0.9972,0.806,0.156,0.038,0.574390193140193

Then, we shared an alligator ""Game of the Week"", Paul Kelly, Curry Pork, and Antelope. Everything on it but relish. All great and worth another trip back next time we are in town.

Believe it or not, from the fence, it will be an hour wait at least.  Despite the long wait in the cold and drizzle, I was wowed by the simplicity of the hot dogs and the taste in the sausage itself. We ordered the Chicago Style Hot Dog and the Paul Kelly. We decided that we can judge how good the hot dog is by just sticking to the originals and not trying to figure out the specials.  The Hot Dogs had pickles, mustard - the works. The bun was extremely soft and slightly sweet.

The foie gras was AH-mazing. I would never have thought to put the two together, but it works. However, it's super rich and almost half way through, I was done. The Cheesy atomic dog came with a spicy pork sausage topped with cheddar cheese. OMG. This was SO good too. It had a great kick of spice and tasted really rich and creamy too. YUM YUM. I wouldn't really call Hot Doug's a ""hot dog"" place only because when I think of hot dogs, I think of those processed, white, unappetizing Vienna sausages that they slap in a very sad looking bun.

Add that shit up - and it works out to one of those meals I'll remember for the rest of my life.  It's right up there with my donburi in rainy Nagoya.  Mishima beef shabu shabu in Gifu. Japanese curry in Midtown NYC.  Pho in a sweaty basement in Saigon.  Roast goose in Hong Kong. My dad's chow mein in Vancouver. In the words of Bourdain, a 'ephemeral confluence of circumstances.'  Yup, I'm a Bourdain fanboy. Undoubtedly, the best hot dogs -- wait, no -- sausage based meals I've had and probably will ever have.  We had:  - 2 x Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - $9.00  - The Game of the Week: Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Smoked Gouda Cheese - $8.00  - Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce, Raclette Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions - $8.00  - Curry Pork Sausage with Madras Curry Mayonnaise and Cocoa Cardona Cheese - $7.50  - Chicago-Style Hot Dog - fried with all trimmings - $1.75  - 2 x Duck Fat Fries - $3.50 - served Friday and Saturday only That was a lot of food for two people - but given the distance travelled and time spent - we figured it was better to overorder than to fall short of completely gluttony. Doug himself takes the orders.  He and his staff are incredibly funny and friendly despite the long lines and the clear obsession for hot dog perfection.  My buddy tried to order large pops - but he kindly suggested we just get small cups and grab all the refills we wanted. When our order came - we realized we overdid it on the duck fat fries - my friend and I got an order each and it was probably enough for 4 people.  We studied the hot dogs for a bit and then we went in for the kill - my buddy and I both went with the main attraction: the foie gras dogs. One bite... and that was over for me.  Sinfully rich and decadent.  We both let off a 'Oh wow...' and fists slammed the table.  This is a foodgasm.  I don't know if this was 'change your life' good - but it definitely altered my expectations about hot dogs.  And no - it's not just a lame gimmick of slapping high cost ingredients on a hot dog and calling it a day -- the foie gras, truffle aioli and that duck sausage...all working in sweet harmony and just exploding flavour in your mouth.  I'm probably not doing it justice - if I could do it again, I would have ordered at least two of them.  I'm salivating just thinking about it now. To be honest, everything turned a bit grey for me after the foie gras dog.  The ribeye and curry pork were probably also spectacular - but it came in after the showstopper.  The alligator sausage had an interesting texture - probably won't order another one again, but I had to try it.  And the Chicago dog was solid - but again, it's like going back to Hamburger Helper after filet mignon. The duck fat fries are good - not greasy, hot and tasty - but I thought overrated.  It was good and definitely worth a try - but not a 'destination' dish in my opinion. We waddled out in this dazed state - bellies crammed with the one of the most epic meals of my life.  The cab ride back to the hotel was silent.  My friend and I didn't speak of the incident for the rest of the day.  I think both of us felt like we committed some great unspeakable sin.  Something *this* good *must* be wrong, right? It wasn't until that night (my final night in Chicago) when my friend leaned in and whispered, ""Hey man... do you think we have enough time tomorrow before our flight to grab some more foie gras dogs?"" That was on a Saturday.  Hot Doug's is closed on Sundays.  I spent my flight home looking at pictures of my foie gras dog... tears welling up in my eyes.",0.9978,0.807,0.145,0.048,0.5522743055555558

We were SOOOOO anxious that the queue would snake all the way around and our hungry stomachs would be screaming throughout our wait.  Extremely fortunate were we! The queue was still within the doors of the restaurant! Yayyyyy! Ok, I wouldn't call it a restaurant because it's a small, unassuming place, tucked into the corner after a row of residential houses.  We loved the deco - there were so many things hanging on the walls, cool pictures all over (even in the washroom!), very VERY colourful, even the chairs are of red, yellow, blue. The energy and activity that fills the place belies the size of it!  Anyway, we ordered the foie gras dog (can't remember how much this was), the swedish potato Sausage with Dill-Garlic Mustard and Caraway Havarti ($7.50), and the cheese fries (large @ $2.75). My husband said his foie gras dog was not bad. I can't quite classify that ""not bad"" for you because I couldn't bring myself to eat the foie gras. Sorry, Yelpers! I can tell you re the Swedish potato Sausage though. The sausage was unbelievably soft and juicy inside. Usually when you eat hot dogs, they're tough and plain NOT nice. This swedish potato sausage had a PROPER taste! The hot dog bread was amazingly soft and hot, just soooooo pleasing in your mouth. The Dill-Garlic Mustard wasn't overpowering in taste because they didn't splatter it all over the hot dog as that would mask the taste of the cheese and sausage. I'd say the servings given for each accompanying ingredient for the hot dog was just perfect to compliment the sausage and bread. Cheese fries. They're good. There are different kinds of fries. Some people like the thin crispy, hardly any potato filling kind, some like it fat, filled with potato and soft.  Hot Doug's fries are medium-sized, filled with a loose amount of potato meat, not very soft, not very sturdy to hold up straight and not very crispy - it's like everything in moderation. But when it's hot and with warm melted cheese...it's GooooooD.  All in all, I would say that it's a great place. Good food, definitely much (x100) better than the normal hot dog.

I figured I should take my own advice and try their duck sausage with foie gras. Foie gras was everything Anthony Bourdain promised it would be, downright amazing!

Once inside, where I could fully investigate the menu, I chose the smoked duck sausage with red pepper mustard, olives, and cheese and cognac-infused lamb/pork sausage with fig goat butter and aged cheese.  I liked the latter better, but overall, I thought both offerings could have been stronger in flavor, with the exception of the cheese.  Upon approaching Doug at the counter, bf went with, ""I'll order the whole right side of the specials menu"".  I wonder if Doug's heard that one before. And the duck fat fries were amazing, as usual!  Since the last time I was here, an employee will find you a table by the time your food is ready.  Woot!

We got there right at opening at 10:30am and ended up waiting about 45 minutes. There is a small dining area but because you wait so long in line it actually has a pretty good flow. Someone always seems to be getting up when it's time for the next group to sit down. Doug himself takes your order which is very cool and the whole place is hot dog crazy. Hot dogs decorate the entire place, every inch, every weird piece of decor...love it! Once your food is ready, they call your name and bring your food out to your table. Don't even try sitting down before you get your food! It ain't gonna happen! You'll get served! :) I got the The Howard Porter (Today's Celebrity Sausage) Apple and Cinnamon Pork Sausage with Sweet Curry Mustard and Velours Brie-Blue Cheese for $7.50 ...Loved it! I could have done without the mustard and just had some other type of sweet sauce but overall, VERY tasty! I also got the Spinach and Mozzarella Chicken Sausage with Sun-Dried Tomato Mayonnaise and Smoked Provolone Cheese which was also $7.50. This was so tasty! I was a bit worried about the sun-dried tomato mayo but the mayo outweighed the tomatoes on this one for me. It was a fantastic flavor combination and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The duck fat fries were okay...but I saw no difference between them and the regular fries. Unsophisticated palette perhaps or some other fluke. Either way I won't be getting fries, duck fat or not, next time. Both of my hot dogs were VERY good! Now time to make my comparisons with my other gourmet dawg hot spot, Franks N Dawgs. Pricewise - Even Steven.

No specific flavors were jumping out on my tongue in joy. -Favorite of everyone I was with by far was a sausage that had Vosges bacon chocolate on it. Funny enough we ordered it for a friend who was late and ended up eating it. SUPER glad we stole her food because it was the saving grace of the sausages. Since the line was short we went back through again when she finally arrived. Unfortunately I don't see it on their menu anymore... I really, really, really wanted to love Hot Dougs.

2011-03-20,4.0,"My first time in Chicago and my friend recommended this restaurant to me (Because you can't come to Chicago without getting hot dogs, right???). It was an awesome experience. I'm not really a hot dog person, but these were GOOOOOD. I got duck fat fries, 'The Dog' (normal Chicago dog w/all the toppings), and the cognac-infused lamb hot dog. Duck fat fries were fucking AMAZING. They were very crispy, which I LOVE. Their taste was very rich but I couldn't tell any duck taste or anything, haha. They were a bit pricy but so worth it. 'The dog' was good---I love their buns, so soft and delicious. It was okay, but I don't like pickles so that probably negatively influenced my appreciation of the hot dog. The lamb dog was AMAZING. It was slightly sweet, but had a very sharp/salty sort of cheese and the lamb was delicious. Everything balanced out perfectly.  We came on a Friday (hence the duck fat fries were available) in the afternoon at about 2:45 or so, and we were in by a little past 3. The wait wasn't bad at all, especially after we got out of the cold and into the warm restaurant. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, everyone here was super nice and we made lots of friends in line that we ended up sitting with to eat!

2011-03-15,5.0,"There is a lot of hype about Hot Doug's out there and I don't like be led into an opinion by those around me.  To negate this public perception I decided to turn my visit into a grueling affair, forcing Doug's to gain my appreciation only by overshadowing a terrible experience getting in.  Naturally, Chicago offers this opportunity.  I waited for close to an hour and a half outside of Doug's in the atmospheric physics paradox that is a 30 degree rain shower complemented by a steady 40 mph horizontal wind. After entering, I was thoroughly miserable and perfectly primed for discarding the restaurant as ""not worth the wait.""        The cashier was too friendly and upbeat to possibly understand the state his thawing customers are in when they enter but he assured me I would leave sated, warm, and happy.  This man knew his customers as well as Hot Doug's knows encased meats!      I had a Chicago style classic as well as the weekend only duck fat fries and a rattlesnake dog and everything was fantastic!  The fully loaded Chicago style was spot on and surprisingly competitively priced (I expect inflated prices at these cult institutions).  The chardonnay & jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with chili garlic mayo and smoked gouda had just the right amount of heat and a unique gaminess to make it something truly special and worth the $8 price point.  I also tried a bite of a companion's foie gras and duck sausage which was delicious but too rich to eat alone.  The only thing that didn't live up to the hype were the duck fat fries.  They were great hand-cut fries that stand above most others but didn't have the decadence that I expected.      Thank goodness the weather is changing because although it is totally worth it I still won't look forward to a frigid waiting line...",0.9946,0.762,0.187,0.051,0.5821428571428571

Hot Doug's is a quality place to get some good eats. Sure you have to wait in line, but trust me it really isn't all THAT bad, it moves quickly and you make friends with the people who are just as eager as you to try the duck fat fries and foie gras topped sausages. If you go during the week, the duck fat fries aren't an option, but the wait is considerably less. If you do end up venturing to this mecca of meaty goodness, take caution and check the website before you leave. Hot Doug's is owned by, you guessed it, Doug and he does take vacations from time (who can blame him? he works all week, every week) and so the shop can be closed certain holidays. Also, it is CASH ONLY so be sure to hit up an ATM. This isn't your average hot dog joint and they specialize in exotic sausages, not hot dogs. So if you are looking for you classic Chicago style dog, your best bet is your local hot dog stand (Hot Doug's certainly sells Chi style dogs, but they are made with caramelized onions, which in my opinion makes them too soggy). The only reason I give Hot Doug's four stars instead of five is that it isn't the most accessible place to get to, but its worth the trek.

If you're not in a rush to be somewhere I recommend giving this place a try, at least once in your life. It truly is different and a gem.

It was my least favorite because it was mini bagel dogs and I found the bagel part make everything dry.  I also didn't find anything extra special about the duck fat fries as everyone is claiming...they honestly taste just like regular fries to me! Pros: -inexpensive -lots and lots of varieties to choose from -Friendly and helpful customer service Cons: -long line -restaurant set up is kind've crowded + all of the people there too -street parking which gets hard to find b/c of all of the people there trying out hot doug's too. -they cut you off from waiting in line at 4pm daily  -closed all day sundays I definitely would come back to try the other dogs that I haven't tried out yet!",0.9931,0.816,0.17,0.015,0.5167673992673992

So much so that they can close down for several consecutive weeks, probably without noticing a dent in income (yes, they do this occasionally, so make sure they're open before making a special trip). The place is super small, and weekend lines are known to stretch all the way down Roscoe (and then some). Get there early, and you still may have to wait. Check it out during the week - lines can still be long, but instead of waiting three hours, you may only have to wait one. And the duck fat fries - unique and good, but save all the room in your stomach for the sausage. The best idea is to get a couple sausages each and share, thus experiencing more of what Hot Doug's has to offer.

Skip the weekend mecca.  The lines are too long and the duck fat fries are overrated - there, I said it!  Simply put, they are not sufficiently different in flavor from regular fries to justify the longer lines.  If you want great tasting fries in exotic animal fat, go to Longman & Eagle any day of the week and get the beef tallow fries.  That, my friends, is flavor. Instead, take a weekday off; I recommend Wednesday to bisect the workaday grind.  Order a duck sausage dolloped in foie gras butter; not simply  because such an order was briefly illegal, but because it is DELICIOUS.  The gorgeous flavor comes mostly from the Sauternes sauce, which provides a sweet balance to the smokiness of the duck.  Skip the fries completely and choose a second game sausage - the buffalo and elk combination with cheddar cheese is an excellent choice if Doug has it on the menu.  But any random wild animal will do. Consume said sausages with a root beer, and go home for a well deserved afternoon nap.  Wake up and get game at Longman & Eagle or RevBrew.  Rinse and repeat.  America, what a country!",0.9846,0.832,0.151,0.017,0.5473276723276724

Feel good and enjoy! I guess it's because - let's face it - a hot dog is an American childhood comfort food. If you grew up here, and even if you're from a different culture at some point you were likely exposed to encased meats in extruded form, served on a bun. What Doug Sohn has done here is capture the honesty of youthful pleasure, and embue it with a decidedly adult twist in the greatest Chicago fashion.  Remember, these are just hot dogs, sausages and linked meats so you aren't going to rival a trendy new american West Loop joint with food here. What you are going to rival though are your most cherished childhood memories of picnics, afterschool snacks and family/friend/team bbqs.

While waiting in line, we were anxious to try what we have heard so much about.  While waiting, we were deciding what to get. So many different choices, and if it were up to me, I would've wanted to order everything off the menu and have a bite of each. However, that didn't happen! Doug took our order, and something about having the owner of the establishment working the counter every day the place is open makes the place even better!

All of them had great distinct flavors as described on the menu, and they were all good in their own ways. I am a fan of Foie Gras, but I personally did not like the Foie Gras hot dog. It was loaded with Foie Gras, but something about paying $6 for so much foie gras really turned me off.

We chose the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut and the Hot Sauce Chicken Sausage with ""Buffalo"" Mustard and Smoked Moody Blue Cheese.

Still, despite my careful planning, there is ALWAYS a line. Which I don't actually mind. It gives me time to change my mind on what I had planned on getting, and then go back to my original idea. Several times. I always go for something that's on the specials list which are good, but this time I branched out and went for The Game of the Week, which was fantastic. Since they change all the time, it's not really worth mentioning in detail what it was, but if I'm ever faced with the opportunity to have an elk sausage again, I definitely will take advantage of that opportunity.

2011-01-29,3.0,"I'm conflicted.  Let's just say that.   This review for me is somewhere between 2.5-3 stars.  Yes, I know: Stone me now all you guys who gave 5 stars.  In part my rating is based on how many 5 stars this got, and my general expectations going in, vs. my actual experience. Maybe, as a reviewer said, this is THE best hot dog in Chicago.  I wouldn't know, because it's true, I only eat hot dogs a few times a year.  It's not my thing, and I only crave a dog when I want hugely bad-for-you food, and maybe yes, I am PMSing.  But when I WANT it, I do love me a goddamn good hot dog.  So there is that, as well.  And I also like gourmet food.  So... Maybe I am a simple girl, at heart.  When I want a hot dog, I want something earthy and good and dressed down and still awesome, not dressed up.   Which is why Hot Doug's confuses me. It's like Grammy night at the smorgasbord.  I went in with an open mind.  I thought if I had to stand in line for freakin' 50 minutes, I'd order a lot.  And I thought:  Foie Gras, dressed DOWN!  Hot dog dressed UP!  And cheese!  What could be better? Simple, now, is my thinking. I had two 'special' hot dogs, and one plain.  It doesn't matter what 'specials' I had--though if you want to know, my husband and I had the foie gras dog and ""the dog"" and I had the ""Fire Dog"" and the ""Selma"".  But I don't think any special dog would change the review. At 9.00 a pop, the specials were *nothing* I could complain about.  Really! Well, maybe the bun. (See my other reviews...I am a huge bun/dough girl.)  The encased meats WERE really divine.  The cheeses and sauces were also good.  But, there is this:  I would never brag about them, either.  And at 9.00 a HOT 'DOUG', wouldn't you think I should be bragging? So here's my problem:  I was still weirdly not satisfied.  To large degrees. And at 9.00 a bun?!   And an hour wait?  This place left me thinking about word-of-mouth hype.  I can't complain about it--I can't at all--but I can't at all say my heart swelled on that one of few occasions I SERIOUSLY wanted a damn hot dog.   I really, really wanted to love this place.  But for the price and overall 'happiness', I'd sooner skip this 'meal.' Oh, regarding service (Forgot this, and adding now):  Doug is SO very nice.  Really helpful, friendly.  A+++++ However, after waiting in line almost an hour, and watching people bunch up at the 'end of the line', waiting for tables (there is really no room), I was very aware of who was in front of us (and should get seated first) and who was behind us (and, after a long wait, should get seated after).  So the waiter dude, who wasn't paying any attention whatsoever, tried to get my husband and I to wait when we went for the 'open table' and were next in line.  He swore the people behind us were ahead of us.  I explained, nicely, that No, we were ahead of the other couple. and he said we weren't!!!  Really?  Like he was painfully waiting for an hour to be seated?  It actually took the couple behind us, who this dude wanted to seat ahead of us, stepping up and saying ""REALLY, they were here first"" that we got seated.  If this wouldn't have happened--the couple stepping in--and if said waiter wouldn't have seated us when we should have been seated, this would be one star.  Because I don't wait forever, pay a fortune NOT to be satisfied and then on top of it be called a liar.  Indirectly.",0.9868,0.814,0.119,0.068,0.5292267917267919

2011-01-27,4.0,"Yes, I admitted that I had never been to Wurstkuche in LA, but I think Hot Doug's pretty much offer similar sausages, just different atmosphere. A lot of my Yelp buddies told me to go, so at temperature of less than 10degrees outside, my friend and I ventured to Avondale to get hot doug's and boy it was a great decision, a very short line, not even 30minutes wait - lucky for me, and parking was easy for us too. Here are the list of our dawgs for the two of us: - Foie gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur del Sel - best - The Atomic Bomb (Damn Spicy Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese - very good and crazy hot spicy, in a good way - Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri, St. Angel Triple Creme Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions - just okay - the Salma Hayek (formerly the Madonna, the Raquel Welch and the Ann-Margret) - Andouille Sausage with caramelized onions - the lowest price among all and still good. with regular small fries. For non-foodie, the Foie gras might not look so appealing, but just take a bite and you'd taste the yummy goodness of the duck and foie gras combined.  If you're a fan of hot spicy sausage, take a bite of the Atomic bomb, you'd love it. The habanero-jack cheese might be too HOT for me, thank God I split that dawg with my friend, otherwise I don't think I would be able to finish that by myself.  The Ribeye in my opinion didn't taste anything special, so I don't recommend getting that one. The Salma Hayek was written as hot, but actually it wasn't so bad, this is one of the regular dawgs you'd always see on the menu. The first 3 are the specials.  Doug is usually at the cashier line writing up your order, very friendly guy, even tho the place is busy, he still jokes around with customers who are placing orders, which I think pretty nice, because some established places just thinking about ka-ching coming through the door.  A couple of my friends were showing up as well and they ordered the duck fat fries, you could definitely taste the flavor of the fat in the fries, so different with the regular one and it's abit more greasy, but it's really good.  Quicktip: Apparently, they also take vacation about 2 weeks in one day, and this time the day coincides with Valentine's day, so before you go, better check first if they're open that day.  If I ever visit Chicago again, I will probably stop by. IN the mean time, I still have to try Wurstkutche to compare these exotic sausages.",0.9983,0.743,0.211,0.046,0.54492580548703

This same approach should be used when ordering at Hot Doug's. Come with about 5-6 of your friends who are willing to share food and together, you can order one of each of the specials. Once you have all your food, people can try the ones that look appealing to them, and basically, everything on the menu looks good, so you'll probably want to try them all.

This place is best experienced by those who have adventurous palates. If you want a boring, traditional hot-dog-and-fries combo, go somewhere else. The many people in line will thank you for cutting down their wait for truly unique food. On my second visit, I had a bacon and cheddar elk sausage with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and black mountain garlic white wine cheese. The only reason I know that is because I took a picture of the menu selection with my iPhone. I tried to get the sausage fried. Doug stopped me and said, ""No. You can get it fried if you really want, but that sausage is best if it's grilled."" Doug knows more than me. The line out the door says so. I took Doug's advice. I made the mistake of ordering ONLY the elk sausage and some great, well-seasoned fries. It leads me to my second piece of advice: order something simple along with your gourmet plate! I say this because you'll want to scarf down food that should truly be enjoyed deliberately. I was starving when my girlfriend and I arrived. After ordering and taking a bite of the elk sausage, I'd wished I'd ordered a hot dog to go along with it.  That way, you can scarf down the hot dog before or while enjoying the main event on the tray in front of you.

2010-12-14,4.0,"This past weekend, I paid a short visit to Chicago to visit some friends.  While there, I checked out a few of the city's best specialties (hot dogs and pizza, of course!). I first started out at Hot Doug's.   The foie gras dog was just one of the joint's numerous offerings. Intrigued? Keep reading... Hot Doug's was featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations: Chicago episode, so of course I had to try it out.   The first thing I noticed was the line out the door and around the corner.  Wind and rain didn't deter these dog enthusiasts! I was here for two things in particular - the first was the Foie Gras and Suaternes Duck Sausage, with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel  And the second thing can be summed up in three words: DUCK FAT FRIES.  Booyah! Sign me up!  I first d(o)ug into the foie gras dog. Now if there's anything I like, it's duck, mousse, truffles, and sausage.  This sounded like a sure winner.   I took a bite and was in heaven. The foie gras was rich, fatty and creamy.  I wanted to slurp up the truffle aioli with a straw (don't judge, you know that sounds good).  This dog was rich and luxurious.  Some might say, a little too luxurious.  The creaminess might just be too much for some. I am not those some. We then tackled the duck fat fries.  I've said it once, and I'll say it again - if I had to pick two fats to eat for the rest of my life (just two? A travesty!), I'd pick duck and pork, no question.   Fried carbs and duck fat sounds like the perfect combination.  Sadly, I didn't really taste as much duck as I had hoped in these fries.  They were yummy and hot, but I just hoped they would be duckier.  Not to worry though, I still finished them. To round out my Hot Doug's experience, I ordered the ""The Dog"" - I figured it was good to try the standard.  I got it with everything - mustard, caramelized onions, relish, tomato, pickle and celery salt. Ta-da! Served on a poppy seed bun, The Dog is a far cry from the NYC style hot dog of plain bun and mustard (plus ketchup if you so desire).  While my heart will always belong to NYC, I appreciate Chicago dogs for all their toppings - especially that DayGlo relish!  Doug's The Dog was perfectly grilled, and the toppings complemented the dog perfectly without overwhelming it.  I was particularly fond of the celery salt - sooooo delish! Of course I couldn't pay a visit to Hot Doug's without a picture with Doug himself!  Doug was right up front, taking orders at the counter.  He was so friendly and down-to-earth.  Even little things such as suggesting getting a small soda (""There are free refills"") show that he's in it for the joy of the hot dog.  And he's a NYC transplant - heeeey! While the wait at Hot Doug's can be a little crazy, the food, ambiance and experience make it all worth it.  If you're ever in Chicago, give Hot Doug's a try!",0.9953,0.835,0.136,0.029,0.5717643467643467

Among them... ...crooked politicians ...cold weather ...a flippin' big lake ...damn good dogs Even New Yorkers can agree ( leisureblogs.chicagotrib… ) that our dogs are the Rolls Royce of the encased meat world and while you can find a proper red hot on nearly any corner in the city, there's really only one place to complete the sausage tour d'force in a single seat. Hot Doug's. I'll leave the background to other more knowledgeable Yelpers (many of whom consider sausage a religion), but just let it be known that Doug has been making award-winning red hots since your pappy was dipping cocktail wienies.  He does the classics. He does head-scratchingly bizarre. But just like grammar, you have to know the rules before you can break them. Doug does. So here's my recommendation to all visitors, whether old timers or newbies: get it all. God knows you're going to be spending an hour plus waiting in line to get in, most likely in sub-freezing temperatures (see things Chicago does well, above), so you might as well make it worth it. What I mean is (especially for newbies), you have to get Doug's take on the classic Chicago dog. You have to try an Italian sausage or Polish. Have to. From there on out, you decide how weird you want it to get. With unique takes on foreign cuisines (on my last visit I had a Thai chicken sausage with seaweed relish) and more exotic animals than you can find on an African safari (buffalo, ostrich, alligator, snake all come to mind), you're only limited to your own boundaries... or the size of your stomach. The good news is that's it's all good. From A to Z and everything in between. And if you ever find yourself lost and confused, just ask what Doug suggests. Yup, that's him right there at the register, day in and day out, preaching the gospel of the sausage who anyone willing to listen.

We found out about Hot Doug's and heard it was a must do.  We went on an early Friday morning and stood outside in the freezing cold for about an hour or so. (Hey, we're from the south! But it was seriously the coldest day of that whole weekend). We finally made it in through the door and out of the cold only to wait some more.  The place is long and narrow, definitely a tight squeeze and not good for big groups. I with 3 other guys ordered about 9 different dogs to get the best sampling.  After all it's not often that you get to try something as unique as Hot Doug's does it.  We got a few off the original menu and some off the specials menu.  And to our delight we came on the right day!  Duck-fat fries were available!! (available only on Friday and Saturday in case you're curious) Unfortunately I cannot recall the names of the dogs.  I myself got the Bratwurst and Chicken sausage.  The chicken sausage dog wasn't really all that great but the Bratwurst was excellent.  The other dogs were interesting and good.  The fries didn't really taste all that different from regular fries but I suppose it's worth checking it out. Overall I would say this is a place to go every once in awhile.  I wasn't sure what all the hype was about but as a tourist I'm glad I got a chance to go.",0.9698,0.844,0.115,0.041,0.5826490047420281
2010-11-26,5.0,"Oh "" Keira Knightley"" (formerly the Jennifer Garner and the Britney Spears) the unspeakable things I would love to do to you right now... Hot Doug's is probably the best Hot Dog joint I have ever ate at. I first heard about this place on the Food Network and decided to check it out while I was in Chicago. I read horror stories of 2 hour waits, so I decided to get there by 10:30 am. To my surprise, there was still a 45 minute wait in the cold, winter day of Chicago, but it was worth it. My fiancé and I ordered 3 different hot dogs between the 2 of use and shared an order of the duck fat fries with the other couple we were with. I forget what we ordered, but the dogs were delicious. They serve the standard Chicago-style hot dog or for the more adventurous they have exotic hot dogs made of other animals and fancy cheeses. I also like how the owner has a sense of humor of naming his creations after celebrities. This is a definitely a hot spot of newbies in Chicago. Highly recommend! A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",0.9903,0.803,0.161,0.036,0.5235727018079959

We got the foie gras dog and the traditional Chicago style dog.  I love seared foie gras passionately, but didn't really enjoy it in mousse form.  The duck sausage was ok but the whole package certainly didn't taste worth the price tag to me.  The other dog was good too, but I was a little disappointed that it was no better than Chicago style dogs I can get in Texas.  I guess that's more a credit to the Texas joints than a discredit here, but I just wasn't that impressed by anything.  The regular non-duck fat fries were meh too.

Well, for me the answer clearly is yes as it lived up to its expectations and then some.

This is just pure heaven and near impossible to describe. It just really needs to be experienced.  I also ate the bison dog which had a pate on it as well.

The line on this place is always out the door and the first two times I went, the people at the front of the line said they had been waiting 2 hours. I had to come up with some kind of strategy to semi-avoid this line. I took Friday off work and went in a post lunch time, in turn only being in a 30 minute line. The line is long partly due to you will have a seat waiting for you moments after you place your order. They know what they are doing so you can sit and enjoy your food when you are done. CASH ONLY! Don't forget your CASH because it would be a little sad waiting all that time and not getting any food! Also it is for LUNCH ONLY as they close at 4PM everyday and NOT OPEN ON SUNDAY! Each day this place has gourmet specials and they are posted on their website each day; around ten each day. I recommend getting one of these specials and a corn dog to complement it. The corn dog is fresh dipped and steaming hot! The hot dog special I got was a Jalapeno & Cheese filled beef dog that was topped with Jalapeno Bacon, Jalapeno Mayo, Pinto Beans, Tomato and Onion. This was a piece out of heaven and I have never had ANYTHING close to as good of a hot dog as that. They don't stop at beef dogs either they go to deer, alligator, bison and more! Honestly, I wanted to sit there like a buffet all day.  Friday and Saturday are also the only two days that have the notorious Duck Fat fries so I had to try them out. Yes, they are good.

I have heard so many good things about this place and I've been dying to try it. We came here earlier this summer to eat, but when we got there we found out it was closed because they were on vacation. Weird for such a popular business. Check online or call-in ahead of time to make sure they're open. So anyway, I was kinda anxious to get there because they close at 4pm, and between wrangling up my friends, getting out of the house, and finding an ATM to pick up some money (they take CASH only, keep that in mind) ... we got there at 3:30. I was kinda worried we wouldn't make the cut-off, but as people came and went from the queue, we found out we were fine. The wait was about 45 minutes. Totally worth the 30 minute conversation about halloween costumes. We finally queue to the door, we walk in, and the place itself is very cool. Just enough room to walk around, and at most maybe you can seat a table of 6 friends. Like any other Chicago food stop, it's got tons of kooky, kitschy sports and historical crap on the walls. The decor is really outrageous, primary colors abound. The menu is pretty big considering it's just sausages and encased meats, separated into ""regular"" dogs and specials. I looked at the menu online and decided ahead of time what specials wanted to try: the ""Mountain man"" and ""Catalonia"" sausage. Price-wise, it is a pretty good value. The cashier (who I am going to assume is ""Doug"" himself) was incredibly cordial, along with the waiters who seat you and bring your orders. They are super efficient and the service is very quick. Okay, here comes the best part of the whole experience, the food. Oh man. It is so great, and the meat is so perfectly spiced and prepared. I am an adamant carnivore, and they're honestly like no other sausage I've had before. And the cheese and sauces accompanying the meat so perfectly accentuate and compliment the meat. Man, oh man. Words cannot describe it, you must try it yourself. My friends also shared their duck fat fries.

We ordered up two dogs duck fat fries, and drinks.  Heavenly!  The foie gras and duck sausage dog was totally worth the $8 or whatever it cost.  Great texture.  The duck fat fries were nice and crispy with a lot of flavor.  Reminds me a bit of In-n-Out fries in terms of 'freshness' but the crispy part really takes it to the next level.   If we ever make it back out to Chicago, we'll definitely have to make time to stop by Hot Doug's again.  There's a reason why this place is listed as the number one hot dog joint in the nation.  I'd have to agree with that sentiment.",0.9175,0.853,0.129,0.018,0.4948717948717949

I took my boyfriend here and good grief he was such a pill the whole time, like a grumpy four year old who had a hangover and kept insisting that it's ridiculous to wait this long for ""just a hot dog."" My testament to the deliciousness of Hot Doug's comes not from my love of exotic meats and their excellent cheese accompaniments, as well as quality ingredients and creative flavor combinations (and most of all my willingness to wait for them). It comes instead from the look on my grouchy impatient boyfriend's face when he scarfed down not one but two of their specials and half a basket of melt in your mouth duck fat fries. Then those three beautiful words, ""you were right!""

Rosemary and garlic chicken sausage with cumin mayo and roasted peppers...  This was VERY good...Juicy flavorful sausage...the mayo left me wondering where I could buy some... and the peppers added a nice kick.    The Elvis... a polish sausage with everything on.  Pretty good but didn't think it was the best I've ever had.   Everyone else got the foie gras duck sausage... didn't try it myself but everyone was pretty happy with it. Duck fat fries... I give it 3 stars... I had been pretty excited about this... but maybe I don't have the palate that could tell the difference?  I had tried the regular fries too and really couldn't tell a huge difference.... a plus that the large portion is huge.  We had 4 servings and the 6 of us could barely finish 3 and trust me we were trying...

2010-10-12,5.0,"Hot Doug's is a Chicago-based restaurant, specializing in hot dogs and other encased meats. The self-proclaimed ""Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium"" is in its second location at 3324 North California Avenue in the city's Avondale neighborhood. Its first location, on Roscoe Street, closed after a 2004 fire. After being coaxed away from my computer by my instinct to be not-thin, and persuasion from a friend... it was off to Hot Doug's.  The first thing you should know about going here is,  go with a friend, for several reasons; although I have come up with 3 essentials: -LONG LINES     Doug's is only open from 10:30am till 4pm Monday - Saturday so anticipate a wait; and you might as well have someone to talk to. -CASH ONLY     Doug's is cash only so if you only have a card or are a little short, it's nice to have a friend near-by to mooch off of. -SHARING     The more people you bring the more you can order split into pieces and try a bit of everything.  Trust me I don't like to share my food, but I gladly do here! My friend said, ""let's do 5 today,"" but we finally settled on 4. The first one which I thought was a easy choice was the Celebrity Sausage (sausage named after a celeb that changes daily or so... I think?) Which was the Bridget Moynahan today which if you don't know who she is, she was in Coyote Ugly, Serendipity (a la John Cusack) and I know her best from a short lived ABC series called 6 degrees, which I actually liked but wasn't a stupid  fucking reality show so I think almost made it only one full season? But this was the  Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage finished a with sriracha mustard and topped with  a sesame seaweed salad. -$7.50 Lastly we dug into the ""big dog"" One-Third Pound Calabrese Pork  Sausage with Creamy-Sun-Dried Tomato Mustard, Spicy Tapenade  and Tallegio Cheese. -$8.00  Wow, the only way to describe this is a big spicy, rich, awesome kick to the  mouth! The decision to have four dogs was justified at first bite of this one  and passing on Doug's fresh cut french fries I learned is the way to do it.  My first bite sent my brain into a utter state of confusion; the warm soft bun surrounding the perfectly cooked chicken sausage which must have been made with fennel or some pepper flake that gave it a holy shit spicy kick but was definitely set off by the sriracha mustard but was at the same time cooled by the seaweed salad which hit my nose at the same time  sending my palate into a state of dislocation of if I was at a Hot Dog joint or Asian Restaurant.  Regardless this was AWESOME!   Quickly moving on to the next one was the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage  with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds. -$7.50 Ok, so I'm pretty sure the only time I've ever had nuts on my sausage is  when I've sat down too fast in gym shorts?  I wasn't sure what to think of  this by looking at it, but at first bite, I was gay for this sausage! The way the roasted almonds complimented every bite and the creme fraiche rounded this dish out; it's a marriage in Massachusetts!   The next one was a Portabella Mushroom and Swiss Cheese Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijionaise, Caraway Havarti Cheese and Shiitake Mushrooms sauteed in duck fat. -$8.00 Hard to write about this one because I'm pretty sure I made this sausage look like Harry Houdini and disappeared before my very eyes.  All I have to say is look at the description, oh yeah and two words, DUCK FAT!   Although, I have yet to go on a Friday or Saturday when the fries are cooked in DUCK FAT!  But my personal fatitude is when you have the option, stick to meat!  My first time I definitely had to try the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel -$9.00 which is one of the dishes that has brought owner Doug Sohn much controversy and notoriety due the recent ban and repeal of fois gras; but I learned the hard way by eating the whole thing, another dog and large fries by yourself is a recipe for stomach holding and food coma...but delicious! Other than hot dogs and encased meats, I think Doug's specializes in thinking outside the box (or bun to steal a phrase from my beloved Taco Bell.)  I could go on about the place but I think  you should try it for yourself this is definitely on my list of favorites. ...Move over Abe Froman, Doug Sohn is the Sausage King of Chicago!",0.9983,0.805,0.147,0.048,0.5684347442680776

My advice is to go to Hot Doug's hungry enough to get 1 ""regular"" dog and 1 ""specialty"".  I was there on a Saturday, so we got the duck fat fries b/c they were available. Call me a philistine, but they didn't rock my world. If you're there on Friday or Saturday, just get them.... but don't kill yourself just for these over-hyped potatoes.

2010-10-08,5.0,"Having gone to Lane Tech theres no way I havent heard of, or made it out to, Hot Dougs.  But I am embarrassed to say I havent been there since high school before the kitchen fire.  Better late than never again I guess.   It was a great day off today without a doubt.  Im glad I didnt sleep in today and made it out to hot dougs.  We joined the line around 2:45, sat down with the food about an hour later.  Mid seventies, early october afternoon in chicago..bring on the line.   Of course I had to order the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with the Duck Fat Fries.  And I added the Lamb and Beef Gyro.  My friend ordered the first two as well and the Buffalo Sausage.  We had shared the Gyro and Buffalo.   Oh man..where to begin?  The duck fat fries!! Crispy, clean..you thought bacon grease is amazing..duck fat puts her to shame.  Bacon grease has to tip her hat and take a knee.  Almost forgot..only available fridays and saturdays! Lamb and beef gyro...kalamata olive sauce, feta cheese!  I love cheese..feta is definitely up there on my list. And these were huge chunks o cheese.  I wasnt too much a fan of the kalamata olive sauce; it was good, dont get me wrong, but def not for me.  I think onions and cilantro would have complimented and completed it well. Buffalo Sausage...Chipotle Dijonnaise and Smoked Gouda.  Did I mention I love cheese?  Because I love cheese!  And smoked gouda has to be..top 3?  That and the chipotle dijonnaise...what a creamy combo.  No only was there chipotle in the dijonnaise but it was also in the buffalo sausage itself.  Great little kick..buffalo was clean and not gamey whatsoever.  Definitely a keeper.  And finally, what could I say about Foie Gras that hasnt already been said?  Letting it sit on the back of your tongue, its essence bounces in your mouth like an echo in a cave.  And then it rises to your nose like smoke up a chimney.  My palette definitely isnt mature enough quite yet to fully grasp such great culinary complexities.   I could completely understand why this would be illegal.",0.9917,0.778,0.162,0.06,0.5281172839506172
2010-10-08,5.0,"Once again, Hot Dougs does not fail to deliver. After almost a month of waiting I FINALLY got to satiate my hunger for some encased meats. Why a month? The last time I went was my birthday and was unable to return since, because of my work schedule. Fridays are the only time Im able to go, so when I have the opportunity, I take it! Especially on a day when its 78 degrees out!? What more of an excuse do you need to trek out there! As usual, I approach the line which moved fairly quickly this time around. After biding my time for the usual 20/30 mins (I got in line about 245 pm, at the counter by 315pm) I stepped up to order. Duck fat fries are a must on a Fri/Sat, since thats the only time its available. Next on the agenda, the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage! My guilty pleasure and addiction, a must try at Hot Dougs. And since I always get 2 specialty dogs, I opted on the game of the week, buffalo sausage. Topped w chipotle dijonnaise and smoked gouda cheese! If that order doesnt make youre mouth salivate, I dont know what will. Eagerly awaiting, my food finally arrives, diving headfirst into the fries before moving onto the buffalo sausage...intense flavor profile, simply put a flavor explosion with every bite! The foie gras sausage needs no intro, any fan of this delight already knows words cannot even begin to describe the deliciousness. My buddy that accompanied me ordered the beef and lamb gyro dog which I sampled. I must say, it surprised me. I think it was missing something, perhaps the tsatziki sauce and onions? overally though, it was tasty. Hot Dougs, I am forever a loyal customer, Im glad such a place exists! And again I cant stress this enough, BRING CASH! The couple behind us were shocked and the poor guy had to sprint to the nearest ATM like Tyson Gay in the Olympics, but he made it! No plastic accepted. Also, if youre in line BEFORE 4PM, you are granted entry. If its 4PM and youre not already in line, dont bother getting out the car.

Oh yeah, for some mysterious reason when I see a line, my sub conscience tells me I need to wait in it. ""Dad, stop the car, I need to get in that God awful line!"" Perhaps I do it because I hear nothing but good things about this place, perhaps it's the fact that I haven't eaten anything since 5:00 that morning, or simply because I don't want to hear my dad talking anymore, and me standing in that line will ensure that quiet time. I practically jump out of the car while it's still moving. Here's my conversation in that line;  Me -""Have you been here before?""  Red-haired girl, ""Yes.""  Me -""Um, is the line always this long?""

Luckily there was plenty to look at while waiting in line; from the people driving by asking ""are y'all really waiting in line for dat? Is it dat guud?"" to all the kitschy wiener-related decorations in the place. My favorite had to be the boys/girls bathroom signs. Boys get a hot dog in a bun, girls just get a bun. If you can't figure out with door to go in, that's your own fault. I ordered a standard Chicago Dog and a corn dog, along with the duck fat fries. I wouldn't say the duck fat fries are a reason enough to eat here, but they're pretty good, I guess. I didn't find that there was too much of a difference between them and regular fries. I'm sure some people would disagree but I wasn't terribly impressed. I was however impressed at how delicious and crunchy my corn dog was. The Chicago dog was delightful, the meat was tasty and all the toppings including the blinding-ly bright green relish were perfect. The constant flow of in and out traffic made seats available at all times. You wait in line, you order, you sit, you eat, and you get out. It's very simple. I'm not sure exactly what happened at 4pm, but there were definitely still a handful of people in line and I THINK they went to check who was last in line AT 4pm and once that person was inside the door they put a sign up behind him/her and cut off the rest of the line. They're very strict about their closing time which I think is OK. If you don't get there early enough it's your own fault for missing out.

2010-10-03,4.0,"Review #1336... is there anyone left in Chicago who hasn't braved a 2hr line to taste a little bit of Hot Doug heaven.  Hot Doug's is a great experience, not sure I will be back more than once considering that Frank's and Dawg's on Clybourn also has inventive homemade sausages, amazing homemade Texas toast esque buns and NO WAIT ! What , you heard it here first !  5 tips for a successful trip to Hot Doug's: 1) Cash Only...  if you somehow miss seeing this on the website or the small sign posted in the restaurant... or right here on my review haha... have no fear, first off there is an ATM a few blocks away on Belmont and if that too fails you and you find yourself at the register famished after a 2hr wait, Doug will help you out, yes that's right, I saw it with my own two eyes, a couple got to the register and realized they had no cash for this cash only joint, Doug's response 'well order your dogs, eat your food, go to the ATM down the street and just come back and pay me' !! WHAT !!! Who is that trusting these days, honestly my grandma even makes me leave my drivers license with her when she loans me money, okay that's not true, but with this kindness offered by Doug how can you not support this place !! 2) Pick the perfect time...  again checking the website is key, Doug seems to be running the register at his restaurant every hour they are open and deservingly so he closes the restaurant and takes vacations, check the website before planning a trip to Avondale. Doug's is open 10:30am -4 Monday-Saturday, yes closed on Sundays, the earlier you get there the better to avoid lines, or if your lucky enough to have a weekeday off that could be your best bet ! Duck fat fries are only offered on Friday and Saturday, though honestly I didn't really think they were that great, yeah I said it, please don't send me any hate mail. ALSO learn from my mistake and check the weather report so you don't freeze and have to use your gorgeous buttery leather purse as an umbrella !! 3) Choose your perfect dog... I hate to beat a dead horse here but once again I recommend checking out the website before you depart, you will find today's specials. Approx. 1hr 45min into your Hot Doug's adventure you will feel so close to victory, you'll finally be inside and get a glimpse at the menu board on the wall, but why not decide what you want from the comfort of your home so you can dream about it during your 2hr wait. I came with 3 other ladies and we all got one daily special dog which range from $6,50-$10 and one of the cheaper Chicago dogs, $1.75, which are fabulous !! 4) Avoid the delicious looking drinks in the cooler...  yes they are all so interesting and intriguing and everything is exciting after waiting in line that long but the more reasonable option is the fountain soda and FREE REFILLS ! 5) MOST IMPORTANT...  enjoy your entire Hot Doug's experience... including the line since that is where you will be spending the majority of your time, don't go starving cause you will be waiting in line for a while, bring some interesting company you will need some entertainment, and either go when the weather is nice or be prepared for the elements whatever they may be !",0.9986,0.728,0.203,0.069,0.6300092017483321

Go figure.  Anyhow, onto the food. The atomic dog was ok. Spicy but I think it could have been spruced up with something extra. The Thai Chicken was alright. I liked the seaweed and sriracha on top...but not so much the dog itself. The foie gras was the best dog we tried! Creamy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth duck liver. Yum! I was unimpressed by the duck fat fries and it surely didn't live up to the hype. It pretty much tasted like regular fries.  The service is awesome.

It's true that Hot Doug's is the best hot dog joint on the planet, but it isn't necessarily the best representative of the Chicago-style hot dog in the city.

The shop is in the middle of an industrial/non-retail business area.  If you spot a long line, that's the line for Hot Doug's.  It took me about half an hour to get to the front of the line and once the order was placed, the food arrived quickly.   It's incredibly exciting to see the actual shop with pictures of hot dog advertisements, celebrities (some are signed), and hot dog paraphernalia - from vintage hot dog cookers, to plush hot dog dolls, hot dog gum, hot dog lights on a string, hot dog hand soap dispensers, and more.  I own a hot dog pen/magnet and Doug had a couple of them (of course).  Hot dogs are everywhere!  Learn more about them by studying the History of Encased Meats poster. There are regular sausages that you can have grilled, steamed or deep fried, and a changing menu of specialty sausages, including a celebrity sausage, game of the week (ostrich during my visit but it could be rattlesnake, alligator, etc.).   * The Atomic Bomb ($7.50): Damn Spicy Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Fontina Cheese.  It's even better than it sounds.  The pork sausage is quite spicy (I think I saw jalapeno bits) with amazing flavor, juicy and fatty in the best way.  And it's bathed in this addictive spicy creamy chipotle dijonnaise, topped with a mountain of fontina cheese cubes (big ones) and surrounded by a soft, warm steamed bun.  I thought the cold cheese was a strange idea but it actually works.  Doug is a sausage genius.   * Duck fat fries ($3.50): Only available on Fridays and Saturdays, a huge heaping portion of thinly, unevenly cut skin on fries, slightly crispy outside, soft inside.  They grew cold very quickly and many pieces were tiny stubs.  These were good but I'd rather have another sausage next time.  After all, this place is all about the sausage.

The hot dog options were as gourmet as I've ever seen --  with toppings ranging from Manchego cheese to pesto spinach and the works. I settled on a knockwurst toppeed with bacon, garlic mayo, and Vincent Van Gogh cheese. I never even knew they made a cheese after my favorite psychadelic painter but it did not disappoint.

2010-08-28,5.0,"When I was a kid, I hated hot dogs; soft, flimsy, tasteless, cheap snacks they passed off on the non-discriminating kids. An Oscar Myers laid in a potato roll was O.K. for a neophyte, but I just could not stomach it. The boundary between sausage and roll was indiscernible and the taste homogenous. I know they paid that chubby kid tons to sing so happily of crappy meat products on T.V.       Then in my later years and owing to work, I had the good fortune to work with Vienna Beef, hot dog central of Chicago. At Vienna and in Chicago, the hot dogs are a world apart from home. Out there sausages are crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The extras too, are different and ketchup nearly never used. The loaded Chicago hot dog is topped with onions, electric green pickle relish, sport peppers, tomato slices, a dill pickle spear and celery salt. Wow!     Since we got the condo in Irving Park, I have been dying to get to the Zagat rated 25, HOT DOUGS.     FROM ZAGAT     Carnivores ""wait in line"" at Doug Sohn's ""legendary encased-meats emporium"", where there's ""more seating"" and better parking than at his original haunt but the same ""lousy hours"" (the kitchen closes at 4 PM); rest assured, though, that ""it's worth"" it for his ""outrageously decadent sausage sandwiches"", including more than a dozen ""gourmet hot dogs"" - no, it's ""not an oxymoron"" - ranging from ""rabbit"" to ""rattlesnake""; P.S. he ""puts the fry in Friday with his duck-fat fries"" (available on Saturday too).     So when in Chicago early on a Friday, I mapquested the place and after scribbling on a pack of matches, set off for the ""emporium.""      At 1.9 miles it seemed walkable. I traveled it in Google Earth, but some 30 minutes into the walk, I figured it might have been more than I had been up for. I then planned to take a cab home.        I travel down Waveland, down Addison FOREVER passing the Mirabelle a German restaurant we found last Winter. An aroma of sauerkraut drifted from the back kitchen door as a blue van drove up, dropping off authentic German suds. Finally, to California St, past the White Castle and Com Ed, I could see it in the distance. And too the line.      Hot Doug's is about twice the size of a Subway and people lined the store out the door and down the street. It was hot and there were 2 vestibules of increasingly cooler air inside. After 20 minutes I made it into the inner sausage sanctum and to the menu board. CASH ONLY! The regulars were hot dog, Brats, Thuringer, Veggie, Hots, $2-3 and then the ""specials board."" Here the selection where more elaborate with Atomic Rib Eye, and Garlic, Pork Catalonian. These fetching about $7-9. I only had a twenty. Yeeks!     As it was Friday, duck fat fries were to be had at $3.50. WOW! I signed on for the fries, the Thuringer and spending away cab fare, the Catalonian Pork. I got them loaded. The Thuringer came ""Chicago style"" and the Catalonian with mustard and grated Asiago cheese. A taste of the Catalonian, sent me skyward. Truly, the best sausage I have ever had! The ""Marty Allen"" Thuringer nearly as good was the second best ""encased meat"" of my life. The fries good, pailed to the links. It was cab fare well spent.

2010-08-02,5.0,Doug is one of the nicest guy's known to man. No one can beat his dog's!!! I'm so sad I don't live down the street on Roscoe anymore! I can't tell you how many times I've come in and he's given me a break when I've run out of cash. He also puts up with my little momma that loves to talk his ear off when he's trying to manage that massive line that wraps out the door and goes allllll the way down to the alley. Only thing that makes me sad is that he closes at 4 and I get out of work at 4:45 most days. WAHH!  KEEP IT UP DOUG!!! I think your place is so unique and  I forgot to mention that he plays the best music ever and has the most stylish glasses............one more thing.......he has this waitress that is one of the meanest most cold hard B***hes eve!

We got to the front of the line and the super friendly server took our order-- alligator sausage, game sausage of the week (venison, Antelope, Buffalo and Elk), 1 order of duck fat fries, and 2 cokes.  Within minutes our food arrived, and we were in sausage heaven. It was definitely one of those meals where we were too busy eating to talk.  The fries were PERFECT, and the sausages crispy and delicious. The unlimited coke was a nice touch, too, esp since the gator was a little spicy.  Just a few things to keep in mind: like everyone says, the line takes forever. no good way to take a train. cash only.

We finally got to the front of the line around 12:30ish and Doug himself was incredibly friendly and takes all orders (and adds up the bill) himself. Really personable guy who seems to love what he does. The fact that he was wearing pajama pants and had a few words for every customer reallly speaks to the atmosphere of his establishment! We ordered the Chicago Dog and Andoille sausage, which are fixtures on the menu as well as the weekly itemed Hot Doug's BLT (Bacon Sausage with Avocado Mayonnaise, Iceberg Lettuce, Cherry Tomatoes and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese),and buffalo sausage  (brown ale and chipotle buffalo sausage topped by a horseradish cheddar cheese and bacon-garlic mayonnaise). I really enjoyed all of them but the Andoille was at the bottom of the list. The BLT was increeedddibleee!!! Also split a duckfat fries dipped in cheese sauce which was baller as well. Don't know exactly how to differentiate duckfat fries from regular french fries, but needless to say, they were really good. Definitely give this place a try if you have a few extra minutes and enjoy any kind of encased meat. Although the place is small, you can always really find a seat due to the flux of people going in and out. Go Gators",0.9955,0.826,0.163,0.011,0.43760036260036256

2010-07-02,5.0,"Hot Doug's is consistently one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The reason why this place is so good is because the specials (and when you go, you'll want to order at least two sausages off the specials menu) are some of the most inspired dishes I've ever seen in my life. Don't waste your time on the hot dogs and regular sausages. I'm sure they're all good, but they're nothing like the specials. As of July 2, 2010, here are just a few things on the menu at Hot Doug's: Rosemary and Garlic Smoked Chicken Sausage with Sweet Chili-Garlic Mustard and Cheese-Stuffed Marinated Hot Peppers  Spinach, Mozzarella and Pepperoni Pork Sausage with Pesto Genovese, Roma Tomatoes and Gran Cascina Pecorino Cheese  Hot Doug's BLT: Bacon Sausage with Avocado Mayonnaise, Iceberg Lettuce, Cherry Tomatoes and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese  Once in a while, you'll get a special that seems somewhat lacking - either the flavors promised in the sauce will not jump out all that much, or the sauce will seem flat, or something. But even then the food will seem pretty good. And then it's great, as it was for example when they were selling the Teuben (a Reuben sandwich as a sausage), it'll blow your mind. Hot Doug's is cash-only, so keep that in mind when you go. I honestly think the ideal thing to get is two specials per person, and then if it's Friday or Saturday, split some of the duck fat-fried french fries.

2010-06-10,5.0,"The first thing that struck me about Hot Doug's is that it is an incredible business model. Have your clientele wait in anticipation, poring over your menu, for hours before they get to the counter, and I guarantee they'll order 4 times what they'd intended.  This was the first stop on my summer project with my fiance, the Great Summer Sandwich Adventure. Hot dogs and hamburgers, we have arbitrarily decided, count as sandwiches, but burritos don't. We feel like we've already discovered many excellent taquerias, and do not require structure to further this quest. Hot Doug's has always abstractly been on our list of Things To Do Before Leaving Chicago, but we ended up actually going because we had family in town who were interested.  On a rainy Saturday morning, the line was an hour and a half to two hours long. By the time we got to the front, we were veterans. The people behind us, hoping for a tasty, greasy hangover cure, found the wait too uncomfortable, and the guys in front of us just plain got bored.  We ended up ordering the fois gras dog (of course), the smoked crayfish and pork and the classic Chicago dog, supplemented by an order of duck fat fries. Everything was completely delicious. Honestly, you should absolutely get the Chicago dog, even if it looks boring, because it's a sublime combination of flavors and textures. You should also order two orders of fries - the regular and the duck fat - just to contrast flavors.  In the end, I probably won't go back to Hot Doug's unless someone else really wants to - it's a little out of the way, and a pretty major time commitment even on weekdays - but I'm hugely glad we went, and that we did it right.

I was well prepared for the wait and it wasn't necessarily as bad as I thought but in the end I think we waited about 1 and a half hours by the time we were out it was a good two hours just to get the hot dogs.  I don't know if my  expectation was just too high or I'm just missing something. The room was crowded after we ordered so we just decided to take it to go. I was super excited for the duck fat fries everyone talks about so I tried one right as they gave me the order. Wait..... I don't get it. It tasted like regular fries. I'm not sure why they were so special. Maybe they gave us the wrong fries but I don't know. They were just simply.... fries. Better than mcDonalds but not special enough for me to wait that long for.  I thought well okay, I should try the hot dogs before I judge. So I went back to a friends place to try them. We got the Applewurst and the game of the week which was a buffalo dog with ale and some other things. Our ultimate conclusion was that the hot dogs were special. As it unique but definitely not something I would want to wait in line for almost 2 hours to get. It was an experience for me I'm not exactly amazed by the dogs but now I've tried it I don't think I'll be going back.",0.9899,0.779,0.173,0.048,0.5543110882173382

Was it worth the wait?  Not in my opinion.  But it was fun trying these crazy types of hot dogs, but when it came down to it - I liked the ""regular"" hot dog a whole lot better than any of the other specialty hot dogs.  And these are definitely very filling - very surprisingly, we were all STUFFED after eating our own share of 2 hot dogs and the fries - and I'm talking about 3 big guys who can eat plus myself. Would I come again?  Well...maybe - but not if I had to wait.  The duck fat frites are definitely the best part - so come on a Friday or Saturday.  But I'm really glad I came - there is so much hype about this place that I just had to try it for myself.   Plus the owner himself, Doug! is at the front counter - he is SO NICE and SO very helpful.  Plus he does all the cashier calculations in his head!  I'm happy his business is successful because he just seems like such a nice guy.",0.9977,0.784,0.191,0.025,0.5961438668169438

2010-05-13,5.0,"I firmly believe that there's nothing I can say about Doug's that hasn't already been said. In fact, I bet that someone has already written the EXACT sentence I just wrote. We all know that Hot Doug's provides the greatest sausage concoctions ever. EVER. Inarguable. So I thought I'd take a second to focus on the negatives. 1.) Hot Doug's is over 400 miles from my home. Even if I fly to Chicago, get in a cab, get to Hot Doug's and wait in line, I can't have a sausage for probably 3 hours. 3 hours is a long time to wait for this goodness.  2.) I have friends who live in Chicago who have never been to Doug's. This is inexcusable. It's like living in Paris and never seeing the Mona Lisa, it's like living in Cairo and saying, 'man, those pyramids are just TOO far away,' it's like living in Amsterdam and never contracting an STD in the Red Light District.  3.) I know people who plan trips to Chicago, and at my insistence, promise to go to Doug's. When they get back, they say, 'oh, my grandma was having heart surgery in Wheaton and we just couldn't find the time.' Fuck your grandmother. You FIND the time.  4.) The hours are limited. This is self-explanatory. I'm not advocating a 3am close. You can't truly appreciate Doug's unless you're of sound mind and body. Plus, late-night hot-dog places breed animalistic tendencies. I don't want a 'vanilla milkshake,' wherein Doug bares his breasts for $20. Go to Wiener's Circle at 3 in the morning. Enjoy. It would be nice, though, if I could have dinner at Doug's.  5.) Hot Doug's is over 400 miles from my home. This is a big one.  If I could marry a sausage-emporium, it would definitely be Hot Doug's. I'd treat her right, make sweet love to her and have little half-human/ half-sausage monster-babies. Then, we'd have to kill them in infancy. And eat them.

Crayfish and pork sausage with shrimp remoulade and creme fraiche: Yummy but the creme fraiche had a very goat cheese-y taste to it.   We had another 2 hot dogs that were a Jack Daniels fennel pork sausage with something and then the other one had something with smoked gouda.  I can't quite recall and the website and menu seems to change daily, but I remember them being very tasty as well.

And sometimes you realize it was like waiting 20 minutes for the women's bathroom at a club; you got what you waited for, but you left feeling empty and with a little toilet paper stuck to your new heels. Happy to say that Hot Doug's was the former, and that their bathroom had no wait and was relatively clean. In our case, we waited around 40 minutes, but the weather was nice, and the other people in line were fun to watch (mostly people in their 20s and 30s, many with children, since it was a Saturday). After waiting in line, the man at the counter was so friendly that you almost forgot there were three hundred people behind you. After you order, you can eat inside or outside (really an alleyway by the restaurant, but it's clean, and the servers will bring your food to you). They have a case by the counter with local and mainstream sodas. We ordered the spicy Thai chicken sausage with sriracha mustard and seaweed-sesame salad, the cranberry and shiraz wild boar sausage with sweet curry mustard and grand canaria cheese, and the duck fat fries. I think the Thai chicken sausage was the superior of the two, but it was nice to share both to alternate the spicy with the sweet. In case you were curious, having the seaweed-sesame condiment is absolute genius. Both sausages were cooked nicely and retained juices inside while having a little of the grill on the outside (if you know what I mean). The duck fat fries were quite nummy but not very crispy. Still, I had to tell myself to stop eating them. We shared one order of the fries between the two of us.

Here's our take on it:  The foie gras dog is fine, but a little rich for our tastes - if we got that one, we couldn't possibly eat 1.5 dogs each, and it just wasn't a complex-enough flavour to keep us interested, especially when compared to the wild game dogs.   Some favourites so far have been:   - If he's serving wild boar - GET IT.  GET SEVERAL.  - Elk, venison - get them - The 'Badger' - a rich, recurring staple (I think it's actually pork - possibly with garlic and cheddar?)  - The 'Mountain Man' - we love it when this one shows up - Turducken - YUM - Doug makes magic with pork so, if in doubt, go with one of those   Seriously - the only way to go wrong with the special sausages is by not knowing what YOU like.  I am more partial to the rattlesnake and kangaroo than my husband generally is, so we have only gotten those items a couple of times that they've been featured.  Certain ingrediants might not work for you - I am not a fan of the juniper flavour, so dogs with juniper-infused condiments won't sit as well with me. As for the fries and tots.  We've had the duck fat fries, and they're nice - but they're not as nice as the sausages (in our opinion) so we generally don't bother with them.  We got the tots once, because they're a fun option and we wanted to try them but, again - we go there for the sausages.  No point in loading up on potato products. We have not tried any of the ""regular"" hot dogs... We just don't see the point, although we're sure they're probably great, as regular dogs go.  ALSO - they're reasonably priced, if you're just stopping for a quick bit of protein.

Okay.  Yes.  the commute is a b*tch and a half... but it's worth it.  One might argue that there isn't much you can do with a hot dog to make it ""great,"" and one might be right.  You can grill it or you can boil it, and when all is said and done, there just isn't as much room for culinary creativity as say, a rack of lamb.  Like the Shake Shack phenomenon in Manhattan, you go to Hot Dougs for the experience.  Part of that experience, to the dismay of some who just want to fill their bellies with meat and relish, involves waiting in line.  You have to go to Hot Dougs with an open mind (and an empty stomach).  I won't deny it, the hot dogs themselves are delicious, as tasty and satisfying as any hot dog I've ever had, but a they are still just wieners on buns, good for 3, maybe 4 bites.  The wait in line with other tourists and eager first-timers, the descriptions on the wall menus, and the excitement of finally seeing Doug's smiling face waiting for you at the counter, are what make this a great place to check out at least once. We showed up at 930am (the place opens at 1030) on a sunny, chilly, Saturday morning to find a dozen people already patiently standing outside.  By 1030, when the doors opened, the line went back about three blocks.  Compared to Shake Shack this is not a long line, but the difference is Doug himself takes your order, and also some spends some time chatting with each customer (and posing for pictures in our case), so the line doesn't move nearly as fast. No problem, you can take this time to read the descriptions of the various hot dogs for sale, as well as a menu of Daily Specials.  I went with the Kiera Knightley and the standard hot dog, grilled and boiled, respectively.  My girlfriend opted for the standard hot dog, with everything, and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli (I still have no idea what Aioli is), Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel.  We also got orders of the Duck Fat Fries (which tasted exactly like regular fries). My standard hot dog was very good, well cooked, juicy, and pretty filling.  I don't really know how else to describe a hot dog... the Kiera Knightley had a spicy tinge to it, but nothing mouth numbing (I guess she isn't as hot as she used to be).  If I'm ever here again I'll try the extra hot ""Selma Hayek"" (too bad they don't offer the Penelope Cruz... cuz DAAAMN).  I had a bite of the Foie Gras, which was delicious, but I estimate that one bite was worth roughly $3, which could've gotten me another Kiera/Selma. The staff here is very friendly, and they make sure you don't grab tables until you've gotten your food.  The space isn't huge, but you don't feel cramped either, even with a few dozen customers inside and a hundred more out the door.   I'd return here again if I am in Chicago, but only if I have nothing else on my schedule.  If you are just craving a Chicago style hot dog, then Portillo's in the city is a much quicker bet. One last bit of advice--find someone to drive you, or call a cab for pick-up 15 to 20 minutes in advance.  We ended up walking 20 blocks to the subway stop to get back to downtown, since the area is entire devoid of taxis.",0.995,0.812,0.133,0.055,0.5087014748919513

The duck fat fries tasted like.....fries.  Believe me, I REALLY wanted to think there was something special about them, but my palette really couldn't pick it up.  So, I decided to just give them a good whiff, and that's when I noticed it.  There was something subtly different about their aroma, albeit too subtle to pick up with my tongue.  Oh, well....

The Good:  The food is great.  Nuff said.  Anthony Bourdain agrees, and so do like 1,000 Yelp reviewers.  The decor is hilarious - from the men's & women's restroom signs (a hot dog in a bun & just a bun w/o a dog) to Doug's unique naming system for his menu.  You also have gotta like the hard hats the kitchen crew wear - real men at work!  The price is crazy cheap for what you get, especially if you don't indulge in the specials & remain in regular hot dog land.  Do NOT order a large fry because you WON'T finish it!  You'll also notice that Doug is a good man - his giant tip jar has a sign saying that it goes to the people ""doing actual work"", not him.  His bathrooms have signs that say something like ""Employees must, guests should, & really everybody ought to wash their hands."" The Bad:  Doug being a true character, he refuses to submit to the fees from credit card companies.  This place is CASH ONLY!!!  Also, a huge problem is the fact that they close at 4:00pm every day!  No dinner service, unless you take some home right before closing.  This place is damn popular and amazingly well known.  People from all over the country stop here, and the lines are often well over an hour, sometimes 2!

After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I finally made it into the store and ordered two special dogs (the catalonian and the foie) and of course duck fat fries (they only have these on the weekends). Before I get to the good things, I've got to say that the duck fat fries were *very* disappointing. I'm not sure if it was a long day and we were just unfortunate enough to get stuck with fries from old fryer oil or what... But the fries were disappointing even if they were not fried in duck fat. Lacking flavor and a little bit on the soggy side, I probably wouldn't order these again. The Foie dog with the duck sausage was interesting. Hot Doug's definitely did not skimp on the amount of foie on the dog. I'd suggest eating this last as the foie can overwhelm your palate and have a tendency to stay in your mouth a little longer than you'd think. My favorite, by far, was the catalonian... Pork sausage with a saffron rouille... That combo was heavenly... Not only can you actually see threads of saffron in the rouille, it tasted sooooo good...

I had been salivating over the pictures and menu descriptions since moving to Chicago last year, and finally decided to give in temptation. It didn't hurt that my girlfriend told my parents to get me Hot Doug's gift certificates for my recent birthday (which Doug sent BEFORE they paid for them, by the way).  The place was a convenient 20 minute walk for a Northsider such as myself, and arriving around 11:30AM there was a 30 minute line filled with a variety of folks (decked out hipsters to the front, a guy behind us with a suitcase on wheels who I imagined scheduled his layover with time for a hot dog run). We ordered four dogs and two drinks from Doug manning the register personally, who matched my mom's description of seeming like ""such a sweet guy."" He remembered sending off the hot dog vouchers to me, and just took my $20 worth of paper back and called it even for what we calculated was actually around $30 retail. It's that kind of kindness and personal touch which makes a lot of Doug's regulars regular, I bet.  The encased meats in question came through the assembly line with the quickness, and we started with the most luxurious of the lot: the fois gras duck sausage, which we agreed was one of the tastiest things we had ever had (PETA be damned). Then there was the cognac and pheasant sausage, which was a stark flavor contrast from the last with its wine sauce making it more of the fruit serving of this deluxe meat tray. The Marty Allen was next, slathered in traditional Chicago hot dog condimentation, and proved that Doug's makes a regional dog that stands toe to toe with the old guard (and we were able to switch out the onions for sauerkraut for a juicy alternative!) And last but certainly not least was the ""game of the week"": wild boar sausage. I would have never imagined such a snarly little prehistoric looking creature would be such a tasty treat on a bun. And that chistou cheese sprinkled on top had that authentic aged cheese taste, like all those $20 French bricks they have at Whole Foods I dream about melting onto nachos. This was certainly a memorable dining experience, one that I won't hesitate to recommend to others. And to those that are put off by the price, you may have a little piece of mind in that all of the menu prices have tax included (which makes it easy for the percentage dummies such as myself to figure out how far they can stretch their sausage dollar). And I also think that the cash only policy probably keeps the prices down by not having to shill out monthly to Visa. I think if you moved it to a bigger building, made 10 of these and scattered them around the city, or even expanded the hours it would disrupt that personal touch that was a big part of why I loved this place.

AW and I were craving a burger, and when Kuma's hostess said 2+ hour wait we moved on. We went back to my vehicle ( A Ford Flex) and pulled places nearby up on the nav system and saw that Hot Doug's was nearby. Sweet!  We joined the line and waited about 30 minutes in the blowing cold outside. As we reached the outer door the woman in front of us and the couple behind us began to chat with us. It was kind of like a concert ticket line, but with near instant gratification.  As we neared Doug taking orders, I asked the line neighbors to sit with us. Kitten, Jean and Shawn, and Kyra and I selected our drinks (Kitten and I: Green River, Kyra: Sioux City Ginger Beer) and I went too secure a table while the others ordered.  We collectively ordered the following:  3 orders of rendered duck fat fries  A Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut (Rodger)  A Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel (Kyra)  An Elvis, a Polish prepared Chicago char style with additional items like sauteed onions and giardinera (Rodger)  A The Pete Shelley, a meatless Chicago style Dog (Kyra)  2 The Mountain Man Sausage (a damn tasty combination of Venison, Elk, Antelope and Buffalo) with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese (Kitten, Shawn)  Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Currant Dijonnaise, Port Wine Chicken Pate and Truffle-Balsamic Cream (Jean)  Smoked Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and Iberico Cheese (Jean)  Finally a Curry Lamb Sausage with Spinach Raita and Coolea Cheese. I tasted Kyras choices and mine. The Thai chicken sausage was perhaps the most amazing non Italian sausage I have ever tasted. The toppings made it divine. The Duck sausage was excellent, perhaps a bit subtle and sweet for my tastes. The Polish was crazy great, better than the Dear Franks char polish that was my current favorite. Finally, the vegetarian dog was excellent. Vegans, you can have an Authentic Chicago dog. You must not miss it!  The food was absolutely Divine. The duck fat fries were one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted; light crisp and flavor packed. That said, the dining partners really made the meal special.  Kyra is a singer songwriter with a day job in corporate communications, Kitten is an actress, writer, producer, Jean, Shawn and I are IT geeks of various flavors.

I've had rattlesnake, kangaroo, ostrich, bear, alligator, etc. Some of the aiolis/mustards/mayos are kinda weird (strawberry mustard is definitely a no-no), but overall the food is solid and Doug is awesome.",0.9395,0.798,0.14,0.062,0.5701631701631702

2010-02-03,5.0,"Oh, Doug. I am a true believer.  I've been to Hot Dougs several times, and each time I have something different. The menu changes on a weekly basis, so there's always new goodies to try.  There's also always about an hour long wait that wraps around the outside of the building if you go at peak meal times (yes, even in the freezing cold) so go prepared and dress appropriately. Also, I've never had their regular Chicago dog or the permanent menu items. I figure if I'm going to wait that long, I need to be waiting for something I can't get anywhere else.  I think the duck fat fries are a little overrated. They're a little too greasy for my liking, and the regular fries with the cheese sauce are so delicious I don't see the reason for paying extra for something that I can't even taste the difference in.  Keep in mind it's cash only. There are many times the group ahead or behind me noticies the ""Cash only"" sign at the register after waiting for an hour and have to run and find an ATM (which isn't available onsite).  Doug is always maning the cash register, and he's always super friendly. I mean, you would be too if your customers are forking over $8 (worth it)for a hotdog...in cash.

2010-01-31,5.0,"4.5 star rating, nearly 1,000 Yelp reviews - it seems kinda redundant to review this place, but it's also a Chicago institution and consistently ranked amongst the best eateries in the world. WORLD. By guys like, say, Bon Appetit. It's also a Food Network favourite - everyone from Man -vs- Food to die-hard New Yorker Anthony Bourdain dry-hump Doug's counter at some point in time. And you know when you see crowds of people - locals and food nomads, young and old, some still attached to IV drips from their escape from the hospital, some covered in barnacles - standing outside in a line for 2 hours in the snow to get a hot dog that something quite magical is about to occur. O, the magic. It's truly ridiculous - the concept that a couple can spend $30-$40 eating hot dogs (HOT DOGS!!1...actually, if you're going to stand in line for an hour+, you want the Total Hot Dog Experience - you deserve it) until you pop - why would you do this? It's a damn hot dog. But if you don't want to hug Doug (who serves counter, every day, always smiling and kind, a total sausage geek sweetheart, it's bloody madness) on the way out, you're doing it wrong. Go to  hotdougs.com  and look at the Specials page if you're still undecided. But there is absolutely no reason you should not be there, right now, eating encased meats. And it's truly a jewel of Chicago. They understand lamb. They have Game specials (always, always try their game specials). They are ingredient pioneers, championing and introducing classic world favourites for the Chicago crowd.  Like a great white shark at the bloated carcass of a month-dead sperm whale, your eyes will roll back in your head as you gurgle ""WTF is this tomf**kery?! It's a damn HOT DOG!?! How can it be SO. GOOD?!"" It's an unexpected high, staggeringly remarkable, and yes, worth standing in the snow for (tip: bring coffee). In fact, it's the only place my husband will queue for, ever. And that's saying a lot. My inner food snob is appalled that I've dished out 5 stars for a hot dog joint. My inner food snob can go f**k itself.

Went here with a couple friends and waited 2 hours in line on Friday morning of the Memorial Day weekend. Wow. Once we got in, Doug took our order and when one of the bussers saw that we were a group of 3, he cleared and saved a table for us. How nice!  I went with one of the specials - bacon sausage with creme fraiche caramelized onions and triple cream Brie cheese - and the dog with everything. We also shared an order of duck fat fries, which were yummy but not more special than any other kind of fries. Except that we waited 2 hours for them. Everything was delicious, although the bacon sausage dog I had was pretty rich....in a good way. The next time I come to Chicago, the long wait in line would make me think twice about taking another trip to Hot Doug's.

As I was walking to school one fine Thursday Morning, my bestest friend Ginger D., sends me a text stating we must satisfy our craving for greasy food. I voted 'Hot Doug's' as I saw the establishment on the Travel Channel's ""Hot Dog Paradise"" and have been itching to go for the last 6months! The promise of going to Hot Dougs kept me warm and happy through my morning classes and my walk home in 10degree weather.  We arrive at 'Hot Doug's' at 1:30ish pm on a Thursday- yes there was a small wait, of about 10min. While waiting to order we observed that there was a menagerie of people dining at Hot Doug's, eagerly lapping down their lunch. Our time to order had arrived- I was a little star struck to see Doug! He was very warm and patient when it took me a few minutes to decide how I wanted my Pete Shelly (the veggie dog) cooked- definitely not like some other hot dog places where they will YELL at you if you cannot spit your order out in 35seconds.  I decided on the flame grilled Pete Shelly, ketchup only and fries. My Pete Shelly was GOOD, the bun was light and tasty (NOT soggy), they did not skimp on my ketchup and the veggie dog was FLAMED GRILLED not ""burned through the skin"". The fries were good, a BAD bit below ""Five Guys"" quality fries but good none the less. ! I forgot to mention the price- a full, yummy tasty meal (1 Pete Shelly, 1 small fry and 1 small drink) for UNDER $6 cannot be beat. All prices include tax for those challenged by math ;) I have two other mini complaints, 1. NO bottled water! yes yes you can purchase a fountain soda and get water but its not the same and 2. CASH ONLY!!!!!!! For a girl that lives and breathes by her debt card this was very sad but thankfully I was aware before I embarrassed myself.  I love Hot Doug's!

2010-01-28,5.0,"I am at ease that I FINALLY got to try Hot Doug's. In fact, I think I might mark it on my calendar. Over the years, I have heard so many wonderful things about this place, but for reasons (mostly because they close at 4, and I work on Saturdays), I haven't been able to make it there.  So today was the day! Natalie M. and I went today, a Thursday afternoon at about 1:30pm. We thought that were were going to miss the lunch rush, but there was a wait. After about 10 minutes or so (not bad at all) it was finally our turn. Doug was very nice and very patient in taking our order. Natalie M. recognized him right away from all the exposure he's had on TV., however I recognized him from his BIG poster at Kendall College. The guy is a Chicago Culinary icon! You could tell that he loves his job and appreciates all the business. A lot of hot dog joints are extremely fast paced and you really have to be prepared to order, and you better order fast and NOT pause or else you might get chewed out. But not here. The whole experience is very pleasant and it's pretty calm.  So, we get our drinks and sit down at a table to wait for our food. Our two Pete Shelly's and fries come out in about 3 minutes. The buns were fresh and the dogs were big and flavorful! I loved the fresh, snappy pickle that was COLD (not flimsy and hot) that came on my dog. The relish was just about the best relish ever and complimented the dog very well. The only criticism I found was that the fries were a little too well done for me...idk to me, they were pretty dark.  I had a great lunch at Hot Doug's. I recommend that everyone go there to have a great dog and a great time. The prices are great, the food is delicious and it is definitely worth the wait! Hot Doug's seems to feed ALL types of people from all types of backgrounds, who belong to all social statuses. There were younger people, older people, businessmen and women and families.

2010-01-14,5.0,"I have been a fan of Hot Doug's since before the beginning... My wife used to work with Doug (back in the day, as they say), and we had the good fortune to run into him during his ""between days""...he was working for a caterer, and while he poured us champagne, he told us about this concept he had for a hot dog stand/sausage emporium.  We thought the name was catchy, and wished him good luck. but it's not luck that keeps us going back...it's the fabulous combination of great, friendly service, PHENOMENAL sausage combinations (more soon), and that great intangible, ambience, that makes Hot Doug's a must stop at place. I went this past Tuesday, with my two college sons home for the holidays (Doug's is a must stop whenever they're in town), and neighbor BBQ Dave.  In addition to a regular dog (charred, raw onions with the works incl. peppers) and Doug's best-in-class fresh French fries, I tried -- now get this -- a BACON SAUSAGE!  Man, what a treat!!  You like meat?  You like bacon??  You like sausage???  You got it, all rolled up into one smoky, pink juicy and cracklin' tube of encased enjoyment!!!!  Served on a sausage roll with beautifully carmelized onions, a bit of creme freche, and lovely slices of Camembert cheese....to steal the catchphrase of a local Oak Park chef, ""Oh...My...God!""  Absolutely sublime combination; the snap of the sausage combined PERFECTLY with the soft onions and melting cheese, the creme freche just adding a measure of silkiness (and an additional challenge to those arteries!).  Knocked my previous fave (Thai duck sausage with pickled daikon radish) right down to...number 2! But let's talk about ambience.  I was horking a handful of french fries (light, fluffy, not a hint of grease or slime, nicely brown and crispy, and BIG!), after being overcome with adulation for my bacon sausage...when the opening strains of Graham Parker's ""Discovering Japan"" blast out of the box.  Now, you kids in the audience may be saying ""who?"", but to the cognoscenti of late 70s/early80s rock (of which Doug is a board member), Mr. Parker and the Brinsley-Schwarz band put out some of the toughest, leanest, most cool music post-punk had to offer.  And ""Squeezing Out Sparks"" is my absolute fave Parker album!  And this, my friends, is ambience...it made a fantastically flavorful food experience even more delightful, knowing that not only is Doug the EFFING SAUSAGE KING-GOD, he's got great taste in music, too.  Seals the deal for me...why can't I give Hot Doug's 6 stars?!?!?

Also wanted to try the foie gras dog that got him in trouble during our year-long FG ban in Chicago. Good thing it was summer as we waited in a line of maybe 60 people out the door and around the block.  Waited so long I went and sat in our car for the last 1/2 hour, reading the newspaper, let my spouse keep our spot.  Finally got in the door one hour and 45 minutes later  to find out we were ""lucky""--it was 3:55pm and the line closes off at 4pm and then the resto itself closes as soon as the last of us are gone...and there were only 3 people behind us who made the cut.  Imagine waiting 1 hour and 40 minutes and then being told you couldn't get in...   Once inside, a lengthy menu of the most bizarre hot dog combos you can imagine.  Spouse ordered the famous foie gras and Sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris for $9. Ugh.  I mean, I love buttery cheesey things but this was sooooo over-the-top.  Mine was worse.  I had the Saucisson Alsacienne, which was bacon sausage with creme fraiche, caramelized onions and Camembert cheese for $8. It had a 3-inch thick slab of half-melted low-quality cheese on top.  Camembert does not go with hot dogs, believe me.  And the dogs themselves were puny, so the condiments are necessary to make you feel you actually ate something substantial.   The famous duck fat fries were totally boring and mundane, no better than ordinary fries, with some icky peel left on (I'm a purist, no peel on my french fries, please, just shows you're too lazy to peel).  Mickey D's fries are an order of magnitude better, certainly Gene and Jude's.  I cook with duck fat a lot (it's wonderfully tasty and actually a ""good"" fat), and it's great for roasting potatoes or veggies. So I know what duck fat potatoes should taste like.  These tasted like cardboard.   It was 5pm and a couple of double sawbucks before we got out of there, and we had left the house around 2pm. A lovely last touch: the staff was putting chairs on top of the tables and mopping the floor all around us with smelly stuff while we were finishing.

But when I had the afternoon off and figured not that many other people did, I jumped at the chance to bring my boyfriend for his first experience at Hot Doug's. Luckily, we only had to wait around 15-20 minutes. The key is to go on a weekday (non-holiday) and go around 1 pm or later. There will still be a line and it will still be busy, but it won't be a crazy wait.  I decided to splurge that day and go with the foie gras duck sausage... I know, I probably shouldn't be as it was banned before, but I had never tried foie gras before and figured I would try it once in my life at least. It was a good but very rich... I thought I would get sick after eating the whole thing, but thank goodness I didn't. It is definitely more of an acquired taste but I did like it. And of course, my favorite at Hot Doug's, is the fries with cheese sauce on the side. My boyfriend had the spicy pork sausage which he seemed to enjoy, and definitely loved the experience there with everything from having Hot Doug take our order old-school on a pad of paper to all the kitchy sausage and old rock decor.

The service is of course awesome. Doug Sohn, the demi-god of encased meat, is always behind the counter ready to take your order and guide you through the menu.  Not sure why they even sell a large soda since he will do his best to get you to order a medium and take free refills.  The folks brining out your food are efficient.  Despite the sometimes insane lines you never feel rushed once you enter into this sausage shangri-la. The one thing to be careful of when you enter there is not to have the ""mismatched buffet food"" effect hit you.  Think about when people eat at a huge all-you-can-eat buffet.  They come back to their table with a plate loaded with pizza, prime rib, sushi, and chocolate cake.  All good on their own, but not the right things to have together.  The choices here can cause a small version of that.  The spicy boar sausage for instance was so powerful that it overwhelmed the more subtly spiced or sweet-topping covered ones we had ordered.  Be careful with the order in which you eat the sausages, or just plan multiple trips, with a theme for each order! Waiting in line in the blowing snow on a winter's day with other people anxiously waiting to get inside felt like a bonding experience, something uniquely Chicago.  This place is worth waiting in the snow.  It is worth spending 2 hours in line on a pleasant summer day.  It is worth crawling on hands and knees over broken glass through the desert.  Anything to get to the counter and place an order for a Foie Gras dog with Duck Fat fries.",0.9794,0.86,0.117,0.023,0.5678164428164428
2009-12-26,5.0,"My colleague and I scoped this place out months in advance of attending a conference in Chicago, and it was one of our big food excursions while we were in town.  When we arrived, the line was down the block, and it ended up being about an hour wait. Totally worth it, though. I had perused the menu online earlier that day, and I decided I wanted both a more gourmet dog (the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage, with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris) and a more simple Elvis dog (smoked Polish sausage). And duck fat fries, of course. It was really hard to decide, though, because so many of the menu items sounded so tantalizing.  What really made this 5 stars was the service, believe it or not. When we finally arrived at the counter, I was worried that I didn't have enough cash to cover everything I wanted. I asked the guy at the counter how much it would be without the fries, because I wasn't sure if I had enough. He looked at me and said, don't be silly! Don't deprive yourself of duck fat fries just because of cash! We can work this out. I was like, um, OK, I guess I'll get the duck fat fries then. He didn't even use a cash register, he just eyeballed my order and said, eh, that looks like about $15. I'm sure it would have been more than that if he actually added it up, but I'm definitely not complaining. Later I found out that it was Doug Sohn, the owner himself. He also talked me down from a medium drink to a small since there were free refills. What a nice guy! As we sat down to eat, the staff was very friendly, asking us if there was anything we needed, taking our trash, etc. They run this place very efficiently and seem to manage the crowds well.  The foie gras dog was decadent and perhaps even a little too over the top, because it was hard to taste the duck sausage what with everything else going on. But that simple smoked Polish dog was sheer perfection. I'm glad I ordered both, because it gave me the chance to try both sides of the coin (not to mention I wolfed both down so fast, if I had only gotten one I would still have been hungry, and that would have meant getting back in the hour-long line).

2009-12-16,3.0,"After a year of reading rave reviews about Hot Doug's, I finally had a moment and I checked it out today.  It was 10 degrees. Pretty cold if you ask me. My toes are still frozen! I waited in line with an unemployed lawyer and a culinary school student - very delightful people who helped me figure things out before we got to the register. I believe I waited about 20 or 30 minutes but the line was short so most of it was in the vestibule and inside the joint.  Doug was very courteous as were all of his employees. He runs a tight shift. Very organized. I ordered a grilled dog with everything and sport peppers, fries and the gourmet sausage: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris ($9.00 - pretty pricey but I really wanted to try Foie Gras). Now, I really love liver, I understand Foie Gras is very different than you everyday, run of the mill fried liver, but this, really wasn't good. I think I hurried into the extreme and I should of taken it slow and tried a fire dog or something on the regular menu before moving to such advanced culinary delights. Totally un-delightful for me. Didn't care for the sausage at all. There was something off about it. Not sure. I can't really compare to any other times since this was a first for me.  The Dog though was great! The sport peppers were so perfect and the fries were really good too. I like the ketchup bottles at the table so that I can pour as much as possible on my fries. Yum!  Why 3 stars?

2009-11-18,5.0,"On a rainy Wednesday when I called in sick from work,  I ended up having one of the best food experiences of my life.   I woke up this morning with my body feeling like a big fat bruise. I was nauseated and achy. The cold and rainy weather reflected exactly how I felt, Shitty!!!. On this dreary day, I did something that I very rarely do. I called in sick to work. I crawled back into bed for some quiet, blissful sleep.  I woke up around noon totally famished. And I was hungry for something that I swore off as a kid.  I actually had a craving for a  Hot Dog.   You have to understand that I ate so many hot dogs as a kid, that I rarely crave them as an adult. During the summers of my youth, you could find me at one of two places. At one of my little league games, or at Wrigley Field. Needless to say, I ate so many Hot Dogs and Brats that I wanted to name my first born Frankfurter.   We first did a drive by of Hot Doug's to see how long the line was. To our surprise, there was nobody waiting outside. As we entered, the line was about 10 deep. The line moved surprisingly fast. We had our food in 10 minutes. When we got to the counter, we got to meet Hot Doug himself (Doug Sohn). Doug took Carolynne's order and then asked what Derrek Sanderson would like. He obviously noticed my Boston Bruins cap. He made a great first impression by mentioning one of my favorite hockey players of all time. After talking hockey for a few minutes, he took our order. I ordered the Dave Kingman Dog and (one of the daily specials) the Mole, Smoked Chicken Sausage.   The Kingman Dog was a spicy, Chicken Sausage that was packed with Flavor. The Caramelized onions were a nice touch. The Mole Chicken Sausage was out of this world. It was covered with a spicy Mole Sauce with pepper jack cheese. We also split an order of fries. Hot Doug's doesn't offer the fries made in goose oil during the week, but I can't imagine them being much better than the fries that we had. They were hand cut fries that were tender and delicious.   The highlight of the meal for me was sampling some of Carolynne's Foie gras Dog. Other than the controversial ban by the City of Chicago, I had never even heard of the stuff. But the creamy liver sausage blew me away. It was a wonderful slice of decadence.   I have always believed that there was a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The strange combination of sausages and toppings at Hot Doug's walks that line. I have always been amazed by how some Chefs can come up with different combinations of food that you would never even dream of. And the great ones can turn it into a delicacy.  If there was a Nobel Prize for Cased Meat, Hot Doug's gets my nomination.   The Bottom line is this. If you have not been to Hot Doug's, get your ass over there. What have you been waiting for?  Don't worry about the line, it moves faster than you think. You will not get a better dining experience for your hard earned dollar. This place is a Gem, and a must visit for any foodie in Chicago.",0.9869,0.832,0.112,0.057,0.6113756613756614

""It's great to see you again, Doug. Kate says hi. So... well... um, last time I visited, I still ate meat, but now I don't. Is there any way I can order one of the special sausages but get a veggie dog instead? I'll pay the price for the special!"" Without hesitation, the ever-friendly Doug replied, ""Why would you do that? You can pay the price of a veggie dog. What would you like?"" The Pete Shelley (AKA veggie) is only $2.75. Doug is a saint! After some friendly hassling from Doug about ""when I'd be coming back over from the dark side,"" I ordered the Pete Shelley with apple chutney and manchego cheese.  Although I did miss the heartiness of a real-meat sausage, these ingredients could make anything taste like heaven. Whether this was meant to be boar, rabbit, or dinosaur, it likely would've been a little juicier with some animal fat, but the cheese and chutney were really tasty.  I also ordered the Pete Shelley with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Burning Nettles Smoked Gouda Cheese.  Again, a veggie dog is a little slight for such a big bun, but I paid under $3 for some awesome ingredients. Good show, old chap. ...and of course, cheese fries (minus the duck fat). These chips are cooked in, um, regular fat? My heart might have stopped momentarily after ingesting maybe half of these, but that didn't stop them from being delicious. Jim, being the meat fanatic that he is, was like a kid in a candy store... Or like a man in a sausage store. He ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. In honor of this great city, he also ordered a traditional Chicago dog... and how could he resist the duck fat fries? Hot Doug's is a serious must for all that call themselves Chicagoans. It's not in the most convenient location in the city, and there will definitely be a wait, but it's well worth it. Hot Doug's never disappoints.",0.9958,0.835,0.139,0.026,0.5226066726066726

Being very critical of our hot dogs we had discussion about whether this actually beats out Top Dog from the San Francisco area. I will have to admit that Hot Dougs comes up on top here. Everything we had was oh so yummy. We pretty much tried out half the menu or more.  One of the ladies ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. This thing is super good, but really heavy.

2009-11-01,4.0,"Okay, so, being from Los Angeles, the hot dogs here are done one of two ways: relish, mustard, ketchup and maybe some jalapenos. . .and then there's the ghetto dog way. . .the link wrapped in bacon and grilled on a baking sheet on top of a shopping cart by a Mexican in downtown LA.  It's then piled high with grilled onions, peppers, and what else, but a giant jalapeno.  Oh and the bun is rolled around in the bacon grease to make it extra delectable. So when I came to Chicago, even as a dog lover, I was a little hesitant at first to try the dogs here.  Pickle, onions (bleh), tomato, and CELERY SALT?  That's some crazytalk man.  But I mean, it's a Chicago staple, you've got to try it.  So my friend and I, being crazy foodies, decided to take the metro, transfer twice, and take a bus all the way to Hot Doug's for some of the best (we've heard) dogs in the city. After a 90 min trek. . .we made it.  The line was wrapped around the building, but there were empty seats inside.  Apparently the owner won't let you sit before you eat!  But that ensures that everyone who orders food will get to sit and enjoy their meal!  And even though this method doesn't seem to make logical sense at first, somehow it all works out. My friend and I, between the two of us, ordered five dogs: The Dog w/ everything ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ) Shrimp and Pork Sausage with goat cheese ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ),  the Marty Allen w/ everything ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ), the Atomic Bomb aka spicy sausage with pepperjack cheese ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ) and the Saucisson Alsacienne aka bacon sausage with double cream brie ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ). . .oh and of course, an order of small fries.  The owner took our order, and I have to say, he is the nicest dude and super efficient.  He approved my ordering The Dog with everything on it. Out of all the fancy dogs I had that day, I actually preferred The Dog.  I loved the crunchy pickle, the sweet onions, the juicy tomato and the celery salt. . .yum.  I thought the Saucisson Alsacienne was super rich, especially since it was piled high with creamy brie, and the Atomic Bomb was quite spicy as well.  I mean, I love cheese and all, but I think I got a near overload, since halfway through the meal, my buddy and I were eating the hot dogs sans the cheese. I would definitely come back again. . .even though the bill was crazy. . .I think the five dogs and small fries plus two sodas set us back maybe 45 bucks!  Insane, but the food was great, the store and service were good and they also have some interesting soda brands in the fridge!",0.9976,0.771,0.18,0.049,0.530609756097561
2009-10-31,5.0,"Moved to Chicago, felt I owed it to myself to try Hot Doug's, now make it a fairly regular occasion.  Yes, it is worth the wait.  A 2 hour wait?  No.  30 minutes or less?  Consider such a small line a gift from the gods, get in line and prepare to be amazed. If you are coming here solely to try a Chicago-style hot dog for the first time, I would recommend going someplace else.  Doug does make a mighty fine hot dog with all the trimmings (though you must specify if you want sport peppers), but that is not the real draw of this place.  I've always had fantastic experiences with his Chicago dogs, Brats, Thuringers, and all the other sausage staples that he offers, but one truly owes it to one's self to order the Game Of The Week.  Take a game animal sausage, such as elk, antelope, or rabbit, add a sauce and cheese that are paired specifically to that sausage, and you have a truly magnificent gastronomic experience.  The best I've had is the spicy smoked alligator sausage with Cajun Remouillade sauce and St. Pete's blue cheese.  It is easily one of the top five meals of my life.  It seems preposterous to many that something as simple as sausage could be this delicious, but this isn't yer brudder Bill's Poolish Sahssidge from da Jool's.  Doug takes his craft very seriously, and he loves his job.  I'm sure he gets tired of the endless droves of people at the counter every day who still can't make up their minds despite ample decision-making time while waiting in line, but he sure hides it well.  His great service, friendly wait staff and all-around great atmosphere (plus the mind-blowingly great food) make this an essential Chicago establishment.  If I ever find it in myself to open a restaurant, I'm going to have a talk with him.  He has obviously done something right. If you're from out of town and you want to try a Chicago-style hot dog, there are certainly quicker and equally satisfying places to do so.  But if you're serious about sausage, Hot Doug's is crucial.",0.9977,0.756,0.217,0.028,0.5850142007750705

2009-09-06,4.0,"Hot Doug's is probably the most overhyped Hot Dog establishment in not only Chicago, but quite possibly the entire world. The outrageously large number of reviews and the two hour wait mentioned in each of them is evidence enough. However, that is to be expected when you open a hot dog place that, rather than trying to compete with thousands of other restaurants in the city for best wiener, serves various types of sausages from various different animals that you probably won't find anywhere else within driving distance. If anything, Hot Doug's is mostly just a victim of its own success at establishing a niche in the hot dog infested city of Chicago. Even if you manage to get here early, the long wait is practically inevitable. During my experience, it was pretty hard for me and my friends to fathom what could possess all of these people to wait so long (in the middle of the winter no less) for a hot dog?  But make no mistake, once you overcome the long wait and encounter a surprisingly friendly Doug Sohn (who has to serve thousands of hungry customers a day), it's pretty easy to forget about the wait and get right down to business. If it's your first time, regardless of whatever else you order, you might as well order yourself a regular Chicago Hot Dog. It was good, no doubt, but why I waited in line for two hours. It is in fact the specials that everyone is coming for, ranging from the fatty duck sausage with foie gras mousse and truffle oil to the lean Rattlesnake sausage with cheese. Oh, and of course the highly famed fresh cut duck fat french fries, which were easily some of the best fries I have ever eaten. But regardless of how sensational the food is, it may be hard to justify such a long wait. Part of the reason that the wait is as big as it is is due to the relatively small location. With this much success, I would think it is time for Doug to consider expanding perhaps? All in all, you should definitely brave the wait at least once just to see what the hype is all about, but regardless, make sure you come prepared. Hot Doug's has many other odd perks besides the long wait, such as rather short opening hours, constantly changing specials, and closings on even the most minor of holidays. And of course, the duck fat fries are only served on Fridays and Saturdays for whatever reason. Thankfully, their website is updated daily with this type of information.

Wanting to try as much as possible I ordered a regular hot dog, an Italian sausage, and had the man at the counter pick one off their special list for me. He surprised me with the foie gras dog. I told the man to fix all the dogs as if he were making them for his family.  I wasn't disappointed. I began with the regular dog which upon seeing it wasn't sure on my plan of attack. It took the steadiness of a jenga expert to balance the pickle, tomato, and peppers. The dog was amazing. From the very first bite I knew Chicago wasn't serving your ordinary Oscar Meyers. The flavors from all the toppings melded into something magical. The second one to go was the Italian sausage. Crazy deliciousness. Just the right amount of spices in the sausage and so good I ate it too fast to tell you what they put on top. The final leg of my hot dog trek was the unknown foie gras dog. I've only herd about the fatty liver from shows like Top Chef and I was about it eat it for the first time on a hot dog. The sausage along with the foie gras and the creamy sauce on top make for something toe curling. First, foie gras to me was like a creamy well seasoned rich butter.

2009-09-03,5.0,"Doug is such a nice guy! My fiance and I arrived at the Hot Doug's counter fishing out smashed dollar bills from our pockets to see if we had enough to buy two of the speciality dogs. It was the ""Doug"" himself at the counter who told us it would be no problem if we didn't have quite enough. I didn't really think he was serious and proceeded to count out the money. It turned out that we did have enough for the dogs. He then asked us if we wanted fries or drinks and of course we said ""no and no""--since we didn't have the money (either with us or in our bank accounts). Doug then asks us if we would have wanted fries if we had had enough money. We mechanically (and enthusiastically) said yes.  At this point, I actually started counting out the remaining two dollars and change to see if we had might just have enough for some fries. I didn't have to. God...I mean, Doug, immediately says that we will be getting fries with our food and then tells us to help ourselves to drinks...for free! He does this without a moment's hesitation! Wha'??? I mean, WHO THE HECK does that these days? WHO!?!?!????  I was really touched at what an amazingly nice guy he was and how disinterestedly generous he was. Judging from the amount of people in there he could probably afford it. But still, it is almost unheard of for people to be that generous these days. Needless to say Hot Doug's is a wonderful place, with great people,  very cool atmosphere, and obviously the hot dogs are dee-licious. Thank you Doug for being so nice to us.

We made sure we got there when they opened so we could avoid the crowds. It took about 15 minutes :) We tried the regular brat, foie gras duck sausage and the selma hayk which is the andouille sausage with fries. I was so excited to try the foie gras duck and sadly i was very disappointed. First i couldnt believe I was dropping $9 for a ""hot dog"". Second, it didnt even taste that great.

2009-09-03,5.0,"After an unexpected moving truck breakdown, I found myself deserted by my friends while waiting in a lengthy queue to try the famous homemade sausages at Hot Doug's.  While I generally find the idea of standing in any type of line revolting, I was lucky enough to find myself in the company of three friendly strangers who were equally obsessed with national food travel.  We explored various culinary options across the United States while offering our personal experiences in cities such as Las Vegas, Seattle, Austin, New York, and New Orleans.  Coupled with parking disasters and people whining about the queue, their company dramatically sped up the process.    On a number of occasions, I had to check my cell phone to determine whether SG's movers had arrived.  One of the strangers noted, ""If you check that cell phone while you are at the counter, I think you should have to go back to the end of the line.  I countered, ""If I check my cell phone when I get to the front of the line, I shouldn't be allowed back in the line.""  Smiles abounded.  It's easy to make friends.    I was next in line.  Time to play a practical joke.  ""Hello?  Hey SG!!!!""  I looked back at the strangers and smiled.  No, I'm not that asshole.    Hot Doug's is not the type of place where you dally around with your order.  I was ready.  My order consisted of the following: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris ($9.00), White Wine Rabbit Sausage with Sauce Moustards, Goat Cheese, and Spicy Calabrese Peppers ($6.50), Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Smokey Blue Cheese ($8.50), Chicago Grilled Hot Dog with Relish, Dill Pickle, Onions, Mustard, and Ketchup ($1.75), Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds ($8.00), and Duck Fat Frites ($3.25).   On my way back to SG's place, I started snacking on the duck fries.  While the fries were tasty, I was hoping for each bite to be oozing in duck fat.  That simply was not the case.  While nearly everyone on Yelp glorifies these fries, I would pass on them for the regular cheese fries on a subsequent visit. We started with the duck sausage.  It should be mentioned from the outset that even without the condiments, the different sausages used at Hot Doug's are extraordinarily flavorful.  The use of the natural sea salt and the allegedly banned in Chicago foie gras was a nice touch, but the truffle aioli is what carried this particular hot dog.  It meshed perfectly with the gamey flavors of the duck.   Even more outstanding was the expertly spiced rabbit sausage.  The spicy mustards and pepper were properly doused with the pairing of the goat cheese.  The result was an excellent meledy for the wine-doused rabbit.  Both the duck sausage and the rabbit sausage were superb, but it is the rabbit sausage that will keep me talking about Hot Doug's for decades.  Who knew a hot dog could be so decadent?   I should have avoided the crawfish on principle alone.  First, it was called crayfish.  What is the hell is that?  Crawdads, yes.  Crawfish, yes.  Crayfish?  Hell no.  Second, and more important than a simple nomenclature issue, crawfish is out of season.  So this one had that going against it as well.  While this particular pork sausage had the nice flavors of an Andouille from New Orleans, the flavor combination of a poorly made remoulade with out-of-season crawfish made for a slightly underwhelming experience.   Hot Doug's thoroughly redeemed itself, however, with the Chicago Dog.  We ordered ours grilled with all the toppings.  I suggest you do the same.  The dill pickle gives a satisfying textural crunch and slightly sour taste to complement the Dog.  At less than $2 per hot dog, these are an absolute steal.   While I was quite full by the time I reached the Blue Cheese flavored pork sausage covered in creme fraiche and almonds, it was still delightful.  The use of almond with pork sausage was a new concept.  I liked the marriage of traditional English flavors with cuisine from the Heart of Dixie all in the heartland of America.  It was enough to make Churchill swoon.    If you are in the Chicago area, I would strongly suggest that you brave the line and try at least two flavored dogs and perhaps two of the regular ones.  If you are local, it would be a nice place to take a group of six and just sample a ton of nicely flavored meats.  Then head over to Kuma's Corner and finish yourself off with a nice burger.  Then diet for the rest of the month.  Then repeat.  I love Hot Doug's.  Looking forward to another visit in the near future.",0.9973,0.833,0.128,0.038,0.518760553172318

Even there is a considerable line up outside, Doug himself always makes a point of greeting each customer with the same care, energy, enthusiasm as he does for the one prior which is no small feat.

Not enough lamb flavour in the sausage, personally. The raita is a bit bland. Would have been better if it was a lamb sausage with garlic spinach yogurt sauce or something. 3) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris - the king of them all - The foie matched well with the truffled aioli and sausage.

Delectable and less than $2 - a much better deal and better tasting than the dogs you get on the street venders (who charge you $3.50). 6) Elk sausage 7) Duck fat fries (available only Fri/Sat) - not enough duck fat to really get the flavor into the fries.

AWESOME!!!  I have been going here for years now.  Expect to wait a long time to even get into the place.  I drove by it last week and it was open for twenty minutes and the line was already along the side of the building to the alley.  For those who frequent the place, you know what I am talking about.   When the hubby and I decide that we will wait for hot dogs ( and you will for at least an hour depending on the time of day), we always look on our iPhone to see what the specials are.  We read them separately and then discuss what we may possibly get.  If anyone listened to our conversation, they would think we would never to able to make up our minds.  All the specialty dogs look great and you just never know which one will be THE one.  We both tend to get a Chicago Dog, the classic, and a specialty.  And of course, DUCK FAT FRIES.  Yes, fries fried in rendered duck fat is worth the clogged arteries, the spike in your cholesterol and ultimately, a heart attack.  But wouldn't that be a great way to go?  They only are served Friday and Saturday so that of course will add additional time to your wait.  But trust me when I say that they are worth whatever wait it is.   The owner, Doug, takes your order.  I love this.  This is a guy who takes pride in his dogs and his work.  He is always pleasant which can be difficult when you have a line down the street.  They are also pretty strict about saving tables.  You can't.  Only when you order your food can you then sit down at a table or the counter.  Every time I go there, it is always the same two people dropping food at the tables.  When you order your food with Doug (cash only!!!), there is a tip jar next to him.  Drop money in there.  It is hard work for the two servers to get the tables cleaned and drop food off when it's busy from open to close.  They deserve the tip so don't be cheap! With that said, the food speaks for itself.  We always bring people from out of town here after they agree to waiting.  No has yet been disappointed.  This is a place that is a must stop, must experience if you travel to Chicago.  It is that good.",0.9881,0.821,0.12,0.059,0.579983660130719

Both were good and good size, but I preferred the fois gras. It wasn't too heavy and the duck sausage was actually very tasty. The Ribeye was good too but not my favorite. The duck fat fries were great. Really, nothing more to say there. I even got a Chicago dog to take home for my dad. Service is great, Doug takes your order, answers questions and helps you get the best tasting dog possible.

If you're visiting and want to try a Chicago hot dog, for the love of god, just find any place that uses Vienna Beef (a lot of places will have the Vienna Beef sign on the window), 'cause that's what makes the Chicago hot dog better than any other.

The Dog (Chicago-style hot dog) - the best thing I had here by far, but the same dog you'll find in most Chicago hot dog joints The Mountain Man: Elk, Venison, Buffalo and Antelope with Cassis Butter and Coolea Cheese - the dog was a little dry and flavorless; who would trust the palate of a mountain man, anyway? Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Truffle Sauce Moutarde, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris - this was only so-so, and proof that truffles can't save everything; as befitting such a hoighty toighty dog, once you get past the fancy description, there's really not that much substance Calvados-Infused Smoked Duck Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey - this was decent; if you don't like spice, avoid this dog ...

At the risk of sounding like a Yelp/Food Channel/Bourdain victim, I made Hot Doug's a dining destination on my trip to Chicago.  Luckily, the delightful Ellen M. was willing to meet me and accompany me on this pilgrimage. Good thing, because there is a huge line.  HUGE line.  Like down the block, and we were there before noon.  And if you know me, you know that I don't wait in lines.  Well, this is a place that warrants it, so grab a friend, get there early, and strike up some conversation. I think we were expecting more of a Soup Nazi experience (order, move down, pay, leave) and less of a casual, unhurried, accommodating vibe.  Doug was at the counter, nice as can be, and we ordered, paid and grabbed a table right under the uber-cool hot dog clock.  There is also an outdoor patio, but you can't check out all of the hot dog paraphernalia from there.  I'm a big fan of hot dog kitsch. I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris.  Legend has it that during the famous foie gras ban in Chicago, Doug's would continue to serve this delicacy and simply pay the $250 fine every month.  Did I mention that I loved Doug?  Oh and the sausage was divine - as if they had somehow captured a fine dining dish between two halves of a bun. Ellen M. had the Cherry & Apple Pork Sausage with Sweet Cherry Mustard, Goat Cheese, and Rum-Soaked Dried berries, which was heavenly.  What a great combination - and again, worth every penny of the $8 price. Ellen's adorable mini-me had a regular hot dog, and if you are going to have one of these, be sure to check the options menu and know how you want it before ordering (grilled or steamed, condiments, etc).   Great variety of drinks, including Dr. Brown's Celery and Cherry sodas.

The Uber Garlic Sausage 2.  The Duck Sausage with Foie Gras 3.  The Paul Kelly 4. The Elvis 5. The Ribeye with horseradish 6.  The Saucisse de Toulouse with Goat Milk butter I have to say that everyone should try the top two.  I LOVED them.  The Uber garlic sausage was like a dream come true for me as I'm a garlic lover.  I love huge chunks of roasted garlic and had no idea that it would go so perfectly with Pork Sausage.  The duck sausage with foie gras mousse was incredible.  The taste of the sausage was juicy and bloody and the mousse was the perfect creamy foil to the hot sausage.  No description will do it justice, you just have to try it.  It's also worth going on Friday and Saturday to try the fries that were fried in rendered duck fat, but on those days expect an even longer wait.   I think your best bet to avoid the wait would be to go on a Monday and be there half an hour before open.  Forget about showing up right before close because I witnessed personally that the line does not die down as you reach 4 PM.  I think you probably will have a better chance going early.  I do not regret waiting because the sausages are world class and different from everything you've ever had before.  The opportunity to try wild game is one that should not be passed.

This was the final stop on a whirlwind tour of Chicago eateries.  What better way to end the dawg expedition by playing hide the sausage - and it took 2 and a half hours to do it.  Whew, and am I tired.  We arrived at Doug's at 1pm and at 3:30pm we met Doug who personally takes each and every order.  This place is all about the exotic combination of sausage meats (I won't quote the motto because the other 800+ reviews of this place say it), but it's also about all the friends you make in line while waiting a frickin' hell of a long time.  There were over 300 tourists and 2 locals crazy enough to wait over 2.5 hours for these links.  One local, David S., was very helpful in explaining what to get and all the scenarios on what to expect and do inside.  He summarized it pretty well:  ""Doug's has the meats, Superdawg has the neon signs.""  So here's the 9-step process: 1) Wait, wait, wait, kneel down, lay down, wait, wait... 2) Wait some more... (if you're near the dumpsters it's a 2 hour wait) 3) Have a hell of a hard time deciding what you want... 4) Talk with Doug.  He calculates the total price and tells you... 5) Your jaw drops and hopefully you have enough cash... 6) You go sit down... 7) 4 minutes later they bring your dawgs... 8) Spend 20-30 minutes savoring all your choosings. 9) Spend another 10 minutes saying good-bye to everyone you met.   What keeps people coming back is the weekly changing specialty encased meats menu.  So all those sausages mentioned above could be completely different next week (except for th Elvis - he'll live forever with a Pocketful of Rainbows) We actually got lucky in that we went on Friday.  Only on Fridays and Saturdays do they have ""Duck Fat Fries"" ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ) - What's that?  You heard me... The perfect thinly cut potatoes deep fried in Duck Fat.  They don't taste strange - they are just an awesome discovery of golden-brown crisp heaven.  A large-size can easily satisfy 3 people and at $3.50 - what a deal! The goods with Duck Fat Fries:  ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ) More goods:  ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ) More goods:  ( yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… ) From the pics, the dawgs look of normal size, but it was hella-difficult to finish two of these per person.  So even though a dawg is quite expensive, it does make for a rich filling meal.  Waiting 2.5 hours is extremely excessive, but what an experience of aromas, textures and tastes.  Hot Doug's is only open Monday through Saturday, 10:30am - 4:00pm.  So due to the limited hours - you will be stuck in a line.  It is as good as it gets in the dawg-eat-dawg world!

2009-08-10,4.0,"There were many times where I passed by Hot Doug's and saw the line outside wrapping around the building and thought, ""Man, that's intimidating.""  The day I decided to go to Hot Doug's was this past Saturday during 2pm.  Not only was it extremely hot outside, but  I felt like I should have brought a folding chair with me.  Luckily, there was an ice cream man selling water outside so no one was getting dehydrated!  When we finally got to the counter to order it was like a relief.  What's so cool is that the owner, Doug Sohn, is there to take your order and he is so so so so nice.   Once my almost 2 hours of waiting outside was done and we finally got our food, I was starving.  We ordered the Celebrity Sausage of the day which was a Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Goat Cheese.  This was my favorite because the sausage and remoulade had a nice spice and the goat cheese smoothed that out nicely! Another delicious pick was the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds.  Lastly, we finished our hot dog adventure with the Swiss Cheese Smoked Knackwurst with Smoked Paprika Mayonnaise and Smoked Provolone Cheese.  This was a good smoky taste, but I didn't like this one nearly as much as I liked the other two. Since it was Saturday, of course you have to get an order of the duck fat fries.  They were good.  I don't think they were as delicious as the hot dogs we had, but you have to try them.  There was so much food at the table that the fries couldn't be finished.   I had a great time, despite the hellish line.  Next time, I will remember to go during the fall and bring a chair.  :)",0.9976,0.755,0.224,0.021,0.63046875

My first impression when driving past Hot Doug's? - ""This place must be good."" At 10:30 am (opening time), on a Monday mind you, there was a line already out the door. I had no idea what to expect at hot doug's so while waiting in line i opened up yelp and the rest is history. I was expecting your run-of-the-mill good hot dog; just your standard beef/pork frank with the fixins. I couldn't have been more wrong. Doug was working the counter and took my and every single persons order in the most polite, friendly manner I honestly have ever seen apart from 5-Star restaurants (but even then you know its not sincere). I had the game of the week and the celebrity of the week. Unbelievable flavors you would never expect out of a hot dog(encased meats to be correct). Honestly, all I have to say is: BELIEVE THE HYPE. Go out of your way for Hot Doug's. PS- I later found out Anthony Bourdain listed HD as 1 of the places to eat before you die.

The sausages and toppings were unique and tasty.  The infamous duck fat fries were good but somewhat disappointing - they were like good, regular fries today.  I actually had to check with server if we got the right fries, as I guess I was expecting more fattiness for $3.50 per serving. We tried 6 sausages - veggie sausage (you almost wouldn't notice), bacon and cheddar elk (interesting gamey taste and firm texture), chicken sausage sante fe style (actually best value at $3.50), shrimp/pork sausage with goat cheese (my favorite), mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken and gouda cheese (least favorite, strong on the cheese and mustard),  and fois gras and duck sausage (very rich, but very good!).

2009-08-05,5.0,"Having heard that Doug's frequently generates a 1-2 hour line shortly after opening we decided to check out the hot dog scene first - arriving at 11:00am (only 30 minutes after opening) this proved to be a good call as the line was already 30 persons deep (a far cry from the 60+ waiting when we left.)  Waiting in line all we heard was locals discussing how it was ""totally worth it"" and raving about previous experiences with Doug's specialty encased meats and (Friday and Saturday only) Duck Fat Fries.  Chatting with the friendly crowd our 45 minute wait brushed by and we soon found ourselves standing in front of the big board of common and not-so-common choices. Kitschy décor aplenty and Doug himself managing the register we approached and placed our orders - each of which was ""approved"" by Doug who, despite the lines, was personable and pleasant telling us about some of his button collection and making suggestions on whether each choice should be fried or broiled - heck, he didn't even laugh at my mother's request for a ""plain hotdog"" - but I certainly did.  Taking our seats and listening to the radio we filled our sodas and waited about 10 minutes before our orders arrived. Starting first with my aunt's and mother's boring orders - namely a plain hotdog and duck fat fries for my mother and an Elvis (Polish Sausage with tomato and onion) for my aunt.  Additionally ordered by my aunt as a more adventurous option was the Teuben of Corned Beef Sausage with Russian Dressing, Saurkraut, Swiss Cheese.  As I do not consume beef I did not taste any of these options but all three were noted to be ""awesome"" by the ladies and the duck fat fries were quite good with their crispy exterior giving way to a soft and fluffy center - while not as good as Michael Mina's signature fries I think this was likely more due to the lack of designer ketchups than the actual fries. The next duo of dogs, ordered by my sister - an absolute hater of hotdogs in general and a naysayer walking into the experience - was the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut and the Saucisson Alsacienne of Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions, Double Cream Brie.  First digging into the Thai option both my sister and myself were very impressed by the subtle nuances encased in the meat - namely a great degree of heat that was tempered well by the creaminess of the peanut butter and coconut fats.  While not exactly ""authentic Thai"" or an ""authentic hotdog,"" I liked the encased meat more than either.   The second selection, entitled a bacon sausage was decidedly more fatty than the chicken sausage and reminded me more of jowl bacon or porkbelly than a true piece of bacon.  Akin to Chang's pork buns at Momofuku in texture the fatty pork's saltiness paired well with the sour crème fraiche while the savory and pungent onions proved an excellent foil to the sweet and hearty helping of brie.   While my sister wasn't particularly thrilled with the texture of this option, I found it to be quite excellent and gladly helped her out with finishing the dog. For my options, two dogs were selected - namely the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse, Sel Gris and the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Goat Cheese.  Beginning with the Shrimp/Pork option I was instantly struck by the impressive manner in which the pig and the shrimp worked together - smoky and well blended in texture the dish was further enhanced by the remoulade and hefty helping of goat cheese which created an almost gumbo flavor with a bit of heat and a whole lot of savory saltiness.   The final item - the piece de resistance for myself - was indeed the Foie Dog; not since The Bazaar's Foie Cotton Candy with Corn Nuts had I seen a more obscure way to use the most decadent of all foods.  Presented as a sizable piece of terrine atop a sublime duck sausage with the classical flavors of sauternes built right in the dish was put even further over the top by the addition of crunchy grey salt and a creamy and aromatic truffle cream aioli.  At $9 the sausage certainly wasn't cheap, but it was oh-so-worth it. With tax, tip, and drinks the family ended up walking out of Doug's full, happy, and smiling for less than $15 a person - something I don't think we ever expected from ""a hotdog joint.""  Kitschy décor (check out the bathrooms,) an incredible down-to-earth owner, and top notch food.  Having waited in lines for other ""hype"" restaurants in many other cities I can definitely say Hot Doug's lives up to the substantial hype.  Perhaps the two best words in the English language are indeed ""Encased meats"" - provided those meats are of the quality of Doug's!",0.9982,0.848,0.126,0.025,0.5245552066980637

I don't know who Doug's PR guy is, but as if the lines weren't long enough, Anthony Bourdain recently put this on his short list of ""places to eat before you die"", up there with Le Bernadin and French Laundry!  This kind of great PR means the lines around Doug's have slowly gotten longer and longer.  Doug *really* needs to expand.  I mean it's great he takes everyone's order personally and the banter he has with the customers is part of the experience, but at some point the +hour long wait starts to become a major deterrent to coming here as a regular.  Is it even practical to be a regular here? The duck fat fries are awesome, but over-hyped.  They're great, but not so much greater than regular old fries.  The foie gras duck sausage was just OK (though I loved how Doug fought the city's inane ban on foie gras and continued to serve it).  The Thuringer and Italian sausage are just awesome.  One day I'll have to actually order a regular hot dog, but it's hard to wait for an hour and just get a regular dog.  And that's the problem now.  You could never just ""pop in"" at this place, but with all the extra hype of the last couple years you actually have to plan a whole afternoon just to come to grab a bite.",0.9902,0.769,0.152,0.079,0.4456478793742946

On a recent Friday, I took my 73-year-old hot dog/pizza loving Michigan residing mother to Hot Doug's. I took her here knowing full well that after her quad bypass a few yrs ago, the last thing her heart dr said to her was ""Remember, Jean, the two worst things a heart patient can eat are hot dogs and pizza."" So what did I do during her visit?  I took her to Palermo's on 95th one night and Hot Doug's 18 hours later. We waited 80 mins in line down the block in 80 degree heat. She never complained - in fact, we bonded. And all the while my vegetarian friends were texting me, ""Don't do it! Leave now! Don't get the duck fat fries, either. You are killing your mother."" As I am neither Jewish nor Catholic, I do not possess one modicum of guilt. However, as we approached Doug to place our order, I did do one thing he has probably never seen a customer do.

My mom loved her Elvis sans her usual ketchup - a Polish sausage ""Smoked and savory - just like the King"".

I recently went to Chicago to visit a high school friend.  When she asked me what were some of the ""Chicago"" things that I wanted to see and do the first thing on my list was Hot Doug's.  I told her I didn't care how long I had to wait or how far away it was; I wanted those wonderful encased meats in my belly.  I think I about jumped through the roof when she told me she only lived about 5 blocks from it.  I arrived in the evening on Thursday and we decided we would get up early on Friday and try to beat the line.   We arrived at 10:48am and started at the back of the brick building.  Luckily it was a cooler day, about 80 degrees, and the line actually moved fairly quickly.  We reached the counter at 11:38am (40 minutes, not too bad of a wait for the encased meats of my dreams).  I was surprised to find the owner, Doug, taking our order.  He was very very polite and actually animated which I did not expect to find since there is a constant flowing line of people from the time they open at 10:30am until the time they close at 4pm. Before I left home my BF told me that I had to try something that we would not normally find at a basic hot dog stand. I think he did this so that he could vicariously taste the encased meats through me.  So, when I got there and realized the Game of the Week was Alligator, I almost turned around and left, but knew what I would be missing out on.  I told my friend that she had to try it with me.  So, we ordered the Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and St. Pete's Blue Cheese ($8.50), the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions ($8) and The Sally Vega, which is a corn dog ($1.50).  One of the surprises was that it only took about 4 minutes to receive our order and they bring it out to your table.  Another surprise was that I liked the Gator a lot more than the Ribeye. The Gator is hard to describe but it was a mild flavor (not chicken), maybe similar to pork, but still different.  With the first bite, I realized that the blue cheese was far too overwhelming for the Gator and my friend agreed.  We both wiped all of it off.  All it really needed was the Cajun Remoulade.  The blue cheese was just too rich and I didn't like how it masked the flavor of the Gator. The Ribeye was tasty but I felt like it was too rich.  I had split this one with my friend as well and I couldn't finish even the half.  However, the Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions went perfectly with it. The only disappointment was The Sally Vega.  It was nothing special.  I felt like it was just another frozen corn dog that I could buy at the supermarket. When we left I laughed when I saw the Ice Cream truck that many other people had spoke about in their reviews.  He found the perfect money making spot, especially when people are waiting an hour to an hour and a half on a hot day.

A few pointers for your visit: 1.  Wear sunscreen.  Only part of the line you'll be waiting in is shaded.  My pale self learned the hard way. 2.  Bring water.  The girl who passed out in line learned the hard way.  Hopefully, if you forget, you can get some from the ice cream man who set up shop when we were there.  That is a smart man. 3.  Bring cash.  That's the only accepted form of currency.  Won't you feel like a doofus if you wait in line for an hour and can't even eat? 4.  Order the duck fat fries.  Worth every gram of saturated fat. 5.  Leave promptly when you are done with your meal.  We saw a few lingerers.  Hello?  There are a ton of people waiting!",0.7381,0.895,0.06,0.045,0.4503869047619048

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! i almost teared up! hahaha! he was just so nice! i told him i'm sorry and that i'm just visiting and we joked around for a bit. i called up my friend and she was amazed as well and was sooo relieved because the ATM was a bit far and it was about 85 degrees outside! i can never thank him enough! he really cares about his guests. so there. 5 stars. the foie gras dog was a good combo! i liked the touch of  sel gris. the regular chicago dog was good as well. all in all, i can't say anything bad about this place. yes the lines are long. but you should already know that when planning to come here. so just be prepared. our line wasn't that long, maybe a good 30 minutes wait. so yeah. i can't wait til i visit Chicago again and try out everything else on the menu! and next time i'm bringing cash. :)",0.9975,0.81,0.162,0.028,0.5694612332112332

Because it was a Wednesday, I was not able to try the fries fried in duck fat, but they were serving the foie gras dog, $9.

Who was I kidding?!?! The line was just as long as usual, maybe longer since the following day (7/4) Doug was closing up shop for a week-long vacation.  As someone who abstains from 99% on encased meats I silently began to question the sanity of my plan; especially when one hour became close to two! Initially, I silently ridiculed those people that brought food with them for the wait in line, but after an hour I was jealous of their ingenuity. For those who came without pre-Doug's sustenance there was an ice cream man parked out front ringing his bells and playing his ice cream man music enticing people to buy a cold treat. (I was unwilling to compromise any space in my stomach for ice cream.) If I wasn't so hungry I would've jumped for joy upon reaching the front of the line. Instead, I just placed my order for 2 veggie dogs Chicago style and a large fry with cheese on the side.  So was the food worth the wait? You betcha!! The ensuing food coma was worth every tasty, gluttonous bite! Sure a carnivore has more menu choices here, but I'd brave the wait in a second for more Doug's. TIP: If you think you can roll up at 4 and still get some Doug's think again my friend, they cut the line off prior to 4 so that the last person reaches the counter around then.

2009-06-30,3.0,"One of Chicago's Great Wonders. (a wonder because I ask who the heck would wait in line for an hour for a bloody hot dog???!!!) Finally got round to Hot Dougs to see what the hype is all about.  I took the day off  for my birthday and a friend was visiting from out of town and she wants to see this place for herself. The boyfriend is a cult worshipper who visits Hot Dougs at least twice a week and he's in love with Doug and the staff all know his name. He talks about Hot Dougs all the time and frankly I'm a little jealous. Why can't he be like a normal guy and be slobbering over Angelina Jolie instead. I'm taking one star off because I'm a jealous lover. Anyway, he was so ecstatic to take us to see his leader. So I don't eat pork or its by-products and though I do love hot dogs, I was not too enthusiastic about Hot Dougs to begin with because I know that most encased meats are encased in swine material. So I can't review the fancy schmancy dogs, and maybe it makes little sense that a non-pork-eating creature visits a hot dogs joint, I was assured that this place is the bomb-diggity and I said I'll give it a chance.  At least I'll get a chicago style dog or chicken or vegetarian. The line: Monday afternoon, around 1pm, the line was about 45 minutes long. The bf says as a regular customer he would not wait that long, but he does not have a Monday to Friday 8-5 work schedule so he can visit his favorite sausage shrine conveniently anytime. The owner/staff: somewhat friendly, mostly catching up with the boyfriend as they have so much to talk about. The boyfriend explained that my friend and I are not pork eaters and Doug proceeded to point us the safe ones are the Chicago Dog, the Kiera (spicy) and Chicken? I think there was another one but I forgot. The Hot Dog: I had the slightly spicy Kiera Knightley, it was grilled to perfection, topped with caramelized onions, tomatoes, relish and a pickle. It was delicious. I'd say that the spiciness can be similarly achieved if I added mayo spiked with some sri racha sauce on a regular hot dog? Other than that, nothing to write home about. Pretty good and pretty cheap for pretty good. At $2.50 its better than a $4 Wiener Circle dog, but a Chicago style hot dog from Portillos is also pretty damn good and I much prefer the fries at Portillos than Hot Dougs. The Celebrity Hot Dog of the day was this spinach feta lamb and pork sausage with kalamata olives. I love greek food and would have wanted to try that had it not for my dietary restriction. But then again, I can just order from a greek restaurant, though it would not be stuffed in a sausage sock and cost $7.50. The Fries: I have to knock off another star for the fries. It was brown and chewy, like they were fried in old oil, and it got cold, and refried. Some were crispy, maybe they were all mixed together. They just don't look very appetizing, and so brown it has spleen cancer written all over it. I've had better. These were regular non duck fat fries. The boyfriend and several others have reported that the duck fat fries vary only very minutely compared to the regular ones. The Cons: At the description of Hot Dougs even before encountering it, I feel like I'm about to get ripped off. The hype and popularity seems like it is further induced by a bottleneck of a line. Everybody knows the con that they do at swanky lounges and clubs downtown where the bouncer holds up a line full of people to give the illusion that its jammed pack inside and everybody wants to get in, you get inside and its MEH. This is a similar business/marketing model, but one star is awarded for actually having a good product to sell. One star for the owner taking down every order and being really adorable but otherwise he's probably laughing gleefully inside at his cleverness. The hours and the time and the drama to getting there are really deterrent factors. The bottomline: Was it worth it? - to please/appease the boyfriend, yes - to bring visitors from out of town to see one of the wonders of Chicago, yes - to be hip and say ""I've been to hot dougs, you should too!"", yes/maybe - to kill time waiting in line if you're not hungry, yes - to a sausage lover or to eat fancy hot dogs, yes - to eat a hot dog, regular/chicago style, no - kosher and non-pork eaters, no - worth taking the day off for a hot dog? no - waiting in line 45 minutes for a hot dog? definitely not",0.9986,0.792,0.157,0.051,0.5833523838945529

(I hate to sound like a bitch, but if the fancy, gourmet dogs were low-priced, I'd be a little bit wary. I can't doubt that they incur high costs from the quality of the meat they use.) My mood continued to get better once I saw that they had Vitamin Water, Fresca, Coke Zero, Dr. Brown's (!), Green River (!!), and other long-forgotten drinks. I also got a chance to read the menu and start doing a favor for everyone behind me in line - Doug himself would have been nice either way, I'm sure, but he was thankful that I already knew what I wanted to order. (I've heard he is very patient and helpful though!) I settled on a pork ""taco dog"" with jalapeno mayo and crumbled monterrey jack cheese. When our food was brought to us and I took my first bite, I knew that the wait and the INSANE caloric load was worth it. (""It's a one-time thing!"" my id yelled at my super-ego.) You might think that some of the specialty dogs have weird flavors, but trust that those flavors were picked out for a reason. The flavors truly work well together. The jalapeno mayo had a kick of its own and really stood out. We didn't have any of the duck fat fries (Wed. visit), but my heart starts to hurt just thinking about them. One day, though! The regular fries were overall good, but perhaps not as good as the dog. What could be, though?",0.9944,0.695,0.202,0.103,0.6067725950172759
2009-06-24,4.0,"OK, after reading all the reviews and seeing it on the Food Network and Travel Chanel a couple of times I had to visit this when I was in the area. The service was great. The owner is incredibly friendly and kinda funny. Not the kind of place where if your not sure what to order they are going to rush you. I actually tried ordering 2 large sodas and he insisted just to order 2 smalls because its free refills and he was going to rip us off when he totaled the check anyway (he was joking obviously). I'll be honest the regular hot dogs were not that great, I mean they tasted like any other hot dog I've had. But the specialty hot dogs are awesome. I remember ordering an angus steak hot dog which was amazing. The regular fries taste just as good as the duck fat fries. The taste difference is subtle and you notice during the after taste. If you there during a time when you can get it I would recommend it. Just remember one order of fries is good enough 2 hungry people. My girlfriend and I made the mistake of ordering duck fat fries and regular fries. The line kinda sucks, but it moves fast. It is well worth it, just order whatever they have on special. Don't order more than 2 (might be tempted with all the selections) because 2 is way more than enough to fill you up.",0.9798,0.834,0.147,0.019,0.5873381248381249
2009-06-24,4.0,"I guess this review is more for my benefit than for Yelp's...704 reviews holy crap!  I was driving ""through"" Chicago (Naperville to Milwaukee--slight detour) and figured this was my last chance to go to Hot Doug's since I'm quitting my travel-heavy job next month.  So I went, it was chilly and raining and the line really wasn't too bad.  It was about 1:30 and the end of the line was maybe 5 or 6 people outside the door.  I had been expecting worse and I had an umbrella, so happy day.  Unfortunately I was alone, so I couldn't split a bunch of dogs with a bunch of friends and just ordered one of the specials: whiskey and fennel sausage with a red pepper mayo and burning nettles cheese (whatever that is).  It wasn't a life-changing experience but it was damn good and definitely worth $8.  I wouldn't order it again if only because there are so many other dogs I want to try! I think what impressed me most about this place was that when I got to the front of the line, the guy (Doug himself, I presume?) was totally friendly and patient.  Back east the guy at the front of that line would be an angry, condescending asshole and people would love him for his arrogance, but at Hot Doug's I got service with a smile.  Just one of the many reasons I really, really, really like Chicago.  Thanks, Doug.",0.9839,0.743,0.183,0.074,0.5054597701149424

2009-06-24,4.0,"As the 706th review of this fine eatery, there isn't much to add to the mile-high pile of raves.  So, I'll stick with the tangential details to my visit and only poke at the well-trod food details since you've got 705 other reviews to get those. The place first came into my consciousness when I saw a piece on CBS' ""Sunday Morning"" a few weeks back.  Then, I saw ""Hot Dog Paradise"" on the Food Network and they featured Hot Doug's.  ""What is this place?"" is what I thought and could it really be this good? Simple answer:  Yes! Yes! Yes!  (cue Sally from ""When Harry Met Sally""). Flew up to Chicago last weekend and met awesome Yelper, Jenny H, at the Diversey station on Saturday.  We rode the bus down Diversey to a rougher part of town then walked the rest of the way.  She had warned me that we needed to get there early since lines form, especially on the weekend.  We arrived at the still locked front doors at 10 AM.  And, we were first! Savoring the victory, we saw a veritable tsunami of people who were sitting in their air-conditioned cars jumping out for the mad scramble to be second in line.  You'd think this was the Oklahoma land rush by the looks of it.  We easily had a line of 50 people behind us by 1015 AM. More people drove by, scowled at the line, and kept driving.  One car even flipped us off.  How rude!  Others pulled up on their bikes or jumped out of cabs to queue up.  By the time that the doors opened at 1030 AM, the line snaked down the sidewalk and was easily 100 people deep.  You don't have to believe me - I've got pictures.  Blam! Doug, the namesake of his business, works every day at the counter taking orders.  When we sidled up, he was just the same as he was on TV (nice) and comped our drinks when Jenny told him that I was from out of town.  Together, we ordered 4 hot dogs and an order of the duck fries.   Jenny suggested that we split the fries and halve each dog so that we could try all four - brilliant idea since I was stunned agape by the beautiful encased meats laid out in front of me.  Unfortunately, before she had finished the sentence I was halfway into the Chicago-style dog ($1.75).  Oops. But, I made it up to her by splitting the last one into a 3/4 and 1/4 split and took the smaller one as atonement for my inhaling the first dog.  We had an Elvis Presley polish ($2.50), a special Spicy Crawfish (this was the star dog), and a special Italian sausage one.  We didn't want to be complete asses and sit at the glass-front counter where those still in line would be forced to watch us chow down.  (Okay, I wanted to but Jenny restrained me.)  The duck fat fries ($3.50) were all right but lacked the wattage to outshine the various dogs. Total damage for the two of us:  $23 for four dogs, an order of duck fat fries, and comped sodas. We rolled out of there at 1115 AM on a hot Saturday morning for the 2.2 mile walk to Wrigley Field.  Memo to self:  Don't do this again.  Take the bus since your full belly will prevent seeing your toes.  Ah, good times.",0.9462,0.91,0.061,0.029,0.5245383867832848

2009-06-22,4.0,"I feel like Yelp'ing Hot Dougs is like a right of passage for both Chicago and Yelp. What could be bad about a Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium. My rule with Hot Dougs is that you MUST try something you would not normally eat. You can get a Chicago Dog (as I did), but you BETTER couple that with something more interesting. How many places can you get a duck, rattlesnake, bison, boar, or whatever animal you are craving?  I wont say anything new either, but here goes about my experience... I got there around 10:30am, not because I was scared of a wait, but I was awake and decided to go instead of going back to sleep. I am glad I went when I did - there were already like 75 people in line! At 10:30am! GO TO BED PEOPLE. I go the Chicago dog (I judge a place by their Chicago dog so I had to go simple for one) and I also got the duck sausage with orange marmalade and blue cheese. The Chicago dog was great! Grilled to perfection with everything you want. The duck sausage was tasty as well, although the blue cheese was quite strong. I wish it were toned down a little, but I know that is just means it was good cheese, which I respect. I wanted to try the duckfat fries but I was alone and couldnt bring myself to do it. I did try the regular fries and they were good! You got a ton so enough for sharing.  Get there early, prepare for an experience, try something you wouldnt normally eat, and be willing to spend a little money and go all out.  Hot Dougs was also featured on Anthony Bourdains ""13 Places to Eat Before You Die"" ..it was on a list with some VERY high-end restaurants. It was quite the honor. A few other points - -There is street parking (at least on weekends) -The menu online is very accurate and they update it everyday with the specials -Dont ask ""what do you recommend"" ...Apparently everything is good! -Very good customer service!",0.9971,0.771,0.203,0.026,0.5178207749041083

Backed up by nearly 75 people, I am not even in the alley - the line is that long. The sidewalk is torn, shattered from the millions of people who have stood in my place and slowly shuffled along to get reach encased meat nirvana. An ice cream truck parked near the alley, no childrens' song blaring and no bells ringing. We go up and order ice cream to escape the oppression. Helping myself to a pre-Hot Doug's meat session, I hit up an Oreo ice cream bar and pay the man $2.00. In minutes, the ice cream was gone and I flipped open a locked garbage bin and chucked the remnants in. As we crawled through the line the anticipation for entering the Garden of Eden of encased meats heightened as I looked inside the window, saw people trying to slowly shuffle in and dominate some sausages! A foolish neophyte attempted to stroll in to grab himself a menu, but his application was denied! We crept past one door, and then were behind the air conditioned door, waiting for the gap in the line to form so we could bum rush it! And yes, it was to be - one hour of waiting had paid off! My friends all ordered before me, I then discovered that the Hotdougs on Twitter was not Doug, and he said that is how far his celebrity now went that there were impersonators on Twitter! Regardless of this fact, I ordered grilled Elk sausage with Honker's Ale mustard, with two cheeses, a Keira Knightley spicy dog, duck fat fries and a large drink. Yep, I really spent over $17 on this trip, but I do not care - for encased meat nirvana, I'd do anything! We hauled out one by one and headed to the river nearby to sit by the bank and watch barrels pass by on this blazing afternoon day. My friend had one bite of his veggie dog and was gagging. He declared and then I affirmed that Doug had messed up, Doug had ripped my friend off! Not so fast! I then took a bite out of his disputed veggie dog and declared that it was not meat, that the muscle fibers were not there to break down and that my friend himself had just bitten into the world's greatest veggie dog!!!!!!!!!!! I then unwrapped a white package that said ELK and started to go to town on encased elk meat. The flavors from the elk, the mustard, the two layers of cheese affirmed that Doug is the all-time master of bundling random game and making it a dog from the gods.

My friend and I were visiting the great city of Chicago and of course we had to try the famous Chicago style hot dog.   And of course we had to go to Hot Doug's.   So we literally took public transit for 30 minutes and walked another 20 minutes JUST to get there.  (Okay, it took us 20 minutes to walk because my friend hurt her knee and I hurt my foot.  Some random and unfortunate thing happened to us and we ended up limping wherever we traveled to in Chicago.) That's not the reason for the bad review.  So we get there, we wait in line, and we order the first one (Chicago style) with everything on it.  We try ordering the duck fat fries but alas, it's Saturday and no duck fat fries.  Remember!!  Go on a Thursday, you should confirm, but I think it's the day when they make the duck fat fries.  Also!!  They close at 4:00 pm!  At least on the day we went, so we were literally rushing our way over (at 3:30) when a local told us that. The hot dog was an ordinary hot dog.  I mean, I don't know, it didn't taste spectacular, and it was kind of small.  I guess the price was decent, but I guess coming from LA we have those hot dog carts with a similar price but the hot dogs are bigger and tastier.  That is why I took off 2 stars.  For all the effort we put forth to go to this famous place, the food was just okay and the service wasn't even that nice. One star I took off was because I didn't feel like the owner was really all that friendly.  Also, (and maybe you'll think this part for the star is unfair) I left my camera there in which I frantically called back the following day over and over because I had  a flight to catch back home.  The owner really didn't give a crap about my dismay and wasn't even willing to take my information down should they find the camera.   All and all, I guess it's a cool place to visit in Chicago.  But don't have high expectations like we did..

Having visitors during the week was my excuse to try all the places I'd read about on Yelp/heard good things about elsewhere that sounded as though they'd be madhouses on the weekends. Hot Doug's was great. I was there around 2 on a Wednesday and there was a line but it moved quickly. Once I ordered, I was really surprised by how quickly my order was ready - it was probably like 5 minutes. I was ready to wait longer. Also, Doug was super nice. It's obvious that he's doing what he loves. Anyone else behind that register would be bored/annoyed by 2 p.m., but he was cheery and kind. I'm sure not much else needs to be said about this place. I love the creative daily specials, which I'm sure will keep me from ever ordering a regular hot dog here.  Sometimes (usually when I'm hungry), I just visit the website to see what they're doing on a given day, it's that interesting to me.  I tried two of the specials and felt like an adventurous sausage connoisseur, which is obviously something I've always aspired to. The sausages were totally delicious, btw. The only sour note - and it was no fault of Hot Doug's - was the dude in line behind me. He was with his girlfriend, who got maybe 2 words out the entire time. In the 15 minutes (possibly less) for which he stood behind me, he managed to insult his girlfriend's religion to her face, call the city a ""hellhole"" and berate her for living here while extolling the virtues of the suburb he lives in, and go over each and every bicycle available that sucks. Bad attitude doesn't even capture it. It's maybe the one time in my life I've actually been tempted to pull the old, ""If you don't like this city GET THE (expletive) OUT!""

There is no doubt in my mind that they could make the neccessary adjustments/additions (add another cashier, extend their hours, etc.) to compensate for the traffic overflow. But I think in doing so, it would take away from the experience Doug has created. Yes, waiting is generally not a good thing, but for some strange reason I think it works here. I personally did not mind the wait, which was approximately 30 mintues from end of line to ordering time. You just need to be sure to plan for it.  I don't think much needs to be said about the food, it was spectacular. Just be sure to eat it immediately.  I think a lot of the flavor is lost and the buns tend to get a bit soggy, if you wait even just a few minutes. The dog toppings are absolutely perfect. Prices are very reasonable for the standard menu, and they don't charge extra for most of the add on toppings. Prices for some of the more unique dogs can add up, but definitely still are worth it; cheaper and much more filling than sushi. (No I am not comparing hot dogs to sushi in terms of types of product, but more in terms of cost of experimentation. Most of us sushi fans have no problem paying $15 for a couple pieces or roll of fish that we've never had. So why not do it on a unique hot dog?) Doug took our order, and I must say, I don't think I have ever had a more polite and eager employee take my order at a restaurant.

I got the duck hot dog with the foie gras mousse on top with some sort of Dijon mustard and something truffle. The hot dog itself was great, but to be honest besides the novelty, foie gras mousse is a little too heavy for a hot dog. But, I LOVE the different options offered here, and the menu choices always make my mouth water. I tried my friend's kangaroo hot dog with passionfruit relish (yum!) as well as like a mountain game mix hot dog which was also flavorful. So great options for those who love creative and aren't afraid of trying something new.  And okay normally, I'm a huge fan of duck fat haha..

It's such a small place, but decorated in a playful, unique way with walls covered in hot dogs and hot dog memorabilia. Some people know the drill by eating at a good pace and leaving.

2009-05-06,5.0,"From its red brick exterior, Hot Doug's Sausage Superstore, has the same gravitas and appeal as the back of Wrigley Field.  There's character there.  Moxie.  History.  It's a working man's brick.  You know that only a few feet away greatness waits.  But unlike the Cubs, Doug Sohn's crew at Hot Doug's really does perform like a world class team.   To say that Hot Doug's is a hot dog stand is like saying ""Chicago is a big city"".  It's true.  But both Chicago and Hot Doug's are much, much more.  Hot Doug's does serve the standard fare of the typical Chicago dog stand, but like the Art Institute's ever changing collections, it's the ever changing selection of gourmet sausages that make Doug's different.  And it's not just the encased meats that are gourmet.  Sometimes the toppings are as much of a treat as the sausage itself.   Imagine the savoriness of a jerk pork sausage served on soft and chewy French roll, dressed with a spicy passion fruit mayonnaise, sautéed sweet plantain, and a Crème de Brie cheese served with a large helping of Duck Fat Fries (served only on Friday and Saturday).   Or what about the richness of spinach and the bite of feta in a gyros sausage topped with a tapenade mayonnaise and Kasseri cheese?  Definitely hold the ketchup. Or even the dog that got Doug into trouble:  a Sauterne-infused duck sausage topped with foie gras.  Served during Chicago's short-lived ban of foie gras, it garnered Hot Doug's the only fine levied during the entire ban.  And thanks in no small part to Doug's drive to make gourmet affordable, the fine pointed out the absurdity of Chicago's food ban, and struck a blow for common sense.  And that's the other thing that's so great about Hot Doug's.  It's pure Chicago.  You'll take a seat next to a table of game designers from the nearby offices of Midway Games.  On the other side will be a table of roughnecks from ComEd on their lunch break.  Hipsters will be sitting next to cube dwellers, who are sitting next to tourists, who are sitting across from suburb visitors from Naperville, and everyone is having a good time.  From the primary colors, to the faux sausage facts, to Doug greeting each customer, everything at Hot Doug's seems to bring a smile to your face.  The atmosphere is the appetizer, and the final fun condiment on each order served.   The one thing you will have to reconcile is the wait.  Open from 10:30am to 4:00pm Monday through Saturday, locals will cheerfully wait 45 minutes to an hour in some of the worst Chicago weather for Hot Doug's.  You should too.  But unlike Cub fans who wrestle with the uncertainty of whether or not this will be be ""the year"", you can relish the knowledge that dining victory is yours.",0.9824,0.805,0.125,0.07,0.5024258760107817

2009-05-06,4.0,"A totally awesome and unique purveyor of sausage. The complete name of this place is Hot Doug's Sausage and Encased Meat Emporium. The reputation of this place preceded itself even before a visit by Anthony Bourdain, but now, after that, the place is even more popular. If that's possible. We visited on a blisteringly sunny and cold March saturday, about 12.30pm. We waited in line, with everyone else, until about 2.15. Very few people left, and those that came understood that to experience the greatness, the wait was part of the experience. Now sure, everything tastes better when you have to wait for it. But honestly, this place would taste awesome without the wait. Doug's is truly a shrine to the encasement of meat. The three of us ordered about 10 sausages with several types of meat: beef, chicken, bison, lamb, and pork by my count. We also had the duck fat french fries. So that's 6 types of animal product in one meal. I dare you to find that in a meal anywhere else. Seriously, it's something that may not be accomplished again in my life.. All of the sausages, particularly the more exotic types, were excellent. I had a rib-eye steak sausage with horshradish that really did blow me away. The duck fat french fries, not so much.  For all it's greatness though, Doug's can't get 5 stars from me. The reason is simple. Amidst all the extravagance, I got the basic hot italian sausage to try something ""classic"". In Chicago, you expect this to be top-notch, and it simply disappointed. The hot italian was not all that hot, the consistency inside was too fine, it lacked fennel seed (which is a debated ingredient, but I personally think it's necessary). Also, the mustards on-hand weren't particularly noticeable.  Ultimately, this place is a trip. It's really, really, really, great. Do order the craziest encased meat you can find. It's sooo worth it. But if you're the Ultimate Encased Meat Emporium, you better have the most top-notch hot italian sausage I've ever eaten.",0.9928,0.834,0.138,0.028,0.575531260123097

Like Pink's in LA but more about the types of sausages than toppings and in my opinion much better.  Cost to worth it ratio: 4 (sausages affordable at $3-8, but you gotta include the $40 round trip cab ride from the heart of the city if visiting)  Eve award: best sausages ever--from the standards to the creative  Highlights:  - Menu: from the typical chicago dog, to flavored pork to rattlesnake, they have it all. You can choose the usual toppings or go with a specialty that includes items like bacon mayo, peach creme friache, or marinaded cherries. Specials change daily and are posted on their website so you can check em out before heading out there... or while in line. - Sausages: most excellent. Buns are soft and warm. Pics of our order:  yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… -- Italian: thought this might be a boring choice but it was the hit of day for me. Tender and not rubbery meat with supurb seasoning featuring black pepper and Italian herbs. I get Italian sausages a good amount and this is the best by a mile.  -- Jay Cutler: celebrity special of smoked shrimp and pork with cajun remoulade and blue cheese. Excellent mixture with huge hunks of the cheese melting on top of the hot sausage. Oh my my oh hell yes. Pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJq… - Duck fat fries: extremely crispy with a hint of extra flavoring vs the traditional frying oil. - Atmosphere: full of sausage paraphernalia and pictures of people who have eaten here. Love the cheeky fun quality of the menu on the wall within hot dog shapes, the celebrity dog having it's own separate listing with a toy limo on top, the duck fat fries sign having a duck, etc. The best: of all are the bathroom signs: boys have a hot dog in a bun and girls have a bun without the dog--ha!  - Doug: so friendly. With the line like it is and him taking orders all day from all those people, I was expecting him to be like the Seinfeld soup nazi like another yelper mentioned. So not the case. He was relaxed, warm, welcoming and took time with each person instead of treating us like just another sheep being herded through the line. The staff is equally helpful and non-disgruntled.  Lowlights:  - Wait time: expect a long one, especially on weekends. We got there at 1:30pm on a cold, windy Saturday and waited 2 hours.  - Transportation: not easy to get to and outside the main city center. No close train stop so it's bus or cab and cabs are a pain to catch to get back even when called.  - No foie gras dog the day I was there, as featured in Anthony Bourdain's visit.

She cannot believe that people line up as they do here and that they act so civil towards one another. I had told her about barging through a line of about 50 people there one day to deliver something to Caliente Doug. She claims in New York I probably would have been attacked or otherwise maimed for that, and that people in line would not be so civil if they were New Yorkers. I hadn't thought of that angle.

2009-03-16,5.0,"I'm slightly hesitant to like a Chicago Style Hot Dog. I like my hot dogs plain, from dirty hot water or on a grill with relish and mustard. Sometimes with sauerkraut. A Chicago style dog has everything on it, including a long pickle slice. Then I saw Bourdain go to Hot Doug's on his show and I knew I had to go there. Even my foodie sister and brother-in-law have not been there yet, mainly because they did not want to wait in the famously long line. Abby and I weren't to be turned away. We were willing to wait 2 hours or more for these famous dogs, not to mention the duck fat french fries. (Yes, I did say duck fat!) Just like when we went to Pink's in LA, we must have had the hot dog gods smiling on us, because the line was not that bad. We had to wait about 30 minutes from once we got into the line outside the restaurant to ordering the food from the owner, Doug Sohn, himself. (He was extremely nice and made it feel like it was an honor for him to be taking our order instead of the other way around. He did this with everyone in line and made sure he told everyone to have a good weekend.) We had two orders, one for us to eat right then and there, and the other to take home for my sisters and niece. Doug was kind enough to hold out on the other order until we were done eating to make sure it's nice and warm. Our order consisted of: 1 Hot Doug with everything on it, including chili and cheese, 1 Hot Doug with everything on it, 1 corn dog, and 1 duck sausage with foie gras. Also one order of the duck fat french fries. Let me say this off the bat: I am no longer a hater of Chicago styled hot dogs. Holy smokes were these things fan-freaking-tastic! The hot doug with everything on it and with chili and cheese was the greatest example of the perfect hot dog I have ever known and eaten. The hot dog had the perfect snap once you bit into it and all the condiments worked perfectly together. The chili could have been eaten on it's own with some bread or crackers. The pickle was a real pickle (unlike those New England ones I've been bitching about lately). The bright neon green relish tasted fresh and you knew did not come out of one of those plastic containers that you get at most hot dog stands. And the price! Starting at $1.75, this is a steal! The corn dog was equally fantastic and delicious. I love corn dogs, and I think the best ones are the foot longs that you get at carnivals and state fairs. This corn dog lived up to those expectations. (However, there was one fault I will talk about in a bit.) The batter was so good, you probably could have made corn bread with it alone and had it with pulled pork. I had mustard and ketchup on the side, but I didn't need that much of either because the corn dog was perfect on it's own. Now we get to the ""gilding the lily"" portion of our meal: The duck sausage with foie gras hot dog. Ok, the sausage was perfect on it's own, moist and tender with amazing flavors and the casing added that crunch one needs in a hot dog. The addition of the foie gras...well you don't necessarily have to have it, but you definitely won't complain that it's there. It melts perfectly in your mouth with every bite and the home made mustard that was put in the bun with the duck sausage was a marriage of unbelievable taste. I wish I could say more about this, but Abby only let me have two bites because she was so in love with it. If you go to Hot Doug's, please get this duck sausage and give it a try. This duck sausage should have it's own Michelin star (or 3). The duck fat french fries stole our hearts when we saw it on the Bourdain show. And we had to get them. And while they were good, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between regular fries. There were some hints of duck flavor on some bites, but I guess I just assumed that the fries were going to taste like crispy duck skin. They weren't bad fries at all, actually they were really good. I just didn't see the magic of the duck fat. Now onto my only complaint: The bottom of the corn dog. Any corn dog aficionado will tell you the greatest part of the corn dog is the little bit of batter at the end of the hot dog wiener that got fried onto the stick. When done right, this little piece of heaven is sweet and crunchy. I have no idea what makes it so good, but for some reason most carnivals and state fair corn dogs do it perfectly. At Hot Doug's...well, it tasted just like the rest of the batter. Which was lovely and tasty on it's own, but for a true corn dog to be the perfect meat on a stick, it has to make this little part 1000% better than the rest of the corn dog. As you can see, Hot Doug's did not disappoint at all. Our to-go order consisted of another order of duck fat fries, a corn dog for my niece and a Salma Hayek (spicy sausage) with chili and cheese. A drink each for Abby and me, and our total for it all was only $30!!!! Yes, you read that correctly.

That said, the alligator dog was good and delicious, but for $8.50, I'm not going to have it again. It tasted just like chicken and had no other value apart from the ""omg, I ate a reptile"" bragging rites. And when you get right down to it, these ""special"" sausages are a bit over-priced. Big whoop, you have spicy linguica, I can get that same dog for half the price back home. I must give a shout out to Doug at the service counter. He's very friendly and enthusiastic. The man clearly loves his job.  So, in conclusion, I guess you should go here once because it's famous and apparently Anthony Bourdain is a fan of it.

The couple in front of me had landed into Chicago from LA and decided to come straight to Hot Doug's from Ohare. Thats craziness. The guys behind me came from Louisville, KY and headed to Hot Dougs after getting lost in Gary, IN. Thats lunacy. But our curiosity for these hot dogs bonded us together! The variety this place has is amazing. They have 11 items on their menu not including the specials. I tried the Thai spicy sausage with seaweed salad. It was SPICY! But very tasty. The sauce also had some wasabi in it. I'm not a fan of wasabi but was very impressed at how the flavors of everything meshed.  I also ordered the cheese fries. I had a taste of the duck fried fries and I personally thought the cheese fries were better than the regular duck fries. But hey, anything fried cant be bad right?

I did see the online menu for their specials of the day and immediately decided between two dogs - the Jalapeno Pork Sausage and the Mandarin Orange Teriyaki Chicken Sausage. I went for the Teriyaki one and an order of the duck fat fries. I manged to score a small table and ate to my hearts content. Perhaps I didn't need to eat all of the fries but it is not that often that I will get a chance to have duck fat fries ... and yes they are very good.

The true brilliance at Hot Doug's comes in the form of the incredibly indulgent and constantly changing specialty sausages-- what's that you say? Foie gras on a poppyseed hot dog bun? Yes, please! You've got to love the juxtaposition of gourmet ingredients on a bun, served in a wildly decorated hut located in a rather industrial area of the city. But it works.... very well, I might add. And don't forget the duck fat fries.  However, most of my visits start with being ticked off by the super long line and then that anger is augmented when I see people throwing away large portions of food. It just blows my mind to see someone chuck half an order of fries and two unfinished sausages into the trash bin. I'm a pretty relaxed guy, but one of my biggest pet peeves is people wasting food, especially GOOD food.  Now that Hot Doug's has been visited by Tony B on No Reservations, I suspect that Bourdain's lemmings will amplify such situations.

I've whiled away hours of my life engaged in this very conversation with Doug.  Justin, Doug's ubiquitous, charming, talented and handsome assistant, frequently joins in on the fun, and my husband has to stand there squirming under our scrutiny.

On a Saturday evening, I decided to go at 5pm. I didn't check the time because I thought such a booming establishment would be open on a Sat evening. WRONG!!! I got there and I saw some kid in there mopping the floor and putting up chairs. DAMN! Yesterday afternoon, I went at noon and as I rode by I saw the chairs up on the table and no long line like I had been hearing about. He had a sign up saying he had been closed for a few days. WTF!!! TODAY: Took off of work today and decided this time I will call and to my surprise someone answered and it was Doug himself. He told me to get up there because he opens at 10:30 and the line will be out of the door. I jumped in my car and made it there in 10 mins. As I rolled up I saw a line just slightly out of the door. That was not gonna stop me! I got in line and got hungrier as I got closer to the front. I told Doug I was the guy on the phone and we had a good laugh about my failed attempts to sample his food. He recommended I get the day's special, The Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Sesame Seaweed and Sriracha Mustard. I got that along with the duck fat fries.  If anyone has ever seen Harold & Kumar goes to White Castle,  the moment when they finally got their sliders, that was me today. There was even another first timer there as well and he told me he drove all the way from Midway Airport to get there.

2009-02-23,4.0,"For lunch today I made the trek all the way up north to Hot Doug's to meet Jeff. We just missed the lunch rush, so I had that going for me.... which is nice. I ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, the Gyro Sausage, The Dog, Fries, and a small Fountain Beverage.  Can Doug be any nicer?  You'd think that after slinging that many sausages for so many years to so many customers, he'd be a total prick. On this occasion I allowed him to pick my final sausage and he totally took some time and thought about it (he suggested the gyro).  Anyway, after much internal debate, I decided to eat the sausages one at a time and started with the duck.  First off the sausage itself was moist, well seasoned, and just straight up yummy.  However, the yumminess didn't stop at the sausage, because it was topped with Foie Gras Mousse and Truffle Sauce.  Wow!  This was more than a sausage, it was a well orchestrated gourmet meal disguised as a sausage and delivered on a bun.  I then moved to the Gyro, which wasn't so much a play on a traditional Gyro, but more a Mediterranean inspired dish on a bun.  The sausage was comprised of lamb & beef, topped with a Spinach Riata, Black Olives, and Haloumi Cheese.  Another winner!  Finally, I dove straight into a classic Chicago dog.  Doug keeps it real with a nice all beef dog, drags it through the garden, and leaves off the ketchup.  It was delicious, but the bun wasn't steamed, which is a bit of a turn off for me.  The fries were spot on and the Root Beer was flowing freely from the tap. The space looks like just another hot dog shop.  Bright colors, plenty of seating, and walk up service really makes you feel like you're at the corner greasy spoon.  However, excellent service, great tunes, and an amazing product elevate Hot Doug's to be something so much more.  If Charlie Trotter was really nice, cool, was obsessed with sausages, and down to earth he might have opened a joint like this, but he's not and Doug is.  I hate dishing out 4 or 5 star Yelps for fast food joints, especially when I only gave White Castle a 3, but this is just straight up sinful and delicious! 2 Sausages of the Day 1 Hot Dog 1 Fry 1 Drink ------------ $21.00",0.9965,0.768,0.187,0.045,0.6483091787439613

I had a chicken sausage with the works AKA, the Dave Kingman Italian style. My hubs had andoullie sausage with the works AKA, the Salma Hayek. Like the sign says, this dog is hot, hot, hot!

Most of their specials have some kind of fine cheese and fancy mayo, not a great treatment for sausage in my opinion. I think you're better off sticking with the classic Chicago dog. They do it better than anyone. Charred and deep fried is the way to go. Of course, the line is an ordeal, especially since they showed this place on Bourdain. Stick with it. Typically they close the line down at 4, but stay open until everyone who was in line at 4 gets served -- disregard the Chads and Brosefs who might try to get you to leave the line by telling you otherwise.

2009-02-18,5.0,"""There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats', my friend."" Thus sayeth the motto of Hot Doug's - nay, their very raison d'etre.  Everything about Doug's is delightful, from the Wiener-on-a-Stick decor colors (bright primaries) to the names of the menu items (sausages are named after celebs, which change due to relevance - the Andouille sausage (""Mighty, mighty, mighty hot"") is now the Salma Hayek but used to be the Ann-Margret).   Being Chicagoan to my core, soul food to me is a Chicago-style dog and fresh-cut cheese fries.  Looking around Doug's, I'm not alone.  The place is almost *always* packed.  Not open for dinner, and if you're unlucky enough to get a craving during the lunch rush, be prepared to wait.  The line often wraps around the corner and up the block.   It is so, so worth it.  Hand-made gourmet fast food?  Oh my God, yes please.  One of the best Chicago dogs I've ever had, say nothing for daily specials like sun-dried tomato chicken sausage with fresh basil and mozzarella.  You'll be surprised at the versatility of encased meats on this menu.  Sausage aficianados will rejoice.  Vegetarians will rejoice (when I was a vegetarian, Doug's veggie dog kept me very, very happy.)  They even have corn dogs (which also come in veggie) that I mean to try every time I go in but usually get distracted from. The fries are hearty, crisp, and wonderful.  The cheese sauce somehow avoids tasting fakey and processed (although it might well be... I don't know, honestly.)  When I sit down with my tray full of goodies at Doug's (if I can find a table), I am at peace. My Dad opened a business not long ago closeby, and he started raving about the food.  I've been going with friends since high school, so we talk about it together.  My Mom is jealous that neither of us have taken her yet, so we'll certainly have to do that. Some things you should know:  * The (expansive) daily menu isn't at all overpriced, but the daily specials are not cheap.  They are, however, hand-made gourmet delicacies and they are huge, often with exotic or expensive ingredients. * There is an over-abundance of street parking.  No porblem. * You're going to either want to call or check the website before you head over to Hot Doug's, because they like to close for a few days for silly reasons.  Back from college for break, a friend and I were very disappointed when we got to Doug's (no line outside... bad sign) only to find them closed for three days in celebration of Don Knotts' birthday.  Lesson learned. * And last but most important, Doug already likes you.  He loves his business, he loves his food, and he loves his customers.  When things get crazy, many business owners will check out and leave an employee or manager to deal with the havoc.  But most of the time, it's Doug taking orders and dishing out change at the counter during the lunch rush when the line of hungry sausage-lovers is up the block and growing.  And he's happy to see you!",0.9964,0.763,0.171,0.066,0.5810157203907205
2009-02-16,5.0,"I emailed Hot Doug once to inquire about the day's specials, and he signed his reply ""Sausagely, Doug."" So I basically loved this place before I even got there.  You have to go on Friday or Saturday for the duck fat fries, and keep in mind it closes kind of early, at 4pm. You can smell the fries before you even open the car door, and you gotta get used to it because the wait is usually at least 20 minutes.  The specials menu changes daily. One time, they had Ale & Chipotle Buffalo sausage with Hard Cider mustard and Monterey-Jack cheese, Mediterranean Lamb Sausage with Red-Curry Garlic sauce and Feta cheese, and White Wine and Dijon Rabbit sausage with Truffle sauce Moutarde and Port Salut cheese.  On my first visit, I didn't know the cash-only policy and nearly broke into tears thinking I couldn't afford the fries AND a sausage. Doug himself quickly wrote both items down on my order sheet, saying he couldn't have anyone looking that sad in his store. He cheerily took what money we could give him and told us to get some drinks and find a seat, never once expressing irritation with us. The order was out in a few short minutes, and the waittress was happy to dump an obscenely large order of the fries on our table. They didn't look like anything impressive but as soon as I popped one of the skinny delights, totally condiment-free, I was overcome by a flavor never this apparent in regular fries. They weren't the super-crispy texture I usually look for, but it didn't matter. They were dashed with grains of sea salt visible to the naked eye, a perfect complement to the smokey, earthy flavor. It was tough to halt my frenzied shoveling action with the fries, but my Apple and Cherry Pork sausage awaited, with Sweet Dijon mustard and Blue cheese, all drizzled with honey and topped with Griottes (tiny canned sour cherries). On another visit, I was slightly disappointed by the Reuben-themed corned beef sausage, topped with Russian dressing, Swiss cheese and saurkraut, but I think that's just because I'm not too fond of Russian dressing, and there was a lot of it.  The fries alone are worth the wait, but this is one place I feel like I can order pretty much any specialty dog and walk away with a smile on my face.",0.9348,0.856,0.082,0.062,0.4590440186594033

The food I had was amazing, the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great, and Doug and the rest of his staff are very friendly. Even waiting in line was kind of fun; everyone was excited to go in and salivating at the smell of those peculiar hot dogs. After about a 45 minute wait, my friends and I were finally able to order.  Remember, it is CASH ONLY, so remember to bring some. Also, the duck fat fries are only available on Friday and Saturdays! Anyway, I ordered the Foie Gras hot dog (made with a duck sausage? with truffle sauce and topped with foie gras slices) and an order of duck fat fries. It only took about 5 minutes for it to be ready and the first bite of that hot dog was pure heaven. So delicious! So savory! So rich! The serving of duck fat fries is huge, so make sure to share it with someone; don't make the mistake of having everyone order their own because trust me, you won't be able to finish it!

I took a half day from work, hopped on my bike andmet my fellow fat-kid friend at Roscoe and California for an hour of encased-meaty bliss.

How Doug manages to stay in such good humor all day, every day as he takes orders from gabby, indecisive tourists is beyond me, but I'm sure it's a big part of why his shop does so well. The other part is, of course, his sausage. My goodness.  Between the two of us, FFKF and I had two corn dogs, two orders of fries (one with cheese), a bratwurst and -- are you ready? -- a mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken sausage with chili-garlic mustard and Valfrais chili-paprika cheese. That was mine, copied straight from the website (they list their specials regularly so you always know what you're in for). Oh, and a Dr. Brown's CELERY soda. I wanted to marry my corn dog and have babies with everything else I ate. The lack of a fifth star was for my massively overdressed chicken dog. I had to scrape off the excess with my corn dog stick.

(well, actually, Alinea would have been nice but that wasn't possible on such short notice...). We arrived around 11:30, saw no line outside, and immediately parked.  Praising our luck and yes, the cold weather, we nearly ran in our eagerness.  By the time we reached the doors, there was a bit of a queue leaving us standing outside in ~18-degree cold for about 1 minute.  Patrons left and we were indoors.  Once inside -- ah, how to choose?  We immediately gravitated towards the specials, ordering 1 dog for each of us, 1 dog to share, and the duck fat fries (served only on Fridays and Saturdays). One in particular screamed my name: Calvados-infused duck sausage with sauce moutarde, Grand Marnier pork pate and truffle-infused balsamic cream. Ultimately I think I prefered the flavors in the sausages of my companions -- there was just a tad too much moutarde that overwhelemed the more delicate flavors of the pate and the duck sausage which tried valiantly to combat the mustardy spicy-sourness with sweet undertones...also, I didn't get any truffle taste at all... Nora M. chose Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Citrus Mojo mayo and Mad River Aged Goat Cheese - the jerk was smoky and perfectly paired with the brie-like slabs of goat cheese; Kevin ordered Portuguese Chourico with a Saffron Rouille and Iberico cheese - also a beautiful, perfectly balanced mouthful... the duck fat fries were the best fries I had ever tasted and were delicious even though they seemed a little undersalted.  To share we had the Game of the Week: Rattlesnake sausage with Pomegranate mayo and cheese-stuffed hot peppers -- very delicious and flavorful, spice from the peppers was cut nicely by the soft cream cheese. Doug was at his usual spot at the cash register and, upon learning that I was visiting from the left coast, comped us our sodas.  The specials run around $7-8; the standard dogs $1.75-4... cash only; closed on Sundays.   The concept is simply amazing and makes me long for a branch out in SF...

I finally ordered a not-dog and it was good. It did creep me out a little because it tasted like real meat. I had to call and verify that it was indeed a fake-meat hot dog. Whoever I spoke with was very nice and proud of the kind of fake hot dogs they serve. Kudos for a place that serves duck-fat-french-fries for also serving quality meatless hot dogs.  PS.

We were ready to order because we didn't want to hold up the line, but Doug himself greats you! I ordered the Cognac Infused Smoked Pheasant sausage with Pomegranate Sausage with Pomegranate-Berry Muster Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. Doug is a mutha f*ckn chef by all degrees! He encases all his sausages with some unique savory meats, rabit, elk, etc. I love it. I'm  1/2 beaner so I can appreciate some exotic meats. This hot dog had to be the best I've ever had in my life.  I have no idea where he gets these ingredients in the middle of America. But shit, the mustard sauce was the best part besides the sausage, and the Foie Gras Mousse works like cheese. I took pics of it in the review pics, check it out. I would have paid over 80 bucks for this hot dog. But it was 8. The smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Cajun Tartar Sauce and Habanero Jack Cheese was the second one I ate. It was sooo good, seafood and pork. You got to love it. It didn't taste fishy. It was spicy like a hot link but a savory flavor. I think the Habanero jack cheese was a perfect pair with the Cajun tartar sauce, it paired well with the Indian beer given to us in line from another customer waiting to pair wine and beer with there meals. Which Doug offers on occasion, BYOB. It is excellent in you want a 5 star fast food experience.  Paul Kelly Bratwurst, this also made me have a good meal, I haven't had a bratwurst like this ever with the sour kraut, and deli mustard. It's excellent quality meat. You can taste by the texture.

2008-11-15,5.0,"We've been doing these Chicago eating binges with our friend Maria, which allows us to do a lot more sampling than if it was just me and my wife. This is why we can order four different sausages at Hot Doug's without feeling too guilty. Chicago-style hot dogs differ from other styles of hot dogs because they generally include mustard, onions, an artificially colored neon-green relish, tomato slices, and a pickle spear, all served on a poppy seed bun. I made sure that all of our orders had everything on it, although this may have been a tactical mistake on the bratwurst, which I would have like to have tried with just sauerkraut. The bratwurst was still excellent since it was very juicy, probably because it's soaked in beer. We also had The Elvis, a smoked polish sausage, and The Dog, a traditional Chicago-style hot dog. But the best hot dog of the day was the spicy hot dog known as The Keira Knightly. What I liked about the Keira was that the spicy dog had a nice heat that balanced out the other flavors that were packed into the dog, especially the sweet relish. The other dogs were good, but Keira's relative hotness separated it from the pack. The menu described the Keira Knightly as ""mighty hot,"" but I thought it was a pleasant, mild heat. By comparison, the andouille sausage known as the Salma Hayak (which we didn't order) is said to be ""mighty, mighty, mighty hot."" If this is true, then Salma is hotter than Keira in both hot dogs and real life. Still, as good as the hot dogs were, they were nearly eclipsed by an even more impressive concoction...duck fat fries. That's right...french fries fried in duck fat. I shouldn't have to say anything more except that duck fat fries are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, so plan your trip accordingly.

2008-11-05,3.0,"Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I tried the wrong thing. Either way, I'm not in a hurry to return and give Hot Doug's a chance to change my middling first impression. I went on a Tuesday around 3 p.m., so the line wasn't too bad (and may even have been longer than usual because it was Election Day). I took note of the punk rock blasting over the speakers and the kitschy, irreverent decor without particular enjoyment or dislike, although I did appreciate the giant faux-Magritte painting of Hot Doug's signature sausage captioned ""ceci n'est pas une hot-dog"" hanging in the men's bathroom. Determined to forgo the standard offerings for a more exotic special, I initially settled on the beef Landjaeger with chili-garlic mustard and smoked Gouda. As much as I hate to admit it, though, the $5.00 price tag, low in comparison with the other specials, made me think I'd be missing out if I didn't upgrade to something more luxurious. I switched to the Portuguese Linguiça with smoked paprika dijonnaise and Castelinhos cheese for $7.50. I skipped the fries, which many of you may consider an insane, inexcusable offense. Maybe I will try them at some point. The sausage harmonized well with the dijonnaise and the white, sharpish cheese, which half-melted into a slightly coarse, spreadable goo. The bun was probably the best I've had with anything hot dog related. The thing is, it didn't transcend, didn't become something greater than the sum of its parts as my mouth chomped it all together. It didn't have nearly the same effect for me as something like a burger at Kuma's, which is practically right around the corner and shares both a subculture aesthetic and a fixation on meat. The sausage was solid, good, but by no means excellent. One of my strongest beliefs about food is that you should be able to make something that's more than just good when you're throwing fat around like Pollock used paint. I will admit that I'm not a huge sausage or encased meat person in general, but I don't think the onus of my disappointment lies in the fact that I don't go apeshit for hot dogs. I suppose I owe Hot Doug's at least a sample of one of its more bread-and-butter offerings, but I'm just not that motivated to after my first experience; the thing that's most likely to influence me to return is the Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda they keep in the cooler.",0.8358,0.824,0.102,0.074,0.5366402116402117

Sometimes I just love to wander around a city by myself. I had offers from his mom to go shopping but something that day just said ""Go on a solo mission"". I google mapped Hot Doug's after hearing so much about them and got myself to the Blue Line (was staying in a hotel downtown). Got on the bus and got off at Hot Doug's.  There was a long ass line around the corner of the building. I went to the back of the line. Wow this place must be really good. So I stood in line for about 25 minutes while chit chatting with my neighbours in line. I finally got towards the menu and I wanted 2 hot dogs but I knew I wouldn't be able to have both since it was Saturday and I intended on having the duck fat fries. I ended up choosing the Kobe Cincy Dog with the fries and a drink. I even got a picture with Doug while in line.  The hot dog was amazing. I usually feel ill after eating dogs but this time did not give me the ill feeling. I wish I could have tried the Jerk hot dog. I love Caribbean flavours. All of the specials sounded great. And I spent $11 with tip. Amazing! I love how Chicagoans takes food to the next level even when it's something as simple as a hot dog.

I got the foie gras hot dog with truffle butter and foie gras mousse, and a jalapeno chardonnay rattlesnake dog with smoked gouda and chipotle mayo.

I had bites of both, and while they were certainly more traditional dogs, both were perfectly executed.  We also got an order of regular fries and an order of duck fries (served on friday and saturday ONLY) for the sake of comparison. The duck fries are cut thinner, a little crispier, and have a bit of a more complex flavor, but both options are ridiculously tasty.

I am an extreme latecomer to the Hot Doug's bandwagon, having intended to go there for the last 2+ years but only making the trip in late '07. My first time, I was in the area running errands on a Saturday afternoon, and it was bitter, bitter cold outside. The line still wrapped around the corner of Roscoe and almost to the alley. As I was watching, the line was always moving so I decided to brave it. I stood with all the veteran Hot Doug's patrons, who were all talking about what they were going to order, what they had ordered in the past, etc. The girl behind me was ordering just a single regular hot dog and fries... considering all the incredible specialties, I was impressed that the regular, buck seventy five hot dog was that awesome that someone would wait 30-40 minutes in freezing cold for one.  You get to the counter and regardless of the fact that they are slam-packed busy, Doug will ALWAYS have a kind word, usually a joke or two for you before he takes your order, and if you want a recommendation he is usually dead on.  After my initial visit, I went through a hardcore addiction phase where I was going several times a week (almost never a wait of more than a couple minutes on Mon-Thurs), but have slowed down to once a week or every other week now.  Formula for a perfect business? Keep it simple, be better than everybody else at what you do, charge a fair price, and be good to your customers.

As expected the wait was over an hour, the owner was very personable and the food was exceptional.  I ordered a Thai Chicken Dog with peanut sauce and coconuts. I couldn't have dreamed up a better hot dog to suit my taste buds! My roommate ordered the Gyro dog with olive paste and feta - which also suited her to a T. Doug knows exactly what we want better than we do! He's in our heads! The fries in duck fat and cheese were also out of this world.  Now that I've been to Hot Doug's once, here are my expert tips on making your next hot dog venture a great one: 1. Have a light snack before making the trip.

I recall one solitary chicken sausage special that I thought was a bit ""eh"" on the Hot Doug's scale, but otherwise the food is always top notch. I almost always order something from the specials menu, often a variety of chicken sausage, but the regular menu items are also great.  The fries are insanely good, and I've never even gone for the duck fat fries because I can't imagine them being any better than the ones served every other day of the week.  Also, their fountain Coke is top notch. Best fountain Coke in the city, I think. Saturday will always be busy. I've arrived there at 10:30 some mornings, thinking I'd beat the line, and it's always at least out the door by that time, if not firmly around the corner. If you can come mid-afternoon during the week (yes, I work a full time job in the Loop too, but sometimes am going to/from the office during the day and sneak by), there will barely be a line and you can have your food in under ten minutes. If I moved from Chicago, Hot Doug's would probably be one of the things I missed most, and friends of mine who have moved list Hot Doug's among the top things missed about the city.  If I could give Doug more than 5 stars, I would.

The second time I went was with my sister and her boyfriend from New York.  We went at 10:30am on Wednesday and didn't have to wait at all this time.  To be frank: they'd waited 45 minutes for a hot dog at Pink's in LA and still thought the Pink's dog was far superior.  This time, I got a grilled Chicago-style dog and the infamous, forbidden foie gras pheasant sausage.  (I hate the concept of foie gras but still had to give it a shot based on the history surrounding it.)  The Chicago dog was merely ok and included grilled onions yet no sport peppers (my favorite).  Aside from being super salty, the specialty sausage was bland.  That's not just the guilt talking.  We all split an order of fries, and there's no discernible difference between the regular fries and the duck fat ones.

2008-07-13,5.0,"This is the ULTIMATE sausage shop.  Greatest sausage I've ever had.  seriously.  If this shop were sponsored by Squaresoft or Origin, it would be called ULTIMA SAUSAGE.  Apparently Doug went to Kendall Culinary School in Chicago, but then decided that ENCASED MEATS were his life calling, and he opened up this temple to delicious sausages of all sorts (made by himself of course). So hear's the lowdown.  There's pretty much always a line.  Deal with it.  expect it.  It probably takes about 30-40 minutes to get through on a typical day.  While in line you survey the vast selection of gourmet sausages, and classics like the classic chicago dog, andouille, louisiana hotlinks, etc.  They have DUCK FAT FRIES on Fri and Sat.  Yes you heard me.  Best. fries. evah.  When you get to the counter, you order directly from Hot Doug himself.  Doug is very friendly and cracks some hilarious jokes.  No condescension.  He just shares with you a mutual love of the encased meats.  You can customize your condiments as much as you like.  He also gives you the option for preparing the sausages:  grilled or steamed. A few of the sausages I had (I'll post a pic of the menu from the wall as well): -Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage, with black truffle mustard, foie gras mousse, and some course salt sprinkled on top.  As I was eating this, my life flashed before my eyes, and I wanted to tell my parents I loved them.  and then it was done.  and I wanted another. -the classic Chicago dog.  The classic chicago dog (for the uninitiated) is a boiled/steamed Vienna Beef hot dog with sliced tomatoes, relish, onions, a long dill pickle, and celery salt.  Doug's has grilled onions instead of the raw onions, and he recommended I get it grilled instead.  he was right of course. -the spicy smoked alligator sausage, with shrimp remoulade and a peppery brie-like cheese (affinois?  thanks michael l!).  Spicy and exotic, it was just exciting to eat a formerly endangered species....haha.  but seriously, everything came together beautifully on this sausage. -citrus burgundy pork sausage, with course dijon mustard and smoked gouda chunks.  people that know me know that I love pork.  I'm chinese.  This sausage made me want to propose marriage to pork.  you know.  like the scene in harold and kumar. -the Ribeye sausage, with horseradish cream sauce and fried onion strings.  This was (as the name) a very ""pure"" sausage.  just encased ribeye--the grind was rather course as well.  a complete departure from your standard spiced sausages. -smoked duck with chili-garlic aiolli, blue cheese, and drizzled with honey.  I didn't think I'd ever get better duck sausages than the rosamunde grill in SF.  Doug proved me wrong, happily. I took pics of all of these, and posted them here.... so check em out. oh and don't forget to get your DUCK FAT FRIES I can't recommend this place any more.  seriously.  the only thing that could make it better would be a large selection of finely crafted beer.  :)",0.9982,0.79,0.179,0.031,0.5531207354736766

The people who work here really seem like they are having a great time, too. The duck fat fries are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. The hot dogs are all incredible --  you really can't go wrong no matter what you order. Even the music is a little unexpected (Sammy Davis Jr.s The Candy Man!). I didn't mind the line at all.

2008-05-23,5.0,"It has been a year since my one and (sadly) only trip to Hot Doug's, but I continue to proselytize to everyone and anyone that I can corral into conversation, regardless of the topic.  I came down from Madison last year around this time to experience May Fest with my old college friends as a reciprocal to Bockfest at the Capital Brewery.  Friday night was a tour of the bars in Bucktown, and Saturday morning was not the best I've ever felt.  My friend tells me to get dressed because we're driving to a hot dog restaurant and we'll likely have to wait for a half hour or more.  I frankly wasn't too excited, because my opinion was that nothing is worth waiting that long, let alone a frickin' hot dog.  Obviously, I stand corrected. We picked up a few people on the way and parked near some nondescript bungalows and low-slung industrial buildings.  I thought we were in the wrong place, but there at the corner was a small building with a line of people out the door and around the side.  It took us about 45 minutes to get up to the counter, all the while my friends and other people in line kept telling me how great of an experience I was in for.  Against this kind of build-up I figured there would be a bit of a come-down.  It turns out this was not the case at all.  At first I had planned on being conservative in what I chose, but as I waited in line my courage grew and I ended up with the Game of the Week, which was an elk sausage with a smooth French cheese made with bacon and topped with a spicy Dijon mustard.  As my conservative ""back-up"" I went with a steamed Chicago dog, and we all split an order of the duck fat fries.  Since I was going all out, I got a can of the Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray celery soda.  It was, without exaggeration, one of the most enjoyable meals of life. The elk sausage with the bacon-flavored cheese and mustard was the perfect combination of spicy and savory, and the texture of the sausage was exactly right, balanced by the smoothness of the cheese.  The duck fat fries were exemplary - perfectly fried and salted, hot right out of the fryer.  The Chicago dog was last, and honestly I can't say that I really remember it other than being very good.  At that point I was a bit mind-blown, since despite everyone touting the praises of this place my expectations were actually exceeded.   Oh, and it turns out that I really like Cel-Ray too.  A year later I still find myself raving about the place.  Yeah, it's as great as everyone says.  Obviously everyone knows this, hence the number of reviews.  But I still think about detouring there every time I come down the Kennedy, and I have determined that, if anyone wants to go, we could leave Madison by 9 and be there by lunch.",0.9956,0.838,0.13,0.032,0.49250088183421525

Also, at this point you are really hungry because even though you were well aware of the notorious nature of the lines due to their laughably short hours of operation, you came just a little hungry to begin with. But now the pain is intolerable.

I never thought I'd pay more than $2-3 for a hot dog... no matter what kind of meat or cheese was on it. Overall, this place is unique and their dogs are great. Their cheese fries are my favorite... I don't think I've been there without ordering it.  A few things that annoys me is that there is : 1. there is a line out the door almost every single day and the wait is close to 30-40 minutes (I timed myself). I went on a really nasty rainy day thinking there wouldn't be a line and to my amazement... the line was still there. 2. It's open from 10-4pm mon-sat. 3. it's cash only.  4. You can easily spend too much money here. Not only are their specialty dogs expensive, but after waiting in that long ass line, you feel the need to make it count.  If you don't mind waiting in line for 30 minutes to get a hot dog, definitely go and try it. As for me, the long lines, inconvenient hours, and cash only policy (i never carry cash... I believe in the debit card system) keep me from coming here more often and I live a block away... but maybe the fact that I can't get it whenever I want makes it that much more appealing. Whatever the case, if you haven't tried it yet, make sure you stop by and if you're turned off by the long lines, try going there right around 3:45pm... just don't be late cause they will shut you out.",-0.5977,0.855,0.071,0.074,0.6326757369614512

2008-05-02,5.0,"Obligatory Hot Dougs review time. How have I waited four years to try this place? Honestly, the thought of a 45 minute wait to experience Doug Sohn's sausage creations had me mighty skeptical. I picked yesterday, a Thursday, after lunch when I had a free moment to avoid the lines an see if this place was for real. It's FO'REAL! Walk in and prepare yourself for overstimulation. Once inside, you have about a minute to review a wall of encased meat selections ranging different meats, cheeses, styles and preparations -- no easy task if you like just about everything.  Want a simple Chicago Dog? You're covered. Andouille sausage more your thing? Get it on. How about an Artichoke-Parmesan Chicken Sausage with Artichoke-Cumin Pure and Marieke Fenugreek Cheese? Hey, it's on special today! Along with about a dozen other zany creations listed on their website, updated daily. Maybe the best ordering approach is to do your research before heading over.  Otherwise, you feel like a schmuck when you get to the front of the line with a dumbfounded look on your face, much like I did yesterday. I was fortunate, Hot Dougs isn't just a vast wonderland of encased meat selections, but is also home to one of the friendliest staffs I've encountered. Doug himself takes your order at the counter, and amidst the frenetic pace of order-taking and filling, still takes time to answer questions, show a smile and thank you for stopping in.  I threw a few taste preferences at him. Spicy, smoky, cheesy and crispy? He was happy to recommend a spicy pork sausage, soaked in Cherry Coke, grilled to a crisp and topped with provolone and barbecue sauce. ""And don't forget,"" he added, ""get your cup and help yourself to free refills."" It's silly. Make me some good food, treat me like you're happy I'm here, and I'm sold on you for life. I'm sooo easy. Overstimuli continues at your table. Between the sausage mongering, the hustle and bustle, the soundtrack above is something out of that college rock station overnight show you felt bad-ass listening to. The walls are covered in Elvis merch, signed local celeb photos and shrines to the art of the hot dog. Check out the pictorial history of encased meats. Who knew that Hot Dogs were present at the dawn of humanity, the Roman Empire and during the moon landing?! Funny stuff. Did I mention that my sausage was perfect? Holy crap. Crispy, flavorful and gooey with melted provolone. I didn't get to try the duck fat fries (head up: only served on Friday's and Saturdays), but their everyday fries are delicious, complete with the skins and tasting like they just came out of a back-yard deepfryer!  Unreal. I'll be back, if only to creep my way through the expansive menu. We are fortunate to have such creativity in this city.

Doug is a culinary genius and a hell of a nice guy to boot. Hint for vegetarians: order the Pete Shelley / Steve Diggle / Howard Devoto / Buzzcocks-themed veggie dog with any of the toppings off the specialty dogs.

2008-03-02,5.0,"OK..I'm a food snob (and a good cook). Been this way for a very long time. I first discovered Hot Doug's in a small blurb in Gourmet magazine touting the duck-fat fries (old location, MANY years ago). My husband is a duck freak (anywhere anytime for any reason at all) and I'm an enabler.  My particular weakness is food related nostalgia and there it was, on the list...thuringer.  I hadn't had thuringer since the 60s, and I hesitated to order it because that might have soiled the divine memory, that is if it wasn't great.  OK, I guess we all know it was spectacular...Recently my favorite sandwich underwent a curious name change; from the Don Rickles to....the Marty Allen.  People of a certain age know who Marty Allen is - an 85 year old comic who was in his heyday at least 40 years ago.  Maybe I just love the droll sense of humor....Another HUGE draw for me is selzer water on tap.  It's bar none, my drink of choice.  I guess I've dragged at least 20 people there over the years including my husband and 4 adult kids - as I said I'm a food snob and people take my food recommendations seriously.  As far as I'm concerned, Doug does everything right.  That he and only he takes only cash gives him tremendous freedom.   Worth mentioning is that his staff has been incredibly stable.  I remember the guy from the 1st location (others might call him a bus boy, I'll call him a ballet director) who makes that tiny room function like a precision machine . Also, tip jars are usually offensive (to me, anyway) in Starbucks type businesses, and they're way too common these days, but in this setting it is entirely appropriate - the jar is labeled ""for the people doing the actual work"". That really does keep the prices insanely low.  I love the fact that Doug treats everyone well.  I must admit, I have felt a bit foolish standing outside in 10 degree weather, but for every reason previously stated, I will continue to do so - but hope that the weather will let up a bit when the crew gets back from their latest well-deserved vacation.  As Dr. Suess taught me in his only non-rhyming book, The King's Stilts, ""when you work, you really work, and when you play, really play""  Have a great time guys!",0.9444,0.825,0.105,0.07,0.5229653679653681

Even when it's cold, people stand outside to eat these links. The seating is ample and turns over quickly. The place is decorated in red, yellow and blue with Hot Dog memorabilia covering the walls. The regular menu includes a good set of basics which can be dressed up or down. There's a Chicago style hot dog, bratwurst, thuringers, spicy links, corn dogs, veggie dogs, chicken sausages, the list goes on and on. The fries are very good, and on Fridays and Saturdays they offer duck fat fries. There are specialty sodas and fountain drinks available. They have daily specials, including a game special. Sometimes, it's a bison link, sometimes rattlesnake. And the toppings are perfectly coordinated to match the meat selection. My favorites so far have been the game special Bison hot dog with whatever heavenly toppings he recommended that day and the Sante Fe style chicken sausage with brown mustard, tomatoes and carmelized onions. My boyfriend likes the occasional pork hot link special, with coca-cola bbq sauce, the thurginer and the brat.

Hot Doug's on Cali?? with a line down to the alley!! what the?!

Doug is still the same lovable wiseguy he always was, the prices have stayed super-reasonable, and almost every sausage combination offered is still a home run (I'm particularly partial to the ribeye steak sausage with chimichurri sauce and crispy fried onions, and the Teuben, a corned-beef sausage with sauerkraut and Russian dressing). Doug's is the only eating place in the city, if not the entire country, for which I can justify standing in line for 45 minutes on a weekend afternoon (unlike several well-known Lincoln Park/Lakeview brunch spots, whose popularity I find absolutely incomprehensible). Once inside, the place is a well-oiled machine; somehow there is never, ever a wait for a table once you've placed your order.

I do my best NOT to think about the fact that Doug's is 2400 or so miles from where I live, but inevitably that realization surfaces and all I can do is rock back and forth and cry myself to sleep.  I bought a Hot Doug's t-shirt and I wear it around town, roaming the streets and simultaneously talking to no one and everyone about The Sausage Superstore.

The next time you're on the street in any big city and someone nearby is talking loudly to no one in particular, don't just assume it's the gibberish of a homeless guy who ran out of insurance money and didn't get his meds. Don't just write it off as some fancy stock broker making high stakes 6-figure trades on a bluetooth hands free earpiece that you can't see.  It very well could be another Chicago transplant, another now devoid soul, who foolishly went back to the Windy City for Thanksgiving only to discover that Doug closed up shop for the long weekend.  This rambling person might teach you something, something significant and life-changing, something about what can be done with encased meats that your senses will never forget.

For some reason, while paying $7 for a single sausage seems expensive, paying $10 for bits of six different sausages seems more than fair.

Why not move to a larger space, or at least have more than one register? 2. Not open for dinner and far away. It's extremely hard to get here in time to eat lunch. With the long line and the drive time to get all the way out there, there's no way it will work unless you get two hours for lunch. 3. Cash only- With sausages costing as much as $9.00, this place should take cards. And there's NO ATM. So if you didn't bring cash you just waited a half hour in line for nothing (happened to me). It seems that Doug knows his food is the best and makes enough to be happy with it.

The biggest tables sit six people, max. Not to mention that groups larger than this eat up the space. If you can split yourselves up, more power to you. Otherwise, don't bring your entire extended family from the suburbs. 2) This place is NOT good for people with strollers. Strap that baby holder on and leave the stroller in the car. There was a couple with TWO strollers (for three kids) in line today. When they got to the door they finally said out loud, ""Maybe we shouldn't take the strollers inside."" Really? No kidding? Hot Doug's is a SMALL, small little joint. There's roughly 10 tables. No strollers, darn't! The lines are always unbelievably long, and there isn't any space for your strollers! Oh, and my final gripe to visitors of Doug's (and especially the suburbanites who see Doug's as a tourist attraction)? When you're done, LEAVE. GET UP AND LEAVE. Don't dawdle. Don't read the sports page. Don't examine the meaning of life or consider all the silly jokes you could stay to the people waiting in line (""Sorry guys!

2007-05-13,5.0,"This is where I go to train in my hot-dog speed eating. Here's why: All their hot dogs are more akin to sausages rather than the soft things you get from Vienna Beef. The casing is gamier so it's chewy and the meat is spiced up much more than your average dog. The other sausages are fantastic for training too. Of course, if you're not an aspiring competitive eater, this stuff is great too. The duck fat fries are awesome. I can definitely tell the difference the same way I can tell the difference between Coke/Pepsi. It's a textural difference of crispiness and you can taste the duck like the way you can taste bacon in a carbonara sauce. It helps if you don't eat fries with ketchup or know the taste of duck very well. If you're a ketchup using non-duck eater, don't bother because you probably won't notice the difference. And while I appreciate the complimentary cheese and sauces for their more exotic sausages, might I suggest getting them plain? I find the cheese and sauces to be delicious but overpowering for some of the better sausages. (Digression: I'll never understand Chicagoans and their aversion to ketchup because when you add emerald relish, hot pepper, tomato, celery salt, mustard, onions, and pickle; you are essentially eating a hot-dog flavored salad and the addition of ketchup will barely perverse the flavor of a good dog. If the flavor of the meat is crucial, eat it plain. And if ketchup ruins the flavor so much, why would you add it to everything else but hot dogs? Message me if you care to discuss the finer points of hot dogs and ketchup.) So many places will tell you about how awesome their hot dog is, but if it's a boiled Vienna Beef, what is the difference really? Is it so good you could eat it plain and love it?

2007-04-26,4.0,"True thing about the long lines...but I've only gone on weekends during lunch hour.  I've only actually waited once for it which was the first time I went because my fiance raves about that place.  I got the andouille that time but it was only pretty good.  It wasn't worth the wait.  For some reason he didn't order me the special meats which are more expensive: about 6-8 bucks (this includes tax) for one of them.  But go for the specials if you want the good stuff.  The others are just normal any good hot dog stand type stuff in terms of their quality. I've tried the special meats a few times already.  The wild boar or pork sausages are quite good. Yesterday, a Wednesday in April 07, the line wasn't out the door but there were about 5 people ahead of me so the wait wasn't too long. I tried the Luol Deng (Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Green Apple Cream Sauce and Smoked Almonds...this was really good by the way.) and the Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Harlech Horseradish Cheese was good too.  I think out of the two I liked the Luol Deng more because the horseradish cheese on top stuck to my teeth too much (i rate food on texture a lot).  Who knew smoked almonds and green apple cream sauce would go well on a sausage.  It was a little sweet but not too sweet.  I really enjoyed that one.  I'm just sad that it costs so much to get two of the specials but for me to be full I need both of them.  I usually get two hot dogs if I go to other hot dog stands to get full.  I didn't have enough money for fries but it's okay since I was full.  I spent about 13 bucks for those two and free ice water.  Duck fat fries are delicious but you can only get it on Fridays and Saturdays. Oh and cash only!!  Hopefully they allow credit cards soon. The seats are usually pretty much filled up.  Oh and they close early like 4pm, fyi.  They get quite good business even though they have short hours.  The owner, Doug, is smart and pretty well off I think.  He's also really nice, he's the one taking orders behind the counter.  Make sure they're open before you go too.  Their website updates daily or weekly?  Street parking is possible.  Usually it isn't hard nor takes longer than 5 minutes to find.  But a lot of people carpool too.",0.9986,0.755,0.228,0.018,0.5905242905242906

2007-03-09,5.0,"Add me to the growing list of Doug Sohn's admirer's.  I was told to go to this establishment in July, but I don't live nearby and the hours are such that it made it difficult to go.  I finally got around to going there today, since I will be leaving Chicago soon and I needed to get one last Chicago-style hot dog and Hot Doug's was where I heard I should do it.  Despite my many months of waiting and extremely high expectations, Hot Doug's met and exceeded all the lofty standards I had put forth in my head. The decor is just tacky enough to be wonderful.  Celebrity pictures, a large timeline on the history of encased meats in Chicago, and other assorted eye candy hang on the walls, which are all bright colored.  Everything in the place is brightly colored, from the fans to the HVAC vents (mostly in blue, yellow and red).  The menu is very matter-of-factly presented with item listed (most going by celebrity names) and a brief description of what it is under the title.  Next to that are a listing of the daily specials, which include any range of zoo animals ground up and served in natural encasements.  Behind the counter, Doug himself takes the orders and just adds up the tab (tax is included in the price).  Everything is very reasonably priced, even the gourmet meats. Now, while the inside of this eatery does not hide the fact that this is a hot dog joint, the food may give you pause for thought.  This is high class food in an easy to handle package.  The hotdogs are absolutely delicious and the toppings (onions, sweet relish, pickles, tomatoes, sport peppers, mustard, celery salt) are all incredibly tasty (the relish is some of the best in the city).  The hot dogs themselves are great, with just the right amount of snap and a good bit of spice added to the meat to give it the perfect flavor.  Piled high with all the trimmings, the Chicago-style dog, 'The Dog' is only a $1.50 and is amazing, best I've ever eaten. Other offerings are also phenomenal.  I had the 'White Wine and Dijon Rabbit Sausage with Truffle Sauce Moutarde and Port Salut Cheese' in addition to 'The Dog.'  Doesn't sound like fast food, eh?  And for $6, you'd still think it is fast food, but it sure doesn't taste like it!  The rabbit sausage was mild and flavorful with a cooked-over-a-wood-fire taste to it.  The truffle sauce was also very good, with the truffle flavor complimenting the rabbit nicely and not overwhelming it.  The port salut cheese was fantastic as well, a great soft cheese with a bit of bite, like Gorgonzola. One last recommendation is to get the duck fat fries.  Best fries I have ever had.  They smell fantastic and taste even better.  Words can't describe how good these little sticks of potato are. My only complaints are the fact that the location is no where near me (and getting farther away since I am leaving the city), the hours are pretty poor if you don't live or work nearby, and there is always a line.  Then again, for last part basically explains the first two complaints.  This place is so good, it doesn't need to move or stay open any longer.",0.9986,0.777,0.184,0.039,0.5796274250440919

The only thing keeping the review of Hot Doug's from reaching 5 stars is the lack of heating lamps outside for the 20 minute wait. We had a Chicago dog, duck fat fries, and the pheasant sausage with truffle and foie gras. The run down: 1.) The Chicago Dog was good, but standard. If it was just the Chicago dog, the wait would have not paid off. 2.) The duck fat fries were delectible and come in huge portions. These are some bad ass MF's. My first instinct was to grab them and run home where no one could steal them from me. 3.) The big ticket item was the Pheasant Sausage with foie gras and truffle. I can not describe the goodness that is encased pheasant with such rich ingredients other than to say, bring a friend and split it. It is way too good to scarf it by yourself. I feel that had I not had a Chicago dog and split the Pheasant dog, I would have enjoyed it less. All in all a very solid experience. Doug was very friendly.

This is not to be confused with health food.  This is an epicurean delight for people who enjoy food.  Don't forget the duck fat fried fries, only available Fri/Sat.  Its a nice way to top the meal off.  Though, I just get 2 dogs and call it a day w/ the one of the awesome drink choices.  How many places stock Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray?? My recommendation is the Don Rickles w/ a Game of the Week pick. hotdougs.com You can take the California exit off of 90/94 and just head North.  Its on the SW corner of Roscoe and California.",0.9878,0.786,0.192,0.022,0.634375

2006-04-15,4.0,"It has great atmosphere, great service, good clientele, cleanliness, and tasty dogs and fries with a great selection.  I think it is slightly overrated.  I don't think it's worth a 30minute wait.   I did try the duck fat fries- in my professional french fry opinion, these duck fat fries are not really ""fries"".  They're more like potato sticks or even potato crisps.  Crispy on the outside, dry and mushy in the inside.  But they are delicious!  I wonder if their regular fries are more like real (in true Belgian definition) fries.",0.9797,0.722,0.262,0.016,0.4449118589743589
2006-04-06,5.0,"Doug has dragged the traditional corner hot dog stand kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century without losing the fun and taste of the original.  A regular hot dog is only a buck and a half and is available steamed, grilled, deep-fried, or deep-fried AND grilled.  Caramelized onions are not only available, they're standard issue.  The fries are nothing short of perfect -- hand-cut and not too greasy.  The specials are what set Hot Doug's apart, however.  Sausages made with exotic meats and topped with unusual sauces and cheeses are on the menu side by side with the rest of the fast food fare.  The nostalgic decor is heavy on sausage and Elvis memorabilia.  The mens room has a picture of a bun with a hot dog in it -- the ladies room, an empty bun.  Hot Doug's is a MUST for any serious hot dog lover!",-0.3834,0.861,0.054,0.085,0.6564102564102563
2005-10-15,5.0,"This newer location of Hot Doug's is at the relatively obscure corner of California and Roscoe. You wouldn't think it was too obscure once you see the lines to this popular joint that always extend past the front door. The menu features various encased meats named and renamed after celebrities (Madonna, Elvis, Jennifer Garner, ex-Cub Shawon Dunston), plus various daily specials that can be quite exotic. I had a pheasant sausage topped with rich dabs of cheese and cognac mustard, and my friend had the ""Louis Nye"" with Greek sausage, feta cheese, and artichoke. If buffalo and rattlesnake are too wild for you, the menu also has regular hot dogs and plump corn dogs too. On Fridays and Saturdays splurge on the duck fat fries, a heap of crisp shoestring potatoes that can otherwise be found only at a good bistro. If you are dining in the colorfully decorated seating area, get a small pop and get free refills while jamming to the rockin' soundtrack. The line is always long, but it moves fast thanks to very friendly and efficient service.",0.9708,0.871,0.129,0.0,0.5018952062430324
2005-09-15,5.0,"I'm glad that Hot Doug continues to do well at his new location, I missed his old Roscoe Village shop for a while, but the California Av. location does have its advantages, such as more street parking!  I don't recall that I've ever tried a ""regular"" hot dog here as I am always intrigued by the specials & ""gourmet"" offerings.  There is ALWAYS a line out the door on saturdays, but the food is worth the wait, you can spend your wait time reviewing the different menu options .  The counter is run by Doug himself & the atmosphere is very friendly in spite of being very very busy.  The duck fat fries served on Fridays & Saturdays are not to be missed!  I only wish Hot Doug's was open on Sundays too!",0.8368,0.803,0.13,0.067,0.5680979020979021

One of my friends used to work for Doug and I know for a fact that he treats his employees really well, so I completely support his establishment--even if I do stick to the meatless dogs (which are, for real, the best around). I'd love to see him back over in his old hood, though. His place was such a nice fit.",0.9909,0.622,0.359,0.019,0.45333333333333337
2005-08-01,5.0,"How can you fault the place? The motto on the back of the T-shirts: ""There are no two finer words in the english language than encased meats, my friend"" That pretty much says it all. Doug is serious about his sausages and sausage kitch. The place is decorated in preposterous primary colors and the air is filled with Violent Femmes era catchy post-punk. Often there will no free tables and a line out the door, but Doug gets people in and out as fast as he might, never hurrying anyone off the tables or counterspace.  They offer a range of traditional sausages at amazingly reasonable prices($1.50 dogs?!?! Seriously.), and they also offer specialty sausages, like the celeb of the week for between $5 and $10. Nice. To have these exotic combinations, like Thai chicken dog, or a tequila chicken sausage with diablo mustard and salsa is a treat for someone like me who wouldn't eat hot dogs otherwise. The duck fat fries are excpetional and decadent...I think my heart stopped for a second mid-consumption, but oh so worth it. And if you're a little more skittish, the regular fries are fresh cut and of quality, so if you're there on weekdays, it's no great loss. Plus, they've got Green River in the can. Pure Chicago. bevnet.com/reviews/green… Doug strikes me as a compressed and tightly wound man, but he never inflcits it on the customers, except in his finicky affinity to serve the hell out of them. He's friendly and decent, and even the most complex order is up under 10 minutes. Whether you're a lifelong chicagoan looking for a chicago style-dog, or a gourmand looking for a new experience, the place afor you is Hot Doug's, THE sausage superstore.",0.9389,0.785,0.125,0.089,0.5754773004773005
2005-05-13,5.0,"O why, pray tell, has no one sung praises of Hot Doug's on Yelp?  I've heard so much harping and chirping from my friends that I thought there would be a string of reviews, like the lines that go out the door at Hot Doug's.  My visit to the ""sausage superstore and encased meat emporium"" was all I expected and more.  They have everything from the quintessential Chicago dog to brats, kielbasas, veggie dogs, and--the showstopper--the game of the week which features sausages made from game (y'know...boar, pheasant, venison, etc.) meat.  I've heard that Hot Doug himself has had culinary school training, hence a little bit of haute cuisine mingles with a whole lotta encased meats made with love and Chicago pride.   When I was there, the game of the week was pheasant with cognac, and it was so delicious that every bite was heaven, but also hell because I knew it would put me that much closer to the end of the sausage.  There are various ways you can gussy up your dog including four kinds of mustard, caramelized onions, relish, celery salt, etc.  On Fridays and Satudays, Hot Doug's serves fresh cut fries made in duck fat, in addition to regular fresh cut fries.  I implore you to spend the extra $2.25 to try the duck fries because, while the regular fries are good, the duck fat imparts a subtle richness that goes so well with the slightly sweet starchiness of the potatoes.  The joint opens at 10:30am and closes at 4pm; around noon, the line starts going out the door.  You can check the menu and find out what this week's game sausage is at  hotdougs.com",0.9678,0.83,0.126,0.044,0.4732248520710059
