2008-08-28,2.0,"There was always something off with the Garden Buffet.  The strangest thing about this location was that it was HUGE, I mean WAY to much space for the amount of customers in there. I think the three or four times I stopped in there were maybe three other groups of people at most.  Last time it was just my girlfriend and I and another couple.  The food isn't really that great.  There were a couple dishes that stood out, and if you found one that you liked, you stuck with it - because it was better then the rest. As for the BBQ.  I actually never ate the BBQ there because it just looked way sub par.  The meat looked as it had been sitting out all day, which it had. i told myself everytime I walked through the doors that it was probably going to be my last time walking through them, and what do you know.. my last time I was right!   If this was in a much smaller location, and the food was fresher, they probably would have done great.  But buffets are always tough..  I mean, thats a lot of food to turn over all day - they probably were just tossing away their profits daily..",0.2559,0.892,0.057,0.052,0.44837092731829575
2008-03-26,2.0,"When I first heard about a Korean BBQ buffet, all I could think about was lots of meat for cheap. And that's what I got. I mean how bad could raw meat get?  But beyond that, there were a bunch of random Asian items (e.g. spring rolls) that belonged at a place like Country Time buffet. This place had so much potential but I feel they screwed it up by having no customers (on a Saturday night), too many tables in a shabby decor, and food that was left out in the cold. The bill for 5 also ended up being as much as any normal restaurant (so it ended up not being such a great deal anyhow). As for the meat, I guess too much is Blah!",-0.9317,0.862,0.014,0.124,0.5093149038461537
2008-03-17,3.0,"Sad that this place is closed. I came here a few times with a college friend of mine whose family used to come to this place. I think the main attraction was the all-you-can-eat Korean buffet/BBQ for ~$25. The variety of food was pretty good, and I thought everything was pretty tasty. However, I'm not Korean so I can't be sure. The place was always nearly empty whenever we went, so I felt bad about that. I guess it would have eventually gone out of business...

2008-01-13,2.0,"Twenty bucks for an all-you-can-eat Korean buffet is great.  However, I thought that the food was average.  The only meat worth eating is the kalbi.  Some of the sides didn't seem fresh. What really sucked was when we had to pay.  Their credit card machine didn't work and so we were forced to go to Washington Mutual's ATM machine next door, but the stupid thing was out of money!!!  So, we came back in, asked if there was any possibility that she could just record or call in the credit card number.  She didn't seem to have the slightest clue what we were talking about.  So, we had no choice but to leave and drive to the Chase to get money.  It was ridiculous! I don't think I'll be coming back here.  I'd rather return to Kang Nam, or try out Solga and San Soo Gab San.",-0.8632,0.81,0.065,0.124,0.4291666666666667

Admittedly, the food isn't quite as good as at establishments such as Cho Sun Ok or Solga, but you can eat however much you want. We used to have competitions between tables to see who had the biggest stack of bones. The pre-cooked food is ok, but the real reason you come is for the joy of grilling as much kalbi as you can stuff into your stomach.",0.8719,0.869,0.113,0.017,0.375

The one non-meat dish I can recommend is the rice-water.  A watered-down Korean version of horchata, there's a plain flavored and a cinnamon flavored option.  Go cinnamon.",0.836,0.846,0.131,0.023,0.4714285714285714
2007-11-03,4.0,"My last visit was like 5 years ago, but at that time, it was the only place I could imagine going for all you can eat Korean bbq.  Man, I would go with a huge pack of guys who all had assorted tricks for making sure you could eat the most meat (avoiding rice, having soda occasionally, etc.) and  basically just eat kalbi for 3 hours.  Don't remember very much of the other food, since I mainly stuck with the meat, but they did have a large selection of different things. the kalbi was really good.  so yummy...and i always felt really gross afterwards. but oh, it was so good.",0.8121,0.789,0.136,0.074,0.47696145124716555
2007-10-11,4.0,"Maybe I'm biased because I'm Korean? I'll try to write this without my kimchi screaming, galbi eating, sweating as i eat background and be as honest as I can. 4 stars. 4? Yeah. It's not a 5 because of one incident where the waitress was talking to us about her ""life"" when we had just asked her to cut the meat for us and change the fire. It was one of those 2 hour (literally) talks where the 5 other friends I were with were starting to daze off and play with their galbi. Unable to be rude, I simply listened to her and tried my best to engage her. But seriously!!! If it wasn't for her, I definitely would've given it a 5. If you're going to come here for the buffet without the bbq, it's almost not worth it. It's still relatively cheap and the food (during dinner time) is sub par with Korean food in chicago, but it's the bbq that makes this place great.  BBQ: stick with the Galbi. You'll get the actual bone with the meat. Bringing chunks of that back to your table will result in one of the wait staff cutting the meat off the bone for you (quick tip, take the bone after they cut it and literally rub it against the whole grill. It'll help the meat not stick). Other meats are OK, but tend to be a little dry. If you're going to venture outside of the galbi, try a little first... they look down (and may even charge) for wasted food. BUFFET: They pretty much have anything for any type of eater. Chicken wings prepared Korean style, rice cake in a spicy sauce, noodles with vegetables, and OF COURSE... kim chi! The green onion salad is one of my favorites as well as the radish salad (white colored- noodle looking). Again, i remind you to go during dinner time if you're going to eat just the buffet... food's just fresher then. Overall, you will come out smelling like meat. There's no way around it. But hey... if you're coming to a place like this you shouldn't be wearing clothes that you don't want smelling like MEAT. If you are bringing a date (past experience), literally tell them to bring a different shirt or to just not dress up too nicely.....?",0.9846,0.818,0.122,0.06,0.434172335600907
2007-08-24,4.0,"this is where my family goes when we get together. which isnt often. but its like a rule. all korean gatherings must take place at korean bbq pref. in buffet style. its authentic. and whats cooler than cooking your own food right in front of you and then going home with a full belly and smelling just like the food you ate as a reminder? nothing. go for the kalbi. thats the prize. if you take the ribs to your table and theyre not pre-cut, someone usually comes by and cuts it for you. and usually starts the grilling for you, but after that youre on your own. vegetarians beware- there isnt much here. the glass noodles are vegetarian. and they usually have veggie tempura. but the rice and side dishes are pretty filling. not worth the money though. i like all the bbqing and whatnot. i tend to stay away from the cooked entrees in the buffet. try the nang myung, cold buckwheat noodles, with a little mustard on it for a kick.  and dont miss the little kettles with porridge. the orange looking one is pumpkin. my fav. the other is red bean. for a refresher try the korean punches by the fruit. yum. the darker one has a cinnamon taste to it. as for the decor. its chicago korean restaurant style. very little. its not fancy. but were really eating here. a cool date place if youve got the skillz. tip- try not to overload. and dont waste. they may charge you for the things you didnt eat. like taking too much raw meat. only downfall, if youre not korean or with koreans, they might be a little cold. but, that shouldnt ruin the eating experience.",0.9889,0.853,0.131,0.016,0.5300938644688645

The decor is nothing impressive.. and parking can be a bit difficult (since there is this Karaoke bar next door).  The service is okay.. the people there are Korean so if you're not, you might resort to the pointing and head shaking.  They don't like it when you waste food.",0.4188,0.877,0.068,0.054,0.525

2007-02-12,4.0,"I was introduced to Garden Buffet a few years back by one of my Korean friends and I knew it had to be good because she has one of the most finicky appetites around, especially when it came to Korean food. I've been hooked ever since. What is the best thing about this place? I will be blunt and say one thing, and one thing only- all you can eat, DIY Korean BBQ meat.  Actually there is more than just meat here and you can make your meals as meaty or leafy as you please, with noodles and chicken in-between. In fact if you are not familiar with Korean food, start here, and you realize that there is more than kimchi and BBQ beef to be had. Overall the ambience is no nonsense, with seating areas surrounding the buffet line and large group seating around the edge of the room. Each table has a place for a container of hot coals and if the place is not too busy, the staff will cut the meat for you if you look like you're having a hard time with it. Two things you should be forewarned. Although this is an all you can eat place, there is a charge for ""excessive wastage,"" so it would be wise to move to smaller portions as the meal goes on. Secondly, the service staff seems to disappears right at the moment you need a new container of coal, leaving you to wait for a refill. To sum this place up: No nonsense from the moment you walk in the door. Keep in mind what you are here for and everything else will fall into place..",0.6597,0.884,0.062,0.054,0.5026303406738191

They easily accomodated a larger group I was with after a convention meeting and fed each of us for about $22.50 (buffet includes drinks) with tax - and considering the quality of the buffet, that's not bad at all. The tables all have charcoal grills (much nicer than the gas / propane grills at other places) and the cuts of meat to cook are rather tasty indeed. I was a wee bit on the tipsy side when we got here so I didn't eat a whole lot, but I enjoyed everything I tried (tasty chap chae, fried dumplings, potato salad, marinated black beans, seaweed salad...). Delicious kalbi! I'd like to go back when I'm actually really hungry and just dig in. They're open until 11 PM daily and have a huge seating area (banquet sized, for sure) and nice little ponds full of turtles. A few bucks more than your average Korean BBQ, but certainly not bad.

Not a cozy or fancy place at all, more of a family joint, very bright. If you have kids they will love the turtle pond with koi fish. Try to get a booth for privacy - that's the best way.
