2010-11-30,4.0,"Five of Yelp's sexiest, most scintillating people met here for a a very exclusive evening of enjoying each other's company, eating some delicious food, laughing a lot and imbibing a few cocktails. I'm sort of sad I came to know Cafe Matou so late. By the time I met CM, it was no longer possible to consider him boyfriend material. Because he was leaving for points unknown in the morning. I had to be content with a one night stand only. Ah, sweet trials of life - if this is the way it had to be, I'm glad for our brief rendezvous. I wish I could have made you my own, but I'm okay, really. Really . . . I'm *sobs quietly* fine, really. *sniff* Like the enchanting Brett D. mentioned in her review, I was saddened to see there were no garlicky escargots (I do love those little bastards) or traditional steak with frites. Ah, but there was much to be titillated by anyway on this menu. For my appetizer, I had the pate, and then you slipped me your baby gherkin alongside the silky smoothness of that liver goodness. Your baby gherkins were large on taste despite a diminutive size. Yummy pate spread on toast and covered with brown mustard . . . nothing like pate. That's what I like. I could make a meal out of this appetizer alone. Yummmmm. My entree found me in a poisson mood . . . I had the Whitefish. I was surprised to see it  breaded, a la a fish fry more often found behind the cheese curtain in the land of my birth, Milwaukee. But this whitefish was buttery and flaky and delicious. Okay, breading! In this instance, I loved it. I had a few bites of my dining companions entrees - the Bistro Beef (yum), the Salmon (delicate), and they were all very good. And then, sadly, our evening was over  - never to be repeated. I reapplied my lipstick, and stole out the door. A brief but passionate foreign affair, Cafe Matou, I'll never forget you . . .

Also, if you're rating this restaurant (or any other restaurant for that matter) for its lighting and artwork, stick to PF Chang's and the Olive Garden for ""nice ambience"" and big portions, plenty to take home to your $8,000 shnitzy-poo, I'm sure...

2010-07-31,4.0,"I've had this bookmarked* forever and finally got to Cafe Matou with some friends last weekend.  I had made a reservation for Friday at 8pm a few days ahead of time, but we probably didn't need one since there were only a few full tables.  Not sure why there weren't many peeps because I found this food and overall experience to be quite good! After devouring half a loaf of their soft French bread I started with a chilled corn soup- oh so refreshing on a hot summer night. For my entrée I had chicken covered with breadcrumbs. The portion was way too big for me (and I'm eating for 2!), but super tasty.  For dessert I was excited to try the bread pudding that so many yelpers have raved about, but it wasn't on the menu for that particular night. Instead I went with their chocolate cake, which my husband remarked looked like a debbie's swiss cake roll. Perhaps, but it sure tasted better than anything you could buy in a grocery store! Their menu changes daily and they also have an extensive wine list. I even indulged in a tiny bit of wine myself - first time since getting pregnant.  Starting the kiddo young!

2010-07-03,2.0,"My fiance and I have lived in Wicker Park for about a year and a half and have been wanting to try Cafe Matou for a while. We made an impromptu decision last night to finally try this place and I was definitely disappointed. Atmosphere: 2 stars. The decor of the restaurant is confusing. Its as though it has a split personality. The art is interesting and the lighting is comfortable. but the furniture screams nursing home! We went at 7:30 on a beautiful Friday night and Cafe Matou was downright dead! There was hardly anyone there and you felt like you had to whisper talk so you wouldn't dare be heard by any of the other diners. Food: 3 stars. We ordered salmon and duck and were simply not impressed. The salmon was pretty good, but too salty. The duck was another story. It is served in pieces and a wing. The breast pieces were good, although overcooked, and the wing was so tough it was downright inedible. I am talking so tough I thought it was going to try to beat me up in the bathroom! I actually had to speak to my waitress about the meal and she took the plate back to the kitchen to tell the chef. His response was to come out of the kitchen and confront me about my taste. He said he didn't understand my issue with the dinner and when I explained the overcooked, tough duck to him he actually argued! He said that people don't normally eat the wing of a duck and if I wanted it to be less tough he could cook it for another half an hour...hm.....I let the whole argument go and resigned myself to the fact that I had to throw away a quarter of my duck because it was too tough. Why put duck on your plate that can't be eaten? Is it garnish? This is duck, not parsley!!! Service: 3 stars. Our waitress was okay. She didn't have much personality and did not enhance our experience in any way. When we asked questions about the menu she only answered with what was already written on the menu. However, she earned some points back when I sent back my duck. It was the chef though that kept the rating down with his own confrontational and abrasive personality. He actually came out to argue with me about my reasoning for sending back the duck. If you are going to work in the food industry you need to be able to respond to criticism and not take it personally. I've ordered my fair share of duck and this was quite simply, as I described above, tough. Value: 2-3 stars. For all of the concerns that we had this place quite simply isn't worth the expensive price tag.

We recently ate at Cafe Matou on Sunday night.  I'm usually not a big fan of French food but overall enjoyed the restaurant.  It was a nice comfortable atmosphere, but did get a little noisy when an obnoxious group of people sat down next to us.  For food I had the grilled squid appetizer which wasn't really that impressive.  It tasted OK, but wasn't great.  My girlfriend had the rabbit ravioli which was pretty tasty.  For my main course I had the hanger steak which was phenomenal.  The sauce, mushrooms, and skillet potato-thingy that came with it were amazing, and the steak was cooked perfectly.  For dessert I had the cheese plate which was ok, but I felt it could have come with some bread/crostini's.  The decaf coffee tasted OK but was served in this stupid glass thing and then I had to pour from there into my cup.  This was upsetting because I could only pour half of its contents in my cup to begin with, leaving the rest of it to get cold.  Just pour coffee out of a HOT pot... I didn't have to float the bill for this meal (thanks mom and dad!) but it seemed reasonably priced considering its a higher end restaurant. The service did get pretty terrible around the dinner course.  The waiter took a LONG time to come back to the table, and I feel like we had our dessert menus for 20 minutes before he came to get our order, and then again to drop off the check. Not sure if I'll come back if I'm paying for the meal, as service problems are often that much worse when you have to pay.  But wouldn't turn down another free meal here, that's for sure.",0.9694,0.724,0.164,0.112,0.5741773132017034

I started off with some delicious bisque soup, followed by a salad.  My main entree was the Salmon, and it was soooo warm and lemony and good that I devoured every bite.  The rice pilaf - a MUST have for me with salmon - was a nice touch.  To finish, I had the warm chocolate cake.  Even though our bill was WAY more than we had first set out to pay, Cafe Matou was proof that you really do get what you pay for.  I would love to go back to try they regular menu!",0.9798,0.808,0.164,0.028,0.5075008325008324

They have a nice and reasonable deep wine list covering the low - mid price range. We had the pate's to begin and then the steak and the lamb as entrees. The price fix menu did look nice as well. All of the food we had was good, just not spectacular. Unfortunately at Cafe Matou's pricepoint there are much better places even nearby. The server pointed out that they ""make their own pate in house which sets them apart"" that may have been true 5 years ago but there are at least 3 places in Chicago making world-class house-made charcuterie and pate at similar price points.

This place is really quaint and cute inside. Their bar is a nice size and the tables in the dining room are far enough apart so that you are not tripping all over eachother. They even take your coats for you so that is a major plus for Chicago winters! We had great service and were seated even before our 7:30 reservation! Now on to the main event....the food!! The food was delicious and has something for every one ( I am what some consider a picky eater and I found many choices that I could like). We started with the ravioli of sweetbread and moules a l'indienne. My only food complaint would be that the raviloi was small in size compared to the mussles. 2 pieces of raviloi for $11...I didn't know pigs feet meat was so expensive! But the sauce the musscles were in was fabulous. Who would have thought a sweet curry sauce would be so good for bread dipping! For our entress we got the porkchop, steak and braised short ribs. I  have to be biased and say my entree, the porkchop, was the best! So tender and glazed with a sauce that had some apple flavor to it YUM! I tried a little bit of the others and those were great too. You couldn't go wrong with either. Now last but not least....DESSERT!! I had the banana chocolate bread pudding that was out of this world. It took all my might to not devour it in 10 seconds! My friend had a thyme tart and that was really good too if you are looking for something without chocolate. My boyfriend had the creme brulee and he had no complaints about it! Ohhh...and not to forget we had 2 bottles of pretty decent wine! This place was great and I could see myself coming back.

2010-02-01,5.0,"We've been to Cafe Matou six times since my last update a year ago - time to restate my passion for the place.  Cafe Matou is truly a bistro. That means small, that means casual, that means a limited menu, that means overworked waitstaff that don't fawn on you. It means the chef brings out entrees on a busy night. It means a half-loaf of delicious bread, wrapped in paper, for you to break apart and serve yourself. If you want your wine glass never empty, then have them leave the bottle on the table and pour it yourself.  If you are looking for a menu with all the ""authentic"" French dishes you learned to pronounce in high school French, go to one of the tourist traps focused on the Michigan Ave. shoppers. It won't be bad there - it just won't be outstanding. Or go to Cafe Matou and have outstanding combinations of flavors and sauces that you've probably never tried together before - authentic French cooking, that makes you close your eyes and hum as you savor the second bite. Occasionally there will be recognizable French dishes, like coq au vin, but it'll have its own distinct tastes and ingredients. As it should in a chef-owned French bistro. Chef Charlie is an artist. His menu is limited, but he always uses fresh ingredients and has enough choices to please everyone.  Even desserts can be a thrill. This visit, because it was part of the Chicago Originals prix fixe menu, I had a fabulous bread pudding. I don't like bananas with chocolate, but Cafe Matou's banana and chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce was like no other - light on the bananas, not soaked in caramel, and with a smooth rich consistency that did not taste like chucks of bread. Really delicious.  And occasionally he does follow someone else's recipe. I started with a soup made from a La Tour d'Argent recipe - Great Northern bean soup with fresh tarragon and Cognac. A definite close-your-eyes-and-hum taste on a cold Chicago night.  As I've said before: Le Bouchon for traditional bistro fare.

2010-01-30,2.0,"If you enjoy blowing money on over-priced, mediocre French food, and getting bad service on top of it, come to Matou. I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday. We both have worked in restaurants and we enjoy dining out. Because of our experience waiting tables, we tend to be forgiving and leave generous tips. But the service we got that night was so bad, I could not reward it with a good tip. We arrived at 10 pm - understandably late in the evening, but a full hour before the kitchen was supposed to close, and it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was still mostly full. No one was around to greet us. After a few minutes, the hostess came out of the kitchen and looked surprised to see us waiting there. She curtly remarked, ""I think we can still serve you..."" and so right off the bat, made us feel unwelcome.  Our server was friendly but was too preoccupied with his side work to give us any attention.  He started off well, with a nice spiel about how great this restaurant was. He told us that Café Matou was voted best French restaurant in Chicago in 2005 and 2007, serves only local organic seasonal produce, organic grass-fed beef, the menu changes daily, and ""we do amazing things here."" We were really excited at this point. We ordered quickly, knowing it was late. After a few minutes, the waiter returned to regretfully inform us that they were out of our selections. So we had to choose something else. Would've been nice if he had checked the 86 list before taking our order. I ordered a glass of wine and he forgot it. I understand forgetting things, especially at the end of a busy night, but what's worse is that he was no where to be found. We were served our appetizers and had finished eating both of them before he came again to check on us, at which point I reminded him about my wine. ""Oh dear, terribly sorry..."" Our meals were mediocre. Nothing was bad but nothing wowed us, either. We were offered coffee and dessert. My boyfriend asked for an espresso and the waiter replied, ""I'm sorry, but I just cleaned the machine."" He would've been better off lying to us and saying it was broken. But instead he's telling us that his sidework is more important than pleasing his customers. If anything, he should've asked us if we would be interested in espresso before he cleaned the machine. My easy-going boyfriend said, ""Oh no problem, I'll have coffee instead."" The waiter said, ""Hmm, let me see if we still have coffee..."" Excuse me? Are we in a restaurant or not? There were still other customers there besides us, too. What if they had wanted coffee or espresso?  He returned with a lukewarm coffee and told us, ""If it's not hot, just let me know, and I'll brew a fresh pot for you."" Ok so now you're telling us you're serving us old coffee that's been sitting around? Great. That's reassuring. Earlier, I had told the hostess that it was my boyfriend's birthday and requested a candle in the dessert. But when the waiter brought our dessert, it was sans candle. I couldn't believe it. When I asked the server if he didn't get the message, he apologized profusely (implying, but not admitting, that he had forgotten the candle) and brought us another dessert with a candle in it. We really didn't want or need another dessert. The damage was already done. If he really wanted to make up for his mistake, he should have brought my boyfriend a hot espresso, along with a candle ablaze in a side of whip cream.   After the string of disappointments, to top it all off, he messed up our bill and overcharged us. Ironically, if he wouldn't have made so many mistakes, we wouldn't have been there so late. We will not be going back.",0.9214,0.771,0.123,0.106,0.5474675324675325

There were only two other tables when we arrived at 6:30, but our server still seemed way too busy to really talk to us about anything.  We asked for her help with the extensive French wine list.  Instead of explaining or educating us, she told us one recommendation and seemed to wait to see if we would agree. We ordered the prix fixe menu & also added a salad to start.  The salad was ok, but tasted a bit unwashed & grainy.  The navy bean soup was quite tasty even though it was a bit too salty.  The next course was probably  the best.  My girlfriend had an egg & goat cheese with little toasts that was quite tasty.  I had the mussels.  These were really good except that 5 of them were unopened (so, a bit undercooked which one does not want in a mussel.) For the main dish, I had the salmon & my girlfriend had the chicken. Because I am sweet, I traded with her because she didn't like the chicken at all.  The salmon was nicely done with a lemon cream sauce, but nothing to write home about  The chicken was full of fat, little bones that you didn't see until you bit into them & lots of skin.  It was described as having bacon & mushrooms, but it seemed like a stewy gravy with some mushy potatoes & some undercooked potatoes. as well. Finally we had some bread pudding (there was only one choice.) It was not good.  Neither of us even near finished it.  Little flavor, dry.  I asked for coffee.  It was 15 minutes before she brought it.  Then, we waited 15+ minutes for our bill- even after asking for it.  Ugh.

Anyway-  I usually love French food.  This place, I would skip.   I wouldn't have been so bothered had we spent a substantial amount less...but it really didn't seem worth it.

The chocolate bread pudding was YUMMIE. Food-wise, I had just one tiny complaint...three of us choose the sturgeon as our main course and two of the three came out under cooked (like a big raw piece in the middle). However, they quickly corrected the issue, and the dish was delicious. I just thought it was a bit of a surprising error from an otherwise top-notch place. The restaurant is really cute and service was good as well. Our waiter wasn't very good in the recommendation department (he just kept saying everything was good but wouldn't pick favorites), but he was otherwise helpful.

My friend who doesn't eat cream asked for them to replace it with another sauce.  The server wouldn't tell us what the chef could replace the sauce with and was very nervous the entire time.   I ordered a glass of wine...and it was small...definitely not $10 worth of wine.   The black bean soup was ok, but way too much bean..not enough of other veggies, although the spices were nice and the cilantro was a good touch.  My cream linguini was actually delicious, heavy, but delicious.  It came with a good amount of chicken and mushrooms so I was pleased.  My friend's substitute sauce was just olive oil....very disappointing. There was no flavor, no extra taste, extremely bland.  The dessert...oye....that was BAD.  First we thought it was going to be a pudding but it came out as a slice of bread.  It looked like something you buy in a package at Jewel, except it was way worse.  This was the WORST dessert I've EVER had.  There were disgusting chunks of banana, they used large pieces of baking chocolate, suuuuper bitter and also flavorless at the same time.  I tried eating a bite of the banana cake with the chocolate at the same time and pretty much had to spit it out.   I'm disappointed to think that maybe I just went on a bad night...but it's kind of hard to forgive a bad night.  I probably won't be back...sadly.",-0.9613,0.68,0.136,0.184,0.6217884828349944
2010-01-01,4.0,"People have been telling me to come here for about a year and a half.  I don't know why I brushed Cafe Matou off for so long - I guess I just never thought about it when it came time to pick a new place to go.  The day after Christmas, my boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to have a good meal, so we were checking out the Chicago Public Radio Member Card list of restaurants and up pops Cafe Matou.  We decided to try it and - of course - forgot our member card at home, but I'm certainly not disappointed with our choice. The atmosphere is definitely très romantique, which is how I like most restaurants.  There's two dining areas, one near the bar and one in the back.  Tables are far enough apart that you don't feel like you're on top of the other diners, which is really nice.  The colors are dark, rich and very simple which makes the dining experience really enjoyable.  They have a pretty nice drink list that includes beer and cocktails, so we decided to sample some winter ales.  Our server was very knowledgeable about the libations, though, so definitely ask for wine pairing suggestions if you wish. The food was absolument fantastique.  I started the meal with the endive and beet salad which was pretty good, but kind of plain.  I did enjoy the beets, though, and it was served chilled which made me happy.  Good portion too and not super filling.  However, that was the only real disappointment of the evening.  The beer went well with the gnocci à Paris that I chose.  This gnocci plate was utterly delicious.  The gnocci were baked in a casserole dish with copious amounts of cheese and mushrooms until everything melted together into a yummy dish of excellence.  The flavors were excellent - I just had to wait a bit for everything to cool down.  The gnocci was fresh and delicious and clearly made by the chef, who creates some very fine dishes. My boyfriend had the pork dish and it was superb.  I don't usually even like pork, but the loins were cooked so well that they tasted great.  The sides of stuffed mushrooms and a potato pancake added a lot to the meal - I am kind of jealous I didn't order that instead! All in all, a really great dining experience.  A little hard on the wallet, which is a concern to me, but it's definitely worth coming back again and again.  Cafe Matou also does a monthly regional French dinner menu for $24/person, which is a fantastic deal.  There are wine pairing specials with every menu, so it could turn out to be a really great deal.  I'm definitely spending my 2010 coming to sample Chef Socher's fine regional cuisine!",0.9994,0.691,0.283,0.025,0.5871028581554897

First of all- a big thanks to Brett D. for pointing Cafe Matou out to me- for prior to her review- I had missed this place for all the years it's been open.  Since finding it- I've been here 3 times and each time I have enjoyed something new on the menu that changes each time I go. First of all, the location.  It's just far enough north on Milwaukee to escape all the craziness that exists just a few block south.  Street parking is plentiful and I have never had a problem finding a spot. From the time you push open the door- you know you are in for a special night.  We took a seat at the bar and had the bartender suggest up a sparkling wine.  She sold us on a sparkling rose that while a bit pricey ($17 a flute) was the perfect way to begin our evening as we were in a celebratory mood. Soon our table was ready and we were shown into the dining room.  Our server greeted us, welcoming us back and explained some of her favorites on the menu that night.  We ordered simply- the beef bourguignon for him and the pork chop in mushroom cream sauce for me. Both were outstanding!   For our starter- they had a sort of warm fish spread covered in cheese and green onions and while it sounds odd . . was simply amazing. Finally, on to dessert.  Along with a couple of glasses of tawny port we enjoyed a wonderful chocolate torte that was the perfect ending to a perfect evening. Dinner including  several glasses of wine, dessert and tip ran about $156 (not including the two glasses of champagne we had up front)  Not a cheap dinner by any means, but worth every penny. The next time you are looking for the perfect place to celebrate that special occasion or to just enjoy a nice dinner out- check out Cafe Mantou.  Il est tres bon!",0.9948,0.794,0.188,0.018,0.5665695415695416

(for an explanation of why I qualified the lovely kitty of 'naughty' - read the first review below...) Flawless Sunday dinner from start to finish: service (Erin was a great 'garcon', and not at all the Parisian style, thank you very much. Even after we tried on two different occasions to order a bottle of red and actually pointed at white wines - no comment - he stayed gracious and professional. I told him that if he was butchering the dish names enough we would be equal), the decor and ambiance (I love it, and the train just adds to the charm) and of course.....the food. Nom de dieu, c'etait bon! - Poelee de champignons sauvages au coulis de bettraves: chanterelles and blue oyster mushrooms sauteed in butter and shallots, topped with thin slices of aged white gouda and an arugula chiffonade, and surrounded by a beet reduction drizzle. I was reminded of my childhood days when I would go mushroom hunting in the woods with my grandpa. He was preparing them for his breakfast - when he was coming back from his night shift. I was totally grossed out. Not this time, peeps....it was just amazing. Great flavors and textures, it was so sad to swallow the last little one that I almost cried. - Bavette grillee, sauce balsamique et oignon farci au fromage de chevre: Hanger steak, cooked rare (no other way possible, especially in a French restaurant) and served with a balsamic sauce, a braised onion stuffed with goat cheese and a potato skewer. Do I really have to say it was scrumptious?!?!? I felt at home....perfectly executed. My favorite cut of meat EVAH. - mousse au chocolat blanc avec coulis de chocolat amer: soooo.....white chocolate mousse with a bitter dark chocolate sauce. Wonderful combination.....incredible balance. I thought I would only have a bite but ended up eating three quarters of it. So yes. Cats usually make me happy but this particular one tops them all.

2009-10-26,4.0,"So very torn on my review for Café Matou... I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars, but in the spirit of generosity I'm allowing the bump since my dinner was honestly very, very good. An authentic French experience however? I'm left feeling quite unconvinced...  Longing for my days in Paris, I set off to CM in the hopes of satiating my cravings for all things Français right here in my very own city. Thoughts of crusty baguette with beurre echire, terrines and pâtés, garlicky escargots, sinful steak frites and flaky mille feuille were dancing in my head relentlessly for days. Shame on me for not initiating my Matou experience with a check of the website to ensure my desires would go fulfilled... had I actually done so, my due diligence would have quickly rendered the fact that none of these items in fact reside on their menu. Le Cry. Le Sigh. Le Sad. Le Freak Out. Aaahh Freak out! Le Freak, C'est Chic.  The offerings at Café Matou were more of a loose interpretation of the authentic encounter I was so hopelessly wishing, praying and hoping for. While they do boast rillettes, charcuteries and mussels on their menu the buck stopped there for me. The bread was basic at best, no EU butter in sight and the Poulet rôti en crapaudine (read: roast chicken stuffed under the skin with a panade of butter, tarragon, garlic, onion, and cognac) which I thought could certainly pull out a win for me, had been changed that evening to a boneless/skinless chix boob with chorizo and fennel. Harrumph.  I was getting ready to write off CM entirely, but the morsels I tried (albeit begrudgingly) were nothing short of phenomenal. God, I hate when I'm wrong!! Short ribs dripping in a thick, hearty jus nestled up to velveteen puréed potatoes, crispy sea bream in the most amazing, fragrant and savory broth and, yes, even that chicken/chorizo concoction. Delicious! All of it.  Three cheers for absolutely flawless - although not quite French - execution... those mouthwatering dishes (oh, and my lovely bottle of Côtes du Ventoux) offered more than a revival... they were an absolute bail out of my not-so-Escoffier-evening.",0.9872,0.683,0.194,0.123,0.5501821036106751

But to miss Cafe Matou meant that I was  unintentionally avoiding reasonably priced delicious french food for years! Sunday night also had a prixe-fixe 3 course menu for $24 which my friend ordered. I had a charcuterie plate with chicken liver and pork rillettes--the chicken liver was silky, almost foie gras like in texture while the pork rilletes were supple but not overly fatty. My friend's leek soup was deeper and more flavorful than anything I've attempted, so I guess I haven't exactly mastered french cooking yet. All of their proteins were reasonably priced around $25, even the veal but since I had just stuffed myself at brunch, I opted for their grilled chicken legs stuffed with hazlenuts, basil, mushrooms. It was the best chicken I had this year, barring Perennial's sous-vide amish chicken, with a beautiful sauce, delicious stuffing, and perfectly cooked meat. I enjoyed the simplicity of their wine suggestions. Cafe Matou's wine specials makes a wine novice like me feel comfortable in choosing a Carlot that I'd never heard of before. The staff made me feel comfortable and well-served (my waiter always hovered near the edge of my field of vision before making sure I needed anything).",0.9948,0.776,0.212,0.012,0.6688888888888889

The dinning room is small and intimate. Our waiter suggested the red wine that was on special and we went ahead and ordered a whole bottle. It was wonderful! We decided on mussels for our appetizer.

My boyfriend ordered the duck confit with sausage. The duck was perfectly tender with just the right amount of crispiness to the skin. The food was prepared with just the right attention to detail. Dessert was the only part that was just ok. We ordered a ""mousse parfait"". I compare it to a Sara Lee frozen dessert that they just took out of the freezer, cut a slice, and put it on a plate. My boyfriend enjoyed it, but it didn't do anything for me.  However, the service was wonderful! Our server was there just when we needed him but did not hover.

2009-09-27,4.0,"I wouldn't be one that you could refer to as a French food expert. Its not that I don't enjoy it, I just don't know much about it. It is such a romantic thought for many, the language, the food, the wine... the whole mystique about it.  Is there a mystique about this place? I don't know if I would go that far. You have a lovely, fairly intimate, but friendly place. Soft, but not too soft lighting, lovely decor, warm wood, exposed brick, friendly smiling faces every where. Many return visitors, I can't tell you how many people came in and was greeted as old friends. So glad a friend made this place his choice for a dinner to celebrate his birthday.  I and nine others descended upon this restaurant to wine and dine and feast upon merriment for a few hours. We were seated up front, and when I say up front, I mean up front. As soon as you walked in, there was our table. No problem on a cool, rainy night. We sat down and really I had one thing on my mind. Was it the food? No. Was it the birthday boy? Nadda. Was it the people I was to dine with? Hella no, (though I love you all, but really no...) Wine. A long week and all I wanted was a night to imbibe on something refreshing, seductive and sensual. Of course I go straight to the wine list. Oh.. but wait! Looky here... there is more than just corn in Indiana and more than wine here at CM. A mighty bounty of crafted drinks and a pretty nice beer list. Along with everything perhaps about six or seven different glasses of wine in each red and white category. I, on the other hand started with a nice champagne followed by a rose champagne. Both lovely, but by far the rose slammed it down as the preferred bubbly of the night.  Really though, the night was not about me, but my dear friend and client,.... but this isn't a review about him... its about the place, so let's get down to the meat and potatoes and talk about the menu. What I heard about the menu and the food here, its fresh. Not like yesterday fresh, I mean today fresh. The menu is created the day you come in based on what is available and what they have found suitable for your palate. Nice. Now here is where the migraine of conundrums might start to form, what the hey nonney nonney are you going to order? The heirloom tomato salad with a soft Gorgonzola cheese shallots and a light vinaigrette? Or how about the terrine of Gruyere and Serrano ham with large cherry tomatoes bursting with flavor and juiciness? Hmmm but those dry packed scallops sound pretty fab too. Crud. I guess the duties of ""You order this, I will order this one you and you snag that one and we will share"" had to be called in. Delicious on all fronts. My terrine with toasty ham and cheese is always a winner in my book, but the scallops were flavorful and bursting with pizazz. The tomato salad was bringing me back to tomatoes that have been gently hand picked from the vine and brought to me so that my senses would awaken in joyous harmony. Nah, still liked my carbless ham and cheese sammy.  Then comes the main, oh looky looky! A lovely piece of rack of lamb, medium and some end roast bits with... *gasps*... smokey, spicy Basque chorizo?! F' yeah! The lamb rack was well done at medium, but the other pieces were a little too well done, however the sauce and the sausage made me a grinnin' and pickin' fool.  Then the dessert. Oh wait. This is me we are talking about and I came to feast, so two had to be ordered. The cheeses of the day along with a four chocolate parfait. Yes. When I do it up, I do it up right. The parfait was really good but the dark chocolate sauce was heaven on a plate. The cheese were good, though I was hoping for more of a contrast with them, though if you know me, I am never one to turn a lactose lovely down.  The wine I had, the Cotes di... what ever was one to savor and enjoy... a few times over, balanced well with my lamb and other dishes.  I will say our waiter, despite being accommodating and down right lovely, was sparse through out our meal. However! The manager among others came by to check on us. I do have a sneaking suspicion  that possibly they were a little busy that night and possibly short staffed. Really despite waiting a while for our mains, (though no complaining about the final product), I was quite happy. Pleased as punch and had several glasses to boot.  The space is great, perfect for a couple's get together, a nice romantic date or a group of friends getting together. The food is wonderful, not too heavy French food, the wine list is great, (as is the spirit list), and the service was good. Prices render this a not an every day place, but not one you have to save for a special occasion. Though I don't know if I would return with a large group, certainly a smaller group would be easy to work out. A return trip needs to be in store, but if you join me  just beware.

Before making our menu selections, our server informed us that the chef was a former saucier -- and boy did it show.  The sauces on our dishes really took the meal to a whole new level.  First up, the appetizer.  We ordered the scallops.  The scallop alone was tasty but the sauce drizzled over the plate was so delicious that our server brought over more bread to sop up the remaining goodness after the scallops were devoured.  For an entree, I ordered the pork chop.  The meat was cooked beautifully and was accompanied by some sort of potato-corn patty that was crisp on the outside and gooy on the inside.  I am a fan of multiple textures so I gobbled this up like it was my last meal.  Again, it was the sauce that really pulled the whole dish together.  It was sweet with a peppery kick and like the scallop's sauce, every last drop of the sauce was consumed before I retired my plate.  For dessert, it was hard to select from their mouth watering menu.  I opted for the Apple-Walnut Cake.  The texture was very surprising as it was gooy, almost intentionally underbaked.  The cranberry topping was another fantastic sauce and was accompanied by a dollop of crème fraîche.  Combining all the flavorings into one bite was like tasting heaven.   The service was equally as commendable as the food.  Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and quick to anticipate our dining needs.  She gave great guidance in our selections and proved her patience when we couldn't decide.  The restaurant itself is very nice.  My only gripe is the painted faux-brick walls.  I'm just not a fan.  However, I also realize that the walls would have suffered without some form of texture.  The cubism-inspired paintings were fantastic and lent well to the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.  I liked that the place was simple, open and airy while also being intimate.",0.997,0.775,0.199,0.026,0.5113731856378916

Our table was not available at the time we walked in (although we'd made reservations) and had a drink at the bar. The wait was not too long. Our second visit was just last week. This time we were seated right away and the place remained quite empty throughout our dinner, however, we felt extremely rushed for no reason by the server (server 5, no name on the bill and did not introduce herself). At one point she went in to pour water and almost knocked my fork out of my hand. Overall she seemed very hurried but yet did not check in after meals were served for at least 10 minutes to see if we needed anything.  Frankly, great food and great service = great rating. The cream of garlic was one of the best soups I've ever had. The Grilled Prairie Grove Farms Pork Tenderloin was also outstanding. Could be some of the best pork I've experienced. Wine recommendation for the pairing, not so good. I would not think of this place as good for large parties; however dinner for 2 or 4 would make it a nice place to go to. Lights are dim, small cozy room with nice art hanging on the walls, the bar is small but well stocked and the bar service is very friendly. I recommend this place for the food.

I was a tad disappointed at the wine selection, they only had a few French bottles of red under $80.  But the wines they carried were nice.

The dishes, while not cheap ($20-25) easily could have been sold at much higher prices - and still was worth every penny. The angus was top notch, and the duck was plentiful and delicious. The scallop crepe appetizer was very different and quite good. They had a few featured wines which were very reasonably priced and quite good as well.

2009-01-29,2.0,"Once again the art of fine dining is lost on me. Came here New Year's Eve with a couple of friends.  My friend had mentioned they had a special fixed price menu for NYE, but it ended up being more than we expected ($70 instead of $50).  We elected to order from the menu. AMBIENCE- this place is pretty cozy.  When you enter, you see the bar first, followed by an entry way to the main dining area.  This place probably holds about 30-40 people at most.  We had a party of 6, and were seated comfortably at a round table in the corner.  The decor was pretty minimal, but still had a touch of elegance to it. SERVICE- our server was fairly attentive, and very knowledgable about the menu.  She even had the wine list down (not that I drink, but a good sign for others that may come here).  As the night wore on, the place got busier, but her service remained the same. MENU- not a whole lot to choose from.  As with most finer dining places I've been to, they really try and focus on a few key dishes.  Selections included cheeses, cured means, salads, and mussels for appetizers, and a few meat, poultry and fish dishes for entrees (I know not very specific, but our party covered most of it). FOOD- for appetizers, our table went with the mussels in a curry sauce, a meat and cheese plate, and some scallops.  The mussels were decent, the curry sauce really carried the flavor.  As for the other two appetizers they were good, not great.   For dinner entrees ordered at our table included lamb chops, a three meat stew (duck, chicken, beef), a vegetarian pasta dish, and a steak of some sort.  While most of the table seemed content with their dishes, there were some that seemed a bit disappointed.  My friend who ordered the stew wasn't qutie expecting what he got, and was at a bit of a loss for how it tasted.  My lamb chops seemed a bit tough, though that was my own fault for not ordering them medium instead of medium rare.   OVERALL- I wasn't blown away by anyone dish, and for me, in the rare instances that I do fine dining, that's what I'm looking for.  If I'm not mistaken, they have a rotating menu, so perhaps they are better at certain times of the season.  I doubt I'll be making any repeat visits on future Chicago trips.

As soon as we started reading the appetizer menu, we were hooked!  The chef clearly makes huge efforts to make unique dishes.  We had roasted beet, a salad with duck liver, mussels and clams.  All were unique and delicious.  My friends liked the meat entrees(lamp and beef) a lot, I liked the lobster and scallop better.   Then here's the best part: the dessert!  We had 4 desserts: flour less chocolate chestnut cake, apple something, figs something, and mango something.  Sorry that I can't put the exact name here, they were in french!  All were presented very well and tasted divine! And then there's the worst part of our meal: the sommelier, cost them a star.  He has the biggest cork up his you know what, and we are not trying to be whiny here.  When we first walked in, we were 10 mins late and he made a snide comment #1 to my friend.  When he poured wine, we were at a point of conversation that we did not stop to pay much attention to him, he mad snide comment #2.  When we placed an order of wine that we knew would not go with our dinner very well, but ordered it anyway, he made sure to show his disapproval by comment #3.  All were unacceptable to me and I normally am not that picky.  He went out of his way to show his snobbishness to us.  And our waitress confirmed with us that we are not the first one to complain about him.  This is what I want to say to him: Wine guy, you work at a restaurant.  Please learn some people skills!",0.9515,0.835,0.115,0.05,0.6360990860990862

2007-08-06,4.0,"Credit to the owner of Cafe Matou. Their obsession with Cats actually works. Every place you look they had something to do with cats. That said it is not the creepy levels and is mostly subtle. The food is divine. It is well prepared and the chef seems to strive to cook local produce. I've said it before, I don't believe that organic food is always better, but I think any farmer who attempts to grow organic foods will inevitably be a better custodian of the food the grow. This will show up on your table. Enough pontificating though. :-) Cafe Matou also seems to gear itself on dining specials. I was there for example on their inaugural beer and food pairing night. They also do wine nights 12 times a year. It ended up being a fantastic night of good food and beer. They weren't as creative in their pairings as I would have liked but everything worked out amazingly well.  They do get 4 stars because for the life of me I couldn't see a regular menu. Not really a complaint though because if I was determined I would have found this information out.  They also need to know that beers like wine do have special glasses that heighten the experience.

The meh describes my parents dishes, ick describes my pork dish of which I really only got 3 or 4 valid bites because there was so much fat on the cut of meat. Bummer.

You know what I'm talking about... Back to the restaurant: It's contemporary American/French food and the chef seems really focused on trying to source his produce locally, which means the menu is very seasonally driven.  During dates I've had the black bean lasagna, which is light yet filling and various chicken dishes all of which were simple, but pulled off completely well.  I also went here for New Year's with a group. I had the venison, which was executed incredibly well. It was well-done without being completely rubbery.  The staff handed out complimentary glasses of champagne for a toast at midnight, which was nice. The service is great, all in all. Attentive and useful. In fact, one random Sunday I went with my roommate for dinner and we got our after dinner drinks comped since we had mentioned we lived in the neighborhood.

2007-03-24,5.0,"Top notch service and food here.  I love it!  I have been here several times in the past, but those were the pre-yelp days.  I went again last night to celebrate a passing score on the licensing exam I have been studying for over the last 4 months and it was perfect.  Carolyn was our waitress and she was super sweet, funny, and really took great care of us.  I love the art in this place and the decor of the room is perfect.  It has a french bistro feel, but the tables aren't too close like many french bistros.   We had a bottle of champagne in celebration...beautifully selected wine list.  And then there is the food...This chef is amazing.  Evidently, he was an economics professor or something before becoming sick with it after traveling to France.  He took a new direction in life and decided to go back to culinary school.  Great decision.  He is so personable and great with food.   I had the mussels.  They are so delicious.  If you like mussels don't pass up this appetizer.  My boyfriend had the soup, which was delicious as well.  I had the fluke fish with avocado and rice and is was so yummy.   The fish was flaky and light with great flavors.  My boyfriend had the chicken.  It is something that they don't take off the menu because, according to Carolyn, people would riot!  It was delicious too with butternut squash....mmmmm.  Carolyn, in wanting to help us celebrate, brought us a dessert of her choosing.  An apple tart thing that had sour cream on the side.  I don't think I would have ordered this had I seen it on the dessert menu, but I will definitely have it again.  It was a perfect ending to the meal.  Heavy flavors, but not an extremely heavy dessert. On the first Tuesday of every month they have a fixed-price menu that is paired with selected wines by region or specific vineyard.  The food is carefully paired with the flavors in the wine and it is spectacular.  I have been to about five of these meals and have been impressed every time I attend.  They range in price depending on the food being served or the wine chosen. I highly recommend this place and if you have a chance to go to one of the Tuesday night dinners it is an experience you won't forget.  I am pretty sure that they have fixed-price menus on some other nights, but you would have to check.",0.9992,0.697,0.267,0.035,0.5831284898676202

2006-09-17,5.0,"Cafe Matou is our new favorite restaurant.  Yes, as mentioned by a number of people, you will pay a going rate for the fabulous food, great wine, and attentive service, but we find it well worth it.  We found it from Wine Spectator (just received an award for its wine list). One of the things that I like about the place is that the menu is constantly changing.  We've gone twice in the last month and only a few things were the same.  They also have wine cellar raid nights (4th Tuesday of each month) when certain bottles are sold for great prices ($20 range).  I'm also looking forward to going to one of their wine pairing nights. The other thing I like is that the service is quite good.  When we called for reservations this last time (highly recommended as it is a little small and quite busy), the person taking it let us know a lot of people were coming at that time if we wanted to come a little earlier or later to avoid any wait at the door.  We've also found the staff to be knowledgeable and more impressive, if they didn't happen to know something we asked, they went and found out (rather than just making stuff up).  I also liked that everyone there made me feel more like I was a guest in someone's home rather than just a patron in a restaurant who they were trying to get a good tip out of. Lastly, the food is just wonderful.  My descriptions would not even begin to do justice, but as an example I had the best duck dish ever (not at all fatty, served with fleur de sel - basically really fancy salt that was fabulous).  Desserts just melt in your mouth; the hazelnut meringue with strawberries was a great combination of crunchy and creamy. In a nut shell, if you have a special occasion (or just need a really nice date night with your sig other) you should try Cafe Matou.",0.9979,0.766,0.224,0.01,0.5262035771246297

2006-07-14,5.0,"I am very serious when I say this. Hands down, the Best French restaurant I have had in the city for many years! I was taken to a really good French restaurant some time ago by an acquaintance which knocked my socks off. I never forgot the experience, however, I was getting close forgetting since the best I could seem to find anywhere was ""French bistro."" And there menus entailed steak over good french fries in addition to other gamey dishes. This to me was just settling.  Because the reviews for Matou looked similar to the reviews for my 'used to be favorite' place, I almost canceled my reservation  to stick with what I know, since that was good and consistent. I am glad I didn't. After several years of hoping that I would one day find the place that rivaled the original place I was taken to... Matou!!! This is amazing food. The flavors of every dishes ordered at my table were amazing. Great complex flavors and sauces with every dish. Even the escargot and that is usually the about the same anywhere you go. There were some unnecessary comments from a slightly annoying host but thankfully, this did not deter me from getting there and again, once I was there from sitting down.  Some things to note, the web site menu was not completely updated. I went there for the bouillabaisse which no longer on the menu. Second, the actual restaurant menu is not written well, I seriously did not know what to order because everything sounded blah or unexciting. I commented to the wait staff, who were in total agreement. Not to be over technical in my description here, but the food is the ##BOMB##,  Great place for a romantic date, Everyone loved what they ordered. My wife ordered a breaded grouper fish with a spinach and white rice, which I tasted, everything was perfect. My son ordered a linguine with veggies like eggplant, and it may not sound like much. Seriously, you had to be there, also delicious. Because nothing on the menu sounded good, (at least the way the menu explained it), I ordered the Pre-fixe menu which started me with portobello mushroom soup for appetizer, Braised pork loin and potatoes served in a tomato-mushroom sauce for entree. The Dessert was Banana-chocolate bread pudding drizzled with caramel. The pre-fixe was a good value. When my waitress came by and asked ""how is everything,"" I looked up and said, ""this is horrible!"" The waitress looked at my face and everyone else enjoying their dinner responded with a smile as she walked by, ""Well, I would get the chef for you, but he's already gone for the day.""  Again, the menu doesn't do the food justice, so if it sounds half good, just trust and order it, these people know what they are doing.  The menu changes frequently I understand. Last, regarding the pricey-ness that has been mentioned in other reviews, Matou's prices were the same as other French places I have reviewed, but several notches better which to me, makes it worth it. Matou aires on the side of snootiness to it, or of being a bit on the  not-so-relaxed side, but the waiters were all nice.  Highly recommended!",0.9986,0.792,0.188,0.02,0.4561657559198544
