We ordered beignets, skillet cornbread, and fried green tomatoes. I could have done without the tomatoes but it was my first time trying them. The beignets were light and fluffy and the skillet cornbread, well, talk about comfort food! For our meals we ordered two Chicken & Biscuits and one Mushroom Truffle and Egg dish. The chicken & biscuits were the cooked perfectly, the gravy brought it all together. I tried some of the mushroom truffle and egg dish and immediately thought, ""well, I'll have to come back for THAT"".  We all got a couple drinks too, I mean, what would brunch be without a few cocktails?! The Spring Gimlet stood out the most to me. The waiter was extremely nice and very personable.

2015-11-28,1.0,"Went here for brunch based off someone's recommendation and left disappointed and unsatisfied.  As someone who is from the South, the brunch items are way too complicated and lack any real flavor. There's just too much going on. We ordered:  -Mushroom, Truffle, and Eggs (too many distinct flavors thrown together, we took one bite and couldn't finish the rest, just didn't taste good) -Fried Green Tomatoes (entirely too complicated, too much sauce on top that was overly tangy, shrimp in the mix that didn't blend well with the dish, and the fried green tomatoes were too greasy and tomatoes bland).

We nervously brought one of our tried and true southern friends (born and raise in KY, now living in AL) here when she came to visit Chicago this past August, wondering how our southern food would stack up to her grandma's.  Happy to report: she's still friends with us! In fact, she loved the place!  Before we got our food, we determined the litmus test for true southern cooking to be collard greens and fried chicken, knowing that if they failed those, all would be hopeless.  Boy, were we proven wrong.  The fried chicken thigh was AMAZING. As was the collard greens.  As was the shrimp and grits.  As was the skillet cornbread.  As was the buttermilk biscuit.  As was the cheesy grits.  You get my point.   Yelp shows this place as temporarily closed, but when they open again, we recommend you go stake a place out on their patio with a piece of fried chicken thigh and a buttermilk biscuit.",0.9355,0.842,0.12,0.038,0.5516666666666666

Very good so had 2.  Tasted the screwdriver that had a bbq potato chip rim and much better than i thought it would be.  For starters we had the Fried Green Tomatoes and  corn Bread with Foie Gras butter... Not sure what that is.  But after sampling their apple butter, it would have been a much better pairing. The brunch menu featured lots of southern biscuits and gravy style high caloric comfort food fare. The eggs bacon and standard fare was listed as a side..i opted for the raspberry french toast with vanilla bean whip cream and fresh berries.  It was decent ...

It was nice to have the option to sit outside in October, though the homeless guy asking everyone for a dollar was less than ideal. Service wise I give Carriage House 4 stars.

I'd give the food 3.5 stars overall. * Fried Green Tomatoes - 2.5 stars because I've had better. * Mushroom, Truffle & Egg - 5 stars because this was that damn good! Definitely recommend this dish. * Catfish Fry - 1 star because it was too fishy, lacked flavor and the batter on the fish was a no from the first bite.  * Slow Smoked Pork Sandwich - 4 stars because this was delicious (the bite that I had). * Macaroni and Cheese - 5 stars because it was so cheesy that it made my heart beat a little faster. * Country Ham Hush Puppies - 4 stars because you get a good amount of hush puppies and they are good...plain and simple.

Carriage House stood out because of the words southern brunch. I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful open and  airy atmosphere. By this being mid October the weather was beautiful outside so they had outdoor seating available which was an added bonus if I wanted to sit outside. This a great place for small and large parties of about 8-10 guest. Also, Carriage House is good for children. Now, down to the good stuff. The staff was very polite and suggested some popular brunch dishes and also drinks. We ordered the deviled eggs which were an over kill of Dijohn and horseradish sauce. I did enjoy the chicken and biscuits with gravy and a side of bacon to share. As stated in Time Out the bloody mary was weak but the concept of having a baby bottle of beer sound pretty good on the side so I got it for concept only so nothing special about the Bloody Mary.

2015-09-27,2.0,"Carriage House is known for their Southern food-inspired menu. After traveling to Atlanta and having Southern brunch for years, my friends and I decided to have Southern brunch in Chicago.   Beignets: Dense. These are not the fluffy beignets found at Cafe du Monde in NOLA, Toulouse Petit in Seattle, or even the food truck at the Eastern Market in Detroit. The beignets reminded me of the doughnuts at Dahlia Lounge in Seattle. Accompanying espresso sauce was excellent, but I do not recommend the beignets at all. PASS.  Chicken and biscuit: Biscuit and gravy are on point. The boneless fried chicken reminded me of Chick Fil A's chicken sandwich. I think Chick Fil A also does biscuits. I would pass on this as well. Unless it's Sunday and you're craving CFA.  Service and ambience: Excellent service, but this is a loud and lively environment.

Honestly, whatever cajun country gravy concoction they serve is one of the most blissful mixes of spicy, savory, and just plain comforting sauces I've ever had on a biscuit or chicken for that matter. This takes country fried chicken to the extreme, with a buttermilk biscuit that melts in your mouth and coats the triple battered chicken in yet another layer of buttery goodness. The chicken was also perfectly tender and moist on the inside, beneath and wondrously crispy fried shell. My only complaint, and my only reason for the star knock: the beverages aren't fantastic. My beverage actually had a weird taste of old/freezer burnt ice. Not sure if it was the drink or the ice... but it did not taste great.  They could also improve the AC on a 90+ degree day. It was probably a good toasty 78 degrees in there. I guess this is a southern comfort place, but when you're charging a solid price for food and drink with a fancy interior, maybe keep the ambient temperature pleasant too? Overall, delicious dishes.

We weren't seated outside, but on the enclosed patio at a high top. Nice spot to people watch but still benefit from the air conditioning.  We began with drinks, splitting a pitcher of the creative and playful tequila and rose wine drink (name escapes me...) which also featured watermelon juice and a pickled watermelon garnish (yes, you heard that correctly, and you can eat the entire thing!). Very tasty and great presentation with the original garnish! Also, well priced at $39. Better than an overpriced, generic margarita pitcher you wait half an hour for at an overrated place like, say, Big Star?! Enough in the pitcher for all four of us to have a full cocktail and then some!  As for food, no qualms here. The lowcountry boil is an inspired dish that I had never any variation of prior to coming here. Fresh shrimp, clams, sausage, and vegetable comprise the deliciousness. I particularly enjoyed the chaurice sausage, which is a South Carolinian play on pork chorizo, but with slightly different spices. I split that dish, along with the soft-shell crab po'boy with my dad. It too, was excellent. Fresh beast that was bigger than the bun! Generally, the problem with soft shell po'boys is the bread/roll sometimes being larger than the beast itself(ahem, Half Shell in Lakeview) - not the case at Carriage House! Since it was a Wednesday, they had the sandwich, along with any tall boy beer of my choosing, for only $12. Naturally, I avoided the hipsteresque PBR ($3), and got the Half Acre Akari Shogun ($7); great tasting, smooth wheat ale!  Top top off the meal, we were comped dessert since it was my birthday. And I gotta say, it was probably the best ice cream sundae I've had in my life! Start with a huge portion of bourbon ice cream, top with candied pecans, and add a plethora of salted carmel hot fudge! Top it off with ace service = 5 stars! In the words of aging Ahnald, I'll be back!",0.998,0.751,0.226,0.023,0.5007539682539681

It was supremely moist and deliciously served right in the skillet. I wish the Bloody Mary had had more of a robust garnish, but I was too busy enjoying every morsel of the cornbread and foie gras butter to notice. My boyfriend ordered the chicken biscuit and it must have been good because I didn't get a bite--only tasted the last bit of his potatoes that he didn't finish. I ordered the arugula salad and I'm glad I did... It was too hot outside to order something warm and heavy! The salad had some salty salty country ham and shaved slices of cantaloupe which complemented each other perfectly. As a born and bred North Carolinian, I was so happy to see they had cheerwine on the menu so my friends could try it... Until our server informed us they were out. So sad. Next time! It did end up getting pretty hot out on that patio so we were ready to get out asap when we were finished. I would likely come back on a cooler day!",0.995,0.725,0.226,0.049,0.6586681547619048

There aren't enough words to describe how good this ice cream tasted.  It was smooth with a hint of bourbon that really added flavor to the ice cream and it was topped with roasted pecans, caramel and homemade fudge sauce.  This place is fantastic. Service was great.  I didn't give it 5 stars because they need to add a few more items to their menu.",0.9968,0.722,0.278,0.0,0.5963157894736841

The patio area has a lot of tables, and even a nice long rocking bench if you'd like to sit on that and enjoy your meal (though I assume it would be pretty hard to). I had: -Bloody mary: comes w/ a beer back (Miller High Life) for an extra $1. The bloody mary was good, though I've had better at other places. It's not a bad tasting bloody by any means, but I just wish it was a bit spicier and had a bit more garnishments. -Skillet cornbread: loved this. The cornbread was sweet, had a great texture, and the berries on top were great. OH AND THE FOIE GRAS BUTTER - that was crack. I only wish there was more of it! Definitely get this. -Chicken and biscuit: a really great dish. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes, but the dish isn't called ""Chicken and biscuit and potatoes."" The sausage gravy was great.

Our meals were good and tasty but no wow there, sorry. Our sides included the cornbread with blueberries ( very good), grits  ( good) and Mac and cheese ( disappointing, very bland).

Fried Green Tomatoes: the topped pea salad makes them hearty. I'm no expert, so for what it's worth, I enjoyed them.  Shrimp and Grits: I ordered them with heads off.

2015-06-30,3.0,"We recently had brunch at carriage house after living near it for the past 2 1/2 years... We've always known about its existence but the mixed reviews kept us from coming in. Most of the complaints have to do with pricing or service and I can see why... We sat for a very long time waiting for drinks/coffee. When we finally got our coffee they use very tea cups, and only fill it half way. Quickly we needed a refill and sat there waiting. When a bus boy came by we finally asked him if we could get a fill up on our coffees. He said yes, walked away and never came back.... We could see the coffee carafe sitting at the service cart RIGHT next to us... So he walked by the coffee to leave us. We then saw our waitress and asked for a coffee refill... She said yes and then walked away, again walking right past the coffee carafe.... At this point we thought the carafe had to be empty or cold, why else wouldn't they simply fill our cups? We sat for probably 20 minutes in total asking/waiting on coffee (after probably only having two sips from our first pour before it was gone) when finally the waitress came back to give us food and we asked AGAIN for coffee and she picked up the carafe and filled our cups... So the carafe was full of hot coffee and it was an arm's distance away the whole time?  The food was good nothing super memorable (chicken biscuit, shrimp and grits, pulled pork, mushroom and grits, cornbread) the gimlet was the best thing we had, I would definitely return for that and I'm not a big gin drinker.....But the service was frustrating.

The food is always solid but it's the ambiance that has me introducing it to friends and family for a unique dining experience. Unfortunately, the dinner experience yesterday bringing Grandma and Mom was somewhat of a bust. Not in terms of the food, but because of all things, the setting, which I usually adore!  The music was extremely loud for some reason, blaring loud. I'm not sure if it's because they were trying to project it so the people dining in the patio could also hear, but if patio people could hear it, you can imagine what it was like trying to hold a conversation sitting indoors. I did kindly request to our excellent server to lower the volume but there didn't appear to be follow up. Poor Grandma and her hearing aid. As far as the highlight, which was the food, we particularly enjoyed the fried green tomatoes, oyster roast, and catfish fry.

Breakfast menu are very simple and easy read, and organized. I took me less than 5 min to decide what I want to eat. The vanilla bean and whipped cream on the french toast is delicious. Bad: The French Pressed Coffee tasted sour. Prices are a bit high, but not too unreasonable: The Oyster Egg Benedict should be no more than $15. Fried Chicken was over cooked on the outside, the portion for the breast is smaller than I anticipated, yet inside is still tender inside. The gravy is a bit salty. Suggestions: I had to ask for another batch of cofee. I grew up in Vietnam and live in Seattle, *Bucks HQ, I expect my coffee to be bold and have a kick--as alike my vietnamese coffee. I asked the server for a white plate, but none are available for pictures. White plates will bring these food way more appealing to the eyes. The French Toast are so easy and inexpensive to make it should be less than $8, to push more sales as a side. Potatoes can use a little bit of rosemary to enhance the flavor and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and roasted garlic.

Ever.  The menu hits on all kinds of tastes. I'm glad my group likes to share because that's really the way to go if you can. The three of us each wanted to try a different appetizer and we went with it. Fried Green Tomatoes, Beignets and Skillet Cornbread.  These truly are appetizer sized so we each got a nice serving and were able to get a true taste. The FGT had a nice cornmeal crust, with a hot sauce vinaigrette and buttermilk aioli. The beignets were cooked perfectly, light, puffy and just sweet enough without going overboard.  The Skillet cornbread was as we decided ""definitely not Jiffy"".  This is made from scratch--light, buttery but just dense enough to hold on to a schmear of the foie gras butter.  Loved them all! We each got 2 drinks and a main dish.  Because thats the beauty of brunch--day drinking!  Our cocktails were refreshing and smooth and any way you cut it, accompanied our meals perfectly.  I got to taste each of our groups drinks (did I mention how great my friends are?) and everything was good.  My drinks--the French 75 and the Spring Gimlet were just perfection.   My main dish was the Mushroom Truffle and Egg dish.  On a bed of creamy grits we have a soft egg, truffle vinaigrette, chicory, mushrooms shaved Tomme. One word.  DECADENT.  Who knew you could upgrade grits to such a decadent level.   The space is lovely.  Big windows letting in the sunshine, Dark Wood tables contrast the white walls.  I loved the updated farmhouse feel of the place.  Like I said, service was amazing from start to finish.  Sunday brunch perfection.",0.999,0.712,0.282,0.007,0.5455409356725147

I am lucky to have such amazing friends.  As we sat down, Aimee M proclaimed that she wanted to try the Fried Green Tomatoes.  Osiris V was all about the beignets.  So, it was decided that we were going to share all 3!  Great minds think alike.  My favorite was the skillet cornbread with foie gras butter.  I've never had foie before, but maybe I would try it now that I've at least sort of experienced it as butter.  The tomatoes were fried flawlessly and maintained crunchiness.  I insist that you at least try one of these, in addition to an entree, in order to do brunch right at the Carriage House. Brunch isn't complete without a good cocktail.  Carriage House has a simple cocktail menu, and once again, we all ordered something different.  The best cocktails are the French 75 (a gin cocktail with bubbly), and the Spring Gimlet (friends don't let friends say no to elderflower).  I had one of each and lemme tell ya, I was feeling GOOD. Somehow I managed to shovel in the Chicken Biscuit too.  Carriage House is all about simple comfort food - but better.  This dish was smothered in a sausage gravy, and the biscuit didn't get super soggy.  The chicken was crispy crunchy on the outside, and tender on the inside. We could have been shoved into a dark room and fed this food, and I still would have loved Carriage House.  Instead, this restaurant is located at the corner of busy intersection in Wicker Park.  There's a nice patio outside, but it was a little too chilly for us, and the inside is open and airy with a modern farmhouse feel.  It's brunch, Wicker Park style.",0.9954,0.801,0.166,0.033,0.5812865497076024

2015-04-03,3.0,"Arrived a bit after noon on a Sunday. I really like the atmosphere at Carriage House. Similar to its name, it feels very comfortable, rustic, and a dream farm-kitchen. The noise is bearable, but the play music that you would expect at most American-style restaurants. Upon skimming through the menu, I was surprised to see that there are beignets, which I quickly ordered. They are delicious, crispy, with soft, milky dough in the center. It really reminded me of deep-fried, Chinese montou bread with sweetened condensed milk.  If you ever consider making these types of doughnuts, I recall a certain video posted by Chef Gordon Ramsay. Anyways, onto the main course: wild mushrooms and grits with a truffle vinaigrette. This dish has fresh flavors and earthy (of course, its mushrooms). The grits were smooth and buttery; keeping it simple. There was no cajun spiciness or kick to my dish. The flavors were just to be expected. My biggest disappointment was that the mushroom felt a bit soggy and didn't really blend well with the rest of the dish.  Mushrooms are typically very moisture upon hitting the pan, but I guess my critique is more of wishful thinking. My experience here was enjoyable, but given that I love hearty meals for brunches. I was kind of disappointed; Sunday mornings are a pretty rough awakening for a mid-20s person who also happens to be in the middle of Wicker Park. I would recommend the beignets, which were very pleasant compliment to a brunch.  In addition, a few tips for those planning a visit: street parking is free on Sundays, did not notice a valet, SERIOUSLY get a reservation (I still had to wait even though I made a reservation), and order the BEIGNETS.  Lastly, I have to give kudos to the staff who were accommodating and patient with my party; I might give this place another try.",0.994,0.775,0.184,0.042,0.4851540616246498

2015-03-24,4.0,"Thanks to a rez, we waltzed in here on a weekend during prime Wicker Park brunching time and were seated immediately. It took quite some time for a waitress to get to us, which is something that still sticks out about my experience even though I dined there over two weeks ago. Time to catch up on those reviews! What better time to do so than now when I just got my Elite '15 badge! We shared a cornbread appetizer. It was a little small, but probably the best cornbread appetizer I have ever tried! The foie gras butter was very rich and a total treat. I would absolutely order that again. My vegetarian girlfriend agreed (oops, she had foie gras butter).  Having read an article recommending the chicken biscuit, I went for that. I was not disappointed. It was crunchy, crispy, rich, and probably loaded with fat and calories that I don't care to know. I highly recommend you order this. It was a great serving size, too--not too big, not too small. I finished it and felt very content. So, yeah. The only hiccup we had here really was service that wasn't the most attentive. I so expect better for a ""$$$"" restaurant (even if it's more of a ""$$"" for the brunch crowd). I do understand that they were busy, though.  I would definitely come back here to try more items on the menu. For example, I noticed that the couple at the table next to us ordered the beignets covered in powdered sugar and they were very happy with that ordering choice.

2015-03-09,4.0,"We came here for brunch finally on a Saturday after having Carriage House on our to-try list for months. We had made a reservations a few hours earlier that morning, so we didn't have to worry about the Saturday morning brunch rush. We were seated immediately after arriving at a two-person table near the window. I took note of the decor, which wasn't southern in a kitschy sort of way. There were bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as well as a few classy paintings.  Our waitress took a while to come to us. By the time she arrived (honestly, it was probably 10 minutes after we were seated), we were already ready to order. She seemed a little surprised, which led me to believe that maybe she didn't know that we had been seated already. I would have rather waited for a little bit than waiting to be waited on, but everything else about our service at Carriage House was fine.  We were hungry, so we decided to get the cornbread skillet as an appetizer. It was smaller than I expected from pictures I had seen, but it was still REALLY good, complete with a healthy dollop of foie gras butter plopped on top. I don't eat meat, but I admit that I did sample some of this butter because it was touching the cornbread. It was very rich and savory. There were also jam preserves smeared all over. The cornbread was perfectly moist and not dry, the shortcoming of many cornbreads.  For my main course, I decided on the french toast with the fried banana. It was really delicious and pretty rich. I ended up eating a little over half and brought the rest with me to go. I do think the prices are maybe a little bit high for what you get, but I'm not really complaining because I enjoyed our meal. I'm not sure what the food quality and prices are like for dinner because I notice that Yelp has designated Carriage House as a ""$$$"" establishment. We probably won't be back any time soon because there are so many other great places to try in the area, but once we've tried the rest, I'm sure we might be back.",0.9963,0.821,0.167,0.012,0.526540404040404

2015-02-24,4.0,"With a limited but profound menu of southern comfort foods, I think this place stands out a bit. It has a modern but industrial feel on the inside with a drink and food menu that small but mighty.  Pulled pork sandwich, fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, deviled eggs, and ribs, to name a few of the items available. Their cocktails range across bourbon and gin, having a much more boozier taste than some cocktail bars. I ordered the Creole Cocktail, which made me slightly pucker from how strong it was. But it went down smooth with the orange flavor. My mom ordered the gin/lemon/egg white drink (can't remember the name), and it was definitely on the stronger side, but the creaminess of the egg white helped smooth it out.  Being with a group of 4, we opted for the Sunday Supper, which was a whole fried chicken with 3 sides, plus we ordered an app of fried green tomatoes. I wish the server would have told us that the fried green tomato app only came with 2 tomatoes. There was four of us...we definitely would have ordered a second app if we knew this! So even though we all only got half a tomato, it was pretty darn good. I was worried that this was going to be an indication of things to come... It was and wasn't. The plate of fried chicken was huge and definitely enough for four people. Not only that, it was delicious, perfectly crispy, with a slightly spicy, hearty breading. This did not disappoint at all and was exactly what I wanted. The sides, however, were small. When you order the supper for four people, the side of biscuits only comes with 2 biscuits (?), so we had to order two more. The cole slaw we got was honestly enough for 1-2 people, so that was disappointing. The mac and cheese was pretty small too, but I'd say it would normally feed 2-3 people. So the main star of the meal is definitely the chicken, but I think that it would've been nice for the sides to match a bit. You can order the friend chicken supper for $35 for two people or $50 for four people...I think I would've paid an extra $10 for a better helping of sides to match the number of people. I think there are definitely opportunities for the restaurant to upsell a bit, because I can't be the only person who feels this way? I WILL say this...the mac and cheese was probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Seriously. So unbelievably, ridiculously good. It had a rich, sharp flavor and the cheese was melted to a velvety texture. Wow. I will be back for this.  After the drinks, app, supper, and two desserts, the meal came to $130, which isn't bad for four people and a full hearty dinner. The food was great which gave it 4 stars.

You know you're in for a good meal when choosing between the options for all of the courses seems impossible. I started with the cornbread on the recommendation of a friend, and it was phenomenal. It wasn't dense like I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't lacking richness thanks to the additions of a jam and foie gras butter. I also snuck a bite of my friend's friend green tomatoes which were crispy and delicious. For the main course, I had to go for the pork shank. I was not disappointed. For starters, they did not skimp on the shank, and it was perfectly fork-tender and fell off the bone. The mustard greens were the perfect blend of bitter and salty to cut the richness of the pork. My only minor gripe is that the menu didn't specify that the pork shank was served with cornbread ham hock stuffing, because it was a little bit of cornbread overload (if such a thing exists). And for the grand finale, the bourbon ice cream was the obvious choice. The bourbon wasn't as pronounced as I was expecting, but the ice cream and pralines (oh my god, the pralines) paired perfectly with the salty sweet caramel fudge. I also had a bite of my friend's beignets, which were definitely more dense than I was expecting, so my recommendation is to stick with the ice cream.

Hubs had the smoked beef rib - very sweet.  It was strange to me that everything came piled on the plate.  I can see the meat and grits but the brussel sprouts too?   We also had the collard greens.  Don't do it!  They are too vinegary!  I wanted to love them but as the other people said, they were just too much. And lastly, the pecan pie.  Nope.  Didn't finish.  It was not a southern pecan pie.  What is seemed like was a frozen pecan pie.   For drinks we tried the maple bourbon lemonade, yum, the paloma, maybe the most delicious but least alcoholic, and the beekeper, also yum. Overall, it was lovely.  Next time I will know to go at 5 or after; we're early birds, what can I say?",0.9872,0.818,0.133,0.05,0.4642446581196581

Macaroni and Cheese: super tasty - just order it because you will not be disappointed.  Full disclosure: I did find myself wanting a *bit* more crust to the top and perhaps a bit more of a kick, but fantastic nonetheless.

The happy result was her suggesting that we try the Carriage House for brunch; we were looking for someplace new to us and different for brunch.  The menu has a traditional breakdown of sweet and savory.  The slant is a refreshing, innovative southern flair.   We shared our orders: beignets; mushroom, truffles and eggs; and bacon.   I hate to admit this was my first go-round with beignets--they were luscious enough, although I am not now a confirmed beignet fan.  The egg dish was a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. Whoever meshed these ingredients is a genius! When we ordered, we asked about bacon versus sausage.  The bacon was recommended and that's what we had.  Good, good bacon! And our server was beyond hospitable.  We were uncertain on whether to have a Bloody Mary or the House Punch, finally choosing the punch.  She brought a taster of the Bloody Mary when she brought our drinks--a good spice and thick tomato juice--a sure fire order for us next time. The punch was a curveball, a great curveball, different than we were expecting--the citrus and alcohol mixed drink was perfect for our order. I've put this place on the come back soon list, maybe for dinner, to revive my memories of the details of that wonderful dinner.   Oh, and one piece of advice: depending on the timing, the outer area is rich with sun streaming in.  You might want to be aware of that when you choose a seating area.",0.9963,0.714,0.231,0.054,0.6343362193362194

I am not a health-driven eater and I get that the niche here is haute comfort food, but you literally cannot order even toast without spending $3 and getting ultra-rich fat bread with a pile of honey butter. The much-touted beignets are four tiny pastries for a bangin' $8. Except the coffee, there is no release from a glut of butter . . . it would just be nice to have some fresh clean options to help the otherwise delicious food go down. So this is an area of variety I'd like to see on this place's small, fairly high-priced menu of somewhat smaller portions, but all quite up-done rich foods.

2014-09-29,4.0,"Came here for dinner on Saturday night and had a nice time. Three of us ordered a number of small dishes to share. I would recommend this as they seem to be the most appetizing and it's a good way to try everything, just make sure what you're ordering is big enough to share! Here's what we got and what we thought: Arugula salad: this is a really delicious salad and a pretty good size for sharing. Love the ham (seems almost like prosciutto) and peaches and candied walnuts. Crab dip: others at my table LOVED it, I liked it but thought it was a tad fishy - even for crab dip. Still a good shareable starter and comes with good bread (which there should've been a bit more of). Fried chicken: this was really well flavored and just really delicious. However, the portion was small. Probably not shareable and in general just kind of small even for an appetizer. I think Carriage House should at least add an entree sized portion since this is so tasty. Mac n cheese special: sooooo delicious! Enough for all 3 of us to get a side's worth. Shrimp and grits: also wonderfully flavored and delicious. Recommend, and this is coming from someone who isn't a huge grits person. We got an extra shrimp since normally this only comes with 2. Overall thoughts: food is extremely good but a lot of the appetizers seem more like sides, which is a shame because they're the most delicious things on the menu! Even if it means upping prices, I think Carriage House would be better if they turned these into larger plates or expanded their entree selection. Also, we would've loved some corn bread to start with instead of having to order that $7 skillet ;) I would come back for sure!",0.9979,0.709,0.272,0.019,0.6293305728088338

I honestly don't give a fuck how Carriage House thinks a steak should be cooked, when there's a request to prepare it a certain way, it should be executed as such.

The chicken was super greasy (not a lot of chicken) on the bone and all of the other food was so-so. When we got the check, we realized that the waiter over-charged us for a $13 whiskey drink. We didn't say anything but we wrote a note on the bill stating that they overcharged us for drink. We left before he picked up the bill.

2014-08-17,2.0,"So I need to update this review here. My last glowing review of this place is now null and void. I just went with my boyfriend for brunch and it was a brutal experience that ended with me going to the Starbucks across the street for food. He ordered the chicken and waffles, which previously was amazing, and I had eggs and potatoes. Not only did it take over an hour for those to come out, the food tasted like nothing. No salt, no seasoning, nothing. The couple sitting by us happened to order the exact same thing but apparently their food took 45 minutes to come out, and when it came out, it must have tasted just like ours, because they left a tipped and just walked out. The server was apologetic, and took everything but our coffee off the bill, but the food was nasty. He told us they had three new cooks..and that must be why. I don't know--they need to turn this ship around before it sinks. I am giving it two stars and not one solely because my first experience here was amazing...and I hope they can get back to that.",0.6584,0.885,0.078,0.037,0.43974747474747466

One thing that I find really funny is that they bought plants to put in the little tree area in the middle of the outdoor seating, but they never took them out of the planters from the store. So they are just sitting there all ugly and what not. It would literally take like 30 mins to plant these plants. I garden and I secretly want to go there after hours and just do it for them.

I have to update bc a party of 4 of us visited for CH's Sunday supper, a family style Southern meal.  The stars of the night were the mac 'n cheese and coleslaw (whoa, right?).  Something about the freshness and crunchiness of the coleslaw was so alluring, without it being super heavy.  We re-ordered the mac twice, and the third serving was plated in a round ramekin vs. the bigger rectangular dish.  Does that mean we were being cut off?  LOL! The fried chicken and cornbread were solid, and though I ate some, I don't have too much to say about the mashed potatoes and collard greens... except that the greens were more vinegar-y than I'm used to.  On the service front, a lot was to be desired.  It seemed like Peter was in slow to no motion, taking a while to greet us, not checking on how the food was at all, offering hardly any reaction to glass found on the coffee cup that was served with the French press.  He took the coffee and cup away to the kitchen, but we expected him to come back and update us on the fact that the kitchen was getting some more ready or that the drink would be comp'ed.  Said experience with Peter was in drastic contrast to the warm, friendly waitress we had on our last brunch visit (K even went out of his way to compliment her on her great customer service) and the hardworking, extremely efficient bus guy working the outdoor tables last night.",0.9835,0.858,0.124,0.018,0.4159832451499118

Now, the bad news.  The service was bad.  I don't know if I had an isolated experience or if this is something they consistently struggle with, but some of our table didn't get their drinks until 15 minutes after the rest of our party.  The food came out in waves, too.  It got to the point where the niceties of ""go ahead, you don't have to wait"" were accepted as the rest of the food was getting cold.  I'll definitely be back, but hoping to have a better service experience in the future.",0.971,0.756,0.176,0.068,0.5784956709956709

I'm very particular (read that as picky) about fish but thought this place had been given so many great reviews, what could go wrong. Uh, a whole fish with head attached being brought out to me, is what went wrong. I don't think it could have been worse, aside from my friend having ordered the shrimp and grits and having had to de-head the shrimp herself.

2014-07-01,3.0,"Atmosphere: I dig the fusion of rustic country fare meets contemporary urban kinfolk-esque design. It kind of reminds me of a modern take of an old-timey saloon. Although it's a small space, it feels a lot bigger because of the light filtering through the big open windows. The tables can be put together for larger parties. Libations (^_^): The cocktails seem to be fairly good. I tried the John Rabbit, which was not too sweet, but not too dry. I suspect that you won't go wrong with any of their cocktails. They also have beer and wine. Food: The menu has a lot of small plates for tapas style dining, which was good to share. I ordered a few items from the menu. Overall, the food was okay. I grew up eating southern/soul food/creole, so of course Carriage House isn't going to stand a chance against my grandfather's cooking, but here is the run down: Collard Greens: I liked them a lot. They weren't made in a way that was familiar to me as they tasted a little bitter, almost vinegary. I'm used to them being a little more savory,  but I was presently surprised. They actually tasted healthy as Southern collard greens are typically made with pork fat for seasoning. Fried Green Tomatoes: They were not bad. They weren't flavorful. The batter overwhelmed the taste of the tomato. The shrimp added a nice touch. Smoked Chicken wings: They were ""meh."" They did not taste smoked or seasoned well.  Smoked pork chop: The pork chop was tender. It was not memorable. I think it would have faired well with some Louisiana Hot Sauce. Crispy braised pork belly: This was a no go for me. It had an overwhelming fried pork fat taste to it. I like my pork to not taste like pork fat (but that's just me). Overall: Great space, great drinks, mediocre Southern food. However, I think you'll like the food if you're unfamiliar with Southern cuisine or go with the expectation that you're eating a Northern Wicker Park friendly take on Southern food aka Southern Food Lite.",0.996,0.795,0.184,0.021,0.4796296296296297

Normally, I am one to complain about folks North of the Mason-Dixon trying to imitate southern dishes and missing the mark, but not this place. We ordered the beignets and hushpuppies as well as bottomless french pressed coffee (very reasonable at $4 per person) to start. The beignets made me feel right back at New Orlean's Cafe Du Monde.

Its little plates- we got crab dip with Texas toast- that was pretty good, but the collard greens were literally inedible. I'm not a big collard greens eater, but I couldn't choke these down. Super salty and the stench of future methane was heavy upon them.  I had higher hopes for what was listed on the menu as shrimp and pork belly pie. I thought maybe it would be a shepherd's pie type thing, or a quiche-like slice. It was two little empanadas. That really bugs me when the menue description and the real thing are so off like that.  Then there was the tinfoil bit that came with the empanadas. Now, I know that this happens sometimes, but my dinner companion is more sensitive than I am, and was pretty bugged by it. When he brought the tinfoil bit to the attention of the waitress, she replied that she had no idea how it could have gotten there, which means she basically implied that he put it there himself. !

Time and time again when I come to this restaurant, i am floored by the service, food and general ambiance of the place.  1st time: Brunch We had to wait 1.5 hours even though we had reservations. It was not a pleasant experience to be starving and watching a table of three just sit and linger for an hour even though they've finished their food. Simple courtesy, people. But the staff and manager definitely made up for it. They comped our coffee and even brought up some donuts which were delicious. So, well done there, Carriage House. They definitely took care of us. Now on to food. OMG- the Chicken and biscuits are to die for (although a little on the saltier side). So much flavor packed in that dish. It had me dreaming of more. That sauce.... We also had the shrimp and grits and shortrib and grits which were delicious as well. The cornbread wasn't my fav but overall that chicken and biscuit was a dish I loved. Peter, our server was AMAZING! Very attentive and simply a down to earth good guy who really had our interest in mind. Hands down the best brunch place in Chicago 2nd time: Dinner After having brunch, I was set to try their dinner menu. Dinner was definitely just was great. I made reservations for my birthday and once again, Peter was our server and he definitely made me feel like a birthday girl by hooking us up with goodies (free desserts and pork rinds)! For dinner, the set up was small and larger plates so it was more of a family style set up.

The menu seems like you could order many small plates and share.  My friend and I really loved the poached eggs over oyster mushrooms and greens. We slurped down the delicious lowcountry oysters served with bacon, leeks, jam and aioli.  Everything was tasty and amazing until we got to our 3rd course, which was the crispy braised pork belly. I usually always order this dish because I cannot resist any crispy pork products. While the pork belly tasted just ok, the dirty rice that it was served over did not taste good at all.  It had an unpleasant, creamy and yet vinegary taste and we almost had a feeling like it was just a little past its expiration date.  That kind of traumatized us since we got the collard greens next and it was also covered in thick ham slices, but at this point, we were no longer feeling like having any pig products.  The chocolate pudding with banana was good but had just a tab too much salty balance to it. the caramelized bananas were the best part.   Summary:  It was a pleasant dining experience but the dishes were extreme and not consistent throughout. We loved some dishes but could not tolerate others so who knows. I am going to settle in he middle ground and give this place 3 starts.

Not a deal-breaker but unfortunate. The cocktails were good, as was the wine list. We ordered a ton of different things.  The good: Pickles. Oysters. Pork Rinds. Pot roast-- best thing we ordered, by far, and it was definitely the best pot roast I've ever had. Grits. The meh: Rainbow trout- it was just ok. Crab soup-- members of my party enjoyed it, but it didn't wow me.  The bad: Hushpuppies- they came out burnt and tasting of mildew or mold. They were terrible. Corn bread had a similar taste.

The menu is very family style friendly.  I liked how there are both ""Traditional"" and ""Reimagined"" entrees so we were choose a little bit from each side.  We started with the skillet cornbread and fried chicken thigh.  Disappointed it was a singular thigh, we ended up ordering a second one.  The cornbread was just so-so.  I liked the fried green tomatoes and the pork shoulder.  I had given up dessert for Lent, but my friends loved the apple donuts with the caramel dipping sauce.  One practically liked the plate clean.

2014-04-30,5.0,"My (darling, smiling, shapely) girlfriend and I made the gametime decision of dining at one ""The Carriage House"" restaurant, a southern style place with many a shrimp dish.  They had all the fixtures of a place out of our price range: valet, wine, multiple courses, chairs - these are all normally red flags, but fuck it, it's Wednesday, and spring has sprung.   Fortunately, they had 2 dollar schlitz.  Drinking Schlitz out of a fancy-stemmed beer glass is the ultimate.  Your friends/competitors at the neighboring table think you're drinking that top shelf shit, or they're too busy texting to really judge you.   Anyway, I'm getting off track.  In reality, I'm sitting here, reflecting and writing this tear-soaked word document for one reason: Doug.  Without further ado. Dear Doug, the greeter, server, and hopefully President/CEO of Carriage House Inc,   Thank you for being that ray of shining light sent down from the soul-food heavens to watch down upon my girlfriend and I (she will from here on out be referred to as Tyra).  Thank you for not lambasting me for mistakenly referring to your place of employment as ""soul food""; I still don't exactly know how to classify said restaurant. I'm not going to get into the hairy details of how Doug made this night so different from all other nights (Passover reference), mostly because the rest of you don't give a shit, and Doug, if you're out there, somewhere, anywhere: you know that you're the fuggin' man, and that you killed it tonight.  Simply put, Doug, the hero, was more observant, welcoming, and flat out validating than anybody I or you (Yelpers) have ever met.  Even your parents.  Even your soulmate.  Even yourself.  That is to say that in a cumulative 6 minutes of speaking with Doug throughout our meal, our lives were changed forever.  Maybe it was the nostalgic Built to Spill soundtrack in the background, maybe it was the free strawberry rhubarb lemon cream curveball he threw our way, maybe it was my beautiful Tyra sitting just inches away, whatever it was, I repeat, Doug is the man.  He made that kind of impression that makes you want to go out and buy someone lunch, or foster a pitbull, or just be kind.   One thing Doug complimented was how my dinner party of two spent the night speaking to each other, unadulterated, not bothering to pull out their phones.  I was flattered by his observation.  I do realize that, in coming home to write this (and not doing something productive like tending to Tyra, cleaning the bedroom, giving to charity) I'm perpetuating this cycle of technology and distraction, but I truly feel that these grateful reactions need to come out now, while they're hot and ready.   Thank you Doug.  Truly.  Also, the food was delicious.",0.9966,0.773,0.177,0.05,0.5145691609977324

We're too cheap to afford the regular dinners, so we opted to have an entire meal based around a few delicious appetizers. I'm really glad we did. And since then, I can't think of any other way I'd want a meal served. We had: + Blackberry Salad: YUM. So much flavor packed into a large bowl of greens and blackberries, topped with cajun rice crispies. It was devoured quickly. + Picnic Board: A collection of deviled egg, shrimp remoulade, pimento cheese, pickles potato salad, bourbon mustard, and a buttermilk biscuit!, The picnic board also comes with red country ham, but I opted for some extra deviled eggs in place of the ham. It was an easy swap (at the recommendation of our waitress). It took a lot of restraint to keep myself from shoveling the entire platter in my mouth. OK, maybe not the entire board -- mustard isn't my thing. Oh, and the biscuit? Heavenly!! + Fried Chicken Thigh: Just for my husband. He loved it. It looked pretty, that's all I can say about it. If it's warm out, try to sit on the patio. Cozy, yet still exposed to the city sidewalk. Everything was so elegent, yet laid-back. I didn't feel out of place here at all, no matter what I was wearing. My coffee was served at the table, with a French Press. Swoon. Oh, and mason jars? You'll probably drink out of one (no matter how much the waitress may think it's just a 'fad' -- psh!).   We opted out of dessert because we were surpisingly full at the end of our little meal.

Smoked Beef Pot Roast:  This was great, the meat was extremely tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  That real winner with this dish though was the horseradish cream that was pour over the top!  Not too spicy so don't let that scare you away!   The only negative I might have to say was that it looked like there was only one waiter working and he seemed really busy.  The wait time in between seeing him was a little long.  I do not believe that this is the norm for them, they apologized and gave us the cornbread on the house.

As for the $30 entree? It turns out the menu was designed to be ordered family-style. An entree is MORE than enough food for 2 people; we had leftovers.

They put this foie gras butter on top of nice cornbread, and I know what you're thinking...""what kind of idiot wouldn't want foie gras butter?"" But it's true, the richness of the FG and the butter cancel each other out, and it absolutely destroys what might be a very nice cornbread. The quail was decent.

I don't think I would come here to get a little tipsy with my meal so I learned a very valuable lesson. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits with a little hesitation. My mom who is from the south is very particular with her grits and this sort of Bourgeoisie way of thinking was unfortunately passed down to me. I hate ordering grits from restaurants that taste worse than the ones that come in small packages that I can buy at the grocery store. I took a chance and was very happy with my decision. The shrimp and grits was so hearty and perfect. It felt like I was in the south again. Creamy, buttery, cheesy grits topped with 2 juicy whole shrimps topped with hunter gravy. So good. My friends ordered the fried green tomatoes and the garlic bologna sandwich which were just as hearty dishes.

2014-03-13,4.0,"Friends of ours took me and my husband out for a celebratory dinner. I was a little reluctant to visit Carriage House because of some of the negative reviews about lackluster service, how salty the food is, and the sometimes small serving sizes, but I'm happy to report our experience was a very pleasurable one. Because many other reviews touch on these points I won't go into super detail about each dish, but I will tell you which ones I think are worth getting in my opinion. PARKING: We live right around the corner, but expect to now pay up to $11.99 for valet parking in the area if you don't feel comfortable finding your own space on the side streets. ATMOSPHERE: On a cold Wednesday night at 7:15 PM is was crowded, but still very comfortable. Four of us sat at the communal table, alongside four other diners. This is typically not my favorite seating arrangement, but it worked out well because we weren't sitting practically on top of our neighbors. The noise level was a bit loud until our neighbors left, but nothing that took away from the experience. I don't know if I would want to sit at this table if it was only my husband and I, but for a group of four it was all right. SERVICE was outstanding. No complaints here. Our server was friendly and engaging, offering suggestions without any upselling. Our food arrived within a reasonable amount of time and the dishes were paced well. COCKTAILS are priced accordingly for the location. Expect to pay $11.00, but at least the pours are reasonable and the mixed drinks are tasty. FOOD: Every dish seemed like it came topped with some sort of pork, so be prepared for a meat-heavy dinner. The amount of food we ordered was perfect for four of us and we actually could even have done without the second supper of pork shoulder. Nothing tasted super salty to me and I'm real sensitive to that because I don't eat a lot of processed food. I did feel the effects the next day from the sodium in the pork, but that's just me. Fried Green Tomatoes - Not a fan of these. Taste was okay, but the tomatoes were too hard for my taste. Shrimp and Grits - YES! Definitely order this dish. One of our favorites of the night. You only get two shrimp, so double the order for three or four people. You'll be happy you did. Country Fried Sweetbreads - I like sweetbreads and these tasted all right, but I wouldn't get this dish again. It was hard to share three sweetbreads among four people (just give us one more would you!) and I thought the price a bit high. Collard Greens - Expect large leaves and lots of pork. Nice smoky taste. Skillet Cornbread - YES! Another favorite, although I wish it was slightly bigger. If you love cornbread you might want to order a second one for three or four people. Beef Short Rib - YES! Very tender beef and not a lot of fat. Crispy Pork Shoulder - YES! Maybe it lost it's crispiness from sitting, but the taste made up for it. Love the mustard and sauerkraut that accompanies it. Cider Doughnuts - YES! Another group favorite. Light and airy with a crisp exterior. A perfect end to a good meal. Carrot Cake -  My husband loves carrot cake, but even he wasn't a fan of CH's version, which is more like a dense fruit cake. The frosting is good. Give it a try if like that sort of thing. I'm glad we got a chance to try CH and although I can't see my husband and I returning on our own, if someone invited us I would go back just for the shrimp and grits and to try some of the other seafood items. Why four stars instead of five? The price of course, which is a little high for the amount of food, but it is what it is for a restaurant in Wicker Park.

My boyfriend had the short ribs, which I watched him pull apart with a large spoon and gleefully shovel into his mouth. Later he reported they were more fat than meat, but he effectively finished the dish, so take that for what it is. Most importantly, the god damn CHEESY GRITS WITH SOFT BOILED EGG , MUSHROOM AND TRUFFLE OIL. If you eat anything here, let this be it. In fact, ignore everything I just said about all the other food and just order 4 of this. The grits mad a nice little bed for the mushrooms and greens and when you broke the soft boiled egg it made a little extra warm melty gravy, not that you needed it, because truffle oil, duh.

2014-03-03,4.0,"I feel like there are way too many restaurants that I ask myself ""how did I not eat here sooner?!"" after visiting for the first time. I guess with the never-ending, ever-evolving list of great restaurants in Chicago, it's not really surprising. Carriage House in Wicker Park is the latest on my wish-I-visited-sooner restaurants, but and I made up for it by visiting for brunch twice in one month...and it was amazing on both occasions! The name of the game at Carriage House is ""a taste of down south, up north"" and I think they do a wonderful job bringing this mantra to life with both the space and the food. The dining room is filled with natural light (perfect for food photography!) and has a little bit of contemporary mixed in with some good ol' rustic charm. The food is obviously fantastic and I love how they've found a way to put a modern, unexpected twist on some Southern favorites. Their Lowcountry cuisine looks so ridiculously good it'll have you drooling with anticipation as you watch your neighbor's meals come out of the kitchen...and trust me, it tastes every bit as good as it looks! Here's my advice-start with a cup of their French press coffee and an order of the Apple Cider Donuts. I always love a good cup of freshly ground French press coffee and Carriage House's cup was no exception. The apple cider donuts are served warm, a little crispy on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside, smothered in spiced sugar, and served with a lovely mulled wine caramel sauce for dipping. A refined version of coffee & donuts that does not disappoint! Now that you're warmed up it's time for the main event. My absolute favorite dish that was ordered on both visits is the chicken & biscuit.  Perfectly fried chicken,  buttermilk biscuit, and pimiento cheese and sausage gravy, served with a side of the BEST crispy breakfast potatoes you could ever imagine. Don't miss this dish! A few other big winners were the Shrimp with grits, hunter gravy, and tasso; the Fried Green Tomatoes with whipped pimento cheese, spicy hominy, creamed ham, buttermilk vinaigrette, and fried egg; the Mushrooms with grits, truffle vinaigrette soft egg, and grilled chicory; and the Johnnycake with apple preserve and maple syrup. (Mushrooms and johnnycake not pictured because we began to devour it before I remembered to snap a picture!) Big props for their generously portioned side dishes as well; they're perfect for sharing...unless you feel like a plate full of bacon all to yourself! I know I probably haven't made your decision on what to order much easier by listing nearly everything on their brunch menu, but bottom line is that you can't really go wrong. Wait, I take that back. You can go wrong...if you don't try the fried chicken...and the donuts! Just kidding...kind of.  Anyways...make your way to Carriage House ASAP, if you haven't already, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

I reached out to my college friend to grab brunch and since she's a foodie herself, I left the decision of brunch location totally up to her. She chose Carriage House and I could see why.  The place was pretty rustic looking, quaint and several long tables were set up in the middle; I think there were some square tables on the side but I couldn't remember. We were seated on the ends of one of the long tables and ordered the mushroom & grits (highly recommended) and the shrimp one. Unfortunately one of the item on the shrimp & grits was pork I believe, so hubs and I switched our dishes. Even so, I absolutely loved the mushroom dish and would totally come back here again for seconds.",0.993,0.759,0.226,0.015,0.5696491228070176

2014-02-01,4.0,"After Table Fifty Two last week, I figured I had gotten my Southern fix for awhile, but  we had  maeeting right around the area, so we ended up heading to Carriage House for a bite.  Chef Mark Steuer brings his Southern roots from South Carolina, and it shows - the interior feels right out of Charleston and the menu fits right in as well.  While on the surface it seems like a take on traditional Southern, there's a ton here that seems new and interesting. The restaurant week menu is a perfect fit for a couple - two choices for apps, entrees, and dessert, and it turned out to be way more than enough food and a reasonable deal for $44 a person.  I started off with a glass of CH's house blend bourbon from Four Roses - a great sweet taste, smooth pull, and a spiced, smoky finish.  Almost worth a visit to the restaurant alone for this bourbon. The meals starts off with a pickled acorn squash salad - very thinly shaved flavorful acorn squash, lightly pickled, giving it a bit of a bite, and mixed with some fairly chunky roasted pears that created a nice sweet contrast in both taste and texture.  The kicker on the dish so were the toasted squash seeds, which added a nice pop of flavor.  A perfect seasonal dish to start the meal.   The fried green tomato came next, which was served with a layer of pimento cheese, drizzled with a buttermilk viniagrette.  Ultimately, neither of the accompaniments added a whole lot of flavor, nor did the dish need it.  The fried green tomatoes had a perfect thin batter and a nice crisp and a bit of zest.  Call the pimento cheese and the spicy hominy a bonus, but the fried green tomato really stole the show here. As bad of a decision as it is, we decided to add a la carte to the restaurant week menu, ordering the fried chicken thighs (if you haven't noticed, it is extremely difficult for us to turn down fried chicken). The portion size was small but perfect for what we wanted. The chicken had a crispy, well-fried batter, drizzled with a touch of honey.  The meat itself was tender, and had a hint of brine to it that emparted a great flavor on the chicken.  Served with a house blend sweet potato hot sauce, this dish is definitely one of the standouts of the menu, and probably will alone drag us back for another visit (fried chicken and bourbon anyone?) The flounder, pan fried and served with braised celery, pickled green tomatoes, in a green turnip sauce with a light rosemary flavor, was solidly cooked.  The fish had a great natural texture, I wan't crazy about the supporting cast - a smorgasbord of green tomatoes, braised celery, soft croutons, and sprinkled with some flavorful herbs.  While the fish was great, it's surroundings may have been the only weak point of a meal that was outstandingly flavorful and authentic.    The crispy pork shoulder added to the richness.  Served with a lima bean ragout, ham hock, and mustard greens, the shoulder dish was well cooked with a full savoriness that was almost too much at that point in the meal.  We were filling up at this point, and wanted to save room for dessert, so we conceded defeat (defeat meaning we stopped before dessert).  As rich as it was though, the leftover pork shoulder made a perfect accompaniment to a small salad of field greens the next night. It is definitely worth mentioning the cornbread - served in a cast iron skillet, the bread itself had a perfect buttery texture, that probably didn't even need the creamy foie gras butter it was served with.  The apple jam added a bit of sweetness, as the cornbread itself was pretty slim on the sugar (not necessarily a bad thing).   One of the best cornbreads I've had in the city - although the custard cornbread at Rub's up north is equally interesting).    One of the double-edge swords of restaurant week is that two desserts are coming, whether you like it or not.   Even though the desserts here were reasonably sized, it was a few bites and done.  The apple cider donuts had a faint apple taste and were slathered in sugar.  The doughnuts themselves were a bit firm and overdone - the caramel sauce served aside were pretty standard.  The carrot cake, like the doughnuts were solid, but nothing special.   It was great to finally make it to Carriage House - definitely more casual in the ambience than somewhere like Table 52, and certain aspects of the the food veer off a bit from the straight traditional Southern food, but in a good way.  The fried chicken, cornbread, and fried green tomatoes were all perfectly cooked and worth a return visit by themselves, and any place that has their own house barreled bourbon is A-ok in my book.   The desserts were a bit meh, but maybe an off night and will check something else out from the dessert menu on our next visit.   Pics up on my blog, a bit dark -  eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.9995,0.762,0.201,0.037,0.5652152477152477

Went with a group of 4 during restaurant week, but we decided to order off of the regular menu for more variety. Every dish was delicious and beyond our expectations. The crab soup was poured table side, the skillet cornbread arrived with a fluffy mound of a savory jam and buttery goodness, the fried green tomatoes were to die for--very balanced and hearty, the truffle mushroom dish was rich and earthy and came on top of a bed of creamy grits and a fried egg, the beef short ribs were melt in your mouth amazing--served with grits and Brussels sprouts, the low country boil was knock your socks off tasty with rabbit sausage, corn cobs for days, and Texas toast to sop up all the amazing broth and clam juice--oh, and the extra side of grits was icing on the cake. The Apple cider donuts (4) came with a warm sweet dipping sauce, and I could've eaten about 50 of them. We did have to wait for a good 30 mins past our reservation, but we found space at the bar to hang out, and after our 2 hour dinner of courses we could see why things were backed up slightly.

First things first, this is a fantastic place for sharing.  You can do a nice date here, but two appetizers, a side, a supper, and a dessert could feed 3-4 people without much fuss, depending on your group. While the rest of this review is going to be about the food, I'm going to take a moment to say how much I like their drink list.  All of our cocktails were well-made and delicious.  The wine list was surprisingly good and actually was organized in a way that was easy to understand, too.  I had zero complaints about service, too. As for the food, it was phenomenal.  We started out with the mushrooms, truffle, and egg dish and cornbread.  The mushroom dish was really interesting.  Every bite was just different enough from the last that I kept wanting more.  Someone below described the cornbread as being cake-like, which is spot-on.  It was fluffy, moist, and not gritty.  Next was the fried chicken thigh.  In addition to being crispy and moist, the honey and hot sauce added a lot to the dish. For the entree, we split the short rib supper.  I'm going to go on a brief tangent here, because one of my goals in going out to restaurants has been to find a great short rib dish.  Most of the time, it ends in utter failure because the short rib either is overcooked, chewy, or dried out.  However, I think I finally found my white whale.  The short rib was perfectly tender and moist, plus it was a large portion.  The sides, especially the bleu cheese grits, complemented it perfectly.  I cannot say enough good things about this dish.  I felt bad about us not being able to finish it, despite our best efforts. We split the doughnuts for dessert.  I remember them being nicely crispy with a good sauce, but, honestly, at that point I might as well have been comatose. So...yeah.  We're going back.  Next time, we're bringing backup.",0.9964,0.78,0.188,0.032,0.5282380952380954

It was delicious by the way. Fresh, crispy, and zesty all at the same time. We got coffee and mimosas. I think the mimosas had bourbon in it, which was very welcomed. And I'm usually not a coffee drinker, but their french-pressed coffee is delicious!! For entrees we got grits, and I think we all got chicken and waffles. The grits are PHENOM. Super cheesy and creamy, with meaty mushrooms and creamy yolked egg. And kale to make it healthy. The chicken and waffles were perfect. Best I've ever had. The syrup was sweet and a little spicy and a lot heavenly. I took my boyfriend here for brunch for his birthday. Again, very friendly service. This time we tried the fresh OJ - which I highly recommend. We got the grits again (I was craving them since last time), and I got pork shoulder over home fries topped with a sunny side up egg. The pork was AMAZING; crispy, salty, but tender. The home fries were perfectly seasoned and super crispy with skin on, and the egg yolk broken over everything just brought it all together.

I love the dark southern modern Victorian décor. The host was a gentleman with a sense of humor (I still had on my Packer jersey for the game that day). Our waiter was helpful. However, while we thought we had made it clear my boyfriend does not eat meat, he failed to inform us of a dish (described later) that it came with meat but the ingredient was not mentioned on the menu. Before you order ask your wait staff of all ingredients if you have an intolerance to anything! The menu is designed to be mostly small plates for sharing and recommended two to three. Three was more than enough for two of us.  First dish, the Fried Green Tomatoes. We were hesitant to order because a large part of the dish consists of the creamed ham. The chief nearest our table ensured  us it would still be good without the ham, and it was! You get two tomatoes fried there on the spot, layered with pimento cheese and ham. Great texture and creaminess with some spice.  Next came the Mushroom, Truffle and Egg. Very yummy! As with many of the plates, the ratio of grits to other ingredients was overpowering. I enjoyed the light flavors on top of the grits. The truffle oil was a bit lost though.  Last, we had the classic Shrimp and Grits. Again, this dish comes with more grits than you can handle with two large shrimp sprinkled on top with ham. As I mentioned above, the menu does not mention ham so we thought this was  a safe option for my boyfriend. Our waiter must not have picked-up on our questions regarding meatless dishes and forgot to inform us. Nonetheless, it was tasty to and up to me to finish the entire thing. I almost made it.

I previously lived in the South for several years, so I know what Southern cuisine is supposed to be and everything hit the mark - extraordinarily well. The fried green tomatoes were fantastic with a great pimento cheese spread garnish and the beef short rib was phenomenal (with some of the best, creamiest blue cheese grits I've ever had).  I have to make a special note of the fried chicken thigh which was stunning. With something so ubiquitous, I think it makes it tough to stand out, but this was hands down the best fried chicken I've ever had.

GOOD CHOICE on our part!   Bologna Sandwich - In between the fluffiest butteriest brioche bun, I found all my favorites: pimiento cheese, butter pickles, mustad aoli, and a fried egg.  It was the most satisfying savory combination.I didn't want it to stop. But no worries, the MUSHROOMS were up next.  I thought the grits had a well balanced chewy texture, which brought out the tastes of the truffle vinaigrette and chicory.  But like the bologna sandwich, it was that fried egg that just made the dish.  Ooey gooey deliciousness.

Onto the food... All the food is meant to be shared and served family style, so remember that when ordering.  For 3 people, they recommended we order 3-4 small plates and a supper.  We had the fried green tomatoes, mushrooms, truffle and egg, pickled acorn squash salad, and cornbread to start.  The fried green tomatoes were tasty, but drowning in sauce, which was slightly overwhelming.  The mushroom, truffle, and egg was my favorite, served over well-seasoned grits.  The cornbread was an excellent side dish with the homemade, sweet butter. For our supper, we chose the lowcountry boil, as it provided a hearty selection of seafood for my vegetarian friend.  The spice palate was delicious and there was plenty to eat between the three of us.  It included clams, mussels, sausage, shrimp, corn, potatoes, and more.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend looking for something different!  I love southern cooking, so I enjoyed this find!  Thank you to #ChicagoFoodAuthority for sending me via Instagram.",0.9969,0.735,0.265,0.0,0.674025974025974

2013-10-27,2.0,"Lots of money for what you get and to much salt and smoke. We where excited to try Carriage House but thing got off to a rough start when I called the restaurant to tell them we would be 5 minutes late for our 6:30 reservation and the host responded that we only have the table until 8:15. Not usually the way you want to be greeted when you called to be courteous and are told you have to leave before you even arrive. Well we did arrive at 6:35 ( a relatively small infraction) and were sat at our table only to wait 15 minutes for our waiter come and take our drink order. Would these 15 minutes be credited to our 8:15 ejection time? Service after that was a little slow but not horrible. We did stay past 8:15 and did not get ejected, but were still shocked at the lack of professionalism with this comment.  The menu is designed to offer shared plates with small and large plate options. The small plates are 6-17 dollars but the average price is really 12-16 and the large plates of which there are only 4 are priced in the 26-34 range with a special that day of a 16 oz steak for just shy of 50 bucks ( lets all laugh together haha). We felt the prices were high for what you get and spent 250 dollars for 4 people and walked away hungry and solber. That 250 included  6 drinks 2 large plates  4 small plates and 2 sides ( sides are about 7 bucks each). The small plates will only give each person in a party of 4 one smaller taste and the large plates are bigger but not anywhere near abbondanza large. Drinks- pain killer was painfully small and watered down. We have had a pain killers at the place where it was conceived and CH version was a serious let down. Creole cocktail was tasty and I enjoyed it but once again small.  Small Plates- The fried green tomato with pimento spread was crispy but lacked flavor. Oyster roast was tasty fresh oysters nice toppings this dish and the chicken thigh where my favorites. The chicken thigh was really a leg and thigh ( for $9 they should mention that) served boneless , first sous vide (cooked in a sealed bag in a water bath at a low constant temp) them smoked then fried. There was a lot to preparing this item and as good as it was compared  to the rest of the dishes we had that night I have had better fried chicken. The smoke they mentioned was not there at all ( which in retrospect was surprising as everything else that said smoke on the menu we had was way to smokey). Also had the ham hock which was more just a tasting of salt and smoke. Large Plates- pork shoulder  was very bland except for the smoke and overly salted taste. After cutting the pork up there was a lot of un-rendered fat that we had to push aside as it was not that yummy and delicious fat you like that melts in your mouth. The beans that where served with this dish seemed over cooked but at least added some flavor and masked the smoke and salt. We also had the short rib it was the better of the two large dishes we had. The meat was tasty not like it was cooked in a forest fire like the pork, but it was so dark where we sat we could not tell the difference between the meat and the accompaniment.  Sides- cornbread, my mom has baked better out of a jiffy box, sounds harsh but my mom made good cornbread and CH cornbread was flavorless but it looked cute served in a cast iron skillet. Sweet potato au gratin, this dish was odd and a shock when we bit in to it. The cheese they  prepared the dish with was blue cheese you would think they would mention the blue cheese, but no. In addition to being a bad combination it was overly salty and with such a strange departure from the classic they should mention the blue cheese in the description.  I love salt and I love smoke but CH used to much and the smoke flavor was almost a chemical one. I may seem harsh in my review but dishes that typically have flavor where very bland and for the price it was a real let down. The atmosphere was cute and warm it seemed like they where going for a hip feel with communal tables. We sat on the porch at a table next to the window the one with 2 bullet holes above us which added some excitement to the evening that we could get popped at any time.

2013-10-22,2.0,"I wanted to like this restaurant so badly. Sadly, I was beyond disappointed. While the service and drinks were great, the food just missed the mark. The shrimp was not fresh. In fact, it was almost inedible. The ""fishy"" taste of bad shrimp was too much for multiple members of our party (and we aren't picky eaters.) If your menu is heavily seafood, a good restaurant should be getting fresh, good shrimp. Or at least edible shrimp!  The other items on the menu had so much potential, but were executed without any finesse. The bleu cheese in the grits overpowered the taste of the ribs, which would have otherwise been wonderful. Instead, you got a mouthful of mediocre bleu cheese. I couldn't have more than a bite or two. The cornbread ($8 for a tiny serving!) was both sweet and chalky. The red velvet cake was so dry that it crumbled, even after being doused in cream.  I would have given this place three stars if it weren't for the prices: A $300 bill for a medium-small party. I would pay that for great food, but our meal was just so poorly executed.",0.9577,0.79,0.138,0.072,0.5844202898550724

The truffle mushroom grits were very good and made me happy to finally find a place that has some idea of how to make grits properly in Chicago.    The only thing I tried that didn't do much for me was the cornbread, which was bland and mediocre overall.

We were eventually seated in their indoor patio area which was absolutely adorable. We studied the menu and practically wanted to order everything. We ended up ordering shrimp&grits, corn bread, collard greens, mushroom truffle&egg, fried green tomatoes, scallops and the crispy pork shoulder. I'd say my fave was the scallops, which was caramelized and cooked perfectly, and the hushpuppies it came with were flavorful and crispy outside, soft inside. The corn bread was a tad sweet, but pairs well with the collard greens. While I liked the grits, I thought both the shrimp & mushroom overpowered it. The pork shoulder was a letdown: it was dry and not fork-tender at all, and at $27 a piece, was way overpriced. So it seems like the food (at least the appetizers) wasn't too bad, why the 1 star review you ask? Let me explain. When the shrimp&grits came to the table, the waitress said: oh I put in two extra shrimps so each of you can have one. Which seemed very considerate...until we saw the extra $10 added to our bill for the two extra shrimps she ""very thoughtfully"" added. If you're going to charge us extra for something, ask us first rather than passing it off as a gesture of hospitality and then hitting us with the bill! I can't imagine any diner would be happy in this situation. She took it off when we complained, but the fact something like this was even allowed to happen was rather mind-boggling.

I don't eat meat, only seafood, and he eats meat and doesn't like a lot of seafood, so it makes for complicated ordering at small plates places.  We decided to order a few and then see how hungry we were later.  We ordered the cornbread, fried green tomatoes, pork boudin balls, and the mushrooms, truffle and egg.  I thought for sure I'd be hungry still, but deciding on an entree was going to be hard. I had a small bite of cornbread, and it was pretty great.  It comes with honey butter on top, which always adds so much flavor.  The fried green tomatoes were outstanding the creamed sweet corn and pickled shrimp really make the dish.  I didn't try the pork boudin balls, but he said they were good.  The highlight of were the mushrooms, truffle and egg.  I had been to Carriage House once before for brunch, and I'm pretty sure this is the same dish I had on that visit.  The grits are outstanding, and all of the flavors of this dish pair so well together.  Seriously, don't skip out on this.  After all of that, we were pretty full and didn't end up ordering an entree.

Service was really friendly and also, our server was not overly annoyed when we were really slow about looking at the menu and ordering.

Anyway. It was all delicious!

I had a case of the ""I had too much fun yesterdays,"" so I was looking forward to a place that could feed me greasy food and bloody marys. My woes were absolved.  Carriage house did not in fact fill me up with greasy, nasty food that I would regret later but delicious, rich, and filling comfort food. My sister and bro-in-law both ordered the biscuits and gravy (b&g), while I ordered the mushroom grits with kale. I also ordered a bloody mary. The grits were buttery and the mushrooms were meaty. It looked like a small serving but I could barely finish it. I tasted the b&g and those were amazing but definitely a happy belly bomb (I think that is what most people expect when they are ordering b&g's). More importantly though, the b&gs did not have the consistency of paste! I find that this can be a common denominator of b&gs. I vote yes on the food AND yes on our excellent service!  So, I am giving this place three stars-because of the the wait. The restaurant was definitely far from full and I think we waited like ten minutes or something. I know ten minutes is not very much but the host sort of just disappeared after quickly telling me there was a wait and leaving my sister and I standing there. I began awkwardly swinging the front  door back and forth leaning out of it... Anyways, an easy fix for this would to create a waiting section.  Frankly, I would love to come back to this restaurant if I were in the Wicker Park area. They have an open kitchen-which I love because I feel like they are always cleaner.

All of the dishes were on the small-medium side, which really made it perfect for the two of us, since neither of us is really big on typical American-sized fare. However, that's a fair warning to those who ARE used to the single entree feeding a small country. I really liked the chicken - it was moist and very tender and definitely not greasy or oily. The skillet cornbread came with this wonderful mousse (not exactly sure what it was) and apricot jam, which was a good balance to the saltier dishes we ordered. The collard greens were ... ok, not the best but by no means the worst collard greens I've had. They were a bit spicy while simultaneously being pickled, which was a little odd to me, but it wasn't unbearable. And there were nice juicy chunks of pork belly in there, which was a pleasant bonus!

2013-08-06,4.0,"Went here for brunch yesterday morning. Food was great but the service was a little missing, hence the 4 stars. Food: I ordered the shrimp and grits, and my date got the mushroom and grits. Both were yummy grits but very different flavor and texture. Shrimp and grits: Two big shrimps, heads left on.On a pile of soft grits, with pork belly/bacon bits and a soup of sauce. I thought the sauce was too much for the amount of grits, but it had a lot of flavor. Bacon was good but not necessary in adding flavor to the meal. If anything I would have preferred some additional vegetables to give a more crunchy texture to the entire mushy grits. Mushroom and grits: A bed of cheesy/truffle oiled grits covered with greens and wild mushrooms. The mushrooms and greens were delicious, the grits were really cheesy but the flavor is much different than the shrimp grits. It is less soupy, almost no moisture, almost a bit too dry. Truffle oil gives it a nice aroma. Bowl of Fruit: Meh. They didnt' take the stems off the strawberries, blueberries some of them were smushed, and the grapes didn't seem like they were washed/still had some white stuff on it.  Coffee: They serve in a french press. Grinds got into the cup, and the beans had no acidity or deep flavor to it. Just a very watery type. not recommended for the uber coffee lover. Atmosphere: We sat in the atrium area, which is not outside on the street, but not inside the restaurant either. They have an outdoor seating area that is covered roof. Its a nice place with breeze, but we had flies come by many times, which can get annoying while eating. There are tons of people there for breakfast/brunch so it was a fun place to go in that regard. Service: It was very slow. Be prepared to spend 15 minutes to order, 15 minutes to get the check, and another 10 to get the check picked up. They are very busy and seem to lack the number of servers. Also what knocked a star was that we sat down and immediately ordered a bowl of fruit ""to start it off"". Took 15 minutes to decide what to get for our main dish. Later we got both main dishes and fruit at the same time. I hate that when the appetizer comes at the same time, even when you put the appetizer in way early.",0.9599,0.859,0.087,0.054,0.4417690058479533

Atmosphere: very casual feel with high ceilings, eclectic artwork, big open windows to the street, some communal tables and some smaller. Busy, bustling place but not so loud we couldn't talk. Chairs are incredibly uncomfortable. The whole rest of the week in Chicago we were commenting how much more comfortable wherever we were was compared to carriage house. Service: quick, friendly without being pushy. Menu is explained quickly, emphasizing that the food is served ""family style"" and that we should order a certain number of this and that. Family style does not mean big at all, however, I guess it just means you are meant to share. Courses are brought out according to their order and they want you to order everything at once. Food: excellent. Probably best meal we had that week in Chicago.  It was not heavy but it was very flavorful. Fried chicken is served with a great, spicy hot sauce. Shrimp was served on grits with a mushroom hunters gravy and was also really flavorful.

However, they do get bonus points for the delicious sweet potato hot sauce though-I asked if I could buy it! The blackberry salad I could have done without.

The baby back ribs were sweet and tender and sweet..  They were everything you want in a rib.  Tender, and sweet with a sticky glaze.  Our table almost got into a literal all out no holds barred fork and knife brawl over the last one. I consider myself pretty much an aficionado on fried chicken and this piece was pretty damn tasty.  It plays with your desires for sweet and salty by combining a little bit of honey with the chicken.  I also was tempted to steal the bottle of sweet potato hot sauce which was offered with it. I'd have to say the waiter wasn't exactly the best since there was a little bit of ordering mistake that could have been avoided.  We ordered the lamb chops and also a side of the grits.  Grits came with the lamb chops.  If we would have known this we wouldn't have ordered the additional grits (though I can't really complain about having additional really creamy grits).  Those pickled fava beans were excellent and provided a little bit of acid to cut through the heaviness that you get with the lamb chops and grits. The star of the show was the cornbread.  The skillet cornbread had a foie gras butter and a rhubarb compote.  You had this rich cornbread that went perfectly with the rich foie gras butter.  The slightly tart rhubarb was a  good compliment.  I'm still having dreams about this cornbread.",0.9967,0.724,0.209,0.066,0.6002421652421653

I decided to check out the Carriage House in hopes that it would be just as good, but it was not.

Now, I understand that some restaurants charge to do this because they want you to buy their dessert, but they wanted $3 PER PERSON to cut the cake. I think that is a bit ridiculous. We opted to not have them cut the cake. The waiter then brings out the cake so we can sing happy birthday and promptly takes it away and wraps it back up. No charge for that.

Now normally I make bomb fried chicken, but I happened to run out of seasoned salt and other spices when making these. Once again NOTHING was stopping me from my C&W. So I ended up with bland chicken and eggo waffles. The chicken and waffles from Carriage House tasted eerily similar to my bland chicken and eggos. The chicken was skimpy and flavorless. The waffle was malted but had no flavor profile. And the sauce served packed little punch. Some idiot at the table ordered the smoked grouper. We were all disappointed to see it come out as a salad.

The last few dinners here I've had have been excellent. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. This place continues to be amazing. Now I just wish some of the lunch sandwiches were available at dinner. I will be craving them from now on.,0.9686,0.817,0.163,0.02,0.5572916666666667
2013-06-14,4.0,"I have been wanting to go to Carriage House for quite some time now - so glad I finally made it. I was nervous about the parking and congestion in the area - I made a 6p reservation and avoided the mess and found a spot on a side street.  The food was amazing. My favorite was the Pimento Cheese which is part of the Picnic Board. I only wished that you could order it as a side...there was not enough! There were three of us - The Picnic Board is definitely only made to split between two people. We were cutting deviled eggs in half to share them - kind of awkward.  Other items we ate that were delicious: Charleston She Crab Soup, Fried Chicken Thigh, Collard Greens, Cucumber Salad, and the Quail.  'Just ok' items we ate were: Fried Pickles, Cornbread with the jam and butter on it (plain was amazing!), Grilled Asparagus, Chicken Liver Mousse, Shaved Country Ham and the Shrimp Remoulade. I hope you like shrimp! About 75% of the dishes we ate had shrimp on the plate. For no reason. So strange, and 'just ok'.  Service was great - we sat outside on the patio and she was very attentive and sweet. She helped us with the menu and was quick to fill our waters and drinks up. Everyone there was very nice, from reception to bussers.  The venue is super chic. I loved it. Cozy - yet we almost got stuck at a communal table with no seat backs (thank goodness it was warm enough outside) because people called ahead to reserve the tables in the dining room with seat backs.  Okay...I made my reservation 3 weeks ago - noted for next time!  Bathrooms were very clean and nice and cozy warm. The bar was hopping and it looked like the mixologists were having a good time. The kitchen is open and visual - love when restaurants do that now - all the guys were smiling while cooking - always great to see!  Overall, it was a great experience and I will be going back - I just hope they let me order a big bowl of the Pimento Cheese as my main dish! : )",0.9965,0.736,0.207,0.057,0.6210981535471333

We also got the fried green tomatoes which were very good, but the shrimp on them was even better.  The cocktails and desserts are also awesome, particularly the peach sundae.  Service was great.

2013-05-31,3.0,"I'm not sure what to think about Carriage House. After reading all the good reviews, I was looking forward to my meal but I was not particularly impressed. The service was quick and very good, particularly for a Friday night. Other reviewers have described the restaurant as being very noisy, but I found the noise level to be normal. We ordered the picnic board (deviled eggs, potato salad, ham, corn bread, shrimp, liver mousse, and cheese), fried chicken thighs, she crab soup, and the pork shoulder entree.  The soup portion was very small, and the soup itself tasted only ok. It was rich, but not particularly flavorful. I was expecting something like a lobster bisque but with crab, but this was not it. The picnic board was delicious, but the portions of each item were ridiculously small.  With two of us sharing, we each barely got a taste of some of the items, like the ham and the potato salad. We're used to large charcuterie boards, so these tiny portions really took us by surprise.  The chicken thighs were good, and the portion was actually decent, but this was not the best fried chicken I'd ever had, by any means. I did enjoy the sweet potato hot sauce that accompanied the chicken.  The pork shoulder was the best dish we had. The pork was accompanied by polenta, and I wish there was more of it. Overall, I felt that the portions were very small compared to essentially every ""family style"" restaurant I'd ever been to in Chicago; there was seemingly no discount in price in light of these small portions, however.   Given the very small portions and that we struck out with respect to a majority of the dishes, I don't think we'll be back.",0.982,0.774,0.152,0.074,0.558097273097273

2013-05-22,3.0,"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. The space is charming and rustic but there's nothing to absorb sound so it gets defeaning, which I found very disagreeable for a place that's clearly going for a family-style culture of cuisine. I think that's an oversight in the design. As for the food, as usual, the small plates were better than the large sharing platters, but everything was good.  The cornbread in particular is awesome: served with foie gras mousse and tomato jam, I believe. A small portion, for two people. Shrimp and grits are delish, good to see that the place does tasty grits. The low country oyster roast was probably the most delicious oyster I've ever had.  The large platters seemed a little off in their conception but the execution was good. We had the carolina grouper and low country boil. They say platters are for 3 people but we found them small, maybe for 2 or 2.5 in the case of the boil. The grouper was fine but not memorable and not a huge portion. The boil seemed to be lacking something -- there were many delicious elements to it but nothing bonding them together, like a bunch of cool strangers isolating themselves at a dance. They serve it with Texas toast but that didn't quite do the trick for me.  The cocktails are also pretty good.

You can call in your reservation. SERVICE The waitress we had was completely nice and helpful when we were choosing our entree. We ordered coffee and so we got a french press at our table that she constantly filled when it ran out. FOOD We ordered the following: 1.  Biscuit and gravy 2.  Pork shoulder hash 3.  Side of sausage and bacon The biscuit dish had biscuits with pickles, covered with the sausage gravy. The pork shoulder dish had hash, pickled peppers, smoked béarnaise, topped with a fried egg.  The pork shoulder was very tender and juicy.  At first, the gravy/sauce that supplemented both dishes tasted very good. After a while, however, the rich nature of it overtook both dishes.    Both were decent dishes, but I am not sure if I'd try them again. Carriage house is a decent place to have brunch.

As to service, the restaurant is bus and bustling, and I think they just do not have enough servers on staff.  I could generally find my server on both visits, but she seemd to simply have too many tables to contend with.  Everyone in charge of delivering food and refilling water was great, but a barely saw my server.  As an example, on both visits, I sat at my table for at least 15 minutes before a server came over to say hi and ask about drinks.  I don't think I'm a difficult person, but that is just not an acceptable wait for anyone to acknowledge you.  Also on both visits, our drinks were empty by the time we finished the first or second of 3 or 4 small plates, and nobody ever offered us another drink.  Aside from being annoying because we wanted another drink, this is just plain bad business - if you ask us  if we want another when our drinks are approaching empty, we are extremely likely to say yes, and we will probably run up another $30-50 (or worse) on our bill by the end of the meal.

The lowcountry thing made eating seafood unavoidable, so I embraced it. I ate errything, and I left very uncomfortably full - the hallmark of a good meal. If I were wearing pants, I would've inconspicuously unbuttoned them. Charleston she crab soup, fried chicken thigh, shrimp and grits, lowcountry oyster roast, carolina gold rice balls, quail, skillet cornbread, crispy braised pork shoulder, lowcountry boil, pecan sundae, and beignets, all made it into my belly. Take note that the fried chicken thigh is singular - one thigh! As I mentioned, I don't normally eat seafood...ever, but I ate crab, shrimp, oysters, and clams in one meal and managed not to feel gross. I actually enjoyed it? I think I'm making progress. The broth of the she crab soup was really nice, and the black pepper dumpling inside the quail was nom. Pork shoulder and the lowcountry boil under the ""supper"" category were for sure the largest and most delicious plates. It was one of those meals where you start feeling full, but you don't want to stop eating - really on point. I didn't need dessert, but it was put in front of me and I was in the middle of an eating rampage. The shortbread in the pecan sundae for some reason confused me, but I couldn't stop eating it.

2013-04-06,5.0,"A friend of mine recommended this place and my date and I had dinner there tonight.  The place was superb, overall.  The food was amazing: we started off with the oyster roast (I normally don't care for oysters, but found these delicious), the boneless chicken thigh (I'm not normally a fan of dark meat but this was wonderfully light and crispy) and the skillet corn bread (you could have the corn bread as a dessert dish and not miss a beat it was so perfectly sweet).  We also had, courtesy of one of the chefs, their daily special, asparagus spears in a crab etouffe sauce.  Everything was incredible and, because we sat at one of the spots by the kitchen, we were able to chat with a few of the chefs.  You can tell that they take genuine pride in their art and that they're very knowledgeable about their craft.   The service was impeccable (the waiter appeared seemingly magically only when we needed him and refilled my Diet Pepsi without my even noticing he was there--THAT is the way to serve).  I wish I could remember his name because I'd ask for him, if I were you. I found the ambiance very comfortable.  I've seen other reviewers mention that this place is very noisy.  I'm fairly sensitive to noise, myself, and yes, the place is slightly louder than average, but I didn't have to make any effort to hear my date nor she me.  Any restaurant with just one screaming child is much worse.  Speaking of which, this is a place where it's best to get a baby-sitter.

It was chewy, fatty, and overall not very flavorful. Half the steak was left on the plate because it was inedible, for $34 I expect a much better grade of steak. The rice balls, she crab soup, grouper, shrimp and grits, and mushroom dish were all excellent! My friend ordered a cocktail which was very strong and syrupy. Not good! And he was given the wrong red wine which he did not like. Both of my cocktails were good, strong, but with balance. I would recommend and go back but I do feel like the steak and my friends dislike of his drinks marred the experience. Also, it is very loud!

They seemed inspired to work in this fine establishment and if I were exceptionally wealthy I would have given them $100 just because that's what I would do everywhere.  The ambiance is like a barn style mix of restoration hardware with the minimalist thing that appeals to everybody who took riddlin in 2002 while studying for their Anthropology exam.

It was a salad, which was not explained on the menu. There was hardly any grouper. The chicory (greens) was very challenging to eat.  Nothing made sense with the flavor pairings, in my opinion. Well both our opinions, actually. So neither of us liked it at all.  We also got the green tomato dish and that was slightly better than the grouper. But still unimpressive. The tomatoes were good.

This dish was not only completely original it's also a bacon dish that isn't dominated by bacon flavor... Try it!  Here is my only critique... Everything we ate outside of the steak we ate had as a main course had an overall smokey flavor. Now, I realize this is low country cooking, but does everything need to be smokey? Even the shrimp and grits had a smokey flavor. This was my biggest disappointment. Shrimp and grits are meant to be smooth, sweet and buttery. They didn't need to put the smokey gravy on top.

2013-03-09,4.0,"4 Stars Visits : 1 Food : 4 Service : 4 Ambiance : 3.5 Value : 3.5 Summary Carriage House is a modern, yet warm, energetic, inviting place to be for southern staples both old and new executed at a higher level with a great deal of flavor and refinement. Review Recently having traveled to the south and enjoying the cuisine there, we have been looking forward enjoy some staple dishes executed at a high level. Carriage House certainly did not disappoint and it is a very comfortable place to relax and indulge in some really good cooking. The cooking is more Carolina inspired as opposed to New Orleans style though there are some wonderful treats on the menu from both areas. The decor and layout are great - it is very open with a long bar and open kitchen. There is also a small two seat chef's table which would have been fun to sit at. We started with the Greenbush Weissbock, which has an excellent brewpub in Sawyer, Michigan. We did not have cocktails but they looked creative indeed. Overall there were four beers on tap to choose from. Up first was the fried chicken thigh, buttery pickles and hot sauce. The thigh was juicy, boneless and between the batter and chicken had a nice amount of separation. It was not at all greasy, just flavorsome. The hot sauce added a gentle heat and a slight additional amount of acidity. A small amount of honey in the dish was a nice touch.  Next was a lyonaisse salad with confit apple and a pepper jelly vinaigrette, corn nuts and blackened pork belly. It was well balanced and flavorful - good balance of textures and proportions - not too much nor too little of anything. Salads so often have too much lettuce and this was just right. The pork belly had a lot of flavor that balanced out the sweetness of the dish. Shrimp and grits were solid - two large shrimp, creamy grits and a brown gravy, full of flavor with a slight cayenne heat. The cornbread was delicious in its little skillet - it was melt in your mouth and topped with an alarmingly large amount of foie butter. It disappeared in moments. Our final entree was the crispy braised pork shoulder with red beans and rice. The pork was crispy yet very juicy. The beans and rice were a good complement and did not over power the pork. For dessert we had the beignets and the sundae. The beignets were better than what you would find an Cafe Du Monde in Nawlins - they were straight out of the fryer, dusted in sugar and accompanied by a coffee froth sauce that was also chocolatey and was great to coat the little donuts in. The sundae had a nice soft biscuit base and a generous scoop of ice cream.  Overall Carriage House was a real treat. The food was very good and every dish was packed with flavor. We look forward to returning and would recommend it.",0.998,0.791,0.191,0.019,0.5345319264069264

Food was pretty fantastic.  We had the Chicken and waffles and the mushroom grits.  The chicken was well cooked and extremely crispy, but the real star of the show was the spicy maple syrup sauce that came with it....so good I asked for another entire flagon of it.  Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't healthy - but it was extremely tasty.  The mushroom grits were pretty good as well, though I'd try the more traditional shrimp and grits next time. We also ordered a pot of coffee.  It was served in our own little french press!  Not only was this a cool addition, but the coffee was pretty fantastic as well!  Service was great, the waiter knew the menu front and back, and seemed to know when we needed something or when we wanted left alone. Two things kept it from being a 5 star experience.  First, it is on the high end of the brunch price spectrum - I'm not sure that the value was there.  Second, the tables were crammed together.  There are definitely the community tables, but this was just a regular two top, and we were pretty much right on top of the people to either side, not the most private meal I've ever had - and I felt bad for those around us, because we could hear everything!",0.9953,0.722,0.24,0.038,0.6177367077367076

2013-03-04,5.0,"I can't think of a restaurant in Chicago that does low country food as well as Carriage House. Of course the concept is nothing new, and the dishes not very inventive, but if you're in the mood for rich, flavorful food executed to near perfection accompanied by a carefully chosen craft beer or glass of bourbon then Carriage House is a no-brainer! Getting a reservation here, especially on a weekend night is quite a challenge, so we had dinner here on a Tuesday night. To my amazement they were pouring Three Floyds Rye-Da-Tiger on tap that night, which I have not seen available at anywhere else - props to the cicerone!  We started with the fried green tomatos and the shrimp and grits. The oysters were very good, but the shrimp and grits (recommended by our server) was superb. Large, perfectly cooked shrimps smothered in a rich ""hunter gravy,"" which actually had a much lighter texture than expected, and complimented the creaminess of the grits. All three components melded together beautifully. The fried green tomatos were good, but a little too firm for my liking. The sauce that accompanied the tomatos was fantastic and I wish they had served more with it.  We shared the buttermilk marinated ribeye for our entree, which was the right call. It was a large cut of steak. The steak was delicious and I actually thought it was a bargain for $34 considering that the dish was much more complex than a typical steak house, which would charge you more for the same cut of steak. The blue cheese and heirloom tomatos went well with the steak, although I didn't really care for the cornbread croutons, which I thought were unnecessary. Regardless, this was a fantastic entree. Overall we loved Carriage House. Although many Midwesterners may not appreciate the ""low country"" style, you really don't have to in order to enjoy the food. Perfectly executed and flavorful dishs, albeit on the slightly expensive side of the scale. Quickly becoming one of my favorite destinations in Chicago!",0.9983,0.702,0.253,0.045,0.558970922694327

FOOD A few stand-outs were the she-crab soup, shrimp and grits (although we don't prefer ham gravy, the dish was very good), the crispy pork shoulder was delicious. My husband loved the bacon-wrapped rabbit but I thought it just tasted like bacon.  The cornbread was phenomenal - foie gras and apple chutney tasted like buttery-cinnamony goodness on top.  This was a good thing, because the beignets were dense and pretty bad. I don't typically judge a meal by a dessert but I do believe a southern restaurant should either serve a decent beignet or not bother.

Now, I am not opopsed to spending money at a quality place, but when my bill goes to between $200-$300 I was a bit upset. Normally this would have just been a canceled reservation and not much thought, but now I have 24 hours to find a place the day before valentines day. Really had high hopes, and some can write this off as a fluke, but as someone who takes clients out to similar style places, I would suggest managing your website a bit better if you are going to allow reservations online for instances like this one.",0.9397,0.871,0.11,0.019,0.5081818181818183

2013-02-07,4.0,"A little on the pricy side, Carriage House is a great addition to Division street, brought to us by the people who did that place in the bank vault.  I know it's called the Bedford, but every time I talk to someone about it they just call it that restaurant in the bank vault.  I've heard mixed reviews on it, but after our experience at Carriage House I definitely want to try that place too! Atmosphere: fun, a bit loud and on the crowded side in a fun way rather than a Publican elbow-jostling way.  Every time I've walked by in the few months this place has been open, it's been packed.  I walk by every day.  We had a reservation for 9:30, but after waiting for twenty minutes we decided to eat at the bar, which feels the same anyway.  Not a romantic date place, but all the portions are perfect for two (maybe four). Service: can't say too much because we were at the bar, but the bartender was quite good at his job.  He had an understudy-looking person who couldn't identify the dishes, which was perplexing since there's only about 20 dishes on the menu.   FOOD: they suggest splitting a few starters/sides, and then getting a supper.  Next time we'll skip the supper and just get starters/sides.  These are split into 'traditional' and 'reimagined', and we only got reimagined.  So next time, traditional collard greens and shrimp and grits and fried chicken it is! Favorites: -Mushroom, egg and cheese: incredible creamy/toasty grits with poached eggs, deeply flavorful mushrooms, some kind of cheese, and grilled greens.  Boy's favorite dish. -Roasted oysters: I'd never had cooked oysters before, so this was a treat for me.  The warm coolness of an oyster paired beautifully with a creamy sauce (buttermilk aioli: isn't that mayo?) and crispy fried onions.  Bartender said it's like an oyster BLT.  My favorite. Great: -Skillet cornbread: cute little skillet (maybe 5"" diameter?) of very bacony cornbread, dark on the outside, golden on top, with a sweet butter and perfect sprinkling of chives.  This was a great start to our meal, with the richness of the cornbread tempered by the butter and bright notes of chives.  I really want to emphasize how much I loved the chives. OK: -Pork shoulder supper: We really liked the red peas and rice this was served on, which were somehow juicy (I didn't know rice could be juicy!) and delicious, as well as the poached pears and pickled peppers that accompanied it.  But the big hunk of pork itself was a bit dry and not that flavorful.  As boy said, it tasted like something you would be slightly pleased with yourself for making at home.   Not so great: -Creme brulee: the idea is there, but the execution was off.  The rice pudding was cold on the bottom and was just cold rice in custard there, and on the top it was beautifully warmed and creamy just under that crackly layer of deliciousness, along with more poached pears.  But ugh that cold bottom layer sort of ruined the dish for us.   I've got a terrible memory for drinks but we had two DELICIOUS cocktails which were very fun and unusual.  They were also some of those secretly alcoholic drinks, where they taste so good you don't realize how much alcohol you're intaking until you're home after your meal and ready to pass out.   Overall, we loved it and definitely are going to come back.  At $50 a head including cocktails, it was a nicer night out.  But if we lose the cocktails and the supper, it'll be much more of a weeknight place, at least for our budget.",0.9994,0.744,0.234,0.022,0.5885211267605635

My friend started off with one of the specialty cocktails and was very underwhelmed by it! She said it tasted like a beam and diet she could have made at home, and when I tasted it, I had to agree! Also, their wine list seems a bit overpriced to me. I dont like when restaurants dont offer a reasonable bottle of wine...I dont find $44 reasonable...sorry.  On to the food. Two of us started with the She Crab Soup and it was creamy and delicious. The wonton was a tad over salty, but the texture and flavor of the soup was delicious otherwise. Next was the Lyonnaise Salad with pork belly and I really liked this. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and I liked the crunch the corn nuts added. My friends had mixed reviews regarding this one. Next was the Bacon Wrapped Rabbit and it was phenomenal! Probably my favorite dish of the evening. Lastly, we split the Carlina Grouper. This was also very good. The fish was crispy and the sauce was nice. I had been planning on getting this as my meal and I was glad I did not, it was good, but it wasnt great.  I think our waiter was kind of annoyed we didnt order more, but among the three of us we felt it was plenty of food. I did feel the menu is a bit overpriced for what you get.

It was not like the ones I had in NOLA but they were satisfactory.   Next came my main of Carolina Grouper with beans and collard greens.  It was wonderful.  The grouper was very tasty and firm fish and better than the grouper that I had in the Caribbean.  My boyfriend ate the greens and peas just in case it was cooked with pork.   I concluded the meal with beignets with coffee froth.  The froth was a nice element that made the beignets take on a new flavor.  My boyfriend had the she crab soup, where he was scraping the the bottom of the bowl. Next came the pork belly with grits.  He packed what little he had of the pork belly to make a sandwich later at home.  So, I would recommend this place for those who eat fish, but if you are more restrictive, this will be a tough option for you.  Happy Restaurant Week!

Carriage House is definitely in the former category, serving uniformly solid, if not Earth-shattering low country fare. I came here a couple Fridays ago before seeing the Book of Mormon. Fried green tomatoes with hot sauce vinaigrette and pickled shrimp ($9) make an excellent starter, crisp on the outside and comforting on the inside, with just the right amount of buttermilk twang. Charleston she-crab soup ($6) is rich, but not overwhelmingly so, which is often the case with lesser seafood bisque-ish soups. Low country boil ($34) comes with a melange of clams and jumbo shrimp, which would be bland were it not complemented by a truly remarkable rabbit chorizo. Collard greens ($5) are cooked perfectly and served in slurp-worthy pot likker. Bruleed rice pudding ($8) has a perfect burnt sugar top, but the pudding underneath is a little unremarkable. Probably my lowlight Pricing is a tad high, but not so high that I felt fleeced. Service is excellent; hospitality is clearly taken very seriously here.

We had the picnic board, shrimp and grits, fried chicken thigh, and fried green tomatoes to start. The pork shoulder (I think, the pork special whatever it was) and boil as mains with greens on the side. It was a lot of food.  The picnic board was rocking but would be immensely improved with the inclusion of crackers. The cornbread serving is too small to pick up everything. The pimento cheese was straight out of my childhood -- so good and so trashy. Yum. The pickles were excellent and I was happy to see them throughout the meal. The friend chicken was tender and moist and crisp. The shrimp and grits were too salty and the grits were only so so. The fried green tomatoes were perfect though. That's all there is to say. Perfect. The greens were a total salt fest. I could't have more than a few bites before my tongue felt pickled. I've noticed this problem at a few southern places in Chicago but I always hope that they'll get it right because good greens are one of the best foods on earth.  The boil was... fine. No corn on the cob which I guess technically it is possible to do a boil without but I've certainly never seen it before. Lots of root vegetables, not just the classic potatoes (which I considered a negative and my husband considered a positive). The texas toast was an excellent touch given that everything came in a pot with juice (must be an SC thing -- I'm more used to the dumping of the boil over newspaper/grates to get the good stuff out of the water, but the sauce was good so no complaints). The sausage in it was a total cumin bomb -- meaty cumin and no other flavor. The clams were cooked nicely and the shrimp was tasty.  The drink menu was ridiculous. Instead of printing what is actually on draft, they printed the companies/breweries they have on draft and you get to ask what they actually have. What a waste of time! I get that these things change, but you should be able to make a beer selection without a server explaining all the options. We had a reservation and were seated at a table with bar stools instead of real chairs. Unacceptable. Keep those tables for walk-ins. And, of course, everything was significantly overpriced, but I've kind of come to accept that from southern food in Chicago. It was also so loud that we had to yell to hear each other.

They have two sets of appetizers, Traditional and Reimagined.  Honestly all 4 appetizers we tried could have fit into each category.   We started with two from the traditional side -  the fried green tomatoes that were topped with shrimp and a creamed red pea sauce  and the fried chicken thigh, which had a thick batter which managed to be crunchy and chewy at the same time (which is a good thing) with a sweet potato hot sauce, which I loved (coming from someone who is not a sweet potato fan).  Both dishes were excellent, yet I wouldn't call them traditional in the least.  One the other side we had the quail and a bacon wrapped rabbit sausage.  The sausage was a little too gamey for me, although the other person I was dining with thought it was awesome.  The quail was out of this world, the best dish of the night (and the waiters favorite).  The dumpling wrapped into the quail (I think), gave it a nice dual texture against the bird and the sauce was delicious.  All four dishes were great and each one was really a different take on whatever I was expecting from the dish. For the entree we split the low country boil.  A heart hodge podge of shrimp, clams, various vegetables and yet a different type of rabbit sausage (ironically I loved this one).  I would recommend the dish to anyone who likes seafood, although out of everything we ordered that night, this was the most straightforward.  Not that it was bad, but it was basically everything I thought it would be.  The party next to us ordered the pork shoulder and that had me drooling from afar.  The highlight of the low country boil was the thick buttered (and grilled) toast that they gave you to sop up all the sauce, I thought it beat out their cornbread (which seems to get a lot of attention, but I thought it was a good cornbread...nothing crazy) as our preferred carb of the night. Prices are a touch higher than I expected, but nothing too crazy.  We walked out of there with a few drinks a piece and the right amount of food for under $200 with tip.  Service was great, waiter was friendly and well informed without being overbearing. Definitely worth a trip, although my opentable table reservation was easy to get the place was jam packed on a random Wednesday at 8 pm, so I would def recommend booking ahead.  At the heart of it all, Carriage House manages to be delivery very good southern comfort cooking with a modern/upscale touch.",0.9959,0.819,0.157,0.024,0.5730129870129871

It's a nice idea to have an open kitchen, but if the chefs are visibly sweating balls and are knocking things over and then sloppily cleaning it up, it's not a great setting.  2) Service was poor, and the floor staff was either inexperienced or overbooked on tables. Our server did NOT serve us during key times of the meal such as when we first sat down (took her 10 minutes to greet us), when the food came out, or when the coffee ran out. Food took over 25 minutes to arrive, and during this wait, there was no reassurance that we were going to get fed.  The person who was dressed in a 3 piece suit striding aimlessly through the place was presumably the floor manager. He spent most of his time walking from one end of the floor to the other which, if you didn't look closely looked like he was actually busy doing something, sometimes with a coffee pot in hand, avoiding eye contact. But funny enough, he never came to refill our coffee! He had a look on his face like ""don't ask anything of me!! don't yell at me!"" and it did not really provide a professional or confident atmosphere to the front of the house.  3) Portion are tiny! teeny tiny! My boyfriend ordered biscuits and gravy. He got ONE biscuit, and a dolop of sausage gravy. For +$10. But it came with a bunch of wtf extras like pimiento cheese and pickles sandwiched in the middle. As weird as it sounded, it was also not very delicious. I got the shrimp and grits, which again were measured in dolops. Came with two jumbo shrimp. My meal was fiiiine although the plate smelled like dirty rags...or maybe that was the pungent cheese. Our side of bacon did not disappoint though. For $4 we had about 8 pieces of thick cut bacon.  And not to be a total debbie downer...the only things I enjoyed about Carriage House was the hot cask iron cornbread with sweet butter (mmm!) and the interesting decor.",0.9558,0.811,0.114,0.075,0.5554148426099647

Enjoyed many great flavors. Shrimp and grits were one of my faves, as was the she crab soup. Hubby's fried green tomatoes were delicious as were two seafood dishes we tried. We brought oiur foodie 11-year old who was treated like a valued grown up customer--help adjusting her seat at a high top table,, folding her napkin, walking her through mocktail choices, offering a steak kniife when she was tackling a new dish, So much so that she went back a second time on her own and thanked our server personally. With all the fabulous food choices in Chicago, smart resaurants know you must have the service component right to get people back. My days of putting up with mediocre service are over no matter how good the food is. Kudos to Carriage House for addressing what is sadly becoming complacency at good restaurants that could be great with a pro management team and some house rules.  We will be back frequently!! My only holdback on a star was the noise level--don't think there is much that can be done there given the design and the deservedly big crowd, but was a little high energy where we were sitting, May request the porch or deeper into the restaurant next time, Keep up the great work!",0.9971,0.736,0.243,0.021,0.534951714951715
2012-12-27,4.0,"If I could title this review, it would be ""tasty but pricey."" Let's start with the food. Delicious. Seriously, I cannot rave enough about what we had and how happy I was with the variety on the menu. But of course, that comes with a price (which I'll get to next). For me and two friends, the waitress recommended 2-3 starters, a ""supper"" (fuller portion) and two sides. Seemed like a lot and in hindsight, after seeing the dish size, I would cut back one side. Depends how hungry you are.  For our food we got the following (with commentary included next to each): -- Skillet cornbread: party in my mouth. Very traditional but tasty, light and not too dry. Plus the butter on top is incredible. -- Grits: Tasty but a bit spicy, this dish definitely fell to the ""we're too full"" side so we didn't eat the entire thing -- Pulled Pork Shoulder with beans, rice and apples: SO tasty. Bigger portion indeed but it was very tender and nicely seasoned. This definitely delivered. -- Mushroom, Truffle and Egg: My favorite dish of everything we had. The oyster mushrooms were a perfect pair with the grits and egg mixed together. Really, really flavorful. Cannot rave about this enough -- Bacon wrapped rabbit: Not my favorite dish. The bacon flavor didn't really come through and honestly, the rabbit tasted dry. I wouldn't run back for this -- Carolina Gold Rice Balls: SO good (but not as good as the Mushroom, Truffle, Egg). The pimento cheese with the rice was really good and a perfect 1-2 bites. Note: You only get three per serving. So you can see that we had a ton of stuff and a good variety of things from the menu. This, plus cocktails (which individually were just okay) and a pitcher of drinks (which was a decent value for how much we got), it was a pricey night. I love the warm, cozy interior of this place and the decor, but given how much you pay and how much food you get, I reco going a) not totally hungry or b) stopping by for food after.

The staff is nice and you can ask them for recommendations...and chances are they would all tell you to get the skillet cornbread. You should get the cornbread.

Very fresh, very flavorful. The shrimp and grits was not bad, but the fried chicked thigh definitely stole the show.  Our approach was to try as many dishes as possible, so we only got one entree to share and got many apps instead.

2012-12-18,2.0,"(Before I start, this review is for brunch. I'll need to come back for dinner... maybe.) So Carriage House. One of the ""hottest"" places of Fall/Winter 2012. Good reviews and whatnot. But sadly I cannot jump on the train right now. Great space, but spotty service and disappointing menu. There are better places for southern food/brunch in the city (ie Big Jones, The Southern, etc). First of all, the restaurant space is gorgeous and the environment feels great and comfortable. Spacy, clean, huge windows with a lot of light, modern but home-y. Aesthetically pleasing. Even though it's a more casual place, the staff and guests obviously took some time in the morning to look nice. You're not showing up in your hoodie and uggs (hopefully), though of course this is 'merica you can do whatever you want. Funny enough, literally 25-35% of the people in Carriage House had dark, thick-rimmed glasses. A high concentration, even for Division/Wicker Park. Not a big deal. Anyhow, the food. Right off the bat, I thought the menu was a little confusing (warning: the next part I'm probably going to sound really stupid but hopefully someone understands). Most of the entrees are ~$10, give or take. Enough to make it seem like you just order one per person, and a side too. So between the 2 of us, we order: Shrimp and grits ($14) Biscuit and gravy ($10) Side of Skillet Cornbread ($7) Side of House Bacon ($4) When everything comes out, first thing I think is that entree portions are small, which makes me wonder if the menu is meant to be a lot of small plates and you order 1.5-2 per person. Because one entree would definitely leave me disappointingly hungry (and left the girls sitting next to us hungry). To me, it's inherently confusing for a southern food place to serve small entrees, when I usually associate southern food with larger portions. But whatever.  Even more confusing is that the portions for the sides were relatively big! A mound of bacon (probably enough for 4 people as a side) and a 6""(?) cast-iron skillet of cornbread (again, enough for 4 people as a side).  So just from a value perspective, would I have been better off ordering a bunch of sides (2-3 for the price of one entree)? Obviously I wouldn't be getting a real composed (sort of) entree, but at least I would get enough quality food to feel satisfied. But in any case, out of what we ordered, I thought the cornbread was the best. Hot, fluffy, it was good (as it should at $7). And the bacon was bacon, great of course and an awesome relative value. The shrimp and grits were fine, forgettable at the price. But the biscuit (one) and gravy was just weird for me. The pimento and pickle make the entree overbearingly sweet and sour, wiping out any hint of sausage or flavor of the gravy, when I usually think of biscuitS and gravy as a very hearty, robust kind of dish. Basically a cheesy pickle biscuit sandwich, covered in whatever. And then 3 cubes of pineapple, 2 cubes of honeydew, a sad-looking showing, as if I needed more sweet in my life anyhow. When we were there, the service was spotty. My coffee was empty the majority of the time. Food was coming out pretty slowly for us and most of the other guests it seemed. I don't know, the place just didn't have a good hum to it. Anyway, I wouldn't come back for brunch. And I'm hesitant to try Carriage House for dinner.

She told us that our table wasn't ready and asked to enjoy a few cocktails at the bar while waiting for out table. Suree!! As we took our seats by the bar, she approached us and gave us a bench table in the middle of the restaurant instead of waiting for the table of two. Sweet!!!

We went with Creole Cocktail for my boyfriend and I had the Lionel Hutz. My boyfriend, the cocktail enthusiast loved his drink and while mine was slightly too strong for me, I still loved it. Later on, my boyfriend ordered the  To start, we ordered Fried Chicken Thigh and Skilled Corn Bread. Both were very delicious. I am a fan of the Corn Bread and i thought that was one of the best corn bread i've had. To our surprised, they brought in the Lowcountry Oyster Roast. YUM!!! Now, that was delicious. Everytime I think of this place, I've always thought of the Oyster Roast. It was super delicious. I highly recommend this! Now, we didin't order the Oyster Roast and were wondering why they served us this. Later on, I thought, maybe because they knew we were celebrating our anniversary and gave us a complimentary dish? I thought that was very thoughtful and lovely :) For our main course, we decided to share the Lowcountry Boil. It was really good as well. Lastly, we shared a plate of dessert. We enjoyed the overall dining experience, the food was super tasty, the service was top-notched, even the bussers and food runners were very attentive. We were very impressed.

Pork belly salad was another hit, however it was a little heavy on dressing, I love acidity, but this dish was a little too much for me to finish it.

While I don't claim to be a Charlestonian, I did live there for a while.  My wife's family is from Charleston and we were married there, so I feel like I can speak with some credibility on low country food. Carriage House definitely delivers on the promise of low country cuisine (heavy seafood and pork focus) and could rival some of the best places in Charleston itself.  Every dish seemed to be better than the last.   What we had: Fried Green Tomatoes - Very good, nice spicy sauce with pickled shrimp on top. Low Country Oyster Roast - Excellent.  Tomato jam really makes this dish.  Shrimp & Grits - As someone who served this at their own wedding, I can say that this did not disappoint.  I wish I could order a giant bowl and not share. Rice Balls - Good take on Arancini, but I wish the pimento cheese had played stronger. Cornbread - It changes seasonally.  We had vidalia onion jam and foie butter on ours.  It was excellent and the cornbread itself was very light, almost cake like. Pork Shoulder - Also excellent.  I'm trying to figure why they gave us knives to use on the dish, because just looking at the dish caused the pork to shred itself. We finished off with some beignets that were excellent, but not really a true Charleston dessert.  My only real complaint is that my stomach isn't bigger so I could've tried every dish on the menu. Drinks were also good as well as service.  Our waiter (I thought he said his name was Sid, but the ticket said Will) was on top of his game and very friendly. To top it all off, we got to sit at some stools overlooking the kitchen.  This allowed us to talk to the line as well as Chef Mark while we ate dinner.  Built in entertainment with an excellent meal.  We'll be back, in fact, I've already made another reservation to bring friends with us.

Sure, I don't really start thinking about my annual favorites until the end of the year (sorry January restaurants!), but the mushroom, truffle, and egg dish was spot-on. Baked grits, oyster mushrooms, soft egg, truffle vinaigrette, shaved thomasville tomme, all in a little cast-iron serving dish. It was savory and rich and creamy and perfect. The rest of our meal was equally excellent. I really enjoyed by Angry Orchard Mule punch - tart, icy, and refreshing. The she-crab soup was rich and crabby (in the good way). I loved the pickled shrimp on the fried green tomatoes. The buttermilk marinated ribeye was perfectly cooked, and I loved the accompanying cheese, heirloom tomato, cornbread croutons, and the grilled chicory (love that chicory!). Splash a few drops of Carriage House's hot pepper vinegar all over your bite... and you have ribeye heaven.  Side note: Please bottle and sell that hot pepper vinegar? Pretty please? I am obsessed. We ended up our meal with a pear cobbler with a gingersnap crust and a magnolia blossom oolong tea from their impressive list of Rare Tea Cellars products.

2012-10-30,3.0,"An off night?  Not sure given all I had heard about this place.  But it surely didn't live up to all the hype or the type of service that I usually get from it's sister restaurant, The Bedford. We were there on one of those perfect Fall nights.  The kind that make you long to sit outside but you know it's going to get cold quickly.  So inside seating it was. As I waited for my friends at the bar- I tried to engage the bartender in some friendly banter but she was having none of it.  Maybe it's because I didn't order one of her specialty drinks (I wanted a martini) or maybe she is one of those bartenders who lack the gift of gab but regardless- she made a decent drink even if talking with her guests was not high on her list (surprising as the place was empty when I got there!) Once my friends arrived we were quickly seated and began to look over the menu.  Our server had an attitude from the second he walked over to the table.  You should have seen the look on his face when my friend ordered a margarita.  ""It's not on the menu"", said he.  Really?  There is a full bar with tequila, and all the mixin's- please go and put one together.  He did.  But not without more grumbling that he didn't know how to ""ring it in"".   This pretty much set the tone for the rest of the night as the server was impatient, not forthcoming with reccos (a pet peeve of mine- say something  . . . .anything!) and seemed like we were just too much of a bother to bother with.  Couple that with the overly aggressive bus staff and we were grabbing onto our plates with both hands to keep half eaten food from being taken away. But if that wasn't bad enough- what put it over the top for me in the ""bad service"" category was that my friend had ordered the ""picnic spread"" which had a small amount of spreadable pimento cheese on it.  She asked for a side of this with her cornbread as she enjoyed it so much, and the server not only made a big stink about getting it for her (""I don't think I can do that"", said he) but when he delivered it to the table, he made sure to point out the huge ""FAVOR"" he had done to get her that cheese,  Favor?  It's a restaurant.  We asked for something you had and you served it which is your job.  And BTW- we paid for it so don't be so righteous! But putting the shoddy service aside- the food here is good.  Very good!  There were 4 of us so we had a chance to taste a wide range of the menu.  The fried green tomatoes were so good we re ordered more after the first go around.  The Lyonaise salad with the pork belly was delicious!  The picnic spread is a nice way to start out your night.  And the fried chicken and the seafood pot were also quite tasty.  The seafood pot had shrimp, clams, corn and potatoes in it and was ceremoniously delivered to the table by someone other than our server.  We wanted to order dessert but by this time- we had had just about enough of our server so we decided to go elsewhere. If you drive- know that there is no valet so you are on your own to find street parking . . .easy sometimes, impossible other times.   This should have been a 4 star review.  But bad service is never okay in my book.",0.9978,0.812,0.152,0.036,0.5778395061728395

Well, sorry Sevilla, but Carriage House blew my freaking mind. The scene is slightly chaotic. It is loud inside, which really just added to the friendly vibe of the place. Lots of celebrating going on. There were groups of girls, couples on dates, double dates with a baby (a super cute and well-behaved baby, I might add), and of course my special dinner. It was a great spot for a happy occasion. I really wanted to order one of EVERYTHING on the menu. It was familiar ingredients with lovely twists, which is a nice change of pace from ordering from menus where half the ingredients make you go, ""say whaaaa now?""

Rich and creamy, it was perfect for sharing. My husband wanted his own, however.) -Roasted Oysters. (Delightful! Loved the smoky flavor.) -Fried chicken thighs. (YES. Plain or coated in their homemade sweet potato hot sauce, amazing.) -Ribeye. If you're a meat eater, this is tops. It was a smidge over-cooked (we ordered medium rare) but it still was tender, juicy, and flavorful. It was actually a decent portion for sharing, which we did. -Sundae. Butter pecan ice cream, shortbread and bourbon caramel? YES PLEASE. Salty and sweet, this dessert really knocked my socks off. We started with cocktails as well (Angry Mule and the Creole Cocktail), then had a bottle of wine. It's fair to say we ate and drank our faces off at Carriage House. I loved every moment of it.

2012-09-30,1.0,"This place is pretty much miserable.  We came here by accident (happened upon it on our way to another bar).  We were here for about 2.2 minutes before we were treated like absolute shit.   Not only was the service miserable, which you would think would be better with 3 other people in the bar, but they treated us like we were doing them a dis-service but interrupting their ""happy hour"".  With all the other fun bars to go to in Bucktown, this bar is absolutely not worth the while.  The drinks sucked too.",0.4183,0.682,0.162,0.155,0.6875
2012-09-30,5.0,"Everything was delicious - although I will say the portions could be a tiny bit bigger (I know its ""small plates"" - but come on).  The shrimp and grits really stands out in my mind, i would have liked more of it.  The grouper was delicious and the pork was pretty great.  The cornbread was pretty spectacular (this SPECIFICALLY could have been larger, it was like $7 for a few bites -- I feel like cornbread should be plentiful).  Man, that shrimp and grits.....",0.9871,0.684,0.316,0.0,0.6535714285714286

2012-09-25,5.0,"Fantastic dinner! Started with cocktails at the bar. Have the Chartreuse Elixir. It was a great palatte cleanser! We tasted a lot. Huge fans of the fried green tomatoes and the cucumber salad. We had the pork shoulder; it was wonderfully tender, but the crispy outside made for a great contrast in texture. Dessert was incredible! We had the cobbler. Its ginger snap crust was out of control. Star of the show: cornbread! The foie gras butter on top was delicious! Service was terrific, and we can't wait to go back! Congrats!",0.9858,0.716,0.284,0.0,0.6708333333333334

I was hesitant to go because I am not a Southern food lover, but since the place is so pretty and it's 3 blocks from my pad, I decided to check it out anyways.  I had an awesome time overall. The food was absolutely delicious...even if you don't like Southern food, I still suggest that you go. We had the shrimp and grits and some mushroom egg dish. Both were fantastic, I pretty much licked the plate meaning that I would go back again and again and get those dishes. I would like to return and try more. The food seems to be high quality and gourmet. This place is by no means dietetic, but who cares, summer is over!  The bartender was awesome too. He made me a cocktail, not on the menu, from scratch and I was highly impressed with his skills. Although the place is new, he was knowledgable of the menu and he was cool to have as company from behind the bar.  As I said before, this place is prettty. Gorgeous design, a southern, rustic feel with a modern twist. It's definitely upscale, but not an overly pretentious place with River North accents. There was a young hipstery vibe, but I can see this place catering to any aged foodie. They have valet outside or it's a few blocks from the blue line Division stop.",0.9901,0.755,0.176,0.07,0.48373376623376624
2012-09-20,5.0,"went there on opening night... the decor is definitely straight out of southern living but a bit updated!! started off with the crab soup... delicious!!! theres a drop biscuit with a little crab salad on top.. a taste of crab in every sip!! super delicious!!! cornbread with nectarine jam and foie gras butter... first of all they have foie gras butter on cornbread?! when it first came out, i was kinda like... who are they trying to feed with this easy bake oven cake pan!?!?!?! well, this girl was about to be pleasantly surprised... its buttery and crunchy crust but soft middle paired with the sweetness of the jam and the rich heavy foie gras butter was super good. its on the small side though its def a teaser... note to self: get one for myself next time. chicken thigh... the batter of the fried chicken is delicious... making me want to see if they have brunch with chicken and waffles. theres something super sweet in the batter that makes it soo yummy!!! and it comes with pickles... its kinda like a chicken biscuit without the biscuit! we got the golden rice balls... which are basically a redesigned arancini... but the rice ball is super cute and fried crunchy. theres pork neck gravy slathered all over it... super good!! and then some pickled cabbage to top it off! i dont remember how / why but we ended up with a bottle of sweet potato hot sauce... ummm... how come i have never heard of this and how is it so delicious!?!?!? i literally had it within arms reach the entire meal, i also saw a bottle with red peppers and decided i needed some of that in my life too... so hot pepper vinegar was brought over too. delicious on everything!!! HOT SAUCE!!! got the lowcountry boil... a dutch oven pot filled with corn, potatoes, rabbit sausage, shrimp and clams... super good and the broth was good too!!! i like that it isnt as intense of a seasoning as old bay or something. danny the manager? stopped by made sure everything was good and talked with us about the restaurants, the crab soup and was super sweet. definitely recommend and will be returning as soon as ive worked off the weight ive gained from the dinner!!! :)",0.9993,0.683,0.304,0.013,0.6515491452991454

Best of all, they are going to add a real deal southern style wood porch complete with rocking chairs!",0.9412,0.764,0.236,0.0,0.4285714285714285
