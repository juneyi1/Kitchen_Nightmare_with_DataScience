First off, I had to settle for my third choice on beer. Second, they delivered my fiancé's soup even before we had ordered our main courses. Lastly, the Delmonico steak that I had ordered was overdone, and the horseradish crust was terrible.  All of this on an early Sunday evening.  I did send the steak back and had a new one cooked (without the crust), which did turn out better.  My fiancé and I thought, however, that even though her food was good and they did get the steak corrected, that this meal was clearly not worth the amount of money that we paid for it. I'm hoping that in the closing weeks, that this place would return to the standard that I've experienced before, and know that they're capable of providing",0.885,0.853,0.102,0.044,0.36522727272727273

Carmichael's wasn't famous like Gibson's or glamorous like Chicago Cut or fancy like Mastro's, but it served quite good food with decent service in a slightly neglected atmosphere. The decor seems as though it hadn't been maintained in decades. The prices were lower than most of the other steakhouses in Chicago and the menu was pretty big without losing much quality. The bone-in ribeye was better than the ones at Mastro's, Sullivan's, and Smith & Wollensky's. Supposedly they're closing because the space is going to be used for apartments.

Once we saw her, I had to return the fish special - fluke - as it was too salty for me to eat. One of the managers came by 2 times to ensure I didn't want to order something else and wanted to ensure I did not go home hungry. The rest of the group enjoyed their meals - steak, pork chops (huge portion size! - would recommend sharing), salmon (was delicious and perfectly cooked! the orange sesame glaze gave it a sweet taste which I enjoyed), Mediterranean salad, and ahi tuna salad.

The dipping sauces were simple (soy sauce and Mae Ploy) and just didn't jive with the flavor of the tempura and/or lobster.  For entrees we ordered the Mel B's bone in ribeye with a garlic parmesean crust, and the meatloaf tower.  The crust of the ribeye was good, but the steak itself was over cooked and in general, was a poor cut of meat.  There was essentially no marbling and it really tasted closer to hamburger than steak.  The meatloaf tower was mediocre at best - it was overly garlicy and salty (two things I usually can't get enough of!) and the consistency was closer to a sausage.   If I had to go back, I would just choose to drink my dinner at the bar.",0.9075,0.84,0.104,0.056,0.48526077097505677

One star here only for the bussing staff and ambiance, both of which were great,but if I could give zero stars for the rest I would.  First- restaurant is about half full with a good assortment of servers. My wine took a good 10 minutes to get to our table, and it took another 10 minutes to track down our server for an appetizer. My husband says we're ready to order when our server finally appears again, I ask about the specials only to have her explain them and then say that she'll give us some more time and run off! My jaw dropped. We were ready to order and she literally walked away from us. Then it took another 10 minutes for her to return. When our food finally arrived it was completely inconsistent. We both ordered the same meal cooked the same way and my steak came out undercooked and my husband's even more undercooked. I would have complained but lord knows how long it would have taken us to get a refire from the kitchen. To add insult to injury, our server kept stopping by the neighboring table (who had to request her attention from another server) and completely ignoring us. So I sat with my bloody $40 steak in silent misery.  All in all, better to take business to a real steak house where the chef cares about the food they put on your plate and where the service is attentive.

2014-10-05,1.0,"Friday night, Oct 5th my husband and I made reservations to have dinner and celebrate our 5th year anniversary. When he called to make reservations we were told there was only availability at 8:30 & on. So we opted for 8:30(really wishing we could have been accommodated at 7, but not possible according to them). Upon arrival, the restaurant was only a quarter full.. We looked at each other in disbelieve & just brushed off the fact that it was quite empty being that they had a ""packed"" house & we couldn't get earlier reservations. We were sat and we waited about a good 7 minutes before the waiter even approached the table. The only person who was attentive was a Hispanic lady who was in charge of bringing the bread & water & picks up all the dirty plates.  Finally the waiter came and asked for our drink's, so I ordered a bottle of wine & my husband a drink.  We then began to look at appetizers and were ready to order, however the waiter was too busy chatting with a table of 2 guys and a female who seemed to be something important as they sat there with beanie hats, gym shoes, & sloppy jeans & hoodies.. He was not the only one to be at this table as some of the other waiters also came by and sat with them..might have been an off duty employee that seemed to have a lot of importance.. As my husband and I sat waiting patiently for some service to order appetizers. Waited patiently for 10+minutes..they were very careless and had lots of giggles to share as their high paying consumers were ignored. Finally when he decided he was done, he walked over 3 steps to our table and asked if we were ready to order something. My husband sarcastically said, ""are you ready? We have been waiting for you to be done and the available"".. The waiter by the name of Nick said, ""no I'm good, go ahead"".. After we ordered out appetizers we saw another gentleman who was busy bringing everyone's food out and the same female hard working lady who cleans our tables and refreshes our water. After this, it took the waiter another 20 minutes to take our final entree order. After our entree was brought by the same guy who brought out our appetizer, We didn't see The waiter again until I waved him down to ask for boxes. After the 1st initial wine pour, he did not bother to refresh(pour) another glass for me nor did he ask my husband if he needed anything else to drink not did he come by to see if anything was ok. My husband had to ask another server to kindly being him a diet soda. After our food was put to go, the waiter brought out a small lava cake w vanilla ice cream. I guess this was his way I'm mending the poor quality service he offered. Well, this $7 dessert did not make up for it. We usually tip 20% off the total amount including tip, because of his poor service we decided we would only be leaving 15%. We reserved our Comment to Nick because we figured it would do us no good. So, I have this to vent and I will be writing a letter to the owner or management if the restaurant. My $200 tab can be taken to a higher end place like Chicago Cut Steakhouse instead!  Very disappointed with such a poor service.. That's a shame because we really liked this place before.. Seems like it's just becoming a casual dining place instead of a dressy upscale restaurant.

2014-09-29,5.0,"This is one of the best places in Chicago to sit outside and enjoy a beautiful evening.   The outside seating area is next to a small private park, which is dramatically lit.  There are no high rises around to obscure the view of the sky.  It's like a setting out of a movie.  Add to this free parking, and what more could you ask for?  A good meal and great service, of course.  Carmichaels delivers. The entrees are generous, but if you want the full dining experience, start with the blue cheese wedge salad and the crisp calamari.  Feel like blowing the budget?  I love the strip steak, plus the mashed potatoes and the asparagus sides (big enough to share).  Because the menu is on the pricey side, you can keep costs down by choosing one of their gigantic burgers, which is a meal in itself. I've found that my dining experience is closely related to the time I show up. If I come during the week or early on a weekend night, the service is usually excellent.  If I show up at  7:00 on Saturday night... or worse yet at 5:30 before a Bulls or Hawks game or anything at United Center... I feel rushed, and the service can be not up to par. I almost always leave room for dessert.  The best dessert here is an apple pie in a bag... outrageous and worth the carbs and the cost.  Crumbly crust, crisp cooked apples, special sauce, vanilla ice cream... you get the picture.  I recommend you share it. I'm giving Carmichaels five stars for the outside dining experience.  I don't care for the main dining area.  It's a cavernous room without much appeal, and when it's packed, the noise level is too high.  If I was just judging the indoor experience, I'd only give it four stars.",0.992,0.785,0.176,0.039,0.4369995590828924

The host/hostess were professional and very friendly, but the waiter was unbelievable.  He was not friendly, seemed quite tired (it was very early into the evening) and he appeared most uncomfortable just having to walk to the various tables.  He had no sense of humor and his personality lacked genuine interest in waiting on us.  I have to say, I didn't notice him being any more gracious to the customers at other nearby tables either.  I actually wondered if he was feeling alright. A basket of rolls with sesame crackers are complimentary with a cheese spread.  The crackers are good and I liked the cheese, but it, too, had a bit too much salt in it as well.  The rolls are unnecessary.

2014-07-30,3.0,Pretty good food !  First we started with the bread and cheese ? spread. The spread although complimentary was reminiscent of cheez whiz. Then we had to ask the waitress multiple times for silverware and plates for the bread instead of awkwardly holding it above the table. We still waited awkwardly for silverware by the time the salad and oysters came out. The oysters were just ok-- a little dry maybe indicative that they were not freshly shucked.  The patio area was nice though the furniture was plastic ? Kind of tacky. I get that volatile weather may not make patio furniture a good investment but it's still a detail I wish they would think about.  I had the 8 oz filet --which was cooked well but the 'crust' they advertised wasn't anything more than a slab of butter with herbs. Still delicious but not a crust.  The sides were good but not as advertised. If you say garlic mash ... I'm expecting strong garlic taste.  The desserts were also just ok. We got the chocolate lava cake and I've seen better.  Finally FYI: their patio area can be mosquitoey and there's a bell that children can't help but ring for some reason.,0.9858,0.794,0.178,0.028,0.6289855072463767

Our sides or garlic mashed and sauteed mushrooms were really tasty also. The lemon blueberry cake was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. Overall, this was a great experience.

We were quite neglected most of the evening, probably because of a large party taking up the middle of the restaurant. I understood that our server's attention was split, but I still expected to have an enjoyable experience rather than being rushed through the ordering process and our bottle of wine and then having to wait forever until someone noticed us to pay the bill. Anyway, the food was worth it and I would come back and order the exact same thing, which was the Bison filet. I ordered it medium rare, and it was perfectly cooked, and came with asparagus and delicious mashed potatoes. The bread and pub cheese that begins your meal was also delicious and I ate more of it than I should have, but it didn't stop me from cleaning my plate. My friend didn't have as good of an experience with her entree, but she ordered her beef filet medium well and butterflied. The meat came overcooked, though I almost blamed her more for ordering it as she did than the restaurant. I used a groupon to try this place, and I will be coming back for more- though maybe on a less busy night so that my enjoyment of the food won't be spoiled by the inattentive service.

2013-10-31,4.0,"Carmichael's is a nice, pricey place to get a good steak. The bar area is small, but is manned by good bartenders. I asked the bartender to recommend a good Malbec, which he did. When I told him that something tasted ""off,"" he replaced my drink with an excellent cabernet, even though he thought the Malbec was fine. In the winter, you can feel the cold through the glass picture windows and revolving door, so be aware.  The dining space is open and inviting.  If you can, try to avoid the square tables against the brick wall/windows, space is limited and you can feel a draft on colder days. Steaks I've been to Carmichael's a few times, and with one exception, my steak has been cooked to perfection every time. I usually order the full portion bone in rib-eye, while my girl orders the filet. The garlic butter crust is simple but delicious, providing extra flavor. the last time I was there, my girl (admittedly a filet snob) made a point of showing me the inside of her steak and saying it was cooked perfectly.  This is why you go to steakhouses.  That, and a chance to wear fancy clothes. Sides The creamed spinach is cooked with chopped bacon, and the bacon flavor tends to dominate this dish. I like that, but if you like your creamed spinach more traditional, this may not be for you. In my opinion it's delicious. The garlic mashed potatoes we had were dry. Maybe it was an off day, but they were in serious need of some moisture. I took these home, and once I added some butter and milk to them, they were fine.  For what you pay at Carmichael's, you probably shouldn't have to do that. The baked potato is pretty standard, though they give you real bacon to sprinkle on top of the potato (a plus in my book).  I always feel wierd paying for food I can easily make myself, so I won't order this too often. The sweet potato mash is very sweet. I'm a big fan of sweet potatoes, but these were a little much for me.  I still happily ate a bunch of it, but it was too sweet for my date, so if you're sensitive to sweeter dishes, beware. Conclusion Carmichael's is pricey, and the sides could use a little work.  The steaks are wonderfully done, and the service is good.  I can't afford to go all the time, but I will return.",0.9984,0.766,0.212,0.021,0.57765873015873

Something like a ""nieker"" something ....was more like a hamburger steak . Yes I agree with the reviews of the French onion ... Pretty good but very cheesy, it's more enjoyable to get experience the broth. I was the last one eating due to the fact I had to return my lamb, table was cleared entirely and I was left with my plate of lamb and cold vegetables.

Probably the best glass of ice tea I have had. They also give you great bread to start off with a nice cheddar spread. The cheddar spread was a perfect match to the bread.

2013-02-04,4.0,"The great thing about steakhouses in Chicago is it's nearly impossible to find a bad one.  The city is synonymous with steak, and if you don't have the chops (pardon the pun), you're not going to last long here. So of course Carmichael's delivers!  My Chicago-cut ribeye was a beautiful steak, and easily one of the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly cooked with a nice char and a healthy (read: unhealthy) dose of garlic butter.  It was of course nearly as big as my face, and despite this fact, I got the whole thing down.  Every time I sat back and thought, ""I can't possibly eat another bite,"" I would pause.  And then the thought of just how good that steak was would return, and I'd think ""well, maybe just ONE MORE bite."" I just-one-more-bite-ed until the plate was clean. Beyond the to-die-for steak, the brussels sprouts were fantastic.  I generally like my sprouts sauteed and still with a good tooth to them, but these roasted beauties were nutty and delicious, and tender without being mushy.  Somehow, their tenderness seemed to give them a formality that fit the gravity of the meal.  I was pleased. The creamed spinach was also good, and the pretzel bread with pub cheese that came with our drinks?  Well, let's just say that it took constantly reminding myself of the slab of beef about to be delivered to keep from filling up on bread and cheddar. The only real letdown for me was the French Onion Soup.  For most I suppose, the glory of FOS is the gooey cheese melted over toasted bread, and the soup is really just an excuse for that indulgence.  However, I'm a big fan of the soup, with or without the crouton, and if I can't taste a beautiful beef stock and a giant red wine cooked together with those onions, I'm going to be disappointed.  And yes, I was. Beyond the food, this is a classic steakhouse.  Dark woods, big booths, attentive service.  Just what you'd expect, but perhaps a bit newer.  It looks like they updated the place recently.",0.9962,0.793,0.19,0.017,0.5421717171717172

My boyfriend and I were easily seated 15 minutes early for our 15 minute reservation on a Tuesday night.  The bar in the front of the restaurant still had some post work happy hour patrons while the dining area was faily empty.  Similar to other reviewers, the bread served cold was a little annoying, and the crackers are the same crackers that we buy from the grocery store for $3 a box.  The ""cheese butter"" tasted suspiciously identical to Cheez Whiz, but as someone who loved Cheez Whiz as a child, I didn't mind this trip back to 3rd grade. The menu is pretty standard for any of the steakhouses you'll see in Chicago.  A nice selection of steak cuts, a few seafood options, a few salad options, a couple chicken dishes, some sides, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they always have a special features section of the menu that is not online that includes additional non-steak entrees and special sides.  I had bought a Gilt City coupon since my boyfriend likes a good steakhouse once in a while and the restaurant is only 3 blocks from my building.  But after viewing the online menu, I was pretty much stuck to choosing between the standard tilapia, salmon, and ahi tuna options for seafood.  How lovely it was to see a pan seared halibut option on the specials, along with a few other choices that sounded much more appealing than any of the standard dishes.  Our waiter confirmed the suspicion by saying that the halibut was hands down the best seafood option at the restaurant and the others didn't even come close.  My boyfriend went with the bone-in special of the night which was a 16 oz. filet mignon piece with the bone-in.  It was an especially thick cut, so he ordered it medium well with the expectation that the end result would actually be more like medium rare/medium.  He was right.  The steak was cooked well and he enjoyed it.  Not the most amazing steak he'd ever had in his life, but definitely delicious. My 10 oz. halibut came pan seared in a white wine sauce with spinach and tomatoes.  The sauce was fantastic - perfect blend of wine and garlic and complimented the fish nicely.  The halibut was a huge 10 oz. cut and was very good but just the tiniest bit overcooked.  I ate the middle pieces of the fish but left the tougher ends and ended up eating every bit of the spinach and tomatoes soaked in the delicious sauce. For sides we went with the au gratin potatoes and Tabasco fried onion strings.  The onion strings were about the same as Aussie strings at the Outback and I did not taste any type of Tabasco spice whatsoever.  The potatoes were better and more up to par with the type of side you would expect from a steakhouse.  My boyfriend was distraught that there was no mac n cheese side option, as steakhouses make the best mac n cheese. All in all, it was a nice evening.  The portions are huge, service is friendly and quick.  But if you're looking for a nice night out and a nice steakhouse, I think Chicago has better options out there for the same price range.  I'm glad we went, but I doubt we will return with all the other fish in the Chicago sea of restaurants.",0.9992,0.724,0.224,0.052,0.574054834054834

After looking at the menu for at least 15 minutes I probably could have recited it to her... We ordered everything all at once hoping that we would receive our food in a more timely fashion.  For starters we tried the Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls and the Mussels that were on special.  About 15 minutes later the waitress came back to tell us our apps would be out in a moment.  At this time we had to ask her for bread, which would have been nice 30 minutes earlier because at this point we were VERY hungry.   The appetizers finally came out and unfortunately my mussels were VERY cold.  I was so hungry I was not about to ask them to take them back.  The buffalo chicken egg rolls were hot... I wonder if they had forgotten about the egg rolls since it had been another 10 minutes to receive our food after she told us they were on their way.  We finished the apps, waited another 20 minutes, and our food was sent out.  In total we had been at Carmichaels for about an hour and 30 minutes before we were served our entrees.  My boyfriend had a KC NY Strip and I had the Manhattan Filet with a horseradish crust.  We both ordered our meat medium rare and both of our steaks were so tough to cut that they were unpleasant.  My piece of meat was so salty that I could only eat a few bites.

A gentleman (who I believe was the General Manager) stopped by our table and asked if we wanted to put an appetizer in. We did order the Lobster Tempura which was pretty good. When our server did make it to our table, he basically told us the specials were inside the menu and asked if we had any questions. I am sorry, but at a nice restaurant a good server would take the time to go through the specials or provide recommendations instead of just telling us where they can be found. Our server was completely unpersonable. We barely had any interaction with him. I ordered a beer and when he brought it to the table, he just dropped it off with a glass. I would expect the server to pour it into the glass for me (I am not a snob, but at a nicer restaurant, you have higher expectations).  I ordered the sally cut filet mignon - medium.

Have they never used a Groupon before? The service Grouponers got is probably because they don't know you are supposed to tip on the entire bill as well. So maybe they have a stigma attached to Grouponers.  Anyways, don't listen to them. I came back again because I really like this place. Maybe because it is in my neighborhood. But I just love its look and feel. It's not the best steakhouse but it is good nonetheless. I had a filet again and our server was very friendly.

She's the only slight complaint that I may have. She seemed to have an attitude but certainly wasn't rude. Wish I had gotten her name.

We thought that $18 was a great price for 6 small lobster tails. They were larger than we expected. We were pleasantly surprised. There's always a lot of breading in tempura, but still a good amount of food and for only $3 a piece for lobster, it's a deal. I had crab legs. I loved the fact that they had sliced them in half making it so much easier to eat. There was a small bowl of butter to dip it in and it was sitting on some sauce with garlic in it. Also very good. My partner had some kind of steak. He loved it and took some home as leftovers.  The sides we had were the smashed sweet potatoes and cream spinach. Both delicious.  We had no room for dessert when it came, but it looked delicious also. No small portions. Someone complained about being taxed on the entire amount. That's the way that it works with Groupon. Some places don't do it that way, but that's how it's supposed to be. We had a great dinner and only ran $5 over the Groupon price. With tax our bill was $18 + tip.

Nothing could be further from the truth. And so it is, with dining companion Rhondie's Groupon in hand, off we went to the land of big ass steaks, Tabasco fried onion strings and gigantic jumbo shrimp. Appetizer:  well, I am all about good onion rings/strings, fried shoelaces, you name it, so I was excited to try the Tabasco fried ones. We decided to go for the BBQ shrimp and onion combo: six huge bbq bacon-wrapped jumbo shrimp on top of a bed of the onion strings. Great appetizer but don't get too excited about the Tabasco aspect - I simply could not detect it whatsoever. Steaks: a fabulous variety of options here not only in types of cuts but size of each particular cut. We both opted for the bone-in ribeye (""aged a minimum of 28 days""), Rhondie getting the 20 oz full cut while I ordered the medium cut. I have to say these steaks were delicious, juicy as can be and cooked to perfection - a rarity nowadays as my ""medium"" request is usually ignored at most steakhouses and the meat a veritable bloodbath upon presentation at my table. Thank you for knowing what medium is! Two sides: garlic mashed potatoes that were creamy and tasty; the Brussel sprouts were grilled with garlic and olive oil & packed a crunch. Just scrumptious! Dessert: a delectable coconut and pineapple layer cake with creamy frosting served with super strong Lavazza coffee. Ahhh.....

While waiting on our appetizer, we discovered a bug on our plate. We told the manager. She took the plate away without an apology or any real surprise. We thought that was very odd, she acted like it just happened all the time. Had it been a roach we would have left, but since it was just a small garden bug and we were near the door to the patio, we decided to stay.  That was a mistake. The food was terrible. The lobster tempura had no real flavor and was more breading than lobster. The steaks were extremely salty and came with au jus that just tasted like bouillon. It was extremely disappointing because you could tell it was good meat but they put so much salt/au jus on it that all you could taste was bouillon. The sides were pretty bland - creamed spinach that only tasted like bacon when you hit a piece and sweet potatoes that were okay.  The service was slow and we had to ask for refills on our water. The busboy said ""oh yeah...sorry"" like he forgot that you should refill water glasses. The place was dead on a Friday at 8 pm. Not sure how they stay open with this terrible food, service and lack of patronage.  Oh and when we got our bill, we were taxed on the full amount. So our total bill was $12.79 for taxes and $16 for drinks. Since it was a small amount of money and we just wanted to leave, we paid it but I plan on informing Groupon and never returning.

The only thing is, that it seemed as though the people dressed in suits were treated with more attention. I dress up for work, so I like to dial it down for a relaxing dinner. The service wasn't bad, it just didn't seem up to par for those dressed down, to that of the service of the suit-wearing patrons.

2011-06-27,3.0,"Damnit, Groupon, you did it again. We got an amazing deal on Groupon and decided to check this place out. From what I know it's been around for a long time, so that's very promising.  The place is super old school steakhouse style. (At any point, I was waiting for a mob hit to happen.) The space is huge and has a nice patio and even a little garden area with a gazebo. As far as atmosphere, it was very romantic.  Our waiter was nice enough, although, my only complaint was that he was no where in sight when I needed him (e.g., when I dropped my steak knife on the ground and ended up sharing with my boyfriends knife). So if our waiter would have been more attentive, I think I could have easily given the place a 4 star review. They start you off with a bread basket of cold rolls and lavash flatbreads and a cheese dip of sorts. It was ok. I definitely prefer the bread basket at the Palm. We started off the meal with Oysters Rockefeller, which were very tasty. Their version has bacon, spinach and hollendaise. I like that the bacon wasn't overwhelming like it can be at some places. The oysters were nice and juicy. I think it could have been a little hotter, but it wasn't too bad of a temperature. I think I could have used just a tad bit more hollendaise to make it a bit juicier. But overall they were B+ Oysters Rockefeller. For our mains, we tried their specials. I chose the KC Strip which was dry aged. It was delicious, tender and tasty, not to mention plentiful. I took half of it home! My boyfriend had the bone-in filet and that was a huge piece as well! Also very tasty. For our sides, we tried the scalloped potatoes and creamed spinach. The potatoes were nice and cheesy but I think it could have used a bit more cream as I like my scalloped potatoes creamier. The Creamed Spinach was really good though! It's a good option for a good steak in Chicago. I don't frequent steakhouses to often but my boyfriend rated it at a 3 on his list, so that's not so bad.

2011-06-21,2.0,"My boyfriend and I came here because of the Groupon deal. It felt like as soon as we mentioned the Groupon the service went downhill. Overall the service is poor and the food is mediocre. Probably would never come here again. I'd rather pay a little more and go somewhere else. Here is our journey... First when we asked for the wine menu our waiter kind of threw it on the opposite corner of the table and immediately walked away. Would it have been so hard for him to just hand it to one of us?  We started off with Crab Cakes. They were jumbo like it says in the description. The cakes weren't overly stuffed with breading and other stuff to makes you feel like you've been cheated. The apple slaw was a nice touch to the cakes. My only complaint would be in some bites it felt like I was chewing on small pieces of crab shells. Oh and they gave us tongs for the crab cakes. I would think they would know better and realize that with a delicate dish like Crab Cakes... tongs will break the cake and most of it will be on the table while you try to bring it to your plate. Just scoop it with your fork instead.  For our main dishes, I ordered the Filet Mignon - Gentlemen's cut (12oz) cooked medium and my boyfriend ordered the Chicago Cut - Full cut (20oz) cooked medium rare. The Filet Mignon was cooked beautifully, very tender, and juicy. But it was on the salty side and too charred. The Chicago Cut just tasted like a man's steak (that was the first thought that came to my mind when I tasted it). It was tender but not as much as a Filet and well seasoned. But it was too fatty. There were a lot of little chunks of fat throughout the meat... big enough that you had to cut them out.  For our sides we ordered Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Tabasco Fried Onion Rings. They were both ok. The Tabasco fried onion rings weren't special at all. They weren't spicy like I thought they would be and didn't even taste like any Tabasco went into the dish. Once again the waiter put our sides on the opposite corner and left so fast we had to place them in front of us. Is it so hard to say ""pardon my reach"" and place our dishes in front of us? The restaurant wasn't full so I didn't understand his rush and need to ""throw"" everything onto the table. After we finished our meal our waiter was no where to be found. I looked around the restaurant and didn't see him anywhere. We waited about 15-20 minutes before he showed up (the juices on our plates were drying up and started to look fatty).  Our waiter finally brings out the dessert tray and there's not a lot of variety. Its all cakes and a one cookie dish. We wanted something light after all the meat we ate so we went with the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. It was nothing special. Just a huge chocolate chip cookie, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. and chocolate syrup drizzled over it. Not worth $10. Making the same dessert at home with store bought cookie dough tastes better.",0.9014,0.868,0.079,0.053,0.4808416389811739

We called to ask them if they could accommodate us a half an hour earlier. When we called they said we did not have a reservation, but we could make the reservation for 6:30 pm- so it worked out okay.  When we arrived we were promptly seated and our busboy brought us water. The waiter was almost nonexistent most of the night. He never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Considering it was my birthday, I totally would have gotten at least one martini.  We had the sweet and sour calamari which was an interesting twist. I ordered a filet mignon and we ordered two sides mashed sweet potatoes and creamed spinach. I was not very impressed by either side. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out with barely any pink and it was a cooked pink. By this point, I was hungry so I didn't care. I also noticed the table next to us sent back their steaks because they were overcooked as well. It would have been a good steak if they had cooked it the way I wanted it.  I was also a little disappointed that they did not even say Happy Birthday to me let alone give us a dessert like most restaurants do. My sister mentioned it was my birthday when she called and my mom also commented to the server that it was my birthday, so I know they knew.  Our waiter took forever for everything. Even getting the bill from him became a chore. He didn't ask us if we wanted a to go box and even after we asked he just kind of plopped them on the table.

It was awful! It was so salty and full of fat. It was a shame because in between the abundance of fat were excellent pieces of perfectly timed medium-done steak. But it was so damn salty. A great steak doesn't need all that salt. I would have sent it back but in the middle of my steak my boyfriend proposed. So we're using the steak as a left over and adding to some rice for dinner tonight. The potatoes au gratin were gross. Plain and simple. The flavor reminded me of stuffing. I can't describe the flavor, it's between bacony and something else, but it wasn't bacon. The bread rolls were cold. I ate one out of desperation because I was so hungry. The cheese spread for the bread was awesome, so I slathered it on my roll. The appetizer was the best part of the meal, but even that was overwhelming with salt and grease. We got the chicken wing eggroll thing. Even my bf, who loves junk food said after 2 it was just too much.  In celebration of our engagement we also got dessert.

It started off with a good idea.  Lobster tempura!  Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not fantastic.  A little on the greasy side in fact. Then the steaks.  I had the porterhouse.  Very good, especially the filet side, tender and all.  I ordered it with the blue cheese topping, which was also good.  My partner had the strip and he said it was pretty fatty, and the horseradish topping was not as strong as it could have been -- so basically it was just cream on top.  Meh. We had the asparagus and the creamed spinach as sides.  Bonus points for all the good bacon in the creamed spinach, one of the better recipes I've tasted, and the asparagus was good too, but nothing to write home about. We paid extra for drinks -- I had the Austin Mule -- weak, too sweet and just yucky honestly.  I didn't order dessert, but they do get extra points for shipping apple pies in a brown bag from Wisconsin.  Those are delicious. So, overall, with the Groupon plus drinks plus tip, it still came out to $50!  Next time I'll save my money for either for the better ambiance of Morton's or I'll make a steak at home.",0.9949,0.701,0.231,0.068,0.5465104166666667

Mistake! Luckily we were running late so by the time we got there the crowds were already at the game. Thank God.  The venue was really nice and intimate (minus the couple arguing in the booth behind us for about 30 minutes - leave your drama at home please). The staff was really friendly and they greeted and seated us immediately.  We started with the buffalo chicken spring rolls. I thought they were great. They came with a side of blue cheese celery and carrots. For the main course - I went with the Sally's cut fillet with a side of sauteed spinach and my boyfriend had the full Chicago cut (which he felt had a little too much fat on it) with a side of mashed sweet potatoes. I thought my steak was delicious however there was way too much olive oil in the spinach. The sweet potatoes made up for the spinach for sure - can you say sugary buttery goodness! The food was average at best. Our waiter was a little inattentive. He asked us if we wanted another glass of wine after giving us the check. Ummmm...no. I've already got my mind set on leaving but thanks! Had you asked me 10 minutes ago I might have taken you up on that offer. However I realize we came in really late and he was trying to probably get home so as a former waitress in the restaurant industry I UNDERSTAND! Just an observation.  The menu is moderately priced so that's definitely a plus and the location is great (it's a few blocks away from my house and they have parking so ideal whether on foot or by car)  This place didn't WOW me.

We knew (it was clearly stated on the voucher) that it didn't include alcohol, nor dessert. It also clearly stated that the voucher could be used for ""any combination of appetizers, entrees and sides"". We started to order our dinner and we mentioned to the server that we had this voucher.

Granted, it's not a cheap place, but it's really hard to spend $120 on that, in fact we were only able to get to about $95. She apologized and asked if we'd like to speak with the manager. Of course we did...it was clearly not our fault that they made this error, and I expected them to honor what we had purchased. The manager, Liz (I think), came over and immediately said, ""I apologize, but this is incorrect, our offer is for only 1 app, 2 entrees and 2 sides. That is our standard ""deal"". I asked her to read the wording on the printed voucher, ""...any combination of apps, entrees and sides"". I asked, ""can you show me where it limits the number of each? or where it says, dinner-for-two (which is another thing she kept repeating)?"" She couldn't (of course, because it wasn't there) and she just kept reading the same, ""any combination, etc."" and saying that what it meant was ""dinner-for-two"".

The steaks are usually excellent but they can be kind of hit or miss... and for upwards of $35 a steak, you really can't afford to miss.  I've had some seriously tender, succulent, excellent steaks here, and I've also had some gristly, tough, over- or under-cooked ones.  The appetizers are almost always excellent - try the calamari for sure. My wife drinks and reports the same type of inconsistency that you get with the steaks... sometimes they're butt-kickers and sometimes watery.   I would say the same with the service... I've had ridiculously polite and helpful service with some staff, and I've seen other staff handle another guest's baby, then walk directly over to the kitchen and bring my food out - unacceptable.  I mean, it was cute, clearly the server knew the couple and it's a neighborhood establishment, but for god's sake, make a show of washing your hands after you handle a baby if you're serving food. When sitting outside, I also saw a guest permitted to bring their dog to the restaurant and sit on the patio.  Not OK... even less OK is the server petting the dog, especially since I hadn't ordered yet... ugh. That said, I've had dinner here on New Year's Eve... brought close friends and had wonderful, fun meals here... celebrated the closing of my property with dinner here... so some really great times too, - I keep coming back, and will keep coming back for the hits - and I'll try to forget the misses as quick as I can.

We were given a token for one free drink in the lounge area pre-tasting, adn were offered soem pretty tasing appetizers(aloongside the usual cheese and cracker assortments). My wife had the Jonnnie red label/ginger soda combo(and loved it), and I had the Black Label on the Rocks. After a bit of socializing, it was announed that it was tiem to begin the tasting.  After a lil video intro by Robert Carlisle, we get a chance to sample not only the more common black and red label varieties, but also the green, gold, and the kick ass blue label whiskeys. The venue staff(aided by the Walker traveling crew) did an excellent job teaching us about the history of the brand and how they go about making this great stuff. The rental space is HUGE.

When we drove down here, we were surprised to find a steakhouse in what seemed to be a very residential neighborhood The interior was a little larger than I had imagined from the outside and the inside seemed to be a pretty typical steak house - nothing too out of the ordinary, and at the same time, nothing that made it unique or stand out. Service: Our server, Courtney, was very nice! Had great knowledge of the menu and was able to suggest little things here and there when we asked. Checked in on us several times and got us what we needed when we needed it! Food: Started with some Oysters, which I have to say was very delicious! I forgot what my GF ordered, but I order a Chicago Cut medium rare, and instead they brought me a Porterhouse. I'm a fan of Porterhouse, so I didn't bother sending it back. Courtney was very insistent on me getting the other the cut. The Porterhouse wasn't bad. I would have preferred it a little more red, because it seemed to have been a little more towards the medium than medium rare. Other than that, the food was great! Price & Portion: The price was reasonable and the sizes of the steaks were more than enough to leave me with a doggy bag. I have been to several other steak houses and I have never taken home as much as I did when I ate here at Carmichaels. Overall: Definitely going to be coming back sometime in the near future and I hope they leave a little more red in my steak. 4 stars! Semi-boom",0.9829,0.848,0.122,0.03,0.44942129629629624

I have driven down this stretch of Monroe countless times never noticing this place so when a friend suggested it as a United Center event pre dinner, I had to pause and think about where this was.  And then, once I got there the food and the service were quite good.  I arrived early to grab a martini at the bar. The bar was quite nice. Appointed with wood and a curved bar area, the bartender was quick to welcome me, and the patrons were also fun to talk to. And my dirty martini was perfectly poured.  Our full group arrived and we were seated in one of the big curved booths in the dining room. We told our server that we were on a time constraint and he was fine with that and moved us through quickly but not so much that we felt like we were in a rush.  We ordered some oysters to begin with that were quite good. Next up- the steaks. My NY strip, as well as the other 3 steaks (rib eye, filet and another NY strip) on the table were perfectly prepared and the baked potato side that I ordered must have been on ""steroids"" as it was huge! We also ordered some mushrooms, au gratin potatoes and spinach as additional sides and they too were quite good. Know that like other steak houses in town- the sides are meant to be shared.  We did have to ask them to ""tone down"" one of the spot lights that was shining on our booth. When we first were seated- I thought I was up on stage or being interrogated with this bright light shining in my eyes. But one mention to our server had that light dimmed and the evening moved on seamlessly.  If you drive- valet parking is available or you may be able to find street parking as well.

I remembered back in my college days that steak in chi-town was good, but didn't remember where I used to get it.  Got here at night, and it was quiet probably because it was sunday so I was thinking, ""awesome, special attention to my food orders"". Ordered french onion soup, the rib-eye, the porterhouse and spinach as a side. Onion soup was 1/3 gruyere cheese which clumped up all over the spoon so I couldn't ladle soup. Gruyere was not so hot, but the soup itself was good. The rib-eye was aged well, with a good marble. The porterhouse on one side was a little dry and overall not very flavorful. Both were realllllly salted. The spinach was good, but also reallllllly salty. We made use of our waters and wine we ordered. At $37 and $39 a steak, it was too pricy for the kind of steak and steak treatment we got. I've read other yelpers reviews and it seems people like the non-steak food better, so I would not recommend getting steak here. The only memorable thing of the experience was our $127 total + $25 tip.

It has a warm and inviting feel to it, an old school Chicago steakhouse kind of feeling, with warm table seatings, big circular booths, nice lighting, and warm woods. It just looks like a Chicago steakhouse. Love the atmosphere. The thing I like about it is that you could dress up casually or for a night out on the town, and fit in either way. They have spacious outdoor patio area open during the warmer months and it is very nice also. The food is delicious and is what you would expect from a Chicago steakhouse, but even better! We decided on a steamed mussels appetizer, with a light sauce, and they were fresh and a light way to start off our meal. I had the Sally's Cut Filet Mignon with the Al Forno splash. Absolute heaven. It melted in my mouth and was cooked a perfect medium rare. My dining companion got the Scallops, albeit deciding between a steak based meal and seafood. He loved the Scallops but was a little envious of my steak choice, as I saw him jealousy peering at my plate throughout the night. The wine list was decent and our server (Carolyn?) was really great.

He knows what people want. He gives personal attention to all that he does. And he makes it a point to take care of the regulars and new guests alike. The setting of this place is unreal. You don't feel like you're downtown with the beautiful landscaped patio, gazebo and skyline views. The patio is huge and hosts many special events. You can see why it's so special. Don't forget free valet and plentiful street parking. And the shuttle to United Center just rocks. Yes. The menu is a little pricey for lunch. But as far as dinner goes, it's market steak house prices-but still cheaper than Gibsons or Chop House without the attitude. The service is good. Many of the servers have been there several years which is nice. My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar with a friend, split a steak, salad and appetizer. Plenty to share and the bar atmosphere is comfortable. You'll feel like ""Norm or Cliff"" in no time. Make sure you visit Brian at the bar. He'll give you personal attention with a little friendly banter-just what you want from a neighborhood bar.

2008-07-13,4.0,"This place is very nice but definitely pricey.  My BF and his mom had tickets to watch Cirque de solel at the United center this past Saturday.  We wanted to go to a steakhouse that was close to our place and the United Center so we can just head over to the event right after dinner.  We did some researching and found Carmichael's on-line which had great reviews so we decided to go.   When we got there we noticed that they have a free shuttle bus to take you to United Center events. This was a major plus b/c it was a free ride and you did not have to deal with the traffic. I highly recommend this place if you are going to the United Center.  There was a beautiful wedding reception taking place outside while we were there. As we were admiring the decor, we saw Jeff Garland drinking and mingling at the wedding reception.  We were star struck the whole time. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the food there and was very friendly.  We had mussels as an appetizer that were cooked with white wine, garlic and butter. VERY scrumptious! Then we had different types of bread to dip in the mussel sauce. For our main course I had the pan seared Hali bet with grilled asparagus in lemon butter sauce.  I have to say that was one of the best fish I have every tasted.  It was very very good but also very very expensive. It has a very thin crust on the top of it because it was seared and it was moist and soft. For dessert we all split a creme brulee.   We also agreed at the dinner table that was one of the best creme brulee's we have ever had. Perfect sugar top and delicious creme inside.  Melts in your mouth!

The Hubby had Manhattan Filet. We were each so busy devouring our food, we forget to take a bite of each other's entree, which is a testament to how good the steaks were. Our table shared three different sides: 1. whipped garlic mashed potatoes - my least favorite of the sides; very garlicky, but too dense in texture to qualify as ""whipped"" IMO 2. mashed sweet potatoes - simply delish; sweet but not overly so, creamy & comforting 3. steamed asparagus - just the right amount of flavor to let the vegetable shine through Our friend's Cobb Salad was ginormous.  The side Caesar salad was good but over-dressed.  They make their drinks stiff - you definitely get your money's worth for the food and the drinks here.

2007-10-09,5.0,"I have been going to Carmichaels for about three years and have never had a bad experience. It is located right down the path from my house so very convenient. If you do drive valet parking is free (minus tip you cheap ass) but you can usually park on the street for free. Carmichaels is located in the heart of the west loop neighborhood, surrounded by beautiful condo/lofts on a tree lined street. You can  sit and enjoy dinner either inside or out, and take in the gorgeous Chicago skyline which adds to the experience. On an average weeknight you should have no issue walking in and getting a table as it really is a neighborhood place. Because of the close proximity to the United Center they offer free shuttle service to and from the Bulls games if you dine there beforehand. That being said game nights you are better off making a reservation. I did get caught dropping in on a game night without thinking about it but the hostess was able to squeeze me in after someone didn't arrive on time. Food is excellent. I usually have the same old, same old- salad wedge with ranch dressing, and a steak. The steaks are the selling point because they are thick, served bloody if you ask, and done just right. They allow you to ""add a crust"" which is nothing more than a baked on topping. I usually get the herb and butter but they offer a variety and it certainly adds a unique flavor. My ma usually orders a burger and she swears by it. The portions are rather large so I recommend sharing a plate if you are a light eater. For those that are heavy eaters they offer a 40oz steak called ""The Big Shoulders"". If you are able to tackle this display of ultimate gluttony you are awarded a spot on the wall of achievement much like John Candy in ""The Great Outdoors"" where he eats the monster steak. I even like the bread basket they bring when you first sit down. It is chock full of different breads and crackers with delicious cheeses and butter sauces. The service has always been good for me and the wait staff dress in collards dress shirts and suspenders. This is indeed a table cloth kind of place. That doesn't mean that you have to dress formal as last night I actually saw a guy in jeans and a t-shirt,  but you will feel more comfortable in a sport jacket and slacks. Prices are expensive but you are paying for the quality of food, service, and beautiful loft like interior. There is a nice bar in the front I enjoy once in a while but nothing special. The drink prices are consistent with any upscale restaurant. They have a nice wine selection which you can see the bottles housed in there very own wine room toward the back with the open kitchen.
