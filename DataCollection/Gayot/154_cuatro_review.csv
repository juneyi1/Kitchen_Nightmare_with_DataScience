Still, managed to have a good time since the food was great.  We started out with the cerviche...odd, as it was a salmon cerviche; normally, I'm accustomed to whitefish.  Was fresh and visually pleasing, though could have used more lime.  For entrees, we got the moqueca do mar and the short ribs.  The moqueca was awesome, tasting like a very nice seafood stew with a broth and consistency similar to something of a paella made of liquid (not sure that makes sense, but it was just great).  The short ribs were literally fall off the bone...the large bone was mainly for decoration, but i enjoyed its presence for me to pretend to gnaw on a giant bone.

I quickly realized that it doubled as a club because when you walk in, it sorta looks like one with a bar that almost spans the entire room and music pumping all around you. We were escorted to a quieter bar in the back where we had delicious blood orange margaritas and mojitos to whet our appetites.  My friend and I were in the mood to sample everything: from appetizers to dessert. We started with the Crab & Goat Cheese Empanadas and Yucca Fries, both of which were tasty and boded well for what was to come. For dinner, we opted for the ribeye and the short ribs, both of which were falling off the bone tender and delicious! The tres leches cake for dessert was good but even better was the after-dinner drink that the waiter suggested called Patron XO, a tequila and coffee infusion that neither of us will soon forget. Who knew that pairing would work? It nearly overshadowed the dessert.  The atmosphere is fun, the food is great, and we left with smiles on our faces.

Seriously, the only times I've ever eaten here have been for the Bossa Nova brunches on Sundays. I always order the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs and sometimes I get the adobado chicken if I'm really  hungry. The chilaquiles are perfect, I wouldn't change a single thing. I also usually order a bottle of Sidral Mundet apple soda, it just completes the meal. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is tangy and tasty, but I still prefer the apple-soda. I was definitely in the mood for dessert (yes, at brunch) on Valentines Day and my boyfriend and I ordered the crepas de guineitos. We were speechless, we weren't sure what to expect but what came out was fantastic! The crepes are filled with baby bananas and the sauce that they lay in is so sweet but not overpowering. Also, it comes with a scoop of prailine ice cream that they make themselves.  Cuatro has a wonderful staff and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated.

2010-01-11,5.0,"Three words: Bossa Nova Brunch. Never been here for anything else, but the few times I've gotten myself down to Cuatro for their outstanding Bossa Nova Brunch have been absolutely magical. The first time, I pretty much just randomly picked it out of a list on Metromix (ouch! sorry Yelp...) because my sister's fiance's parents were in town from Italy and we wanted to do something special on their final morning in the city. The description--live bossa nova band plays while you munch on tasty south american cuisine--intrigued me, and away we went. Holy moley, was that freakin' awesome or what?! We had a large party (not too big, but there were 6 of us), which ended up working in our favor for a change--one of the biggest booths is right up front, near the band, and mostly separated from the rest of the place. This was excellent, as we had a fantastic view of the band (which kicked ass in every way; mellow but impressive, authentic but not contrived) and sort of felt like we had the place to ourselves, as well. In short, the atmosphere was great, and sold me immediately. (It's quite tastefully decorated inside, too, by the way) On to the food. WOWZERS! I'm a HUGE chilaquiles fan, so imagine my salivating delight at seeing them on the menu... served with PRIME RIB. Hellz yeah! I also got bites of the phenomenal French toast, the crab cakes benedict (what?! yeah, that's right), huevos rancheros and an omelet. Even the potatoes, normally a standard side, were amazingly tasty. And the drinks--yum, yum. My girlfriend got the forbidden fruit sangria (excellent) and we all had coffee (delicious, rich).  The best part of Bossa Nova Brunch is that the prices are right in line with what you should expect for brunch in Chicago... but the food is a couple of notches above. Throw in the lovely live music and you've got one of the most hidden brunch gems in the city.",0.9978,0.76,0.215,0.025,0.5826267905536198

We ordered two cups of coffee and waited for our table.  The coffee was extremely good, I usually like my coffee strong and this one was full of flavor.  :) We waited about 15 minutes and then were sat in a cozy booth for about 5 people but since there were only 2 of us, we got to stretch out.  Immediately, we had a waitress who refilled our coffee and gave us menus.  Yum, I was starving. Ordered the pork empanadas as an appetizer and it was great. I don't usually like minced meat but it was pretty good.  Next, I had some huevos rancheros, (say that 5 times fast), which came on a sope instead of a tortilla, I liked that they switched it up like that.  If you know me well, you know I'd kill for sopes and empanadas.  I also ate most of my dining companion's chilaquiles, which I have to say.... are better than El Milagros!

My wife and I went here on a Wednesday for a little date night.  We wanted to keep the tab low, so we split an entree, and ordered 2 sets of empanadas (they were half price) and a carribean salad. The salad was very fresh and light tasting, and the flavors of the fruit, dressing, and vegetables blended perfectly.  The pork empanadas were good (and at $4 for 2 they were a steal).  However, the crab empanadas completely stole the show.  Nestled in a spicy cilantro avocado sauce, they combined delicious flavor and wonderful texture of the wrapper.  Anyone who goes here needs to order that crab empanada. For the entree, we split the stuffed trout.  Let me tell you, the portions here are huge, and splitting was more than enough.  And I eat big.  The trout was flavorful, and had an excellent crispy skin, and tender meat inside.  We both liked it, but felt that it was missing a little something.  Not sure what. Had the batata cake (sweet potato cake with mango), and it was divine.   Caiparinhas (sp?) were half off.  They were big drinks, and plenty tasty, but I think they were a little light on the booze.  I had 2 and didn't feel very buzzed.  But they were very tasty, and half price on Wednesdays.   Service was great.  Our server was very attentive, very knowlegeable about the menu, and extremely nice (in a genuine way).   We will be back even though we are out of towners!",0.9828,0.849,0.135,0.016,0.5584967320261438

We went at 9pm on a Saturday night. I felt like something was a little off as soon as I got into the place. Firstly the air conditioning wasn't doing a great job cooling the place down. Our waiter seemed a little sloppy and rushed. The lights were a bit too bright and the music too soft, however, about 30 minutes later the lights dimmed and the music was turned up a bit. I was surprised to see how expensive the drinks were. My drink was definitely not worth $13. We found it a bit odd that 30% of the menu was steaks, not flank steaks or skirt steaks. It just didn't seem that Latin influenced. We also ordered the pork empanadas which were very yummy. For the entrees we got the short ribs which came on a huge bone with some tomatillo salsa which I didn't like and some rice. The short rib itself was moist and flavorful. We also go the seafood stew in a coconut broth. The mussels were not fresh and way over cooked. There was unfortunately only one scallop which was very good. The shrimp were plump and delicious. The huge stuffed calamari was a little over cooked and the stuffing was under seasoned.  The waiter only came around briefly and there was a lot of time spent waiting.

Let's start with the service.  My friend chose Cuatro for her birthday celebration.  I made a reservation for 6 people at 8:00pm.  The hostess was great about letting three of us sit down when the rest of our party was running late.  And when our party expanded to 9 people, they were very accommodating and pulled another table over for us, despite the busy evening.  Thank you friendly hostess! Now the drinks.  Everyone knows I love a good cocktail, but I had no idea what I was in for when I ordered my Bombay Sapphire martini.  It was seriously the biggest martini I've ever consumed.  Literally overflowing and mixed perfectly.  Yummy.  I thought that might be the end of my drinking, but I couldn't pass up the Fresca Margarita with muddled cucumber and orange.  Again, delightfully strong and fresh.  Delicious.  But I couldn't stop there.  I had to try the Caipirinha.  Perfectly made, and again, strong.  Drinks are $13, but you certainly get your money's worth.  We were there for 5 hours and I had to cut myself off after the third drink.  Way to go Cuatro! The food.  I'd heard that the pinchos de pollo are spicy, but I never believe it 'til I taste it.  I was certainly hoping they were because I never order chicken in a restaurant.  Never.  Well these pinchos de pollo did not disappoint.  Really spicy, and I mean it.  Delicious and great with the peas and rice and plantains. The night we were there they had a DJ playing until 2am.  Packed crowd and good music.  Perfect night for the birthday girl, and I managed to make it out of there for about $60, and that included pitching in for my friend.  Hooray!",0.9986,0.678,0.298,0.024,0.6161970899470899

The dance floor is small considering the crowd it draws on the weekends...so big that valet was actually at full capacity. The interior is also very simple and of course resembles a restaurant more than a club. The highlight of this place is its award winning live band house music. I visited Cuatro when Madd Soul was performing and that one visit exposed me to music where you can't help but nod your head at the least. All the music was improvisation and everyone was dancing, swaying and jiving to the music. Nobody cared how they looked or how everyone else around them looked because everyone's purpose was to dance and appreciate music. A completely different experience than Gold Coast clubs for sure.

2009-07-14,2.0,"Was there this past Sunday, too late for brunch, had the food not been up to par, I would have only given 1 star based on the service, or lack of. Here's my advice to the manager: 1. I just assume you have plantains on the menu if you're a Latin-fusion restaurant and you do, but they're only on the dinner menu. OK, so when I ask the waiter if it's possible to get some, it shouldn't take 10 minutes (yes I was timing it) to determine such. I don't need an overview of food procurement either from such to know why I'm not able to order. A simple, we don't have them is sufficient. 2. When I ask for a check, it would be cool to get it fairly promptly. 3. When my GF goes inside to ask the hostess if the waiter might have gone home, and asks for a check...it might be an indication that we still need the check 4. When it still hasn't come and I have to go in and ask for the check...it makes an enjoyable summer day a little less so 5. Finally, visualize this, after our initial beverage ran dry and our waiter and staff disappeared we then finished our water. After those ran dry and the busboy walked up to the table right next to us and refilled their coffee and water, I bet my GF $5 that he would pivot 45 degrees and ask us if we wanted a refill. She being as smart as she is didn't take the bet...she would have lost. It's really not hard to deliver good customer service, no wait it must be.

By the time my dates arrived, I was almost finished with it and we all moved towards the Fresca Margarita which was a fabulous if not neon red margarita thanks in part to the blood orange mix. We drank them out of the blood orange mix half way through dinner and my final drink of the evening was the Cuatro Margarita. We started with the tuna Ceviche which was more than just tuna; the appetizer was redolent with rock shrimp, calamari, tuna and a piquant sauce. We also ordered two of the empanadas to share including the luxurious crab and goat cheese and one filled with duck served with a garlicky pesto of parsley/cilantro/culantro. The fillings were slightly overpowered by the perfectly wrapped and fried dough, but delicious nonetheless. After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the perfectly spicy pinchos de pollo, grilled chicken brochettes expertly basted with a fiery tamarind jerk sauce and served with moros and cristianos and perfectly cooked maduro plantains. One of my dates opted for the stuffed trout and the other ordered a three potato mash in corn crepes. Believe me, the menu is perfectly punctuated with all kinds of steak and pork, so if that is more to your liking, please be assured Cuatro has that too. As it had been revealed that we were there to celebrate my birthday, the ubiquitous birthday dessert was sent out with a candle, but the trio of dark chocolate, pistachio and vanilla bean ice cream were excellent. I don't think most restaurants do very well with desserts, and ice cream is usually the biggest offender in terms of quality, but not here. It was very clear to me, from the blue crab in the empanadas to the French-style ice cream that Cuatro cares about every last ingredient and the quality and integrity of those ingredients. A decadent chocolate mousse cake was also ordered for the table and it was also quite excellent and served with the same vanilla bean ice cream.

I only have one complaint, and that was the ceviche with the salmon, and scallops. The flavor was amazing and presentation was beautiful. However there was more pico de gallo than seafood.  If you are charging $13 for ceviche there needs to be lots of fresh seafood. I would skip this next time and maybe try the goat cheese empanadas. The entrees were delish. I had the rainbow trout that was stuffed with rock shrimp and yukon gold potatos the salsa was made with coconut milk and various exotic spices. It was served with a bacon sauteed swiss chard. Yummy !! My boyfriend had the kobe burger and it was amzing, heavenly, if I were on death row I might have the burger as my last meal. It had applewood smoked bacon, malbec carmelized onion, and drenched with white truffle oil. I am not a beef fan, but kobe is an exception. I would probably enjoy this sandwich without the beef. I was not blown away by the purple fries, but could not stop eating them because the spicy ketchup was so delicious. Capirihnas are $5 on Wednesdays, and buy do they pack a punch.

2008-08-11,4.0,"Why does every restaurant in the South Loop feel compelled to overcharge for its food?  Actually, I know why.  Because they can. It's not that I didn't enjoy my dinner at Cuatro; I actually liked my meal quite a bit.  However, the food and drinks didn't blow me away enough to where it could justify the high costs.  Drinks-wise, I got the Fresca Magarita and my fiancee ordered the Howler Monkey Mojito.  My margarita was pretty good; the muddled oranges and cucumbers definitely made it refreshing.  My fiancee's mojito was so so -- we've definitely had better.  I thought it was interesting that they charge different prices for ordering your drinks on the rocks ($11 each, in our case) vs straight up ($13) because it only highlights the fact that their drinks are way overpriced. As for food, we had dinner with a few other people and started things off with the coctel vuelve a la vida (essentially a variety of seafood in cocktail sauce) and the empanadas de pernil filled with pork and black beans.  Again, the food was fine but not worth the money.  As for entrees, my fiancee got the trucha amazona (trout fillet filled with shrimp, bacon and chard) and I got the filete jibaro (four petite filet mignon medallions with Caribbean root vegetable mash).  The trout had a bit of a kick to it but otherwise was pretty good.  My filets were prepared well, though I must admit that the Caribbean root vegetable mash tasted pretty much like regular mashed potatoes (I was hoping for more wow factor).   For dessert, our table shared the batata cake (warm sweet potato upside-down cake with orange mango salsa) and the crepas de guineitos (warm plantain crepes filled with bananas and pistachio praline ice cream).  This was by far the best part of the meal.  The batata cake was fluffy and sopped up the orange mango salsa very well.  Even better were the plantain crepes: not too sweet but still full of flavor.  There were some other items on the dessert menu that looked appealing too so I highly recommend you save room for dessert. If everything at Cuatro was about $3 cheaper, I probably would have given them five stars.  But then again, jacking up prices is one of the perks that comes with opening shop in South Loop.  It might be because I used to live in Logan Square and we used get to get comparably Latin food for far less money.  I know I shouldn't fault Cuatro for that but it's still something to keep in mind when deciding where to eat.",0.9975,0.818,0.178,0.004,0.5511858974358974

Drinks:  Their ""howler monkey mojito"" was good for the first ten minutes, but became really diluted with all of the ice they put in it. Appetizers:  We knew Cuatro was famous for their ""ceviche de salmon y callos, so we ordered it.  A-mazing.  This ceviche was not only one of the best looking dishes I have ever seen, it was loaded with flavor and texture.  It was finely chopped up salmon and scallops surrounded by thinly slices avocados and a nice tamarind red sauce of the bottom.  This was so good we ordered another one!  They serve it with homemade potato chips, which were average at best. Entrees:  I ordered their ""pinchos de pollo"" which means small pieces of chicken marinated in a spicy sauce, served with rice, beans, and sweet fried plantains.  This dish was loaded with flavor, yet the chicken really wasn't that special for what I thought it would be.  My friends ordered the ""salmon entamalado"" and the ""filete jibaro.""  Both were outstanding.  The salmon was cooked inside of a banana leaf, which made it moist and juicy.  The steak, which is served as four 2oz filets, were topped with a chimichurri sauce and were super-tender.  I wish I had ordered this instead. Dessert:  Usually I hit dessert on the money, but just like my entree, I missed again.  I ordered the plantain crepes, and they were nice and warm, but the crepe itself was grey in color, something I had never seen before.  It came with a small scoop of praline ice cream and chopped pistachios on top.  Not bad, but again not what as good as I had hoped.  The other two desserts tried were the chocolate mousse cake (I hate mousse so I can't fairly review it) and the upside down sweet potato cake.  The ""batata cake,"" as it is known there, was fantastic and looked great, with the orange sweet potato topping and the coconut milk ice cream.   Overall:  Cuatro is a great place for Latin food lovers like myself, and I hopefully can return sometime soon to try their other dishes.  So far, between Cuatro and Carnivale, the edge goes to Carnivale because of their record setting guacamole and their dining room and atmosphere that really set them apart.",0.9984,0.761,0.207,0.032,0.5388154027042915

Worst of all, the mojito (my favorite drink) was pretty sour. But for overly pricey dining, this was still a hot spot. On a rich friend's tab, I got Cachapas De Papa, one of only two vegetarian entrees (and I was told it was the bigger of the two!), which tasted wonderful but incomplete. I also tasted some of my friends' plates, including Ensalada Caribe, a good jicama and lettuce salad, and an appetizer that I have forgotten (must not have been that great). Some good deserts, though. The Pastel Cuatro Leches was small and overly fancy, but definitely a delight, and the Abacaxi Crme Brulee was pretty great, though I don't usually go to places with that kind of thing. After the mojito, I tried a Pomegranate liqueur mojito that was a definite improvement. But on drinks, one thing that I'll say for them is that they have some good rums. No Bacardi, which is a huge plus (since it tastes horrible and finances terrorism), but other options ranged from the easier to find Appleton Estates and Myer's dark rum, to the more exciting Rhum Betancourt (one of my favorites), 10 Cane, and the unfortunately titled Plantation Rum. One of the biggest delights, however, was the live jazz band, playing Miles Davis classics and other soothers.  They were very good, with enough of a spin on the classics to make it their own. Jazz and rum helped pick this place up for me. All in all, too posh and pricey for me, but also for what you get.",0.9951,0.733,0.215,0.052,0.6633333333333333

2006-08-16,3.0,"Food at this South Loop spot was superb.  Took a while for the hostess to figure out where to seat us with about 9 emtpy tables, our drink order took about 15 minutes, and the waiter was difficult to comprehend, but the food made up for these minor kinks.  They have a pretty large specialty drink menu and a wide selection of entrees from seafood heavy dishes to your basic tamale.  I would reccommend this spot for anyone venturing into the South Loop.",0.7269,0.897,0.082,0.021,0.5816964285714286
2006-08-14,5.0,"I thought the food was awesome.  It's expensive, but I live nearby and it seems like they are always mailing out coupons so that helps.  We went on a weeknight and the place was almost empty, which I thought was nice.",0.911,0.68,0.283,0.037,0.74
2006-08-05,4.0,"The sophisticated atmosphere, and consistently good food make this one of my favorite haunts.  I highly recommend the moqueca do mar , salmon, and pork chops.  Since the cocktail menu seems like a work in progress, I would stick with the wine. I especially like the crowd in Cuatro.  If you've ever wondered where  30something writers, professors and diverse ethnicities gather when the hipsters are away, wonder no more.  The owner is likely to sidle up to you at the bar and ask you to try a new libation. In essence, Cuatro is like a smile from a cute stranger across the room -  it's kind of quiet,  but full of promise and it makes you smile back.",0.9418,0.778,0.196,0.025,0.6051919191919192

2006-05-22,3.0,"It was decent.  I think I had overhyped expectations since I read it's the best new restaurant in the area.  We booked a nice romantic dinner here.  Subdued atmosphere.  Pretty quiet for the night actually.  Food was above-average.  Pricey, but we did have some spanish champagne.  I'll try the other new restaurants in the area before going back.  Bottom line:  I didn't leave with my belt unbuckled nor was my stomach singing coo coo racha.",0.8581,0.837,0.163,0.0,0.43200757575757565
2006-03-27,4.0,"Just took a friend out for his bday dinner - Cuatro was just right: understated decor (we liked the lounge atmosphere), friendly & prompt service (plus, the bartender was kind of cute w/his accent :)), and delicious food. From the drinks, appetizer, entrees, and dessert - we were pleasantly impressed with the presentation and taste. I really enjoyed the Pechuga Rellena, the stuffed chicken w/cheese and fresh corn tamale, mmmmm. The chili jus made for a complementing flavor as well. I'd definitely go back for seconds!",0.9846,0.678,0.322,0.0,0.7404761904761905
2006-02-11,4.0,"I went here for the first time last night and enjoyed it.  The ambiance was understated, particularly for a latino restaurant, but classy. Several nice aquariums to brighten up an otherwise dark restaurant. Everyone at our table seemed to really enjoy their food. I had the pork chops, which the waiter recommended as one of their best dishes. They were excellent. Marinated in sugar cane, but they weren't overwhelmingly sweet (the waiter said it does more to make the meat tender than to sweeten it). Anyway, the biggest knock were the drinks, which were expensive and nothing special. A mojito ($10) and glass of sangria ($7) cost almost as much as the entree.",0.9814,0.715,0.24,0.045,0.509672619047619
2005-11-16,3.0,"This is a new Latino restaurant that just opened up in the South Loop. Its been open for about 6 weeks now and I had the chance to check it out last night. The decor itself is rather disappointing. Being a Latino restaurant, it should be more bright and warm. However, this restaurant is dark with no hint of  ""Latino"" flavor to it. They currently don't have a liquor license so for now its BYOB, which is nice. For appetizers my friend and I tried the barbacoa flautas which were pretty good. We also ordered the pernil empanadas. They weren't that good. They tried to fuse too many flavors which in the end was too much for my palate. For my entree I tried the chuleta en mole de platano macho which is a pork chop in this spicy mole sauce made from plantains. That was decent. I think this restaurant needs to spice it up a bit. Both in decor and in their menu. I may give it another try in a few months.",0.9428,0.846,0.124,0.03,0.5345811051693403
