2013-07-15,4.0,We went to La Turka just because it was close by and were very pleasantly surprised at how tasty our food was. I ordered the vegetable musakka and couldn't have been more pleased. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The hummas is creamy and delicious. To top it off the bread they bake daily has a crispy crust and is soft inside...a perfect bread for dipping in the hummas. I've been back 3 times in 2 weeks. I hear there is Turkish dancing on Friday and Saturday nights but we go for the food.,0.9028,0.837,0.163,0.0,0.5909090909090909

The prices are way too high for very little food and something you could make at home.

2011-02-04,1.0,"We made a reservation at A La Turka for our Godson's 14th birthday. He wanted to go somewhere to sit on pillows while we ate. My husband read good reviews for A La Turka and thought the adults would enjoy the belly dancers. We had a large party - 8 - and made reservations approximately 3 weeks ago, for tomorrow night, 2/5 to ensure that they could accommodate us for such an event. Over the phone, the manager was very friendly and assured us that is would be a great birthday party.  We called yesterday, 2/3 to re-confirm our reservation and found that all the phone numbers were disconnected. Since our Godson has been looking forward to this dinner for his birthday for almost a month, my husband drove to the restaurant today to further investigate. Upon arrival, he found that the restaurant was closed for renovations until mid-February. It is hard to believe that ""renovations"" were not planned ahead of time - so it boggles my mind that they even took the reservation in the first place. Secondly, the fact that they did not call us to tell us the restaurant was closed, means that if we had not called yesterday to re-confirm, my Godson and his parents would have driven a hour into the city on Saturday to meet us, standing in front of a closed restaurant with no alternate plans.  I am completely outraged that A La Turka allowed this to occur, and although I have never tried the restaurant, I will NEVER EVER EVER go there, even if they do re-open. Now, at noon the day before, we are scrambling to find a restaurant with pillow dining and an available table for 8 for a birthday party. Horribly Disappointed. UPDATE - 2/5 - The Day-of Reservation I received a phone call from A La Turka today to notify me of the restaurant renovations. They apologized for the late notice, stated that the restaurant was under new management, which did not realize there were advance reservations on the books. They offered to send us to a sister restaurant and give us 10% off the bill. The sister restaurant did not have the pillow seating and we had already made alternate arrangements (it was only 7 hours before the reservation), but nevertheless I appreciated the phone call and the apology. Perhaps they saw my review here on Yelp...nevertheless, the apology definitely earns them a second shot.

Blah. First of all, oddly, they took away two of our menus after we sat down to give to other diners.  There were only 2 other tables filled in a giant room full of tables-- did they only have 6 menus all together?? Why would they need our menus??  We were fine sharing, however, and managed to settle on some items.  We started with hummus, which was fine.  I'm not sure why we got it, though-- hummus is the most prosaic food on earth.  I'm going to stop ordering it as an appetizer everywhere but Pita Inn.  Anyway, my bf and I split the lamb kebobs and the moussaka.  They were... fine. The rice pilaf with the kebabs was really plain, almost dry, and there was hardly any lamb, and a weird carroty salad.  That was a disappointment.  The moussaka was good, but barely warm at all! That's def a dish that needs to be hot, and this one disappointed. I will give 2 points for atmosphere, because it really felt like we were in a tent.  But I can think of at least 5 other middle eastern restaurants nearby that are more affordable and more delicious.  Sorry, A La Turka.  Actually, sorry self, for ruining the dream that this would be my favorite restaurant.  Now I can't even hold onto that hope.",0.9216,0.787,0.127,0.086,0.5783730158730158

He was running around trying to take care of 15 tables or so. He had good recommendations but when we needed something, he  was hard to get a hold of.   Food: Now to be completely honest, I've never had Turkish food before and actually found this to be decent. The eggplant was good...however, I was able to eat it all in a matter of minutes. It could be that I had a huge appetite or it maybe the portion of it was on the smaller side, who knows? I can say that it wasn't something that I would go out of my way to have again... Price & Portion: Price wise, it was a little pricey for eggplant. Portion wasn't any better...but that may be due to me being really hungry.  Overall: A La Turka isn't bad, but it's not something I would go and tell my friends about.

They tell you that they LOVE the place, that they would move heaven and earth to eat there, but then, after one less than stellar experience, they go on Yelp and torpedo the place.  Evidently A La Turka had different ownership in the past. Who cares? The current dishes on the menu are quite good. Particularly the falafel which has a nice low-level spice to it. The humus is also quite good, if not somewhat straightforward. The cigar rolls, very nice. And the chicken kebob is extremely tender in a delightful tomato sauce. To round things out, enjoy some imported Turkish pilsner beer.  If you're interested in dinner and a show, stay for the belly dancing. It's a blast!  And since the dancers move from table to table, you might just be invited to join in. Belly dancing hours are clearly posted and the restaurant usually makes an announcement beforehand.

I visited two months later with a date on a Thursday evening.  We came here after finding that nearby Nazarlik was mysteriously closed for several days.  While far from empty, the crowd was thin, lending the dark room a quiet and intimate air.  The service was again satisfying, but I found my entree merely mediocre this time.  I did have a very good Turkish wine.",0.9649,0.832,0.127,0.04,0.48396145124716555

Myself and the person I went here with have both worked at servers...so we are more understanding than the average asshole that goes out to eat.  The guy greets us right away, and then ask what we want...told him to come back after a few minutes.  He comes back and we make a Appetizer and drink order...we need more time for the dinner order....freaking guy doesn't come back for at least 30min.  Luckily I understand that going out to eat isn't all about getting your food right away, so for me it was an inconvenience...but I'm sure to you folk out there you would probably be ready to wage war over your dining experience. It seems that the only items that don't involve meat are eggplant entrees...so I guess your options are either Cows or Eggplants...Eggplants won of course (that's like picking the fat kid or the nerd for your 4th grade pick up basketball game)   Humus...yummy I'm a little socially awkward.  I tend to avoid places that have guitar players come to your table and play.  So when I walked in and saw those belly dancers I got a little nervous.  What are you supposed to do when a lady walks up to you while your gnawing on some eggplant?  Do I stare?  Ignore?   Continue on with your conversation? I don't understand... The owner seems like a funny dude...if he didn't own that place I bet he would be a used car salesman I could see how someone would like this place...just wasn't my cup of tea",0.9221,0.847,0.101,0.052,0.5296825396825396

Back in the day, it was never crowded (even for the belly dancing!) and it felt like my own personal turkish paradise. That decor totally sucks you in and makes you feel like you are in a tent out in the desert or something.  I have always been completely happy with my food. I usually will start with either their eggplant dip or hummus. Yum! I love the warm pita bread that comes with that. For my main course, I tend to order the stuffed baby egg plant. The eggplant is sooo tender and the whole dish is just delicious. Plus, its vegetarian! The other day I branched out and tried the Sultans Wrap. Whoa! It had the tastiest portabello mushrooms in it. Definitely a keeper.  While the food has always been great, now a days this place is usually packed on the weekends. While I've been for the belly dancing, I tend to enjoy my meal more when its quiet. If you prefer a more intimate feeling, try going during off-peak times.  A final note, I think this would be a great restaurant to bring a date, a group of friends, OR your parents. Personally, I've been with all three. It has an inviting atmosphere with great food.

Don't know much about Turkish food either, as McDonald's Dollar Menu is severely lacking in this area, but this place was quite delectable. Did I mention the belly dancer? Yes, it's that kind of place. Why only 3 stars? For starters, we were seated in the private room on the second floor. Now, the first floor had all these authentic looking tables with pillows all around. It really gave the place a Turkish-kinda feel. The private room we were in had all these small round tables made for 2 people that we had to put next to each other in order to make one long, misshapen ""table"". Our food was brought out family style, which was cool. You try what looks good. No problem. The food was great, but styrofoam plates? Plastic utensils? I didn't know I was at a picnic. The music was too loud, we had to get our own drinks at the bar, and, while I'm at it, some of the floor tiles were loose and floating about for some unsuspecting partygoer to slip and fall on. The belly dancer was cool. She did her thing for a few minutes and then took off. As far as the hookah situation, who knows. It would have been nice if someone had explained to us what the deal is now that we have the new smoking laws in Chicago, but I guess not. After all, I would think that hookahs would be one of the draws of a Turkish joint. Lets recap : Food - Great                        Service/Presentation - Lacking All in all a good experience.

2007-12-11,5.0,"I had my first experience at A La Turka last week with a few friends.  I can totally see how it has the great rating.  Not just because of everyone else's praise, but by the way we were treated when we arrived. It was snowy and crappy out.  We walked in and were the only ones in the entire restaurant (it was about 7pm).  We were immediately warmly greeted and given a table (of our choice *lol* we had the pick of the place).  Right away our waiter took our drink orders and got them going for us before the appetizers were placed.  I wish I had the name of the server because he was so warm and sincere that it just left a really great impression on me. For appetizers we had the vegan sampler platter.  It consisted of some stuffed grape leaves, a titziki like dip, hummus, tabouli and  greek olives.  At first I had asked for warm pita to go with it, since to me it felt like a plate I'd had at the Greek Island, however the server explained that they didn't have pita's but they made their bread fresh daily and it's quite a favorite of the regulars.  The bread didn't disappoint.  I probably could have made a meal from the bread and various dips.  One in particular had eggplant in it and I LOVE eggplant.  It was fantastic; slightly sweet, not to watery, just perfect. For Entre's I had the Lamb Special (marinated and delicately seasoned lamb, sauted with scallions, white onions, portobello mushrooms, and tomatoes. Seasoned in a special house spice and topped with garlic yogurt.   After my trip to Demera the week before, I was hoping that they wouldn't be skimpy with the lamb.  They weren't.  There were lots of big hunks of super tender marinated lamb.  The sauce was heaven.  I could have made another meal out of bread and that sauce.   I can't recall what the other couple had ordered.  I was so wrapped up in my meal, not to mention nibbling off my BF's plate.  He had the the beef stew.  Again the meat was tender and well seasoned.  It was packed with veggies and had a kick to it.  Portions were big but not insane.  I actually like it that way.  There was enough to take some home, but I wouldn't be eating it for a week. Our server boxed up our leftovers and thanked us so much for coming in on a cold and snowy night.  The pleasure was all ours; we'll definitely be back again.",0.9987,0.747,0.234,0.019,0.4572535991140643

2007-11-25,4.0,"It's interesting to read everyone's reviews and how varied they are.  On Saturday a group of 8 of us decided to head to A La Turka (11/24/2007).  For 5 of us, it was the first time, but for MK and I, well, this is our old 'hood and was the site of our 2nd date.  In our party were two sets of parents (60's) and 4 of us from 38-41. I think part of this restaurant is understanding what you're walking into before going.  The food is good, not outstanding, but good.  Almost everyone at our table had doggie bags to go but everyone agreed their food was worth the trip. The attraction of A La Turka is the bellydancing shows (check website for times) and an owner who fancies himself a celebrity of sorts.  There's not many Turkish restaurants in Chicago and he does take great pride that he's brought a little slice of Istanbul to a part of the world that, more than likely, can't identify the country on a map (Yes, it's just North of Iraq).  Who can begrudge a man who is living the American dream?  So if you can accept that he's a bit over the top and full of himself with his accomplishments, than this isn't THAT big of a deal to you.  On the night we went, he actually toned down his little routine for the nightly drawing (we actually won a $15 Gift Cert at our table) and just made sure that everyone was happy. The place was full, so in spite of some of the very negative reviews, this place still draws and has for the 3+ years MK and I have gone here.  We each get the Mixed Grill Platter which has a little bit of everything from their menu. For everyone who complains that the music is too loud, it is, but just during the bellydancing that lasts about 15 minutes.  Hopefully that bit isn't what keeps you away from something a little different in a very large city.",0.9917,0.788,0.164,0.048,0.47623399897593444

I enjoyed my meal , the atmosphere was nice , the wait staff was very attentive , but it just didn't pop for me. I came here with a friend that is big time into Middle Eastern food and he loves it there, for me , it's simply a nice change of pace meal. I ordered the hummus to start things off , it was very good , but I'm not that well versed in hummus to differentiate good and great hummus. My son was there and did not dig the food  the place had, but he is a bit picky at times and they were nice to him there.I ordered the mixed grill platter , which literally had a little of everything. From kafta to chicken kabob , gyros (lamb and beef , and chicken) , beef kabob , lamb kabob and one or two other things I might hurt myself trying to pronounce. I liked everything , the whole meats more than the ground meats but that is personal preference. I hear that they have belly dancers on some nights , that could only add to the experience. I am on the fence rating this place 3 or 4 stars. In my head a 3 star place is nice but I don't see myself ever getting a taste to get back there , in other words ,nice but I've tasted better. A 4 star place is somewhere that is really good and perhaps does a thing or two better than most places. The atmosphere and service are really good , but the food failed to give the necessary push to 4 star land. The final decision maker was the price.

As for the service and food, they were both exceptionally average.  Sophia, our waitress, was prompt and friendly, yet not around much for as empty as the place was.  The food continues to be a decent value, although Fattoush on Halsted still can't be beat in my book for price, food and service.  The eggplant dip ( baba ganoush) was very smoky - a little different from any BBG that I've had.  It was the most BBG that I've ever been served at a restaurant, though. As for the entrees, everyone was pleased with their selections, although there was nothing to write home about.  The Sultan's Wrap that I had was very tasty, but a little rich for dinner.   Overall, I'd probably stick to this as a fun group experience on the weekends when the belly dancers perform and go for the entertainment not the food.",0.9799,0.86,0.124,0.016,0.46515151515151515

From the moment you walk in the door, the decor immediately overwhelms, which in my book, is great.  While the decoration and design of the restaurant is loud, it all made sense.  To each side of the main entrance are opposing booths where diners can sit comfortably on cushions surrounding a round common table.  Unfortunately for me and my date, none of these tables were available at the time we came in.  (There are also two more large ""booths"" near the center of the dining area.   We were seated immediately, and, since it was a Wednesday, it was moderately crowded, however, I would speculate that when full, the dining area could become rather loud.  At a few points during the meal, both of us had to raise our voices a bit.   We had the Musaka (an eggplant puree with lamb and rice), along with Grape Leaves for appetizers.  Both were delicious, especially the Musaka.  The texture of the mixture fit well with the included pita, and let's be honest, who doesn't like pita?!  The portion of Musaka was rather large, so plan accordingly if you're going to sample.   The grape leaves had a hint of cinnamon (I think) which tasted different, but good. After the appetizers, both myself and my friend decided to split the Chicken wrapped Asparagus.  This dish was also delicious, although more basic than what I had originally wanted to order.  Nonetheless, it was wonderfully cooked, and tasted great. For dessert, I had to try the Baklava, as I had heard rave reviews.  It did not disappoint.  The flaky crust was a perfect complement to the honey glazed bottom layer.  Absolutely the highlight of the meal.  (What can I say, I have an aggressive sweet tooth.) The wine list was very disappointing, but they do have a fully stocked bar.  We got a bottle of wine, as I was in the mood for a red, but next time, I'll definitely have a cocktail if I'm drinking.

Word of advice, if you can, do not sit on the south wall of the dining room.  This is where we were seated and it was very, very dim.  The only light we had was from the table candle.  I was also hoping to sample a treat from the hookah bar, but it is only open on Friday's and Saturday's.  My fault for not calling before hand, I guess.   Overall, I will definitely be back, mainly for the food, but also to check out the scene on the weekend.  This restaurant has garnered a lot of referrals in my circle of friends, and lived up to its positive billing.",0.998,0.775,0.18,0.045,0.5772677906888433

2006-10-09,2.0,"This place was reviewed well on Check Please so we figured it was not to be missed.  Unfortunately, the food here makes A La Turka a 'please pass by'.  While the interior is a very well done version of a Mediterranean hookah lounge, the food just doesn't match up. We ordered the special (maybe this was a bad idea?) that consisted of chicken gyro meat, cucumber sauce, rice, bread and baklava & tea for dessert.   The chicken had very little taste and was not of very high quality, the rice was pretty basic, but the bread was nice.  The baklava was a positive note on which to end the meal, however how does one make a bad baklava? In all, I can't recommend A La Turka.  Unless the food is vastly improved, i wouldn't waste my time.",0.9265,0.739,0.186,0.076,0.6751477633477633
2006-10-06,4.0,"I just went here for my birthday and had a wonderful time.  The food was excellent, with generous portions as the norm.  The chicken Sultan Wrap was fantastic, and so big I ate half for lunch the next day.   Other reviewers are right in that it can get very loud when the belly dancint starts, but the belly dancing is a wonderful way to get everyone in high spirits and having fun. Service was a bit slow, even for a relatively calm Thursday night, but we were also in a large group, which could account for some of it.  The waitstaff was always professional and courteous, however. All in all, a good place to take a group for a festive time.",0.9856,0.756,0.244,0.0,0.5813659147869674
2006-08-21,3.0,"Amazing Kabobs.  Overall a good restaurant, supposedly halal (accroding to the owner), which doesn't make sense as they service drinkies too.  It can get super loud when the belly dancing starts; this is accompanied by the owner walking around with a megaphone.  Packed on the weekends.",0.891,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.5933333333333334
2006-08-05,2.0,"Honestly I don't see what the fuss is all about, I was there just this evening and I had much better Turkish food in other restaurants and I know what it's supposed to be like, I am Turkish! First of all this place is too dark, and with way too many things on the wall and all around the place, the place looks not only too dark and it feels so narrow and claustrophobic too. The table we sat at was too small for their big sized dishes. Our waiter was always mumbling in stead of talking clearly and he looked as if he didn't give a crap about being there. The owner kept yelling on top of his lungs when he was looking for his staff. The appetizers were very delicious. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw SIgara Boregi, they are the best thing in the world! Our Eggplant Salad was also equally good. When it comes to Lahmacun, forget it! It was just straight out bland. And it was small too, and ridiculously priced at 4 dollars. At Turquoise it's almost three times bigger, really, it's huge, tastes like it should, and it's only $2.50! By the way I ordered diet Pepsi for a drink,and it was no different than water with sugar, either their machine ran out of Pepsi, or they put too much ice, I don't know which! Entrees weren't anything special, I was pretty surprised when they brought the Iskender, which was just nothing close to it. They put a little bit of yogurt on the side, the meat was tasteless, and the bread was soggy. At least they brought some rice along with it, which was okay. Also there was no music, just the noise from the customers. Our waiter told us there was music and that it was just that people were making too much noise. I really don't want to imagine a restaurant without music. It's just boring. I don't know if I will be going back, I just know that I have other options to satisfy my Turkish food craving.",0.9827,0.839,0.121,0.04,0.5646520146520145
2006-05-02,4.0,"My husband lived in Turkey for awhile growing up and tends to be somewhat picky about his Turkish food. We have been here several times now and have always enjoyed it. The kabobs are good, I love the Barek (not sure if I spelled it right, but then again, I did not live in Turkey. But it's fillo wrapped feta cheese and it's darn good.) I also really like the chicken gyros which I think are not authentic but they are tasty. This is a great place for lunch on the weekends- it's not busy and you can sit down right away! Dinner is much more lively and loud. I enjoy it either way!",0.9803,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.5525898078529657
2005-11-14,5.0,"This place is excellent.  I was there last Saturday for the first time and we had a reservation for 35 people for a birthday.  I'd say this is the perfect place to have a celebration.  It seemed like everyone there had something to celebrate (bdays, anniversaries, promotions, etc.)    The staff definitely makes everyone feel like family, they're very attentive to our requests and always came around to make sure that our dinner was going well.  The belly dancing provided a very lively, interactive environment...lots of fun, laughter and excellent (healthy) food!",0.9881,0.667,0.333,0.0,0.648989898989899

2005-08-13,4.0,"If anyone knows me, I wont give a place 5 stars unless I have been there more than once.  This place, I was here ""once"" so giving it 4 stars is about as high as I can go..  the atmosphere was relaxing. The food very good lots of vegan dishes.  Tables with Hookas and pillows for floor seating or tables and chairs to sit on.  PLUS a bar (hooka?) upstairs.  We didnt go up... so you see, I cant give it 5 stars because I didnt exlore the whole place and I was only there once.  BUT the service was great the food was terrific and the belly dancing was a nice touch. ALSO if you have the Entertainment coupon book, there is a bogo coupon for a dinner entree.  enjoy!",0.9818,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.7188888888888889
