2010-09-12,3.0,"This is a beer review by iSpyBeerGuy. Charlie's Ale House in Andersonville, one of two restaurants under the Charlie's umbrella in Chicago, offers traditional American bar fare in a grand pub setting, resplendent with antique light fixtures, a fireplace, cozy wooden booths and a sizable oak bar, which serpentines through one side of the restaurant. It's a popular spot, particularly on weekends, when the large flatscreens are tuned to college and pro football.  Considering the mainstream appeal of Charlie's, lovers of great craft beer could be excused for passing it by on the way to Hopleaf, down the street. However, Charlie's is worth another look.  Bar manager Matt has put together a great selection of beers - 24 drafts and over 50 bottles - which rotate with some frequency and on a recent visit featured, on draft, Three Floyds Dreadnaught and Gumball, Bridgeport Hop Czar, Dark Horse Rod Ale, Great Lakes Elliot Ness, Two Brothers Atom Smasher, Goose Island Harvest and Matilda, Stone Arrogant Bastard and Pale Ale, Left Hand Blackjack Porter, Ommegang Abbey Ale and plenty more.  The bottle list is extensive and offers beers from many of the big craft breweries (Avery, Dogfish Head, Founders, Rogue and Victory) as well as some I'd heard of but hadn't seen, including Big Sky Brewing Company (Missoula, MT) and Crown Valley Brewing Company (Saint Genevieve, MO).  While Charlie's crowd will probably limit the bar's ability to rotate beers and experiment with new brands and varieties, I've been pleasantly surprised with my visits to date. As long as they have a flavorful imperial IPA on tap and new beers to try, I'll keep coming back. Find me on Twitter @iSpyBeerGuy.",0.9587,0.889,0.096,0.015,0.40244059644059654

2010-08-23,3.0,"Well my, my, Charlie, don't you have a nice neighborhood pub there? My experience here was so easy and pleasant that you can almost forget you've been there.  I felt like there was hardly anything to make this place truly stand out in my mind, but I wouldn't take that as a bad thing. I've had ""memorable experiences"" at other places I'd just as soon forget. Honestly? I decided on Charlie's because I was looking at reviews of a couple places in the area looking for somewhere to take my mom when she visited and past reviewers had mentioned bringing their parents here. And it FELT like a good 'bring your parents' pub. Not too loud, not too flamboyant, just a comfortable place to sit and have a burger and a beer.  Actually, that's the one thing that I felt was above-average. I like to say I'm a burger-a-year gal. Generally I'm just not a red meat-eater at all and it's purely taste. (That's right cows, pack up your sad eyes, they have no effect on me!) But about once a year I find myself craving a good bar burger. This was one of those times. And Charlie's BBQ Blue did not disappoint. If I get the itch to wander up this way again, I may even bump it up to a twice-a-year burger craving...",0.9613,0.779,0.151,0.069,0.603452380952381

Like I have seen a lot of yelpers write, I feel bad doing this, because you used to be an okay place, but I have to stop being in denial about the fact that Charlies Ale House sucks.  Yeah, that's pretty much it, sucks.  Honestly I think that Charlie's sucks so much because all of the staff are lifers, will probably never get another job, and they just don't give a shit. The staff spend most of their time being friendly with the alcoholic regulars so that they can take advantage of them, you can get decent tips from alcoholic regulars if you pretend to be their friend.  My family and I would go here regularly when we moved into the neighborhood. The food was good and the service great. My mom was such a regular that everyone there knew her. The last couple of times that I went there with friends the service sucked, and the food isn't good enough to make up for that. The last time was particularly bad, we barely had a server. We were seated, sat there for 20 minutes, finally took our order, brought our beers and food at the same time, didn't come back for another hour, never asked us if we wanted more drinks, never checked on us, not once. We were chatting and not in a hurry, but JC if were weren't did this chick really think that it would take us an hour to drink a beer and have some artichoke dip (which sucked BTW)? I gave her a great tip anyway, not sure why. But I am done, never going back.",0.9698,0.736,0.157,0.107,0.46003052503052494

Usually, I would go to Ann Sather's but it was Father's Day and packed. I was hungry and Charlie's Ale House is never too busy, which should be a tell tale sign.  The brunch was lukewarm and far from a generous portion. Also, the prices for such low quality fare is borderline abusive. The service, from the snide hosts to the server who has to explain that their cooking staff is disagreeable to the staff as a whole unwilling to help out other tables is indicative of larger issues. I have been here a few times because it is easy for a family to sit and eat without waiting. It is, at best, average and usually mediocre. I won't be back.  Andersonville has a huge amount of good to great restaurants.

Charlie's does not serve illegal substances. As far as I know. The french fries were a nice complement.  I went to Charlie's to meet a friend to watch the Blackhawks beat the Flyers for game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals. It was a bit of an older crowd there and other than some drunken hooting and hollering, it wasn't obnoxious at all.  The place had an open front because it was nice out and a bunch of big TV screens were strategically placed on the walls so regardless of where you sat and what direction you happened to be facing, chances are you'll have a TV within your range of vision. Each one was on the Blackhawks and I think one oddball was on the White Sox game.  The beer selection is pretty impressive, although I was too hungry to be choosy about potations. I got a goblet of Stella and a Charlie's Burger, which was your basic hamburger on a pretzel roll, medium well just the way I like it. I didn't put any condiments on it and it was still good. The french fries at this place are like crack, if you'll allow me again to compare the food to hard drugs. The french fries were like methamphetime.  For dessert I had a slice of apple pie accompanied by a scoop of cinnamon ice cream. The pie was OK. The crust was a little soft for my taste. I liked the ice cream better than the pie.

Charlie's veggieburger is rice-based which (looking at you Dunlay's on the Square), can be a bad thing, but Charlie's blends a fantastic burger!

Now to the food.  As I mentioned earlier, I ordered the smoked salmon omelet, which came with hash browns.  In all truth, the reason I ordered this was because I had seen Tyler Florence make it on the food network and told myself I wanted to try it.   I did, and overall I was pleased.  There were a few smaller things that detracted from the dish.  First, I wanted more chives.  Second, I wanted crispier potatoes.  And third, I wanted the eggs to be more lightly cooked.  I don't dig browned eggs.

2008-08-15,4.0,"I guess it's 'bout time I added my two cents about Charlie's, since we end up there just about every other weekend.  Yes, it's really the only restaurant/bar of it's kind in Andersonville, and yes, I've had some poor service, but on the whole, we keep returning to Charlie's. Why?  Well, for starters, the food is decent.  If we're feeling a bit blah and can't decide what type of food we want, or if we are tired and really don't want to leave the neighborhood, we go to Charlie's.  If we want a beer or a cocktail but don't really want to get prettied up and make a big fuss of it, we go to Charlie's.  If we want to gather some friends in one place for a birthday or other special event, we often go to Charlie's. I've tried a good portion of their menu, and it doesn't disappoint.  We go there for simple food with fresh ingredients, and that's what we get, just about every time.  Their beer selection is pretty good (not as good as Hopleaf's of course, but sometimes you just don't want to deal with Hopleaf's crowds) and the bartender makes a mean dirty martini.  The bartender (his name escapes me, older bald-ish guy)  is so nice, and last time we were there he gave my fiance a couple of free samples of beers he thought he'd like. I've been for brunch a couple of times, and their brunch menu is not as good as the lunch/dinner menu.  I would not return for brunch unless with others who suggested it, in which case I wouldn't protest.  There is not usually a very long wait for brunch, which is a huge plus in my mind. Would I make a special trip to Charlie's if I didn't live around the corner?  Probably not.  But we're fairly picky and would easily find another place if Charlie's wasn't hitting it's mark week after week.  Everyone needs their local watering hole, and Charlie's is ours.",0.9965,0.749,0.221,0.03,0.5593181818181817

I would have liked some AC. I dont like sweating a lot at dinner, or afterward. We actually left early because of it.",0.9792,0.749,0.199,0.052,0.5669444444444445
2006-08-12,4.0,"After walking around Market Days, a friend said I know this great place we can get some dinner and so we came here - they have a good selection of food options and everyone really enjoyed the food.  The item that looked really good was the steak sandwich that had blue cheese on it - it was huge!  I had the turkey burger that tasted like meatloaf lol!  I would recommend this place for sure!",0.983,0.654,0.346,0.0,0.6548611111111111
2006-07-23,3.0,"My girlfriend moved to Andersonville recently and we've spent the past few weeks getting to know this neighborhood that we'd never before visited. I'm always amazed to see Charlie's, perhaps the least interesting-looking place on that strip of Clark, packed almost every day/night.  We've been there twice, and each time the food and service was OK. A true 2.5-star if there ever was one. Hopefully our next visit will change my mind!",0.8984,0.849,0.151,0.0,0.28125
2006-04-18,4.0,"Some of my friends aren't impressed with the pub grub at Charlie's, but this is a very comfy neighborhood place to hang out. Stick to the ""blue plate"" kinds of entrees and you'll be satisfied - the portions are large. I like the chicken pot pie and the southern fried chicken, among others. Great selection of beer and wine, and on weekends they have a ""Make Your Own Bloody Mary"" bar. Fun.",0.9379,0.712,0.223,0.066,0.6315476190476191
2006-01-16,3.0,"I re-reviewed this place. Went here for dinner the other night and had their outstanding steak salad. The service was v. slow - but it was a beautiful night outside, so I wasn't bothered by it. If I'd have been on a schedule, I'd probalby  have been annoyed. The staff was very nice to my dog, though, so that gains points with me. Dogs are allowed outside on the sidewalk.",0.9429,0.73,0.227,0.042,0.56875

2005-07-13,3.0,"This place has a nice feel to it...hard wood floors and booths, tables an chairs. I've been here to eat and also to just get drinks. I got a flirtini which is a martini made with raspberry liquers and champagne. It was pretty good but the mint leaf in it has seen better days. They offer a big selection of beers and ciders which are fun to try. The food is okay. I had a chicken pesto wrap. It was kinda dry but the fries were good.",0.9593,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.6050000000000001
