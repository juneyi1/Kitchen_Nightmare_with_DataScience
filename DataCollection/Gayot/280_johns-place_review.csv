Service was a little slow but it seemed like there was only one waitress for our entire section. I started out with a bloody mary and it was tasty and worth the $6. For my starter I ordered the mexican hash (with my eggs poached) which was a huge plate of hash fried with shredded chicken and peppers with my eggs on top and a side of toast. A ton of food for a good price at $11. The only real problem I had with the place was the service. I don't know if it was the fact that any party our size has gratuity included so the waitress didn't really care or if the staff was stretched thin. Either way it was very disappointing since we wanted to get in multiple drink orders, and ask for extra napkins and silverware, and extra sauces/sides for our entree orders.",0.4104,0.799,0.116,0.085,0.5159523809523809

Small cubes of beef and a lot of warm flavors. What was lacking was the spice. What I usually expect out of chili and bit too many beans for me. Nothing really stuck out to me besides the meat.

The service is awful; lots of phones out and waiting around for the servers to finish chit-chatting before we were seen to. It seemed like the busboy/food-runners were the only ones keeping the place running at all.

Yum. But when it came to the table it was served on bread that looked hard as a rock and was multigrain something. I took 5 min to flag the waitress down since she was determined not to check up on us. I ask her about the bread and she says they are out. Which would have been great to know. I take a bite to find no sprouts either. My man and I finish food and were planning on ordering more drinks but after waiting 10+ minutes after our plates had been cleared we decided to take the check and bounce.  Fast forward to today, almost 2 months later. I decide to take the little munchkin out for lunch. We walk up at about 1pm and wait 10 minutes to be seated. Not because there was a wait but because no one acknowledged our presence. I order food right away and decide to get my same favorite sandwich. It gets delivered. Same stale looking bread.

Very Tasty! Maybe a little heavy on the cheese. My friend got the Combo and Chicken Sausage side. Both dishes came quickly and were gobbled down nearly as fast. I don't love that the fruit side is $4 and egg whites are extra, but in general the prices are very reasonable.

2011-06-28,2.0,"Dear John, It took so long for me to finally get to experience all of you after waiting all those years.  Yes, after all of those drives past, all of those aborted attempts to have brunch with you due to the undesirable wait and all of those sloughed off suggestions to patronize you while driving aimlessly in search of a destination for grub, I finally did experience you.  I experienced all of you.  And I wanted to reflect upon it all here in my letter to you, dear John. Driving aimlessly once again, the goal was to escape the mass dispersal of the crowds connected to the Pride Parade by driving west until there was daylight, which was somewhere around Sheffield.  That's when you popped into my head, John.  So I took the circuitous route and ultimately ended up with you on a cool Sunday evening.   Since it was a bit too cool to dine al fresco, we opted to enter the premises and dine inside.  It almost felt like the dinner scene at the resort in Once Upon a Time in America when Noodles and Deborah had the entire banquet hall to themselves (minus the elegance and service), as we had almost the entire place to ourselves.  There was only one other table occupied, with a family and kids.     We grabbed a high top table and perused the menu for drinks.  Then, we perused it a bit more.  You gave us a whole six or seven minutes to peruse the menu for drinks, John.  Finally, you took our drink orders.  Then, another six or seven minutes passed before two bottles of beer were delivered to our table.  Our orders were placed at that time, with both of us placing an order for soup. We waited for the alphabet soup.  Then, we waited some more.  The soup came out another 20 minutes later - two minutes before the entrees came out.  I'm sorry, John, but I'm no longer going to be interested in soup when my entree is served, so I proffered my bowl of soup, which was totally bland from A to Z, when you came back to check on me a few minutes later, figuring maybe it would be removed from the bill.   As for the entrees, the chicken sandwich was decent.  I actually thought, based on the menu, that it was going to be a chicken breast dinner, but out came a sandwich.  You might want to shore up that menu and make it more clear, John.  The fries that came with the chicken sandwich were horrible.  Five Guys tends to under cook its fries.  These fries were nearly raw on the inside.  The baked mac 'n cheese was just alright.   The worst part about you, John, was your service.  With two tables occupied in the entire restaurant, why was it such a long wait to get initial service?  Why was it such a long wait for drinks?  Why didn't you come back and ask if we wanted another drink?  And why were you downright rude once you walked away from our table?  I watched you walk away.  I saw the face.  Service isn't a big deal to me, but bad service is, and so is fake pampering.  And I've come off of hiatus to make light of it.   So, I get the bill, and there glaring at me in all of its six dollar glory is the bland bowl of soup I barely touched because it came out two minutes (if that) before my entree.  I don't dispute bills or beg for items to be removed, so I dutifully gave my plastic to you.  Oddly enough, another server came back with my card after running it.  I know our server didn't want to be there, but that's just plain bizarre.   As such, John, I regret to inform you that I do believe that our time has come to an end and that I'll have to be moving on for good.  I hate to be mean to you, dear John, but I'm afraid that you're going to be seeing me around from time to time.  Yes, I'm going to be one of those exes.  That's how it seems to work in this city anyway, so I'm sure you're used to it.  I'll be around now and again a few doors over at Mandy's.  She's delicious.  You're not.  I'm sorry.   Best, Mike K.",0.2836,0.864,0.074,0.061,0.557223285973286

That is really a good deal, I love me some choices! Everything is decently priced, although the salads were $11 and up, which always shocks me about salads these days. The tofu sandwich was pretty good, they give you a nice big portion of tofu. Side salad balsamic was also legit. Turkey burger looked awesome and sweet potato fries even better.

He loves the French Toast and side of Chicken Apple Sausage. I often order the Roscoe Village Omelet - goat cheese, leeks, onions, and tomatoes. I've never had an omelet before that I can honestly say ""melts in your mouth."" Omelets come with a choice of two sides - I get the fruit cup (bananas and strawberries) and an English muffin. Also, egg whites can be substituted which is a nice option if you are looking for a healthy choice.  The only downfall to this nice All-American Lincoln Park restaurant is the fact that it is too baby friendly. Honestly, I feel like John's place is the new Baby's R Us.  If you don't mind children running through the tables while you are enjoying your breakfast, hit up John's place! Also, I feel like it is slightly overpriced for brunch. My sister and I each had coffee and an omelet and our bill was $32 bucks, a bit much for some glorified eggs no matter how succulent they may be.

They're a bit much: the kids, their parents, their respective accessories. You all know the type. There's just too much going on. With that said, if you are looking for just such a dining destination, then I recommend John's Place freely. They are known to be very accommodating to families.  All of this is easily forgivable -- the widely monotone trend in clientele; the wild and crazy, crying little ones; the seemingly clueless staff -- if the restaurant itself weren't so mediocre and boring in every other possible way. I remember nothing of the service here. I'm not even sure if they have servers... The painfully safe selection of dishes are somehow still executed poorly, with plainly cheap product. If you're willing to walk the extra block or so, I'd recommend the menu (and service) at The Local Option (due east at 1102 W. Webster Ave.) over John's any day.  Still, John's Place has outdoor sidewalk seating, so if you're willing to spend money on open air for lunch, this is a great spot for you, too.  No, come to think of it, that's not true, either. If you want to spend money somewhere with open air dining and fairly decent food, with a better drink selection, then walk west to Charlie's On Webster (1224 W. Webster Ave at the intersection of Magnolia Ave.). I really see no purpose in spending money at John's Place.

There is a limited dessert menu (3 choices) so we took the Blondie brownie with ice cream.  Perfect to split and delicious.

I can't say much about meals other than brunch - I've been here for dinner just once & the food was mediocre, although the weekday wine specials do look pretty appealing.",0.93,0.837,0.163,0.0,0.6326923076923078
2006-10-24,1.0,"I found john's place to be ""just OK"" and even a little mediocre on the breakfast front.  Nothing was outstanding, nothing bad.  Every time I've ever walked by there was some sort of wait, we had to wait about 20 minutes or so. The thing that irks me the most is they have a ""no substitutions"" policy... I can understand not substituting for picky eaters, but some people have dietary needs that require alternate options. They seem to come with an ego, too..  Service wasn't that great.   The menu wasn't much different than most diner's I've been to.  Nothing new or interesting. There are a lot of options in the area for breakfast, and even more for dinner.",0.4405,0.87,0.081,0.049,0.56509324009324
2006-10-05,4.0,"This is a *great* restaurant that earnestly tries to incorporate healthy items into its menu.   I thought the brunch was average but I could eat their salads every night for dinner.  Amazing flavor and I've always had friendly, quick service.",0.9072,0.75,0.25,0.0,0.5642857142857143
2006-06-21,2.0,"Super snobby place, long wait and not-so great service. I feel like if you do not belong to a frat or sorority, you don't belong here. The food is ok and our server wasn't that great.

2006-05-16,4.0,"Okay, the verdict is out.  It's all about the Chilaquiles (which the rest of my fellow yelpers have yelped about already!)  I brought some friends here with my Mom and no joke each and everyone of us had the chilaquiles and we were happy campers.  I have dined here several times for dinner as well and have enjoyed the Mexican fare.  It is brunch overall and the wine specials that draw me in.",0.9324,0.755,0.218,0.026,0.3666666666666667
2006-05-08,4.0,I went to John's Place on a saturday morning and it was perfect.  We got there sort of early so we didn't have to wait at all for a table.  The chocolate chip banana pancakes were pretty good and the orange juice was freshly squeezed.  I don't know...nothing amazingly amazing (like everyone's said) but definitely cozy and the type of place that could become a weekend tradition.,0.7786,0.825,0.144,0.031,0.7214285714285714

2006-03-02,3.0,"At the urging of a friend, I had the Sweet Potato Puree recently--it was delicious!   The food is standardly good; there is nothing really ""standout"" on the menu.  The salads are good in taste and size.  But the 1/2 price wine deal on Tuesdays/Thursdays is a draw for mid-week dining. While the brunch may be good, keep in mind that John's Place is in a very residential part of Lincoln Park.  There are ALWAYS children here, along with their yuppie moms and dads.  So if you're looking for that kind of thing, this is your place.",0.9577,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.6062500000000001

Great salads, soups and sandwiches and decent wine selections; it's the perfect place to go before catching a movie at nearby Chicago Webster Place Movie Theaters. It also has outdoor seating and if you're lucky you can catch a little league game at the adjacent Oscar Mayer's baseball field.",0.9509,0.816,0.164,0.02,0.6324242424242423
