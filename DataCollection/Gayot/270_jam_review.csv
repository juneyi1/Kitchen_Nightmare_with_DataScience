2017-08-25,4.0,"I'm not sure why there are so many mediocre reviews for this place. We had a wonderful lunch experience on a random Thursday afternoon. Jam offers a seasonally rotating menu with delicious options all presented in an exceptional way. They take a regular brunch spot and go to the next level with unique variations on standard dishes like eggs Benedict and chicken & waffles.  They also take great pride in their coffee creations and I enjoyed a macchiato made to perfection while my husband had an o'Fallon wheat beer that you don't see often on menus.  The place is small but modern and clean with a great open patio that leads into the interior of the restaurant.  I ordered the hot chicken & waffles while my husband ordered the eggs Benedict and a half order of the French toast. Presentation, unique flavors, and perfect execution all led to a pretty fantastic experience for both of us. Service was friendly and relaxed and they were very accommodating for our newborn and stroller.  The place gets pretty crowded on weekends but I think we will be back on weekday afternoons to take advantage of such a great spot with no wait.",0.9956,0.715,0.266,0.019,0.6156611362493715

2017-07-24,4.0,"This is a retrospective review of my visit to JAM in the summer of 2016. I loved the restaurant so much I went there twice during my visit to Chicago. ****** 1st visit: After I arrived at Midway Airport I went straight to Logan Square, checked into my hotel, and dashed to JAM to eat before they closed. My server was Raquel and she was very pleasant and attentive. I ordered the Malted Custard French Toast and also an omelette with anchovies and chorizo. Yup, I ordered two entrees.  Both entrees were plated beautifully. The omelette probably needed more salt, but the egg mixture was perfectly mixed and cooked. Also loved the added anchovies. The french toast was just ridiculously good. So gooey. So sweet. Decadent.  2nd visit: Before going to the airport, I went back to JAM with some friends and had Raquel again as a server. Our table ordered the Malted French Toast, a pancake dish with peaches and a marshmallow on top, jowl bacon, Burrito Suizo, and an egg benedict dish. Everything was great except for the burrito suizo. ****** JAM is the kind of restaurant I wish existed in Durham NC (where I live). It's now 2017 and I still think about that place. The menu and some of the ingredients would be a little out of character in the South, but the unique ingredient combinations and the artistic plating would be such a refreshing welcome. The interior design is also fantastic. Love the gray walls, the concrete tables, and the clear chairs (I have the same chairs at home). I loved eating at JAM and love telling friends about the experience. I never knew breakfast food could be artistically plated until visiting JAM. When I visit Chicago again I'll definitely jam straight to this restaurant.",0.9979,0.75,0.241,0.009,0.5377314814814816

I have to say I was looking forward to trying a new spot, however was very disappointed with the service.  We arrived and the host told us there would be about 15 min wait. We waited for almost 1/2 hr and noticed 2 empty tables inside and 2 outside. We asked the host and he advised he had to make sure he was not skipping anyone before us. As far as we could tell there was no one else waiting. We waited and those tables continued to be empty. What we did see however was someone just walk from the street,point to a table and was seated right away, which was a family of 5. To be fair maybe they had been waiting left and came back - not sure but what really bothered me was the hos'ts attitude. He saw us walking away and did not even bother to stop us or even be apologetic. I hardly review, but this place service really left a bad impression. I kind of felt like he did not want to seat us.

The host at the door took our name and said there was a short wait so we decided to wait. It became awkward when we are the only 4 standing at the door and others were being seated before us. Granted we asked for an outdoor table so at this point we ask for any available, the host decides to look at his list and says, let me just make sure i don't have anyone waiting before you. He barely glanced at his paper and walked away. We all agreed to leave. As we walked out, the host passed us and did not say a word. Needless to say my experience here was enough to give it a bad review and would not recommend this place to anyone I know.

He said about out 15-20 min.  I said no problem we waited and waited and the table in the patio remained empty.  After 30 min of waiting I see a group of people walking in point at the table and our server gladly give it to them.  I went and said if at this point we could just have any table available outside or inside (there was another table available inside a group gave up because it was close to the entrance) he said oh no there may be others waiting.  Unless there's a secret spot for waiting guests I did not see another group aside from us waiting.  Wasn't sure if we were discriminated because of our ethnicity or our running gear.  We decided to not wait any longer and walked down the street to Cafe con  Leche where we had wonderful meal, service and ambiance.  Needless to say....I will not go back and will not recommended it to any of my friends!

After eating through two or three bites, both my friend and I could down the burger. It tasted like it was undercooked, even though it looked fully cooked. It tasted like iron and was super soggy.

I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, my fiancé ordered the omelet and our other friend ordered the Lamb and Grits.  Everyone said their food was okay, and I had to agree. It wasn't crazy amazing, but it wasn't awful either. The server was kind of MIA the majority of our time there. My food wasn't all that great after, especially after I took a few bites and found a hair FRIED INTO MY CHICKEN.  Which I kind of understand shit happens. Whatever, but when I told my waitress about it, I got an annoyed look... It's not my fault there was a hair, and it's clearly not mine, and it's also VERY CLEARLY COOKED INSIDE THE CHICKEN.  But I got a 'new' plate, but I did notice instead of just giving me a completely new plate, my lipstick was still on the little piece of cabbage or leafy stuff under the chicken... So they pretty much just gave me a new piece of chicken. I thought that was gross as fuck and super petty. Can I just get a new dish? It's not like I ate half of it, I literally took two bites before I noticed the hair.  Also I would think, from working in the industry for a long time, that like I would get a free dessert, or comp the coffee, or even the dish itself. But nothing.  So we quickly left and I still tipped because I am not a terrible person. But it was just an awful experience and such a waste of money. And I REALLY wanted to love this place.

All without prompt. Plates were quickly swept away when done.  - Food: impeccable!  Mimosa was the perfect ratio.   Table ordered the custard French toast to share (per recommendation from Derek) and must I say it is a must order at JAM. It's probably the best French toast I've ever had the honor to taste.  I ordered the omelette with anchovies. It had a side of grilled cornbread, some kind of tomato compote and arugula. Flavors were amazing; eggs were cooked to perfection (firm on the outside but silky on the inside); and everything on the dish complimented well.

2017-05-22,5.0,"JAM is one of those places that after dining here, I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Every bite of food was just delicious - and my friend and I tried a ton! I think it is the best breakfast place in Logan Square. Yes, it's better than Lula and with a much shorter wait (Pro-Tip: Lula Cafe is better for dinner). My friend and I came Saturday morning for a bite to eat and were able to snag the final table in their beautiful indoor/outdoor space. Our server was friendly throughout our meal and passed no judgment when we ordered a beastly amount of food. Hot Chicken & Waffles ($16) -  Boneless fried thigh, sourdough waffles, and pimenton gastrique. Every dish we tried was fantastic but this was my favorite of the three. The chicken was crisp on the outside with great flavor and moist on the inside. Waffles were tasty and that spicy gastrique gave me life! It was honestly everything. Eggs Benedict ($13) - Served with a huge amount of pork belly on top of their unique spin of carbs, two poached eggs, and a pesto sauce I just couldn't get enough of. Another dish that just hit it out of the park. I kept trying to get as much of the sauce as possible in each bite. Every element was amazing on its own and went in perfect harmony so well together. Smoked Salmon ($16) - Served over leek cakes and a kohlrabi slaw, again with two perfectly done poached eggs and bernaise sauce. Third favorite dish of the day, but still very solid. We loved every ingredient and seriously - JAM does poached eggs right. They are on point! Green Apple Juice ($4) - So fresh, so legit and truly tasted like biting right into an apple. So glad I tried this summery hand-squeezed juice. Did I mention the plating of every dish looked like a piece of art? I love when food is not only tasty in my belly, but a feast for my eyes, as well.

Loved the fluff it cut through the sweetness my only complaint is put more nuts for crunch and something to cut through the sweetness its not to sweet but complexity would enhance the dish Chicken waffles 16 best chicken and waffles i ever had. Chicken supper moist n crispy. The gastrique is sweet and spicy which cut through the richness. The pickles added acidity. The waffles were sweet n supper fluffy so much complexity  French toast $7 amaizin the french toast is sweet without being supper eggy or hard its really moist which i like, the cheeries are supper tart to cut through the sweetness. Then the whipcream is amaizin theres pink pepper corns in it n like zest which cuts through the sweetness only complaimt put more pepper corns n like zest n add something crunchy its a very mushy dish if you could you a fancier more flavorful bread that would be better too Asparagus soup 4 not my fav really fresh tasting but no seasoning jus tasted like blended asparagus  Lamb &grits 16 wasnt my favorite. Its a very one note dish everything was bland even the merguez didnt have much flavor  Smoked Salmon 16$ not yr typical overly salty smokey salmon its made in house very delicate dish. The poatoe leek cakes were so tasty loved the crunchy sweet onion flavor just put more. The bearnaise sauce was so rich just put more. Loved the salad to cut through the richness my only complaint is to add hot sauce for pop i did that n it made the dish better Cinnabon $4 amaizin. The best Cinnabon i ever had. The Cinnabon is fresh not old dry or cold. Its not supper sweet because the glaze has acidity in it. My only complaint is put more components like more brown sugar inside more nuts and more glaze  Raspberry Coffee cake $4 good not great kind of one note was moist though wasnt as good as the Cinnabon",0.9968,0.641,0.241,0.117,0.5796153846153846

It's thick, smokey and packed full of flavor. Nice garnishes to boot.  It's an elevated brunch - so when you order Egg Whites what you actually get are poached egg whites with polenta, sweet potato puree, sage turnips, etc. I'm still trying to figure out how they get the yolk out and maintain that round egg shape. Life is more fun with a mystery. I like that I can order one Cinnamon roll as a side.

After staring at the menu for some time, I opted for the egg white dish. It was definitely not what I expected.

2017-01-14,3.0,"The only thing I liked here was the brunch punch, which the day we went was a reinvented Moscow Mule. We arrived at 9:30 and were one of only a few tables on a Saturday morning. By the time we left a touch before 11, there was a massive wait. So if you're going to go, do it at a breakfast time to avoid the wait.  As for food, I was genuinely not impressed with anything. Now, I am a hardcore Sweet Brunch girl. Brunch is an excuse to eat dessert for a meal. The chef at Jam clearly disagrees. We tried the honey cakes, which were drenched in a not particularly sweet citrus glaze and every bite with the sesame brittle just tasted like char. My friend figured out that if you cut up the slices of blood orange on top into pieces and made sure to get some of that with each piece of brittle, the orange at least neutralized the brittle. The much-lauded French toast was a bit gooey for me and didn't have any flavor unless you put the star fruit on top... in which case it just tasted like star fruit on toast.   The pecan roll was cold and absolutely drowning in yet another sugar-sapping citrus sauce. My friend thought the dough was overworked, I thought it was just still too chilled. Either way, it tasted like any cinnamon roll that you've put in your fridge and tried to eat cold the next day. It's still edible, but it's certainly not what you'd expect from a restaurant.  The breakfast meats were fine and cooked properly. And it's not that anything other than maybe the pecan roll was cooked incorrectly. But unless they can figure out how to use those technical skills to make an unabashedly sweet dish, I won't be back.",0.8285,0.881,0.08,0.039,0.5229129923574368

One my friends confirmed and said he thought it tasted awful. I know that they serve Metropolis coffee, and I love Metropolis coffee, but it did not taste good. Maybe Jam's water was not good that day. In any case, much to the waiter's surprise, we ask to have it taken away...he graciously took it off of our bill. I ordered the malted custard french toast with pink peppercorns. The taste was outstanding, but I found to be lukewarm (service was slow) and a hair in the dish after I had finished most of it. My other friend ordered pancakes and said that they were okay, nothing special. My other friend ordered a breakfast panini of sorts...he said it was great.

I realize it was starting to become a lunch rush, so I opted to skip waiting for them to remake the dish. The server came back and said the chef would ""only charge you half price"".  If I thought it was an honest mistake before, I decided at that point the chef was being rude. I would've paid full price for no hair in my food, so I was flabbergasted. This was the chef being too busy to talk to me about it and look at the dish which, as I looked up, sat on the bar unmoved and unviewed by the chef.

2016-07-24,5.0,"This is one of the best places for breakfast in the city of Chicago, HANDS DOWN! They open every day at 7, like every serious breakfast restaurant should, and they have a menu that noplace else in the city of Chi-town can touch. The Smoked Salmon is smokin'. Period. It is chunk style (check pics) and comes with a flat potato-leek cake, poached eggs with the white completely solid, covered in a bearnaise sauce. The Quiche I would order again. Everyone seems to allude to gigantic portions here but mine was just fine and did not distend me to discomfort. It was just right portion-wise, and the best quiche I have ever enjoyed in my life. I could actually live on this quiche alone from this point on.  However, the pièce de résistance is the Malted Custard French Toast. Just explaining that it is made with macerated stonefruit, lime leaf cream and pink peppercorns does not even lend an inkling to the orgasmic explosion of taste bud joy that will light your oral cavity up like a taste tunnel to a heavenly world of flavor. Your euphoric receptors will be firing neurons like submachine guns in your brain with this menu selection folks. It flattened all other competitive menu selection opinions at the table and everyone in our party had to try it. The sign marking the building is small but the restaurant is in a white building with a little outdoor dining area. On Sunday mornings in the summer, the Logan Square Farmer's Market opens at 10:00 even though most of the vendors are set up by 9:30, so a 7 or 8 o'clock breakfast could nicely turn into a pleasant stroll through one of the nicest Farmer's Markets in Chicago. The restaurant is only a few steps from the market so your parking place can serve a double purpose in waiting for you to finish your enjoyment. Try this place and please let me know if you agree. The price is perhaps a little high, but we have gotten much less pleasure for $18/person plenty of times in our breakfast restaurant careers, so we gave the cost a bye.

2016-02-17,4.0,"I'll get it out of the way to begin with: For a breakfast and brunch place, JAM creates and plates their dishes exquisitely. Chicago has no shortage of places to have breakfast and brunch, and on that matter, restaurants exclusively devoted to breakfast and brunch. Several of my friends have encouraged me to try JAM, and I finally did this past weekend. I was taken in by the large, glass windows which let a lot of natural light into the front of the restaurant. I commend JAM for many of the interior details--noticeable, but not distracting. Well, except for the lime-green placemats. They looked like, or were, IKEA flexible chopping boards. I'm not saying I didn't approve of them, but in a place so refined as JAM, they stood out. (In some ways, I think it made the cleanness of the white plates stand out more.) My counterparts ordered Eggs Benedict and Egg Whites, respectively. All dishes, like mentioned, were plated beautifully, but the Eggs Benedict took the prize. For some reason, I feel awful taking photographs in restaurants, so I will have to rely on my words. The plating of the Benedict was such an elegant homage to the traditional dish with an almost 'cubist' feel--I'm not sure how to accurately describe it. Served with pork belly and a maitake mushroom hollandaise, it looked and smelled perfectly rich and balanced. The Egg Whites were served with polenta, salsify soffritto, fermented kohlrabi, and a cilantro ancho chile vinaigrette--Meagan assured me it was perfectly portioned and full of flavor. I, on the other hand, ordered the Egg Sandwich, a massive conglomeration of pork shoulder, two over-easy eggs, ricotta, plum preserve, and, if that wasn't enough carbs, roasted fingerling potatoes. Not to say it didn't taste or look any less elegant--because it was just that--but I ended up eating half the sandwich without the top bun.  Coffee, as expected, was rich and to the quality of the menu's offerings. Service was concerted and deliberate, making sure we had what we needed without being too overbearing. Most of my dining experiences are with my friend, or with him and his fiancé. While we love going to West Town Bakery on a semi-regular basis, dining at JAM is like splurging on heated seats, integrated navigation, parking assist, and leather in the new car you'll buy--but then realizing that it was already included in the base model.

Its a very unique take on classic french toast dish. I also love their farro salad. It is my favorite salad, however, the last time I had it they did not have grapefruit pieces in it, which was disappointing. I am hoping this was also just a fluke and they will add in the grapefruit again. The smoked salmon dish is also one of my favorites. They also have some delicious breakfast cocktails.

2015-11-28,4.0,"Honestly not sure why JAM doesn't have good reviews here on Yelp. They offer unique takes on traditional brunch options, and the food is extremely solid if not amazing, especially given the prices.  I got the eggs benedict, which was hands down the best eggs benedict I've had. The pork belly was crispy, and the maitake infused hollandaise sauce brought the dish together with its delicious creaminess. I also loved how the poached eggs were topped with a bit of microgreens, which balanced out what would have been an extremely rich dish. I also tasted some of my friends' french toast, waffles, and quiche. I liked the consistency of the french toast but found them a bit soggy; however, the waffles and quiche both were done extremely well and something I would love to try next time I come by. JAM has got its food game down; I'd rank it as one of the top brunch places I've been to in Chicago, right next to The Winchester and Dusek's.",0.9687,0.814,0.157,0.029,0.5584325396825397

2015-11-14,2.0,"Just came home from meeting a friend for brunch there. Totally unimpressed. The waiter opened by recommending the French toast.  I debated between the signature French Toast and the lemon pancakes and he said to stick to the French Toast, people leave half the pancake uneaten.  So I ordered the single slice of French Toast -  ...and left more than half of it on my plate uneaten. Soggy, cold, under cooked, heavy as heck with a not quite cooked flavor and more bread pudding than French Toast, it lacked the requisite crisp exterior and was bland as well no cinnamon, no browned butter crust to contrast to the rather raw tasting center. It was served with ""stone fruit"" which was fine, but  only a small  amount and insufficient to compensate for the lack of flavor in the toast itself. .It was also already cold by the time I got it, and the flavored whipped cream had half melted on one side, making it even soggier. Since I am not a cream fan and was planning on just ignoring it, having it all melted was not a plus. If something is served with cream, it should be served right away.  I had not eaten before I went, and only had a green salad for dinner the night before so I should have been hungry but still, I couldn't force myself to eat it and like I said, left more than half on the plate. And I came home still hungry. If this is the signature dish, sign off on going.  Aside from the bad recommendation, the service was good and discrete. And they have the visuals of plating down fine. It is the actual food that is the issue.  The ambiance is fine and I got to see my friend but the food. was not worth the $7 for one slice.",0.003,0.866,0.066,0.069,0.3870489078822412

2015-11-02,3.0,"Jam 3/5 stars Went to Jam the day after a Halloween party so I'll try to keep the rating as least bias as possible seeing how I was a bit hungover. I was glad the staff was friendly to us because we walked in at 2:30p when they close at 3p, I know that can be a touchy thing, and I would've gone sooner if I could have. I don't care too much for decor, but I will say this place had an elegant bomb dropped inside. The simpleness of the wall design, open kitchen, and use of mirrors really opened up the restaurant. I really enjoyed their take on sconces with the ingenious light bulb, which I've only seen once before. I would've really liked to take a picture, but the struggle to hike over for one wasn't worth the effort. There was group of girls next to us who lost their voice from the night before, yet continued to yell in a raspy manner that hurt my ears.  I was stuck on the pastrami sandwich, but decided to get the egg sandwich with the pork shoulder, because double meats just sounded really good at the time. The yolk oozed in a manner that can only delight my hungry stomach and slurped up that goodness! For some reason, there was too much juice in the sandwich: from the egg? the pork shoulder? idk, but it made my bread so soggy that I ditched my hands and used my utensils pretty early into the sandwich, which was very difficult at the time and kind of ruined my sandwich. I saw them butter and grill the bread, I just wish it had a better crisp to it. Oh, their knife was really nice and took a pic of it. Yea, the little things tend to get me. You could tell their Metropolis coffee wasn't just any cup of Joe, but wasn't exactly MY cup to drink (I'm a huge Dark Matter fan). Maybe the beans weren't as fresh, or it just sat in the carafe a bit longer than usual.  My friend got the Jamburger, but since they were out of buns the chef recommended the ciabatta instead. I was starving at the time, so I also ordered to share their special of the day: french toast. It was $12 for 2 slices..... $6 a slice..... it was good, but not worth $6 slice good. My friend was waaaay to nauseous to eat, so I apologized to her as I was scarfing down my food with her head in her hands. What? Was I not supposed to eat? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'd like to go back when I'm a bit more coherent so I can enjoy the food a bit more. Looking back, that burrito suizo sounded really good. edit: btw, this is my first review and am having difficulty uploading my pics. Will update when I can bc that knife tho!!  update:  Figured out how to upload pics.

I got their cheddar waffle of the day which came of course with some fried chicken and that fried chicken was so juicy and tender and perfect. The waffle itself actually could have been a little crispier especially to hold up to the fried chicken on top. But that dish was pretty great. And then Matt J. got their burrito suizo which was a wheat crepe packed and I mean PACKED with all kinds of braised beef, tomato crema, gouda, and an egg. There was so much meat in that bad boy it was so incredibly filling, and we definitely had to go home and take a nap after that one.

We ordered the french toast as our server recommended it and it was absolutely by far the best french toast we have ever had.  It delivered on every note and the best part was you do not even need syrup - it is that flavorful. We also split the egg sandwich with pork shoulder . The pork was so good - flavorful and tender. You have to try it- it is just that good.

We got a complimentary cookie which was a nice touch and yummy.

2015-02-17,4.0,"Very clean and inviting ambience. We were given two complimentary mini chocolate cupcakes to start, which was nice. These were ordinary but the coffee-like buttercream was divine. Got the omelette and thought it was pretty tasty, although most of it attributing to the piquillo peppers. The chorizo and onions were lackluster. However, I enjoyed that it wasn't your traditional omelette. It was light and refreshing, but packed with ingredients. The accompanied corn bread was very good, considering I don't usually care too much for corn bread. Cousin enjoyed his pork shoulder egg sandwich. We also split the full order of French toast and that was delish. It was amazing on its own, but the lime leaf cream and macerated cherries really kicked it up a notch. Service overall was decent.

2015-02-14,5.0,"I don't understand why Jam's rating is so low - both of my experiences were phenomenal! The first time I went, it was over the summer. My friend from school was visiting for the weekend, and after much deliberation between Jam and Lula's we decided to go to Jam. They had opened up their patio, so even though we were technically sitting indoors, the fresh breeze and summer lightheartedness of Logan Square still put a smile on our faces (as cheesy as that sounds). My friend ordered the chicken and waffles, I ordered the quiche, and we split a half order of the french toast. I still rave about that quiche to all my friends when the topic of brunch comes up! The bagel chips added crunch to the otherwise soft quiche, and the bits of trout added the perfect amount of flavor to the dish. Jam's quiche is by far the tastiest quiche I've ever had. We were similarly pleased by the french toast - the custard was perfectly creamy and the entire thing just exploded in our mouths. We raved about our food for pretty much the remainder of the meal! The next time I went, it was with a few more friends from school and everyone was highly complimentary of my decision to go here.

2015-01-19,3.0,"My first thought, upon regarding the menu: this place is prett-y expensive.  I've been to some 'fancy' brunch places before, but this one is a bit pricey for what it's doing.  The Bloody Mary was like $11. Seriously?  It's like tomato juice, spices, and vodka.  I can't imagine more than $7, tops.  The server also asked if I wanted a ""chaser"" beer, which I agreed to thinking it was a tiny, cute bottle of Miller High Life, but it was actually just a full-size, $5 beer which was too much all around. The menu was large enough but, again, all the entrees were super expensive.  They said they had the ""best waffles in the city"" so maybe that's just what I should have ordered, but I went with something that looked intriguing.  The spaetzle with beets and a poached egg ended up being watery and oddly sweet.  I wasn't impressed with the overall flavor, even though the individual ingredients seemed promising together in a dish.  I definitely wouldn't order it again.   My experience here makes me think a lot of their menu items are similarly overdone, even breakfast classics like eggs Benedict or other things.  I don't know if I'll be back and that's alright with me.  Also, parking is near impossible on Sundays, so beware.",0.9904,0.771,0.191,0.038,0.5059347442680777

They do that whole double patty thing I'll never get as I'm usually a 1 patty, super rare kind of burger eater. That being said, the burgers were incredibly juicy and visibly medium rare. Having eaten this twice now, I can say it's simplicity & freshness make it one of my favorite Chicago burgers. Not to mention the fried egg on top visually is rivaled only by Little Goat.  On my second visit I ordered essentially a burrito suizo. It was much smaller than I expected but then again this is fancy food so I wasn't too surprised. It was also exceptionally tasty, although i felt it needed some more spice kick.  My only real complaint was the bacon maple Manhattan. It was super heavy on maple syrup and tasted good but was sweet. That being said, it has nothing on The Southern's maple bacon bourbon Manhattan's dry bacon-centric taste. The ambiance is pretty cool here and one of my favorite spots. It's this mix of suble yet high fashion simplicity that I really enjoy.

Malted custard french toast with macerated cherries, lime leaf cream, pink peppercorns (4/5) - The weakest part of this was actually the bread itself.

Tasty-sounding, but not tasty-tasting.  My potatoes were waaay overcooked, my roommate's highly-anticipated brown sugar bacon sausage tasted neither of brown sugar nor bacon (""Man, did they pick this up at Aldi?"").  His eggs benedict were ""passable, but nothing special"".  My egg sandwich with pork shoulder was a little better, but the pork shoulder was probably braised in too much liquid, since about a half cup of water was pooled on my plate after the first few bites.  All in all, pretty mediocre food. Our waiter was nice enough, but we wondered why the coffee took longer to serve than the food we ordered.  My roommate joked that if we'd walked over to New Wave and ordered coffee there, we could have drank it and walked back to our table without missing a beat.

2014-03-24,4.0,"I've been sitting on how to best describe JAM to the masses now that I've had two days to think about it, so here's what I'll go with: If you are a foodie, you'll love everything about JAM, and you'll love being able to tell your friends about the macerated fruit, the ____-____ emulsions and the tasting items before your meal.  And you won't mind paying $12 for an omelette. If you just like to eat breakfast, don't go to JAM, because the food will be mostly inaccessible to you.  You'll notice the fact that your food is served lukewarm (intentionally, from all that I can tell), and be unhappy about that, because at the diners you normally hit for breakfast, hotcakes are served hot, etc.  But if you are with friends who are foodies, order the French toast, because it is exceptional no matter how high-end your tastes are. Our server was great, and was kind to explain to me the three or four terms on the menu that I had never seen before (note: I've been to 300+ restaurants since moving to Chicago 19 months ago, so this is saying something).  The space is nice and if you go at 9 AM on a Saturday, you can walk right in.  But the food--the Funfetti tasting item, the omelette, the bacon sausage, the eggs benedict--was mostly okay to the three of us, but none of us are foodies in the traditional sense.  But the six-star French toast was so good (did that as an appetizer) that I'm willing to give JAM four stars.",0.9657,0.886,0.101,0.013,0.6216165413533835

2014-03-09,5.0,"My sis brought me here for brunch one morning. She has good taste, but my standards are quite particular. Could JAM withstand the rigor? ***MALTED CUSTARD FRENCH TOAST  - Macerated Cherries, Lime Leaf Cream, Pink Peppercorns I asked for some maple syrup when our server mentioned that this dish wouldn't be served with any. She said I wouldn't need any and brought only a tiny portion. I requested a bit more. But dammit, she ended up being right, it didn't need even one drop!  Dear reader, human language cannot express the beauty and warmth that I felt as this soft, velvety French toast entered my mouth. The bread tasted like they'd made it from scratch--thick, supple, & mildly sweet. I don't even care for cherries generally, but these macerated beauties were absolutely gorgeous, not too tart or bold, just right. And that glorious cream with the essence of lime and pink peppercorn--I remember sneering to myself that pink peppercorn on whipped cream was just a play for indie street cred, but upon tasting it, I repented in sackcloth and ashes--this flavor, along with the lime, defined the dish and changed my life.  ***JOWL BACON Don't get me wrong, it was really solid bacon, but it tasted just like, errr, bacon. It's my belief that the jowls of this animal are best celebrated in ramen, which preserves the golden essence of this cut.  ***BURRITO SUIZO - Buckwheat Crêpe, Braised Beef, Tomato Crema, Jardinière, Smoked Gouda, Sunnyside Egg I'm generally not a big fan of breakfast burritos, and this dish (which my sister ordered) didn't sound very appealing whatsoever. But when she offered me a bite, I quickly repented of my hasty judgment--the beef was tender enough to cut with a spoon, incredibly savory and a bit tangy. And that smoked Gouda, oh sweet divine--it felt almost like Emmentaler in this presentation. I found myself begging for bite after bite, and it's not like my dish wasn't the best ever.  ALL IN ALL: These two dishes, one sweet and one savory, were the perfect balance for the perfect brunch. I'm trying to wrap my head around the negative reviews here--usually I'm usually the one to play the heel.

No waiting. The service here was one of the worst I had experience in a while.  Our waiter came by shortly after we sat down to take drink orders.  The table all just took water, but I ordered coffee with soy milk.  I don't know where they were getting this coffee from, but I didn't receive my cup of coffee until 15-20 minutes later.  Upon receiving the cup of coffee, I never received the soy milk or sugar.  10 minutes later, I finally received my soy milk without any sugar.  Had to wait again for another couple of minutes for the sugar.  Great! Now my coffee is cold.  In between this whole entire process with my coffee, our waiter never came by to take our food order.  We flagged him down a couple of times and he kept telling us he'll be with us in a moment.  Finally, after almost 40 minutes, he came back to take our order.  I ordered the egg sandwich.  It came with pork shoulder, ricotta salata, and plum preserves on French bollo bread.  It also was accompanied with some roasted fingerling potatoes.  They didn't go cheap with the pork and it was really tender, but the sandwich itself was lacking flavor and dry.  Overall, JAM was a huge disappointment.  I expected more from the famous Chef Jeffrey Mauro (formerly of Charlie Trotter and North Pond.)  The presentation of each dish was stunning, but the food wasn't on par.  The service lacked even more.  Definitely steer clear of this place unless you just want some mediocre food and horrible service.",0.8663,0.89,0.068,0.043,0.49544753086419746

2013-11-09,4.0,"Recently moving to Logan Square, I jumped at the first opportunity I could to visit the highly-rated Jam. I brought along my hubby, recently transplanted friend (from miami, she crazy like me) and her date. I always try to pick an exceptionally good spot when I have a crowd and I knew I'd be getting praised for this one. We went for Sunday brunch and got there around noon. We were quoted a 30 minute wait, which was another reason why I picked this and not another popular place around the corner with hour-long waits *cough*. Precisely 31 minutes after, we were prompted to take a seat. The restaurant was really cute, with a minimalist, modern feel. The sleek, simplistic decor gave it an extra trendy feel. The patrons varied from couples, to big groups of BYOBers to parents sippin' bloody maries while holding their infants, your typical Logan Square mixture of peeps. Our server approached us and right from the start was amazing. Even though we knew he was probably up to his ears with guests, he made it seem like we were the most important priority at the moment.  After ordering coffees, we were brought amuse brouche, essentially mini brownies sent from the pastry gods. These little bites leave you needing (more like fiending) a sweet meal after, so I was thrilled when my friend ordered the pumpkin pancakes (a seasonal item, score!).  I ordered the smoked salmon as did her date and my hubby ordered the burrito suizo. When our food arrived, I noticed the silverware was the exact one I had in my house! I knew i had good taste when I picked that out ;).  Anyway, the food was amazing. My salmon was perfect, and I'm exceptionally picky about smoked salmon as I've been traumatized with freezing fish before. The pumpkin pancakes were divine. They're now in my top 5 pancakes in the city. OMG, I need them in my life on a regular basis. My only gripe was my hubby's suizo. He said felt the meat was a little fatty, but in Jam's defense, he has been on a mostly-vegetarian diet and his belly may have not been used to such a big, meaty dish.  At this time, there were still a lot of other people waiting to be seated, so after we enjoyed our yummy meals, we got out to let another group have a seat.

The pleasure here does not stop with the cocktails, however.  My amuse bouch was a muffin for munchkins, and had lovely sweet notes of brown sugar.  The pecan sticky bun was sweet without being cloying, and the eggs benedict, while being small, are delicious - some of the best in the city.  The eggs are not at all watery, the greens are delicious, and it comes with a hefty serving of sausage.  Add to this Metropolis coffee and not too long a wait and you have yourself an excellent brunch option in Logan Square when Lula and Longman are overwhelmed.",0.9967,0.682,0.318,0.0,0.706923076923077
2013-11-02,3.0,"First, I am just going to put in my own gripe based only on my preferences and personality.  We had the misfortune of being seated right next to a very loud couple, less than two feet away. Her laugh pierced my ear, I couldn't hear my husband, the language was a tad strong for me. She seemed well aware of her volume, but laughed it off. Unfortunately, the couple on the other side of them joined in and increased the volume by a couple of decibels. It made my overall experience terrible. I didn't really enjoy the food as much as I probably could have since I just wanted to get out of there.   Now, on to what you probably really care about: service and food. Server was attentive and timely, though the place was pretty busy. Their menu was a bit limited, I guess in the interest of doing a few things very well. For the price, I felt the portions were small. My omelet looked like they had cooked it, folded it, and then cut off the end. It just seemed short. Furthermore, I couldn't really taste the Spanish chorizo. The onions and peppers were delicious, but I was disappointed by the lack of chorizo. My husband got their chicken n waffle special, and it was respectable.  The portions were lacking. We didn't feel completely satisfied. The taste wasn't exceptional to us. We probably will not make an effort to return, though I'm glad this place seems to have found a niche in Logan Square.",0.9705,0.746,0.164,0.09,0.5252314814814815

The service was poor, as we heard about the specials for our server telling the tables next to us when they were seated. And they sounded great. The  atmosphere is modern with thick plastic chairs that look like glass and really cool and heft silverware. The food looks good on the menu but is rather tasteless when eating.  Due to the poor service, it took way to long for us to get anything our children, who go often to another local brunch place, were constantly asking to leave and the place seemed welcome to the idea.

But I would not have written a bad review if lackluster service were the only problem. The food here was underwhelming bordering on unappealing. As a vegetarian there were few options for me, I tried the egg white dish. I love egg whites, but these were a little too undercooked, and were floating in a pool of some sort of beet foam jam. I love beets, but the combination was too earthy for an egg dish. My companion's egg  and chorizo omlette was not tasty and the optional sardines that were not asked about, were front and center on the top of the dish. gross. she said the eggs and chorizo both tasted cheap - which is inappropriate considering the small brunch portions averaged $13 each.  I also found it really pretentious and rude that apparently Jam frowns upon substitutions and omissions, but doesn't just have a written policy on the topic. My companion tried to order 2 separate dishes and omit the cheese because it doesn't agree with her. Instead of just politely saying substitution could not be accommodated, instead the waitress wrinkled her nose and looked conflicted. She promised to check with the kitchen to see if this could be done, but in the end the food was delivered with cheese and without comment or apology.

Area around the place is decent and felt safe. Restaurant is part of a small strip of places in a gentrified little area with a small patio of outside seating that overlooks the wide, leafy street and boulevard. Inside, the modern decor is bright and open. Service: our server was relatively new but she was friendly and talkative. Our food was bought promptly and each dish is explained. Food: we were lucky to go on a Tuesday when they do a prix fix brunch menu (about $25) which allowed us to try several things, unusual in a breakfast place. We did two of those and ordered two items off the menu, a stuffed French toast and a chorizo omelet. Everything was good with some excellent bites as well. We were all brought a little muffin to start. It was moist and flavorful. The four course prix fix meal started with something I can't remember but it was very good. The second thing was a little waffle triangle with fruit, also good and then eggs Benedict and finally a panna cotta. The best thing though was the French toast which was creamy and fluffy and flavorful and literally some of the best French toast any of us had ever had. The omelet was also excellent, a beautiful presentation (all the food is presented artfully) with such a smooth egg wrapped around tasty and balanced filling. Is Spanish chorizo but it wasn't too hard, spicy and chewy with peppers and cheese.   Drinks: bloody Mary's were exceptional, with rich, intense tomato and spice flavor and served with all kinds of fun little things, cheese and celery.

2013-08-02,2.0,"Dear JAM, Why are you trying to ruin French Toast? It does not need lime and peppercorn flavors. What kind of person does that to something so sweet and delicious? It's like a cruel trick you are playing on my tastebuds and, thereby, my heart. The bread itself is so fantastic I couldn't believe how wildly off base the rest of the dish was. Also, $6 for a SINGLE SLICE? The cruelty abounds!  I will now provide a short list of toppings that better pair with French Toast: maple syrup, whipped cream (not infused with lime or other citrus), chocolate, vanilla sauce of some kind, mascarpone, butter, bananas, strawberries.  I understand that these are all standard fare and JAM is about breaking the mold. You are welcome to try, as you are well aware given that you've already opened and been operating for some time, but playing around with something so inherently perfect makes you subject to me comparing your food to that time Pitbull remixed Daft Punk's ""Get Lucky."" Side note, your omelette with Spanish chorizo, onions, peppers, etc. should be at least a little spicy. I found mine to be rather bland, and I do not appreciate the audacity you have to suggest adding an achovy on top.  Your coffee is fantastic as is your decor. Even your name is awesome in its simplicity. Have you considered just making your French Toast with a variety of awesome JAMs that don't try to mess with my psyche?

Reasonably priced but one of the garnishes (I forget what it was) was smoked, and it overpowered the entire drink. Fortunately, when our food arrived, it more than made up for my cocktail. There was a chicken and waffle special posted on the board that day and the more I saw it while we were waiting for our table, the more I had to have it - and boy was it worth the wait. I believe the waffle was lemon thyme flavored, and then the chicken thigh was perfectly fried, moist and delicious. THEN its all topped off with this absolutely fabulous syrup. SO WONDERFUL.

We also got the malted custard french toast. This is award winning and as good as it sounds. I was in food heaven! We had these items for lunch. The portions were huge, but I did not leave Jam overly stuffed, which is a good thing since we were headed back to the office.  Our server was amazing!

Everything on the menu sounded good and inventive but I was not impressed with the execution of either of our entrees. We shared the Egg Sandwich, $13, Pork Shoulder, Ricotta Salata, Plum Preserve, French Bollo, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes. The pork shoulder was plentiful and very tender but I thought the sandwich overall lacked flavor with just an egg and smidge of plum preserve.  We also split an appetizer portion of the special which was Pot Roast and Waffle for $9. A large portion of tender pot roast in gravy over 1/4 waffle, it was good but just didn't really come together for me, no wow factor. We were in the front room which was nice though a bit chilly on a cold winter day. Our server was very chromaticism and helpful. There was a very odd smell of something cooking coming from the bar or adjoining open kitchen which definitely did not improve my dining experience.

2013-02-11,4.0,"Today I decided to treat myself since I've been eating cheaply and nothing of substance all last week. It was a Monday afternoon of no make-up, oily hair and a ratty sweater (I'm saying this like it's uncommon for any other day) which clearly stated the message I was trying to deliver: I don't give a FUCK.  Due to my attire, I figured I'd take something out and return to my cave filled with blankets and Arrested Development for the umpteenth time. But the friendly waiter seemed so jovial, the place mostly empty aside from a table of detestable Logan Square people and the menu said something about a waffle. I guess if I was going to subject anybody to my ""I love you but I've chosen comics"" shirt from Challengers Comics, it would be these people. Free advertising wink. My server Ryan was friendly and accommodating. I, of course, returned the hospitality by never looking him in the eye once because I was busy staring out the window or at my food. Every time he was forced to put a plate down in front of this bogtrotter who was constantly texting, I sent out invisible waves in my mind saying ""It'll all be worth it! Somehow!"" Note: An amuse bouche cookie will always help. If it didn't, then you'd have really been in trouble. But a good little lemon cookie, mmm. First, I had the chicken and waffle half portion, which some people complain how slightly more upscale restaurants control plate sizing, it actually helps me at times because my mind's eye of appetite is much bigger than actually available stomach hard drive. The chicken was beautifully cooked, even the horrible hipsters next to me took a break from talking about tumblr portfolio stats and ""the nazi pope"" to notice. The waffle was good too but I just wasn't vibing the seasoning, I tasted a little bit of it in the chicken. Maybe it was the container it was cooked in, no idea. There was also very slight drizzled syrup which again worked for me because l'm not a sweet & savory person. It all paired wonderfully with my slightly overpriced glass of fresh squeezed OJ to make it feel like l was doing my body a favor. I don't know if I'd order the whole dish again but certainly the chicken. There's a decorative salad garnish on the side of the dish l would throw in the trash like where all vegetables belong.  Then I went ahead and ordered maple sausage and bacon because it's not a meal if pork isn't at the party. More staring out the window and hearing discussion about being too cool for Instagram and a future photo of all their dogs around a computer. I quietly pondered what slicing their faces off would look like.  Also you pour your own water from the carafe, for some this may be a grave insult, I actually prefer it since I know my own water intake. Casual in the right instance. The bacon maple sausage, as Ryan commented, was his fave. I didn't hear much about that because l was wondering why l didn't order a whole meal of just this. It's more a commercial sausage in that there's no grain or anything to mix up the texture like some homemade sausage but it was nonetheless delicious. It was cooked medium which was probably on the best side of caution since it'd have to be smoked to take on more heat. However the jowl bacon was, I don't want to say terrible, but yeah it was not great. As someone who has been called ""bacon girl"" since childhood, I feel fit to say this. Jowl bacon can be cooked like regular bacon, but it's tender in a way that needs gentle guidance like a mama's boy of the pig. Though it's great pan fried, which many people like myself prefer a smoother texture, the oven rack tends to be better suited to its fat content. It'll get crispy with dark brown edges. But the bacon l was served was a lot black. Girl, no. I'll go to a diner if I want decimated bacon char. Cook it like you're incubating your pork child. Also the faint aftertaste that l had in the chicken I was tasting in the bacon, which l liked even less here. Since the service was superb, I had a pleasant window view and had mostly decent parts of the meal, I'll give it a tentative 4 stars. I definitely felt positive about having eaten there. I don't know whether it was the cold, dry air but when I was walking I was already running out of breath. I would never say sweatpants outside no matter how disheveled l may have looked but maybe pick something flowy.",0.9983,0.759,0.17,0.071,0.5365286829572542

Their Apple Pie is shut-up-omg-delicious.  By far, hands down, the best apple pie I've ever eaten.  The Egg White was different than any other egg whites I usually get.  These were poached artistically and the brussel sprouts had that nice char I love.   DOWNFALLS: Their Bloody Mary is not worth ordering.  It had a gross mussel, smelled funky and was more like a tomato smoothie than a Bloody Mary.  The Ham Serrano was a bit of a bizarre dish to include on the brunch menu.  It is similar to what you might get at a tapas restaurant but without cheese or other meats it was a 'random' menu item.   Overall, Jam is a cute spot, but I tried it and I don't think I would go back.  There was nothing mind blowing about the food.  I hate to say this, but when you have Lula's within walking distance you have to try a little harder.",0.8019,0.838,0.098,0.064,0.5111855158730159

2013-01-20,5.0,"I had been hearing lots of accolades about Jam from some friends of mine who work in the industry and today my wife and I decided to trek out to Logan Square to experience it firsthand. I have to say that I am really surprised with the relatively mediocre reviews here on Yelp and find Zagat's rating of 28 out of 30 for food (with ratings of 24 for service and decor) to be right on the mark. Jam is run by Chef Jeffrey Mauro who spent time at now shuttered Chicago stalwart Charlie Trotters as well as at North Pond (which happens to serve my absolute favorite brunch in the city). The influence of these high end venues are apparent at Jam; while Jam is a casual venue, the brunch is extremely high quality cuisine and creative, intriguing menu items (think braised antelope with polenta cake, poached egg, black Tuscan kale and celery root puree for example) . Definitely a gourmet brunch. There certainly are more ""plain"" options for those who do not enjoy exotic dishes and also a few vegetarian items and some choices that are healthy without being  boring (such as egg whites with a root vegetable hash gratine, roasted brussel sprouts and fennel soubise).  The only problem I had with the menu was there were at least a half dozen items that were calling my name that I was really struggling to choose just one! Fortunately some of the items have half portion options in the event you want to sample multiple small plates and on Tuesdays they even offer a breakfast tasting menu! When our server came by she informed us of today's special - fried, boneless chicken and waffles and the description really sounded appealing so I opted for the special. My wife went for the eggs Benedict. Both courses had beautiful presentations (see my photos I added - the spinach hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict really made for a colorful, appealing plate) and everything was well seasoned, cooked to perfection and tasted phenomenal. Prior to our entrees we were served a small cookie as an amuse bouche that also was great and my wife ordered a cinnamon roll; the pastry chef had just finished the batch so it was fresh out of the oven; hot, gooey and served with caramel sauce on the side - this too was amazing.  Sure the food is going to cost a few bucks more than if you opt for brunch at your run-of-the-mill diner or waffle house type venue, but for a few bucks more you are receiving fresh, well prepared, interesting, gourmet food - well worth the small upcharge (our two entrees, pastry and two coffees came to $39 before gratuity). Portion sizes are reasonable; they certainly are not hefty servings, but neither are they dainty. They have lots of  housemade fresh pastries available as well as sides to choose from, so if you are particularly hungry be sure to order a little something extra in addition to your entree and you will be satisfied.  Jam features Metropolis coffee (very good) and has a liquor license so if you are in the mood to indulge you can enjoy Mimosas, Bloody Mary's (served with Tito's vodka, housemade mix, smoked mussels and pickled green tomato), craft beers or their specialty cocktails with your brunch. A great plus about Jam is that it does not become nearly as crowded as some of Chicago's other highly acclaimed brunch venues such as Bongo Room or M Henry where waits on the weekends can exceed an hour; today we arrived just before 10:00am on a Sunday and while Jame was mostly full, we were seated immediately.  The space at Jam is bright and cheerful. One review mentioned blaring music (a pet peeve of mine) but at least today the music was quiet and simply background noise. While tables are a bit close together (making the venue a little bit on the noisy side), it was comfortable. My wife and I both enjoyed the contemporary decor and found the ambiance quite pleasant. Service was extremely friendly and attentive; we had Rachel as our primary server and you are sure to be well cared for if she is assigned to your table. We also had the opportunity to chat with Chef Mauro for a few minutes after eating and he seemed like a really nice, genuine person. As we had such a wonderful brunch and there is so much more on the menu we want to try we will definitely be back within the next couple of weeks despite residing a few miles away.",0.9988,0.82,0.162,0.018,0.5376071428571427

I got a side of the potatoes and they were great.  A little salty, but so good.  I also ordered the signature cocktail because it listed beet juice as an ingredient.  It must have just been a drop to add color because it added no texture or flavor to the drink.  The drink was still delicious.  Just tarter and not as I expected it to be when I ordered.  Several of my friends had similar comments about how they thought the dish they ordered would be different than what it actually was.  The only actual complaint was on the egg sandwich.  As another reviewer mentioned, it was a soggy pile of meat with not a ton of flavor.  We wished it had more flavor and the proportions of the sandwich were more balanced.  I realize that my review is sounding more negative than positive.  That wasn't the case.

There is an item I think they should completely nix off the menu and that's the egg sandwich. It's WAY too big. The sandwich had about a half pound of pork shoulder on it that had absolutely no flavor , a smear of plum jam, and an egg all stuffed between a ciabatta roll. Not exactly what I was expecting. With that said everything else I have had here is superb! The location is right on the blvd, decor is clean and simple, and for what you get it's an excellent price.

2012-10-27,4.0,"Since the boo had already started a pot of coffee on our lazy Saturday mid morning, we were just walking down Logan Boulevard planning on grabbing some pastries. But then the brunch monster snuck up on us and reminded us what lovely brunchy things we could be enjoying in Saturday Brunch Village. Luckily this happened right in front of Jam and even more fortunately, they had room for two. We started off with mimosas with fresh squeezed oj- so delicious! They have the perfect ratio of sparkling wine to oj down, so you taste how amazing the juice is, but also get a little morning buzz from the fizzy confection.  The menu is tough- it all sounds amazing and each item seems to have an ingredient that pulls you in with intrigue. We finally settled on the French toast and eggs benedict. Wow. The eggs benedict looks a little small on arrival, but the flavors are so delicate and balanced, that it is perfect. The English muffins are heavenly and the beet hollandaise is a perfect symmetry of rich and creamy with earthy goodness. The eggs were cooked flawlessly, so the yolk just poured out as soon as you cut in. And the pork belly... It just melts in your mouth. The French toast is clearly soaked for an extended amount of time in malted custard, so the entire toast is saturated and perfectly soft. The boo remarked that this may be the first time that he had ever indulged in French toast without syrup and wondered if he should ask for some. I told him to just try it and he could not believe how delicious it was. The lime leaf cream, floral pink peppercorns and slightly lemony and sour macerated cherries easily blow normal maple syrup out of the water by providing different textures and more exciting flavors. We loved that Jam took our two favorite breakfast items to new heights! On our way out, we saw the egg sandwich with pork shoulder, and it looked huge and fabulous, so we will definitely be trying that on our next trip to Jam.",0.9985,0.749,0.236,0.014,0.5995274170274171

The small slivers of hand-cut, home-smoked bacon were scintillating, but the Guisado Verde was writing flavor checks that its actual taste could not cash.

2012-08-06,2.0,"I went to brunch here this past Sunday and have to admit, i was pretty disappointed. I went with 2 other friends and when we got there, they told us it was about a 15 minute wait which was no problem as the farmers market was going on.  They took our phone number and told us they would call, which i always think is a perk from places. However, when they called us to tell us our table was ready, they sat us at a 2 top outside and pulled up an extra chair and place setting. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but they were jam packing the patio so tight, you really couldn't move too much. They also looked at all 3 of us, and then proceeded to ask if it was for 2 people still (which it never was). We were served water, and there was oj flakes in there as it hadn't been cleaned out very well. When one of the staff caught that, they said they would bring us a fresh pitcher that we never received until we asked our waitress for water. The rest of the experience was VERY slow, including getting coffee, refills, and our food. While waiting, we were served small brownie/peanut butter bites to hold us over until the food came out since it was taking so long, which was a nice gesture. Once the food hit the table, the presentation was very nice, but i thought that it stopped there. I ordererd the breakfast egg sandwich with the pork and the bottom piece of bread was so soggy and mushy, it was hard to even hold. i ended up using a fork/knife to eat it. Overall, i didn't think it had too much flavor besides the jam. That part was delish! The food was lukewarm like it had been sitting, and the potatoes that came with were not even cooked all the way through. The other 2 people I ate with ordered the chorizo omelette (which i thought had the most flavor) and the italian sandwich. The bread on the italian was much yummier as i compared it to my own.  Our waitress checked to see if everything was okay, offered a refill on coffee and then never brought it. When we finally got the check and gave her our credit cards, we waited another 15 minutes for her to bring them back. She was the SLOWEST.

2012-08-03,1.0,"I've been to Jam seven times before and generally liked it, but I had an absolutely terrible experience there today. My wife and I went for lunch and were seated quickly. A waiter came over and asked if we wanted any coffee or juice to start. My wife ordered orange juice and he ran away; I didn't get to order anything. He returned with the juice and asked me what he could get me; I said Diet Coke. I was served this; it wasn't adequately carbonated. Then he returned and we ordered a small waffle to start. But after we ordered this he left and wouldn't give us a chance to order any further food; he would not return to the table. Finally, without any prompting from us, another waiter came over and took our order. I ordered a la carte; eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon. He asked me to repeat the last item. I said bacon. He said ""bacon?"" I said bacon. Apparently if you order bacon here it has to be done in triplicate. We were served our waffle and my wife asked the original waiter for a Diet Coke as well. He never brought this and when we returned to the table for another reason she had to ask him again. Finally our food came out. My wife's salmon was fine but I was served toast, potatoes and bacon and told ""the eggs will be out in a bit."" How fun! Who wouldn't want to chow down on some toast, potatoes and bacon with no eggs? Finally the eggs came out on another plate and I put them on the original plate myself. Also, apparently if you order a la carte at Jam the results are simply disgusting. The eggs were too runny, the toast was bland, the potatoes were undercooked and the bacon tasted weird, which was disappointing because I had to order it three times. Once I finally got all this down and we'd gotten the bill we were told their credit card machine was down and we had to pay cash. They probably should have mentioned this when we walked in but since everything else about the experience was terrible, it stands to reason that paying and leaving would be an ordeal too.

2012-07-28,5.0,"So after my initial review I got a really sweet message from the owner inviting me to come back and try the farm dinner. So my brunch friend (the same one who ordered the amazing zuchini bread with the homemade marshmellow) trotted back over and had dinner.  My friend was there before me and got us a seat outside, I was a few minutes late - typical. It was a beautiful evening and once again I was struck by what a wonderful location this is.  Anyway, I get there and our server comes out right away. She explains a few things to us, and we settle on the 4 course pre-fixe dinner with wine pairings. You also have the option to do the 5 course meal. I have to say, before I go any further, that pre-fixe has really grown on me. I'm usually so anal about stuff, that the idea of just sitting back and not having to make any decisions is really welcoming, especially on a Friday night.  So, dinner. The wine came out first, it was a blanc de blanc. What better way to start off a hotly anticipated dinner that with some bubbly. The paired heirloom carrot salad came out a few minutes later. Even though it's called an heirloom carrot salad, the stars of the salad were clearly the smoked mussels. Amazing! With field greens, a poached quail egg, and salmon mousse. Off to a good start.  The second course was home made foie gras tortellini with a pureed asparagus sauce paired with a really dry Riesling. I'm usually not a Riesling person, but this was really exquisite.  Main course for me was the antelope. My friend got the halibut and then we shared. Let me just preface that I'm all about exotic meats - bring it. My friend was a little more hesitant.  I'm pretty sure that this time I got the better dish. The antelope  was ridiculous. Seared on the outside and still tender and pink on the inside. It came with a side of caponata which changed my life. There was a little herring fillet on top which gave just the right amount of brine to cut the richness. And the fact that it came in an adorable red Le Creuset dish did not get lost on me. Nice touch, Jam :) My friend's Halibut was also amazing. Soft, flakey, delicious, you know, all of the good things fish is supposed to be. I got a red and she got a white. I have no idea what it was, by this point I was so lost in food ecstacy that I forgot to take notes.  For desert they went real traditional. Blueberry muffin with creme fraiche (?) and some blueberries sprinkled on the side. Paired with a really sweet late season white dessert wine. This muffin.. how can I say this. This muffin was unlike any other muffin I've ever had, in a really good way. I'm assuming there's a stick of butter per muffin. And I was okay with that.  After we just got a coffee and sat for a while and soaked up the magic of the evening. Jerry came over and introduced himself to us during the meal and chatted for a bit and asked how everything was. He was really sweet and seemed genuinely interested in our experience, which I appreciate.  Final thoughts : I've always equated Jam with brunch. After this, I would highly recommend visitng for dinner. Seriously.  Even though the restaurant has a full bar, it's still byob, which I think is really fantastic, and I haven't seen before. This helps keep costs down for the clients, but a lower bill typically means less tip for a server who still provides great service. So if you do bring your own, please remember to tip a little more than you typically would.  Also, our server - I think her name was Elizabeth - was really knowledgable, eager to help and explain dishes, and friendly.

I have a severe gluten allergy and the waitress was very accommodating. However I ended up just requesting a chicken salad. The chicken was boiled and the skin was still on it.It tasted really bad. I couldn't even eat it. My friend took it home and she said the same. My meal was a few pieces of lettuce and then a hunk of chicken, not exactly the right proportions for a salad.  The ambiance in this place is weird. The tables are situated in a strange way and the restaurant seems to be a weird mix between fancy and casual. I felt underdressed in a sundress but my friend said she felt okay in a blouse and jeans. After eating here I was sick the next day. My friend and I have also seen them put their pots and pans out in the alley way on the ground and sitting on the trash can. Disgusting!

The bread had either soaked up the grease from the cheese or been slathered in butter. Had been hoping for a slightly lighter meal, but they had run out of the item I originally ordered (the legume salad) and had to choose something else on the spot.

I might have just ordered the wrong thing, but the bread seemed really dense, the sauce was really thick, and the pork belly just added more weight on top of all that.  I wasn't impressed. Family mostly got omelets and they seemed to like them okay.  Overall, we waited probably an hour and everything was just okay. The best part was the free s'more cookie and fresh OJ.

The scrambled eggs were under-cooked, lukewarm and salty and the oatmeal was tasteless. I will be sure to let my friend in the area know of my experience and tell them not to waste their money .

Man, I do not know why people still go to brunch, especially with kids. I would stay home and make animal-shaped pancakes for the rug-rats, plant them in front of a My Little Pony video and go back to bed.   Oh yeah...the review of Jam.  Try the evening.  Jam's non-breakfast dishes are really quite exceptional, even when compared to a nearby Michelin-starred restaurant (Longman & Eagle).  Jam is byob for now, so I started with fresh carrot juice and a delicious asparagus soup.  The chef applied a thin layer of what appeared to be cooked garlic pulp to the bottom of the bowl, with creme fraiche, and the fragrant, leaf-green soup was poured over this base. Fantastic.  The other stand-out was dessert, which was actually a breakfast item: Pineapple French Toast. The pineapple is finely diced and poached (?)  in cranberry to create a complex, tart contrast to the slight sweetness of the toast.  I usually don't touch restaurant whipped cream, but this was cloud-light and barely sweetened, dusted with spices or herbs.   I'm giving Jam 4 stars for excellent food and service, albeit without a wine list to enjoy with it.  Another star goes to the beautiful design of the space. Crisp oversized mirrors, clear lucite chairs, white ""ball-of-string"" pendant lamps and gorgeous laser-cut plexi wall fixtures give the space a sophisticated, yet sexy feel.  If you bring a date here, it will set the right mood.

I really wanted Saturday's special, the pot roast, and it was Sunday. Our server checked with the chef and told me he would be able to do the pot roast - they now offer multiple dinner options nightly, which is definitely a good thing.

A guisado verde of pork, sunny-side egg and corn risotto with tomato crema was a delight to my gluttonous belly. I tried my friends' dishes too - a beef hash was an extremely generous portion of meat and the vegetarian biscuits and gravy made from oyster mushrooms was savory and delicious. Even the day's special, a venison omelette, was cooked to perfection and tasted great. All in all, a solid choice at a reasonable price point.

2012-02-20,2.0,"Well Chicagoans are known, if not around the country then at least to each other as being huge on brunch, and I am no exception. It comes with the territory that you are going to wait at least 30 minutes for a table at the best places in the city, and usually it's worth it (there wouldn't be a wait if it weren't).  Said places are also loud as a rule.  That being said, I have some mixed feelings about this place. I went here with some friends about a week ago to check them out.  We were told a 45 minute wait, which I expected, but got seated in 15.  So far, pretty good.  The decor is nice, especially the light fixtures, and I am partial to the color scheme ( I notice these things) as well.  I did read the reviews on here days before, so I went curious to see what my experience may be.   So, the server arrived and took our order, and while we got our drinks pretty fast, we waited forever for the food to arrive.  I think I would have almost rather spent that time waiting to be seated than waiting for the food.  I know they were slammed but oh well.  Our server realized we were waiting a long time, and brought out a tiny madeline (cookie) for each of us to tide us over- I have to point out though that said madeleine was only slightly larger than my thumb, so it is rather comical that anyone would think it could hold you over.  Anyway, I am not saying this to be mean.  I worked in the service industry most of my adult life, so I have some sympathy for those who are in it. Okay, so at last our food has arrived.  I am looking forward to the malted custard french toast that is in front of me, with its dollops of whipped cream topped with pink peppercorns and macerated cherries.  My brunch companions ordered a turkey club with seasoned fries and eggs benedict respectively.  The french toast was very good, but I have to note here that there was no syrup of any kind to be seen for it.  Now I am not closed minded about getting creative with food but after a few bites sans syrup I suspected there was a good reason why it's been an accompaniment to french toast for as long as it has.  I used the whipped cream as a substitute (I was too hungry to sit and wait til our server came back) but it sadly ran out before the toast did.  The pink peppercorns were a very nice touch though, so if you order this eat them with the toast, don't just cast aside as a garnish.  They may have actually been the best thing about my breakfast.  When our server came back, I inquired about syrup- she said it is an extra charge.  Okay,, I've never heard of a restaurant charging extra for syrup.  I think a  cherry syrup would be a good accompaniment because of the macerated cherries, but who am I to say that if you're charging 12 bucks for french toast that it shouldn't be an extra?  I don't know.   Well, I didn't try anything off my friends' plates except the fries since I am vegetarian.  And the fries, I'm sad to say, had way too much spice rubbed on them.  As in she and I were scraping it off with a knife too much.  This is not something that should be happening in a restaurant that sports haute cuisine, should it?   Anhow, we get the bill and luckily my friends boyfriend was insistent on paying- good thing since I was planning on paying with my card and they apparently are a Cash Only establishment.  Now that's one thing that may give me pause about going back.  I don't want to have to run to an ATM in the freezing cold and pay the stupid ATM fee because a place doesn't take credit card.  I mean it would be one thing if they were some old mom and pop joint in the sticks, but this is a modern restaurant in one of the largest cities in the world, so what is the reason folks?   Check them out if you are curious I guess, just don't forget to bring some cash.",0.9975,0.834,0.131,0.035,0.4954285714285716

We split the raspberry coffeecake muffin after lunch.  It was pretty tasty.  Don't know if we will be back for brunch, but we might try to stop in later at night to sample some of the sweet items for dessert.   I think JAM will do just fine and have a long run at their place in Logan Square.",0.9748,0.863,0.112,0.025,0.6026785714285713

I really tried to find the positive in the newest restaurant to hit The Square but I struggled to see a reason why I would go back.  The first issue is that there are not a lot of breakfast selections to choose from. I had the egg sandwich which was just OK. I couldn't really differentiate any of the flavors that were described to me in the menu. It tasted like an egg with meat on it. Nothing special. The second issue the place was very loud and it wasn't even that crowded. I can't imagine what the place is like when it is hopping. I think the issue is the music was set so loud that everyone felt the need to talk over everyone else. I really don't care about what people are talking about but I do wish I could have held a nice conversation with the people I was with or at least not have to yell to be heard. The third issue it is cash only and the place isn't that cheap for breakfast. Hopefully that will change soon but make sure you have cash if you go. I can't imagine how expensive their dinners would be but that would mean for a table of four you need a lot of cash on hand. The positive was the service which I thought was great. The free carrot cake cupcakes were a nice plus and the apple coffee cake we ordered was the best thing I ate.  There are more and more brunch locations opening in The Square and I think for the money you get better deals and selections elsewhere.,0.9958,0.775,0.203,0.022,0.5307353294853294

Among its offerings, Jam juices fresh carrots and apples--in my view, a must for a breakfast place.

I have spent about 15 dollars on each visit- so I think prices are totally reasonable. The room is absolutely gorgeous- modern, welcoming and light filled.

The first was when he knocked over my son's root beer onto my husband - that's okay, mistakes happen - but would have been nice to replace the root beer since half of it spilled.  Also, I had eaten at the other location and enjoyed a delicious amuse bouche at the start of the meal.  I assumed they had discontinued this practice at the new location.  However as we were leaving, I noticed the table next to us had been served them.  The spilled rootbeer was forgiveable but not the missed amuse bouche! I had forgotten this place was cash only so we had to avail ourselves of the cash machine at the back.  Would be nice to be able to use a credit card.   I'm sure the lines will start to get crazy here once their signage is up.",0.9963,0.779,0.185,0.035,0.6384213934213934

2011-11-15,5.0,"Unbeknownst to me- it looks like this place had a former location. I'd love for Yelp to separate the two, because half of these reviews are NO WHERE CLOSE to what the bf and I experienced today.  First off- the decor needs a nod of its own. Lovely color palate, creative use of mirrors/clear plastic chairs to make the space feel huge, and slightly divided areas, which seemed to divide those in for lunch and those in for the long haul quite well. Don't let it fool you though- completely comfortable! The chairs were perfect for that mid-day, slightly slouchy, relaxed mode.  From there? Amazing. Delicious. Impeccable service.  We walked up to the Cash Only sign on the door- the bf froze, but between the two of us, we had about $50 and figured that was fine. Amazingly, we somehow didn't even spend that much! I had the French toast and the bf had the Jamburger. Our server, Brandon, could not have been more awesome. He started with an explanation of how they make the french toast, marinate overnight, balance the sweet with tart flavors- totally made the difference. Also, the pink peppercorn on the lime whip? Brilliant! Shane's Jamburger looked phenomenal. It was a little slippery to pick up with the egg, roasted tomato, and cheese, but he loved it. Would've snagged a seasoned French fry too, but he loved them as well! I'm excited that they do breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We can't wait to go back and try more things. I know they just opened today, but I'm crossing my fingers that everything stays impeccably quick and tasty as they get busier! Ps- it's byob.

2011-11-12,1.0,"Count us among those who were underwhelmed. We went for breakfast, and doubt we'll be back. Start with the plus: the food is good. The food is presented nicely and well prepared. We both enjoyed the dishes we were served. Items served to other tables looked like they would be good also. That was all we liked. The negatives: 1) The service was slow-- we watched three servers talking at the counter while we waited for someone to take our order in a not-crowded restaurant. 2) They charge for extra shots of espresso-- a triple espresso would have been $12!!! 3) The portions are not large. The ""strip steak"" was two small squares. 4) It is expensive. We paid almost $50 for breakfast (including tip). I guess for a super-gourmet breakfast that might be a good deal, but the food wasn't super-gourmet. Walk a couple blocks to Lula, and you can get a great breakfast for at least $10 less. Walk a few blocks to Cozy Corner, and you can got a ton of food for $20 less. 5) They don't take credit. I mean, really. $50 for breakfast and you force me to go get cash out of an ATM? The manager seemed surprised when we mentioned that convenience is a major consideration when we dine. So if you want to pay cash for very over-priced food, this is the place for you. Another plus: it makes even Lula seem refreshingly unpretentious. Note: this review was written prior to their official open, so some of the service issues may improve. The fact that they are expensive and cash-only (they don't plan to change this) is still a huge negative.",0.9238,0.835,0.112,0.053,0.4974801587301588

It was sweet, but not enough to be classified as a dessert. The food paired wonderfully with my fresh Chicago-brand Metropolis coffee. That stuff is liquid gold.  We had the omelet with cremini mushrooms and sauteed onions. The eggs had a surprising crunch to them. When I think of crunch in an omelet, I often think of eggshells that had gotten carelessly tossed with the batter. Not so with these eggies! I can't put my finger on the taste, but if I were to guess I would say the mysterious crunch is from some form of a crouton. Whatever made the crunch, it was a pleasant surprise. Dessert for brunch, yes please. We shared their delicious apple scone with real chunks of fresh apple and fresh whipped butter.

I had never heard of Jam, living as I do on the other side of town, but my friend in Wicker Park said the eggs benedict here were the best she'd ever had, so we went. The eggs benedict were ordered by two of our group, and when they arrived, served with pork belly, they were enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend ordered the braised lamb buckwheat crepes and declared that it was the best breakfast he'd had in Chicago. I went with the amish chicken after it came highly recommended by our server, but I was disappointed by it. It was served over a grain that I think was quinoa, which was great, but the whole dish was pretty bland. Seeing how much everyone else enjoyed their meal I think I (and my server) might have made a mistake choosing this dish. Then there was the serving size. All the plates were very beautifully prepared, arriving at the table like little works of art, but all the dishes were on the smaller side. If I go out for brunch, especially on days when I have to work all evening (in a restaurant, surrounded by food, no less), I really want a big meal that sets me up for the day, but only a little while after leaving Jam I was hungry again, which I felt was a shame. The coffee was good, and the amuse bouche they served us while waiting for our food (tiny chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting) were delicious. We sat out on the patio, which is decorated with some very eclectic art pieces and all agreed it was cute, except for the back corner which apparently belongs to the apartment building that overlooks the patio and was filled with old junk.

Started with an order of Scones and Breakfast Pastries, both served piping hot.  The herb scone was just okay but the pastry was very good.  What really stole the show, though, was the house-made cherry jam--every little bit of the smears on the plate were scooped up.  Definitely consider getting an order of one or the other (or both) even if you wouldn't normally get an appetizer item for brunch. The scones and pastries were followed up with the Eggs Benedict--which was a poached egg on top of a bread plated over an artistic brush of fennel hollandaise and served with crisped pork belly.  The dish looked amazing, and the fennel hollandaise was fantastic.  The pork belly was also pretty good.  Tip:  The pork belly as an additional side serves up a surprisingly large quantity of pork belly--a big value over the usual expectations of paying a couple bucks for two or three pieces of bacon a la carte. After the check we were rewarded with tiny chocolate cupcakes served straight from the oven topped with a delicious lemon creme fraiche.  Again, this was good food that simply left you wanting for more. Service was pretty good and, as I mentioned before, the outdoor courtyard is a superb place to have brunch and ease into the day.  It is BYOB, so feel free to bring a bottle of champagne if you want to enjoy some mimosas.  Also, the fact that they are cash-only is a bit of a pain, but I can live with it given the food and environment.  Why not a full five stars?  I don't think Jam is quite at the point of being a destination restaurant where one would travel (as in, across state lines) to get to, but this isn't to say the thought didn't cross my mind.  Jam ends up as a very strong four star establishment.",0.9986,0.739,0.25,0.01,0.5951770451770454

2011-07-20,4.0,"A few weekends ago, I was walking my dog and my roommate texted me about brunch and asked if I wanted to go to the crepe place that's around the corner from our house that we have been to a hundred million times. Now don't get me wrong. I like the crepe place. The crepe place and I are old friends. But dammit, I am that asshole who always wants to go to eat at somewhere that is completely new in an area of town that I haven't been to before. So I suggested we go to Jam. I don't remember how I heard of Jam or why it popped into my head that morning but I am SO GLAD IT DID, because I told her to check out the menu online and her response was, ""This is happening."" So we hopped on the Damen bus for what seemed like forever (because it's the Damen bus and the Damen bus shows up approximately three times all day, which is horseshit considering the fact that it connects three train lines) and went down to Ukrainian Village. Jam is like two separate worlds. The inside world has an open kitchen and those weird clear plastic chairs and it's clean and minimal and it makes you feel like you're in the weird lovechild of CB2 and Anthropologie. (Note: This is okay because I dig both of those stores.) The outside world is like your insane artist aunt is having a backyard party and threw a bunch of tables out back among her weird cowhide sculptures and stacks of trucks. (Note: Not kidding. Cow sculptures. Stack of trucks.) Sit outside if it's not a million degrees out - because the inside has no AC. Eat the adorable amuse (ours was a teeny carrot-ginger muffin with cream cheese frosting) and marvel at the idea of an amuse served with brunch. If you want savory, get the lamb crepes. Do not pass go. Do not look elsewhere on the menu. Maybe ask for extra pears to better balance out the savory perfection of the crepes. Do not be put off by the fact that the sauce looks like tomato bisque. (It isn't tomato bisque.) If you can't decide if you want sweet or savory and aren't super hungry - get the Scotch Egg. It's soft-boiled and battered and lightly fried and served over an herbed waffle with strawberry balsamic vinaigrette and manages to hit every spot correctly. Bring cash. Bring champagne (it's BYOB).

I got the wheatberry salad and if you've never had wheatberries, this is a great first experience. What a grain! I asked for the salad without onions, and the waiter actually returned to our table to ask me if I had an aversion to onions or an allergy. The chef requested he find out. What I take from that is, if you have a food allergy, this place may double check that they aren't going to kill you.

Sat for another 15 minutes patiently waiting to pay and leave.  At this point we're an hour and thirty into it and just want to move on with our day.  Finally, the bill comes and we were charged for both the pancakes and the scone.  I can completely understand one or the other, but both?!?!  I mean, we're talking about a $3 scone here.  They're not exactly giving the house away if they comp a scone in exchange for those awful pancakes.  As frequent diners with numerous friends in the industry, we can confidently say that we are not ""those customers"".  Regardless, it left a bad taste in our mouth after an already poor experience.  We will be back, eventually, but not until after a long hiatus spent at Chicago's many other competent breakfast establishments.",0.4644,0.765,0.114,0.121,0.44436274509803925

In accordance with its presentation, the dish tasted terrible. I wish I'd sent it back after the first shudder-inducing bite. I would have never gone back a second time, but my friend was paying, and I am not the type to turn down a free meal. I ordered the Spanish Omelet and was similarly disappointed.

So simply put....in my opinion(not feeling humble at this point),Jam is some of the BEST brunch you can get in Chicago.  Period.  My wife and I are close to double digit visiters to Jam, and it's really our favorite brunch spot to hit.  The decor is simple, but kind of cool and different for brunch. Somebody mentioned CB2 ""ish"" and I agree.  It creates a feel of quaint, but sort of modern and clean at the same time.  The kitchen is right out there in the open, so you can see all the action as it happens.   Walk in and you will be most likely greeted by the same tall guy that I've seen there for years.  Sorry man...don't know your name, but you've always been extremely nice and accurate in your estimate on wait time.  Yes...there is sometimes a wait time.  That's because this food is good and people want to come here.  So they have a little courtyard next to the restaurant that you can ajourn to while you wait if it's not too cold outside.  And as we sat in that slightly eclectic and interesting, spacious courtyard, they brought us water.  2 points for sevice beginning even before our table inside has become available.   And you are not standing outside like cows on Milwaukee Ave milling around aimlessly looking at soap carvings at whatever the frick that store near Bongo room is supposed to be(no offense in particular to that store...I'm sure your carved soap is beautiful and cleans with the best of soaps...just not my thing).   Anyway....after enjoying a short 10 minutes out in the courtyard, we were ushered to our table and the deliciousness begins.  Coffee....excellent.  Amuse bouche today happened to be a mini lemon poppy cake like bite.  Yes...you get a little amuse bouche at Jam.  And no...it's not pretentious.  I'm sorry yelpers but that's crap.   The staff are tatt'd up dudes that are totally chill.   They give you a little taste of what's to come.  On this particular visit, I had something I hadn't seen before.  Pork Terrine with over easy eggs on pretzel bread.  There was some kind of carmelized veg and some whole grain mustard in the mix.  Pork Terrine for breakfast???  Are you kidding me?  It was awesome.  My wife got the pork belly eggs benedict with a fennel hollandaise sauce.  Beautiful plating and absolutely delicious.   In addition we had fresh made PB&J scones that were warm, fresh and packed with fruity and nutty goodness.   So some folks seem to complain that it's just too expensive for the quantity of food you get..  OK.....yes.....this is not Bongo Room where you wait around for 45 minutes to get seated and pull up to your trough and then if they sprinkle an excessive amount of Dill on everything, apparently that makes it special in some way.  Look....I don't mean to rip on Bongo.  I like Bongo.  They offer some good food, no question.  And it's lively and fun there, for sure.  But if you like good food.  And you want something a little different and a little more thought out than your typical brunch spots, then you most assuredly can appreciate Jam.   Sure....it's not gonna be a dirt cheap brunch, but the chef creates thoughtful, creative, and unique brunch dishes.    But if you prefer the Dill and the trough.....go Mooooooo on with your bad self.  To each their own...I won't hate on you.  Or at least not to your face.    Moooo!",0.9993,0.751,0.221,0.027,0.5701209600305985

2011-04-01,3.0,"Been here twice for breakfast on a Saturday.  The place was hidden by some scaffolding a little while ago, but once you step inside, you are pleasantly surprised by the modern decor.  Almost CB2ish with a little mirror and flourish action. The kitchen is right out front right behind the register so you can sort of see the chefs cooking food.  The food is somewhat more upscale than your typical breakfast/brunch place...or at least it is laid out on fancier plates with fancier names.   The first time I went there I ordered an egg sandwich with the pork belly.  It was nice but a little on the fatty side.  Granted pork belly has fat on it, but this was a little too much.  The flavors were pretty good though.  The second time we went, my friend and I both ordered the biscuits and gravy.  I remember this dish being disappointing as I was expecting some soft right-out-of-the oven hot biscuits with creamy gravy.  Instead the biscuits were harder than expected and the gravy was dark and just didn't give me that comforting feeling. I read also that they give some diners amuse bouche...and while the table right next to us got theirs, they somehow missed us on both of our trips.   Another note: the service is on the slow side.  While the chefs and waiters do look busy, it seems that they simply do not have enough chefs to feed hungry diners promptly on a busy morning.  That does not make a pregnant woman happy. All in all, a cute dining atmosphere but after my 2nd trip, I give it 3 stars.",0.989,0.828,0.147,0.024,0.4718671679197996
2011-03-30,4.0,"In a cozy spot off Damen sits Jam. A tiny nondescript brunch spot with so much scaffolding outside, we had to drive by twice before finding the place. But we weren't there for the ambiance, we came for good food, and at Jam we found plenty of it.  With brunch being such a seemingly boring meal, the chef at Jam is doing an admirable job being adventurous and unique.  We started off with the prosciutto and fennel scone. Lovely blend of flavors, a bit dry, as I thought it could use a more butter (I can't believe I just said that), but it crumbled nicely and the tiny prosciutto added a pleasant twist on a typically fruity breakfast pastry. I ordered the scotch egg and the biscuits and gravy for my main. The scotch egg on a waffle with a bit of raspberry jam was superb. First off, it seems nearly impossible to find a scotch egg on the menu of a Chicago restaurant (Owen & Engine) is the only other one I've found so far. Second, it was very well prepared, with a thin layer of sausage with bread crumbs/corn meal coating and cooked almost perfectly...I thought it was not quite runny enough, but still it was runny enough to enjoy with the sweet and savory nature of the waffle and jam.  The biscuits and gravy were the highlight of the meal. Homemade sausage with a wonderful mushroom gravy and tight fresh biscuits; it was a unique take on tried and true southern dish that even Paula Dean wouldn't be able to turn down!  -- (Not that Paula Dean would turn down any food for that matter) -- Besides the delicious food we had, the coffee was great and it was nice to see that they don't over charge you for coffee (it was a very reasonable $2).

It's not that the flavor and quality of the food was bad - it wasn't, but this is hardly likely to sate the average Chicagoan's expectations for brunch.  Even my friend and I, who are two health-conscious, Pollanites left quite hungry. What's more, the service was appallingly bad.  Rather than taking our orders and delivering our food in a prompt manner, our waiter fussed over the symmetry of our silverware.  Those five dollar pancakes were forgotten in the mix and had to be re-ordered (lord knows we needed the food!)

2011-01-21,4.0,"A rainy Saturday morning in Ukie Village served as the perfect opportunity to satiate our breakfast cravings at Jam.  It was early enough before the lunch crowd hit so we had no issues getting a table.  Brunch started with a mini spiced orange muffin amuse bouche.  I can't name one other place that presents a non-dinner amuse - nice touch and a great way to welcome your guests.  Being a lover of all things pork, I went with the Eggs Benedict and the wifey ordered the Blueberry Pancakes.  Now Jam is no greasy spoon diner, so you can expect their food to have an up-scale twist.  In the case of their Eggs Benedict, that means a somewhat deconstructed presentation and the canadian bacon gets replaced with some tasty pork belly.  I do appreciate that everything wasn't drowned in Hollandaise (not that there's anything wrong with that), so you could portion off as much as you wanted with each bite.  While I thoroughly enjoyed my dish, the same couldn't be said for my wife's pancakes.  I tried a bite and the flavor was just flat.  There were definitely blueberries in there, but their flavor just didn't pop.  I would normally end the story there and finish up a 3-star review, but things changed when our waitress stopped by and asked if everything was alright.  Ever so polite, my wife gave the ""it's ok"" reply with a cordial smile but our waitress wasn't buying it.  She could clearly tell my wife wasn't enjoying her meal and gladly took it back to the kitchen, saying that if we're paying good money for a meal then we better enjoy it.  After a second review of the menu, and a recommendation from our waitress, my wife went with the Malted Crusted French Toast.  Our waitress was nice enough to comp us with a tasty Pecan Sticky Bun so my wife could nibble on something while I went to town on my eggs benedict.  The French Toast hit the table a few of minutes later and it was fantastic.  I was told that before they hit the griddle, the french toast is first sous-vide to set the custard batter.  The end result is non-mushy french toast that has body, but is still very light and delicate.  Additional layers of flavor came in from macerated cherries and pink peppercorns that added some light peppery accents and crunch.   While there might be a few ""misses"" on the brunch menu, there are surely more hits.  It's also worth asking your server for recommendations so you can get right to the goods.  Service gets a big 'ol gold star for actually caring about the customer's dining experience and not just the bottom line.",0.9945,0.828,0.146,0.027,0.4323343685300208

2010-11-14,4.0,"This is how brunch should be done.  Having spent a few years in the industry myself, I know: no one wants to work brunch.  It sucks.  Anyone who has ever done it, knows... and likely expects a little less of any server who greets you before noon.  But these guys were on their game.  Brunch moves fast... and I did have to wait an extra minute or two for my order to be taken... but that's because I walked in within 2 or 3 minutes of 4 other tables.  And 3 more walked in before my juice came.  Insanity!  But I quickly figured out why. The menu was really beautifully crafted, and I wasn't sure I could pick just which dish would ultimately be the most satisfying.  Sweet?  Savory?  Something baked? fried? cold?  Tough call.   I went with the scotch egg - one of my new favorite outrageous indulgences.  a soft-boiled egg, wrapped in sausage meat, breaded and deep-fried. Cholesterol, what?  Oh well.  This particular egg was served atop a small sage-scented waffle with a bit of raspberry coulis and some diced apple and frisee.  I hate frisee,  But the sweet/tart coulis paired well with the savory waffle and the salty egg/sausage.  They were out of the side I ordered, but the server cheerfully recommended the crisped pork belly.  Pork belly is hit or miss with me, but I took a shot.  And this hit was a bullseye.  Enough meat to give them fatty bits some structure... A great texture and balance not always easy to achieve with belly meat. There was no amuse, which is fine (it's not required, obviously) but so many other reviews referenced it, so I had been looking forward to some little sweet bite to start off.  Oh well... no other table nearby seemed to receive one, so I know I wasn't just left out. The fresh-squeezed OJ topped it off nicely, and I never came close to running out of water - the back-server was really attentive.  I did have a couple of minutes to kill before receiving the check at the end, but again, I gave them the benefit of the doubt since they were so busy.  Plus, it was a great chance to just watch the VERY open kitchen (open on two sides, with just a half-wall separating it from the dining room.  I love an open kitchen, so I was happily entertained while I waited.  Well-priced, a great value... this place must have a crazy cult following on the weekends.  I showed up just before 9 and it was packed by 9:05. On that note... I want to address a couple of other reviews here.  1 star, because you had to wait for a table?  Right.  If you go to a busy, popular spot, that only has about a dozen tables... expect that those for 4 are for 4.  Those for 2 are for 2.  It's the way the world works.  If you can't handle basic restaurant rules, make your own breakfast.  Rant over.",0.9934,0.753,0.161,0.086,0.5945135882635881
2010-11-10,4.0,"THE FOLLOWING IS A REVIEW OF JAM ON DAMEN, WHICH IS NO LONGER. *** The ratings are not faulty, and the reviews are not mixed up. I actually find it consistent with the restaurant's character albeit subjective in star factor. Let me explain. I came with 2 other friends on a Sunday (1pm-ish) and were seated within 10-15 minutes (which is a vast improvement from other typical brunch places). The interior is cute and all, and I love the open kitchen area- I like to know where my food comes from and who's making it. Immediately I noted the crowd, they are definitely here to see and be seen. Its like a Disneyland of the yuppie-hipster types, and I had to stop myself from gawking. Red cowboy boots, fedora hats, keffiyehs, babies. No es importa. (but take note). I just rolled out of bed with my jeans and faded hard rock tshirt, no cash and nursing a hangover. Voila! An ATM machine that charges only $1 fee!!! I wanted to kiss this beautiful machine.. They serve Metropolis coffee. We got each, a mini muffin each amuse bouche. I forget what kind, it was citrusy, like orange and honey. I thought it was a nice touch. We proceeded to order... quince french toast, braised lamb crepes, crisp pork belly (for my friend), apple coffee cake, a sticky bun, between us 3. The food, was really good. It had been meticulously planned to taste the way it tasted. It wasn't too complicated, it was simple and complex enough, and delicious. Standard american portions (XXL) leave me with much guilt, especially with breakfast/brunch because who eats leftover brunch? in my opinion the portions are perfect and appropriately sized. So what is with the average 3 stars? Aside from the star rating, observe the rating distribution, trend and read the individual reviews.. Instead of consistently being average, the average 3 stars are comprised of almost equal parts high and low ratings. Here is why: this place attracts trendy yuppie hipsters. It is simply a natural behavior for hipsters to criticize in order to demonstrate their depth of a particular subject. Ergo raving or complaining. Decide yourself. I would definitely come here again, and would especially love to take advantage of the outdoor patio in the warmer months.

2010-11-08,3.0,"The day started like any other in Ohio - early alarm, a trip to the gym, and my typical breakfast...four clock hours later (5 minus 1 accounting for time difference) I found myself seated at a table at Jam in Chicago for the first meal of my most recent trip to the Windy City - this time to see SOFA.  With my sister and her art pals coming to town via car and myself flying Jam would be one of my solo meals for the trip and arriving shortly after 8am the place was largely empty.  Seated immediately and presented with a menu I ordered a coffee and browsed the scene. Owned and operated by Jeffrey Mauro (who was manning the open front kitchen along with a young female,) Jam defines ""hipster kitsch"" in terms of music (Radiohead to Beach Boys,) layout (Acrylic Chairs,) and menu (upscale brunch classics somewhat reinvented.)  It is also cash only.  Sipping my coffee, a sturdy blend by Metropolis, I was next greeted by my server and orders were placed - a pastry and the dish described as their ""signature.""  I will note that the online menu is not up to date, though both the online menu and in-store menu were full of wonderful sounding options. Settled in I was first delivered an amuse bouche - a nice touch for breakfast.  Slightly bigger than a thimble the apple cider brioche was perfect for the season - loaded with spice and dissolving on the tongue in a manner similar to a gougere. Arriving second and plated much more elaborately than I'd have expected from something simply described as a ""cinnamon roll"" was - well - a cinnamon roll.  Served hot off the grill and frosted in the open kitchen the pastry was of similar dimensions to a hockey puck but crisp and flaky seated next to a lovely hand whipped cream and raspberry jam.  Somewhere between a croissant and a cinnamon roll in texture, buttery and aromatic - one of the better cinnamon rolls I've ever had, and small enough to serve as an excellent appetizer. For my main course I opted for the Malted Custard French Toast with Macerated Rhubarb, Lime Leaf Cream, and Pink Peppercorn.  Watching the dish prepared from start to finish I will first note that this is some elaborate French Toast - thick brioche was pulled from a large container of liquid and first pan seared prior to entering the oven to be finished.  After approximately 10 minutes in the oven the dish was plated and served up piping hot.  Unfortunately everything that the toast had in preparation and presentation it largely lacked in flavor.  Buttery for sure and interesting in the interplay of lime and peppercorn the dish lacked any sweetness aside from that imparted by the Rhubarb.  While this dish may have found a more receptive audience amongst those who prefer a savory breakfast it simply wasn't my style.  Adding to the disappointment, when I was presented with the bill it turned out I could've ordered a half-order and thus saved stomach space for another menu item. When it was all said and done I settled the bill - just over $20 with a good tip for excellent service - and made my way to the street en route for Millennium Park.  While Jam was good, particularly in comparison to the options in my home town, I can't say I'd rush back - there are simply too many excellent breakfast and brunch spots in Chicago.",0.9951,0.871,0.111,0.018,0.4796999007936508

2010-10-05,2.0,"I really wanted to like Jam... I visited for brunch with a group on a lovely Friday.  The outdoor patio area is a little haven away from the street.  However, it seemed as if we had missed the actual lunch/brunch crowd as the restaurant was very empty and even so, we were not able to order items from the earlier menu (we had a mid-day menu).  However, the food was quite delicious and service was quick and helpful.  Prices were not inexpensive, but were reasonable.   Due to the delicious food, our group decided to return, as part of a larger group, for dinner.  We were again seated outside.  The restaurant is BYO, and we were provided glasses, wine buckets, corkscrews, etc, quickly upon arrival. However, this is where the similarity to brunch ended.  There is a tasting menu at dinner, but none of these items are offered a la carte (I feel this is quite odd, as outside of restaurant week menus, most restaurants are happy to offer fixed menu items a la carte).  A few of us opted for the tasting menu, while some had meals from the regular menu.  We waited extensively for our meals.  The kitchen is miniscule and does not seem to be able to keep up with the dinner crowd.   The food itself was tasty.  However, small portions for some menu items were surprising.  Additionally, our group requested some items that we were not provided with which resulted in a discussion with the manager that did not solve the issue.   Overall, the nice outdoor patio does not make up for the inflexible menu options, long wait for food, and the service.  There are other great BYOs in the area that are much better options.",0.9835,0.857,0.116,0.027,0.47000777000777
2010-10-02,4.0,"Based on some of these other reviews, I must have come on a good day (Saturday 10:30AM) and they must have lowered their prices a bit.   I liked Jam.  If you're a picky eater, or just looking for a simple breakfast - you'll hate it.  This is NOT the place to get 2 eggs, bacon, and wheat toast.  You gotta be in the right mood for their unconventional and sometimes intense flavors.  You also gotta be careful because their portion size varies wildly.  I got the Spanish omelet and couldn't put the whole thing down, laughing at the big guy at the other table who got the eggs benedict which was a piddly little joke - some kind of smear paste across the plate with bits of meat and tiny little eggs that looked like have the white had been cut off - they probably consider that ""deconstructed"".  The french toast (which was really good) was big but the pancakes looked little.  We also got biscuits and gravy, which had some very interesting flavors.

2010-09-20,4.0,"About a year ago Julia Kramer (of TOC) said that Jam was ""Only the best thing to happen to brunch in a long time."" With a strong following and great food, this BYO, cash only store-front in Ukrainian village decided to expand to include dinner. When dining buddies Geoff and Ashley suggested dinner at Jam to honor Geoff's birthday, I was thrilled to experience what everyone else had been talking about.  The dinner menu is quite simple with two main choices: a tasting menu of four or five courses, or seven a la carte items. I'm never one to shy away from a well prepared tasting menu and went with all five courses for $37. Ashley joined me with five courses while Geoff and Erica chose the $25 four course option. I appreciated their ability to be flexible with different lengths at one table, and even offered us to mix and match if someone preferred a la carte. Consumer flexibility and service is always appreciated. We had a great meal with friendly service at very compelling value (it helps when you bring your own wine). Total bill with tax and tip came to $160 for four people. We did not walk out stuffed, but pleasantly full from a good meal.   If there is one main complaint from the evening, it would be that the first two courses do not do justice to the rest of the selections. Everyone started with an heirloom tomato with gorgonzola, watercress and coco nib puree. It was a simple starter with a nice plump and fresh tomato, but probably too simple to warrant its own course. I also did not understand the texture or flavor importance of the coco nib puree.  Our second course was foie gras tortellini with melted onion and snap pea puree. I'm not a lover of foie gras, but I am a lover of tortellini. The presentation and technique made this a fun dish and I even enjoyed the foie gras flavors. The main comment was that, again, it was too small a course with three tortellini.  The main entrees arrived and dispelled any notion of an average meal (the first two courses left us wondering). Erica may have made the best move of the evening with a four course meal selecting the roasted pork tenderloin as the entrée. While she enjoyed her entrée, the rest of us were served seared pacific ono with lemon gnocchi, blueberry, ricotta and an almond emulsion. There was a lot going on in this dish with a rather small piece of fish. The presentation was beautiful with the green, blue and yellow colors. The gnocchi and blueberries were interesting and fun textures to enjoy with fish. The almond emulsion made the well cooked fish taste close to perfection. Course three was a major success, we just wish there was a little more of it.  Our meal continued to get better with course four (only for Ashley and me). Erica already sampled the pork tenderloin but it was now my turn. The roasted pork tenderloin served with fig, scallion cream, crisped bollo and tapenade was on the better dishes I've had in a long time. The pork was cooked well and the flavors jumped off the plate. Each bite could be savored and enjoyed with any of the dressings. I am quite certain the pork was the star dish of the evening.  There were two desserts on the daily changing dessert menu, and we tried both. The first was a vanilla crème pudding served with small shortcake crackers, and the second was a mini molten  chocolate cake served with vanilla Black Dog Gelato from down the street. While the pudding was tasty, the chocolate cake was incredible. This was one course I did not mind my smallish portion because I don't when I would have stopped eating. Having Black Dog down the street can take any dessert to the next level.  We walked out very happy having experienced a wide range of gourmet flavors, a true testament to a well rounded and talented chef. While the extra course may not be worth the extra $12, I highly recommend the tasting menu to experience all that Jam offers.

This place was recommended by food and wine magazine plus staff from a very awesome restaurant. And it was good. My pork cheek and fried egg sandwich was AWESOME. Cheeks cooked perfect with i believe a granny-smith apple-something that i dont really remember, but it was early in the morning and we had a very tiring day previous to eating here. My girlfriend got the eggs benedict. The eggs were perfect. I think they were cooked the Arzak method by being tied in plastic and steamed and it was served with excelent crispy pork belly and an awesome english pea hollandaise.  We also ordered the french toast for us to share plus more of the pork belly. The problem i had with the place was not really the food. It was the atmosphere (which the restaurant couldnt really be faulted for) and the service.  There was a family sitting next to us and they let their kid basically sit at our table for ten minutes while i was eating and the kid kept coughing. No one said anything. And the parents kept looking over as i was seriously annoyed and did NOTHING!!! Then the waitress asked if i wanted hot sauce or ketchup for my fingerlings and i said sure to the hot sauce (later realizing that they did not really need anything else because they were delicious) and when she set it down it splattered everywhere including my milk for my coffee and the table. She just walked away and did not return until she had the check in her hand.  The other upsetting thing was that i made a comment to the waitress inquiring how they make the hollandaise to where it doesnt break on the plate because it was cold. Which i kind of thought was awesome until she just looked at me like an idiot and said ""they make it fresh every morning and they keep it in a water bath"".  So what i thought was some inventive cold hollandaise was just a mistake. All in all i would go back though. The food was great.

Around Christmas time, I usually slave behind the stove to cook up my favorite jam recipe, lovingly laden it up in crystalline pots. Its rich, deep, shiny purple color is a holiday ornament by itself. Its name: Heavenly Fig. Well, Jam on Damen is exactly that: heavenly. I couldn't have dreamed of a better welcome in the neighborhood than this one: a breezy walk, a push on the door, a bright smile, a lovely table warmed up by a touch of green, and a menu that made me (mental) back flips in their gorgeous patio (mentally emptied of all its customers too, I am not much of an entertainer; I leave that to Matt L. who does an excellent job and is pretty talented.) I was highly anticipating the amuse I read so much about, and was delighted to see an old fav' on the plate: banana chocolate muffin with peanut butter icing. Two bites. Then, under my advice of her waitress (she was a darlin') I ordered the Panino Cristo, and was blown away. Not only is the combination thoughtful (the contrast of flavors is remarquable and extremely balance: salty prosciutto, sweet honey mustard, creamy tellagio, crunchy rapini) but the ingredients in themselves were extremely high quality: the bread was so freaking good that I thought for a while that I had been transported to Europe......extremely moist, a perfect little bite to it, buttery, rich, complex. A gem. I am not a fan of Metropolis coffee so that would be the only negative but it's definitely not enough to keep me away from this little urban paradise.

This was the absolute worst brunch experience I've had in any metropolitan city. Long waits for brunch are to be expected, but I want to get an accurate picture of the wait. The host gave us an estimate (30 min) that was half what our actual wait was (1 hr). And then he didn't give us menus when he sat us or mention that the wait for food would be another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, we watched while three tables sat open for twenty minutes while the line grew.  Our waitress brought out little muffins to tide us over until the food came, which is a nice touch - unfortunately, those muffins were the best part of the meal. When we finally got our food, one dish was delicious, one was good once the creme was scrapped off (it tasted like Lemon Pledge smells), and one was awful (the sickly blue, dense pancakes with little flavor).  The impression we got was that everyone there was either overwhelmed or didn't care about what they were doing. Service industry jobs aren't easy, and I don't expect false enthusiasm, but I do expect that the customer not get blamed for a restaurant's lack of organization. Our server complained to us about people complaining to her about the long wait, and then said ""It's brunch in Chicago, what do you expect?"" as though the problem isn't Jam's poor management or communication but our expectations. Wrong. If Milk & Honey, Flying Saucer, Flo's, or any of the other numerous brunch places in the neighborhood can manage to get us seated and fed before 3 HOURS have passed, then so can you. Everyone has an off day, and if there had just been one or two missteps I'd definitely give them another chance.

The service was good, the food came out with minimal wait time; it's just that it wasn't all that good.  I had the pork belly benedict, a friend had the prosciutto panini. The benedict was simple enough but lacking in flavor. If you have a craving for this exact menu option, go to Old Town Social for their version, it's far superior. My friend's panini was simply overpowering. The prosciutto and cheese were very salty and the sauteed rapini was very acidic. The idea behind the use of the incredients has promise, but today's ingredients were very overpowering individually, and thus weren't complimentary as a whole.  Maybe it was an off day, at least that is what the previous reviews would suggest. The only other complaint is the price. Granted, we didn't enjoy the brunch as much as we hoped we would, but the $35 tab + tip (for 2 people) seemed a little steep.

The first time i was there i had the Eggs Benedict.  It was a very interesting and original take on the dish, with crispy pork belly instead of Canadian bacon, and it was also serve with a light split pea sauce instead of tradditional hollandaise.  I also had a savory scconee which was fresh, buttery and delicious.  My wife equally enjoyed her egg white omelet.  The OJ was fresh and the cofee was good.  We sat outside in their beautiful outdoor garden.  What a pleasure on a nice day, although we came within inches of a bird pooping on us from the trees above (it splattered on the ground next to our table).  What made me hesitate to write a review was that the waitress for got to put in our order and our food took an hour because of that.  If i had been the waiter, i would have brought out a scone on the house and apologized profusely.  They did no such thing. So we decided to give it another try and came back with 4 friends this time.  The food was again good, although people didn't love their dishes as much as our the first time, but the food again took at least 45 minutes.  We waited, waited, and waited.  And the funny thing was that the restaurant was no totally packed.  It was 1pm when we ordered on a Saturday.  This is when kitchens should be prepared for the rush.  Instead we starved ourselves by sitting there, and our waitress never came out to tell us what was going on.  By the time the food arrived, everyone was annoyed and cranky from hunger.   So after reading the other reviews, i see many people have the same complaint.  Good food, slloooooowwwwwww service.  I guess i would recommend going here, but not on an empty stomach.  Make sure you have a lite snack beforehand and plenty of time to spare.",0.9934,0.763,0.174,0.063,0.49795321637426904

The servers and staff were friendly enough but both dishes dishes we ordered were terrible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and she ordered the french toast. I am from the south and a huge fan of biscuits and gravy. When our plates arrived I was in shock, the gravy covering my ONE biscuit was brown and looked like sludge. I took a bite and almost gagged, the gravy was made from a mushroom puree, which the menu did not specify. How the hell do you completely ruin one of the best breakfast dishes known to man? And without warning? I'll admit that I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms so my opinion might be a little tainted but come on, it's biscuits and gravy not biscuits and some nasty mushroom sauce. Luckily my wife loves mushrooms as well so we switched and I ended up eating some of the french toast, which we'll get to in a moment. She was disgusted by it as well.  So let's talk about Jam's ""the best french toast in the city"" as touted by our neighbors' server. Not even close, the toppings were fine, some kind of rhubarb puree and cream. The french toast itself was very soggy, the insides looked like uncooked pancake batter. Nothing like raw egg for breakfast... That's about all I have to say about that, If you're signature dish is a soggy, undercooked mess of dough and eggs, you have some problems.

2010-04-19,5.0,"Hi. So Jam is open for dinner now (open Monday, Wednesday through Sunday from 7 am to 9 pm). I've heard of Jam before but never really found myself in the area around breakfast/brunch time (mostly because around breakfast time I'm either working or sleeping, depending on the day). It's just never worked out, know what I'm saying? I'm about to move to Kansas City and a friend offered to take me here for dinner. (Note to Jam staff: update your website! Argued for a minute that Jam wasn't open for dinner. No, it is.) Cool, I took her up on the offer. Holy crap. Please go here immediately and order the tasting menu before they realize they are charging $25. I will say no more. Okay, no I will. I. Just. Ugh. Seriously, every moment was filled with ""OMGWTFISTHISIDON'TEVEN"" and then a lot of chewing and sighing. The asparagus soup was fantastic. I love the prosciutto but the best part was the citrus zest. It looks a little like Exorcist-barf but is really great. My friend and I got both the duck breast AND the seared escolar. The duck breast was really delicious-- cooked well and the thigh confit perogi was tasty. But if I had to pick one, I'd go with the seared escolar MOSTLY because of the pineapple gnocchi, ricotta and pecan emulsion that compliment the dish. I couldn't even begin to recreate it. You must try. The dessert was an olive oil cake with chocolate sauce and an orange marmalade. It was not SUPER AMAZING but the flavors were interesting and definitely after the meal I had, I wasn't looking for something intense. The meal was filling but not heavy so I didn't feel like dying afterward.  The best part, however, had to be the second course-- the foie gras tortellini with the snap pea puree. The foie gras filling is just sooooo good. It's creamy and a teeny bit sweet. The tortellini shell is made from duck skin. It sounds bizarre but, as I told my dining partner, it is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. At least in the top five. Behind my grandmother's gumbo (she paid me to say that). Reading some of the other reviews of dinner at Jam, I have a few comments to make: 1) There were two of us and we both ordered the tasting menu. At no time were we ever asked to order from another menu. 2) Yes, BYOB. Plan ahead or there is a liquor store a few steps away. No big thang. 3) Yes, cash only. Uh, their ATM is cool looking and the charge is only $1.00. 4) Portions for a tasting menu are going to be small. You know, about the size of tasting portions...BECAUSE THEY ARE PORTIONS FOR A TASTING MENU. Logic? ;) 5) There were not any other customers there (7:00 pm on a Monday). I suppose that might feel awkward for some people but I loved it. Our waiter paid us a ton of attention and answered questions and humored me when I made really bad jokes. I enjoyed being able to waltz right in and act as if I owned the place because I feel like, in a few months, there will be a line out the door. Enjoy the atmosphere and peace now, WHILE YOU STILL CAN. (so many caps) Thank you, Jam, for the wonderful meal (and the foie gras tortellini cravings I expect to take place in about thirty minutes).",0.9983,0.739,0.193,0.068,0.5737870619946092

All waiters were standing the whole time in front of our eyes (café is small) - annoying. It did not feel private. Kitchen is right inside of the restaurant, but no seating, as you would imagine around it.  PROS: cute looking modern design and nice service. CONS: cooks the carried dirty or steamy huge pans with food back and forth from the ""back"" kitchen to the ""inside kitchen"" just few inches behind our backs all our diner time. Not pleasant.   CONS: Food was so-so. I have eaten far better prepared duck in other restaurants. I did not like the taste of foie grass at all.  CONS: Portions are so tiny even of the regular menu, really like a tasting portion. Not filling. Would not recommend to go there if you are hungry.  CONS: Our waiter told us that if one orders the tasting menu ($25 sounds like a bargain but indeed so TINY), other people at the table are obligated to order an entrée from a regular menu, or another tasting menu. PRO: There is only one positive side of this restaurant. Its Patio. I love to sit outside. Their patio still needs some repair work, it does not look as neat or clean, as one would wish for. Bottom-line I would not recommend this restaurant for its food but I would visit their patio for a cup of coffee.",0.9552,0.759,0.14,0.101,0.519128094128094

Stop it.  -My husband got the egg sandwich and hated it. (So much so that later on that day I reminded him of how we went out to breakfast and he told me to never speak of it again because it grossed him out.) It was like a Top Chef Quickfire gone wrong.

It was yucky. (And I eat anything and love almost everything.)

You can actually have a relaxing dining experience, see the decor of the restaurant and watch the chef prepare your meal. Charming yes? I was impressed that the seasonal dinner menu was as inventive and inspired as the brunch items. I didn't try it but may go back for the $35 four-course dinner. It's BYOB to boot so you can't really argue with that. Instead I ordered a la carte opting for the asparagus soup (lovely presentation but bitter bits of lemon I can do without - garlic puree was nice) and the foie gras ravioli (ooh yes, so rich and so delicate at the same time). Don't forget there is the delicious Metropolis coffee to enjoy with dessert too. Downsides to Jam...they're cash only. What? Yes, so be sure and stop at the ATM before you head here. In this day and age it's almost unheard of, I know. The other oddity was the service. The staff here is usually super friendly but our waitress was a little...odd.

Very white and clean with hints of green and black. Ok. This place wants to be a bit upscale, that is apparent.. upscale with a coolness that says 'we're upscale but we aren't assholes.' My example of this done perfectly is Nightwood in Pilsen. Upscale and cool as hell without any pretension.  The problem is that what makes a restaurant classy are the details. The presentation. The price & giving the customer what they want. So, price, sure we can lean towards upscale. Breakfasts for $9 & $13? That's moving towards it.. The food presentation was lovely, absolutely, to be sure. OK, check. But our silverware was just sort of thrown onto our place mats at some point (which i kind of hated) and when we asked to get a half order of pancakes because we were getting an entire other entree plus two sides, so a half order would have been plenty, we were told no. They will only do pancake half orders for the table, ie, we have to order another full entree. I just think that's bullshit. Totally not classy. We ordered the lamb crepes and they were DELICIOUS. We also got the chocolate pancakes and they were mediocre. Dry.. They came with butter and a 'banana milk jam', and graham crust crumbles, all on the side, but we wished for something that made them moist. Or for them to be moist. We had a side of the handmade sausage and it was good, although not appetizing looking, kind of wet, and I think could have been spiced better.  No espresso machine. That hurts a little. I don't know. I think that if it didn't feel like they were trying so hard to be 'classy' and just were what they were it would be better. It was fine though, a good alternative to the norms of my breakfast adventures, and I do want to try that cheek & egg sandwich. So, I will return. But my expectations were maybe a bit higher than were met. I think you should try it, mixed bag of reviews to be sure..

Everything on the menu looked good - I literally couldn't decide what to get - and contained complex flavors and ingredients.  My egg sandwich with pork cheek was excellent, as were the fingerling potatoes on the side, but there were so few of them.  Companion had the panini sandwich, which came with a very small bunch of mixed greens.  C'mon, guys, bump up the sides!  Would like to try a sweet entree next time.   Coffee was only okay (Metropolis) but if you get a soft drink it comes in an 8-oz. glass bottle - NOT worth $3.  $30 tab for two people, one entree and one (non-alcoholic) drink each, not including tip.  Not horrible, but the portions could definitely be bigger.

Not so fast.  Jam is good, for sure, but it's pretty far from great.  It's a tiny space, which has its charm for sure, and I love the completely open kitchen - it makes the otherwise cramped room inviting and honest.  While we waited for a table, a nice fella came around with coffee, which as far as I'm concerned, was a big plus and maybe the places saving grace. Maybe I'm being too hard on the place, and I'll likely give it another try sometime, but I was simply whelmed with the food.  Not overwhelmed nor underwhelmed, but simply satisfied and not much more.  The ingredient choices are creative and excellent, but somewhere in the execution the dishes don't seem to match their potential. At our table we had the Egg Sandwich, the Eggs Benedict, the Panini, and the Biscuits & Gravy, and the general consensus was mild satisfaction all around.  I had the egg sandwich and it was pretty good, a nice sized meal with tasty bread and delicious fingerling potatoes on the side, but it fell short of a solid mindblow. As noted elsewhere, the coffee rocks.  Tasty and bold.  The atmosphere was pretty good and everyone was friendly.  However the server was just a little lacking.  Granted, it looked like there were only two servers on the floor and it was crazy busy so I was giving her the benefit of the doubt all the way through (plus some of our party gave her a bit too much guff), but speed issues aside, she was kind of abrasive. Ultimately, we all enjoyed ourselves and, like I said, I'm sure I'll be back, just not anytime soon while there are more enticing places ot check out.  If you have the opportunity to go, don't turn it down, I just can't imagine seeking it out in a moment of crave-craziness.",0.999,0.666,0.304,0.031,0.6744775800331358

I liked the juxtaposition of the concrete tables with plexiglass chairs. The chef started us off with an amuse-bouche of a chocolate muffin with a raspberry jam. So soft and delicious. Rule # 14 - there are few things better than chocolate in the morning. My sister ordered the french toast with lime-leaf cream (the cream was the best part). It was ALMOST as soft as the amuse bouche - I'd place it somewhere between a baby's bottom and a delicate earlobe. It was VERY sweet - maybe even too sweet. I ordered the chocolate pancakes - (See Rule #14 above). They were not chocolate chip pancakes as I originally thought, but rather the batter was completely chocolate. I like the chip variety, so consider yourself warned. There was a roasted marshmallow on top which was nice. They came with graham, caramel butter and syrup. I added all of that on top. They were OK - and were kind of on the small side.  My BIL ordered the Eggs Benedict with pork belly. WHOA. Presentation was spot on. And it was cooked perfectly. It was my favorite dish of the 3.

The hungover bubby had the biscuits & gravy which really had a fantastic shiitake mushroom glace, kind of vinegary, but paired with the dish very well.   I would come back here for the spanish omelet and add the white anchovy, which distracted me every time it was served out.  I have food ADD and this one really caught my attention and made me mentally cheat on my pork belly.  Sorry Wilbur.

The hollandaise sauce was also a hit for me.....the only thing I wish was that the english muffins were bigger or that they gave me more.....these were some saucy ass eggs and I wanted to clean up every last bite but in the end I had nothing to sop with.

Steak was as juicy as a skirt steak can be.....and the smoky tomato coupled with the truffled pecorino elevated this dish from good to excellent!

All through the meal we had to get their attention to ask for things like drink refills, condiments, salt and pepper...  Our needs were met, but not anticipated; and I felt like a high-maintenance diner when I asked for things that should be standard. I have to say too, that I think it's ridiculous that it's a cash-only establishment.  Not only are they cash-only, but they have an ATM next to the bathroom.  Instead of being convenient, I think it's a huge disservice to their customers.  They're not willing to shoulder the the transaction fee of a credit card machine, but they don't mind sticking their customers with much higher ATM service fees.

Eggs Benedict has been messed with many times but I thought this might be taking it too far. Thankfully I was wrong. It was an artful dish and beautifully executed, also a perfect portion size.

I had a LOVELY (just lovely) view of the line when I came in and one of the chefs had me fantasizing about erotic dancing on the table tops singing La Bouche's ""Be My Lover""  while he flings mini cranberry muffins drizzled in honey into my mouth...naked? No not naked, ""nude**."" My roommate and I came here twice in one week. The first time was on quieter Wednesday morning which was superior to bumpin' Saturday morning when sadly there was no mini treat from the kitchen (though the table next to us did receive one). Aw, poop. Next time I'll flash the chef to ensure proper goodies. It's a risk though, I might get banned for life... or arrested. At the risk of not receiving even one ""Useful"" on this review, I'll take the ferry home from Whackjob Island for a minute here. Yes, yes the egg sammich with the pork cheeks is quite remarkable but I urge you to go for the less obvious choices. Try the savory buckwheat crepes with braised lamb. Total darkhorse of the brunch menu. Haven't had anything off the lunch menu yet but soon! My overly particular roommate greatly enjoyed his steak and eggs and also his Spanish Omelette with white anchovies. This is going to sound poncey as hell but I like that Jam cooks the steak THEIR way... not yours.  Learn how to appreciate rare meat, dullards, before you foray into cultured society. Scoff. Seriously though, they're taking some risks here and so far I'm down with that. They probably won't win over people who want to mod the hell out of everything they order and have it come with extra ketchup. Sometimes I think it's nice just to go to a place and have them be like ""Eat this. I assure you, it will be tasty the way I make it."" Maybe that makes me a Food Sheep but at least I'm a cannibalistic Food Sheep. Mmm, lamb, baaaahhhh. I'll offer up the fifth star if I can still gape at the chef every time I come.

The menu at Jam sounded similar to the Bristol's so I wanted to check it out. Know the area pretty well, I decided to go during a week day because I just didn't feel like waiting 40 mins for breakfast. When we got there we were greeted. Those host was super nice. Now the food. The food sounded so delicious and the ideas were there. The problem is the execution.  There were only 2 other tables that were seated. It took over 45 minutes for us to get our food. 45 minutes for breakfast! So to start things off, our waitress seemed a little out of it. We placed our order, our soup came out, then she came with complementary chocolate muffins with spice caramel--we decided to save that for dessert (duh!). I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my cousin order the Steak n' Eggs. To start things off, the portions are on the smaller side, but I guess they had to save room for all their pretty sauce splatters. I think it was a bit pricey for the portion. It would be one thing if it was amazing but it wasn't (believe me, I wanted this place to be m-f-ing amazing).  Both dishes came with poached eggs, which were extrememly over-cooked. I could have sworn that poached eggs are like the first test in culinary school. May be our meals would have came out in like 40 mins if they didn't overcook our poached eggs (just a thought). And it's not like they were slightly overcooked but they were almost hard boiled inside. So moving beyond my OVERCOOKED POACHED egg, the Eggs Benedict were just OK. The hollandaise sauce was super rich, it taste like whipped butter, which in most cases I would like but I seriously felt like I was eating a stick of butter. The pork belly were measly little chunks. The homemade English muffins were the size of Triscuits (which by the time I got my food, wished I had some in my purse to satiate me). Eggs Benedict get a C-. The Steak n' Eggs were not my cup of tea. The rice grits--blah. The sauce just not the right flavor. Steak n' Eggs get a C- to a D+  I ordered the Turkey Club to go for my boyfriend. His comment, it's like they had too many ideas and threw it in this sandwich. Cranberry and Guac? and Red Pepper? I just figured they would have made it work. It just was under par. The sandwich gets a C-. So overall the place gets a C-...I guess it still passes. Not sure if I'll give it another shot considering how un-busy the place was when we were there.

2009-08-25,4.0,"Tried it out for the first time, since I live real close. I had been to Dodo before, which was well-named, in my opinion (I never got what was so great about that place - hey, I melted cheese in an omelette! Look at me!).  Starting out, Jam was not looking like a winner. We had difficulty entering, due to all the yuppie parents with their double-wide SUV strollers clogging the entrance. I don't get bringing babies to cramped expensive restaurants, but I digress.  When we came in and asked for a seat, they took our names and said 20 min. I looked at the empty 2-seater table right next to us, and looked at the hostess. She asked us to leave and go to the courtyard. At this point, I need coffee. We navigate around more strollers, hit the cool little courtyard, and contemplate buying coffee from the bakery next door.  And then, they came out and told us to come in. And guess where we sat....at the same empty 2-seater I glanced at when we came in. No idea what that pointless 5 minute wait was about. Anyway, I really want coffee. And so we sit. And wait. About 5 minutes later, we get water. Nice, but wrong color. I need coffee! Finally, our waitress comes by. Clearly a Buddhist monk in training, she moved with GREAT deliberation. I mean, extreme deliberation. It took a minute for her to put our silverware down. I beg for coffee. Luckily, the coffee guy is not a Buddhist monk, and when we finally get cups, from that point on the coffee poured freely. The Metropolis stuff is very good - high points. Also got an amuse bouche, which I thought too sweet - some sort of poppy bread w/ peach sauce, but I will never complain about free food, so no points deducted. I ordered the eggs benedict, and my gf got the blueberry pancakes, and here, despite the coffee delay, Jam earns its stars.  This place approaches Lula's in its level of attention to detail. I was really impressed. At first, I thought the portions small, but by the time we finished, we were both stuffed. I liked how the dishes were greater than the sum of their parts. The egg with the amazing pork belly (they do all their own charcuterie and meats), which had a light sprinkling of salt crystals, with the bread, and the light spinach hollandaise all tasted better together. Similarly, the blueberry pancake elevated itself with the combination of lemon creme fraiche (can we just call it rich man's sour cream?) and an excellent blueberry compote, w/ maple syrup.  Anyway, definitely worth a return visit. Looking at some of the other reviews, I agree there are some kinks in their seating and service, which hopefully will improve with age. I just like having somewhere closer than Lula to go for thoughtful food.

I've heard Jam does a brunch service amuse which I was wholly looking forward to. Sounded unique and enticing, but alas, none for our table. No pre taste for this brunch fan makes Brett a sad girl.  - Jam is hotter than a whore bathing in habaneros in July. Seriously. No a/c? Not sure what was going on here but it's gross.

Not an ""I'll ask the chef"" or ""Lemme see what I can do"", just No. Hmmm. The necessity to instruct her on how to do her own job was frustrating and trying to say the least.  - Malted Custard French Toast. The self-proclaimed 'best french toast in Chicago' was the biggest disappointment of all. Odd sour taste, mushy texture, zero crispy, caramelized exterior. Aside from the 3 bites that were tested by myself, Hilary and Martha it went entirely uneaten. Wasted money, wasted precious stomach real estate. Brunch Fail.  - Cash Only. Bah! At a dive bar? Yes.

Between me and my two friends, I tried the egg sandwich, the blueberry pancakes and the aforementioned malted custard French toast and was more than impressed by everything - especially the French toast.   I don't care how much other food you order when you come to Jam, you MUST order this French toast.  It's gooey on the inside, caramelized on the outside, and imbued with the most delicious, mellow, happy malted milk flavor I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  Really like nothing else I've ever had. The egg sandwich came with an expertly done over-easy egg on top of tender, melty roasted pork cheek with juicy slices of peaches and a sort of peachy-ketchup sauce.  The first bite was fine, the second bite was good, the third was great, and so on and so forth until I ran out of positive adjectives.  The potatoes which accompanied the sandwich were fine, but nothing special.  An original, thoughtful menu, and a good value for the quality.  Not terribly large portions, but who wants to be overstuffed at brunch?  FYI, Jam is CASH ONLY!",0.9676,0.775,0.168,0.057,0.43773148148148144

As for the food itself, I got the biscuits and gravy.  The concept and plating was cute, and very different from standard biscuits and gravy.  Unfortunately the dish was absurdly salty, so I couldn't really enjoy the natural flavors of any of the ingredients, and frankly don't really know what the dish tasted like.  My dining companions had the eggs benedict and the panini cristo.  The eggs benedict was described as good but not out of this world, and the bite of the panini I tried was flavorful and interesting, but I wasn't a big fan of the sweet mustard jam on it.

I had been wanting to come here for a few weeks since it opened and now life had presented me with an opportunity. Opportunity, don't knock, I know you are there and I am coming for you.  Walking in around 11:30am, I was an eager beaver. I was excited to snag a spot for a quick solo lunch before heading on a multitude of errands. Being spotted by the lovely Amanda H, who was finishing up her lunch, I knew if she had been eating here I had made a wise decision. I savored the menu, breakfast on one side, brunch on the other, flip a coin which would win? Brunch it is. Hmmmm, simple yet tasty... okay that doesn't narrow it down. Nothing seems outrageously complicated, but all of it sounds tasty.... hmm turkey club. Nueske bacon? Someone hold me. I think I might cry out of happiness. Done.  As I wait and drink some water, an amuse bouche of a banana mocha muffin with a peach compote... one bite and done and the light and yet subtle flavors made me smile with a twinge of glee. Then as I look around at all the other dishes I begin to worry.  Wow. His biscuit and gravy looks great, did I make the right choice? Nah... my turkey club will be amazing. It has Nueske bacon in it. Ohhh but look at her chicken with the quinoa underneath, that chicken looks so perfectly cooked yet tender.... I wonder if I could snag a piece before she notices.... no... that wouldn't be right. Oh good, my sandwich is here. Slapped within some slices of toasty multigrain bread, there is some tasty goodness going on. Guacamole and tomatoes and turkey and some tangy spread that whips this all together with that bacon. I'd like to say that I ate it calmly and quietly. I'd like to say I still savored that sandwich after the third bite. But I don't like to lie. Lying kills baby elves, and who likes to do that? I would like to say the service is top notch, but to be honest, these people are moving at a fast and furious pace that would keep most marathon runners ready to call it quits after ten minutes so they may not be spending ten minutes of your time to answer questions, they were still friendly and quick.

This isn't a typical breakfast spot, it's a little on the fancy side, which is a nice change for the other places in the neighborhood. The food is very clean!

BUT.... I had an all around irritating/unsatisfying/unappetizing lunch/breakfast experience so I will share. I ordered the Jam Burger which is a 2 patties of beef with an egg on top, tomatoe sauce, and a mild white cheese. (sry, forgot which one) and served on a thick hunk of bread (not really a good bun). The presentation was very nice and it honestly looked really tasty sitting there on the plate.  The dining area is very nice, drastic improvement over the old place.  (still a bit warm in there, not as bad as DoDo was though) We've already reached the climax of this story......it's all downhill from here. The burger was undercooked, underseasoned, and all around unappealing (I'm sure I could think of a few more ""un's"" to put in there, but you get the point).   The bread, egg, sauce, and seasoning were all far too mild to compensate for the huge hunk of ground beef I was eating.  I could taste nothing at all but half-cooked hamburger meat.  I am by all means a carnivore, but c'mon give me some damn flavor. My girlfriend had the breakfast omelette.... Sorry to say things did not improve...  She didn't hate it, but to me it looked really bland.  I had a few bites and surprise surprise, it was.  It was also pretty small, I wouldn't call it omelette size, really. I had had enough by now and just wanted to go home. Then the check arrives.  It was around $21, so I dropped my card in and chalked it up as a loss.  Not so fast!!  I was then told they are cash only.  Guess what?  I had no cash on me and was told there is a sign on the door that says so.  Well, they weren't lying.  In letters that were 1/2 inch tall and placed at knee level there was indeed a reminder for those 3' tall or less that they are cash only.  Great.  So now I go next door to the gas station and drop and extra $2 on atm fees for an already shitty meal.      Anyway, I'm getting annoyed all over again so I'll stop. I would actually give them 1 1/2 stars because the fries weren't bad, the host-guy was nice, and I like the interior space but that is as far as I can reasonably go.

The sandwich was very filling, so if you choose it for your meal make sure you are hungry and can handle it. Our server was spectacular!!!

The wait aside, the food choices was mind bogglingly good.

I enjoyed the pork cheeks even though it was just slightly overcooked and even better, I liked the pickled plum in the sandwich. Note one thing, the pork makes this sandwich a bit messy so I did see some eat it open face. My friend got the eggs benedict and it was plated very nicely. The taste was there but I have no idea why my sandwich came hot and her dish felt like it was waiting on the counter. Perhaps is just one of the kinks they need to figure out.

(You could almost call this area Wicker Park. Whatever.) I found out about the opening just last night and couldn't wait for the usual warm-up you normally want to give a new kitchen. But they didn't need it -- everything seemed to run just fine.   I shared a foodgasmic Eggs Benedict with crispy pork belly. OK -- pork belly seared to a crisp was not my dining companion, but rather one of the luxury ingredients that made this a breakfast beyond. (I have to admit -- they had me at ""Pork Belly Eggs Benedict""...) Even the English muffin was something special-- dreamily dense, a worthy vehicle for sopping up the last drops of egg yolk and the emerald-colored fresh spinach puree that was drizzled over the entire dish and expertly balanced the savoriness of the coarse black lava salt sprinkled on the eggs. The hollandaise was delicately flavored with basil. Pure, unvarnished win. The other dish I sampled was a thick french toast with a warm black cherry compote punctuated with globes of lime-leaf creme fraiche. This was, as they say, off the hook. There was a lot of nuance to the spices used in the french toast.  It was at this point in the meal that I knew this wasn't another breakfast spot drowning some pancakes or french toast in some sweet sauces and calling it a creative brunch. This place is for people who know the difference between an Vosges organic 72% cacao dark chocolate bar and a crusty Hershey's kiss from last Halloween. (I relent that sound like a complete foodie @-hole now.) Let me put it this way-- it is as if every single ingredient in everything we ordered was well thought-out and they just stone cold found the best version of every single element and ran with it.  The owner is the former impresario of Narscisse (remember that place?) In my opinion, he raised the stakes on brunch around here. Rumor has it that he is going to open late for post-clubbing noshes.
