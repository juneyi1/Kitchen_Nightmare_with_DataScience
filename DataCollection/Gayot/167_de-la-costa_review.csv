2009-02-07,4.0,"Let me preface by saying that I cannot afford this place. It is muy pricey. But I have been lucky enough to be treated to D L C three times.  First - the ambiance is fantastic. Most ""chic"" restaurants rely on lots of glass, steel, and bitchy hostesses. This place went all out on the Tim Burton vibe, which is fantastic. Artistic masks adorn the walls. It's dark and interesting without being the least bit creepy. I particularly like the DJ booth - reminiscent of the one in Zoolander during the Malaysian Prime Minister scene at the end. Which is also a good thing. Second - The appetizers are the best part. Go for the ceviche, which is the best I've ever had. The Rainbow ceviche is the best. Regardless of which one you order, they are all perfectly ""cooked"" and seasoned. Nom nom! Third - The entrees are decent. Fish is particularly standout.

2009-01-29,2.0,"The economy must REALLY suck. I went to De La Costa last Thursday at 7:30 pm and was one of four tables in the entire restaurant. At a casual little corner restaurant this would be unremarkable, but there are enough tables in that space to seat half of Chicago. Especially considering the abandoned room, I thought the lights were WAY too bright and I was disappointed that there were no candles on any of the tables. They could have added some much needed intimacy. The service got off to a slow start but was eerily perfect after that, Stepford wife style (or broken by corporate restaurant hierarchy style), from the hostess to the waitress to busboy and runner. We ordered white wine, which was kept off-table in an ice bucket nowhere near our table... this makes for flashy presentation but when you swill it back as fast as me, you either need a VERY attentive waitress or the wine to be right there with you on the table. The food was all-in-all good. We started with the very tasty ropa vieja with avocado mousse, then had salmon (slightly overcooked but spicy and flavorful), and seared tuna (black and blue... maybe a little too black). The vegetable sides were all well executed and creative. The dessert was dry and bland, in fact I couldn't tell you what it was but I'm pretty sure there were bananas involved. 2 stars might seem a bit harsh (seeing as though I was basically content when I left), but when I got the check and my share was $75 I felt underwhelmed and even a bit like it was money that could have been better spent on a new sweater or something. Maybe I expect way too much from the glitzy places downtown. Perhaps at a neighborhood cafe with slightly lower prices (and candles), the meal would have seemed a bit more enduring and magical.",0.9278,0.82,0.11,0.07,0.4815336809654991

Warning - the plates, including entrees, are very very tiny!! Make sure you order various appetizers. Cocktails are quite well done.

2008-10-10,5.0,"I had an absolutely lovely experience here last night. Once again, I owe yelp for helping me to make a reliable decision in picking a last minute dinner venue. Thankfully, this restaurant managed to impress my often picky boss and it provided the perfect setting for a staff dinner before the beginning of a workshop we were coordinating in Chicago. When I first walked in, I was uneasy about the dark and somewhat theatrical yet morbid decor; almost as if Cinco de Maya had exploded, with dark curtains and skeleton artwork hanging in the lounge area. Very unique. Yet as we walked back into the restaurant, I was impressed with their comfortable and spacious set-up (the decoration improved, as well). We ordered the cheapest bottle of red wine, which happened to be a Chilean Pinot Noir- very tasty, actually. For my entree, I ordered the crispy crackling pork with sweet plantain and black bean puree. It was definitely a larger dish- but I'm a big girl and could handle it. The skin was certainly crispy and crunchy, and the pork was perfectly tender and lightly seasoned. It was atop the plantain (delic!) and sweet puree- almost a chocolaty flavor. Overall, wonderful. For dessert, we ordered the Dulce de Leche trio and Buenelas (little fried doughnut balls- more dense than soapapillas) with hot chocolate and marshmallow. Both were rich and not too sweet. I am rarely impressed with desserts, however, these were both wonderful.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fine dining experience. One entree each and 2 desserts between us was more than enough food. Service was attentive and pleasant. Lovely!",0.997,0.76,0.234,0.006,0.5455921855921856

The two giant scallop was fresh and perfectly cooked, seating pretty on sweet corn, mushroom (instead of morel, what the menu said, they use some other wild mushroom. still  very good) and hericot vert.

2008-09-05,3.0,"I would have to agree with Carol K. that De La Costa is underwhelming.  I had higher expectations for this restaurant than what was experienced. First of all, I was unimpressed by their latin cocktails - I've had way better caiprainhas and mojitos at Cafe 28 and a number of other establishments.  Their caiprainha was not as limey or sour as a proper one should be; if I closed my eyes and tasted my husband's mojito, I'd have a hard time telling them apart. Very small portions for the cost, and quite honestly, the food was simply average.  I had heard that their ceviche was a signature item - but again, I've had better ceviche at Nacional 27 or Carnivale.  My husband had their steak, which again was a fairly small portion for the price, and just average.  We also tried the oyster appetizer, and it was okay. Service was not bad - our server was fairly attentive, and unlike some of the other reviewers, we did not experience any issues with this. And I have to tell you - although I love the decor of most Latin restaurants, the puppets in this one creeped me out!  I generally enjoy the vibrant colors and upbeat atmosphere at most Latin restaurants, and that is definitely not present at DeLaCosta.  It kind of felt like a bad nightmare, with all those creepy puppets staring at us from the walls! Not a big recommendation on this one, although I'd probably give it a try on Pig and Mojito night.",0.9912,0.829,0.161,0.011,0.4866091954022989

We went for lunch today and while I don't normally spend $36 on lunch, it was well worth it. The lunch menu is quite small but offers a few seafood options with the rest being filled with beef and chicken. We had the hamachi ceviche to start and I had the smoked marlin melt and my friend had the salmon panela. The ceviche was a pretty good indicator of the caliber of food we were going to be eating when our entrees arrived. The hamachi was perfectly prepared with a spicy jalapeno kick and a tart tamarind type sauce on the side. My marlin melt (open faced) was outstanding. The fish had been smoked to perfection then made into a tuna ""salad"" type mixture then topped with some mahon cheese and crispy shallots. It was served with some yummy fries too.

De La Costa, from the kitchen; good location, the food is bitchin' Prior to the Venetian night fireworks and architecture boat cruise with some out of towners, De La fit the bill for place (proximity to Tourist Pier) and hit the spot for food.   We had an early reservation for 6 so we could head to the boat just down the street in time.  Clearly we missed the rush but were there just in time to take advantage of full staffing and thus excellent attentive service was fully available.   The interior space is very visually interesting, very Spanish in a weird organic way.  We liked the white, curvaceous, bone-like, tile wall, but the Nightmare before Christmas dolls were just creepy.   I had an Acai Sidecar drink to kick off the apetite;  I'm not all that sure there was any Acai due to the light color of the drink but it was good.  The pear martini was better but I wouldn't suggest eating the probably intentionally not as ripe pear (likely holds up better in the concoction).   They brought around a sweet nutty small bread/cookie like device to whet the appetite.   We started off with one small order of rainbow ceviche which was great, tuna tartare salmon and hamachi layered with a tiny sweet potato crisp on top.   I had the lamb rib and rack with Israeli couscous and it was a winner.  My table mates had the Tuna and the lobster.  The lobster was accompanied by some bacon wrapped banana.  The consensus was that not only were the meats and sauces paired well but the accompanying mini sides were wonderful and well suited to the entree. For dessert we had the cigar; the matches normal candy but the espresso ice cream was probably the best I've had and the cigar better than a Cuban.   One ceviche, 3 entrees, 3 drinks and one dessert yielded $180 for three people.  Not bad considering the great execution and service not to mention super convenient location for taking around visitors.",0.9969,0.756,0.202,0.042,0.5729861111111112

In any case, the food was --- just okay.  The ceviches were done well but, again, I've had the same or better elsewhere in the city for less than the $16 per meager portion.  The tacos were fine, but also not worth a return trip.  As far as the entrees, my tuna was decent.  I tasted the halibut and salmon, which were well prepared but, to me, not worth the price.  And I certainly don't mind paying top dollar for a good meal,  but this just didn't do it for me. The rooms were nicely laid out and the eclectic decor was appealing.  The view was also great.  The non-stop techno music in the room we sat in was fairly annoying.  Despite the few pluses, I'm unwilling to give this place a second chance.  Two stars is pretty much accurate for my experience.",0.9902,0.805,0.151,0.044,0.5463032581453633

Yeah, that's right, free Caja China roasted pig on Wednesday. I am not fucking with you dude. Free pig. Awesome.  The drink list wasn't too amazing, but that pear martini people keep mentioning is the real deal. Not some absolut pear and oj. Oh yeah, half priced mojitos on Wednesday too, for your debaucherous pleasure. My Firefox says I spelled ""debaucherous"" wrong, but I'm going to run with it.  Alright, here's your menu so you don't fuck this up. The Fire and Ice Ceviche is a must. This isn't a small portion either. You could split it, but you might have to fight your dining partner to the death for the rest after you try it. Whatever you do, don't get the empanada unless you want some really odd food. I've never seen anything presented like this and it tastes nothing like your padre's empanada. I'll save the surprise.  Next, get the scallops. The scallops themselves plus all the accompaniments are so good, someone could have pulled down their pants and shat on the floor right in front of me and I wouldn't have stopped eating to look.  Dessert. Fucking dessert. You are the bane of my low carb existence, asshole. The chocolate cigar is good, but the hazelnut flan is better. Get your own because they aren't that big. Now I can't talk about this anymore because I can hear myself getting fatter just thinking about it. Matt L. out.",0.975,0.771,0.147,0.082,0.512712096332786

A delicious 8 oz lobster served over 'shredded' coconut chicken with a bacon wrapped banana on the side. The flavors are spectacular and is one of  the most delcious entreesI havehad in Chicago. A close second is the chorizo encrusted Halibut. Generally, I like my fish; fresh with lemon or lime and wouldn't dare order it any differentely. The Halibut took about 5 seconds to be completely eaten..yes it was that good! Now to back track a little, the ceviche. I like ceviche to be very delicate with more citurs then spices. De La Costa's was not what I expected, but was none the less tasty. I would highly recomened the Hamachi, but the other two were just a little too ""meaty"" for my liking.  Ok, back to the best parts of the meal. Entree's were...GREAT!!. We decided to order the chocolate flan and the coconut and lime.

Of the entrees we ordered, the Churrasco was nothing special, the sea bass was not noticeably Latin.  The best entree I thought was the pork (not sure which one as the menu changes daily) and it's crispy skins. As far as decor and the combination of the floor layout and the bar, it was interesting and pretty cool, but the bar did not look very stocked.  Oh, almost forgot, after having the white sangria at Babareeba, the white at DLC was not great.  The best thing at DLC may have been their freshly baked cheesy biscuit bread.

I thought that was weird.  The special didn't sound interesting so I was leaning towards the crispy pork dish.  The magic question I asked him was is it super fatty? Obviously there had to be some fat on the pork if it was going to be crispy I thought; I just didn't want to order it if it was going to be SUPER fatty.  He said, ""nooooo it's not fatty at all"".  Hmmm, interesting, so I said OK!! that's what I'll have.  Man, when it came out, it was sooooooooo fatty (at least  50% of it was pure lard).  We had to catch a movie so I didn't return it and instead picked off the fat and ate the meat (okay, I ate some of the fat).  Anyways, that was the only negative thing.  But my friends beef dishes were awesome, just stay away from the fatty crispy pork, especially if you're on a diet!

2008-02-15,5.0,"I love birthdays and holidays. I love planning for other people's birthdays and holidays through gifts and dinners. My bf over the past few years has taken my birthday/Valentine's Day pretty seriously with some fun stuff. Usually, I have no clue about where we're going or what we're doing, the whole surprise thing. This year, however, my birthday happened right after a weeklong vacation and being thrown back into work. Suddenly, my birthday pops up on Thursday really surprising the both of us. His work schedule was crazy and called and called different restaurants for reservations. He was looking for fusion places since discovering its potential at a fusion sushi place in Mobile. Unable to find a restaurant, I stepped in with the help of Yelp and secured reservations through the generous Yelper Matt L. to De La Costa about four hours before dinner. Matt L is the Yelper who saved my Valentine's Day birthday with a simple gesture.  Before yesterday, I had no clue what De La Costa was and how close it was to the AMC theater. With the crazy fun of my birthday, I didn't check out the menu and offerings to familarize myself beforehand. When we got there, I walked into the lush theater curtains and masks of the front lobby. It reminded me of a Spanish harlequin circus. It's definitely a trendy place. The decor seemed interesting at first with the dark walls, weird Tim Burton like dolls lining the wall, and mottled tables. We sat at the dark mottled tables, but next to us were marble white banquettes, just seemed off. Upon more time in the restaurant, the decor seemed like a mix of competing styles. I imagined that there were three interior designers who compromised horribly. The DJ spinning clubby tunes also confused the mission of the restaurant. The music reminded me of my clubbing days in college. It got louder after being there a while. It should have been softer for such a romantic night as Valentine's Day.  Once we got seated, we were a little overwhelmed by the menu and our waitress was nice, but not super helpful. She made me feel uncultured. I started with a fru-fru drink of grey goose, pear, and vanilla. It was delicious. I had two throughout the evening. My bf had some delicious wine to accompany the meal. We ordered salads, his was the spinach salad which was divine. If you get a salad, get that one. I ordered the white salad was okay. For entree, he had the crispy crackling pork which he enjoyed. There was a fair amount of fat on it, but still good. I had the adobo rubbed tuna. I had it seared all around and rare in the middle. It was incredible. The milled corn was delightful. It was done in such a way that it was like risotti. I kept on trying to save room for dessert, but man that corn was so good. The meal was wonderful and gave both of us happy buddha tummies after enjoying a great meal. For dessert, I ordered the hazelnut flan. The flan's crust was a milk chocolate crisp and topped with a sugar decoration. The flan had accompanying sauces flavors like blood orange, chocolate, and caramel. The dessert was yummy. The server gave my bf an extra spoon to try it. She really redeemed herself there. Overall, the place is super trendy, scenster-ish, and a little overpriced (granted I wasn't paying, but they seemed like NYC prices). The food makes up for the weird decor and trendy qualities. The tuna was fresh, delicious, and spicy. The milled corn was stellar. It was a great Valentine's Day meal. I enjoyed the opportunity to try this neat restaurant through the reservations of Matt L. Also, his reservation time was perfect at 6:00p.m. because it was empty to start, but filled up in no time. We had lots of time to talk in the quiet, dark, romantic setting. Again, huge props to Matt L. So, I had a great Valentine's Day dinner with a little help from a Yelper and Yelp.",0.9992,0.737,0.217,0.045,0.566889880952381

Afterwards, I had the lobster xim xim with the amazing bacon-wrapped banana - get this for the banana if for nothing else - and it came with perfectly cooked lobster (tasty, not overdone, slipped right out of the shell) and uber-thin slices of well-cooked chicken with roasted cashews. My boyfriend got the lamb and we liked that too.

I can't remember all the flavors, but, it was real good.  Everything was superb.  Desserts: enjoyed the churros, chocolate cigar and pumpkin flan.  Churros were 6 mini pieces served along side a brothy vanilla dip with expresso ice cubes.  Chocolate cigar served with a matchbook made completely of candy and a scoop of some kind of gelato.  Pumpkin flan was excellent, all three desserts were excellent.   Forget-ables would be the Crispy Pork and sparkling red wine Sangria.  At $35 dollars a pitcher both the price and overall taste not memorable.

I am going to elaborate on a few experiences I've had.  I like the bar and the way that it is set up.  The drinks are original and tasty.  Their party food, or small passed appetizers are very good as well and again unique.    About a year ago, I had a tour of the kitchen and they have state of the art (very impressive) kitchen equipment, for example the kind of stoves that are shipped from France in one piece.  The kind of stoves that people like Charlie Trotter use in his commercial kitchen.  When I was there, the line was run like a well oiled machine, as you may see in other five star restaurants kitchens. The river room is also very nice and, again, no other place in the city can boast an ambiance like that with a view like that.  I have yet to visit when that room has been crowded. I am not crazy about the location of the restaurant as I am not a big fan of Streeterville but I imagine that some people are happy it is there.  There really isn't much else to do in Streeterville but go to the movies, the hospital or Timithy O'Toole's and frankly, I prefer to be hospitalized than go to Timithy O'Toole's. I am not crazy about the design of the restaurant, I used to work in that building about seven years ago so I know what it looked like previously and it is hard for me to remove that image from my mind.  I also feel as though the whole place looks a little too Jerry Kleiner-esque (sp. of his name? but who cares how you spell it).  Kind of a rip off of Marche and some of his south loop restaurants - decor-wise only. The most amusing thing that ever happened to me at de la costa.... Last year about five of us were having dinner and we're all wannabe-foodies so we like to try lots of things and share.  We expiramented with most of the appetizers and a few entrees.  After we finished our meals, I asked for an espresso and my four friends all said, ""yes, I would like one too please.""  So we waited a few minutes for our ESPRESSO and finally I flagged down the server and asked ""where is our Espresso?""  And her reply was, ""espresso?  I thought you said ""SPECIAL"".   She thought that we ordered FIVE SPECIALS - as in the Entree Special of the day.   Wouldn't one question that order if that was what they THOUGHT they heard?  Why, after eating a huge meal, would we all want a second entree AND, order it as ""the special"".   I think only very old people and people who eat at Denny's actually say ""I'll have The Special please.""",0.9962,0.844,0.147,0.009,0.5652321174196177

The service is not impressive.  Because it was a slow night, everything came promptly.  However, the waiter offered no real suggestions and only generic, canned recommendations.  Likewise, he said they soup of the day was tomato and brought it out for the date.  It was onion - still, he liked it.   I ordered the scallop entree and thought it was fantastic.  My date had the pork, I thought it was extremely fatty and, frankly, just gross.  Really, stay away from this swine.  Likewise, I had a glass of wine with my meal and was taken back at how small the serving was - I have never seen such a meager pour.

Starters: Hamachi and Fire and Ice Ceviche were incredible. Empanada and Shrimp appetizers were also good. 4. Bread finally came and was undercooked.  5. Entrees: Most of my coworkers weren't happy with their dishes. The Scallops and the Marlin were the least favorites - both were ridiculously salty.  6. Stopped eating and moved on to red wine. Very good call! 7. Desserts: none for me thanks. Some people order the Chocolate Cigar which looked pretty lame.   8. Trying to leave: this location is awful for catching a cab...we walked blocks.

I started with the duck flatbread.  It sounded really great.  But in reality it was underwhelming.  There wasn't much duck on the bread and the dish was really salty. I got to sample the shrimp chicharrones and wasn't to excited with that either.  The shrimp were really small. They really didn't have much in the way of vegan choices.  We had one girl in the group that wasn't a meat eater and I felt bad for her.  She only had one choice and it consisted of some roasted vegies and chickpeas.  Don't get me wrong.  I happen to love both of those things.  But when the rest of us were eating elaborate plates of food I felt like she missed out a little. But on to the main event.  I ordered the lamb shank and my BF ordered the salmon.  I thought the salmon was sort of tasteless and dry.  My lamb was excellent.  It was nice and rare, and the fennel was a nice accompaniment.  It was definitely the highlight of the meal. When the bill came I figured maybe it woud be about $50 a head.  I was WAY off.  It was $80 for me and another $80 for the BF.

I admit the decor is impressive, interesting, classy-and very distracting. I'd rather eat at a whole in the wall and eat great food, than be entertained by a wall..that's just me though. I enjoyed the drinks though, and had a Cosmo with a little Popsicle stick in it-clever it kept it cold with out diluting the liquor. The food presentation was just as impressive as the decor-the only two things about the place that actually complimented each other. I wish I could say the same for the flavors.

I had the herb-crusted halibut-cooked to perfection..but frustrating because it was delicate yet over seasoned. I had some sort of chocolate cigar-and I felt really ripped off (even though I didn't have to pay) after the first bite.

2007-04-02,5.0,"Oh man, oh man.....  So many beautiful people and a kick ass atmosphere makes me hungry with lust as I enter.  I want my boyfriend badly and I want him now, and I haven't even started any alcohol consumption.  Well, this is a restaurant to add to the list for all of you, daters, out there. A little pricey for an average joe on the block, yet so worth it.  If you want to please your dam, take her to De La Costa and you might just get lucky. I am big on mojitos and caipirinha with its fresh squeezed limes, sugar and the best Brazilian Rum. It is a rarity to find a well prepared one, however, especially if one is outside of Cuba.  However, De La Costa makes it well, not too sweet, yet not too alcohol heavy.  Perfecto. When it comes to ordering food, De La Costa's menu choices are not just pleasing to the eye, they are also very tasteful and fresh.  In terms of flavors, they are inspired by the cuisines of Spain, South America and the Caribbean with a good selection of unique seafood creations as well as meat and vegetarian dishes, extensive ceviche choices, and a variety of hot and cold tapas.   If one likes to party in NY, one would feel right at home in De La Costa. This place is a perfect mix of dining and entertainment.  The place is huge, 12,000 sq. feet, designed by the infamous Suhai of Sonotheque and del Toro.   There is a DJ booth on cite, which helps to create the overall party feel.  As one enters through the doors, there are funky masks, weird chandeliers, mannequin dolls as well as other unique touches at every corner at this place.   The space features a stunning main room with elevated showpiece tables, dining booths, and a huge bar, where people can observe ceviches being made just like they can observe sushi preparations in Japanese restaurants.   The most impressive room by far is solarium lounge overlooking the Ogden Slip of the Chicago River. It featured floor-to-ceiling windows with regular dining tables by the windows as well as some hidden and more private custom designed cabanas seating 12-14, each complete with its own full service private bar and host. One feels the night is young when living De La Costa.  I, in my turn, felt inspired to take my boyfriend for a long ride, if you know what I mean,  and to waste this night with him.  This, however, is a completely different story.",0.9951,0.774,0.182,0.044,0.5699007625028032

It was served with fried green beans on a bed of unbelievably good potatos. Every single bite was out of this world. We had the cherry bomb and cigar themed dessert. All were good and the matchbook is a great touch. For drinks you have to try the watermelon ice concoction. It was really strong and fresh tasting.

2007-02-12,2.0,"With all the hype around this place- I was expecting great things and I have to say that I was underwhelmed.   This Streeterville Nuevo Latin Restaurant has the potential to be something great- great location for tourists, great room off the back with private cabanas overlooking the river, great menu, great music, but something kept it from working the nights I was there.  Couple that with the fact that it is expensive and the portion sizes are small, and I have decided it is not on my  current visit list.  Other friends of mine have also gone and experienced the same issues. The first time I was there, It started with them not having the wine we ordered, continued with no blue cheese olives for my martini (who doesn't have those these days?) and ended up with service that was mediocre at best.  I must say that the manager did come over and apologize to us and bought us a free dessert, but even that did not put the sparkle back into the evening.  Thinking it was an anomaly, I went back and this time we still had the service issue and the music was so loud you couldn't have any conversation at the table.  We also had to wait for our table- usually not an issue- unless you sit at the bar and the bartender doesn't know how to make or ring up your drinks.  A trainee perhaps . . on a Friday night? As to expensive- the one time we went, we split 3 appetizers and had 2 drinks each and the tab was $180.  Seems a bit much to me.  If you do go- try the fire and ice ceviche, the halibut or the tuna- all great choices.  The food is great- it just comes with a big price tag and a small portion. I love the decor- eclectic, and the idea of the DJ spinning tunes in her own booth while you eat is fun- makes you wonder if this is a club or a restaurant or some combination of the two. This place has potential- maybe it's just going through that ""new restaurant adjustment phase"" but until they fix what's wrong- I won't be back. If you are looking for Nuevo Latin food in a fun atmosphere- I'd forego this place and head on over to Carnivale instead! UPDATE:  3-20-07 Went back to give this place another try last night and the only thing that has changed is that they now have blue cheese olives.  Otherwise- I stand by my review- poor service (took the bartender 15 minutes to acknowledge me at an empty bar on a Monday night) mediocre food, and our table was crowded into a small area.  We were also told to hurry up as a large party had just shown up and our server wanted to get our order in before theirs.  Unbelievable!",0.9934,0.838,0.124,0.038,0.514752435064935

All of the food is very exotic and unlike anything I have ever tried. Their menu is fairly extensive and I had a hard time choosing because everything sounded so good. The drinks were awesome - I had the sparkling sangria which was perfectly made, lots of fruit flavor but not overly sweet. The muddled drinks were also pretty good (though not quite as good as SushiSambaRio's.)  We started with the ceviche sampler, which was excellent. I highly recommend the fire and ice ceviche. For dinner I had a dish called Xim Xim, which was chicken with prawns. It was absolutely delicious, especially the bacon wrapped bananas that came along with it. My sister had the salmon which was also excellent. I have never had fish that tasted quite like it. Every bite tasted like it had been infused with vanilla. The portions are also very generous. You could definitely get away with just ordering an entree and no salad or appetizer. The service was pretty good, although our waiter was a bit forgetful at times, he was very friendly and outgoing and seemed to know quite a bit about all of the dishes. My only complaint was that our table was super close to the other tables around it so it kind of felt like we were on top of the people next to us. I highly recommend this place for drinks or dinner. They have a really cool bar in the back that looks out over the river which would be a great place to start off the night.
