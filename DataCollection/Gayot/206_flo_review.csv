If you come here with a group be prepared to split the bill evenly no matter what you get. Unfortunately for me since I was paying for myself and my boyfriend I ended up paying around $20 more than I would have if they could've given us individual checks.

I usually go with something sweet and to my luck they had a category named ""Sweet Tooth""  on their menu. I went with the regular French Toast.  It looked quite ordinary and bland, but let me say after a couple bites and adding syrup the taste/ flavor was there! 3 slices of brioche dipped in egg custard served with with powder sugar on top. Classic! So if you want something sweet but not to sweet go with this option. To add a salty aspect I ordered a side of thick cut bacon. Yum!  My boyfriend on the other hand is all savory! He ordered the FLO Style. Eggs, green sauce (poblano pepper sauce), pico, black bean, and a flour tortilla. After taking a quick pic of his dish he destroyed it by mixing it all together! I don't really eat eggs, but he was definitely impressed with how tasty it was without having any meat. They have a great patio area!  I'll be back next time to sit on the patio.

Everyone was happy with their meals, the chorizo and eggs, the three different flo combos. The kitchen/server split my smoothie with my sister for us. The coffee and triple berry smoothie was superb-I don't even care for smoothies made with yogurt but Flo did it well. We had Leonard (sp?) as our server and he was very prompt with our food and beverages and kind-even when we were a pain splitting the bill. The atmosphere was relaxing and positive. The music is a calm alternative mix that isn't extremely intrusive in terms of volume. The lights are perfectly dimmed for a morning after a long night with plenty of natural light coming into the front of the restaurant. The silverware was wrapped, water glasses were poured for everyone, and the the staff were all presentable and neat.

Flo, in my neighborhood, heard so many great things... and am underwhelmed. I walked in to have breakfast (I was alone and I like to get some work done during breakfast)... there was nobody there to greet. I didn't know if I should just sit anywhere, or wait. A woman finally surfaced and sat me. A gentleman then came to fill my water.  Nobody came to take my order. I had to flag someone down. Meanwhile, at the other tables, I hear the waitress rattle off specials, her favorites, some popular items... I was jealous... why could I have her? I ordered. Food was less than mediocre.

2017-03-17,5.0,"Mexican food is not New Mexican food. Mexican food is simply is not as good, but a million times more available. Green Chile is not the same as green chili. Green chile is rare in the midwest, more rare is green chile prepared the way New Mexican way. And Flo understands this. They have a piece of art on the wall that references the New Mexico Zia; the four directions, the four times of day, the four stages of life, and the four seasons, with the circle connecting them all. It can also represent the 4 full sized adult meals I ordered since I wanted to try everything on the menu. In the end I settled on the Green Chile Stew, the Smothered Burrito, with Green instead of red (i don't love red chile like i love green, but they will accommodate both), and shared with my wife her stuffed sopapilla, all washed down with a beer from...Mazatlan!?? Oh well. it cannot all be New Mexican. I wonder if they can import some microbrews from Taos Brewery one day?  The food was genuine. It reminded me of the food from home, in the heart of the southwest where you find green chile from the finest establishments, down to under-appreciated fast food joints like Blake's Lottaburger. They put avocado on the smothered burrito, without my asking for it, because they know that I would want avocado garnishing my burrito, and because that is they way it is done. Also, they call the smothered burrito, 'smothered,' not 'wet' - the preferred Midwest colloquialism, which sounds worse than soggy bread. The meat in the burrito is great, cooked to perfection, and in large chunks. They are not filled with rice, and chepaer ingredients to make their profits larger. The burritos at $12, are 2 meals for anyone under 150 lbs. That is a hell of a bargain. The Green Chile stew is a perfect cold day treat. It comes with tortillas, again, you don't even need to ask for them, becuase they already know how you want it. (I would get avocado on the stew as well though). For me, this is the best AUTHENTIC New Mexican food I have found in the Midwest since moving out this way over 6 years ago.

We waited amongst a large unorganized group of people and had to ask a server to find someone to put us on the list after being totally confused as to what was going on. We were not the only people confused by this. That being said, they have an interesting choice / mix of bloody Mary's and Mimosas. I had the Jalapeño Bloody Mary which is literally puréed jalapeños instead of Tomatoes and it was delicious. They also make their own hot sauce which is amazing (I'm totally a spice connoisseur). They have a Habanero / Carrot / Honey hot sauce (orange), a Jalapeno / Garlic / Honey hot sauce (green), and a Chipotle / Mustard / Honey (red). I tried and loved them all but the red sauce was my favorite. Onto the food... my wife had, and loved, the cocoa pebbles French toast. Three glorious slices of Texas Toast presented perfectly with strawberries and delicious. I've had a love affair with good Chilaquelles since first learning about them at a little Mexican diner down the street from me. Since finding the Cozy Corner Chilaquelles, I've been on a quest to find better ones and have always came up short, until today. Their chicken Chilaquelles are the best of any restaurant I've had (out of about 23) in Chicago. The server was also quite good, so I'll give the lack of a competent host/hostess a pass.

The mushroom tacos were hearty and flavorful. The Skirt Steak Eggs Benedict ($14) was done to perfection, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce was a great way to shake up a benedict. The Smother Rachero Burrito ($11) was probably the best bang for your buck: a generous portion of housemade chorizo plus eggs, as well as an mound of guac on top.

The place is long and extends behind the bar where we were seated in a small room in the back of the restaurant. Our server was really great! He was attentive, willing to offer suggestions and checked in an appropriate amount to be helpful (yet not overbearing).  Drinks:  I ordered the Chile Verde Bloody Mary, which was interesting... and not the kind of interesting I would order again. It was average in spiciness and felt overly chunky (an adjective I feel should never be used to describe a drink).  Sweets:  Our table ordered the Bacon-Chocolate Pancakes and while you could visualize bacon pieces, the chocolate was the main player in this dish. The pancakes were tasty and sweet, but I wished the bacon/saltiness was more prominent.  Brunch:  All of our portions were HUGE! Chorizo-Tamale Hash - extremely DENSE dish with a large layer of corn masa. The sauce over it was monotonous, but the eggs overtop helped add some extra flavor. Chilaquiles Special of the Day - served an with over easy egg and I definitely thought this was the best dish at the table! Tasted fresh and had lots of complexity!

I opted for the special of the day--a barbacoa hash, topped with over easy eggs. It was pretty good. The beef was tender and the eggs perfectly cooked.

Inevitably, you'll have to wait to get a table for Sunday brunch. The Flo host will give you a free cup of joe while you wait. The coffee is stale and watery, but at least it's free.  I tried the Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas for my entree. The dish includes a side order of rice and black beans (I'm not sure why black beans, since Mexicans eat brown and pinto beans). The enchiladas were soft, laden with chicken and cream, but lacking any original touch - I had to add salsa roja to give it some flavor.  I found particularly unpleasant that my dish had black bean sauce on its brim. If you're going to serve a dish, please make sure to clean the plate on its sides.

Unfortunately they don't take reservations, which I would say is something I wish they would change. I love that they give out free coffee for those that a waiting, which is usually something we're all in need of during an early brunch. My favorite dish is the huevos ranchero - very well made, flavorful, good portions and delicious with their signature hot sauces. I like the green hot sauce more than the red. I also enjoy the chilaquiles. I've tried the fruity pebble French toast, however was way too sweet to eat by one person. I'd recommend getting a dish for the table to share, because it is delicious. I've also tried the breakfast burrito, which is good but probably not my favorite.  The guacamole is also always on point! The quality of the food has always been consistent and I know I can rely on them for a good brunch.  The place is small and does get quite crowded on the weekends. The service is always friendly, however be ware that they will not seat you until your entire party is present (which is also a bummer).

We had a large group (15 or so) and they were great about pulling a table together on their side covered patio area for us.  The servers were terrific about handling a group that size that included kids, elderly and a bunch of people demanding everything from Bloody Mary's to never ending Mimosas. I had been looking for a place to get a decent chilaquiles ever since returning from my recent Mexico trip and now I know I can get them here.  And the other find?  They make a green bloody Mary with some other type of green pepper that was a hit with our group. The menu has a wide range of times on it which pleased everyone in our group which was no small feat.  And parking on this stretch of Ashland is pretty easy too, especially on a Sunday morning.

2016-04-30,3.0,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I'm a real New Mexican. And this is a New Mexican restaurant in Chicago. So my expectations (nay, hopes) were high! It was super hard to reach the restaurant, their reservation website didn't fully work, and this location didn't return my reservation phone call for over a week. When I finally got through, I was able to make a reservation for 4. We went tonight for dinner. The neighborhood, atmosphere, and decor were all absolutely darling. We started off with a round of cocktails, which were decent, but not mind blowingly inventive. I ordered a round of nachos as appetizers, which took a pretty long time to arrive, but were super delicious. We decided to place our entree order when the appetizer came, based on how long it was taking. Most of us ordered the green chile enchiladas (classic!) but I got the veggie burrito with chicken and my husband got the green chile burger. All were tasty, but again, not authentic. The green chile tasted like a poblano sauce with cilantro- which was interesting, but should not be calling itself hatch green chile sauce. That's sort of sacrilege. Everything was MEGA seriously salty. A little too salty, sadly.  Plus was that our waitress knew what Christmas meant. (Half red, half green) Minus- we asked for sopapillas with the meal. Not only did they not come with the meal, but I had to hunt our dear waitress down to get them. And when they came (*gasp*), they were pallid, round,  thin, and sad. And $4 each. Also sacrilege. Sopapillas should be thick, square or oddly shaped, deep golden brown, and not resemble tortillas in any way, shape, or form. I wanted to love our waitress. She was cute and preggers and initially seemed cool. But damn, the service was slow. And we never got a water refill, even when all the other tables seemed to. And that shiz was salty. Le sigh. So, overall, I'm super disappointed from a NM standpoint. Otherwise, if you're comparing this to regular Mexican food in the city, it's pretty good. I'm sad! I wanted this to be my new obsession!

Got there around noon and were told it would be about an hour wait for our party of 3, seemed pretty standard for a Sunday brunch. After about a half hour we were trying to decide whether to head to a coffee shop nearby while we waited, so asked the hostess how long our wait might be from that point. She refused to tell us any estimate and said she'd already given us a time when we got there. They do offer free coffee while you wait, but the hostess also told us they were out of cups.  We eventually took some spots at the bar and placed our order. The bartender was pretty busy while we were there, so didn't get much attention (water was never refilled). We each got a savory item (smothered burrito, huevos verde, and chicken enchiladas). They were all decent, but were swimming in sauce. I got the burrito, and I probably would have gotten it without sauce if I knew that. At times it was hard to tell what I was eating through all the sauce.

I had heard about brunch here, and nothing but good things, but never about dinner so we figured we would give it a try. Flo is a pretty unassuming minimalistic place, clean, modern interior with some old-fashioned touches.  Overall nice vibe and wasn't too busy when we got there around 8 p.m. on a Wednesday. We were seated right away and the server told us the specials and also gave us a few suggestions of her own after I asked for some help. They have several varieties of sopapillas, these are lightly fried dough shells filled with your choice of fillings topped with either green or red sauce. We opted for the shrimp with the green sauce and the potato chorizo with red sauce, both were very tasty with a good amount of flavor and a little kick of spice. I didn't realize they would be as large as they were, so be careful when ordering multiple. We decided to split an entree thankfully, since the sopapillas already filled us up a bit. The entree we decided on was the pork in red sauce served with potatoes, this was our least favorite of dishes, while flavorful the pork was a little dry and the plate itself didn't have much dimension, very heavy on the sauce almost stew like.  We didn't think we were going to do a dessert but I asked what the options were just out of curiosity (I have a bit of a sweet tooth), the first of two options was another sopapilla just a desert version with honey and powdered sugar and ice cream which we decided not to go with and the other was right up our alley our favorite combo, chocolate peanut butter brownie Sundae, oh sweet baby Jesus! This was not your mama's brownie it was the most magnificent dessert ever and I've had a lot, the brownie seemed almost fresh out of the oven very moist ( I know, I hate that word too but no other way to describe it) with big chunks of peanut butter topped with a delicious vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup, so freaking good!

2015-08-03,5.0,"I have been a northsider since moving to Chicago, and have been attempting to check out the under appreciated south for a while now. Flo was recommended by a regular at a favorite coffee shop as a great brunch spot, and my boyfriend, who used to live in the area over 5 years ago, did not realize it was still around so we made are way to the restaurant. Can I just say I love bars/restaurants that primarily play mid-2000s indie rock? Because I do. Everything on their playlist were bands I regularly listen to (because I am stuck in college, apparently) and really set a hip, comfortable vibe. Giant abstract artwork in earth tones with ripped and restitched canvas covered the dining room and added to the hip atmosphere. Everything was very warm and inviting. My boyfriend recognized a few of the servers from 5 years ago - always a good sign. Our server, Omar, was attentive but not overly so and was very friendly and made great recommendations. Brought out chips immediately and got our drink and food orders out fast. Ordered a cholula bloody mary and was pretty excited about it - but it was watery and mostly tasted like weak non-cholula hot sauce and mezcal. Could have been more savory and was ultimately the biggest disappointment. Coffee was great, but I didn't get the chance to ask what they were serving. I got green chile chicken enchiladas with a fried egg and extra hatch chile BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED that it was on the menu as a southwesterner who has yet to see it on a menu in the midwest. Chicken was juicy and spicy, green sauce had a great char to it, and the egg on top was the perfect touch. Boyfriend got mole chilaquiles, which was the special on that day. Mole sauce was not overly chocolatey in textrue like it traditionally is, but it worked well with the chips and definitely as chilaquiles. I admit that I may have heavily suggested that he order it, and I wish we had split them down the middle! These dishes were both served with black beans and brown rice, rice was great but I wish the beans had been refried. We arrived a bit later for brunch and while they were obviously setting the dining room for dinner service, we didn't feel rushed or ignored at all.

The four of us ordered the Fuity Pebble French Toast, Cocoa Pebble French Toast, and Chocolate Bacon Pancakes with sides of bacon. The Fruity Toast tasted great, with berries on top which totally enhanced the flavor. The Cocoa Toast tasted kind of like cardboard, since Cocoa Pebbles don't have much taste by themselves, and they were not enhanced by chocolate in a similar fashion. The French Toast itself was kind of dry and tasted just like bread, not battered. The Chocolate Bacon Pancakes were by far the standout and were absolutely DELICIOUS! Light and fluffy with tons of flavor and the amazing crunch of bacon. By the way, the side of bacon was great too- thick cut and not too greasy.

2015-03-29,4.0,"I'm having a difficult time writing this review, but I think I'll have to settle on 4 stars -- 3.5 isn't available. So, Flo's food is okay. Good sized portions, but the two dishes I've had pretty much tasted identical, except the presentation was different. There was no distinct flavor that stood out in either dish. A lot of the menu items come with ""Flo potatoes"" -- thus I was expecting some grand thing I've never eaten before, but they ended up being sorta-mushy potatoes. Womp womp. The reason why this is a 4 and not 3 is because Flo has one of the best buttermilk pancakes I've had in this city. The edges of the pancake aren't smooth and the thickness tapers off so that the sides are crispy enough to add some texture. With a good amount of powdered sugar atop the flapjack, my ladyfriend said it reminded her of a funnel cake.",0.9711,0.82,0.153,0.027,0.5769230769230769

This is a pretty small place and it gets BUSY. We came in around 11a and it was packed. We waited about 15 minutes for a table. They do have some pretty awesome and free coffee to enjoy while you wait. We got seated at the table closest to the door which was sufficiently annoying, but the host did ask if we were OK with the table before seating us. I'd recommend just waiting a bit longer to avoid it, if it's really busy. Drinks: I ordered the Chile Rojo Bloody Mary with vodka and my BF ordered the Cholula Bloody Mary with Bacon Bourbon. Both of them were absolutely amazing. The best ones we've ever had, and that's saying a lot. Food: My BF went with the smothered breakfast burrito with both the red and green sauce. It was the perfect balance of flavor and heat. Guacamole was awesome as well. I ordered the chilaquiles which were the best I've ever had. My mouth is literally watering as I think about it. We got a nice side of bacon as well. Service: Our waitress was great and totally emphasized with our seating situation. She apologized and did her best to keep people from standing on top of us. Everything came out very quickly and our water glasses were never empty. We will definitely be back again very soon, and I may even try those huevos rancheros that originally brought us in.",0.9966,0.711,0.244,0.045,0.6161290322580646

2015-03-12,4.0,"I remember bookmarking flo last summer when I was trying to find brunch locations in Chi for my friend's Bachelorette Party. I didn't pick this place because we had about 15 girls and the downside of Flo is that they don't take reservations. And, it was in an area I had really never been to before and not at all close to the rest of our plans. BUT, I'm glad I had it bookmarked for my most recent trip to Chicago for my birthday! We ended up here Saturday morning. We only waited about 15 mins before they called my name, but our entire party wasn't there- so we ended up waiting another 15 minutes after they all got there. While you wait, they have free coffee available to you, which is a wonderful perk - but what I don't understand is, as soon as you sit down, the menu lists coffee at 2.50... so get your coffee fix before you get a table, I guess. Our waiter was extremely nice and talkative, but the only issue was- he talked really fast and had a VERY thick accent, so most of us didn't understand about half of what he said. The entire menu looked mouth watering!! And, if I could have sat there for days and tried everything, I would have. I finally settled on the Smothered Ranchero Burrito - sans chorizo (a MASSIVE breakfast burrito literally STUFFED with eggs, black beans, pico, and cheese - smothered in red chile sauce and topped with some tasty guar). The burrito was quite possibly one of the best breakfast burritos I've had in a long time. I usually pour hot sauce over everything, and this one was so tasty on its own that I didn't need any!! The Flo potatoes that came on the side, however, were a different story. Super bland in my opinion and it wasn't really remedied with hot sauce :-\ Everyone else really enjoyed their meals. I tried my friends red chilaquiles since that was one of the items I had my eye on, and it was definitely delicious - I'm just glad I got my burrito!  I ordered a cholula bloody mary with a  beer back which was delicious enough - I've honestly had better bloody marys. And, I also had a classic mimosa which was delicious. Overall, I loved the meal!! I wish they took reservations, but it's a small place, so I understand why they don't! If you're looking for a good brunch spot with some mexican flare, I would definitely check out Flo!

Stopped in the morning with my husband and let the hostess know our party would be for 4 but we were still waiting on our friends because of the bad weather. She told us we couldn't be seated until they arrived although they had several open tables available. Let me just say this policy of not seating small groups until the entire party is present is completely stupid and should be done on a case by case bases. Either way we stood by the entrance for a few minutes and then asked if we could sit at the bar while we waited for our friends. The hostess then proceeded to lecture us about how she typically seats at the bar and wouldn't be able to let us sit and wait there despite the fact that the bar was completely empty. Me husband pointed out the bar was completely empty and said we were going to order coffee and she said she would make and exception. There was one open booth that could seat 4 and she sat a couple that had just walked in .....and of course right behind them walked in our friends when she then tells us it would now be a 30-45 minute wait!!!! To say I was angry would be an understatement. Just as easily as that hitch hostess seated the couple that had JUST walked in at a booth that seated 4 she could have easily seated me and my husband! I don't know call me crazy but I would think its best for business to feed 4 people than to feed just 2, but hey who am I.

I'm not a fan of chorizo but I had a bite and it was so tasteful I may order the dish for myself on my next visit. Our server was a bit hard to understand as he had a strong accent but was nice. We also had a friendly visit from another server who overheard our conversation regarding another restaurant's burgers and even though we were talking about another restaurant she had only good things to say about them.

The article had a mouth watering picture of the Fruity Pebbles French Toast (could be gimmicky, could be amazing) and the rest of the menu looked interesting enough. Food presentation was very nice looking but the overwhelming characteristic of our food was watery/soggy. I got the Chorizo Tamale Hash - two flavorless runny poached eggs atop an extremely thin veneer of chorizo sitting on a masa cornbread base that was way too thick for the  other components. This was sitting in a flavorless watery red sauce with watery black beans on the side. My daughter got the Fruity Pebbles French Toast - it looked as good in person as in the picture - but after a few initial bites, the cereal topping became a soggy mush. The berries that were garnishing the french toast tasted like they were rinsed in water to remove any syrup or other flavor that might have remained on them.

The new owners have kept so many of our favorites -- not a drop of poblano sauce gets left behind on our plates -- and the duck taco special has earned a special place in my heart. Amazing cocktails and/or a kale smoothie always perfectly round out the meal. To top it off, the staff at Flo has always accommodated our five year old. Sure, there's no official kids' menu, but they were happy to make a cheese quesadilla and bring some extra chips for Mr. Picky. Today, the neighborhood is bustling more and more every day.

I had the Ranchero Burrito, and although the serving was definitely more than enough, the taste just wasn't as flavorful or spicy as I hoped it would be. I had to douse the whole burrito continuously with the green bottled salsa at the table to enjoy the burrito. The service was okay, the server was pretty busy that he didn't come around much.  As a Mexican so I had HIGH expectations for the food so to me what I had was just mediocre but maybe other items on the menu might be more tasty.

We had to wait about half an hour for a table but it its a small little patio area so that was expected. The patio is in front of the restaurant and is really cute. Round tables with big yellow umbrellas make you feel like you may be on vacation! Our meal was outstanding, really no complaints. We had a mimosa flight which was delicious, wasn't crazy about the ginger mimosa but the hibiscus one was AMAZING so it evened out. Also, I didn't personally have it, but the table next to us looked like they had french toast with fruity pebbles on top and it looked freaking awesome too! Something to check out next time...

For the record, waitress said it would be on top of the benedict. There was no sauce on the spinach and eggs didn't ooze over so it was dry and hard to incorporate. Ordered a size of chicken apple sausage because the dish didn't come with potatoes or vegetables (besides the awkward spinach), and paid $3.50 for 2 thin and tiny sausages, which are not even made in house so that's pretty pathetic (see photo).

2014-05-04,1.0,"Let me start by saying that I came here before, a few weeks ago, and we loved it. If I had rated them before, I would have given them 5 stars, not because of the service, but the food is delicious. We didn't hesitate to suggest this place for brunch when my boyfriend's parents came in to visit. I had high expectations.  When we got there, we were definitely expecting a wait. It was Sunday brunch and the place has really good food. I was actually surprised when the host said it was only 35 minutes. But 35 minutes passed, and he clearly did not have a plan. I wasn't sure about exactly how long it had been (I knew somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour), and I wanted to give him a chance to apologize for the extended wait, so I asked him what time we came in. I was a hostess for 5 years and know that in order to keep track of wait times, you have to write down the time the people came in. His response was a crazy look and, ""I have no idea!"" He was clearly not apologetic. I'm okay with long waits, I'm even okay with the host being off by about 15 minutes or so. It is actually really difficult to estimate wait times, so I'm sympathetic to that position. But when the wait time is double what you say, you've got to start apologizing, giving updates or even just look like you care, even a little bit. He didn't.  After another 15 minutes, the host offers the four of us seats at the bar. I have nothing against sitting at the bar and actually favor it when I'm hanging out with someone I see often, but with family from out of town, I want to be able to sit and talk to everyone. That's difficult at a bar. I said no. It was actually the only right thing he did the whole time, but I was hungry and clearly not happy, so I think he took offense.  So another 15 minutes passes (now it's been about an hour and a half) and my boyfriend's father asks the host again. This time, the host starts ranting about how he would never go to a place without a wait because that means they must not have good food and about how there are two other places on the block that could seat us right away. He even knows the owner and will personally call to ask if they have a table for us. Note this is all with a super snarky attitude and while there are other people standing right in front of him waiting to put their names in and he is flat out ignoring them. We say no, we aren't happy but we know the food is amazing and at that point, we had already put in all the effort and waiting, might as well stick it out.  The host disappears soon after and what I assume to be the owner, or one of the owners (there were two ladies there that looked as though they may hold this position), takes over the seating. Within the next 15 or so minutes (so we ended up waiting about 2 hours), a table gets up and it is cleaned. The lady says our name, we come up and she points at the table. That's it. So we sit.  The server was okay, not overly friendly, but definitely not rude, very satisfactory. He is not at all to blame.  The food was delicious, as we expected, but neither of the ladies ever came by to apologize, ask us if they could make it up, nothing. I mentioned this at the end of the meal, and my boyfriend's father, the outgoing person he is, mentions it to the host as he walks by. He asks him if they are going to make up for the inaccurate wait time. The host replies with much sarcasm, ""well was the food good!?"" And my boyfriends father replied calmly with, ""yes, but that's not the problem."" And he just kept saying was the food good over and over again. As this is happening, one of the ladies is standing with the host, watching. I expected her to use that time to apologize, but she did not. She just watched. Maybe the host owns the place and I'm just wrong, I don't really know.  Anyway, my boyfriend's father walks out, because at that point, he was frustrated and was just going to wait outside. While he was waiting outside, the host and one of the ladies stood less than five feet from our table and were clearly discussing us, as the host kept looking over and rolling his eyes at us. Considering I'm assuming he is an employee, I was willing to forgive him although it made me very very uncomfortable. He walked back to try to do his job and the lady stayed in the same spot, where the second lady joined her to start talking about us more. This went on for a good few minutes and it was the most uncomfortable situation I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  We paid and got up to go. I went outside, but my boyfriend's mother had to use the restroom, so we were waiting by the door, where there were some people waiting. I told my boyfriend's father what happened and it set him on fire, so he flipped them off. One of the ladies stomped outside and started shouting at him that everyone has to wait. We walked away at that point. As good as the food is, I will NEVER return. It was awful and ruined my boyfriend's birthday.",0.981,0.806,0.109,0.085,0.500656850459482

As I am always on the quest to get out of my rut, in the interest of expanding the yelp-o-sphere (groan) we decided to meet up at Flo's on a quiet Friday night to catch up over drinks and chips. The menu of drinks was definitely not what I was expecting, in a good way. I noticed that the shelf above the bar featured Koval whiskey, so decided to try their special barrel-aged Manhattan. I was pleased that I did, as this was the perfect drink on this night, and matched the décor and mood (if that makes sense). My friend ordered the wine (house red) which she stuck with throughout the night. I eventually moved to the wine, but am unquestioningly glad to have had the experience of that Manhattan.  Throughout the evening, there was never any point at which the space got overly loud and the music--if in fact it was there--was unobtrusive. The service was attentive, without being hovering, which was much appreciated as we ended up holding up the bar for quite a while eating, drinking, and talking. I suppose we could've moved to a table, but the bar setup was so inviting that we would have been hard pressed to leave midstream, especially as it seemed like there were quite a few diners coming in who had made table reservations.

And most importantly and often left out, the affordable dinners that are to die for. You can eat healthy here ( and substitute a fabulous margarita and feel like you balanced it off) and spend very little and get the quality of food you would get at some dumb hipster establishment where you have to get judged for eating McDonalds here and there. The mussels are amazing, get them as an appetizer, the nachos are not to be missed, ah hell, the whole damn menu is amazing, even the salads are big enough to satisfy. I've never been disappointed coming here; they also have half bottle nights on Tuesday and let me tell you, these are great wines to select from. So go!!!!!

It was a special of the day and I wrongly assumed the specials were as described; special. Instead I received a bland mishmash of dry french toast with a small amount of chocolate spread. Why me? Was I disappointed? As everyone else enjoyed their Mexican brunch, I'd say I felt like the one at the table who got stiffed. Mislead by a black board of specials appealing to the soft spot in me.

He then proceeds to ask if I want a sugar rim.  I say, again, I ordered a Manhattan.  He says he knows.  Do I want a sugar rim? Uhm, NO? Anyway, he brings my drink out, sans rim, with about an inch of frothy head on it.  There are two things that I know to be true about Manhattans; they don't have salt OR sugar rims, and they are always stirred, not shaken.  Yuck!  In a city like Chicago, if you're going to have a cocktail menu, especially with classical cocktails, you better be ready to compete with some incredible mixologists making waves around the city with creative, knockout drinks.  Its sink or swim.  I enjoy cocktails and I'm in no rush to spend my money on one at Flo's anytime soon.",0.9863,0.79,0.168,0.043,0.5323722943722944

I have had the cocoa crisp french toast - which I wished would have split with the table. The chilaquiles was essentially corn chips with salsa on them.

2013-02-17,5.0,"I wouldn't say that I wear the pants in my relationship but if there's anything I'm in charge of (besides litter box duty), it's picking where we go out to eat... except for just this one time, when my boo chose Flo and admittedly, I kind of expected to be underwhelmed. You see, I wouldn't say I'm picky, but I have a few caveats. 1. I won't eat at chain restaurants. I feel my money is much better spent elsewhere and that if chain is the ONLY option, I think my stomach real estate would be better rented by emptiness than soulless food. 2. I don't eat meat. Okay, okay. I definitely cheat on fish from time to time, but otherwise, no meat. Not that I'm offended by meat, because I'm not- I LOVE meat and of the past 6 or 7 years since I went veg, I've missed meat absolutely  every.single.day . 3. It has to be something really spectacular for me to patronize a business I've already been to, but otherwise, I like going to places I've never been before, broadening my horizons, yadda yadda.  4. I follow what a Yelp rating tells me pretty closely and at the time, Flo was dangling in the 3-3.5 star range. Not terrible by any means, but I'm never really running to a 3-star establishment.  So anyway, the manz picks Flo and we walk on over. It was pretty empty, but it was reeeeaaally early for dinner and by the time we left the place definitely filled out quite a bit.  We started off with a pitcher of red sangria, of which I have to cop to not doing my part on, though not for lack of trying. I just get all stopped up on fruit chunks in my straw and my date, well, I guess he just sucks better than I do... i keed, i keed. The rest of our meal was carefully guided along by incredible service and one hell of a specials menu- most notably the vegetable short-stack, which was kind of like a paleo lasagna. No pasta, no junk, just straight veggies and seasoning and flavor that was far bolder than I expected. It was certainly a heated battle over the last few bites, but that's no to sell their Flobimbop (a menu staple) short, as I'm a sucker for an over easy egg and bit of spice, so I think if I had make Sophie's choice style decision, I'd go back for the Flobimbop.  For dessert we got the sopapillas, which we ate so quickly I can't even remember how they taste, but I'll just have to assume that they were on par with the level excellence that came through in the rest of our meal. And I'd say the treat beyond the dessert had to be the price. Our Sangria pitcher added a $20 spot (give or take) to our bill, but our meals and dessert were less than $30.  I left wondering how my experience at Flo's seemed to be so incredibly above and beyond what the Yelp rating had suggested and noticed after reading through reviews that most of the lesser experiences were for breakfast and brunch service, which appears to be what Flo is primarily known for. I probably won't ever make it in to Flo for their breakfast or brunch service to see if the gossip is true- nothing against Flo, I'm just not a morning or breakfast person, but I'll definitely make it a point to return to Flo for dinner in the very near future... and maybe even let the dude-man pick a few more places since he's obvi proved himself worthy of the honor.",0.9663,0.792,0.119,0.089,0.4996926406926407

Highlights: - Chilaquiles - best hangover medicine. Cheesy, spicy, and filling. - Breakfast burrito - hard to imagine a better egg-based burrito.  Ingredients are super fresh with minimal grease, which is rare. - Carnitas Hash - VERY nicely done carnitas with just the right amount of heat.  Ask for extra guac on the side to perfect this winner. - Margaritas - though pricey, they do it right with their own sour mix, not that pre-made sugary dreck that most places sling Lowlights: - Crowd - don't bring groups here or expect a table within an hour on weekends - Volume - don't expect to converse with people more than 3 feet away - Service - Flo's popularity leads to servers pressuring you to move along Bottom line: I love this place for New Mexican when I have 3 hours to spare for weekend brunch, but that's rarely the case.

Super friendly and helpful. I told him it was our first time and he offered up a menu and some tips to consider when we are sat. *loving this place already*. The most important was that there are mimosa flights you can choose from that change from week to week. How cool is that? The restaurant is cute and cozy and you can tell long after people have eaten, fullness and conversations set in and extends their stay. When we sat down, we were greeted by our waiter, who unfortunately, was really hard to understand, but was very nice. After some back and forth, I settled on the smothered ranchero burrito with chicken apple sausage as opposed to the stewed beef, and scrambled egg whites.This was amazing! It was filling but light? How can that be? Well the black beans, fresh pico, spinach wrap were all helpful in the effort. My dining mate had the skirt steak eggs benedict and said it was delicious, but my burrito may have won out! Then lastly the mimosa flight -- it was a traditional mimosa, a peach mimosa, and a rose' mimosa (my favorite). Each flight was $12 but I felt it was worth it.

The bacon it was wrapped in was basically raw. When we brought this to our waitress' attention, she was nice about it and apologized.

2011-11-12,2.0,"Saturday Brunch - party of two, sat at the bar. There aren't many, but here are the positives. Coffee while you wait for a table is great (never mind that it was empty and it took 10 minutes to refill it once they were told). The green and red ""hot sauces,"" while not particularly spicy, had a great flavor. The poached eggs on the Chorizo-Tamale Hash were just about perfectly cooked and the food comes out fast. Now on to the negatives - service was terrible. We asked if the orange juice was ""fresh squeezed,"" to which the dark-haired female bartender responded that it was. Then we watched her pour it out of a 1/2 gallon jug with a label on the side. Upon inquiry, she responded that they buy it from an orange juice company and its ""like fresh squeezed."" Last time I checked ""fresh squeezed"" does not mean ""store bought."" In addition, she stood there chatting it up with some guy sitting right next to us while we had a chance to go through the entire menu and make our selection before even asking us if we needed anything. She never came to ask if I wanted a coffee refill, or even to see how our food tasted. The food was overall bland. The Tamale-Chorizo Hash had ""homemade"" chorizo, which tasted like un-spiced ground pork and a red chili sauce that tasted slightly of vinegar and little else. The black beans were also virtually tasteless. The Egg Sandwich was bland. It was supposed to have basil, but I couldn't taste any. The bread tasted like a sponge, the mayo was barely present, spinach was overwhelming compared to the lack of other flavors, and the potatoes were soggy and mediocre. The only redeeming feature about this dish is the roasted red pepper. Finally, for what its worth, the atmosphere was loud. I wouldn't bother taking anyone here that  actually wants to speak to each other.",0.9913,0.834,0.14,0.026,0.5020386904761905
2011-11-06,5.0,Sooooooo glad to see some new friendly faces at Flo.  Flo is under new ownership and they have managed to keep the integrity of a fine restaurant while finally bringing some personality to it!  Way to go!,0.8802,0.741,0.259,0.0,0.6515151515151515
2011-11-04,2.0,"Oh babies. My babies. Flo, where did you go? Flo has been a go-to staple for the Rose and Company for nearly 10 years. It's a spot we like to bring out-of-towners to for all meals. We counted it as one of the best margaritas in the neighborhood. It was a date night given, a place to get ""fancy Mexican"" for a reasonable number of bills. But babies, Flo has changed ownership and our first experience was so not copacetic. Walking into a familiar place felt very different. We were immediately informed by the ""general manager"" (he gave us no name), before even a ""hello,"" that the place was under new ownership and that they were ""very disorganized."" Okay, the Rose can deal. We actually knew this change was coming. We felt like we'd give them a pass, go easy on them in their first week. But to see it happen, to feel it happen, was another experience entirely. The energy emitted by this general manager (we miss Anita already) and the owner (rushing in and out hectically) made us uncomfortable, which is a feeling the Rose does not often feel -- especially so in the confines of a place so easy-going as what Flo once represented. We got our first drinks promptly and the same menus we were used to, but after waiting an additional half an hour before a second marg' was even offered and our order taken, we were just five minutes away from standing up and walking out. Babies, this is not something the Rose ever even considers. We've had mediocre service at restaurants before, and we still tip the going rate, but it's a rare time when we want to just straight up leave. During that half hour wait, it wasn't just us ignored. There were other customers who were not given a look. It wasn't even clear there was a waitstaff. This is not Flo. The people in charge were too wrapped up in fussing over being new and disorganized. Fine, but if you've ever worked in a restaurant before you just know how to deal. The new people in charge made us feel that they'd never even worked on that side of the counter. The Rose has been there, child, and these people act like they've never even poured a drink. Which leads us into our second margarita. Undrinkable. Undrinkable? We might as well been served a glass of straight up lime juice. And damn, this place and Barco were our favorite margaritas in the neighborhood. We couldn't even take a pull off that glass without grimacing at each other. The food, though, oh babies the food was just as fine as it always has been. Thank Baby Jesus. Even finer, we'd say, after the confusing and disappointing start to the experience. If these new cats in town want to keep Flo successful, they better bow to the shrine of Lauro (the head chef) and keep that daddy happy. The cooks and the old school waitstaff are what will keep this place afloat. And what we noticed, girls and boys, was this new dude talking to the old regulars like they didn't speak his English. You enunciate, talk slow and loud, just to think that a guy who speaks Spanish first will understand you better. The words you're saying are the same. You don't have to talk to people like that. Especially when those people are an integral part of what made this restaurant a success in the first place. It was a general lack of respect that made this experience so crazy, both to the limited staff and to the unsuspecting patrons, and we left Flo feeling a little sorry for the mainstays who are still involved. The two stars of this review go entirely to the food. This treatise would have been a glowing five stars if we had decided to finally review Flo, after all these years, last week or last month or last year. We hope the great food doesn't leave before the new ownership has a chance to catch up. But to be completely honest, we're not sure we'll be returning. If Flo makes it through the winter, if it's actually still around in six months, we might give it another go. But for now, it's obvious to us there's no desire to experience that again. Babies, the Rose's poppa will be heartbroken next time he's in town when we don't take him to brunch at Flo. If you're an old Flo regular, give it a chance and see how you feel -- don't just listen to this old jabberjaw. Maybe it was just a little bad mojo in their first week. But Pubert has never had this kind of experience at any restaurant ever. If you've had a better experience, we'd love to hear it.  This is one case, the only case in memorable history, where we'd prefer you not tell 'em Pubert sent you.",0.9962,0.822,0.124,0.054,0.4965121813473461

It was delicious. The calamari may very well be some of the best I've ever had and the sauces used for the enchiladas and for the various entrees were magnificent!  The only thing that is keeping this place from getting a better rating is the atmosphere. We waited for several minutes at the door before someone showed us to a table and the waitstaff was, well...a little creepy. I mean, they were very nice, but just sort of distant and quiet and removed from the situation. The service was prompt once we sat down and everything was well paced.  I would certainly go again, maybe for brunch. Perhaps a little sunlight will help liven the place up.  Overall, I highly recommend to go, even if it is for dinner.

2011-09-26,1.0,"This restaurant has the absolute WORST service I've come across in a long time. The server we had was incompetent from the very beginning and neither he or the manager took responsibility for their shortcomings. First, it took the waiter 40 minutes to bring us our drink order. Somehow, after checking twice with us about what we ordered, he managed to get my boyfriend's drink order wrong. We decided not to point this out and my boyfriend ended up drinking something he didn't order.  Then, we ordered dinner. My boyfriend ordered the pork burrito. The waiter brought him enchiladas instead. When my boyfriend explained that the meal was not what he ordered, the waiter, instead of apologizing, said ""This is good...you'll like it, just eat it!""  Finally, we got our bill. Not only did the waiter charge us for everything we ordered that he messed up, he OVERcharged us for the enchiladas that my boyfriend did not order. I tried to explain this mistake to the waiter, but he did not seem to think he had made any mistakes. I then asked to speak to the manager, who was a sour-looking woman who was reluctant to admit that there had been any errors. Fast forward to two weeks later, when I get my credit card bill. There was the one $110 charge for the dinner we had eaten. Five days after we ate there, the restaurant charged us a SECOND time in the same amount.

Arriving Sunday morning at about 10 AM, it was pouring with rain.  Even so, there was a line out the door which told me something had to be good in there--and I was right! As I was flying solo, I was able to find a seat at the bar right away.  While I perused the menu (for what I considered to be an appropriately lengthy time period), the lady behind the bar (who I later found out was managing partner, Anita) asked if I had any questions.  I responded saying I was a first-timer and I had nothing BUT questions. She pointed to and explained four or five dishes on the menu that had ""made ""Flo"" famous"".  She continued, indicating the acclaim was due largely to their green and red chili sauces, both of which have been prized family recipes for nearly four decades.  I looked back at her, puzzled and she responded with a look that shouted, ""You look puzzled!""  She left momentarily and returned with two ramekins containing samples of the two famous condiments.  Wow!  I am conditioned to typical verde and red sauces being watery, pureed peppers and the like, but no.  These elixirs were each complex, rich and velvety, exhibiting disparate levels of heat.  I was hooked. My seat at the bar was directly adjacent to the kitchen service window and as such, I could see dishes coming out in a steady stream, each looking better than the last.  The menu item that finally caught my eye was the pulled pork taco offering.  Described on the menu as ""knife and fork"" tacos, they were served promptly with succulent, tender pulled pork on two fresh double-stacked corn tortilla shells.  The shells were further topped with salsa fresca, shredded Jack Cheese, slices of pickled jalapeno peppers and two perfectly fried eggs.  On the side were two stoneware vessels--a large one with expertly prepared, piping hot black beans and a smaller one with a very tasty pico de gallo.  It was a happy marriage of subtle, welcome textures and profoundly satisfying flavors.  There was love in every bite.

2011-05-31,3.0,"Came to Flo for a weekend brunch after discovering the previous brunch spot we originally wanted to dine at was closed until July. I'm always happy to revisit my old 'hood, West Town and since Flo was bookmarked on my sister's yelp list and recommend my a foodie friend, we headed on over. Glad we stopped by since there wasn't a long wait, we headed over to the bar area and immediately ordered. Flo is an average size cozy space with some outdoor seating. It wasn't overly crowded or loud, like the usual Chicago brunch spots.  This could be a good thing if you just want a good brunch without the hassle. We ordered the full order of the  ""Brazilian French Toast:""  (3 slices of challah toast with sliced pineapple, banana, strawberry and a dollop of zabione, dusted with toasted coconut and served with almond butter) and we also split the ""Huevos Rancheros:"" (a classic New Mexico red chile enchilada filled with cheddar cheese topped with over medium eggs,served with black beans & a warm tortilla). We asked the server what the most popular brunch items were and she replied the Huevos Rancheros and Red Chilaquiles. I was glad since I was in a Mexican brunch mood. Our food was good. I was surprised at how light and fresh everything was; I wasn't overly full after polishing off my plates. My companion was not impressed with her dishes - when asked how everything was, I got no reply. The bill was around $26 with coffee and iced tea. A good price for a weekend brunch in Chicago. Would I go again? Probably not. Although, I think this is a good spot if you want an affordable, non-hassle brunch in West Town.

2011-05-18,3.0,"Let me preface with how much I hate Tex-Mex food.  Everything kind of just tastes the same, and has that gross chipotle-ish seasoning.   This place is different.  It's BETTER. I've been here twice, for weekend and weekday brunch. The weekends get crowded, as to be expected, but they have coffee for people waiting, which is a nice perk. In contrast, the weekdays are much slower - there actually are open seats in the restaurant.   On both occasions, the service was super quick - it took an hour from the time I sat down until I paid the bill.  This is super useful when you're going to have awkward brunches with people who are less-than-friendly to you, and you just want to eat and get moving. I don't remember what I ordered the first time, but it was delicious.  If you have a choice, definitely order the home fries as a side instead of the rice.  Much more flavorful.  Recently I ordered Flo's Original Breakfast Burrito, which I thought was good, but not quite impressive.  Definitely not impressive enough to try to stuff myself with the second half of the burrito.  My friend ordered a mushroom and spinach enchilada with garlic sauce.  That was much tastier, and I nibbled off of her plate. Of course every brunch involves drinking.  There were 3 bloodymary-esque drinks.  The one with chile verde was interesting to say the least.  The taste seemed a little 'off', and not quite to our liking. Overall, it's a good restaurant.  Not quite seeing how it's worthy of a Michellin recommendation, but there's enough variety on the menu that I would want to try other dishes here and bump up my rating.",0.9923,0.761,0.184,0.054,0.5005847953216375

We've only eaten dinner here once, and it was for Valentine's Day.  They had a special Valentine's Day menu and it was incredible.  But if you're in the area and you're hungry for breakfast food, nobody does it better.  Just get whatever you can slather in sauce, because not only do they make their own fresh red and green chile sauces, they also make their own hot sauces for the table, and they are all the bomb.  I always end up putting at least two or three sauces on whatever I eat, not because it needs it but because the sauce is so amazing. And now you can buy all of the sauces to take home!  Score!! I don't know what to tell you to get, because everything is good.  But, the things I get the most are the Huevos Verdes (with a side of red chile sauce), both of the awesome smoothies and the Eggs Flo (their take on benedict and their hollandaise is great).  The 3 berry zabione pancakes are also rich and delicious - I'm not able to get a whole sweet entree just for myself, but we always like to get one for the table - like an appetizer, if you will.  Please feel free to steal that idea - everyone should do it.",0.9956,0.803,0.181,0.015,0.6547619047619047

First things, first: the atmosphere is really laid back and while it's busy, it's not crowded and you don't feel squished or rushed. The decor is very mellow, pleasant, Southwest-y colors, I was most intrigued by a really cool mirror...anyway, it's nice.  We walked in around 11 and were quoted at 15 minutes for a table for 2, not bad at all considering the wait at places like Bongo. Cut that wait to 3 minutes when both parties ahead of us don't want to sit at the bar (which is nonsense because it was delightful).  I immediately ordered the Rojo something or other Bloody Maria, which was awesome. Just the right amount of spice and celery salt around the rim (my fav). For food, I ordered the chorizo scramble and destroyed that thing because it was delicious, so delicious that when I had to make a fullness-related sacrifice, I opted to finish it and not eat my potatoes. They also serve black beans with pretty much everything, which again is a total win. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito, I didn't try it but I want to next time I go, it had very delicious looking veggies, sour cream and cheese in it. I did try a few bites of my potatoes and they were ok, but not wow-good. The hot sauces are bomb, I even liked the chipotle one, which usually isn't my bag.

It's a great weekend brunch menu with plenty of options: sweets, eggs, lunch options and southwestern influenced brunch choices (Huevos Rancheros,Huevos Verdes,Red Chilaquiles,Flo's Original Burrito,Chorizo Scramble...you get the idea). Maybe I spoiled my Huevos appetite the weekend previous at Milk & Honey, but I could not pass up on banana chocolate chip pancakes. Erica went traditional with a breakfast platter of eggs, toast, bacon and  potatoes. Geoff always gets the granola with yogurt - a decision I understood after my small taste. Finally, I had to sit across from Ashley's very tempting french toast.  We had a nice meal. Simple, fast, cheap ($60 all in for the table) and tasty.

Since moving to the west side of the city, I've sought refuge within Flo's walls many times and have yet to be let down. The brunch menu's Chorizo Scramble is one of the best things I've consumed before noon, ever. Spicy, savory, warm and generously portioned, I can never finish it, but always try. There are a few healthier options at brunch, like yogurt with granola and fruit smoothies, but the more sinful side of the menu wins hands down. Same goes for dinnertime, where fish tacos rule. Kid-friendly, but as a childless patron, I appreciate that they don't seem to run wild here, as at some other brunch places.

Like clams they are usually prepared very boring with white wine, butter, garlic, and shallots.

I loved it! The mussels were super fresh and it comes with a side of butter toasted baguette. I will be going back for the same meal as soon as I can.

2010-05-11,5.0,"I have been having breakfast at Flo every Saturday for the last 7 years.  Taking into consideration the occasional illness, out of town trips, and other numerous visits for dinner, I'll claim that I have eaten at Flo roughly 500 times.  No other restaurant can lay that kind of claim for me.  My Saturday morning routine consists of a half hour of cardio exercise; an hour of weight training; and, to reward myself for all that effort, a nice cold margarita at Flo and whatever breakfast dish strikes my fancy that morning.   With this kind of relationship with the restaurant, this review will be very biased.  However I will try to be as objective as possible.  Service is always very warm and friendly.  Hot coffee is on offer while you wait.  The customized Intelligentsia blend is strong and dark.  My usual favorite dishes are the following.  The Eggs Flo.  2 thick slices of brioche, topped with 2 almost equally thick slices of smoked turkey, topped by freshly poached eggs over a river of Hollandaise sauce.  All this goodness sits on a bed of raw spinach.  The Borracho Burger.  My hangover cure.  Thick patty cooked to temperature, on an eggy, buttery brioche bun, topped with a punchy salsa.  Wake me up!  The Flo Hash.  It is a tangle of diced turkey sautéed with onions, zucchini, peppers, and other veggies.  The other half of the dish is a 'hash' of diced fresh fruit.  The house-made Granola.  It is a giant bowl of crunchy goodness with a thick glob of yogurt.  Of all dishes, this is the one that I can never finish completely.  The Egg Sandwich.  Brioche toast filled with scrambled egg, and stacked perfectly with layers of raw spinach and roasted red peppers.  These are just my favorites.   A new item on the menu, the Guadalajara Scramble, is my current favorite.  It is basically skirt steak fajita with scrambled eggs, sided with black beans.  The steak is tender and well-seasoned, the veggies crunchy, and strips of fried tortillas round out the dish.  Yummy deliciousness. Why 5 stars?  It is a neighborhood gem, and a bustling place.  The staff is warm and friendly.  The manager is gracious and an excellent bartender.  The cocktails are strong.  The food is delicious.  It is a part of my daily life, and I just love, love, love Flo.  Goober says hey!",0.997,0.794,0.183,0.023,0.5355211769362712

The only thing that stood out was the sauce, more about the sauce later..... This place would work as a back brunch spot if your go to choices were already taken, kinda the plan B of brunch spots in Noble Square.  Some other random comments:  Bonus points for the free cookies and coffee while you wait, the cookies were a treat.  Penalty points for the bartender that was serving us. Talk about grumpy pants, and believe me we're fun to serve so there was no need for the debbie downer attitude. Case in point:  Us:  ""Hi, what should we get, what would you recommend?""  Grumpy Pants: ""Something with our sauces, we're known for our sauces. See all those people waiting? They're here for our sauces, for sixty years we've been making these sauces."" Us: (speaking to yourselves) ""Whoa, I guess we better get something with the sauces"" Apparently, not everyone knows about Flo's sauces because we sure didn't.  To sum up: Cookies: Good Sauces: Good, because as you now know that's what they're known for.   Service: A little slow Attitude: Not so much Breakfast itself: split decision. There's other places in Chicago for brunch, I've got a long list of them and Flo isn't going to be on it.",0.9915,0.782,0.169,0.049,0.5418518518518518

I think due to the snow the other day this is why we were seated right away. Bonus!  Flo has a variety of brunch options-from sweet things like french toast to a wide range of different Mexican/New Mexican dishes. I decided on the Huevos Verdes, which is corn tortillas topped with overeasy eggs (they say fried but its not) green chile, pico de gallo and filled with chorizo.  The chorizo delivered a nice zesty flavor and the green chile was delicious. I don't normally like pico de gallo, but I highly recommend it here!  Ok, the only problem I had here was the fact that I kept on feeling that our waitress was trying to get us to leave quick. She kept hovering over our table and had asked us if we were done when clearly we still had a lot of food on our plates. I know the crowd was starting to build and all but come on!

I went about 2 yrs ago, and don't really remember the experience, which usually is a bad sign, but I thought, perhaps things have changed, cause look at that line.  And, looking on the reviews here, there are a lot of Flo enthusiasts. But hell, people, I just don't get it. We had a late brunch there on Sunday, late enough for no line (which is why we went). It was meh. The waiter had a little attitude - told us to hurry and order because the kitchen was switching over at 3. It was 2:15. But, he kept the refills coming, and was competent, if a bit stiff with us.  Anyway, the food is fine. The green and red salsas they bring to the table are good. Although the red is hotter than the green, which is new on me. I got chilaquiles w/ chorizo, and they were fine. Really messy. The pico was fine. The black beans were entirely unseasoned, but I fixed that. Again, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  Maybe I hadn't ordered the right things, but I actually thought it was all a bit bland. My meal was not greater than the sum of its parts. Each component was not seasoned. It was more like, let's make some eggs, put some sloppy-ass sauce all over it, and then cover it in cheese and tortilla chips. Not bad, just.....nothing special.  If I had waited in line for any period of time for this meal, I would have been PISSED. If you're going to wait in line, go to Lula, or Bongo Room, or Milk & Honey, or all the other places with absurd wait lines that are almost kind of worth the wait. This place ain't on that list. However, if it's not busy, it's certainly worth a try. If it is busy, just go to the Golden Nugget and order off the Mexican side of their menu. It's pretty much the same food.

We had a very slight misfire with the French toast, as it came out with sauce on top as opposed to on the side as requested. Normally, this might not even make it into the review, but it is, due to the fact that they handled it so well. They brought out the food with the sauce on top and we alerted the server this was not as it had been requested. Immediately, she apologized, took back the plate, apologized again, had the item correctly replaced in under 5 minutes, and then removed the dish from the bill.

Okay okay, I like a little spice... sometimes... but not too spicy-- I know what you're thinking, 'hey wait, aren't you Mexican?-- yes, yes I am except that I have all my taste buds, they still work, unlike my mom's who killed them all with her homemade super spicy 'cry at the table every night at dinner' sauce.  I like to enjoy my food, every flavor, every taste... so needless to say my stamina for spice is very low. I had a choice between the chicken chile verde and the calabasa quesadillas.  The chicken chile had a red flag from the start because of the word 'chile' so I opted for the quesadillas thinking I was safe... nope! They were hot! Real hot! I had about 3 bites and had to break for a few minutes to stop the burning sting in my mouth then go back to eating a few more bites and on and on.  So you can imagine how long it took me to eat my food.   The thing that saved me was their sangria! There was a choice between red wine sangria and white wine sangria... I ordered them mixed.  It was the best of both worlds as Miley Cyrus says... I thoroughly enjoyed my carafe of sangria.  My only complaint was that there was not enough fruit in it.  I like to munch on the fruit... I thought that was the whole point.   Back to the main course, so their calabasa quesadillas were spicy but still good.  If you like spicy go for it.  If not, skip it and order something else.  Their enchiladas were good as well and you get to pick what you want to put in them.  Also, they have 4 sauces on their menu ranging from mild to super hot.  Choose wisely. For dessert, I ordered the Portuguese orange cake... doesn't sound too tasty, does it?  But I thought I'd be adventurous.  It was so great.  The cake had a very light orange taste and the texture was like angel food cake.  They topped it with thick whip cream, yum, and garnished with blueberries and raspberries.  I stick by my choice. It was the best part of the meal. Overall good food and the atmosphere was good.  It was pretty dark in here so it's good for that date you want to put a paper bag over...

Any component of breakfast can be incorporated into bruch, lunch, linner and dinner and there is never a problem. Take bacon for example. Bacon is a breakfast staple but also compliments any other meal, this can be said of toast, eggs and other items as well. That being said, I am very difficult to please when it comes to going to a restaurant for breakfast. It almost always is something I can whip up in my kitchen and I just dont see the value in it.  Flo is NOT one of the exceptions. OVER RATED. Why do trendy frou frou brunch spots get so much love on yelp? Can't you guys make eggs yourself? Nothing stands out. Suzy and I went here for V day brunch. She ordered the bfast burrito and essential it was equivalent in size and taste to 2 mcdonald bfast burritos. I went with the steak sammy and we shared a banana pancakes order. The accompanying home fries sucked. Very oily, with no real texture. Like a oily mush. The steak sammy was ok but it has been done with much more success at Kinzie Street Chop House or even Monk's. The only redemption was the the order of banana pancakes. This I could not make myself and actually enjoyed. Cozy Corner does it better though. Flo is over rated and people that come here are sold on the hype. I would say that places like this serve their purpose as brunch date venues, so I am not really hating on it as much as I normally would. I just think Bongo Room pulls it off while Flo falters.

Fast forward a three years later and I find myself revisiting the same place with the very same bride, her husband and their new 3-month old.

I wound up having the French toast (with almond butter and syrup) and the Eggs Flo (an Eggs Benedict with brioche toast and grilled smoked turkey instead). The French Toast was very good. I wasn't too keen on the Eggs Flo, because I'm not too big on the smoked turkey. For those who like smoked turkey, I would not hesitate to recommend Eggs Flo.  The building and decor is very charming. Dark wood and the original architecture looks like it's still intact. It doesn't have that modern, cold, froufrou feeling.

The blueberries just added a touch of sweetness and tartness at the same time. The pancakes also came with almond butter which was to die for! I've never had almond butter before and now I'm hooked.

It was around 6 pm, so the place wasn't hopping, but then again, I am not sure what their business is like (aside from their brunch, which i hear is amazing). Basically my rating comes from the food service, and overall appeal. I wasn't blown away, but then again, it didn't completely suck.  I will say the decor is amazing. Old brick of the building lines one wall, while the other is painted and plastered and adorned with random vintage mirrors. Artwork also lines the walls, which adds a nice touch. The original architecture of the building has been kept in tact almost...the tin roof is painted, and very detailed woodwork is near the entrance, although this is closed off by glass windows, as I am assuming it was once an old storefront of some sort. The lighting is quite soft, which would make this a nice dating or lounge spot. There is a small bar, and they provide a rather extensive drink list.  Everyone ordered enchiladas...which doesn't offer much variety in terms of what the menu is like. I will say that there are tacos and fajitas...there are also some non-Mexican dishes available, but be prepared to expect some Latin flair to almost everything. We ordered an appetizer of guacamole, which was quite good.  Onto the food! I had potato and cheese enchiladas with a garlic cream sauce. My sides were rice and corn salad. The corn salad was tasty, the rice could have used a little something. The enchiladas themselves smelled like conversation hearts for some reason, but wow...were they good! I ate practically everything, and as almost all of my friends know, I can hardly finish anything without asking for a container. One co-worker ordered the same but with a red chile sauce that she thankfully had on the side...one tiny taste of it made her cringe it was so hot. Everyone else seemed to enjoy what they had, so no complaints there.  The service was good, everyone was quite attentive to giving us more water, fresh silverware, and the like.  We did not get dessert...no one could eat another bite, although I hear their coconut cake is quite the yummy. I suppose I will have to make another trip here for that OR the brunch, which most people seem to be raving about.

I admit I don't make it over this way very often.  Or ever, really.  Two busses (one of which, the 66, makes me homicidal) is pushing it for me.  But I'm SO glad Paige W and her friend suggested this for brunch this morning (er, afternoon...). I arrived first, and was told there was a 30-40 minute wait.  It worked out since some members of our party were running late, and the lovely hostess pointed me to the free coffee while I waited.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but I thought that was nice - a great way to warm up from the outside.  (**Note - the coffee is only free while you wait!  Once you're seated you'll be charged for any coffee consumption!)  They also had a little entryway with two adorable metal benches to wait on.  Super cute place all around, and very cozy. As the final member of our party arrived, I made eye contact with the hostess (who remained very aware of our group the entire time - which I loved), and she motioned for us to follow her.  We had a table in the very back corner of the restaurant, and while it was kind of loud back there I don't think any of us minded. We got started with drinks - I had the prosecco mimosa, Paige had something pink looking, and her friend ordered a bloody mary which she didn't love and switched out for Paige's pink drink.  I think we all agreed our drinks were very strongly poured, which is *never* a bad thing. Food - I ordered the french toast (of course), Paige had the chocolate chip and banana pancakes, and Paige's friend ordered something with eggs, potatoes, fruit, and holy cow it was a lot of food.  I think we were all incredibly happy with our food, though I admit that I wish my french toast had a little bit more flavor to it.  The almond butter helped, but it just seemed like it was missing something.  Still a solid dish, though. Service was great - our server and the busboys were on top of everything, despite how busy it was. By the time we finished eating there was no wait, so we didn't feel rushed to leave and open up the table.  We were able to relax a bit and just chat, which is a lovely way to spend a Saturday brunch.  While we relaxed one of us mentioned just staying all the way through for dinner...  and you know, it's not a bad idea.  The dinner menu intrigues me, and I think I will have to brave the #66 bus again sometime to try it out!",0.9977,0.736,0.211,0.053,0.5941830065359479

The breakfast burrito was a true disappointment.  My bf had the steak sub and I actually liked that one. It's not quite what you expect but it comes with this sauce that's really full of flavor and gives the sub a tex mex flare.  Their home fries disappointing and they skimp out on the portion. The only good thing about brunch today was the chocolate banana pancakes.  The key is that they cook the banana with the batter instead of just layering it on top.  Because the banana is cooked into the pancake, the heat makes the flavor pop out and you're left with this gooey delicious banana flavored pancake that is quite good.  Even my bf who normally hates anything sweet loved the pancake.

It was really like a completely new take on Eggs benedict (I know it wasn't mean to be, but that's what I thought). The fluffiest prettiest poached eggs laid on top of blocks of delicious, fluffy polenta, surrounded with sauteed veggies (squash, mushrooms, peppers), and a delicious green salsa-adobe-sauce thing. It was sooo interesting and everything was beautiful and well seasoned. It was totally not your typical eggs and pancakes and I think it was like $8 or something silly. My friend ordered the most gigantic, delicious plate of Chilaquiles. It was like $10 or something. Perfectly cooked black beans, delicious sauce, fluffy eggs. YUM. (Skip on the Bloody Marias. They are funky and smell like feet. But they let me send it back, so no harm there.) Our server was this awesome Hispanic older man with a thick accent. He was very eager to please. I loved him!

Walking into Flo for the first time in a long time, I felt my breath taken away. Kind of like seeing the same person, but years have passed, and they've broken from their coccoon as a beautiful butterfly! Yeah, it was like that....They've opened up the space a bit since then, but the food has not changed: it's still incredible.  This was the perfect spot for my post-Holiday Bash Hangover Brunch! I do believe they're still serving the Intelligentsia ""Flo Blend"", and it was just what I needed to awaken brain cells that took a Shiner Bock beating the night before. I'm a big fan of New Mexican-style breakfast and was tempted to get the Chilaquiles to see if they were still as good as I remembered. But the Breakfast Burrito was my old fave and did not dissapoint on this visit either! Each layer of egg, sour cream, jalapeno, pico de gallo and spinach tortilla added to the fresh whole. It was filling without seeming heavy. My dining partner opted for the Flo Style eggs and must've liked them, as she saved Flo's a dishwasher cycle by cleaning her plate completely! The homestyle fries are great little potatoes with just the right amount of seasoning. Our waitress was super-attentive without being overbearing.

I also ordered one slice of their 3 berry French toast. The chilaquiles was awesome especially if you like it spicy as the poblano salsa throughout the dish kicks it up a notch.

They're kind of hungover, need their coffee and eggs and want to be seated RIGHT NOW. That's why having a lovely and patient hostess (like the one at Flo this morning) can make all the difference in the world in getting your meal off to a good start. She handled our party upgrade from 2 to 3 without skipping a beat and kept us updated on our status while we waited to be seated.  Food? Off the chain! My 2 scrambled eggs with peppery bacon, home fries and multigrain toast was SO yummy. Just what you want in comfort food. The eggs were a perfect scramble, the multigrain toast was thick and hearty and the bacon was oh-so-scrumptious. The only teensy complaint? The home fries are just okay. They're screaming for some extra flavor of some kind. I was also lucky enough to get a nibble of my friend's polenta hash. Sweet mother of god, I'm ordering this the next time I come in. Huge chunks of veggies, poached eggs and polenta hash? Yes, please!!  Service? Just okay. I believe our waiter came to take our order and drop off the bill. But its fine. My girls and I were having a private dish session about the previous night's activities, so we didn't really care for the interruption, but if you're a stickler for perfect service, Flo might not be your ideal destination.

I ended up choosing the shrimp enchiladas with green chile salsa--I do appreciate the very New Mexican option of choosing your salsa--with sides of corn salad and cheddar jalapeno home fries.  The corn salad was excellent! The perfect blend of cilantro and other spices, nice pieces of tortilla mixed in, and a good ratio of creaminess to vinegar. The home fries sounded a lot better than they were. They were sort of average-diner quality. I don't understand why the jalapenos couldn't have been blended in a more subtle manner. The enchiladas themselves were pretty tasty, but the shrimp were chewey.  Overall, the service was very good. That is definitely an aspect of Flo that has improved over the years. My margaritas were pretty tasty, but the salt was so heavy-handed the first time that the second one I ordered salt free. The server was great about bringing me more coffee after the meal.

I've had two delicious breakfasts at Flo--the chilaquiles about two years ago and one of yesterday's specials, an open-faced tamale with eggs and black beans.  It wasn't complicated--just the tamale, some chicken, and the wonderful, flavorful, spicy sauce which nearly had me licking the plate.  I got the eggs scrambled instead of poached, as they were listed on the menu.  Sooooo good.  I'm still thinking about it today. The hostess was very friendly and beyond cute.  The waiter was curiously uninvolved in our breakfast.  He took our orders and brought the check, but in between he never approached us, despite the fact that he spent most of our meal meandering around the front of the restaurant.  Sure, I could have flagged him easily if we needed something, but isn't checking on your customers a basic rule of waiting?

The food is quite good, the service a bit slow and not always nice.  One time they were very friendly and helpful with my four year old (a very well-behaved restaurant eater) and other times the waitstaff made it very clear they weren't willing to request a plain chicken taco for a kid who shouldn't have been there anyway.  [It's not like we were asking for mac & cheese or a hot dog.  Based on other offerings, they clearly had the makings of a chicken taco.  Fortunately the kitchen or the manager or whoever was more flexible than our waitress, because we got the chicken taco] So good food, mixed to unfriendly service.  I want to like it, I do like it, but probably won't go back anytime soon.",0.7087,0.85,0.09,0.06,0.5096678424456201

For those that don't know, their dinner is great as well...and very cheap considering the quality.  The Jalapeno burger is great, their bowls are awesome.  Their menu changes at least seasonally from what I can tell so you can always count on new fresh dishes.

It is very flavorful and like having a home cooked meal. I've had the Grilled Vegetable Tacos here which were ok. I felt that the tortilla was overpowering the taste of the veggies. From that experience I determined that the Spanish part of the menu may be pretty bland. It is dimly lit in evenings. It is very casual. The service is different each time - sometimes they are very attentive and sometimes they are not. They are for the most part friendly.  They always have specials with entrees and drinks and it seems like they change the menu for the season (check out  eatatflo.com  for more info). Be prepared to spend around $15 - $20 per person which I believe  to be reasonable for Flo. BTW, parking in this area stinks on weekends so I wouldn't try it.

For a caffeine junky, this is extremely helpful when waits are 30+ minutes.  I had the bolsillos and my fiance had the Mexican Corn Cakes. The bolsillos (scrambled egg tacos) were better. It was just about the perfect portion size and a good value for the price. It was a simple dish and executed well. The Mexican Corn Cakes were a special. They were solid but the corn cakes themselves didn't have much flavor. The dish seemed overly complex with a lot of elements (grilled vegetables, poached eggs, the cakes themselves) not necessarily  working together in the presentation or the flavor.

For dinner, I just had their special: grilled tuna tacos.  Three fish tacos on corn tortillas with avocado and creamy sauce, cabbage slaw on the side.  My friend had spinach mushroom enchilada.  We both had mojitos and guacamole to start.   The owner was behind the counter making drinks, chatting with regulars eating at the bar.  This reminds me of the Hilary's in Wicker Park back then.",0.9792,0.807,0.181,0.013,0.3976190476190476

It seems like we go to the same ol' same ol' brunch joint, so he saw some reviews from yelp about this cute little place called Flo. As I walked in I was immediately so glad we found this gem. Who would ever thought that this cute little place was off of Chicago Ave? The place was so nicely put together. The decor was perfect. I thought I was in a B&B in South Carolina.  As we looked at the menus it was so tough for us to pick & choose what we wanted to eat. I decided on the Flo Frittata. It was divine. Filled with red onions, red potatoes, spinach, egg & salsa verde. Served with a side of pico de gallo & black beans. Mike got a very large helping of the chiliquiles. One dish we both decided on, that was just lovely. The chips were a bit too big. They should cut them up a little more.  Coffee was fresh, and hot. The service was nice. I love this place. Everything that was served around us to different tables looked outstanding. I am so going to come back here! Thanks yelp!",0.9935,0.76,0.222,0.018,0.5606717687074829
2007-06-24,4.0,"i should be spanked for living in this neighborhood for this long and *today* was my first time at Flo. Flo made me happy:  it's solid mexican breakfast food (haven't been there for dinner, yet) served with a smile and a really good strong cup of coffee.  i had the chorizo chilaquiles and it reminded me of what i ate living in los angeles (bar none, some of the best mexican food lives there - okay, maybe texas).  folks expecting something resembling 'high cuisine' from chilaquiles need to chill a little bit - it's comfort food traditionally made out of leftovers and the Flo chorizo chilaquiles had flavor, asiago cheese and the requisite soft/crunchy tortilla texture.  my only wish was one more tortilla on the plate to eat with.  (my proof that this was good solid mexican food?  there was a latino family sitting next to us and, from what i could overhear/translate, the mom liked it.  if it's good enough for moms, it's good enough for me!) the portions are hearty (and i'm a hearty kinda girl) and, according to my friend, the smoked hash was excellent.  (she even ate the zuchinni and she hates the stuff!)  the service was fast, polite and even friendly. our wait for seating was 15-20 minutes and once the high brunch hour was past, the flow (heh) inside the restaurant was pretty fast.  i agree with an earlier yelper - get there super early or after 1 pm on weekends if you want to avoid waiting.  i'll try to get here on a weekday to have a more relaxed meal. go to Flo and don't be ashamed if you have to unsnap your pants a little when you're walking out.  oof.",0.9956,0.773,0.211,0.016,0.4868468468468469

At our last visit, when I ordered the Grilled Tuna Tacos, I asked for the tuna to be seared and served rare.  A typical request I would think.  Our waitress tried to tell me that that tuna isn't served like that and if I wanted rare fish I should order the mahi mahi b/c mahi mahi is a tuna.  Mahi mahi is a whitefish, but I didn't argue.",0.9754,0.792,0.187,0.021,0.7326388888888888

Like the space and the staff - friendly, unpretentious, accommodating. The wait was short - probably helped that it was a Saturday.  Free coffee you say? Lies! They most certainly charged us for the imbibed caffeine. The cream dispenser is on the fritz as well. In their defense it was reviewers who mentioned the free coffee, not the restaurant. They do have free dog treats for all you Paris/Nicole Richie wannabes who inappropriately tote your doggies into dining establishments (yes, you are wearing over-sized sunglasses, but you are most definitely not blind). There were some high and low points to the food. I was excited for the chilaquiles, but they were just nachos on a plate and would get their ass kicked by the chilaquiles at Cafe Selmarie. The breakfast burrito was the best I've encountered with a good combination of eggs, bacon, veggies and a wonderfully toasty tortilla. The bacon is the key. The chocolate chip banana pancakes were solid. I can't wait to go back to try the 3 berry french toast or eggs Flo. Or just eat the burrito again. Update: I went back again, this time for dinner, and was every bit as impressed.
