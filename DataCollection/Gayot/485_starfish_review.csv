2008-06-01,4.0,I really enjoyed my lunch here. The sushi was above average and since it was lunchtime...we got the lunch price...wish was awesome! It was something like 40 bucks for two...that NEVER happens at sushi joints. The place is a bit dark...it was a sunny afternoon and I felt like I stepped into a cave for lunch. I read some of the other reviews and it seems as if some people really had a bad experience here....sux-4-u....until I have a similar experience I'll keep coming back.,0.9002,0.779,0.178,0.043,0.42685185185185187

2008-04-08,3.0,"Starfish was fairly decent sushi. The wait staff wasn't particularly attentive, and they did employ underage Mexican boys as sushi chefs (i'm kidding. somewhat). It was interesting, but really nothing spectacular. Try the red dragon - soft shell crab rolled up with spicy tuna on the outside. It was just okay. Mirai is where I'd recommend if you actually want quality sushi/sashimi. The chandelier they had there, made of perhaps 20 regular light bulbs clustered together like salmon roe was the best thing in the place.",0.9528,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.3745421245421245

2008-02-13,1.0,"Sorry.  I have to apologize for the things I'm about to say. I went to Starfish because it's always looked appealing from the outside.  I live 2 blocks away and tonight didn't have any better idea, so figured- sure, give it a shot!  Whoops. ick. ugh. So - starts: we'd like a bottle of sake.  They're having a 'special' tomorrow, so many sakes are unavailable tonight.  Choice available- three of 12 or so.   My friend wants udon.  Great- they have a nebayaki udon on the menu.  I like the bento box -  a great value ($21 for 9 pieces sashimi, 4 nigiri, mixed tempura and salad).  So - we order.  10 Minutes later our waitress returns apologetically- the udon isn't available. They don't have the broth for it.   So, we get miso soup, it arrives smelling like fish, tasting like beef.  Weird recipe. Whatever. My friend decides on a new meal - Shrimp skewers, Toro nigiri from the menu.  No Toro tonight.  Ok, Bluefin.  No Bluefin.  Give us another minute, please. Ok, Tuna please.  Regular Tuna?  yes. An order of shrimp skewers and one Tuna nigiri. Bento box arrives.  Ooh- nice selection!  I pick up what I think is 1 piece of Tuna.  It's two - literally ripped in half- I thought someone already had a bite!  Yellowtail - one piece split, torn.    Salmon nigiri- discolored, almost brown.  The shrimp? Half there - like, well someone took a bite.  The Hirame looks like it was sliced with a spoon.  Tai is two cubes.  Tempura was dripping grease.  The zucchini looked like LATKES! Thick and heavy batter, waay too much.  Salmon sashimi, my favorite, was not cut through and has a 'tail' from being torn. I asked for the manager.  10 minutes later, the second waiter who had been buzzing around comes over, yes?   The fish seems to have cut with a very dull knife, some is discolored, and I'm not interested in eating more than I have (I left 2/3 of my dish - minus some tempura, 4 pieces of fish, and salad).  Ok, I'm sooo sorry, let me see what I can do.  15 minutes passes.  A long time to sit without eating.   I ask to leave, he says 1 moment, I'll bring the check. Check arrives- full price for inedible fish. PLEASE do yourself a favor, go across the street to Izumi.",0.994,0.754,0.183,0.063,0.4578978769768243
2008-02-02,3.0,"As part of our Friday night date night with Mike dining series, we needed another restaurant to go to that we have never been to.  For this selection we though outside of the box and asked a stranger named Jennifer who we met on the Metra train. Jennifer suggested Star Fish, which is about two blocks from our houses. Star Fish it was!  Adding even more excitement to the evening was the addition of my friend's Adam and Julien. The menu was solid.  I would say that their rolls were a bit heavy on the spicy mayo & avocado combinations, but luckily I love spicy mayo and avocado.  The entire table had miso soup, edamame, and green tea to start as we made our sushi selections.  Mike and I shared the White Sox, Rainbow, Totoro Kani, and the Yellowtail & Scallion rolls.  All the rolls were good, but the Totoro Kani was one of the more tasty rolls I have had.  The roll was stuffed with blue crab, avocado, cucumber, and then topped with spicy tuna.  Mike and I also shared a selection of nigiri which included some yummy Super White Tuna. Audrey went with the White Dragon and the Salmon Obsession, which were both well received.  Adam went with the Red Dragon, a boring Philadelphia Roll, and some nigiri, which were all hits.  Finally, Julien had a tuna dish which I'm not clear if it was an appetizer, an entree, or a dessert.  I thought it was an appetizer because the portion was so small. I thought it was a dessert because it came out well after everybody else had already finished their plates.  However, Julien ensured me that the dish was indeed an entree and that he enjoyed it. Hmmmm...  Extra points for the vertical plating of our sushi!  Star Fish created ramps by laying a bamboo mat on top of random sea shells and then placing the sushi on the bamboo ramp.  It added a nice vertical element to our plates that you don't see too often at most sushi joints. The interior was a miss for me.  Do all sushi places need to look and feel the same? The answer is no, but apparently would be suhipreneurs haven't figured this out yet.  The service was great, with the exception of Julien's mystery dish.  All and all a good sushi experience and I will be going back. 5 Miso Soups 1 Edamame 3 Green Teas 8 Rolls 10 Pieces 1 Tuna Entree/Dessert/App --------------------------------------- $175",0.9943,0.824,0.142,0.034,0.4112903225806452
2007-10-23,4.0,"Starfish was a really phenomenal place to go for sushi a couple of years back.  I have been holding off on my review because I wanted to make sure I had a clear impression of how to best represent my experiences.  When I first went to Starfish I had some of the BEST sushi I had ever tasted.  The seafood was extremely fresh, the ingredients were expertly put together and the result was pure heaven.  In my more recent visits I am still very happy with the sushi...but for some reason it is no longer at the level where it used to be in my mind.  I think the sushi chefs may have changed or they have lost a little of the zest they had when they first opened.  Overall, I still think this is a great place to get sushi, but they are charging you as if it were still amazing...which is why I knocked off one star.",0.9218,0.854,0.125,0.021,0.43993055555555555
2007-09-18,4.0,"For almost a year my girlfriend and I have been going to Starfish as it is right down the road from us in the West Loop. One late lunch we got turned away at Sushiwabi and found Starfish a couple of doors down and have been loving it ever since.  We're not sushi purists but certainly are sticklers for fish quality and have tested that taste all up and down the west coast as well as the best sushi restaurants in NY. The fish quality here is impeccable. In particular the Super White Tuna. Any dish with this will be a winner. Again....you gotta like ""the fish""!  Vibe is chill, music is cool but sometimes on the loud side. Service is always sweet and hostpitable so they'd probably turn the music down if you asked.  Only potential downside is that upon one visit the hamahci, or salmon, or whatever, will be AWESOME, and the next will only be slightly above average. I hear they get there fish flown in from Tokyo several days a week so this may just be about the delivery schedule. I'd give it 5 stars but  don't want the place to become overrun.

2007-07-18,2.0,"I will preface this unusually bad two-star rating with the disclaimer that my last visit to Starfish was during Randolph street fest.  HOWEVER, that would also seem to indicate that they should have upped their staff and service to accomodate the traditional crowding that comes with having your restaurant on the same street as a fest. Two friends and I sat at the bar because everything else was crowded.  We watched the air-headed male bartender walk by us many times, flirt with a waitress, twirl a cup, look at his hair in a computer screen, and finally we managed to snag him to get our order.  Our simple order of drinks, a couple miso soups and an easy roll *(hey, we were being considerate of the busy night) never showed up.  We playfully ribbed the bartender and asked why it was taking so long and he had an adult tantrum in our faces.  Then, he proceeded to corral a sweating busboy and yell at him to get us soup.  However long it takes to ladle out soup later (it took the busboy all of five seconds), bartender sloshed down the soup and then ran away again to flirt w/ waitress.  1.5 hours after arrival and still no food or drinks (just soup - and no utensil set ups, either!), we got up, pleasantly complained to the manager, and left.  To her credit, the manager was understanding and polite, which is why Starfish gets two stars instead of none!",0.6238,0.879,0.069,0.053,0.36986461251167135
2007-06-03,3.0,"I should probably preface this review with the fact that I'm not a sushi connoisseur, and I've only had sushi twice before my past trip to Starfish.  My group stopped by Starfish on a Saturday night and were able to get seated right away.  There were a number of empty tables that stayed empty throughout the night.  Our waitress took awhile to greet our table, but I've had worse service (See Hop Haus).  I was happy with the maki that we got.  Nothing made me decide that I had to go back, but they definitely made me decide that I should start eating sushi more often.  My non-raw fish eating friend thoroughly enjoyed the Crunchy Muffy maki (mozzarella over shrimp) and I was a big fan of the Kamikaze (spicy tuna over spicy tuna). I would have given Starfish four stars, but the service could have been better and at one point in the night two people came in trying to sell candy and went around to all the tables without anyone asking them to leave.  Not exactly what I'm looking for when I'm spending $30+ on dinner.",0.967,0.816,0.136,0.048,0.504047619047619

The color and decor of the place was very pleasing to the eye.  The restaurant was conveniently right off the highway and I was able to snatch a free parking spot right away. I'll have to agree that the service was pretty slow. The sake cups were odd (shaped like a square, rather than rounded like a normal cup)  and a very inconvenient to drink out of. The food was tasty, but the portions were very small.  I felt like I paid more for the artistic creation that was presented on my plate. I started off with the calamari and it was lacking flavor.  It seemed like every bite tasted like the oil it was cooked in.  Then I had a roll of the soft shell crab.  That tasted pretty good, and the sliced apples on the side was a good compliment.
