2017-08-24,4.0,"DON'T BE SHELLFISH If you can get past the initial sticker shock, expect quality seafood at this scenic Navy Pier restaurant. On our day downtown to view the legendary Air & Water Show, Nichole C and my parents sought a place to have lunch.  Hungry guests at The Pier certainly have plenty of options: Bubba Gump, Margaritaville, Harry Caray's, DMK Burger Bar, Billy Goat......the list is both long and distinguished (just like my ding dong!) We ultimately settled on this spot with outdoor dining, as it allowed us to look up and see planes soaring high in the sky as we ate.  Once seated, everyone got a drink - a beer, a pina colada, a frozen strawberry daiquiri, and a 'Bermuda Triangle' (malibu coconut with pineapple juice and blue curaçao).  Strong and $9 each. The table ordered a veggie & hummus plate ($12) that came with grilled pita wedges.  I was happy to see that they included jicama in addition to the standard celery and carrots.  Decent plate presentation and the paprika dusting was a nice touch.  Still though, twelve bucks was a lot. Everybody got something different as a main course.  Nichole C enjoyed the cold seafood salad ($19) that featured calamari, shrimp, crab, salmon, and greens with a dijon vinaigrette.  My lovely mother chose the crabcake sandwich ($19) and gave it the thumbs-up.  Dad went with the grilled chx caesar salad ($15) and I opted for the lobster roll ($28). I give Riva MAD props for serving up a dynamite lobster roll.  It's been a long time since I've had a noteworthy one; I appreciate the large pieces of Maine lobster and the toasted garlic bread boat it came in.  The coleslaw on top added some nice crunch to every bite and the fries were surprisingly tasty. Bread = 4.5 Circuses = 4 Our server was actually very good.  Attentive, friendly, didn't hover too much, all great things.  The outdoor seating area - on the south side of Navy Pier - was pleasant and we got lucky with gorgeous weather.  All in all, it was a terrific meal. Honestly, the only real drawback to this place is the significantly elevated cost of dining.  Bear in mind that you're paying to eat 'al fresco' at one of Chicago's most famous landmarks and it'll make much more sense that a seafood sandwich and fries will run you close to $30. While I wouldn't say it's cheap, I will say that it's worth checking out for a cocktail and a quick lunch.  Recommended, yes indeed!",0.9946,0.826,0.152,0.023,0.6436821705426355

That said, the team at the outside café was fairly attentive, up until our lunch was served - then they were simply overwhelmed with the diners who flooded onto the deck as the lunch rush arrived on a recent Saturday. Our four-top started with a large, flavorful hummus appetizer ($12) with fresh zucchini, jicama, celery and perfectly toasted pita rounds - super simple, but a great way to kick off our lunch. The Chicken Chopped Salad ($16) was enormous and came loaded with perfectly cooked dices of chicken breast, soft tears of mozzarella, crisp apple bacon slices, a smattering of sweet corn, carrot slivers and diced tomato, all perfectly dressed in a mustard vinaigrette - this salad was almost enough for two to share. At $24, the Rib Eye Steak Sandwich was a bit thin and certainly on the fatty side, and came to the table somewhat overcooked from the medium-rare we ordered. The seared meat was topped with gooey, melted blue cheese and sliced mushrooms (not in the description) then piled onto an overly large soft ciabatta-style roll.

Upstairs one is more expensive mainly because of the view of Lake Michigan. We decided to get seated upstairs since we're probably never going to come back until 10 years down the road, maybe sooner. There weren't a lot of people both upstairs and downstairs so at first I thought it wasn't that popular. It started getting busy towards dinner time though. Our server was nice and attentive. We got raw oysters as our appetizers and they tasted bomb! I usually don't eat oysters 'cause of its weird taste but this one was exceptional. They are super expensive though! My bf got a whole lobster and I got some fish with risotto. We both enjoyed the lobster, it tasted really fresh! It was bigger than expected as well. As for my entree, I wasn't that pleased about it. The risotto was too hard but the fish was good. There were parts of the fish that tasted bland but the risotto sauce helped with the  flavor.

2017-07-20,4.0,"I am eating my leftover as I write... They were so tasty and filling several hours ago and I am bordering on the sin of gluttony, because I am still full from before, but the enjoyment is just too hard to resist - knowing that I have morsels of the goodness in their cute little containers... Then Nina why the four stars this time? I would take away a half star if I could because, does my waitress have to be warm and fuzzy - no. However, given that there were only a handful of diners at 2:30, I thought she could have been a tad more attentive and at least pretend to be interested, enhancing upon the hospitality of the restaurant; more than what she did. When I arrived and was seated two tables away were other diners. Not that I was eavesdropping, but I could hear that they were out-of-towners, and they were leaving today by train, and that they were from the southeast, and that they were celebrating her birthday. Their waitress, (mine too), was going to offer suggestions for sites to see, but didn't since they were leaving for their home. The information I have is because the waitress asked questions and was lively and engaging - welcoming. With me - my waitress - the same waitress, was pleasant, but asked nothing other than what I wanted to eat, made a dessert suggestion, but pretty much left me alone - I actually intentionally dined alone today, (7/20/17), because I was marking a passage of sorts/an achievement.  The food was still GREAT! The waiters were very quiet and even graceful as they moved about the room cleaning and setting things just right for the dinner crowd... I will definitely return... Everything was still, way better than most places I haunt, but it just would have been nice if there was equal treatment of guest. Be interested in everyone - as a waiter or waitress you represent the embodiment of hospitality for the restaurant. Represent well - for many of us - we choose ""your home"" to partake in our special moments... I even brought a new dress for the occasion - and I hardly ever wear bright colors.

SERVICE: Our server was informative, attentive and cordial. We had a performance to attend after dinner, and the food was paced just right.

Let's face facts, however... with or without the discount, all the restaurants at Navy Pier are pricier than they should be. I rang in 2016 at Riva, following what I am told was a delightful dinner attended by my seafood loving friends. Riva has the best view of the Chicago fireworks, and allowed dinner-goers to attend the small party at no additional fee.

How nice is it to dine overlooking Lake Michigan and the Chicago Skyline? The window seats fill up and get requested pretty quickly for weekends and dinner, so if it may be wise to call ahead and reserve a window seat if that's your thing.  If you come during the week you're good. Came on a Tuesday evening, so not  crowded. The service is good and has been consistent. The food is good, but nothing that specifically stood out to my taste buds and makes me planning my next trip before leaving. I had the Atlantic Salmon. It was grilled with a nice crisp to it, like I prefer it. Nice size proportions, which is always appreciated. It wasn't dry and had flavor, but it did not give me that wow factor and for $30 there are other seafood restaurants that will, like Joe's Stone Crab. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was good, but it's shrimp cocktail, don't they all taste pretty much the same wherever you dine anyhow? I put this restaurant in a ""location"" category.

There was no checking in with us after our food had been served, and my boyfriend's daughter's and my finished plates languished in front of us until they cleared the table when we left.

Yes, they removed the burger from the bill, but they should have comped the burger after the third misfire.

First thing we noticed is it was not as much of a romantic ambiance as we thought it would be. The main dining room had more of a Joe's crab shack type of feel to it.  Luckily we got seated in the back were it was much quieter and slightly more romantic. We got seated right next to the window which was great because it had a very nice view of the lake and skyline.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We ordered a bottle of wine that we never had to touch because he was always there in time to refill our glasses. For food, my girlfriend got snow crab legs which she enjoyed and I got a dish that had two whole lobsters with some pasta in a spicy tomato sauce which was also very good. The food is quite pricey considering its not that upscale of a restaurant.  My only complaint would be the noise. Due to them having a kids menu, there were a lot of families with children. When we made reservations for this place it was for our anniversary and we were under the assumption that this was a more upscale, romantic, grownup type of place.

On today's visit we sat out on the patio and the weather was just very cooperative with us. We decided to try something new, so we went for their fish and chips and a side of their Brussel Sprouts (which to my surprise were super addicting) the batter was really nice not heavy and the fish was Haddock (which does not have a fishy taste) the French fries were made to perfection, the fish and chips platter came with their delicious home made coke slaw, two types of dipping sauces and their tarter sauce had some capers which that is pretty tasty. The cocktail sauce has a unique flavor with a hint of horseradish.  I love Brussel Sprouts and  today I found out how delicious Riva can make them. Yummy yummy in my tummy deliciousness! They are flaky on the top, accompanied by crispy just right pancetta and it was adorned with orange zest! Which is you ask me it was perfection.

2016-01-03,3.0,"This is a review for Riva's New Year Celebration deal that they promoted this year.  We went to Riva to celebrate for their New Year's Eve celebration. Our group of 7 was looking for a place to watch the CHItown rising fireworks on Navy Pier. I had read online that they would be charging $15 at the door for their New Year's eve celebration. The $15 celebration would include some appetizers, a champagne toast, and a DJ. I called the restaurant earlier to confirm and the host advised me to get there before 10pm to ensure that we got in. We arrived around 10:15pm. When we arrived, the bottom floor was pretty empty. We were almost reluctant to pay the $15 as there were so few people there, but decided to wait it out as our other option was to wait outside for the fireworks. I'm docking a half a star because of the host's warning that they would be at capacity before 10pm and the fact that they were not even close to capacity when we arrived. As promised, there was a DJ and appetizers which included some jalapeno poppers, pizza, and mozzarella sticks. Most of the appetizers looked like they had been out for more than a hour or so at the buffet. They weren't appetizing at all - it's almost if they had prepared it as drunk food to be honest. Drinks were separate and average price, with the exception of shots. Docking a 1.5 star for the food because I would expect better from a restaurant that prices at $$$. I know it was only $15 a person, but at least make the food a little bit fresher. Right around 11:50pm, the hosts brought out new year's props for everyone along with a champagne toast. Major kudos to their hosts for being awesome. We all drank the champagne toast as quickly before heading out to Riva's lower floor patio at 11:59 to watch the fireworks. I do have to say that Riva is a FANTASTIC place to watch the new year's eve fireworks. There was hardly anyone at Riva or outside (maybe because it was 19 degrees). You get a clear view of the city and the fireworks on the water and against the city outline. It was gorgeous.

It used small colorful tomatoes versus the large slices. However, it was still flavorful and the cheese was so soft. We both ordered the scallops fettuccine and shared the side of Au gratin potatoes.

Tried to slice a small piece but the dinner knife couldn't do it. The helpful waiter spotted the problem, and gave me a steak knife. The three pieces I ate were like tasteless rubber. I gave up, and just ate the rest of the salad. Everyone else was pleased with their meals, and the service was good. I paid the bill, and gave a 20% tip. On Monday, I got an alert from my Master Card service:  did I really intend to give a 30% tip? So, from Sunday to Monday, Riva kited my tip from 20% to 30%, or from $30 to $45, round numbers! I disputed the charge, of course.  Riva did not respond to the dispute until the very last day they could before the entire charge would be wiped out. Riva conceded that the tip was 20% or $30. Hard for me to believe it was some simple error that caused a lunch check to be increased by $15.  Glad that Master Card spotted the exorbitant tip!  If I had seen that charge on my statement a month later, I might not have spotted it, just recognizing that, oh yeah, that is the Riva charge.

2015-05-19,4.0,"The best place to eat in navy pier, which typically has nothing great to offer food wise. It's the curse of the destination location, which is also why it's impossible to find decent food at the airport. See the restaurants on navy pier (also the san antionio riverwalk, fisherman's wharf, the champs  elysees etc) don't have to be good. There will be thousands of people coming in every minute regardless if the food/service is good or not. Hence why it is impossible to get a good espresso in any airport. The best way to make the most of this is to go upstairs and get a window table, or better yet sit in the bar area by the plate glass windows. This offers a fantastic view which makes up somewhat for the ordinary-ness of the food. This also offers an oasis from the crowds. The sea food is possibly the best thing going on the menu and the oyster selections are particularly fresh.  There is full bar service both upstairs and downstairs although upstairs has slightly better premium offerings, such as grey goose and bookers and more beers on tap as it is considerably larger then the downstairs one.

Since we were a group of 4, we opted for an order of 12 oysters, 6 of each type, so that we can split with 3 each person while maintaining the minimum order. The oysters were refreshing and light and fresh. I liked both equally. We also decided to split the lump crab cake ($14), which was full of crab and not super creamy. Very tasty! For my entree, after a week of gorging on Chicago pizza, I was ready for something on the lighter side. Their seafood chopped salad ($18) fit the bill.

When the bright spot of a meal is the nice bread in the breadbasket, something is wrong. The chef's special soup, Crab-shrimp gumbo, served lukewarm, was misnamed-should have been called chopped celery veggie soup which was not even a distant relative in the gumbo family. The calamari was greasy-the Caesar salads hardly touched, were doused with a tasteless cream dressing that was a far cry from Riva's former classic Caesar. Maybe with a captive audience of tourists, this place will work ok but Chicago is a food city with so many fabulous places to eat that sadly, Riva won't be seeing these Chicagoans again.",0.3437,0.831,0.094,0.075,0.5835213032581453
2014-11-05,4.0,"A friend had her wedding rehearsal dinner here and everything was really nice. Decor: This is a pretty fancy place given its location on Navy Pier (which is known for tourist-trap type spots). It is, as one would expect, a nautical/sea theme but it is not over-the-top. Another HUGE plus is that it does not smell like a seafood restaurant (as some places tend to smell fishy...). We were in a back room, all to ourselves, and there was plenty of room for all. Bathroom: We had our own (it came w/ the room) but there was also one up near the entrance. I visited both and both were clean, inviting, and well-lit. Staff: All the waiters and staff were friendly and more than willing to get you anything that you could ask. They also moved very quickly/efficiently in all tasks they performed. Food/Drink: It was a pre-fixe menu but everything was delicious! I had a salmon steak and it was perfectly cooked and HUGE. The other items, chicken and beef rib, also looked/smelled wonderful. Everything tasted fresh and was prepared wonderfully. We also had our own mini-bar, complete with our own bartender. It was awesome. Value: Not knowing how much the meal cost it is difficult to comment on value. However, this place is upscale so I imagine it is not cheap. But, judging by our meal, I will venture to say that you get what you pay for here (and probably a little bit more!) This is a really good seafood restaurant and would be a great place to go or another meal.

The only reason this review is even worth 1 star is because our server was very friendly.  Our appetizers were fine. The oysters were tasty, the tuna sashimi was very good, but our calamari was very over cooked. For my entree I ordered the NY Strip. At $54 I expect it to be cooked to the temperature I ordered. I asked for mind medium rare. The first try came out over cooked it was somewhere between medium and medium well. I sent it back and my second steak came out raw. This is unacceptable for the prices. As someone who has spent over a decade running restaurants from both the front and back of house, when you take a temperature for a steak you need to temp them and make sure you serve a good product, especially at those prices. On top of the poor quality of steak, when I asked to speak to the manager about it, he seemed almost condescending about it. Most of the people at the table agreed. This is not how you should treat someone when you're establishment made a mistake twice on the same persons meal.  They redeemed themselves be bringing some desserts which were tasty, but I went without a dinner because they couldn't cook a steak properly.

From the moment we entered to the very minute we left, we were treated with utter disrespect.  We had made reservations for 6 people and a baby.  I called on two separate occasions to verify and confirm our reservation.  Each time greeted with such friendly staff.  I had previously been there with a friend for lunch and thought my mother and family would absolutely love to celebrate our lovely mothers there.  Unfortunately that was not the case, in fact it was the exact opposite! Upon our arrival, there was a bit of confusion about how many we had in our party and where to seat us.  We had 5 adults, one toddler and a baby in our party.  A table of 6 was too small because we needed a high chair. When we told our waiter Antonio, he became upset and told us that wasn't his decision to make and the bigger table wasn't available for such a small party and walked away.  He never once greeted us, he simply walked away and sent the manager.  The manager was so gracious, so nice, he tried to seat us at a different table but ended up giving us a table for 8.  In reality, it was the perfect size for our party of 7.  It took Antonio about 10 minutes to arrive to our table.  He never said hello, not even to my mother or sister-in-law who we were celebrating on this special day! He simply said, ""This isn't a party of 7, there are only 5 adults at this big table!"" What he lacked was common courtesy.  His partner Michelle was no better. She and Antonio did not treat us with the respect PAYING customers deserve.  Instead they stood in a corner, pointed at out table and snickered.  What they failed to realize is that my mother was behind them when they began to talk about our table.  It was such a humiliating moment that my mother became upset.  Can you imagine how that made me feel? I came from out of town to visit my family, to take them out to this beautiful place only to be treated with such blatant disrespect! Antonio and Michelle were rude, disrespectful and not helpful AT ALL.  The only person that would come to our table to make sure we were ok was Pedro; the bus boy! I saw how Antonio greeted the other tables or how Michelle would ask others if they needed anything, but never to our table.  We felt as if we were on an island! Our table was cleared and we sat for over 15 minutes without anyone ever coming to  to ask if we wanted anything else like coffee.  Instead, I had to ask Pedro for our bill.  He asked Michelle who then told Antonio and both walked away.  It then took Michelle an extra 10 minutes to ask what we were doing.  Not if we were ok or if we wanted anything else. She brought the bill and walked away.  She never thanked us or made a welcoming comment.  Antonio and Michelle were extremely rude.  My mother didn't enjoy the brunch nor did she eat much.  She was upset that her day was ruined by two inappropriate staff.  The brunch, itself was delicious.  I wish she would have enjoyed it.  When the bill came, we paid and left the tip in the black card holder.  Antonio practically knocked my brother over to come around the table to pick it up, look at how much we had tipped him and walked away.  Again, neither wait staff thanked us for coming or even said good bye.  I wish we could of given the ENTIRE tip to Pedro.  And if there was a way to request that I would say yes.  If it were up to me, I would of given the tip to Pedro myself and left nothing to Michelle or Antonio.  The service was bad enough to ruin a gathering that seldom occurs. When I went last month, the service was next to perfect.  I had a toddler with me and the gentleman that waited on us knew exactly how to handle our table, he was efficient more than polite and so incredibly welcoming.  Antonio and Michelle did not deserve the tip, we deserved better than that! We were paying customers and expected to be treated with a lot more respect.   Wait staff MUST be held at a higher standard.  I'm jut sorry I left a tip for two unprofessional people!",0.9956,0.76,0.154,0.086,0.5147596691258663

Because I am pretentious too and I want every one to know that I was here.  LOL  But seriously the place is way to over priced for the quality of food that you get.  Plus I am just getting too old to be dealing with the hassle of finding parking and then walking forever to get to your destination and in this case a pretty mediocre one. Especially in the cold of winter, no thank you. Parking that you have to pay for of course too, let's not forget that.   We had the Filet Mignon Skewers....OMG!  Disgusting!!  I don't eat that much meat but the day I did..... I wasted it on this garbage.  Way too salty and the meat was like chewing on rubber gum.  We were here 2 days ago, and I sware I'm still chewing on the same piece of meat.   We then had the grilled white shrimp.....Disturbing!!  I think the only spice that the Chef has in his kitchen here is salt because that is all you can taste in this entree... had some sort of red garnish and sauce that came with it that was just pure salt.  The Filet Mignon was tooooo salty too.  We also had the Florida stone crab claws, ok this was a little better but then I almost chocked to death on the tiny fragile shell that seemed to be present in every bite of actual crab meat that I would take. We also had the coconut shrimp which wasn't bad, however, they totally lost me with the sauce that they brought out with it.  It just didn't match. The Coconut shrimp and sauce at Red Lobster is better.    And lastly we had the Crab Cake which was actually pretty good. They mislead you with their online advertisements that you need reservations and that there is a dress code. Give me a break.  That is just said to trick you into believing that you are going some where nicer than what it actually is.  There were plenty of open tables and several people dressed in jeans and not even nice jeans.So if there is a dress code it isn't a very strict one.  Wish I would had known ahead of time because the walk from the car to the resturant would had been easier in flats than heels. You get a somewhat nice view of the city, but let's face it, This is Chicago, there are places with better views.  Other than just going for the sake of saying that you were here, I really don't see any reason for going. Too expensive and the entrees are just too hit or miss.  May be the place for you however if you like meat gum.  I wish there were half stars because this place is 2 and a half stars and not 3,",0.9641,0.82,0.106,0.074,0.4891919191919193

Second, the food was not at all what I expected of a restaurant of this caliber.  The black mussels in garlic sauce had several rotten and skunky mussels.  The calamari breading was soggy.  The Zuppa di pesce was almost too salty to eat and the seafood was of a very poor quality.  The lobster diavolo was indeed too salty to eat and barely had any lobster.  Third, it was a warm evening but it was hotter inside the restaurant.  I expected better of a $200 meal.",-0.3174,0.902,0.033,0.065,0.42695767195767204
2012-09-03,1.0,"Be known this review is for the bar only! On labor day weekend my wife and I went to the pier for the Cirque show which was awesome. We decided afterwards to stop at Riva for a frozen drink on a hot day. So they have an outside bar that the menu serves these drinks but the bartender said sorry I can't serve any frozen drinks or mojitos. So basically just beer? He said go inside and get it there, so we did. After about 10 minutes the bartender finally took our order. 2 pina coladas $16.61! I couldn't believe a nice place like this was serving Barton rum in there drinks I can buy 2 bottles of that for that price but oh well. So we went on our way, we walked to the end of the pier and decided we would stop and get another. So I decided to read the drink menu this time and it said the Colada's and Daquiri's were made from fresh fruit and BACARDI rum. So when I ordered I asked can I have 2 mango daquiri's with the BACARDI that is advertised it the menu. He said sure I gotcha! Then he proceeds to pour Barton rum and boxed fruit (NOT FRESH AS ADVERTISED), and I said HEY is that Bacardi? Oh sorry I forgot. So he grabs the Bacardi from opposite side of the bar of the daquiri machines. hmmmmm so I asked him why he makes the drinks with Barton when BACARDI is advertised in the menu. He said oh the Bacardi is more money I said B.S. you charged me the same price last time 15 minutes ago. He said oh the menu is wrong it has to be changed. YEAH WHATEVER! Just admit you are ripping people off and you just have probably never been called out on it. They make like 5000% profit on drinks as it is at least give people what you advertise. So If they rip people off on drinks I'm sure the food is the same and I'm sure they water down there other liquor as well. I have eaten here years ago and but obviously wasn't memorable because I haven't come back till this weekend.

I was in Chicago for work, and a big group of us ended up at Navy Pier late, really hungry and a little drunk. All the other places to eat that we tried had ridiculous waits for a table. This place seated us right away outside so we could watch the fireworks. It was a bit pricey for what kind of food and the amount that you get, but hey, that's just how it is on Navy Pier. I ordered a steak sandwich, which was above average. The server asked me how I wanted it done--which I didn't expect, but was glad that she did. Also, it came with provolone or something on it, and I noticed they had another menu item with blue cheese, so I asked if they could substitute the blue cheese for the provolone, which she accommodated. The sandwich was actually really good! It came with fries, which were better than average. Other folks at the table all thought the food was pretty good. They had the crab cake, a couple of burgers, and a fish and chips. I asked the person who got the fish and chips if it was too greasy, and she said no, it was just right. In my opinion, fish and chips is something that a lot restaurants mess up with it being too greasy and soggy.  Our bill ended up being around $180 for 8 people, but not everyone was drinking. I didn't think that was unreasonable. Although, with so many other great places to eat in Chicago, I probably wouldn't go back.

My main course was the Double Cut Pork Chop with Okinawa sweet potatoes, leeks, charred tomatillos, apple gastrique.  The potatoes were delicious as were the tomatillos.  The pork chop I asked for medium and was kind of dry, especially if it was a double cut.  I had it with a Beringer Merlot which hit the spot.  Since it was a Thursday evening, it was pretty quiet.  There was an adjacent table with 8 people or so but they cleared out and then the patio was pretty quiet.  That's fine, but what annoyed me was that they were literally clearing and stacking the empty tables around me as I was still eating.  I just didn't feel welcomed that I scarfed the rest of my meal.  By the time the waitress noticed I was done, she asked if I wanted dessert.  Really? You're working hard to stack all the empty furniture around me.  It looked like they were closing (it was 7:45 in the evening).  I had no desire to stay if they were in such a rush to clear out the area.  I just felt service was lacking.  I wasn't greeted promptly and then I felt like a criminal as they were trying to usher me out yet they asked if I wanted dessert.  Wine was good, oysters were good and sides to my entree were good.  Pork chop was a little dry and the Lobster Corn Bisque left a bit to be desired for me.  Decent meal, but expensive to be treated like I did with the service.",0.9831,0.814,0.119,0.066,0.5216450216450218

The service side of Riva was odd and pretty much irked us from the start.  They just didn't have their act together.  We check in with the host and confirm our reservation, only to be pressed by the seater that arrives with menus bluntly asking us for our reservation.  Um, do you want to check with that coworker standing next to you that's not a paying customer?  I don't think we ever really figured out who our server was as it seemed different people kept dropping in helping with our table.  When the bottle of wine my wife had ordered arrives, I about hit the roof when the guy called out to my wife to try the wine.  Not like ""Would the lady like to try the wine?"", but rather rudely ""Lady, you wanna try the wine?""  Depends, will you be pouring it in a plastic cup?  That could be the snob in me.  Seriously though, if Riva is going to charge these kind of prices, they need to step it up on the service end of operations.  I felt like I was at a wedding reception or dinner event rather than a romantic dinner with a view.  Service was therefore a 2.   Eh, Navy Pier.  At least I've got great seats for Shakespeare.",0.99,0.824,0.137,0.039,0.5482726423902894

None of us had ever been there before and probably won't be back any time soon. It's one of those places you would take out-of-town guests because it's right on the pier and it has lovely scenery. However, the food doesn't match the restaurant.  Let's start with the food. We each ordered a soup, either the New England clam chowder or the lobster bisque. I had the clam chowder which was chock full of clams, potatoes, celery, etc. However it was way too salty. My stepdad said the lobster bisque was way too salty. We also ordered the crab and artichoke dip and crab cake appetizer. I can't eat shellfish so I didn't have any but I asked my sister how the dip was and she said it was only ok.  For our entrees, I ordered the lunch special sirloin with Brussels sprouts, fingerling potatoes, and a demi-glace sauce. I always order my steak medium rare. It came out medium well in the middle and well done everywhere else. The outside was charred black and tough. I didn't finish it but ate all the sprouts. My grandma had better luck with her medium rare steak and it's good that she did since she has dentures and wouldn't have been able to chew my steak. My stepdad had the jumbo crab cake entree, my mom had the colossal shrimp, and my sister had the Salad Louis(?) which was crab salad over a bed of lettuce. My mom said her shrimp was salty and my stepdad said the shrimp was way overcooked since it was very tough to chew. My sister liked her salad.  After all this we actually ordered dessert (my mom's company was paying, so why not?). We ordered tiramisu and it came out looking like a work of art. Not bad. Service was good and very attentive.

Main course:  I had lobster diavolo, it's a lobster split in two over a lobster pasta with tomato sauce.  This was very good due to the lobster.  Too much pasta though.  I left half of it and fished out lobster, no bad pun intended.  You've gotta feed the hungry tourists though, right?;) Service was okay.  Forks at this place don't make sense.

The radish and leek garnish was interesting but not enough to offset the spring roll.  For dinner we had steak. Usually a classic error at a well known and well situated seafood restaurant. I was surprised as my rib-eye required no addition garnishments. It was well marbled and tasty and perfectly grilled. There was a little to much edge fat for my tastes, but once cut away the rest was marvelous. My wife's petite fillet was equally as good and a backed potato that was made for, and priced for two.

2011-05-12,3.0,"Navy Pier. Just saying it sends visions into my head of tourists, tourists and more tourists. After all- the only time any Chicagoan goes to the place, is when out of town guests arrive and that is the first thing they want to see. So going there specifically to eat at a restaurant really didn't occur to me until a friend told me he had a Groupon for Riva.  I was actually pleasantly surprised.  The Pier, on this cool May night, was not too crowded, unlike the throngs of people who hang out there on the balmy Summer nights.   There were girls in their prom dresses walking the promenade, tourists taking the obligatory pictures and asking for directions, and just the right amount of people to make it seem active but not overwhelming.  If you drive- you can park in any of the many garages or know that Riva has valet parking ($12) with the entrance located on the north side of the pier about half way back.  It's important to know that Riva has two levels. The first level is a casual bar level with the finer dining restaurant upstairs. We went upstairs and since our reservation for a table by the window was not ready- we sat at the spacious bar to gab a martini and some oysters before dinner.  Service was slow. We had to flag the bartender down for everything (more water, to order food, another drink). Too bad as the oysters were quite good and the martini perfectly shaken.  When the host came to get us to tell us our table was ready- we were seated at the perfect table, nestled in the corner with a beautiful view of the lake. Here again- the food was quite good- our caprese salad was delicious and fresh and my Grouper and friend's lobster were perfectly executed.  The problem? The service. Really slow. And when I ordered a new drink, it took forever to come and when it did- it was improperly prepared. Too bad as this should have been a 4 star review. But the service took it down a level. . . .surprising for a Phil Stefani restaurant.  Our bill for two for a shared salad and a couple of entrees and drinks was reasonable, about $100. Our evening? Still delightful even with the slow service as we were celebrating and nothing was going to get in the way of that!",0.9945,0.795,0.161,0.044,0.6162532662532663

You might ask, it's a restaurant and you liked the food... what more do you want? Well, first off. I'd like to make a reservation and have them actually honor it. Or, they can just tell me nothing is available.. I don't mind sitting at the bar, but being left with no option and given an ""it's not our fault if you don't have a res"" attitude is messed up. If you ask for my name and number then you can at least actually place the reservation, instead of typing in on your invisible typewriter. On to the meal: The prices are sky-high. I don't necessarily have a problem with this, as long as the value matches the price tag. In this case it did not. Everything was tasty, but it didn't wow me. Too many options in Chicago that are awesome to waste top dollar on just above-average food. The view is a saving grace for this place. I guess that's what you pay for? Although, it is also ridiculously out of the way.

When entree came i swear that the crab legs were on fire, almost burning my finger tips off. They were meaty but some of the legs seemed overdone.

2011-05-06,3.0,"Needed to use my Groupon for Riva before it expired. Made a Friday afternoon reservation for my wife, 3 year son and myself . The place was very slow with not many customer's. Sat upstairs in the dinning room. We where nicely seated by the window which affords a great view of the lake and pier.  First off, the wine list leaves a lot to be desired. Seems they only had two wines available as bottles which needless to say were very over priced. They had a fair sized listing of whites and reds available by the glass but they were pricey given the size serving they provided as my wife found out when her Pinot Grigio showed up. Is it asking too much to ask to have at least a few reasonable priced bottles. I don't mind a moderate mark up on wine by the glass, I'll usually order a bottle of reasonably priced wine for my wife and I to share but that was not a option at Riva.  The food, like previous times having eaten at Riva, was again consistent and good. My sons child plate of chicken tenders was whole chicken and eaten by my son which is proof enough that it's good. Nice to see them have a few children favorite options. I enjoyed the appetizer special of fried smelts which given that it's smelt fishing season here in Lake Michigan was appreciated as an offering and it arrived nicely done, lightly floured and fried leaving you the opportunity to enjoy that these little fellows are fish. I hate when they are over coated and too deeply fried, masking them and cheating you of enjoying what they are..fish. The Calamari for me is some of the best in the city.The dish was made up of big pieces of fresh squid not overly fried or crispy at all, leaving the squid to be enjoyed as what it is and not mere fried batter, leaving one with a taste that the item served could just as well have been chicken or something else. My wife enjoyed her grilled Whitefish served over a bed of spinach and potatoes. Likewise I enjoyed my Seafood Chop Salad. For the $15 price it had ample seafood of crab meat, shrimp, calamari, and salmon. I would order it again but next time I would insist that the dressing (mostly a oil vinaigrette) would be on the side, as the dish had a couple of spots which the dressing seem to heavily applied. We finished off each with a cappuccino and all 3 of us shared the assorted gelato which truly was adequate in size to be shared and reasonably priced for it's quality  ($8).  Why only 3 stars despite being pleased with the food? Although it didn't bother us as we were in no rush to leave, enjoying the vista that the place provided, I have to say that unlike other times I have been at Riva's, today the service was spotty at best. Although the staff was pleasant enough, given the place was not busy at all there was no excuse for lapses of judgment (ie. pouring a refill of ice tea in my water glass, clearing our table and offering us desert despite not having received our main entries yet, etc). Again we took it with stride and it didn't adversely effect our enjoyment of ourselves but I think others may and I am obligated to share this in my review.  Other things to keep in mind: It was a plus to be given at the end of our meal a promotional card for $20 toward a next visit at any Phil Stefani restaurant (card expires in one month). It was a minus that they don't validate or discount self parking in the Navy Pier garage. In the end if one is to drive and self park, it's important to factor that in to the cost of the day as we were hit for $24 on this Friday.  I had a Groupon that motivated me to return this time at Riva. I like the place and it's food is good, but generally I would not make the trip to the Pier for just the sake of dining here.  In short a great place to eat when at the pier, but many better choices available in the city then Riva.",0.9991,0.789,0.183,0.028,0.5442535392535391

I made a reservation online for a Saturday night and took my buddy for his 31st birthday. We had an excellent table right next to the window and two very attentive servers. The wine list was pretty decent although I would have liked more variety in the Alternates sections - Riesling is a great wine with seafood but they only have two US Rieslings which are nowhere near as good a German Rieslings. I ended up ordering the Rosemount Estate Australian Chardonnay which was very good.  For our meal we started with a Calamari appetizer and for the entree I had 1 lb of Alaskan King Crab Legs with the Twice Baked Yukons and my buddy had the Salmon special. Shellfish is my favorite food and my dining companion is from the East Coast so we both have high expectations for seafood and Riva met those expectations - they had the best quality that you can get outside of a coastal area.

They serve this delicious bread on your table that is nice and hardy. I liked it a lot and it was a good way to warm up the taste buds before our meals came.

2011-04-23,3.0,"I went to Riva with my husband for dinner this evening.  We have been to the restaurant in the past and like some of the menu changes (e.g. small plates) that they have made.  Overall I give Riva a 3 star rating with some aspects better than others. Food - We started our meal with the duck confit spring roll.  The price ($12) seemed a little high for only one spring roll, however we still decided to give it a try since we are huge duck fans.  The spring roll came with a dikon slaw which was nice and crisp.  The roll itself had mint mixed in with the duck.  The mint was a little overpowering, taking away from some of the duck taste.   For entrees I had the red bass and my husband had the crab cakes.  The presentation of both plates were nice.  As far as taste, the crab cakes were okay.  Not the best that we have ever had, but not the worst either.  There were large pieces of crab meat in the cake and the cake itself held up well.  The sides were average as well.  The taste of the red bass was nice and with some of the complexities of the fish being accented by the thyme butter sauce.  The lobster risotto was okay, there was one piece of lobster (which was wonderful), but the lobster flavor did not come through completely in the dish.  The English peas and tomatoes in the dish were very fresh and had wonderful flavor. However there were a few technical errors with the fish.  The first is that there were a couple of pin bones still left in the fillet.  Also, the skin was not crisped up so it was inedible.  Overall I give the food 2.5 stars. Wine - The wine list was a good size and there were several different options and price points available.  We ordered the Gewürztraminer which was a nice complement to our meals.  The only complaint that we had was the heavy focus on napa and sonoma wines. Overall I give the wine 3 stars Service - Service was a little touch and go.  When he was around he was attentive, however he did disappear at times.  For example, after receiving our check we still had wine left in our bottle.  It took our server so long to return that we considered pouring the last bit ourselves. Overall I give service 2.5 stars. I would recommend this restaurant to couples as well as families (there were several children there).  With it being on the pier it is not stuff and as long as you are dressed neat you will fit in.  However, I wouldn't recommend it if you are making an out of the way trip or for special occasions (aside for their brunches which are wonderful and are in the 3.5-4 star range).

If you are local or a more adventurous visitor, please browse around Yelp for any number of chef-driven seafood restaurants or steakhouses. You will do much better for the price -- even at another Phil Stefani joint. Our appetizers of lobster bisque and artichoke puff pastries were not good. The pastries seemed microwaved (price check: $10 for three bite-sized supermarket hors d'ouevres). Entrees of fish filets served over typical vegetable accompaniments were well put-together, though worth $20 and not about $30 each. Dessert, a dish of three kinds of chocolate, was good -- though the ganache torte was obviously fresh from the freezer.

2011-04-21,4.0,"Too many Chicago folks avoid Navy Pier. I think most feel it's a tourist trap with mediocre attractions and chain restaurants. I know many locals who have never been to the observation deck at Sears, Navy Pier, Wrigley Field, the Art Institute, etc. When I think about it - it seems strange. I think we may be missing out.   If crowds are not your thing go off peak hours or off season. Riva is definitely worth a visit among other things Navy Pier has to offer. It probably wouldn't have popped into my head as an option but I had a Groupon. Another reason to like Groupon = it gets me out of my routine and has me trying restaurants I may have never been to otherwise.  The atmosphere in Riva is what you would expect from a seafood house; white linen table cloths, nautical touches, dark wood.... If you can -- grab a seat at the window because the views are stellar and ever changing. On our night at Riva a storm was raging so we couldn't see the city but the big sail boats docked at the pier were pitching and rocking fiercely with the waves -  paired with the sideways rain and lightening the view was just as dramatic and entertaining.  The service was attentive and gracious. We ordered a Malbec - which wasn't my cup of tea. I usually love Malbec. The waiter took it back no problem and we settled on a Cab. Water glasses were full, table was kept clean, pacing was nice.  They had a large specials menu which included several options for small plates/tapas. We opted to go that route so we could try different things. I prefer this option most anywhere as opposed to one big piece of fish.  Our selections were deeeeelish! The only disappointment was that they had run out of the short rib potstickers. Standouts were the savory, sweet and tender stuffed piquillo peppers with duck confit and crisp prosciutto. The light and airy artichoke beignets with boursin cheese were heavenly. We also had a crab salad which was bursting with flavor and very fresh and some sashimi (tuna) which was SUPER fresh and cut very well - excellent texture and flavor.  So I was very surprised how much I enjoyed Riva - probably because I subconsciously share aforementioned assumption. This experienced proved the assumption wrong and I will definitely be back!

It screams trying too hard. Luckily, the food was at least average.  New England Clam Chowder ($7) -- Yummy! Thick, chunky, and plenty of clams. Jumbo Lump Crab Cake ($16) -- Average. Trader Joe's does a better job. Coconut Shrimp ($13) -- Flavorless. Large Filet Mignon 10 oz. ($39) -- Quite tasty. Cooked a perfect medium-rare. Whipped Potatoes ($5) -- Chunky with lots of red potato skin flakes.  Our server was fake and slimy. Sort of like a used car salesman. It was uncomfortable to say the least. Service was extremely slow even though he only had 3 other tables. Water went unfilled frequently. He knew we had a Groupon. I feel our service was compromised because of this.  My husband and I ordered two sides of whipped potatoes. Each order ended up being large enough for 2-3 people. This was really ridiculous. Our server could have easily warned us ahead of time about the serving sizes of their side dishes. I feel it was a ploy to get us to spend more to raise his tip percentage. Slimy. I didn't have a good feeling walking out of here, and I still don't. Although the view is great, it's just not worth the money. If you're craving good seafood, go to Joe's Stone Crab. If you want the nice view, grab a drink at the Signature Lounge afterward. Just steer clear of this place.",0.9209,0.783,0.119,0.098,0.551079067990833

I took my girlfriend there for Valentine's day, and although the service was fine our food was not. My girlfriend ordered a filet and lobster and before she was even finished eating it she felt ill. Rather than make a big deal I paid for the check and we left. Before I could even pick up my car from the valet outside she went to the bathroom and threw up. Pretty dissapointing to know I spent about $240 on our meal including tip and half of it ended up in the toilet.

2011-02-16,2.0,My boyfriend and I dined here on Valentines Day. (We've been here before and had a great experience.) We ordered the Coconut Shrimp appetizer - delicious but not sure if it was potatoes or what at the bottom of the sauce  - tasted kind of funky - I had the petite filet and lobster tail for my main meal. Before they could even take my plate away I began to feel sick. We left without dessert - I was sick the rest of the evening. I am sure it was from the lobster. I emailed Riva from their website Tuesday morning informing them I fell ill after dinner. I wanted to make them aware in case anyone else reported the same problem. I received an autoresponse email back saying someone would contact me within 24 hours. Never heard from them. I am disappointed in the lack of customer care considering the amount we spent for a dinner that was just so so and I couldnt even keep it down. Unfortunately we will not be dining at Riva anymore - There are many more steak/seafood choices in Chicago.,-0.9752,0.786,0.046,0.168,0.5783834586466166

The waiter was very attentive and explained the menu very well. I had the petit filet and lobster tail and my bf had the new york strip butterflied as he likes his well down (for shame, lol) Also had the coconut shrimp appetizer which was 2 jumbo prawns on top of a peanut buttery sauce...the shrimp was good, the sauce sort of didn't compliment the cocunut right.  Just my opinion. But my petit filet was perfect and my lobster was good. This was my first time eating lobster so I have nothing to base this one, but it was very attractive when it arrived at my table and the taste was nice.   It was definitely more than I could eat.

We were seated right away in a nice booth overlooking the pier, but I don't think there's a bad seat in this place.  The view was nice and the fireworks later on were cool, I sort of wish they would have left the lights dimmed for the entire meal, not just during the fireworks. The service was very bizarre.  One guy came and got us water and told us about the wine bottles on the back of the menu and then left.  So we assumed he was a busboy of sorts.  He stood off to the side looking not busy and after awhile, he came by and asked if he could get us drinks.  My husband said, that busboy is really on top of things to notice we don't have drinks yet... Oh, irony. Little did we know that he was actually our server.  So no introduction, no mention of specials and after drinks it took him 25 minutes to take our order.  Fearing we might never see him again, we ordered everything all at once, something we rarely do so we can space the meal out and enjoy ourselves. We got the crabcake appetizer and it was great, by far the best thing we ate that night.  I got lobster bisque and husband got the wedge salad.  He said it was good but ""it's pretty hard to mess up wedge salad.""  My bisque tasted good but was a little on the thin side with no pieces of lobster, bummer. Onto dinner, husband got the filet and I got chilean sea bass, my absolute favorite.  It was grilled but the first bite I noticed it was completely doused in butter and was so crispy it tasted fried.  About 1/3 of the way into the fish I wasn't able to flake it with my fork and had to get my butter knife and saw through it.  Needless to say, I didn't finish that and was full so I didn't bother the server but he didn't mention why I had 2/3 of my fish left on my plate either. Since our server didn't introduce himself and was hard to understand as it was, we figured he didn't know about the anniversary/birthday thing and we had planned to go elsewhere for dessert anyways.  He asked if we wanted anything and we just asked for the check, which he brought back with complimentary tiramisu.  That was actually really good too but just odd because there was no other mention of it.

It is exactly what you would expect from a tourist trap - severely overpriced food, less than mediocre service, and completely underwhelming in flavor and taste.  We started off with the duck spring rolls which were under seasoned and served with an overly bitter citrus sauce. Also the portion was quite small for $12. The lobster bisque was decent in flavor but lacked the velvety texture that is unique to a great bisque. The crab cake we ordered was also an extremely small portion for the price and was nothing above average. The swordfish my hubby ordered was dry and under seasoned. Overall food was mediocre. Service was a little casual for the price and definitely inattentive. Server seemed uninterested and was slow to check in on drinks and such.

No problem we went to the bar. 45 min. and a couple drinks later, they had a table by the window and we were hungry.

When I asked the waiter he said the only way to go was the 24oz Australian (although I din't have a scale in my pocket) market price $59.95. Ok Give me the grilled vegies on the side.  Now I've had lobster, Australian and otherwise many times and I never before experienced a mushy tail like the one they served to me. After they served us no one available anywhere on the floor.

The upstairs has the wall to floor window that looks out on the lake to the east and the beautiful skyline to the west.  I was part of a party of 6 that came early for our reservation. They set everything up for us and had us in our seats within 5 minutes. Upon sitting we were immediately served water and a bread basket that had the most awesome crispy cracker topped with Parmesan cheese and herbs.  Since I overindulged over the weekend, I chose to stick with sparkling water but I tried some of the wine my bf ordered and it was very good.  Still feeling overly bloated and hungover, I skipped appetizers and instead nibbled on what others ordered. The diver scallops were phenomenal! Crispy outside, delicious texture. Only gripe, the oyster mushrooms were super bland. No sauce, no salt, just boiled oyster mushrooms.  The lobster bisque was also good but could've been better with actual pieces of lobster. For my entree, I opted for just the prime ribeye steak with red skin mashed potatoes and asparagus. Actually 3 of us choose the prime ribeye: 2 medium rare, one medium. Only real mishape of the night-our server couldn't tell which one was the medium steak. Only after I bite into my steak did I realize she gave grandpa's medium steak. It's ok though, the steak was still pretty juicy and the au jus was very good. I loved the complex bite of the meaty steak, smooth potato and crunchy asparagus! umm..salivating RIGHT NOW thinking about it.  Everyone else loved their entrees also. Tiny little 4'9 grandma ate almost her whole plate of dover, the atlantic salmon and petite filet also went over very well.  For dessert, the tiramisu called to me...mostly because we wanted to stay a little longer to watch the fireworks. I've definitely had better tiramisu, and they were both slightly melted when it got to our table.  The key lime pie and blueberry shooter was apparently super delicious though I thought the pie was a little too tart. They had another dessert called chocolate fantasia on the menu that I thought might put me in a sugar coma if I tried it, even though it did sound delicious.  p.s. if you're going to visit try to go around 8ish on the weekend so you can also see the fireworks over the lake.

But honestly, Riva is not like I remember it from ""back in the day."" Long ago, I was wined and dined there on a handful of dates and each of those experiences was much more 4-5 star rated.  Of course the views remain gorgeous, and if you've never been it's worth a visit for appetizers, light lunch or dessert, especially if you're not in a hurry. The service was -- well -- interesting.  We had 2 servers; kind of odd, really with just 5 of us at the table.  But both servers were friendly, gracious, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Unfortunately we waited an inordinate amount of time for each course, drinks, appetizer, entree, and then dessert.  The place wasn't very busy, so the long wait didn't seem justified. The food was only ok.  We started with a half dozen $1 raw oysters -- a great deal before 5PM on the weekends.  My 8-year old foodie daughter never tried raw oysters -- she loved them.  We also ordered the cheese artichoke spinach dip.  It was uber bland. The recipe I use at my home is waaaay better. And the crackers they served with it were rubbery.  On the up side, the crusty bread they put on the table is plentiful and delicious. For lunch my sister and I wanted to each try a couple of sandwiches, so our server was gracious enough to cut each in half and split the meals for us at the table.  That was nice.  Good service. I had the wild boar burger.  My daughter said, ""Mom it tastes like breakfast sausage."" She was right.  It was ok, but a lot like eating Bob Evans sausage on a bun.  My Mom had a crab cake sandwich -- it looked pretty boring - with the bun far exceeding the size of the small perfectly circular, almost machine-manufactured-looking patty.  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves, and the environment went a long was to keeping the kids entertained while we waited such a long time for our food.  If not for the boats going by at Navy Pier, they would have been terribly bored.

The restaurant has two floors; the first floor is the bar and the second floor the more formal restaurant. Dark wood floors, snappy fresh white linens made us think that we were going to be in for some good food and good service. We had made reservations on Open Table using Navy Pier's free wi-fi so even though the restaurant was hopping, we were able to get a table right away.  The hostess seated us by the window and within seconds a waitress had come by to ask us for our drink order. The lunch special included a great selection of dollar oysters -- so as a table we ordered a half dozen. Those came out within a couple of minutes and were so good we promptly ordered another dozen of the same kind. So far so good -- but from here on it started to crumble. I ordered the white fish almondine, one of my companions -- the blue crab salad and the other the wild boar burger.  The entrees came before the second order of oysters had come along with a basket of bread and a slab of butter. The bread had been microwaved and had become chewy.  As to the entrees:  My white fish almondine with wilted spinach and roasted fingerling potatoes was totally meh and poorly plated. The fish was a bit overcooked and lacking in any kind of seasoning.  The blue crab salad also suffered from terminal blahness and included some very unripe cubed mango.  The wild boar hamburger was served with a jicama slaw salad and sweet potato fries. Again no seasoning on anything.  Really no Love to be found anywhere on any plate! When we were half-way done the waitress appeared with the new set of oysters. Again the oysters were delicious but it was obvious we had been served a different kind of oysters not the original ones we had ordered. When I pointed this out to the waitress she disagreed with me but after pressing it further she agreed to ask the oyster bar. She came back at the end of the meal and finally agreed that the oysters had been different.

A few other main courses included the soft shell crab sandwich which was good, and the crabcake sandwich which was good too.  I wouldn't go on my own dime because there is certainly better seafood to be had elsewhere (for less) but it was an enjoyable experience with decent food.   I've read a few reviews about crappy service but we had decent services, maybe because we were the only ones there for the first hour or so and then the restaurant filled up but even then I did not find the service to be lacking.",0.9952,0.78,0.194,0.026,0.520019305019305

The salmon was soft and a good quality - I didn't think it was disgusting like some other yelpers.  My fiance actually thought the salmon was the best he's had b/c it was so tender but still crisply grilled on the edges.  The butternut squash ravioli was decent, with the maple really making the dish sweeter than expected. The desserts were excellent - the carrot cake was really a mini cake, slathered in excellent cream cheese frosting (too much frosting but still excellent).  The selection of gelatos dish gives you 4 scoops of gelato - SO MUCH FOOD!  The hazelnut was the favorite, tasting like a frozen and creamy Ferrero Rocher.  Drool!

I am not a huge tuna fan, which they are known for, but instead usually have a fillet or lobster tail.  I like my fillet medium rare and it comes to the table with just the right amount of red and it is pull apart tender.  You will barely need to use the steak knife except to help pull it apart.  If I have the lobster tail it comes to the table not over cooked and rubbery, but melt in your mouth tender.  I have also done the scallop fettuccine and the linguine clams and they are excellent.

It might have been our timing, but this is one of the most perfect meals I have experienced in Chicago. We had a 9:30 reservation, on 4th of July. We walked in, got seated at our window seat, ordered some wine and bang, boom, pow, the fireworks started and we had a quiet, front row seat, all while avoiding the crowd and enjoying a well-filled bread basket. The food was stellar, the waiters (many of them to our table) were attentive. Loved my fish.  By the time we left, the fireworks crowd had vanished and we had Navy Pier to ourselves while throroughly satisfied with our meal and wine.  This is the only way I will enjoy Navy Pier.

Upstairs is the nice expensive sit down, where as, main level is the bar and restaurant.  ===========  ==================   ============= Main level screams chain type of restaurant. The upstairs area with the advertised breath taking view is completely different. This review covers the bar and restaurant area. Upon meeting the bartender I knew this was going to be a sucky dinner. He didn't listen or take notes when I ordered my cheeseburger and when mentioned how the meat should be cooked. Just responded okay and that was that. I say it screams chain just because of the way different things were handled. Many of the drinks one orders at a resort; margaritas, pina coladas, etc, these typical drinks are usually kept premixed constantly sifted in a machine. My pina colada could have just been a virgin daiquiri since I couldn't taste the Bacardi light rum used. I know, Bacardi light ?! I didn't ask for it, it's on the menu. A tasty concoction with a crappy four second pour, which served up $8.50 of a waste. $4.50 would've been right on and that is the cost of their virgin smoothie. Cheeseburger had a warm fluffy bun but the meat and cheddar cheese just didn't surprise me, fries were cold by the time the food was delivered.  Words of advice: Stick to beer unless you order cocktails with booze you choose. For a far better experience head upstairs, but note that the menu's are different between floors. Also, two different experiences although the décor is almost alike. The upstairs requires a reservation and the guest services lady takes reservations with a pinkie up.

I don't know if it's anything like it used to be, but when we were there, it was fantastic. We each ordered a fruit ice cream (which was most likely sorbet, but anywho) which actually came in the fruit we ordered. I had pineapple ice cream and it came in a scooped out pineapple. One girl ordered peach, which came in an entire peach-including the top, which they placed delicately on top of the ice cream. Someone else ordered coconut and it was served to her in half of a coconut.  All in all, the wonderful desserts are very enjoyable, but none of the 6 of us would ever go back there for food.

2009-06-02,1.0,"Review Tagline: ""Single Worst Restaurant I've Ever Been To"" And here go the whys and what the hellos: So my girlfriend and I were strolling the Navy Pier on our first trip to Chicago and came across this beautifully located, high-class dock joint and here is the only good thing about this restaurant--the view of Burnham Park and the Museum of Science and Industry is very nice. Before even having the opportunity to sit down, the very cold concierge had asked me if I would remove my hat... alright, that is acceptable; however, may I please have an opportunity to sit in my chair first? Why is this acceptable? Because it set a standard for this place that they were very ""classy"" and that naturally the food would follow suit, because how could a trash restaurant require hats to be removed, right? Wrong. Way wrong! Why doesn't Yelp allow me to distribute no-star reviews?? Let the sadness begin. There's a yelper on here who seems to've practically had my evening's menu and I wonder just what hallucinogen she must be taking on a near hourly basis: Steamed Black Mussles in a white wine garlic sauce to begin. Oh Seattle, how you may have spoiled me for life on just what great seafood is... however, in the case of Riva, I believe that Steamed Black Mussles from Taco Bell in Wyoming (yeah, not even Long John Silver) would surpass Riva's. They tasted like fish. They're shellfish... mussles to be exact... they should not taste like rotted trout. They were chewy, rubbery and utterly unsavory in every possible way (sans the white wine garlic sauce, which was a delicious dip for our bread, which was so stale it was practically uneatable otherwise). Okay Michael, so the mussles were a grade south of terrible... perhaps it was just a bad batch and the entrees will compensate. I had the Riva Lobster Diavolo, which came in a spicy tomato sauce. It was AMAZINGLY BAD (and this was with my girlfriend paying). It was bland... no, no... it was tasteless, entirely. Not just tasteless, but overcooked and the spaghetti and the sauce equated a poor man's spaghetti-os. My girl had the Hawaiian Uhu with lobster. Again... overcooked and bland. If I could give this restaurant partial stars on individual portions of the meal, this would receive half-a-star simply for being the least worst thing we had all night. ""Dessert?"" Hell no. You are receiving no more of our money. And then came the bill. We knew it was going to be high, of course, because the prices are on the menu; however, $140 for our meal (alcohol and tip included) had us both walking out of there a bit funny, if you know what I mean. My back was hurting... it was painful... The two worst things about this place were both personal and professional and we'll get into the professional aspect of it first: The place was packed! And I mean packed!!! With people who appeared to be regulars!!! Who are you people?? What South Side sewer did you crawl out of wearing your J. Crew shirts and Yacht Club jackets?? Have you no shame?? You will now be dropped into my mental filing as the type of people who believe that price denotes quality, because I really wish we hadn't joked about going to McDonald's on our way down the pier. The personal: I take my girlfriend out a lot and this was to be our special night where she was going to take me out on a date. Needless to say, both she and I were very excited about this and I felt a little bad having her drop the money on me; however, she insisted so I was happy to oblige. Unfortunately, this special night was utterly ruined by the single worst meal I have ever had at nearly the highest price I, or anybody I've ever gone with (per person) has ever paid. From a well-versed, fairly well-traveled foodie to you I implore you to spare your wallet, grab a polish sausage off the street and give the rest of your money to a swindler selling fake gold chains on the street to support his ""habits""... you'll actually feel better about where your money has gone.",0.8312,0.823,0.095,0.082,0.6025386243386244

I loved every bite (in-restaurant and leftover too) and so did the folks at my table who I generously gave a bite to. Yum! I also ordered a side to share with my friends. Again, I asked the server for his choice between grilled veggies and asparagus. He said definitely the veggies. I ordered them and another friend ordered the aspargus. I think you can see where I am going with this, but the asparagus were much superior to the veggies. They were perfectly cooked and had a delicious parmasean topping.

I went with my father on a summer day before the lunch rush hour. Soon after we ordered our drinks, the waiter returned to tell us the beer we ordered on tap was out (despite it being early lunch hours) then asked what my father wanted to drink and walked away before asking what I would like as a replacement drink. A manager came over to fix the table we were sitting at because it was extremely off balance and virtually spilling our drinks. After sticking some napkins under the leg, he said nothing and walked away. Quite some time after the waiter returned with one beer and asked what I wanted. I said the same and we asked to order our food in fear that it would take too long for him to return again.  My dad ordered fish and chips and I ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich only to be told 5 minutes later that they were out of that as well. I changed my order to a Caesar salad with chicken. Our food came relatively quickly, but a $15 order of ""fish and chips"" was one dinky sized fish filet thrown atop a bunch of fries. Also, my $3.50 addition of chicken to my salad was unappetizing to the look, and equally distasteful. Overall, these two orders and 4 bottled beers came out to over $60 with tip, and it was one of the worst $60 we have ever spent on a meal downtown.  Riva is not a good place to splurge, or anything close to ""classy"" as many other reviewers have tried to categorize it.

The cream of crab soup was actually very good and a great start to a good meal.  We decided on a bottle of wine when we got sat (a decently priced bottle of Pinot Noir [my favorite]) and then dove right into entrees. I went for scallops and my lady friend got a Maryland style jumbo lump crab cake. After about twenty minutes the food arrived. My scallops were good, not spectacular, and my ladies crab cake, which, being from Maryland, is a scary thing to order, was exceptional.  We then finished the meal off with a nice slice of cheesecake. We then stuck around to finish our bottle of wine and then watch the fireworks show which I believe goes down twice during the week at the navy pier.  All in all it was a good experience.

And 'It's good! It's really good!' Here's the real rundown on the experience and quality of food: We ordered a seafood combination appetizer, and this monstrous platter of oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar salad, and crab salad comes out. This looked like a platter of some of my favorite things in the world, and so it only made the outcome that much more soul crushing. The oysters were large, but so bland and stale, that I had to smother mine in horseradish just to give it some taste. The jumbo shrimp was good, but we ran out of cocktail sauce, and couldn't flag down the waiter. The tuna in the tartar salad was tasteless, bland, and oddly chewy for tuna. The vinaigrette did nothing for it, and the whole thing looked like some angsty, angry person had gone to town on some poor tuna with a dull cleaver. Crab salad was also nothing special. Now, I know we don't get the freshest seafood in Chicago, but if you think the stuff at Riva tastes like anything other than slimy sawdust, you are seriously dellusional. My actual meal was an ahi tuna and gruyere sandwich. The ahi tuna was seared nicely, but the whole thing was on a glorified hamburger bun. Come on people, a hamburger burger bun? Isn't this supposed to be a NICE place? And it wasn't even toasted! It looked and tasted like a spongy, un-toasted, I-bought-it-at-the-corner-store hamburger bun.

'Professional' might not be the best word for the vibe I got, but it's what comes to mind now.  To further explain, I would argue that Riva is to restaurants as local TV news anchors are to people; they might be superficially attractive, but for the most part they aren't especially interesting on a deeper level [Veronica Corningstone excepted, of course].   They also get paid disproportionately more than most might believe they are worth, yet the multitudes continue to watch [or eat], therefore perpetuating the cycle of perceived value.  Anyway .... The service Solid at all points of contact.  Hostess who greeted us was pleasant.  The manager who sat us was accommodating, quickly picking up that we'd prefer one of the 4 empty booths rather than one of the tables he was heading toward initially.  And he offered this switch without the hint of exasperation these requests tend to elicit.  Our waiter was helpful without being over the top.  And the kitchen completely re-plated the 'fillet mignon three-way' when I asked that it be given a little more heat [this was my fault - I should have just ordered it medium well in the first place].  They could have just reheated the fillet and left my partially dug into 'risotto cakes' as is, but they cleaned the whole thing up - nice touch.   The food 'Giant lump crab cake' appetizer was nice, though for me it's really the sauce that makes it since I'm not a huge crab fan.  My wife liked her lobster diablo pasta [I think that's what it was - something with a little spice to it].  And the 'fillet mignon three-way' [wonder if they are deliberately trying to create for their tourist clientele some sense of big city, naughty double-intendre excitement with that name...?] was very nice.  At $31.95 you are most definitely, as most here have commented, paying for the view, though.   The wine list had some variety, but didn't strike me as particularly adventurous or creative.  But I'm an amateur wine critic at best, so take that with a grain of salt.  My sense was they had a couple of safe, solid representations from a handful of the most popular regions.  Not a boatload of depth, not too many surprises or indie winemakers represented that I could discern.  We found a relatively decent value in the Casa Lapostolle Merlot at $40.   Dessert  My wife liked the white chocolate creme brulee more than I did, and I liked the assorted gelato more than she did, but we each liked what we liked a lot.  The gelato may have been the single best value item of the night, as you get a generous pile o' scoops to contend with.  Could easily be enough for 3 people to have modest tastes [or enough for 1 wife and 1 pig of a husband ...]",0.9967,0.753,0.185,0.062,0.5195389266817839
