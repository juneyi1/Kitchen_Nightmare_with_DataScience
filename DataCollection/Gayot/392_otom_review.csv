2011-09-27,4.0,Such friendly service for a great dining experience.  My favorite was the well executed dessert:  a coconut semifreddo.   The sake wine pairings went really well with the light and creative cuisine.  Where else do you eat a split pea baby pancake?!  Where else?,0.952,0.653,0.347,0.0,0.6642857142857144
2011-02-28,3.0,"There's alot of hype about otom, being moto's sister restaurant. But it was a big disappointment. There was no unique dishes on the menu, and the basic steak entree was not impressive, especially at the price we paid. The texture was much too chewy, and lacked flavor. Although everything was still good, you can get much better for those prices.  Perhaps because of the hype, I have always had high expectations. And perhaps because of that, I was disappointed when we visited. On the pro, however, the restaurant itself is very roomy with a posh feel. The waiter was very friendly and funny, and extremely helpful. Very attentive service! However, I wouldn't be returning any time soon.",0.6746,0.791,0.122,0.087,0.6353125000000001

2010-11-23,3.0,Some friends and I had dinner at Otom on Saturday. Don't blink or you will miss it as your cab zips by the small dark storefront with no visible signage. Its in the Fulton Market area next to its sister Moto and just west of Publican.  The space is mimimalist with low lighting and general mod style. But we were there for the food which succeded at being both delicious and reasonable. To start we loved the oyster appetizer with pork belly accents. Definitely try the sweatbreads in the thick soup which was tender and rich. For dinner the lamb T-bone pleased our ladies (who both had it) and I really enjoyed the pork cheek main course. For sides definitely order the mac n cheese which was mixed with fall apples that really put it on the map. Summary- Otom is a good spot for hi quality casual dining in a cool urban setting.,0.9804,0.775,0.191,0.034,0.5102272727272728
2010-11-15,3.0,"I have incredibly mixed reviews on Otom. There were some highlights and some low points. For example, the ambiance is comfortably modern but it exudes no warmth. The service was impecable, but it could have been due to the fact that there were only 7 tables being served. It was not a typical Chicago dining experience.  The bread and butter was phenomenal! So we were off to a good start. We ordered the oyster and pork belly appetizer. This was moderately delicious; the baked oyster worked perfectly with the unctuous belly. It was a very satisfying way to start the meal.  I ordered the special, Skate, and it was accompanied with barley risotto, and some other forgettable sides. The fish was perfectly cooked, and had a lingenberry sauce that accentuated the sweetness from the fish. The barley and other sides were borderline gross (my apologies to the chef for being so curt). The risotto was over salted and had a gummy texture.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was mediocre, even though it was poached in butter, and the portion was questionable. However, the waffles were a highlight from the evening. Made with ritz crackers, this was the most perfectly buttery waffle I have ever had.  We ordered the graham cracker grits for dessert which was basically crushed graham crackers, chocolate drizzle and marshmallows. This dessert was almost good, I really tried to like it, but the texture was meh. It needed something more most than the chocolate. I suggest caramel while my boyfriend suggests a raspberry sauce, which I happen to agree with upon further review!  Anyway, if you bought the Groupon, it's worth trying this restaurant.

The whole time I was eating, I was shooing the flies away. Flies in the dining room is never a good sign b/c the kitchen is always 10 times worse. I tried to enjoy my steak, as it melted in my mouth, yet I wondered if I was eating flies, fly eggs, or who knows what else. I would have walked out, but I was there for a friends birthday with others I didn't know. One girl tried to say it was fruit fly season?!

2010-10-30,2.0,"UGH. Due to its association with Moto, I really had high hopes for this place. I daydreamed about trying this place out all week.....only to walk out disappointed tonight.  The butter that accompanies the complimentary bread was very interesting -- it had a subtle hint of sweet maple syrup which kind of reminded me of a McGriddle bun. The umami burger was......tasteless. Absolutely lackluster. It lacked basic seasoning (i.e. salt & pepper) which ultimately resulted in its downfall. The sunchoke soup, pork entree, and side of russian potatoes were okay, yet uninspiring. The mac and cheese was the highlight of the meal -- thus the extra star rating. It's admixed with thinly sliced apples which gave it just the right kick of acidity. Extremely well done. Too bad none of the other food could measure up.  Not sure what all the hype is about.

2010-10-15,4.0,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a great meal at Otom recently... from our drinks down to dessert, we liked everything we ordered, and I loved the hip-but-still-inviting atmosphere. Our waitress was great and recommended that if we liked spicy stuff, we try the chicken wings, which were coated in some sort of togarashi spice blend. Now, I am normally one to embrace ""the spice"" but these were seriously the hottest wings I have ever encountered in my life. I felt as though I might pass out at the table. If I had taken too large a whiff it's possible that my nose would have melted completely off my face.  Having said that, they were knock-your-socks-off delicious and I would order them again. The chicken was cooked perfectly and we finished this course with a masochistic sense of accomplishment. I would not recommend this dish if you're on, say, a first date and trying to impress someone. Crying during dinner is not sexy. But for anyone else who can take the heat, these are worth a try. So anyway, these chicken wings set an exciting and dangerous tone to the meal. What could possibly be next? We calmed things down with a delicious ""caprese gnocchi"" dish - the gnocchi was slightly crispy on the outside and tender inside with a great basil flavor, and the plate was filled with tomatoes, fresh mozzarella balls, and a balsamic reduction. We also shared the flat iron steak with feta and green bean salad, and a side of buttery, garlicky summer squash.  It may be cliche, but I still love flourless chocolate cake, especially with a twist like horchata-flavored creme anglaise, and soy sauce in the caramel ice cream. Dessert did not disappoint!

I had the moon--something cocktail and the cucumber dill one, which was surprisingly fantastic and not to savory and not too sweet either.   The forager plate was awesome.  We especially devoured the red rice risotto balls and crispy kale. I also really enjoyed the frutti de mar salad.  It reminded me of a seafood salad I had in Naples, Italy near the fishermen's docks.  I remember everything else was cooked to perfection. Even the vanilla butter with the bread was interesting.  The only thing I could have done without was the truffled mac and cheese.  It didn't seem too cheesy, and I wasn't a fan of the truffle in this situation.

I recommend the mac and cheese and pork belly for an appetizer. The main courses however are really bland. Many restaurants don't put salt and pepper on the tables because they think their food is already so flavorful. Not the case here. The pork loin with white bean was meh.

The duck breast that I had was medium rare with crispy skin, just the way I like it.  It was served in one of the most flavorful broths I've ever tasted alongside a duck egg.  The desserts we ordered, the polenta cake and the flourless chocolate cake, were a treat, but TINY.  It's a nice restaurant, but  for $8, I expected to be served more than something half the size of a Two-Bite Brownie.  This is mainly the reason why I wouldn't give Otom a 5-star rating.  Everything else was great.  The service was friendly, informative, and very attentive.",0.9788,0.856,0.144,0.0,0.6132352941176471

And instead of bread he made some rice crisps, also EXCELLENT. The crispy fingerlings, again outstanding, were served with the parmesan on the side. The feta and pita were also on the side of the delicious flat iron steak. I was not able to taste the flourless chocolate cake but I was told it was the highlight of the meal.

2010-09-23,3.0,"Went here on a Wednesday night to use my Groupon before it expired. I wasn't super impressed with the food but some parts were good. What struck me was the disparity of the sizes of dishes relative to their price. We ordered: prosciutto & melon soup - TINY, but good. Proscuitto wasn't really crispy as advertised, but you can't beat the combination of flavors. pork belly - very good, especially with the bbq, pineapple, poblano accompaniments, but (again) very small portion (roughly 2.5x2.5x.75in piece) umami burger - a lot of meat. I think it wasn't juicy enough, or maybe the other parts of the burger didn't stand out enough. it seemed dry.. pretty unspecial. i was excited about the ponzu mayo too, but couldn't really taste it.  duck breast - loved the presentation. the duck breast was tender and flavorful, the duck egg was perfectly done, the miso dashi was yummy - overall, i really liked the dish (including portion size and price) flourless chocolate cake - light and slightly crunchy on the outside, moist and rich on the inside. came with soy sauce & caramel ice cream (a play on salted caramel) - good combo! again, tiny portions. Oh, and we had bread and honey truffle butter which was delicious. So, I give Otom a 3.

My husband and I both got the Pre Fixe dinner since they will only do it if the entire table is getting it. He also got the wine pairing and raved about how surprised he was that the wines selected were so good. We started out with the ravolis that had micro-basil and heirloom tomatoes, we were both a little worried that since the first course was so tiny that we would need to stop on the way home to grab some fast food but that wasn't the case. The second course was a steak dinner with twice baked potatoes and some sour greens that were delicious. It was a full portion and was quite filling. The last course was  some kind of citrius cookie/cake call with greek yogurt gelato. It could just be that my taste is alittle off since I am pregnant so I didn't love it, but my husband did.

My date and I went there on a Saturday night and arrived around 10:30 PM or so. It was surprisingly empty, but I didn't really mind. I wasn't looking (or expecting) a lot of commotion. We sat down in the small lounge area and one of the bar tenders came over right away with drink menus. The cocktail list was, unsurprisingly, unique and had plenty of options that sounded delicious.  I ordered Pocket Aces and my date ordered a Blackberry Mojito. I was pleasantly surprised with my drink. It was light in color and the Scotch was really smooth. My girlfriend, however, wasn't impressed with her drink. I tried it, and it was interesting, but I agreed that I wouldn't want an entire glass of it.  Another bar tender came over (possibly the mixologist) and asked what we thought about our drinks. We had a good conversation where he explained our drinks and the choices that were made, including why they chose to use Inca Kola rather than a standard cola. Very cool! The music was an interesting mix of electronica and jazz which I really liked. It wasn't too distracting but it definitely was there as part of the atmosphere.

2010-08-15,5.0,"I have but a simple, but satisfying, update to my Otom review -- first, still a 5-star experience.  Second, and most importantly, amongst the entrees ordered by my fellow diners, I had the burger off of the ""lounge"" menu.  To be ""SMC"", or ""socially-media-correct"" (look, I dined with some of Chicago's most powerful social media pundits that evening and would be severely admonished and scolded should I NOT be SMC), I ""heart"" (Yelp will not let me use the 'less than"" symbol)  this burger.  Chicago is burgered-out, I mean well-done -- if Tru has M Burger and out-of-staters are slowly immigrating to Chicago (you heard me Five Dudes) -- so I am quite picky and critical of the burgers I order nowadays.   Otom's burger, as simply put as possible, is simply delicious.  The fried green tomato was crisp on the outside, and provided a nice tart finish to every bite.  Pancetta = bacon = meat candy (I can't improve on that statement...you have all heard from me before about my wanton lust of bacon).  And I love the buns of pretzels!  Soft, chewy, salty.  And, it wasn't a 10-inch thick bun, when combined with all of the other ingredients, presented you with a burger that only the douche from Fatty vs. Food would try to bite into or requires a chainsaw to cut in half.  Surprisingly, the chef sort of, well, ""squishes it down"", I don't know any other way to describe it -- it was an excellent holder for the meat and accoutrement.  Oh, and the beef patty.  OOOOOOh, that sexy little patty of ground meat goodness.  I asked for medium; medium (EXACTLY medium) is what I got.  Very well seasoned and beefy tasting.  Daddy likey. If  you think it's wrong for me to update with 5 stars for only having the burger, you decide for yourself.  Go to Otom, have the burger, and I DARE you to NOT give five stars for your experience.  Or the burger is on me.",0.9774,0.802,0.131,0.067,0.5504019129019129

2010-07-30,4.0,"My partner and I have had Otom on our list of places to try for a while now for one reason: The Umami Burger.  The name is so tantalizing - would it be a pure umami experience?  We had to find out. Otom is located on Fulton Market; warehouse by day, fashionable district for young people by night.  It is also located right next to Moto, so there were a few seconds where my partner and I waffled outside between the two, figuring out which was which and more importantly, where the doors where for Otom.  If you go, go with sharp eyes because this was a bit of a problem. For a Thursday night the restaurant was fairly busy; it wasn't full, but the staff were busy.  Our  server was phenomenal - she basically bent over backwards to give us a good dining experience.  The main points of Otom are listed here for your convenience:  1. Ordering: The burgers are only on the Lounge menu; we didn't know that there was a separate area or that there were multiple menus to choose from.  Upon request, though, we were given the Lounge menus in addition to the regular menus to make our choice. 2. Menu: The Umami burger is no longer on the menu!  They are in the middle of a menu change that isn't reflected on the website.  Very sad face.  Very very sad face. 3. Appetizers: The mac & cheese side sounds like a good idea, but it's not.  It's bland.  Carefully created & definitely bland.  The corncake garnish was a very nice treat, though.  I ate some of my partners dish, an unusual take on buffalo chicken (from the Lounge menu).  That  was freakin' delicious and I would go back just to have that again. 4. Entree: I had the chef's pick of the day, a whitefish served over spinach & chickpeas with some smelt on the side.  It was truly good - there was a savory, salty sauce that was an amazing compliment to the spinach.   5. Portion size: In the past I've found that when paying Otom prices, one usually gets small yet tasty portions of food.  At Otom, you pay those prices and get fairly large yet tasty portions of food.  I will admit that I was full after the mac & cheese and that the entree had to fit into the remaining nooks & crannies in my stomach (it was worth it).  6. Service: One person to serve the bread, another to serve the beer/wine, and the main server to tend to you throughout.  Everyone was just plain nice.  No obsequious behavior, no awkward behavior, nothing - just normal people doing a good job who appreciate a thank you and contribute to a good dining experience.  Our server was great, seeking out the Lounge menus for her hapless diners & granting an exception to serving the Lounge food in the main dining room, explaining all the menu changes, and being present but not hovering.   7. They don't take Discover, FYI. In conclusion, I'd come again if I was in the mood for something upscale.  There were a lot of options on the menu that looked good, and an outdoor seating area for those who want to pop by and much on some amazingly umami buffalo chicken appetizer.  The service can't be beat, and don't order the mac & cheese.",0.9964,0.805,0.146,0.049,0.5530558947225612

Nothing on the appetizer menu looked great, and after our entrees we did not wish to risk a dessert.  So why did we come? Groupon and curiosity. I was very excited to be there on a Friday night, mood was right, everything was set for a great dinner; except the food and odd service.  1. The Cucumber are made of Pickles (or so?) drink was light and tasty. Recommended! 2. The weird white bread and sweet butter was bland and cheap feeling. 3. The servers were all spaced out and, while not bad, just made us feel awkward.  4. I had done my homework and was ready (and excited!) to order the escolar, but alas they were replacing it with a whitefish. No thanks. So I had the fish special of the day instead -- a marlin with quinoa and edamame puree and papaya something sauce. The contours were fine, but again boring,  but the fish was horrible -- and I usually love the similar swordfish. A bad cut, too many jelly pieces and very fishy tasting -- so much so I got home and had to wash the fish taste/smell off my face, something I never do as I love fish. And it was luke warm. 5. My husband's pork chop was nice, but accompanied by what appeared to be a mound of butter that even his buttter-loving self could not handle. The actual meat was nice, but the rest boring.

We made a reservation for 10:30pm on Friday night just to be safe but it was rather empty, we wouldn't have needed it. I didn't partake but the cocktail menu seems nice and Emily R. enjoyed her drink. Dinner started with a delicious fresh compound butter (melted salt and vanilla) with good bread. The mac & cheese we ordered as an appetizer was very tasty and well executed often places fail when making a bechamel based mac & cheese but Otom did not. For dinner I ordered the pork chop (which was not overcooked!) it came with fried kale and a delicious and inventive corn panna cotta. Desert was the sweet potato cheesecake, which was super smooth and topped with an interesting star anise flavored ice cream.

Intermezzo (said the waitress--free small plate since our entrees were taking a little while): panko crusted green tomato with sundried tomato pesto.  DELICIOUS.  not to mention freeee!  wish they sold this on the menu though. entree: roomie got porkchop--i loved it.  clean, well cooked, and it had this amazing crispy flakes of salted kale...almost like Korean roasted seaweed.  Sooo good.  a foamy, creamy something was on the side that i didn't really care for.    entree 2: mole chicken.  softest chicken i've ever had.  i actually freaked out on the first bite because i thought it had to be raw because i'd never had chicken so soft.  it came with mole, black beans, and this amazing blue corn waffle-like thing.  my roomie's been to mexico and said otom's mole was AMAZING.  i didn't particularly care for the beans, but the waffle, chicken, and mole was really good.  we traded so the roomie could try and she didn't want to give it back.  lol dessert:  BEST PART OF THE NIGHT.  we got this deconstructed golden raisin vanilla pie.  it came out in a mason jar, and it was layers of crumbled nilla wafers, this raisin goodness, whipped cream, etc.  it was incredible.  best end to the night. i'd go back just for the pie. total tab? $79 w/ tip and tax.  but considering we paid $30 for $60 thanks to groupon--it was an amazing deal.  and i left so full i couldn't breathe.  man. i'd give it five stars, but the location, atmosphere, and service weren't amazing.  they kept forgetting to fill our waters, and our dinner took 2+ hours and it wasn't even packed.",0.9986,0.768,0.207,0.025,0.5295503347227484

2010-06-02,4.0,"The boyfriend and I moseyed over to Otom to celebrate our two year anniversary - of dating.  Yes, we're in our twenties and we still celebrate dating anniversaries.  After you stop snickering at our nerdy relationship, do read on. Otom is out there.  Quite a hike for us to get there, and it's on Fulton Market, which houses lots of....food storage buildings and trucks.  Not the sexiest surroundings.  Which is why it's kind of surreal to step inside and be in such a pretty restaurant!  The lighting is low, the chairs are orange, and the brick is exposed.  I would've felt very ""cool"" being there, except there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant.  And nobody else came throughout the night.  Granted, it was a Tuesday, but I think it's safe to say that this restaurant might appreciate some more of your business! So our very friendly server poured us each a glass of the Gruet - which was phoned in as a gift by my dad - and brought out some appetizers (also pre-ordered by the parents).  We enjoyed the sweet wine as we nibbled on the soft bread with truffle-honey butter.  Apparently they change the butter every day, which I think is a snazzy thing to do.  The butter did have a strong sweet flavor, but also a surprisingly addictive quality.  mmmm. So our apps were the frutti di mare - various sea creatures on a bed of greens and celery - and the gnocchi.  Seafood first - a nice mix and a generous portion, a few mussels, oysters, and various calamari lying about.  All had a nice flavor, most were cooked well, some seemed a bit too ""done"" but nothing to get in a tizzy over.  They went well with the salad - that celery was really the ""wow"" factor.  I know, what is so exciting about celery, but it really worked in the dish.  The gnocchi were also very nice - they arrived warm and soft, a very pleasant texture, and were a delicious alternative to our other appetizer. We thought about trying the Tuesday prix-fixe, but apparently the chef prefers the entire table to order it, and we like to order a variety of things when we go out to restaurants.  Usually I am very understanding of chef preferences (like, they don't want you to make substitutions because they've planned the flavors so carefully), but I was a little disappointed that we were discouraged from ordering one prix-fixe and one another entree.  The server reported that the chef thought it would disrupt the continuity and flow of the meal.  I feel like that's something that would be better left to the customer's discretion, but that's just me! So, we didn't get the tasting menu.  The boy got the pork chop, and I got the fish o' the day.  We also got cocktails - the boy got the ""cucumbers are made of pickles"" which is the most hilarious name for a cocktail I have ever seen, and I got the ""Pale Moon.""  Both were delicious.  The fish was (I think) yellowfin snapper.  It was very nice and light, very well cooked, served over quinoa and a bright fennel salad (I think it was fennel.....I try to remember these things).  Very well done fish - I could take or leave the quinoa, but the salad and fish were brilliant together.  My boyfriend enjoyed his pork, and I did too when I tried it.  Neither of us were sold on the corn panna cotta - we were a little confused by it and it didn't really add much to our experience - but I enjoyed snacking on the crispy kale surrounding the plate. Dessert - the chef was kind enough to make us the dessert off the prix-fixe menu, which was the blackberry cobbler, and it ROCKED.  I was obsessed with the warm cobbler and chantilly cream, whereas the boy was floored by the olive oil and basil sorbet.  Both were incredible.  It was my favorite course of the meal, and absolutely perfect for summer. We had a Groupon, AND the free drinks/apps from my parents, so our meal was highly affordable.  If we hadn't had all that, it all probably would've cost $120 before tax and tip.  But, it was a ton of food, and two drinks each, so I'd say it was worth it.  The staff was so pleasant to us, and I'm pretty sure it was the chef who brought us out our dessert and wished us happy anniversary.  how lovely! I think this is a great spot, worth the trek to give a little business to a good restaurant with tasty food and great service.  I don't even think it needs to be a ""special occasion"" - if you're in the area, it'd be great to stop by for appetizers, cocktails, and dessert.  See if they have the blackberry cobbler - mmmm.  I tell ya. Thanks to Otom for giving us a lovely evening at their restaurant to celebrate two years of being together!",0.9997,0.742,0.229,0.029,0.6395620577548291
2010-05-15,3.0,"Otom was a bit hit and miss for me. We had a groupon and had been wanting to try this place for ages, but it didn't get off to the best start. We were given a complimentary glass of sparkling wine and then we ordered our drinks. We waited, and waited, and waited.....and then finally asked our server where they were when our appetizers arrived and we were still sitting there with no drinks.  Finally my drink, made with lime and egg white came out (it was okay, but tasted more like a margarita made with egg white than anything creative). It was nearly another 10 minutes before my husband's drink came out. The server was very apologetic and comped the drink, but I would have been more impressed had he, upon realizing the drinks were taking forever, brought out another glass of sparkling wine.  My husband's drink was just okay as well - to me it tasted too heavily of cinnamon. We were later told the drinks took so long because the regular bartender was at a wedding and the bartender working was from moto. Maybe that explains the underwhelming taste too?  That wasn't our only drink problem that night either. We moved on to beer with our entree. This time my husband got his while I waited. Apparently they were out of the beer I ordered so they were going next door to see if moto had any. This time my husband suggested they pour me a glass of sparkling wine while I waited. Instead they brought me a raspberry beer, which was actually quite tasty, so I drank that. But come on, getting a drink shouldn't be such an ordeal.  Now, I know shit happens. So had the food blown me away, I would have put all this drink business out of my mind immediately. Unfortunately, it didn't. The escarole was not to my liking at all (I didn't like the crunchy texture mixed with the warmth of the baked escarole) and the pork belly croquete was very good, but just lacked something.  I was ready to give up, but the husband insisted we give an entree a shot. I am so glad we did because it was the saving grace of the meal. The chicken was poached in butter and was so juicy and so tender, the huz and I were ready to fight each other for the last few bites. It was served on a mole soaked johnny cake (which was like a corn-based waffle) that was also excellent. The mac and cheese didn't have the same wow factor for me (and I love mac n cheese). It was very mild and light, with sweet peas, bechamel and goat cheese.  We passed on dessert because nothing on the menu sounded good. I'm a firm believer that it's not dessert it it doesn't contain chocolate.  All in all, it wasn't bad. But it wasn't amazing. Okay, well the chicken - that was amazing. And so was our $3.50 bill after the groupon, and after the server comped our drinks.",0.9968,0.78,0.165,0.055,0.5497970085470084
2010-05-10,3.0,"My boyfriend and I were searching for a decent dining establishment around 9:30 on a Friday night, so we hopped over to The Publican only to hear that they had a wait of 45-60 minutes. Yikes! Luckily I had wanted to try Follia which was just a block away, so we continued west only to realize that it wasn't open. We instead walked in to the brightly lit restaurant next door and they told us Follia had closed just a week ago - too bad! I saw them on Check Please a few months back and had wanted to try it since. The hostess at Otom showed us their menu assuring us the food was very good, and off we were to our table. We started the meal with their flat bread which came with pork, black beans, cilantro and red onions. I could have done without the black beans, personally. Perhaps it wasn't a flavor I was in the mood for.  For my meal, I ordered their fish special: flounder with kale and what looked like miniature lentils. My first thought when I took a bite into it was that it was SALTY. Something about it kept telling me to eat it, but by the time I was finished, I just about drank 5 glasses of water. Whoa.  My boyfriend ordered the smoked pork chop and he described it pretty well when he said it tasted like Pringles. Yep, it did! We ended the meal with their coconut/chocolate/ginger/green tea/lemongrass concoction, which was really interesting, and probably my favorite part of the meal - well, I suppose dessert always is! I couldn't really tell you what it was exactly, except the consistency was kind of like flan. Strange, but tasty. Our server was fantastic. He was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and was truly interested to know how we liked everything. 5 stars for service, but I'd have to take away a couple for the amount of salt in my dish.

We started with the German potato salad gnocchi which was perfect for two people and tasted great. The gnocchi seemed a little soft but tasted great. Our server was extremely friendly and the service level was good although there was a laid back approach. I ordered the burger and my girlfriend had the vegetarian forager plate. Her plate was a cube/patty of polenta which seemed breaded and fried. It was surrounded by an awesome red/green kale and some mushrooms. She loved it. My umami burger (I wish they had a veggie burger) was excellent. I thought it was a bit big so I just ate the burger and toppings and tossed the bun after a few bites. The burger came with some pretty good chips. We shared an order of mac & cheese. This ain't your mom's Mac and Cheese unless your mom is an artist! This M&C was amazing. The sweet pea, bechamel (reminded me of German field salad greens), goat cheese, and pea tendrils was awesome. For dessert she had the Baba and I had the parsnip pie (served in a mason jar).  The bar area is pretty cool and I bet you can get in and out of here for under $50. This is a place where if you don't want to spend $100-200 you can get by with a burger, or fish and chips and a drink or two. We spent $100 and had several drinks.  This place was excellent.

The service was great, very attentive. They offer a selection of very reasonably priced wines both by the glass and bottle, and we got a bottle of gewurz to share.

I also got to try the fish special, which was also good but did not blow my mind. Lastly, for dessert, we had the tiramisu ""donut"" and the cream soda with tapioca balls. The donut was a BEAST.

I've been living in Chicago for 7 months now, and this restaurant is my favorite. The appetizer was an Onion Volute (soup) with a 63-degree egg. Hard-boiled eggs cook at 68 degrees, so by cooking the egg a bit lower it provided for a rich, thick yolk.  I actually was worried about this dish. I have a known allergy to eggs that aren't fully cooked but still decided to go ahead with it just because. Turns out I wasn't, but this was served by the chef who I assured wouldn't be sued if I got sick. The main course was skirt steak flavored with a balsamic marinade then grilled. Served with grilled radicchio lettuce and roasted fingerling potatoes.  All three parts of the dish at once? Tender and juicy from the steak, sweet and sour from the marinade, soft and dense from the potatoes, and crunchy from the lettuce. Ri-diculous. The dessert consisted of two cannolis filled with peppermint cheesecake and served with a scoop of swirl ice cream. There were actually bits of peppermint inside, providing for a surprising texture in a dessert. When combined with a small bit of the ice cream, it capitalized on the mouth's sensitivity after eating peppermint (think drinking cold water after chewing mint gum), leaving me with a cold and creamy flavor that blew me away.

I have no complaints about the service though.  The hostess went out of her way to make sure the members of my party who didn't eat beef would have suitable substitutes.  On NYE, our 5 course prix-fixe was actually more like 7 courses, having added a eye-dropper with lobster bisque and a wonton plus a small extra dessert item (?) later. From what I remember, the salad item with ankimo was special....the buffalo carpaccio was interesting and not gamey, though not particularly tasty if not for the small lumps of creamy flavoring.  The fish (cod?) was tender and delicious.  The flank steak was slightly overdone, but the sauces made up for it.  The 151/rum flambe twinkie tasted quite alcoholic. Our waitress was very hospitable though...good feedback from her prompted the choice of a nice Chilean sauvignon blanc.  The hostess and waitress also accommodated our birthday cake and made it a seamless add to our existing meal courses.  We were given just enough attention to feel special and not burdened. All in all, it was a nice, quiet NYE.  Still a little miffed by the last minute prix fixe surprise, though we were given excellent service.  Would like to go back for a normal meal...the place is gorgeous and very date-worthy!",0.9926,0.805,0.157,0.038,0.49073242630385483
2010-01-04,1.0,"As much as I wished I liked this place, you are better off dining elsewhere. My fiancee and I came expecting a gourmet twist on classic staples, after seeing really interesting takes on mac n' cheese, meatloaf, etc. on their menu in the past.  The concept is an interesting one, and the atmosphere is great as well -- not too loud, but enough going on to keep things lively. Cool fireplace loungy area when you walk in that caught our eye as well.  However, the heart and soul of any restaurant -- the food -- really blew.  Almost every dish we tried was uber-fatty, and the waiter even acknowledged this before we ordered, saying that ""the duck is from the fattiest part of the bird, and a lot of people send it back because they think they are getting the worst part, but really it's the most succulent."" Well we didn't go with the duck, as *tasty* as that sounded, and instead settled on a prix fixe menu for $25 each plus the optional $15 per person wine pairing (3 tiiiiiiiny glasses of wine - each pour was between 4 and 5 oz. ... lame).  The menu was asparagus with duck liver and a 63 degree egg (quivering, almost like jelly), then on to jerk bbq rib tips over polenta, finishing off with the lamest dessert I have ever heard of (more on that later).  The asparagus were tiny and stringy, the ribs were about 60% fat -- NO EXAGGERATION -- and the rib seasoning was way too light to be classified as jerk (which should be bold and brightly flavored).  The fatty and skimpy portions, and the tasteless polenta bugged me, but it was the dessert that really made me laugh. Dubbed ""College Party"" it was mascarpone cheese shredded onto a wedge of pastry with some jam, and was supposed to look like pizza.  It came with 2 jello shots, one of which almost made me gag (from flavor, not alcohol content).  For such a fancy ""food-forward"" restaurant, I expected better all the way around. To round things out, I will say their wine pairings were excellent, if not entirely to my taste, especially the Malbec that they paired with the ribs.  I forget the name of the vintner, but it was by far the highlight of the $90 prix fixe dinner for two. 1 star = for the cool fireplace and overall vibe and concept.  The 4 ""blanks,"" disappointingly, are all for the food. A novel idea, perhaps, but I'll stick to home cooking where it belongs: at home.",0.9856,0.807,0.134,0.059,0.5212719298245614
2010-01-02,3.0,"Just got back from eating out! Dinner took about 2 hours and we ordered 30 mins after arriving. Our appeitizers came out right away but the main courses took a while to get out. Bread came out with chedder cheese butter...water comes sparking, or not...Voss. Lets see what we had..started off with.... *fish & chips - tempura skate wing, house made pickles, shrimp chips. Good the shrimp chips were like chinese type with big pieces of tempura skate wing. *oyster & pork belly - balsamic-braised pork belly, fried oysters & mayo mustard sauce .VERY GOOD with the pork belly perfectly cooked and then fried oysters were ontop of the set of 3. The mayo mustard sauce came with the right quantity on the plate for beautiful decoration but also to dip the fried oyster in it. MAIN COURSES: *fish - chef's special preparation - the special was a black cod fish (bit salty) with oysters, mushrooms, black beans (really good micro black beans/etc not sure what kind of beans). Smaller portion than I thought it would be but well cooked. *skirt steak - smoked potato planks, savoy, shitake,  & bacon  This actually comes two types as the skirt steak but also flat iron hanger which I got medium rare. It was okay but sorta more chewy than i thought it would be and could have been more moist. *lamb breast ""coq au vin"" - red wine seared lamb breast with rizzi bizzi VERY GOOD everyone loved it, super moist, great portion, meat fell right off the bone and had a pea, cheese, rice, and etc bottom on it. *side of mac and cheese which was great and looked green but not too cheesy and etc. We got the last order of it and it was def something everyone looks forward to when she go to otom. Desserts: *Chilled Chocolate Dome: chicory caramel, cream soda fluff & pretzel brittle .THIS WAS VERYY SWEET and good. It was caramel all over the plate with the fluff (the kind you use to put into sandwiches) and then the pretzel brittle had pieces all over the plate. The chocolate dome tasted like a truffle with peanut butter gooey inside. *Graham Cracker Grits. honey crisp apples, greek yogurt, oats..this came out on a little jar with the greek yogurt harder on the outside so you would use your spoon to open up the inside which melted over the rest of the dessert. * Hot Tattie? caramel with swirled ice cream which my friend loved and wanted to like his bowl. :) Drinks: vodka tonic normal. lichee martini drink my friend had 2 of and really likes them, jack fizz was an interesting carbonated drink that looked like a mojito but pretty good, Riesling wine was very sweet and light, the rest of the drinks I'm not sure about.The drinks could have come out a little faster since the bartender really wasn't that busy. The decor looks like an ikea advertisement. Bright orange chairs, horizontal lines down to stop you from stairing at people. The place was 1/3 full and it was freezing outside. Very simple look but well set up for the purpose. The lounge chairs at the front and the high tables were by the bar while the dining individuals were sitting in the back.  CD kept on skipping not not many people realized it.  Dinner came out to be 260 for the 4 of us with the tax tip etc. The plates were about 18-27 with desserts about 9 dollars and etc. 6 drinks, 2 appeitizers, 2 side, and 4 main dishes, 3 desserts. The server was really nice and explained everything and recommend dishes for the future. Overall: everyone liked the food for the most part....I def thought most of the stuff was a bit more on the salty side. Well cooked but salty. One sixty blue had a LOT better steak, the appeitizer pork belly was def better, food on the salty side and about normal portions...the desserts were VERY sweet and I wish there were more options.

Service was adequate.  Place wasn't that busy so there were a lot of staff standing around.  Our waiter was okay but he was easily distracted and completely ignored a member of our party when they tried to make him aware of excessive sediment in a glass of wine.  And while I may not know much about  working in a restaurant, I have never seen a server just leave a table because his ""shift was over"".  Our second server finished the last part of the meal and he gave the attitude that he couldn't have cared less. Food was average.  They obviously spent more time coming up with ""catchy, simple"" descriptions on the menu than actually trying to put out good food. If your food is supposed to be comfort and basic, you shouldn't have to try so hard to make them sound better on the menu.  Chicken & Waffles was just okay.  The mahi mahi special was way too salty and dry.  The lamb was more fat than meat.  The sweet bread appetizer was good but that was clearly overshadowed by the sub-par entrees.  The two desserts we tried were both epic failures.  Some sort of carmel popcorn dish that tasted like a seven year old child threw a bunch of stuff  in a bowl.  The graham cracker grits was a mixture of pudding, oatmeal, tapioca and baby food.  Nothing good about it at all.

I've come to rely on Yelp for recommendations, and I wanted only the best for my boyfriend - a definite foodie - on his birthday. Man were we disappointed... The food was only passable, the service was terrible, and we will definitely never return again.  The waiter was clearly flustered every time he approached our table (which was only infrequently), and we had to flag down busers to ask for water refills while waiting for our drinks and for bread (which looked like Wonder Bread).  Before the waiter even told us about the specials of the day, he launched into a number of menu changes due to already being out of certain ingredients (by 8pm? really?).  The oysters and pork belly appetizer was actually pretty tasty, but my boyfriend's entree was cold and I was stuck with an overpriced dish because they were out of the fish I really wanted.  OR were they??  As we asked for our check (opting out of dessert since the experience was so poor), we noticed our neighbors feasting away on the dorade I was denied. The only saving grace was that they told us it was overcooked and tasteless. And to top the night off, they overcharged us until I pointed it out to another passing waitress.  We did get a free dessert (since I had mentioned in my reservation that it was my beau's birthday), but my boyfriend thinks that was more to apologize for the crap service than for his birthday.   The table next to us, with whom we bonded over the dorade and overall poor experience, had actually been to Otom twice before and assured us that they were just as miserable as we were and that it must be an ""off night.""  One thing we all agreed on, however, bad night or not - we're not going back...",-0.3275,0.817,0.102,0.08,0.5813732563732564

2009-11-22,3.0,"I was really looking forward to dining at Otom since my friend had raved about it AND it was one of those more trendy/nicer restaurants that I don't get to frequent too often.  I will have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I think I ordered the wrong entree and probably went on an off night.  First I will start with what I liked:  -The atmosphere. It was cool, contemporary and had the vibe that made you feel like you were trendy (even if you are not.) The decor was perfect for what kind of feel they were going for: white, clean and modern.  -The oyster and pork belly app. Although I didn't feel that the two went together all that well, individually, I loved both of them. But really, I probably would like any type of oyster and pork belly unless you really screwed it up! -My boyfriend's skirt steak strip. It was prepared perfectly and had a nice smoky bacon flavor to it. -The lychee martini. It had a wondeful flavor and wasn't too sweet or strong. I also liked the lychee sorbet. Perfect thing to cleanse your palette.  OK. Now the things that weren't that good...  -My entree: the dorade. I made the mistake of not really listening to the waiter when he was describing it and didn't realize that the whole fish would be presented but the fillets would be separated out. And that it was fried, too. It was also a lot of fish. Too much. The flavor was good, but I just didn't like the presentation or the execution. I would have preferred a clean fillet prepared in a light garlic butter sauce. I think the thing that made me order it was that it came with mussels and fingerling potatoes, but the mussels were sparse and the potatoes were soggy.  -The service. First of all, while our waiter was answering our questions about the menu, he stopped mid-sentence and said that he had to go to another table to give them silverware. What? That was really weird. He did apologize, but still. Also, our entrees took an unusually long time to come out. They came out an apologized twice, though, and said it was because there were 2 large parties that were there. (Hmmm... shouldn't they be prepared for a full house on a weekend, which it definitely wasn't.) I kind of got to a point where I wasn't even that hungry by the time the food came out. Anyway, they did apologize and comped us a round of drinks and then a sorbet at the end of the meal. So that was at least nice.  Overall, it wasn't get greatest experience, but I think I ordered the wrong entree and possibly went on an off night.

App: Followed another Yelper's suggestion and went with the Oyster and Pork Belly.  Hello, beautiful.  Amazing delicious explosion of crunch and squish, savory and sweet (some kind of mayo sauce--I don't even like mayo).  Clearly, this dish was made by some god, sent down from the heavens, and given to me.  To eat.  Forever.  I also tried the fried onions from the bar--tasty, but too many (I felt kind of over-greased from eating them).  The curry ketchup that came with them were inspired, though. Mains: Tried the skirt steak (potatoes WAY too salty, steak not a good cut, and kind of chewy) and the pork shoulder (potatoes were OMG--half butter and half potato!, pork shoulder was good, not didn't have any wow flavors).  I don't hold the skirt steak against them, though, since the person who ordered it liked it. Dessert: Caramel popcorn (with corn caramel drizzle, chocolate, caramel corn, and caramel corn sorbet) was DELICIOUS.  Must eat each bite with the sorbet--to die for.  Plus the presentation is really cool.  Chocolate dome was good, but not out of this world (again, not my food, so oh well).  The brittle that came w/ the dome was great, though.

Secondly, the chef had dumped an entire container of salt into the acorn squash side - we assumed he mistook it for the sugar. It was inedible. Also, the server had the annoying habit of pointing out what was on your plate. I guess that's just Otom's thing. Having said that, we enjoyed most of our meal. The highlights were the octopus, the chicken/falafel waffle (VERY filling), and most of all - the graham cracker grits with caramel apples. Delicious!

Combining a recently purchased groupon with their Tuesday night prix fixe, we knew we were maximizing the bang for our buck. Even without the Groupon, the $25 prix fixe on Tuesday is a bargain.  The atmosphere is fantastic. Warm, modern and relaxed with a fireplace and cheery stripes everywhere. The plastic, mod chairs were surprisingly comfortable and I settled in as we ordered drinks. Brave rooster for me and their version of an old fashioned (with bacon-infused bourbon) for my man. Both of us were delighted at the drinks before us. The cilantro smacked me in the face a bit, but the jalapeno infused rum blended nicely. Great start.  Service was great with Tom, our server, giving great recommendations, chatting and checking on us just the right amount.  We both did the prix fixe (since they have the rule that if one person at the table does it, both must do it for ""timing"" purposes). We were willing to spend more money picking and choosing our way through the menu, but many of the prix fixe menu items were calling to us.  We started with the leek soup which was creamy, velvety smooth and a nice contrast to the crispy leeks on top. It was the perfect remedy to the cold rain outside that night.  Next course was a rib eye with blue cheese polenta, braised kale and a pomegranate sauce. Everything was stellar, though the blue cheese polenta wasn't my favorite. The menu said goat cheese which I thought might have been a better, less-obtrusive choice. Still, we had the mac and cheese side added on and were SO happy we did. It was sinfully good, and I like how the menu items stay mostly the same, but their ingredients change slightly with the seasons.  Dessert was a sweet potato pot-de-creme with a spicy molasses cookie. It was the PERFECT blend of creamy and spicy fall goodness. I was stuffed, but managed to finish almost all of it.  Overall, I was very impressed with Otom, though agree that the area is a little sketchy after dark. The food is top notch and a value when you consider how much you get and the quality of ingredients. I'd definitely recommend the Tuesday night $25 prix fixe if you're worried about spending too much. The atmosphere is amazing, very fun but relaxed enough to include PBR on their drink menu.

Drinks were amazing!  I had to stop myself from ordering 10 of their lychee martinis-so light, sweet, and refreshing!  My husband tried the Jack Fizz for his love of gingerale & my love of calamansi juice-a bit too much fizz & not enough jack. On to the good eats...we started with the oyster & pork belly-excellent choice if I do say so myself.  The fried oyster's creamy texture was a perfect pairing with the tender but meaty pork belly.  My husband wanted to order another just after his first bite!  For our main courses, I chose the skirt steak served with potatoes & mushrooms-our waiter asked if medium rare would be ok but I usually take my steak medium-should have listened to the waiter bec my steak was slightly toughter & drier than I would have liked.  The flavor of the steak over a bed of soggy cabbage didn't quite work for me so I had to steal most of my husband's milk braised pork shoulder-tender, flavorful and served with almost a peanut butter like sauce. Sweets...Small dessert list, but how could we resist the chilled chocolate dome?  It cam served with a drizzle of chocolate & broken pieces of pretzel brittle-sweet, but that's about it.

2009-10-14,1.0,"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this site.  We had one of the worst service experiences we've had in the city for along time.  It took forever for our server to offer us a drink and he did so with no emotion.  Acting as if we were bothering him.  After way too long, our drinks arrived with no mention of specials, recommendations on the menu, nothing.  We stopped another server to ask some questions.  We ordered a couple of apps that were amazing so we thought, well at least the food is great, we can get over the horrible service.  Then comes dinner...the wait was crazy, our drinks took forever and finally the chef had to bring out our main course, and honestly I'm surprised she served it.  You could tell my chicken and waffle dish was under the heat lamp too long because there was a glaze over the sauce.  Although the other staff members were trying to help this server it was to no avail.  I would never, ever go back and with all the great places in the city I'd recommend others try somewhere else.",0.5415,0.777,0.119,0.103,0.6210784313725489
2009-10-12,4.0,"Had you told me there is a restaurant in Chicago that serves innovative, non-instructive, down to earth cuisine that can actually fill your stomach, I would have looked at you and said ""get the eff out"". Fancy pants places do not serve filling food. It wouldn't be fancy pants if it serves big portion sizes. Well, slap my ass 'cos I am wrong. You know you are in the midwest when the nuevo places serve big portion sizes. I took the husband here for a celebratory dinner. He is moving on up -- not to the (upper) East Side, this ain't NYC -- and a celebration was in order.  If you have made it this far in this review, and wrote it off as one of my long-winding, self-important, dramatic, less-real-stuff-more-filler (oh shut your trap, I'll eventually get to the point), you are correct!. I will give you the two sentence version: The experience was fantastic. Food, drinks, and service were outstanding, but the desserts need improvement. There you go, see how boring those two sentences are?  The reason I took the man here is because I heard about their cocktail menu. My manservant *coughMattLcough* raved about their cocktail list. He even went on to say it is on par with Violet Hour. Being the gay snob that I am, and add the fact that I married a stereotypical waspy guy from the Hamptons, I never went to Violet Hour. You see, VH is so last century. Been there done that, NYC circa 1998-2000. Did I tell you I am also a highly annoying judgmental jackass? Well, now you know. Anyway, let's get to the review.  The lovely hostess sent us two glasses of champagne (on the restaurant) within a few minutes of being seated. That was a sign of great things to follow.  The cocktail menu is quite interesting. I decided on a Brave Rooster, husband got a Headless Horseman. Both cocktails were divine. I salute the bartender for masking the heat of jalapeno-infused rum in my cocktail with a combination of cilantro, pineapple, and lime. Brilliant, I say! Started off with the oyster and pork belly - balsamic-braised pork belly, fried oysters &amp; mayo mustard sauce. Two deep fried oysters strategically placed atop of braised pork belly cubes. The deep fried oyster provided a crunchy texture to balance the melting of pork belly in my mouth. A total 5 star appetizer. Here is where the midwest part comes in. The pork belly cubes were pretty big and so were the oysters. Not complaining.  Most of the times the husband lets the chef decide on the entree. That's the waspy East Hampton upbringing in him. I, on the other hand, being the control freak that I am, don't let anyone order anything for me. Told you I am annoying, right?  See how hard it is to talk about something that is not about me? Anyway, back to the review.  I got the lamb breast ""coq au vin"". The chef sent an order of their famous chicken and waffles for the husband. Let's just say we ate most of our entrees in silence, because were completely enamored by the food. I finally broke the silence and said ""cookie, do you want to taste this lamb?"" There was barely any left on my plate by then. I did taste the husband's waffles, and the falafel waffle was perfect. Here is another midwest moment. The portion sizes were pretty big. In fact, my lamb was big enough for two people. Their wine list is limited but enticing. The man got a sauvignon blanc and I got a grenache/ syrah to go with my lamb. Perfect accompaniments.  Because my gluttonous self NEEDS dessert, I order the warm chocolate pudding and husband got graham cracker grits served with honey crisp apples, greek yogurt, and oats. I swore off pudding after leaving/ living in London as a wee lad, but I ordered it because it is the only chocolate item on the menu. The pudding was not bad, but not great either. The husband's dessert was a better choice. I was totally going to give this review 5 stars until I remember they only have 3 dessert items (ice cream is not dessert, imo)... and only one chocolate item on the menu. Somewhat disappointing after a great meal. We were offered two glasses of Quinta do Crasto vintage 2002 port to go along with our dessert (again, compliments of the restaurant). The man decided to order another Headless Horseman, because he fell in love with it. This time he requested it as a martini instead of on the rocks, and the bartender gladly obliged. A definite plus in my book when the bartender/ mixologist is not snooty. Otom's website recommends sophisticated casual attire. The 'mos went on fashion full blast and arrived in style. I was channeling the inner Brit from my wee lad years, and the husband looked like he is going to a party in the Hamptons. Let's just say we forgot we are in the midwest. Some people around us were wearing jeans and Affliction shirts. Get out of here people, this is not Enclave. Did I tell you I am also a judgmental jackass? Right! Will definitely go back for cocktails and food, and get dessert elsewhere.  No offense to midwesterners. This is all in good fun.",0.9983,0.804,0.143,0.053,0.5891987388562732

Chicken and waffles (purple yam waffle) are indulgent and good, but not that memorable. The seared octopus with grilled fennel = great. All the food was at least good -- nothing really disappointing. The service, however, was a little strange. Our server was nice and all, but not that attentive. It was Friday night, so the restaurant was somewhat busy, but not so busy as to really hinder a server's ability to attend to tables. The wait between starters and entrees was nearly an hour. I'm actually OK with waiting for good food, but neither the server nor the host came by to update us that it would take a while, and there wasn't much attention regarding drinks or water fill-ups. Another issue is that our server wasn't familiar with serving wine -- she poured way, way too much into each glass, nearly two glasses per one pour! Weird! But she did give us a complimentary glass of port at the end. I'd definitely go again, but hope for a sharper server.

2009-08-30,3.0,"My friends and I decided to try Otom and were a bit disappointed by the food but give 5 stars for the drinks. I had the Scarlet O'Hara which was delicious! To begin with, the entire menu threw us off. There was nothing on the menu that screamed order me... nothing read fantastically appetizing. But we wanted to try this new restaurant. We started off with the ribs with the corn salsa and we also ordered the the gnocchi. The smoked flavored ribs fell off the bone perfectly and the corn salsa was good. However, the gnocchi was too doughy. They also served plain white (possibly weber's) bread with a maple butter spread. It was ok. We didn't order our dinner until maybe 15 to 20 minutes later simply because none of the entrees jumped out at us... only the mac and cheese side did. So the waitress recommended my friend and I to order the lamb shank. YIKES! The presentation made the both of us feel uncomfortable because it was a huge medieval time-style lamb leg with lots of fat sitting in a bowl of fat. I couldn't eat it after I literally had to peel off a thin film of fat to get to the lamb meat. BUH! We didn't think this should have been recommended to us- especially since we aren't huge or anything. Anyways, I traded plates with my fiance who ordered the fish and chips. Both the fish and chips were quite greasy and the paper underneath it was completely soaked with oil. We were very excited to eat the mac and cheese only to be disappointed with the greasiness of it. The four of us left feeling hungry and ended up going to Emmitts Irish Pub on Milwaukee for chicken tenders and potato skins.  We would probably come back for drinks but maybe not dinner.

First off, martini's were fabulous. There were 3 of us, so we each decided to try something different...my favorite was my friend Steph's, the Morning Dew Martini - a layered martini with gin, honeydew-cucumber syrup, watermelon foam and prosciutto powder in the salt on the rim...unbelievable and utterly unique - a must try! My friend compared my citrus martini to a romanian hospital hallway so not much more can be said about that one... lol As for food, the frix prix included a tomato, swiss, and crabcake like salad that was AMAZING, a very rare skirt steak with delicious grilled artichoke and a corn and sweet green tomato salad, and dessert was an apricot french toast with maple syrup whipped cream. All in all. Well lets just say im drooling... The ambiance is perfect for a date or just a girls night out, there are sofas and couches in the front if you want to just go for a martini, and the bartender was one of the friendliest looking people ive ever seen :) The waitstaff was very courteous, and well-mannered...and the gerbera daisies and candles on the table really added to the festive but soothing nature of the place.

2009-08-19,3.0,"What is up with Chicago and all of these adjacent sister restaurants?  Blackbird/Avec, Otom/Moto, Hugos/Gibsons, Pizzeria Uno/Due.  Actually, I guess I kind of like having the less expensive option (when they are less expensive) to the nice place.  Any this sister restaurant was slightly disappointing.  It's not that it was bad, the great dishes were great and that may have really only been one, a cucumber soup, great.  I thought the BLT was fun, but it wasn't necessarily any better than the pork belly I can find down the road at my local okinawan restaurant.   I had the fish, which I actually really really liked.  It was the entire fish, but somehow deboned, which I didn't think about til later and seemed like a task in itself.  It came with the head and all, and the main purpose of serving the head was so that I could access the cheek, and I guess eyeballs if that's your thing.   Anyhow, the worst thing on the menu was the duck.  Inedible in my opinion.  In fact, travelling in the Czech republic I convinced my baby's mama to try duck because she had never had it and I've always enjoyed it here at fancy French restaurants.  Big mistake, she'll never touch duck again. This reminded me of that, so don't try to introduce someone to duck at Otom.  I guess I'd describe it as gamey, actually inedible was a better description. I haven't really gotten into the mixology thing yet.  I'm not generally a fan of fruity drinks and my one experience was meh.  That said that seemed to be there thing, so I tried a couple and they were good.  Even though they weren't overly sweet, they were just sweet enough to only merit one or two.  They were tasty enough to hide whatever potent level of alcohol there was, including absinthe.  Nice touch that the chef came to the table, really enjoyed that.  He popped the cheek out of the dorado for me and mentioned that he picks up his fish daily, so that's probably always a safe bet if you don't mind, or appreciate the presentation.  Disappointingly, he did say that his favorite dish of the day was the duck.

2009-08-06,3.0,"With all the rave reviews I almost feel obligated to give it 4-5 stars, but I'll stick true to my gut. First off, nothing was bad at all. It was a pleasant meal. It's just..nothing was mind blowing either. We went on a tuesday night and ordered a la carte instead of the three course prixe-fixe. It sounded interesting but we wanted to check out all the delicious sounding choices out there.  That night's bread and butter was blackstrap molasses butter with sour dough bread. Butter was pretty tasty. Ordered: 1. potato chip gnocchi -maytag, parmesan tuile, champagne grapes & pine nuts.  - You can definitely taste the potato chip if you eat the gnocchi by itself and let the sauce slowly work away. The sauce was very very thick and heavy. The dish was pretty memorable for all the components and I loved the sauce. However, it was very thick to a fault. 2. pork chop-bacon bread pudding, haricot verts olive caper current sauce. - Very well seasoned pork chop and cooked thoroughly with a slight pinkish tinge in the middle. Bacon bread pudding was a little bit of a downer, it was uninspiring and a little flat.  3. chicken and waffles - purple yam waffle, fried chicken breast, soft boiled egg, gray and okra - Chicken was cooked well and I really liked what remnant of the crispy skin I got because the gravy sauce that came with it softened the fried dough and it just became chunky soft dough. The waffle was pretty tasty with the chicken with a noticeable dab of yam taste, which was delicious. The egg was a nice touch and the okra was a smart play on 'pickles' as it tasted like pickled okra and not slimy at all like you would normally get with okras. However, overall the dish was also very very heavy with the creamy sauce. 4. mac-truffle, bacon & white cheddar : This was a cast iron side and both my husband and my favorite of the evening. The bacon truffle taste just bursts in your mouth and the white cheddar was beautifully laden in and among the elbow macs. It was delicious and heavy. 5. cauliflower - caramelized & creamy  - for cauliflower, it was cooked very well. Not too raw but not too soft so it has that good veggy crunchy texture. Once again, very very heavy on the sauce. For drinks, I ordered a Lychee Martini and my husband got the Go-Kart. This is where they got it perfect. The drinks were delicious and dangerous because I would be able to keep drinking it without knowing how strong it was. Very well done. I have mixed feelings about the service. It was very friendly and our water glasses never dipped below half full. Kudos to that. However, service was also noticeably slow for a dining room about 80% empty. There was one larger party and another couple in the whole place and service was still noticeably slow, which is a little disconcerting. Food was slow to serve and at the end of the meal, plates were slow to be bussed. We usually carry on conversations and give them time, but this was significantly slow. I think they may be understaffed even for a tuesday night.  Overall, food was delicious but uninspiring. Thick and heavy but nothing memorable or wowing. Service was friendly, pleasant, but really slow for the standard of the restaurant. We really wanted to like this place because c'mon, it's OTOM!

2009-07-13,5.0,"I am officially in love with Otom, and by a fluke chance! I hadn't planned to eat here, but that's where I ended up when a friend of mine declared that she ""wasn't impressed by Lula"" (*gasp!*) and therefore did not want to try Nightwood. BUT - I am so happy that it happened because Otom delivered one of the most consistently delicious and wowing meals that I've eaten in Chicago in a long while.  We showed up on a Friday night, with no reservations and feeling slightly under-dressed, but neither of those things proved to be a problem, as we were promptly seated with a smile. I took a look through their drink menu, that included a ton of interesting things that I've never heard of, and settled on the blackberry fizz, since I've had a thing for bubbly things with fresh fruit lately. It was light, slightly sweet, and just the right type of refreshment on a hot and humid summer evening.  We started out with the blt - caramel braised bacon, smoked tomato jam, romaine puree. The bacon was more like a slab of thick, real bacon, including the ""back fat"" (I don't know the real name), and was so tender, juicy, and smokey salty sweet. It reminded me more of some corned beef that's been stewing all day long, the way that it fell apart with a fork and knife. I can't tell you much about the romaine puree cause I couldn't really taste it in combination with everything else. The tomato jam was great, as was the light, airy toasted brioche?, and chunks of what appeared to be mayo, but what remained a mystery to me. At any rate - it was great, and a perfect way to get the meal started.  For my entree, I ordered the skirt steak. At first, I was a little hesitant to order it, given it's such a plan and easy cut of beef, but those feeling flew out the window as soon as it hit my tongue. It was perfectly tender and seasoned in a way that brought me back to my mom's kitchen and the way that she used to serve steak. Simple - salt, pepper, and maybe a little bit of olive oil. It was accompanied by an heirloom tomato panzanella. I've never tried panzanella before, I just knew that it was some tomato, bread, and basil. Man, so simple, yet such a flavor explosion! As soon as I bit into one of the tomatoes, my brain was asking ""Is it August if the tomatoes are this delicious?"" No my friend, Otom just knows a good supplier of great produce! The cucumbers added just the right touch of cool and crunchy, and the bread was perfectly toasted and dry to the wet of the other components of the salad. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles. I'm not a fan of chicken, but I did have a piece of the waffle, purple yam waffle, to be exact, and it was seriously THE best waffle I've ever tasted! It was so crisp on the outside, and airy on the inside, with just a touch of sweetness from the yam. Now if only I had a waffle iron and the recipe...  And of course, even though I had hit the food limit, I went ahead and ordered dessert. I had the chilled chocolate dome, which was filled with peanut butter nougat, and accompanied by chicory caramel, pretzel brittle, and cream soda fluff. The fluff was a bit like a melty marshmallow consistency next to the hard chocolate dome and the pretzel brittle. Perfect combinations of salty and sweet happening on my plate, and don't even get me started on the chicory caramel...I wanted to lick that right off of my plate!  Our ""official"" waiter was a bit of a deadbeat, only appearing to take our orders and present us with the check. But, other characters, including the bartender and hostess filled in and really made up for where he was lacking, so I'm not going to complain. All in all, it was a great dinner, and something that I will be thinking about for a while. I'm dying to go back and try more.

2009-06-22,5.0,"When you first arrive at otom you may wonder where the heck it's at. Located in the middle of the Fulton Market area I wasn't sure if I was going to be eating in a shipping dock or not. However, once I saw the fun large windows of moto and otom next to each other I realized I was in the right place. The decor is very fun with bright colors and an emphasis on orange. I was celebrating my birthday and they must have been tipped off as we were presented with complimentary champagne as we sat down (always a great start). As I'm part Irish and part Polish, one drink wouldn't suffice so I also ordered a cocktail, The Thai Boxer. I can't recall if the vodka was flavored but it contained coconut liqueur and a syringe filled with some curry that you squeezed in and stirred. It's always fun to play with food. My fiancee ordered the Blackberry Fizz and there were so many flavors going on when I took a sip there's no way I could explain beyond ""great"". We started with an order of the grilled octopus and I thought it was amazing. A nice smoky flavor and it's accompanied with a slice of toasted bread and a sweet jam that adds a fun flavor. My fiancee ordered the skirt steak that melted in your mouth and was paired with a bread salad. I ordered their chicken and waffles which was amazing. The waffle was made from yam, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the included hard boiled egg and ocrah made the dish divine. We also enjoyed a side of the truffle oil mac-n-cheese that I could've eaten a whole bowl of myself. We finished with the chilled chocolate dome for dessert. Chilled chocolate mousse filled with peanut butter drizzled with some cream soda infused marshmallow fluff and peanut brittle pieces. You may now commence drooling.

2009-06-08,2.0,"I really have to wonder if I entered the same restaurant that I have been hearing rave reviews about for the past year.  Honestly, if someone told me that I had somehow entered an alternate universe of mediocre food and substandard service I would believe them.  How could this famed, ""amazing"" restaurant be such a disappointment? Hmmm. Where to start after walking into the vortex that was my Otom experience? Our server was boring, void of personality and uninformed about the menu.  I'm not talking the fine-dining-overly-pretentious-server; I'm talking about the probably-on-summer-break-from-college-hung-over-did-not-want-to-be-there-server.  No description of the menu, unable to make recommendations of food or wine and when it came wishing the birthday girl a happy birthday he looked around the table and dully said ""it's someone birthday right? They get a free dessert"".  It is not that the food was bad, it just was nothing.  Nothing was a standout, nothing tasted great.  I actually don't think that plates were even finished. Where was the mind blowing flavors, fresh ingredients and personality I had expected from such a Chicago standout?  The true disappointments? The pepperoni mussels; not a good flavor combo and undercooked. The braised short rib; fatty and cold.  My favorite? The barbequed brussel sprout side dish and the cinnamon sorbet. Ok, but there was an upside to Alternate-Universe-Otom and his name was Greg.  The bartender was the reason that the entire evening was not a complete flop (that and the great company of course!).  Otom's Violet Hour-esque cocktails were as amazing as we expected the rest of the night to be.  I had the Basil Collins; what a refreshing combination of basil syrup, gin and lemon juice.  I loved it.  In addition to my cocktail everyone else loved their selections as well.  The Corn n'Oil, Clairvoyance, and the Brave Rooster were all hits with the group.  Even more interesting than the drink was the bartender's friendliness and excitement to explain the concoctions and the history, flavor and details of ingredients with which we were unfamiliar; mezcal, white whisky, root beer bitters and chartreuse.(He was happy to let us sample them as well!) Will I come back?  Yes, but just for drinks at the bar.  Again, it was not a terrible night; just not the fabulous one I had expected and I see no reason to diner her in the future, with my luck I will end up walking into the same alternate universe of boring food and dull service.",0.9915,0.771,0.154,0.074,0.5775996112730806
2009-06-08,2.0,"""Oft expectation fails, and most oft there  where most it promises; and oft it hits  where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.""  -William Shakespeare, All's Well That Ends Well (II, i, 145-147)  Now before you all go thinking, ""Wow- this Reuben character is well-read and can quote Shakespeare,"" I need to say that I am quick to admit that I am a bit too slow to follow and ""get"" all of this famous bard's prose.  For he is crafty with words in a way which I fail.  However, to simply have me use my plebeian wordsmith skills to state that ""I was very disappointed in my meal at Otom,"" would be unbefitting my true feelings.  Even this only begins to define my experience- but I shall continue to try to build a better story for you of why my bitter feelings for this place are strong like bull.  First, the good: and this will be kept short and to the point. Come here for the drinks. The cocktails are fresh and lively, and really started the evening off well. I would seriously consider coming back here just for a cocktail before heading to dinner elsewhere- that is how good the drinks were.  Now the bad... Let me preface it by saying I have been looking forward to eating here for quite a while.  The food was just plain ""blah."" There was nothing that popped, pleasantly surprised, or excited me. The food just was pretty basic while missing that unique twist, or flavor profile, presentation and execution that I was looking for.  It isn't that the food was bad- because looking back on it, it wasn't all bad. It just wasn't any where near the quality expected for the price. This was the ultimate disappointment in my opinion.  Starters:  Crab cakes- somewhat mushy discs with a pretty basic sauce accompaniment. Mussels- pretty basic execution. What I am used to at places that charge much less. BLT- interesting concept with the pureed romaine and the tomatoes being smoked and in a jam, but in terms of taste- there was blandness all around.  I didn't get to try the gnocchi because I think the party of six that I was with knew that this was the only thing that was really worth eating. It came and went rather quickly.  Main Courses:  Beef Short Ribs- this, unfortunately for all of us, was a huge let down. I, along with the birthday girl of the group, ordered this item and looking back on it, I should have known better. It was paired with winter vegetables... We ate there in early June... I realize that early June is just about the beginning of winter down in the southern hemisphere- but this is not a good reason to have it be on the menu. Oddly enough, the winter veggies were OK. It was the short-rib that was inexcusable.  At this point in the meal, I would say that I couldn't have any major complaints other than the server being aloof and somewhat cold to our group (at one point asking the busboy which wine to suggest someone in our party). The aps were fine- nothing great, just OK. But this short-rib dish was unforgivable.  Coming out lukewarm, I should have sent it back- but with the other five in my group already eating, I guess I felt a sense of needing to trudge on. I wouldn't think to cut into my short-rib all the way- instead wanting to cut off piece by piece to eat it. I noticed a lump of fat on one side of the hunk of short-rib that turned into almost the rest of the piece. I would say that before I could even realize it- the piece that was given to me was probably at least 70% pure fat.  I am not one to complain about fat in my meat. I love my steak highly marbled. I enjoy the cuts of any meat that has hunks of fat laced throughout- but this was just too much.  As I said- at this point, I was already finishing up my dish- and shame on me for not pointing this out to the server. I blame myself for that.  Along with my main course of fat served with out-of-season vegetables was a cast iron serving of ""mac."" To their credit- they did follow the title of this item quite literally because there wasn't much cheese to go with it. Instead of that hefty helping of gooey, melted and creamy cheese, I was served a tiny cast-iron pan of macaroni in a pool of truffle oil. It looked like straight-up grease.  With all that truffle oil being used I can't even imagine the food cost of this item alone. WAY TOO MUCH truffle oil, and it ruined what would have been a pretty tasty thing.  Dessert was so forgettable I have already forgotten what I had. I just remember it tasted, once again, like it should have been served around six months prior/from when I had it. It probably would be pretty good on a winter evening.  I hate being disappointed, but the lowly nature of my existence tends to draw me towards blaming myself through disappointment. I was raised to be pessimistic, and therefore if I expect the worst, and it isn't so bad- I then in turn am happy.  Too bad I didn't follow my parents' advice with my trip to Otom.

2009-06-07,2.0,"""Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed."" (Jonathan Swift) Well I expected a lot and unfortunately for me, was bitterly disappointed. Otom, you didn't win me over. I would even say that you lost me over, and over again. Would it be a bar, Otom would have gotten from me a stellar 5. Greg concocted for our party of 6 wonderful drinks. Inventive, refreshing and perfectly executed - with unexpected ingredients borrowed from the kitchen's herb garden. I got the Basil Collins to open up the festivities (all green from its fresh basil syrup) but my favorite of the night was the Brave Rooster: Jalapeno-infused 10Cane rum, muddled cilantro, pineapple syrup, lime - perfection in a glass. If only it had followed to our plates.... But we were not to be so lucky. We tried a lot of what Otom has to offer.  6 of us, eager to eat, eager to share - we ransacked the appetizer menu and ordered pretty much everything available. Underwhelming first bites. Very fatty B(LT), forgettable crab cakes, bland mussels....no depth of flavors despite the seemingly interesting ingredients displayed on paper. The gnocchi and the tomato soup were the winners but nothing wowed me. We were still hopeful entering the second round. You know - it is always awkward to feel defeated before the end. You don't want to be a quitter. So we kept holding on, smiling, not voicing our concerns, just babbling away while our dull and seemingly lifeless waiter was occasionally checking on us. The worst was yet to come. Once again - we sampled pretty much the whole range of offerings. I was shocked to see, on June 5th that the ""beef short rib-noodles, winter vegetables & chèvre"" was actually on the menu.  I thought that the website was just not up-to-date. Boy was I wrong. Correct me if I am misguided - but a restaurant which takes pride in ""providing an unforgettable dining experience"" should really work with the freshest, most in-season ingredients.  It is what I do in my kitchen. It just makes sense. It was an anomaly on the menu. It was a mistake to order it. The piece of meat that was delivered to my husband hardly deserved the name of ""meat"". 80% fat and gelatin - it was a poor excuse for short ribs. I would have sent it back. Reuben being the polite and well-behaved man he is settled down for it. Two days later he is still sick. And very unfortunately, he was not the only one..... My lamb was quite good though despite uninspiring accompaniments.  The side dish of mac, bacon and cheese was so soaked with truffle oil that we couldn't finish it. Zero all the way. A selection of four desserts - among which a very flat and once again off-season apple crumble. None of them rekindled my long gone interest. We left unhappy but  enlightened one last time by the magic of Greg. A bar tender shouldn't be the highlight of a restaurant. I would be Dennis Rodman, or Zinedine Zidane I would have head-butted someone. Good thing that I am a ""civilized"" French gal. Adieu, Otom.",0.9811,0.757,0.142,0.101,0.575191372247824

2009-05-04,2.0,"Décor: Very cool open expansive space. I loved the drapes and the striped theme. The orange plastic chairs were cool. We loved the long orange bar table flanked by a large orange shadow box with fresh orange gerber daisies. Staff: The maitre was pitch perfect. He oozed professionalism. Well groomed, polite, commanding and efficient. The table assistants were also polite and efficient. We were extremely disappointed with the server. When we arrived we were greeted and seated promptly by a very professional maitre d'. At the time there were only two other tables in the restaurant but it was several minutes before our server acknowledged us by dropping the drink menus at the table. She returned after a few minutes and took our drink orders. We began to peruse the menu and had several questions. After a few minutes the waitress literally did a drive by with our drinks. She served us and ran. She did not ask if we had any questions about the menu nor if we were ready to order. After quite some time she returned and said ""Are you ready to order?"" in a tone that implied we should be. When I told her we had some questions regarding the menu she seemed ambivalent to answering our questions. In fact ambivalent is pretty much the best word to describe our server. She never checked back to check on our drinks or our appetizers. She did check back on our entrées though. Throughout the meal she remained pretty cold and aloof and we never really felt welcome.  Food:  Appetizer: Rib - Excellent ribs, while they did not yield much meat the meat was heavenly. It literally tasted as though we were eating bacon off the bone. The honey drizzled had a spicyness too it that hit the right notes and the slaw that came with was the perfect companion. Entrées: Pork Chop - Large boneless pork chop served with bacon and sage dumpling, red cabbage & apples. The pork chop was underseasoned  and although the meat was done to medium somehow it still managed to taste dry and over cooked. I was hoping for a nice seared crust on the meat as well but was fairly disappointed. The bacon and sage dumplings were incredible, they were creamy, and well seasoned. The red cabbage and apples were tart and sweet and the perfect contrast to the rich creamy dumplings.  Cod - Nicely breaded cod piece. The cod was tender and moist. The panko bread crumbs stood up to the fish well and the tartar sauce was excellent. The fries we underseasoned and a bit bland. Mac and Cheese - Bad consistency, was not creamy at all. Large amount of clumped cheese not well distributed throughout. The noodles were not cooked to al dente, they were underdone to the point we didn't really eat the side. Beverages: Kumquat Daiquiri - I could see myself drinking these on a tropical beach some place. Tart and refreshing. The wine list was sparse but they did carry a nice Argentinian Merlot. Parking: I would suggest taking a cab.  Pointers: Don't take your Discover card, they don't accept it. Also be prepared for the terrible stench of this neighborhood. While not the restaurants fault it does add to our less than pleasant experience. We would not return to this restaurant.

That BLT app is no joke - a very delicious and creative way to present a classic. I highly recommend giving this a try! The pacing of the courses was also impeccable - after our starters were over we had just enough time to sip on cocktails, chat, and start craving the main event.  The salt & vinegar encrusted cod was my choice and it was great. A salty dish for sure, but the mildness of the fish balanced the dish quite well. It was served with some croquettes that were simply melt in your mouth fantastic.  As we finished our entrees, we were offered some delicious dessert options, but with the amount of food we were presented with we simply could not eat another bite.

One bottle of wine, one shared appetizer, one shared entree. Let's start with service and attitude - all great. No hassle on splitting our dishes, in fact they served each course already divided into separate dishes. Not many places bother with that. We wanted to enjoy our wine a bit before eating - no problem, no rush. The place was quiet when we were there, but the service went beyond just keeping up with us. It was down right excellent.  The wine list had a good variety and we enjoyed a standard white Cote d'Rhone. We shared the mixed green salad: bosc pears, candied walnuts, Maytag blue cheese & balsamic vinaigrette. Awesome, great balance. Then we shared the BBQ pork belly, with smoked bread, spicy chard & pork-beans. Their menu description really understate what this is. It's a nice piece of pork belly, presented toward one end of the plate, a similar-size thick cube of a special smoked hard-toasted bread with a sauce on it at the other end, with a line of specially prepared and very tasty beans fencing off the two.

First they served soft little bread slices with a wonderfully aromatic truffle-infused butter.  Later, when the main dishes were on the table, I could still smell the truffle butter from the dish a few feet away.   I started with the oxtail stew, which was strangely sweet, but I loved it anyway.  My entree was the sirloin ravioli, with saffron-parsnip puree, crimini mushrooms (subbing that night for the usual trumpet royale), and olive oil powder.  How on earth you can make powder out of olive oil escapes me, but that was a neat touch.  The raviolis were not heavy although they were generously stuffed full of meat.  The wrapper was somewhere between a traditional pasta ravioli and a puff pastry shell.   My favorite part of the meal was my side:  the winter root vegetable hash with chorizo and manchego.  More meat!  (To be honest, I left a few of the chorizo coins in the bottom of the crock.)  The flavor of this dish was simple but amazing.  I wish that I could eat a big bowl of this stuff with some crusty bread once a week for the rest of my life...at least, in cold weather.   By then I was full, but I almost never miss dessert.  This is probably the weakest part of the menu, but there are still some compelling choices.  I ended up with the Cookies and Milk--mascarpone, caramel, bananas, and vanilla ice cream all complimenting two cracker-thin cookies with big chocolate dots.  I wanted to see how they would approach something with such traditional, straightforward ingredients...and they did it pretty straightforwardly.  Strictly speaking, yes I was disappointed, but it still tasted good.  It just didn't measure up to the quality and creativity of the rest of the food.  Penny had a trio of homemade ice creams (cheesecake, pistachio, and chocolate sorbet) which were interesting. One final note:  The orange chairs are a serious design error.  The brick walls and light wood floors do not complement the South Beach motif that they seem to have chosen, but I feel that the overall aesthetic could work if they just got rid of those ridiculous chairs.  Actually, they aren't uncomfortable, but...they are orange plastic chairs.",0.9987,0.784,0.176,0.04,0.4876507936507937
2009-02-24,4.0,"I've been having a philosophical, almost epistemological argument with myself after eating at Otom: Should the interior of a restaurant affect the food itself? The jury is still out, lucky for Otom's sake.  I'll say this then shut up about it and get to the food, which is really why we're here. Imagine if you will, Ikea and CB2 go on a blind date. They get drunk beforehand, pick up Miami then hit the bar for more drinks to quell their blind date jitters. Before they know it, the three of them are in the backseat of a pink 1987 Mitsubishi minivan and clumsily going at it like teenagers. Whoops, a few months later it seems that CB2 has given birth to Otom. Plastic orange sherbet-colored chairs, cliche yellow Gerber daisies, and the ultimate sin, Voss water bottles inexplicably filled with colored water set on top of the glass rack of the bar - because you know, when you have a multicolored environment more random insertions of color is a wise design move. Why oh why couldn't the whole place have the dignity and class of the decor of the restrooms? You know it's a sad state when the loo is nicer to look at than your eating space. Ok now that we have that out of the way: the eats! A big thank you to all of you that reviewed the BLT appetizer, it was everything I'd hoped and dreamed. Each element was a bit bland on its own but together, the dish sang an aria to my taste buds. My dining companion had the oxtail stew which was a rainy November day under a blanket with a movie on, in a bowl. They nail the ""comfort food"" angle, to be sure. Our mains were monk fish, which was good but not amazing though the lemon/caper semi solid (think really soft jello meant to melt on the fish) was a very ""moto/otom"" touch, and the beef tenderloin raviolis which were delicious. I remember thinking that one bite had a pot pie sort of feeling to it, the ravioli was very light and the meat was tender and delicious.  For sides we got the mac and cheese (good but we both agreed too much onions and too much meat which I think was pork - and you know I never say ""too much pork""), and the roasted root veggies with meat circles. Good, but not fantastic. Dessert, as so often happens with higher end restaurants it seems, wasn't exactly cohesive with the rest of the meal. I opted for three scoops of the house-made ice cream, cheesecake, pistachio (the best) and a chocolate sorbet. All delicious, a perfect cap to my meal. David's dessert was the ""cookies and milk"" which looked like two enormous flat chocolate chip cookies (but were very thin wafers), marscapone and ice cream. Good, but not stellar.  Otom didn't make it into my top 5 list, and I don't think the decor mattered in that case, but it was an interesting experience. Our server was very pleasant and was spot on with her wine recommendation, and I would happily return for the cocktails, which were fantastic.",0.9945,0.818,0.137,0.046,0.5809979423868312

2009-02-23,2.0,"Date Visited: February 14 People: Megan My tab: ~$95 Slow service. Maybe that can be chalked up to valentine's day,  but this place had a bunch of other flaws. Megan thought our our server was a bit too under the weather to be serving food to anyone. Whoever told me this west loop location is anything like NY's meatpacking district must have been drunk on Honker Ale. The atmosphere inside had a strangely norwegian feel too it, something I found a bit odd. Butter with the bread had way too much garlic in it, and I didn't really think that was even possible. Cocktails were not worth all the hype, and look awful because they  all come in a half filled, non-descript, plain juice glass. I had a boubon gingerade which was fair, I would have ordered another drink had our server been available. As a starter I had the oxtail stew, which was in fact pretty good, but didn't exactly fit the vibe of this clean, modern restaurant. Megan had a very good deconstructed BLT which was the highligh of the meal, highly recommended. Our entrees had a single common theme...they both included 1 or 2 ingredients more than they probably needede. I had a pretty decent salt and vinegar chip crusted cod with bacala puree and a cayenne pepper glace, which was unnessesary. There seemed to be a number of different flavors so I requested help from the somallier about what to drink with it. Rather than getting him/her for me, my server suggested the cab...something that didn't seem to make any sense to me but i trusted her. She was wrong. Megan had the crispy chicken thigh which was superb...except it didn't have a crispy chicken skin at all. Again, a little to much buerr blanc that went along with an otherwise tasty wafflebread pudding and apple stuff. Dessert was called milk and cookies, and was not what i expected. it included 2 huge, wafer thin cookies with giant chocolate chunks in it...like a cartoon of a cookie. The carmel banana and vanilla ice cream that came with it was good, but it also came with a huge hunk of mascapone, which didn't work at all. I hate to knock this place because there were parts of this meal I really loved, but there are too many flaws in every aspect of dining for me to truly recommnd this place.",0.9868,0.804,0.135,0.062,0.6047562358276642
2009-02-18,5.0,"""Look at all the meat trucks!"" exclaims the wide-eyed girl from Machesney Park, Illinois. ""I guess this really IS the meat-packing district.""  Needless to say, this was my first foray into the meat-packing district in Chicago. So I figured, let's ""meat"" it out for dinner, right?  My sweet Valentine got reservations for us, and we were warmly greeted upon arrival. No aura of pretension whatsoever, which I just adored. Lots of times, I am reduced to my ""from Machesney Park"" self and feel like I don't belong in overly sophisticated urban environments. Fortunate for Otom, they made sure that feeling never settled in.  The service was extraordinary. A Bourbon Gingerade for the mister almost made me decide I like bourbon and a glass of cava for me (hey, I like my bubbles) got our dinner off to a splendid start.  We split the BLT appetizer, which was divine. Who would have thought I'd think lettuce and tomato puree could accentuate white toast and what is clearly the largest chunk of bacon in existence. Heavenly.  I enjoyed the BBQ pork belly, which was tender, flavorful and delicious. Served with some spicy chard on top of crusty bread and ""pork beans,"" which were literally chunks of pork shaped like beans, it was as meaty as this 'hood promised.  My boyfriend had the cod crusted with salt and vinegar potato chips. Brilliant. Flaky and not in the least bit fishy, the chips added that special kick to make this dish truly special.  For sides, we couldn't decide, so we split the mac 'n cheese and the sweet potatoes. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac 'n cheese. It just was kinda bland to me, compared to all the wonderful flavors in the rest of the dishes. But the sweet potatoes (with cocoa marshmallows, be still, my chocolate-loving heart) were divine.  For dessert, we shared the chocolate tart (on special) served with coconut sorbet and candied kumquats. Wonderful. Along with a hefty portion of some cheesecake ice cream, our sweet dreams were fulfilled.  Our server asked about transportation and made sure we had a cab. A friendly goodbye from the hostesses as we left put smiles on our faces.  Not for a second did I feel out of place at this marvelous restaurant. As we waited for our cab to arrive in the crisp and chill February air, we noticed something.  ""Smells like meat out here,"" the now sophisticated, culinarily-spoiled girl says as she walks outside.

2009-02-01,4.0,"THE REVIEW Otom is Moto's downscale eatery located next door.  The restaurant has a colorful retro hipster vibe. The color orange is serendipitously scattered throughout the decor. The chairs and tables are modern. There are high ceilings and hardwood floors. The servers are friendly and professional. I treated some friends to dinner last night. We had an awesome time. Unlike dysfunctional ""siblings"" Avec and Blackbird (read my Blackbird review), Otom and Moto get along just fine.  Moto uses his nerdy talents to impress food critics while Otom uses his geeky-ness to score with the hipsters. The food at Otom is just as playful as it is at Moto. The main difference is the cost and the experience. Otom serves comfort food and American classics. While the food is still intellectual in its approach, it never takes a backseat to the science of the cooking (as it does at Moto). So Otom functions very much like a normal restuarant experience. The food is excellent.  Broccoli Cheddar Soup was a velvety puree of the humble vegetable served with perfectly square toasted buttery croutons; simple and elegantly presented. BLT. This dish is food porn at its best. You get a square hunk of braised smoked bacon on top of toasted Brioche. There is a vivid green Lettuce vinaigrette on the plate. I devoured it like a ravenous beast. Oxtail Soup is presented very plainly as a hearty bowl of Oxtail ragout. The braising liquid is saturated with natural gelatine from the Oxtail bones giving an intense earthy and meaty flavor. Dee-Lish! Braised Sirloin Ravioli was one of the best things we had. It's expensive for what you get. $27 gets you 3 plump pieces of crispy puffed ravioli. $9 a piece is steep, but totally worth the first bite. The pasta is crispy almost like a wonton made out of puff pastry. The filling is made of pulled sirloin meat (like pulled pork). As soon as we all cut into the ravioli, a pocket of steam released. Crispy outside and piping hot meat filling. Heavenly. We ordered this as a middle course; it's a main course. Pork and Beans. It's a play on Frank and Beans. You get collard greens, white beans, and Pork Belly. I didn't get a chance to taste this, but my friend practically inhaled it! It's a generous serving of two blocks of pork belly. Crispy Chicken with Crispy waffle-bread pudding, green apple chutney, and maple beurre blanc. This was the dish that I ordered. It tasted fine, but it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I was hoping for a Kentucky-Fried chicken or something like that.  Braised Short Rib with chilaquiles. This was by far the most appealing dish in both appearance and serving size. You get a gigantic piece of decadent short-rib. I was so sad that i hadn't ordered the short rib instead---like the Budweiser dude that cries when a full ice cold beer shatters on the ground.  TV Dinner: Country Fried Duck confit leg with carrot edamame pie, parsnip gravy, and stuffing. On paper, it sounds good. In practice, it was a mess. This dish was the least successful; way too overthought. The edamame and carrot pie was tasty (a play on Shepherd's Pie). The best part is that they serve the main course in an aluminum tray resembling a TV dinner. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to expectations. As a result, the leftover food on the plate resembled Prison Chow more than TV Dinner. Ouch. Two people shared the Mac n' Cheese. They loved it. I was too full to sample. We ordered a bottle of wine and each had wine pairings with our main course. We shared a Pumpkin Flan with Brown Butter Ice Cream. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but the flan had great Pumpkin flavor.  The total came under $400 with 10% tax and 20% pre-tax tip. Not cheap, but we ordered 4 starters, 6 main courses, one side dish, one dessert, one bottle of white wine, and 4 glasses of red wine. More importantly, we had so much fun.

The chairs, while appearing out of place are not the uncomfortable messes one would think and faded into the background of the rest of the meal. If you go here, you simply MUST have the black pepper pasta appetizer.  Make sure you have some fresh bread served when it arrives so that you can use the bread to soak up the leftover truffle sauce.  The sauce is absolutely unreal. The chicken with the smoked applesauce is amazing as well.  The braised short rib, while good and interesting, was nothing out of this world. Milk and cookies dessert was a visual treat and the ice cream served with it is amazing as well. If you come for dinner, you absolutely need to have a cocktail--do not bother with wine, which, while they have a nice selection, does not have the same creative flair that the cocktails do.  I had the Fig something-or-other with Absinthe and it was one of the most unique-tasting drinks I've ever had.

The short rib was incredibly tender and good, but the sauces and chilaquiles on the side seemed to miss the mark somehow.  We got the cookies and milk for dessert, which was cute, but was more like ultra thin wafers than cookies.

There was nothing wrong with the meal and the food was great, but there's just something holding me back from that extra star and I don't know what it is.  I had requested a specific section of the restaurant and very quickly after the host realized he sat us in the wrong section, he came back to correct that, which I thought was nice.   I would say its inventive comfort food, we started with the Mac and Cheese and that was fantastic, its brought out it in the iron pan thing it was cooked in, cool way of presenting it. It had leeks and mushrooms which was unexpected but very good. Then we had the salt and vinegar crusted cod which was excellent. The only other thing we had wasn't that great, it was the Braised Beef Sirloin Ravioli, the puree that came with it was very good, but the ravioli was a little bland and for some reason the texture of braised beef in a ravioli seemed a bit odd.  The decor of the restaurant is very cool, it has that hip minimalist vibe without being cold. They were able to maintain a warm inviting feel to the restaurant.  Service was excellent, they did a great job of explaining the menu, offering suggestions and wine pairing.

2008-12-14,5.0,"This place is definitely one of my absolute new favorite restaurants. My family was in town from LA and they've seen Moto on the Food Network and wanted to check out the whole intergalactic cuisine. I looked into it and although I really wanted to check out the hype of molecular gastronomy (especially after seeing the little exhibit on Chef Homaro Cantu at the Museum of Science & Industry). However, Moto was way out of my price range. So we opted for the cheaper sister restaurant Otom, next door.  The food here is innovative, whimsy, and absolutely delicious! We were so impressed with everything here, from the service to the extremely flavorful food. The cocktails were even creative and some of the drink ingredients include egg whites and curry. The bread was tasty and the pablano/corriander butter spread was great. We started with mini house Cesar salads served individually on spoons. I'm not going to lie- I wish I had a whole bowl of this salad instead of just one spoonful.  For appetizers we sampled the BLT, braised swordfish, and salmon sushi roll. The butter fish soup with collard greens was tasty and had a very miso soup type flavor. The salmon sushi roll was served quite different than your typical maki roll and was instead served on puff rice and rolled with nori. But the best appetizer was the BLT (caramel braised bacon, romaine puree, heirloom tomato jam & white bread). It was amazing! The BLT consisted of a thick, juicy piece of sweet bacon on top of a toasted piece of white bread with tomato jam. This was the best BLT you'll ever have in your life.  For my entree I ordered the Crispy Chicken Thigh (crispy skin, waffle-bread pudding, smoked applesauce & maple beurre blanc).

Next I've got to say that the Mixologist was super knowledgable.  There are drinks on the cocktail list that include Absinthe and we wanted to know all about it.  Know all about it we did when this dude (GEEZ I wish I remembered his name because he deserves some serious credit).   One of my co-workers spent about 10 minutes watching him make drinks.  He's very, very serious about the process and tastes the concoction with the end of a clean straw at every interim step.

I pondered...even put off the penning of this review for an incubation period of 12 hours to decide.  I am here to tell you, YES. The stars aligned last night at Otom...5 of them.  1. Service: Our server was impeccable, friendly without a twinge of overbearing, sweet, subtle and made excellent recs to boot. Well done.  2. Location: After a cocktail event at the Victor Hotel, my gal pal and I were in need of some ""sobering."" Otom appeared, as a mirage in the meat-packing dessert wasteland. Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration...there are a lot of cool spots in this little nook, but it smells heavily of butchered swine. I suggest eating indoors for the faint of stomach... 3. Decor. Sleek, albeit welcoming and comfortable. Warm colors (orange, mmmm), understated finishes while still remaining very classy and high end. Our table was dangerously tippy, perhaps the ONLY downfall of the evening. (and really, I'm not complaining...it's just the only thing that marred the experience, and I'm sure if we had asked for another table, they would've gladly obliged.) 4. THE FOOD. mmmmmm. My friend and I both savored the appetizer BLT. A phenom in its own right, absolutely. The chunk of bacon was well worth the $13 price tag, and was accompanied by a pureed romaine, and heirloom tomato jam. I get all giddy just thinking about it, actually. The mushroom soup was also quite good, although cooled quickly into more of a paste. The temperature was a bit off, though it was still lovely, with an egg on top...beautiful presentation all around.  5. The coffee. I know, so random...but it was just so good. Fresh brewed, and served to me BEFORE dinner, throughout dinner, after dinner. The perfect key to staying alert the rest of the evening... My only regret is not ordering dessert...we didn't even hear of them, the check just arrived. We were thankful on one hand, as our bellies were pleasantly full of fantastic fare, but I would've liked to perhaps splurge...oh well, next time.

Service - mediocre.  Why do they dress their servers in ""Best-buy"" uniforms?  hmm.  Strange for a wanna-be swanky place.  Our server was at first attentive but eventually turned into pushy and annoying.  Wasn't familar with the menu or even the wine list .  ""We'll have a bottle of the tempranillo...""  -  Her: ""Um, ok, is that on the wine list?""  Seriously. And don't bring out a bottle of wine, open and serve it to a table of 6 and THEN tell you that is the only one they have.  Sheesh. Ok, and I'm all for bread and the yummy chive butter but they literally came by to refill bread at least a half a dozen times!   Should have seen the small portions coming. Food- just OK.   spinach salad - excellent mac & cheese was cold BLT was  scary lump of lard Mussels w/ coconut sauce - BARELY lukewarm Salmon ceviche - tasty but WARM, yeck Lamb entree - tasty but a bit dry Beef tenderloin - yummy and my favorite Short rib ravioli - dried out, very small portions, lacking a contrasting sauce/flavor Chicken tv dinner - just weird.  cute metal looking tv tray plate but the food looked better on the tray then in my belly Cod - was dry, and amazingly small The coconut  cake dessert was done quite well.   Actually, the dessert portions were well in excess of entree sizes.  Go figure again. To me, the menu wasn't even appealing, poorly described food that actually didnt' make much of it SOUND appetizing. Final bill was $100/person.  I should have eaten more bread. Unfortunately Otom has fallen into that group of Chicago eateries that are trying way too hard to be ...  I dunno - Hollywood or something.   I will not be returning, especially after the final taste left in my mouth was the aroma of the meat packing facility across the street as we waited for our car.  egh.",0.9826,0.78,0.14,0.08,0.6427333333333336

Knowing that the concept is to deliver the unexpected, I scoured the menu for the items that sounded the most eclectic.  This was prob my big mistake. The ""cereal"" app is supposed to reflect mac-n-cheese.  The over-cooked, freeze dried shell pasta resemble Bugles, but there is no taste.  The stout cheddar milk is also very tasteless.  Lastly, the chunks of corned beef are good.  But, together this does not taste anything like mac-n-cheese.  And, to quote my friend, ""it's a long way for a ham sandwich.""  The waiter asked what I thought of the dish, my response: I think not.  Our friends got the salmon ceviche and were pleased. For my entree, I was feeling adventurous and decided to try the TV dinner...the waiter said the chef would be excited b/c it was his fav dish to display his talents.  It was so horrible that our table of four was laughing and joking the rest of the night about it.  Nothing on the 'ever-so-cute divided metal plate' worked.  The others at the table ordered (from worst to best): fried short rib ravioli (deep fried - yick); BBQ pork belly(good, but the accompaniments were odd); Duck (actually, this was pretty good). So, we walked away thinking that we could have saved a lot of money by going elsewhere.  And, our advice, if you decide to try OTOM...order what sounds boring, it's your safest bet.",0.9853,0.72,0.194,0.087,0.6186781609195403
2008-08-07,5.0,"Ok, so I didn't want to review this place after the first time I went there, because I had such an incredible experience that I thought that it could not be reproduced again. I was wrong. Otom is *incredible* to the max.  Despite the unfortunate lack of creativity in the name (it's owned by the same people who run ""Moto"" next door), that is basically the only negative I can possibly come up with. The drinks:  The bartender is in charge of designing his own drinks and he proved himself as a creative genius with no bounds.  Every specialty drink on the menu was a magnificent masterpiece -- so the drinks here are not to be missed.  In fact, skip the wine altogether, but don't miss out on these drinks.  Don't know what to order?  Ask!  Don't drink alcohol?  Let the bartender make you a non-alcoholic masterpiece. The food:  I had the duck the first time, and lamb shank the second time.  Both were immaculately prepared.  The meat was tender, flavorful, and the spectacular in every way.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  Try the appetizers, too.  Several other reviewers have good suggestions, but they seem to change the menu items regularly.  I don't think you can make a bad choice here. The deserts:  All deserts are creative and made to perfection.  We had the ""milk and cookies"" option along with ""chocolate boxes""  -- both amazing.  Desert menus change regularly as well (I believe).  Normally, I don't even like deserts, but I basically licked the plate at Otom. The decor:  Awesomely modern and sophisticated.  The front loungy area is comfortable-looking and inviting.  The back dining area is hip and edgy. The service:  Seriously, the staff here is not pretentious, friendly, helpful, outgoing, professional, etc.  I cannot come up with anything negative to say, despite the fact that I normally like to keep a critical eye in my reviews.

What I couldn't finish went to my date who has the short rib ravioli which had the best sweet yet salty sauce.

2008-05-19,2.0,"I don't think I would visit Otom again.  The whole experience, including the food, was just very meh.   The interior is very modern and trendy - bright, warm colors and exposed brick.  Plastic chairs - strange - but surprisingly comfortable.  The cocktails were excellent and different - probably my favorite thing about this place.  That Otom is still working out the kinks is evident.   We had a 9:30 reservation and weren't seated until about 10:20.  That's not really acceptable, despite the fact that they comped our pre-dinner cocktails.  I appreciated the gesture, but waiting 50 minutes - with a reservation - that late in the evening is ridiculous.   The clientele is random.   It's a fairly nice place, but there was a girl there wearing - I kid you not - jeans and a trucker hat.  There's trendy, and then there's wearing a freaking trucker hat to dinner.  It was an odd mix - some people were dressed for upscale evening, and some people looked like they got lost on their way to some skanky club.  It was generally a young crowd.   Buuut, I usually base my rating mostly on the food.  So here it goes: I tried a bunch of things, and liked a few, but none really stood out to me, except for this little appetizer that the kitchen sent us before dinner - mini flatbreads with carbonated pineapple and ham - which were AMAZING.  But also were only one bite big.   Everything else was mediocre.  We ordered a baked mac and cheese appetizer, along with the king salmon ceviche (which for some reason was forgetten by our server - never made it to the table).  The mac and cheese was interesting - had a very distinct smokey bacon flavor - but wasn't anything to write home about.  I mean, come on, it was mac and cheese.  Not really an original or difficult concept.   For an entree,  we all kind of shared and tried everything.  I ordered the cod, which was not great.  It was sort of chewy and flavorless - which...I understand it is cod, but I expected a place like this to be able to dress it up a bit.  They didn't.  I tried the jambalaya, which wasn't very good either.  The seasoning was off.  The best entree was the short rib ravioli.  The meat was flavorful and tender, and it was a pretty interesting combination.   Dessert, I will admit, was wonderful.  We ordered the milk 'n cookies.  Try it if you visit Otom, it's spectacular.   The cookies are these crispy thin things with melty chocolate chips, and it's served with these carmel bananas and really flavorful vanilla ice cream.   Yum. I guess my problem is this: I don't mind forking over cash for food, so long as it is interesting and delicious.  This food was obviously edible, and some of it was pretty tasty, but with all the options out there, you'd do better to go somewhere else to drop your cash.  I'm fairly certain you'll get better service, too.

We reserved a 6:30 PM table on Open Table and I was quite surprised when we got there that we were the only customers except for a few people sitting at the bar. For maybe the first 30 minutes we were the only people seated in the entire dining room area (with no poeple seated up front in the lounge or on that long table next to the bar). Things didn't look too promising! We ate at Avec just a few weeks ago on a Tuesday night and the place was packed beyond belief. By the end ouf our two hour dnner the place was about 3/4 full. However, the meal and experience were both fantastic. Service was very good - our waiter was helpful and explained the dishes. The bread guy was very attentive - not sure how many times he replenished our bread - maybe they should just serve larger pieces of bread. We started with the often mentiond salmon ceviche and the thai mussels. The cilantro sauce accompanying the ceviche was delicious and the curry with the mussels packed a satisfying punch. I wouldn't mind ordering the mussels to go and dumping the entire dish over a bowl of rice at home. For the main course, we tried the friend short rib raviolis and the duck. Portions were more than enough and both were delicious. The duck cooked sous vide was amazingly tender and tasty. The brown butter powder on top the raviolis was addictive. I'd snort it if I could. Since the meal was going so well, for dessert we tried the deconstructed banana split and also a funky plate of coconut tropical desserts. The banana split wasn't as great as I was expecting, but it was an interesting take on the dish. The tropical platter included a delicious pineapple cake (I think) with some ice cream. The two went together brilliantly, the ""crust"" on the cake was awesome. The dust on the dish was super intense and the pina colada with a tiny umbrella was cute. My wife and I both enjoyed the dinner and will now start saving for Moto. The only dissapointment was that my wife had ordered the lychee pear cocktail and they were out of the lychee pear puree.

I had a couple raspberry vodka specialty drinks. Not only were they delightfully stiff, they provided me with my weekly allowance of fresh fruit.  So, the highs were extreme highs. First, the appetizers:  the poached shrimp and the mussels. Both served in brilliant sauces you won't find elsewhere. The cod entre was also a unique take on the fish. Heck, I think it even came with a foam, giving you one less reason to pick Moto over Otom. Finally, the graham cookie and warm brownie bites were the best desserts I've had since '06.  Now, the lows. Which were, well, just as extreme. The mac n cheese was murdered by the truffle oil. Yes, I know truffle was in the description, but it's no excuse. The biggest crime was the TV dinner, which in theory is a fun idea for a fine dining makeover. But cauliflower mashed potatoes that look like chocolate and taste like ass are a bad idea.

I was nervous about eating here because I read a lot of conflicting Yelp reviews - but all in all I was fairly impressed. The cocktail list is fun, the decor is very cool, and the wine was delicious. Wine. Yum. Our waiter was personable, attentive, and helpful in terms of describing the dishes and making suggestions. When we asked him which entree was best, he said the pork belly - and then showed us the tattoo of bacon on his arm (I kid you not - strips of bacon, tattooed on his arm). So I ordered the pork belly and it was delicious. I also tried the short rib ravioli - another favorite at the table. There were 10 of us, and everyone cleaned their plate - so I think that says something for the entrees. Appetizers were okay - not as impressive. I had the ""breakfast"" bacon/egg salad and the salad was a little sharp. Other people enjoyed their mussels, mac and cheese, and the salmon ceviche. This was probably the one night in my life when I have not ordered dessert and WOW did I regret it. Luckily, I got a few tastes. The ""coffee break"" dessert was to die for, and everyone else raved about the chocolate chip cookie, the chocolate cubes, and the banana split. A lot of times desserts at these types of places end up being tiny and weird and disappointing. That is not the case here.

I won't write a long review on the food itself.  Generally speaking, it was pretty tasty, or would have been pretty tasty. ""Would have been?"" you ask. Yes, would have been.  One of the major problems was that our food was not hot.  It was warmer than room temperature, but clearly was not as warm as it should be. Food highlights for me, included the Thai sweet potato soup, and one of the desserts - chocolate bites with orange sorbet.  My crispy duck with jasmine rice would have been pretty tasty, but since it was not hot enough (i.e. I think it had been ready for a while before it got out to us) it was not very crispy any longer. In addition to (or maybe in conjunction with) the temperature problem was the service problem.  Our waitress was generally pretty attentive, but as the place got more crowded, it seemed like the kitchen was having problems keeping up.  Our apps came out pretty quickly, but it was seemingly forever until our main courses arrived.

There was also a really long gap in between our salads and main course which didn't make sense since there were only 2-3 other tables in the place.  On to the food...I was sadly not so impressed. It was good, but definitely not the amazing experience I was hoping for. It was listed in the latest issue of Chicago magazine as one of the top restaurants in Chicago so I had high expectations and they just weren't met. The duck was suposedly the best thing on the menu so I went for it, I was not wowed at all.

2008-04-13,3.0,"Let's put the fine print at the top: executive chef Daryl Nash is no Homaru Canto or Wylie Dufresne.  This is not meant to be an indictment, but rather, a statement of fact.  I'm not sure if Canto selectively tampers with some dishes or if Nash is just hedging his bets, because the menu is quite schizophrenic: dishes like Mac n' Cheese and lamb shank draw inspiration from peasant food and are very traditionally executed, while the lyonnaise breakfast salad, poached shrimp, and pork belly rely on gastronomic sleight of hand and are very po-mo.  The restaurant feels like it has two very distinct personalities and unfortunately, the more prominent, extroverted one doesn't deliver nearly as well as the shy, conservative one. The braised lamb is perfectly tender and well-seasoned, accompanied by a simple cassoulet of white beans.  It's pretty much as good as lamb shank gets.  The poached shrimp are also perfectly cooked and delicious by themselves but are completely overpowered by the tex-mex black beans (the extruded, jalapeno flavored noodles, however, are fantastic, delicate, and quite appropriate).  The pork belly, likewise, is almost perfectly cooked (I thought it could benefit from a more pronounced layer of fat), and the smoked bread and spicy wilted greens are delicious accompaniments.  But the sauce is overpowering and do we really need the ""beans"" that are actually made out of pork?  It's a neat trick but the beans just homogenize the dish and would be much more welcome in a dish that doesn't already feature so much pork. All the miscues seen in the previously described dishes seemed to be magnified in the breakfast salad, which featured the greatest amount of molecular tampering.  The greens themselves were ho-hum but they were dripping with a very assertively flavored garlic dressing, which was actually quite tasty in small doses but needed to be scraped off the greens.  Nash seems to be fond of infusing breads with surprising flavors and the smoky garlic croutons in the salad were quite good.  There were two preparations of egg: a ""perfectly cooked"" yolk and a ""bacon egg.""  The former tasted just like a hard-boiled egg yolk removed from the white.  I never got a proper explanation of the ""perfectly cooked"" moniker and it was certainly not deserved.  The latter, an egg soft-cooked in bacon cream and then flash-frozen, was a complete abomination.  The egg white resembled a bacon popsicle: it shattered into egg flakes when I tried to break into it with a fork and the texture and temperature were completely off-putting.  The yolk oozed out instantly and I didn't get an opportunity to try it before it got lost in the salad dressing.  I can actually see this being incredibly tasty if served hot or even room-temperature but the attempt at novelty and shock value killed this dish. So I'm not sure who or what to blame when the concept dishes fail: is OTOM just Nash's half-baked approach to molecular cooking?  Is Canto tampering too much with the menu?  The cooking itself is spot-on but the concepts just don't gel.  And the more avant-garde the dishes try to be, the worse they taste. Now that I got that diatribe out of the way, other things worth mentioning: the mixed drinks are tasty and very generously portioned.  The entrees are very large as well.  The decor is super chic yet very comfortable and relaxing.  The servers are pretty attentive but are very brief with their food descriptions, and at a place like this, more verbosity would be greatly appreciated since many things on your plate are unfamiliar.  The wine list is piddling and incredibly over-priced.  Corkage is $25, which seems ridiculous since that's the cost of the average entree.  They don't have proper stemware!  When we asked for bordeaux glasses, the sommelier had to go next door to MOTO to get them! At this stage in the game, OTOM feels like an afterthought, the redheaded stepchild of its sister restaurant.  It's a shame, too, because there is so much unrealized potential here.",0.999,0.737,0.199,0.065,0.5274703636728953

The girl that was a back waiter (perhaps) was super sweet & even checked the score of the Memphis/Kansas game for me. The food. Everything was very rich and we really were looking for something light.  We had the ceviche as an appetizer (which was very good).  and for dinner I had the tofu with butternut squash and brussel sprouts.  It was OK, not bad but very small and not worth $18 (and I know that is cheap but for 2 pieces of fried tofu, not good enough).  My date had the fish that was on the menu and it tasted like frozen swordfish from Trader Joes that I (poorly) made at home - freezer burned and/or over cooked. I was very surprised at the food and very disappointed.  I honestly expected SO MUCH more from this restaurant.  And, as I mentioned before, even though it is significantly more affordable than Moto, it is not better than most other moderately priced restaurants (Sepia, Blackbird, Green Zebra) that offer the same experience for the same price range. I would likely return because I loved the ambiance and from what I have read I think they could do better.  Perhaps I was there on an ""off"" night.",0.9983,0.734,0.211,0.056,0.5753849206349206

Moving on, the decor was beautiful and the suttle vases on the table had a nice touch.  I started my night with a Crown and Ginger Ale, which never seemed to make it on my tab - good start. Jennifer and I each ordered our fair share of dishes but shared them amongst each other. Appetizers: Tombo Ceviche with citrus bubbles, chili cucumber, wonton chips - this was delicious, the tombo is a type of albacore and the preparation reminded me of a diced sashimi Macaroni and cheese with truffled white cheddar, double smoked bacon and chives - not as great as i had hoped but still delicious, the truffle oil was a nice touch, the dish overall was a tad bit dry.  still good. Entrees: Fried short rib ravioli parsnip vanilla puree and sweet potato butterscotch with brown butter powder - the flavors went together nicely and i was excited for the vanilla, however i wasnt expecting the butterscotch to be as powerful as it was.  I also do not have a sweet tooth so it was a bit much for me, the beef was cooked nicely though Crispy duck breast with candy canes, jasmine rice sesame piff and maplesoy glaze - Easilly my favorite dish of the night, I may order it next time if it's still on the menu.  I thought the duck was perfect, crispy skin with a nice juicy, salty flavor in the meat.  Superb! Desert: Flourless chocolate cake with mint ice cream and orange shavings - We both loved this, great way to end the meal.

We ordered salads and the mac and cheese for our first course.  My friend had the spinach salad and I had the mache salad.  They were both very good.  The mac and cheese is every bit as good as other reviewers have suggested.  It is a must order.   I had the lamb for my main course, and it was great.  My friend had the jambalaya - which he said was good, but I think it might have been a bit too spicy for his tastes.  We also ordered cocktails (a martini and a whiskey) and a bottle of Malbec to go with dinner.  The Malbec was great.  A very nice bottle of wine for $50.  The martini was the ""standard"" $12 that you seem to pay at all of the trendier restaurants now.  I think that's too pricey, but it was an excellent martini.   I was very impressed with our waiter because he answered questions with warm, genuine responses and absolutely zero attitude.  He provided good recommendations when we asked for his opinion, and he managed to be very efficient without hovering.   With tip our meal was $200.  I guess that's not outrageous for this type of restaurant, but I still have a hard time getting over $200 dinner tabs,  I would probably have given Otom five stars, but my friend thought it was a four - So I am going with four.",0.9985,0.735,0.247,0.019,0.6834818228366617

2008-01-09,4.0,"Coming from LA on our first trip to Chicago, we actually wanted to try to get reservations at Moto after finding so many great reviews. Too bad it was New Years Eve weekend and it was completely booked up. So we decided to visit Otom since it had some pretty good reviews too. Decor/Area The decor is very New York-esque, with the exposed brick, minimalist decorations (and to me, a little too Ikea-like). But overall, a trendy-enough ambience, even though they could probably dim the lights a bit more. Actually, Chicago's West Loop area is trying to very much be like NY's Meatpacking District, but not quite there. Food The food is like everyone says - pretty good. Yah it's much more affordable than you'd expect for a place like this, but then again the portions are suprisingly small. The only dish that we couldn't finish was the incredibly rich ravioli dish which the waiter even challenged us to finishing.  Service Now our waiter was amazing and quite the joker. He was very helpful with the menu and gave excellent recommendations on what to have for dinner, as well as wine/cocktail selections. On top of that, he had a keen way of describing things with metaphors. Like for one of the desserts, he said ""It kind of reminds you of a sleigh ride"". We all nodded in unison and muttered ""You're Right!"", only to rethink what he said...that makes no sense! (He's a writer...go figure) The problem was our food took FOREVER. Like almost an hour forever. The place was hardly packed, and when the food came out you can imagine our discontent at the tiny portions. BUT, when we were about to leave and had already discussed amongst ourselves that we'd skip dessert, our waiter comes out and announces, ""the Chef apologizes for the long wait, and he would like to treat you to all four of our desserts."" Good Save! That's what earns Otom that extra star. Not just one or two of the desserts (there were four of us), but the entire dessert menu. And the desserts were awesome (""Reminds you of growing up"", describes the Waiter). So I recommend Otom if you go in knowing it's not as fancy-schmancy as its Moto counterpart. It's a more cozy spot with a pretty good bar area and wine/cocktail list, a tad smaller portions, and the entrees are excellently priced.",0.9984,0.752,0.221,0.027,0.5894722737579882
2007-12-01,5.0,"Moto's been on my go to list for a long time now so when I heard they had a new sibling in town I was all about checking it out. And even more excited to hear that I could eat at Otom for a fraction of Moto's price. Today was the first snowstorm of the season, but that wasn't going to keep us from our reservation at Otom.  Another couple joined us at this sleek, minimalist looking restaurant (LOVE the orange chairs- really into orange these days) for some innovative food and drinks.  And everything was just perfecto! So perfect that when executive chef, Daryl Nash, stopped by our table at the end of the meal and asked if we had any feedback we told him not to change a thing! And here's where I tell you all about our oh so perfect meal.... The night began with a few drinks at the bar.  I asked the sweet, chatty bartender for the best drink on the menu and she suggested the geisha.  At $16 this is the priciest martini on the menu, but so worth it! It has a delicious citrus kick to it and the ""violet sugar"" rimmed glass is the perfect finishing touch.  Otom had a 5 star rating in my book just after this drink, but let's not stop there because there's plenty more to come.... Once seated at our table we were greeted by our fabulous waiter and fellow yelper, John C, who led us down the right path all evening long! Our table ordered many of John's suggestions and have to admit that he sure has good taste, although I have a feeling that everything at Otom is absolutely amazing.   We immediately decided on the mussels (WOW, just WOW) and salmon ceviche (also very good), but I was a bit indecisive when it came to my entree. I usually gravitiate towards the seafood on the menu and the only fish on the menu was cod and I just wasn't' quite feeling cod tonight...and so I decided to be adventurous and order the duck! Duck is such a random choice for me, but I'm sure glad I stepped outside of my box! Perfectly cooked, juicy, and soooo filling.  However, the next time I'm back at Otom (& I definitely will be back) I'll be ordering the ravioli because I loved the bite of my fiance's ravioli so much that I kept asking him for more! The other couple we dined with ordered the cod and the braised pork belly (thanks to John's suggestion) and they were both raving about their entrees as well.  And then on to dessert...John suggested the apple crumble and so we ordered one for the table.  I'm usually all about chocolate desserts, but if all fruity desserts tasted this good I'm happy to say ta-ta to chocolate. This apple crumble is a must to finishing any meal at Otom. I had noticed before dining at Otom that many yelpers had complained about the small portion size of the entrees.  I'm usually one to clean my plate (just call me little piggy) and I thought the portion sizes were just the right size! We left this meal beyond stuffed and probably didn't even need the dessert, but how can you pass up dessert at Otom? Don't expect ginormous portions like you get at Maggianos, but it's certainly enough to enjoy a good meal.  And if 4 big raviolis isn't enough to fill you up then the bread man will take care of that- he came around so many times that I believe we each ate 6 pieces of bread! 6 pieces of bread, 2 appetizers, an entree, and a dessert- no wonder I'm in a food coma right now! Go for the excellent food and stay for the incredible service! Otom took good care of us tonight....including purse hooks for our bags (love it!) and having the valet warm up our car while we paid the bill.

We had a very early reservation  - 5:30 - so that we could have a relaxing dinner before the show. Our waitress reminded me of Allison from last year's Project Runway - the same pretty blond hair, same softspoken voice, and was very sweet. She recommended some drinks for us to start off with - my friend with a lychee pear martini and me with a minute waltz (alcoholic lemonade made with housemade limoncello), both of which were sweet and fruity, but packed quite a punch.. While we were deciding on our meals, a server brought over bread - the three kinds to choose from last night were kalamata olive, green olive, and garlic/onion. We both went with the garlic/onion, and were impressed by the subtleties of the flavors of the bread, and with the homemade butter. I decided to start with the wilted spinach salad, served with golden beets (my favorite) and a garlic vinaigrette. It was perfect spinach, and again, the flavors - especially the combination of beets, pimento, and the garlic - melded together beautifully. I got the short rib ravioli, and I am SHOCKED by people who said that four ravioli wasn't enough - I could barely finish three of them! They're huge and meat-filled, and the sauce is so creamy that to serve any more than four would be a waste for 90% of diners. My friend is a vegetarian, and she had a garbanzo bean salad followed by seared tofu with butternut squash, freeze-dried peas (she said she could eat a bowl of them), and mushrooms. We were both VERY impressed with the quality and the layers of flavors of the food. Of course we had dessert - our waitress was nice enough to bring my friend a glass of dessert wine on the house to congratulate her for getting her PhD! We decided to split two desserts - the brownie sundae (good, classic, with coffee ice cream, candied walnuts, and mini marshmallows) and the banana split (really deconstructed, very creative, very tasty).

The vibe: Cool, loft-like room.  Why the cheap looking orange chairs?  Everything else looks so sleek and upscale - the orange plastic really threw me.  It reminded me of Blackbird but with chairs from Ikea. The food:  Mac and cheese was completely average.  I love seeing what restaurants come up with for mac and cheese - but this was borderline boring. Mussels were okay - but not anything really unique or exciting. Salmon ceviche was a huge hit - the favorite of the table. Mini-burgers were absolutely delicious - but you can't build a whole meal around mini burgers (hmm, or can you???). Pork belly - my friend liked it, but I thought it was overcooked. Swordfish - here is where the meal truly lost me.  My friend was served a piece of fish that never should have left any decent kitchen.  It looked like a dog toy; you could tell it was that rubbery just looking at it.  She sent it back apologetically (we've both been there as servers, and our table mate was a chef, really we aren't jerk customers) and enjoyed the ceviche instead.  But I couldn't believe that fish was ever set on our table. Sweet potato flan - DELICIOUS - order this immediately! The service: Besides the swordfish, this was the other area the restaurant lost me.  Our server started out on an unfriendly foot - rather than letting us all sit and chat for a minute, she steamrolled our conversation and that really irked me.  I asked a few questions throughout the meal and felt like I was being blown off or spoken down to.  Towards the end of the meal she inexplicably brightened up and was quite friendly - but for me it was too little too late. I don't think I will give otom another shot - there are too many really great restaurants for me to try.",0.9978,0.74,0.229,0.032,0.5842592592592593
2007-09-02,4.0,"Fantastic place! The atmosphere is so ber chic and sleek and the service manages  to remain non pretentious.  I've been here a couple of times for drinks and nibbles and I always feel fabulous.   The food is comfort with a twist, great for my suburban friends that are picky and still won't eat sushi but want to feel cool when they come and visit me in the ""big city"". Guys:  TAKE YOUR DATES HERE.  It's new, the prices are reasonable, the food is a safe bet and well... it's a panty dropper.  I'm telling you, I'm still seeing the guy that introduced me to it...",0.9411,0.821,0.179,0.0,0.5654545454545453
2007-09-02,5.0,"Otom is the newest addition to the Fulton Market area and I have to say that it blew me away the other night with its innovative drinks, fantastic food and spectacular service. Otom, a ""reflection"" of its sister restaurant Moto (the manager used that language with me the night I was there and it stuck!) made me feel right off that they wanted my business and valued me as a guest.  I was a bit lost as I was walking up trying to figure out exactly where it was, when I was greeted by Kirk, the manager, who then personally escorted me to the bar area where my friends were waiting.  Very nice! As for the bar- even if I wasn't dining there, the bar would make me want to come back.  They have a menu of specialty drinks that looked and tasted delicious.  In fact- one of my friends was so entranced with her ""violet sugar"" rimmed glass, I wondered if we were ever going to be able to leave the bar area! The restaurant is like a urban loft.  With its exposed light brick walls, orange barrel chairs and wispy curtains defining the seating areas- this place is very chic without losing its sense of comfortableness. We were seated promptly and proceeded to sample several appetizers on the menu.  We started with the trio of sliders- small delights of beef and bun each with its own topping; one with cheddar and bacon, one with mushroom and Swiss and one with a quail's egg.   We also had the salmon ceviche (my favorite) which was served a top a fried wonton and had some type of a cilantro (and cucumber?) sauce served with it.  Our final appetizer of the mussels was so tasty that one of my friends kept it all to himself and finished the entire portion without sharing! So on to the entrees.  I asked our server Alice what she recommend and she suggested the pork ribs.  Wanting to try a range of their food, we also ordered the braised beef ravioli as well as the macaroni and cheese and decided to share it all.   All of the entrees were delicious!  The ribs were covered in a tangy sauce and served with fresh pickles.  The ravioli was a variety of interesting flavors that worked well together.  And the mac and cheese?  A combination of cheeses served in this small pot that made it crusty on all sides.  Mmmmmm. Hard to believe after all of this we still had room for dessert- but we took the plunge and ordered the strawberry shortcake and the apple crisp.  The manager also came by during dessert and served us a sparkling Muscatel that was the perfect compliment to our desserts.  While both were good- the apple crisp with its large slices of apple, crisp and melting ice cream was my favorite. The service was impeccable and both Alice and Kirk left me with the impression that they cared about my business and really wanted me to come back in the future.  I also loved the ""purse hooks"" that they brought to hang our purses up with.  Nice touch. All in all- I would have to say that Otom ""reflects"" well upon it's sister Moto.  I can't wait to go back!",0.9965,0.847,0.142,0.012,0.5489256678281069
2007-08-31,4.0,"Fulton Market is a strange area, but there's something about the remoteness of the area that makes me feel like I'm in on a great secret.   Anyway, we made last minute (same day) reservations for Otom today and it was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time.  The restaurant is very cool...understated and modern.  We were seated right away at a table tucked in the corner. We started with drinks...the cocktails are very good with house-made limoncello and orangecello.   We loved both of the drinks we ordered, and according to our waitress, the cocktail menu changes frequently. For appetizers we had mini burgers and ceviche.  The ceviche was salmon on fried wontons with a pepper sauce and a cucumber cilantro sauce.  Very, very good and light.  I really enjoyed it.   The mini burgers came with little, mini fries and house-made ketchup and mustard.  The ketchup, made with heirloom tomatoes was incredible.  My mouth is watering right now thinking of it.  The three burgers were a bacon-cheddar burger, quail egg, and mushrooms and swiss?  All three were delicious...and this dish could have been  a meal in itself. Entrees were just as delicious.   Brian had the grilled top sirloin with butter-roasted potatoes and golden onion rings.  He LOVED it.  The sirloin was tender and rich, the onion rings were salty and the potatoes were done perfectly.  I had swordfish with julienned vegetables in gooseberry soup.  Which was delicious, a little sweet, salty and tangy.  It was a very light dish, but extremely flavorful. After all that we were starting to get pretty full, but we couldn't pass up dessert: strawberry shortcake--mascerated strawberries, mint sauce, whipped cream (it may have been sweetened sour cream), and freshly toasted shortcake squares.  It was incredible.  On of the best things I've had all year.  It was hot and cold, crunchy and soft, sweet and tangy, creamy and light.  It was the perfect ending to the meal.  The service was good, and the pace of the meal was excellent.  The one criticism I have (although very small) is that I felt a little pressured by our waitress to order more cocktails, but that really isn't the end of the world, is it??",0.9985,0.764,0.22,0.017,0.6031243926141886
2007-08-30,4.0,"This is a wonderful place - so warm and friendly and the food is delicious!  And the cocktails - wow!  Usually I'm a wine girl, because I always think cocktails are overpriced for the quality.  But here, the cocktails are totally yummy and worth every penny.  I had the Back Nine with housemade orangcello - I wanted a whole pitcher.   I started with the soup - supposedly cream of spinach with leek.  But I'm pretty sure there was a mistake because it was red and I didn't detect any spinach.  I'm guessing it was tomtato leek.  And I'm not complaining - it was great.  My boyfriend tasted it and said it should be called ""Cream of Wonderfulness"".   He started with the ceviche and was in heaven.  Our entrees were some kind of breaded, fried fish for him and short rib filled ravioli (with a goat cheese cream and butter sauce) for me.  Again, I've run out of words to describe how tasty they were.   Now for desert - we splurged on 2 - the brownie with coffee ice cream and the ""banana split"".  The banana split is pureed banana, frozen on a stick, then dipped in chocolate, topped with pineapple, carmel or strawberry and resting on a pillow of homemade marshmello cream.  OH MY GOD!  And the brownie melted in your mouth, just fabulous.   The service was very attentive and friendly.  There were a couple of little blips - our entrees were slow to come out and it took a while to get our bill.  No matter - we were comped our deserts and everyone was so nice it made up for it.     We definitely want to go back as soon as we can.  The price is right (about the same as we paid at Alhambra Palace and that place sucked!  Why you'd go there, when you could come to Otom for a great meal, I can't imagine).   It would also be a great place just to go for drinks.  I look forward to trying many more drinks off that cocktail menu!",0.9952,0.8,0.179,0.021,0.5935355862775219
2007-08-08,4.0,"Very stylish interior with good food at affordable prices.  The restaurant is next door to Moto, its alter ego, and it maintains the edgy feel of the other restaurants in the neighborhood (Follia). The sliders and grilled cheese for the starters were great.  Entrees include chicken pot pie and macaroni and cheese.  My back ribs were tasty, although short on meat. Other than that, I highly recommend the restaurant for a bite before heading out. UPDATE:  I revisited Otom a few months ago, and they've revamped their menu based on the response from customers.  The price point is higher and the menu offerings are more in line with Moto (although not quite).  I still give this restaurant 4 stars as our meals were fantastic (and they kept the mac and cheese as a starter!).",0.9285,0.9,0.1,0.0,0.5093333333333333

The service is top notch and most entrees are under $20.  This is the sister restaurant of Moto (which is super expensive) and this carrys more comfort food American.... yum!  The space is great and very urban.  Our food was great and did I tell you about the service? I felt like I should be spending more for my meal because of the way they outdid themselves.  Also,  our bottle of wine was really good and was ONLY $24 a bottle.  So we had two!   Why the hell not, for the price. AND.... my girlfriend left to go to the bathroom and they set up a hook on the side of the table and placed her purse there! Nice! Small details... but SOO worth noting.  One other thing my friend is vegetarian, and they made him a meal from scratch that I wish I ordered ( the NON Vegetarian!)!!  They definitely go out of there way here and it is worth the trip!  So I guess go, cause I told you about it, but I hope I still have a seat.  ;(",0.9952,0.718,0.256,0.027,0.47061403508771926
