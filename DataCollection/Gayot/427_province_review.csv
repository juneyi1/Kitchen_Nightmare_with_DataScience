2013-11-11,4.0,"NEWS: Randy Zweiban Has Closed Province Restaurant Chicago diningchicago.com/blog/2… Looking to re concept the 161 N. Jefferson St. location in early 2014. His Provence restaurant in Phoenix is continuing operation. Executive Chef/Owner Randy Zweiban, who first brought Nuevo Latino cooking to Chicago with Nacional 27, has crafted a dynamic menu that is grounded in American cuisine and influenced by Central and South American and Spanish dishes. In 1989, Zweiban headed south to Miami, where he could open a catering company with a similar clientele in a warmer climate. He then went to work with celebrated chef Norman Van Aken, first at a mano and then at Norman's, where he was Chef de Cuisine and partner. Over the seven and a half-year period that the two collaborated, Zweiban immersed himself in the vibrant culture and cooking of Miami's Latino community, while continuing to work with Van Aken's New World Cuisine. He also, during this period, took a one-year hiatus from Miami to work as Executive Chef at The Gate, a popular Los Angeles supper club. In the summer of 1998, Richard Melman and Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, Inc. (LEYE) brought Zweiban to Chicago to unveil the city's first Nuevo Latino concept. At the helm of Nacional 27, Zweiban received numerous accolades, including being named "" One of the Best New Restaurants"" byChicago magazine which Chicago magazine also recognized Province for. Province was given a three out of four star review by the Chicago Tribune. Zweiban has been featured in Bon Appétit, Gourmet, Newsweek, Food Arts, USA Today, Metropolitan Home and Esquire, among other publications.",0.9648,0.921,0.079,0.0,0.3392045454545454
2013-11-11,3.0,"Well, at first I was going to leave a 4 star rating, but then I spoke with one of the friends that went to dinner with me afterwards and found out she got sick from the fish she had that night and her hubby also commented on how fishy it tasted, so I'm downgrading by a star. Came in sat night with a big party and the place was almost empty. Uh-oh, I thought. But to be honest, the dining room soon filled up, and the food was pretty good. Started with the ginger pear cider and it was soooo yummy! Our big table shared a paella, which was a little skimpy on the seafood and not very memorable. Amuse bouche was some carrots with fried shallots. Though I'm not a carrot fan, I gobbled this up without complaint. For entree, I had the hamachi (which my friend also ordered). Mine tasted fine, although there were parts of it that were undercooked, and the sauce was way too salty. The branzino and skirt steak, on the other hand, were excellent.  Ended with the coffee & donuts. I'm not a huge fan of donuts, but ordered this because it was the only thing that caught my interest on the dessert menu. The donuts were a pleasant surprise: light, fluffy, not greasy at all, and not over-sweet. LOVED the coffee ice cream. Chocolate shooter tasted funny and kept me up that night :(",0.9907,0.69,0.217,0.092,0.6696249402771142
2013-10-08,5.0,"I am updating my rating to five stars (although I'd really say 4.5 stars and I'm rounding up). I've been back with groups (as large as 14 people) 7 times in the past three months.  Every time, the service has been perfect (I would especially like to commend ""Shelly"" who has been my waitress on four of these occasions as cheerfaul and knowledgable).  The tasting menu (which is what we have always gotten) is an amazing value for the price -- probably one of the best ""foodie"" values in Chicago for tasting menus -- especially with the free wine pairing on Wednesdays. In the eight times I've been there recently, there were only two small issues with food: one dessert of corn bread was a little dry and one wine pairing didn't match too well with a soup.  But other than that, all of the dishes were enjoyable and most of the dishes were quite outstanding. I took my brother and his wife there (who have been to a number of high end restaurants with me) and they proclaimed it was the best meal they've ever had in Chicago.  Last night, I brought in a group of seven coworkers, and two of them repeated remarked during dinner that they ""would have to bring theirs wives"" back for the tasting menu. On one trip, we had buffalo-style pork belly.  It's something I dream about.  Seriously!  I keep hoping the chef will add this to the permanent menu or at least repeat it in the tasting menu. It's worth noting that they post their tasting menu every Wednesday (for the free wine pairing night) but the menu can change daily depending on what ingredients are freshest and available.  From week to week, there are larger changes although a couple staple items (like BBQ duck) return to the menu periodically.  Our dinner last night (Monday) had two courses that were different from the last menu posted 5 days previously.",0.9725,0.892,0.099,0.008,0.46035014005602237

2013-08-13,4.0,"Went here with a friend on a Thursday night. We had purchased a groupon for a 3 course meal that included a glass of wine. The place was totally dead, but it was super early since we went after work.  For the first course we both had mushroom dishes. Hers was a flatbread and mine was pureed in goat cheese and was more of a spread. Hers was just meh, I could have licked mine out of the jar. Second course, She had a salmon and loved it. I ordered a barramundi and it was way too fishy! wasn't going to say anything but the waitress could tell i wasn't nuts about it and forced me to order something else. I got the steak and it was delicious! So thanks awesome waitress cause i don't think i would have liked the place as much as I did. Last course was dessert which we both got the ""coffee and donuts"". Um it was ridiculous! A tiny hot chocolate and these cinnamon/sugar donut holes. SO GOOD!",0.9887,0.728,0.214,0.059,0.5231481481481481
2013-08-09,4.0,"I love fish. I do. I think it's the perfect date food or even perfect business meal food. It's usually priced somewhere in the middle of the chicken and steak entrees and gets dressed up in fun flavors and it's easy to eat so you're not working too hard as you're promoting yourself. It's also perfect with gal pals right before a night of drinking (even though it might leave you with more of a hangover the next day than a steak) because it doesn't overstuff you to the point of not being able to hang out all night filling your stomach with more liquid. Plus, it just tastes good. So when I saw a groupon for this place for a three-course meal for two, I was like ooooh fancy fish, I'm so in. So I came here with my friend to treat her for her birthday and we loved everything we put in our mouths, from the amuse bouche to the desserts. I was starving when I walked in, so I was a bit sad that we didn't get any bread to start, but then what arrived was way better: two mini cups of a carroty slaw with something crispy on top, and flavorful cracker sticks with a garlic white bean spread. Delicious. We did have to choose our courses off a ""groupon menu,"" which was a bit annoying because what I had originally picked out for myself from their online menu wasn't on it, but I was able to find something I would enjoy. But for the wine selections, we were able to substitute their standard two offerings for what we preferred, which was good for me, because I don't love chardonnay.  For our apps, my friend chose the mushroom rillete, which was mushroomy and goat cheesy with some toasted baguette slices and was good. I selected the scallop ceviche, which was light and crispy and fresh, and also good. Then the entrees arrived and they looked amazing. My friend had the salmon, which was crispy and flavorful, and I had the hamachi which had some asian flavors and a nice char on it. We cleaned our plates. I even scooped up all the garnish in the sauce and ate them and I don't usually bother to do that. Dessert was next. My friend opted for the donuts and coffee, which was cinnamon sugary donut holes and coffee ice cream- yum- and I had the cherry shortcake, which was good and fruity with a sour lemon curd and came with vanilla ice cream, but I'm not sure I would order it again if I went back. So the food was delicious and I did not mind, like everyone else seemed to, that they included the tax and tip from the pre-groupon total in the final bill. Isn't that normal? You're always supposed to tip on the non-groupon total, otherwise you're a cheapo. The atmosphere was a bit lacking, however, and that's where the star gets taken off. It was cold and somber and lacked any personality. The waitress tried to get us to order some sides because the dishes were kind of ""small"" and other people usually were hungry for more. And this is why this country has an obesity problem. Three, actually four courses with the amuse bouche, and it's not enough food? Portions should be small and should not have to come with a basket of fries or mac and cheese to satisfy. So yeah, we really enjoyed the food, but it's not the first place I would choose to go back to.",0.9986,0.787,0.185,0.028,0.5620153525891233

2013-06-07,2.0,"I've dinned here twice now, once for an office lunch and another for dinner and thought it was average. I really want to like this place so when I saw a Groupon for $80 for two first courses, two entrees, two desserts and two glasses of wine I thought it would be a perfect excuse to go back (read further down for the downside and trickiness of the restaurant).  I like the décor; I think it's light and airy. The color gives it a pop and is very modern with the large artwork on the walls.  While I am not disappointed with the food, it also does not knock my socks off.  I've held off on writing a review just because I cannot figure out how to describe or classify the food. All of the fish dishes I have had have been great. The salmon salad, Organic Salmon entrée and Hamachi were very tasty and filling. The bok choy with the Hamachi was a prefect touch. You also cannot go wrong with the coffee and doughnuts for dessert.  If you happened to purchase the Groupon, beware. You are given a separate menu (OK that's fine, we knew we would find stuff to enjoy).  We also were aware that there would be tax and tip included. However, the restaurant charges you tax and tip on the order as if you didn't have the Groupon. We found this a bit sly and deceiving. If we had paid what they wanted it would have ended up being almost the same price as dining without the Groupon. This is not my idea of Groupon/deals/coupons. If the restaurant wants to bring in patrons and wants them to come back, this is not the way to do it. We questioned the hostess about the bill and she was kind enough to adjust it accordingly. We ended up paying $80 for the Groupon, plus tax and tip on top of that. Instead of $80 and tax and tip on $135. I don't want to sound cheap; we just thought it was poor form to not advertise this on the Groupon fine print. I doubt I will be returning, partially due to their Groupon issue but also because I think everything is mediocre.",0.7912,0.909,0.06,0.031,0.4543998015873016
2013-06-02,3.0,"3.5 stars We went for the ""Wine Wednesday"" tasting menu, which came to about $68, not the $49 advertised. Valet missed us pulling up. I stood in a parking spot and valet attempted to run out and catch us for our business, but it was too late. We did his job for him. Service was spotty, most of the food was excellent. This place sat us inside near a wall of rorschach artwork, with a very very pink booth and wall. This was a little weird as a design choice, but I was digging the giant wine cellar with clear window feature.  I had high hopes for this and course one, three and four were 5 star level, could easily be seen at Next or Alinea. pre-course one, there were flatbreads and some sides, which honestly I found a little unnecessary.  course one  Growing Power Farm Tomato and Mahon Cheese Salad | pickled spring  onions, sherry-basil vinaigrette  Albariño, Lusco, Zios de Lusco, Rias Baixas, Spain | 2011  The pairing was perfect. The tomatoes were picked that day. Fresh and wonderful. However the service failed to describe the dish to us, just walking away.  course two  Soft Shell Crab Bisque | fried green tomato salsa  Cabernet Franc, Couly-Dutheil, Rosé, Chinon, France | 2012 I would suggest putting in the fried green tomato salsa LAST into this soup so the corn fry stays on the tomatoes. The texture dissolution was my only issue with this delicious course. The pairing was the least successful of the evening.  After this course we got ""dessert"" bombed by some patrons leaving. One was like a raspberry pie deconstructed, tart and delicious, and the other was more like a chocolate and cookie crumble with a heavy cream and ice cream. Both were good. course three  California Hamachi | Klug Farm asparagus, charred lemon vinaigrette  Tempranillo, Vina Pedrosa, El Pedrosal, Ribera del Duero, Spain | 2009  This was amazing: they cut the asparagus for us and the hamachi portion was very generous for a tasting menu. It was perfectly marinaded in the lemon vinaigrette.  course four  BBQ'd Duck | vanilla mashed sweet potatoes, crispy carrots  Syrah/Mazuelo/Garnacha, Can Blau, Montsant, Spain | 2011  A remarkable idea to pair the small shreds of duck with the mashed sweet potatoes. Also a large portion, very, very successful. course five  Rhubarb-Orange Cake | rhubarb compote, orange-vanilla ice cream  Torrontes, Susana Balbo, Late Harvest, Mendoza, Argentina | 2010 I felt the wine was the stand out of the evening and anyone who likes dessert wines would love this one. It paired perfectly but the dessert itself was a little bit flat after all those complex earlier flavors in the duck and the hamachi.  I would have preferred a little less feeling of ""bready"" throughout this meal. However, the preparation of the food was great and 4 out of the 5 wine pairings were highly successful.  That said, when we walked in, we saw little wrapped cookies for the way out. I thought what a nice idea. They put the bowl away. I asked if we could have some and the host said no! She probably could have taken the two seconds to do this instead of losing a service star over this real disppointment on the way out. This is the kind of detail that loses a customer.  I'd try more and would upgrade if they have a better night on the service front. The food is good. I just felt like they were a bit rough around the edges.",0.9985,0.766,0.184,0.05,0.5976814988290398

2013-05-25,1.0,"The main reason that I rated this place 2 stars is because our dining experience was completely ruined by our waitress.  We had a large group and decided to go here for an small ""sprinkle"" to celebrate my sister having her baby.  When we were deciding what to order, the waitress was extremely pushy.  She told us we HAD to order everything right away and did not give us the option to order more food later if we thought we did not have enough.  When we told her what we wanted she kept insisting that we did not order enough food even though we insisted that we thought we were comfortable with the amount of food we ordered.  She tried to make us feel like idiots during the whole ordering process.  My mother eats extremely spicy food and when we asked the waitress to mention that to the chef for her dish she insisted that the chef knew what he was doing and that the dish was spicy.  I have eaten out enough to know that my mom needs something added to the dish, and i was right, the vegetable paella was too bland.  At that point we did not even feel comfortable telling the waitress because she seemed so upset anytime we mentioned anything that she did not agree with.  When I asked her if she had written down that we ordered the bass she said no and so she wrote it down.  Then she showed up with two bass entrees.  When we told her we only ordered one she just mumbled something as if we were mistaken and then walked away......and she charged us for the extra dish.  No apology or anything.  She acted like a complete know it all. We dine out all the time and found her extremely condescending.  I will never go there for a special occasion again. She made us all very uncomfortable.",-0.393,0.875,0.057,0.068,0.5684240362811793

2013-04-24,2.0,"Let me preface by saying I was taken here for a work lunch and we had a pre-set menu, none of which sounded good to me but the gesture was extremely thoughtful and I'm grateful to work for such appreciative people. The restaurant itself was pretty tiny, very clean and minimal, which I liked.  I had an apple salad and it was ok.  The candied olives were chopped so finely it was hard to tell they were olives or candied as the flavor from the Granny Smith apples overpowered the potential candied olive flavor.  The salad could have used a bit more of the crushed nuts to help cut down on the tartness. I debated between the fish of the day, which was a Michigan white fish, and the steak as I rarely order steak when I go out to eat but I went ahead and ordered it this time.   It was drenched in some heavy sauce while floating atop mushy diced potatos.  I had a better steak at chain places like Ruth's Chris and Kiefers.  The saving grace...the deserts.  Again, I rarely order desert but they brought out a triple rich brownie with this light but decadent sauce oozing all over it...they had a few homemade donut holes resting on top of a coffee flavored ice cream, an apple cobbler and a chocolate shot.  I took a little bit of each and they all tasted quite perfect.  I feel like deserts can easily cross the line of simple and tasty to ""holy hell that's all sugar"" and these were all pretty on point. I may give them another shot and return to order something from their regular menu.   ***This place is EXCELLENT in regards to peanut allergies and most food allergies.  They make it a point to bring food out completely separate of other plates that have been cooked even remotely close to something a person has an allergy to, it was very reassuring to see a staff so attentive.***",0.9957,0.756,0.197,0.047,0.5578847760426706

Great spacious ambiance.  Interesting but not exciting food.  Acceptable service. How's that? More detail:  The décor emphasizes their sustainable attitude, but is still pleasant and classy.  Part of the ambiance is the open feeling and the uncrowded table settings.  It's quiet and private, rare in many restaurants today.  What I enjoy about the food is their emphasis on root vegetables.  It changes the taste of a piece of white fish to be surrounded by ""market root vegetables"" - whatever they could buy fresh that day.  It's a pleasant change, but not the way I'd want my fish every meal. The five chocolates dessert is as good as it sounds. There are a dozen restaurants in Chicago I would choose before Province, but each time we've done the occasional visit we've enjoyed it.  If you have the chance to go, you should enjoy it.  Perfect for a long unbothered late lunch.  But I doubt it'll make your ""remarkable"" list.",0.9899,0.729,0.221,0.05,0.5705128205128205

For dessert the surprise was the caramel flan with honey.  OMG!  I want more of that!!  It was so interesting.  I thought I was going to want the chocolate but the caramel wins!   Like I said there was chocolate cake but it was a little too dry.  The chocolate chip ice cream that came with it was amazing and helped the cake a bit.

I came here for a business function and reserved the back room for a party of 17.  I had pre-selected the hors d'oeuvres, dinner options, and desserts because I did not want a lot of time spent on ordering.  I also required a specific room set up.  The staff met and exceeded all my expectations. Décor:  Modern, trendy, colorful.  The tables are spaced far enough so that you are comfortable and do not feel crowded. Food:  Since this was a business functions, I did not want a lot of time spent ordering dinner.  I offered everyone a selection of four dinner items.  I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked.  As I looked down the table, each plate was beautiful presented and I did not receive one complaint. Service:  The service was number 1.  Everyone from the front door staff to the bussers, to the servers, was all very responsive.   They were available to assist with everything and anything.  Whether it was taking everyone's coats, ordering more wine bottles, changing room configuration, climate control, or ordering cabs, the staff was extremely helpful and personable. Since I was coming from California, I picked the Province based on Yelp reviews.  I was concerned about some of the negative remarks but chose this restaurant because of the private room.  I was not disappointed.  I would highly recommend the Province for business or pleasure.   P.S.  I have never given a full stars rating on Yelp.",0.9842,0.847,0.133,0.02,0.5692063492063493

We shared a bunch of small plates between four of us and then each got a main dish.  Before that came out, we got two amuse bouche dishes, one of a smoked salmon and vegetable medley which tasted really fresh and then a plate of mini buttermilk biscuits, white wine crackers and a white bean puree, all fantastic. Empanadas - somehow I didn't get one since there were only three on the plate but they were pretty tiny (two bites maybe)  Cherry BBQ Lamb - Lamb braised in a tangy cherry BBQ sauce and served with mushrooms and corn tortilla triangles, very good and the meat was very tender, unusual BBQ but it all was delicious Beet Salad - Both yellow and red beets and blue cheese and candied almonds, best combination ever Oysters - They gladly upped the standard plate of six to eight for our table of four, champagne mignionette was awesome Butter Poached Shrimp - The shrimp was cut a little on the small side so it kind of meshed in with the size of the white beans but the tomato sauce was spicy, overall a very comforting dish but not my favorite For entrees two people got the skirt steak with chimichurri and said it was surprisingly tender for skirt steak.  I got the BBQ Short Rib since I'm a sucker for short rib and mixing it with the mac and cheese, brilliant. We also got one each of the sides, more mac and cheese, lobster mashed and brussels sprouts.  I had plenty of mac so I didn't take more, the lobster mashed was decent but not mind-blowing and the sprouts were good again, solid but nothing to make them totally stand out.  And with the number of places jumping on the brussels sprouts train, I would expect a little oomph.

We had a variety of appetizers first including meatballs, empanadas, and the tuna taco. My favorite was the empanadas. The outside crust was cooked just right so the crust wasn't too hard. We all each got our own main course and I chose the swordfish. It was served by some seriously tasty lobster mashed potatoes. We ordered additional sides of market vegetables and mac n cheese to share. My fish was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but still very good. It just wasn't flaky and buttery enough.

But as soon as the caramelized banana split and chocolate five ways hit the table I went for it. Both were out of this world! Note: chocolate five way is EXTREMELY rich tasting so proceed with caution. The pride themselves on organic, natural, and fresh ingredients only and you can definitely tell.

Food was hit or miss. The ceviche was great, a definite must try. We tried the oysters, and I found them a little lack luster, although I did appreciate the homemade sauces. I enjoyed my strip steak and my boo was quite the fan of her pork. I will say I was disappointed with every side being some form of sweet potato. I know that's fashionable, but sweet potato is hit or miss in my opinion. The sweet potato that came with the pork was pretty good, but the sweet potato au gratin served with the steak was not a winner. You could tell it had the makings of a great side, but it just made me want real potatoes and the sweetness of the sweet potato just doesn't work in that type of a dish.

My husband and I live downtown in the River North area and we frequently drive by Province, which seems to always have a good amount of people in attendance nightly. We decided to go out to dinner while the NATO summit was in town(since the majority of the city was dead to the world). Neither my husband nor I had ever been to Province before, it was highly recommended by my sister and brother-in-law who have been quite a few times. We had a reservation, the restaurant was unusually slow(Nato), which was actually pretty nice. Our server was a young man named Adam, who is also the bartender there.  Adam was INCREDIBLY friendly, knowledgeable, conversational, attentive and quick to give suggestions from wines to dishes to try. Before I continue any further, let me say that I have lived in Chicago for almost five years and Adam gave us, by FAR, the BEST service I have EVER had while living here...and also the best service I have EVER HAD in my life. Europe, U.S., you name it: BEST. He's the BEST! Not only were his suggestions spot on, I am a finicky eater(this was expressed to him), so after we had ordered our two appetizers, he had an additional one sent out(the tapas tasting) which was on him. I don't eat fish at all, this dish had two types of fish, and I ate them...and actually really liked them. He and my husband both coaxed me to try the duck meatballs, which again, were delicious.  For dinner I had the skirt steak...I can't express enough how finicky of an eater I am...only recently have I been able to eat a steak or burger cooked medium...the steak came out on the more medium rare side, without fear or complaint I tried it and it was DELICIOUS! The sweet potato gratin that came with it was so good, my mouth is watering just thinking about it at this moment. My husband was also very pleased with his entree.  In terms of the quality of the food,  by taking just a few bites, you can tell how fresh the ingredients are and how much care the chef places in his/her dishes. At this point in the evening, I am full, but Adam gives us some suggestions for dessert. We order the house-made chocolate sorbet, which was amazing. As another sweet gesture,  Adam brought to us a dessert shot, again on him. For the life of me, I wish I could remember the name of it. But, it was another delicious suggestion and a really great way to top off our evening. Province definitely offered us exemplary service and even if the food wasn't great, we would come back because the service was so impressive.

After a few clicks of the mouse on Gdine, we were set for a prix fixe evening. At 10 o'clock on a Friday, I probably nabbed the latest possible reservation. The place harbored a quiet and calm reflective of the west side scene. BEET SALAD I've been on a beet kick lately and the salad did not disappoint! Loved the crunch of pepitas and bites of cheese. BAY SCALLOP CEVICHE I had a few tastes of my friend's pick and was instantly blown away. While I'm usually wary about consuming raw seafood (with the exception of select sushi), this dish was creamy yet citrusy with good accents of green tomatoes.   ORGANIC SALMON   I was yet again, in the mood for fish. The salmon was perfectly seared and prepared. The parsnip gnocchi was a little on the lackluster side.   LAMB My friend's dish was best described as a well-plated bowl of BBQ lamb noodles. In general, I'm not a fan of lamb's inherent gaminess but appreciated the flavors. COFFEE & ""DONUTS"" Still dreaming about the cinnamon churro-donut-holes dipped in the tiny cup o' rich chocolate and scoop of coffee ice cream. I only wished there were more churros. BOSC PEAR CHERRY BRIOCHE PUDDING The bread pudding itself was delicate with just the right touch of sweetness, however the scoop of smoked pear cider sorbet was... bizarre. The smokiness completely did a roundhouse kick to the tongue and we were left with a puzzling BBQ taste that didn't quite work with the rest of the dish. Towards the end of the meal, it felt as if we had the whole place to ourselves.

I've been there at least 4-5 times for lunch since it's very close to our office and, to be honest, there's not a lot of choices around the area for good lunch places. But every time I'm there, I'm disappointed. Yesterday was no exception. I went with a few coworkers to Province for their Restaurant Week menu. For starters, I had their beer-steamed mussels with roasted garlic, shallots, herbs, and romesco toast. Meh. It was basically mussel soup. I didn't expect that it would be a soup and had I known that, I probably would have gone with another starter. Besides that, the mussels themselves weren't very tasty. I've been on a mussel-eating kick recently and this mussel dish was probably the worst I've had of the 5x I've had mussels within the last week. For the entree, I had the duck confit and roasted, rice bean stew, pork belly, and chicken linguica ( pinterest.com/pin/252483… ). This was actually a very tasty dish. The duck and pork belly were really well done and delicious. My problem was with all the beans. I got through everything but the beans in about 5 minutes and was basically left with mounds-full of beans. There was just not enough duck and way too much beans in this dish. They need to balance this out more. Finally, for dessert, I had the chocolate parfait with crumbled brownies, chocolate crema, and chocolate sorbet ( pinterest.com/pin/252483… ). This was the highlight of the lunch. The serving was pretty big, easily enough to share with a few people, and it was good too. I'd definitely order this dessert again if I ever go back. The thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever go back to Province. I certainly don't see myself going there for a while.",0.9726,0.851,0.112,0.037,0.4592328042328042

Service was really what brought Province down to 3 stars.  It was restaurant week, but it wasn't crowded at all, perhaps since it was a Tuesday.  So no excuses for bad service due to that.  I was early for our reservation so I sat at the bar to get a drink, where I wasn't even addressed for 5 minutes.  Unfortunately the poor service at the bar translated to the table, since the bartender was also our waiter.  We all ordered the wine pairings (totally worth it at an $11 upcharge - we got 3 full glasses!), and he came back 5 minutes after we placed our order to show us the menus again and ask us to pick our own wine pairings.  Ummmmm, don't people who work in restaurants go to school for this sort of thing????  Don't call it a pairing if I have to pick it, call it a drink special.  Oy, he was just awful.

We ordered one of each of the desserts to try - guess we were holding out hope.  Only the chocolate parfait got good marks.  The rest were a mix match of flavors and textures that didn't delight.   For example the bread pudding was okay and the cherries were a nice twist but the dish was ruined when I had a bite with the smoky flavored ice cream/sorbet on top.    Environment is okay - modern but not in an appetizing way.  Almost too sterile to feel comfortable and relax to enjoy breaking bread together.

2011-12-05,4.0,"Up until a few years ago, I wasn't much for celebrating my birthday. It comes after realizing that it's the perfect excuse to round friends for a nice meal and nice conversation. For the work birthday club edition of my birthday meal, I chose Province. I picked Province for three main reasons: (1) reasonable proximity to work, (2) positive reviews from friends and (3) the menu, particularly the dessert lunch menu. The restaurant's space is interesting - earthy and colorful. Branches jut out from the ceiling and accent the space.  The walks are pink and white and multicolor clipboards that resemble easels support the menus. A LEED certified space, there are sustainable and recycled touches that give it an earthy, yet polished air. I'm not sure if it was a fluke, but the day we dinged they were devoid if any real lunch crowd - if you want to play it safe, they take reservations. The lunch menu is a composition of small plates and mains. We were interested in the ahi tuna taco as a starter, but balked at the $8/taco price tag. I'm not sure what about the tacos commands such a price, but it seemed a little ridiculous. Instead, we opted for the tetilla fondue, which our server noted was apt for sharing. I loved the fondue; the beer cheese was flavorful and I'm a sucker for pretzel bread which was supplied for dipping.  For my entree, I was torn between the smoked salmon sandwich and the special, a swordfish sandwich with serrano chili tartar sauce. Fortunately, a colleague was intrigued by both and we decided to split the two items. Typically, I think ordering off the menu is playing it safe - something has to be tried and true to earn a permanent spot on the menu. Unfortunately, I found the smoked salmon, a menu staple, entirely average, if not disappointing. I'm not sure if it was a matter of over-smoking, but the salmon was tough; it made the open face sandwich difficult to eat. The swordfish sandwich style the show and took this from a 3-star experience, closer to 4. This sandwich deserves a permanent spot on the menu; the fish was succulent and the serrano tartar gave it a perfect kick. The only thing I would have changed about the dish was the side of slaw; not a fan. From the moment I saw the lunch menu, I had my dessert order picked out. Coffee + ""donuts"" dessert = amazing. The dessert is comprised of churros that resemble beignets, coffee ice cream and a demitasse of mexican hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is more akin to straight melted chocolate than  a cup of Swiss Miss. Dip your churros and ice cream in the hot chocolate and take the remaining beverage as a chaser. Don't even attempt to share this dish, it's too good not to savor every bite. While I didn't always think the Latin influence was apparent in the plates, Province is a solid choice for a nicer lunch. It works well for a business lunch and they have private dining rooms for group functions.

And then I wait another ten minutes to be asked if I'd like to order a second drink. Around that time the waitress also brings us bread, and another guy comes by and removes the place settings for the two empty spots. All that should have happened 15 minutes previous. Then the entrees come. Mine, a braised lamb that's been shaped into a tasteless hockey puck on some dense corn material, comes cold in the center. Still waiting on my drink. So for the fourth time in my life I send something back, and they say they'll replace it. And what comes back two minutes later is the same meat and corn stuff that's just been half-halfheartedly pressed back into a hockey puck and overheated in a microwave. I was so disgusted I put it aside on the empty table next me and tell the manager it's inedible dog food. i In all fairness, the manager didn't object to having all the food sent back, took it all off the bill and offered to comp us desert. I got the feeling they knew they were having problems with the kitchen and just had to take their lumps.  Hopefully things will improve there, but I think this place is too risky. Successful restaurants maintain quality consistently over time, and despite some of the great reviews here on Yelp, it's obvious that Province has some serious quality control issues.",0.8209,0.883,0.066,0.052,0.41642156862745094

2011-11-11,2.0,"I was excited to try Province, but ultimately disappointed.  This is probably more like 2.5, but I had to round down.  The menu was really intriguing and you can usually count on a damn good meal in the West Loop.  Ultimately, though, we found the flavors did not live up to the promise of the menu.  Plus, key ingredients were missing from several dishes! The great: - the fingerling potato hash with pork belly - delicious flavors with well cooked pork belly.  We ordered these as an after thought, but I'm glad we did as it was the only outstanding dish we ordered -the space is really cute with eco-friendly touches (recycled plastic clipboards for the menus, cork tables, etc.) -dinner was under $25 each (incl tax and tip) for several small plates and 2 cocktails thanks to  savored.com   svrd.co/pHAC19 The ok-disappointing: -first off, there was no rabbit flatbread.  WHAT?!  This is one of the major reasons I wanted to try Province!  I don't think I got over my disappointment throughout the meal -duck meatballs - my other reason for wanting to come here.  I was excited about these because the duck dish they served at the Celebrity Chef Ball a month ago was memorable and was what prompted me to check out the restaurant.  It was good, but was not really special in any way.  Too bad, because I love duck. -cuban pork bocadillos - cute, but ultimately just a mini sausage on a bun with some yummy mustard -piquillo pepper-celery root soup - I expected a deep celery flavor, but this was more of a tomato-based soup.  It was ok, but not at all what I expected -apple salad - this stack of julienned apples was good, had nice acidity thanks to the vinaigrette, but there were no marcona almonds, which is the whole reason we ordered it! -pork & green chiles - the pork was probably the most tender I've ever had, but it was really fatty.  The green chile sauce was unexpected and quite tasty.  What ruined it was the undercooked rice.  Otherwise, this would have been in my list above. -market vegetables with aged sherry - the seasonal vegetables were supposed to include brussel sprouts, onions, leeks and fennel.  There was no fennel.  Hence, not a lot of flavor, and needed salt (but of course they don't put salt on the tables in the West Loop...)  When mixed with the delicious fingerling potato hash (above), however, it was quite nice. The cocktails were disappointing as well.  I ordered the Sage Advice (gin, sage and poached pear) and it was overwhelmingly sweet and underwhelmingly gin-ny.  My friend ordered the champagne cocktail and it was basically pineapple juice with a twist.  Chicago is such a cocktail town, I really expected more.  A note about the service: it was PAINFULLY SLOW.  Friendly and earnest, but slow.  Ordering, bringing out food, bringing the check, paying for the check, everything was a LONG process.

2011-11-05,5.0,"From the interior design to the small but delectable ""bites"", Province combines the whimsical with a modern sleekness that doesn't veer into pretentious austerity. Every item on its menu is fairly priced and they allow you to choose from bite-sized appetizers ($3) to entrees that do not break the $30 price point. Customers can even chose to sample two half-entrees, which I did. The scalable menu allows for sharing, which generates the kind of sociability that one would hope a dining experience would elicit. The quality of the food does not suffer with size-reduction. We sampled the small bites, including a perfectly crisp taco filled with tender squash, an appetizer of savory duck meatballs, and entrees of perfectly cooked salmon served with chimicurri sauce that had a hint of curry, and a slow-cooked lamb. Even the wine is affordable and excellent.  In addition to the stellar food, the staff went out of their way to please us. They actually believe in customer service: a rarity in itself. They were clearly understaffed and overbooked, but the manager himself came over to our table to take our orders within ten minutes. We were served two free and tasty appetizer samples as we waited. Our official waitress demonstrated the same attentiveness to us. We received a free dessert--a delicate pear tart--as well as complimentary wine: a generous compensation for a brief delay in service.  After many experiences of attempting to decipher menus that have been grossly embellished by thesaurus enthusiasts, being ignored by wait staff who seem to have little more to do than chat with each other, and waiting nearly an hour for my entrees, Province is a welcome respite and a real pleasure.",0.9973,0.738,0.237,0.025,0.5201149425287358

The rice had just enough bite and the assorted veggies were nice and crisp. Mmmm! While we waited for the main dishes, they brought over a little taste of beef carpaccio. I really appreciate it when restaurants add it treats like this and the meat was nicely done. (On the way out you also get a little pack of cookies, another nice extra.) For entrees we had a half portion of the braised lamb (really liked the option to do smaller plates) and the half chicken. Both were really tender and well seasoned, but the lamb was a bit heavy on the salt. Even with the smaller portion for one plate, we still ended up with lots of chicken leftover which made for excellent lunch leftovers.  For dessert we went with the pound cake.

Not exactly.  The food did not even satisfy the ""ok"" standard, never mind live up to expectations.  When we went in around 6pm, the restaurant was almost empty indoors.  As we started ordering, we asked the waitress what was good.  She said that you can't go wrong with this menu--everything is good.  Speaking of the menu, my fellow dining companions were actually quite amused by the menu, as it was given to us on something very similar to a clipboard.  The first page was the menu.  The rest of the 20 pages or so were wines. I started off the meal with the Seedlings Farms Peach Salad | market cucumbers, greens, pistachios, red wine crema, which the waitress recommended as ""amazing"", and was sorely disappointed: the first of many to come.  The peaches tasted nothing special, and the pistachios were scant at best.  In fact, I barely remember tasting pistachio in my salad. The sauce...while I'm sure is house made...tasted like it came from a pre-packaged container, something I can get at a high-end supermarket for a quarter of the price.  The mix of ingredients did not feel like they were at optimal proportions--the red wine taste was alienated from the cream, and they did not work out their differences and truly fuse together and form the perfect sauce.   I then ordered the Slow Cooked Organic Salmon | pickled ramps, green beans, green gazpacho salsa.  This too was a disappointment, as the sauce tasted bland and the sour taste of the ramps seemed to overpower the gazpacho and beans, so the well-rounded effect was not achieved.   Also, the dish was quite cold when it came out, as if it had been sitting for a while.  On top of that, the inside of the salmon was so rare that someone else who also ordered the dish at the table sent it back to be cooked some more, so she just sat without any food while the rest of us ate.  My mother ordered the Spice Seared Tuna Tacos | pickled cabbage, soy-mustard aioli, which was also quite bland; I could buy a very similar taco at some take-out place for a fraction of the price. (For $9, she got one tiny taco).  My father ordered the Ten Hour Braised Lamb | roasted eggplant, house made chorizo, corn bread, the restaurant's house specialty, and that was the only thing of the night that was descent.  The flavor was completely infused in the meat, and the soft roasted eggplant complemented the slight chewiness of the lamb.  Actually, the braised lamb had perhaps a bit too much seasoning, as it just tasted too salty and potent. Dessert was the worst experience ever.  My mom and I both ordered ice-cream, and it tasted worse than store bought ice-cream.  For a tiny, bite sized scoop, it cost $3, and my hibiscus sorbet tasted like ice with some artificial corn syrup.  My friend got the Seedling Farms Raspberries with Citrus Pound Cake and ice-cream, and my school cafeteria does it 10x better.

I got the stuffed trout which was nothing special and tried to tuna tacos, which were cold and not the best. The lemon drop coctail was AMAZING and would go back just for that and the WONDERFUL dessert. The peanut butter flan was the best!

It only comes with 2 but they are packed with tuna), Asparagus Salad (very refreshing and tasty). The only downer of the night was when some of the vegetable sides we had ordered never showed up. The waitress was very apologetic and the manager even came over to make sure we weren't upset. Despite us saying that we were not, they sent over some free desserts which were so good!

I got a chicken apple salad for lunch, and it was basically a plate of shoestring-cut apples. The carmelized olives sounded interesting but added more sweetness to an already sweet plate of apples. The few bits of chicken that were in there were slimy and bland.  The caesar salad was made with good ingredients, but a little heavy on the cheese for my taste.  We also got the Goat Cheese fondue which was pretty much a Con Queso. Not enough crackers for dipping but we ended up using our fries to scoop up the last of the tangy spicy cheese. The rhubarb pie is amazing and looks as beautiful as it tastes. Overall, I felt that the food here was fresh and made with lots of love.

2011-04-22,4.0,"I met a friend here for lunch today and I was pretty excited to try it after reading such positive reviews.  The restaurant is super stylish and reminds me of places in New York. The decor is sleek, modern, and striking, yet very comfortable.  I loved that they had a bin for your umbrella by the door so I didn't have to take it with me to the table and get everything all wet. It's the little things.  We had a nice booth and were immediately served our choice of still or sparkling water and given white wine crisps and butter biscuits with a delicious white bean and garlic spread. If this was any indication of things to come, they were certainly off to a good start because we really enjoyed their version of a bread basket.  I ordered the tortilla soup, and market vegetable salad (which changes seasonally), and my dining companion ordered the braised lamb. We also split an order of frites.  The tortilla soup was a small portion, but it was the perfect size. It was mildly smoky and spicy, and topped with smoked chicken, avocado, and tortilla strips. A great soup to warm my belly on a cold and rainy spring day.  Our main dishes arrived and the presentation of both dishes was beautiful. To be honest, I'm not even sure what all the vegetables in my salad were; I definitely could discern brussel sprouts (which i don't even like, but these were delicious) edamame, butternut squash (or was it sweet potato?) and maybe some eggplant. Regardless, the salad was fresh and crunchy and lightly dressed with a sherry vinaigrette and grated manchego cheese. It was a good sized portion but because it was not heavy, I didn't feel all gluttonous eating it.  I also was able to taste the braised lamb which was flavorful and melted in my mouth. Even though it was a lunch-sided portion, it was still plenty of food for my meat-loving friend. It came atop some sort of cornbread stuffing that I also got to sample and it went really well with the lamb. The frites were just average to me, despite the house made ketchup they were served with (not that it stopped us from eating all of them).  Service was spot on as well. Our server was able to answer questions knowledgeably but wasn't overbearing, and she was appropriately bubbly as well as understated. It sounds contradictory, but it's true.  I really liked Province and I imagine I would like it even more in the evening, when I'm not eating in a somewhat rushed fashion.

2011-04-18,4.0,"Province is the sort of restaurant that defines ""trying too hard"" - however, on effort alone I think four stars is fair even though I've been swaying back and forth between 3 and 4 prior to writing the review. Alas, Province is also the sort of restaurant that I wish 1/2 stars were available for on Yelp.  Our party of 4 had a 7:15 reso this past Saturday - we were seated on time (the place was relatively empty but did fill up as the evening went on). From the second that our server approached the table; I felt as though we were at judges table on Top Chef and that our server was in the bottom two fighting against elimination. Well, I guess in this instance it'd be the server channeling the actual chef - but the whole presentation of the menu felt so forced and pretentious it really took a lot for me not to laugh. Everything was described as ""fantastic"" and a menu that was actually quite simple to navigate was beaten to death with explanations; ""guides"" on how to order, etc that was really unnecessary. There's just something about a place that is TRYING. SO. HARD. to be ""foodie-ish"" that gets annoying.  Anyway - after what felt like a 30 minute overview of the menu we finally ordered.  Apps for the table:  1) Seared Sea Scallops |marinated roasted mushrooms, LW Farms greens - delicious  2)Blood Orange & Goat Cheese Salad | LW Farms greens, blood orange vinaigrette - pretty good  3) Beer Cheese Mac & Cheese | house made sausage, tomatillo salsa - sounded way better than it tasted  Mains:  1) Ten Hour Braised Lamb | roasted eggplant, house made chorizo, corn bread - nice and tender. My friend who is not a big lamb fan tasted mine and said it was the best he's ever had.  2) Miso-Chile Glazed Rare Hawaiian Tuna | edamame romesco, tortilla salad - pretty good; have had better similar dishes at many restaurants.  3)Grilled Beef Tenderloin | spanish blue cheese toast, buttermilk whipped potatoes - kind of bland, a bit fatty, not a highlight  4)Ancho Papperdelle Pasta & Sweet Fried Piquillos | roasted garlic, queso fresco  5)Becker Lane Farms Slow Roasted Pork Ropa Vieja | vanilla mashed sweet potatoes  6) Spice Seared Tuna Tacos | pickled cabbage, soy-mustard aioli  7) Side of Nichols Farms Fingerlings, Onions, Pork Belly Hash - probably the yummiest thing on the table  * anything I didn't comment on; I didn't try but was enjoyed by the rest of our party.  OK - so how delicious does this sound? ""Peanut Butter and Chocolate Flan ""Sandwich"" Yeah, I agree too - sounds delicious. So, how come it wasn't on the list of things we ordered? Well, that was the name of the dish - but here was the description on the menu: ""chocolate sorbet, meringue crisps, peanut crunch"" - NOT at all what I would expect which I think kind of sums up Province. There's a lot of adjectives, a lot of flair, a lot of ""trying too hard"" - but ultimately - what's behind it all is not necessarily what you're anticipating. Everything is good, but just a tad off from being great.  Also, although our server really was helpful at the start of the meal - he was relatively nowhere to be found once our food starting hitting the table. Cocktails also took 10-15 minutes to arrive at the table. Not cool.  Oh yeah, so back to my Top Chef comment at the start of the review. While the chef at Province did a fine job of executing most dishes, there was a bit too much style over substance and I think he may have made top 5 but there'd be others around long after he packed his knives and went.  Check it out if you haven't been - but don't plan on rushing to come back a second time.",0.9979,0.77,0.171,0.06,0.5066496598639455

Friendly bar staff, with quick minds on suggestions for cocktails. Decent wines and beers too.

Strange actually...Grade: B+ Food: considering the above, I've ordered a lot of different things here. They are all good. I'm not wasting time going through each one, since on most things one gets the choice of two or three sizes. If you think youll like something, order a larger size. If not sure, that's why you can get the small size so it's not a body blow. Easy peasy. grade: B+ Service: good. They have a strange tic however. More than a few times, multiple gentlemen bring out the various dishes to the table. Invariably, these poor guys can't keep all of this straight so like death and taxes you'll be directing these guys to transfer this plate over there or pointing to and fro. It seems trite, but again this is a regular thing and can be irritating.

There was an amuse-bouche which I don't remember the specifics of but there were several layers to it - despite being small, a lot of different flavors were packed into it. I ordered the beet salad with blue cheese and spiced pepitas. (I must admit that I ordered it because I LOVE blue cheese.) It was delicious. For my main course, I ordered the miso-chile glazed rare Hawaiian tuna. It was some of the best tuna I ever ate. It was perfectly seared on the outside and perfectly rare on the inside. I sometimes find that tuna is overcooked but this was perfect.  The edamame romesco was a nice compliment to the tuna and added flavor without overpowering it. Several of my dining companions ordered dessert, although I did not. Apparently the squash cupcake was amazing, and the honey ice cream was a nice compliment. Overall, the menu was pretty all-encompassing.  I find that restaurants like Province generally have a rather limited menu. Province is the exception offering a wide variety of dishes. The nice thing is that there were several different sizes of dishes so if there are several items you want to try, you can get small portions and order lots of different things. The space was very light and airy, and there's a patio which hopefully will be opening soon.  The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  All-in-all, a great dining experience.",0.9983,0.7,0.292,0.008,0.5524625850340137

There are a couple lunch items (and more on the dinner menu I believe) that offer different sized portions at corresponding prices.  As a fairly light eater, I think this is a fantastic option and really shows management's thoughtfulness as they opened their restaurant in a down economy.  For lunch, the caesar salad and the half portion salmon was a just-right amount of food.  Offering multiple portions also creates a comfort level for the diner being able to depend on this restaurant for a mid-priced meal or something slightly more upscale. Only negative I see for dinner is its location -just east of the Randolph street bars and restaurants, but a bit west of many pre-theatre spots.  But it's worth seeking out!",0.9523,0.819,0.142,0.039,0.497807621671258

We were visited by not only the manager of the restaurant, but by the chef/owner himself. The customer service was really just outstanding. The food was wonderful and shockingly ""upscale"" for the price! We had the mixed olives and a complementary amuse of eggplant ratatouille with goat cheese to start, then moved on to the beet and blue cheese salad, and the shrimp ceviche. That ceviche was phenomenal, and was by far the best thing we had all night. Bright, fresh, texturally perfect...YUM. We moved on to ravioli stuffed with ricotta and short ribs. While it was a little light on the beef, the rich jus more than made up for it. Next up was a slow-cooked salmon over leeks and fennel, which was melt-in-your-mouth good, and tuna tacos. The tuna tacos were a bit over-stuffed and over-sauced, but the flavors were delicious, as were the accompanying salsas. We had delicious sides of Brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes. And then, somehow, we found room for the chocolate hazelnut dessert!

That aside, Province is a great place to have dinner before catching an evening show. I always go around five thirty before heading to the CSO or Lyric. It is in a great location for that. Arriving early in the evening ensures that the staff will be more attentive.  They almost always are able to accomodate my dietary needs, and the vegan version of their selected amuse bouche is always delectable. I usually only have the french fries or vegetables, as those are the only vegan fare Province offers. I am not a culinary caper, and I am content with good fries.

I had the Alpha King and just about the time I had finished, my better half arrived and our feast commenced.

Our second round of Farm Raised Shrimp and Anson Mills Organic Grits | manchego cheese and the Seared Sea Scallops |marinated roasted mushrooms, LW Farms greens was more up my alley.

This was the second pre theater meal we had at Province and they had us out the door on time for the curtain. That's all I can ask from them.

A few weeks back we decided to finally try the three floyds/dietzler farm burger deal.  I met my fiancé at the bar after work.  He already had a beer and a small plate and wanted to close out the tab before sitting down.  The bartender was INSISTENT on keeping it open, to the point of being obnoxious about it.  That really put me off. I think I should have a choice of whether or not to carry the tab over or close it. But anyways........ We were seated in a nearly empty restaurant by the bartender, who was also hostess... and server? We received our menus and proceeded to wait a good 15 minutes until the bartender/waitress came to take our drink order.  Normally, I wouldn't mind, but this place was EMPTY. And she was yucking it up with her co-workers. Ughh this woman was pissing me off. When I told her that I wanted to do the three floyds/dietzler deal and wanted to know which three floyds beers were included she responded, ""Oh no, you can't. That's only the bar special. You have to be seated in the bar or the bar area."" ( I didn't know this)  WHICH I TOTALLY GET AND UNDERSTAND at a packed bar/resto with a sweet deal.. but this place.was.dead.  I told her that we would like to move back to the bar then, so we can enjoy this deal.  She says, "" Oh... well... I mean, I guess I can do it this once."" Yeah, you think? THERE ARE probably 5 other people in this whole place. Would you like to accommodate 2 of those customers? Additionally we were ordering small plates, multiple beers, etc. so it wasn't like we solely were here for the deal. All in all, the burger tasted like my father's delicious grilled burgers (he is an amazing chef, so this isn't a diss.. but if I can get them at home... why would I go out for them.. just saying), the ""ketchup"" was funky and the small plates were definitely lacking.  With that being said, I probably won't be back.",0.9873,0.848,0.115,0.037,0.4767710170487949

2011-02-27,2.0,"Overall, I was very disappointed with my dining experience here. Thesis: food = tasty, service = awful. There are better restaurants in Chicago. To start, they have a policy that requires large groups to order from a prix-fixe menu...which is obviously a ploy to increase prices. They are supposed to state this when you make a reservation of 8+ ppl. Also strange, they had regular menus placed at our 10 top table, and then did not let us order off of them. Of note, this was such a slow dinner. Our reservation was at 8:30 and we didn't leave the restaurant until 12. We didn't get any bread or the ""small bites"" until 9:20. It also took 30 minutes for our wine to come.  The positive: Food is inventive, flavorful. This would potentially be a good restaurant to go to for a small group, 4 or less.

2011-02-26,4.0,"I guess it's time I wrote a review for Province considering that I have 7 check-ins at this place as I'm typing this. This place has a very clean feel to it. The ceiling is high and the windows are floor-to-ceiling with white long curtains. Only the right wall screams pink but it's not out of place either. The decor is not overly done but it's not sparse either.  Everytime we come here for dinner, the food has been consistently good. If Chef Randy Zweiban ever had an off day, then it was definitely not on a day that we were there for dinner. The food is always well presented and thought out. The chef focuses on seasonal ingredients and while some items on the menu stay the same throughout the year, some are different depending on what's in season. One my favorite is the ahi tuna. It's lightly seared on the outside and rare inside. The almond wafer stack really is a must-try. I think it changed my life the first time I tried it. Pretty bold statement, I know. Oh and by the way, you have a choice of house-filtered still and sparkling water. On the way out, don't forget to take with you a house made cookie. They're good. On the days we're not there for dinner, we would be there just for drinks at the bar. Or sometimes we're there for the $10 burger + beer deal. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars and not 5 stars is that sometimes service at the bar is a little slow. We'd be sitting there for awhile before the bartender comes to take our order. I don't know if they're short staffed or what. But we have noticed that they do have quite a high turnover rate of employees. Matthew the awesome bartender is gone. Carlos the super friendly and chatty guy who helps out at the bar is also gone.

2011-02-25,4.0,"Restaurant week part II, woo-hoo! Province was actually my first taste of West Loop dining, and so far, I'm tres happy! Their restaurant week menu was a $33 three-course selection, and I chose the scallops soup to start, the duck as the main course, and the carrot cupcake as the dessert. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, and the soup was definitely on the spicier end. The scallops, though, were ridiculously tender and yummy. The duck actually reminded me of pulled pork - in a good way. Pieces of carrots and greens were mixed in, and though the portion itself didn't look large, it ended up being very filling. Dessert was the carrot cupcake with maple frosting and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. While that sounds incredible, I actually thought it was a bit too rich! I'm shocked that I feel that way, since carrot cake and maple frosting are two of my favorite things in the universe, but I think that the maple frosting was overdone in this case. I sort of wish I'd ordered the pear tart instead! (Excuse to come back, no?) The interior is modern and simplistic, certainly more casual than fancy. I'd come back here with family or friends, though probably not on a date (not cozy/intimate enough).

I normally dont care much about the background music (unless there isnt any at all and then the silence is deafening) but it was the only thing about the space I disliked. It was loud and bouncy music that was more of a distraction than anything.  I started off with the Spiced Spanish Piquillo Pepper Soup with Wisconsin cheddar toast.  The soup was a beautiful, bright red colour, that was intensely rich and fresh.  For the entree I chose the House Made Chorizo & White Bean Stew with caramelized onions and crispy manchego.  Although I felt the chorizo was more along the lines of an italian sausage, it was delicious as well as the stew. The dessert I chose was the Bosc Pear Cobbler with cinnamon ice cream and pear syrup.  I wish the cobbler had been just slightly warmer, but otherwise I can't complain. Sweet, intense pears matched up perfectly with the cinnamon ice cream.  It was just big enough to satisfy the sweet tooth without being obnoxious.   Even the regular menu looked great, with a lot of interesting choices and reasonable prices.  Mary made a great choice!

For me, that is where the good part ended.  Service took insanely long. A two course, promptly ordered meal took over two hours from seating to leaving. The waiter was absent for most of this time and rarely gave acknowledgement between courses. I ordered three courses, two to be served together first, then one for my main. The scallops served first were much to small to justify their price. I may have felt differently if it was not served with I would call BBQ sauce on the plate. Again, the price was doubly unjustified. I also had mussels which I thought would be presented traditionally, but was still flavorful.  This is what really prompted my review. I ordered the lamb, which was a horrendous mess. Knowing it was braised, I expected something rich and flavorful. Instead, I had dry pulled meat formed into a patty and accompanied by THE SAME BBQ SAUCE. I tried to eat a couple of bites, but eventually refused to pay for it. If the server was more timely or if he received any assistance from management, I may have been interested in an alternative. I would have liked to stay later and have dessert but the entire experience was a let down. After reading other reviews about the lamb on Yelp, I either question the palate of the reviewers or the validity of the reviews.

I had two small plates: the shrimp and grits and the eggplant and squash cannelloni.  They were both very flavorful and fresh--yum!  Mike obviously had the burger, which he loved, and we both enjoyed the fries.

They have an extensive wine list and reasonable prices.  We had a bottle of prosecco and a bottle of chardonnay...dont judge, we were thirsty. We ordered quite a few plates just to all share.  We started with flatbread pizza, goat cheese fondue, char ceviche.  All of which were great.  They also brought us a tasting of some sort of salad and other bean dip.  We also had the halibut which was over a stuffing type thing....so freaking good.  Of course, we couldnt pass up dessert so we got the white chocolate rum shots (super rich....and thick.  We took them as a shot but I think it might have been more enjoyable as a sipper) and this amazing wafer, ice cream thing....so good.  I basically had to roll my ass out of there.   The service was pretty good and made great recommendations.  I would definitely go back.",0.9912,0.765,0.206,0.029,0.5045274170274169

For our entrees- we split the halibut (half portion) over a corn pudding and some type of rice dish which had the consistency of risotto but had beets, pepper, spinach and corn in it. Sounds odd- but it was delicious.  The only thing that was bit off this time was the timing. Our server was terrific so I think the fault fell to the kitchen somehow as there was a huge gap between our appetizers and the entrees.

We tried the sashimi, watermelon and Serrano ham salad, corn and crab chowder, cockles, 12 hour lamb, flank steak, Spanish rice, and something else that I can't remember. For dessert we had the carrot cake and the lemon curd. Everything had such unique flavors, temperatures and textures and I savored every bite. The wine suggestions that our server gave us were spot-on (even though I admit that I doubted him at first). Each of us had five courses and three glasses of wine, and our bill was under $200 before tip. Wowza!

The waiter was nice but pretty obnoxious when we wanted to order an appetizer first, and then more food. If you are going to have small plates at your restaurant, than you should expect that people may want to order more as they go. The food was ridiculously over priced for the taste- it was NOT good. I ordered the flank steak, the waiter did not ask how I wanted it cooked, so I assumed it would be cooked however best for the dish.... well it was completely raw. not even rare, it looked and tasted like a warm gummy bear. it was disgusting and the waiter was pretty rude when I asked to have it cooked a little more. Of course then it came back well done. the greens, mushroom, and sauce combo underneath the steak were inedible. It might have been the worst dish I've ever had in my life. The drinks were very over priced too. Do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant, there are much better places to eat.

The server wouldn't allow me to substitute the veggies on the plate, but assured me I would enjoy it.  Unfortunately, I hated it.  They were uncooked, oddly shaped, and unrecognizable.  Too bad our server didn't return once during entrees.  And after dessert menus dropped, she puttered around the restaurant for 15 minutes before returning. One of my pet peeves?  When servers or managers ask what they can do to make you happier.  Just offer to do what you think is appropriate, or all of your guests would ask for a fully comped meal.

That part was fun - there's a neat canopy that covers the seating area and you're not squeezed up against other tables like a lot of other outdoor eating areas. Granted we were the only ones eating outside that day - but there seemed like there would still be enough breathing room if it were full. The prices didn't seem too bad - BUT only because I thought we were going to get the small versions of the meals. I don't need a huge amount to eat - but the waitress didn't ask us what size and we felt bad asking them to change it, so we ended up getting the ""larger"" portion. A little disappointed in the amount of food we got versus how much the bill ended up being! My boyfriend got a salmon dish ($25) and I had a rice dish (no meat and it was $19...). Food was okay - nothing spectacular. They do feed you some appetizers before the meal - it's a small amount, but it's interesting food and not your typical bread in a basket. Service was good and friendly. I have food allergies and the waitress was knowledgeable about how the food was prepared and she made sure my meal was free of the foods I'm allergic to.

Blue Cheese Fondue with crisps- 4 stars. Pretty darn good, a bit small for an appetizer, but I guess it just depends on how many people you have. Crisps were light and plentiful and the fondue was really well seasoned and not too rich. Caesar Salad- 5 stars by looks alone.

It tasted super fresh and was the perfect amount. 10 hour lamb- looked awesome, both the half plate and the full plate. Great colors and both sizes would keep you full til morning. Halibut-4 Stars. Half size--almost a little bit too small, but maybe that's because it was so good that I wanted more? I'm sure that was it. The halibut was simple but had enough flavor that didn't leave me bored. The mini artichokes were well seasoned and not too salty. Skirt steak--5 stars, I had a lil taste. Large and nicely seasoned plus capers. Only comes in the full portion, and that will leave you with leftovers or flying neighboring forks headed towards your plate. Cheddar burger with homemade frites and ketchup- So simple and looked great, especially the added value of the homemade fries and ketchup--which can also be added as a side for the table- great smokey flavor and a little bit of texture too! The dessert 5 stars!!--Two carrot cakes. This carrot cake was awesome. It was accompanied by what I think was pumpkin spice ice cream. I would highly suggest this, especially if you like carrot cake.

Oh and don't forget your delicious bag of shortbread cookies on the way out.  Simply lovely. Here's what my friend and I ordered..and I suggest you do the same! Spring Squash and Spring Onion Taquito Sal's Farm Raised Striped Bass Ceviche Fava Beans, Spring Onions & Spring Garlic Salad Slow Cooked Miso Glazed Tasmanian Salmon Ten Hour BBQ's Lamb (ooomg so good) Rhubarb-Orange Crispy Almond Wafer ""Stack"" This place is good for small groups, but even better for one-on-one time with a good friend or partner.  The friend I came with is a true foodie, who was equally as impressed as me!   Bon Appetit!",0.9912,0.771,0.21,0.019,0.5216071428571428
2010-04-18,3.0,"I came here last night for a GNO. It wasn't the first time I've been here, so I'll give a run down of the dishes I've tried in the past.  First and foremost, LOVE the complimentary amuse-bouche!! Everytime I've come, the amuse-bouch is innovative and impressive.   1) Cuban Pork Bocadillo (4 stars): Wish it wasn't a half size! Really juicy and tasty.  2) House Baked Salmon, Bagel Crisp, Herbed Cream Cheese (5 stars): Excellent blend of flavors and texture.  3) Blue Cheese Fondue (3 stars): I do appreciate the mass appeal and do agree it's well-deserved, but it's a little too heavy for me.  4) Spice Rubbed Grilled Ahi Tuna Taco (4 stars): I have to order this everytime. Just the right amount of acidity in this dish.  5) House Ground Cheddar Burger (4 stars): Quite a decent burger. The best part is the homemade ketchup that accompanies the crispy fries. Again, just the right amount of acidity. You have to at least order their fries and ketchup as a side item! 6) Ropa Vieja (3 stars): Honestly, this probably deserves a 4-star rating. However, it shares its name with one of my absolute favorite dishes in the whole world -- at Carnivale. Unfortunately for Province, Carnivale's interpretation is much better. I know, it's a harsh world.  7) Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes (4 stars): Made me say MAMA! Just a warning, their menu changes with the season (i.e. blue cheese fondue only in the winter months). I believe the food itself is overall 4-star worthy.  Usually, the service is average, but I had a take off a star for the poor service we had last night. Our server treated us like we were an inconvenience for him the entire evening. We caught him rolling his eyes when we asked questions about the menu (one friend has a severe, emergency room-sending pine nut allergy), and there were several audible sighs throughout the night, especially when there was a screw up on the bill. It was really unnecessary. We still tipped him 20%, but in hindsight I wish we stiffed him.

2010-03-30,4.0,"Went for dinner with the fam. The place is cool, hip, with modern decor and an inventive menu. An interesting fusion of American (i.e. grits, burgers) and Latin (i.e. pork belly, bocadillos) flavors/ingredients in separate and same dishes.   The service was great with an attentive, informed, and pleasant server. The food was good, though not 5 stars because it didn't blow me away. Their menu setup is interesting with a range of dish types/sizes which is great for variety and personalization, and though it is easy to go overboard and spend a lot, you can definitely pick the dishes to please your palate/appetite without breaking the bank.   Creme tartare was brought out before the meal (bonus!), pork bocadillos were good but not inspiring, brussel sprouts had a bit too much garlic (but were still good), pork belly french toast was interesting and quite good, pork confit was rich while not too complex. From my dinner mates, I'd say the Cobia (a deep-water white fish) was a bit too basic (almost bland) and the skirt steak was surprisingly good.    Don't forget the small cookies as you leave!",0.9874,0.772,0.207,0.02,0.5218390804597701

Highlights included the Cuban pork bocadillos, blue cheese fondue ( so good and so very very bad), the brioche french toast/pork belly ( we ordered a second it was SO good and you can never get enough syrup, right?).  They do a delicious short rib and the Tasmanian salmon was yummy. I don't remember ordering dessert but I do remember the chocolate 3-way paired w/ a gentle Muscat - perfect!!

2010-03-17,4.0,"The devil is said to be in the details.  This may be true.  However, sometimes the divine also inhabits the small spaces, the margins, the tiny touches that make a place stand out from the crowd.  Such it was for Province.   One of the best parts about going to a good restaurant is the feeling afterwards that ""wow, they really did everything right.""  The feeling that for a short while the world was in perfect harmony.  That's how we felt after leaving Province.  We were happy and satisfied, so much so that even the rain wasn't able to bring us down. We had a very early reservation, right as the restaurant was opening for Saturday night dinner service.  The hostess was very pleasant when we arrived, and both she and our waiter were very concerned with our timetable regarding any plans we had for the evening.  As we actually did have another engagement that evening it was nice to know they would be keeping in mind our timing needs. Our waiter was helpful, explaining their menu that can be a bit confusing on first glance.  Throughout the evening he was attentive, making sure drinks were filled, questions answered, and any issues dealt with quickly.  This extended to the whole staff.  Special kudos to the lady who brought us extra flatbread for our Bleu Cheese Fondue dish. Before our orders arrived there was a complimentary amuse bouche brought to the table.  A small cup containing mushrooms, garlic, and creme fraiche.  This was an excellent way to begin as it was chock full of flavors, with sweet and savory playing against each other and rousing the taste buds to attention. We began with splitting the Bites, one or two bite small dishes.  They were decent though not very memorable.  The shrimp, beans, chimichurri brioche bite was a nice touch to have as the cold shrimp served to contrast the warm shrimp in a later dish. Rather than going to the large dishes we decided to sample most of the small plates: - Melted Blue Cheese Fondue was addictive.  Tangy and with smoked onion strings clinging to the crispy flatbread.  One of our favorites. - Spice Rubbed Grilled Ahi Tuna Taco.  Spicy and fresh, it tasted like the ocean for lack of a better term.  I'm not usually much of a seafood eater, but this was enjoyable.  The salsa had a kick to it but not in the overpowering pure heat way.  It was a subtle heat that never made me feel like I was just eating fire. - Charred Calamari & Chorizo.  The least impressive dish.  The spicing seemed a bit off on this one.  It was too strong on the calimari, and the chorizo was a touch bland.  About halfway through this plate we threw in the towel.  Not a bad dish, but not their best by any means. - Brioche French Toast and Iberico Pork Belly.  I really loved this one.  The sweetness of the syrup and the saltiness of the syrup and the pork was a treat.  I was so glad that the mrs. isn't a big pork eater, as it meant I got to eat most of this dish.  I want to have a huge sandwich like this at breakfast one day.   - Farm Raised Shrimp and Anson Mills Organic Grits. When I have that breakfast sandwich, I WILL have this on the side.  This was awesome, the highlight of the meal.  The shrimp were warm and just seemed born to live inside these grits.  I'm sorry there's not a better description here of flavors.  But that is because this hit the real fifty taste bud group, the ""Holy crap that's Awesome!"" taste buds. We really weren't sure about dessert at that point.  We were full, but there has yet to be a dessert menu I won't take a look at.  Or usually order from.  We ended up getting three things.  She got the chocolate sorbet.  That was like chocolate and chocolate came together and created mega-chocolate.  I love rich foods, but this damn near was too rich even for me.  Note, I say ""near"", not actually too much.  Because it was great. I went for the scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a white-chocolate rum shot.  Here Province lies.  This isn't a shot.  This is a small milkshake of white chocolate, eggnog, and rum.  And it is glorious.  They should offer it as a full size drink and charge your immortal soul as the price.  They will sell millions of them and no one will mind the chance of an eternity in hellfire as a price to pay. I have nothing bad to say about our time there.  Sure a couple dishes weren't to die for, but really, for the amount we paid and what we ate, there is nothing to complain about or speak ill of.  The service, the decor, the bathrooms, everything about the experience was of the highest quality, the food had moments of excellence and was consistently very good.  So what the hell, let's give it the fourth star.  It's earned it.",0.9987,0.769,0.179,0.052,0.559543905168905

My wife's entree was the cobia - delish! I had the BBQ braised short ribs - really wonderful. The portion seemed a little small, but that might be because I liked it so much - I could have easily eaten another order! Other couple had the cobia and the skirt steak, which seemed to please.

2010-03-04,3.0,"My first foray into the world of Province was entered with some expectations, greeted by some disappointments, and finished with some exceptional pastry. When I arrived, my date was sitting at the bar. I checked in with the hostess and joined my date at the bar. The drink menu was open and after our happy greetings we chose to start imbibing on the Old Tom's Whiskers, a gin martini made with Ransom Old Tom Gin, Vya sweet vermouth, Dolin blanc vermouth, Grand Marnier, and orange but that tasted faintly of ginger. We ordered the martinis and waited ... and waited ... and waited. The two visible people behind the bar were busy washing glasses and milling about ... and not making drinks ... not for us, not for anyone. 20 minutes later, we got our drinks while 2 parties in the bar area had patrons raising their hands to get the attention of someone, anyone, to attend to their needs. By the time we were half way through our drinks our reservation came up and the hostess came to retrieve us.  After we were seated we perused the menu and were greeted with a secondary menu, the Restaurant Week Menu, that wasn't tempting our appetites. The value was good, but where's the value in ordering something just because it is a value? We started with the delicious Hamachi sashimi with sea salt and Serrano chilies and a small selection of west coast oysters on the half shell. The oysters were some of the smallest I've seen, but they were absolutely fresh and perfectly cold.  Our next selection was the Green Acres Farms Kobacha Squash Soup with squash dumplings and pepitas. The squash dumplings were very interesting and delicious and had a wonderful texture. The soup they sat in was less like squash and textured more like cream of tomato. The dish did not, however, pair well with another selection Melted Blue Cheese Fondue with smoky onions and herbed crisps ... which reminds me that our very first taste was an amuse provided by the chef of whipped crème fresh with chive and musky hedgehog mushrooms; totally delicious. A secondary offering were chipotle cornbread ""doughnuts"" with the same herbed crisps that arrived with our blue cheese fondue. Anyway, just a note on service: if your customer is ordering two dishes to share and you know the flavors might not go together, you might want to encourage them to order them separately ... or at least serve them separately. We next ordered the Brioche French Toast and Iberico Pork Belly with chipotle-honey syrup and the Gunthorp Farms Rabbit Confit with salsa verde, marcona almond emulsion. The pork belly was served sandwich style between two very thinly sliced pieces of brioche French toast and one of the stand outs of the evening for me. I could eat that for breakfast every day and even thought of ordering it for dessert. The pork belly was infinitely tender, perfectly seared, the toast was pillowy soft and the chipotle-honey syrup was akin to a sophisticated morning syrup. The rabbit confit, on the other hand, was a salt bomb. The dish was overpowered by salt which almost totally covered up with taste of the rabbit. The marcona almond emulsion tasted of raw garlic and the salsa verde was replaced with some julliened and fried carrot (I think). Our last dish for dinner was the Rare Hawaiian Tuna with honey roasted root vegetables and caper vinaigrette. The tuna was perfectly seared but the crust was overly-salty. The honey roasted vegetables were tasty, but they were so finely diced we had a hard time figuring out what they were. We decided there was definitely carrot and parsnip, after that, who knew. The capers look like they were part of the roasted vegetables and the sickly looking vinaigrette was a messy puddle strewn about the plate. Drink service throughout the evening never improved. Too, I thought the smaller 12 ounce martini glasses were cheap looking while being expensive for their size.  The stand outs at Province were the attentive service of our busboy, Carlos, and the desserts. Despite the sparkling/still water mix up more than once, we lauded Carlos with praise at the end of the night. Typically I leave desserts alone at restaurants, but they had my favorite ice cream, cinnamon, and my date was pondering chocolate. In the end we got the PERFECT cinnamon ice cream and the Spiced Lemon Sour Cream Pound Cake with frozen lemon yogurt, and a ""rose"" of Klug Farms apple compote. The cake was refreshingly citrus and had a wonderful brown crust and moist light interior. As we were celebrating my birthday they also brought out there Seedlings Farms Pear Tartlet with vanilla bean ice cream and vanilla-honey drizzle with a candle stuck in it. The pear tartlet is on their dessert menu which I so very much appreciated. I've rallied against the ""Special Birthday Dessert"" before, so this was a nice surprise. The pastry of the tartlet was nothing short of perfection. The desserts and Intelligentsia coffee were a very nice way to end our evening at Province.",0.9993,0.805,0.165,0.03,0.5543765262515262

To be fair, my only experience here was during restaurant week.  Honestly though -- wouldn't you think that they would showcase their best and brightest in hopes of creating more regular clientele?   Anyway, on with the review --  Cocktails -- we enjoyed the Champagne cocktail and the Pimlico Grid.  Both were nice but, as expected, the Pimlico Grid was the standout of the two.  Amuse Bouche -  roasted mushrooms with cream.  As another reviewer stated, the cream was a little heavy but the flavor was nice. Bites and Oysters -- yes, we are piggies and added a few things to our restaurant week menu.  The oysters were nice but the shrimp, white bean and chimichurri brioche toast bites were completely flavorles.  Starter -- Both my husband and I had the salmon parfait.  I didn't expect the juice sized cup filled with avocado, salmon and cream.  Two inches of cream at that.  Very hard to enjoy with the tasteless cream on top.   I ate as much as I could stand and had to forgo the rest...it was too much work to dig through everything for the salmon.  Entrees -- My husband dug the sole dish that he had.  It had a wonderful flavor and was a nice sized portion.  I made the mistake of having the Market Squash Rice.  The rice was undercooked and the taste was really bothersome after one or two bites.  I ended up playing a game of Hungry, Hungry Hippo with my husband's fork to try to steal bites of his delicious sole! Dessert --  I enjoyed the carrot cake (by far the best part of my meal) and my husband had the pear tart which was delish.

2010-02-28,4.0,"As a ""farewell cheers"" to Restaurant Week 2010...my review of Province.  My travel schedule wasn't overly cooperative with gluttonous wishes, however...a last-minute Tuesday opening allowed for a bit of RW indulgence. Province, here we come! (reservations via Open Table, easy peasy) Truthfully, I'm always a little peeved with the ""industry"" backlash over Restaurant Week. Yes, I understand increased traffic can be...well, more work, and that prix fixe dining can occasionally result in undertipping, etc.  However, I do think the pros outweigh the cons, otherwise the restaurants wouldn't sign up to participate year after year. That's my two cents...and I'm a person that goes out to eat OFTEN, and enjoy Restaurant Week as much as the next. Do I have the money to pay full price? Indeed, I do. But, I love a deal. So, there we go. I digress. (Of course, tipping a few extra bucks if your server works their tail off is ALWAYS encouraged).  That being said, Province was SPOT ON service-wise. From reservation to ""byebye"" with cookies, I was very impressed. We were seated promptly, brought regular menus AND the RW menus (without having to ask sheepishly for them, like at other places) and our very attentive and excellent server pitched the RW menu as a great way to try some seasonal items not on the menu.  I opted for that menu (irresistible) and my date decided to try his luck with a little less prix fixe. Both decisions were well-advised :)  Drinks: pinot noir, perfectly served in small carafes. Selection of various waters, with various bubble makeup. Never did either fall below an ""is this empty?"" line.  Amuse bouche: creme fraiche with mushrooms. Cute, but a bit heavy.  Appetizer: Salmon ""parfait."" Also good, but a bit heavy. Salmon was very fresh, but cream was overwhelming and thick.  Entrees: *Duck Confit: Lovely. Very good, a bit salty, but overall just delightful. *Burger/Fries: standard, and no complaints from the other side of the table.    Dessert: Carrot cake + coffee = sealed the 4 star. Light and fluffy with a decadent cream cheese frosting. Well portioned, perfect for two.  Again, the service was the shining star of this meal (well, and the carrot cake) and much props to Province for handling the influx of RW diners with grace and style. Our server was exceptional.  Ambience is understated sexy, very sleek, but warm. Great for groups (private back room probably seats 12-15 comfortably).

We were seated in the back private party room - which was not a great idea to have open for the special occasion. The lighting was way too bright and we were separated from the rest of the dining room with about 4 other random couples/groups. It was just a bit akward, but a lovely room for a large private party...we were given the choice to sit in the bar area, but since we had reservations I'm really not sure why we weren't seated in the main dining room with all the other patrons...but I'm over it because when the little tacos came to the table I was in love. They are deep fried, crunchy little bites of goodness. They have squash in the center and its hearty and perfectly baked (? not sure if its baked, but I think it was then deep fried in its little shell). Let me backtrack to the salmon-creme fraiche something or other we were given after we were seated, compliments of the chef. That was delicious too, and a nice added touch. For my starter I ordered the tortilla soup. I order this soup 8 times out of 10 when I see it on a menu, so I know my tortilla soup (from restaurants). This version was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and the perfect amount (not too much). It had avocado, chicken and tortilla strips which I kind of feel are a pre-req. I tasted my fiance's ceasar salad and it had a special spanish spice that stepped it up. Next I had what I recall as being mexican rice - but it was actually risotto with Latin flavors. I love risotto and I loved this dish. It was cheesy but with the added flare of winter vegetables. It felt like a treat. I tasted my fiance's chicken with leek bread pudding- amazing. For dessert we had chocolate mousse cake for 2. Or for 6. We couldn't make a proud effort/dent and I felt it was too rich for me. I'm guessing we ordered the wrong thing for our tastes.

We had  salmon tartare, duck confit, pork belly/french toast small place, soup, shrimp  and polenta, and 2 desserts. Besides the polenta, which was good, everything else was either ridiculously bland or disgustingly salty. When my boyfriend thinks something is salty, it really is so I was surprised when he agreed with me that the duck confit was inedible. The waiter realized we didn't touch the dish and asked if we wanted something else, but at that point, I was too disappointed in the whole establishment. I don't understand how the chefs can send out food like that. Do they even care about taste?!? The only reason why Province even gets two stars is that the service was good and the dessert was good.

This was our first dining experience at Province, and I'm thinking it was our last. The 30-minute wait aside, we weren't overly impressed with this place. I had commented during dinner that my favorite thing about the place was that the server took both my fork and knife when clearing the table between courses... We went for Restaurant Week, but after having less than stellar experiences with the Week in the past at other spots, we opted for the regular menu. We started with two of the bites - the shrimp and the pork. Now the pork was tasty, but I'm not sure it was a $3 bite. K started with the (deconstructed) beet and blood orange salad, and I tried the shrimp and grits. K wins on this course. The salad had some great goat cheese, and the combo of the slightly sweet beets with the tart blood oranges was nice. The grits were nice and creamy, yet they were overly salted, so much so that I was chugging glasses of water to get the salty taste out of my mouth. Ick. For main courses, K got the seared ahi tuna, and I ordered the skirt steak. No winners here. The ratatouille with K's tuna tasted like it was drowning in vinegar (very acidic!), but the tuna was seared well. My skirt steak was on the rarer side of medium rare and was under seasoned. The chimichurri was more oil than anything, and was also under seasoned. Too bad I couldn't take from the grits and give to the steak. The potatoes that accompanied the steak had an interesting flavor combo; maybe a bit overpowering for the steak. K and I are usually members of the clean plate club when we dine out, yet this time we weren't, and we didn't feel bad about it. We even passed on dessert (another shocker for us!).

The slow cooked salmon, skirt steak with chimichurri, and pounded chicken breast are also favorites. The mignonette that comes with the oysters is perfect as are the seasonal fruit tarts. You are also given an amuse bouche. Last week's seared steak tartar with chive creme fraiche was amazing! The service is great but more personable at the bar.

It was tough to choose--so many great options on the menu--and we loved seeing familiar farms represented (definitely missing the Green City Market this time of year!). My champagne cocktail was delicious, and the wine list was extensive and well-priced. The reasons I'm giving Province three stars were the service and the ambiance. We arrived on time for our reservation and were told it would be a couple minutes. Almost 20 minutes later, we were seated. The hostess never gave us an update or even apologized. Our server was attentive but aloof (if that makes sense). Opinions on atmosphere are subjective, of course, but the stark, white interior felt cold and boring to me.

Friday night double date: Province it was. From the moment we walked in, the hosts were warm and welcoming. We were treated to a great booth at the front of the room and greeted with a bit o' the old bubbly. Drink orders taken, bubbles clinked and downed, onto the menu we go. The myriad of starters to whet our anxious appetites included the fantastic Cuban Pork Bocadillo mini-sandwich bites (one half per person - each of us wishing a full sandwich was an option), the house bread and crackers were excellent especially with the curry spread, the octopus was surprisingly tender and rich (though warm. I think I was expecting it to be cooler and the flavors might have benefited from it), my favorite member of our group ordered the pork belly and shrimp salad which... truth be told, we all wish we'd have also ordered. It was fantastic, despite how odd that combination sounds. Our dear server suggested that if we wanted to sample, we should pick half plates (""big"") as opposed to full size portions (""bigger""), so one of us did. The chicken was tender and flavorful, the pork ropa vieja was smoky and lovely if not ever so slightly one-note. That would be a perfect amuse but is also best done as a ""big"" option (and is not offered as ""bigger""). The lamb was buttery smooth perfection with layered, rich flavors. We ordered the buttermilk whipped potatoes which never arrived (and we forgot to see if they made it onto the bill) but truly, by the end of our meals we were all so stuffed and happy, potatoes would have tipped us over the edge...  ...which is what I would have said had you asked about those potatoes before they sent out two extra desserts.

I arrived with my girlfriend on a very rainy Thursday. It wasn't terribly crowded, mostly filled with after-work folks trying to loosen their ties with a stiff drink or three. We were a bit underdressed, by comparison, but that didn't matter. We were welcomed just the same, and seated pretty much immediately. Our server, Rosie, approached the table after we settled down and asked if we'd been there before, and since we hadn't, she gave a rundown of how the menu works (the small/big/bigger business). Although I had already checked out the menu a bit from home, it was nice to get a breakdown.  We were brought a little amuse bouche a few moments later. A bit later, Rosie returned and took our order. We each got a tortilla soup. My girlfriend ordered a half portion of Tasmanian salmon, and I kept it simple and got a cheddar burger.  A plate of crispy bread and dip came while we waited. It was decent--not fantastic--but decent. After a while, the entrees came out. My burger, and her ahi tuna. She didn't order ahi tuna, you say? A gold star for those paying attention. They took back the ahi tuna, and our server came back a few minutes later asking if she did, in fact, order the salmon. We wrote it off as a miscommunication, and she apologized. A bit later, the salmon did come out, and it was delicious. The tortilla soup? Really good mixture of flavors. Be sure to give it a stir first to get the avocado mixed in well. My burger was cooked medium well, as requested, and the fries that came with it were salted and peppered. So, why would I rave about service from a place that brought out the wrong order? Glad  you asked. You see, our server realized her mistake, and didn't argue. She kept her composure the entire time (as did we, we were not rude in the slightest) and was always friendly. However, she went beyond that. You see, we had ordered some fruit juices with our meal. When my cranberry juice ran low, she replaced it with a new one, no questions asked. Then, at the end of the meal, she asked if we would like dessert, and after some deliberation, we went with the delightful Chocolate 3 Ways. Our server came back later and explained that the ahi tuna that was brought out originally cost $3 more than the salmon we actually ordered. To rectify everything, Rosie told us that our drinks and dessert were on the house.  We were really pleased with the way a small hiccup was handled so smoothly, and when you couple that with tasty dishes, you can't go wrong.",0.9956,0.812,0.147,0.041,0.4865765575004705
2009-09-16,3.0,"went to province last night with an out of town guest, have mixed feelings about the experience. since my friend hasn't arrived yet so i started at the bar and got to know Carlos who is a staff there and Paula who is the book keeper, they were definitely enthusiatic about the restaurant, gave me a lot of good recommendations as to what to order and i absolutely enjoy meeting them. Once my friend arrived, we moved onto our table. Ordered the taquito, shrimp and grits and calamari as our starters (for the record, i was not confused about the bites, small, big, bigger portions, thanks to yelp reviewers' tips and i thought the amount we ordered was perfect for our appetites) I wasn't crazy about the corn bread, perhaps i was spoiled by the version Table 52 has and theirs were scrumptious. The corn bread at province was cold and too dense for my taste. The taquito was good, light and clean. The shrimp and grits was ok, the shrimp was a bit small and slightly over salted, the grits was tasty but to be honest, it was not a standout as other reviewers said. The calamari, however, was not good at all. As another reviewer pointed out (I should have heeded the advice), there was just too much pickle taste to it. We both had one bite and left it. I ordered a half order of tuna on edamame and spinach and boy, was that a good choice! super yum, one of my all time favorite tuna dishes. My buddy ordered the flatiron steak and he loved how the steak was cooked but not too crazy about the sauce, i guess the chimichurri description was not quite accurate, the sauce tasted more like bbq sauce which was not what he expected. Since i only had half order of tuna, i did order the corn chowder as well and i find it quite tasty, wouldn't say its mind blowing but pretty good.  I had a rose at the bar and a pimm's cocktail at the table, neither blew my mind (i honestly love the pimm's cocktail at the wit bar more, sorry) all is all, it wasn't bad, slightly above average.

2009-08-22,5.0,"I'm going to be bold, here.  Wait for it...  Province may be my new favorite restaurant.  Sorry, Duchamp, I still love you (perhaps more fish on the menu?) Before I go into the sordid details of what I ate, I first have to explain the menu: Bites: 2 bites, to be exact Small: reference example - about  1/2 to  cup of ceviche Big: reference example - ahi tuna taco, pretty decent sized, but just one Bigger: ""normal"" sized entrée (more on that dubious word in quotations later), but most come in half sizes, too These sizes are all very appropriately priced, too.   I had a bite and a half portion of a bigger, and my friends either had a small and a big or a small and a half portion of bigger.  We also got three sides for the five of us.  This was the PERFECT amount of food for us.  Disclaimer: I'm a small girl who tries to watch her weight most of the time.  Unless you're the same type of person, skip the rest of this paragraph.  Here's the thing: a typical night out when I'm trying to be healthy is salad (dressing on the side, of course) and fish.  Salad fills me up and when the fish is put down in front of me I KNOW I should only eat about half of it.  Come on, we all know why obesity is such an epidemic in our country.  We just don't get portion control and how much we should actually be eating.  A ""portion"" of meat is the size of a deck of cards.  Have you ever gone to a restaurant and seen a portion that small? But, I end up eating most of it (ok, ok - ALL) and need to have a long run the next day to atone for what should have been a light meal.  It was healthy, I just ate too much.  So, Province, thank you for helping me not have to run extra today. Having gotten all that out of the way, here's what I had: Squash taquito: very yummy, would recommend it, but I'm not obsessed with it which means I would definitely try one of the other wonderful things on the menu next time.  This thought brings me to... Tuna over spinach.  Oh. My. God.  I've never had tuna better.  I will have a hard time next time I go, NOT getting this again.  Which is a shame, really, because everything else looks so good. I also had both of the veggie sides - one was mixed seasonal and the other was vidalia onions and edamame.  Both were incredible, fresh and flavorful.  We also got the frites and homemade ketchup.  Liked the frites, didn't care for the ketchup.  The one (teeny, tiny) miss for me.  I'm just a fan of the sugary stuff in the bottle, but I get it: why would you want to pair your delicious homemade frites with something with a 2 year shelf life? Alas, we didn't share (a downside of the smaller plates), so the portion of this review with my personal opinion on the food has ended.  But, I can tell you my friends loved everything they had which included: Chicken avocado soup Ceviche Caesar salad Ahi tuna taco Salmon Rabbit Oh, and the wines - good list, but I got the house white for $6.  I really liked it (and I MAY be a bit of a wine snob) and the price. The ambiance was very pretty - really cool white tree branches hanging down from the ceiling, a wall of wine... Very big and airy space. And so, I am brought to my only complaint of the night.  (I shared this with the manager as well when he nicely came by to see how things were - I love when they do that).  The waitress, while really sweet and attentive (I do NOT mean to disparage her in any way) went a bit overboard explaining the portion sizes.  She perfectly explained them and should have left it at that.  She then told us a million times that most people order four items and questioned each of our orders as we made it, saying it wouldn't be enough.  (And as I said earlier, it was the PERFECT amount).  It was kinda pushy and I didn't like it at all.  I get it, portions are smaller, but I do know how hungry I am and how much (or little) I can eat and be satisfied.  Don't make me tell you that - it's embarrassing for me.  Almost as embarrassing as the time a waiter (at another place) questioned when I just ordered a salad and an appetizer for dinner and I had to explain - in front of the head of my company's division, not to mention a dozen of my peers - that I was watching my weight.  Anyway, I don't fault the waitress: maybe there have been a ton of complaints from people who were upset about the portion sizes, or maybe she gets pressure from the man to get people to order more food. (I'm going to believe it's the former, not the latter). But, all in, I had a great experience, a great dinner and cannot wait to come back!",0.9988,0.779,0.163,0.057,0.4922312935177013

I had some sort of grilled fish sandwich with some frites.  It was all very excellent and tasty.  Everything served was presented uniquely and attractively.  There was some sort of iced tea (lavender, I want to say) we all ordered and knocked back freely.

2009-08-18,4.0,"If chic and sexy is what you are in search for, I've found it.  I had eaten here a few months ago, but am now writing the review. Seeing a menu arranged by portion, the way Province does, was a first for me; bites, small, big and bigger.  Since then, I am starting to notice it more frequently.  It is such a great idea, it gives the diners, especially the foodies the opportunity to see what the chefs have to offer, without getting too full. We started with the pork taco and bocadillo as our bites.  The taquito is not currently on the menu, but believe me, I could have eaten 5 or 15 more of these.  The bocadillo was alright in comparison. The big portion was next.  I ordered the praised Rabbit confit with marcona-almond emulsion.  The rabbit was delicate to the touch, and the almond emulsion paired perfectly when mixed together and sipped with the preferred white wine.  My friend and I also ordered the buttery light alaskan halibut served with a preserved meyer lemon.  The lemon could have been eaten by itself.  It brightened up the dish and our palette immensely. Instead of going bigger, we went big again, and shared the ropa vieja.  My friend enjoyed this so much, he wished that he just ordered the full portion for his entire meal. Of course the meal wouldn't be complete without trying their homemade ice cream and sorbets.  I had the frozen lemon yogurt, which just divine. My bud had the apple cinnamon sorbet, which was good and sweet, but I wouldn't have ordered it over any of the other options.  Oh yeah, we ordered the chocolate shots also.  I wouldn't recommend the wasting the calories on it.  Sure it tastes good, but anybody can take a bunch of chocolate syrup and rum, mix it together and serve it into a shot. I would definitely recommend Province.  It has a great, clean, chic atmosphere, at superb prices.  A perfect setting for a date spot. Great Valet service as well.  The guys let me keep the car parked out front, and when I showed up at sepia a couple weeks ago, they clearly remembered me.",0.9987,0.733,0.255,0.012,0.5355013550135501

First off, there weren't a ton of us, just 16 hungry people. And we arrived at 8 pm on a Thursday, not a busy Thursday at that. The thing that got me the most was the slow, slow, slow service. Yes, we ordered tons of appetizers and a lot to eat, but it took forever for them to come out. We felt like the meal dragged for hours, and it did. With some course we got some very dry, very boring corn bread balls. Avoid those. The hummus was decent at best. However, the shrimp & grits appetizer was very, very good. For dinner get the 10 hour braised lamb. Very good, very tender, nice spice in there somewhere. This restaurant falls short, though, because it is a stereotypical restaurant with a fancy one word name, bar feel inside, fancy comfort food, etc. It deserves a big ""meh.""",0.9777,0.801,0.16,0.039,0.5545000000000001
2009-07-27,5.0,"Another free slice of Frenchness. What is the ultimate opposition in French life, the one that defines all others once and for all and has shaped the face of the country for decades? No, it's not the red wine/white wine one. Nor even the Bordeaux/Bourgogne one. Or the old butter/olive oil for that matter. It is the Paris/Province polarity. Which verges more often than not on rivalry. Parisians just think that their city is the best of the best. Nothing compares and nothing is worth comparing to anyway. The rest of the country is just a big playground where they go on vacation (they call Normandy the '21st arrondissement'), but it is filled with rustic people who don't have the slightest clue about sophistication, refinement and good taste. Provincials think that Parisians are just rude snobs who forget about their roots. Paris is overrated anyway, too polluted, too expensive and not green enough. And where do they get their wine and nice produce from anyway? They are both right, and wrong. In any case this Chicagoan Province is indeed very Parisian in spirit. Nothing remotely 'provincial' about it. It's sleek, modern, elegant, design and damn trendy.  Fuschia accent walls, a striking series of food close-up shots, a glass cellar/partition wall, dark floors and lots of clean, organic lines where petrified-looking wood competes with succulents and fresh flowers. They call it 'farmhouse aesthetic'. It sums up the best of both worlds. And it really does. I was impressed during the whole time I was there.  Starting at the bar where I thought I would have to stick with water to discover a barmaid only too pleased to prepare me a fantastic virgin 'mojito like' concoction that made me forget I was being a sober gal. And who else offers a choice of still and Italian sparkling water?!? And complimentary amuse-bouche? And a home-made bread basket?  I hope it becomes a trend because I love it. The food. Of course.  I am a big fan of the carte which proposes something for every appetite from bites to what they call 'bigger' dishes. It's fun, creative and mouth-watering. So French in inspiration. We didn't go all the way in a (failed) attempt to be moderate but here is the list of what we had: - (small) Grilled calamari with avocado, piquillos (small Spanish peppers - try them stuffed with cheese they are to die for) and market onions: overall the less successful of the batch. Nice spicy smoky flavor but too tomato-y and not 'grilled' enough. - (small) Shrimp and organic grits with manchego cheese: probably the best version of the dish I have had in a while. Very nice texture, baby shrimp but perfectly cooked and the cheese is a great addition. - (big) Smoked brisket, pickled cabbage, horseradish mustard: my date's choice. I am not a big fan of the dish but had a bite and it was really good. He loved it. - (bigger) Rare hawaiian tuna with honey-soy vidalias, edamame, spinach and caper vinaigrette: wonderful. The flavors come together in the most delicious of ways. It's light, punchy, refreshing but also very satisfying. If you get the full portion, you get two pieces of fish of about 4 ounces each. Copious but you will lick the plate. - (bigger) Ten hour braised bbq'd lamb with smoked onions, chorizo and cornbread: so, so good even though I didn't really tasted the chorizo. A dish to warm up your soul and really reminiscent of Morocco. Smoky, savory and pungent. - (dessert) Chocolate three ways: flan, sorbet and gooey muffin with dulce de leche. Nice and rich but a little too uniform in flavor if not in textures. A real success. Oh - and I know that there is not much French about this place. It's Modern American cuisine with big Latin influences. But...you know....",0.9993,0.741,0.217,0.043,0.5071690214547357

Main dishes - we got 1/2 orders of the Pork Ropa Vieja and Rare Hawaiian Tuna, an order of the Flatiron Steak, and the onions/fingerlings/pork belly hash.  The ropa vieja had an interesting, spicy flavor, but I would not get it again.  You just kind of ate it to eat it, it wasn't like it was so good you wanted more of it.  The flatiron steak was cooked perfectly and was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The most amazing part of the entire meal was the tuna.  I can't even describe what was so good about it, but we all just wanted more and more of the tuna - we practically ordered another order of it!  Definitely get the full order of tuna - a half is just not enough!   For dessert we got the Chocolate 3 Ways and Pound Cake.  You can't go wrong with chocolate, ever... the pound cake was pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. I thought we got the perfect amount of food, but I know my husband walked out a little hungry.  However, when we put in our order and asked our waiter if he thought we were ordering enough, he did kind of say that we could go with a little more food, and that we could always get something else at the end of the meal, so the fact that some may have been still hungry was our fault, not the restaurant's. Overall, 5 stars is for certain dishes we got that blew our minds (tuna!) and great service.  Thanks, Province!  I'll be back when I'm craving your tuna!",0.9973,0.746,0.211,0.043,0.5987824675324677

Framing: My better half does most of the cooking in our home and is out of town this week. Thus, I have been exploring lots of restaurants to avoid cooking and experiment. Province is around the corner from one of my favorite restaurants, Blackbird, so I thought I would try it out. I was alone and my final bill, including wine, soup, and entree, was $60.21. (5/13 9pm) Food: Good but not great. I had the grilled shrimp cheese grits because, well, who can resist this combination? Shrimp was good, grits ok. A nice savoury appetitzer but nothing I would write home about. Actually reasonably priced at $9, however.  For my entree, I had the beef tenderloin, which was oddly topped with two very small crackers with blue cheese on top of lumpy but tasty buttermilk mashed potatos.  In general, I thought the food was flavorful and well prepared. This would bring me back to the restaurant, though it would not be high on my list. Service: My waiter was pretty poor but I noticed the others were very nice and helpful. Perhaps my guy was new? It was my first time at the restaurant and I mentioned that to him, asking him if he had any recommendations or suggestions for new diners to udnerstand the menu. (I mean, the menu is ridiculously confusing: small, big, kindof bigger, bigger bigger, etc) I had no idea what most of it meant, nor how much I should order. The waiter mumbled something about the building being LEED certified and told me he woudl give me a few moments to look at the menu. THAT'S IT!!!  Was he suggesting I tour the building instead of having dinner? Besides that, my wine glass sat empty for a bit too long before he thought to ask if I wanted more. Decor - Here is where I am a little stumped. I read the reviews of the amazing decor and perhaps had my expectations too high. Yes, it was classically minimalist, but I always find it hard to say that minimalism  is ""amazing"". I mean, my desk in my office is very clean, uncluttered, and has no knicknacks and chotchkes. Very minimalist but not something to be photographed for Architectural Digest.

First, the positives -- the drink I ordered was unique and delicious and not even overpriced at $9. It was a gin, pomegranate & thyme liquor cocktail. Also, the music was awesome. I heard Andrew Bird, Of Montreal & MGMT to name a few. Service and decor were also great. Now for the one criticism and the reason for 3 stars....the complimentary apps were actually 2 bites (literally) of food given to each of us.

2009-02-23,5.0,"I read about Province in an enticing article from the Chicago Tribune and I was really excited about trying this new place out. It was recently opened in Fall 2008. The restaurant is proud to advertise that the entire restaurant was constructed using eco-friendly, sustainable materials. Province supports the Chicago's Green City Market, and they only serve sustainable seafood. To be honest, while dining there I really didn't understand what sustainable seafood meant. I understood the construction part with sustainable materials but being the nerd that I am, I looked it up on wikipedia. ""Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally-destructive fishing methods,"" from  wikipedia.org . I was really impressed with their green movement and concern for the environment, it seems to be a major concern restaurant's entire concept.  The menu can seem a little overwhelming at first due to the large number of food categories. ""Bites, raw, soups/salads, small, big, bigger, and vegetables."" However, your server will explain the whole dining experience and which items they recommend. The bites category is literally just a bite size portion. Our server brought out a smoked Tasmanian salmon bite (on the house) which had Serrano peppers, garlic aioli, cucumbers, and olives. It was a small bite but packed with tons of flavor.  I then had the Tortilla soup which was really rich and had a great thick broth. It had a spicy hint to it with guacamole and shredded, grilled chicken in it. It was fantastic.  The bread that they put on each table was great too! They offered a spicy cornbread biscuit and roasted garlic flatbread with a white bean puree. The also offer complimentary flat or sparkling water.  We decided to try and order things from all over the menu. So we ordered the Pork Ropa Vieja which was amazing! It was slow roasted pork with a sweet and tart taste. It had a very rich, Pan- Latin flavor with cranberries, carrots, covered in a delicious sauce. It was served with mashed vanilla sweet potatoes.  We also ordered Spice Rubbed Grilled Ahi Tuna Taco with Serrano chile tartar salsa. I really didn't like the taco too much. I don't know if it just didn't match with everything else I ordered but I didn't care too much for it.  My favorite dish, which I am still thinking about until now, is the Farm Raised Shrimp and Anson Mills Organic Grits with manchego cheese. This dish was so incredibly delicious! The shrimp were lightly seasoned on top of cheesy grits, and manchego cheese, my all-time favorite cheese! The dish had such a great texture too it and it wasn't too rich that it would fill you up right away.  This is for sure my new favorite restaurant. It's really close to my place and I love the variety on the menu. You can mix and match so many different items, different cuisines, and they have great portion sizes to please any appetite.

At any rate, I started with a ginger beer and cucumber cocktail, my date with a riesling.   We had shrimp and grits and a spicy duck confit to start.  The shrimp and grits were very well balanced and a nice small touch of cheese.  The duck confit was wonderfully tender and pleaslingly spicier than I would have guessed.  The crisp pan seared salmon was the best I've had in awhile and the nice hunk of braised lamb a savory pleasure to slowly fork off the meat fronds, like petals of a flower... but my meat poetry digresses.  Dessert was bread pudding and a cider sorbet.  I had switched drinks to their take on a mint julep, a cinnamon Woodford Reserve number that I started in anticipation of matching with the sorbet, a, if I may say so myself, wise choice indeed.   The crowd was fairly, young and dressed pretty well, mostly ties for this special occasion and pretty much exactly what I was looking for, an upscale but not over the top, pretentious or stressful just to enjoy a great meal with good company.

2008-12-14,5.0,"Full disclosure: I know chef/owner Randy Zweiban, and a more charming, talented, handsome man than Randy has never graced the Chicago restaurant scene! After spending many years at Lettuce Entertain You's Nacional 27, he's now on his own, again offering South/Central American inspired fare. And what fare it is. Props to my fabulous gang of girlfriends dining that night: curator Marilu (formerly of Lannon Gallery, Chicago!) visiting from FL, the reason for our visit! Gorgeous Lilia (FOX news reporter, but she's not faux in the least), Irene, restaurant industry professional, new friend - photographer Karen who is exhibiting at Tammy's gallery and her sister, and Tammy - gallery owner/jewelry designer. Now, I know my friends have nothing to do with your visit to Province, but I mention them because we are a gang of picky, pulchritudinous b*tches when it comes to restaurants, food and especially . . . service. And plus, I adore them. We're a tad hard to please when ""sport dining"" but this restaurant did not disappoint. Sure, we were motivated to like it 'cos of Randy, but YUM. YUM. The praise is genuine.  Now, the food! First of all, to the HATERS that complained about portion size. What-what?! How much do you need to eat? I thought the portion size was perfectly adequate, bordering on utterly generous, as did all of us. If you want obscenely large portions, get your cretin palate over to Old Country Buffet, and leave us alone to dine glamorously and lusciously here. We did get small favor - there were 7 of us, but we were able to get the $36 prix fixe menu, usually available to tables of 8 and up. You could probably get that same favor for your party if you ask politely. Our group started with our choices of cocktails or wine, served up sassily by a cute, flirty bartender. Nice! Out come the appetizers: Cuban Pork Bocadillos - little bite size sandwiches of perfectly seasoned pork. I could have eaten a plate of these and called it a day, they were that good. The Fall Squash Taquitoes - I'm not a tremendous fan of squash, but these were excellent, and had a great texture. Fluke Ceviche - who doesn't love ceviche - this was excellent also, with an unexpected grapefruit flavor for the citrus - love it. The only small suggestion I'd have, is that the Caesar salad needed a couple of anchovies popped onto it. Minor. More appetizers: Spanish Blue Cheese Fondue with herbed crisps - I am adding Blue Cheese Fondue to my last meal on earth - creamy decadence, that stuff is. Unexpected texture for blue cheese, but wow . . . just wow. And my other favorite thing was the Shrimp Grits with Manchego cheese - cheese again, I could have eaten a giant bowl of this, another unexpected, but very successful combo (which Randy is famous for).  The entrees that I tried were mine: Chimichurri Rubbed Flat Iron Steak and Tammy's Tasmanian Salmon. The steak was an extremely generous portion. T and I both commented that the steak sauce was reminiscent of A1 sauce - but since we both unabashedly love that stuff - tangy goodness! The steak was a bit chewy, but perfectly seasoned and medium rare done to perfection. The salmon was excellent as well, juicy! Marilu had the 10 Hour Braised lamb which she went crazy for - this is a girl who is also an excellent cook, so if she likes it . . . well, you probably will too. Dessert: lemon sour cream pound cake, pear compote with vanilla ice cream, a pear tartlet and a CHOCOLATE THREE WAY washed down with delightful champagne.  The architectural dilettante in me would not be happy if I didn't mention the interior - utterly swank, scene-y place. Stark and minimalist, but with the addition of interesting plants - moss, orchids, tree forms - it doesn't feel cold. What I called ""food porn"" photos on the wall - gorgeous. The restaurant is completely green, in a LEED certified building, and uses local organic food. Another reviewer described the interior as ""chic meets zen meets sexxy."" - perfect description.

Everyone raved about them. We then ordered the Blood Orange Salad with Goat Cheese and Micro Greens. That was actually a joke. It literally came with 3 slices of orange, slices of goat cheese and small specs of greens. We had to order another one just so that everyone could have a taste. Flavor was good, but it would help to have greens instead of ""micro greens."" We shared several of the biggest plates, which were actually quite big and all were delicious -- the Striped Bass, the Hawaiian Tuna, 10-Hour Braised Lamb and the Chimichurri Flatiron Steak. There wasn't a single one that wasn't incredibly flavorful and fresh. For dessert, we shared the 3-way chocolate dessert and the pear tartlett. All were very, very tasty. The wines were good too. I had one of their specialty cocktails with fresh ginger and it was really yummy.",0.9919,0.821,0.172,0.007,0.4648656898656898
2008-12-08,3.0,"I'm not certain if my experience at Province was typical or not because I went with my bf's bosses who happen to know the owner Randy Zweiban.  I say this because the service was outstanding--in fact it gets 5 stars for the service. We were also brought several bites that we had not ordered.  The wine was also really good, though I can't remember what I had.  The food was good, but I guess I'm not the biggest fan of fine dining.   That being said, I expected the small portions, and the only reason why I left satisfied was because I tried multiple dishes that our table split.   I had the gala apple salad which was very good, though a little watery.  I also had the Pounded and Crumbled Chicken Breast.  I was unimpressed with it. It tasted fine, but it was almost like I could make it at home, minus the leeks and orange mojo sauce.  Thank goodness the server did not give me a weird look when I asked what the orange mojo was.  Our table also had the Blue Cheese fondue which was delicious.  I could eat a whole pot of it--with bread though, not weird, flat crackers that made it hard to eat.  I did take a couple tastes of my bf's buttermilk whipped potatoes which were also delicious.  Finally, we had the Chocolate 3 Ways, which I really enjoyed but Time Out/Chicago Magazine/Crain's Chicago Business Reviews all did not really prefer.  I thought it was the perfect amount of desert. I also wasn't a fan of the set up.  We had a group of 8 people and were quite chatty--haha--even thought we were in the corner it was obvious that some other diners were quite annoyed.",0.9894,0.789,0.163,0.048,0.5669717261904762

Portions:  TINY!  Ok fine...  it was a ""tasting"" so I didn't go in there expecting an all out food free for all, but COME ON!  What my date and I ate combined did not make up a true meal for one person.  I don't care if it was a sampling.  5 courses should fill a person up.  Unless of course, one of the courses is 1 cracker each with some sort of fishy salsa on it. (true story).  Our waiter came out with a tiny little saucer that had 2 crackers on it, each about the size of a quarter.  And he went on to explain: ""our first course is...""  Gimme a break buddy.  That ""first course"" looked like it was directly ripped off from a picture on the side of a box of Ritz crackers. Speaking of our server....  completely incompetent.  Besides not offering us menus, or drinks besides water, he didn't know a thing about other drinks we saw at other tables.  I watched one gentleman get some sort of whiskey drink with a cinnamon stick in it that gets lit on fire.  So, I asked our server what it was exactly, as I am a fan of anything Whiskey.  He started by making up some rediculous name, and telling me the drink had Gin in it.  I obviously didn't buy his BS answer, as he could tell from the look on my face.  So he opened his little cheat sheet and looked it up, explained it to me, and walked away.  Now...  I have no problem with a waiter reading to me (especially if I don't have a menu of my own to read), but wouldn't you think it would cross his mind to ask me if I'd like to try one, since I asked about it?  no...  of course not..... other highlights included some sort of lamb meat / corn bread stuffing mush that was absolutely drenched in gravy and reminded me more of week old holiday leftovers than anything, and then some miniature taco things fit for the King of Lego Land.  (also only one each) So...  we left unsatisfied, and with growling stomachs.  After an hour and forty minutes of sitting with little more than ice water in front of us at any given moment, we stopped at McDonalds on the way home and filled the void.  Don't  waste your time here.  There's plenty more restaurants in the city that will treat you right.",-0.2715,0.867,0.065,0.068,0.4788931788931789

Tasted like it was cooked on a weber grill that hadn't been cleaned in 20 years.  We tried several other items including the goat cheese and blood orange salad.  It was just that, a few slices of orange and a slice of cheese, mind-blowing.",0.8934,0.889,0.111,0.0,0.44999999999999996

Highly recommend ordering.  -Chocolate Three Ways - Cute execution and very tasty (choc. mousse, rich choc. ice cream, and choc. molten cake)  The wine list is also very reasonable (from $35 and up). We had a great bottle of Seghesio Zinfandel in the $40 range. My husband also had a unique whiskey cocktail, the Smart Money. It came with a cinnamon stick that they light on fire.

Quite spicy, So tasty.  And they pour the broth over the chicken at your table. A lot of the food here is about presentation. Me gusta. Side of cornbread ""mixture"" Since I was with someone who works there, the chef and owner came to our table and said I could have this as a side, even though they don't serve it as a side. (hello!! They treat me like I'm special, major points for Province!) What amazing cornbread. I wish stuffing on thanksgiving tasted like this. perfect texture, perfect amount of sweetness. God, American stuffing blows. beef cheeks with onions and carrots: very very good as well. However, this was a ""big"" entree, and it was anything but big. I realize we are used to huge portions in this country, but I had to TRY to make it last four bites.  Brussel sprouts: oh no no. Sorry mr. brussels, you were very hard  and tasted burnt. yucky. Lemon pound cake: yummy. And actually not that small! Decor: very pretty and unique. From the menus to the wall, to the presentation of the food, and even the nice silverware, very nice. A bit too high-ceilinged, but spacious. 1 star off: brussel sprouts. And the fact that the menu, though very interesting in that you can mix and match, is sneaky. It seems reasonably priced.

I stopped in last Saturday night for a couple of appetizers and a glass of wine and was not very impressed. We started by trying out a couple of the bites. The pork bocadillo was very good, but the crab toast was forgettable annnd when then say bite they really mean bite. We also ordered the salmon carpaccio  which came as it was described as ""lightly smoked"" but the light smoke along with not much else flavor was not very exciting.  My biggest problem was with the wine. Though I am more than willing to pay for good food and good wine, the price markup on the wine was a bit ridiculous and a kind of a turn off.

Certain booths and walls are bathed in an infectiously happy shade of fuschia. Even the clipboards used for the menus are inspired. The menu is divided into bites, raw, small, big, and bigger. Though their version of 'bigger ' is still Napoleon in stature. Factoring in the dwarfed portion sizes, the locally grown ingredients and LEED certified space- each mouthful clocks in at $7.

We got there a bit early for our 9PM reservation, so we got a drink at the bar. I had a Pimm's Grip- their variation on  Pimm's & Soda, a London summer favorite (if you like Sangrias, you'll love this. Trust me). Aweome, refreshing, tasty. But I really wanted my date's drink.... It was called ""___ & Money"" if I recall. It was a variation of a Mint Julep- this had peach-infused Woodford Reserve, apple brandy, muttled mint, and .... wait for it... a flaming cinnamon stick. The bartender lit it like incense and then told my date to put it out in her drink. Made the whole thing smell like autumn.  Once seated, we took a look at the menu. It's broken down curiously- into small, big, and bigger plates. I'm not sold on that aspect, as I thought it was unnecessarily complicated, but it worked out ok.  We got shrimp bisque with fingerling potatoes and a tuna sashimi appetizer with wasabi veggies to split. Both excellent.  But the entrees knowcked our socks off. I ordered 10-hour braised lamb with chorizo and cornbread.  She ordered beef cheeks with root vegetables. We split a side of chorize hash browns. We polished those off in ah hurry, both punctuating our meals with moans of satisfaction.  Once I finished my cocktail, I decided to check out the wine. Reasonably priced, good variety- though not extensive.  Lastly, we had ""cho9colate three ways"" for desert. Pudding, ice cream, and some molten centered cakey goodness.
