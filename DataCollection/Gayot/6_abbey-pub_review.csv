2015-12-14,4.0,"The Abbey Pub We came to the Abbey for the Lil Debbie concert on Halloween. I am a very specific kind of concert goer. I prefer going to events that are general admission so that you can get the seat, or spot, that you want. This means I enjoy showing up early, waiting in line, and standing out in the cold before the doors open. The Abbey had a setup though that allowed us to not have to stand in line, kept us warm, and still get in early. If you dined with them in their bar/restaurant area all of these perks were awarded to you.  Still, we showed up before 7 for an event where the doors didn't open until 10 and the music didn't start until 11. I know, I am crazy. We ate and drank at small tables that were set up in the bar and we were served by the friendly staff there. Standard bar food and the drinks were reasonably priced. I think this area is called the Green Room. Around 9 the act that was scheduled to go on in this area began. Before this we were the only people dining with a few patrons sitting at the bar. It was relatively quiet besides the music coming from the main venue area.  Once the music in the Green Room started, the atmosphere changed drastically. It was a ""packed house"" with about 30 or so people sitting in all available tables and tall boy chairs. The band was jamming out and they weren't shy. At this point it was too loud for us to talk but this area was no longer meant for that kind of dining experience. It was ok as we were ready to go over to the main venue at 10.  It took a while to get confirmation on the perks I listed above but after speaking with our waitress, the door guy, and another waitress on the main venue side, we were able to get a table on the balcony and enter before the doors opened. This was nice as not everyone in my party wanted to stand for 3-4 hours or be uncomfortably close to other concert goers. We were able to order food and drinks from our waitress on the balcony and she even continued to serve us on the concert floor.  I was extremely concerned about being in the front, if you haven't already figured that out, so we went down just before the doors opened to get right in the middle. We stood here for the entire night, with some of my friends rotating in and out to the upper balcony, while rooting on acts and still getting served by our waitress. Yes, she was able to get to us even after the concert had started. That showed how busy (tame) it was.  I thought the concert was great, Lil Debbie came on around 1 or 2 and she stayed on for a good 45 minutes to an hour. The preceding acts were hit and miss most of the night. The crowd was relatively respectful and there was little pushing or shoving even when Queen D took the stage.  All in all, this venue is great for smaller acts and it is good for those who enjoy general admission or more intimate performances.",0.9937,0.883,0.1,0.017,0.5109304138321996
2015-12-07,1.0,"Honestly this place went down hill BAD. I used to love this place, we would go to the bar side to see Helene and go see shows on the other side. I just paid $14 to see a show and the sound sucks. The microphones they used kept cutting out for each artist. The bar didn't have basic bottles that any bar would carry, also they were borrowing bottles back and forth from the bar to the venue side so getting drinks took forever. The waitress ignored us even though she looked right at us... We had to sit at a dirty table because we waited 45 minutes to see if they were gonna pick up the plates. The bartender on the bar side was extremely rude, at least the bartender on the venue side was polite. Also two beers and a shot of jamo was $10 at the bar and $14 through the waitress. I ordered a Reuben and it had two slices of corned beef on it... It should have been called a sour kraut sandwich with stale bread.

He said 2:00 AM.  I'm thinking, cool it's 1:40 still time to relax and finish our beers.  Not 5 minutes later, the douche bag returned and started picking up our beers.  He mentioned he was going to help speed us up.  This guy was a real piece of work.  I don't think he could tell time, which explains why he was 30 something and working as a bar-back.  Sad kind of...

2015-09-13,3.0,"This is one of those venues where so many writers have had something to say regarding the history of Abbey Pub, that you're really going to pale in comparison no matter what you have to say. My experience has taught me that you won't see any major acts here. At best, I saw a few Industrial bands. One of them being Comasoft. The sound system is decent but it pierces your ears and you leave with humming ears after a show. I recommend you bring your earplugs. The drinks are basic and the tables are never very clean. Not surprising given the history. Why anyone has loved this place so much to the point to keep it open is beyond me. Parking is kind of a pain in the butt too. I liken it to finding parking at the Metro. Only the traffic isn't as bad.

Mainly, I was down to see Andrew Jackson Jihad, but even if it hadn't been for the concert I would've still thought this place was pretty cool. Even though it was packed the service was friendly. It was hard to get the bartender's attention, but I can sorta let that go when it's really busy. Table service was much better. As far as a place to see a show it's pretty decent, I'd say. The bouncers were friendlier than average. The place has plenty of space to accommodate a crowd without too many obstructed views. There's also a lot of balcony space.

2015-07-19,1.0,"Sad experience Friday at the Abbey, from the dining perspective. We arrived at 7 pm to hear a friend's band perform. They got bumped to 8:30 pm, so we entered the restaurant for dinner. A server was nice enough to move a table over so we could join our band friends. Great start. She dropped off a menu ... then did not return. We observed the server sitting alone in the adjoining dining room! After almost 30 minutes, we had to approach the server (woman, 22, 5'7"", brown hair) and ask for some service! We placed our orders for drinks and food. Drinks arrived promptly, and the food arrived 15 minutes later. The drinks were okay, the food nothing to write home about. My pulled pork sandwich was dry and the pickle was mushy. Fries were okay. It gets worse.  We finished our drinks and meal. Still no return visit from our server. My companion approached the manager (man behind the bar) and complained.  He somewhat apologized and said, ""She was busy.""  Right. And, my companion presented a $15  restaurant.com  coupon and asked what we owed.  The manager said $9 but would not give us an itemization. Finally, en route to the men's room, I peaked into the kitchen. Scary looking.  Long and short: Our first and only visit to the Abbey restaurant was our last.",-0.5104,0.886,0.054,0.06,0.5642857142857143
2015-06-29,2.0,"Enjoyed the venue for the most part. Good music and the bar staff was friendly. However, the 2 bouncers working the door would discourage me from ever returning. I had a cup of water and when I went to leave the venue, one of the bouncers stopped me assuming I had alcohol (fair enough) and refused me from leaving. When I explained to him that I was only drinking water and that I was allowed to leave as I was not breaking any laws, he started to raise his voice and threaten to call the police. He was also forcefully pushing me back on to the property. I tried to reason with the man but he refused since I would be breaking ""open container laws"". I asked to speak to his supervisor. He then grabbed the other bouncer (chubby man with the long beard) who then put his head right in my face and started to then scream at me (there was no reason for him to raise his voice as I was being complacent with both of them). It got to the point where I was politely asking him to lower his voice because there was NO reason for him to be screaming at me. He actually said ""hey! We've been nice enough to let you in and out tonight so just listen to us."" Thank you so much!!! How generous of you! (Prick!).

When she finally told us which one to use she had no idea what anything was. She took our drink order and took 15 mins to bring us 2 Corona's. By the way the place was empty so there is no excuse to take so long. We ordered an appetizer but I started to feel uncomfortable there and there was a nasty odor like no one had cleaned for weeks. When we finally got our beers the limes she brought us had fruit flies on them. So we told the bartender who could careless and told the waitress and she said sorry and walked away.

The Green Room is in the back of the place, with a tiny stage and a setting that kind of makes you feel like you're hanging out at a friends house. There is a super cool upside down drum set hanging from the ceiling and a few tables, but it's pretty intimate. If you're not into up close and personal, this might not be a place for you. Some of the reviews mention noise being a factor, but for me I didn't think it was loud at all.  I'm not a big drinker and came with a full tummy, but I admit to having a bite of my hubby's veggie burger, and it was honestly pretty good! It was fresh, flavorful and full of veggies.

Walking in the door was confusing.  We walked through a hallway, the walls plastered with band promos, and stopped at two doors leading to separate rooms.  We walked in, and the bartender looked up but didn't say anything.  There was a group of maybe five men gathered together watching a soccer game, a couple in the corner, and a guy at the bar sucking on the WiFi. The beer menu is minimal and prices are average.  I ordered a Magner's Irish Cider.  It tasted okay, but the bottle and glass or ice had a strange smell to it.  I didn't notice until I was almost finished with my drink, passed it around our table, and everyone said something wasn't right, like the glassware was stored in a mildewed basement.  I'm still alive.  So oh well.  I would hesitate to order anything that gets poured into a glass - or comes in a keg... My dad ordered a Miller Lite on draft.  The waitress came back with a bottle and a glass, and she told my dad that the beer keg was old - she knew this because the beer was coming out green from St. Patrick's Day.  It's almost as if ""Bar Rescue"" was never really here.   Has no one else ordered a Miller Lite at this bar in the last two weeks?   Sage Francis is performing here on June 5, which I am very excited for, but if it weren't for Sage, I'd never set foot in here again.  There are too many bars in the city and suburbs doing it better. The Abbey has a nice patio area and a huge room for performances.  It seems like a great little neighborhood bar, especially if you want to watch a soccer game, but otherwise it's a dump that the management obviously doesn't care too much about maintaining.  Clean your kegs and your glassware!",0.9703,0.82,0.117,0.063,0.45439244663382594

2014-02-26,3.0,"Went to hear comedy.  The older gentleman bartender, Frank, was inattentive regarding the door behind the bar leading to the side with the loud music.  The younger guy, Brian, kept closing it after the older man went through. Situational awareness is an important part of customer service.  Frank seemed to be a likeable guy, and the door is hard to move.  This, I blame on the Abbey.  Covering for the venue until it's addressed is part of Frank's job. Brian rocks.  Frank needs improvement.  I realize that he's been behind that bar for 32 years, and he's a fixture of the place while I'm just someone who occasionally comes in for comedy, in a venue that's primarily about music. Manager or owner will be assessed on my next visit to Flabby at the Abbey, based on how well they address this problem.  There are two doors; one is a pocket door that blocks some sound, the other is an ungainly folded door that's heavier.  Frank closed neither one when he went through it.

I had walked into the Abbey around 10pm (1/11/14) with my Fiancé and in-laws and Kashmir didn't get on the stage until a little after 10:30. The waitress was quick to take drink orders and had given us a menu. I had ordered the baked Mac and cheese while my fiancé ordered the fish and chips. My Mac was pretty good. Cheesy, creamy and my fiancé claims it's the best he had. The fish and chips were crunchy but a little over done to the point where it was like chewing rubber. Our waitress was so nice. Honestly, I believe she handled herself as best she can since she serves drunk people. Unfortunately, our drinks came back wrong 3 times.  I also ordered an extra order of fries and im never got them. They weren't on the tab so I assumed she just forgot about it or never really heard me.  ALSO.

We got there around noon and were one of only 4 people in the bar. That was to be expected. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. The bartender was nice enough and had what seemed like an Irish accent. The 2 older and 2 younger gentlemen also seemed to have the same accent, and they were all very interested in the soccer game on TV. We decided to order the Guinness glazed wings.

2013-11-28,4.0,"Overall I give the place and my experience 4 stars.  Some of the food could have been better but the value and music more than make up for that.  Below you can see how I came to this conclusion. 5 STAR WORTHY The Music: We saw fantastic Beatles (""American English)"") and Led Zepplin (""Kashmir"") tribute bands who sounded so much like the originals that for a moment I thought they were lip-singing.  ""American English"" even had two costume changes to coincide with the changing look of the Beatles (""Hard Days NIght"" era, ""Sergeant Peppers"" era, ""Abbey Road"" era) Value: $10 to see see such great music and reasonably priced food, and that was without the Groupon special 4 STAR WORTHY Service: The staff looked new but they worked well together.  You could see them helping each other out.  Plus, the place was packed for the concert, so they were all very busy.  But, they handled it very well.  By the time you read this and go this staff will be more experienced. Meanwhile we spotted the manager, Pat Looney going assisting his staff and going around checking on guests. A Lot of the Food:  The Irish egg roll and french fries were both some of the best I've had in awhile Beer Selection:  I noticed 3 or 4 different bars each with different beers on tap including Half Acre, Revolution, Sam Adams, Guinness, Newcastle, Lagunitas, Miller Lite, and many others.  Most other music venues I have been to don't have half the beer selection The Abbey has. The Concert Setting Layout: There was plenty of place for people to stand as well as seats & tables for those who want to sit in the balcony area overlooking the stage.  It held a lot of people but was a small intimate where you can really get close to the people on stage.  Other than a brief 10 seconds when one of the microphone went out the audio and lighting for the shows was outstanding. 3 STAR WORTHY Some of the Food:  The fish from the fish 'n' chips were a little bland but well fried. The burgers seemed to be made with frozen pre-shaped patties, but still better than other burgers I have had in the city.  But, I understand that this is a music venue, not a 5-star restaurant, plus it is very good food for the price.   The Guinness: I don't know if my poured Guinness sat behind the bar too long or if the bartender didn't know how to pour a proper Guinness, but it didn't have that multi-layered look to it, thus the taste was a little affected but still very drinkable with a nice head on it.   The Green Room @:  We sat in a smaller private-looking area of the restaurant that had little to no atmosphere, and our booth seats were not securely attached to the floor so it kept wobbling when we moved around in the seat.  But, the whole rest of the place which was shown on Bar Rescue looked great  with numerous flat-screen TVs to show the Blackhawks game and plenty of guitars hanging on the walls many of them signed.  Unfortunately it was hard to read the signatures and there were no plaques under them to let us know whose signature it was. The Glasses: Early in the evening they ran out of glasses in the dining area so my beer started coming to me in clear plastic cups they probably use in the concert area so if anyone drops a drink on the dance floor they don't have to stop everything in order to sweep up the broken glass.  My Guinness was served in one of the coolest Guinness glasses I have ever seen with its raised harp symbol.  Hopefully by the time you read and visit them they will have stocked up on new bar glasses or do a better job of rounding up used glasses and washing them.",0.9977,0.828,0.138,0.034,0.4695785779876689

Well it was delightful! The two appetizers we got were pretzel thingies with dipping sauces and potato chip nacho things. The pretzel came to our table piping hot with mustard, cheese sauce and a salsa- like sauce. All pretty good. It wasn't a tower really, but a bunch of pretzels cut up. Still good.  The potatoe chip nacho things - were actually not bad. They had potato chips instead of corn ships, cheese sauce of some sort, guac and salsa I think. I love potato chips so that was a good deal. Everything tasted good. The melty cheese was clearly the artificial kind but it worked since it was melty and went well with gauc. Problem is that potato chips get soggy fast - and so it can turn into an un-appetizing mess. But as long as you don't look too closely at it - it's good. And since I know this is a pub and not Alinea, I'm cool with that.  While I am also a fan of fancy cheeses, the ""cheese sauce"" has it's place. Usually in a pub, on nachos. There is just something about its cheesy, yellow, salty goodness.  We had fish and chips and it was ok except a bit greasy and fish was more breading than fish. Vinegar with the fries - awesomeness.  Our server Lindsay was great. She checked on us, got me water, told us about our order status, and notified us about things like that cheese on a burger is extra $1 , and that ordering whiskey on ice is extra $.50.

Since I like ice in my drinks and I got paid this week I sprung for the extra ice. yeah water is cheap but the ice machine is probably isn't it so sure why not.

My recent encounter was NYE at the Abbey, which was the most ridiculous spectacle of mismanaging an event I have ever seen. For one thing paying for VIP and being promised an open bar and buffet and receiving something subpar with a loft party you pay ten bucks to get into, is pretty disappointing. I realized they wouldn't have a ton of top shelf liquor in the open bar but they had like 6 options for alcohol and weren't even pouring a full shot into the glass. What happened to the free champagne all night? The buffet was completely a haphazard selection of random foods like tuna sandwiches and chicken skewers and some food I had no idea what it even was. I thought this place was on tv for some complete makeover including food. Anyways the cocktail staff was a joke, someone would come to get your drink order then return 45 minutes later. I think someone in an earlier review mentioned the awkward timely gaps between bands on NYE. The first band went on two hours after they opened then it was another hour or so before JD went on and no bands in between. What a strange setup! Oh! and the bathrooms are always untidy in this place and the floors completely soaked with water. I cant figure out why this is the case every time you are here.

2013-01-01,1.0,"This review is for The Abbey's handling of their NYE event. The doors were supposed to open at 8 pm, and the concert was to begin at 9 pm. While the doors opened on time, the opening band didn't go on until 10:15. That band only played for half an hour so they finished playing at 10:45. JD McPherson didn't go on until 11:45 pm, and there was no band playing between the two. I don't understand why The Abbey would choose to schedule the concert to start at 9 pm, then not start until 10 pm, and have an hour of inactivity between the two bands (there was less than five minutes involved in switching of the equipment). If this had just been a regular bar performance, it wouldn't have been so weird, but it wasn't. This was a $25 a ticket event in a separate venue off the side of the main bar where another band was playing for free. If The Abbey's intention was to allow people time to mingle between acts, then they shouldn't have sold so many tickets that you couldn't move without shoving people out of the way. It was so packed that the back of the guy standing in front of me was touching my boobs. Concerts are usually packed, especially in Chicago, but this was just a whole other level of ridiculous. Who wants to spend an hour, two separate times, just standing in the middle of a packed room that you can barely escape to go to the bathroom or get another drink? Also, for $25 a ticket (not counting ticket fees), I was expecting more than 90 minutes of music during a four hour event. I expected a concert. I choose The Abbey for NYE because I was not interested in the overpriced NYE parties thrown at fancier bars, but it turns out The Abbey was just as overpriced for what they provided. Had I not bought a ticket to JD McPherson, I could have stayed in the bar listening to live music for free WITH AN EVEN LONGER PLAY TIME. In the end, we left halfway through JD McPherson, as awesome as he was live, because being constantly shoved around by waitresses and people trying to leave, made it hard to enjoy the music. The $55-60 we spent on our tickets was wasted because we only spent about 30 minutes in the actual venue; the rest of the five hours we were in the main bar watching the stage on the TVs in there; as you can imagine, it was a lot of fun staring at an empty stage for four of the five hours. I understand that The Abbey wanted to make sure JD McPherson was playing at midnight since it was NYE, however, they should have planned the event accordingly from the beginning. Why start the event at 9 pm and only plan for an hour and a half of music if you want the event to last until 1 am? They could have started the event later, or even better, added a third band. The Amazing Heeby Jeebies who played the main bar were great, and would have made for a terrific addition to the lineup in The Abbey's concert venue next door. Another option would be to have had JD play his set before midnight, and have him only do his encore after. This would have also been better because they had a balloon drop at midnight; the constant balloon popping during his performance was distracting, and liquor soaked wood floors + popped balloon remnants = not the safest combination. The Abbey also offered $70 VIP tickets which included balcony seating, a buffet, and drinks. What The Abbey didn't seem to tell people about the VIP tickets is that you could only get your free drinks at the bar in the balcony. Since there was an hour delay to the start of the concert, and an hour between bands, some people went to the main bar (separated from the venue only by a door), to listen to the Amazing Heeby Jeebies; when VIP people ordered a drink at the bar there, they were told they had to pay for it (after the drink was already made and they were forced to pay for it). While this may seem obvious to some people, on behalf of the VIP ticket holders, I must say that the way they had everything set up, I don't think it was that obvious. So, if you were a VIP ticket holder who didn't want to sit in the balcony for two hours staring at an empty stage, and wanted to actually listen to some live music, you had to go back to the venue, show your stamp to the doorman, push your way through the people, and go up the stairs to the VIP bar every time you wanted another drink. I heard from someone that the reason The Abbey was waiting so long between bands was because the venue was so packed that they were wanting to see if the event cleared out a bit by people going over to the main bar area to hear the Amazing Heeby Jeebies' free performance. If this is true, it makes the whole situation even more aggravating: their solution for overselling tickets is to make those who bought tickets so frustrated with waiting to hear music that they just give up and leave, and not get what they paid for? I really hope this was not the case, however, I can't think of any legitimate explanation for how the event was ran.",0.9987,0.809,0.14,0.05,0.4626010626010625

2012-09-26,5.0,"I recently hosted a private event at the Abbey, and it's definitely one of the best venues I've worked with so far. Bar event coordinators are not always the most professional, on-the-ball people to work with, but Leslie from the Abbey made my job a lot easier!

Everyone assigned to our event was great, especially Tom, our door guy/A.V. assistant/table mover.

Overall, the service was dismal at best.  It took forever to get anything (btw, all of this way before the event started, there were 20 people in there at best at the time and most had already been served [my guess is that they'd come in for lunch]), my friend and I were half ready to go back to the kitchen and take over. Honestly, the menu is not that large and not that complicated. Secondly, the food. I'm going to be honest here, I enjoy a good reuben. A good reuben has great texture and flavor. The reuben at Abbey Pu Grill left everything to be desired.  My first thought was that the sandwich was not on toasted bread but burned bread, to the point where I would not serve it to anyone, had I been in the kitchen. Next I wondered, seriously, what the difference was between their reuben sandwich and their corned beef sandwich other than the reuben is a dollar more? Sadly, I had to eat a quarter of the sandwich before I even noticed that there was any sauerkraut in the sandwich and I finished the sandwich having never seen a drop of either Thousand Island or Russian dressing. The corned beef tasted nothing like corned beef, just like salted Arby's beef (oh yea, I'm comparing this place to Arby's. In fact, you're better off going to Arby's, the service is guaranteed to be better). Beside the sandwich was the most insipid pickle I have ever tasted, very little dill flavor and I didn't even taste much vinegar: a soggy, salted cucumber. Spike TV has a show called Bar Rescue that could really help this pla... oh wait, they've already been to Abbey Pu Grill. Meat-eaters, if you like reubens, you're better off going to The Chicago Diner (yes, the vegetarian/vegan restaurant) in boystown and ordering their reuben, it's excellent.

We arrived on time, and there were a few people already there, but it wasn't packed or anything. We wanted to find a table, so we went upstairs to the second floor, which looked down on the main floor area and stage.  When we first got up there, it looked like there were a bunch of open tables. However, when we got closer, we saw that each open table had a ""reserved"" sign on it. A bunch of tables were reserved for this infamous Julie Voss and her 25 GUESTS.  So we're just sort of standing up there, trying to figure out where to sit, and the waitress comes by and asks if we want anything to drink. I'm like, ""Ah, so which tables aren't reserved?"" She's like, ""Oh, yeah, there's this big group coming over from the restaurant, so these tables are all reserved."" Hmmmmmm. OK.  So we sit down at another table that already has people sitting at it, which means we can't see the stage very well 'cause we're further back. We order some drinks. We listen to a couple songs. Still no Julie Voss. Hmmmmmmm. WTF?  At this point, I'm pretty frustrated. I mean, how can you reserve 25 seats for people who aren't even there, while there are a bunch of people who actually showed up on time but can't see the show 'cause all the good seats are reserved? That's just bad business and a policy that the Abbey Pub should re-evaluate. I mean, it's not really Julie Voss' fault and instead the Abbey Pub's fault, but since they put her name on the reserved signs, I'm going to blame her too. So, instead of being annoyed and angry, which isn't what the Beatles would have wanted, I just sat in Julie Voss' seats and got to watch the show from her great seats. I figured I would move when the group got there, but guess what?!?! JULIE VOSS' GROUP NEVER EVEN SHOWED UP!!! Can you believe that?!?! That's messed up. Sigh. Whatever. I'm OK now.

2011-05-10,1.0,"Not a bad place to see a show, but this is about dining.  Let me start out by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this place!  It is literally my corner pub, and would like nothing more than have an awesome place to relax and grab a bite and drinks.  However, after several attempts, I have given up.  The service is simply inexcusable.   Our latest attempt fell last week days after their ""Grand Re-opening.""   They had a reality TV show come in and redecorate the place and simplify the menu.  The good news:  they were actually friendly this time!  We were actually acknowledged upon arrival! (Seriously, in the past, they would stare at us as if we stepped off the mother-ship and  asked to see their leader when we asked for food.)  The new decor is interesting, I like the bare brick, and  the artwork has a kitschy charm to it. The bad, and these are huge, at first we thought we'd have an inexpensive meal there.  There's a reason why I haven't yelped in awhile; I don't get out much these days.  As of the date of this posting their web-site still has specials that no longer exist!  So, that $5 burger, is now an $11 burger.  Ah, the price of fame on a reality TV show.  Second, and let this be a lesson for all who follow my footsteps, when your waitress approaches your table twenty minutes after you've ordered and asks, ""I'm sorry, what did you guys order again?""  RUN!  The evening is guaranteed not to end well, but we were rather famished at the time, so we decided to tough it out.  Oh.  Were we wrong.   Half an hour later, our order arrived minus my wife's salad and burger's cheese, but rejoice!  They have added a fried egg to their burger!  The food was $5 food, nowhere near $11.  The portions were also ridiculously small for the price.   Life is too short, and this city is much too large to waste your money on a place like this.  I have tried this place several times, and each time the results have been similar, but at least now they are friendly, but not restauranteurs.",0.9924,0.785,0.152,0.063,0.4207963089542037
2011-05-06,3.0,"I attended a benefit for the great Irish fiddler, Maurice Lennon, at the Abbey last night (both Maurice and his wife are fighting cancer). It was a great event for the Irish music community in Chicago and the Abbey should be commended for hosting it. The show was heavily attended by musicians. You couldn't spit in any direction without hitting a fiddler and, as a bodhran player, believe me I tried to spit on as many fiddlers as I could.  It's been a zillion years since I've gone to the Abbey and I was curious to see how things had changed since it became more of a rock venue than Irish pub. Also, it's been only a few days since Spike TV's ""Bar Rescue"" show had gone through and reconfigured the menu and bar area decor so I was doubly interested.  I'm pleased to say that my fears of the Abbey being transformed into some sort of Happy Leprechaun Disneyland ride were unnecessary. I had been concerned when I found out the Spike TV expert in charge of the makeover was a restaurateur from Miami. I mean, what does a guy from Miami know about Chicago Irish dive bars? The bar area was done over with a kind of living room set up at the front of the room and lots of electric guitars on the walls. Looked nice, a huge departure from the dive I remember. The new menu they were touting was heavily loaded with Irish and Irish-American dishes, but it's been so long that I've been away I'm not sure if this is much of a change or simply a return to a menu from way back when.  I spent most of the evening in the performance music room which seemed pretty much unchanged to me. Very homemade giant tables on the balconies, picnic tables and folding chairs on the ground floor, which I expect get cleared away for rock shows. Disappointingly, a Guinness cost $6 for a 12 or 16 ounce plastic cup, the kind of cup you'd drink from at Wrigley Field, rather than a proper glass 20 ounce Imperial pint. Expensive for a beer and a cheesy presentation, but it might be part of the Abbey's transformation from an Irish pub to rock palace.  Startlingly, there was a guy in the men's bathroom with a sink full of colognes, burning incense, spritzing soap into your hands and handing you paper towels for tips. Now I definitely remember that this guy wasn't there in days long past, but he said he'd been there 8 years now, so again this is something that surprised me after being away a decade or two. I don't know any other Irish pub in the Chicago area with a bathroom attendant....  It may have been the event, but service was abysmal. The bartender had to go through a search to break a $20 bill--and I got 14 singles back. I sat at the same table in the balcony for four hours and never was given a menu or asked for a drink order. So I nursed the one stout I'd purchased on the main floor and went to White Castle afterward for dinner.",0.9568,0.906,0.069,0.025,0.47570513334402215

I new that the music was going to be unbelievable, but I forgot how great the staff and accommodations are in the restaurant and bar area. The bar pours a mean pint of Guinness and the food is just solid. The concert was just short of a religious experience. I new the Traveling McCoury's would not disappoint, but when you put two Jam Band All Stars like Jeff Austin and Drew Emmitt on the stage with them, then it takes it to a whole new level. The crowd was a lot of fun. The best thing about Jam Band crowds is that the offer obvious solutions to modern day problems.

2011-02-18,3.0,"I went here to catch a show on a weeknight.  I got there before doors opened because I knew I wanted to try the Irish food there.  After finding street parking easily, I went to the bar part first to grab a bite to eat. The place is a dive, but in a good sense.  Exposed brick wall, Golden Tee, a good amount of TVs and a small stage.  I don't know if it's a dog bar per se, but a dog was walking around.  And the part that makes it a good dive bar is that some seemingly regulars were there and they got along swimmingly with the bartenders. Though I thought it odd the ambient noise was politcal debate, but they changed it to rock music at the behest of the regulars. They have some good specials, but I wanted the Irish breakfast. It's been a while since I've been to Galway but it did the trick. I liked the black pudding better than the white, it was saltier. My over easy eggs were done right and the rashers and bangers were tasty too.  However I will say the beans seemed warmed out of the can, the hash browns seemed burned on the outside yet mushy on the inside, and the soda bread was meh, but I'm not a fan of soda bread to begin with.  It was a big plate of food and went perfect with beer.  The service was good too, but it's not like they were that busy on a weeknight. I then caught the show. The venue was a good sized space with a few tables on the floor and many more up in the balcony area.  I thought the sound was excellent compared to other places I've been and the servers were good about approaching you only when you needed a new drink as opposed to harassing. The one gripe I had is that Guinness should be in a pint glass, not plastic cup, even if they probably do so to avoid broken glass from show goers. Overall it's a great place to catch a live show and an ok place to grab a small bite to eat..  It'd probably be a good bar to be a regular at since the drinks were reasonable and the bartenders were amiable.  It wouldn't be a place to pick if I were just looking to eat.",0.9929,0.789,0.153,0.058,0.4577503845360989
2011-02-05,3.0,"I've only experienced the Music venue portion of the Abbey Pub so I can't speak for the pub/restaurant, that being said, I've seen some good shows here in the past couple years.  The stage area is not very big, but it makes for a more intimate show, just be aware that if they overbook because the act playing was bigger than the booking agent realized it will be pretty crowded on the main floor.   There is a secondary level, more like a mezzanine, that overlooks the main stage area, in fact the last time I went the DJ was playing from the mezzanine, which I found a bit unusual. All the way towards the back, near where you enter, there is a bar, their selection is pretty good, Newcastle is on Tap as is Bluemoon and a few others, drink specials are displayed on the board just behind the bar.

Now, I've been going to shows for a long time and one thing I know is that the dude was not going on at 11pm. We later found out that the promoter had told every performer they would be going on at 7pm, to take advantage of their naivete and get their friends to come early and drink often. It's a shady situation and not good business practices, because that promoter cost Abbey Pub quite a few patrons that night who made a long ride down from Evanston only to be jerked around. Most folks went elsewhere in the neighborhood for dinner and drinks and returned only when the friend went on, specifically out of spite and refusal to play with the promoter's shell game for the evening. We just left, since we were tourists and only had one evening left in the city.  So anyway, if your friend books a show on a Sunday? Don't bust your hump getting there on time.

The BF and I went to the Abbey Saturday night to see Robert Gordon, along with the 10 (yes 10) friends that we convinced to go to the show as well. No coat check, and so we had to either hold our coats for the 4 hours that we were there or try to discreetly leave them somewhere, and hope for the best, which is what we did. Not a good move. At the end of the night, BF grabbed the coats and we headed home, at which point (3 a.m.) I realized that I had the wrong coat. At 9 am I lint-brushed the dog hair off the wrong coat and the BF brought it back to the Abbey, where he was told he could look around for my coat, and when he didn't find it, was told that if it had been found it would be in the office, which was locked until a manager got there. We called at noon, and were told the office wouldn't be open until 6. We called at 6, and were told the office wouldn't be open until 7. We went to the Abbey at 7, and this is what transpired: I talked to the manager, he looked for the coat, didn't find it, explained to me that the coat check person has cancer, and offered to buy me a drink, which I declined. Dear Abbey Pub: While waiting for your manager to look for my lost/stolen coat I overheard the bouncer ask the bartender how they did the night before, to which he responded that there were too many people on. Here's a thought... why not pull a bartender to work coat check and provide them financial incentive. Everyone makes money and people's coats don't get ripped off. Dear person whose coat we took by mistake: I am very, very sorry and hope that you didn't freeze going home. Your coat SHOULD  be at the Abbey waiting for you, but obviously I can't guarantee that. Dear person that ended up with my lovely knee length, wine colored coat from Gallerie Lafayette in Paris. Please return it.

People were even still eating. Bizarre. The good: solid stage, good space for people to either be right on the floor or tucked into the rafters. Had no staff problems, which is sometimes surprising at these sorts of venues. Overall, if they keep the good acts coming, I'll keep showing up.",0.6908,0.693,0.182,0.125,0.5202380952380953
2009-09-05,1.0,"I've been a fan of the abbey pub for several years now...until last night.  I arrived in anticipation to see the band ""psyclon nine"" on sept 5th and paid $50 for 2 tickets. After waiting and waiting it was announced about 30min before the venue closed, that the headlining act - psyclon nine - wasn't going to be performing. I was very disappointed and did what I thought was logical...I went to the ticket counter and simply asked for a refund. The show I paid to see didn't happen...I just wanted my money back.  The guy at the ticket booth told me it wasn't his problem and that I needed to talk to the promoter, Mark. So, I found out who Mark was, and approached him. He told me that even though he put on the show and sold me the tickets, that it wasn't his problem and that if I was upset and wanted a refund, I would have to talk to the band!!!! Way to not take responsibility for what happens in your venue Mark!  After talking with a few of the employees at the abbey pub (the ticket guy, a bouncer), who all agreed that Mark should just refund me, I got one of them to let me back to the ""bands only"" area. I talked with one of the members of the band, who informed me that it was the band's fault they didn't play....but nope, no refund.  I feel like a kid whose milk money just got stolen. I paid $50 to see a show that never happened and everyone just passed the blame to someone else. So...I urge everyone to NOT go to the abbey pub for shows. There are no promises that you will get to see the bands advertised, and of course no refunds.  So, Mark.... after reading this, what do you want to do about it? Make it right to the people that keep your venue alive? Contact me and let's settle this and I'll be happy to update this and let everyone know what happened. edit: So, I emailed the folk at the abbey pub about this:  Me: I recently purchased 2 tickets ($50) to see the headlining act, psyclon nine, and they never played. I talked with the promoter and he told me it wasn't his problem and that I should talk to the band. I talked to the band and they told me it wasn't their problem either and that I should talk to the promoter. I honestly don't care who's problem it is. The abbey pub put on the show and took my money for it. The headlining band never played and I just want a refund for a show I didn't get to see. I look forward to hearing back from you about this situation.  Response from sean duffy : the headline act was not psyclon nine.  we were not the promoters and did not take your money. it was really the band who f***ed up, not the promoter & the advertised headliner did play.  Me: Sean - It was a co-headlining tour, per the ads. So, yes, I would say that psyclon nine was an advertised headlining act. Regardless of who's fault it was, I didn't get to see the show that I paid $50 (2 tickets) for. If psyclon nine wasn't wasn't on the bill, I would have never attended the show in the first place. I would be more than happy to email Mark Ellickson, but you didn't give me his email address. response from sean: headliner is last band listed...always.  me: Attached is a copy of the flyer that was used to promote the show. It definitely says that psyclon nine was co-headlining the show. And according to all the folk I know that were working the show, Psyclon nine was scheduled to go on last...but they didn't. Quit trying to make excuses. Once again, I'd be more than happy to talk to Mark Ellickson, but you didn't give me his email address. Response from sean: 2 things.... 1) he was cc'd on the last email 2) f*** off. you don't know what you are talking about  And then sean blocked me from emailing him again. Classy Sean, classy.  So, there you have it. The abbey pub doesn't care about its customers at all. Take you money and run seems to be their motto.",0.9764,0.894,0.071,0.035,0.44812271062271064

2009-07-13,4.0,"Irving Park.....an edgy little part of town and Abbey Pub fits right in.  Not as hip as some would make it out to be, it does the job both in the drinking and music department. Located off of North Elston....and regardless of other reviews, it is easy to find and there is plenty of street parking on Elston. First the bar......  This dark pub has all the trappings of your neighborhood pub....softball team members drinking a few after playing by the lake all day.  Local old men eyeing the young girls gathered together at a near by table.  The mass of smokers outside which almost make a bar crowd in and of themselves and bartenders that give off the vibe they wish they were somewhere else.  But it still isn't a bad place to take a date if you both like a little drinking and a little music. And though all of the above reads familiar of many bars in this windy city, the Abbey Pub has something many others don't have which is an impressive music venue.  This occupies the other half of the ground floor of this building (god help the renters that live over this music hall?!?!)  With two levels and multiple bars as well as a nice stage and rocking sound system, one would be surprised that this little bar would pack such a punch in the performing music department. The bands are a mixture of local and far away land bands....heck, a band from my hometown in Asheville, North Carolina is playing there in the next week....and that is saying something!  Forget trying to determine who is playing if you are at the bar as you'll get a mixed bag of responses from the staff.  Instead, check out the bar's website for the best information on whom is going to play when. All in all, this is a bar for those that aren't high maintenance types that expect velvet ropes, loungey, and top notch service...it's for folks that want a drink and a song in a place that makes them feel comfortable and the Abbey Pub gets this done in spades.",0.9886,0.877,0.118,0.005,0.4440977443609022

Parking could not possibly be more ample - meters (they stop charging after 9!), neighborhood street parking, and a private lot. Nice.  While not immediately obvious as you enter, this place is enormous. It consists primarily of two parts - the restaurant and the ""club"". First stop, the restaurant. Thank you, Abbey Pub, for having veggie burgers. I'm sometimes not down with my carnivorous side, so it's nice to have options. Sister B. had the fish & chips and Mama B. had the crabcakes. All B.'s entered the Clean Plate Club this evening.  Our waitress was lovely and averted a potential crisis when Mama B. mistakenly ordered ""CURLY"" fries after seeing ""CURRY"" fries on the menu. I'm sure Mama B. wasn't the first to make this mistake, and to introduce her to the world of curry fries our waitress brought a side of curry sauce out with the plate of plain fries. Mama B. didn't like it (she hates all things spicy, Dear Abbey, so don't fret, it's not you). I, however, loved it. If it had come out earlier, I would have dumped it all over my veggie burger. Spice-tastic.  Time for the ""club"". In the interest of full disclosure, we were there to see Sister B.'s boyfriend's band - thus I clearly thought the music was top notch and danced in a manner typically reserved for more drunken moments. Music aside, Abbey Pub is an awesome venue. The ""front"" of the club is dominated by an old, classic-theatre-style stage. Music-lovers can either dance on the large, wooden dancefloor facing the stage or head up a level to the balcony. The balcony is full of tables and chairs (for those who prefer to enjoy their concerts while seated) and was a primo place to people-watch. I see you, you unsuspecting drunkies! Hahaha.  Time to go. But wait! Where's Papa B.? Oh there he is... on the dancefloor Cutting. A. Rug. Seriously. Dancing his pants off (not so seriously). Holy, holy, holy moly.

2009-02-15,1.0,"Ugh I'm totally embarrassed to be reviewing this place because it means I have to admit I actually paid money to eat, drink and be entertained here for their Valentine's ""Burlesque Ball"".   The Abbey Pub and Belmont Burlesque blew up the internets advertising this ""Burlesque Ball"" for Valentine's Day.  Sounded kind of racy, and had lots of potential for making my boyfriend all awkward and squeamish so I thought it could only end in hilarity.  Also, if there's anything an irish pub is good for, it is drowning me in cider.  They also advertised this fancy new menu and  we decided to get dinner there first, too. Now we will walk through all of my mistakes that led to one of the most awkward nights ever.  This makes losing my virginity seem like the best moment of my life. Mistake #1: Not finding the idea of a ""ball"" at a ""pub"" in irving park in anyway suspicious Mistake #2: Assuming any ""new menu"" at a pub (especially one that offers coupons)  is anything but on par with a restaurant featured on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares (more on this below) Mistake #3: Showing up in a totally ferocious black ruffly cocktail dress, five inch heels, fishnets and a giant peacock feather at the pub at 7pm. (they said to dress up!! WHAT??)  Mistake #4: Not leaving immediately after someone asked me if I was one of the burlesque performers.  Mistake #5: Not leaving when we found the ""dining room"" completely empty save for some of the cast of the Belmont Burlesque eating.  Especially after the assclown employee on the phone the day before said he couldn't ""guarantee"" a reservation at 715, and we'd absolutely have to come at 7.  Mistake #6: Not leaving after seeing a quite dilapidated and dirty music venue decorated with crepe flowers like an effing high school dance, which undermined any hopes of the dancing appearing in anyway classy or sexy.  Also, the emcee looked and sounded like all he wanted to do was go home and drink and bottle of jim and never think about the night again (i understand how he felt) Mistake #7: Buying 5 drinks that might as well have had no alcohol, because even a lightest of lightweights like myself should be in the bathroom hugging a toilet after 5 drinks, not stone sober and with such a lucid memory of this terrible experience (and their was no cider AND they had no ginger ale) Mistake #8: Assuming I could get a cab at 1000 (I'm surprised we even stayed over an hour) in Irving Park. (its sad when taking 2 buses in stilletos and fishnets while it was snowing was the highlight of the night) So, to be fair, I can only review the Abbey Pub in terms of their special event, but jesus, it was terrible.  The food was equally terrible.  The ""all you can eat"" fish and chips were made with burnt oil and they left all the oil in the cone, so the fries were like jello and the fish tasted like the bottom of a fryer.  and when you want ""more"" you get one piece of fish at a time.  my salad was good and fresh but my chicken and green beans were like frozen smart and final entrees.  I don't want to think about this anymore.",0.8212,0.761,0.124,0.115,0.6591498572349636

Seriously, even though a friend of mine used to barmaid there, I had never been to the Abbey Pub before Kyle H.'s show there recently.  Mostly because I couldn't find it.   And I'm not alone.  A friend of mine and her husband (both usually good with maps) also got lost on the way to the show.  They stopped into, of all places, Christina's Place (home of $2 Guinness) and the bartender there said, ""after the Abbey Pub rips you off and makes you pay five dollars for a Guinness, come back here and we'll treat you right."" And nothing against my usual karaoke place, but really it's apples v. oranges (or shamrocks).  Sure the drink prices are expensive at Abbey Pub as a bar (especially for Irving Park - though it must be said the Abbey is one of the most upscale bars in this neighborhood), but as a concert venue it's top rate (Christina's can call me when they book J. Mascis to sing karaoke).  The acoustics and sightlines are great in the spacious back concert hall and the live entertainment in the front bar is an added touch. And at least at a smaller weekday show, they let us all roam between the two bars. Though I'm not sure about how they handle this on weekends. This is an extremely large bar on the inside as well and I found the staff extremely friendly - one of them was even *gasp* Irish (try finding that at many pubs in Chicago).  I actually want to come back and try the full bar menu.  And now that I know where it is and its great mystery is revealed this shouldn't be as much of a problem.",0.9906,0.825,0.133,0.042,0.4457366707366708

When I finally made it through the first door everyone was packed in the entrance way so tightly people were literally fighting to make it through the final set of doors. The security guards were not keeping any order, giving any directions, or even checking id's. They were simply standing in the door way yelling at us to back up, even though no one could move. Even the people that had already gotten in and gotten stamped were not able to re-enter through the packed crowd of people. In the end, I missed half of the show, seriously thought I had frost bite on my feet and experience a mosh pit situation even before entering the concert.

I drink Smithwicks here($5). Top shelf mixed drinks are $6. There is food. Also pretty typical bar fare with some Irish influence, like Shepard's pie. It is still bar food though. The pizza is a non greasy but crunchy crust. WAY too much cheese on top and the tomatoes looked like the ones from Taco Bell.   The bad side... poor customer service starts at the top. The location, layout of the venue and the fact that you can get beer and food all night will keep this place from falling apart but I'm still irritated with the service.  I tried to buy tickets a week in advance for a show on a Saturday night. I wasn't worried about it selling out, I wanted to lock myself into going and save a few dollars. I was told that the ticket maker was broken and I would need to buy online or the day of the show. So basically, for the 7 tickets I needed, I'm spending between $14(door) and $35(fees for ticketweb) EXTRA because they won't write my name on the Will Call list and take my cash.  I wrote the general manager an e-mail asking if there was another solution... like he reimburse me for the mark up that according to their website I could avoid by buying in advance. No response.  So my group spent $84 on show tickets, 3 drinks each ( I was the only one drinking beer $18 (with tip), $128 (with tip) on mixed drinks. We ate  chips & salsa $4, sandwich $6, 2 pizzas $30 ($15 tip for food). We paid $285 ($38 of that in tips) to the Abbey Pub, but that's not worth the managers time to compensate for their ticket machine being out of order.  Did I mention that there were about 20 people total in the venue that night? If you've ever been here, you can imagine how empty it looked on a Saturday night to have no one in there.

I guess this bar has the longest running open mic night in Chicago (some 14yrs or something) Tuesdays are also $3 burger and Fries day. The burger was yummy, covered in onions, lettuce ,tomatoes and on a toasted bun...the way I like it. Totally worth the $3. And Miller lite drafts are $2. Nice!  They look to have pretty good deals everyday of the week, something cool to check out ...maybe. Not too many people there for the open mic, but I suppose it WAS Tues...and a lot of them were older dudes that probably have done these since they were 20. But the music was, over all ,nice to listen to.  The negative stars come from the smokey atmosphere that seemed to just be STUCK in the wall even when no one was smoking around you...and the fact that taxi's do NOT come around this area. I stood outside for 5min and realized, crap... I'm going to have to wait and call for one. That sucked! It seems like an OK place, and I can say I've been there, but i hope the next time he does one of these ""gigs"" - he does it somewhere else!",0.9828,0.756,0.171,0.072,0.5341666666666668

Fats forward to just a few days ago and I can not believe all of GZM fit on the tiny stage (they had eight band members).  Beers were expensive, if an Amstel Light is the cheapest at 4.50 and a Goose Island draught is five bucks.  The actual setting wasn't bad, seemingly tucked away upstairs are tables and chairs for the 'oldies' who'd rather sit and watch a band rather than stand and risk getting bumped into by drunkards.

2007-10-28,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place, but it just wouldn't let me. I've been here a couple times and have not been impressed on any of these trips. First of all, the Abbey doesn't really have the feel of a pub. It was more like just another bar with some shamrocks tacked on the wall. The back room is a concert hall, but is bottom-of-the-barrel in the way of music venues. Secondly, the staff was horrible. I don't think a single person in there knows what hospitality means. The bartender was a quack, very unattending. Just thinking he had the audacity to demand a tip made me laugh. In the concert area, the Cro-Magnon waitresses just stand around like wallflowers, never approaching anyone to ask them if they want a drink. The bouncers looked like they were stoned. Another strike against this place are the prices. $3.50 for a domestic? What a joke. The stage is very small [and I'm not talking about the jam band one in the bar area]. If your band is more than three members, you are going to be cramped. The floor is decent sized. There is a balcony area with tables, but it is not very practical because the ceiling is so low you have to be a hunchback to not hit your head maneuvering up there. I will give the Abbey Pub two stars because they occasionally get a decent band to play there, and it is easy to get to being right on Elston. North Elston Avenue is about as clear as a drag strip. Free parking can be found within a few blocks. However, I say don't go here unless one of your favorite bands is doing a show.",0.9715,0.805,0.131,0.064,0.39811728395061724

2007-10-26,4.0,"I've become a fairly big fan of the Abbey over the years. I have been coming for sometime to watch the shows b/c my friends boyfriend plays there pretty regularly. It's a decent space, but even with the upstairs it can get crowded and a little stuffy. The wait staff is pretty great and the prices (for drinks) aren't astronomical. From what I've seen, admission to the shows tends to vary depending on the bands performing or how many are set to play that night. But the bands usually get discount fliers they can pass out, so if you can get one of those, I think it drops the admission price a few bucks.  In addition to the music-venue area, there is an actual pub to the left when you enter (go figure... seriously, it took me a few visits to know it was there). It's a pretty laid back spot and the service is also great in there. They usually have live music going on in the pub as well (mostly Irish folk bands and the like). What I like is that you can go from the larger music venue that hosts a lot of loud bands, to just sitting in the pub with a beer and some friends listening to the folk bands. You never hear the other venue except when someone opens the door to come or go. It's nice to have that option if it's extremely busy or crowded in either area.",0.9911,0.831,0.161,0.008,0.4670138888888889

Every once in a while some lovely chap or lady will decide to jump in every which direction and tell you they love the music so much they need to jostle everyone around, but this can be easily avoided by going to the balcony rather early and sitting at a table to watch the stage with rather good sight lines. The stage itself appeals due to its similarities to various black box theaters in which I've performed. It automatically gives me a feel of intimacy and as if there is nothing to hide. Bands on stage pretty much have what they have, and you can see what's going to be used and not. This may ruin some element of surprise from larger shows, but it's also nice to have a level of excitement and anticipation.

It took the guy nearly two minutes to give me change back from the twenty I handed him.  That experience aside, the Abbey is just like any other dirty craphole music venue.",0.3818,0.789,0.112,0.1,0.5328703703703704
