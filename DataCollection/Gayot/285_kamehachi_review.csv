2011-05-04,1.0,"A BIG MISTAKE!!! I am amazed at folks who are giving great reviews for this restaurant. Here is our story: I went to Kamehachi (240 E Ontario) with a bunch of friends two of whom were Japanese. We read the reviews and picked this restaurant because it was supposed to offer ""traditional Japanese food."" Our Japanese friends were delighted to see the names of traditional Japanese foods in the menu but when they ordered them, they found out that they were actually not that traditional. Not only their traditional food was bad, their sushi was the tiniest rolls I have ever seen and really expensive. A combo was not enough for one person! Not only their food was expensive, their service sucked. One of my friends asked for an additional bowl when the waitress brought his food. The waitress could not explain that the food he ordered comes with a bowl of rice and she will get him another empty bowl shortly.  Here comes the fun part. Few people have mentioned they overcharge. I had a funny incident: I asked the waitress if the combo was enough for two people to share. She said it was not enough. I then told her I do not want a combo and I ordered bunch of individual rolls. When the order came, everything was in one plate, the rolls were small and I ate them all. In the bill I was surprised to see that they had charged me for the combo. I was even more surprised that two people could eat a whole combo and two dozen rolls. I was the most surprised by the attitude of the waitress: when I told her that we had not ordered the combo she tried to argue we did. When she could not argue anymore, she told us to wait and left, she came back shortly after and gave us the bill in which she had removed the combo and angrily told us,""even though you ate the combo, I will have to pay for it now!"" It was never my intention to not pay for it but I still wanted to clarify that we had not ordered it. But that attitude ruined the evening.  At the end, we paid $50 instead of $80. But their food is not worth the price. There are many good sushi restaurants in Chicago. This is not one of them.  Thumbs up: 1. Ambiance Thumbs down: 1. Service 2. Portions (smallest sushi rolls) 3.

After that I went back with a more experienced sushi eater, Monte Rueb, owner of the giant indoor headshop mall Bizarre Bazaar, he taught me the right way to eat sushi. It's hard to believe there was a time where sushi was foreign and weird. Now U.S. kids grow up with it. The current Kamehachi is owned by the same family, different generation. They have a dark, romantic upstairs that you might miss if you don't know it is there.  We still eat here all of the time. It's always good. We also order carry-out.

2010-04-07,4.0,"I know some people drive from miles over to eat here, but since we lived down the street, it became as much a neighborhood diner as chipotle, potbelly's, or west egg across the street.  The restaurant itself is in the basement, and the decor is typical Japanese zen style, calm, soothing, and simply oozes fresh-ness.  The restaurant is rarely packed, so the calming quiet atmosphere holds most of the time. The sushi is pretty standard affair, very fresh fish, good construction, overall pretty tasty.  There are plenty of places in Chicago that offer equally delicious (if not better) sushi for the same price (or less), but since this was so convenient for us, it usually won out if we craved sushi. What's cool about Kamehachi, however, is how delicious the other stuff on the menu is.  The softshell crab is a can't-miss.  Perfectly fried crispy, you will definitely wish they gave you more per order.  In fact, we always started our meals with the softshell crab.  The asparagus beef rolls are a great way to start the meal for those craving some warm cooked meat.   The agedashi tofu is also a good choice, but definitely plays second (or third) fiddle to the aforementioned.   Their udon noodles is delish, especially the Nabeyaki.  The broth is just as you would expect it, filled with umami (the fifth flavor).  The noodles are perfectly cooked each time we've had it, and the tempura has just enough batter to be crispy but not enough such that you feel like you're at Long John Silver's.  The teriyaki (any meat) is solid, as you would expect from a japanese restaurant. What really REALLY hits the spot, however, (and we think this is one of their hidden dishes that no one really knows), is their lamb chops.  For some reason, the chops just really hits the spot for us.  You just have to try it.  The menu says it's marinated in ""garlic-sesame soy sauce"" but we think it's crack-cocaine.  Seriously, it's that good.  You will be chomping at the bone, literally, and sucking your fingers to get every last bit of flavor.  Each bite is literally an orgasm in your mouth, as wet and juicy as the real thing.  It really is one of their best dishes, and a hidden treasure among the dinner entrees (aka meat dishes for those who don't like raw fish). In all, what makes this restaurant great is not their sushi.  No, you would expect that the sushi is good.  Rather, it is the delightful dishes they offer that complements the cold raw fish.  A warm sake served with their lamb chops and a side of asparagus beef rolls, with their crispy softshelled crab to start, and you would think you were at a different restaurant.  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed!",0.9989,0.767,0.217,0.017,0.48034866368199697

I'm not a huge tempura fan, but I really liked the spring roll, which came wrapped in slightly disconcerting pastel colored rice paper.  Entrees: I ordered a futomaki roll (good to eat, not very pretty as you attempt to shove a too large disc of food in your gullet) and a shitake maki (can't ever get enough!) My companion got the salmon skin maki and the spicy tuna deluxe, which he enjoyed more. The verdict was that the salmon skin was a bit on the salty side. Dessert: I almost never save room for dessert, but we saw the mochi and had to give it a go, so we ordered 2 green tea mochi. The perfect size for that post-sushi throwdown. The atmosphere was comfortable, the service was swift and attentive.

2010-02-22,3.0,"I had a decently yummy experience at Kamehachi this Valentine's Day Eve. The atmosphere is nice. Nothing super creative, but you know, nice. Randomly, I'm pretty sure I heard a parrot in the back when I was heading to the bathroom, but that could also have been a small child. They have a few private rooms in the back that you can reserve, but it costs $10 extra according to OpenTable (which I think is a little ridiculous if you only want a 2-person room).  What I remember most is that I had a really nice cocktail. I forget what it was called exactly, but it was some sort of green tea mojito. Mojitos are my favorite, so this immediately gave Kamehachi a-ok status in my books.  I ordered the Combination Dinner (chicken teriyaki, mixed tempura, rice, miso soup, California roll). Now, this comment may be partially influenced by my visit to Hot Doug's a mere 4 hours before, but it was a lot of food - especially the tempura. In fact, there was even bonus food in the form of a pile of cooked spinach with peanut sauce, which wasn't mentioned in the menu. It was yummy, but there were two weird things about my meal: the tempura shrimp tasted oddly fishy, and the chicken looked a little too ""perfect"". It sounds weird, but it looked like it had been purchased with pre-made grill lines on it and then steamed or something. It tasted fine - really nice actually, but the look of it put me off a bit. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, but I've had equally delicious bentos for 5, even 10 dollars less (Vancouver FTW). My boyfriend enjoyed his Kamehachi Combo (4 assorted sushi pieces, spicy tuna roll, California roll, miso soup). It wasn't really anything special, though. Just good, solid, sushi. Kamehachi is a pretty decent place. Not cheap, and it's not going to blow you away, but enjoyable enough for me to return sometime when I'm in the neighborhood and try some of their interesting-sounding rolls.

The miso soup was good and seasoned very well, but when our food came I was thoroughly disappointed. I ordered the spider roll and 5 pieces of sashimi - the spider roll was OK, not great, just ok and small for the price.

I'll be back for it over summer. The shumai and gyoza were lovely and tempura broccoli - probably not terribly authentic - was amazing.

The downstairs and upstairs levels have different atmospheres. Downstairs is brightly lit with cubicle-like booths, minimalist and almost sterile appearance. Upstairs is very dimly lit, almost to the point of darkness, and it would not be possible to read the menus were it not for a single yellowish lamp projecting a beam onto the table. Basically all American ""sushi bars"" are an American concept which serve up something different than sashimi as found in Japan. So I recommend the original location because it is first and foremost a restaurant, not a bar, and the other foods on the menu besides ""sushi"" are relatively authentic.

We've dined in, carried out, and had them deliver party trays we customized for home parties. ALWAYS first class sushi. Always well presented.  Their space is large, which hurts the intimacy many sushi restaurants present. And it's often not crowded, so service is good but atmosphere is nonexistent. Ordering takeout is as slow as ordering sushi when dining in, so if you want takeout, either call ahead or plan to wait 20+ minutes for your order.

2008-12-01,4.0,"We came by for lunch on Black Friday and it was pretty dead in there.  There were a few tables with a larger group of diners, but generally it was pretty quiet in there.  Everyone must have been too busy shopping. The restaurant is set in the basement and has a large dining area with exposed wood everywhere.  Some of my dining mates thought the wood was a veneer, but upon closer inspection, it looks to be real.  I'm not sure why this is important, but no one likes the girl who is hot only because of too much make-up and nice clothes right? The sushi was good.  They offer several sushi combination plates meant to feed 6 or more people.  We did not order this because some of my fellow diners were sushi noobs or a bit intimidated by some of the items.  I'm not sure if this is a good value or not but the menu looked rather long and large.   We ordered several rolls and everything was delicious.  The green turtle roll and the sunset roll were both very good. I'd also like to point out that our server was very attentive.  She didn't hover over us, but she definitely kept an eye on us and was always ready to bring over more drinks, menus, or just to check up on us",0.9863,0.764,0.176,0.06,0.5687061087061087

2008-11-11,3.0,"I was meeting some peeps here for my friend's birthday.  We ended up with a table of ten in a private room divided by one of those semi-see through doors you'd see in Memoirs of a Geisha.  I was told to wear nice socks because they said I might need to take my shoes off and sit my ass on a pillow.  Which made me nervous, but luckily my socks hadn't all been poked through by my overgrown big toenail on my right foot.  They allowed footwear and they put my ass in a chair, so no worries there. We ordered martini's while the other celebrants travelled.  I'd taken the Grand bus from home by myself, it was cold and rainy, kind of a depressing way to start a Friday.  Once everyone arrived and I got my first martini in me I felt good.  All the dinner participants were fun and the room privacy ensured free form conversation unencumbered by societal pressures of normalcy.  A couple people ordered saki bottles, I didn't like it so much, I would've rather just had Sambuca without the ricey flavor, chilled not warm. I ate sushi combo-A, which is the one with the raw fish on top of the rice bed.  I believe that's called nigiri, but I could be wrong.    The dude sitting next to me got the sea urchin roe, which also has a name I can't think of; uni, yes uni.  I tried it, but I don't like all those gooey, pastey, gelatinous textures eaten in Asia.  I got enough baby food when I was in diapers.  The mackerel roll in my sushi combo was too gamey; I mean fishy.  Reminded me of a fishing trip on spring break freshman year, whole other story.  The staff was very accomodating and helped serve all the birthday cupcakes.  If it's me choosing I'd probably go to Butterfly because it's close to me and the bill would've been 64% less than Kamehachi.  However, it was a good time and I have a credit card so who cares.",0.8304,0.792,0.11,0.097,0.5193959314495029

Service - exceptional! I was earlier than my dining companion, and much appreciated that I was neither ignored nor prodded constantly by our table host. I ordered a hot tea, and settled to study the menu, never noticing how the hot towel was whisked away or the tea constantly replenished while I waited! Discreet yet thorough - the table staff definitely impressed Food - the menu is extensive.

I went here w/4 friends and ppl ordered a variety of things.  I had the tonkatsu, which was solid, but a bit on the expensive side (and this is coming from someone who moved from SF, maybe it's supply-demand or just the dwntwn effect).  The beef-aspagarus roll would have been better if it wasn't completely immersed in teriyaki sauce.  The gyoza was done well, but that is expected (it would take quite a bit to ruin premade gyoza).  I didn't eat any rolls/sushi myself, but I don't know if it's a Chicago thing - each nigiri order is 1 piece? In Tokyo/Taipei/SF, nigiri usually comes in 2s.  My friends thought the fish was fresh.  Personally, I thought for the price, the portions alloted (to the Sashimi Moriawase for instance) were a bit on the small side. The place did have a nice looking bar and fairly expansive sake menu to its credit.  Also of note, we originally were going to have 8 ppl, but they sat us at this weird ovular table, which wasn't all that comfortable for our legs even with 5 ppl.   Probably deserves something more like 3.5 stars, extra half stars for the bar and proximity to me, minus half star for the lame izakaya claim.",0.8529,0.816,0.113,0.07,0.5243055555555555
