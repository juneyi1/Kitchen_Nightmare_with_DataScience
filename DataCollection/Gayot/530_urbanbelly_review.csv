2017-08-19,4.0,"Urban belly is a great place to get dinner with a group of friends in a upscale casual setting, and serves as a good introduction to Asian fusion.  Here's a quick rundown of all the dishes we tried: Phat rice - greasy goodness; would be a perfect post hangover meal! Urban belly ramen- there portion was huuuuuge and the broth was flavorful and packed with vegetables. The noodles were so-so Pea shoot Madras curry rice- one of two vegetarian options. The dish was a bit dry and I think the curry portion was really just the powder and not the actual curry  Wok fried rice cakes with shrimp- so, so good! The stir fry sauce was equal parts sweet, salty, umami packed, and spicy. The shrimp was juicy and flavorful and all the components of this dish went together like a dream  Rice and salad bowl with BBQ pork belly - the picked vegetables in this packed a real punch. The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and so was the pork. A must try! We came here on a Friday night and while bellyQ next door was packed, this place was relatively empty and our group of 6 was able to quickly situate ourselves at one of the many wooden tables in the outdoor seating area.  Urban Belly does not have full service. You have to order at the counter, take a number, and your order to brought to your table. The menu is about half an A4 sheet, with a little more than a dozen appetizer and entree options, a kiddy menu, desserts, and libations. I thought that it was a clever to have a whittled down menu which would not be overwhelming. Within the entree options, there are rice dishes, noodles dishes, and ramen. Of course, the menu isn't very inclusive of dietary preferences, but I don't think urban belly was a place intended for those with restrictive diets. One of my dining companions was a vegetarian, and he chose the Madras curry pea shoot dish (one out of two possible choices). I went with the wok fried rice cakes with shrimp, my boyfriend picked the rice and salad bowl with BBQ pork, and my other friends picked the urban belly ramen and the phat rice, along with a plate of the pork and coriander dumplings. All of our portions were huge for the price! Service was really quick! My boyfriend got his order a couple of seconds after he got back to our table after placing the order. All of our orders were at our table under ten minutes. The seating area is really well done up, with string lights, and a wall of Hebru Brantley's art. The tables can be a bit grimy, and we had to all the staff to clean the previous party's litter from our table. The restaurant is in a slightly off traffic location, near a few parks and the green line L station. Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for a quick, cheap (under $15) and flavor packed meal!",0.9808,0.891,0.086,0.022,0.4035076252723312

The food was decent, but it was just too much of us doing the work. Maybe I'm getting too old fashioned for these counter service places. I don't mind if I order from the counter and have to grab a couple things, but I made four trips from the counter to our table to serve our family of three (all drinks, utensils, spare bowls, ) etc. If I'm going to put in that much work, I'll just cook for our family at home.",0.3182,0.968,0.032,0.0,0.2095238095238095

Urban belly ramen broth is little watery comparing to miso based broth you'll find in other ramen shop. Main disappointment was the amount of noodles, leaving me still hungry wanting for more... Phat rice was good, but I find that too salty and had to keep drinking water during and afterwards. Also ordered a special $3 fries with curry mayo and that turned out to be the best among the three things we ordered.

I want to give it a higher rating simply because their happy hour special is amazing. $5 pitcher of frosty Kirin??? HELLOOOO. I would come here just to drink.  On the other hand, since it's not really a bar and more of a restaurant, I have to say that the food is kind of.....interesting. My friend ordered the ramen and it looked just mediocre. The Charsiu was overcooked and a bit big/unwieldy. Which I feel, shouldn't be a descriptor used with Charsiu.  I got the recommendation to try their rice cake pad Thai which was a very odd combination indeed. I absolutely LOVE rice cake in all forms and this just felt kind of out of place. The sauce didn't even really taste like pad Thai at all. It was like someone put some sambal on top of some rice cakes wth cilantro and mint. IDK guys.

2017-07-09,5.0,"Yum!!! my First dinner in chicago was a success! don't be afraid to ask questions. the cashier is SO helpful and may even offer you samples.  Things i've discovered: the spiked lemonade was too sweet for me. Wheat berries are kind of like a thick coated grain, similar to brown rice in my opinion. The ramen was sweet too. I would say the ramen broth is less of a ramen broth and more of a tom yum broth, sweet and tangy and not at all what i'd like in my ramen. thankfully i didn't order the ramen for myself :) I ordered the phat noodles and was very happy with my choice: it came with three types of meat and was perfectly flavored sweet and salty. My friends enjoyed their rice bowls, and i would say the portion is perfect for one person, not too much and not too little.

The beef, pork and chicken were flavorful but didn't work so well with the lemon grass fried rice. I think I would enjoy it more if the 3 toppings were served with white rice as that would mk it less salty n draw out the flavors of the toppings.

2017-06-27,4.0,"Urbanbelly is everything I hope for when I'm in the mood for hearty Asian fusion. It's the more casual portion of the restaurant (Belly Q being the fancier, sit down side), so it's order at the counter and grab your own seating, which is a-ok with me!  I absolutely love the Rice & Salad bowl with tofu. The pickled veggies and perfectly soft boiled egg make this dish a knock out. My one tiny critique is that they use some type of herb/green that tastes really funky to me, but no matter how many times I've tried to ask what it is (so that I can ask if they can please leave it out), no one is able to tell me. Not a huge deal, but it would make it a 5-star place if they had someone who knew the ingredients like the back of their hand.  The BF has tried the Ramen, Pho and Phat Rice, and can't pick a favorite because he loved them all.  The PB&J dessert with chunky peanut butter, handmade jam and delicious soft serve is also swoon worthy. It's not a large portion, but it can easily be shared between two to satisfy a sweet tooth. It's been featured as one of the best casual desserts in Chicago.

The phat Noodle was flavorful sweet with a couple different types of meant piled to the top of the bowl and full of noodles at the bottom.

The food came out in a good amount of time. They also had self served water. If you are looking for a place that serves you they don't.

2017-05-10,4.0,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. Heads up, even though this is in West Loop, it's on the FAR WEST side of west loop, so beware if you're thinking about walking to this from say ogalvie's station. Once arriving, you start ordering your food at the counter. They have a lot of options from ramen (their specialty) to rice dishes to curries. Heads up, I'd recommend getting the 1/2 bowl order of ramen because it's massive. I couldn't even finish the 1/2 bowl order I did. After ordering, you get a number and take a seat. The seating is bench style, seat yourself. The décor is nice, they have this ""plant-wall"" where plants are planted all over this area on the wall, makes a good spot for group pictures ;). Overall, the food was great, it made it nice you don't have to make reservations, you can just seat yourself. It wasn't busy when we got there (6pm), but it started filling up later on. This is a good place for group dinners or when you're not sure how many people are going to show up (hence the NO reservations required).

It was quite obvious that this place was opened by a non Asian owner as the broth and everything was too rich for my liking. Once you go inside the restaurant, you pretty much order on the board and and pick whatever you like and they give you a number and you find your seat. I kinda wish there was more pictures on what I will be ordering versus ordering on the board and not having any pictures. After I got my order, I sampled the broth and it was hella rich and a bit salty and I really wish they let me choose the choice of pork belly cut ( Chashu or Kukuni) if you don't know the different cuts in terms of ramen then you are not eating the right ramen. Nonetheless, it came with Chashu cut and it was sooo fatty. So I do eat pork belly but not when there's more fat than the meat itself. I pretty much consumed an entire lard in my stomach. The portion size wasn't big compared to how much broth they gave you. I was forced to order extra noodles because I was still hungry and again too much broth.

I should have known right away that there was something suspicious about how quickly the food got to our table.  In terms of how the food tasted - it was over-spiced.

I like the counter service style too.  Your order and pay at the counter, they'll bring your food out to you at the table.  It's freaky fast, but this is no Jimmy John's. The Phat Noodles were delicious!  Everything is in this bowl:  lemongrass chicken, pork belly, braised beef, noodles, and veggies.  I loved the thickness of the noodles and all of the spices.  I went wild with the two sauces at the table, a hot sauce and a mystery sauce that had no label.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-13 range, and the Phat Noodles were worth every penny. I arrived here borderline hangry, but still had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.  Those little bowls are bigger than they look! I tried all of the potstickers, and the pork and cilantro were generally the favorite.  I can only say good things about the beef and cheddar and the sweet potato potstickers though!  I did think that these are overpriced though.  $7 gets you 4 potstickers, which is hard to share with a group. Sundays are BYOB, with no corkage fee, but I completely forgot.  Luckily, they serve a variety of bottled beer and cocktails.  There's a ""create your own"" cocktail option, for $5.  When was the last time you got a GOOD cocktail for $5?  Try the Vietnamese iced coffee with the Japanese whiskey.

The Plain-Belly Sneetches had none upon thars...""  Urban Belly, like Dr. Seuss, defies characterization. The restaurant serves Asian inspired street food but you wouldn't call it pan-Asian. It is casual and quick, but it's not fast food. My favorite, must-have, can't-leave-without item is the Katsu Rice Noodle Cake Soup Bowl. The soup is very spicy but rich with complex flavor. The chewy noodles are mixed in with some kind of dumplings and the chicken katsu. It's a ""must order"". I also like the eggplant appetizer which is on the sweet side offset by vinegar but very fresh and light. Everything else is good but these are the standout items for me. Much more dubious than the food is the Kirin Frozen Beer Slushy.  Never had it. It's probably great but I'm not up for trying it. The restaurant sits at the peaceful end of the Randolph Street Food Conniption, closer to the United Center than the Loop. There is usually parking and never a wait. It sits alongside BellyQ, a more conventional and upscale restaurant, but I'm not sure the food is more tasty there. At Urban Belly, the décor is relaxed and the tables and highboys all have stools. Lots of distressed wood gives the place a handmade feel, and the huge wall photo of horses is just confusing. Still, you'll love the soup and probably won't notice the other stuff.

I ordered the Phat Rice which has lemongrass chicken, pork belly, braised beef and pineapple. We also ordered the pork and cilantro dumplings. My hubby got the wheat bibimbap.  The service was good and our food came out promptly. The Phat Rice was very yummy! I loved the pineapple, it complimented the various meats in the rice! Tasty! The pork and cilantro dumplings were good, but nothing special. I really can't wait to go back and try the ramen! I've heard good things about it!  The atmosphere is nice.

We originally tried going to Belly-Q, but since it was only 4:30 and they weren't opened yet, the hostess suggested that we try their sister restaurant Urban Belly. I am so glad we did! My boyfriend and I ordered way more food than we should have for just the two of us, but we got so excited reading the menu, there were things we just had to try! We both love a good Asian fusion menu, we couldn't resist! We went with the Korean Chicken wings, the Waygu and Cheddar dumplings, the Urbanbelly Ramen with chicken instead of pork, and the Asian Bolognese. The chicken wings were the weakest, but they were still yummy! There was a creamy horseradish sauce to dip them in that was very flavorful.  The dumplings also had a similar horseradish sauce on top of them, which gave them the perfect amount of spice. They were light, crispy, and delicious. Next, the ramen. The broth had a great flavor to it, and they even made it with chicken per our request. I was surprised because usually a chicken based broth falls weak on the flavor, but theirs certainly did not. The noodles had the perfect amount of bite to them also. Lastly, the Bolognese. This menu item was a thing of my dreams. It was truly amazing!!! They took their perfectly cooked, silky udon noodles, and topped them off with a delicious pork ragu. The sauce wasn't your traditional Bolognese though, it had an Asian kick to it that was unworldly. I will definitely be coming back for this dish! The only reason this isn't getting the full 5 stars is because of the service. We asked someone working for a ramen spoon when they dropped off the food, and were told he'd be right back with it. Instead, he proceeded to walk back and forth past us plenty of times without any spoon.",0.9976,0.761,0.21,0.029,0.5892573696145125
2016-02-08,5.0,"My experience with Urbanbelly was pretty out of the ordinary. While in Chicago for work, my colleagues/friends and I came to Urbanbelly for dinner. Because it was Superbowl Sunday, one of my associates asked if the restaurant had a TV (I couldn't care less about sports bowl). The manager was within earshot. And I guess because there were so few patrons in the restaurant, he offered up their tasting lounge for us to watch the game. To which I asked if it meant we would be ordering from their sister restaurant, BellyQ. He responded by handing me one of each menu and said, ""feel free to order from either menu."" Talk about accommodating! And really, I don't like to be catered to. The manager really went out of his way though, and I'm sure it was because it was such a slow night. Regardless, he didn't have to. He chose to. And we were very, very appreciative. Immediately, this was a really good experience. But then the food started to arrive, and a really good experience became a FANTASTIC experience. So much so, that I'll have to write a separate review for the BellyQ menu items I had. Let's start with the dumplings: I don't know which I enjoyed more, the duck & pho dumpling or the pork and cilantro. Both were very unique. I expected the duck dumplings to be heavy, but they're really not. And mind you, I'm one of those people for whom cilantro can be a little overwhelming. But the pork dumplings were delicious too.  What really blew me away though was the ""asian bolognese"". This was a heavier, more dense dish, naturally. But it still wasn't as heavy as the traditional bolognese I find in most restaurants. It was a very interesting spin. I think it's because of the udon noodles. But the combination of pork, black bean sauce, and tomatoes really makes this dish stand out. Long after I was full, I couldn't bare to let the bolognese go to waste. When I set foot on, or even near, Chicago soil again, I'll be making a b-line for Urbanbelly.",0.9333,0.89,0.073,0.036,0.4934722222222221

Rice dishes and noodle dishes range from $9-$13.  A pitcher of Kirin beer was $10 or $3 for a pint.  If you happen to partake in ""a la card chicago"" you will find that both Urbanbelly and BellyQ are in the deck of cards.   I came here for two reasons: I happened to be visiting the Randolph Street Market just a block down the road (awesome btw), and the $10 card to Urbanbelly.  I had heard good things about it, and nothing gets my stomach growling like Asian food.  Everything on the menu looks good.  My girlfriend and I ordered a pitcher of beer, the Duck and Pho spice dumplings to start, and then I ordered the Phat noodle and she ordered the Rice cake noodle as our entrees.  Ordering is done at the counter, and the ambiance is modern and inviting.  Service is fantastic as we got our food in about 5-10 minutes.  As food goes, we liked the Duck dumplings the best by far.  The dumplings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and were perfectly paired with the cucumber and a little house made hot sauce.  The Phat noodle was disappointing.  The flavor felt like something was missing, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.  The pork belly was my favorite part of the dish.  I wouldn't order it again.  The Rice cake noodle was quite good.  The broth was flavorful and spicy.  The chicken katsu was well cooked.  The mango in the broth was a great idea.  It's a bit on the spicy side so be careful if spice isn't your thing.  My only complaint was the rice cake seemed a bit too much.   Location: 4 stars Environment: 4 stars Service: 5 stars.  The food came out in about 5-10 minutes Taste: 3 stars. see above Price: 4 stars Menu selection: 4 stars. Plenty of meat vs veggie dishes.  Lots of different starch options. Overall: 3.5 stars Will I return: Yes",0.9869,0.839,0.114,0.046,0.5768195896244677

2015-08-07,4.0,"I ordered from Urbanbelly on a Wednesday night using Grubhub. The order came in about 45 minutes, which was okay, although I thought it would be a bit faster. I ordered the Phat Rice and the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was, well, not what I was expecting. Although it did say rice cakes on Grubhub, I assumed that the rice cakes were an addition to the typical noodles in a Pad Thai. I assumed wrong! I received just the rice cakes with sauce, toppings, and grilled (maybe?) shrimp tossed inside. Nevertheless, the food was great. The rice cakes were surprisingly delicious, the shrimps were large and plump, and all the additional toppings like peanuts and garlic complemented the dish well. For $13, the portion was tiny but it was delicious, and I guess I can justify the price...a bit. The Phat Rice was larger compared to the Pad Thai. The rice was cooked just right (al dente, for those wondering), the other little things didn't get in the way of eating, and again, the portion was good (but not great!) for $13. The meats (ground chicken, pork belly, and braised beef short ribs) were definitely on point. I didn't notice the chicken too much because it was ground up and mixed with the rice, but the pork belly, which was a bit dry, was soft and tasty and the short rib was chewy but had a melt-in-your-mouth texture. All three meats had a great taste, although the Chicken was just a tad bit bland. There were ample amounts of meat compared to the rice, and by the end, I found myself debating whether or not I should order again the next day. Overall, a very delicious dish. Solid 5 stars for food, but knocking one star off for rather small portions and big prices. So far the best food I had in Chicago without stepping outside the hotel!",0.9919,0.856,0.138,0.006,0.5349319727891156
2015-08-07,4.0,"Another date night, another excuse to try something new in the city! We LOVE trying the restaurants on W. Randolph (it's the new up and coming restaurant row!), and we do love our Asian fusion. It gives me ideas on what I can try at home with whatever Korean cuisine background I have (being Korean and all). We were initially confused because we both had no idea that there were two separate restaurants. Urbanbelly is the more ""casual"" one and BellyQ is the ""sit-down menu"" one. After looking over both menus, we decided we were in a more casual mood and ordered our food at the counter. They give you a number to take to your table and bring out the food to you when it's ready. It was a GORGEOUS evening, so we sat outside in the patio area. LOVE the urban mural on the wall with the stringed lights for added decor. Really gives me that Chicago summer patio vibe and it's wonderful. The inside is beautiful too. They have a wall with lush green plants and industrial-type lighting with glass that makes it look like huge light bulbs. I am probably not describing it well, so just take a look at the photos of the interior decor to get a better idea. :) Btw, make sure to order their Kirin Ichiban on draft; it is on. point. They top it off with this beer slushie that is just icy enough to keep the beer beneath nice and cold. Are you listening? It's a BEER. SLUSHIE. on top of my already awesome refreshing beer. You guys are taking this to whole other level, yo. And I love it. We've been on a mission to try ramen places in Chicago to compare and find our top favorite. So, of course we ordered the Urbanbelly Ramen ($13) which are the ramen noodles with braised pork belly, mushrooms & an egg. Let me start with the broth: If Tom Yum and Ramen had a broth baby, it would be this dish. There was a slight sweetness to it (like Tom Yum) and there was also lemongrass, cilantro and mushrooms, all of which can be found in Tom Yum soup. Yet, it was thick like ramen broth, and slightly spicy. Talk about Asian fusion, right? The best of Japanese ramen and Thai soup! The noodles were not the absolute best that I've had, but they were still fairly good. I just couldn't wrap my head around eating a bowl of ramen that had lemongrass and cilantro in it. The egg is added whole (NOT cut in half like most places) because the yolk is runny. When you cut open that thing, get ready for some beautiful egg porn with the ooey-gooey yolk oozing out into your broth. The absolute best part of this dish was the PORK: I mean. WOW. Thick cut (and I mean THICKY THICK, like Beyonce's jelly) pork belly meat, braised to perfection. The outside was perfectly crispy, and it was so tender and juicy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness on the inside. I would order the ramen bowl JUST for the pork. Out of all the pork that I've had in my ramen, this one certainly stole the show. I shall crown thee as our Royal Ramen Pork Belly, behold thy Oink King! We also ordered the Phat Rice because of the reviews that we read here on Yelp (thanks, fellow Yelpers). The Phat Rice bowl is a combination fried Jasmine rice with pineapples, ground chicken, pork belly and braised beef short ribs. This was a little on the sweet side for me, I think I just like my fried rice a little more salty/savory...even the ones that have pineapple in it. But, again, this reminded me of a marriage between Chinese and Thai fried rice. They have a bottle of hot sauce (that looks homemade) at the self-serve utensil/drink cart that you can bring to your table, so we tried the rice with it. I actually wish there was more ""heat"" to the hot sauce, along the lines of what Sriracha offers as far as heat and flavors go. Overall, I want to say that I've had better combo fried rice (fusion or not) and maybe they can try not to make it so sweet? But that's just my humble opinion.",0.9986,0.826,0.158,0.016,0.5302826022705541

There was a small selection of beer but more than enough choices. I like that the tables have small stacks of bowls and chopsticks so you can share your dishes with friends. (Asian food is always better when you can eat family style!)  As for the food and service... It was so-so. The girl at the front who took our orders was nice and explained dishes when we had questions and was very patient. She also was able to substitute shrimp for pork in the ramen for one of the diners in our group who doesn't eat pork. However when our food came out, the substituted ramen arrived much later than the other entrees. We were all practically done with our food by the time the ramen came out. We ordered two of the duck pho and spice dumplings which were tasty. Nothing mind-blowing but still delicious. I had the phat rice which again was tasty but I didn't feel excited about it. I also didn't have short ribs on mine which I didn't notice until half way into my meal. Again, it wasn't horrible food but it didn't exactly leave me impressed either.

First off you could feed two people with the ramen.  You get a huge bowl and thankfully it's really good.  You get some pork belly and a full soft boiled egg in the broth as well.  Sometimes I'm not a huge fan of how pork belly is prepared but here I loved it.  The broth had great flavor, you could really taste all the herby and spicy goodness in there.  The phat rice was pretty good too. Not a show stopper but the short rib was really tender and the pineapples were a nice touch.  I added a little of that orange garlic sauce to it and it went together perfectly.  Not to mention I got a Kirin Ichiban draft for $3?!

2015-07-21,3.0,"If I could pick 3 foods that I wouldn't get tired of eating every single day then ramen, dumplings, and rice would be some pretty solid choices. That pretty much sums up Urbanbelly's entire menu. After yet another unsuccessful attempt to dine at High Five Ramen because of the insane wait, I decided to just head down Randolph and finally knock out the last of the belly restaurants I haven't tried yet.  Atmosphere: Urbanbelly has its own space within the BellyQ restaurant. It's one of those places where you order and pay up front at the counter then just seat yourself. We went right before closing on a weekday so it was pretty empty inside. There were a bunch of picnic style communal tables and the decor had a pretty similar vibe to BellyQ  Food: Whenever I see a really small menu, I kind of assume that the place specializes in those items and I expect them to really kill it. While they lived up to their Asian Fusion label from a creativity angle, I wasn't too blown away by the food. Maybe I was just in the mood for some more traditional tasting ramen and dumplings. Pork and cilantro dumplings - These were just ok. The wrapper was a little thin and it didn't have a nice seared edge on the outside that I like. I guess I was expecting more like a potsticker instead of a steamed dumpling. There was also something really minty or maybe it was the cilantro inside, but I thought it dominated the flavor a little bit too much and took some attention away from the pork. $7 for 4 is a bit steep for them too. I know we're not in Chinatown and don't expect them to be 5 for $1, but somewhere in between would've been nice. Wagyu beef and cheddar dumplings - I actually thought these were pretty tasty. They were deep fried, so you got a nice crunch in every bite. The inside had a classic beef and cheese nacho type flavor. They almost reminded me of Totino's rolls with taco filling, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but definitely not worth the price. Urbanbelly Ramen - Right from the start I knew this would taste a little different than a regular bowl of tonkotsu. The first thing I noticed was the orange colored broth. While it wasn't really rich or had a really porky flavor, I gotta admit it was just straight up flavorful. I can't really pinpoint what it reminded me of, but the broth had good saltiness and the slightest hint of spice to it...I really enjoyed it. The noodles were wavey and cooked nicely al dente. It also came with two pieces of pork belly that were seriously the thickest pieces of pork belly I've seen in a bowl of ramen. Nice sear on the outside and plenty of marbling is a solid combo. The egg was soft boiled beautifully but unfortunately mine was cold in the center. Overall I definitely liked the ramen, but without the fattiness and porky flavor it was more of a really tasty soup than ramen to me. Service: I'm pretty sure it was an isolated incident, but they were a few mishaps during the meal. Even though my friend and I ordered the exact same thing, there was a huge time gap between when he got his bowl and when I got mine. Then, when I finally did get my ramen, it was missing the crucial soft boiled egg. It took a while to flag someone down, but when I did, they brought an egg out immediately. The problem was the egg is usually cold and it's heated by the high temperature of the soup. But since mine already cooled off a bit, the egg never really got warm. Such a shame too because it was boiled almost perfectly...just cold in the center for me.  Overall, Urbanbelly has a good menu for a more quick and casual type meal. The food has a nice fusion twist to everything, but the dumplings just made it really expensive for what you get. $24 for a bowl of ramen and 4 dumplings seemed a little steep. I don't regret checking it out, but it probably won't be tops on my list when I'm in the mood for ramen again.",0.9879,0.806,0.117,0.076,0.5421301162605512

2015-07-15,4.0,"A couple of weeks ago my wife and I were invited to check out UrbanBelly, and were glad we did.  The menu here has three main focal points in their offerings, dumplings, grains and noodles.  Of course they also have a kids menu, desserts, beverages etc. but these categories are really what drive the concept.   We decided as good guests should, to try some of each.  We started by trying both the wagyu beef dumplings, consisting of crispy beef wontons with cheddar, romaine, tomato & topped with a horseradish sauce and also the pork & cilantro dumplings which are steamed pork dumplings served with a soy-balsamic sauce.  Normally I am not a huge fan of balsamic anything but in this case it balances the sweetness of the pork so well its difficult to dislike, when you add in the crisp bite the cilantro brings, I was quickly won over.  Next we moved onto grains, selecting two different options, both the lemongrass chicken (jasmine fried rice with scrambled egg & ground chicken) & the phat rice (combination fried rice, ground chicken, pork belly & braised beef short ribs).  There was a beauty in the simplicity of the lemongrass chicken, it was both comforting and well balanced and could easily feed two people.  There is an old saying, any Chef worth his salt can create a great dish with a lot of ingredients, but when you focus on a select few, the execution can be more difficult.  We also tried the phat rice, which is one of UrbanBelly's signature dishes.  At first glance it seems like there is almost too much going on.  However, once you dig in you are...

2015-06-04,5.0,"I love everything about this place. The only thing I don't like is the fact that they don't have one in Virginia.  I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and came here for dinner with a coworker during our business trip. Like everyone else said, there's free 2 hr parking right across the street making it super convenient to eat here. We walked in and immediately liked it. The atmosphere was trendy, chill, and relaxed. The decor is modern and adds to the ambiance. We ordered at the counter and decided to sit outside. I ordered the duck and pho spice dumplings, the urbanbelly ramen, and the peanut butter and jelly soft serve for dessert. My coworker got the pork and cilantro dumplings, the phat rice, and a side of kim chi. The ramen and dumplings came out super quick. The dumplings are a little pricey, 4 for $7.  But they were delicious. The duck was juicy, and the dumplings were fried perfectly. They're garnished with cucumbers and some grapefruit. The ramen was interesting. Good flavors, nice kick to it, and they give you 2 huge pieces of pork belly. Yum. I tried some of my coworkers phat rice as well, and I liked it a lot too. It was a fancy version of fried rice.  The soft serve was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. The berry compote was delish, and the crunchy peanut butter worked so well with the ice cream. I'm still dreaming about that pb and j soft serve. The ramen portion was fairly large, I made my coworker finished some of it because I wanted to save room for dessert. We both walked out of there, extremely stuffed.  There was a little confusion with the numbers they give you when you order. The waiter who brought out our food took our numbers away when we hadn't gotten all our food. Easy fix, the waitress who took our order walked by and we just let her know. She remembered everything we ordered and took care of the rest of it. Not a big deal to me, especially since the food and ambiance makes up for it. They also have a little station outside where you can get your own water (I actually don't mind getting my own water, that let's me get as much as I want. score.) And sauces. Belly Q, the restaurant it's connected to looked really cool as well. We almost came here again for dinner the next night. That's how good it was. Please, please, please come to Virginia! Until then, whenever I'm in Chicago, you will most definitely find me here for a dinner or lunch.",0.9973,0.801,0.177,0.022,0.6129500580720093

I like this dish because of the kimchi flavor in the broth and it's a little spicy, but I don't like that it's again too sweet. The egg and the pork belly are good. Finally, we had Wagyu beef dumpling. This is the most disappointing dish. I don't taste anything but the sauce that they put on top. The sauce is way too overpowering.

I wasn't very fond of the counter service aspect, and I wasn't impressed by the fact that the cashier didn't know whether the rice cakes in the soups were Korean dduk. However, the food was good. I had rice cake, a soup with Korean dduk and donkatsu. My husband and I also split a delicious PB&J for dessert. Sadly, Seoul Sauce wasn't available in the restaurant, so I'm still on the hunt. Perhaps it will be in stock for my next visit. I'd love to go back and try it again!",0.7357,0.87,0.076,0.054,0.4422222222222222

The ambience is fantastic, as you're surrounded by wooden furniture in an artfully run-down factory-like building. The lightings were very carefully placed and I loved it! I had the experience of eating their Wagyu Beef dumplings and Urbanbelly Ramen, and they were both wonderful. The dumplings were extremely juicy and had the asian flavors I was looking for, and the ramen was some of the best you can get in Chicago. Doesn't quite beat the ramen at Wasabi in my opinion, but fantastic nonetheless. I also enjoy the fact that their dishes all seem to be a sort of fusion between different asian cuisines. Furthermore, I tried the Phat Rice and the Rice Cake that some of the others in my party was trying, and I'd have to say, I'm definitely going back there for some more of that.

2015-02-04,4.0,"Three stars for the food itself, but I'm upping to four for the overall experience.   I was really excited to try this place, having heard good things about the ramen here.  Walked in at lunchtime on Saturday, and while there were many diners inside, there was no wait to order.  After you order, you can pick out a place to sit and someone will bring out a pitcher of water, which I thought was a nice extra.   As for the food - I tried the signature Urbanbelly ramen and a side of the duck pho dumplings, along with a bottled drink from their cooler.  Total came to a little over $25.  Both dishes came beautifully presented, and arrived to my table quickly (less than 10 minutes after placing my order).  The quality of ingredients looked outstanding - everything seemed very fresh.  The dumplings had a nice, almost tea-like herbal flavor to them.  I'd certainly order them again. Now, the ramen - you get a good-sized chunk of very tender pork belly with not too much fat around it.  While the pork belly was solid, the rest of the dish failed to live up to the hype.  The broth to noodle ratio was a bit too high, and the spice used, while good at first, tasted a tad sweet - which I found a bit overbearing as I got halfway through the dish.  This was my fourth ramen experience in Chicago (having tried ramen at Kamaya, Strings, and Ramen San).  Personally, I would rank the ramen here above Strings, but below Ramen San and Kamaya).   While I was not blown away by the dish that brought me in, I would certainly like to come back here and try other items on the menu.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant, service is excellent, and the quality of ingredients is strong.",0.9954,0.785,0.185,0.03,0.5100865800865801

2014-12-20,3.0,"I came here with a friend today because I was craving some noodles and was in the west loop area. It was my first time here, and the first thing I noticed was how huge the place was. Most lunchtime patrons were seated in the back near the kitchen, but there were at least 20 empty dining tables that I passed on the way to the bathroom. I thought about how cool it would be to come here for dinner or after work for a drink.  What I really like about urban belly is their sizable but focused menu. I chose the pork belly ramen, and my friend chose the kimchee stew along with a bottle of kirin. We were ready to chow. Grabbing our number, we sat at these long brown wooden tables with block stools--i thought it was modern and cool. Then, 2 minutes passed and somehow our two bowls of noodles, steam rising from the server's hands, were being whisked to our table. I remembered that my friend had struck up a conversation with the guy who took our order, but altogether it took less than 10 minutes for the food to come. FREAKY FAST which is a great thing. I liked my ramen noodles and the dish hit the spot. However, the 2 pieces of pork belly were so fatty. I was dissecting it to find bits of protein amid globs of white, but my friend really enjoyed it, so much so that he wanted to replicate it at home. I thought he was crazy. The soup broth was also a tad too sweet for my taste--I think the dish would do well with some added heat. My friend's kimchi noodles came in a bowl that was considerably smaller than the ramen. I wondered why since it was the same price as the ramen and was accompanied with the same amount of meat. For better or worse the kimchi flavor wasn't powerful, but again, I was missing some spiciness. Overall it was a solid experience, but I figure that the flavor of some of the dishes could use some tinkering. After reading some reviews, I must have forgotten to ask for the belly fire sauce. doh.",0.9826,0.776,0.147,0.077,0.4038095238095238
2014-12-19,2.0,"I was prepared for the worse but in a pinch, it's pretty decent. I SAID in a pinch. I wouldn't go out of my way for it nor would I crave this rendition of ramen. I tried their urban belly ramen and the crispy noodle one that's vegetarian friendly. The two tasted basically the same with one not containing any meat. The crispy noodle one was a lot sweeter and with crispy noodles instead of regular noodles. They both tasted pretty sweet and five spice like which anyone of asian descent can make. Also they need to lay off on the sugar cuz one more wrong move and this would have been inedible. It's all the same shit just douse it with a ton more sugar. It didn't have typical tasty things like bamboo shoots in it. So at least it's edible and didn't make me too upset. I just needed soup and I don't do soup from a can nor soup from some deli with the exception of whole foods or plum market.. and I wanted some asian flavors.  You're not missing out if you haven't tried the ramen here. I tried their duck pho dumplings and they were okay. It didn't blow my mind nor was it notable but I can see how it'd blow the minds of non Asians that have more basic palates and didn't grow up with these flavors. For them being 9 bucks for 5 small ones that tasted just average felt like a rip off. Again you're not missing out if you have never had these. I also don't like dumplings fried whole. I just feel like when you have to ruin it by frying it whole you're just hiding your shitty dough making skills. Fried potsticker style is ok. Their kimchi is very weak. There's no punch; I wish it were spicier and more pungent like a good, typical kimchi but it's like American grocery store type. That was the most disappointing, I wish I didn't waste money on that. Blech. Skip it! Their Vietnamese coffee will keep you up until the next day like any decent Vietnamese coffee should. For the quick tip on the app that said he feels sad for those who have never eaten anything this good referring to the duck dumplings.. I feel sad that he thinks this is that good. People must have eaten really shitty ass foul food growing up. The most laughable part is they sell a few ginger chews and I mean A FEW for over 2 dollars for not even a whole bag when you can get the exact same chews at any asian store for a dollar- and you get a whole bag of it. Bitch please... Thinking you're getting something real special huh non-Asians. I pity you.

Korean duk noodle.slices cold & brittle dry on edges...with a watery broth that wasn't spicy with some light veggies and protein added. Again...nearly inedible.   Total bill for 4 was approx $60 for lunch.   We are right in the neighborhood so are sad it wasn't better.  Meet for drinks...

We ordered the mushroom pho $12 and the phat rice $14. The pho was lukewarm upon pick up and the flavor was just bland and the noodles were way over cooked very mushy, unpleasant texture.. The basil was just over powering and I had to add a lot of siracha to even make it worth eating. The phat rice was definitely the better of the two. The only reason for 2 stars. Was it good?

The edamame was ok, decent flavor but a little oily at the bottom. The donuts are too sweet and they don't have the crisp that would have been nice to have in a donut this size, instead it was on the soggy side which is not my preference.

2014-10-26,5.0,"This is not really a review, but rather a thank you to the good folks of Urbanbelly.  Bringing the family into Chicago for my wife's birthday celebration, I had a faint hope of making a stop here and trying out Bill Kim's food for the first time.  But with two little girls, doing dinner at a modern, community-seating urban restaurant is a rather intimidating ordeal. So I made the call to ask them if it was a bad idea, and they told us to bring the little ones.  Upon arriving at about 6PM, the place was nearly full, but the lovely Korean girl taking our order took it upon herself to find seating for all 4 of us, including a high chair.  Thank you!!  That took a great deal of the stress off, as waiting around with two little ones late in the evening doesn't work out, nor does splitting the family up. I was a little concerned for the group we were seated right next to, but they were extremely friendly and made the kids feel very welcome.  Great proprietors, great clients.  Better yet, the food came immediately, and let me tell you--after the first bite of the ramen, the pho, and the pea & mint dumplings, all our concern, weariness, and hunger faded away.  Even our little girls seemed as happy as they've ever been after a long day in a busy restaurant close to their bedtime. The food was everything I had hoped for.  Recently I spent time in Korea and Japan, eating some of the best noodles in the world, including the options at the newly minted Tokyo Ramen Street.  Finally, I've found a place here in the midwest that I can say holds its own, and is a perfect meld of my selective palette.  The ramen noodles I would say are 90% of what you can get at the top joints in Japan, but let me tell you--those two slices of meat are mind-blowing.  Kim could teach the greatest Japanese ramen chefs a thing or two about that.  Keep in mind you can also add extra noodles for $3.  Additionally, having a wife who's completely vegetarian, I am so grateful for the vegetarian options--and more than just the usual one option.  It means we're going to come back here every chance we get to come to Chicago. The only place in North America I would dare compare this place to, is David Chang's Momofuku, which is also great. After my experience tonight, however, I give the edge to Bill Kim.  Again, to the proprietors and employees of Urbanbelly, thank you so much for giving us the best meal tonight that we've had since moving several years ago to the midwest, and for being so accommodating to our palettes and our children.  Beyond solving the social problems of Chicago, I really can't think of a greater service you could provide.  I hope delivering such a meal is as rewarding for you as it is for us to consume it. We wish you the best. - The P.K. family of SW Michigan.",0.9988,0.749,0.209,0.042,0.49585395736339133

My wife is a vegetarian, so she ordered the mushroom pho, which was also served hot and was good. The next time, I'll have to order the more ubiquitous pork belly / poached egg bowl.

2014-10-07,3.0,"I found this overall dining experience somewhat odd. If you're looking to have a relaxing dinner with a drink and some friends this isn't the place. If I lived in the area and could pop in for take out, I would probably do so, but making a special trip was not worth it.  I'm vegetarian so I ordered the mushroom pho and mint/pea dumplings to share. The dumplings were just ok, but I appreciated the vegetarian option. The pho broth was really flavorful and delicious. I would definitely order that again.  The meat eaters at my table also really enjoyed their meal.  The three star rating comes from the overall dining experience. If you want a drink other than a slim selection of beer and wine, you can walk over to the bar at belly q. The house cocktails are $11, which is fine but not ideal. I was mostly annoyed that a titos and soda was costing me $10. That is definitely above average price for restaurants on Randolph.  After ordering drinks from a bartender who seemed put out to serve us, we went back into urban belly where you order your meal at a counter. The staff on either side just had a weird attitude like they weren't happy to be there. Not bad enough to ruin the meal, but just not a great aspect of my experience.

I added some spicy sauce because that's how I like my food, but it was very good and definitely something I'll be ordering again Bacon and kimchi--also very good, my husband really liked it. Had enough to bring home leftovers for another lunch Liked their patio area, which is dog-friendly. Staff was nice, brought out water for our dog. You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring your food to the table. Not sure about the indoor tables but the outside ones had one of my favorite things: hooks for your purse! They kind of share the space with Belly Q, which means you walk through the entire place to get to the bathroom.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the pricing.

It's not absolutely to-die-for amazing and it's certainly not something I would come back just to order but it tasted pretty good. They are fried more like pot-stickers instead of dumplings.  I got the Urbanbelly Ramen which was mediocre at best. The menu says it comes with mushrooms but there were none in my bowl. The pork belly was average and the broth was decent but lacked the fattiness needed for ramen soup. Of one thing to note is that this is one of the few ramen places out here that adds a soft-boiled egg in their soup. Toppings wise - the bowel was definitely lacking in decorations.  My friend got the rice cakes which again, we both thought was fair for Korean-American fusion. Medium spice but he definitely worked up a sweat.

With the size of our group, we were able to order a good portion of the menu. My favorite was the Phat rice, easily the best fried rice I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The key with Bill Kim's restaurants is that he combines flavors and flavors and makes them work and explode. I was born in Hong Kong so to say that this is the best fried rice is no small deal. He puts amazing twists on the Pad Thai and Pho, giving them robust flavors and textures that made everyone want more. I hesitate to give them 5 stars because the prices could be lower or the portions could be bigger. Also, the pork belly in my Phat rice was a little dry, but the wagyu beef was tender and full of flavor.

The broth was also slightly sweet (kind of weird). Basically, the ramen was rated G and I was hoping for NC17 (or at least rated R). Service- Had a bad experience.

I don't know what it is, but it even seems like the food has gone up a real notch too. Either way, UrbanBelly is an absolute MUST for anyone traipsing around Randolph.  What led to me coming here was a friend was in town. A small group of us were looking for a place to BYO and I did know that Urbanbelly has $0 corkage on Sundays (c'mon guys, make it more days than just that) and we wanted to take advantage of that.   Instead of actually packing ourselves, we basically ordered everything at the same time. In short time, we had a ton of food in front of us in the form of the eggplant, rice cake, lemongrass chicken, and wagyu beef dumplings.  The eggplant was first on the docket. These were done perfectly. It sometimes can be a real bitch cooking eggplant and that was far from the case here. Add on top of it the complex spicing to it, and we had a real winner. Right after that the wagyu dumplings were what we dove into. The first thought and words that came out of my mouth when eating the first dumpling was: whoa. The sauce had some spice to it and it contrasted beautifully with the quasi savoriness of the dumpling and meat. This was one of those dishes that stopped me and put me in my happy place.  It was then time for the more substantial dishes. The lemongrass chicken was really complex and was awesomely not really what we expected. I normally would've expected this more like a thai dish, but naw, that wasn't gonna happen here. The chicken was mixed in with the rice and eggs. This was you were able to get a bite of everything every time. As good as the lemongrass chicken was, the rice cake was the absolute star. The broth was absolutely awesome as it had a sweetness and heat to it at the same time. Add in the chicken and small rice cakes, and you have a bowl of absolute awesome.  The service was absolutely fantastic. We were out on the patio and it started to rain. They were all really helpful getting our bottles and food in before. They were really friendly the whole time and help make the overall experience a very positive one.  I walked away impressed and dead sure that I will re-visit as much as I can.

The only things that saved this meal was the pork, the egg, and the iced tea. The pork was really good and I always love soft boiled eggs. Their iced tea was also nice and refreshing. The portions of the food seemed good, but that didn't help the taste much. It was a little pricy for ramen, but the size helped and it was nice that the egg was included. The layout of the whole restaurant is very..interesting. It's connected to Belly Q, which I guess is the fancier version of Urbanbelly? There's a fake wall that separates the two restaurants. At Urbanbelly you have to order at a counter first and then you can sit behind the counter to eat. Since you order your food first, there's not so much involved in the service aspect, but the workers at the counter were friendly and nice. Overall, I don't think I'll be back.",0.9795,0.785,0.157,0.058,0.55679012345679

I ordered the ramen, wagyu beef dumplings and duck dumplings. Cousin had the pork and pineapple rice.  We were brought out our drinks promptly. I had the iced tea (black tea with lychee) which was nice and refreshing. My cousin did not enjoy his Vietnamese coffee as it had a cinnamon flavor to it. Next came our appetizers. Both dumplings (5 pieces each) weren't bad, but not very memorable to me, as the meats didn't come through to me much. My ramen again wasn't bad, and was not expecting anything authentic, but was not as flavorful as it could be. Was nice to see a few big pieces of pork belly though. My cousin enjoyed his rice dish and the pork belly pieces were plentiful. The service was great as the gentleman who took our order consistently checked up on us and was very friendly. Wouldn't mind coming back, but not in a hurry to do so. Will likely check out BellyQ next door first.",0.9922,0.793,0.188,0.019,0.5306666666666666

I've eaten so much mediocre Chinese food in my lifetime. Needless to say, this is miles above General Tso and his chicken army. Funky and unexpected flavor combinations abound. Kinda like an Asian Chipotle Grill. I ordered the pork and pineapple fried rice which was very good, but my standout favorite was the Rice Cake Noodles -- out of this world! We also ordered two different dumplings which were not quite as memorable as the noodles and fried rice.Did I mention they have a small but eclectic beer selection?

What I ordered: Duck and Pho Dumplings Unagi on Jasmine rice (I believe it was the special) The Duck and Pho Dumplings - These were out of this world awesome, I was only disappointed that there weren't more for me to eat. So rich with the perfect amount of spice. They were fried perfectly and the spice and flavor from the pho really made the duck flavor in the dumpling open up in your mouth with a sort of rich creamy fatty flavor. Unagi on Jasmine Rice - I love unagi and this place did not disappoint me, the unagi was perfectly prepared and the sauce was awesome, my only gripe with this dish is that there were only about 5 pieces of unagi and ALOT of rice, seaweed paper, avocado and other things. I found myself finishing all my unagi with a lot of leftover jasmine rice. I guess i  was expecting a big ol mixed bowl of stuff.

We started off with some wagyu beef dumplings--  Cheese it, it's a pierogi.  Fry it, it's an empanada.  Top it with some ""kewpie""-like asian mayo-sauce, it's somewhere inbetween this trifecta of dumpling identities. Decent, but not worth a repeat. I got their ""Urbanbelly Ramen""-- no matter if it's authentic or reimagined, a good bowl of ramen: good balance of broth, well-cooked noodles, and toppings. The broth was too salty, lacked depth. The noodles were okay, and the meat was well-prepared.  The boy ordered their ""Kimchi Stew""-- a spiced broth filled with ""dukbokki""-esque pieces. Good choice for branching out from the traditional offerings.   Came to Urbanbelly with an open mind and hungry bellies. But Urbanbelly just didn't rub me the right way.

2014-06-13,2.0,"I really, really wanted to like this place. A friend brought us here for dinner club saying it was one of her favorite restaurants in the city and the menu was unique and exciting, so I had high expectations. There was a group of us and we went up to the counter to order and then sit at our reserved table to wait for the goodies. My pork and cilantro dumplings came out first and they were good, though not as delicious as I hoped- they lacked seasoning, I thought. My friend's duck dumplings were similarly under-seasoned. But I was hungry and finished my plate. And another dish was coming.  I had ordered the pad thai for my entree and was well aware that it was a different kind of pad thai with rice cakes instead of noodles. What I didn't expect was the mint leaves, which overpowered the dish. For whatever reason, whenever there are mint leaves in a dish, that's all I taste- that bitterness overwhelms my mouth and it doesn't sit well in my stomach. I ate the shrimp and some of the rice cakes, but didn't finish the dish. The server asked if something was wrong and I said it was the mint, an ingredient that I wasn't expecting in pad thai and I would not have ordered that dish if I had known it was in there. Fortunately, I had donuts coming to hopefully save the day. Alas, they had orange peel on them, another ingredient that overpowers and I actually cannot eat  because I'm slightly allergic and it makes me nauseated. The description for these donuts was ""maple-glazed"" with ""Vietnamese cinnamon-"" no mention of orange essence. I couldn't eat them. To the restaurant's credit, the server did ask if we had any food allergies before we ordered, but would I expect orange peel to be anywhere in a dish? I appreciate a modern and simplified menu, but ingredients should be listed in the dish description, especially such overpowering flavors as mint and orange using ingredients that potentially don't sit well with customers. Yes, I'm an exception when it comes to certain ingredients, but I guess so is the 2 star review. As for the ambiance and service. Service was fine, but it was super loud in the restaurant. I know it's counter service and kind of upscale fast food, but my meal cost me nearly $40 with tip and I expect to at least be able to have a conversation with my friends while I was (not) eating my food.",0.9794,0.847,0.108,0.045,0.6284365079365078
2014-06-12,4.0,"My friend and I became victims of a nasty hit-and-run two hours after our meal here, and we, after accepting that the car was totaled and while massaging our necks from the whiplash, still found ourselves raving about the hauntingly spiced, pho-inspired broth of the Urbanbelly Ramen. Never mind those firm, delicious noodles, the impeccable soft-cooked egg and the succulent-with-the-right-amount-of-chew pork belly; these were mere accoutrements to the savory sorcery of the broth. The only suggestion for improvement that I can lend to this bowl of goodness is for the kitchen to throw in some torn leaves of Thai basil, which would add a bright, sweetly herbal element.  We also devoured the Phat Rice, a kind of fried rice on crack, with a scattering of pineapple and generous, hearty toppings of crispy pork belly nuggets, Wagyu kalbi, and a ground chicken mixture reminiscent of Laotian larb.  And then there was the kimchi, that spicy, pungent, umami-riddled delicacy that I ate almost every day as a child. Urbanbelly's perfectly fermented rendition, although toned down in spice and given a healthy dose of sesame oil, reminded me of my late Korean grandmother's and got me a little choked up ... and almost made me forget that we paid three dollars for a tiny bowl of it. I'm no cheapo and I know Mr. Kim needs to make his money, but come on. It's like charging two bucks for that pickle wedge you get with a sandwich.  And especially after the guy at the counter raved about them, the pea, mint and goat's-milk feta dumplings underwhelmed. The scant amount of underseasoned filling in the thick and chewy mandoo wrapper, with way-too-crunchy edamame strewn on top, made for a disproportionate, disjointed dish that is also the most incongruous item on the menu. I would want to see it reworked or discontinued.  That and the price of the kimchi aside, we really enjoyed our late lunch and look forward to returning and trying something new. Being from Honolulu, where Asian fusion abounds to the point that you almost can't escape it, I was very pleased with Chef Kim's mostly successful efforts and SO GLAD to get something not easily found outside the city.

We didn't have to wait to try the awesomeness and it felt like we had the place to ourselves.   My cousin and I agreed to share a ramen, appetizer and another dish. We decided to go with the duck and spices dumplings for our appetizer, the urbanbelly ramen and the highly recommended phat rice.

I personally love duck so I was going to love this regardless. On to the the ramen. Wow!  The urban belly ramen was crazy good. It had just the right amount of spice and salt with a hint of sweetness. I couldn't get enough. The pork belly was tender and flavorful and complimented the ramen so well. On a side note, the egg was perfectly cooked.  Impressive!  Last but not least we tried the phat rice!  OMG!  So dope!  It had three types of meat (pork belly, braised short ribs and chicken).

2014-04-25,5.0,"*********** I dedicate review # 500 to a very deserving business, Urbanbelly! ************* I like when I'm wrong about things. I mean, it happens to all of us, so why not just embrace it and admit it to the world when it happens? I tried Urbanbelly at their old location and I was left uninspired and disappointed. My friend and I were going to a show at the City Winery down the street and were wandering down Randolph looking for something to catch our eye. When we finally found BellyQ, we decided to stop in since I've had it bookmarked for awhile. We ended up walking into the wrong door and finding that we were ACTUALLY at Urbanbelly. I kinda groaned, since I've tried it before, but the girl working the counter was so enthusiastic. She made me want to give it another go. To start, she was absolutely amazing. I know that an entire Talk forum was dedicated to how overused the word is, but there's no one more deserving of the word 'amazing' than her. We were definitely out of our element by looking at the menu--unsure of what certain things meant--but she was reassuring, cool and confident and didn't bat an eye. I decided on the special of the day because she painted it in such a positive light: the waygu burger with fries for $10. My friend ordered 3 of the waygu beef dumplings.  The burger was perfection on a bun. This was my first time trying kimchi, but I was an instant fan. Normally, I'm only a fan of traditional cheese/ketchup/mustard/onion/lettuce burgers, but this one made me change my mind. The steamed bun was a little soggy, but it was still one of my favorite parts. It was so light and airy against the waygu beef. All of the flavors on the burger mixed well together, which was one of my original complaints about UB my first visit. I'm normally not a fry person, but these fries were insane. They had a Japanese chili seasoning to make them have a little kick but nothing unbearable--even for me. (This spice is sold at the front counter for $4. Of course I bought a bottle to bring home.) The beef dumplings were fantastic as well and reminded me a lot of ""rangoons""  more than the soft, pillowy dumplings that I'm used to. They were very crunchy and delectable. I could have eaten all of them with only a little guilt. It was pretty empty in here when we came, but they still have the communal tables like they did at the other location. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of them, but I guess I'll learn to deal with it since I'm going to be coming back here oh-so-soon.",0.9972,0.758,0.184,0.058,0.6151030614265908

Just this week we had our first somewhat good experience, which is no surprise since the staff updated us that they made improvements to a couple dishes. Portion sizes are better and the pork pineapple rice was closer to what it once was. And don't get me started on BYOB just Sundays schpeal, give us a break!

Like really fast.  Like my noodles were out in 2 minutes fast.  It was like being in a noodles and company.  But worse because I spent $60.  The staff could tell that I was disappointed and they sent out a side of eggplant on the house.  Classy move, but it really couldn't make up for how terrible everything was.   If you loved the Logan Square location stay away.  It's just going to make you sad.

Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  It's a ""split"" restaurant - with part of it being the swankier, more expensive Belly Q, and Urbanbelly being the more casual, less-costly joint. So I didn't feel totally out of place in my sweats.  Things took a dive though when it was time for the food... What was good: Phat Rice. They didn't skimp on the meat - which I love. Threw some hot sauce on it and I enjoyed it. What to Skip: The Urbanbelly Ramen was disappointing - my friend and I both agreed it was too sweet. Also the egg that was included tasted like a hardboiled egg they had just thrown in - and the yolk was missing. The Pork belly was just ok. Don't come here for the Ramen.

2014-02-21,4.0,"Big fan of the new digs for Urbanbelly.  They have a few inspired Ramen creations on special, and they were surprisingly tasty.  One week they had a salami ramen, and the next week it was a lamb ramen.  Their regular ramen is quite tasty with big and tender pieces of pork belly.  The shrimp udon was great with excellent noodles.  The beef dumplings are a good starter (could've been a little crispier, though), and I'm excited to try the buffalo chicken dumplings eventually. It looked like the rice dishes were a little small, so I think I'll stick to the hearty bowls of soup.     Communal tables are hit or miss. The tables themselves are beautiful, but sometimes you get stuck next to awkward first dates or people wondering loudly why their FB friend list is dropping. I can think of a few reasons.  That's not really the fault of Urbanbelly, just my crumudgeoness.  I like that there are bowls and ladles on the table if you're going to share soup. I kinda miss the Avondale spot, but I'm good with this one.  Especially the random wall of green, it's nice to look at.  Also, the benches are pretty heavy.

My favorite part was the balsamic soy that is set at each beautiful communal table. I could literally bathe in that stuff. I love that they have it for sale at the front counter! The rice and soup both were exploding with flavors that I've never experienced before. I was seriously blown away. The soup was spicy, but perfectly balanced w a bit of sweet from the mango. And those rice cakes? Yea, what the hell are those- they're amazing. More of a noodle texture than anything else.  The dumplings were good- but not anything I haven't experienced before. Had i not stuffed myself into oblivion on rice and soup, I probably would've given the little guys more attention.  Being a restaurant designer myself, I was blown away by the stripped down, raw design of the space.

I've been dying to try this place after reading the stellar reviews about the ramen and was super-excited when it moved to my neighborhood. But I forgot about the new ramen fad in the city which prompted many new ""ramen"" restaurants, none of which resembles the traditional Japanese ramen I associate with the name. This is nowhere close to the Japanese variety...more of Chef Kim's own interpretation. While the broth was flavorful, it did not have the richness I was expecting from ramen broth. The two pieces of grilled pork belly were down right boring. And there wasn't much more in that bowl other than noodles. Guess I was misled by the term ""ramen"" so it was a huge letdown for me. The dumplings were just ok too...I personally found them a bit greasy. The filling was flavorful enough which made the sauce completely unnecessary.

We also shared two of the dumplings, wagyu and squash.  Both great add-ons.

He said it was on its way. About 5mins later ONE of our two orders came out. I was no longer patient and let the manager know how disappointed we were to have to wait +30mins for a restaurant where you order at the counter. The food was very tasty, thus the three star rating, but I have to say, Chicago has far too many tasty restaurants for me to return to a place that takes painfully long to get your food. If anyone had actually been monitoring how long the order was taking, a simple 'we're sorry it's taking so long' without us asking and/or an order of say edamame to hold us over would have been the appropriate gesture.

I love the idea of taking the sweet, spicy, and herbal flavors of Asia and reinventing them with Western ingredients.

That was my thought when I tried Urban Belly, which I thought was kind of a dud. The menu looks great, full of interesting ethnic combinations and gastronomic juxtapositions, but nothing here really turned me on. The Lamb & Brandy Dumplings were just OK. A bit too sweet from the glaze and whatever condiment was on top. The Kimchi Stew -- noodles, pork belly, kimchi broth -- was just a mess. None of the component parts really came together in a harmonious way. Moreover, I was not fond of the flavor of the noodles, which tasted processed to me, and the broth was too far a departure from the kimchi jjigae that I know and love. The best dish was undoubtedly the Phat Rice -- fried rice with chicken, pork belly, and galbi short ribs. The short ribs were good, but that's about it. If you are a foodie from out of town, then Urban Belly is probably on your radar. But don't bother.

Counter service restaurants usually take a long time to fill orders, which kind of defeats their purpose. Urban belly doesn't have that flaw. The food was flavorful and interesting. We got two different kinds of dumplings. A sweeter set, made with squash and a passion fruit vinaigrette, was soft and tasty. A savory set, made with fried chicken and blue cheese, was crunchy and had a nice spicy zing. I ordered the Urbanbelly Ramen, served In a large bowl, soft boiled egg floating in brown broth. The noodles were ramen - it's ramen, not much more to be said. The egg was good, but it did feel like a weird food to be eating in broth. Even skilled wielders of chopsticks might have problems plucking it out of the bowl. The highlight of the dish was the Braised Pork Belly lurking just beneath the surface. It was tender and tasted pretty great marinated in the broth. Wrap-Up! Pros: - affordable food from a great Chicago chef. - counter service is super fast. - dumplings were fun. Don't skip them!
