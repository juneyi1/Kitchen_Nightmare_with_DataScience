It was not crowded, bartenders were pleasant and helpful with our drink orders. I had a margarita and it was not bad at all, a bit pricey thou. I like the fact that they have a DJ playing, also in case it rains you can sit inside. The view is great both night and day time.",0.9703,0.746,0.254,0.0,0.8433333333333334

It rained briefly and there was ample space inside. Various times when I'm downtown and wanting a snack or drink before 5 and not wanting to go to a crowded beer and shot place. They only have 3 taps but have ample cocktail making ingredients. I like the uniforms the waitresses were donning black dresses and denim jackets.

2017-07-29,1.0,This review is for the FOOD FYI. I was so hungry out with a friend for happy hour drinks which turned into a few different places. Around 8/8:30 we were at Cesire rooftop and starving. Their 'bites' menu is fairly limited; fair enough this is a bar.  I was trying to decide between chips and guacamole $10 or coconut shrimp toast $12. Server said shrimp toast is good and there are six. Perfect done.  It was NOT good. The toast was burnt to a crisp it was barely toast anymore. I didn't get a photo unfortunately but it was like two burned pieces of toast with a miniature amount of what I have to assume was coconut shrimp in between cut into six pieces; it was an incredibly disappointing amount and flavor for $15 ($12 plus tip and tax). I was expecting a small portion but at least something tasty???!  Now the views here absolutely amazing. The drinks and late night scene I can't speak to,0.9121,0.794,0.145,0.061,0.5858543417366947

2017-07-01,2.0,"Located atop the Virgin Hotel, Cerise is the aesthetically pleasing rooftop bar. The views and decor are fantastic. Aside from that, my experience at Cerise was less than stellar. Having worked in Customer service, I let a lot slide because I get it.  Cerise seems to be the place people go to after work. And with it not being a large space it can be hard to find a seat. If you're going with a group, it would be best that someone get there early to grab seats if possible. The staff didn't seem to be happy during my visit except for the security guard. They've employed beautiful people, but looks don't make up for personality and kindness. It could have been an off day, but not for everyone working.  We found seats outside, and the server on the patio completely ignored us until the end. I just went to the bar and got drinks. Not a problem at all, the bartender seemed annoyed but kept it professional. Again, I've worked in customer service, so there are certain cues I've learned to be able to deal with situations. An hour later and after everyone started leaving the patio server finally comes over to our table. She had been on our side serving people many times never stop our table. I had a tab going, and I told her because I was going to order another drink. She goes in and comes back and says there's no tab for me then disappears again.  At that point, My friend and I are over it. I go in and check with the bartender I first saw, and yes the tab was there. She closed it, and we left. Not sure If I would go back although, I've been invited there next week.",0.9192,0.841,0.103,0.055,0.42905982905982903

2017-06-21,4.0,"Ehhhh, 3.5 if I could.  It's a pretty standard Loop rooftop, though the views are pretty awesome.  Drink prices weren't awful, considering the location, and the chips and guac we ordered were good.  Despite the chill we did sit in the outside part of the rooftop, and they had decent seating options. The issue comes more with the service-we started out with one server, who was okay but not great or really all that friendly.  After a while she came over and asked if we wanted to close our tab-we said no, because we weren't ready.  She then came back to explain she was leaving and someone else would be taking over, then came back a few minutes later with the new server, who was super friendly and attentive. When it came time to pay the bill, the (new) server brought out the receipt and it looked like the card had been charged, but the card wasn't in the folio.  When my friend asked our server she said she'd been told by the (previous) server when she left it was given back-nope.  Turns out the (new) server had to call the (previous) server three times to try and figure out where the card was-turns out it was sitting on top of their computer.  Everything turned out okay, but it was a big hassle that seemed to take way longer than it should have, and when you're dealing with people's credit cards being MIA that's a little disconcerting.  It was a decent experience except for that sour note at the end, though I did give credit since it turned out okay.",0.9822,0.786,0.157,0.058,0.4410873440285204

I am usually a wine girl but they had two drinks on the menu and I was blown away! I was also really intersted to know that they were both on tap! The Devil in the Hot Seat, was a bourbon based drink which is not my thing, but it was AMAZING! Had a ton of flavor (none of it bourbon) and they set it on fire before they hand it off to you!

Bad notes: The music was very hit or miss. They only had heaters on one side of the rooftop deck. I can't blame them that a loop hotel location draws in the suburban / tourist / older crowd.

Something was off this weekend - the music/DJ were like cheesy Y bar downtown types and it was EMPTY. This would have been ok - it's that weird between holiday time, I get it - but the manager was hustling our waitress to push bottle service on us. Lady, we came here to get AWAY from that. And I thought Virgin was staying true to their brand with the earlier music and vibe. This was just cheesy. Long story short, I'll give it another shot.

My buddy ended up suggesting this rooftop bar as our rendezvous point to meet up with a college buddy we hadn't seen in years. What an excellent spot! For a Thursday night, not too crowded and easy service from the bar. Did I mention the views from the deck are top notch? You can easily see from south the Willis / Sears Tower all the way to the Trump building.  Cerise is situated on the 26th floor of the Virgin Hotel. Once you're up there, awesome ambiance & music accompanied with a swanky interior. Plenty of high top tables inside and lots of cabana like couches outside on the deck if you're looking to cozy up. Upon making our way to the bar, the bartender instantly greeted us with a smile and was ready and willing to serve. There's a number of signature cocktails, beer shandies, & wines they offer. However, no beers on draft & only a limited selection of bottled / canned options. For the most part, I think ambiance and staff friendliness went a long way to making this experience an enjoyable one.   If you're looking for a trendy bar / lounge to hit, definitely would recommend and for sure worth a stop for the Chicago skyline views.

The view of the surrounding buildings makes you feel upper middle class and you can pretend to hear the glasses clink for cheers even though they're made of plastic.  Honestly, the interior is where it's at. The staff is pleasant and the layout is chic. They could do a little better with their electronic soundtrack though - less top 40 and more subtlety would make it feel like they're not trying to be a club. If you're set on going on the balcony, they do provide heaters and blankets, but they lack nice seating. This makes the place feel like more of a display than a real lounge I'd give this place a 4 star if they updated their soundtrack and got some real glasses. 5 if their balcony made the best of their view (which truly is a 4-star view.)",0.9703,0.788,0.171,0.041,0.45555555555555555

2016-06-22,2.0,"Came here after the City Winery event on the Riverwalk on Friday. It was part of the City Winery event and was closed to the public. The rooftop space is small and kinda narrow compared to other rooftop bars, which can be a hassle if trying to walk around, pass people. This kinda let you know how rooftop bar/lounges are the future and every hotel want a piece of the pie, even if they do not fully have the space - they will make space! The view is nice tho, especially at night. They also had a DJ who I must admit played nice old school 90's jams, which is always appreciated, and make you feel like you're truly partying with the grown and sexy. Cerise from the feel and look appear that on your average weekend probably cater to the younger - early to late 20's crowd. Someone also made mention they charge on weekends after like 10pm. Not sure if this is true, but if it is this make me question if you want to be categorized as a party or a rooftop lounge bar. I received complimentary wine as part of the City Winery event and it was basic white wine, nothing special to say about it. I also ordered their signature red Sangria, which was really good. I do like the fact they have the heating lamps in case of it being a cool night. Their menu is very limited and the selections are few and not very appealing. When you think of bar food and a rooftop that stays open kinda late, you think of basic options, like party chicken wings, truffle fries, pop corn shrimp, quesadillas, mini sliders, etc. They did allow me to go down a couple floors to another bar and order the party wings and bring them back up, which was weird and a tad bit of an unnecessary hassle because the elevator would not let me back up to the roof-top and I had to go down on the main floor and have a security guard let me up. Talk about a ""controlled environment.""  I am sure you all share the same kitchen, why not just have them on the rooftop menu? The bartenders were hit or miss with some being friendly and some coming across irritated, which really makes me wonder why are you even in this business at all?!? No one is forcing you to work as a bartender, so if you don't like it, just quit and save the customers the unpleasant experience. All in all this rooftop probably will fall in the last choice to come to option when considering rooftops when there are so many others.",0.9929,0.805,0.153,0.042,0.4334560970430535

It was a little hard to sit like a lady with a skirt and heels. These seats give you privacy from behind but it faces another seat, so you'll be facing another couple. The high backs don't allow for the best views on the deck.  The signature drinks are creative. I had a Colada Frada. It was tasty without being too sweet. My husband had a Sailor Jerry and Diet Coke.  He really doesn't think it was Sailor but more like Bacardi Gold. The bar tender did poor him a new one in front of him but it still didn't quite taste right.  I was sad that the outdoor patio closed at 11pm and we had to come inside. Bummer!

I was nervous that I was in a city I was unfamiliar with, and that I was going to be a loner the entire night, lol. But not at all, thanks to this place!  - Amazing drinks. Their homemade honey whiskey is phenomenal, and it definitely gets the job done. I had about 4 of those (plus some other drinks) and I had a reallllly good night.  I also met the gentleman (I'm so upset I forgot his name- He was super handsome and kind) who came up with the recipe for the honey whiskey, and he was just fantastic. He even made me another recipe of his which was very herb-y, and tasted like sage. I didn't even know I liked sage until I had this drink.

2015-10-22,2.0,"Monday, October 19, 2015. It was raining so the outside area was closed. It smelled stale on the inside. The crowd was just there. Nothing interesting. I had some time to kill before meeting friends for dinner at Bijan and had one drink at the bar. The male bartender finally comes over (it wasn't that busy) forces not even half of a smile and doesn't speak one word. I'm like, hello, he says hi and looked uncomfortable and irritated. I order my drink. While I'm standing at the bar, I notice a few different people come up and wait for a bartender, they didn't come, and the people moved around to get service. Mind you, not busy and not a large bar area whatsoever. There were 2 bartenders back there. I go to the communal restroom before I leave. I am drying my hands in the dryer and a guy walks in and almost went in the women's bathroom. The women's is labeled Birds and the men's is Blokes. A little silly if you ask me. He asks is this the right one and I said no, men's is right here which is where the hand dryers are situated. He asked why I was over there and I said obviously, drying my hands. He said, I don't like you over there. What an idiot. The moral of the story is, I am all for unique settings but a communal restroom area is a horrible idea where there are intoxicated people. It could be dangerous considering you have to go down a flight of stairs to get there that look like the back stairway of a high rise building, alcohol alters idiots minds more quickly than respectable people's going for a cocktail or two and, I'm sure there is no shortage of inappropriate and ignorant comments in the communal area where the sinks and hand dryers are located.

We were finished our drinks for at least 20 minutes and still were not asked if we want another one. We tried to flag down her a few times without luck.

You couldn't really hear any music while you're on the patio which is nice because you can have a decent conversation. There is a variety of seating. I was not a fan of the stone table with the stone lamps. But at least they have complimentary flavored water stations.

2015-08-20,2.0,"Came here for drinks with some coworkers and was really unimpressed.  It's new, so I guess I wasn't surprised how crowded it was, but the set up is very strange, not really geared towards the 5pm crowd.  There are loveseats set up everywhere, which would lend itself to a cozy date, but not so much large groups trying to soak in some rooftop rays. The bar is very scene-y, and relies on the ""coolness"" factor rather than solid drinks and service.  It took about 15 minutes of waiting expectantly, plus a 5 minute walk around the bar searching for service before we actually got some.  The cocktails were fine, but didn't blow us away.  We had a carafe of the gin/prosecco cocktail and it was very light and refreshing.  It's not somewhere I would come for a proper cocktail though. I think if you're looking for something trendy, a cool date spot, this could be your place.  Otherwise, I'd skip it.  Chicago has so many great rooftops with amazing service, I've definitely experienced better.",0.9711,0.829,0.139,0.032,0.5351484230055659
2015-08-17,3.0,"Came to Cerise around 8:30 on a Friday night. My gf and I lucked out because we got there just before they started wait-listing people to go up to the top. Cerise has more of a club feel to it, especially the music and furniture. Bartenders weren't super friendly but the staff/security was better than what I expected going in. Unfortunately, and this is part of why I have to give 3 stars, a rainstorm was coming and they were shutting down the outside section/patio shortly after we got up top. This place definitely isn't worth it if the outside isn't open. I have a feeling they weren't telling people that on the ground floor either, given how many people I saw that were sent to the second floor bar while I was waiting on my gf in the bathroom. I don't mind paying a little extra for drinks at a bar like this, or having to wait in line to get up top, but this place just wasn't my scene. I liked Cindy's a lot better over at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, which is a little calmer and has a MUCH better view.",0.9466,0.791,0.142,0.067,0.44814814814814813
2015-08-17,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about the night, but when I look back, I take away a mostly positive experience. I RSVP'ed for the pitchfork after party & knew that space was still limited, even with the RSVP. I knew the event started at 10, but wanted to double check with virgin what time the DJ set started while I couldn't reach my friends during the day. The woman at the front desk kind of yelled at me over the phone--""it's not a DJ, it's a BAND!"" Ok...I know it's a band, but they will be DJing the party, they're not playing their own show hah.  When I arrived, I was stopped by 2 hotel staff telling me it was at capacity but I was able to go hang out with my friends in the little green room area. This is where we met a young woman...I wish I remembered her name, cute bubbly blonde, who was taking care of us the whole night. She was seriously amazing! So nice & so hospitable. I took a photo with her so maybe someone at cerise can identify her...and give her a raise haha. We ended up going into the set and it was MORE than at capacity. There was a point where traffic stopped in front of the DJ booth. I couldn't see the tops of their heads even, so I decided to go enjoy the music somewhere away from the clump of people and get myself a drink. The gal I mentioned earlier saw me sitting outside of the DJ area and asked if I wanted to be inside near my friends. I did & she got me in there! Seriously, so amazing. Around 12:40 the fire marshal shut the set down, and rightly so because probably 1/2 the amount of people in there should have been. I'm not sure how that could have been avoided--fewer rsvp slots available? Maybe making the capacity lower when there are high profile DJs & you can assume guests will all be huddled around them? It just seemed like the venue wasn't prepared to handle that size of a crowd. But as far as drinks go--I've read a review that they served weak drinks? My drinks were strong, just the way I like them! After we left the rooftop and headed back to the hospitality area, we were still being catered to. I had contacted cerise here on yelp actually before I came about bringing a gift and they were very friendly and accommodating and double checked with security, which was nice of them to do. The first and last impressions I had were kind of weird, but everything in between was awesome! The ""too long; didn't read"" version-- Pros: hospitality, drink quality, music, beautiful setting Cons: crowd control",0.9954,0.745,0.17,0.085,0.5130712973894792

2015-08-10,1.0,"I have now been to Cerise twice and I can definitively say that this place is SO NOT worth the money or the wait, You are better off going to basically any other rooftop/bar in Chicago. The first time I went we arrived right after work with a group (around 5pm) the service was fine but the drinks were weak as can be. We finally started ordering beers because at least we could count on those having alcohol in them.  The second time I went was last Saturday with friends. First I called the front desk around 7:30 and asked if she expected there would be a line. She said no because the weather had not been very good. She was totally wrong, we stood in line for close to an hour. By the way we were told right after we got in that we were the last ones and that now they were at capacity. So not really sure what we were waiting in line for for an hour if the bar was not full. We finally get up to the bar after being outfitted with cheap paper wristbands that we had to show to the guard to get into the elevator. We were a group of four and wanted to eat and drink. I was excited for the asian fusion type food, but was sorely disappointed.  The salmon sashimi was good (even though it was only a thick cut of salmon wrapped around a stick of cucumber (for three pieces at $13 i expected more). The Ahi Tuna was borderline inedible it was so covered with salt - I wouldnt have been suprised if it wasnt tuna at all. The japanese ""chicken wings"" were also way to salty.  For the drinks we ordered a pitcher of the Sakura Fizz which was extremely watered down and tasted like you were drinking straight tonic water. After that debacle I started ordered my own drinks thinking maybe pitchers were the wrong choice. I ordered a cosmo, which again had little to no liquor in it. Finally my friends and I went for Martinis because, we thought, at least that would be more bang for our buck. BY FAR the worst martini I have ever had. It again tasted like water and I actually was served a martini that was 25% crushed ice......Sorry but next time ill stay in and make myself a martini that doesn't cost $13. I have never even heard of ice in a martini. Overall this place is TOTALLY not worth it. Seriously go anywhere else. As a side note the decor is cheap and looks like you are in an Austin Powers movie (not in a good way) and all of the menus were stuck to the bar which was covered in spilled drinks. The people themselves were dressed up to the nines but just a strange crowd. I think the only reason I even gave this place one star was for the views, but problem is, once you hike out to the loop on a Saturday night - there is really no other bars around you.",-0.9857,0.825,0.062,0.113,0.5332569077013521

I took my cousin here to kick off her Bday celebration. I arrived our before our very small party of 3 I was making my way inside when one of the doormen yelled at me (wth?!). He said if I was going to Cerise I have to stand in line on the OTHER side of the building (Ok. thanks for yelling at me sir. Maybe my forehead said 'going to Cerise?') Anyways, stood in line for 30 min outside, to then go inside give your name to the chick with the iPad, she tells you to either hang out at the coffee bar, or go upstairs to wait at the other bar, and that it would only be 20-25min wait. We waited over an hour, we then get the text to go back downstairs, get our hand stamped, and then proceed to go another floor down, to an elevator to be taken upstairs. We arrived upstairs, and I literally had to hunt someone down for some service. This really would have been a non-issue had the place been 'at capacity' like the hostess downstairs stated, but I have been to places much busier and have gotten faster service. FINALLY, I get the attention of a server, I wanted to make my cousin's Bday really special, so we got bottle service. One of the bouncer's was nice enough to point out that there was an available table for us to sit at and enjoy our bottle of Champagne, the table was sticky, and dirty. It was eventually cleaned with a wet dish rag (on a glass table, you don't clean glass with a wet rag, but what do I know).  Half way through our evening our server came to us and introduced Shannon? (really nice red-head) and said she was going on break and that Shannon would take over for her. We ended up with Shannon the rest of the night, and she was great, very attentive she helped us out in getting a candle for my cousin's cupcakes (not really sure what happened to our original server). At the end of the night our original server re-appears to see if we needed anything (not really sure where she ran off to). At this point I just wanted to close out my tab, so she ran my card a total of 8 times (per my fraud prevention Rep) 8 times?! this of course set off all sorts of fraud alerts, locking my funds (was the server drinking on the job?) not really sure what the heck happened, but the whole experience was horrible, I spent almost $400 in this place to be treated like I was going to skip out on my tab.  They tried to make us feel better by giving us a round of ""free"" shots, that they ended up spilling all over my friend's feet.
