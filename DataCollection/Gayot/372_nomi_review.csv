Wonderful unhurried service from Matt. Beautifully presented nigiri in its freshest form. My one small complaint would be that the nori would be better crisp- to balance the velvety uni. And the waiter should return to pour the guest's tea ( as is a polite custom in Japan.  The NoMi Benedict started out as a miss: the Suby style poached eggs just didn't feel right. The texture was runny and the yolks did not come up to temperature. But as soon as I pointed out my disappointment to my waiter, Matt, all was rectified immediately. The eggs were post to perfection.  I found this experience relaxing, enjoyable, and very satiating. I will most definitely return.",0.9642,0.778,0.168,0.055,0.5578754578754579

Wife and I ordered a sushi roll, salmon beignets, and the lamb.  Our bill for two came out to $131 before tip. I tipped $25 making the total $156 (according to math). My credit card statement showed the total to be $256. Upon calling the park hyatt billing department, I was informed that my tip was made to be $125. I assured them I did not tip nearly 100 percent of the bill. They resolved the issue and credited me the $100 without questions. That shady move is the reason for the 3 stars.",0.9246,0.873,0.127,0.0,0.6875

We came for a late brunch/lunch for my husband and he got their burger and I decided to try the salmon beignets (for a snack). The burger and chips were delicious (so said my husband, I tried a chip and liked the unique seasoning on it) and I really enjoyed the salmon beignets. The beignets were a clever play on a lox bagel. I definitely recommend them. If I had one regret about this place it was not trying any of their sushi. I saw several other tables ordering sushi and wished I had ordered some too. Just kidding... second regret is ordering a diet pepsi instead of a glass of wine. My soda was $6 or $7 but lesson learned. Never turn down a drink in Chicago!

After the wedding we had two hours to kill before the reception and, dressed to the nines, a group of us walked down North Michigan Ave and headed over to NoMI Kitchen to pre-game with some drinks. It is located on the 7th floor of the Park Hyatt hotel and swanky does not even begin to describe it. There are no words. You would have to see the overwhelming room of floor-to-ceiling wine bottles and chandeliers for yourself. We were seated at a Game of Thrones-esque  mahogany wooden table in said wine room and we felt like damn royalty.  I had the old-fashioned which was ridiculously-priced but oh so worth it. It was easily the best I've ever had. We also got an order of salt and vinegar popcorn to share over drinks and it was delicious! The group decided that the bartender was kind of a grump, but he was nice to me (haha) so I have no complaints!

The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and has great views given that it is only on the 7th floor of the hotel! I liked the fact that we could see into the kitchen also, and see them preparing the sushi.  I ordered the chicken ballotine, and my date got the beef loin. It did take quite a long time to come out, but given that it was a Friday night I didn't mind.  The chicken and orzo pasta was great! The orzo practically melted in your mouth, and the sauce with the chicken had a nice kick to it at the end. The beef loin was just as good, and my date kept raving about the potatoes, and how well the beef was cooked.  The only thing that I did not like here was the service. They were very inattentive, and did not come over at all after we got our meals. Our waters were left without refills, and we were brought the check before even being asked if we wanted dessert. I would be willing to come back again to give the restaurant another shot as the food was good, but the service that we received does make me hesitant.",0.9754,0.852,0.126,0.022,0.6882352941176472

Next time, I would come with plenty of time to spare, for a special event with readiness to spend more money, and order three courses.

She said she once bumped into STING here, so naturally my first experience here was a huge disappointment when I went and he wasn't there!!! Kidding. But the fact that Sting was there says a lot.  I went to NoMI for the first time with my best friend on her birthday. Each entree was a dreamy combination of healthy yet extravagant. My best friend is gluten AND dairy free which can be challenging when eating out, but this wasn't a problem at NoMI. Our server Tom was friendly and more than accommodating. My friend and I asked for non-alcoholic options since it was a Tuesday night. The first thing Tom suggested was a specialty strawberry ginger brew with fresh mint. What?! Little did he know that my best friend and I are ginger brew connoisseurs! We each ordered one. BEST GINGER BREW TO DATE.  For the entree I ordered the sushi. It was glorious.

I've been here for the brunch buffet and several lunches, and with each meal, the quality was always great. Most recently I tried an amazing dessert - goat milk panna cotta with earl grey grapefruit gelee, hibiscus poached citrus salad and honey gel/champagne foam - that was perfectly seasonal and oh so tasty.

2017-02-13,5.0,"So impressed by this beautiful restaurant in the Park Hyatt. We were somewhat saddened by the fact that we didn't manage to get reservations to a Michelin starred restaurant, so we chose NoMi for lunch during restaurant week. I can confidently say that the experience did not leave anything to be desired! We were seated promptly with our reservation and were fortunate enough to get seats right by the window. The view of the Water Tower and Michigan Avenue is spectacular.  Onto the food.... NoMi offered a restaurant week menu of two courses for $22. I chose the following:  - Sweet Potato Soup: Let me preface this by saying I had a butternut squash soup at Fred's the day before. Where that soup was bland and tasteless, this soup was rich and flavorful. Great flavor balance and LOVED the hint of lime. - Smoked Chicken Risotto: Smokey bits of chicken in a rich risotto made with aged white cheddar. Very strong flavor profile. My favorite part was actually the crispy mushrooms in the dish. I definitely appreciated the serving size because it was just enough and not too much richness. When asking for the dessert menu, the waiter misheard our request and brought us the check instead. While a minor mishap, he surprised us by giving us one of our desserts on the house! We got: - Key Lime Mousse: I am a sucker for lime and devoured many Key Lime pies while in Key West this past year. I must say that NoMi made it just a step better. We really enjoyed the black pepper meringues that decorated the plate! - Kaffir Lime Ice Cream Bar: This one was a bit surprising (largely due to our own naivete). We didn't realize it was a chocolate ice cream bar infused with Kaffir. The taste was very unique! We really loved the passionfruit as well.

I was prepared to be waiting for a seat to open up (as we've done when we are at the signature room) but was very pleased that there was a table ready for us with what I think was the best view in the house! It also was restaurant week, which we didn't end up doing (the whole party dining must do the restaurant week dinner) but the deal actually looked very reasonable.  To start we got a few pieces of salmon nigiri which I think is the best salmon I have ever had to date. The pieces were so thick cut and SO fresh.  We also got a small charcuterie board to start which was just ok .. I've definitely had better.  I got the chicken risotto as my main course and my boyfriend had the scallops. Both were top notch. We also got a side of the mushrooms with spinach which was good too.  We got a complimentary dessert as well as we were celebrating our anniversary, which was some kind of layered torte with chocolate and pistachios (I'm guessing??) and a scoop of sorbet. Not my favorite but it was presented beautifully!  My only negative comment was our waiter wasn't the most attentive - at the end of the meal I was waiting to order another drink for at least 10/15 min but not the biggest deal in the world.  I'd say the menu is not that extensive but all dishes sound excellent. Great experience overall.",0.9976,0.721,0.254,0.025,0.5491666666666666
2017-02-06,3.0,"Another one down for Restaurant Week. I have been to the bar, but have never eaten in the Restaurant. The views are really nice, especially if you score a seat by the windows, which I did! I had the whitefish with the basmati rice and it was really good, but the portion was really small. I hear small portions are typical here, which I am not sure how I would feel about paying the full price of $35 for such a small meal that will leave me hungry, especially when there are so many other places in the area where the food is good, you are guaranteed to get full and get more for your money. Don't get me wrong the whitefish and salad was delicious, but still you are mostly paying for the views and atmosphere. Luckily the entree also came with a salad so it helped to fill you up. They are only a 2 course for lunch where other's are 3 course during Restaurant Week, so no desert is included, which was kinda a bummer because I hear the almond joy bar is really good.  The service is outstanding and you never wait long for anything you ask for/or don't ask for. I also ordered a cocktail, and it was $15. They sell bottled (still) water (Voss) for $8. It really can add up here quickly! My final take is this is a special occasion spot you come to for celebrating, a bring someone you want to impress spot, or a you're rich and spending 100's of dollars on food/drinks don't matter to you spot. Glad I had a chance to experience it for a fraction of the cost, during Restaurant Week.",0.9961,0.756,0.208,0.036,0.6330481150793651

2016-10-03,2.0,"This is a cute place for fine dining and ultimately a beautiful view of the city. I came here on a Saturday around 1:00 pm. It wasn't packed, maybe around 8 tables were full. There were certainly just as many bus boys and servers as there were people dining. Parking is not easily accessible if you're not staying at the hotel, you have the option of valet or there's a garage nearby.  I highly recommend making reservations ahead of time to avoid waiting. We were actually running late to our reservations but we called in advance and let the staff at NoMi know, they were very accommodating. One thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a great appetizer menu at all. In fact, they couple the salads and starters and if you're from out of this country, you may have a hard time making a distinction between the two. I thought the appetizer menu was extremely limited and lacked variety. I was pretty disappointed for a lunch menu. We dipped straight into the main dish. I personally love anything shrimp Tempura and I asked the waiter what he considered to be the best sushi and he recommended the tiger sushi. I had the tiger sushi, which is shrimp tempura, snow crab, spicy big eye tuna and avocado. I have to say, I was really disappointed. It was spicy but it lacked a savory flavor that left its trace in your mouth. It lacked that additional umpf That sets it apart from, let's say, Mariano's sushi. If the waiter considered that to be the best, then what does that say about the rest of the sushi? Anyways, my mom had the Skuna Bay Salmon with Tomatillo salsa verde, black bean, sweet corn chow chow. My mom literally said to me, ""I should've eaten before I came here"" because the portions are really small. I did remind her that this is fine dining. She said that her salmon was half cooked half raw, were not sure if it's suppose to be cooked that way but for $38, she ate it. She thought that the side should have been better because the sweet corn chow chow was a joke, not even a child can get full off that. She loved the glaze and the presentation but that is literally all we paid for. My moms friend had the grilled Korean Shortribs which is Basmati Rice, kimchi, pea shots, sweet soy glaze. Lol, once again you're paying for the view and the ambiance, not the food. We were lucky if the ribs had any meat on them, that's how thinly cut it was. The glaze itself was spicy but overall, the ribs lacked meat. The rice was what kept my moms friend full because the kimchi and peas did not do the meal any justice.

2016-09-15,4.0,I came here on a weekday when the weather was very nice in Chicago for a nice little lunch with my hubby as we wanted to enjoy the last of this summers nice weather and we had a great time. Around noon it was pretty empty and by one pm it was getting pretty packed so you may want to make reservations especially if you come on a weekend. To start out we got a few glasses of rose which was nice and crisp and definitely delicious. Our server was pretty attentive throughout so that was nice that you can expect good service here. The food is a little pricey from $18 for a pastrami sandwich to $28 for a little lobster roll sandwich. We got a few sandwiches and everything was tasty and very carefully presented. Like many have said before me you do come here for the view with a hefty price tag but I can't say that the food was bad. It wasn't remarkable but it was tasty and I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and food enough to warrant a trip back here. I wasn't sure if I was going to get dessert but they had a dark chocolate mousse bomb and I absolutely had to get it and so glad I did. It was amazing and my favorite thing here so who knows next time I may just come for wine and dessert after lunch somewhere else.

2016-09-04,5.0,"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at NoMi on Saturday night and the experience couldn't have been more wonderful.  First of all this restaurant couldn't be in a more picturesque location. Our table looked out on the Water Tower and the lake. We were happy the moment we sat down.  Someone was at our table immediately with water, a crusty roll with butter and  taking our drink order.  Let me suggest the French 75! The entire staff was so welcoming and our server,  Shannon,  was the perfect blend of professional, knowledgeable and helpful. Is it possible to request a certain server when you go to a restaurant? If so, Shannon is our guy. We had decided to dine  At NoMi  specifically because of the new executive chef, Ed Sura. We have eaten at Perinnial Virant many times when he was working there and we have never had a bad dish. Last night was no exception.  Food is meant to be savored with the eye as well as the tongue and I made sure to take a picture of each course  just so I could savor it later.  I started with the Werp farm greens  salad  with a chamomile apple vinaigrette that was so light and croutons that somehow were crispy and soft at the same time. My husband had a simple tomato salad that with the first bite turned out to not be so simple at all.  Buried under the beautiful summer tomatoes was a mound of burrata chess that was so creamy and delicious.  And hidden among the tomatoes were little slices of marinated watermelon.  I kept switching from my salad to his. On to the entres... I was lucky enough to try two entres last night - the eggplant cannelloni, which was a great vegetarian choice and the Chicken Ballotine with white beans, basil pesto and Parmesan.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful it was almost unnecessary to chew.  it just melted in your mouth. My husband was lucky enough to also experience two entres and had the Diver Scallops with fennel purée and he said it was one of the best dishes he had ever eaten.  His second dish was the Crispy Braised Pork Belly. He said this dish also was one of the best dishes he had eaten. At this point we were ready to be rolled out onto Michigan Avenue but Shannon suggested we try the peach cobbler for two with the goat milk ice cream. He didn't have to twist our arms very hard! First of all don't believe the servers when they say ""for two"" because 6 people could have easily shared this dish.  The cobbler was flakey and warm and the ice cream was delicious. Speaking of large servings - unlike a lot of fine dining establishments the portion sizes at NoMi were substantial. It would be impossible to walk away wanting more. We brought leftovers home. Our experience at NoMi was great and plan to add this restaurant to our list of repeat restaurants when we visit Chicago. Keep up the good work Chef Ed!",0.9953,0.867,0.127,0.007,0.5506435650303574

2016-07-25,1.0,"This review is specific to the bar staff and service. After a meal, my date and I decided to enjoy a bottle of Pinot Noir in the bar area. The wine tasted overly tannic for a Pinot Noir. So we suggested decanting the wine. The server disappeared for about 20 minutes (pouring the wine into a decanter should only take a couple of minutes).  The wine still tasted bad so the server said that she would bring over the sommelier. 30 minutes passed by. No sommelier ever showed up. We complained to the manager and nothing happened. At that point, I just paid the bill (with taxes over $90 for this bottle of wine that we barely touched), and left. My advice: avoid the Nomi bar area like the black plague. And if you must come here, don't bring a date. This place will destroy any romantic vibe you might have had before being seated.

Nice decor, friendly service, enormous maki on plates everywhere... it was a warm day, so we decided to go for some refreshing sushi as well. We figured the $78 NoMI selection would be enough for two people, as there was nothing particularly fancy described in the menu. We're from New York, and unless you're sitting down with Ichimura-san, $78 buys you a lot of fish. WE WERE WRONG. Let me tell you what $78 buys you here: Sashimi - 3 pieces of fluke, 3 pieces of regular tuna, 2 pieces of scallop Nigiri - 1 cooked shrimp, 1 cooked eel, 1 regular tuna, 1 regular salmon Maki - 4 pieces of California roll (real crab), 4 pieces of spicy tempura roll Think about it this way. What if you bought sushi and sashimi for one person at $39, and it came with four small pieces of sashimi, two nigiri, and four pieces of maki, with nothing fancier than a scallop on the plate? Well, we got two times that for $78. Given the quality, this had to be the most overpriced sushi in the nation - unless perhaps you were buying it at an establishment owned by Larry Flynt. No one goes to his joints for the fish, either.",0.4342,0.907,0.055,0.038,0.4798551122080533

2016-02-27,4.0,"I came here a couple weeks ago during restaurant week.   I had been here once for dinner and had a spectacular meal, so for $33 and a three course lunch, you couldn't beat the value at this high end restaurant.  I arrive during the latter part of lunch to avoid to hectic lunch crowd.   My server notices I'm dining solo and offers me a newspaper.  Little does he know I'm really here to take three thousand pictures of the food and jot down a bunch of notes to get it back to my yelp family.  The Malbec listed under wines by the glass was very smooth and delightful.  Excellent choice.  The server even tops off my glass and let's me finish the bottle (maybe he notices my Celinè bag sitting next to me in anticipation of a big tip)... (considering the table next to me had a group of college students with overstuffed backpacks - something I never expect to see here on any other day, and the table in front of me is filled with a husband, wife, and a loud baby in a child carrier with a strange looking cloth).  I was hoping to see my reflection in the wine glass and make funny faces, but whomever wiped the wine glasses down left towel dust particles on the glass.   First comes the soup.  Celeriac and truffle soup, with potato bouchon, smoked apple jam.  It is warm, creamy, but not too thick.  The sweetness from the apple complements the soup, but there's too much of it, and therefore, it seems a bit out of place.  If you were to close your eyes and eat the soup you might think Campbell's.  I'm thinking maybe it needs salt.  Nope.  Didn't help.  I choose the veal cheek.  Cabernet Sauvignon braised veal cheek.  It is placed onto of a green pea cream, toasted parsnip, and baby carrots.  Visually pleasing.  The plate is hot.  Nice.  Soft.  The meat melts in my mouth.  This reminds me of a home cooked stew that been a secret family recipe for years.  I feel like a lot of thought had been put into the dish.  I am smiling.  The pea puree is vibrant in color and tastes very fresh.   I look over to see that the hostess is feverishly rubbing her nose, sees me looking at her, and completely shies away and stops.  Haha Alas, my always favorite part of the meal.  Dessert.  I love the way the open dessert station s close to me, and I watch the pastry cook completely focused on making each dessert beautiful, all the while opening and closing little containers of each component and appearing very detailed to both the individual dishes and working in a timely manner.  I am proud of her, and appreciate her meticulous nature.  2015 Chicago Rising Star Pastry Chef Greg Mosko heads the pastry team, and I'm looking forward to seeing his creation for this week.  Huckleberry Mousse Bombè, coriander financier, caramelized pear, micro greens, candied coconut, coconut gel, meyer lemon center.  The mousse is light, the financier is moist and used as a base for the mousse.  The gelatin gives it a nice sheen.  The sourness of the lemon complements the huckleberry mousse as well as the bits of huckleberry on the plate.  The coconut chips add crunch and texture and have citrus zest bits which add flavor.  The accompaniments of the chopped stone fruit and coconut cream really pull the whole dessert together.  This is not overwhelmingly sweet, which in my book is the most important.",0.9972,0.84,0.136,0.023,0.5183535353535353

The servers had perfect timing on refills, dish changes and silverware replacement.  They were always around when needed, but never imposing.  The rest of the staff was very gracious, as well.  For the price, the food was abysmal.  The rolls were loose, sloppy and flavorless. The tortellini was overcooked. The bass actually tasted fishy- not like anything had been done flavor it.  I'm all for simplicity and can appreciate letting the fish do its thing, but the smell and taste was, for lack of a better word, fishy- definitely unappetizing. The dessert shell on the chocolate tasted like plastic.  The wine pairings, with exception of the red, tasted cheap. My favorite part of the meal was the bottle of champagne we ordered.  The bill ended up being about $630.  For that price, I think it is fair to have expected a meal that someone put time, care and attention into.  That was. unfortunately, not what we experienced.   It's been a few days since the experience, but I can't shake the disappointment.  Won't be going back to splurge on any more over priced meals at NoMI.",0.9863,0.744,0.191,0.064,0.5888795986622073

2016-02-15,5.0,"Upscale dining and unbelievable dishes without the upscale attitude. We came for dinner during Valentine's Day weekend, but opted to order from the normal menu rather than the featured prix fixe choices ($125/person, $175 with wine pairings). NoMi did not the dreaded over-the-top celebratory atmosphere that we anticipated. The dining room was elegant yet understated. We were presented with freshly baked rolls and herbal butter, which paired nicely with the dill-based breads, as well as an extensive drink menu. To start, we had the Sushi Platter, which featured an assortment of nigiri and several chef's selections (roe, tamago, others). Each piece was beautifully presented, and had a smooth, delicate texture. It was perhaps the best quality sushi we have experienced in Chicago. The ginger was unremarkable, but the wasabi was much hotter than expected. For main courses we had the pan-seared black cod, which was served with a consommé over roasted root vegetables and fried celeriac straws. The fish was flaky but moist -  perfectly cooked. We also enjoyed the veal cheek, which was braised in cabernet sauvignon and served over creamed peas, with whole peas and buttered carrots on top. The meat was tender enough to cut with a fork, and complimented the light vegetables nicely, though a touch salty. For dessert we tried the ""Textures of Chocolate"", which did not disappoint. The chocolate ganache formed a ring, inside which the vanilla caramel sauce laid beneath the chocolate and kaffir lime sorbet. Each piece was simply outstanding. Other then the ganache, the biggest surprise was the prominence of the vanilla flavor in the caramel sauce. The ganache itself was unbelievably smooth and rich, and covered with small rocks of salt. The hot chocolate foam and chocolate knobs flowed from within the ring, and each provided exceptional flavor in varying textures. The entire experience was spot on. Our waitstaff was thorough and attentive but not disruptive in the least. Everything from initial coat check to the final bill was extremely friendly and efficient, such that you never got the impression they were doing you a favor by letting you eat in their restaurant.

Between the two of us, we tried six different plates and all of them were so good that I left saying I couldn't pick a favorite and if I was to do the same meal again, I would have a very hard time deciding which dishes to eat again. I won't go so much into the details of the dish (refer to pictures) just because I don't think the restaurant week plates are on their regular menu but based on my experience here, I would definitely come back again to try their normal menu. All our dishes were gorgeously plated with bright and colorful ingredients. Everything tasted so fresh but without that 'I think I'm eating dirt' taste. You could really taste each and every piece that the chef puts on the plate. I was a huge fan of everything but the Huckleberry mousse bombe dessert was just the most exceptional way to end the meal. The best part was the sour Meyer lemon puree core that really hits you.  The one thing that was just a little over the top was the saltiness of each dish. I wish they toned it down a little because the salt really added up, particularly in the soup and vegetables which would taste great even without all the seasoning. Other than that, I super enjoyed the general ambiance of the restaurant.

2016-01-28,1.0,"This is my first time to ever give a bad review. I was very disheartened with my experience yesterday for lunch. NoMI has been my number one spot for Restaurant Week lunch for the past 3 years. I also love stopping by the lounge for drinks and dessert when friends visit town. I always raved about this place for the amazing food and the impeccable service. Yesterday's lunch was nothing like the NoMI I was used to. I hope the restaurant can take this honest feedback and seriously improve their service and food quality during lunch.  We usually make later lunch reservations to have a quieter experience but it was buzzing when we arrived. I thought that was great at the time, but now I think they were severely understaffed because of it. No one greeted us for several minutes after being seated. The server came by to finally greet us and asked us about bottled or tap water. We requested tap. Several minutes later bread was brought to our table. Still no water. The back waiter asked us for bottled or tap water. We told him someone was working on bringing us tap water. We also asked for an a la carte menu because we always like to order a sushi roll or two along with our RW menu. The back waiter told us that it is only Restaurant Week menu for lunch. Bummer. The server came by and we placed our order. Lobster Bisque, Truffle Soup, Veal Cheek, Black Cod, Huckleberry Mousse and Cookies and Candy. Lobster Bisque was not bisque at all. Very thin consistency. Very watered down. The cream never emulsified and when mixed it looked like just dishwater in a bowl with curdled milk. We had to replace it with the truffle soup. The truffle soup was on point with consistency but I honestly could not smell or taste truffle in the soup. It also needed more salt. Just lack of flavors in that soup. A new spoon was never replenished for the new soup bowl either. We were really bummed out at this point. Entrees plating looked great. The veal cheek needed more salt though. The piece of cod and consommé were delicious but a spoon was not mis en placed to enjoy all of the consommé. We had to use the last of our bread to sop up what we could. Desserts were fired too early. My friend still had three bites of cod left. The server put down dessert forks before we were complete with the entree course. The food runner stood there with our desserts in hand and the waiter had cleared my entree plate and our bread plates and literally stood there while my friend ate her last few bites. Absurd! This was really infuriating. As for desserts, the huckleberry mousse was absolutely delicious. I really liked the caramel chocolate truffle with the candy plate. The least favorite was the yuzu chocolate truffle with the candy plate. It tasted off. The server offered coffee and he even asked if I would like cream and sugar. I never received that coffee. He walked by our table and then hustled to the side station when we were almost complete with dessert. I thought maybe he just remembered the coffee. Nope. He hustled to the side station to print our check. And then he hovered after dropping it. He asked us twice about the check and if we wanted to cash out. We asked for the manager after giving him our payment. Ryan came over and I gave him all the feedback. I even pointed out that I had to flag him down during service to refill my water because no one was refilling waters. He, of course, did nothing to rectify anything. He was very apathetic to our feedback. Very disappointing, NoMI. The attention to detail was not there that day and the food was not to par. Our server was Luis.

2016-01-22,3.0,"Dined here for lunch during restaurant week. Started with Parmesan encrusted egg and lobster bisque. Egg was nicely soft boiled inside, and lobster bisque was not too rich and pieces of diced mango and bok choy offset a bit of the saltiness of the bisque. Unfortunately the saltiness continued with the black cod... The cod itself was cooked perfectly but the consommé poured on top was the culprit. Beet gnocchi was a win-win combination containing goat cheese and candied walnuts. Again the goat cheese was a bit over salted but again the sweetness of the walnuts helped to offset this. The desserts were all visually appealing and delicious. The server was also considerate enough to make up a nut free plate for my sister who is allergic to nuts. He was also kind enough to move us to a table next to the window when one became available.

The halibut was perfectly cooked (moist yet flaky) and melted on the tongue. Only downside is I enjoy craft beer and they do not have any craft beer on tap. It is a good place for wine or high end cocktails. Keep in mind, you are paying for high quality food and the price is higher per plate but the food quality is definitely worth it.

Their sushi is satisfying but not fantastic but I didn't expect it to be. Their dinner menu was very good. We started with half a dozen east/west coast selection oysters. I'm bias towards the west coast ones coming from Cali.  We orders a kids California roll for our daughter which uses real crab meat. We then ordered two appetizers which turned out to be a bit much since Chicago portions are quite large.  We had a braised pork belly with some sort of corn purée.   It was very good, not too fatty and so tender.  We also ordered a foie tartine with a roasted peach and jelly.  My wife has their lobster salad as her entree and I had their skirt steak. Both were very delicious!  The lobster salad is very small but it's all lobster which wife liked a lot.   I would say overall a great experience!  Average wait staff, attentive but not over whelming. Had to ask water to be filled once but they came over to check on the little one to see if she was okay.  I say if you're staying here go for it since it's convenient and food is good. Price is what I would pay for a nice hotel and similar to west coast prices. 4 stars no doubt.  Would eat here again!",0.9808,0.82,0.133,0.048,0.5802182539682541

The Nomi benedict was also good, but it didn't wow me.  You can't go wrong with this entree though. The Brioche French Toast - Chocolate hazelnut with banana was also really good, but the pancakes were better so get the pancakes instead.  This wasn't amazing, but it was still good, maybe it was the chocolate and banana. The Smoked Salmon Tartine with Tomato, red onion, capers, farm egg, lemon dill cream cheese, grilled ciabatta was also good.  It is extremely filling so if you order this, you probably won't be able to eat anything else since the bread is huge and super duper filling!   The menu here is very simple, but you can't go wrong with eating here for breakfast.  They did a great job with service and presentation.",0.9981,0.704,0.288,0.008,0.6418320105820106

If you got seated by the window, the view was unbelievable! Plus, the inside of the restaurant was just pretty and swanky.  I was sad that platinum in Hyatt didn't mean shit and only Diamond members get to eat free here. We still went because I have been wanting to try. Despite being a restaurant inside a hotel, it is well known to be a destination for people in general to dine there and not just hotel patron because it has been known to be good. We just went for breakfast and their weekday menu was definitely simpler than the brunch menu some friends talked about. The menu were pretty much just eggs several styles: Benedicts, scrambled, omelette. There were pancakes, French Toast, smoothies - pretty standard. My sister got the scrambled egg with bacon and I had over easy with bacon. The niece got a green smoothie.  The bacon were so good as they were Nueske's. Of course it would be good. The oven fried potatoes were also so prettily made. At the end of the day, we got just regular breakfast you could get elsewhere fraction of the price. The service was superb and very attentive. It was a very nice breakfast. For close to $100 for eggs and bacon, it was hardly worth it. The view and service were awesome though.

Not only that, but when our steak came out, it was cold. The salmon was excellent, though, and once they re-cooked the steak, it was very good. We got the Nomi roll to start and agreed that it was pretty average. They comp'd us on dessert, which was nice. Also nice were the drinks, which were super strong and made waiting an hour for your food more tolerable.

The prefix lunch menu was a 3 course meal for $22 and a window table on the 7th floor overlooking Michigan Ave on a snowing day was just marvelous. The menu may appear simple, but each dish was executed with care and complimented really well with other ingredients to bring out the flavor. The plate may seem small, but quite filling. House coffee is $5.  Leek and Mussel Bisque: the dry ingredients  (bacon, heirloom apple, and etc) were on a soup plate, then the bisque was poured over. For a cream base soup, the texture was light and flavorful. The apple adds sweetness to the soup and balance well with the salted bacon.  Olive oil Roasted skatewing: the fish was flash roasted just right and flaky, The bourbon cherries and the almond add bit of sweetness to the entree. The entree display was a work of art.  Cookie and Candies: Salted caramel macaroon with dash of glitter atop was well presented. The chocolate cookie, madeline, and almond nougat were okay. It was nice to sample a variety of treats.  ----- I also sampled my husband's prefix Farm egg salad: Presented with baby romaine, greens, and gruyere cheese. It was very creative to have flash fried whole egg and the yolk was medium rare. The gooey yolk itself serves as dressing which was very enjoyable and tasty. Wagyu Beef brisket: Nice presentation, but the beef looked dried. Until i took a bite.. it was tender and beefy. Brisket was complimented with tomato jam. I enjoyed it!

Our experience was completely ruined by the terrible service that occurred for more than half of our meal before another server (perhaps manager?) noticed how completely frustrated we were and swooped in to try to recover our meal. We live in the city and were also staying at the hotel for a night away. We decided to go to NoMI because it had a good reputation and also for convenience sake of not having to leave hotel. Never again though. Upon being seated, our drink order was taken by our waiter. The two tables next to us also ordered drinks a few minutes later. Their drinks were immediately brought. We, meanwhile, sat there and sat there and sat there. Finally at least 10 minutes later, the waiter dropped our drinks off and stood there while I asked a variety of questions about the menu, rather than him walking us through it and telling us the specials. We ordered some appetizers, at which point he haughtily told us to order all at once because the kitchen will plan out timing of the dishes. Sounds great! So we did.  This was the last time our waiter EVER came to our table. Our appetizers came as expected. The soup was a bit bland, but the oysters were phenomenal.  At this point, my wine and my husband's water is completely empty. We sat there waiting for our entree for a good while with dirty dishes in front of us and no drinks to be had. Our entrees arrive, but not our sides. I'm also still thirsty. Still no waiter to see how things are going or refill drinks.  I finally had to flag down another table's waiter to get water and another round of drinks and inquire about our sides. Guess that kitchen meal planning didn't work out so well. We finally get our sides, a new round of drinks. Our sushi and brussel sprouts were decently good and a solid 4 stars. Now I'm looking forward to dessert... no waiter to be found. I wait another ten or so minutes with our dirty dishes and my husband's empty beer glass. I finally flag down ANOTHER person to clear our table and attempt to order dessert. At this point, the manager (waiter?) realized we had NO waiter and were having to traffic control people to our table to get anything we wanted. I want to remind people, this is not a bar we are at, this is a meal where I am expecting to spend $250 on two people. There is no reason why I should be going to these great lengths to do any of this. It was so distracting to our conversation and overshadowed the food.  What made this SO comical, is that our original waiter continued serving the two tables next to us. At one point, he even took the drink menu off our table and walked away saying nothing!  While I greatly appreciate the manager tryign to rectify things and comping our side and my coffee, the service was abysmal and left us wondering if we did something wrong to be treated so poorly.

The views weren't quite as nice by the bar are they are in the dining room and patio, but it was still decent scenery.  Everything we ordered was delicious and the presentation was absolutely beautiful. I don't think I've ever eaten such a pretty salad! The NoMI greens had excellent flavor and the dressing just barely coated the greens in a perfect amount! I also had the NoMI maki roll which had spicy tuna and eel inside. The fish was very high quality, and the roll overall was flavorful and fresh tasting. However, it was pretty pricey at $21 for the single roll. I also had a bite of the chicken salad wrap and mushroom blue cheese flatbread, and I highly recommend both.  The menu has a nice variety, so there's something for everyone.

What I really liked was the fact that all the chefs seemed like they really enjoyed working. As you can guess we had a table right by the kitchen. Most prefer to sit by the windows to catch the views which Im sure is very nice but we didnt have that luxury on our visit.  On to the Food. Absolutely delectable. Im sure a place like this changes the menu items pretty frequently but we had the perch which was light and delicious, one of the most flavorful fish dishes ive had in recent memory. And we also had the succulent pig which was expertly prepared and robust.  Here are the area where NoMi doesnt get the fifth star. First the cocktails. Maybe im spoiled because I live in los angeles where mixology is famed. But the cocktails here left ALOT to be desired. Which is extremely disappointing because our waiter told us they have a guy who comes in to expertly balance the cocktails. If so they might consider finding a new guy. I ordered a cocktail where the main liquor was supposed to be gin however it arrived looking deep brown in color and in a small wine glass, thats fine, but upon tasting it, I swear im not crazy here the drink tasted like maple syrup. Seriously. I shared it and I got the same feedback. We also tried another Whiskey based drinking with egg white. Which was also underwhelming.  I will go on to say that the meal was very competitively priced which i was very pleased with. If youre in the area I highly recommend this place for a fine dining experience.

My feeling is that Park Hyatt quality is without peer. We found ourselves in front of Chicago's Park Hyatt with 40 minutes before lunch. I suggested coffee. Once inside, I asked where, and the gentleman directed us toward a small enclave at the other end of the room. The focal point of this lobby sitting area was a wall display of incredible fossils that included the large plate of the best crinoids I've ever seen - so cool. We found the complimentary coffee there, laughed and told him we were not guests (I'm sure he already knew that). We inquired further and he directed us to floor 7. This - pointing us initially toward the free coffee - is a signature move that oozes service quality.  Once upstairs we discovered NoMi - a well-appointed smallish restaurant that's built into wine racks along with great views of the city around and below.  At this point, wine over coffee was an easy decision.

For dessert, I got the eclair, which my boyfriend and I had different opinions about. I thought the lemon touch was pretty interesting but he said it took away all the goodness from a real eclair.

For food, I decided to start off with the celeriac soup.  It was served with spiced pistachios, fromage blanc, and sourdough.  Not only was the presentation beautiful, but it tasted great.  The different flavors from the spiced pistachios and the sourdough complemented the soup perfectly without overpowering the simplicity of it.  For my entrée, I decided to go with the truffled bucatini.  This was definitely a hearty pasta dish (even though it may not look like it) with great flavors, but it wasn't the best pasta dish I have eaten.  I finished off with the milk chocolate éclair.  It was filled with half lemon curds and half milk chocolate, topped off with graham crunch and a tiny mascarpone cake.  Probably one of the best éclair I have ever eaten.  The only complaint I had was that one of my friend's éclair wasn't filled with any lemon curds, which I thought was the best part.  Having such great experience thus far, I would thought there would be some consistency. Overall, the service was impeccable, food was decent, presentation was gorgeous, and the view was amazing.  I wouldn't have thought a restaurant in a hotel would be this well rounded.  For restaurant week, the pre-fixe menu was for $22.  I'm not sure I would pay anything higher for the portion size I received.  But if you get a chance to try out NoMi for restaurant week or feel like splurging for the view and presentations of your entrees, then go right on ahead.  It was definitely a great experience.",0.9927,0.751,0.184,0.065,0.6307029478458049

2013-08-21,3.0,"I had no expectation of this place since it was a surprise dinner location from my boyfriend.  In order to get here, you'll have to go inside the Park Hyatt and take the elevator on your right to NoMi.  Now, I am a fan of big taste even if a restaurant is expensive - if it is worth the price, then I will return.  However, NoMi was hit-and-miss for some areas of the menu, while the service was consistently exceptional from being seated to paying the bill.   The beau and I started off with a bottle of Domaine de L'aujardiere Chardonnay and then we ordered the NoMi roll (spicy big eye tuna, eel, cucumber).  The NoMI roll was tender and delicious. Each bite had enough flavor to negate using soy sauce.  I kept eyeing other tables and seeing dinner rolls.  These were tasty dinner rolls and you could see and taste the dill with each bite.  I wanted to take a picture, but I figured that it would be in poor taste since this restaurant is upscale.   Next, we ordered the foie gras. I would highly recommend ordering this no matter which variation is currently on the menu.  I did hear, however, that they were going to switch the menu and perhaps they already have on the website because the foie gras on the dinner menu has a different description than the one we ordered.  Nonetheless, the foie gras itself is made perfectly - fluffy, buttery, and velvety texture.  The foie gras came with a peach cobbler/granola and dollop of vanilla creme fraiche.  Best foie gras to enter this mouth yet! Up to this point, I felt like all of the food was delicious.  I really could've had more of that foie gras and maki roll.  I started to believe that all of the fantastic dishes were foreshadowing an even bigger treat... our entrees.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed and this is where NoMI lost a lot of points from me.   My beau had the prosciutto-wrapped monkfish, while I had the buttered lobster tail.  We also ordered a side of beets, per our waiter's suggestion.  Although it wasn't my dish, I was expecting great things from the prosciutto-wrapped monkfish.  I absolutely love monkfish (also known as poor man's lobster); monkfish has a texture akin to lobster, which is why I find it so delectable.  Once the monkfish arrived and I quickly snatched a small medallion of my boyfriend's food (classy, yes), my face could not hide the disappointment.  We both agreed that the prosciutto overly salted the monkfish, so that each bite was like ingesting teaspoons of salt.  The saltiness wasn't even the primary issue... the texture.  Remember I said it's dubbed poor man's lobster? This poor monkfish was overcooked and dry.  I was utterly disappointed.  But wait! I ordered real lobster.   I assembled some lobster on my spoon along with the nest of ingredients in my bowl and took a bite.  Okay, yeah.  Redemption at its finest.  What's this I see at the bottom of my bowl? Oh, okay.  It's probably a seafood broth of sorts -let's taste...  Is it really supposed to be a broth? I wasn't sure if it was a broth or just water accumulation at the bottom of my bowl from the juices of the ingredients because it tasted bland and watered down.  Really? I was fooled.  The starters (NoMI roll and foie gras) were great, but I was let down with our entrees.  Even my boyfriend likes his food salty, but the monkfish was just over salted and overcooked.   I would be lying if I said the main dishes destroyed my dining experience because it didn't due to the A+ service.  Our server found out that we were celebrating a special occasion and brought us out a chocolate dessert and dessert wine.  Those were the finishing touches to a memorable night despite the just-average entrees. NoMI wasn't a terrible experience especially with the top-notch service, but I don't think it won me over to visit for another special occasion; I will probably end up trying another four to five star restaurant in the area.",0.9939,0.792,0.136,0.072,0.5537389770723105

For all intents and purposes it was like many other restaurants of its type found in all major cities in the United States, but the food there always tasted that little bit better. It isn't down to the food, although it is exquisite. It's because of the personalized service. In that regard, it is like nowhere else I have ever been before. When I arrive they welcome me back, not because I am a regular and a familiar face, but because they bothered to look in their records to see if I had been there before. And my waiter refers to me as Mr. Bofkin and not generically as sir.  And when I took my wife there to celebrate her birthday one year, somehow they knew and printed her name and an endearing birthday message on her menu.

SIGH.  If there was one redeeming thing about Nomi, it's 2 things- 1) It's in the Hyatt* (my review says Hyatt at the top, but I wrote the Peninsula right here for whatever reason. thanks to the fellow poster who helped me correct this!).  Which means... a. the doorman is always friendly; b. either after or before your disappointing meal, you can go to Pierre Gourmet nearby for some macarons (which are also overrated and $5/macaron, see my Pierre Gourmet review); c. it's in a great location to shop around before/afterwards.  Nordstrom rack and many other places are at your finger tips.  Within a blocks, there's a big strip of department stores. 2) The management.  I found the hostesses ok, not terrible or great.  Not exactly welcoming but also not rejecting.  I do think a hostess should always be very warm and welcoming though.  The waiters were just ok, but the management is what's great here.  Once, I asked for carry-out, which they seemed to make a semi-big deal about (supposedly they never do that), but they arranged it successfully. Now onto the negatives.  So, Nomi is a huge disappointment.  I'm disappointed by a lot of the Peninsula and Hyatt eateries, and this is one of 2 Hyatt eateries I dislike (love the Hyatt's brunch btw).  If I stay here and miss the brunch, then I eat outside the hotel. Where to start? 1) Quantity.  I expect higher end eateries to serve smaller portions... but these portions are joke-like.  I ordered 2 lobsters, and they looked like 1/4 leftovers from a small appetizer.  Wtf.  I will give it to them that their presentation was nice, though? ....  2) Their sushi and fish is just OK.  I ordered 2 makis, also just OK!  WTF- if you want sushi, GO ELSEWHERE.  It's not super fresh, but also not bad quality or old...  It's just unremarkable.  And also, they did a bad job marinading/seasoning the sushi meats.  I truly believe the Nomi chefs must not be Asian, or if so, they're just an embarrassment to Asian sushi chefs. I wish I could give alternate recommendations for other sushi spots to try in Chicago, but I can't.  I don't like any sushi spots I've visited in Chicago.

I went there on the recommendation of a friend who had been there years ago and raved about the place. I went last night, and I was sorely disappointed. The food is good, but holy crap the service was terrible. I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant. It's almost as if the servers were all irritated that my presence compelled them to have to do their jobs. I was embarrassed to have taken friends there. Let me be specific. I had a reservation for 8pm. We were told upon arrival that they were running behind and it would be 10 minutes. That's annoying, but not terrible. We took a seat at the bar. Half an hour later, we were told it would still be a bit longer. We asked for menus. We were given a menu, but no one ever came over to take our order. (We were ordering drinks, though.) About 45 minutes after our reservation time, a hostess came to us and seated us. We sat for a few minutes, when finally a surely waiter came by to take our order.  We told him we wanted an appetizer and would need another minute to settle on entrees (I realize we were idiots for not being ready to jump at the chance to get some food). He refused to take our appetizer order, telling us that he takes the orders all at once. This, despite having waited 45 minutes past our reservation for a table. He came back a bit later and agreed to take our orders. We saw him one other time that night, when he brought our check over. This place has really the worst service ever. I actually saw another person there whom I know. This morning, I was talking to him, and he concurred in the idea that the restaurant used to be good. But, he said, it has been radically changed and is now going for the high-turnover model. He wont' go back either. I think a lesson from that is that older reviews should be ignored. Seriously, the food is good, but I've eaten great food in lots of great places, where the service is respectful and good. This place is just horrible.",-0.9232,0.773,0.101,0.126,0.49413580246913585

I was told while making my reservation that I could not reserve window seats, nor could I request them since they are a first come, first serve basis.  Because lets be real...people come here for the view.  I asked when arriving if any window seats would be available shortly, and I was told that they were all reserved for the night.  I was shocked since I called 2 months in advance for a reservation and was told you could not reserve those tables.  So, I was defeated by a crappy policy...fine.  So we were seated behind a massive pillar that obstructed any view, when lo and behold a table opens by the window 5 min after being seated.  I ask if we could move to that table and they say that those have been reserved for the evening. Again, I believe people are paying the maitre d's for the tables which is insane.  Never coming back for overpriced food with the empty promise of a ""view"".  I can get a much better dinner with better atmosphere at Rainforest Cafe.",0.8886,0.841,0.101,0.057,0.5340579710144927

2013-02-03,3.0,"It was our first & likely last visit to NoMi Kitchen. We went for Restaurant Week hoping to find some good value instead we found an underwhelming menu with small portions and an overly ""casual sophisticated"" ambiance. Perhaps they are trying too hard to be chic. We forgot this is a hotel restaurant so prices are outrageously high and since part spa (the spa smell is overbearing as you exit the elevator) they must feel they have to feed you as if you need to lose 2 pounds before midnight.  The one really weird thing that happened is that the waiter told us that his boss - a young guy who had just poured our wine - was recently voted the most eligible bachelor in some magazine. - WEIRD thing to be telling customers - this is not a pick up bar! The guy was cute yes but he was wearing what he thought was a trendy tight fitting short suit coat - in actuality he looked ridiculous. The coat was so tight that it flared out at the bottom - he looked like a boy who had outgrown his clothes! So the food was good but not great - best choices truffled mac and cheese with a creamy (not gooey sauce and a decent portion given the richness) and roasted mushroom panini. Don't bother with the upcharge options for entrees - even less food for more money! Ordered the upcharge Smoked Shirmp with shaved fennel (3 slices), roasted oyster mushrooms (3 pieces) and barley - about 3 or 4 tablespoons. It was tasty but left me hungry. Desserts were not exciting - a ""cookie box"" - was not served in a cute box as one imagined but on an ugly brown glass plate - with 4 items. The chewy sugar cookie was the star, raspberry mini muffin which was very good, a weird overly dense divinity piece and then a French macaron -  filled with a cream made with rancid fat - gross! The other no-upcharge dessert choice was a bland sounding White Fromage Cake with butterscoth sauce. They brought it by accident and it looked so trendy in a small mason jar - figures!

Maybe the problem was that our meal was for lunch but the service was off and the food wasn't tasty. I didn't think it was all that great and I wouldn't give it another try. To start things off, when we arrived for our reservation the hostess became flustered by a woman who charged into the restaurant without leaving her name at the desk, so the hostess ran after her. Matt and I remained patiently waiting for her to return. A couple minutes later she returned and took our coats, but already the feeling of quiet chaos was starting to settle in. Now the hostess remained behind the desk as she motioned that we could seat ourselves inside the lounge. The lounge, as we latter learned is not the first room. The first room in the restaurant is a cellar with a large table and chairs where a chef was interviewing a woman. We didn't immediately gather this because we weren't trying to listen in on their conversation. We sat waiting and discussing there for a couple minutes before the hostess came in to effectively shoe us further along into the 'right' room which was the lounge just beyond. From our original position at the entrance, the lounge looked like the restaurant and was the only reason we thought a dark wine cellar room was their ""lounge"".  Once in the lounge we waited again until a maître d' arrived and guided us to our table in the restaurant. It was such a ridiculous experience that could have been avoided by simply not admitting us into the restaurant until ready OR depositing us into the waiting area like a guest would deserve. As for the rest of the restaurant, it is beautiful. The view over the square and a couple blocks of the Magnificent Mile is nice.  Our waitor was great. I wasn't however impressed with the food. I ordered the signature sushi plate and my husband had the muffaletta sandwich. My sashimi was ordinary and I wouldn't order the accompanying sushi roll again - at least not for $28.

2012-11-28,5.0,"Outstanding!!!! Lunch & Dinner This is a great place for a romantic dinner or a corporate lunch if you really want to impress your client. The first time I was here - we brought our beloved friend who visited from Toronto, a hopeless foodie, who looks forward to getting spoiled with Chi dinning options. We always look for interesting places to take her to and I am thrilled we picked this place! She was very impressed and so were 4 other people at the table. So I chose this place for a lunch with one of our most important clients a few months later and again I was thrilled with my choice!  ATMOSPHERE & SERVICE Aside from a very interesting menue and fantastic wine list they have a gorgeous space with outstanding views. You walk through a their grand wine cellar into to the beautiful dinning room and bar. The interior is contemporary with luxury accents like marble and dark wood. As soon as you walk in, from the hostess to buss boy - your service is no different then at Tru. The wait staff knows about all the ingrédients and origin of the dishes, well versed in wine and supper accommodating. As I am adding a photo - I must mention the celebrity factor. When visiting with our client we ran into George Lucas who agreed to take a picture with my colleague!   FOOD & WINE  Let's start with outstanding presentation. Wether it is lunch or dinner, everything arrives flawlessly plated. Sometimes chefs over do it and you can no longer recognize the food on your plate... not here! In pure elegance the dishes still showcase the actual food items, encouraging you to dig in!  I had Niçoise (seared tuna salad) for LUNCH it came with deviled eggs and slow roasted tomatoes - which was absolutely outstanding. My colleague had a burger that impressed him very much and our clients ordered a variety of sushi rolls and absolutely loved it. It was great that their ""by the glass"" wine selection was interesting enough that we were all able to pair a nice grass of wine with our lunch entree. Places that only serve their best wine by the bottle, leave you very little choices for lunch (as you are stil in the work mode... ), I was happy this wasn't the case here! At DINNER we all shared small plates and a few entrees there were so many great choices! We were especially impressed with Marinated Hamachi and Madaj Ceviche. They had exotic oysters (3 différant  kinds), very interesting presentation of market fish (I cant recall which one... sorry) and delicious version of pouched pear salad! The waiter brought us some wine samples to taste and make sure that our wine selection was just perfect.  At the end of your meal they offer great espresso, variety of deserts and an impressive list of after dinner drinks & delicious desert wine Fabulous!",0.9991,0.732,0.248,0.02,0.6758429118773946
2012-11-23,5.0,"Had Thanksgiving brunch here yesterday and it was incredible! To put things into perspective, a brunch for 2 that comes to $320 (with tip) has to be phenomenal to earn 5 stars and it was. Out server's name was Gabriel and he was great! He managed to keep our drinks filled, questions answered and brunch going nicely while smiling all the while. Although he wasn't intrusive, he was never far away either and that's what it's all about. The brunch, itself, was phenomenal. The cracked crab claws were worthy enough to be served at Joe's Stone Crab and a similar chilled mustard sauce to Joe's own was available as well. Tasty, fresh-made sushi rolls and sashimi were both available as were high quality, steamed and chilled shrimp. The charcuterie and cheese selections were tasty. The charcuterie was sliced extra thin and all the meats were of a melt in your mouth texture. My favorite charcuterie in the downtown area has been Zed 451 but NoMI has them beat easily. There were full breakfast, fruit and dessert options on the buffet as well. But the best part of the brunch had to be the entrees to order. My date had a delicious and creamy squash risotto and I had the skate wing AND the crispy chicken thigh (2 entrees, sue me!) Gabriel put it best when he took both empty plates from me by simply saying 'So these were good...' with a smile. Yes, yes they were! Looks like I'll be back for Christmas!

This restaurant reminded me of the Blue Duck Tavern in Washington, DC, and for good reason: they're both super-upscale big-city hotel-related restaurants that are run by Hyatt.  The overall concept is the same: get a killer location and build out a gorgeous dining room with open kitchens and local-and-sustainable ingredients.  Train the staff impeccably and watch the cash roll in.",0.9674,0.795,0.164,0.04,0.5753401360544218
2012-10-18,3.0,"I was severely unimpressed with our experience. The company was amazing of course - my three favorite people to share a nice meal - and the dining room space is one of the most interesting in the city hands down. The word 'Kitchen' in the name makes perfect sense because you are literally eating next to an open and working kitchen, and a beautiful one at that. If you're sitting on the edge and drop your napkin it's very likely in the kitchen. Other other amazing aspect of the space is the location. Right on Michigan Ave with great views of the skyline, lake and water tower. The service was also top notch and representative of a high quality establishment.  My main criticism is that the food was fine and nice, but not amazing and definitely not worth the price. The menu changes frequently and it's been so long that I can't give detailed descriptions of each dish, but I think everyone would agree that the bread stole the show. Hot out of the oven and served on a small cutting board with some amazing butter. We had to start with some sushi just because it was on the menu. That too might have been a highlight, nice rolls, with very fresh fish. The pasta, risotto, asparagus and green beans were good but not great. I remember the asparagus was very nice with the burrata.  NoMI delivers an exquisite visual dining room with top notch service. We had nice celebratory meal but I find it hard to justify the price based on the flavors of the food. There is too much competition at the 'Michelin Star' level as well as delicious values in this town that I could not recommend going back (at least on my dime - I could see corporate clients enjoying the experience).",0.9964,0.719,0.23,0.051,0.607225599459642

I enjoyed the atmosphere of this place, however there were a few things that knocked this place a few stars down.  Food: Oysters  (4.5) - For the evening they had choice of either West Cost or East Cost - forgot what type of oysters, but we went with the East Coast, and delish! They were so fresh, clean, and subtle. Uni Avocado Toast (2.5) - Nothing wrong with this appetizer, but I think it is a bit misleading. If you are going to name something Uni Avocado, I would expect the focus of the appetizer should be the Uni with Avocado.. however this was not the case. It was stacked with ham with was very salty and overpowered the taste of the Uni. Definitely not worth a try, or at least don't expect it to have anything to do with Uni. It doesn't even add any value to the appetizer except an extra $!  Honey Glazed Duck (4) - Yummy, this was seared perfectly! The corn on the side went extremely well with the duck, the mushrooms not so much. I think they mushrooms were way too sweet, but just ignore them and you can enjoy your dish. American Wagyu Hanger Steak (3) - Ordered this Medium Rare, it was just okay... they had some sort of green sauce on it. It tasted very ""green"", didn't think it meshed well with the stead.  Service (2) - The hostess was very nice! She greeted us, was very friendly, and helped us with the Valet...The busboys were always gracious, but the waitstaff not so much. Our main server was a bit snooty. It made the dining experience less enjoyable. There was also a female server that helped our server out, and again, very snobbish.

There certainly are better places in the city, but the selections here are definately high quality.    Wine: 3 stars- I was not all that impressed with the wine list, especially after they hyped it up so much - but the selections they did have were pretty good compliments to their meals.  If a restaurant is going to place so much emphasis on their wine list, they better blow-me-away with quality and selection.  Nothing here that you cannot get at Binnys.  Service: 3 stars-  My only complaint was that although the waiter was very attentive, he kept trying to sell us more - so much so that it became annoying and took away from the overall experience.

The food is pretty good.  I know they recently went to become more casual and less fine dining, which is good for me in terms of repeatability.  the prices are still not cheap however.  Ive had the burger and the fried chicken for sunday brunch so far.  The burger is very good, however, a bit salty.  they really try to pack so much in that burger (including lots of bacon) that it can be a bit salty for most, however, still very tasty, and the meat quality is outstanding. the fried chicken was very good too.  came with a large biscuit and lots of tasty gravy.   the thing i always get here tho, is the coffee.  call me a nut, but this coffee here is so good.  they say they use intellegensia, but its how its brewed that makes the difference.  its bold and strong, but still smooth and not bitter.  almost looks like an americano.  it even has that little crema on top.  just awesome.  Im also a big fan of bowtruss coffee, but this one also are my go tos for a solid cup of coffee.

Second, I have one big negative that really ruins the dining experience:  the Staff and truly awful service.  Believe me, there is plenty of staff running around in suits with headsets on or the staff in the checked shirts.   But what are they doing????  Definitely not greeting guests (beginning with the 2 hostesses), next you are seated and no one even comes for a drink order after 10-15 minutes until you flag down one of the many suits.   Then the food part....once you do get a menu, it's a very long wait (20-30 minutes) until someone comes back to take your order.  Then your food (sushi) can take 45 minutes delivered by another person.   When we asked for additional wasabi, 10 minute wait and delivered by another person.  By the time we flagged down another person for a water refill, he picked up our glasses by the rim (ugh!). Just chaos and disorganization...frustrating when you think what a Park Hyatt quality should be.   If I'd only been here once or once in awhile, I would not have written this review.  But as I like the atmosphere and convenience I'd like to come back.  This review is based on 4 consective Friday evenings over the past month and all of the above was consistent all 4 weeks (except portions varied) Ok, you have good sushi Nomi...but can you do some retraining and care about your locals?  I realize you get much business from tourists/hotel guests but we see plenty of locals there too.

We started with the NoMi signature sushi and sashimi which was fresh and perfect for the hot summer day.  I only wish they gave one each of the yellowtail and salmon so both of us had a piece.  The netlle soup was rich but a tad on the salty side (and I love salt so that was surprising).  Hubby loved the iberico ham with the grilled bread.  For the main course he had the NoMi kitchen risotto.  I had the hand cut black pepper linguini.  Both dishes were colorful and delicious.  The turnaround time between dishes was very fast.  For dessert, we tried the cocoa nib eclair.  By that time we were stuffed, but it had the perfect balance of the creaminess and warmth of the eclair with the refreshing, palate-cleansing cacao-honey sorbet.

2012-04-08,4.0,"Okay, I was wrong. It is possible to find an exceptional restaurant in a chain hotel. The Grand Hyatt in Chicago is home to Nomi. NoMI means damn good food in Urchak.       As soon as the elevator doors open, it's impressive. Stylish, but not trendy decor. Not one, but two people to greet you. To get to the dining room you pass through an impressive wine ""cellar"" the bar, that I would recommend to anyone and finally to your table where in all but a few spots you have a view of the historic Water Tower district on Michigan Avenue. As soon as we sat down, our waiter was at our table to do nothing more than say hello.       The wine list and menus are bound in soft leather. I'm not sure if anyone cares but me, but the menus had been cleaned. The wine list is one of the most impressive in Chicago and the chef listed five of his favorites, one of which was less than $50 and another selection under $70. Seriously, when have you ever seen that when the mean price for a bottle of red is about $180. Appetizer list was impressive, but the most expensive part of the menu running about $20 each.       We split the baked cheese. About that time, they bring out the bread, three rounded rolls that came straight from the oven. Bread is my favorite food other than butter. I can only think of one other place that had comparable bread. My fiance had freshly cut pasta in a cream sauce with an egg on top. I had the skate. She loved hers. Mine was excellent. Perfectly cooked.       Regarding the menu. The number of selections is perfect, probably 18 in all. The kitchen is an open one directly behind the diners. I found myself looking back there watching pros strip rhubarb, cut steak and cook like crazy.       The service was professional, but not overbearing. The waiters didn't attempt to entertain, but clearly found some kind of joy in their work. I have never underestimated the importance of busboys (there's got to be a better job title). We had two. We were never asked if we were through eating because they kept an eye on us and already knew. Water, bread, clean table without ever having felt imposed upon.       For desert I had a beignet with smoked banana sorbet, carmelized bananas and a sauce I wish I knew how to describe. Awesome?       One cocktail, two glasses of excellent wine, two fine entrees, my desert, a great staff in a beautiful restaurant with view and a chef that doesn't need a head shot and biography at the front of the menu all for $160 including a 20 percent tip.       So it's true, it's possible to have a fine restaurant in a chain hotel. Would I encourage you to go there? Absolutely, if you don't like it, I'll come up there myself and pay for your meal. If I had a reputation (I don't), I'd bet it on NoMI       Finally, a tip for times.

2012-03-19,2.0,"NoMI was the random restaurant pick for gf and my 3rd anniversary... I'm sure people look at what stars a reviewer gives first so you can automatically assume by now that I was not impressed. With the closing of the restaurant where we first had dinner together, we had to pick a new place to dine. I don't care to keep trying new places for a really special dinner as I would rather go somewhere I know will be good. Anyways, the gf wanted to go with a random restaurant (I made a list of three restaurants and she picked randomly.) After reading all the reviews from people I trust, NoMI was really just put in the list as I needed to have 3 restaurants to choose from. The whole idea of NoMI was promising despite the reviews when I was called to confirm my reservations the day before and was told that they can't promise me a window seat, but they would be able to more than likely make it work considering we were willing to wait. Anyways, we got there on time... Nice decor. Beautiful restaurant really... Asked about the window seating and was told they've all been committed for the night. Funny, I was told that those tables were based on first come first serve. We were not given a window table and did not get to see part of why this place gets the higher marks on some reviews. Really didn't appreciate being told two different stories. Also, did not like the fact that two tables were actually open by the window when we arrived. Service: Very good at first as the server was very pleasant, but then it became lacking pretty quickly. Would have turned forgotten about the long wait between taking our orders, but compounded with lack of refilling water, lack of really checking in on us, etc. all pleasantries were more than negated. Food: For starters, we had the poke and the pulled mozzarella. Poke was okay... I wouldn't care about the smaller portions if the taste was there which it wasn't. Mozarella was good though. For our entrees gf got the prime filet while I got the skate. The filet was very good. That was probably the most enjoyable dish there. The skate was pretty good, but I didn't like the preparation with the cream, cheese, and mustard. It was just too heavy for the skate. Gf also ordered a side of mushrooms so she could eat it with her steak. Dessert was a chocolate nib eclair or something to that effect. Good dark chocolate ice cream, but the eclair itself just wasn't that great. Overall, I think I had much higher hopes for this place and NoMI fell short. Food was between good and okay. There just weren't enough standouts (only one dish I really liked.) Service was lacking. What am I paying for then when we didn't even get the nice view?

We were lucky enough to be seated by the window where it would be hard to find a better spot to soak in a great view of the Water Tower especially when it is lit up at night.  Sure you could be dining at the Signature Room in the Hancock Tower, but this is a much more intimate and urban atmosphere.  The interior is simply decorated and modern - the open kitchen with the marble countertops is absolutely a pleasure to take in as you are led to your table. The chefs at NoMi definitely know how to make a good meal.  Our favorite appetizer was the gnocchi with the wild boar ragout.  The ragout was extremely flavorful and paired well with the fluffiest sets of gnocchi these two lips encountered.  The pulled burrata was just ok on the other hand.  It was difficult to eat given its half melted consistency and it reminded us of Mexican queso fundido.  For the entrees, our sea bass was good, but the stellar dish was the risotto.  Rich, flavorful - this risotto is unlike any I've tasted and would work well with a nice meaty red wine to counterbalance all the flavor.  Our desserts were equally a hit.  We loved the trio of sorbets/ice creams and the tapioca dessert with olive oil vanilla bean ice cream.  Delicious.  It's clear that the guys at NoMi have some great creative vision when it comes to their dishes.

2012-03-01,3.0,"It was a special occasion so we wanted to go somewhere fancy for once. After reading numerous reviews online, we finally decided to go to the NoMI Kitchen. I was so excited about the view that people were raving about and of course, the food!  After the experience, I will say it was ""meh"".  At first, the host gave us a little attitude. She was on the phone, and she was like ""what?"" in her face expression to me. Yes, we weren't dressed in super designer fancy clothes, but I think we were good enough to be treated with respect from the beginning to the end. I think she wasn't expecting us to dine there either. Other than the host, other service was fine. Wait staff were great, and they frequently checked on us. So I would say the service was 4 stars.  The view was good. We were lucky to get the window seating despite of the host's attitude. You can see the whole Water Tower building. If I were to go again though, I would rather go to the Signature Room for the view because the view from Nomi was good, not amazing. The 7th floor view is not that exciting as you think it would be. So I would say the view was 3 stars.  Now, the problem was the food. We knew it was going to expensive, but we didn't mind because it was our special occasion. We were so looking forward to food because of such positive reviews from other Yelpers, and they received Michelin star. However, the food was just too salty. We had black forest soup, tuna poke, pasta, and market fish. Except the pasta, everything else was just too salty. We were able to exchange the market fish plate for a new one, but only the top fish was new while the bottom fish and side dishes were kept the same from the previous dish. I really appreciated that they were really nice about it though. The manager even checked up on us and apologized. However, the food... We came here for food!!! The black forest soup was also too salty. It would've been a great soup if it wasn't salty. When we were leaving, the person I went with said, ""Even Cheesecake Factory's food is not salty like this!"" Last fallout that I need to mention is about the tuna. Tuna poke is like a sashimi plate with some toppings on fish pieces. I'm a sushi lover so I know my fish. However, judging from the quality of the tuna, I'm really disappointed. I have seen a better tuna sashimi from a small unknown sushi restaurant. I wouldn't recommend it. Since I don't want to end with a super sour note, I have to say the pasta was good. It had cherry tomatoes, spinach, and olives. It wasn't salty at all. I wish there was some kind of protein like chicken though. Because the person I went with had such a bad time with the food, I have to say the food was 2 stars.  Would I come back? Maybe... IF I have a business meeting. Would I come back here to celebrate a special occasion? No. It wasn't worth the price.",0.9968,0.775,0.166,0.059,0.5275565629339216

I understand this is discounted, but I would have liked some protein (really, how much do eggs cost at wholesale?). I choose the salad, pasta, and assorted cookies. The salad was amazing; refreshing, light, and not drowning in dressing (unlike most of the places I frequently dine at). The apple addition in the salad threw in a twist which I appreciated. The pasta with oil and olives was a bit heavy, and I felt it could have benefited from a twist. It tasted very generic to me. The dessert was nothing special.

SINGLE. DISH.  From kusshi oysters, inventive salads, foie gras, muliple seafood and red meat selections to a wide array of fresh sushi, it was as if the Chef took my Christmas list of gastronomical wet dreams and brought them all to life at once.

Yes, our server did hear my order for ""lobster"" as ""linguini"" and ended up comp'ing my final entree, but we would have gladly paid twice as much for the quality of food at NoMI kitchen.  The Madai carpaccio was amazingly fresh and a perfect combination of sweet, spicy vinegary, and savory all at once - absolutely delicious.

They ended up sending a glass of complimentary champagne to each of us at our  table, which was worthless since I don't really drink champagne.  The food was decent, and the waiter was kind, but the prices were very high and the experience with the hostess really put a black mark on the whole meal.  I would've liked to order dessert, but we didn't have time after the half hour wait at the beginning of the night.  We picked up blizzards on the way home instead.

2012-01-23,5.0,"We've been coming to NoMi for years whether to celebrate special occasions, for a drink in the lounge, or for a nice dinner out and have always been extremely impressed.  This past weekend was our first time there since the switch to NoMi kitchen - we were there to celebrate our anniversary (got engaged here as well) and also to have an awesome night out ""just the two of us"" prior to our son being born in the next month or so! :) We always have high expectations when coming here and I think it's fair to say that although the changes to the space are fairly minimal, they somehow managed to make everything even better. We were seated in one of the great window tables and our server Patrick (who we also had four years prior on the night I proposed) was once again at our table... I think the new, more relaxed vibe in the dining room really lets the servers personalities shine. Patrick was always great; but he definitely seemed to be having more fun than what was likely ""ok"" in the past. We asked for some recommendations and EVERYTHING was spot on. We started out with ""From the Cave"" which was an amazing plate of artisanal cured meats and cheeses. We often order similar plates in other restaurants but I can't remember ever polishing off the whole spread. Fantastic. Amy went with the Prime NY Strip and I had the Pork Porterhouse - both were flavored and cooked to absolute perfection. We split the potato puree with garlic as a side and it complimented our entrees perfectly. We topped the meal off with the decadent eclair dessert (I don't even remember all of the components as it was gone in 60 seconds) They also mixed a perfect Manhattan of which I had another in the lounge to relax after the meal. The lounge itself has always been one of my favorite spots in Chicago. There's something unexpected about it since it's a very well heeled crowd, not all tourists (like many other hotel bars) and the music is some pretty great ""louse"" (loungey-house) which makes the vibe in there perfect. Overall, I really can't say enough about NoMi kitchen and look forward to going back soon!!!",0.9983,0.784,0.216,0.0,0.5662892904197251
2012-01-22,5.0,"If only I could have brunch at NoMI every Sunday.  Seriously.  It's fantastic.  I'd been once before the remodel and it was wonderful so I was hoping the food hadn't changed with the interior.  It hadn't. One thing to know before brunching at NoMI is that one needs a good 2 hours to do it correctly.  I mean, you could do it in less time, but who would want to?  There is such a gorgeous variety of foods to taste that multiple courses are in order: like five...at least.     First stop: seafood bar.  Raw oysters, sushi, crab & shrimp cocktail!  Oh my!   Perhaps even better than that, for me anyway, is the next table: loaded with charcuterie, cheese, olives and accompaniments.  I mean, is there anything better than prosciutto and fresh figs?  Or a strong blue, marcona almonds and cherry compote?  The charred bread alone was enough to make me sigh.  So simple, so perfect.   I have to say, even though the salad spread looked lovely, I didn't give it much attention.  The couscous, almond, goat cheese, apricot mix was delicious, as was the light vinaigrette drizzle over some beautiful mixed greens.  I skipped the EVOO poached salmon and farro and the duck breast though both were approved by the second taster at the table.   Then there was a hot line filled with ""brunch-y"" items: bacon and sausage, scrambled eggs, etc.  The winner for me was the savory bread pudding with smoky sausage, arugula and cheese.  Yeah, mama!  It was fab!  I could have easily hit it up for seconds.  Soft, toasty, egg-y, smoky, cheese-y...mmmm...  The caramelized apple cake would have probably felt more comfortable over on the dessert table with the rest of his sweet friends but he somehow ended up here.  Delicious, but I was afraid my teeth would fall out if I took another bite.   Then our ""entrée"" arrived that we'd selected from the menu when we first sat down.  They were both good but not nearly as entertaining as the spread from which we'd been picking for the last hour.  The bacon and arugula benny with mustard hollandaise was a bit rich for me.  One bite was enough.  Very properly prepared, however, it was still too much. Soft scrambled eggs with raw shaved asparagus and truffle oil was nice but we didn't clean that plate either.   Then there was dessert!  Ummm... Ok.  What was a person supposed to do when faced with 10 mini desserts AND a gigantic cinnamon roll?!  One of each was the only logical answer.   Here's what we had to taste:  lemon curd parfait (yum!), chocolate ganache tart, lemon angel food cake with blueberry compote, white chocolate croissant ""bread"" pudding, sweet cream cheese filled pastry, and the most glorious, massive cinnamon roll on the planet (which we nearly devoured).   Hell'uv'a Sunday brunch buffet, I'd say! This may go without saying but the service was great.  We never wanted for anything and they even offered to take our picture. The space has just been remodeled to a more modern feel.  The white tablecloths and Venetian glass chandeliers are no more.  It's a different kind of elegance now: a more hip one.  Still lovely. Overall:  Recommend!  Recommend!   The Short Version (Out of 10)... Food:  9 Service:  9 Ambiance:  10 (excellent view!) Overall impression:  9.5 Would I go back? Yes!  I highly recommend brunch and I've heard the new simplified dinner menu is right on, too!  Can't wait to give that a go.",0.9993,0.748,0.229,0.023,0.5416138010138007

2012-01-14,5.0,"Brunch, a time honored tradition and now weekly food adventure has recently seen its popularity soar to new heights over the past few years. I certainly can't remember brunching with friends growing up and even when I came back for the summers during college there was no brunch scene. The past two years have revealed brunch to be one of my favorite meals and a popular weekly reason to meet up with friends and try new food. NoMI Kitchen, located on the 7th floor of the Park Hyatt by Water Tower is my choice as the 2011 Brunch of the Year. Good brunches usually demand long lines and crowded venues but you won't find any on your way up to NoMI. Head into the Park Hyatt and NoMI Kitchen has its very own elevator up to the 7th floor. The hostesses will gladly take your coat and there is some seating if you have to wait for some late company. Once my friend, the game was on! We were lead through the restaurant - passing by tables of people, seats by the bar, and were given a spectacular window view of the Mag Mile. My friend proudly informed me that for the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival people reserve a spot so they can watch the parade all day. The view was great, the leather seats comfy, and the food was for the taking! After running through various buffet lines I came back with some crab claw, jumbo shrimp, crisp bacon, fresh maki rolls, some yams, and of course scrambled eggs. There were some nice chopsticks and I was glad to dive through brunch eating everything with my chopsticks, even the scrambled eggs. The bacon was crisp and extra thick while scrambled eggs were fluffy with veggies in them.  Sushi was fresh but could have used a bit of ginger or some soy sauce which I didn't see lying around anywhere. After we jackaled our first brunch plate, we decided to wait for our entree before entering the deep waters. For my main entree I had an order of slow poached scrambled eggs with harissa and rock shrimp. Harissa is not very spicy and tastes a bit like Valentino hot sauce however the eggs were extremely fluffy and there were large chunks of rock shrimp everywhere. After this was devoured I grabbed some mussels, tried more shrimp, and had seconds of most of breakfast. If you wanted I believe there was cereal and oatmeal but who really goes to fancy brunch to have that stuff? NoMI Kitchen is spacious enough where you won't be cramped or accidentally eavesdrop into some awkward conversation. The coffee served up woke me up and the service was pretty good except for the girl who gave us a wine list instead of a brunch cocktail menu. Leyla ordered a bellini with pureed peaches or something fancy and it was tasty. If you're a fan of dessert, you'll go gaga over NoMI's outstanding dazzling array of sweets, pastries, cakes, and chocolate. Walking through NoMI's buffets, it's like being at home with much better food and there's plenty of space and no one to bump into. The mousse with butterscotch was a smash hit as well as chocolates with gold flakes on them. You really could spend an entire afternoon munching on dessert alone. If you're really into brunch you've really got to make your reservation and lounge out a few hours at Chicago's best brunch.",0.9984,0.813,0.168,0.02,0.5160951621477937

Chef Ryan and the team create delicious, surprising flavor combinations for all meals (even breakfast, which is amazing) in a cozy but elegant environment....and offer the (much needed at times) super speedy room service for those sleepy or work-induced mornings and evenings.

The restaurant itself is clean and classic.  And yes, the view from the 7th floor of the Park Hyatt is phenomenal. By the time we sat down we were all starving.  We ordered a tiger roll to start with (tempura shrimp, crab, and tuna) which didn't take us more than 10 minutes to eat.  It was so perfectly fresh that we couldn't help but shove it down.  For lunch, I split their infamous ""800"" burger and hand-cut french fries with the birthday girl and was glad that I did.  The massive burger is made of American Kobe beef with nueske's bacon, Comte cheese, watercress pickled shallot, and smoked tomato aïoli on a rosemary ciabatta.  Perfection (made medium rare).  I also cleaned the plate of my friend who ordered the steak salad with horseradish dressing.  In fact, I almost licked the plate clean. I would definitely go back for lunch even though it's a little expensive.  But the whole experience - ambiance, service, people watching, view of the city, and the quality of the food - was definitely worth the extra money.",0.9918,0.796,0.167,0.036,0.5457854406130268

2011-10-24,4.0,"Visited NoMI Kitchen for a work dinner on short notice with a group of out of town team members.  The first thing they said was that they loved the view, and I have to admit - it is fantastic!  Atmosphere is a 5. We were seated in the dining room - not directly in front of the windows, but instead a bit back (though, the view from anywhere in the restaurant is great).  Our server was very professional and friendly.  Service was a bit drawn out in that this isn't a fast place to eat, but we ate at a good pace.  A 5 for service. The food is delicious, but the portions are small for some items (appetizers for example) and the sides aren't included.  This isn't an issue for some, but I don't have a huge appetite, so it's hard to figure out what to order.  Everything was very beautifully prepared and of high quality.  Food was a 5. So...on to value.  I really had been wanting to eat at NoMI Kitchen as I had been to NoMI and loved it, but couldn't visit enough due to the price point.  I thought, after reading many reviews, that the spot might be a bit more approachable for those who don't want to have a multi-hour meal.  I will say that the food prices are in-line with downtown prices, though, for the portion size on some dishes...I don't think the value is there.  For example, I think the price of a steak is ok - especially for the quality.  However, the meat appetizer...at $19 or so, is quite pricey for the size.  The quality is there, but this isn't a shareable dish.  Also, the sushi, while huge pieces...is good, but also, quite pricey.  Also, the wine list might be almost unapproachable for some due to the cost.  All in all, we spent a lot of money on dinner and it was definitely enjoyed, but I think that the value isn't consistent.  A 3 for value. The bathrooms...are outside of the restaurant and down the hall.  I realize this is because they have a few spots all together (the rooftop garden, restaurant, bar, etc), but that was a bit annoying.  It was a nice bathroom, very clean, but in an annoying location.  A 3 for bathrooms.",0.9954,0.795,0.167,0.038,0.5564181286549706

2011-10-04,4.0,"Damn you no half stars!  This is really a 4.5 review.  I've been wanting to go to NoMI for quite some time and was happy to finally have the opportunity.  I went for a business dinner, which it is a good spot for, although I can definitely see it being the type of space that is good for business, dates, or a group.  I love the decor.  The lounge is quite big and I hope to return there just for a night of drinks and apps.  But the restaurant is all the way in the back.  The entire place is on the 7th floor so you have a city view, but the interior is dark wood paneling and cool cut outs that are filled with wine glasses and such.  It's modern looking but still has a warm feel to it.  We had 12 people and not all arrived at once, although they sat us as we arrived, which I definitely appreciated.  We sat right in front of the kitchen, which I thought was really cool.  The service was great.  Wine kept flowing, very good menu explanations, and food came pretty promptly.   Now onto the food.  First of all I'm very surprised to see people on here complaining about the prices.  Have you never been to a Michelin star restaurant?  The reason I picked this place is because we were paying for dinner (as opposed to getting taken out as the client, when I spare no expense) so my boss said somewhere reasonable.  When I saw the menu prices I was pleasantly surprised.  When side by side with comparable restaurants, NoMI is actually very reasonably priced.  That being said, I completely don't mind paying for great food, but I thought the prices were one of the things that will get me to go back.  The menu is structured with apps, salads, and soups but then they have a page of mains, which are meant to eat alone and come with sides and simply prepared which are served a la carte and recommended with family style sides.  My only complaint is the menu is not very large.  There were not a whole lot of options.  What was there was good though.  The fish of the day was sturgeon, so I was all over it.  The tomato puree it came on was uber tasty and the sturgeon itself was very good.  Oh, I forgot the piping hot rolls that have some herb in them.  YUM!  My boss got the lobster salad for an app, which was the only thing he said he didn't love because there wasn't too much lobster present.  The pork he got he very much enjoyed though.  We had some truffle fries and cheesy grits for the table.  Truffle fries were so great!  You know how when places market truffle fries except really it's just fries with no indication of truffle (I'm looking at you Rockit)?  This is not that.  Truffle very prevalent.  The cheesy grits sound as though they'd be cheap tasting to me for some reason, but they totally weren't.  That may have been my favorite thing all night.  Luscious and smooth with cheese flavor that was there but in an upscale way and not overpowering.   Everyone at the table afterward said they really enjoyed it so I figured if 12 people all shared the same good experience, that's a plus!  I have to say, the bathrooms were uber swanky and I totally dug them.  So why not 5 stars you ask?  If you read my reviews you know that I judge everything based on what they're trying to achieve and against their competitors.  When I give Tru and Blackbird 5 stars, and those are what I'm measuring NoMI against, I can't quite put them on the same bar.  But NoMI isn't far behind.  You can get an elegant Michelin star experience without paying a typical Michelin star price.",0.9983,0.818,0.155,0.027,0.5783734519448804

Things that annoyed me: 1.)  ""Grab a drink in the lounge"" - Ok, so reservations were for 8:30, we showed up at 8:25 and the receptionist says, ""you're a bit early, please sit down in the lounge grab a drink and we'll seat your when you're table is ready.""  It was almost PERFECTLY timed as we wrapped up our 15/ea cocktails - whatever, I get it just annoying when it is so blatant that it is just a calculated routine. 2.)  Window Treatment:  There is only 1 spot you want to sit in this restaurant and that is in one of the 5 or 6 ""window"" tables.  It was my fiancé's birthday and I had requested a window seat.  They said ""we have that noted and will do our best to accommodate"" when I made the reservation.  Then on the confirmation call I reminded them and they said we will be able to make that happen.  When we showed up, no such luck.  We sat in the main dining room which is no more elegant than the lobby of the park hyatt, just A-OK - nothing more. 3.)  Waiter - He was kind of weak sauce.  My fiance and I were in some good conversations, but that doesn't mean that I don't want him to interject and do his job properly, it was like I was trying to keep him up to speed with us, ordering the next course, asking him questions about the menu rather than having anything explained to us, ie. what the market fish of the day was, or how the trout was prepared... Things that were good: 1.)  Oysters were pretty good 2.)  Artichoke soup w/ parmesan crostini was good 3.)  Meat/Cheese plate was weak 4.)  Lobster was phenomenal 5.)  Trout was pretty weak - more like a smoked chub 7.)  Apple Tart was pretty good So all in all, it was ok.  If you're thinking you'll be blown away you can save your money and head to something less touristy. Out the door we were $310 dollars including a bottle of Cakebread, a couple cocktails, appetizer, soup, meat/cheese, entree, desert. Thanks guys,  Joe",0.9963,0.739,0.201,0.06,0.5684854497354499

You can't help but like it despite the ridiculous prices (but hey, it's located in a hotel...what can you do?) and some of the ridiculous people (sugar daddy, anyone?). The gist - overpriced and a little kitschy, yet the drinks are good, and so is the people watching. Our server was a doll. Had some drinks and a $36 cheese plate (WHERE'S THE CHEESE?). Server could definitely relay preferences to bartender, and bartender CAN follow directions. We got there at the right time. Later the hour, bigger the crowd. Like the outdoor venue. Views into the neighboring condos couldn't be missed if you tried. Overall, a thumbs up.

2011-08-29,4.0,"***NoMI (located in the Park Hyatt hotel) has an expensive breakfast, but it is good and features some high quality ingredients and nice presentations*** NoMI is located on the 7th floor of the Park Hyatt hotel, which overlooks The Magnificent Mile.  The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  For the most part, the restaurant's breakfast decor is very much a hotel restaurant and business-friendly decor (I get the feeling that the decor may change a little at dinner--possibly different chairs, not the chairs on rollers like they have at breakfast). The decor is not stuffy or traditional hotel decor you would see in a Four Seasons restaurant or something like that; instead, it is more contemporary like The Fifth Floor in San Francisco.  The seating is right next to the window, which provides great views of The Magnificent Mile and even Lake Michigan. Their breakfast menu was small, but it featured a lot of nice sounding dishes from frittatas to blue crab omelets.  I started with the eggs Benedict.  It featured the standard poached eggs, hollandaise with a very slight lemon flavor and toasted English muffins, but there were some changes as well.  They utilized aged Benton ham instead of Canadian bacon and also added wilted arugula and Maine lobster. The eggs Benedict was good.  The muffin was fresh and nicely toasted while the eggs were poached with great precision.  The egg whites were cooked all the way through while the egg yolk was appropriately runny and rich.  The hollandaise sauce was not too thick or buttery.  The arugula provided a good green to the otherwise very rich dish while the ham was good (nice and thin and not too salty). The lobster was good as well.  It was a generous enough portion and it was cooked appropriately.  While I have had softer lobster elsewhere, NoMi's fresh lobster was tender enough. I also had the brioche French toast, but it was not as good.  They did not soak the brioche in the batter enough.  The outside was lightly crispy, but the inside of the brioche was too toast-like; it just did not really take on enough of the eggy batter.  Also, the batter was not sweet enough.  The French toast ended up being a little bland. The French toast was topped with some good Michigan blueberries, which helped.  There was also some maple syrup, which also helped.  Still, the French toast itself was too bland and the garnishes could only do so much. Service was good and just what it needed to be for a hotel breakfast--efficient, attentive, and personable.  The hostess was great--welcoming, friendly and professional. Prices were high for breakfast though they were featuring premium ingredients in the eggs Benedict.  They do have some lower cost options on the menu. Compared to The Fifth Floor in San Francisco, the breakfast at NoMI featured better food and was much more in line with the expectations that come with having breakfast in an upscale hotel.  While the brioche French toast was not that great, it was nicely presented and featured good ingredients.  I liked their Maine Lobster Benedict though and I would expect other breakfast items here to be up to the same quality. I am not sure what the parking situation is, but given the highly congested area that surrounds NoMI, I imagine parking is expensive.",0.999,0.79,0.196,0.013,0.5273325087610803

My boyfriend asked for a table by the window since the dining room was not even close to being full but they denied his request saying that those tables are reserved for their ""elite"" customers... whatever.  That started the night off on a sour note.  However the waiter was friendly and did try his best to be helpful,  even bringing cookies at the end that said Happy Birthday on them...  it was too late and we had planned to go get dessert elsewhere.   I just felt that the overall very stuffy tone to the whole thing ruined the evening.  but i guess i should have known.     The food was expensive and just okay.  The sushi was good but $22... lol.  I definitely won't return for the food or the ambience in the dining room.  But I do want to get back to sit outside on the terrace for drinks.  Probably the only saving grace for the place, I wonder what they do in the winter???",0.9882,0.807,0.159,0.034,0.5038720538720538

Very good selection of local fare and product from Green City Market which I am a big fan. The sweet corn soup was spectacular. The rest of the items ordered by our group were very good. The foie gras torchon tasted more like bratwurst though. The veal chop my friend had was outstanding, My wife had the trout  which was also amazing. The snickers tart was the best of all the deserts.  The cons. Even though the dress code is smart casual, there were a few diners wearing shorts, flip flops,and sleeveless t-shirts. We were there for a company dinner so we were all wearing business casual. I would think that a Michigan Avenue restaurant would stick by the dress code at dinner. When they don't, it doesn't make the place as fancy as you'd like when considering your options. My biggest complaint was with my meal. Since we were on the company dime, I ordered the bone in prime rib rib eye. Allegedly a 28oz monster that was for sharing with the table and comes in at a hefty $140 with veggies and potato. They say that if you can finish it, you get a t-shirt. It was cut up so that every one can get a piece. I know the rib eye is the most marbled and the most flavorful BUT each bite had about 40% fat. Some  of the bites had so much gristle that they were inedible. They also offer a side of Bearnaise sauce which is nice but they ladled some kind of sweet sauce on it so that it fought the Bearnaise. I brought this to the waiters attention and they took of $40 but that left a less than mediocre $100 steak dinner. I'll go back since I liked the place itself but I'll stick to the local fare.",0.9851,0.839,0.142,0.019,0.5235714285714286

The menu is good - not overwhelming at all even offering a selection of dishes that are prepared minimally (with few added spices or sauces).  We had the beet salad and sweet corn chowder for appetizers - both were outstanding, especially the chowder.  Our main courses were a Atlantic Cod (prepared with olive oil, salt, pepper) and the Pork Porterhouse (a good portion of pork).  Both dishes were excellent with a bit of a nod to the Cod.  We also ordered a side of the whipped mashed potatoes (they called it something infinitely more fancy in the menu).  These were gummy and not-so-good. For dessert, we had a chocolate pudding with raspberry sauce - excellent and a great sized portion to share after our meal.  To accompany our meal we had wine - their wine list if pretty good here but very expensive.  We settled on a piesporter that complimented our meals just fine.

I enjoy fine dinning and being a foodie, I was looking forward to this experience:)  We wanted to bring a dessert, but they were going to charge us. They were strict on bringing outside food such as a birthday cake, etc. to their establishment as you would have to pay extra per person per plate that was being served, boo on that. So we left it behind and went to the establishment all ""dolled"" up, it was a night out in the city:)  We took an elevator up and was escorted to the waiting area with a nice window view of the city.  We passed through a room that had a huge wine displayed wall to wall and in the middle of the room was a very long table assuming where you would ""wine taste"".  We were then shown to our table and to our surprise they took the 7 of us to a back room of a private dinning area of a long table with a full window view of the old water tower, AMAZING!  Our staff was very accommodating and next to our room, we also had a private like bathroom with displayed art from the walls to the ceiling, again amazing.  There was also an outside deck full of tables and chairs where you can lounge and enjoy the view surrounded by other buildings. I felt like I was on vacation:)  On with the food:for starters we enjoyed the following:  -Seasonal Selection Of Oysters clams, lobster, crab, prawns, mussels, traditional garnish (all on a huge platter of salt rock and ice, sea food was chilled and VERY fresh).  -It's a plus when they served us herb seasoned warm rolls.  -Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar house cut frites, gem lettuce  (It tasted fresh and the sauce of the tartar mixed with the beef tasted like a creamy relish thousand island flavor).  -Spicy Tuna Roll salmon sushi, yellow tail sashimi, shiso daikon salad (Tuna tasted fresh, but not as spicy as I would like).  Before our main course, we were given a spoon with olive oil sorbet to ""cleanse"" our pallet. It was pretty good and you can taste the olive oil.  Some of our main course were:  -Roasted Bone-In Prime Beef Ribeye summer vegetables, potato purée  (It came in a heavy iron pot that feeds two adults but we shared with three people due to the amount of appetizers we had. Meat was VERY tender, vegetables were not over cooked all on top of sliced bread that held the juices of the dish, yummy!).  -Pan Seared Diver Scallops crayfish, anson mills grits, fava beans, grain mustard (Scallops tasted fresh but wanted more, LOL).  -Lake Superior Walleye eggplant ""a la plancha"", roasted sweet pepper jam, honey-lavender vinaigrette (Fish was good with eggplant)  -Roasted TJ's Farm Chicken baby leeks, fingerling potatoes, tarragon jus  -Roasted Asparagus Parmesan reggiano (enough to share)  -Yukon Gold Potato Puree plain, laura chenel goat cheese or roasted garlic (this was VERY creamy and garlicky, great with our beef)  For dessert:  -Rhubarb Soup lemon cream, ginger marshmallow, chervil salad  (This was very refreshing and tasty, I'd get it again).  -BAKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE Fruits of the cacao ice cream, cocoa nibs, warm chocolate sauce (this was VERY rich and chocolaty).

There are a lot of unique ""spaces"" hidden around the restaurant in addition to the main dining room, so there seem to be a lot of different ways to experience NoMI. The menu was very well-chosen: many light options. I was even tempted by the salads, which never happens. My pappardelle was delicious--tomato-shaped bursts of summer, and just enough pecorino to make it very interesting. The rhubarb soup was delightful. So many small components available to be put together, each one fantastic on its own. Combined, they were transcendently good. I guess one could call the menu ""less fussy,"" but I don't have a problem with fussy so the connotation is off. The preparations are simpler and more straightforward--and, yes, in English rather than Kitchen French. But some of the familiar standbys are still there. For example, some of the mignardises that are served at the end of dinner show up on the lunch menu as ""candies and chocolates"" for dessert (*well* worth it, for a light, shareable dessert).  My favorite thing about NoMI, however, is the emphasis on impeccable service. Every time I've gone (twice for business, thrice for pleasure--qv.

We have a waiter, and an assistant, who kept bringing us bread and encouraging us to try all three flavours (for the record, the raisin bread was my fave, and I normally hate raisin bread) Darling husband, love that he is, skims the menu and declares it to be ""all fish"". Which is code for ""oh my god I am going to drop a freaking grand in this joint and then have to go home and eat stale crackers because fish sucks so, so bad"".  Until I smiled sweetly, patted his arm, and directed his attention to this: Burgundy Truffle and Foie Gras Crème Brûlée with Brioche, Caramelized Hazelnuts and Petite Herbs ""WHAT!"" says he. ""Waiter! Rustle us up an order of your finest Brulee, stat!"" OK, he didn't exactly say it like that, I mean we *are* somewhat cultured over here.  For realz, yo. So after we had basically licked the plate clean of foie gras I turn my attention to the entree I ordered, which was a Brittany Turbot with Chanterelle Mushrooms, Rock Shrimp and a Bacon Cider Jus.  Delicious, I tell you. Simply ridiculous.  Darling husband had the special, which was a venison, and none of that went to waste either.

The decor is beautiful. I have no idea why they're closing for a remodeling job. The place is laid out beautifully. At every table you have a beautiful view of the Gold Coast. I was gazing at the Water tower throughout our entire meal.   Our server was about as stoic as they come. He took our order and did a great job making sure our needs were tended to, but other than that, there was very little interaction with us. When he took our order, his blank stare made me feel like I was in the Principal's office with my fly down. I have been to a lot of top notch eatery's including Trotter's and David Burke's. Both of those experiences were quite enjoyable. My experience with our server at Nomi was quite cold and distant.   The food was a totally different story. Everything was top notch. We started out with a decadent little appetizer of creme brulee, fois gras. It was delicious. The meatiness of the Fois gras and the sweetness of the crunchy topping went together perfectly.   For my entree I went with the special of the day. The entree consisted of delicious Venison medallion's that was served with potato's, topped with caramelized onions. It took all my will power not to lick my plate clean. Everything served to us was amazing.   Nomi falls in the Category of places that I'm glad I tried, but I doubt if I will go back.

Sushi - Didn't have it but its a private sushi chef and your disposal and hear this is what they are known for but for brunch?  idk not for me.. Brunch Buffet - Wow this was everything you would expect but much of which had a special twist or was just really amazing (fruit and cheese spreads, AMAZING waffles and french toast, breakfast meats etc), this is worth most of the price alone Entree order - People in our group got the lobster eggs benedict and the market fish which was a piece of swordfish and some shellfish.  Both were right off of food network, prepared and plated perfectly, just wow.  Pastries - This is the true gem of the brunch for me.  You are basically treated to a private pastry chef that will churn out as many tastes of her 10 or so piece assortment as you wish.  Just the attention to detail and intricate flavor combinations here made the entire trip.

The standard by which I judge all bars is their ability to mix a Manhattan - the king of cocktails.  I must say, the Manhattan at NoMI is one of the best I've had.  A well balanced affair with just enough sweetness to balance the bourbon and deepen it's flavor. They've hit the right balance between bourbon, vermouth, and bitters.   The bitters added a whole other layer of flavor - very complimentary and adding to the overall complexity of the drink.  Brandied cherries (big points are lost for typical maraschinos from the jar) rounded it out.  I highly recommend.",0.9735,0.761,0.185,0.054,0.49247795414462076

I was fairly pleased with the entrees - I highly recommend the NoMI benedict, I could have eaten two or three servings of that dish!  I also tried a cavatelli dish that looked intriguing, because it featured garlic and artichokes, two of my favorite tastes. It would have made a fine side-dish to a more substantial entree, but as a standalone selection I found it kind of lacking.

2010-09-20,3.0,"On a rainy fall Saturday, a warm cup of tea with friends is a necessity. The thought of afternoon tea at a swanky restaurant peeked my interest. NoMI is super chic and modern in its decor. How can you not love square espresso tables complemented by a dark bar. It's very French and modern. Most hotel-based tea services are quite the affair. However, NoMI failed to live up to expectations and the bar other hotel teas set.  NoMI's tea service leaves you hungry and wanting more-literally. Our tea menu was limited with about 5 selections of tea, a piece of cake, and a fancy dessert. I really missed the tea sandwiches as I already had consumed my fair share of starch that morning. I needed sustenence to get me through to dinner. The teas are served in Japanese ceramic pots which complement the whole French/Japanese fusion that NoMI prides itself on.  The gateau is the centerpiece of tea service sort of like the scone. We had five topping choices to enjoy our cake with: nutella, orange maramalade (to die for), apricot spread with almonds, and clotted cream/lemon curd emulsion. We had a choice of dessert ranging from chocolate mousse cake to Le Not Guilty with yogurt and granola. The vanilla bean gateau was average and a little too chilled. The spreads were tasty. Out of hunger desperation, some of us did a number of some of jams and lemon curd. The chocolate mousse cake was delicious, but needed some savories to balance out the massive sugar high NoMI gave me. After finishing off our dessert heavy tea, all of us were still hungry for something a little more satisfying. Our service was lackluster at best. Our server didn't seem terribly interested in our needs. We also had to ask for water and cocktails a few times over to get them. It took forever for us to get our check which is normally good, but when you're jonesing for more food elsewhere, not so much. All in all, NoMI's afternoon tea is more equivalent to a fancy pants dessert after a day of shopping on the Mag Mile. I could see how it would appeal to tourists wanting the chic hotel experience. For afternoon tea fans, it lacks those all important tea sandwiches and clotted cream.

A super-tipsy, super-sweaty chick about to pass out from extreme foodjoy as well as heatstroke. I met a good friend here on probably what was the hottest day of the summer and I am happy to say I made it through the 2-hour lunch without feeling like I was going to pass out (at least not until the last 10 minutes). The rooftop was crowded this particular afternoon and the waitstaff was very much on point, even though they appeared to be short-handed and also wearing suits (yikes!) . We started off off with a nice bottle of Gerwurtzraminer as we perused the menu and made our choices: the Gazpacho with cucumber, compressed watermelon and smoked avocado; the BLT Salad with applewood smoked bacon, baby gem and vine ripened tomato; the Heirloom Tomato, Salad; the Farm Fresh Egg with tomato and eggplant marmalade and jamon de mangalica and croutons; and lastly, the Buckwheat Soba Salad with Prawns. EVERYTHING was OMG!!! So savory, mouth-watering and out-of-this-world... and the bottle of champagne was just icing.  I've been to NoMI many times with my girlfriends and we usually sit at the bar and order drinks and sushi.

The bartender was exceptional, calling to mind an era when a cocktail experience inspired both reverence and gratitude in its patrons.  Maybe it's just Chicago that inspires this type of performance; in Seattle, even if the bartenders are skilled at what they do, they are generally surly hipsters who act like they are doing you a massive favor by filling your drink order.  Not so at NoMI.  Our drinks were excellent and served by an individual who seemed to appreciate the art of the cocktail.  Martini, pimm's cupp and dark and stormy all executed with equal competence.  Fan.",0.9774,0.803,0.182,0.015,0.51875

Per my dream, we sat at a table by the big front windows.  Getting a birds eye view of Michigan Avenue from this height was breathtaking.  Watching dusk turn into darkness was an incredible sight...and dare I say, romantic?  (Answer:  Absolutely.) First, our amuse was presented.  It was a strawberry flavored creme fraiche with rhubarb and a black pepper crouton....Ohmygodyum! My companion and I shared the truffled foie gras creme brulee.  I loved the presentation.  It was outstanding with the caramelized hazelnuts and brioche.  Sweet/salty/smooth/crunchy, every texture and flavor possible.  Incredibly rich and very glad we shared it. We both could not resist ordering the turbot.  It was expertly prepared with green and white asparagus, morels, and a lovely bernaise sauce.  Usually bread service isn't worth noting, but we could not get enough of the crusty, piping hot rolls.   The NoMI Bloom cocktail is going to be my new signature drink: sparkling wine, St Germain and hibiscus syrup.  It was pink, bubbly, and sweet.  Just like me. We concluded dinner (or so we thought) with the raspberry dessert, which had a raspberry tuille and foam, pistachio cake, pistachio ice cream and fresh raspberries filled with pistachio cream.  It was light.  Seasonal.  It screamed summer.  Adored it.

The rating would be higher if the prices weren't so astronomical. I expect the quality of the experience to elevate to meet the price point. Then I will happily sign a big tab. For me the Nomi terrace misses the mark.  I had a dark and stormy which was a tad weak and overly sweet. I have had them at the Violet Hour - where they take the art of the cocktail to another level. It has become my bench mark for the dark and stormy. NoMI's doesn't come close. We ordered some sushi which was.. ehhh.. Seemed comparable to the take out sushi I get at Fox & Obel.

CONS: 1) Scallop main entree only had 2 scallops!!!!  Granted, they were big, but serving only TWO scallops on such a large plate just made everything seem meager 2) We ordered sashimi as entrees, but they came out FIRST (before the apps).  That was kind of strange. 3) Slow to bring the food out.  Not sure why we got our sashimi/sushi before the apps.  Also, it seemed like it took forever for them to bring the food out.  The outdoor terrace was full when we were there though, so perhaps the kitchen was overwhelmed?  When we dined indoors (during the winter months), the food came out much quicker, but the place was also less full. 4) We requested 2 highchairs on the phone when we made the reservation, as well as birthday settings for my niece.  But when we showed up, they seemed unaware of these requests.  They were very quick to bring out highchairs, but it was too late to change the settings (I've seen them do balloons before for a child at another table when I was dining previously).",0.9819,0.857,0.119,0.024,0.5473374295954943

Cooked just right and the caviar gave it a delicious hint of something unexpected. The dragon roll was good; i didn't think it was anything you could find at a regular good sushi restaurant.

Maybe if I had the sauce on the side, it would be so bad but the waiter poured it on top. The potato pancakes that came with were a bit salty along the edges as well.

The rest of the table had the foie gras mousse, which they all liked as well. For the main course, most of us had the sushi (um, i think there was tomato in our sushi? we all thought it was tuna, until one observant friend pointed out that it wasn't... very strange). It was alright, I guess. Definitely not the highest quality sushi, but it'll do... Actually, this course made me a little sad, b/c there were 3 pieces of sashimi less than there were last year.

2010-02-28,5.0,"Went to Nomi for lunch during restaurant and we were blown away!  How  this establishment of fine dining put forth such an awesome meal for just $22 is beyond me. I started with the foie gras mousse, which was wonderful.  A very large serving and went spectacularly well with the toast and mango chutney.  We ordered a bottle of Godello, which actually blew me away.  First off Godello is very hard to find since most wine drinkers have never even heard of the grape, and second it is only grown in Spain, and in a very small region too.  Props to Nomi for not only finding this wine, but selecting an outstanding version of if. I love the fruit forward, apple and pear in the wine, very nice acidity, and full body.  Just outstanding. My entree was the mushroom gnocchi with cauliflower two ways. A clever dish, but the cleverness did not come close to the dynamic flavors in this dish.  The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and the mushroom flavors blended well with the cauliflower which had been both pureed and sauteed.  Wonderful dish.   For dessert I selected the macaroons (mint, mango, & red velvet) on recommendation from our server.  They were spectacular!  I can't describe how good these macaroons were, you'll just have to try them yourself on your next visit to Nomi.

I am so glad that I got a chance to have lunch at Nomi during Restaurant Week because now I know that it's worth a return trip. We were greeted nicely and seated near the windows with a fabulous view of the Water Tower and the lake in the background. Our server was professional and attentive. Bread and butter was fantastic, the bread had just come out of the oven and the butter just melted right on top of it. We ordered the butternut squash soup--delicious with a nice, slightly spicy twist. We both had the Cubano panini (roasted pork shoulder, swiss cheese, and pickles)--juicy, tender, and flavorful. It was served with a side (not listed on the menu) of what I think were fried plantains with a dusting of sugar. I was extremely impressed by the quality of the food, it exceeded my expectations. For dessert, I highly recommend ""La Religieuse"" (a creme puff covered in chocolate, caramel, and hazelnut). I did not like ""Le Mac"" (macaron cookies in three different flavors) because it just tasted too sweet and artificially flavored to me.  If you want to know what good service at a restaurant is like, have a meal here. Everything came out from the kitchen like clockwork, bus boys took our empty plates and utensils and new ones were brought out immediately. Service was impeccable. Decor was clean and classy. Everyone was dressed up, I wouldn't wear jeans here. Wonderful spot for lunch or a romantic dinner. I'll have to check out their outdoor patio in the summertime. You can valet at the hotel entrance downstairs and have the restaurant validate your ticket for $14. They have a beautiful outdoor terrace perfect for drinks.

This was my date's favorite restaurant out of all that we've been to so far.  I'm unsure, but still quite enjoyed it. I started with the soup, which was a lovely, creamy dream.  I devoured it, trying to look as graceful as possible.  My entree was the gnocci which was quite flavorful, but a little too deconstructed for my taste.  I ended with the little cakes.  My favorite was the chocolate-cherry one which took me back to Christmas mornings as a kid when Santa would bring us chocolate covered cherries.  The exterior cake was much softer than it looks, so that was a pleasant surprise. The space is well-lit with tons of natural sunlight as well as these really cool blown glass art pieces hanging from the ceiling & strategically placed mirrors. Our server was cordial & seemed to be on the ball. One part that left a bad impression, however, was the attitude of the hostesses at the front.  When we checked our coats, they looked at us like we had three eyes.  Not a great first impression.  Luckily, the rest saved it.",0.9951,0.709,0.258,0.033,0.5921052631578948

Onto the food. My roommate and I both started with the butternut squash soup.  It was delicious!  It had an unexpected spice to it - seemed to be due to drops of chili oil and some cinnamon.  It also had beautiful presentation (and served in a somewhat hilarious flying-saucer shaped bowl).  It was also a generous portion. Then I got the pork cubano panini, which turned out to be two mini sandwiches (almost slider size) with some fried plantains on the side.  I enjoyed all of it.   My roommate got the gnocchi which she enjoyed.  These main dishes were small, but not unexpectedly so (I always assume small portions at fancy restaurants), which was fine with me because of the filling portion of soup we just got. Then came the desserts.  Ugh.  This was the worst part of the whole meal.  I got La Religieuse, which is kind of a caramel-pastry puff with hazelnut cream.  I really disliked it.  And I'm usually a girl who loves her desserts.  It had a weird orange flavor to it, and the pastry tasted rubbery and stale at the same time.  My roomate go Le Not-Guilty, which was supposed to be non-fat vanilla mousse with granola and pineapple.  I tasted some of her dessert and disliked it just as much as mine.  Both the mousse and the pineapple had a weird gelatinous texture, and the mousse was not very vanilla-flavored.  Both of us only ate 1 bite of our desserts. Bottom line, NoMI is a pretty environment with lovely views, attentive service and good food, but go somewhere else for dessert.  I'm not sure I'd go back when I'd have to pay normal restaurant prices.  If yelp would let me, I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars.",0.9067,0.823,0.107,0.07,0.672145061728395

When you're paying this much at a restaurant the only expectation would be that you receive impeccable service and in this aspect NoMI did not disappoint. NoMI also came through with the food. We started off with the Chicken and Foie Gras Mousse. Did someone say Foie Gras?? SOLD. The 'slider' Cubano Panini and Parisian Saffron Gnocchi were both great dishes. (It amused me that I ordered a 'slider' at such an upscale place that wasn't from White Castle) If you decide to go with dessert, Le Mac (macarons-imagine gourmet Oreos) is a unique offering with 3 different flavors: milk chocolate Grand Marnier, passion banana, and mint lime. We also ordered La Religieuse but that was a challenge to dissect because the hazelnut sauce was so sticky. Overall, I don't mind indulging at a fancy lunch spot every so often and I will keep NoMI in mind when I have my next inkling to.

The dining room has two modes: Sunday brunch, and their standard service.  The brunch was good but I'm not into brunchy foods, so I'm not the best judge there.  The various chefs have all been very innovative with their offerings, however.  The main service is a menu filled with upscale, delicious fare - much quite heavy, rich, and intense - plus a very complete wine list.  I found the fare to strike my palate quite well, so it was always a treat to be able to go.  However, all of this has a downside: it's goofy-expensive.  When two of my best friends got engaged, I took them here to celebrate and pulled out all the stops.  I think the meal for the three of us was on the order of $250 and the wine another $200.  This was not something I could afford to do almost ever - few people can.  They also had a fairly rapid chef turnover a couple of years ago; I don't know how the kitchen has settled out now, but there are plenty of reviews that address that. It's an experience, I'll say that.  If you want it without totally going broke, just go to the lounge and hang there once.  You'll get a sense of what it's like and you can sneak a peak in the dining room.  They'll also bring you the dining menu to look at (but not order from).  Note that the lounge has a more relaxed dress code of casual-hip; I used to go in jeans and a decent shirt.",0.9968,0.793,0.184,0.023,0.5813523573200994

Though I was slightly disappointed to see almost everything in our tasting in the menu (but what can you expect from a Monday night?), highlights for me were definitely the turbot, glazed with carrots cooked with bacon (yum!) and a beef duet with what seemed to be ratatouille. The pairings seemed very well planned out, with a surprisingly good brunello to go with a great set of deserts, which our party shared. Views were great, and the terrace seemed like it would be perfect on a warm days. Would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking scenery, class, and some good eats.",0.9944,0.654,0.315,0.03,0.65

The inspiration is gone reflected in the quality, variety, innovation, and risk all of which are sadly lacking. I mean for goodness sakes, just looking at some of the other reviews, the turbot has been an unmovable and uninspired cement like fixture on the menu for over 3 to 4 years. Does the Park Hyatt need a $150K a year exec chef for this?  I've had multiple, detailed correspondences with the gm and f&b director hoping only to help them get back on track, but today after yet another underwhelming, insipid display, I am done.

2009-07-27,3.0,"The menu is split into three sections: sushi, starters, and entrees. We were fairly confused about how to approach it, but decided on starting with some sushi, have one starter and sharing an entree.  The quality of the sashimi was unparalleled. We eat sushi weekly, and both felt it was extraordinary.  The second dish was crab wrapped in a bizarre beet red gelatin slab. It's smooth, jiggly redness was not exactly the most appetizing thing I've ever seen. The crab inside of it was very good though. Overall, a mixed bag.  Then, we shared the Turbot for our entree. It tasted very good, but the presentation was equally difficult to understand. It was served in two tube like shapes, almost having the appearance of a ""fish sausage"". I can only guess that they somehow rolled and compressed it into this odd shape? Admittedly, I have infrequently seen Turbot on menus, so have limited experience with it.  Nomi feels like it is lodged somewhere between the 1987 and 2030, but it is impossible to figure out where exactly.  The service attempts to be very formal, but falls short. Our head waiter was friendly, but often absent.  It was overall a fun an interesting night (with fantastic views by the way), but I think if we were to return, we would stick with the sushi.",0.9818,0.791,0.154,0.055,0.4593650793650794

2009-06-29,4.0,"I remember a low-end porno magazine from the 90's called 'Swank.' I don't know if it's still around or if it survived the digital porn revolution, but that magazine introduced the word ""swanky"" into my personal lexicon. The word meant something different back then. After dining at NoMI, I've acquired a whole new level of understanding of what it means to be swanky.  This place gleams and glistens above Michigan Avenue. It's meticulous, from the décor to the service to the food. If you get a window table (which we were lucky enough to do), you have unbelievable views of the lake, the water tower, the Hancock, and all the little ants down on Michigan Ave. People with serious money live in this rarified atmosphere all the time. I just like to visit once in awhile, without having to pass a background check, or append a Roman numeral to the end of my name.  The rave is about NoMI's sushi and desserts. I have to agree. Sushi is such a consistent, predictable commodity, but somehow this was the best sushi I've ever eaten. It's difficult to explain how one piece of raw dead fish is better than another...something about the texture and some subtle additions of flavor to the rolls. Whatever the reason, the sushi was fantastic.  As for the entrees and appetizers, I have no real complaints. Everything was executed with great care, precision, and creativity...but the flavors were kind of abstract and difficult to lock into and they didn't make my taste buds go wild with delight (but the prices certainly made my wallet tingle with anxiety.) The desserts were along the same vein of being creative and modern, but also managed, at the same time, to be delicious. A WEIRD NOTE: I know I shouldn't comment on this, but it's impossible not to. NoMI only has about 15-20 tables at full capacity, and more than half the tables were empty on this night, but a full 5 of the tables that were occupied (including all of those within my line of vision) comprised of white dudes with hot Asian dates. I thought I was hallucinating...that I suffered some head trauma and was now experiencing double, triple, and now quintuple vision. (Was my afternoon cocktail of absinthe finally kicking in? No, everyone still had only one head, two ears, and two eyes.) I know that Chicago is a very diverse city and that's cool, but simply I cannot explain this statistical anomaly without concluding that some Asian fetish convention was in town. I started feeling suddenly self-conscious about my embarrassingly predictable choice for a mate, and started examining my very Caucasian, very Polish wife and wondering how she could be a little more Asian, too. So to all you single, frustrated Asian men who are wondering where all the women disappeared to, you might want to head down to NoMI and straighten out some business before these pansy white bankers steal them all.",0.9418,0.79,0.118,0.093,0.47159054620593094

It was ok but nothing amazing and cost nearly twenty dollars.My girlfriend had the peekytoe crab which looked amazing but looked better than it tasted.  The main disppointment was the entree. I ordered the rack of lamb and expected to see at least 3 cutlets of lamb (Gordon Ramsays restaurant serves 3 cutlets so I expected 3 at least) what came out was 2 medium size cutlets which were average (for 50 dollars). After eating my main course i was still extremely hungry. My girlfriend ordered the duet of beef and she thought it was nice but again nothing exceptional.

I would have to say, it is probably THE BEST outdoor patio/bar in Chicago that I've been to (ok ok..i admit...i've only been to a handful of outdoor patios..but this one just took my breath away). The view is gorgeous and the space is absolutely stunning. I would describe the decor as pristine--white linens and natural woods. And even though we were only 7 stories high, I felt like i was totally removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. I was in my own little happy land! and all i wanted to do was sit back, relax and enjoy a drink! :) I didn't have the opportunity to stay for dinner, but the waiters were passing out cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, which I must say were unique and delicious. The few items that stand out in my memory were the truffle-infused pastry with asparagus and the thai chicken skewers served with a perfectly complementary coriander chutney. It was simple, subtle yet just the perfect combination of texture and spices. I am very very keen on sampling items from the rest of the menu.  The drinks were reminicnet of old-school cocktails. Nothing too fancy and over the top...which i think is awesome. I hate when restaurants try to mix up weird and exotic ingredients to make shitty cocktails that leave a bad taste in your mouth. NoMI sticks to what is traditionally good and i think it works really well for them. The service was friendly and professional. They were very attentive and made sure that everyone in our party was being taken care of. I am really becoming a believer of outstanding service. A restaurant like this can have nothing less. Ok.

We hit NoMi around 11:45, and were rewarded with the best table in the house, overlooking a snowy Michigan Avenue.

The crab cakes were crispy without being greasy. Come to think of it, the insides even had a nice crunch.  However, I thought the portion was a little small for a lunch entree. The gnocchi was delicious -- buttery and mouth-melty! I do not recall the name of the catch of the day on that particular day, but it was similar to swordfish in that it was a firm white fish. It was flaky and perfectly cooked.  As for dessert, the carrot cake was my absolute favorite -- and not just because I count carrot cake as a serving of vegetables. It was amazingly moist with a delicate swirl of white chocolate mousse. The tart was more berry than pistachio, and the caramel chocolate macaroon was sinfully rich. The sorbet was sorbet -- it was fruity and cleansed my palette, but sorbet will never be dessert to me!

The Good: We were one of the firsts there for lunch so we were seated by the windows which allowed us to see Michigan Ave. For $22, I ordered the Pumpkin Coconut Soup, The Catch of the Day (which was Mahi Mahi) over Wilted Spinach, Potato Puree, and Sauce Vierge, and a Trio of Seasonal Sorbet (Spiced pear, Cherry, and Tropical Fruit). Now, this is only a Restaurant Week special. Normally the price is $25 for the prix-fixe, but I would definitely come back for $3 more. My meal was, for the most part, off the hook. I thoroughly enjoyed my soup, and entree, and the Spiced Pear Sorbet was amazing (the other two tasted surprisingly ordinary).  We also received a tray of bite sized sweets with our check. A very nice touch to the meal. Now the bad...  I ordered the non-alcoholic Mini Bellini for a drink, and was in sticker shock when I received the check. $10 for a 5 oz. flute of juice, when a glass of wine was priced at $9. Also, I feel bad for my boyfriend because I dont think his meal was as tasty. He ordered the Chicken Apple Soup (with subtle hints of Truffle Oil), Potato Gnocchi, and the Chocolate Caramel Brownie Macaroon. From the small tastes I had, the soup tasted a little watery, the gnocchi was very greasy, and the dessert, while very appealing to the eye, was a very sad attempt at an ice cream sandwich. The macaroons were as hard as rocks, the caramel ice cream was way too sweet, and the chocolate syrup was so thick and gooey in consistency that the taste of chocolate lingered in our mouths a long time after eating it. Also, the service while good, was very strange, even by fine dining standards. Our server kept switching from one person to another. Now I assumed one was a server, and the other a server assistant, but then a busser came out to drop bread on our table. It is nice to have consistency and somebody to make a connection when you go out to eat, but that did not happen this time. I also noticed that at the other tables, the ""server"" was always there to explain the dishes as they were dropped, but we received no such treatment. There was a nice side salad that came with our soups... Too bad we had no idea what we were eating because it wasn't listed in the menu, nor was it explained to us. It wasn't bad because everything that needed to be done was done, but nobody really took the helm. Also, I assumed that NoMI was going to be a totally trendy place, especially since it is located in such a prime location. I was a little disappointed by the atmosphere when I got there. The best word to describe would be sterile. Even though everything is nicely decorated, and the servers are not dressed up in stuffy tuxes, the place is still missing personality: the music is just a little too soft, and everything is just a little too polished.

2009-01-31,4.0,"Went here with out-of-town friends just prior to Christmas.  Overall, it was a great dinning experience.  Be prepared to spend a good 2 or 3 hours dinning, if you do it right.   The view at NOMI is superb.  Many times, I've looked up at it, while on Michigan Avenue and wondered how the food is.  On the night we visited, we were seated right in front of the big window, and the view is great. I started my meal off with sushi.  It was very good.  I picked out the Nomi Roll and couldn't have been happier.  For a main course, I had their version of pot roast, also very good, especially the Kobe beef that stews in its own consume'.  The food, while extraordinary, does not appeal to my blue-collar Chicago idea of fine dinning.  For the money, I'd prefer a huge steak and maybe some lobster tails.  But no doubt, the food here is expertly prepared and exquisitely presented.  Don't let my unrefined sensibilities deter you from going.  If Nomi were to serve the same style dinner as say, Bandera, it would exceed 5 stars in my book. The wine selections were excellent as well.  If you get a chance to treat yourself to Nomi, please do so.  The food, coupled with experience and surroundings are worth the money you'll be spending.",0.9884,0.781,0.189,0.03,0.6040800865800866

I hate to say it, but it's not worth the high price tag (I believe dinner for 2 of us was around 500-600).  The view was very cool though, I must say.  We were there on the night of a thunder/lightning storm so that added a little bit of fun to the view.",0.8285,0.832,0.11,0.058,0.502716049382716

And they have an inclination for playing the perfect 'mood' music-- downtempo, sexy, just a well-planned buildup! The brown butter gnocchi tastes as fabulous as it sounds. I've never tried the sushi, but I can't justify paying $23 for a spicy tuna roll. Or an $8 Guinness for that matter! So realize going in that you'll be throwing down some cash and treat yourself to something indulgent, like a $15 truffle martini. Yea girl... order what you REALLY want. I love the lounge space and all of its dimly lit allure, but the garden terrace is truly special. Something about it makes me forget I'm in Chicago and rather, have been whisked away to an exotic locale. I saw Scarlett Johansson here once boys, and yes, she is even more beautiful in person.

2008-12-14,2.0,"I was at Nomi today for brunch. I was hesitant to go back after a pretty bad dinner experience, but  thought I'd give it a second chance since it is so highly rated.  The room is lovely. We sat at a table at the window overlooking Water Tower, and it's a truly great view. The lounge is a great space for drinks. Go somewhere else for dinner.  The food is okay - for my dinner and my brunch experiences, the food was just average - not award-winning. My real beef with Nomi is the service. Both of my experiences here have been rushed and borderline rude. When we sat down for brunch, we never offered coffee/tea/juice - we just sat there waiting for someone to come to the table for about 15 minutes. When someone did come (not our server), they presented the wine list and menus. Our server came up and asked if we were ready to order. We said we would prefer to order something to drink first, and she said ""That's fine, but just to let you know, the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes.""  We had reservations. Why would they accept reservations for a time they thought was too close to the kitchen closing? She came back and said, ""Are you ready to order now?"" It was the kind of service I expect at a diner. After we ate, our server appeared to tell us, ""just to let you know, the desert station is closing in 10 minutes.""  Then, we sat there for over 20 minutes, with a cleared table, waiting for our check.  To top it off, I had asked the hostess to make sure I received the check at the end of the meal. She assured me that would not be a problem. After we flagged someone down for the check, our server appeared again and presented it to my brother. Very annoying.  This is the same bad service that made me dislike my dinner here.  For the amount of money, I expect better. Instead, I would ABSOLUTELY go to Avenues across the street. Or Tru, or Spiaggia, or just about any other place.  If you are planning to spend a considerable amount and want a lovely dinner with great service, do not go to Nomi.

We had a couple of hours to kill after shopping and before heading to a concert so my wife, suggested we go there.  She and a friend had been there for lunch after they could not get into RL. We grabbed a couple of very comfortable chairs overlooking the Michigan & Chicago intersection.  Menu appeared along with a bowl of mixed nuts--heavy on the cashews (should have been my first clue that this was going to be pricey).   We ordered three small plates and a couple of glasses of wine.  The empanadas were fine but the pastry was a bit dry.  The crab cakes with fennel were so-so at best, but what does one expect with crab meat in Chicago in December.  Our 3rd small plate was a Spanish cheese plate that was served in a small crock heavily infused with olives.  Interesting and ok but not something I'll have to do again.

2008-08-29,4.0,"Located in the Park Hyatt Chicago, NoMI [from North Michigan, as in Avenue] serves upscale contemporary French cuisine with an Asian twist. The 7th floor  restaurant boasts stunning views of Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan and even has a 50-seat outdoor terrace; the entire restaurant, including the 120-seat main dining room, is designed by Tony Chi. The adjoining lounge features a Wenge wood bar, Bolivian rosewood floors and backless eelskin stools. The restaurant was named Best Hotel Restaurant by Time Out Chicago 2007 Readers and for good reason, it's a unique space with spot on service and excellent French-based dishes. I've been going to NoMI since it opened and have to say that since the kitchen was overtaken by Christophe David, of the Park Hyatt Paris, it has only gotten better over the years. The cuisine is a distinctive blend of experiences, engaging all the senses, and offers diners a myriad of choices. From those who crave an elegant meal, to more casual fare in the NoMI Lounge, Garden, and secluded Cellar on the Seventh - all offer a distinctive take on chef David's palate-pleasing contemporary French cuisine interweaved with a global flare.  Sharing the same understated confidence of Chef David himself, the menus take an unpretentious approach to fine dining, evident by the fact that most dishes remain infinitely accessible, rarely involving more than three or four key flavors. Chef David leads a talented team in executing a vision rooted in sophisticated simplicity.  Whether it is after a few small bites or splurging on a five-course tasting, NoMI's dessert selections are refined and delicious. The dedication of the pastry chef shines through in the artful execution of everything from homemade sorbets and mignardises to post-modern transformations of classic, comforting desserts.",0.9923,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.5139705882352942

Every juice they use in their drinks is freshly squeezed--how cool is that? They also make the best mojito I've had, despite not being at all Latin. In the summertime, the outdoor patio is, in my opinion the best outdoor spot for drinks in the city. The food in the restaurant is very good, but NoMi's pricing puts it among the top tier of Chicago restaurants, and the food is not quite good enough to compete against... oh, say Alinea, for instance. First, I know the sushi side of the menu is a holdover from the previous chef and his concept, but now it makes no sense. I've eaten at NoMi twice, and I've had some dishes that have been exceptional, and some that were pretty forgettable. But here's the thing-- if you get to sit in one of the six or so window tables (which they won't guarantee when you make your reservation), the whole experience is absolutely worth the money. The view from these windows is my favorite view in the city--the Water Tower and Pumping Station, lit at night, perfectly captures Chicago's beautiful, muscular appeal, and seen from the 7th floor of the Park Hyatt, it's breathtaking. If you're not in the windows, the pretty Chahuli (sp?) chandeliers are not quite pretty enough to keep you from noticing the flaws in the food. And no view would be good enough to save the desserts... they're terrible. My first visit to NoMi's restaurant featured an awkward episode: suddenly, in the middle of our dinner, we heard someone scream (and I mean, absolutely scream) from the open kitchen, ""JUST PLATE IT!!!!!!"". All sound in the dining room stopped. The waiters froze, then started looking at each other sheepishly, then began pretending like nothing had happened.

Everything about our experience was first class.  When I called and made the reservation, the hostess asked if we were celebrating an occasion and I told her it was our anniversary (our 2.5 years of dating anniversary, but they don't need to know).  When we arrived, we were given a special menu with Happy Anniversary printed on the inside.  I'm sure they have a ton of these pre-printed, but still nice touch.  We were also seated at a window table, with a wonderful view of the Watertower and N. Michigan.  Our reservation was quite early (6pm), so I'm sure that's the reason we got such a nice table.  It terms of the actual dinning experience, it was done quite well.  Our server was helpful, accommodating, and very enthusiastic and passionate about giving recommendations.  We put ourselves in his hands and went with his recommendations on just about everything from our appetizer to main course to wine to dessert.  The food was absolutely delicious.  Everything from the amuse bouche to dessert was not only tasty, but creative and innovative.  I would give recommendations, but their menu is constantly changing.  Besides, you should go with an open mind and ask your server for recommendations.  At the end of our meal we were also given a little tray of chocolates with another happy anniversary message and our server, who is the floor captain, presented his business card told us to request a window table the next time we return. So overall, the experience was wonderful.  The food is delicious and the service is excellent.  It's everything we expected fine dining to be.  If you go, just keep in mind it doesn't come cheap!  (If you are curious about prices, check their menus on their website.  Not all dishes are necessarily current, but it will give you a ballpark.) I think they are certainly on par with other establishments, and worth every penny in my opinion.  For special occasions, I think NoMi is a great choice.

2007-09-26,4.0,"Cool & hot style all in the same space... AMBIANCE - This Japanese/nature influenced restaurant and bar is just a stylish wet dream to get away to.  Premium drinks and seating, both inside and on the patio, and a bar that has enough nooks to hide in a giant Bombay Sapphire & tonic from the day's stresses.  Earth tones and plants, with subtle splashes of flower color to make you wish it was your million dollar living room. There is a time and place for Irish drunk sports yuppies wearing  baseball caps because he's too f_cking lazy to comb his hair.  Don't embarass yourself by not wearing cocktail attire.  If you DO wear a baseball cap and jeans, you better be Cindy Crawford with the kids, an Hermes bag, and pay with a black card, baby. SERVICE & CIRCUSES - Restaurant is 100% class and top shelf service.  Again, most people do not know how to eat out at a classy restaurant.  My BIG MIDWEST complaint is that very few people have or know what manners are.  I read the other reviews about the service and there is no issue with it.  Dress well, be nice but firm, and you'll be fine.  Also, reserve early for the park window seat.  Not guaranteed, but if you get there first, you'll have a great view of the Watertower. FOOD - Sushi - EXCELLENT.  Be careful when ordering.  The cut rolls are fairly big and the main entree portions are good size.  Had the Katsura plate (9 pieces) + a NoMi roll (8 pieces of spicy tuna w/ bbq eel) - WAY too much for an appetizer.   Another appetizer was the lobster salad w/arugula pesto - beautiful plating, superbly prepared.   A beet & carrot gazpacho with candied foam was also given (foam always worrys me, but here, it is an amazing flavor floating on the main dish - very nice touch.   She - Maine diver scallops & sweetbreads.  Me - Roasted duck breast (med rare) encrust w/ almond over a veggie coulis.  Hers - scallops were seared and naturally sweet, with almost a light brandy glaze, sweetbreads were fried and a nice contrast, the julienned peapods were tender and sweet, but all the veggies had too much salt.  Duck was perfectly cooked, veggies were salty, and the tarragon foam was just too light for such a rustic dish.  Leave the foam for light things that need flavor.  The salty veggies dropped a star on this review. DESSERT - White peach clafoutis w/peach ice cream and lavender jelly.  Man, that lavender jelly was just like tasting your first kiss with that hot date over and over again. WINE LIST - Incredible stock, but one thing caught my eye, you can get a GLASS of Chateau D'Yquem sauterne at $70/glass.  Legend has it, while other sauterne chateaus pick their grapes by the bunch, Chateau D'Yquem picks theirs INDIVIDUALLY.  Imagine the rest of their by the glass stock (its superb). PRICE - Expensive, if you're a STUDENT.  Yeah, you won't leave there with less than $75/head, but its just a great evening.  Shut up and pay the bill.  Remember what it's like to eat civilized.  And tell your friends to do the same.",0.9979,0.804,0.167,0.029,0.5900564971751412

The tea list was quite extensive, with offerings from the expected (Darjeeling, Earl Grey, Mint) to the unheard of (a tea which comes into its own after being left in a hollowed-out pomelo in a cave).  The prices range from reasonable to un (yes, that is a pot of tea that costs $250). Service was fairly attentive.  I didn't think the server knew as much about tea as you'd expect.  She floundered to come up with suggestions for a decaf tea (the herbals didn't come to her mind at all), but she set us up with all the elements for success-- heavy iron teapots, delicate cups and saucers, tiny jars of Bon Mamman honey, lemon wedges, and the usual array of sugars and sugar substitutes. The Tea Accoutrements are described as a three-tiered display of finger sandwiches, petit fours and homemade pastries.  Maybe our overstuffed ottoman wasn't the place for anything multi-tiered, but we got individual platters of fun-sized tea snacks.  A good range of sweet and savory, fancy and simple.  I loved the pistachio pot au creme, wasn't wild about the citrus Madeleine, struggled to eat the serrano ham bruschetta with one hand and heard good things about a chocolate and praline sweetie.  We only ordered for 4, but we left a fair amount on the plates-- maybe we were too reluctant to stuff our faces?  I could have eaten the savory snacks off each plate and left all but the pistachio to the others, I know. If you don't lose your mind and accidentally order a $250 pot of tea, you can have an affordable and relaxing afternoon with quite a few cups' worth of your favorite brew and some lovely bits and bites for easily less than $30 a person.

I got the egg white omelette (yeah, I'm one of those people that like to order Diet Coke with my supersized Mickey-D's) and it was dee-lish.  I'm not an eggs benedict fan but I hear theirs is fantastic - it has a piece of lobster on the side.  It looked good and tasted fine, but I'm not a good judge of eggs benedict.  The catch of the day was also mighty tasty.  So, on to the stations: Station #1: Raw bar: sushi, rolls, shrimp cocktail, oysters, seaweed salad, soba noodles.  This was all so so so delicious and fresh. Station #2: Hot foods: Three kids of french toast (raisin, chocolate, classic), two kinds of pancakes (nuts, banana), quiche, sausages (chicken, pork), bacon, cream of potato soup, potatoes.   Station #3: Salads, Breads, Cheese, Crackers, Ham, Pate, BREAD PUDDING. Station #4: Various gourmet dessert bites and a CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN. All in all, a great way to start off Sunday - normally a day you when you wake up sad that the weekend is almost over and work starts the next day.  The standouts in my mind were the oysters, french toasts, quiche, pancakes, sausage, egg white omelette, and bread pudding.  The desserts were a bit too gourmet-ish for my taste.  I would have preferred more cake-y stuff, like a cupcake buffet.  But, the other stuff is soooooooo good and you don't have much room left for dessert anyway.",0.9925,0.834,0.147,0.018,0.48976569407603887

Within moments of sequestering myself (read: hiding) around the corner by the dining area, a kindly man deposited a small dish of salted cashews on my little accent table and wordlessly handed me a menu. I ordered the sake margarita and waited for my bosses to arrive. They called ahead and asked me to order them 2 pomegranate margaritas, and the waiter (not the first guy) gave me a barely concealed look of death, lol. I don't know why, but he just bristled. When the guys got there, they scored a table outside, so we paid and enjoyed the outdoor terrace. VERY cool eating outside that high up. My Iowa girl was giggling inside.  Service outside was a little slower, but no less friendly than the cashew/menu guy when I first got there. The next time by boss is paying for $15 drinks, I am SO there...otherwise, this is a special occasion place for me. EDIT 10/18/07: Went back for a work dinner. The menu was fairly limited, but we were told it changes every day, and that leads me to believe that they are working with the best stuff they can get on a daily basis. Very cool. We were also served an amuse bouche and shots of hot chocolate on the house (also very cool). The sushi was sublime - I even enjoyed the salmon, and I normally avoid it.

I remember that Tammy had a ""deconstructed vegetable plate"" of tiny tomatoes, squash, etc. all taken apart, stuffed, and reassembled. The intricate work was something to behold. She then had an off-the-menu wild mushroom risotto that I worked with the manager to arrange for a special surprise. It was by far the best risotto we've ever had.

I loved the atmosphere and the people working there.  We asked to sit by the window and they let us.  The view was beautiful.  We also got quite a good deal, compared to their regular prices.  Btw, here's a tip: they have a $45 3-course tasting menu between 5:30 and 6:30pm, an appetizer, a main course, and dessert.  I guess I've listed all the good things.  Oh wait!  I forgot, I got the watercress cream soup that comes with Belgian black caviar, which I happen to loooove, and I think the amount of caviar alone was worth like 20 bucks, so big thanks for that, NoMi!  The soup was kind of salty, though, which I guess makes sense since I put in all the caviar. Ok, on to the reasons I took away a star (or two).  Surprisingly, it's the food.  I expected better.  My husband's squab (it's a bird that tastes a little like liver) was good, but my salmon was kind of tasteless.   Now here's the worst part.  Prior to this night, I had never tasted chocolate anything that I didn't like.  That's probably because I'd never tasted SALTY chocolate.  Why would chocolate be salty??  Ok, I decided to go with 4 stars, just because maybe I just didn't get the idea behind this dessert.  For all I know, salty is the new sweet...or bitter. Oh, almost forgot.  We didn't finish our food and they packed both of our entrees in the same container.  What's up with that?  One was fish and the other a bird of some sort.

2007-04-13,4.0,"Just came here to celebrate our 4-year anniversary, and hmm hmm hmm was it delicious. My fiance made a reservation via OpenTable, and requested a window seat for our anniversary.  When we first arrived, we signed in, and the hostess proceeded to seat us ALMOST at the window seat, but I asked if we could sit at one of the empty window tables, per our OpenTable request.  The hostess agreed to ask the Manager, and he did comply.  The view of the city while dining on the 7th floor of the Park Hyatt was amazing.  The atmosphere was a little stuffy, but the interior decoration (big windows, modern lights, and funky calamari-shaped things hanging from the ceiling).   For drinks, we ordered John Anthony  Sauvignon Blanc from Napa Valley, and a Rioja Red wine - both were delcious (around $12 per glass).  I especially liked the Sauvignon Blanc, and I typically prefer reds - it was really smooth, and not too fruity. One of the servers then brought out the amuse bouche, which was cured meat wrapped with grapes, and all I can say is WOW, this did indeed amuse and excite the palate!! We then had some freshly baked/made bread - ranging from the oven-warm sourdough (YUM) to a crunchy and tasty cranberry cracker.  For appetizers, we were debating between  the truffle dish and the diver scallops tart.  We ended up going for the diver scallops tart (DEFINITELY recommend, especially if you're not getting the diver scallop entree).  OMG these scallops were amazing, nothing like I've ever eaten before.  The thin diver scallops were on top of caramelized leeks (w/butter), and tart, with parsley as garnish.  Eating the scallops/leeks/tart together with the parsley was so delicious - a mouthful of flavors in my mouth, with the taste of parsley to cleanse the palate.  Next time, I do want to order the truffle brulee (with caramelized hazelnuts!) For entrees, we ordered the torbut (white fish) and veal.  Each came with shallots, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, all caramelized and tasty.  The torbut was also the pricier entree (at $42), which I felt was a little overpriced for what I expet a $42 fish to be.  The torbut dish did also come with little shrimp (that were actually pretty tasty, and melts in your mouth) and some mussels, and foam (which was interesting to eat).  The veal dish was more unique than the torbut (with the polenta), and I enjoyed the caramelized veggies more than the fish.  The veal was a tad bit overcooked (we ordered medium, but it did come out medium well, so I recommend ordering it medium rare).  Nonetheless, the veal was tasty.  Next time I go back, I'll get the poussin (baby chicken) or the lamb & artichokes. However, I did salvage my torbut choice by ordering a wonderful dessert - the pineapple panna cotta with passionfruit sorbet/coconut. I don't even like coconut that much, but the combination of flavors (the pineapple even had pepper on top) was SOOO unique and exquisite.  The flavors were all so distinct and melts in your mouth.  My fiance got the Chocolate Cake with mocha ice cream, which was good, but not as good as my dessert :).  Now here's where the service was top-notch, the server brought out a special anniversary dessert, with a line of truffles, etc., and handmade chocolate that read ""Happy Anniversary"".  Throughout the night, the servers were attentive, our glasses were never beyond half empty, and the timing in clearing plates, and brining out meals were perfect.  I could not have expected a better experience.  I will definitely go back, maybe even for brunch! Overall, the tab came out to $100 per person with all the food/drinks we had.",0.9983,0.828,0.15,0.022,0.5881401617250673

The buffet has 5 stations:  seafood and sushi, breakfast items, artisan cheeses and pastries, salads, and desserts.  The seafood, alone, is amazing.  Crab claws, huge shrimp, smoked salmon, huge oysters, maki and sushi were fresh and delicious.  There were two seafood salads: one pasta, one seaweed, both fantastic.  The general breakfast items included pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages, and potatoes.  The cheeses were delicious, with prosciutto and sausage, chocolate croissants, and breads were great.  In addition, there were salads: field greens and caesar salad, an orzo salad,  and grilled asparagus.   The food was all very good and very fresh.  The desserts were a little disappointing, although a chocolate fountain is never unwelcome.  The selection of the buffet was just enough that you could try everything you wanted without feeling completely overwhelmed, but also not feeling like there weren't enough options.  We had fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juice.   The service was excellent, and the atmosphere elegant and sophisticated without feeling stuffy.  I was surprised, though, to find so many people in jeans...definitely not something I'd feel comfortable doing.

2006-12-19,4.0,"NoMi is fabulous and worth a trip at least once. We went for our one year anniversary and NoMi helped to make it a special night. We requested a table by the window and although we had to wait 30 minutes beyond our reservation, it was worth it. (While waiting we had champage in the romantic lounge--highly reccomended.) This has to be one of the most soght after views of the city. Words cannot do it justice. The wine list was impressive and will amaze any wine connoisseur, but I'll admit that the food did not blow me away. It was very good, but certainly not one of the most memorable meals. We started with some sushi and salads and then my husband had the veal. If I were to go back, I wouldnt bother with the sushi, it doesnt come close to Bob San or Wabi, but then again this is not a sushi restaurant.  My only real compaint is the stuffiness of this place. I am used to fine dining, and I found NoMi to be quite pretentious.  This is a place worth trying just for the view and experience, and especially is you are on an expense account. Expect to pay somewhere around $150 a person (that includes a moderately priced bottle of wine).",0.9712,0.85,0.135,0.016,0.5661428571428571
2006-12-12,2.0,"**DISCLAIMER** My review is for Private Dining, not for the main dining room ---we were a party of 40 and had a set menu. No doubt regular dining is as awesome as it was when NoMi opened some 7 years ago. Because of that I'd raved to my co-diners about NoMi's spectacular dishes, and boy did I put my foot in my mouth.  The theme for the night was truffles, which would be fine if everything prepared around it was as meticulous and exacting as the decor. Note to NoMi: Don't scale back when people pay en-masse. Please? Can you sell one of those Chihuly sculptures in the main dining room and use it to hire someone to supervise the Private Dining line cooks a little more?? (ok.....breathe.) Several items were perfect: Hearts of Boston Bibb Lettuce, shaved Parmigiano and truffle oil-- amazing presentation and practically surreal unblemished greens. A truffle tart with leeks and paremesan really brought out the mushroom's earthy flavor, although some thought the leeks actually masked it. One definite upside was that the service was stellar!  Some things should never have been served: their fish, set on top of nicely-wilted arugula, was a variety of cod, but it was overdone and tough. It was also topped with a mountain of capers which overwhelmed the entire dish.  I would've given more stars in the rating, but having dined here during their inaugural year I had to consider that the bar was set pretty high for this place.",0.9291,0.885,0.091,0.025,0.5131508875739644
2006-11-22,3.0,"From all the glowing reviews and colleagues' recommendations, NoMI is nothing short of fabulous. Last night's dinner was memorable, but only because NoMI strangely fell short of the hype. The ambience, decor and food would have been perfect but there was that niggling sense that something was missing. My dining companion's turbot was left 'one minute too long' under the grill. The trio of souffles was delicious but nothing extraordinary. The wait staff were polite and solicitous yet there was an absence of spontaneity in their rather mechanical responsiveness. It was only at the end of the meal that we decided that the generic-ness of NoMI was the most disturbing of all. The truly great establishments don't need a branded scented candle to leave a lasting impression.",0.9057,0.763,0.146,0.091,0.5583333333333333
2006-11-18,3.0,"I live in Chicago but for a celebration my boyfriend and I decided to spend a night at the Park Hyatt (which is wonderful) and have dinner at NoMi. Despite the fact that I was staying at the hotel and I booked well in advance, my request for a tabel up front was not accommodated.  Not the end of the world, but since I mentioned that it was a special occasion, was paying for a hotel room as well, I kind of thought it would be nice to be up front. Never mind, I was still looking forward to what I assumed would be an excellent meal. Our server initially was quite aloof as was the somellier.  But our waiter ended up warming up to us nicely and being excellent and very accommodating. But then there was the food.  I was shocked by the mediocrity of all courses. Even dessert was nothing special.  The appetizers were just ok.  The entrees were bizarrely oversalted.  My entree bordered on inedible as a result.  My boyfriend's lamb would have been great were it not for the salt.   The wine was good, but it should have been. I enjoy fine dining and have been to many restaurants in this category and while I had heard NoMi was a bit overrated, I did not expect to come away feeling like I could have had a better dinner in a neighborhood joint for a quarter of the price. The excellence of our waiter is keeping this from being a 1 star in my opinion.  I would have been disappointed with the food even if I had spent half the amount. My recommendation: Spend the same amount you would on a dinner at NoMi on a Water Tower View room in the Park Hyatt off season and get a hamburger in their lounge... those are phenominal.",0.9957,0.778,0.197,0.026,0.5773809523809522

2006-05-22,5.0,"Went here to celebrate for our one-year anniversary, and my boyfriend and I were absolutely enamored with this place.   If you don't go to upscale restaurants very often, you might get a little thrown off by what some might consider a pompous atmosphere, but we held our own.  My boyfriend's request for one of the window seats paid off, as we had one of the most exquisite views of the city, directly overlooking Water Tower Place with the lake in the far background.  This was WAY better than sitting at the top of the Hancock. Although our sommelier gave us a weird vibe when he quietly sidled up to our table, he was extremely knowledgeable (obviously, you'd have to be to work here) and managed to help us pick an affordable wine that knocked our socks off.  His description of the wine's taste was dead-on. I would have appreciated a waiter who would have at least smiled while serving us, but I guess you can't have everything.  Despite his stellar skills, his dour demeanor gave me the impression he didn't really want to be there.  That was the only fault I found during the evening.   My boyfriend scarfed down the Salmon-Avocado sushi, declaring it perfect, but I thought it had a touch of too much avocado.  The foie-gras (hurry and try it before it's outlawed next month!) surpassed my hesitant expectations.  Duck liver may not sound very appetizing, but I would have licked the plate in a lesser establishment.  My boyfriend said his main course of halibut was worth the money, and I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken with potato pancakes.  It was the first time at a restaurant that I've really noticed how different flavors of foods may taste somewhat bland by themselves, but once mixed together, they will give your taste buds a wild ride. As a chocolate-lover, the highlight of the evening was ordering 'The Plate,' or what I'd like to call a sampling of six decadent chocolate desserts, stylishly presented as if they were a gift from the cocoa gods themselves.   Some may think the serving sizes are too small for the price you pay, but we managed to walk out with our bellies completely  full for under $250 with tax (2 apps, 2 main courses, a couple pieces of bread, 1 dessert, and 1 bottle of wine).  I thought that was a pretty good feat, considering how much I'm sure other couples were plopping down during their meals. Tips if you ever visit: -Dress well.  I saw one guy who looked terribly out of place in jeans, and another who was wearing a short-sleeved dress shirt (I'm sorry, but that's just not right).  Wearing business casual or even dressing to the nines will help you feel at home. -Don't be shy about letting the sommelier know you can't afford a $200 bottle of wine.  If you get a bad reaction, you can let them know when you tip. -Request a window seat with an early reservation in order to make sure that request gets filled.  We went at 6 pm on a Saturday.",0.9941,0.83,0.129,0.041,0.5735685425685425
