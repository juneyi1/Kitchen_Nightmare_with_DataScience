Marigold is described as ""concept Indian"" which sounds like ""modern Mexican"" and I was expecting things to get fru-fru.  They did not however, stray from good Indian traditions.  KT and bf had had the fried calamari appetizer once before and loved it so that was a definite for all of us.  Ms T and I eat fried calamari in St Louis all the time, mostly in Italian restaurants and this is much better.  I liked the fried onions mixed in with it and eating it with the spicy chutney was perfect.  Great choice and highly recommended. For sharing at the table we ordered Rogan Josh, Dal Makhani and a Seafood special of the evening.  All were very good.  The Rogan Josh was more brothy than I have had, but this is perfect with plenty of rice.  I always like to try dal makhani to see how each place makes it.  This was a little more tart and less loaded with cream than some and was very good with the other dishes.  The seafood special had shrimp, mussels and calamari all in a coconut milk sauce, sort of like a Thai dish but not sweetened as a Thai chef would.  It was delicious.   We broke from the usual naan and ordered the chile spiced parathas with paneer which were a nice change although the chile is pretty mild.  I love Indian cuisine but am not qualified to judge.  All in all I would definitely return.",0.9962,0.763,0.22,0.016,0.549041184041184

2013-05-23,4.0,"Boyfriend and I dined at Marigold a few weekends ago, our first dinner out as official new Andersonville residents.  I had not had Indian in a while and was not too thrilled to hear the waitress say this was ""concept"" Indian, or fusion Indian. Whatever that means, I just want good, classic Indian food! Well regardless of what they call themselves, Marigold is definitely good and worth going back to. They are on the pricier side, which I will chalk up to the reality of living in glamorous Andyville. Because of price we kind of ordered entrees that were their cheaper options, the Chicken Tiki, which I normally would never personally order, chicken on the bone just ain't my thing, and the Saag Paneer, a personal fave. Both were very good, but the Saag was awesome for sure. I judge harshly when it comes to the Saag and it was darn good. The real show stopper was the appetizer though, we got the calamari bhaji. I have never seen calamari on an Indian menu. May I say it was one of the greatest impulse orders I've ever had. Calamari with Indian spices and fresh cilantro and a spicy chutney, masala dip is OH MY GOD SO SO SO FREAKING GOOD. The chickpea flour breading on them was so light and crispy too, it was amazing. No way I can eat regular ol' calamari anymore and enjoy it.  The only misstep we had was the gulab jamun. I really wanted something sweet after all the savory but something was very much not right with these balls of dough. I don't know if they just prepare them differently than what I've eaten my entire life (and its been a long life of gulab jamun, let me tell you) but they were hard, like undercooked, or maybe very very overcooked, or OLD? and they were cold, I have always had them served warm. One bite and I thought, Oh heavens NO. So I did what I have never done in my life. I sent it back. I felt so bad about it I was apologizing to the waitress. Either way she was cool about it and took it off the bill. So I was happy. We will definitely be back to Marigold. This might be a generous 4 stars but 3 stars just isn't quite enough, especially when I think about that calamari bhaji.

(which admittedly was a very good dessert, but you say creme brulee vs. carrots, and count the number of tables that order dessert...)   I also think the ambience in the space that used to be Ole Ole needs some work.  I think the restaurant should be darker, and a better ""mood"" needs to be created--tablecloths, even the paper covers that go on top of tablecloths I think would make a nice difference?  I am not a fan of the light wood I think.   Disclosures--I live in the Andersonville neighborhood, and I'm of Indian descent--I WANT this restaurant to succeed!  Please consider these suggestions!",0.9955,0.802,0.174,0.025,0.6191161616161617

If you go to get your fix of authentic Indian dishes here you will be a) disappointed, and b) in possession of much less money than if you'd gone a few blocks northwest of A'ville.  The folks are perfectly nice, but the food -- oh, man, it was just bizarre! I give them props if they're simply trying to subvert your natural associations with these dishes, but we really didn't enjoy a single thing. The lamb rogan josh was like watery lamb soup, with huge peppercorn or coriander seeds in it. The meat was very tender, but it was essentially soup; it was definitely not curry, and the flavors were very off. The saag paneer had an overwhelming coconut flavor to it and the cheese was of an extremely strange viscosity. Finally, the naan tasted like a suspiciously close cousin to matzoh bread.  Truly, the instant naan from Trader Joe's is better. Then, the young chef came out to say hi to some friends and let's just say he was definitely NOT from the Indian subcontinent. Not that this means the man can't cook Indian food, but, all of a sudden, we felt a little silly regarding our expectations of the place. You've probably gathered by now that we stuck to a very narrow definition of what we thought were Indian standards, and we didn't order the more adventurous ""fusiony"" sounding higher end stuff.  And if those are better, then I totally get it and we just thought we were in a different place.

Which brings us to the last thing, the waiter. I am sure he meant well, and he was perfectly polite, but he was so intrusive and overbearing. I understand that we were pretty much the only people in there, but he made us crazy.  If someone could be overly helpful, he was it. He stopped to ask us how everything was about every 3 minutes and when he wasn't at the table interrupting our conversation, he hovered nearby, making sure our water never got more then a half inch below the top of our glass.

Some of the dishes are complex and well-balanced, others seems as though literally no thought went into them. To reiterate Jim L.'s complaint about the Chana Masala, it really is terrible. Embarrassingly so. It tastes like they took a can of tomato paste and mixed it with spices. It is unquestionably the worst chana masala I've ever had, and bears no resemblance to the dish besides the presence of chickpeas. The daal taarka is only slightly better. It overcompensates for its lack of complexity by piling on serrano chilis, but with little success. These are not hard dishes to make. They are standards that virtually any restaurant on Devon can handle with ease. That Marigold misses so thoroughly on them makes one wonder whether the chef has tasted either dish in years, especially considering some of the other dishes on the menu manage to hit all the right notes. The Kalonji Chicken, for instance, was perfectly executed. In general, it seems the entrees tend to work out better than the smaller dishes. And I'm sure one could manage to have a very satisfying meal after learning what dishes to avoid. But that still doesn't excuse the terribleness of the chana masala or the mediocrity of the daal taarka.

Not good! Pakora string beans were good conceptually but batter was too salty and overwhelmed any sense of the beans...the dipping sauce was good. The Chana was horrible...first came to the table lukewarm and tasted like canned tomatoes over bland chickpeas with no depth of flavor or richness that is so satisfying in Indian cuisine. Told waiter of tepid peas and he took back to the kitchen...they came back and were nice and hot but had a strong taste of ginger and cardamom that was absent the first go around....still lacked flavor and richness. Brite and acidic like canned tomatoes but worst Chana I've ever had and I've had hundreds of Indian meals on three continents. The lamb was gamey, as it can sometimes be, but was an interesting combo of whole shank and a patty of fried potato with thin dark and extremely vinegary sauce....description should have warned of this version so you would avoid if you were looking for the rich stew of typical cubed Vindaloo. Potatoes were mushy and didn't have any earthiness or hint of their origins and sauce would be ok in apetizerform but overwhelmed the plate in the large plate version. It was just ok and we barely ate it...leftover lamb does not appeal.

It also came with a tasty cilantro sauce that complimented the spices.  The Saag Paneer was the main attraction. This creamy spinach dish is subtle and hearty. It tasted amazing on the Garlic Naan. While the food was delicious, I wish the portions were more generous. The Naan had to be ordered separately from the Saag Paneer. The Saag Paneer should at least be served with a bowl of rice. Also, the menu offers family portions of the entrees but nothing smaller. I felt like the menu was better suited for a large group of diners rather than two. Overall, it's great to have an Indian restaurant in Andersonville and the quality of the food trumps any problems I have with the menu.",0.9547,0.818,0.147,0.034,0.5261904761904762
