The service was excellent as our waiter was personable and attentive even though we took our time dining. Each course was excellent - only complaint being that the beef ordered medium rare came out well done - but our waiter was happy to correct that with another serving brought out a perfect medium rare.

2011-08-14,3.0,"My last review from 2008 seems like so long ago when you take into consideration the food.  Which has fallen short in my opinion. I still like hitting them up for the occasional mojito or caipirinha and dessert, but when it comes to dining for meals I'm no longer impressed.  With the plethora of restaurants which offer staunch competition in this cuisine, I could go elsewhere for this type of meal.  Money is king and you have to be wise on how to spend it.   I'll skip going into grave details about my recent trips, the gist is that I haven't been impressed with the lackadaisical service in preparation of meat cooked my way and then the time it takes to replace mistakes.  Key to know, a la cart is still the best way to eat and ample time is needed when sitting for dinner.  Never before a movie, make sure to block out time for it.",0.8047,0.763,0.136,0.101,0.5664141414141413

Took my mom there for her birthday, she had the lamb, said it was good, I had beef tenderloin, and my husband the chicken. Food was good all around, I really liked their vegetables that they served with dinner, at first glance they looked to be cooked more than I like them, but whatever spices they put on the veggies was tasty!

2011-07-08,2.0,"If you're dying for Brazilian & don't have a car or bus pass to escape the Edgebrook neighborhood then this is the place. Otherwise you can find places that do it better. The service was great, but the food was a miss for me. I've eaten at most, if not all of the brazilian places in and around Chicago, and this one was not impressive. We both had the All-you can-eat special. The lamb was the only thing that was enjoyable. I vote for Chama Gaucha for best value and food.",0.9493,0.739,0.21,0.052,0.6526785714285713
2011-06-27,3.0,"In my honest opinion, I'm glad I was able to finally try Al Primo Canto after hearing about it through my friend. Sadly I can't decide whether I'd come back any time soon. The service is not terrible, yet in an almost empty dining room, I felt that our server could have been a lot more attentive.  Al Primo Canto offers an all you can eat option of their Brazilian meats ( lamb, chicken, steak ) along with salad, 3 pastas and 3 side dishes. Not bad for the price you pay per person of $30. The difference about this place is that all the sides are served to you rather than buffet style. I'm not sure if I really like the way they set that up. I mean you have no choice really, you get all of the things on the menu whether you like it or not. Then if you find that you don't like it, a whole dish goes to waste. I felt pressured to eat a lot more pasta than I wanted to.  The sides were just okay, nothing to write home about.  Then there was the meat. This is probably the one thing that definitely prevents me from wanting to come back here. When ordering the meat for a table for 2, you can only have your meat cooked one way! Its really a shame that you force people to choose and have at least one person end up unhappy.  You have one person who likes the meat rare and still kickin and the other medium well! I mean seriously, anyone who knows the difference knows that its a huge difference! Well being the one to compromise,  we settled for medium, which the server kept saying there'd be some pink. There was definitely no pink. The lamb was gamey, chicken was over cooked. The beef was mediocre at best. Overall not something I hope to experience again...",0.9305,0.787,0.125,0.088,0.5736111111111111

I liked the atmosphere, the food, and the waitstaff.  For the ""all you can eat"" menu, I thought the price was much more reasonable than other Brazilian steak houses, but the format of the service was poor.   They rushed us through the first few courses, but then after the first serving of meat, service basically stopped.  We were offered more potatoes, but getting more meat was like puling teeth.  They stopped busing the table too, leaving a full salad serving plate next to a partially filled one, I guess just trying to trick us into thinking we'd had plenty?   I wonder if it would be different with just two people, but, the food wasn't spectacular enough that I think I'd try, considering the price price point and the manner in which they serve the customers. I would've paid an extra $10 to have an actual ""all you can eat"" experience, and I guess will next time, somewhere else!",0.2471,0.895,0.057,0.048,0.43366666666666653

2011-04-28,4.0,"I've been saving my Groupon for this place till I had a super-eater to go with -- didn't want to waste it on a tiny appetite.  As a result, it got almost to expiration, and in a hurry to use it I ended up going there last night with my mom who eats like a bird.  I read multiple reviews prior to going -- they ranged from satisfaction to really poor service, so I adjusted my expectations accordingly.  Well, I'm happy to report -- Al Primo Canto stood up to the higher end of the reviews and then some! Tuesday night: only a few tables occupied, but I made a res just in case (as suggested by Groupon).  We were warmly greeted, promptly seated by the window, and very well served.  We opted for family-style so that we could sample a wider array of their dishes.  Everything was very good -- especially tiny cheese-stuffed rolls, garlicky eggplant puree (later used it as a sauce for the meat, soooo delish!), beef, lamb, garlic pasta and fresh salad!  The chicken was on the salty side, and I didn't care much for potatoes or pasta marinara.  Our server Hugo was very attentive -- he noticed the unsure look on mom's face when the meat seemed too red, and right away offered to bring another plate just for her -- well-done!  (and the plate was there very quickly).   The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is when I got a check, they took the liberty of adding 18% tip on the full amount.  I only accept the restaurant adding the tip themselves for a party of 5+, so in this case -- I know, they were probably afraid that they would get a tip on the discounted amount or who knows what... but I was planning to leave my standard 20% on pre-Groupon amount, and when I saw the added 18%...  well, I just left it at that.  But it did snuff out some of my enthusiasm about the place -- it's like them suspecting me of not being classy enough to tip normally...  But otherwise -- yummy, good service and pretty good ambiance overall!",0.9948,0.788,0.172,0.04,0.5137823129251702
2011-04-10,2.0,"Service - poor. We asked the server to pace our dishes since we were talking and drinking wine. 5 clock pm, there were plenty of empty tables, no need to rush. He did not pace - brought all the after a short time and was very defensive when we complained. The owner was called and was very sweet and tried to apologize. I would not go back, although I really wanted to like this restaurant! Food - hit and miss. Pasta was below average, salty and the tomato sauce seemed to come from a can. Meat was good. I actually think that my friends who did not have the all-you-can-eat ate better. Pão de queijo was dry, hard and cold. The polenta was amazing though! Price - too expensive for the irregular food and poor service. The waiter made sure he told us that 18% would be added as a tip, since we were using coupons.

2011-04-10,2.0,"I have to assume that this place remains in business because of Groupon, Living Social and various coupon sites which make it seem like a great deal.  I support small businesses, so I figured I would give it a shot.  I made a huge mistake.  Suffice to say, my meat loving fiance hated it, too. The servers were average.  While the space is lovely, you don't shell out $30 a person for decor. What was completely unacceptable was the quality of the food.  While the caponata was good, you aren't going to write home about an eggplant puree, particularly when the cooks in the back have assaulted everything else on the menu with so much salt that it was on the verge of being inedible at times.  Three fettuccines came out - the marinara one was food service grade, like they had poured bottled sauce over some noodles.  The garlic offering was oversalted - the mushroom sauce was the only one that was even edible.  While this place bills itself as a galetaria - but the meats were unimpressive.  As indicated above, my fiance is a carnivore - he was looking forward to the meat course, hoping redemption was coming after the fettuccine.  I don't think I have ever seen him so disappointed over dead animals, or leave a meat restaurant unsated - until tonight. To try and save our evening, we ordered dessert.  We went safe - creme brulee.  Even the simplest of desserts was too much for this establishment.  It was soup - tepid, unset and unacceptable - and we didn't eat a bite.  And did the server care?  Not a bit.   Other reviewers seem charmed with the non family style menu; maybe the chefs take care with those plates - however, I would not recommend partaking in the family style menu.",0.7793,0.777,0.125,0.098,0.4892857142857143

2011-04-03,4.0,"This is a rather unassuming storefront property but once you walk in and see the vaulted ceiling you are transported to another location.  I lived in Brazil for a year and found this simple tasty food to be very representative of the food I ate nearly every day in the outskirts of Brasilia - though we had rice not pasta in Brazil, I'm not complaining. The service was very friendly and professional though a tad slow - one waiter worked a half full room but this was a big room so I could see he was moving fast.  The drinks are pricey but all cocktails in the city limits are. My husband and I ordered the $30 all you can eat deal and everything came out timely and was seasoned nicely.  The pao de queijo was perhaps a tad overbaked as they shouldn't be brown - it makes them tough.  I did especially like the mushroom pasta and the garlic pasta but really didn't want to fill up.  The meat is what is best here.  Chicken, lamb and beef.  Seasoned nicely, cut into user friendly pieces.  Loved it.  Simple and tasty. What I especially liked about this place, versus places like Fogo De Chao where there is this crazy frenzy of consumption and gauchos with spears attacking you at every given moment - this was three choices served family style upon request.  Much more relaxing.  And frankly, a little wait time on an all you can eat is a good thing.  I didn't feel nauseous when I left. We did share the flan that was also slightly over cooked as it was bubbled on the sides and it should be smooth.

2011-04-03,1.0,"My Dude and I don't get out often now that we have the mini-Dude. My Mom has generously offered to watch our kid once a month so we can get out and be grownups for a night. She also gave us a Groupon to Al Primo Canto. What a Mom, right?  She had the best of intentions...  We made a 7:00 reservation for last night (Saturday). We walked in on time and were sat right away. We were also pretty much simultaneously sat with the two tables next to us. We were giddy about being out and about like grownups and made friendly chit-chat with the couple sitting next to us. We ordered the all you can eat dinner and a bottle of wine and waited for the goodness to arrive.  10 minutes passed.  The table next to us got their pasta course.  Another table across from us was sat.  10 minutes passed... the table across from us got their pasta course.  We asked the waiter where OUR pasta course was. He said it would be right out.  10 minutes passed.  20 minutes passed.  The tables around us were all brought their meat courses.  After sitting for 50 minutes, we finally asked the waiter where our pasta was. He said ""Oh, the pasta is cooking, the owner is coming to talk to you"".  Great!  Not great. The owner came over and we pointed out that everyone around us that ordered at the same time was all on their meat course and we hadn't even had our pasta yet. He said, and I quote, ""Oh, here is your pasta now, you'd better eat it before it gets cold, I'll come back to deal with this later"".  Sounds great! Who wants to eat cold pasta?  Another employee (I won't say who because I don't want to get them in trouble) leaned over and said, ""good for you for complaining, everyone is almost done eating and you're just now getting your pasta"".  Right?  The meat dragged. Everything dragged. The table next to us was sat with a new couple (mind you, because even though the first couple was sat at the same time as we were, they were finished and paid up before we even got our meat) and they had a confrontation with the same waiter about their service. They complained that the chicken was a little overdone and the waiter said to them ""That's how we cook our chicken, I'm not going to serve you raw chicken"" and dismissively waved his hands at them. We all met eyes and raised our eyebrows. Seriously, the service was so bad it was something out of a sitcom.  We finished our meats and asked for more chicken. We waited 20 minutes. We asked again and waited some more. Eventually, we realized no more chicken was coming and that's just how it was. I guess ""all you can eat"" REALLY means ""all we'll serve you"". At that point, we had been there two hours and we just needed to get the Hell out of there.  The check came. No apologies. Just.... the check. We waited 5 minutes to see if the owner was coming back to talk to us like he said he would.  No owner. So, we asked to speak with him again.  My Dude said, very, very calmly, I might add, ""We just wanted to tell you that while the food was delicious, the service was terrible, and your handling of the situation by saying 'eat your pasta before it gets cold' was not how you should deal with customers"".  The owner flew off the handle and went on a rant that consisted mostly of him shouting at us, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?! WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?!"" in a very, very loud, angry and confrontational manner. My Dude said, very calmly, ""is this how you talk to your customers? Don't you want them to come back to your restaurant?""  Then he POUNDED his hand on the table and said ""I DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU, GET OUT OF MY RESTAURANT, NOW!"".  That's right, kids. We got thrown out of the restaurant. I have never, EVER been thrown out of a restaurant in my 32 years of dining out in Chicago.  As we were exiting, we were cheered on by the tables around us. The guy sitting next to us who had the confrontation with the waiter over chicken said ""Good for you guys, you guys have a great weekend"" and another employee said ""You all have yourselves a great night, good for you for speaking up for yourselves!"". Ah, see, it wasn't just us that noticed the absolutely horrible service then.  I grew up in Edgebrook and I'm completely embarrassed for the neighborhood that this is the way a business owner treats customers. After being at a restaurant for 2 hours and getting absolutely piss poor service, we were not offered A SINGLE apology. That's all we wanted, not a percentage off our bill, not a comped glass of wine. Just an apology. Instead, we were screamed at and then tossed out for voicing our opinion about the service. I cannot emphasize how much I implore you to think twice about patronizing this establishment.  There are too many more wonderful restaurants out there to waste your time here.",0.9829,0.843,0.089,0.068,0.5340461182010479

2011-01-31,3.0,"So while out in Des Plains, my husband and I decided that we might as well get something to eat to avoid the evening rush. It was 430 and we didn't want to fight the major traffic to go back south. We couldn't decide on where to go so I grabbed my ipod and checked out my living social app. Al Primo canto was like 10 minutes from where we were, so away we go. Where to start, well parking was cool. There is parking available out front. Paid parking of course. (remember this is Chicago) Even though it was rush hour, that wasn't a problem. We found parking directly across the street from the place. The place was beautiful. It was dimly lit and playing soft music. Our waiter came over and greeted us warmly. I explained that we wanted to use a living social certificate and it seemed the waiter was more excited. He asked if we ever dined here and I said no but I have been to a couple of Brazilian steakhouses before. He informed me that they had some similarities but they were slightly different. He told us that we could use the deal for a la carte menu and the all you can eat. (had 2 vouchers) So I opted for the all you can eat and my husband order the new york strip. The review is for my all you can eat experience, I didn't try my husband's food. The first thing I was served was the pasta. (trying to lay off the bread, so I can't comment cause I didn't try it) The pasta was decent. I liked the garlic especially. But I was wondering, where was the seasoning? The garlic was good but it needed a little work. The marinara was plain as hell. It needed salt, pepper, oregano, basil, etc. I understand that everyone doesn't eat salt but come on! There are other ways to flavor the food besides salt. So I mixed a little of the garlic with the marinara and it wasn't that bad. The next up was the meat. I had the lamb, chicken and beef. One taste of the beef and I knew I wasn't gonna eat it. One it was tough and two, it had NO seasoning again. I tasted the chicken and it was OK. Again no seasoning and it was slightly overcooked. The lamb was the best thing I had. Even though it had no seasoning, it was very tender. A salad also came with the meat. The salad was AMAZING. It needed nothing. It had the right amount of dressing and it was SO fresh. So I ate all the salad and some of the lamb. Don't know how you could get the salad right and not the meat? Hmmmm........ Also some crunchy potatoes were served. They were really good too. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience.  But if I had to pay the full price, I probably would be upset.

We had some yummy bruschettas and a calamari app served in a sauce (not my choice, just going with the wishes of the table).  I had the rigatoni with a creamy red sauce w/ a load of sausage and just enough peas for sweetness.  My wife had the lobster ravioli that she couldn't stop raving about.  Others at the table seemed to enjoy their huge steaks and sea bass. Maybe I'm getting old fashioned but I really like when the manager comes by and actually chats with you about your meal, she even showed us a computer printout of the forthcoming menu (I'm definitely going to check out one of the new risottos).  For dessert, we split a banana cake slice, others were licking the spoons of a hot guava concoction. We paid the the bill, chatted more with the friendly manager then rolled our fat bellies home. A good time was had by all and I cant wait to go back.",0.9942,0.802,0.191,0.008,0.5575151515151515
2011-01-25,3.0,"Came here for an all you can eat dinner for 29.95! I have to say though, compared to other Brazilian steakhouses, this place is sub par. The salad was very good, the pastas were a bit oily and the meats were ok. One piece of chicken my friend tried to eat, still had blood in it. Service was great, but the food (for the all you can eat) could have been better. One person in our group got he NY strip steak, delicious, we were all envious.  We came back again another night and had the NY strip again and the Pork. Different server this time and when he brought us our steak, it looked totally different from what it did the initial night we came here! there was an amazing sauce and scallops and shrimp on it this time. Better than the first time we had it, we asked him about why it was different and he joked that we should only come on the nights that he's working. The pork tenderlois was divine. It came on a bed of mashed potatoes and caramalized asparagus and pearl onions. DELICIOUS! better than the steak I would say. Portions are HUGE, You'll never finish their dishes unless you're doing the all you can eat. Prices are very reasonable for the portions they provide. Meter parking in front isn't too hard to come by.  Good place for big groups, they have specials daily. Wednesday is .10 glasses of wine! Can't beat that.",0.9948,0.801,0.19,0.009,0.5754166666666666

We went with the all you can eat so we could get a little taste of everything.  The cheese bread was hot and fresh.  The pasta dishes felt a little out of place, but the mushroom sauce was outstanding.  Some of our chicken was a little dry, but it had great flavor and really crispy skin.  YUM!  The beef and lamb were great as well.  We did have some problem getting the meat cooked properly, but I won't dock them because of that, it still tasted great.  The green beans that came with the meat were simple and cooked perfectly. My only complaint was that they were out of tres leches cake, but our waitress gave us a round of free cachaca shots so that shut us up pretty quick!

I have to say, I am really surprised to see all of the bad reviews about this restaurant. I ate there last night with my cousin and her boyfriend, they eat there often and LOVE IT.  When we walked in, we were greeted warmly by the hostess, she sat us with a smile and was super friendly (and beautiful). A staff member then came immediately to see if we would like a drink and to bring the menus & provide specials for the evening.  I had the ""All you can eat"" dinner. It was SPECTACULAR.  You receive an amazing eggplant dip right away (we must have had 7 orders, no joke).  You then receive a salad, the meal, which includes, Beef, chicken, lamb (i skipped the lamb), delicious green beans, polenta, potato pieces with dip, 3 kinds of fantastic pasta (my fave was the mushroom and olive oil, 5 orders...)  The desert was AMAZING, the best Tres Leches cake, banana cake & chocolate mousse cake! :)  The reason I did not give a 5 star review is because our server brought the check before we asked for it, said ""I'll take this whenever you are ready"" didn't ask if we wanted anything else (and my cousin wanted another drink) and then left before we could say anything. when we finally got her attention to order the drink, she took back the check to add the drink, instead of bringing the drink on the house in acknowledgment of her faux-pas and poor judgment (the bill was BIG, we ate x 3, drank x 6 and had desert x 3 ), and then, brought the wrong drink (for the 2nd time that evening), then, disappeared with the check for a really long time when we really were ready for it.  That was really our only gripe. All of the other servers were super friendly. She was OK, but not great and needs to be told that you do not bring the check unless asked and if you do bring it over on your own, before putting it on the table and saying ""I'll take that when ever you are ready"", and walk away immediately, ask if the table would like anything else first.

2010-11-28,2.0,"So my friend and I really wanted to fall in love with this place, but at the end of the night i just couldn't. Let's start with the goods; we walked into an absolutely stunning open dining room that was elegant and lively. Beautiful decorations and a huge wine rack on one side. We were seated immediately (it was a Sunday evening) and met by an incredibly kind and knowledgeable server. We had intended on using a  livingsocial.com  coupon for the all-you-can-eat special (normally 29.99) for 15, but our server, Desiree, described the evening specials so beautifully, we wanted to try some. So she kindly suggested that one of get the all-you-can-eat and the other get a special of the day. Whether this is a normal policy or whether she was giving us special treatment, I don't care, she made me feel like a star! Haha. We ordered a bottle of Desiree's favorite malbec and everything seemed to be going fantastic right? Wrong. The first course of the all-you-can-eat came out, cheese bread, pita, and a roast eggplant dip. It was good, but nothing special. The pita was cold and seemed directly from the package. And the cheese bread had no flavor and could very well have been a hot pocket minus all the delicious chemical cheese and meats. Next was a pasta course, marinara, garlic and mushroom sauces. After sampling these three-- the marinara and mushroom were unimpressive and the garlic was somewhat tasty (emphasis on ""somewhat"")-- I started to have a sad and suspicious feeling: this is wedding food. Not great, not bad, but mass-produced and stock, nothing exciting, nothing original. That feeling dominated through the salad course (bland and predictable) and into the main course chicken, beef and lamb. I guess we got to have all three main courses on the menu, instead of at a wedding where you are forced to choose the least of 3 or 4 boring entrees. To be fair the lamb was quite tasty and the fried polenta was certainly a bright spot, but the beef was dry and over cooked and the chicken screamed ""MEH!!!!"" Even the special we went with, a mango glazed duck, tasted like it was straight from the heated cabinets of the white eagle banquet hall or something. The glaze was too sweet and candy-like and completely over powered the natural flavor of the duck. All in all the food was rather bland and uninspired. The flavors were safe and predictable. I realized halfway through the meal I was trying so hard to like it, but after a while I just couldn't. And what really was disappointing was that my wine ended up being too spicy and dry for my taste, not a fault of anyone, but just tacked on a giant sad face to the end of a disappointing evening. Let me be balanced here and say I cant say enough about the wonderful, attentive service. The decor is lovely. I really really wish I could have fallen in love with this unique family-owned edgebrook establishment, but at the end of the day I couldn't. Even with the 30 dollar discount we still dropped almost $100 that night for food that wasn't any more thoughtful than the local dinner or applebees. In fact, I'd rather have went with either of those over Al Primo Canto.  I still had a fun evening, but it pains me to say I probably will not be returning to Al Primo Canto anytime soon.",0.9985,0.675,0.228,0.096,0.6328007518796994
2010-11-21,1.0,"We came here because we bought a $55 groupon.  This place was very underwhelming and extremely over-priced. We ordered the all you can eat set fare, and the bread that comes first was over-cooked and flavorless. The eggplant puree was not terrible, but nothing special at all. They bring three different types of pasta dishes out, all of which were terrible.  They only put a tiny bit of a sauce on each of the three types of pastas, which is fine if the sauce has a lot of flavor, these did not.  Plus, the mushrooms looked they were fresh, fresh out of the can. The salad had pretty good dressing, but it was all spinach, no vegetables and no other types of lettuce. The Polenta wasn't bad, compared to how bad everything else was, but again nothing special. As for the meat, I would say the meat was decent.  We had to ask several times for them to bring more of it out, but that was mainly because they bring about four small slices out each time (not enough even for just a table of 3).

For starters they brought out the little balls of cheese bread which had no flavor. I had seen the Check Please review and was really looking forward to them. I don't know if they forgot an ingredient or what but they were so bland. The eggplant puree was delicious I could have licked the plate.  The three pastas. I don't really understand having pasta here but if its included mine as well eat it. I'll start with the good. The oil and garlic was good I love toasted garlic, the marinara tasted bland and the mushroom pasta well lets just say before I even tried it I said to my friend ""Canned Mushrooms!!!""  And then everything came to the table.  Salad - Was one of my favorite plates of the whole meal. It was simple but the vinaigrette they used was delicious.  Polenta - I love polenta I did not like these. Very bland.  Potatoes - Good thing thing they had a dip for them because they were pretty dried out.  Meat - I really enjoyed all the meat.  Beef was good and although we asked for medium there was not a touch of pink but it was ok because it was still delicious.  Lamb was cooked much more to our liking and was also very good but lacked some of that lamb flavor I love so much.  Chicken I know many have said the chicken was dry but even with that the flavor was still good and I still enjoyed it. The crispy skin was delicious.  There were some green beans on the plate with the lamb and beef that were also quite delicious.  Since it was my friends birthday we had dessert. They brought him out a little piece of flan which he wonder if it was rice pudding. I tried it and was not a fan. That said he did finish the whole thing.  I had the tirimisu and it was great. I loved it.  Our waitress and the staff there were great. Everyone from the host the waitress to our attentive bus boys who were happy to get plates out of the way and the waitress when we needed her.

We started out with sauteed shrimps in garlic sauce, ricotta & maca e brie bruchetta.  Our kids enjoyed the shrimps while wife and I thought the bruchettas were pretty good.  Along with a bottle of pinot grigio, we ordered grilled beef tenderloin, gaucho styled chicken with a side order of brazilian rice with beans while our kids shared an order of fusilli pasta with chicken for entrees.  Beef was ok, a little dry.  Chicken wasn't bad except the breast and thigh part could've had crispier skin and more flavor. Rice was pretty good except the beans tasted like they were right out of the can with all the slippery saucy texture which made it unpleasant.  Kids liked the pasta.  When I looked around, I saw that most people were having the all-you-can-eat and the the meat dishes that we ordered were same as theirs.  So basically we're getting the same food from their buffet selection.  For dessert, we had the soft centered guava cake(romeo e juliet) which was very good.

2010-10-18,2.0,"Went here on Friday night around 7pm. I didn't really care too much for this place. We did they all you can eat for $29 Atmosphere: Clean, exposed brick walls and somewhat modern decor. Tables are too close together and for some reason they had the air on too high! I am not one to complain about this at all but when its 50 degrees out it made it really uncomfortable.  Staff: pleasant but moved really slow Food: The all you can eat consisted of cheese bread, Eggplant olive oil dip, Pasta, Salad, Lamb and Beef Medallions, Spit Roasted Chicken on bone and Fried Polenta.  CHEESE BREAD: was really good. It was made from a combination of different cheeses and Yucca. EGGPLANT OLIVE OIL DIP: Was OK. I am not a huge fan of Eggplant but the rest of my group liked it. POTATOS: Good, nothing special. They were your typical Olive Oil and Rosemary wedges. SALAD: Was also OK. a mix of greens with a sweet honey mustard dressing. FRIED P0LENTA: Really filling, something different and tasted OK. So, at this point you must be thinking ""it seems as if you liked everything"" The items above were pretty much just OK and did not blow me away. on to Main courses. Portions came out family style and were also small. It was all you can eat but With a party of 4 the food went really quick which is fine if our Waitress would have come back to our table! The time in between bringing more food was REALLY, REALLY slow. It was not crazy busy either. LAMB MEDALLIONS:  Not a huge lamb fan and they were just OK BEEF TENDERLOIN MEDALLIONS: It was tender but again just OK. It seemed as if it had no flavor. It needed some sort of sauce or something. CHICKEN: Had a ton of spices on it, was a bit dry and lacked meat.  PATSA (Linguini, Garlic and Marinara) You are supposed to be a Brazilian Steak place don't bring me Pasta.  BOTTOM LINE: Atmosphere was nice, staff was pleasant but really slow. Food was just OK at best. This was not a celebration of meats it was a celebration of trying to get me filled up so I don't eat so much of your lackluster small portions of ""Wedding Quality"" Beef and Lamb. When I was done I felt like  I took the money I spent and threw it right into the trash. This place was not that good. Spend your time and money elsewhere. There are better places in Chicago. I could have paid $30 and got better meat at Outback Steakhouse. Lesson learned. If you want steak, go to a Steakhouse.

2010-06-17,4.0,"A friend and I have been trying to find a date to get to this place for months now.  She had a  restaurant.com  coupon she wanted to use, and I've been curious about the restaurant since I go past it whenever we come up to the Chocolate Shoppe.  Finally, we got there on a Wednesday night, and that was a great choice because there was no waiting for a table or service. I think the best thing I can do is make a list of pros and cons for this place to explain why, though I have mixed feelings about it, I generally liked it and would definitely go back.  Let's go with the cons first and get them out of the way so I can end on the high notes: -- The chicken, which is the signature dish was a little dry.  Not enough to be really unhappy with it, but definitely a little dry. -- The tables were too high for the chairs. -- Everyone who came in seemed to get seated in the same area.  In a big restaurant, that's kind of a no-no, in my opinion  Separate diners by one table at least, so they don't have to listen to other people's noise. -- Service was either very good or very slow.  They were fantastically attentive with the food, but our water glasses went unfilled after the first round. Okay, now the pros: -- Really good food.  And honestly, this is one of the bottom lines for me.  I won't put up with a lot of nonsense for good food, but I will put up with a lot of what I mentioned above.  The chicken had seasoning which made me chow down on the skin.  Ask anyone who knows me; I don't do that!  The garlic pasta was heavenly, with perfectly cooked garlic.  The mushroom pasta was a delight.  The polenta was delicious as were the crispy potatoes.  The beef was tasty and very tender. -- Friendly service.  Yes it could be spotty, but these are some of the nicest people you could ever want to talk to, and that makes up for a lot.   -- Nice looking place.  A pleasure to be in a big, open, airy room. -- Music at the right volume. Okay, so here are some pointers:  If you go with a coupon, they will add an 18% tip onto the bill based on the price you would have paid without the coupon.  Fair enough.  Don't look for salt and pepper on the table.  You'll have to ask, but frankly I don't think you'll need to.  Everything was well-seasoned.   But I have to say that I think there is too much food on the all-you-can-eat menu.  Now, I don't eat lamb, and if I'd noticed that it was being served, I'd have told them to forget it.  But they brought a plate filled with both lamb and beef, of which we ate about half the beef and none of the lamb.  Just too much.  And because it's served family style, you can't take it home with you and they have to toss whatever is left.  I hate seeing waste like that.  However, I know people who could have polished off everything they brought and asked for more, so I would say that unless you have at least one really big eater in your party, don't go for the all-you-can-eat.  There's more than enough on the a la carte menu, which is how I'll be ordering next time. Yeah, I'm going back.  I liked the place, I liked the people and I liked the food.",0.9979,0.81,0.158,0.032,0.5188561350466112

My boyfriend ordered the pork tenderloin and I ordered the beef tenderloin.   Both meats were prepared well and were pretty tasty.  The portions of the meat were adequate but the portion of the sides were meager.  I had about six little wedges of a roasted potatoe and maybe 1/2 cup of veggies (nothing special about them).   We ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert and it was very good.    Ok, so the bread and bruschetta was something we could pass on but we thought we might come back another time and do the pre fixe.

The second course were three plates of piled high pasta in three different sauces. I could not believe we were sitting there eating cold noodles for about 20 minutes. FINALLY the meat came out. They served us a plate of cold lamb and beef cuts accompanied by a decent mixed green salad, fried polenta, chicken and roasted potatoes. To put it simply the meat was dry, no flavor what so ever, cold as ice. The chicken was dry. The sides were decent, but I forced down the meat since I was paying $30 a person for that.

Our waiter was pleasant too.  Since he later mentioned that he was new, I'll spare this review the details about  our delayed food. They very graciously apologized and gave us free dessert.  The feast? Meh. It definitely isn't up to par with Fogo de Chao or Zed 451. It was like a budget style version of a churrascaria. Different price point usually equals different quality, so I can't say I was mad about it.  Having been to Brazil, I was looking forward to the pan de queso (cheese bread) however, it didn't taste like what I remembered so that was a little disappointing. Sure, the polenta sticks were good, but nothing stood out for me; it was just okay. We left half the meat b/c most of it was too pink. Rather than send it back for what we'd originally requested (med-well to well done), we just ate what we could. We went one round and didn't even eat all of it.  I agree with a lot of the other reviews in that it is a little conversation challenged and the seats are fairly close. It was that bad though. The highlight was the band! They had us groovin' Brazillian style and then wrapped the night up with classic jazz/pop tunes.  Customer service goes a long way with me--even when the food isn't  ""blow-your-mind"".

2010-01-08,5.0,"Lets fast forward to 3 years later after my first review of Al Primo Canto and was happy to see that the place is still on top of their game.  While I love CHECK PLEASE - sometimes the additional fame is not always a welcomed one. My family (wife+4yr old - minus the 1.5yr old - one thing you learn as a parent, if you go to a restaurant that has sharp steak knives, it's best to leave little hands w/ a sitter) went for dinner at 7:30pm on a Friday night.  I was afraid that since it was a weekend night - there would be a wait, but luckily it was the Friday after the snowpocalypse of 2010, so needless to day - the snow and cold probably kept a lot of people from going out, so we were seated immediate by the hostess/owner.  This is the first time I've been back since my last review, so I was pleasantly surprised by a live band that was set up by the bar. We were greeted immediately by our server (I believe her name was Angela) and was able to order drinks immediately.  My 4 yr old is shy - I mean REALLY SHY.  So within a matter of minutes, the hostess/owner stopped by and presented her w/ her own little chef's hat.  Luckily we also carry a couple of crayons, so my daughter was now very busy decorating her new hat. After review of the menu (which has expanded to al carte, and seafood dishes since my first review which only consisted of the feast) my wife and opted for the feast - even though the specials sounded wonderful (chilean sea bass, and NY strip). We started off pita and what I think was hummus - whatever it was, it was good - and little cheese bread/puffs, which was a hit w/ my daughter. The first dishes was the pasta - which has not change (the fungi, olio, and tomato).  This time, the olio was my favorite - good amount of garlic.  My daughter loved the fungi, and the marinara ... is well ... marinara.  I give great credit to service because they immediately noticed that my daughter was going to have difficulty using her fork w/ the pasta and got us small spoons for her to use before she even started to eat. The second course was the was the rest of the feast - the chicken, lamb, beef, palenta, potatoes, and small mixed salad.  We went w/ the meats as suggested - a medium rare (we like it on the bloody side) and it came just as that.  It was moist, and very tender.  The chicken was roasted to perfection - it was moist and very flavorful.  It was a big hit w/ my daughter. Our water glass was never empty, and was checked on frequently for refills on our drinks.  The bartender actually noticed that my daughter's juice was low, and was already waiting to refill it as my daughter was drinking the last drop. Dessert - when I last visited - the dessert menu was limited, and they did not have coffee.  I am so happy that has changed.  They had me at ""banana foster"" cheescake, and after listening to the owner describe the chocolate fudge cake earlier in the night, I knew I had to get some of that.  There was only one problem - they ran out of the cake.  We stuck w/ the cheesecake - and it was wonderful, and to make it even better - I had my cup of coffee to go w/ it. The night did end w/ a small down note, but picked back up immediately after - we had a RESTAURANTS.COM certificate, but in the fine print it says remaining balance needed to be paid in cash (that'll teach me to hit the cash station first) and it was going to expire that day I was dining, but all I had was my credit card.  It wasn't that big of a deal for me to use it, so I told them to not worry about it and I was still going to use my credit card.  When the owner heard that I had the certificate and that it was going to expire - she came over, and initialed the certificate and said they'll honor it the next time we come in. Coming from a family where everyone worked in the restaurant business, we completely appreciated how warm and inviting the owners/service were to us, and especially to guests that have children.",0.9975,0.813,0.14,0.047,0.5048963792055897

The cheese bread was disappointingly hard on the outside and overly gooey on the inside without being flavorful or cheesy; the eggplant dip was weird; the marinara pasta was boring and cafeteria-quality; the chicken was dry and unflavorful; and the beef and lamb were overly done (though we asked for medium-- and when we asked for another batch closer to medium, it came out bloody and rare!).

I've been wanting to go here for quite some time after hearing nothing but good things about this place, but unfortunately my experience was awful.  There were less than 5 people in the entire restaurant besides my friend and I  but that didn't stop the staff from being slow as molasses with our food.  The three pastas we started with were pretty good, my favorite being the one with fresh garlic and extra virgin olive oil, but that's where they lost me.  Of the three meats that you get with the $29.95 feast that my friend and I both ordered, the chicken was the worst.  It was as dry as the Mojave Desert, clearly leftover and reheated from the day before.  The lamb was cooked perfectly enough for me to ask for another portion,  which I did but not to the liking of our server who rudely said  ""well I suppose so""...........WTF???  My favorite part of the whole meal besides the lamb was the salad and polenta, which I've never had before, it was just scrumptious. Do yourself a favor and skip this place........it's highly over-rated. I wish I could give it only 1/2 a star because that's all it deserves !!",0.9717,0.677,0.2,0.123,0.6484090909090908

2009-04-14,1.0,"We dined here on Good Friday at 7pm. The place was half empty. There was four in our party. After the rave reviews on Check please and wanted to check it out. We were all very disappointed with the food and the service. You have an option of and All you can eat menu for 29.95 or you order off the regular menu . 3 of the 4 went for the all you eat option. First of all they only bring out tiny portions and when you ask for more they look annoyed. One of the servers tried to clear the plates after the first plates of meat were brought out.. When the meat meat came out, the portion would barely feed one person let alone 3 people. I had the seafood platter which was nothing more than an 8oz piece of fish with a couple of shrimp and scallops and it cost over $30. it was fine but definitely not a platter and not worth $30. The over all service was very rushed. 2 people ordered desserts and one had to be sent back because it was frozen, the other was super cold/hard also but edible. The hostess who later told us was the owner and also the pastry chef for the restaurant explained that they serve all of their deserts as a frozen ice cream consistency????? it was chocolate cake and cheesecake which makes no sense. She did apologize that we had to send it back. Before we had an opportunity to ask anything else the check was left on the table. We were planning on ordering another bottle of wine. The hostess asked how everything was and when we told her we felt rushed she again apologised and sent out a bottle of champagne. The waiter then proceeded to come back to our table and insisted that he did ask if we wanted anything and no one answered. That is a lie. We were all waiting to order the bottle of wine, so that was just not true. From that point every time he came to the table he was pouting and acted very unprofessional. I would not go back. I thought it was way over priced. Our check was $250. There are many other fine steak houses in Chicago which are far superior to this one.",0.8871,0.863,0.083,0.055,0.40712898212898213
2009-04-11,2.0,"Save your money and avoid this one.  My husband and I along with another couple were looking forward to dining at Al Primo Canto after seeing it reviewed on ""Check Please!"". We made reservations, although the restaurant remained half-full during the time we were there (7 pm). Our waiter was initially very friendly and definitely knew his wine, helping us make selections. Three of us ordered the all-you-can-eat, while the fourth ordered a seafood platter special for around 32.00.  We had fairly high expectations, as we frequent columbian and argentinian steak houses often.  The meal was presented very fast in courses, with the cheese bread and babajanoush arriving first. The dip was very garlicky and tasty and the bread was fine. The pasta followed, tasting like it was re-heated. The presentation was bad and the sauces were light, with the mushroom pasta basically being noodles tossed with a bit of spice and bits of mushroom. The meat arrived last and was enough for around two people, even though three were eating. I will say that the lamb and beef were cooked as we had ordered and were flavorful. The chicken was okay, but a bit on the dry side with legs and thighs served only.  We ordered meat a second time, only to recieved an additional three small slices. Then, the waiter attempted to have our plates cleared. When we stated we were ordering more meat, he looked annoyed and brought another three slices.  They immediately cleared our plates again. We then ordered chocolate cake and apple cheesecake for dessert, but had to send the cheesecake back due to it being frozen. The cake appeared to be from a box and was also part frozen. There was not a wait for tables for the duration of the time we were there, so we were ready to order a third bottle of wine. However, the check was dropped on the table before we could ask.  The manager/hostess came by at the end to ask how our meal was, and we informed her of the cheesecake and rushed service. She apologized and stated that she was ""personally the pastry chef"" and that the waitstaff is ment to inform the patrons that desserts are served at ""ice cream consistency"". What!? I've never heard of ice cream cheesecake before. She offered us a round of champagne, which was nice, although the waiter returned to argue with us that he HAD asked us if we wanted anything else before dropping the check. What a waste of 250.00.

2009-03-28,5.0,"This isn't your typical Brazillian meat-o-rama. The specialty is the chicken, marinated for 24 hours and cooked rotisserie style over charcoal. Their signature dish is the feast, which comes in courses. The first course consists of warm cheese-rolls and pita bread with baba ganoush. Then comes the pasta: one with marinara sauce, one with olive oil and garlic, and one with mushrooms. The mushroom pasta is amazing. The main course is a salad with a light and tasty dressing, three meats (chicken, lamb, and beef), fried polenta, and potatoes with roquefort cheese. Utterly amazing. There's also a fantastic wine list and a full bar. The atmosphere is great: a large, expansive dining room with beautiful wood trusses in the ceiling and a huge wine rack on one of the exposed brick walls. They're very kid-friendly as well. On Sundays, there's a brunch which is quite good as well. We've never ordered à la carte, just the feast described above. It's a good value and it's basically all you can eat.

I guess it is still within the city of Chicago, though I have no idea what neighborhood it's in. I like getting out and exploring, so this was definitely not a problem. The restaurant itself is pretty cool inside. They really did a nice job with the space. Me and my girlfriend both had the feast which is $30 per person and they bring you bread and a garliky eggplant dip that was very tasty to start, then they bring you three plates of fetuccini with three different sauces. They were all pretty bland and just filler. I would skip this step altogether next time. Then comes the meat. A plate with lamb and beef, one with chicken and three sides. Fried polenta, potatoes and salad. Everything we ate (other than the pasta) was pretty good, nothing was exeptional. The service was very friendly and attentive. I doubt that I will be making the trip back to this place. It is too far out of the way and the food, though good,  simply wasn't anything special.

Luckily, last night, there was only us three and a family of four dining.  It was Tony and Tamia's second time eating here. They came here last year with Tony's sister. So, Tony was set on what to order (their 3 course dinner). They start you off with a hummus/dill/extra virgin olive oil dip served with pita bread on the side. It was light and delicious. After that they came out with three different pasta dishes (mushroom, garlic, and ragu). Tamia literally ate up all the mushroom pasta by herself. Tony and I would have to agree with her that the mushroom pasta was the best out of the three pasta dishes. 10 minutes after the pasta dishes were brought out they came out with a mixed italian green salad, baked potatoes, fried polenta, steak and lamb over green beans and roasted chicken. It was overwhelming but so delicious! I love how every dish complimented one another. The meat were cooked to perfection. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The salad went well with all three different meats. It was quite the experience. $30 for a person for a 3 course meal isn't bad at all. Tony and I were full so we had the server wrap everything up to go. Tamia ended her meal with a slice of their chocolate cake. It was moist and delicious.  I highly doubt I would bring Tamia back here on a night that their are busy.

2009-02-21,2.0,"We decided to got try this place 1) because it was our 10 year anniversary (OMG!) and 2) I had a $25 off $50 coupon for this place from  restaurants.com  and 3) the review on Check Please a few weeks back seemed like it was worth a shot. The setting was nice, the tables were a bit squished together which I didn't really care for because both me and my husband are a bit soft spoken and it's hard to have a conversation when tables close around have a bunch of loud people. There was a live band playing on the other side of the restaurant. It was nice. I could understand based on some of the other reviews how it could be loud, if you were seated right next to the band. But our distance was not loud at all. The server was nice. We ordered a couple drinks while we looked over the menu. My husband ordered the all you can eat and I ordered the chicken (from recommendations from yelp). We were hoping that we would be sipping on our drinks and chatting for a bit before we were served. As it was our anniversary, we wanted to have a romantic time. However, about 2 minutes after the menus got taken away, my husband was presented with 3 plates of pasta, a basket of bread and some hummus. A few minutes later my salad I ordered was presented.  I am not sure why they give you pasta first on the all you can eat. Probably because they want you to fill up on it before being served the meat, which is the more expensive stuff. The salad I had was great. I think it was a palm salad. I had I think palm stalks in it. It had great flavor. The bread basket has these cheese type bread puffs that were delicious. Also, the hummus was great as well. My husband thought it was a bit too oily. My husband said the only good pasta was the mushroom. The other 2 were marinara and oil. Next came out the main courses. I was still wanting to savor my salad, but had to move on. Presented to me were a few pieces of chicken, roasted potatoes and vegetables. The chicken wasn't as good as I had hoped; it was a little dry and lacked flavor. I thought that I could probably get a juicier, better tasting chicken from Jewel for $4.99. The potatoes looked and tasted weird, kind of like maybe they were frozen. The vegetables tasted frozen as well. Presented to my husband was his main course. Roasted potatoes with a blue cheese sauce. Lamb, steak, and chicken. Polenta's and his salad. He noted that all the meats were just okay, a bit dry. The polenta's were interesting tasting, pretty good. We didn't have desert. To drink I ordered a few mojito's that were good.  Overall the experience was not that great. I wasn't impressed with the food at all. It was expensive for the quality. The all you can eat was $30 and the chicken entree was I think $15 or $17, the salad $9. I felt rushed through the meal, which I did not like. I think the concept of all you can eat is somewhat neat, but if the food is not that great, then it's not really worth it.

I should have known that there was going to be problems when we made our reservation a week ago, and they never called to confirm. When I called on Friday to confirm they had no record of me and said that they couldn't seat us till 10:00. I had already cancelled other reservations that I had made and told them that this was unacceptable. They did work with me and got me in at 8:30.  Upon arrival it was clear that they still didn't have us in their book, however they seated us right away. Then we waited. We waited some more. We had no menu, no water- nothing. After about 20 minutes, I went to the hostess and informed her that we didn't even have a menu. She did apologize and eventually someone brought us a menu and some water.  My husband and I ordered the feast for $30 a person. We told them up front that we wanted one order of beef medium rare and one medium well. When the food came, we only got the medium rare and we had to wait another 30-40 minutes for the medium well- not to mention I had to ask for my waiter 3 times plus the manager before he came.  I had a Brazilian Merlot that was recommended- it was OK, but tasted like a $3 glass and not a $9 glass of wine.  The food was just OK, and was not what I remembered it to be. I did like the garlic pasta and the flan.  All and all it was not a good experience and I will not be returning. The owner clearly saw that I was upset but yet they did nothing to compensate for it. I do understand that it was Valentine's Day and they said there computer was down, but what does that have to do with getting a simple menu and a waiter to greet us?  Lastly, they had music, but it was so loud I couldn't talk and it gave me a headache. Our waiter had to yell over it.

Many of the choices were non-traditional for brunch, but they do serve pancakes, fruit, smoked salmon, breakfast meats and omelets made-to-order (mine was quite tasty). They also offer several Italian-influenced salads and cheeses, roasted potatoes, fried polenta sticks and the beans that I can't remember how to spell (sorry). I never thought I would eat at a Brazilian restaurant since they seem so meat-intesive, but I was more than satisfied with the food choices and flavors we discovered.

This is a very nice Brazilian steakhouse with quite reasonable prices.  The $30 feast includes excellent lamb and beef and so so chicken.  In addtion, you get a nice appetizer of ""caponata"" which actually turns out to be baba ghanouj plus three kinds of fettucine, roasted potatoes, green beans and baby onions, green salad,  and very tasty fried polenta.  They do try to stuff you a bit on the starches so be careful if you want to have room for more steak and lamb.  They have a reasonable wine list with a lot of South American offerings. Their regular a la carte menu offers fish and some more items plus the items on the feast.  While I'd like to see a little more authenticity and meat cut fresh at the table, for the price I'd definitely recommend it.  We ordered two dessert specials, mocha flan and coconut flan, both of which were wonderful.  For a Brazilian restaurant however, I thought the coffee left a bit to be desired. Service was nice if a bit hovering.  Decor is very pretty with rustic beamed ceilings.  However, we sat by the window and were very cold.  Their landlord would do them a favor if he let them brick up parts of the large storefront findows that give a rather fishbowl feel to the place. In general, a worthwile addition to Edgebrook and a nice place to go.",0.9883,0.84,0.152,0.008,0.5700170519136035
2007-11-20,4.0,"After going there once and them not opening on time and completely ignoring us waiting outside, my boyfriend and I decided to giver it another try since we had a  restaurant.com  certificate. Overall, we had a good experience there.  It took them a bit to give us menus but the hostess (and apparently the owner) noticed and made sure the waiter came very soon and made very pleasant conversation with us. The food was very good for the price - not a normal Brazilian steakhouse but for $30 a person we got the ""endless feast"" where they brought out bread and eggplant appetizer, pasta (with 3 different sauces), and then the main dishes all came out together - various pieces of steak, chicken, lamb, potatoes, polenta, and green beans.  The polenta wasn't very good and the potatoes were kind of dry (though they did come with a dip to help with this).  The pastas and meats were very good.  The service was also very good and our server in particular was very nice.",0.9868,0.806,0.183,0.011,0.592415458937198
2007-11-18,3.0,"Went here with a bunch of friends last night and was pleasantly surprised. First off, you have to understand that this is NOT fogo de chao.  Fogo is one of my favorite restaurants, and the excitement of having the gauchos walking around and a seemingly endless (immediate) supply of meat is indescribable. Al Primo Canto's dinner operated at a much slower pace.  We went in there expecting meat, meat, meat...but we had to wait until the very end of our dinner before the meat started coming.  The pasta was great, so was the salad...but we had come there looking for meat. Once it arrived, there were often longer breaks than we would have preferred between the time we had finished our meat and the time the next plates of meat would come out. The atmosphere is great, the lamb is exceptional...and I think as long as you don't go in here expecting the standard service you'd get at Fogo de Chao or any of the other similar restaurants...you'll be okay. It's not bad...just different. The staff was very attentive, friendly and perhaps next time we go there, we'll order off the standard menu instead of the $29 all you can eat.",0.9796,0.871,0.129,0.0,0.44125
2007-11-03,3.0,"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about Al Primo Canto. Its like, they have all the right ingredients, but something is off somewhere.   First off, the decor is incredible.  How they could transform this cheezy beater storefront on Devon (that was empty forever) into this imaginative, airy place I will never know.  You gotta peek in just to see the kick-ass wood ceiling.   I order the Maminha, which was beef tenderloin served with potatoes and vegetables.  The meat was excellent - two thumbs up for that!  The potatoes were average but the vegetables were terrible!  It was kale, broccoli and carrots, but everything was bitter and dark, like they had sat around in the pot too long.   BF ordered the ""endless feast"" - a massive 12 course meal that included 4 kinds of meat and a wide variety of vegetables & pasta.  He was very pleased at what he got, but was not able to finish everything.  I did sneak a taste of some of the meats and I think my beef was better.   Service was decent, but they brought the endless feast out in two batches which loaded up the table.  Also, noone told us which dish was which, so we spent the whole time saying ""well, I think this is lamb""  ""are you sure?  it tastes like pork to me"".  Also, because he couldnt eat everything at once, most of the dishes became cold fast.  This was a bit disappointing.   While I am pleased that more restaurants are being attracted to this neigborhood, for what we paid at Al Primo Canto I think I might hold off on going again for a while.  Maybe once they are more established things will be better.",0.9782,0.816,0.133,0.051,0.6390500992063493
2007-08-31,4.0,"This place needs to be discovered  - the wait staff is excellent, and the food is very good at a price 1/2 that of typical ""Brazilian Steakhouses"".  My wife and I dined here on a Friday, and were seated at a nice window seat. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and menu, and provided a nice accompaniment the whole evening. Ah the food... all courses were at a minimum ""very good"" to ""excellent"" in some cases. Excellent would apply to both the lamb and chicken, which were both moist, well flavored, and delicious.  As the few Brazilian Steakhouses I've visited simply hand you a bill of $60 / person and an unholy amount of food, Al Primo Canto was half that ($29), and still provided more than enough food. I'll take quality over quantity any day, and I really liked the uniqueness of the family style preparation vs. the standard Brazilian steakhouse. And perhaps in response to some of the critiques, the price is listed prominently on the menu outside the restaurant, and our server  quickly told us this as well. Also, the new news is that the will soon offer both the standard multi-course $29/person meal as well as an a la carte menu. Overall, very good food, great wait staff, and an excellent addition to the Edgebrook neighborhood.",0.9927,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.5952983920841064
