We ordered the tacos de barbacoa and it was very tasty and fulfilling. After, I ordered the enchiladas Sabinas with Guajillo sauce and that is the moment I remembered my grandmother and the enchiladas she would make. The service makes you feel like you are right at home with great hospitality, one thing Northern Mexico is known for is the small town, warm hospitality and they really do live up to that.

2017-01-11,3.0,"I had such high hopes about this restaurant after many of my friends recommended it. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as I believed.  Let me start off with the good: As soon as I walked in I felt like I had just stepped into a classic Mexican Western. The decor was a beautiful rustic and you get a ""homey"" feel when you're there. Clearly a staple of Mexican culture. The welcome I received was by an older man who had the warmest eyes and was kind. He let us pick our table which I appreciated. We had a party of 3 + baby. I went to get the baby chair myself, but they were all dirty from previous guests I assumed. Babies are messy eaters so I think I speak for all mothers when I say, we expect the booster chairs to be sanitized, at least be wiped down.  Then my dad picked to sit in the most lopsided table ever, of course I spilled my coffee... (it was amazingly hot which I love, except for when it's on my lap). The food was good, well mine was at least. I had pork ribs in sauce and they were exquisite. I can't complain about my dish. My dad and brother complained about the food two days later. Apparently they both had a case of diarrhea and they think it was the refried beans. Thankfully I didn't have refried beans, but baby did and also had a diarrhea during the night. I'm so glad he was pushing my dad's hand away when he was giving him beans, I think he knew better. Lol. Since we all have separate households that's the only food in common they ate that we thought made everyone sick. Then our bill comes along. I went to register to pay. And they have such an outdated register and charging manner that I don't even know if it they have it set up on purpose to go along with the rustic mexico décor or if they just genuinely don't care about what they charge customers. There was a man arguing with the manager about his bill, saying he was being over charged. They sorted the pricing and she refunded some money. Well my turn comes around and I see the total, I notice it's off based on my calculations. It was because she decided to charge me a double dish as well! When I called her out on it, she said she was sorry but it was waitresses fault. I don't even want to imagine that each customer gets overcharged but only a few of us notice and say something. They don't even give you an itemized receipt. I just got the cc total receipt.  All in all. I have mixed feelings about this place. I probably would never go out my way to visit again but if I'm in the neighborhood I wouldn't mind the pork ribs again.",0.9666,0.8,0.121,0.079,0.5243340234644582

2015-06-21,5.0,"I have been coming to Nuevo León since I was little. Its located on 26st and Lawndale in Little Village aka Little Mexico, the largest Mexican Community in the Midwest. Im VERY proud to be from this neighborhood because when you want TRUE AUTHENTIC Mexican Food, you come to Little Village. Nuevo Leon has been a staple in our community for decades and the restaurant took off so well, that the brothers decided to open a second restaurant in neighboring, Pilsen, and the brothers went on their separate ways, business wise.  As Pilsen starting changing, prompted that owner to ""remodel"".  When you come to little village, its a basic restaurant. Its a five star cuisine on a 2 star budget. Thats as honest as I can be. Its not as gruesome as things, Ive heard about the pilsen, and its wayyy different. Anyone thats talks bad about a place, but goes 3 or 4 times, I question their reviews.  This place has a cozy feeling and has a nice room for events and also does catering. Weekends they have kareokee as well as sometimes they will have Mariachi. I just noticed they have ""Cabrito de Monterrey"", sorry but I will pass on that! When you order, you will be brought a free little individual appetizer. Sometimes it will be a sample of beef meat with red mild sauce with a small tortilla, sometimes its consume which is a soup. After your finished, your brought your dessert. Nothing fancy, sometimes its warm baked sweet potato in its own syrup, sometimes its a fruit salad. Its free and nowadays, places dont do this, let alone for free. I think its the owners nice touch.  This place is know  for their platillos. My favorite is the tampiqueña. It has a half order (you can order a full order of meat which is huge or you can order half order of meat), comes with a carne asada (I ask for mine medium well, also comes with one suiza enchilada de queso, guacamole, potatos, grilled onions soooo good, and their famous yummy refried beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. Their horchatas are awesome n of course have liquor, beer and soda and mexican sodas and freshly squeezed juices. When you come, be open minded and enjoy a traditional mexican meal in a mexican family owned restaurant.

2012-07-30,3.0,"So, this is my third or fourth time eating here and I have to say that this place is a bit over hyped.  I ordered the taco platter with two carne asada and one chorizo taco, pretty standard mexican dish.  My wife had the camarones in a fajita type style.   First, my dish was ok but I do have a gripe or two. The dishes were very greasy.  I know most mexican places are not going to skimping on the fat but it would be nice not to get the tortillas of my tacos bathed in grease.  Also, the refried beans had way too much lard, I could've baked a pie crust with them.  That being said, the tacos and beans were fairly tasty but nothing to write home about.   The horchata was decent too but they served it with almost no ice, which is kinda weird in the middle of the hellishly hot summer we've been having (same thing with the water too, maybe their ice machine was on the fritz).  My wife had the shrimp, which came in like a fajita style.  Again it was served up with a good dollop of grease, not as much as my tacos though. And it also was overcooked a bit because all the vegetables were somewhat mushy, almost stewed. The ingredients did seem fairly fresh though, too bad they did not maximize that on the plate. The taste was also pretty good, at least my wife enjoyed it.   The service was also quite spotty.  It was nice getting a complimentary appetizer, beans and carne with a tortilla, as we sat down.  But then our waitress at the end overcharged us a bit for what we had.  She promptly adjusted it when we told her though.  But that wasn't too surprising when I could see her looking over at our table at the end and trying to remember and add up what we had in her head (maybe next time write it down at the get go). She also was mia, especially at the end when we were ready to get out of there. She was preoccupied getting the forks and knives ready for the next days service. So overall, this last experience was my worst. Yet having been there a few times I know it is not typically that bad but it has never been very memorable either. There prices are pretty good, although I'd be happy to pay a bit more if they could improve what they put on the table.

2011-02-27,5.0,"To begin with, the partner and I went to 18th street to have something Mexican. We went to El Milagro but he wanted something with waitresses and nice atmosphere, and El Milagro is just a fast kitchen type restaurant, but still awesome food in my opinion.  First thing you notice when you enter Nuevo Leon is the plethora of Mexican art murals depicting the various Mexican area's in beautiful colors. One would wonder where the connection of artifacts and music in the background connects to this particular restaurant, but honestly who cares, it's one of the hottest spots for Mexican food; two of the greatest things ever wrapped into one!  This place scores a 5 on atmosphere alone, but it's a restaurant so let's leave the overall score up to the food.  Our meal started with the typical Mexican fare of Chips and Salsa (complimentary) so we ordered the Queso Fundido (which is a chihuahua cheese melted with chili chiles and green peppers. At first I was like, uh oh it's hardening really fast, but when I tasted it, honestly I almost passed out with the nice and sweet flavored cheese.   My gosh this was enough for 4 so since we were two, we took some home.  He had the birria (goat meat) with rice and beans and of course I gravitated towards the Chili Rellenos. The waitress was nice enough to say I could have a cheese and the other can also be a ground beef mixture. Good lord these rellenos were wonderful, again they had queso fundido (melted cheese) and it added the right texture to the perfectly battered and seasoned chiles. The beans were like my (dearly departed) grandmas and I knew it was going to be a good day after this. And most Mexican restaurants we go to always have SUPER loud music in the background which stops conversation, but this place had the music on, but low enough to have great talk. I totally can appreciate that.  I highly recommend this place if you want something SUPER AUTHENTIC, and as a finicky latino who loves his latin foods, this is as good as it gets. SERIOUSLY! I use to frequent this place back in the early 90's and I so wasn't disappointed in the least. For $32 with appetizer, coffee, home made tortillas, chips, salsa, queso fundido and here goes, the waitress at the end brought us dessert! It consisted of apples, granola, raisins, a yogurt with mangos. Oh my god they took me back and I will be returning, She so deserved that TIP for real.",0.9988,0.752,0.224,0.024,0.5160512129380056
2011-01-22,5.0,"Just ate a Nuevo Leon yesterday for lunch at the food was amazing and reasonable! The kitchy, Mexican decor welcomes you in with warm arms and the chef prepares a daily amuse bouche and homemade chips w/ multiple home made salsas. And at the end of the meal we were served complimentary homemade rice pudding! My friends and I shared the chicken enchiladas w/ verde sauce and steak fajitas- both better than all of the Mexican I've tried in the city and cheaper! I would be here bi-weekly if it wasn't so far south for car-less  me to get to. Highly Highly Recommend! Also, I have been to the original Nuevo Leon in Pilsen a few times. Also very good and closer... it was opened 50 years ago. He had 2 sons, one owns and runs this location and his brother took over the original one. The sauces here are different  (better different) and I like the open layout of this one more.",0.9872,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.508095238095238
2010-08-31,5.0,"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago. Food is always spot on, service is super friendly and fast, and atmosphere is all Mexican. Sometimes the owners are there, and they sit and chat with you for a bit. The carne asada is always superb. Definitely a  must try for a mexican restaurant in Chicago. A definite recommendation.",0.9584,0.725,0.275,0.0,0.5242424242424243
2009-10-16,4.0,"I was actually in the mood for a hotdog when I was kidnapped and dragged here. Just kidding - that sounds like a prelude to a bad review which this is certainly NOT. I am actually always up for Mexican, or any Latin American food.  We sat down and immediately served chips, three kinds of salsa, pickled veggies and soup on the house. After the meal we were given rice pudding on the house. That's how the did it when I was in Mexico - complimentary goodies and friendly service. Gotta love it! You have to know a little Spanish when looking at the menu because most of the entree titles dont give explanation. I knew what I was ordering but I'm sure if I had questions our waitress would have happily explain. I had a tasty combination plate with an enchilada topped with the best mole sauce ever!  $25.00 for two entrees, a beer, iced tea and horchata. Not too shabby!",0.9701,0.822,0.157,0.02,0.39629629629629626
2007-09-23,3.0,"Not bad. We ate there because the odd wicker seats were so inviting. We all ate something different and nobody complained. The service was kind and easy on us gringos. With beers, dinner was $12 each. Not bad.",-0.4037,0.593,0.178,0.229,0.5880952380952381
