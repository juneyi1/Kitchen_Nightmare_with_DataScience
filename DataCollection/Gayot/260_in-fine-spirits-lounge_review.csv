2012-02-29,2.0,"I would like to preface by saying that this review is from my last experience with service and atmosphere. If you wanna know how the drinks are, they're friggin great. Buuuuut...........  I came in after a really hard day, looking forward to have a delicious cocktail. Music from my absolute favorite band was playing on the speakers, and I got a nice seat at the bar. I thought that was a good sign...but I was sorely mistaken. Holy crap, I couldn't have been more ignored if I tried. Now I must admit, I probably had an ""I've had a shitty day"" look, but wouldn't that make it more obvious that I came here expecting be put *in fine spirits*?!?! I was left sitting at the bar without a menu for an insufferable length of time, to the point where I actually considered walking out. I've only done that twice in my life. I've been here a couple of times before with my husband, and it was amazing. The cocktails are out-of-control delicious and finely nuanced, and I always had friendly *and attentive* bartenders and servers. While I was pondering how none of this made sense, FINALLY, a menu. I chose my favorite from the last time I had been there. As I watched her make it, I admired everything that went into it and the certain way it had to be stirred just right and the zing of citrus zest oil that topped it off. The cocktail was wonderful and I savored the hell out of it, perusing the menu for a nice follow-up. But then, it seemed as if my bartender had completely forgotten about me, and I was left in another awkward uncomfortable silence with no drink. They weren't overly busy, and I watched her make another round of drinks for the couple next to me, but she never even glanced sideways at me. It's a nice place, I shouldn't have to call your attention to the fact that I've finished my drink. It was a looooooooong uncomfortable silence with no drink. And I'm a patient person. The other bartender must have seen how put off I looked and offered to make me another cocktail. At least he was relatively attentive. Still, he was more interested in schmoozing with the other couples on his side of the bar. I've gone to bars solo at many places in this city, and usually, the bartender will at least be friendly enough to have a little conversation with me. Not here. Left with a bad taste in my mouth, which was really disappointing, considering how good the drinks had been.",0.9815,0.768,0.144,0.088,0.5943171608265947
2012-02-26,2.0,"Meh is right. The attitude is River North ""are you sure you are worthy enough to come in here?"" with prices to match but the place itself is strictly second-tier suburb.  I am a fan of wine bars and beer bars. I have never seen a ""wine bar"" with a smaller selection of wines than this place. The cocktail, beer, and food selections are similarly miniscule and show no real sense of adventure or sophistication. The spouse and I were looking for a cool drink or two and a small plate. We labored to find anything appealing drink-wise and passed entirely on the unimaginative food offerings. The table next to us (and I mean RIGHT next to us, we could have eaten off their plates) received very little food for the money asked, so we were glad we skipped it. Her cocktail and my wine were shopping mall chain restaurant quality. This place is operating on volume, shoe-horning the customers into tiny tables. The service is abysmal and rude.

2012-01-06,5.0,"I had a terribly stressful day yesterday - I had to go to the spa, get a massage, then go to In Fine Spirits for wine and dinner. Allow me to shed a single tear of self pity. Moving on. My experience at In Fine Spirits was absolutely perfect. I sat at the bar and was greeted with sparkling mineral water (gratis) and extensive yet unintimidating wine and food menus. The bartender (Cody?) was charming and very knowledgeable, and entertaining with shaker/stirrer/fancy mixing tricks to boot.  I am dieting so am being very careful with menu choices - there was plenty to accommodate. I started with a beet salad paired with a winter white flight - delicious. It was light but somehow still wintery, the flavor combinations in the salad were so complimentary to each other and the wines I felt very proud of myself for my choice. When Cody took my very empty plate he grinned and said, ""Ah, I see you hated it. I hate it too."" See, funny. I moved on to a big, bold, Bordeaux blend recommended to pair with the polenta. See ya later, I'm gone, I'm toast. The wine I renamed ""Sybil"" because it transformed deliciously with every sip - a LOT of engaging personalities. The polenta was a nice little piece, I appreciated the small portion size esp. after the salad. It was a perfect texture of silky yet not mushy, crispy on the outside and smooth inside. It was covered with a deliciously savory heirloom tomato marmalade that complimented both the polenta and the many faces of my Bordeaux perfectly. The atmosphere was relaxed yet sophisticated, as is much of Andersonville these days, and I love it. I read a book but it would have been easy to strike up a conversation with the guy to my left or girl to my right if I felt conversational. I'll be back.

During this visit, we didn't even get acknowledged and had to walk out.  When I did dine here, the food itself was decent enough, but then again how can you really screw up cheeses and flatbreads?  I do enjoy a place to grab a simple bite to share and a glass a wine, so I guess I should try this place again when it's not so crazy so I can see if the service is any better.",0.5759,0.814,0.099,0.086,0.5898809523809524

That being said, I am sad that I will probably never go back. The fact is, this place is not a good value. I don't mind paying $25 for a minimalist meat/cheese platter, but to only give one piece of bread for two people and then charge a dollar for an extra piece of bread? That's just ridiculous and, in my opinion, unforgivable. Also, the last two times I went the service was really lacking and our waitress (the most recent time I went) had absolutely NO knowledge of the wine list and therefore was not helpful in recommending anything.

2011-07-02,5.0,"The cocktail menu at In Fine Spirits has its own section, which isn't out of the ordinary when it comes to menus. The different section *means* something here, though, even though they don't say so: Cocktails here are their own course, and are almost more important than the traditional, or food-based courses. The care that goes into them makes every drop worth the (admittedly kind of steep) price. If your funds are unlimited I recommend spending several days ordering every cocktail on the menu. If your funds are not unlimited I recommend ordering three cocktails, by which time it is very likely you will have forgotten your funds are not unlimited. Which will set you right up for ordering the food, which is also pretty substantially not cheap, but which IFS creates with every bit of care, and which turns out every bit as awesome. I have not had a single bite of food here I didn't Love, with a capital L. All their ingredients come from local sources, and either you can taste the difference or the drinks are potent enough that you'll think you can. So take heart!

If pressed for a reason why, I would say BECAUSE IT'S A BAR. There are tons of appropriate, kid-friendly locations mere feet from IFS. Go to one or several of them. And please don't throw the term ""Discriminated against"" around when you're among the privileged enough class to be eating at IFS. You're not humping back to the Warsaw Ghetto, people. You're trying to take an infant or toddler someplace where none of the chairs are short enough for a kid's feet to touch the ground. You should take that as a hint.

I had always thought of In Fine Spirits as a wine bar, but last night when I finally got to try IFS I found out that they have everything! They have craft cocktails that are so much better than Violet Hour, Whistler, and the like; beer; wine; old school cocktails like Old Fashioned's and Sidecars; and even absinthe! As if that weren't enough, they have absinthe fountain service. What what?!? Just call me Vincent van Gogh and leave me to the green fairies.  I started with a Sidecar, which was good but a bit expensive. Then, since I have a bit of a cold, I went with the Cold Comfort - Pure Blue Vodka, Koval Ginger, honey, and lemon. It tasted like lemonade and went down really fast. Finally, I had a Moscow Mule that was delicious and tangy. The ginger ale was unlike any I have had before.  We also ordered a few small plates. Some where good and some were disappointing. Here's the rundown:  The leek flat bread was delicious, but too small. It was the size of a pita and not enough for our table to share.  The medjool dates were delicious and resting on a lovely little bed of coppa. Be careful, though! These suckers were too hot to eat right away.  The tartiflette was a big disappointment. The menu describes it as a ""bubbling crock of bacon, potato and raclette cheese, with bread for dipping."" Sounds amazing, right? Meh. It was a big crock of mashed potatoes with chives, ""ghost bacon"" that we could taste but not see, and a weird slab of not quite melty cheese. Also, the roll given to dip in the 'taters was too small for the amount of potatoes in the crock. They were average, but not as good as they sounded on the menu.  The duck confit roulette was good. It was piled on top of a layer of chunky apricot mostarda that really complimented the duck.  And finally, the chocolate mousse torte, which was rich and decadent, with a delicious, mouth watering brown sugar and pecan crust and covered with brandy drenched berries.

2011-01-06,4.0,"Much like official government reports re: camel suicides in Afghanistan, my last review had many glaring holes. Mainly, the food. But I'm happy to report that - like my own personal WikiLeaks - the truth is finally ready to come out. Mostly, because I finally got the chance to stop by for dinner. You all know my undying love of IFS's craft cocktails (mmm, Sazerac) - and I was DELIGHTED to find out that Mondays offer $5 specialty pours of some of select wines, beers and tipples. Oh yeah! But I added a big piece to the glutinous puzzle when we came by for dinner last Monday. Like others have said, the food was absolutely tops. We had a delicious red cabbage and duck confit salad (like Anne Hathaway - perfectly dressed), white bean flatbread (almost an ode to pita and hummus), the crispy gnocchi and pork cheek ragout (mmm... just, mMMMm) and the Tartfellete (an ungodly good French version of 'beer cheese soup' with potatoes). Absolutely. Tops. So here's the kicker: they say it up front, but these really are ""small plates"". When I usually get a 'flatbread', I tend to expect a small pizza... this was more like four pieces of pita. Even the more expensive, main-dish type orders (like the gnocchi) were very small. The good news is, everything is so delicious and rich that you end up filling up, despite the small size.  The small plates are actually perfect for a place centered on the drinks. Everything just serves as a perfect nibbling accompaniment to the cocktails. So, in context, the menu is perfect. I would just advise against anyone who's looking to come here for a big meal.

Lately, I've been obsessing over their Sidecar (brandy, triple sec, simple syrup and lemon juice with a sugared rim glass) which is DEEEELICIOUS!!!!  Thank god they give you the extra in a small wine decanting glass because otherwise it would run out too fast.  Last time, instead of having two Sidecars, I followed one with a Vierre Carre, a NOLA Brandy cocktail with rye, benedictine and vermouth)--definitely much stronger (you don't get extra 'cause you don't need it) and that was wonderful as well.   We also had a yummy mixed greens salad with a brown butter dressing that had a duck confit in it.  Talk about a rich salad.  Very good.  We went to dinner elsewhere because I'm still not convinced that In Fine Spirits deserves my dollars for a full meal.  But for excellent wines, beers and cocktails, this place will remain a staple for us.",0.9929,0.751,0.223,0.026,0.4552380952380953

Maybe people like sour mix?  Hey, I guess beauty is in the eye of the imbiber.   The weather was great so we settled in at a table on the patio, expecting to have some wine and maybe a few snacks.  But then it happened, our server handed me a very delicious looking list of cocktails.  OK, that was a game changer.  As I mentioned, though, I'm a little cautious.  So I started asking questions.  Our server indulged me for a few minutes and then finally just told me that the bartender is awesome and to trust her.  So I started with a Spice of Life.  And it didn't disappoint.  Delightfully spicy, yet well balanced.  Next thing I knew, it was gone and I moved on to a heavier hitter, my favorite, a manhattan.  Perfect.  Yum. Now on to the food.  We ordered the chef's favorite cheese & charcuterie selection.  None of the items were hard to find or exotic, but delicious nonetheless and served with warm bread.  We felt like we needed at least a little health to our dinner so we went with some beets and asparagus...and some scallops too.  Everything came with ricotta, which as I mentioned, everything is better with cheese, but interesting that it was on everything.  Our selections were tasty, especially the scallops that were salty goodness prepared perfectly.

If you choose to get a cocktail off their extensive menu, you're looking at about 10 dollars, which is totally reasonable for chicago prices.  The old-tymer is my absolute favorite, although I think I've tasted the vast majority of their specialty cocktails and have found them all to be intriguing and delicious.  Only once did I get one of the monday night cocktails that I didn't like.  But I sent it back and they were happy to give me a different drink.

2010-09-26,3.0,"This is a beer review by iSpyBeerGuy. The bar at In Fine Spirits (IFS), located next door to the eponymous beer and wine store, is a hip, bustling neighborhood spot. It is firstly a wine bar, with a serious and distinctive wine list and excellent tasting flights. IFS regularly pairs free tastings next door with special events at the bar, sometimes featuring the vinyards' principals.  Still, in addition to wine, craft cocktails and light bistro fare, beer lovers are rewarded with an above average selection of canned and bottled beers and one cask ale draft. It is the firkin, a nine-gallon cask featuring fresh unfiltered and unpasteurized beer, that makes IFS unique and worth following in a neighborhood with more than a few extended beer lists.  On recent visits, the firkin - served at cellar temperature and available in 3 oz. or 10 oz. pours - added nuance to Bell's Two Hearted Ale and Three Floyds' Moloko Plus Milk Stout. The selections are rotated a little to infrequently for this reviewer, but I still appreciate the choice of drinking fresh cask ale at the bar.  IFS also offers a rotating selection of excellent canned beers, highlighting the growing number of craft breweries which seek to turn the popular notion of canned beer on its head. Recently they've offered Ska Brewing Company's Modus Hoperandi, True Blonde and ESB; Anderson Valley Brewing Company's Amber Ale; Capital Brewing Company's Supper Club Lager and several more. On Wednesdays, craft cans and the cask ale are $3. The focus on craft cans is a cool approach fit for the moment, though a true beer lover will undoubtedly sigh at the absence of draft beers, beyond the firkin. The bottle list is good (Three Floyds, Stone, Left Hand, Lagunitas, Moylan's, Founders and Bell's in addition to some international beers), but it doesn't make up for seeing an assortment of tap handles behind the bar.  Instead, I'll recommend the wine, the enclosed outdoor patio, and the firkin. Drafts or not, In Fine Spirits Lounge is worth a visit.

It was a Tuesday evening and we got there early so we were the first table. Loved the complimentary filtered and fizzy water. The wine list looked interesting, but I decided on a cocktail. I ended up having two  - one with gin that I can't remember the ingredients of and the Rye on Rye which mixed Founder's Red Rye Ale with Templeton rye whiskey and was a great nod to summer's ending. We had a mixed opions of the food. Generally liked the items they sourced (cheese, olives) and didn't like the items they prepared (the tartiflette was too starchy with flour and potatoes and the dates could have used a stronger/saltier blue cheese to stand up to the fruit's sweetness).  Our server was fine, but it was hard to catch her eye when we needed something and she had her purse slung over her shoulder the entire time which made it seem like she had someplace better to be.

Then, I had the gnocchi which was so fresh it could only have been homemade.  It was some of the best gnocchi I've ever had, & the ratatouille was lovely as well.  My husband had the chicken sausage flat bread (hey, it was $5 flatbread day, so why not?), which he loved.  He solved the impossible-to-cut dilemma by picking the whole thng up to eat.  Luckily, it's pretty small (maybe 5"") so it wasn't too unweildy.   We finished up our evening with a cheese plate & that was fabulous.  We love our cheese, and that was a terrific way to end our meal.  They don't have a huge cheese menu, but the selections they did have were very nice.

2010-07-23,5.0,"I LOVE this place. I have lived in Andersonville for a year now, but have yet to check it out. While I love wine, I'm always hesitant of ""wine bars"" because of the often pretentious attitudes that accompany the offerings. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I ventured inside last week on a date night with my boyfriend. We were graciously greeted by our server, who offered us our choice of seats. (They have a really long, comfortable bar, a long row of high tops and a series of low top offerings to choose from.) He added that he hates being told where to sit and wanted us to be comfortable. ...A nice start to the evening. Then, we were offered sparkling water or still, without a difference in price. We really had come to sample some new wines, but ended up being enticed by the ""local farmers"" touted on the menu. It was a nice surprise! We tried the olives (always a good pick) and the chef's choice flight of cheese. It was amazing. Now, I grew up in Wisconsin and I feel like I KNOW my cheese. That said, I had the most phenomenal cheese ever. I absolutely loved it. Everything is served with a freshly baked, warm, soft, aromatic bread... I have so many descriptors because I didn't try it and it was killing me not to. It looked/smelled heavenly. The flights of wines and champagnes are original and really tasty. We had some questions about our wine selections and the servers were eager to help us out, without making us feel subhuman for not being experts on the different varietals. The atmosphere was dark, and bustling. As the night went on, it became a bit loud... not obnoxiously so, however. It was just ""happening."" The clientele is a comfortable mix of hipster and professional. They played great music, and not just typical jazz that you'd hear at any other wine bar. I remember hearing Bob Dylan and commented about it being unexpected, but a really nice compliment to the night. I'd go more for the wine, with the food being an unexpected ""extra."" The food menu is small in comparison to the drink menu. However, everything that they offered was definitely high quality, well-thought out, and delicious.

2010-07-18,2.0,"I think my first time here is going to be my last.  The food, for the portions was way overpriced, and the service wasn't the best. I'll start out with the service:  We walked in and were greeted by blank stares from the two guys behind the bar.  There was no ""seat yourself"" or ""the hostess will be right out"" or anything of the sort.  So after a minute of just standing there, we took a table and sat down.  Our waitress appeared shortly after we'd already sat down.  She was nice and moderately efficient. She ran through the special, took our order (and gave me the necessary attention when I asked for no onions on my meal). THEN, when the appetizer came out (flat bread), it was covered in raw onions, which were NOT listed on the menu.  The guy (not the waitress) who brought out the flatbread was too fast to even wait for a reaction from me, so we had to wait for close to 10 minutes for this same guy to come back over (with the next plate of course) for me to complain.  When I told him I had requested no onions, this guy gave attitude, and replied defensively, ""those are SHALLOTS!""  Now, if it smells like an onion, is part of the same family as an onion, why would I accept it as a ""non-onion"" substitute?!  At any rate, as I was talking, he took the plate away and walked off.  Just rude. Our actual waitress came by a few minutes later and apologized, and seemed to mean it, so props to her.   Now, overall, the food was good, not the best I've had, but for the amount served, probably one of the more expensive portions.  Good thing this was with a groupon, otherwise I'd be much more annoyed.   So, do I recommend?  not based on service from the majority of the staff, and not based on cost.",0.7311,0.876,0.07,0.054,0.39421088171088164

I was not disappointed, the bloody mary was great.  They came with stuffed olives, lemon, lime and a cucumber slice.  The bartender convinced me to try the ""Swedish Mary,"" which was made with Aquavit instead of vodka.  It was pretty good as well and not what I expected, not aniseed-ish but just a little more spicy.  The Bloody marys were about 10 bucks each, a little steep, but worth it. I couldn't resist some charcuterie while I was there, and ordered some prosciutto, chorizo and aged cheddar cheese, (3 items for $15 +$1 for bread.)  The sausage and cheese was good, but I have had better.   It should be noted that they don't have any normal liquors, they have North Shore vodka, and Buffalo Trace whiskey.  If  you need Grey Goose or Jack Daniels, and who doesn't from time to time, this is NOT the place for you.

It was magical... then I realized it was probably an overhead light.  Seeing a friendly face as soon as I turned to my right brought a secondary smile because it was only after I got my first smile from the friendly hello and admiring the lovely and bright out lay of the land. A smattering of people were all around, but I spotted the one and only that I was here to see. We greeted, we hugged, we sat down and looked at each other... with only one thing on our minds... food? Yes. Please.  The stuffed dates were delicious with a pleasant surprise, nestled inside a slightly sweetened caramelized date was a sensual smattering of blue cheese and to fully balance it all out was a slice of prosciutto. Good morning Irene! Those were some tasty dates! Then we moved on to the chicken sausage flat bread. A very crispy, yet slightly soft and chewy bread with a spiced chicken sausage, asiago cheese and some spicy, peppery arugula. The combo all paired up well with the Spanish white I was having, the slightly sweet but crisp and refreshing helped to cool off the warm and slightly muggy air as well as the well seasoned treats we had.  Our server was busy but did her best to traipse over to us as often as we needed. Always a full carafe of ice cold water to help keep us hydrated. Price? Easy on the eyes.  I hate that this place is quite a bit of a distance from my home, as is much of Andersonville, but for a special friend, it is a distance worth traveling.

The wine was, well, wine from a place that knows wine. So, it was good.  Why just the two stars, you ask? The service. It was abominable, especially for a place that is not on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

He was literally walking away from the table, nodding a short & dismissive nod, as we spoke! Rude!!! Sad, sad little waiter sealed his fate with the tip due to his horrendous attitude.

I've been here three or four times, and while the cocktail list is not as extensive as the two aforementioned other places, there's enough variety to satisfy anyone's tastes.  The issues, though, are that the drinks are not as well thought out from the standpoint of flavor profiles as I've had elsewhere, and there's a huge continuum of discrepancy from one drink to the next, even if it's the same cocktail made by the same bartender. My biggest issue, though, had to be with service.  I'm not sure what was going on, but the last time I was there, my friend and I were seated at the bar, and were not approached for our order for at least 15 minutes.  It was a Saturday night, and they were above average on the busy scale, but there was a lot of socializing and downtime going on behind the bar.  My friend had a glass of wine, and I had a flight (a departure from my usual cocktail order), and once we were served we were totally ignored for the rest of the night.  It was strange, too, as everyone around us was getting served in a timely manner, but we couldn't get help.  I hate having to ask for service, but eventually we succumbed and asked for another round, this time a cocktail for my friend and a different wine flight for me.  I was given the wrong place card for my flight which was never corrected.  Not a big deal, really, but at this point the little things were starting to add up.  My friend ordered the caponata, which came with one roll.  She asked the bartender for more bread, which he got, but then asked one of the other servers ""who needed extra bread?"" as if he'd forgotten about us in the space of one minute.  So, we finished out caponata, cocktail, and flight, and then sat there with empty water glasses, empty drinks, and a clean plate for upwards of twenty minutes.  It wouldn't have bothered me had our bartender not been standing directly in front of us, unconcerned, not helping other guests, and seemingly staring off into space.  We would have happily ordered at least two more rounds, but we were starting to take the service a bit personally.  We asked for the check, and left (which, honestly, was the only expeditious service she and I received that evening).  I think I'll stick to the Violet Hour and the Drawing Room for craft cocktails from now on.",0.9697,0.845,0.095,0.06,0.4329106280193237

2010-03-28,4.0,"It's a Sunday afternoon.  I'm with my mom and aunt.  First thing that comes to mind?  Wine.  We got here like 15 minutes after they opened for the day and were able to get a table by the window which was nice.  Coming in here, I was in the mood for wine, but I saw this thing on their menu in the beer selection called a Firkin and it caught my eye.  A firkin is basically a quarter barrel that contains unfiltered and unpasteurized beer.  Unlike draft or keg beer, no Carbon Dioxide is added so all carbonation occurs naturally from the yeast in the beer.  I thought this was an interesting concept and asked our waitress for a taste of their current selection.  Not bad at all.  This kind of beer isn't served ice cold, however, and wasn't what I was in the mood for but I will give it another whirl next time.   I stuck to sparkling wines the rest of our time there- Cava and Prosecco.  I didn't try anything else but my mom and aunt tried quite a few of other white wines and we all thought they had a great selection.   We had just come from brunch and weren't too hungry however there were a couple things on the menu we wanted to try.  The kitchen, we found out, doesn't open until 5p (on Sundays, at least) which limited our options.  We tried the pickled farm egg, and that sounded pretty yuck to me, but it's not!  It's actually really good and our waitress had the chef write down the recipe and instructions for my mom so she can pickle her own eggs.  We also ordered a plate of olives and there was a good selection and they went quick.  Speaking of our waitress, Priscilla, she was totally cool.  It was obvious that she enjoys what she does there and it shows through her knowledge of the wine/spirits and everything else on the menu.  She was also very friendly, out going and on point with the service.   In Fine Spirits also uses fresh, local ingredients and they list all the farms that they work with on one of the chalk boards on the wall.   Overall, it was a great experience and I look forward to coming back in April to enjoy some wine on their patio!",0.9933,0.836,0.135,0.029,0.48884078884078885

Fortunately, I have been advised that another is on the way.  Its not as though I lacked other options, from Templeton Rye to an excellent selection of small batch bourbons.  Try a bourbon flight, or run through the whiskey cocktails, one by one. This visit was strictly liquid, but I look forward to returning to sample the extensive cheese and charcuterie selection, and report back on the wine list.  In Fine Spirits has the potential to be a great place for a long slow afternoon or evening of drinking and eating, but personally I find the tall tables and high banquette to hinder the bistro vibe in favor of hip lounge.  But I'm quibbling. IFS is also a victim of their own success - the space is quite popular and always crowded.  However, I hear they are expanding upstairs, which may provide good opportunities for lazy lounging on top of schmoozing and boozing.

They Almond did have a bit too much of the almond and walnut in it, but if that's what you like than go for it. Then to just try another, I had the Starting Manana with tequila in it, which I think I kind of liked more than the other two. To add to there great drinks, they've also got some nice foods too, mainly looking at the cheeses. For instance, the vintage gouda and aged cheddar were probably the best. I'd say avoid the smoked goat cheese. Other samples and dishes were nice too. The House flatbread was really good, and up there was the cheese flatbread. The olives, especially the greens, and the salami were something I could keep eating and wish I could get regularly. Service was actually really good for how many people were there on a Saturday night; very helpful. I'd definitely recommend going to this place instead of Violet Hour.

Warm apples, arugula, and farm cheese on chewy flatbread. Delicious. I ate far more than my fair share.  Next up: Winter Pickles. It IS winter. I LOVE pickles. Bring it on! For the pickle connoisseur, they tasted a lot like ""bread and butter"" pickles - my absolute favorite kind. They come in a little jar with onions as well. If I weren't in polite company, I would have up-ended the jar and slurped up every last drop.  As for the beverages, it's far more than wine. They also have impressive mixed drinks (Date-Boy had some combo that actually made gin taste good. That's saying a lot for me. I'm kinda anti-gin).

A real, classic perfectly-made gin martini. I tittered on about it for a good 15 minutes after it was brought to the table.

Let me not forget the service.  Chip, our waiter, was great - very friendly and very informative.  I walked away with the impression that the entire staff takes great pride in what they do.  We weren't just served drinks with a smile - anyone we spoke to was more than happy to educate us on what we were drinking and where it comes from.  All in all, everyone in our party had a great time.  I say come for the drinks, and stay for...the drinks!",0.9972,0.719,0.257,0.024,0.5984529505582137

What I love about their extensive drink list is that they obviously speak cocktail here.  From elegant classics to inventive moderns, the menu communicates a sense of knowledge and craft which I appreciate.   The other night I stopped in because I had recently read about a seasonal cocktail involving apple cider and bourbon--a combination which I frequently imbibe at home, but which I wanted to experience through the hand of an professional mixologist.  It turns out that the waitress had no idea what I was talking about, but she practically insisted on letting the head bartender ad-hoc something together for me.  The resulting drink was merely good but not great, but I really appreciated the willingness to do something special for a customer. APE-ricot (not APP-ricot) syrup made the Germania Club a little too sweet for me, but very good otherwise.  I tried two other drinks but none were as good as my beloved Sazerac.  However, I feel as if I could try almost every drink on the menu, or maybe someday the absinthe service.  The place balances classy and fun, and serves a great product.  That's pretty much all you need, right?

I love the charcuterie and cheese options; if you want something more substaintial, go with a few small plates. Go during the week and the place is usually moderately full. I've been there a few times during the weekend when it's more crowded, but I've only had to wait for a table once. If you're up in Andersonville and looking for a place to have drinks with a few friends, this is an excellent option.",0.9792,0.815,0.185,0.0,0.5452272727272727
2009-07-02,5.0,"I figured I'd better update my review to include the yummy food at In Fine Spirits.  I've now been three or four times and had various small plates that were all amazing - it's my new go-to spot for meeting friends for drinks in the 'hood. The first time I went for food, they had pork belly on special, which was spectacularly done and tasted heavenly.  At $10 for a large portion, it was also a great deal.  I've sampled the marinated olives too, but the real winner is the CHEESE.  You can select 3 cheeses for $15 - the selection will boggle your mind.  My absolute fave is the ricotta with thyme and truffle oil.  The ""holy cow"" is also wonderful, as is the fait gras.  They don't skimp on the portions of cheese, and they are served with crusty bread and a delicious quince jam with figs.  It's basically my idea of a perfect meal.  Yes, I could live on bread and cheese alone. Last night they had flatbreads on special for $5, which is basically half-off.  My friend and I tried the pepperonata, which was fantastic, with sweet roasted peppers, spicy arugula, salty prociuitto, and creamy goat cheese - terrific ingredients, all of it.  Between that and the cheese plate, we had ourselves an amazing dinner for 20 bucks! My friend enjoyed one of the white wine flights while I stuck with a New Zealand Pinot Noir.  The service here is terrific; all the employees are super nice and helpful with food and wine selections. It's the perfect spot to catch up with a friend over drinks and a light bite.  I'm so glad In Fine Spirits is in my 'hood!",0.9989,0.665,0.321,0.014,0.6533486121721416

The server was very helpful and the wine was delicious and offered something for everyone both by palette and price. The lighting was muted with very nice jazz music in the background that didn't distract from our conversation but added to the overall quality of the evening.

First, the girl working really didn't seem very interested in the fact that there were customers there. Sure, I wasn't dressed up or anything, but I have a strong knowledge of wine and spend a LOT of money on wine. Two other women who walked in after me and were more dressed up got her attention. I had questions about where different wines were located throughout the store. I was not impressed with the layout since there is very little signage or direction. I did end up purchasing a bottle of Temparnillo, but just wish that I would have had a bit more personal attention. The girl did seem a bit more interested when my husband inquired about their wine club. We decided against it though because overall we just didn't feel welcome.

My wife and I had a friend in from Boston on Sunday and we stopped in around 10pm for dessert and a glass of wine after having dinner at La Tache (the food was great and the face lift they gave it was great). After looking it up on Yelp app with my iPhone, I saw they closed at 11pm. So we headed over.  The underwhelming server moped over to our table to take our order. He offered still or sparkling water and then went on his way. He came back, set the water on the table and left again without a word.  When he returned, he asked us for our order and after placing our drinks, my wife asked for the chocolate cake or something of that sort and he just responded, ""the kitchen is closed."" We said ok and he went to fetch our port wine.  Since we really wanted dessert, we diced to just head back home and drink some wine/port there. (It would save us $30.00 anyway)  When I told him to forget the order he just mumbled in agreement and didn't seem to really care we were leaving.  I understand not having a kitchen open until 11pm on a Sunday, but at the very least you could have the desserts, (only a couple on the menu I believe) and maybe a cheese plate available for after hours.   There isn't really any preparation needed for those menu items. And lastly, while I didn't really spend any money, I can agree with the others that the prices on some things are a little overboard.  Especially when many places are running ""Economic Stimulous"" type specials/happy hours.

2009-04-09,5.0,"So I've been a regular at IFS for about 7 months now. This is the first chance I've had to write a review, mainly because I spend all my free time at IFS: It's a vicious circle. It's hard to find a bar that hits all the high notes of the alcohol trifecta (wine, beer and spirits), but IFS does. First sign this ain't your father's watering hole comes in the form of triple filtered water (choice of still or bubbly) brought out with the menu. Their goal is not to get you hammered and get you out, but to provide a delicious drinking experience. They've put tremendous thought into the beer and wine selection, and as a sommelier in training I should know. My faves include the Soter pinot noir and the Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Triple beer. They have a master mixologist on hand (smile and say hello Benjamin) creating original cocktails using homemade infusions and fresh ingredients, along with my old favorites. I'm a whiskey/bourbon fan, so I like the Blood and Sand, Sazerac and Gently. A very well-trained and friendly staff helps guide you through the selections if it gets overwhelming. Some days I just let them surprise me. If you're not an alcy like me, they also have Julius Meinl coffee which comes out in a French press, and more importantly got the thumbs up from my caffeine junkie friends. No reg bar food (no nachos!) but instead a gourmet selection of cheese and charcuterie along with small plates like tequila braised brisket and curried mussels. I'm addicted to the house flatbread (goat cheese, arugula, apple compote) which I didn't think I'd like at first, but now crave like my pregnant sister craves a dirty gin martini with 6 blue cheese olives. The casual neighborhood vibe is comfortable enough for me to show up after work in a suit, or after softball in my crappy cleats. Looking forward to the reopening of the patio. The pricing is on par with comparable wine bars in the city ($6-$15 a drink). Definitely less expensive than downtown, but not sure how it compares to other Andersonville bars.

2008-07-03,4.0,"Saying this is a great addition to the neighborhood is redundant, but so true. In some ways, In Fine Spirits is to wine what Hopleaf is to beer. The bar doesn't just serve wine, it has a philosophy. Like the store, the bar focuses on New World wines and smaller producers. Yes, they make sparkling wine in New Mexico, and you can try it here. They do offer some European wines, but even these come from smaller producers with whom the owners have developed a relationship. Because they work with smaller vineyards, some of their selection is ""seasonal"" -- when a batch is gone, it's gone. In this way, you get to experience a wider variety of wine than you might at a bar that wants to be sure that all of their wines are constantly in stock. IFS also sells craft beers and ""classic American cocktails."" I should know, because I had a few, and they knocked me on my ass. For their cocktails, they've gone back to classic recipes, so a martini, for example, is something more than chilled vodka in a glass. They've started incorporating absinthe in some of their cocktails as well, such as the Sazerac, an old New Orleans favorite that, until recently, generally replaced the absinthe with Pernod or Herbsaint. With such an extensive collection of cocktails, I never made it to wine last night. I have some very gay friends who complained about the stenciling in the decor, but unless you are very gay, you're not likely to notice. The room is long and clean, with lower tables up front by the windows, and a series of cafe tables along a high banquette. The stools are wide and well padded, which is important if you are as well. There's also an enclosed patio in the back, and a private party room upstairs. Rumor has it there is no charge for using the private room, which would make sense in a spot that is so dedicated to service. The service was excellent, despite the fact that we had a large group and the room was full. Our tables were set with complimentary bottles of water, which I think may be standard. There seemed to be only one server working, but she was very efficient, and the manager jumped behind the bar and helped the bartender fill orders. The manager is perfectly suited for this lounge. He is very enthusiastic about the business, and offered us free pours of ruby port, and tastes of a violet liqueur they use in a few cocktails. He's even excited about the fruit they use as garnishes, which also come from small producers. My one complaint is the food menu, which is small and not very satisfying. But they have plans to expand their offerings, so we'll see where that leads. Still, as a place to have a glass or two of wine or to spend an evening, In Fine Spirits fits the bill.",0.9971,0.801,0.163,0.037,0.47454587558035827

Can't wait to go again soon!",0.9633,0.684,0.316,0.0,0.7666666666666666

Add some oaky undertones and light hints of warm apple pie with a nice bacon spice finish and you're on your way to a wine fanatic's gourmet experience.",0.9716,0.711,0.275,0.015,0.5958333333333333

2008-04-27,5.0,"7-3-08 update:  I'm bumping this to 5 stars.  I've been here several more times since my original review and this is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in the neighborhood.  Service could not be better - everyone, from hostess to the wait staff to the bartenders is super friendly and knowedgeable.  I know this is a wine bar, but in my opinion the mixed drinks are the real stars.  They have a lot of items on their mixed drink menu you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  They also have seasonal mixed drinks - the summer ginger beer drinks are absolutely amazing.  .   ************ I've been to this place twice this past week - which must mean it's pretty good.  This is, as others have said, a fantastic addition to the neighborhood.  It's a cute, casual place to meet friends and has a fantastic wine/cocktail list.  I love that they feature two pages of traditional (read old-timey) cocktails.  I also think the prices are tremendously reasonable and wine pours are generous.  I ran into the general manager, too who seemed to be taking time to speak to everyone in the shop - a nice touch.  I'm pleased to hear they'll be adding food, which I do feel the place lacks. As a bonus, as a woman I don't typically feel comfortable going to bars by myself but I would feed perfectly all right going to IFS - the atmosphere is just that welcoming!",0.9972,0.712,0.264,0.024,0.6483816964285715
2008-04-26,4.0,"Great addition to Andersonville's nightlife. Mostly everything a wine bar should have, including a huge wine selection and knowledgeable, efficient and friendly waitstaff.  I've gone to a few other wine bars in Chicago, including one in the Andersonville area, and they were all unnecessarily pretentious. Not this place.  We went last night (Friday) around 6, and the place was fairly empty, filling up almost completely by 7.  This place could easily become a five star joint if they get some more appetizers on the menu. Currently they have three food choices. I think our server mentioned they are expanding their food menu shortly. And there will be a garden/outdoor patio in the back open around Memorial day, I was told.   I look forward to returning in a month or two.",0.9186,0.874,0.112,0.014,0.45781250000000007
2008-04-24,4.0,I was really happy to see a wine bar in Andersonville.  We went 2 days after they opened and I was impressed at the wait staff and their knowledge of all the menu selections. You can tell the owners put a lot of thought into the types of wine and cocktails they are serving.   The place is huge with 2 stories and can accommodate big parties.,0.902,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.75
2008-04-13,4.0,"I visited this place opening weekend after Michael (works at IFS) mentioned it finally received the printed certificate to sell alcohol.  The place was full, not an open seat after we settled in. The menu had a big variety with plenty of options for everyone. I was glad that they offered more then just the wine offerings from next door.  Only drawback is nothing to snack on. This place could use some chocolates or cheese or something to accompany the offerings. A great business model, people come in, have a few drinks and leave, but I would have stayed longer and spent more had I had something to snack on.  I walked by this past weekend, 2nd weekend and the crowd was much smaller. Spoke with the IFS person this am and it was not as busy this past weekend.  Maybe in time they can have a deal to serve up maybe what one of the other restaurants (or bakeries) has.  The bar area was restored from its original state. After the pet hospital moved, they uncovered the flooring and ceiling work that had been hidden for years. Beautiful on the inside, another great addition for A-Ville! -I have been messaged that they will have food soon as they finish the menu. Woohoo!",0.9809,0.876,0.119,0.005,0.4821969696969697
