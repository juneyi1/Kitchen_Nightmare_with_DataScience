Perhaps I just selected the wrong dishes but the ones selected by our table was far from memorable. We arrived early and sat in the bar for drink while waiting for our table. The bartender was very friendly and made us some great drinks. During dinner we ordered the Calamari & Quinoa salad, and the Rock Shrimp Tempura as appetizers. The calamari had too much batter and without the batter it was tasteless. The Rock Shrimp was only okay but we would not order it again. Our entree was Duck Duck Duck and Roasted Sea Bass. The Sea Bass was very good and we would recommend this dish. The Duck dish was not very good - duck soup had too much ginger and the duck leg was super dry.

Waiter forgot about one of our dishes, fortunately it wasn't on the bill.  Table next to us waited at least 30 minutes after finishing dessert for their waiter to come back and provide the check.  The price point is way too high for that level of service.  Things we noticed:  - Dishes were never brought to the right table on the first try. ""Tuna pizza?"" become a common question.  - The menu was not explained and no recommendations provided - Sushi menu no longer has any rolls (or they forgot to give us one)  - Never checked in on once to see if we liked/disliked an item   - No apology for any of the delays.

2015-09-07,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place. Like really bad. I guess it's unfair to say I didn't. The food was incredible. Actually I guess it's cool that this place still exists because it's an example of a restaurant that exists based on food merit alone. Because literally everything else was kind of a disappointment.  Ok, so I kind of hate myself for thinking this place is a disappointment.  Let's get the self loathing out of the way ASAP. Like who the hell am I to go to a sushi restaurant in a landlocked state near zero oceans and still be disappointed after getting some of the freshest fish in Chicago, right?  But I guess considering a meal with drinks for 4 people was over 300 dollars (and yeah, I've been to alinea et al, I know that to certain tax brackets and maybe my dad that this is nothing, and to some of my friends it's a gross amount to spend on a meal and i should probably not even admit to eating here in the first place so my super cool fellow comedians don't think I'm too hoity-toity) but I guess for that price I expected to maybe be treated like my friends and I were welcome even just a little? Like I know it's such a first world thing and super American entitlement to expect everyone serving us to act like they enjoy it, but fine dining waiters make BANK and so maybe act like we aren't a total inconvenience for having a reservation one hour before the technical closing time? Our reservation was 8, made on opentable. A completely reasonable time for a human being to eat dinner on a day when many people gather to make lunch on a communal charcoal device. I mean the restaurant was open on Labor Day, so they were like...OPEN right?  So we get there At like 8:05. 5 minutes late? Yes, but like totally normal in our shitty capitalist culture and also the place was not busy at all.  We sat at our tiny table, even though there were a lot of way bigger tables that parties of two were sat at vs our party of four, including 2 parties sat after Us. But I reminded silent. I was too afraid of looking like my father because sometimes he embarrasses me with his entitlement but this was not publican on a Saturday with the coolest servers.  The waiter made sure to inform us that he would be back to go over the menu ""considering the kitchen closes soon."" So that's understandable that you close early on a holiday (9pm), but like maybe don't list an 8pm reservation (A WHOLE HOUR BEFORE YOU CLOSE EARLY) if you're just going to rush us into ordering?  So we ordered drinks and apps and made choices of food while that was prepped. First the hot stone came, so we started on that. the drinks came after we finished, yet the waiter who clearly needed to leave didn't clear our plates or ask if we wanted to place the rest of our order until after we basically finished our first round and the sake that he placed in an undisclosed location. We got the rest of the Sake but our menus were still stacked and in the way no matter what the entire time because we just couldn't seem to get to the next step of the process in the right amount of time.  When our main courses were being ordered before 9 pm, or rather as soon as the option was available to us even though we were kind of guilted for our extremely unreasonable reservation of 8, two other tables sat down. The waiter was just fixated on the fact that he was given two more opportunities for tips in the fine dining establishment he works for that essentially guarantees large gratuity and was so put off that he, according to my guest, couldn't even look at us. At one point he said the restaurant contacted the reservations made close to 9 on open table but couldn't contact One 8:30. When he realized we were 8 pm he's like oh it wasn't you. But thanks for making us feel guilty anyway?  Again...food was amazing. Again...a holiday. But for a 300 dollar meal and such a high regarded chef I expected way better service. He could not get rid of us fast enough. We felt like we needed permission to order more drinks. Also usually when it's a sharing place and I ask if it's enough food they actually were honest instead of saying ""well I don't know how hungry you are sooooooo...."" I mean it's a great story and maybe I'll get some shitty stand up material but for such a well-respected chef maybe get some respectful staff?

The waitress never explained that the water was going to cost nine dollars a bottle. She simply asked - would you like water with ice or no ice? In NYC, all water is served in bottles with no ice, so I assumed it would be the same thing. When I saw the bill, with $18 charge for water, I questioned it, and waitress was very apologetic. She said she would talk to the manager, to see if they could do something. However, the manager just came over, and laid down my full bill, and just simply walked away.

Overall we thought the food was outstanding. The service was spotty, albeit friendly, but it definitely took away from our experience.  We arrived at 8:25 for our 8:30 reservation and were made to go downstairs to the lounge to wait at the bar for our table. No big deal. Except we had to be seated at a separate table with a separate server to order a cocktail despite open seats at the bar. Our drinks came and after about 20 minutes we were notified our table for dinner was ready.  However our server had disappeared and we were unable to cash out with him for more than 10 minutes.  The atmosphere was lovely and we had fun, but it just seemed to be a very disjointed and odd process.  We were seated in the back (right next to the patio that is apparently used for smokers) and were greeted and received water. It was an exceptionally long wait until we saw a server or manager again - we were debating how soon we should just walk out. Alas, a manager appeared to take our wine and appetizer order.  We started with the shishito peppers, smoked chicken sausage and octopus, and 2 maki rolls - spicy hamachi and eel and avocado. Everything was spectacular. The house-made chicken sausage was delicious, octopus was perfectly cooked, and the fish was so fresh.  Along the way we were introduced to our actual server who apparently got tied up and was unable to come to our table for the first 30+ minutes we were seated. It happens, and it explains our excessive wait to order. However I think this also caused our meal to be quite disjointed. We waited close to an hour after our appetizers before we received our sea bass entrees. The sea bass was perfectly cooked and just exquisite, so the wait was almost forgiven because it was worth it.  The service could have ruined our dining experience at Japonais. Luckily the food was good enough to make us almost forget.  Also worth noting - the crowd is a mixed bag. There was a screaming baby there at 10pm.

We were tremendously excited to be dining at a bona fide tetsujin establishment, but the restaurant failed to live up to what one would expect of the eponym. The service was attentive but oddly obsequious, and combined with the subpar quality of the fish, I got the distinct impression that management is banking on less discerning tourist-y traffic generated by the celebrity chef's name. Frankly, I felt a little duped. The gyoza and hamachi taco appetizers were okay (though apparently, hamachi is a declasse fish - my dad was mortified when I almost ordered hamachi at a fine sushi restaurant in Tokyo), and the octopus carpaccio was quite tasty, but the chef's choice sashimi was sadly disappointing. At $40 a pop for the lunch sashimi plate, I don't expect fish flown in from Tsukiji, but I do expect the sashimi to be fresh, flavorful, and have the proper mouthfeel. If I would have to hazard a guess, the fish had been frozen too long, or had gone through too many freeze/thaw cycles, because I got none of the above. Although I am still curious about the top-shelf $160 Chef's Sashimi Combination, the disappointment I experienced with the $40 offering means I won't be going back to Japonais.

I'm also a HUGE Morimoto fan (I road-tripped to his restaurant in Philly years back and it was my first tasting and omakase ever!). Our meal was tasty, but there were a few things lacking to make this a really refined dining experience that I think Morimoto's name deserves. My review is pretty hard, but looking at it through the lens of what I expected from a Morimoto restaurant Menu - First off, there are way too many things on this menu and it's not organized in very well - especially the appetizer page. The server addressed it and made some reco's but it hard to navigate. Food/Plating - The food was tasty (more details below) but the dinner ware did not match the tables. We had 4 people in a small round table. The menu is meant to be eaten family style, but the plates are SO large and cumbersome you are not able to really have multiple dishes to eat family style. We only had 2 entrees on our table at one point and they could barely fit. They need either bigger tables or smaller plates. It was very hard to share.  Service - friendly but a little clumsy. Some questions asked they didn't have answers too. Also when they brought the very large plates our previous plates hadn't been cleared. They also weren't able to fit the new plates on the existing table and were not skilled at moving and arranging the table to accommodate. Lastly, if dishes are meant to be shared they should always coming with serving silverware. Multiple times we had to ask for utensils. One of them was when we get the ""ramen"" in tonkatsu broth and no one had a spoon to try the broth! DISHES: SUSHI - The sushi was a highlight. Both the spicy tuna roll and chirashi were a delight. BRUSSEL SPROUTS - Very unique, loved the kim chi flavor (not too acidic) PORKBELLY RAMEN - Tasty but server reco'd this to share and this was hard to share HAMACHI - Tasty, but not standout COD - SO tasty and tender.

2015-08-01,4.0,"This is certainly one of the better sushi restaurants in Chicago, although it perhaps can't live up to the prestigious name attached to it. The decor and vibe of the place is top notch, from the downstairs bar (the Blue Room) to the upstairs dining rooms. The food features many of the items you'll find at Morimoto in New York City and as far as I could recall they were nearly identical. Fish quality is, of course, excellent. We had the multi course omakase, which is a bit different than other omakases in that you can pretty much pick your own items, so it's just a way of bundling the items you're interested in, at a reasonable price of $130 per person. Portion sizes were large, and we definitely left feeling well stuffed with sushi! The best item we tried was the hamachi crudo, thin strips alternating with pimentos. The hamachi tacos were also quite good.  A few of the specialties didn't live up to expectations, including the Caesar salad, which just was voted best salad in Chicago, but seemed rather pedestrian to me. Perhaps it's just that I don't like Caesars that are served deconstructed, leaving the prep work to me. The vaunted Duck Duck Duck was also a bit lackluster, although there was nothing wrong with any of the (more than 3) duck preparations on the plate. We also had octopus, both raw (supposedly live, but I think the octopus would disagree) and cooked, beets, a large platter of sashimi, and spicy crab legs. The trio of sorbets was a nice light way to end the meal. The wine list is extensive, and there is a nice selection of Champagnes, the perfect match for sashimi. Service was friendly and attentive, although several times during the meal there was an attempt to deliver two dishes at once, a physical impossibility on such small tables and with such large dishes. This is apparently caused by them having three kitchen and no coordination between them, which seems very odd for a restaurant of this caliber. Overall I enjoyed the meal, thought it was reasonably priced for what it was, and would go back.

Not only does Japonais boast a fantastic selection, but the fish is extremely fresh and comes in a generous portion as well. I would personally recommend the sashimi rather than the nigiri, since you can truly savor the fish that way and you can get a side of rice if you must. My favorite selections were the Kanpachi (amberjack) and the Kani (king crab), which are an absolute must try. Some other notable items off the menu are the Toro Tartare and their cheesecake for dessert. The tartare is interesting in that it comes with several 'toppings', you spoon out the tartare and then dip it into each of the toppings in succession, and then eat it all at once. The toppings include crispy rice, wasabi and chives. The cheesecake is tofu based, I believe, which sounds super weird I know but it is absolutely delicious! Because it's so light, it allows you to enjoy the other flavors in the plate (coffee foam and plum sorbet!) One thing I didn't like at all was the savoy and kale kimchee. It just tasted kind of off, like it was thrown together hastily. Skip that. The service was, although really friendly and helpful, just extremely slow.

Manager comes over, awkwardly apologizes, takes our drink order and then brings them to us, and says they will cover them, so that was appreciated.  Then he brings out our waiter to assure us we're in good hands, and he was fine.  Part way through the meal though Morimoto is speaking over (yelling?) our heads to the sushi chef's, so that was a little odd.  Honestly, if they had just sat us somewhere else I feel like it would have been less weird, but it was just weird!  And then this girl comes over, almost in tears, to take a picture with Morimoto and thank him for ""inspiring her to become a chef"", and I had to lean out of the frame of their picture because they were basically on top of our table.  In the end, they forgot our food we asked to be wrapped to go, and we got out of there to go to a jazz bar and get drunk.  Food was good though...",0.9835,0.825,0.123,0.052,0.6354037267080745

It was a great primer for The Rock--an indomitable dish composed of raw, thinly sliced Waygu accompanied by a 500 degree hot stone. It was a scorching shrine honoring the holiness of perfect Waygu beef. Calling it a religious experience doesn't do it justice. Do yourself a favor and worship at the altar of The Rock as soon as you can.  To top off our divine visit, Chef Morimoto happened to be dining with a group of friends at the table next to us. Apparently the sushi he was served  wasn't up to his standards.  He marched behind the sushi counter and emphatically demonstrated what a perfect piece of sushi should look like while the nervous chefs looked on.

Restaurant week's menu gives you an opportunity to try lots of different stuff for a good value. I then decided to bring a group of 10 friends to join for the dinner.  First, the service is not bad, but I don't like how the server tired to push us away from getting the restaurant week menus. It was obvious he just wanted more tips from us rather than being honest about the portion of the food. The portion was definitely filling enough, which he 'stressed' that it was not enough.  My first course was the rock beef. Rare beef seared on a hot stone. It was definitely delicious and perfect show stopper with some sweet soy sauce on the side. A cool dish, but definitely not $20.00 worth of an appetizer.  Next up, sushi platter... these sushi are SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY!  I can't believe these sushi are from a Morimoto restaurant.  I had way better sushi for way better price. I can't believe Morimoto would approve these nigiri being served because they're definitely not the quality you would expect out of an iron chef.  Last plate up, dessert. I had the tofu cheese cake with foam moose.  It was perfect sweetness and lightness.  I think the dessert was the best dish over all.  I also tried the shrimp, which was nothing special at all.  It was basically fried sweet with different types of sauces. You can easily get this dish at any other Chinese restaurant.  Another dish that I tried was the lamb dish, which was good, but not the best I had.  I had better lamb dish at Lazy Dog Cafe for way cheaper price.

Ordered Beef appetizers, chicken noodle soup, and Sea Bass (all great!) continues with more sushi that were never brought out  with other sushi items in the beginning (Server thinks that all orders has been bought out - I should have shown the photo) she said ""you are welcome!"" after dropping our misplaced sushi. (I didn't thank her btw) After going through the meal, we didn't have appetite for dessert and asked for check. Oh what's that in the bill: Bd dessert?(shown in bill and credited) She said it was a surprise birthday (my wife mentioned when reserving the table) dessert,  which we didn't get. I place the credit card and waitress (Taylor) brought back the bill and dessert with candle (seriously after I pointed out and the bill was already paid for) might as well pack it instead.  She couldn't wait to get our check (asked 3 times while we are having that late dessert while trying to figure out the tip) I normally give 25 - 30% but for this service 10% (Taylor - you have to try to pay attention and be nice to paying customers!) The valet brought our car and he said $12 - I handed $20 bill (he had better service than waitress) Morimoto: you should have better servers to go with your great food for that 5 stars rating.",0.9832,0.891,0.097,0.013,0.596758400329829

2015-03-03,4.0,"Okay so I've been wanting to go to Japonais by Morimoto for a while and for many reasons. We've been to Japonais a long time ago and I liked it but didn't love it and knew that this new Morimoto twist was intriguing. I've been to Morimoto in Napa and absolutely loved it so knew that this Chicago twist would be awesome. I made reservations for Valentine's day and it was packed, like not a table available which is a given. I loved how they redid the place, it's trendy yet romantic and has a perfect intimate setting. However, there are many tables and they are pretty close to each other so if you're able to get a booth in back consider yourself lucky. We started with a few of their signature cocktails and they were super yummy, the most talked about one which I attached a photo, I only saw due to yelp but our server wasn't the best at recommending it nor was he that good at recommending anything. And so we went with our gut, the drinks were great, but small so kinda pricey if you ask me.  Now onto the goodies. We ordered their signature rock appetizer with the New York Strip that's cooked in front of you on this huge rock and then there are many dipping sauces that take it over the edge. It was definitely yummy, but once again a small portion for what you get. We also ordered the duck fried rice to try since it's something we're both normally a fan of but there was no duck. Maybe they meant like cooking it in duck fat, no idea, but there were no like duck pieces. Here's what was kind of annoying and I know they were busy but they should have been prepared for it. Our sushi tray took 45 minutes after we got the duck rice. That is pretty unacceptable. We waited and waited and waited, until finally our server got a manager involved who got us some drinks on the house. I appreciate the gesture but that gesture should have been done 20 minutes after waiting not 45. I mean no food on our table for 45 minutes on Valentines day is kind of annoying and bothersome. I do appreciate them trying to make the situation better, but it should have been done earlier. So at this point, the establishment, although gorgeous, and the food, super tasty, but the service kinda sucks. So I would have given them 2-3 stars. However, the chocolate dessert is freaking phenomenal, it was the best that I've had in a long time. Definitely order it! Presentation is spot on and you will be thinking about it for weeks to come, just as I am. I however, am not dying to go back due to their sub par service.",0.9971,0.721,0.198,0.081,0.5929683195592285

Food upstairs was OK - not to the Morimoto level I was expecting, our food sounded better than it tasted. Duck duck duck dish had a boring duck soup (could have been any other meat), duck fried rice (again, could have been any other meat and very small amount of it), dry duck thigh, but at least the breast meat was delicious. Not worth $35. Kakuni was good, as was Ishi Yaki Hamachi Bop.

2015-02-22,2.0,"I have been here two times before and both experiences were amazing. The first time dined inside and the second was outside on the patio. I came here last week and everything was so bad that I questioned if I were in the correct restaurant. It was a Sunday night and wasn't busy at all but service was very slow. On top of that our server seemed annoyed that we kept ordering. I really feel like he thought we were just going to have a drink/apps and be done. When we went on to order a bottle of wine and entrees he seemed very annoyed. The bottle of wine we wanted they told us they were out of so we opted for another bottle which was fine. We then ordered two hot rocks which were the only thing great which we have had before. The sushi was just ok as opposed to before where it had been amazing. When I ordered the ""Duck Duck Duck"" I was told there may not be any left, but he came back and they did still have some. It came out and the duck leg was so dry and cold, the soup cold, and the sliced duck breast was well done. My dining partner had the leg of lamb, which we both love lamb. It was cold as well and almost had a slimy weird taste to it. I am NOT a picky person at all and laugh most of the time at peoples reviews on here, but I was so blown away at my experience this visit. I really don't think I will ever be back. There are so many restaurants in Chicago that have way better service and food for sure. We didn't complain at all as we paid our $300 bill which was expected but so was great service and food.

Food quality was great and the menu was awesome. Then they closed it and retooled it (presumably someone named Morimoto bought it) for some reason. The short answer is that I wouldn't even consider going back. The menu was so much worse. Gone are the creative rolls, replaced by, well, nothing. You can still get the same California rolls and all the other generic crap you can find at every corner sushi place in the city though - yay.  The food wasn't particularly good. We got an order of gyoza as one of the appetizers. I don't even know how to describe it, but it was thoroughly awful. Just a mash-up of tiny gyoza surrounded by tasteless foam. Weird. Also got some sort of hamachi taco appetizer which they put olives on for some reason, and it didn't go well with the fish at all. The nigiri was fine. The prices were waaaaay too high for the quality.  The place was DEAD. Like, awkwardly empty. Apparently I hadn't gotten the memo that this place is no longer cool.

For appetizer we got King crab legs and california roll. The roll was fairly mundane (presentation obviously was on spot), but the spicy doubanjan sauce they added with the legs was on spot. Followed up with the main course, which was the roasted lobster masala. The lobster was good, but honestly not the best I've had. The lemon cream cheese dipping was perfect though and helped neutralize the rest of the dish. My beau had the wagyu beef steak, which was honestly a much better choice. Finally for dessert we had morimoto's cheesecake, which a very interesting mix of cheesecake with strawberry spread on the side, along with sorbet mixed with TONS of foam and sitting on a white chocolate basket. The cheesecake took the cake literally on that plate, and I thought the sorbet was only so so.

The morimotini was good too it's a sake cocktail with the freshness of cucumber and strengthened with vodka. Place is nice service is good. Just lost a star or two because of the name Morimoto is there and it raised my expectations.  Perhaps the cooks are not always checked on?  Good quality was great but seed like it wasn't performed well. We ordered sashimi 80$ choice, some uni and ikura nigiri and the ""duck duck duck"". Sashimi was good not super but pretty good. There was a scale on our Spanish mackerel (Aji), which kinda shows they do de-bone it fresh so I guess it's a pass.  The nigiris were good but uni was t super fresh. And rice was too big and little to the wet side.  Duck duck duck was their fusion dish which I really appreciate the combination but the duck confit leg was too dry. It tasted like they boiled it with some stock for too long.. Duck breast was great, with the plum jam sauce. But skin wasn't crispy.. Hm soup was ok. It did cleanse our palate I guess that's why it's there for.  Overall good for Americanized japanese food holding with the authenticity there for the sushi and quality sashimi.

The food is beautiful, innovative, playful, and yes, of course, delicious. The Toro Tartare arrived in a flat glass tray atop a large bowl of finely cubed ice.  We were each given a small metal spatula that we used to scoop up the fish and a smaller tray of dipping sauces.  Delicious.   The Morimoto Sashimi Terrine was comprised of six small stacks of various fish, served on a giant plate that our waiter then ""painted"" on with five sauces in little pipettes. The Karai King Crab arrived, the legs smothered in a bright red sauce.  My first reaction was concern, that the sauce would overpower the delicate flavor of the crab, but it somehow worked beautifully, even though the sauce was quite spicy.  I think this may have been my dining companions' favorite dish of the night. Duck Confit Fried Rice came blanketed with a huge sunny-side up duck egg.  The texture and consistency of the rice was perfection, although I did find myself wishing for more duck confit in the rice. Sea Urchin Carbonara was everything I had hoped it would be.  It was, as the waiter described, very much like a traditional Italian carbonara - but the addition of the fresh briny uni somehow added an element of lightness to the dish.  This was my favorite dish of the night, and is something I will definitely order again the next time I am lucky enough to dine at Japonais.

It was a little more salty than I would have prefered. Portions were excellent and I was not left hungry.  Duck Confit Fried rice was very delicious!!

Incredibly fishy taste, sushi was hard and uninventive.  Just hoping I don't end up sick in the next 24 hours. Unfortunate because I was assuming based on other reviews and the Morimito name we would have an incredible experience. Apparently the head chef might have changed recently so maybe that's the reason but I would avoid, much better options in Chicago!",0.7345,0.753,0.153,0.095,0.6514005602240897

From their site: Lunch Monday - Friday: 11:30am - 2:30pm  Dinner Sunday - Wednesday: 5:00pm - 10:00pm Thursday: 5:00pm - 11:00pm Friday - Saturday: 5:00pm - 11:30pm I held my Sweet Sixteen here. This restaurant is a veritable beauty. I haven't come across any other spot quite so peculiarly yet elegantly designed. Nothing stifling. Everything is fluid. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet playful.  I would come back just to look at the chairs and decor, but luckily I have another reason: the food is unmatched. The sushi melts in your mouth. But the duck is the star of this show. I had duck for the first time here and it has sabotaged every subsequent experience with duck. It is so juicy, soft, and savory. It falls off the knife like warm butter. I thought duck was made like this everywhere and asked myself why I had never tried it earlier. Sadly, this is not the case. I have had duck cooked all kinds of ways many times afterwards, chasing the dream I had at Japonais, and I have yet to encounter anything the same (though Korean duck bbq comes close). I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Even better than I remembered.  The phenomenal: the service (everyone is friendly and organized and well-coordinated), pork belly with ramen pasta appetizer. I was hesitant to get it because I had a lot of pork belly just a few days ago-- I made the right choice though because this was nothing like any pork belly I've ever had in my life. It was unbelievably delicious. The ramen was too salty but yummy nonetheless. Other standout pieces: Nardis cocktail (white truffle, pear, grapefruit, vodka). Best cocktail I've ever had, hands down. Very fragrant and truly delicious. The truffle flavor worked more than well.  The great: Whip the Mule cocktail (rendition of Moscow Mule; the roasted rosemary was tasty), Japanese coffee grains whiskey (I don't like whiskey so for whiskey lovers, this is probably more than great), Morimoto cheesecake (the coffee foam was way more substantial tasting than I expected. It was savory and lovely. The cheesecake was not heavy or too sweet), the Riverwalk (intimate and breezy)  The good: sea bass entre (interesting flavors), wagyu fat fried rice, Toro tartare  The bad: only the bathroom x)  When I come back, I'm just going to order 10 rounds of pork belly and Nardis cocktails :).",0.9978,0.769,0.201,0.03,0.5117950016886187
2014-12-21,2.0,"This place is all hype, like an overpriced overhyped stock. Came to restaurant with friends, at their recommendation.  Found out that Morimoto is a celebrity chef, and that he is opening restaurants regularly. The primary reason for my dislike from this places come from the service approach.  Waiters assume that when they are talking about something, that the customer does not know what it is.  E.g., I ask, how is the belly toro.  He goes on to explain that toro is the fatty part of tuna.  And that goes on the whole night.  Not just with food, but with drinks.  I almost felt like asking, how is the water, and then he would give me a chemistry lesson. Now, this would be OK, if the waiter knew a lot.  But what he knows is basically re-hearsed.  When I pressed him on several issues, it turned out that he knew very little about certain dishes that I had an interest in.  Outside of the very basic stuff, it did not appear that he liked the food at the restaurant.  I would be OK even with that, except for the fact that he was PUSHING dishes that even he did not like.  ""Oh, I heard it is very good.  It is one of our popular dishes.  People order that a lot"". Another part of the service that made the experience almost intolerable was the constant pushing for drinks.  My friend sitting to the right of me has: (a) an unfinished cocktail, (b) a beer that is not quite yet finished, and (c) a third beer which is almost half full, and the waiter asks him if he wants anything.  So, clearly, the unfinished cocktail was CRAP because it was not even touched, and while he liked the beer, he has almost two, and is still drinking.  Maybe get half a brain, and offer: ""Oh, I see that you did not finish your cocktail.  Did you now like it?"" There were some very, very good dishes, but there were a lot of misses.   However, almost all of the good dishes were of the hot variety.  Sushi, by far, was not of high quality.  I understand that a Japanese restaurant is not necessarily a sushi restaurant, but in this case, this particular restaurant is selling sushi at a high price.  So my expectations were high, and were not met. But the cake would have to go to the fact that when I tried to make economical selections, the waiter tried to stir us away.  I was trying to stir our table towards one of the omakase options.  He goes, ""well, it will take a long time"".  But we were there for 3 hours anyway.  And then, I wanted to order chef's tasting sushi, and he is like, ""But in the chefs tasting you don't get 2 of each, blah blah"".  And then we pay nearly 1.5 price to get a la carte pretty much the same items that would have probably come in the chef's tasting anyway. Unfortunately, Chicago lacks the type of sushi experience that you get in some of the bigger names in NY, like Nobu, EN japanese brasserie, BONDST, 15 East, etc.   Morimotos attempt to rectify that has fallen flatly on its face.  I would only return here if someone puts a gun on my head, or someone else is paying.  And even then, I might have to request a change of wait stuff if a waiter of similar attitude is assigned to the table.",0.9948,0.85,0.115,0.035,0.49701913334892034

Next we had wagyu beef carpacchio and this melted in your mouth. The yuzu soy on top added such a nice flavor. For our mains we split the duck three ways and the seafood toban yuki. Both were fantastic, but I would say the seafood dish stuck out a little bit more. The duck three ways was great, but the 5 piece roasted duck breast was SOOO tough that I actually had to spit out my piece in fear of choking on it as I just could not chew it! The duck fried rice and the meatballs were SO tasty, though! We had just wished for the duck breast to be a little more tender - or even edible at that! We also had a side of Kimchi, which my boyfriend enjoyed. As a whole the meal was wonderful and they even gave him a complimentary ice cream with a candle since it was his bday!

2014-11-26,4.0,"This was my first time coming to Japonais. I wouldn't know how it was before Morimoto owned it, but you know if he puts his name on a restaurant, it's gonna be some legit Japanese cuisine! I really need to stop procrastinating with my Yelp reviews, because I can't even remember all the dishes that our table ordered! Well, we came here with a rather large group and ended up sort of ""splitting"" the table in half and ordering family style accordingly. We ordered the Chef's Combination, which comes out with a variety of sushi nigiri and cut rolls.  The toro tartare was interesting in presentation: it comes out on a flat, clear plate and presented to look like it's ""on ice"" or something. They have these tiny little ""paddles"" that you use to scrape off some of the tuna to enjoy. I kinda wish they made it a little easier to eat, but it was still fun and interesting. My favorite dish of the night was actually a side dish: duck confit fried rice with organic farm egg on top. WOW, the flavors were amazing, and that farm egg on top was cooked to perfection. I'm so glad that we ordered this! Oh yeah, we did order the tofu tableside. It's cool, because it's actually not tofu when they bring it...but by the time you're done with your appetizers, the server will come around to open it up and voila! It's tofu! I don't know if there's any difference in how awesome tofu can be. To me, tofu is tofu. So while it was good, you really can't fancy up tofu too much, besides the presentation that they offered...so points for that I guess. We also ordered one of those hot rock dishes. It's cool to cook your meat on a hot rock. Another inventive and interesting dish here, but I can't say that it makes the food taste any different. Overall, I feel like a lot of the dishes are kind of gimick-y and interesting in presentation, but it doesn't necessarily make any extra difference to the quality or taste of the food. It was a wonderful meal, and fun to experience the way the dishes were presented. I would come again for a special occasion, since it's kind of expensive.",0.9986,0.754,0.233,0.013,0.5320075757575757

We started with some cocktails - the Serenity is great for lychee fans, and the Stormy Weather is a great apple & cinnamon-infused take on the original. The menu is meant for sharing, so we went with a good variety of starters, sushi, and main course + side.  We started with the popcorn rock shrimp (my personal favorite!  2 different styles - spicy and wasabi) and the foie gras oysters (decadent!  Creamy foie gras + sea urchin on a salty, tangy steamed oyster served on the half-shell!) Next came the sashimi + sushi roll.. we love salmon so we went with the Scottish and Tasmanian sashimi.  Exceptionally prepared, with that coat-your-mouth fatty flavor that really sets quality salmon apart!  The spicy tuna roll was great as well. We ordered the Duck Duck Duck and the kimchee from the sides menu.  Duck was beautifully served 3 ways (sliced breast, fried rice, and soup) - the breast was my personal favorite, like a spicier take on the classic magret de canard.  The kimchee was not fermented per traditional prep, but it was nonetheless tangy/savory, and a great accompaniment to the duck.

2014-11-08,4.0,"This really is a 5 star review wrapped in a fussypants 4 star review. Forgive me for becoming a perfectionist. First off: The dining room, staff, and presentations are 6 stars. My wife and I dined here at 6 PM on a Saturday evening. Lesson: The place isn't ""hopping"" until 7ish. Good thing my wife and I are suburbanite homebodies who loved the notion of a barely empty dining room to begin our meal. And being literally across from a major parking garage made for easy in and out. Double bonus: 8 dollar parking?! My wife and I were seated closest to the ""back hallway"" adjacent to the kitchen. I'm perplexed why every elite place she and I attend end up doing that to us. But I digress. My wife had a beautiful view of the dining room, and the windows. I had a lovely view (aside from my lovely wife, ahem) of a stone pillar, the back of the bar, and the wait-staff chuckling. We started our meal with cocktails: wife had a ""Moritmotini"" and I, a ""Stormy Weather"". Her drink was potent. Mine tasted like a yankee candle. But I don't drink enough to know if that was expected, and I'm not the type to send a drink back. My water glass got as much action as the Collins glass, but that's fine by me.  Soon thereafter, we tried the Pork Gyoza and some Sushi. The dumplings were airy, and flavorful, BUT not worth the price tag. We were told there were 5 of them, sitting amongst the 'bacon foam'. For the life of us? We counted 3.  The sushi however, was fantastic. Presented beautifully, and full-flavored. Not a nit-pick to have. The entrees we sampled were the table-side Hamachi and rice in a hot-stone bowl, followed by 'Duck Duck Duck'. Both were balanced, a considerable portion, and memorable. I will knock points off only to comment that at the beginning of our meal our server made a point that ""each dish will be sent out as soon as it's ready."" This would leave me with the expectation of piping hot food. The Duck Duck Duck was by no means piping. It was a good temperature... but not exactly as I might have imagined it. We completed the meal with a salted caramel chocolate torte. Presented like a black jewel against the thinnest ribbons of accompanying garnish... ultimately was a brilliantly decadent end to a fabulous meal. But my other ""half a star"" dings here: for entitling a dish with ""Salted Caramel""... placing a micron thin line of said caramel to cover duty to bathe an entire torte, cookie, and cocoa sorbet was laughable. And because it was such a PERFECT combination to the rich chocolate? It ultimately left me licking my lips, but wanting a ladle full to compensate. I saw elsewhere on the yelpers that ""dinner takes upwards of 2 hours"". Well, My wife and I enjoyed all courses in a timely manner, and left promptly at 7:15. So, maybe we hit a good peak of service....? Here, I'm glad the expectation was defeated with friendly and prompt service. Ultimately the wife and I would come back to Japonaise. But with a hefty pricetag, and so many other options throughout the city... i can't say that this was an 'Iron Chef' experience worthy of removing the curiosity of all the other unexplored locales.

And we had had an extraordinary omakase tasting by a chef who had worked with Morimoto at an obscure Japanese restaurant way off the strip in Vegas. The place is still totally hip and WAAAY too noisy. Our waiter decided to ingratiate himself by telling us -repeatedly - that he had lived in Japan for 10 years. And how Morimoto sources his own fish and saki. Also repeatedly. And to tell us how he hoped we were having a good time. Ad nauseum. Our intention was to try a few small plates, some sushi and call it a night. Instead we wound up ordering the omakae (Mr. CG said he did it just to get rid of the waiter who wouldn't shut up). For the price ($120pp) and the time and the amount of food, I really hoped this meal would top our experience in Vegas. Nope. A toro tartar was really a tuna paste stuck to a square glass serving piece inserted into a larger bowl of crushed ice. Tiny thin strips of sour cream, avocado, wasabe, something like fried Israeli couscous and something else were also on the serving piece. There was also a small bowl of soy sauce in the ice and we were given a tiny paddle or trowel with which to eat the thing. Scrape some tartar onto the paddle, dip it in the soy sauce and the tuna falls into the soy sauce. It continued with a rather greasy octopus ""bagna cauda,"" some very good sushi, an incredibly tender and well cooked lobster ""marsala,"" and a grey piece of wagu NY strip steak. We left with significantly less money, uncomfortably stuffed, our ears ringing from the noise and having to shout across the table at each other, and totally irritated by our unctuous waiter.

Iron chef chicken noodle soup ($14) - 3.75 stars. Inaniwa noodles, shanton broth, scallions.

Small portion and the *single* uni piece was ridiculously small. Duck duck duck ($35) - 3 stars. Five-spiced roasted duck breast, duck meatball soup, duck confit fried rice, jalapeno jam. Wasn't a fan of the chewy, non-crispy duck skin. Soup had one meatball the size of a gumball. Broth was okay, but the meatball was really bland. Fried rice was good, not great.

While waiting for our party to assemble we had to huddle like frighten villagers just to make introductions and talk. After being seated, our waitress had to shout to let us know the specials and how the service worked at this restaurant. Which honestly doesn't work any different than any other place. They claim the portions are big enough to share but unless they intend for you to share a bite, the portions aren't really what I would call sharable.  I ordered the sushi and I guess Americanized sushi places have spoiled me because each order of sushi only came with one piece. Those pieces were really, really good but were more money than I would say is warranted. It's probably my fault for ordering sushi in the Midwest but what else should you order from Morimoto's restaurant? I also had a roll, spicy yellowtail, which was incredibly good.

But we must have been there on the wrong night because the service was atrocious - not just leisurely, but actively bad.  After talking with other people who had been there, it seems that our experience was an anomaly, but it still tarnished our time there.  When seeking to order tap water, there was a miscommunication that resulted in a $9 bottle of Evian that could have been easily avoided with clearer communication from the server (when we say no to sparkling, that does not necessarily mean bottled). Once we switched to tap, our water glasses routinely sat empty for long stretches, even after we asked to have them re-filled. There was an hour gap between our sushi course and our main courses due to someone taking one of the entrees and then having to re-fire both.  The wrong side was brought with our entrees, and when we asked to just cancel the one we had ordered, it was ""too late"" and the side we actually ordered was brought to our table about 15 minutes after we got our entrees. They did bring us a dessert for our anniversary, even though we had declined dessert, so that was a nice touch. But when the bill came, the dessert was on it (they ultimately took it off once we pointed it out), we were charged for the more expensive, incorrect side (and were told that it was the same price, but after double checking, it was not), and there was no attempt to apologize for the long delay in our entrees on the bill.

2014-07-01,4.0,"While I never went to the former Japonais and this is my first dance with Morimoto, I was slightly nervous based on some of the yelp reviews and was luckily, very impressed! Overall, I think that Japonais leans towards stellar fusion food and sushi is somewhat of an obligatory inclusion, although we did enjoy our sashimi set.  As avid sushi lovers, the hubby and I thought the roll offerings just weren't that exciting and ended up sticking to the other parts of the menu, and we were not disappointed.  This is definitely a splurge spot, but definitely worth it.    Starting with the food, we ordered the live octopus (my favorite), clam miso for me, and duck soup for him, and split the $40 sashimi and uni carbonara. The live octopus was great, sashimi style cuts drizzled in hot chili oil and other spices served beautifully with a salad in the middle.  The clam miso and duck soup were two other home runs.  Miso is tricky, too much and it over powers, too little and its a step away from water, and this was so delicate and flavorful I'm glad we elected to not split our portions.  The duck soup was great, broth again was amazing, and the meatballs were light and airy. The uni carbonara was extremely decadent, so I'm glad we split this dish.  The sashimi set works in levels, $40, $80, and $120.  We stuck to the $40 and got a good amount of tasty fish (see photos) and were pleased.  If I were to go back, would we get a platter, probably not.  Everything else on the menu is so inventive I would want to play more. We found the service to be spot on, our waiter was nice, fun, and passionate about the food.  The one big compliant I had was the seating.  We were in the back where one side of the table was a booth and the other was a chair, and the booth was literally a foot lower than the table/chair on the other side.  Husband and I had to switch and even he felt like a kid the whole time.  Coming off a fresh renovation, this should have been addressed.  Coupled with sashimi that was above average but nothing home run, I'd say a solid 4.",0.9972,0.773,0.196,0.031,0.5239795918367348
2014-06-27,5.0,"Okay, let's get this out of the way first: you do not go to Morimoto for fast service, large portions, quiet romantic ambience or bang-for-the-buck: you go here for the food, first and foremost. Forget the leisurely pace of service (especially on weekends) and the jackhammer industrial dance beat (trust me, I've heard far worse). The food is the star; and unlike the old Japonais, it transcends sushi and even Japanese-French fusion.    I first encountered Morimoto at his Napa location, and this compares quite favorably with it. In Napa, we arrived at 9pm and were told we were too late for the omakase (tasting) menu. Not so here we arrived 8:35 and our waiter arrived about 9 (after serving us our drinks). No problem getting the omakase this time.  The omakase, at $120 pp before wine pairings, is probably Chicago's best value in degustations. It was pretty much a 7-course (plus sorbet) ""greatest hits."" The tartare was neither maguro nor hamachi, but rather toro (the fatty belly tuna that most sushi bars list but never offer). It was rich, rather generous, and offered interesting accoutrements. The carpaccio was fresh Lake Superior whitefish, with a subtly intriguing light char. Next up was a decidedly eastern spin on the Portuguese classic bagna cauda: delicately crispy calamari and seasonal veggies (including purple carrot)  to dip into a searingly hot olive oil/garlic bath (kept hot over an individual burner). Then came Morimoto's take on bouillabaisse: Manila clams, mussels, whole sweet prawn, scallops with veggies in a savory spicy red miso broth. This was followed by an intense and dense raspberry sorbet and a full sushi course you won't find in the 'hood (unless your 'hood is the Ginza): toro, horse mackerel (as opp. to the usual saba), snapper, Tasmanian salmon and butterfish.  The wasabi is the real thing: grated, not reconstituted powdered horseradish & mustard.  Eat it and you will never have clogged sinuses again (and you will groove on the taste, not just the heat). Then the aforementioned sorbet, and the ""turf & surf & turf."" No holding back: the ""surf"" was no less than the entree menu's lobster masala (claw & tail); the ""turfs,"" pork belly and broth en croute and a Wagyu beef medallion.   Dessert was a medley of passion fruit semifreddo, pistachio gelato, and various delectable mousses, freezes and powdered foams with accompanying sauces.  Wines included two sparklers (Mumm's Napa brut and Veuve Cliquot rosé), an Alto Adige Pinot Grigio, Alsatian Gewurtztraminer, Sancerre, sake, St. Emilion and Sauternes.   The portions, taken individually, were on the smallish side; but ensemble were quite filling, to the point where we didn't dare entertain the nation of tea, coffee or digestifs. We arrived 8:35, and since our son joined us at 9:15 we left at 11:20.  We felt neither rushed nor neglected. And the music had mellowed by then. We'd briefly entertained sitting out on the comfy couches of the patio overlooking the river, but didn't want to tempt the weather gods to make it rain or unleash a plague of skeeters. We will return time and again to plumb the reaches of the app and entree menus, as well as more esoteric sushi and sashimi.",0.9913,0.864,0.104,0.033,0.4788819875776396

Very delicious would definitely recommend  Cons: - Felt that the food was not as amazing for the price paid Review of other dishes ordered - popcorn shrimp: decent, comes with 2 flavors.

Not as tasty as some of the other places in Chicago, fish did not seem as fresh as I would have expected  - duck duck duck - the duck is decent, you get ~4 pieces and a leg so not a lot of food.

Fortunately, the drinks remain spectacular--and easily the best part of the experience.  The best appetizers from the previous menu (like the lobster rolls and the tuna flatbread) were nowhere to be found.  So, we ordered the Tuna Tacos which smelled appalling and a hot appetizer that was at best a celebration of too much garlic and at worst a waste of time. For the main course we shared a variety of sushi items, that were good but not spectacular, and the sea bass which which must have depleted the last of America's garlic resources.   Nothing on the new dessert menu could tempt me, and I can't say that very often! The service was friendly and attentive.  Unfortunately, our server never seemed to grasp the fact that my date is a vegetaran (clearly hurt with the new menu) and I am a heart patient.  So, naturally, he kept pushing the beef items.  Hmm.  I just don't know what to say.  We could have used better recommendations on the new and large menu.

The GOOD: - The sushi is GREAT:  Extremely fresh, expertly cut and with a good amount of variety you usually can't find in the Midwest (uni, abalone, etc).  We ordered one of the platters as well as pieces a la carte and were impressed.  One aside though - they do put the wasabi into the nigiri so if you're not a wasabi fan, you might want to speak up. - The drinks: Tasty and strong.  Highly recommend the White Lily - Braised black cod - cooked perfectly, it just melts in your mouth - Dessert: I'd come back just for drinks and dessert in a heartbeat.  We ordered a couple to split for the table including a chocolate torte and an inventive mango one.   The BAD: - Uni Carbonara:  The flavors were alright but the portions were TINY.  Not at all what I expected for an entree.  You know those small rice bowls you get at a Chinese restaurant?  Yeah... about that size.   - The service:  A little strange all night for the upscale caliber.  We only got one drink menu for the whole table of 7.  Then it was promptly whisked away after the first person ordered.  At times, 4 servers would wait on us.  At others, we had to ask for silverware when food came out because ours had been cleared. The SO-SO: - Seafood Toban Yaki:  The flavors just weren't that unique or compelling. -Braised lamb shank:  Good portions but not that exciting.   - Most of the sides:  We were really excited about the bone marrow potato puree but it really was just a fancy whipped mashed potatoes.  Duck confit rice = sticky rice with a farm egg and some duck meat.",0.9719,0.848,0.119,0.033,0.5634313725490196

The king crab was out of this world and melted in your mouth, the best crab I've ever had. The popcorn shrimp had a delicious flavor to it. The casear salad had a best presentation , topped with quail egg = yum.

2014-04-02,3.0,"I went to Japonais for the first time last night and, while the food was generally good, the experience was underwhelming.   My first gripe is the pricing.  We had one sushi roll, one piece of sushi, two entrees, two glasses of wine, and (after realizing we were both still hungry) two desserts. Total bill after tip was $150.  I'm sorry but a $7 piece of amber jack is ridiculous.  I generally don't like restaurants where you pay for ""scene"" so I guess I should've expected Japonais to be a perfect match for me. I will admit the food was quite good.  The hamachi roll was as expected but the entrees (black cod and uni carbonara) had great flavor.  The black cod looked a bit lonely on the plate without much of a side - I think there were 3 black beans and a few braised shallots.  However the flavors were good.  I recommend the coconut fritters, they were like doughnuts with jelly globs and gelato.  The chocolate salted caramel was missing the latter ingredient.   Overall the value just wasn't there.  In a city like Chicago I think you can more affordable places with a good scene and good food.",0.9664,0.743,0.166,0.091,0.47628205128205126
2014-03-30,4.0,"When Japonais opened 10 years ago, I was living across the street, a surgical intern working 80-90 hours a week.  I remember getting drinks in the basement during its soft opening - I didn't know anything about it other than it was a new bar and restaurant, so you can imagine how out of place I felt walking in wearing a Brian Urlacher jersey and a Bears hat, looking for a place to watch the 3pm games.  Japonais eventually became a neighborhood hot spot, constantly crowded and frequented by celebrities.  Even 10 years later, I felt like it was still getting buzz, and still was getting reasonable traffic, but for whatever reason, it was shut down and reconcepted a few months ago, with Iron Chef Masahiro Morimoto taking over the kitchen after chef Gene Kato left to start up the solid Sumi Robata Grill.  Over the past few weeks since it reopened, there's been some excellent buzz, and a friend was in town who wanted to get some sushi so it was off to my old stomping groups we went to. We started our meal with the toro tartare  - a visually stunning display - a plate of high quality tuna belly that's chopped finely into a paste-like consistency so it's essentially a spread.  You basically take a small bite with your serving utensil - essentially a small spatula and dip it into one of the many accoutrements - soy, wasabi cream, creme fraiche, rice crackers, guac, and scallions (I think I got 'em all).  The plate is great, although with the toro chopped so finely, I think you lose a little of the quality flavor of the toro.  This was a fantastic dish, although for $28, a bit pricey.   Next up is the ""popcorn shrimp"" - lightly fried rock shrimp in two different sauces - the first (above) a slightly spicy gochujang sauce, the second (below) a wasabi aioli - both mild, both a bit creamy and rich, neither with enough bite to really be impressive, but good.    The tableside tofu was the first real highlight of the night, and probably where you're going to get the most bang for your buck here.  I was sitting opposite the end where the waiter was explaining the process, but it involved ending with the statement ""this doesn't work about 30% of the time"" - which I think is an overstatement, because I doubt they would be doing it that much.   But anyhoo - the tofu mixes perfectly with the kimchi sauce and soy dashi broth making a nice spicy, soy base sauced - sprinkle in a bit of fresh ginger to add a bit of bite to the dish - a healthy portion that gave all six of us a pretty good portion.   The sushi at Japonais hasn't seemed to change much since before, in that it's well above average.  The nigiri pieces - we got chutoro, kinmedai (big eye snapper), and hotate (scallop) - all very fresh - the chutoro was juuuuust a bit chewy, and the sushi rice was pretty average, and where Japonais' sushi gets docked the most points.  The choices of rolls don't stray too far from normal - which is a good thing, and allow the quality of the fish and ingredients to speak for themselves - we got a soft shell crab roll, spicy tuna, and spicy yellowtail - all simple and bare bones, and delish...From a pure sushi standpoint, Japonais easily stands in the upper third or quarter, but I still won't put it at the level of Katsu or the now closed Masaki - both places I think that set the bar for sushi in Chicago.    We move on to the entree portion of the meal, getting the uni carbonara, the Ishi Yaki Hamachi Bop, and the Duck Confit Fried Rice.  All three dishes were solid and where Japonais really shines.  The Carbonara was tossed with very thin rice noodles that soaked up the rich uni sauce perfectly.  The quail egg mixes to add to the creamy consistency, and the english peas and pancetta spice up the textures nicely.  The Ishi Yaki Hamachi Bop was a little underwhelming - the fish was fresh and seared just a bit on the side of the stone bowl, but the mixture of ingredients ended up a bit blander than expected when stacked next to the uni carbonara and the duck confit fried rice, which may have been one of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had.  Simple, but extremely rich and flavorful, and the egg mixed in perfectly with the rice.   In the end, Japonais was never bad to begin with, and I feel they kind of made a lateral move - it's still a scene, the decor is different, but has the same vibe.  The sushi is great, but still could move up a notch or two.  The money on the menu is in the savory dishes - the hot appetizers and the entrees.  It's still pricey, but won't quite break the bank, and ended up being much less than I thought it would going into the night.  It's a great spot for a medium-sized group (4-8).  And btw, get the Serenity off the cocktail menu - it's dangerous....

2014-03-17,3.0,"I was super excited to see Japonais recharged by Morimoto.  Japonais in the early days was fantastic, but it slowly started to go downhill a bit.  I wish I could have been blown away by the changes, but I wasn't.  In fact the inside looks the same.  Why was it closed for so long?  I came here with my boyfriend for a post-Valentine's Day dinner.  We were seated in the same old awkward half booth table.  The one where the booth is much lower than the table.  And you're very close to your neighbors and the speakers.  There were moments when we couldn't hear anything.  The service was ok.  She was too attentive at first.  I needed a min to figure out my game plan.  And then, I suppose because they got busy, she seemed to disappear.  With the food there were hits and misses.  Our drinks were just wine and sake so I can't comment on the cocktails.  We wanted to try many things but didn't want the full chef's tasting.  So we went with a bunch of shared plates. 2 colds: Hamachi tacos - we loved this one.  Little crunchy delights.  They were perfectly seasoned. And the Toro Tartare which we did not care for.  It was more flash and no substance.  You get a vertical piece of glass with the tuna on it and then little pots of sauces.  You use a spatula to get the tartare and the accompaniments which was incredibly awkward.  A lot of the stuff ended up in the ice.  The spatula reminded me of Jolen bleach for your face.  2 hots:  ""pop corn"" shrimp.  We could not get enough of this!  Two kinds of shrimp, both were a different kind of spice.  So delicious.  Next time order 2 of them.  Also the king crab which was super tasty and covered in this wonderful spicy sauce.  The hots were a hit!  Then we went with 1 main the ishi yaki hamachi bop.  This was like a molcajete with asian flavors.  We liked it.  The hamachi was a little fishy in some spots for me but we cleaned that bowl.

2014-03-09,5.0,"If you think you know Japonais because you've been here before ... think again. Since the end of 2013, the establishment has undergone renovations & even a little re-branding. Didn't know Japonais was related to Morimoto? Don't worry - that's, in a nutshell, what's new. But this is no empty celebrity hype: with not only a redone interior but also a retooled menu, this Japonais 2.0 certainly blows the old Japonais out of the water. Why? Let's break it down: Decor/Ambiance: The first thing you notice you walk in is that this place is swanky. The addition of the open kitchen really helps, and everything from the lighting to the music to the setup oozes trendy vibes. (It's also REALLY loud in here, which kind of reminds me of club-level volume, at times.) My friends and I certainly all thought we were a tad underdressed (oops?). Drinks: There is an extensive, extensive list of sake drinks (which I believe is new), but also beer and hard-alcohol cocktails. I got the Serenity, which was absolutely HEAVENLY tasting (I liked it so much that I unfortunately finished it before my entrees arrived ...). Two of my friends got beers (they were also very content), and a last friend got the flirty bird (sp?), which she thought was only okay. Overall, though, my party was generally impressed with both the selection and quality of the drinks. Food: Unsurprisingly, there's a lot of seafood. Surprisingly, my party stuck to mostly non-seafood: + Kakuni (pork belly appetizer): this was amazing, and probably my favorite dish of the night. The meat is so, so tender, and the flavors are so delectable that we were scraping the bowl with our forks, trying to get every last bit of congee + Hamachi Tacos: I didn't have any (one order comes with two), but my friends seemed to think they were good + Duck Duck Duck: this dish presents duck in three forms: pieces of duck breast, duck confit (on the bone), and duck meatball soup. The meat was great and all, but for me the absolute standout of this dish is the duck confit fried rice that came with it (had an egg on top), which is a very close second for my favorite dish of the night. Luckily, you can order it as a side - I'd definitely recommend getting it, if you don't want a whole entree's worth of duck. + Pork Chop & 'Applesauce': this portion size was ridiculous ... whereas the kakuni and even the Duck Duck Duck entrees were (deceptively?) small, this dish is enormous and definitely share-able. While the flavors were interesting (ginger apple puree?), it wasn't my favorite dish. + Lamb Shank: the meat was falling off the bone, and my friend (who likes lamb) was a very happy camper. + Salted Caramel Dessert: This was very rich, and a satisfying end to the meal. I do kind of wish we'd tried a more interesting, fusion-esque dessert, though ... Service: Phenomenal. I wish I'd gotten the name of our waitress, but she was not only personable and responsive, but incredibly, incredibly helpful. It was clear that she knew the menu inside and out - and most importantly, she was always spot on with her recommendations (we asked her for recommendations at practically every turn ... we chose based on what she said for almost everything, and boy, am I glad we did!). Bottom Line: I had been to and eaten from Japonais a few times before its redesign, and wasn't a huge fan - so I wasn't expecting too much this time around. But the experience I did have was delightful, and although the meal cost more than a pretty penny (Yelp isn't kidding when it says $$$$!), my party of four left the restaurant deep into food coma, and more than content with what we'd eaten.

I forget the exact names of the menu items but if you want a light healthy sweet desert go with the banana and if you want to be blown away with chocolate go with the chocolate desert. It comes and looks like it would only feed a baby but just wait... Drink: I have only been to a few places that take their drinks as seriously as this place, Violet Hour, The Aviary... you get the picture. They have a lot of drinks that smell different than they taste, and if you know anything about making drinks... that isn't easy! I have basically had every drink on the menu here and they are all a notch above the rest. If you sit at the bar and watch them make them (which I highly recommend) you will see bartenders making flame come out of orange peels, taking torches to drink garnishes, chiseling ice by hand from large blocks it goes on and on. These bartenders know what they are doing, plane and simple. One of our experiences at the bar was after dinner we sat for one last drink and ended up staying for 3 hours more. The bartender would make us our drinks, explain the origin and purpose of each ingredient, pro and con, pair, taste test.. it does not get any better than that. I recommend the Stormy Weather, the Nardis, Whip the Mule and Smoke in Your Eyes. Service: I have no idea how we order the food that we do, coming out looking and tasting the way it does that fast. I was curious about this at first until I literally watched them make my dish from scratch once and everything was FRESH!!! We have been to this place 3 times and the second time we came there were 3 employees that referred to us by name. This is some of the friendliest staff I have seen in the River North area, which is very refreshing, I hate going to places where the staff makes you feel like they hate their jobs. Back to the details: Free coat check, friendly door greeter (even the valet guys outside say hello), great host/hostesses, amazing bartenders and severs that know the entire menu as if they created it. I also need to mention the fact while you are dining here it feels like there are 100 staff members refreshing silverware, plates, fixing things, asking you how everything is. I even had a girl come by and refold my napkin for me.... is this real life? Restaurant: Very similar to the old Japonais with a few important updates. New seating, new upstairs bar area, new sushi bar, new menu, new drinks, some new staff. This restaurant is very clean and maintained very well. They are re-opening the bar/lounge downstairs in April/May and are very excited to see the upgrades that happen there.  Big shout out to our favorite server Chris Wade, our favorite bartender Caroline and the manager Zach. This place is obviously great but you guys make it worth coming back again and again. Keep up the great work!!! -Anthony & Megan",0.9985,0.761,0.171,0.068,0.5694166030048382
2014-02-28,3.0,"Food: 4.5 stars. There is really a lot of thought behind each dish my friends and I tried. Everything was really, really good Cost-benefit: 3 starts. One of the most expensive Japanese restaurants I have ever gone to. You could eat much better Japanese food in town for a LOT less. Ambiance: 4 stars. Music was a bit too laud for my taste, but in a table of 8, we were able to chat with one another reasonably comfortably without having to yell (at least not too much) Service: 1.5 stars. Definitely the low point of my night. A bottle of sake took almost 25 minutes to be served after we ordered. More than half of the table was finished with their meals for more than 20 minutes when my food arrived. In total, i believe I waited more than 1 hour for a (beautifully cooked, but very simple) sea bass dish.",0.8701,0.892,0.09,0.018,0.4780257936507936
2014-02-24,5.0,"Came in for my birthday dinner on Friday. It was an exceptional experience for a number of reasons. First of all, my sister had a severely broken leg but did not want to pass up my birthday. We let the restaurant know ahead of time and they were perfect with accommodating us with a booth where she could have her leg elevated. The most ideal part was that once service started no one asked or even took a second glance at her leg (while avoiding bumping it while reaching over the table when they needed to). My sister was really nervous about it being overwhelming but there was a perfect balance of accommodation and then making her feel as though it was just a normal night out. The food was wonderful. We had a great mix of appetizers, entrees, sashimi and sushi rolls. Standouts from what I ate were the pork belly appetizer, the live octopus carpaccio, the duck entree and all of the sashimi and nigiri we had. I didn't get to try everything but I didn't hear a complaint from the entire table. Cocktails were also great, and they had many affordable bottles of wine when we moved on to that. I had intended this to be a special occasion type place but I will definitely be returning on a regular basis after this past visit.",0.9881,0.77,0.174,0.056,0.5821220446220446

As we were seated we were informed that chef Morimoto did a surprise drop in.  The food was AMAZING and oozed of iron chef!  Everything we had was robust, innovative & memorable.   Popcorn shrimp, sea bass, hamachi bowl, himachi tacos, edamame, 2 sushi rolls, lobster masala and the coconut fritters.    Love that it's right around the corner bc we WILL be back!!!!

2014-02-24,2.0,"Sigh. I had high hopes for this place but one word can describe the food: SALTY.  I ordered the sea urchin carbonara. Understandably it was going to have some saltiness to it since it's made with pancetta but this dish was extremely salty!  Each bite was salty salty salty!  The piece of sea urchin in this dish was tiny and the pancetta was not crunchy.  The foie gras oyster did meld well, which surprised me but in terms of flavor it was just ok, nothing to brag about.  It would have probably been better if a higher quality oyster was used.  A few of my friends ordered other dishes that they stated were amazing. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes. I did have a bite of my friend's filet. It was chewy and flavor was lacking. He said it was amazing though so it could just be me.  The toro tartare was phenomenal. It just melts in your mouth. That was the only redeeming factor.  Then again, the fish is served raw.  I expected so much more for a Morimoto restaurant. I feel like the popularity of this place turns out mediocre food quickly to keep up with the pace of restaurant goers.",0.985,0.818,0.163,0.019,0.6238269230769231
2014-02-23,5.0,"Ha! Who would have thought I would be going to Morimoto restaurant in Chicago?  Traveling for work and our crew wanted some great sushi and after some researching, we found Japonais by Morimoto! Since most of us are from NYC, we knew what level to expect! :) First, loved how ppl working there are so happy and friendly:)   Food - we ordered to share so we can see how different Chicago is vs. NYC! sushi - as expected was the bomb! (Sushi combo and nigiri sushi)  Toro was amazing! (Pricy, but its so yummy and company expense, so why not!) Calamari salad- totally refreshing! Esp portion was great and they seemed to use a different type of greens vs. NYC's mixed greens Braised Lamb - I usually don't eat lamb (too gammy for me) but since it was something different,  we ordered and it was such a sophisticated dish! Loved the polished Japanese rice risotto and the combination was just perfect!  Its a must try! Steak- I know it sounds silly, but since we were in Chicago, why not have a steak!?!  We ordered wagyu steak/ NY strip and it was so juicy and perfectly cooked! ( we asked for medium/rare) and the best thing was the price was much less than NYC! Dessert - we had to try the caramel chocolate cake and the airy cheesecake.  The presentation was a 3 star Michelin level and the taste? Its a must try! Chocolate cake was just perfect (not to sweet/ not too bitter)  and the cheesecake, I could eat it all day long! Its super fluffy and just perfect like a souffle! (Reminded me of the souffle cake I had at Winsor court hotel's Grill Room. Yummy! ) Over all, I usually don't write long reviews, but I had such a great time with my colleagues and the food/ambiance/service was just perfecccct and I am so happy to write this review! :) Chef Morimoto, job well-done in Chicago!  :D Would love to come back when its warm to dine by the river!!!",0.999,0.723,0.277,0.0,0.6390873015873016
2014-02-23,3.0,"First time dining here since they re-opened. Food was good, the wait was not. We were told ""The chefs appreciate if you place your sushi order all at once""  Seemed a little odd, but ok, when in Rome..... So we placed our order for what seemed like the appropriate amount of food, had two courses served then had to wait about 30 minutes for the next few courses.  I wasn't exactly full, but didn't want to place an additional order for fear of antagonizing the chefs and being forced to wait another half hour. Maybe they're still ironing out the  kinks.",-0.8286,0.778,0.082,0.14,0.3363636363636364

2014-02-18,3.0,"It pains me to write this review...but before you write it off as ""three stars for Morimoto? This girl is crazy!"", hear me out. I've dined at other Morimoto restaurants, and used to enjoy Japonais before it got a little rough around the edges (c'mon, we all know it's true), so when my boyfriend made reservations to try out Japonais by Morimoto I was pumped.   We arrived a few minutes after our reservation, and the hostess directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  Front door staff was friendly, and service in the bar was good.  As an added surprise, Chef Morimoto was on hand for the Kagami biraki, a traditional Japanese ceremony that involves opening a cask of sake to celebrate the opening of a new business, wedding, etc... Chef poured sake for everyone in the bar, and seemed really gracious about posing for photographs with fans. The ceremony was a nice touch; however, we waited nearly an hour after our reservation for a table.  We weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a huge deal, but I would have really appreciated a heads up from the hostess when we arrived that the ceremony would delay our seating.  Honestly, I think they just forgot about us.     On to the food.  The menu is chaotic. There is an array of cold plates, hot plates, salads, soups, entrees, and sushi.  We started with the oysters.  One of my oysters wasn't shucked well, and a I nearly choked on a piece of shell.  Yikes!  Flavor-wise, the various presentations were unique and flavorful...good, but not great.   Highlight of the evening was the sashimi.  The pieces were large, and quality was top notch.  We also sampled a simple maki (salmon, cucumber, jalapeno) and it was really good, too.   From there, we didn't really know where to go.  Several of the entrees sounded good, but since this was our first time dining here we thought we'd order a few small plates.  In hindsight, this might not have been the way to go...or maybe we just ordered wrong.  We settled on the a calamari salad, the pork belly and the 'popcorn' shrimp.  There were several tartare/carpaccio dishes that looked good, too, but we wanted something warm after the sashimi.  Again, nothing really jumped out as ""order me"" and after twenty minutes of thinking, I had 'menu fatigue' and just wanted to eat dinner :) None of the dishes were bad...however, nothing was memorable.  The pork belly was flavorful, but tough.  The calamari salad was large, and dressed well, but I felt that there was too much calamari, and the fried flavor took over the salad.  The popcorn shrimp are a cute idea, and would make a great bar snack...however, the shrimp was really 'fishy'.  Bottom line...for the price and the 'hype', I want to walk out of the restaurant thinking ""when are we coming back?""  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be heading back to Japonais anytime soon--hence, my three star review.",0.771,0.825,0.096,0.079,0.5192099567099566
2014-02-18,4.0,"We went to Japonais by Morimoto on Saturday evening.  The energy and décor of the restaurant was great.  We ordered the Omakase tasting menu.  The courses were well thought out and delicious.  The plating of the plates seemed to take a long time. There were long gaps between each dish.  Even our waitress kept apologizing since it was very obvious.  The whole meal took almost 4 hours!  My only complaint was that I wasn't full at the end.  Next time, I think I'll order from the regular menu so I can get more food for my money.",0.8687,0.845,0.121,0.034,0.4939102564102564

The food was amazing!! We had the tuna tartar, ""delicious""; dumplings, ""wow""; then we order some sushi, and maki rolls ""excellent""; for desert, we order tofu cheesecake ""delicatessen"".
