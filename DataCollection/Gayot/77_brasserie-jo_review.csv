2010-10-14,4.0,"I panicked when I read Brasserie Jo is closed, but was reassured by the message on its website that it will re-open as a more casual french bistro.  The thing is, I first ate at Brasserie Jo in the mid-90's, and at that time, it WAS a casual french bistro.  It had paper tablecloths, casual china, and a bustling atmosphere.  It was very close in feeling to places I'd been to in eastern France when I was a poor student there, and got great cheap meals at bistros.  But the last time I went to Brasserie Jo, it had become formal and stuffy.  Formal china, tablecloths, a hushed room.  The prices had gone up substantially.  We totaled about $75/person, and only had 1 drink each.  So the restaurant changed from its original incarnation.  The food was always stupendous though.  When I think of those lists of ""Best of Chicago"", Brasserie Jo has two of them.  Best Coq au vin, far and away above anything else in the city.  And best profiteroles in Chicago, which are hard to compare with others in the city since so few restaurants make them.  I hope the new restaurant will be similar to what Brasserie Jo was like many years ago, and will still have the coq au vin and profiteroles.",0.9925,0.762,0.206,0.032,0.4678484848484849

Both were delicious, but the salmon was very nice - a generous amount of salmon, hard boiled egg, capers, and onion. Very light and tasty; a good summer flambee. The classic of fromage blanc, onion, and bacon was a fine accompaniment to the beverages. The complimentary warm bread and carrots were an added bonus. Four solid stars. The service = weird. We basically had two different servers; one was attentive and got our drinks/put in our food order lickety split. We ordered another round of drinks with our other server; she put in our order then talked to her friend for about 15 minutes while our drinks sat at the bar. Finally, the hostess went over to break up their conversation. So, minus a star.  Overall experience = 3 stars.

2010-07-21,4.0,"My husband took me here for my birthday dinner, which was also the same night the French people of Chicago happened to be celebrating Bastille Day. We were able to listen to the live blues band which was really fun. The entire dinner took 2.5 hours - service was a little slow, but this also made us feel like we were actually in France (and we were in no hurry, anyway). The baguette that came out with our drinks was WONDERFUL. I did not care for the carrot salad, as I abhor horseradish, which completely overwhelmed the dish. However, the carrots & baguette are included free, so who am I to complain? My husband enjoyed the unique beer list. Our favorite was from Belgium, which came out in a bulbous glass in a wooden holder. I had some Cote du Rhone red wine by the glass, which was A-OK. For appetizers we had the onion soup (delish, although I had a bit of a problem trying to consume the large blob of cheese without being too messy), and a frisée salad with a poached egg on top. Anything with a poached egg on top is usually good, and this salad didn't disappoint. Although I was initally concerned about the frisée being too much like a hairball, it was fine (and of course, the egg helped things along). For our entrées, we ordered the Steak au Poivre and the duck. Both were amazingly delicious, although the steak won, hands down. The pepper sauce was really good, and the steak was perfectly cooked to medium. For dessert we ordered some coffee and the server brought us a complimentary small chocolate mousse to share since it was my birthday. We didn't even have to say anything, as my husband had made a note of it when he made a reservation on open table. It was a really sweet way to end the meal. Overall, everything was really tasty, and I would definitely come back here for drinks. (I want to check out that beer list again.)

A wonderful time had for a friend's engagement party here was slightly tempered that we found out that this place is shutting down August 28th and most likely reconceptualizing. However...  if you make the nifty choice of stopping by here before that fateful day, you will find some smart things on the menu. By smart I mean damn tasty.  Since I attended the party, I only got snippets of the menu, however what I had were some quite nice noshes. A little cheeseburger, some tasty crab cakes, mini chocolate mousses, (or is it meeses?), and of course to wash it all down was a bevy of beverages that would make the staunchest of beer snobs happy. Their beer list is quite divine. Extensive and varied, my friend had them passing out eight different brews to pair with all the appetizers. Though of course my favorite was the champagne beer, (sadly I can't find it on their list). Light, bubbly and certainly helped formed the w's around my 'o' face.  But above all that was had, the staff was extremely knowledgeable about all that they had beer and wine wise as well as immensely friendly to all of us. That was the true topper of the night.

2010-07-11,2.0,"The most bizarre service I've ever had at a bar.  As the bartender would be in the process of pouring  our drinks, he would stop to fill servers' orders and have us waiting there. We were greeted by him, given the beer and wine menus, not even asked what we'd like and he runs off leaving us sitting there wanting to place our order. He really didn't have a flow down and was spinning his wheels the whole time. Very unsettling for us. He doesn't belong downtown.  Now for the food--Yes the bread is good but I don't understand all the raves about it. Skimpy portions on the appetizer and salad and they weren't that great. Skatewing won rave reviews from my partner for his entree. Onion tart was good as well. Service didn't match up to the prices. Not a good value for the money. There are a lot better places that would cost the same. Atmosphere is pleasant. Valet  price is ridiculous. Price goes up as time rolls on. Never heard of that for valet parking.

2010-07-06,1.0,"Some months back, my go-to girlfriend for dining and I decided to have an all-out girls' night to treat ourselves and escape the winter blues. I had received a Lettuce Entertain You gift certificate around that time, and we decided to check out Brasserie Jo and use this certificate toward a nice meal with some nice drinks.  We went all out - we tried absinthe for the first time ever - which was neat (and potent), and our waitress thankfully walked us through everything.   Still, the service was SO SLOW.  This may have been the slowest service I've had YET in Chicago.  We felt as though we were somewhat ignored due to being in our mid-20s (versus the older couples and parties surrounding us).  Our waitress, first off, was given way too much to handle!  She had two large parties besides us, and therefore, us being a party of 2, got the shaft.  We waited to be greeted (about 10 minutes), waited to ORDER drinks (15 minutes), waited to RECEIVE our absinthe another 10-15 minutes, and still hadn't been asked if we were ready to order our food (and we wanted to course it out).  Now, my friend and I usually aren't the types to stir up trouble whatsoever, and in fact are pretty easy to please as long as you make that effort to please us.  We have both been servers for years of our life, and know the stresses of the restaurant life.  Still, our waitress should have asked for more help, and the manager should have taken note of our neglect.  We asked to speak to the manager, and a little while later, a young, timid-looking (and acting) guy came over, and could hardly appease us.  He apologized and said he would see to it that we would have escalated service for the rest of the night.  That was hardly a consolation for the time waited and the ignorant service.  I was pretty surprised and taken aback that this is the way the manager handled us requesting to see him.  Again, we felt like we weren't being taken seriously due to being younger, and we felt like he didn't have much authority yet (he certainly did not have that managerial air about him). Anyhow, our food was pretty good, but given the circumstances, it was more difficult to enjoy the rest of the evening, and after we talked to our waitress, we could tell that she didn't really want to stop by our table at all for the rest of the night. I am disappointed by this experience, and was expecting a much better time.  I wish the manager would have provided us with some sort of incentive apology, via words that meant nothing.  Thanks, yelp, for allowing me to vent!",0.9807,0.811,0.135,0.054,0.4837606837606837
2010-06-29,4.0,"I have been here several times in the past with my mom, and as somebody who loves good beer and good food I really enjoy this place. The ambiance is nice, the service is good and the prices are pretty reasonable for what you get. In terms of beer, their tap list is quite solid - a good variety between US brewers (including local establishments like Metropolitan and Two Brothers) and international ones, especially Belgian beers. They have a few standards, but their tap list constantly changes, with lots of special and seasonal beers. The last time I was there, they had an oak-aged version of Two Brothers Domaine DuPage, as well as Duvel Green (a tap-only beer from the Belgian brewery). Their staff tends to be able to give good recommendations, although the amount of beer knowledge varies from server to server. The food is also very good. The baguette and carrot salad are both well done and good to nibble on while waiting for dinner. I have had several of the entrees - including the sweetbreads and tongue - and they have all ranged from good to excellent. I can't think of a bad meal I've had here. The service is also good, although I've had a few snags here and there. One time my mother and I were seated right next to a wait station and near a loud party in another room, despite the fact that most of the other tables were available.

Their bread is great and having seasoned raw carrots with the bread as you are seated is very orginal. The Onion soup is very good, maybe a bit too much cheese on it but very tasty. Their tartes flambees are good but still not at the level of Pierrot Gourmet at the Peninsula hotel. The steaks are good at Brasserie JO, they use a cheap cut of meat and make it taste good but their steak isn't in the same league as Gibsons, Capital Grille etc. I ate their Rack of Lamb on the weekend and it was very poor. The lamb was much too fatty and the fat on the outside of the rack hadn't been cooked for long enough so it stayed as solid fat as opposed to the lovely cracking that I would expect from a rack of lamb. Their museels are good and well priced like everything in Brasserie JO but when going here you need to be sensible about what you order (maybe avoid the oysters and go for the steak au poivre and other french staples).",0.9869,0.789,0.17,0.041,0.41684710351377025

The steak frites were great with the 4 mayo's for dipping, the hot french baguette with butter was to die for, and the french onion soup was equally as wonderful.

Nice texture, too.      - We got my Mom to get the ox tail (which I believe was a special), which was quite the achievement. She left very happy, saying she was glad she got it, but won't feel the need to search out ox tail in the future.      - I got the Choucroute Alsacienne.

Bottom line: good food executed mostly very well, unpretentious presentation, good drinks, excellent service, and only slightly overpriced, which for River North, well. We were there while it was slow, so the atmosphere was pleasantly quiet. Chef Joho was in the restaurant as well, chatting with some customers, which is always nice to see. We had tarte flambee and the house beer to start. I really love tarte flambee and theirs was great with smokey Gruyere and earthy mushrooms. The house beer was good. They have a lengthy beer list with lots of Belgian options (France is not exactly known for beer, okay).  Bonus: they have my favorite beer of all time, Coniston Bluebird Bitter. Our server was very sweet and helped my girlfirend navigate a not-overly-friendly-to-vegetarians menu. She settled on baked macaroni (basically, some very indulgent mac-and-cheese) and I had the sauteed walleye. The fish was perfectly cooked, in a delicate mustard vinaigrette. The frisee accompaniment was unfortunately heavily salted. We finished by splitting a meringue with caramel and vanilla sauce. Delicious. And a specialty cocktail each: a burnt caramel Manhattan and a citrusy cocktail made with St Germain. Also delicious.

2010-02-23,4.0,"I just ate at Brasserie Jo this past Saturday night. I had heard good things and had been wanting to try it for a while. The verdict is that I loved it and was very satisfied with my experience. My gin and tonic came out nice and stiff - good start. The fresh, warm, crusty baguette on the table was a very pleasant surprise. I bypassed the Restaurant Week menu, which didn't look all that special, and got the pate and classic tarte flambee for starters. Both were excellent, particularly the tarte and its soft, yummy bacon goodness. For my entree I got the lamb. Lamb is my favorite meat, and I usually order it whenever I see it on a menu. This was by far the best lamb I've ever had in Chicago. Tasty charred crust, soft flavorful center, and a pretty good sized portion. Wonderful. Some mint sauce would've been nice, but perhaps that's not the French way of serving it. The flageolet beans that came with it were creamy and flavorful but nothing to go nutty over. The one star gets taken off for the desserts, which were very average. I've had better creme brulee elsewhere, and the pear/chocolate thingy was an interesting combo but fell short of my expectations given the quality of the previous dishes.

2010-02-12,1.0,"Being a serious Francophile, I really wanted to like Brasserie JO. I mean, who doesn't want to be able to get a good steak frites every now and then? Too bad it wasn't good! This was unarguably the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Let's start at the beginning shall we? The restaurant is very cute and service is excellent, but my friend wasn't joking when she said it's not exactly a young spot. No worries, I don't need trendy hipster, urban chic or posh yuppie to enjoy a restaurant experience.  On to the food! The baguette and carrots were tasty. I love that the baguette was actually crusty! My friend and I ordered the escargot-- let me just say, I love escargot. LOVE! And, I've eaten it loads of times, but this was the worst escargot I've ever tasted. The parsley garlic butter was like water and I'm not so sure it was actually butter... the escargot themselves, not particularly good or bad, just meh.  We were both disappointed and decided to order the mussels as I'd read only good things. Well, the sauce was tasty, but the mussels were by no means fresh and my companion had to finish them as I was too grossed out by the super-fishy smell and taste. I understand it's hard to get good mussels in the midwest, but I've had much better down the street at Tizi Melloul. Maybe B.J. --get you're giggles out and continue reading-- should inquire about Tizi's distributor.  Now for the main course I had the hanger steak medium rare. It wasn't evenly cooked and tasted....like salt. That's it, just salt. Now I realize that french food can seem boring to some because they don't really use spices--outside of salt, pepper and herbs de Provence--and are much more interested in the natural taste of the foods...but, there was no need to compensate with salt. I mean, it took 2 glasses of water to get half my steak down and potatoes paille weren't any less salty, so I didn't even bother to try to eat them. Did I meantion the bernaise was bland? No? well, I guess that was overridden by memories of salt.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the creme brulee, which I find is really hard to mess up. Thank you B.J. for getting that right, but it doesn't make up for the fact that I spent $60 and still went home and picked at leftovers.",0.9917,0.707,0.182,0.111,0.5496218487394957

The French Onion Soup was fine and there wasn't anything wrong with the smoked salmon and capers, but there isn't really much to that so it's not going to save them.  My hanger steak was nice enough, but the sauce wasn't very good.  I can't even remember what the hubby ordered.  Now, the service was good and I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, but since three is overreaching I'm going with two.

One of my favorite things to do at a restaurant, is order different appetizers and not only do you get more for your money, but it allows you to sample the different types of food that they have, and also it creates a ""sharing"" experience for you and your friend that you can take advantage of, while pleasantly elongating your conversation.  We ordered the foie gras plate, the mussels in garlic broth, the cheese plate, and the profiterole for dessert.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the mussels, because even after we were done, I could still dip my bread in the broth, and the broth was as tasty as ever. It didn't have that strong fishy taste or too garlicky either. Just right.  The foie gras plate was also amazing, which was accompanied by some Dijon mustard and beef jelly to go with it.

We began with the escargot - I did enjoy them very much, especially dipping the bread in the garlic butter sauce.  I also had some onion soup with tons of cheese and bread baked over it - it was a lovely, savory, hot pot of comfort. My entree was a special, the cabernet-braised short rib.  I liked it, but it wasn't as heart-stoppingly good as I'd hoped.  The meat was flavorful but lacked a juiciness I would have appreciated.  The root vegetables and polenta on the side were tasty, if uninspired.  It was a perfectly fine dish, but it didn't make me want to savor each bite. The creme brulee was really quite big, and it was perfect.  I adored each bite, if only I could finish it!

I recommend: Tarte Flambee Classic with fromage blanc, lardons, and onions  Hanger steak with Bernaise Baked French Macaroni with ham and cheese Skate Wing with caper-brown butter  Brasserie JO has outdoor seating in the summertime  which makes it an ideal spot to nibble on some pate or oysters with champagne or a glass of vino.

The Tarte Flambee is $9.50 and easily serves 2. All tables are served a petite loaf of warm French Baguette. It is very good---crusty and flakey outside with a nice soft interior.  The main courses are all very generous. The restaurant carries some great beers and a respectable wine list.  But the best thing about this place is the fact that you'll always find a table.

2009-08-22,2.0,"Tuesday 7:30pm  Dinner for 2: FYI this review is based on only 1 visit and I do intend to try this restaurant again and I hope to come back to the review and give this place 3 stars.  I want to like it here because its reasonably priced and has a handsome look.  But my first meal was more misses than hits... B    Chicken Liver Mouse and Country Pate'    Nice that is came with warm toasty slices of baguette (as it should)  Really rich and tasty, enough to share. C     Tartes Flambees (classic Alsac style pizza) smoked salmon capers onion.             This was a real miss for me.  Be warned; we ordered this thinking appetizer but it's a big portion;  Enough for 4 to share comfortably.  It's one mild tasting dish.  The dough is crispy, a great crunch, generous layer of fresh salmon but without the strong smoky salmon taste... it was more like a salmon rumor.             And then there were three 'special effects' ingredients;  capers (which are there but you will not taste)  a whole layer of caramelized onions which I didn't even realize was there until I moved the salmon out of the way and lastly and leastly bits of mozzarella cheese... I'm guessing it was mozzarella because it didn't add anything to the dish.    This dish didn't offend, and truth be told I kept eating it, probably because I love smoked salmon and there was so much of it there.    C+   Classic Steak Frites, Mustard Butter.      The good:  A huge portion of meat here. It says to you: hi, welcome to the Midwest.  It IS a deal at $19.95.    The bad:  now there is certainly no wrong way to present streak & fries but it just wasn't quite what I expected.  The meat was pounded flat, piarde-style, so it was really thin with char grill marks.  It was nice, but something you'd get from a backyard barbecue.    The real bad: the frites: Ummm better than McDonalds not as good as Wendy's.  And over-salted of course.   B    Service.  Friendly, knowledgable.  I wish our server came over just one more time during the meal; she disappeared for awhile. B+   Décor.   Nice aesthetics here.  It's a big drafty-feeling space though, high ceilings, a big restaurant.   Only one TV I could spy which was by the bar.  But it wasn't playing Sports!  It was playing B&W Julia Child episodes; I can deal with that. A   Floating Islands.              Get this desert.  The most intense flavor explosion in your mouth of vanilla, almondy, caramel goodness.  It's an airy custard perfect to share and linger over.  You'll take a bite and need a break.  If you finish the whole thing yourself your taste buds will go into a flavor coma.  What I found after my first visit:  This is an American restaurant serving American portions of American food that are given French names.",0.9968,0.748,0.19,0.062,0.5155706075533661

I didn't pick it for the food or reviews on yelp...I picked it because they are dog friendly and I wanted to dine alfresco with my fiance and dog. We weren't able to make reservations for the patio - which is tiny- but upon our arrival there was one table left! Happy Birthday to me...The hostess said she would bring our dog water and treats but that didn't happen. I would have gotten up to ask, but unfortunately my pup has seperation issues and i didn't want him to bust into the restaurant, knocking over tables and waiters, following me. I brought treats myself because this was our first experience dining with him.   I loved the carrots that greeted us upon sitting at the table. The bread was warm and chewy (in the right way). I had a glass of bubbly to start- they had a respectable selection of wines. We ordered the shrimp appetizer that is served warm with Israeli cous cous- it was delicious but a very French portion with only three medium shrimp. Oh well...leave them wanting more, right? They had a plethora of appetizers I wanted to try.  For my meal I ordered the sauteed walleye pike and my SO ordered steak frites. The frites were delicious, but I didn't try the steak. It was reportedly good but we both don't get the butter on top thing. My fish was sauteed just right and I adored the salad along side- frisee with potatoes and little fried onions served in a vinagrette. We didn't order dessert as doggie was getting antsy (and I wanted a huge cake). Our server was very nice, but a bit absent when we could have used more bread. However I prefer absent to asking for feedback too often. The music was just the right volume and I really enjoyed how the doors of the restaurant opened to the patio.

We were given a small three-entree menu to choose from, though most of us ordered a starter dish.  The oft-mentioned French Onion soup was a nice choice, but if you can split it with someone (both because of its volume and price), do so.  I got the NY Strip with pomme frites (French for ""Freedom Fries""), but I think they either switched my order with someone else's, or they have a very different idea of how a medium steak should be cooked than I do...it was a bit too pale for my liking.  I wouldn't be surprised if I had the wrong one...there was a bit of shuffling of plates and sending things back on our end of the table. The final kicker was at the end of our meal, when we looked at the bill and exclaimed ""Sacrebleu!"", which is French for ""Daaaaaayumn!"".  There were no prices printed on our mini-menus, and while the $40 steak was correctly priced on the one menu our table had to share, it was still a bit of a shock.  I was personally surprised that an adequate steak was priced so high...I know of a couple steak places where that much money would go much further flavor-wise.

Our meat and cheese appetizer plate had obviously been prepared hours ahead of time. The sweet breads and mushroom appetizer was over cooked and I believe they used the same breading on the outside as a Tyson chicken nugget. My husbands steak was salty but cooked alright. The nearly saving grace for me was that my macaroni and cheese was very good, though nothing really special.

The atmosphere is nice, thought a bit more dull than I was expecting. I was very excited to see that they served Lindemans Framboise beer. I had had it once before in NYC, for $14 for a bottle. It was expensive, but it was delicious and the bottle filled my glass twice, so I thought it was worth it. When I saw it one the menu here for $10, I ordered it immediately. But this time, no bottle! Just one glass! I had the baked brie for an appetizer. It was fine, but my friend's beer-cheese beignets were amazing! The service was fine, nothing to complain about.  Now the negative: For my main course, I ordered ""The Famous Shrimp Bag."" I like to think when a restaurant modifies any item with the words ""the famous"" it means that they do a really good job with it. Apparently, I'm wrong. They could've called it ""The Famous Salt Bag"" to make it far more appropriate. (I'm sure you can come up with other nouns to fill in there.) The pastry bag was filled with a mix of rice, herbs, shrimp, and mushrooms with no discernible flavor, other than salt, a flavor that was echoed by the lobster sauce that surrounded the bag. I appreciated my sweet beer all the more, as it was perfect for washing the taste of the food out of my mouth.

Now on to the food: restaurant week is kind of a mixed-blessing.  While it helps bring in the general public to places that may be a little more expensive, it also allows said public to make generalizations about the restaurant based on the limited selections.  Brasserie Jo might have suffered from this (see fellow diner, Karen T.'s review).  I, however, was completely pleased and sated by our meal.  Yes, the appetizer choices were a little plain (I had the smoked salmon, which was good), but I LOVED my chicken potpie in a bag!  It made for a great presentation, and left me feeling very full.  And I'd rather be too stuffed from my main course than complaining that there wasn't enough.   By the time dessert came around, I wasn't sure I could make it.  But I found room, and boy am I glad I did!  When we were first seated, our server informed us that while there were 2 options for dessert, the restaurant was out of the bread pudding, but they were making more and it may or may not have been ready by the time our table got to dessert.  Well, turns out the bread pudding was ready, but our server decided that we could get pick whichever dessert we wanted from their menu and not additional cost! There were 5 of us and we all had something different.  But if you're looking for a flashy dessert that tastes good, I would recommend the following 2 choices: the chocolate mousse and the profiteroles.  The mousse is really good, but the way they present it makes you feel extra special: they bring out this tub of chocolate mousse, and serve you 2 big scoops right at your table.  This is then followed by your server pouring chocolate on your dish from a kettle full of chocolate syrup.  Deeelish!  I would suggest ordering the profiteroles with someone else because there is sooo much on the plate!  It's a great dessert for 2, or 1 if you're up for the challenge! All in all, each person spent $50 for a 3-course meal and bottle of wine.  Definitely worth the price, and a revisit.",0.9975,0.786,0.177,0.036,0.4828960473078122

For all the restaurants at that corner: Sullivan's, Hub 51, Rockit, Keefer's and Vermilion, it's pretty much in the same caliber. Yet for all its Frenchness, it's just lacking that je nais se quoi. Frankly, I was a little disappointed in our appetizers. A chicken liver mousse and pate was way too heavy on salt and too light on quality: my stomach was a little queasy afterwards. A smoked salmon, horseradish and capers dish was fairly redeeming and well-seasoned, but that's a classic that's hard to ruin.  Entrees also fell flat on our palates. Friends tried a chicken pot pie, its strength in presentation more so than flavor. I had a sole and red rice dish I wasn't really feeling - I ended up leaving a third of it on the plate. I love French flavors and influence, but as my friend said, there was something about it that tasted like a diner.  What Brasserie Jo lacked in its savory dishes though, it made up for with their desserts. Good holy Jesus, their mousse and profiteroles are huge. I'm a quality over quantity kind of girl though, and will say that their puffs were a little tough. Again, I left a ton of my food on my plate, which is a huge deal. As the AGD (Asian Garbage Disposal), I usually clean my plate - and everyone else's around me. Service here is fantastic.

I ordered the spinach salad on the daily specials menu which I was really happy with. Now to the bad part, I ordered the steak frites and I was sadly disappointed. The only good thing about the entree was the size. Half the plate was covered with fries - which actually tasted like Burger King fries. I don't know what kind of steak it was but it was extremely fatty. I think I had 4 good bite size pieces out of the entire steak. The steak I got from Jewel for $5 was better than this!

If the service had been half as good as the majority of the food and our surroundings, it would've gotten four stars...I feel bad that the bussers' incomes depend on the tips of their servers, but then again my group had just the right amount of people to have automatic gratuity slapped on us. Go figure. The food for all other intensive purposes was pretty good. I had a sole fish with some great whole grain rice/quinoa and my friends raved about an alsacean style pizza and the french onion soup. Apparently our server was not interested in chatting up with us, a good looking group of twenty-somethings (yea they proabably aren't successful either since they are coming to a nice place during restaurant week; they've also probably never waited tables either). Maybe we aren't the demographic he likes to wait on. Although he did find plenty of time to talk to the only two other tables he was dealing with at the time (total=4 other people).  And the waiter obviously couldn't be bothered by all of our silly questions about the menu like what is bouillabaisse...I mean I can't even pronounce that. It's not like we were asking you whether the onion in the pate was cut minced or chopped. It's French cuisine for crying out loud! You should know by now that we aren't in France, and you will probably have to entertain questions regarding several entrees, mainly because their list of ingredients are not easily pronounced or common knowledge. And I'm done with servers who harp on how difficult it is split checks. Suck it up. I am a server too and splitting checks in the easiest thing to do if all portions are paid with a credit card. If we had each given you a $50 bill and demanded change back, then you reserve the right to be angry. We can write down how much we want on each card and you're done...leave the snarl at home next time. Great atmosphere. one star. Good Food. one star. Shitty service trumps the intial cordial efforts of the extraneous staff members/hostesses/bussers.  This place was not successful in acquiring my new business. The next time I want to go somewhere nice for dinner and drop a pretty penny, I'll make sure it's somewhere that an automatic gratuity for a server is at least midly justified.

Sadly, it was not to be.  I had the roasted duck breast and duck confit and my wife had the lobster bouillabasse.  The duck was really a shotgun approach to meat preparation, with two parts - lukewarm duck confit, still red/purple in the middle on one side, and on the other, hot roasted duck breast with the skin cooked to the point it could not be eaten.  Maybe they thought it would average out to a properly-cooked, warm meal? The lobster in the bouillabasse didn't have much meat on it, and the whole dish was kind of bland.  The gateaux briton dessert was good though.  And I also appreciated being able to have duck with a Kwak.",0.959,0.848,0.136,0.017,0.5411666666666667

2008-12-06,3.0,"I decided on Brasserie Jo as the restaurant to hold the celebration for my college graduation.  Now, I have to say that I am a very picky diner when it comes to French food: I spent an entire year eating at French restaurants in France and I'm obsessed with all things French (I'm a French teacher).  I'm not sure if these are good or bad things - I just know that I'm very, very picky when it comes to the food because I've had real, authentic, delicious and amazing French food.   I just don't think Brasserie Jo lived up to all of the hype.  When we arrived, the staff were very friendly and they were prepared to seat us for our reservation early.  We decided to get wine at the bar and wait for the rest of our party.  The layout of the space is nice - there's a lot of French accessories everywhere to let you know that you're in a French restaurant.  They had a lovely display of Beaujolais Nouveau, a lot of French sinage (salon privé, les toilettes, rue Hubbard, etc).  Everything was very nice, clean and somewhat modern.  The space looked like an old banquet hall filled with more modern furniture.   I had a few glasses of the Beaujolais nouveau, which was tasty and not chilled (thank God).  I was kind of surprised that no one in the restaurant actually spoke French, but I'm not really sure why this surprised me.  The bartenders all seemed very knowledgeable about the wine and spirits because I heard other customers asking about wine/dinner pairings and such.   Once we began the meal, our server brought out some fresh baguette, butter and some carottes gratées.  It was a really nice beginning for the meal.  My mom ordered the chicken liver mousse - delicious.  I highly recommend.  It came with some crusty bread and country paté.  I had the Onion soup, which was also great.  The crusty, baked cheese on top was yummy.  My uncle had the Wild Mushroom soup which he thought was just OK- he said it didn't have enough spice to balance the strong mushroom flavor.   For dinner, my mom ordered the Duck and said it was excellent.  There were several slices of duck breast and duck leg confit, which essentially means it has been cooked in its own fat.  She said it was very tasty and cooked well.  My uncle had the Beef Bourguignon that he didn't like very much.  He said that the cut of beef was kind of tough and it didn't seem to fit with the sauce on the rest of the dish.  My boyfriend had the Grilled Lemon chicken and said it was very excellent.  I ordered the Steak au poivre and it was not so great.  This is a lot of the reason why I'm giving three stars instead of four or five.  I asked for my meat to be cooked ""medium"" and it was grossly rare when it arrived.  I figured I wouldn't mind, but the meat was gross and tough.  I could barely cut it with a steak knife - that's a problem.  I had to ask for it to be returned and cooked more.  A bad piece of meat will be more tolerable if cooked to medium or medium-well.  That's just sad.  It also came with a side of vegetables and ""pommes galette"" which essentially is a potato pancake.  I'm pretty sure the ""pommes galette"" was one of those frozen hash brown patties that Denny's serves for breakfast.  It was not good.  I was so disappointed with the way my entrée turned out.  I expected the food to be better quality and it just wasn't.  Then I realized that the dishes were ""classic"" French dishes, but they were cooked pretty poorly.  Pommes galette exist in France, but it's really hard to find them outside of the freezer section in a grocery store.  I guess I thought the food would be better and more authentic and it just wasn't.  I know we're in Chicago, but Le Bouchon and other similar restaurants serve better, more authentic French food. For dessert, my mom ordered a cheese plate, I had a Beaujolais Nouveau fruit tarte and my boyfriend had the mousse au chocolat.  All of the desserts were amazing.  The cheese was room temperature and aged to perfection.  The mousse was fresh made and super fluffy and good and the Beaujolais tarte was juicy and excellent.  Everything was good, but the entrée really made me knock down my rating.  The restaurant was also pretty expensive for not-so-fantastic food.  There are better French restaurants in the city that serve quality food for a lower price.  I think the Lettuce Entertain you mark substantially raises the prices without really upping the quality.  I don't think I'll be going back to this restaurant in the future.",0.9986,0.774,0.168,0.058,0.5250353535353535

My dining partner and I enjoyed two rounds of drinks, two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts for about $75 each including tip.   She opened with a glass of white and the classic tarte flambee, while I  had a Kwak Belgian beer and a hearty French onion soup, all of which was perfectly satisfactory and generously sized. (If you've never  had a Kwak, try it--rich, malty, a little bitter, a little herbal, and all drama in its signature beaker). We both opted for medium rare steak frites--one with mustard butter, one with roquefort butter--and both were cooked absolutely perfectly. The kitchen has its beef down. And the frites were very good, crisp and delicious. Somewhere in there, I decided the fruity Unibroue Quelque Chose would be a grand idea, but I was unsure it would pair well with my steak and roquefort. Our (wonderful, attentive, friendly) waitress took the question absolutely seriously and consulted the sommelier who gave the pairing her stamp of approval. It was quite a nice combo--the fruit and cheese didn't fight at all--AND my beer-averse compatriot shared the mega-bottle with me, preferring it to her April in Paris cocktail (champagne, fruit juice and vodka, maybe? I thought it was good, and tart, but I used to literally suck lemons as a kid, so my opinions count for naught). We rounded out the meal with the profiteroles and the Pear Helena Coupe--a sundae glass full of chocolate mousse, bartlett pear, vanilla ice cream and whip, topped with toasted, slivered almonds.  As far as I'm concerned, Brasserie Jo is great. It's formal enough, with its chicly attired hosts, white linens and waitrons in vests and shirtsleeves, to take respected colleagues, a date or the folks, but it's also casual enough that you can breeze in with friends wearing your casual Friday best and settle in for a few hours for a bit of gab and grub. I'll happily return when the urge for steak hits but I don't want to go out of my way or spend a small fortune. (Perhaps next time I'll be a bit more investigative in my selection. They do feature French favorites like cassoulet, bouillabaisse, escargot, country pate and hearty roasts, but sometimes a girl just wants a hunk of meat and a beer, you know?)",0.9987,0.752,0.223,0.026,0.549637188208617

I'll make sure to order a bowl for myself next time!     But dessert was the highlight of the night - we had the bartlett pear coupe, which is basically chocolate mousse, pear slices, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, all stacked in a tall glass.  We regretted sharing, and should have had one each!

2008-03-31,5.0,"A favorite go to when I'm feeling a little French.  I've had many great meals here over the years and have yet to have a bad experience.  The room is really pretty without being kitschy French or pretentious.  The food itself is very humble and elegantly prepared-simple quality ingredients with thoughtful prepation.  Dine here often with a Chef who admires Chef Joho's light hand, if not his personality.  Always treated really well, with reservation, without reservation and service, though sometimes a little uniformed, has never been bad.  As a matter of fact one of my recently added favorite drinks came out of a waitress mistake here.  I ordered an Amaretto up (meaning in a snifter) with coffee after dinner and I heard the ""shake,shake, shake"" of the martini shaker and we were the last table in there......low and behold she had it served in a chilled martini glass.  Shaken to perfection so there were slivers of ice in it.  OH MY GOD, it was so yummy.  I looked at my date with a quizzical look and said , why not.  Tried it.  Then he ordered one.  Then we ordered two more.  And now its our after dinner drink of choice, voila! The onion tart and french onion soup are tres bien!  The soup reminds me of the Pied a Couchon in Paris where legend has it French Onion Soup originated, but I digress.  It is so flavorful with a delicate balance of cheese and a hearty crouton to soften the blow.  I always burn my mouth because I cannot wait to taste it and feel it warming my soul.  Entrees vary enough that I am not in my same-thing-every-time rut here and really do enjoy the roasted half chicken while the date always enjoys the frog legs and such.....I've devoured the steak au poivre on many occaisions and watched a grown man almost sob over a rabbit that was braised to perfection. Great wine list with some of my favorites, including the Trimbach Riesling and The Laurent.  Sancere and of course some bubbles.  The room is pretty and even though I am next to an adult book store, I always feel like I've escaped to the Marais, if only for  a moment when I enter the doors and see that high ceiling and beautiful bar.  I highly recommend BJ (as I call it with a snicker) for a great date place, girls night out or taking the parents for some reliable french.  And save room for dessert because the chocolate mousse is really the pinnacle.  I'm sure the busboy is tired of me asking him to leave the pot and take the plate for everyone else, but it really is great and so is the creme brulee.",0.9974,0.785,0.183,0.032,0.5465608465608465

After a hop, skip and a jump we finally made it to Brasserie Jo. Our waiter, Craig informed us of this amazing-sounding dessert that involved butter, sugar, brittle, and caramel ice cream. My friend and I decided to do both that, as well as the profiteroles.  GREATEST DECISION EVER! The profiteroles were perfect and tasty, and the butter cake was OUT OF THIS WORLD!

TOTALS!  It's pricey.  Our bill came out to $269 with tax and gratuity included.  It was split by seven of us, and my meal without the extra added on was ribs, Creme Brulee, and coffee was about $50 =)   but it was a wonderful night with wonderful people, well worth it!",0.9992,0.747,0.239,0.014,0.6137121212121213

Holy poo. So good. While it may not be the best sauce I've eaten in my life, it definitely enhanced a steak which -- plain -- I considered perfect.   The other member of my party had the 10 oz.

Our large group arrived separately and had to wait until all were present to be seated which always really irritates the hell out of me.  Also when we were finally able to be seated, the manager explained to me that the party who was at our table had been there for over three hours drinking heavily and were not planning to leave.  I was initially very irritated, but the manager handled it very well and set us up in the private salon.  He was also responsive to the fact that we had to be somewhere after the meal.  I got the French onion soup as the starter which was very good, and jealousy inducing.  Never a bad thing.  Marche is still number one (tied with the one I make at home but let's not get too boasty here)  I also enjoyed the $5 house beer Hop La.  Other starters enjoyed were the soup of the day (celery) and oysters.  As for our entrees, the steak frites was a great choice, cooked perfectly and very tender.  I ignored the frites a little but they were good.  Other choices were the salmon special, coq au vin (very bacony, mmmm bacon), duck breast, and lemon sole which were enjoyed by all.  My companion cleaned his plate of every salmon particle.  When our waitress found out we were celebrating my belated b-day, she had a tiny complimentary chocolate pot de creme with a candle brought out.  It was quite delicious, though certainly didn't stop me from ordering a dessert off the menu as well.  Piggy Piggy.  I tried the banana caramel coupe which consisted of warm bananas, caramel sauce, pralines, and ice cream.  It was good, but a bit too sweet for me.  I also tasted the creme brulee which was very light, and the chocolate mousse with tableside plating.  It seriously looks like they're going to serve you a massive soup tureen of mousse, but really they plate two scoops of it, pour a creme anglaise (I believe)  around it, and top with chocolate shavings.  Delish.  Our waitress was friendly, the manager was very helpful and I really enjoyed the food.  Also for a special occasion, I feel that the food is fairly priced.  Definitely go with the valet, as the nearest parking lot is significantly more expensive.  I would definitely come back, maybe with my tartare loving bff and share that as a starter.... my meat lover mouth is watering.............",0.9989,0.714,0.248,0.038,0.5214652014652015

2007-12-02,3.0,"My company hosted their annual holiday party here. Brasserie Jo has this whole ""everyday French"" thing going on. I've been to France, and it is not that pretty every day. I'm not sure how much of it was decorated for our party, or if it's always like that, but the restaurant is beautiful inside. Yeah, maybe I watch too much HGTV, but I really liked their choice of napkins and table runners. It's huge, and our group of 300+ had plenty of space in the dining room. The bar area got a bit cluttered during the cocktail hour, so I'd recommend going elsewhere if your group is large and not inclined to staying seated. The staff at Brasserie Jo is super-attentive, but not in an obnoxious way. These people have mastered the art of placing things on the table (or taking them away) without interrupting the flow of conversation. They also run one of the most efficient coat-checks I've seen in my life. Minus points for a lack of professionalism, though - our party featured disposable cameras on each table so we could have a photo album later, and we noticed that some people on the staff hijacked a few of the cameras and took pictures of themselves hanging out in the kitchen. And...the food! The hors d'oeuvres at the cocktail hour (ahi tuna on little crackers, pate, ham and rice puffs) were delicious but not too heavy, and there were plenty of servers walking around with trays. I can't remember exactly what our first course was, but it involved salmon and horseradish. I actually don't enjoy either salmon or horseradish, but I'll try at least a bite of anything. Not as bad as I expected! The Belgian endive salad is crisp and refreshing. There are bits of apples tossed in, and it's perfectly balanced between sweet and tart. Our main entree was a surf n' turf, which I can't find on their regular menu (on the website) but might be part of the catering menu. It was delicious but filling, and I didn't have much room for the profiteroles when dessert came by. I'm sure I missed out by only eating the ice cream and leaving the pastry behind.

I thought y'all might like an insider's perspective. :) Albeit the slight German influence you'll notice due to the food being Alsatian, Brasserie Jo's cuisine is French through and through.  This means a lot of butter and a lot of meat stock.  if you are a vegan, good luck.  Some of the entrees are a little heavy so don't stuff yourself on appetizers.  Remember you also have to save room for dessert. Whenever I dined there I would either get a salad as my first course (and skip the appetizers) or sit at the bar and order nothing but appetizers paired with an assortment of beers or wines.   Most of the food is quite amazing, and the servers have had the opportunity to sample everything on the menu so don't be afraid to seek their opinions.  There is always a menu of specials and often there are incredible dishes on that menu as well, so be sure to ask which ones are not to be missed. Please note that the food I'm advising to ""skip"" below is not BAD, it's just not as good as the rest of the menu. APPETIZERS Order the following with abandon: chicken liver mousse / country pate mussels escargot baked brie charcuterie duck rillette classic flambee Skip: shrimp cocktail a la francaise ENTREES Order with abandon: mussels skate duck lamb (do not order medium well or well*) any steak dish (do not order medium well or well*) coq au vin (please note this is all dark meat) beef tongue (if you already know you like beef tongue) bouillabaise (offered on Fridays only) Moroccan cous cous (offered on Wednesdays only) veal weiner schnitzel (offered on Tuesdays only) choucroute steak tartare (if you already know you like raw beef)  avoid like VD: shrimp bag Okay people, can I just say that the shrimp bag is a glorified pot pie?  It's shrimp and vegetables wrapped in phyllo dough and baked in the oven.  Did you really go to one of the best French restaurants in the city to order baked shrimp?  I didn't think so.  The waiters hate having to describe it, the cooks hate having to prepare it, and the bussers hate having to pick up all the thousands of phyllo flakes that come shooting out of the thing as soon as you stick your knife into it.  If the vegetable bag or the chicken bag come back onto the menu for some god awful reason, don't order those either. DESSERT You cannot go wrong with dessert, unless you decide not to get any.  If you are a chocolate fan you should not pass up the profiteroles or the chocolate mousse.  If you want something little, order some ice cream or sorbet (it's all made in-house).  If you don't have a sweet tooth, get the cheese plate.  There is usually a fruit plate offered as well, even if it's not written on the menu. ALCOHOL Brasserie roughly translates into ""brewery,"" and Brasserie Jo is justifiably proud of its 18 beers on tap and its dozen+ wines by the glass.  Some of the best wines are only offered by the bottle, so ask your server or bartender for advice.  The bar is also stocked with an incredible selection of cognac, armagnac, calvados, eau de vie (similar to grappa), and French liqueurs such as Pernod, Ricard, and chartreuse.   * A WORD ON MEAT TEMPERATURES Many of you will go ahead and order red meat well done or medium well with the apologetic disclaimer ""I'm sorry, I know the chef's going to hate me, but..."" You seem to understand that you're not supposed to request that your meat be cooked this much, but you don't seem to understand why. It's not because the chef's going to hate you.  It's because YOU ARE RUINING THE FLAVOR OF THE MEAT.  It would be like requesting a sandwich with bread that has been burned completely black in the toaster.  Yes, burnt toast is edible. But have you ever noticed how burnt toast TASTES?  Would you say that this flavor how bread is SUPPOSED to taste?  No? Then stop ordering your meat well done.  And before you try to tell me that meat cooked medium rare ""isn't safe,"" ponder for a second how many restaurants all across the country would be out of business if they intentionally served unsafe meat to millions of customers on a daily basis.   THE RESTAURANT WOULD NOT BE SERVING IT IF IT WERE NOT SAFE.  Not necessarily because the restaurant is a benevolent entity, but because it would be shut down by the health department.",0.9971,0.793,0.144,0.062,0.5711267127933792

2007-07-18,3.0,"I rarely see skate fish on a menu, so when I saw it in the yelp reviews of Brassierie Jo, I made reservations to celebrate his birthday here.  We had reservations at 7:45p, and there was at least one couple still waiting for a table by the time we left.    He liked the warm french bread, but I was focused on the carrot sticks with the horseradish dressing.  The escargot was good.  It's hard to go wrong with fresh herbs and melted butter unless you don't like a chewy texture.  The belgian endive salad was very good.  Variations on this salad have become mainstream, so I like that they showcased the endive by adding some sour green apple and using a sour/salty dressing instead of a sweet dressing or candied nuts. I was a little disappointed with the skate.  It was a little heavy on the capers (some bites were incredibly salty), and they could ease up on the butter in the puree potatoes, since the caper sauce is also butter.  The skate itself was cooked well.  He had the beef medallions with bordelaise sauce, and he said he enjoyed it more than any steak place.  With the sauce, it was some of the best beef  I've tasted.  They got ""medium rare"" right, but the haricot verts could have been a little crisper. Everything good I read about the profiteroles is not an exaggeration!  They pour about a cup of warm dark chocolate sauce over two scoops of vanilla bean in light pastry.  In one bite of my ice cream, there was a tiny piece of broken plastic (like a piece of plastic cutlery), and maybe I should have complained, but it didn't even ruin the dessert for me.  I would have licked the chocolate off the plate if I were at home. Besides the plastic in the dessert, a big negative was the temperature of the room.  Strangely, they had difficulty regulating the place to a comfortable temperature.  It was chilly when we were seated.  After the salad, it got too warm.  The thermostat was opposite my chair, and I saw them adjust it 3 times in the 2 hours we were there.

Finally, it was time for dessert.  One of the girls at our table took the responsibility of ordering for the table, which meant we got almost 1 of each dessert on the menu.  And it was all tremendously good.  Ice cream pastry with chocolate sauce - SO good.  Creme brulee - so good (and I usually don't like creme brulee).  Chocolate mousse - very rich and very fluffy.   Overall, we had a great time at dinner and everyone seemed pretty happy with their food, especially the dessert.  The servers were also very helpful in helping us select wine and beer depending on what kind of taste we were looking for.",0.9965,0.801,0.187,0.012,0.5834623015873015

Anyways, the food was also quite memorable.  We started with an order of Escargot and Mussels.  My stepdad knows what I love and I eagerly chomped those little snails and sopped up the pest butter with a piece of crusty baguette.  The mussels were better than average and once again the Riesling reduction made a great broth.  I ordered the sauted skate because like Bread Pudding if I see it on a menu I absolutely have to order it.  It was decent but did not nearly touch the skate I have had at either Balthazar in NY or The Kitchen in Boulder.  I switched my mashed potatoes for my sister's shoestring fries (I have found a kid who doesn't like fries).  Post meal we ordered coffee and two desserts.  One was a chocolate mousse on top of carmelized hazelnuts and the other was an apple gallette (very much like a tarte tatin).  Both were excellent and the coffee was great.  I also almost forgot about the wine.  I started with a Gewurztraminer and paired my skate with a surprisingly light Oregon Pinot Noir.  They were very nice, but my stepdad's Cabernet was exceptional.  Will definitely be back, preferably for appetizers and dessert and maybe an occasional steak frites.",0.9943,0.82,0.175,0.005,0.5349122807017543

Since I came with my graduation entourage of seven (for a total party of eight), and since almost all of us ordered different things, I got to try some of a LOT of their menu, and man oh man, their food was wonderful!  First off, the hot-off-the-press French baguette was deeeelicious. As for the entrees, I was very pleasantly surprised with the size and presentation and the excellent taste and quality of the food. Although all of them were really quite delicious, the standouts in my eyes (or perhaps in my taste buds' opinions?) were the roasted duck breast and the sauteed skate wing. Having a HUGE sweet tooth, I was also very excited that everyone ordered different desserts. Standouts: the floating island was light and firmly-but-frothily delicious, and the chocolate mousse was served out of a huge vat and then drizzled with sauce and chocolate shavings. The prices really aren't that high when one considers the scrum-diddly-umptious product that one receives.  Now that I've raved about the food, here's the miscellany. The setting was really perfect for the occasion: classy and upscale, but not at all the ""okay, now we must stop talking because we have entered a hallowed eating establishment"" stuffy attitude that can accompany some of the nicer restaurants out there. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained (nothing to write home about, but entirely acceptable for the establishment). The waiter was very friendly (and pretty cute!).

The exterior has a French flag and a Parisian-style street sign above the sidewalk seating. The bar area has the look and feel of a Manet painting. Every table is served a fresh baguette. I enjoyed coq au vin beautifully presented in a bowl. For dessert you should go with the profiteroles, with the gallant touch of the server pouring delicious chocolate sauce over the scrumptious pile until you say when.",0.9833,0.755,0.245,0.0,0.5222222222222223
