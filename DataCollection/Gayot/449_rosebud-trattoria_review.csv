2013-01-15,4.0,"We started with a baked clams appetizer and I could have easily eaten a second round. The lemon, butter, and white wine all came together very well and the clams were a nice size, these weren't cheap clams. The chopped salad (minus the beets) was tasted very light with the fresh veggies and vinaigrette. If anything, a little parmesan or feta cheese would have made this salad amazing. For entrees, I ordered the Grandma's gravy, which is farfalle with braised short ribs and pork with some San Marzano tomatoes and just a hint of whipped ricotta. I'm not even a fan of ricotta but it added just a little creaminess to the sauce, which I enjoyed. And the meat just fell apart, it tasted so tender. The pasta came out Al dente, I would definitely order this again. One issue. The waiter asked if I wanted grated cheese and he basically dropped on a half cup of cheese immediately. I didn't need THAT much! The gf ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and since I'm a veteran of the Monday all you can eat special, I knew what was coming. Two huge baseball-sized meatballs with a ton of spaghetti. and she ate half of one. Glad I was able to take the leftovers home...they tasted amazing. For dessert, she got a scoop of chocolate gelato while I ordered the special, cannoli cake. This thing must have been a foot high! It was a slice of three layer cake with almonds on the outside. The cannoli cream tasted very sweet, almost too much for my taste. My big disappointment was there was no hint of a cannoli shell which could have added a whole extra dimension of flavor.  The service was very friendly, but slow, especially when we were waiting for our check. And when I ordered my glass of wine, I had to remind the waiter, since he forgot it for ten minutes. All in all, it was a very good experience, I would consider returning, but I can't say I'm dying to return.",0.9922,0.828,0.147,0.025,0.4797313797313797

2012-09-08,1.0,"I'm going to preface this by saying much of my bad review is based on this one-time circumstance, though I find my experience to be inexcusable. Rosebud is attached to a Hampton hotel which on this particular weekend between the Cubs game and the NIU/Iowa game at Soldier Field, had to be pretty much booked. You would think the restaurant would staff themselves accordingly, but in this case that was too much to ask. I had family in town who was staying in said hotel. We had made a reservation earlier that day for a big group of us for 7pm, but the restaurant had plenty of notice. We stopped in to the restaurant before we went upstairs to freshen up to check on their reservation, and they told us that they were actually moving our reservation back a half hour. 7:30 it is. We came downstairs just a few minutes early, and since the restaurant didn't really have a waiting area, the hostess told us to wait in the hotel lobby and she would get us once our table was ready. At 8:00 (an hour after our original reservation), we were finally seated and promptly forgotten with a shortage of utensil placements, water glasses, and no menus. We waited for another 15-20 minutes before our waiter turned up and asked if we were ready to order. Seeing as we were not given menus, no we most certainly were not. At this point we were ravishing and it didn't take long for the group of us to decide what we wanted to eat. At 9:00 we were finally given the complimentary bread an hour after we were seated and after seeing other tables being seated and given their menus and bread before us. We were finally given our food just after 9:30, but it was delivered by one waiter who could clearly only bring out two plates at a time--the cardinal rule for serving: make sure everyone gets their food at relatively the same time, this means getting other waiters to help you if you can't handle it all yourself. Since the restaurant was horrendously overstaffed, this was obviously not the case so we waited to eat until all of us had our food (as hungry as we were at this point, that was no easy feat). The food itself? I mean, it's pretty difficult to mess up Italian food. I got the fettuccine which was good, but unimpressive. I think the only reason our table enjoyed our food so much is because we had waited two and a half hours to get it. Additionally, it was overpriced.",0.9538,0.837,0.098,0.066,0.48870893318567743
2012-09-02,2.0,"Before I dive in to the details of my experience at Rosebud, I should probably detail the extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to this becoming a less than ideal dining experience.  We had some family in town for a college football game at Soldier Field who were staying at the Hampton Inn & Suites connected to this restaurant.  For the sake of convenience, a group of 18 of us ranging from ages 15 up into their 50s decided to eat here.  Apparently a number of other out of town fans decided something similar.  It was also apparent that the restaurant staff was not anticipating these types of crowds. The morning of our reservation, a member of our group made a reservation for 18 at 7:30.  It's a huge group, no doubt, but they did have a fair warning.  When we returned after the big game, we were informed that our table wouldn't actually be ready until 8:00.  We sat in the hotel lobby and were finally seated at 8:15.  I can't say I've ever heard of a group with a reservation being seated 45 minutes late. Due to some sort of confusion, half of the people in our group were not given silverware and none of us were given menus.  My assumption was that someone was on top of bringing those out, but when our server finally did get to our table he asked if we needed any more time to look at the menus.  Whoops.  Yes we did.  Could we have some please? Around 9:00 we received baskets of bread with olive oil and cheese.  That's great, unfortunately what should be the appetizer to the appetizer was arriving an hour and a half into our dinner reservation.  During that entire time, someone came around only once to refill water, which again leads me to believe they were horrendously understaffed. And then the food arrived, which was actually really great.  Maybe it's just that I hadn't eaten a true meal in over ten hours (I probably would have eaten Chef Boyardee and loved it), but I swear it as the best Sausage Spaghetti I've had in a year.  That fact alone brought this review up from one star. Were there extenuating circumstances at play that contributed to this experience?  Yes.  Were they beyond the restaurant staff's control?  I don't think so.  Simply being adequately staffed in my view would have resolved just about every problem we experienced.",0.9709,0.821,0.112,0.067,0.5565295815295815

The server was very attentive, professional, and friendly.  I ordered the special, a salmon fillet on a bed of linguini with lemon butter sauce.  It was quite good, but not the best and the portion size was GIGANTIC.  I could finish about two thirds of it.  My family members loved their dishes but also found they couldn't quite finish the whole thing comfortably.   I ordered one scoop of lemon sorbetti for desert, which was divine - perfect portion, texture and flavor.  My aunt ordered a carrot cake, my uncle the tiramisu, and my mother ordered the cheese cake, all were delicious but HUGE.  I mean, like Alice and Wonderland huge.  A desert here could easily satisfy 3 - 4 people in my opinion.   There were very few hiccups in our service, save for when the kitchen sent out the wrong desert for my mother.  It was quickly corrected and the server quickly apologized.  Over all it was an enjoyable night, I gave the restaurant 3 stars because I was not as impressed with the flavor of the food as I would have liked and the price reflects the portion sizes.  I think my salmon dish was somewhere around thirty dollars.

The first indicator of trouble should have been the phone call. From the get-go the guy was totally annoyed with me, and I wasn't sure why. First, he told me that they ""didn't have papardelle."" I said, ""are you sure? we recently ordered it at a different location."" After several minutes of confusion, he says ""oh yes, the noodle. obviously we have that."" Clearly that was what I had meant to order. The rest of the phone call continued in the same vein, I'd order an item and he'd act like I was a moron.  So, whatever - running a restaurant is mad stressful, I didn't take it personally though I was fairly confused. I have always gotten great service at all the Rosebud locations.  So, we show up, the foods running later than expected - this also does not bother me. THEN when it finally comes, two of three dishes were incorrect INCLUDING the parpardelle (which came as rigatoni, EVEN after our 5 minute discussion of the type of noodle it was) and a random pasta dish we hadn't ordered.  Honestly, I don't mind mistakes, even major ones. However, the place was DEAD. Not one table - so what was the issue? Second, I don't understand why I had to be treated like that on the phone when he wasn't even listening to what I was saying? Ugh. Such sadness.

After finding rockstar parking on the street right around the corner from Rosebud on Rush that night, my group showed up promptly at 7 pm. I told the hostess my name and she informed us that we did not have a reservation at that location. Upon further investigation she told us that the reservation had been made for Rosebud Trattoria on Dearborn and Illinois. I asked if she could still accommodate us because of the mistake that the hostess at the other location had made and she said no. Not exactly the customer service I was looking for, but alas, we got back in the car and drove to our next location in search of parking. After driving and circling for about 25 minutes,  we realized that street parking was not going to happen and we ended up valleting our car, showing up at the next location 45 minutes late for our original reservation.  Once we arrived at Trattoria, I spoke with the manager, Yvonne, who seated us at our table and explained our situation. Yvonne was wonderful! She was VERY accommodating and generous and compensated our bill for the trouble that we went through.

Really Appreciate it!!!        So I went back because I love the brasatto, and the gf loves the vodka sauce.      Last time: Our next server had no idea what anything was and constantly had to ask the manager about wine etc. as I was asking because they had taken my favorite pinot off the menu.  This gentlemen sadly was completely incompetent when it came to the food and the wine.  I felt like we knew more as customers, and that is very sad.      I will admit that last time was a month ago and the food was much better. I seriously do love this place and want to write a great review, but you just keep disappointing me.  As of now, we have been hunting around for a new Italian restaurant to serve as our go to. Suggestions are appreciated.    As for Rosebud, i'd love to give you 5 stars, seriously, but for some reason you chose to shoot yourself in the foot instead.  Good luck with those new servers. ~B",0.9902,0.71,0.186,0.104,0.447943722943723
2011-07-10,5.0,"RARELY do I give out 5-stars but this place deserves it! Last night my friend and I's dinner plans fell through and we ended up going here instead. We hadn't ever eaten here, despite living just down the street, so we were pretty excited to try something different. From the moment we walked in the service was excellent! From the friendly hostesses to Michael K our waiter, to everyone else, it was great! Right after we were seated we noticed a wobble in our table, no problem, our waiter fixed it himself with a smile! Warm bread with EVOO and Parm. Cheese was served first. We ordered steamed mussels and stuffed shells with Vodka Sauce.... WOW! They were both delectable! Wait times were short and our waiter was around frequently to check in on us. While we waited, a table of tourists were seated next to us and we watched as Michael patiently went over the menu with them and answered questions all while maintaining a great sense of humor and kindness. Dinner was fabulous so we elected to try the Carrot Cake..... I have to say I'm fairly certain this was the BEST carrot cake I've ever had! The piece was HUGE so 3 people could share it. We didn't finish it, though I had to douse it in SALT to keep myself from continuing to devour it.  In all, I'd go back in a heartbeat and I'm so glad it's a neighborhood joint! The ambiance is great (though it looks like a diner from the outside it's not like a diner once you're inside). The noise level is minimal, the service and food were stellar.

2011-06-20,2.0,"Went for dinner with some work colleagues based on some of the better reviews and the fact that we could walk from our hotel. First impression - an italian diner - the sign, the decor, the door - screamed diner however once inside the room had character and was almost charming. We were seated and greeted by our waiter who told us he would be assisted in attending to us by several people - two of whom he introduced. Throughout the meal we never saw these other folks and we saw our waiter intermittently so I would not make such a point of these introductions.  The menu was vast with the typical italian classics and some interesting additions. We chose calamari and burrata as appetizers and both were delicious although the menu said the calamari included fried artichokes and we found perhaps two leaves at most on the plate. Our entrees appeared all too soon - almost on top of the apps - and the pacing seemed off from the kitchen. The entrees were a mixed bag. The stuffed shells were solid and enjoyed, the 8-finger cavatelli however was swimming in oil and grease form the sausage and the portion was enormous. The shrimp francese - a recommendation from the waiter - was delicious although the chef was heavy handed with the sauce and it overwhelmed the spinach. Finally the brasato was also a huge portion and the meat was deemed dry. We did not order dessert due to the excessive portion sizes and general underwhelmed feeling left at the end of the meal.  Having dined at the original Rosebud years ago I was expecting a better experience. I think the trattoria could use a visit from that chef. The room and location are great - the kitchen needs some tweaking and the service is a little uneven.",0.9872,0.862,0.131,0.007,0.5385416666666666
2011-06-18,3.0,"Restaurant Review Lunch review only. I have shifted my business from Rosebud on Rush to this location given the recent discontinuation of the 5 dollar steakhouse burger. I was expecting the same experience, however this was a bit different and only earns a 3 star IMHO. The layout of the restaurant is a lot brighter than the location on Rush which is a plus, however the servers are not as friendly. When I ordered the burger special, the waitress was quick with her questions and ran off to place the order. Next thing I know, I have a ketchup and mustard container on my table. Within 4 minutes I get my burger. The speed is definately a plus, but I miss the bread and olive oil you get before your meal at Rush. I guess a burger diner doesn't deserve italian bread/olive oil. Now on to the burger. The pretzel roll was definately softer and fresher than Rosebud on Rush, however given the speed my burger was dripping in grease that saturated the lower half of my bun. Also, there is no sweet potato fry option here. As with the other location, you can add additional toppings for 1 dollar each (cheese, onions, etc.) All and all, I shouldn't complain because it still a bargain deal available M-Friday 11 AM-3pm, however servers could be nicer. I still end up tipping 2 dollars which is close to 40% tip on the meal... Pro- delicious and cheap steakhouse burger, quick service, bright dining room space Con- servers should be appreciative for lunch business in this economy, where is my bread? (patrons should tip on the prediscounted price fyi on the meal) Hidden deal- $5 dollar gourmet burger on pretzel roll.

We were starving, so Rosebud Trattoria was the best looking option nearby.  I'm so glad that Ben Pao was closed. I like them and all, but Rosebud was great. It was empty when we arrived at the odd time of 2:30 for lunch, but our server (really wish I remembered his name) was excellent. We trusted his recommendations and enjoyed a great lunch.  We had the bruschetta as an appetizer - it was good, not great.  We split the Sausage Panadina Pizza, Eight Finger Cavatelli, and Penne Bolognese. All three were excellent!  The sausage pizza was not a deep dish pizza, but I loved it. The flavors were perfect, good quality cheese, and the sauce was also very flavorful.  The Penne Bolognese was also delicious - again, you can tell they use good quality ingredients in their dishes.  The 8 Finger Cavatelli was AMAZING. Ourserver told us a little about this dish. The magical pasta making ladies use 8 fingers to roll these noodles, so they are thicker than a regular noodle. There are also a couple cheeses in the pasta dough, so it has an amazing taste. A nice light sauce and some added greens, and sausage make the whole thing my new favorite Italian dish.  I'm holing out on the 5th star only because it was tough to tell what the atmosphere is like there during a normal time. I think we may have been the only table in there at the time.

2011-05-19,2.0,"My trip to Rosebud Trattoria today was rather disappointing.  From my overcooked burger to the very tatty place mat set down before me, standards seem to have slipped a great deal from my first few visits.   Somehow, they guy serving me changed my order from rare to medium from the time that he took my order to the time that he entered it in his POS system mere feet away.  That was a letdown.  As he never asked me how my burger was, I never communicated to him that it was very overcooked compared to what I ordered.  I wouldn't have had time to have them recook it again anyway. The $5.00 burger special is likely helping to keep the restaurant afloat in these still challenging economic times, but it may be coming at a price.  Service standards are slipping, and they were already a bit lacking in the past.  It's a pity.  With a few small changes, this place could be a lot better.",0.6428,0.902,0.068,0.03,0.42968253968253967

If I was rating just the food, this place would be a 5 without a doubt.  The waiter really worked with us on food options and made some great suggestions.  They are damn proud of their eggplant and I have to hand it to  them.  Mind blowing.  So he actually convinced us to two different eggplant entrees.  One was the Parmesan and the other was actually the Pork Chops Calebrese which they actually did with eggplant just for us.  The 4 of us ordered a bunch of stuff and just shared. The Calebrese was AMAZING.  It's like the Parmesan, but without the marinara and cheese.  Which is awesome because the sauce and cheese usually make the breading soggy.  The Milanese breading was just perfect and the lemon-based sauce... outstanding.  This has to be the best Italian entree I've ever had. The Parmesan which everyone from the host to the waiter seemed to be most proud of was really good too.  As I mentioned before, the eggplants lost the crisp, but the eggplant was so juicy and almost creamy.  The eggplant was melt-in-your mouth good. My favorite is usually the penne vodka.  They didn't disappoint here.  It was really good.  Not the best ever, but good. Last of all, I also tasted some pizza, the Rustichella.  Even this was really flavorful.  Most of us were so busy chowing down the eggplants and pastas that we didn't really do justice on the pizza.  I tried some just because and it wasn't warm by that time.  I'm sure it would've been better when it came out piping hot. With all that raving about the food, now you can see why I feel bad not rating this place with 5 stars, but I have to stay true to my high standards.  So this was a Saturday night and the place was understandably crowded.  We waiting 30 minutes while sitting at the bar.  When we were seated, we could barely get to our table.  They definitely have the tables way too tightly packed for comfort.  I got bumped by patrons and staff multiple times while seated. The second problem was the service itself which was average at best.  There were long delays between his stops at the table.  A couple of times he forgot to bring us something we requested.  They even forgot to bring out appetizer plates for our table.  Numerous times he made excuses of other tables requiring too much attention or losing his mind.  idk... just not up to snuff. All in all, I'm definitely going back.  I hope the service problem was just one-time bad luck.  The table layout is definitely a problem.  Maybe I'll stick to going on a weekday night.  When it comes to Italian food, this Rosebud is definitely one of Chicago's finest.",0.9986,0.713,0.222,0.064,0.4378475643130816

I was enticed to this outpost of Rosebud by their $5 burger special, so this review is solely for that as I doubt I'd be back for any of their Italian menu items.  For $5, you get a big, juicy burger, on a pretzel bun, served with fries. Naturally toppings are extra and will run you $1 each. I added caramelized onions and cheddar cheese, so my $5 burger crept up to $7, but it's still a deal in my book.  The burger was a smidgen overcooked ( I ordered it medium rare and it was closer to medium) so I'll adjust accordingly on my next visit. The fries looked better than they tasted. They were nice and skinny, but only some of them were crispy and they weren't hot enough.  They certainly don't skimp on the size; I'm pretty sure this beauty was a 1/2 lb., and it was flavorful and juicy, and also comes with lettuce, tomato, and pickle. I'd probably skip the caramelized onions next time though; they just didn't add much excitement to the burger.  Service was quite friendly and I expected it to be the bare minimum as I imagine the servers would be annoyed serving throngs of people a $5 burger and thus making no money, but our guy was super pleasant. I guess my friend's two glasses of wine made the tab more palatable than it would have been, but he showed no such annoyance at our paltry food bill.

I asked my flight attendant what she was in the mood for, hoping she would say ""whatever"", and a successful wish at that.  The hotel or our company had arranged for a selection of restaurant discounts for us and Rosebuds Trattoria was one of those selections.  So before we went I looked it up on Yelp......""not too bad"" I thought and only 3 blocks from the hotel. Now I sorta showed up in the wrong mindset and should have researched it more.  I thought this was a one off restaurant but its a sudo upscale casual Chicago-Land chain. My flight attendant and I show up at about 8:30.  Still busy but the dinner rush was on its last hurrah.  We were quickly sat with no reservations and promptly ignored for the next 15 minutes.  A runner brought by 5 small slices of still warm and overly crusted italian bread on a plate wrapped in a napkin.  No butter or oil and seasoning or anything except our water. I mean really - 15 mins in at the local county lounge (jail) they serve you dry bread and water!  I look around and everyone else had a neatly placed bread BASKET and something accompanying their yeasty Italian finger food.  Before I get to slamming the server too much - I will say he seemed to be a nice and accommodating guy. Finally our waiter comes by and asks what we'd like to drink.  I asked about what wines they had and poof...just like that he's off again.  He came back in about 5 more minutes with the wine list and it only had whites on it.  After dropping the list off, like a iron skillet from the broiler, he's gone again for another 5 to 7 mins. Now I know...Dinner rush.....double sat.....but when you're hungry and your server only has a few tables.....really? When we got the wine all sorted - I ordered a glass of Ferrari-Carano's Siena from Sonoma, CA.  I'm not a big wine guy (craft beer is another story) but it was delicious and dry..mmmmm. 30 mins had passed before ordering.  My dinner companion ordered a pasta special of the night, which was my plan B, and I asked the waitron ""Is this the kind of place where I can tell you - to tell the chef - hit me with your best shot?"" Now I asked this because - with dinner rush still waining I didn't want to f*%k up the flow of the kitchen to the point of - who ever's preparing my dish would use the rubber floor mats as their mis en plas. The waiter told me you can do that at any one in the chain and then disappeared to put our order in.  ""The chain?"" I thought to myself. THE FOOD -  35 minuets later - it shows up.  At first glance it looked an smelled wonderful.  In the low light of the restaurant I thought it was some kind of squab or hen but then the waitron came back by and told me his manager had suggested the..... Brick Chicken (see pic). It was a beautifully center cut small whole chicken with a delicious oregano rosemary herbed white wine and butter reduction - roasted potatoes, long cut herbed and garlic broccoli florets and a grilled lemon half.  The herbs were so aromatic I thought I was walking through the farmers market.  It  smelled great.  The chicken had a perfectly caramelized crispy skin and the flesh was hot, juicy and wonderfully cooked. I was a little flummoxed - when opening the door to put ""your best shot""  in front of me they went with a chicken dish.

2010-08-16,4.0,"Really impressed with the food here. Im a very picky Italian customer and this place brings it every time. They start out by giving you excellent Italian bread...crusty and chewy in all the right spots. The bread is served with a dish of olive oil and parm for dipping. I  usually try to skip bread at restaurants but had 21/2 pieces of this. For an appetizer we got the mamma's meatballs which consists of two GIANT meatballs and a salad. It sounds like an odd combo but the dressing on the salad mixes with the meatballs and its super yummy. The sauce and meatballs taste similar to what my Sicilian grnadfather used to make, its that good. The portions here are huge and we were unfortunately pretty full after the meatballs, but had already orderd a pasta dish of cavatelli, sausage, broccolini, and garlic/oil. I t was good, but not great.....I could make it at home, but the pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavors worked well. We took the majority of it home becuse we could barely manage to shovel a tiny portion in. Next time its the meatballs and a side order of pasta. If youre in the mood for some authentic Italian food I would head over here pronto! It is a little pricey, but the portions are gigantic so you can save money by shairing or at least having leftovers for lunch the next day!",0.9923,0.797,0.18,0.023,0.49209523809523814

2009-07-04,4.0,"Last weekend Aaron S. and I ventured here to meet up with his Aunt, Uncle, and three cousins for dinner. We walked an extra block from the train station because we were looking for ""Balto."" as we were walking past I even asked Aaron ""Is that the place?"" because they have a huge neon light in the window stating that its an ""Italian eatery."" Aaron S. said ""No I'm sure they said Balto..."" After walking the extra block and realizing we would soon be near HOB if we kept heading that way he made a quick call to his Aunt and she said ""Oh wait I think it's called Rosebud now""  We arrived first and went inside and waited for them by the doors. We got to laugh at some women picking up the candies that they have in little dishes up front. They either didn't bother reading the label or didn't know what 'anise"" was before eating it. It was rather funny,  The inside made the place look like it was trying to give off some kind of night club vibe or something. They even had a disco ball looking light fixture in the middle of the main dinning area. I found that to be a little odd but eh its more about the food and service than anything else.  This was yet another dinning experience that left me unsure how to rate it. Our server was kinda an ass(more on that in a bit) but still pretty friendly, he also forgot a lot of things that Aaron's family had to ask for more than one time, and they really were not THAT busy. I was going to only give them three stars, but in the end I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Our group was seated in the middle of the room right off the kitchen, so we got to watch the huge plates of yummy looking food coming out. Which helped me a lot with conversation, I was nervous as hell meeting his family for the first time.  When our server made it to our table he said ""I am going to take the wine glasses away from those I assume are not having wine"" Now we all now the saying behind assuming things. He took my glass. This left me peeved. Really peeved. Now I KNOW I am young looking. I get it. I get comments about it all the time. If he would have taken a second look though he would have noticed that I was there with a man who is very clearly over 21. Come on, what under 21 year old would have such a fantastic looking beard? So in my opinion he could have taken a second to ask me. I was very tempted to make him look like the ass he was by asking for a drink, but did not because I was not prepared to bring out my mean side meeting Aaron's family the first time. So I stuck to diet coke.  Looking over the menu I was daunted. So many choices that I never heard of. I was stuck between three items, the ribeye steak with espresso crust, the priest stranglers, and the stuffed shells. I choose the simplest one in the end, the stuffed shells.  Aaron's family went with ""Mama's Meatballs"" for an appetizer. They had enough there for the five of them, and to offer Aaron and I a taste. it was a huge plate of salad with two ginormous meatballs on it and a big piece of sausage. The meatball I got a piece of was awesome. You could really taste that it had veal in it. Also super crusty warm sourdough tasting bread was brought out. So good. When Aaron's Aunt requested more, our server forgot it.  The room was loud, but not too loud were we couldn't all talk. They also had soap opera's on TV. What? The TVs really were pointless and out of place.  The main courses came out and I have to say my stuffed shells were fantastic. Not mushy. With ample vodka sauce and topped with crunchy browned motz cheese. YUM. I had enough sauce that i was able to finish it off with some of the leftover bread. It was seriously fantastic food. I also snagged a taste of Aaron's priest stranglers, also really yummy.  After a few minutes of letting dinner settle and chatting the server came back and asked if we would like any dessert. I went with the Godiva Chocolate Mouse cake and Aaron got the Canoli cake. Both were huge. Mine had some kind of raspberry sauce on the plate. Holy hell the cake was moist and super chocolaty, and the sauce went so well with it. We both had to pack up some of our desserts to bring home they were that huge.  In the end, I do hope Aaron S. and I can make it back, the food was that good. I am also glad his family picked this spot to meet.

2009-07-03,4.0,"Friendly service, delicious food and portions galore - who could ask for more in an Italian restaurant?  (Well, Billy Joel might request a bottle of red or a bottle of white, and their wine list wouldn't disappoint!) There was some mild confusion over meeting at this place, because my out-of-state relatives were given the name ""Ballo"" and while that is technically the name of this palce, it's owned by Rosebud, so it kind of has two names.  The big lit-up sign proclaims ROSEBUD, but the windowed permit displaying that they're allowed to have outdoor seating is written for Ballo.  Either way, we finally all met up and were led to a giant table. The bread they brought out was fabulous (as were the refills, though we had to ask twice) and the plates they also brought out with oodles of olive oil and piles of Parmesan were a lovely accompaniment.  My aunt had the wine while I convinced my uncle to try some Goose Island Honker's Ale.  My gal and I went with soda and my little cousins stuck with water (because soda's for grown-ups). The appetizer of Mama's Meatballs was enormous - as we were convinced it would be while we watched enormous plate after enormous plate being carried out of the kitchen.  It was a large salad complete with two ""softball-sized meatballs"" and a large sausage.  There was enough meat there for all 7 of us to get an ample taste - and they were delicious. Then for the main courses.  The littlest cousin went with the pepperoni pizza, and even for a picky eater, he managed to eat a good amount of it.  The middle cousin went the way of spaghetti and meatballs, and even though it was from the children's menu, the portion was more than I've seen off an adult menu at average diners.  the eldest cousin shared with his parents and had the pasta dish with braised beef and pork that had a different name on the menu but the website calls ""Grandma's Gravy"".  My girl had the stuffed shells, which were packed with cheese, and I went with the most interestingly-named dish I could find (which the server highly recommended when I ordered it) - the ""Priest Stranglers"", a slightly spicy dish with shrimp and lobster with asiago cream and lobster butter.  The website gives the proper name for this dish as Penne Diavola, but that's not as fun to order in a restaurant. And the dessert!  My god!  I have no idea why the website doesn't list these desserts, but they do not disappoint.  They're served on plates just as giant as the entrees, and they are all piled high and decadent!  There were two orders of the chocolate ganache cake (their signature dessert) and I went with the cannoli cake just because the thought of cannolis in a cake form was too interesting to pass up.  It was almost as tall as the plate was wide.  Let's just say that I wasn't ashamed to be packing up some leftovers from this meal - and that's coming from a fat man who can hold his own while eating! The ambiance could do with a little work, but it wasn't that bad.  My family has been warned before coming that the place was rather loud and they might not be able to have a conversation at the table because of it.  Even though we were seated RIGHT next to the kitchen and the plates clanking, we still were able to hear each other and have a good time.  The two giant TVs, though, are useless in this place.  They were both tuned to Soap Opera channels, were not able to be heard, and distracted from enjoying a nice big Italian meal with my family - which is what Italian restaurants should be focusing on.  All in all, it wasn't a big deal (mostly because you couldn't hear them, you just saw them out of the corners of your eye). The last thing I want to say about this place is one devious item that I watched fool several people.  While my girl and I were waiting for the rest of the party, I saw the little bowls by the hostess' area with toothpicks and business cards and after-dinner candies.  I picked one up and noticed the rectangular shape.  A closer look and I saw the word ""anise"" written on it.  My Food Network training led me to realise that it would be a licorice-flavored candy.  The exiting patrons, however, did not have such training or observation skills - leading to hilarious bouts of ""Ugh!  That's not mints!"" and ""Gross, licorice??"" that we got to watch while we waited. The servers here are very friendly, but it's up to you to decide if you'd sacrifice good service for friendly servers.  My soda was refilled without provocation, but the bread refill took a few requests.  The friendly waiter was helpful in selecting food choices, but decided my girlfriend (who is certainly over 21) didn't need her wine glass even before drinks were ordered.  Lastly (a huge pet peeve of mine) was the large delay in getting us our check and then in retrieving it so we could leave. But hey, friendly service, delicious food and portions galore - who could ask for more in an Italian restaurant? Not me!  (Perhaps a bottle of Rosé instead?)",0.9981,0.854,0.117,0.029,0.49553494124922715

My Chicken Parmesan was good and saucy but a bit garlic-y . Unlike the other Rosebud places I've been, it didn't come with a small side of pasta. I was too full from that to even care, but if you cared, you could probably order something on the side.

2009-06-20,4.0,"This place used to be called Ballo.  My husband and I have been here about 3 times or so.  The food is always delicious--particularly the burrata mozzarella appetizer and pizza.  Burrata cheese apparently is fresh mozzarella made with butter or something.  Chicken parm is good, too, but it's annoying because most of the meals seem to be served family style (or else the individual portions are really huge and a little pricey).   One thing to be wary of on crowded nights:  THIS PLACE CAN GET RIDICULOUSLY NOISY AND CROWDED.  On one weekend evening, I left with ringing in my ears, seriously.   Service varies, but usually it's pretty good.  I've also been to Rosebud on Rush and the Rosebud in Gold Coast.  I think this place has the best food.",0.8398,0.771,0.142,0.088,0.6344444444444445
2009-06-01,4.0,"Oh dear Lord!  No one warned us.  Why didn't they warn us? If you waited tables at a restaurant where any one of the regular entrees are large enough to feed a family of four in a third world nation for the better part of a week, wouldn't you say something?   That is really my only gripe with this place, that and the fact that it's a little close quarters inside.  The food was very good, our server was cool and outgoing.  The decor left a little to be desired but it wasn't bad by any means.  I appreciate their reluctance to take down their disco ball.  Buck the establishment!  *Side note* it was entertaining to watch the [I think he was the] manager guy try to hit on every table of females in the spot. But really, when unassuming patrons order an appetizer with the meal, you really should mention that the appetizer alone will just about sate the two diners in question. The calamari was satisfying but just when we were getting our fill on, out came our meals.  Holy crap!  Really?  What the hell am I supposed to do with that mountain of pasta with the soft ball size meat balls on the side? Here I should again note that everything we ordered, the tagliatelle, rigatoni alla vodka and the calamari were really good. We did what we could with the meals, knowing full well we'd pay the piper later that night.  It's a shame we were in a hotel without real means to heat up the leftovers.  I'm sure they would have still been good for breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day. Chalk it up to learning.  We will probably be back next time we have the good fortune to be in the town of Chi, but methinks we'll just split a meal then.",0.9659,0.792,0.137,0.072,0.4293312983312984
2009-04-04,3.0,"The food is absolutely amazing with oversized Italian portions. The service is ok -- our server was a little overbearing, but answered all the questions we had. Mostly tables in this place, but they are quite close together. There are 4 booths, but you've got to request them bc they go quick!",0.5328,0.915,0.085,0.0,0.48333333333333334
2008-11-23,4.0,"The food is only surpassed by the service.  When I visited this restaurant, we had reservations but still had a (very) short wait.  When we were seated, we were pleased with the table so we overlooked the wait.  Mussels and bruschetta to start before a fine Italian meal.  Veal Parm followed by a warm Grand Marnier and the evening was complete.  Rush is more flash, while Dearborn is more of a cozy feeling.  I recommend this location for out of the way dining.",0.9453,0.783,0.199,0.018,0.6036363636363636
2007-07-18,3.0,The experience recently was okay - the service was slow even though the place was not busy and it was 9pm on a Friday night.  The food was not bad but not memorable either. Wine selection was very limited. Vegetarian options were liberal. Pastas were overall better than the pizzas and appetizers were quote so-so.,0.5323,0.83,0.122,0.047,0.42248677248677247
