We started our evening, a gloomy and rainy Tuesday, at this location that he picked out. It was absolutely fabulous to the point of a 5-star review, even upon discovering that they are now closed (bring on the tears). We had hoped to come here for our ""engagement"" anniversary. Service and quality were excellent and authentic and I was so much looking forward to getting leftovers from the dish I ordered a year ago, when it was the only time ever that my now spouse suggested I don't get leftovers because we were going somewhere else afterwards (proposal spot!) I just thought I'd share this story. I wish the owners and operators of this establishment the best and would like to extend my thanks. I will never forget the best date night of my entire life over one of the best and most authentic italian dishes I've ever had.",0.9869,0.785,0.199,0.016,0.5017857142857143

I wanted to like it because the decor is really lovely but unfortunately I was terribly disappointed by their pasta.  Why in the world is it ok to just throw whatever you have in the kitchen in your pasta dish? That's what it left like...it was just too much stuff not well put together. One of the pasta dishes had giant pieces of sausage and peppers cut fajita style and put on average tomato sauce, it was hard to eat looked sloppy and the pasta was undercooked (I they have the meaning of ""al dente"" confused).  Our other pasta dish was swimming in cream sauce, very bland. The dishes reminded me of when I was a server, at the end of the night the cooks used to experiment with whatever was left over and ask us to try it. I overheard someone asking the server if the owner was Italian and he replied no that he was once married to an Italian...so I'll just leave it at that.",-0.6742,0.811,0.086,0.103,0.5219298245614036

Super nice and friendly.  The appetizers were good:  steak brushetta and calamari (it's grilled though, so if you're looking forward to fried ones, these are not it) The Bad: 1) I ordered the duck tortellini, but I thought the tortellini was bland and it did come with a very soupy sauce that did taste good, but it would have been better if it was thicker. 2) I tried my friends' food as well, but nothing really stood out as amazing. 3) We sat in the middle room, but unfortunately we could smell the odor of #2's when people would come in and out of the bathrooms which are close to where we were sitting.  Not really the restaurant's fault, but it definitely did not help with the experience.

It's like sitting in a backyard and is well decorated with lights, tiki torches, etc - it was a really nice ambiance at night. It is worth noting that the indoor dining room was beautiful too. There were multiple rooms that each have a different feel and overall it is very homey and romantic. The server was very friendly and brought us bread and olive oil right away. She was helpful recommending red  wines. For our entrees, we had the lasagna and spinach shell pasta. The lasagna was massive, a giant brick that could feed a family - not a bad value for $18. The size was very impressive although we thought the taste was only good, not great. The spinach pasta was tasty and a very large portion for a reasonable  $15. Overall, this is a beautiful, homey Italian restaurant definitely worth visiting whether you eat inside or outside.

My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday and go the dinner for 2 special: an appetizer, two salads, two entrees, and a desert. We each ordered a glass of cabernet. My glass was very acidic tasting, and burned when I drank it. My boyfriend, who ordered the same exact wine, did not have that experience. I tried his, and either they gave me very old wine, or a different kind, but they did not taste similar. The appetizer was OK, we got the Asparagi e Prosciutto Freddo. The entrees were terrible. The salad was also just ok. My boyfriend got the Linguini al Frutti di Mare. I would go as far as saying that was the worst dish I have ever tried a restaurant. the pasta was barely cooked. Some noodles were still stiff. The seafood was a mix of overcooked shrimp, and undercooked mussels. I got Pollo Florentino which was much better than his, but that wasn't saying much. In tasted like a frozen stuffed chicken kiev. For dessert we shared the Donatella which was super dry, and the ice cream was freezer burned.

2015-11-02,5.0,"There are so many wonderful Italian places in Chicago, but this has so many things that the others lack: huge portions without sacrificing authenticity, top notch flavors without resorting to price gauging, RESERVATIONS, and the atmosphere that makes you feel like you're eating in your Italian neighbor's cozy living room. I'm more of a casual folk by nature, so the ritzier type may not take kindly to their lack of stemmed wine glasses or their casual ambiance that has just enough Italian cheeziness to make you smile; but those who have a heart for food will not leave disappointed. We stumbled upon Rose Angelis on a cold February night while house hunting in what turned out to be a neighborhood that was grossly outside of my budget. It was the best mistake I've ever made. The food. Dear Lord the food. This fulfills the definition of ""comfort food"" in every sense of the phrase, and spans every course from wine to dessert. Their specials vary from week to week, and typically coincide with the season. They have an appetizer ""special"" salad-- which my family has deemed the Volcano salad-- and is easily split among 3-4 people. They also always have a flatbread on their list of specials that has always been out of this world and packed with a myriad of ingredients.  With that said, get the steak bruschetta as an appetizer. The meat is cooked so perfectly, and it's like your favorite Italian dish and Mexican dish had a baby. You will inhale it before knowing what happened. Don't be alarmed. Wash it down with one of their excellent (and affordable) red wines. While it's such an overused phrase, the lasagna is legitimately the size of your head. Like Barry Bonds' post-steroids head. Split it, or plan on taking home leftovers. Otherwise, you will eat yourself into physical pain because it is so darn good. If you're visiting during the fall season, get the pumpkin ravioli if it is listed as a special that week. Honestly, the food never disappoints, but it's so difficult for me to stray away from the Mezzalune al Burro. Spinach ravioli, and cheese, and sundried tomatoes, and browned butter sauce, and toasted pinenuts, oh my. It's simple, yet sensational.

2015-09-17,5.0,"I think I've reviewed Rose Angelis in the past but I'm not seeing that review, so here's what is essentially be an update to my prior reviews. I ate here last night. Granted, this place is not for everyone, but it's one of my Chicago favorites. Definitely in my top-10 even if most of the others, high and low, are quite different. The restaurant's in a residential setting that I find quite charming, it has a lovely patio, it feels very homey, it has terrific waiters (and, am I really saying this, really wonderful ""busboys"" (there has to be a better word for them)?), the prices are confoundingly reasonable, and a lot of the food is, in my opinion, superior. Even the owner/chef will say hi, because he really is saying hi. This is that sort of place. The host Brian is a great guy, very personable. My food favorites are the eggplant parmesan, the manicotti, the lasagna, the steak, the ""appetizer"" pizza, and the bread pudding. They will ""give you some heat"" in the red sauce if you ask for it, dialing it up or down as you wish--and this is especially great with the eggplant.  Though for years my go-to dish was the eggplant, I have now been partaking of the steak more and more, in part because I am now more able to go to the restaurant on days when the serve it (I think, every day but Fri and Sat). I like steak rare, and it's a beautiful, flavorful steak cooked perfectly. Also, considering the massiveness of the steak and the accompanying sides (grilled asparagus and sun-dried tomato mashed potatoes), how can this steak be only $22! As I said to my companion last night about last night's steak, it was one of the best I've had this year, from January to mid-September, in Chicago, despite a lot of restaurant eating and quite a few trips to the steak heavyweights and to Fogo de Chao. Bavettes steak was better but different and way, way pricier, and EJ's (Skokie) steak was really awesome but not as good as Rose Angelis'. The soups have never done it for me, nor has the grilled calamari, which is then sauced in a way that--as I think I said before--removes the ""grilled flavor"" and texture and turns the grilled calamari, which is served in strips that look like noodles, into noodles that seem pleasantly seafood. I also find some of the food grossly overwrought, but then I've simply stayed away from it. For example, the gnocchi is, in my opinion, the worst thing ever, loaded up with too-heavy gnocchis, and just a ridiculous amount of cream sauce, walnuts and dried apricots. It grosses me out just to think about it. And, yes, some portions are almost disgustingly large--but I've never understood the grousing about that. If the portion's too large for you, you don't eat it all, and you have leftovers, and at the low cost of the food here, I don't have any problem with that and can't see why others should either.       So, again, one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Just order the right stuff and enjoy!!",0.9982,0.78,0.176,0.044,0.5743997113997115

The cocktails are fine - well made but not spectacular - but the wine list is a hidden treasure. you'll find an amazing Barolo or Amarone at too good to be true prices.  They also have a small but quality selection of Amaros, if you need one for the road.

We also ordered the calamari -- so fresh and light, and an unbelievably large portion. We couldn't even finish it with four people.  I had the gnocchi with apricot and prosciutto in a cream sauce. It was warm, comforting, soft, gooey delicious. Again, portions were huge and I took over half the entree home. My sister tried the duck tortellini with spinach and tomatoes -- delicious! The tomatoes brighten up the duck, and you can tell the pasta is fresh.  For desert, we had the pear lasagna. The slices of pear help the lasagna keep its shape, and it came with an amazing, deep caramel sauce. The portion was huge and we couldn't even finish it.  The atmosphere is lively and welcoming.

2015-03-30,4.0,"Cute little restaurant.  Good food.  Giant portions. Rose Angelis is in the middle of nowhere.  It exists in an old house in a sleepy neighborhood.  As you walk through several rooms, each is darker than the last.  We dined in the room all the way at the back, and it was nicely dim and romantic. The tables are a little weird.  They seemed rough and sticky.  Was there wax on it?  Some other substance?  I wasn't a fan of whatever decoration left them strangely gunky. There's a casual vibe here.  Most of the employees are in black T-shirts.  The decorations aren't really fancy.  They look like your aunt's attempt to recreate her visit to Rome. I wasn't a fan of the fact that the wine came in regular glasses.  I know it's not necessary to drink wine out of a long-stemmed glass, but it helps elevate the meal, psychologically speaking.  My glass of pinot noir wasn't great. I did love the music.  Sinatra, Nat Cole, Louis Armstrong.  Oldies but goodies. Let's get to the food... * Bruschetta di Carne Asada  ($12.95)  Toasted Italian bread topped with grilled skirt steak,mixed greens, sauteed onions and sliced grape tomato, drizzled with a spicy cilantro aioli.     Holy Lord, this was AMAZING.  It's worth coming here just for this appetizer.  It smells like the best Mexican food you've ever eaten.  The steak is amazingly moist and tender.  Just melts in your mouth.  Legitmately, one of the best things I've eaten in Chicago. * Rigatone alla Lorena ($18.95) Rigatone tossed with Italian sausage, roasted red bell peppers,  spinach and mozzarella cheese in an aglio e olio sauce with seasoned bread crumbs.   As other have said, the portion is HUGE.  I was only able to knock back about a third of this before throwing in the towel.  The pasta came out insanely hot, so don't just start shoveling it in your face.  While I liked the pasta, the sausage was a bit game-y.  The sauce was quite good.  I brought it home for leftovers. * Donatella ($7.95) Vanilla pound cake in warm caramel sauce with white chocolate ice cream and strawberries. I didn't like the pound cake.  It had a really weird, almost chalky consistency.  The ice cream had an interesting texture and tasted great with the caramel sauce and strawberries. I really liked Rose Angelis and I'm sure I'll be back for more.  This is well worth the detour to a sleepy neighborhood!",0.9945,0.793,0.161,0.047,0.4606575198680463

Large portions, friendly staff, and tasty food.   We started with the Bruschetta di Carne Asada, which was very tasty and something different than the typical Italian appetizer (make sure to ask for extra pepper when they bring it out). We split the Tortellone Anatra Ubriaco and Pollo al Vesuvio for our main course. The Pollo al Vesuvio was delicious, very flavorful and cooked perfectly. This takes 45 minutes to prepare but well worth the wait.  The Tortellone Anatra Ubriaco (duck filled tortellini) lacked a little flavor.

Our appetizer ( grilled calamari ) was large slices of large calamari body that seemed more boiled rubbery, and tastless than grilled and flavorful. Maybe that's me, as I am used to smaller squid that is tender and quickly grilled full of flavor. This was definitely over done and served in a heavy, almost gravy sauce that killed what calamari flavor was present.Ordered linguini with mixed seafood for main course. First mussel I tasted had turned, so didn't even try the others, The whole thing was overdone, tiny rubbery scallops, rubbery calamari rings. Shrimp was ok. , but slightly overdone as well - even the linguini was a bit soft and over done, beyond al dente for sure.

2014-12-12,3.0,"I stopped in for dinner here just as the restaurant opened for dinner and was treated like royalty. On certain nights, there is a dinner special for 2 with a good price for 2 entrees, a shared appetizer and shared dessert which makes a meal quite affordable. The waitstaff were excellent, explaining each menu item and answering questions completely.  The portions are HUGE. Even the Caesar salad was easily enough for 2 or even 3 people. I had the seafood linguini in a red sauce with mussels, shrimp, scallops, and squid. It was heavy on the squid which was somewhat chewy and light on everything else (including the noodles). The elements of the dishes were high quality and fresh. However, absolutely nothing was prepared with salt (including the dressing on the Caesar salad) and there are no salt and pepper shakers on the table. After asking for and then waiting for the salt shaker, I had to empty about a quarter of it into the pasta dish to make it edible. Once seasoned, I could appreciate the tomato flavor of the sauce. Same thing with the Caesar salad. Once it was seasoned, it tasted like Caesar salad. This same problem has been reported by other reviewers. I am a doctor, so I get the whole effort to provide healthier food. But not salting food enough to appreciate the flavors of the other ingredients is just stupid. Then, if the chef elects to commit this error, not making salt shakers readily available on the table is just inexcusable. When I end up paying over $50 for salad, entree, and a glass of wine, I expect my food to be adequately seasoned.  So, although the waitstaff was perfect and the ambience lovely, I will not be back until the chef learns how to season food properly.",0.979,0.802,0.145,0.053,0.48561576354679803

In my humble opinion, Rose Angelis is one of the best - if not the best - place to go for Italian in The Chi.

I almost always order one of the pastas, and you really can't go wrong. It's not just your standard Italian American fare that you could prepare yourself, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the unique combinations of ingredients. And lots of vegetarian options.

What I liked... ~ Service:  Sergio and his team were on top of everything - refills on drinks, water, and whatever we needed.  He was very friendly. ~ Ambience:  The restaurant is small and quaint.  Our large group was seated in a semi-private area.  It made my cousin's 30th birthday celebration feel even more special. ~ Food:  Everyone in our group enjoyed their entrees - mostly pasta.  For  me, it wasn't the best Italian meal I have ever had, but it was pretty good.

He said ""because it allows them to clear a table faster."" So that interaction doesn't make sense...the chefs let it go out under seasoned? Anyways, you get my drift.

We all left stuffed and with leftovers to take home.  Wine prices were extremely reasonable. Service was spotty. It took a long time for someone to come to our table and a long time for them to bring us our wine.

Let me say that the appetizers we had (both bruschettas) were very good and so was the Minnestrone soup. However, you don't go to this kind of restaurant just for appetizers. There were 4 of us....and all 4 of us hated our dinners.  The lasagna was enormous and unfortunately, it was all cheese.....and more cheese...did I mention they use lots of cheese? It was like eating a plate full of ricotta and maybe a noodle was tossed in somewhere as a layer. The chicken Marsala was completely tasteless. Which is very hard to do considering what it's marinated in. The ravioli with salmon was down right disgusting. It was like eating frozen fish sticks that had been microwaved and then cooked for too long. So some were rubbery and some tasted like what I imagine a sweat sock might taste like. The strip steak was the best of the 4 meals, but that is not saying much. I get that it's an Italian restaurant so maybe steak wasn't the best call for someone to order, but if its on the menu, it should be at least edible. The prices were reasonable but even that would not bring any of us back. And it's a shame because its a cute looking place.

Lasagna was one of the best plain lasagna's we've had (that's why this place actually got 3 stars).  Duck tortellini was decent, but nothing to write home about.   Pork chop, stuffed with apples, sounded like a great concept - but the dryness of the chop and the brick (polenta) next to it, couldn't be overcome.

I ordered some half moon spinach ravioli which was recommended by the waiter and it tasted like.. Yup nothing!! All I tasted was the boiled butter. We ate nothing..

2013-07-01,1.0,"Lovers of quality cuisine beware. Rose Angelis is obviously a charming and beloved local venue. It's dark halls and shaded garden set a friendly and intimate tone. If restaurants were judged solely on ambience, Rose Angelis would never have a problem.  My girlfriend and I dined there last night. It was her second time and my third. My first experience a few years ago was rock solid. My second go-round a year ago, I left wondering whether they were slipping. Last night, unfortunately, was the last time I will ever, EVER eat at Rose Angelis. Why? The food was just God-awful. Veering from poor to downright repellant. Here's a perfect example: we actually left much of the grilled calamari uneaten. Who does that? Nobody. Because grilled calamari is delicious. But when it tastes rubbery, bland and soaked in mystery broth, it really isn't. Not so much grilled as it was boiled and drowned in this watery brown broth with its fellow victim, a pile of mushy, lifeless spinach, the only reason so much of this appetizer ended up in our stomachs was because my girlfriend and I were famished by the time we had arrived and had ran out of bread. And then the salad we ordered to share. Yikes. Basically, it was a Caesar salad sort of encased in an odd assortment of large, unseasoned lettuce leaves, turnip coins and cucumber spears. This tee-pee of vegetables was visually impressive but its taste ranged from ordinary to bland. With no seasoning and no dressing but the Caesar portion inside, the Rose Angelis diner is invited to gnaw on raw vegetables like Tarzan or waste half the salad. But the epic fail of the evening was my girlfriend's Chicken Marsala. The mystery broth was back with a vengeance. It suffused her dish and mine. Chicken Marsala is not soup and everywhere else I've ever had it, it was served on a plate. This was served in a large bowl. The chicken was water-logged and utterly devoid of taste. The vegetables that adjoined it in the bowl were like perfectly-preserved drowning victims washed up on a beach, gently drying in the waning sunlight. My girlfriend basically gave up after about five bites and when I sampled it, I was surprised she had lasted that long. For an encore, my girlfriend became nauseated and just wanted to leave. Thanks for serving my girlfriend crap and making me pay $90 for the privilege, Rose Angelis. I won't forget it. I had ordered the rigatoni and it wasn't much better - redeemed only by the fact that the savory sausage coins it featured  had almost certainly been created offsite and had somehow weathered the storm of this chef's madness. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't rigatoni supposed to occur in a creamy to slightly chunky viscous, even cheesy tomato sauce? This was like rigatoni soup. The brown mystery broth had not only taken over my girlfriend's dish but had flooded mine, too. I managed to get through about a third of it before I couldn't take any more. The wine was good - I had three glasses. The staff was warm and welcoming. Our waiter was especially pleasant.  If they had had a different chef, the evening would have turned out splendidly. But the food was just that bad.  So, if you and your date have lost the power of taste, perhaps in an unfortunate accident, I can highly recommend Rose Angelis. If not, take it from me - stay away.",0.8559,0.79,0.114,0.096,0.5321636471636471

Cilantro vinaigrette? Can you say Identity crisis?). Lets start with what really matters, the Food. Everything we had was underwhleming, if not almost inedibile.  The eggplant parmesan was a soggy mess of mushy eggplant smothered in a watery, bland poor excuse for a marinara sauce (which seeemed to appear on 90% of the menu along with Ricotta for some uncreative reason) , mozzerela and parmesan cheese that were obviously out of a bag.  Nothing looked or seemed fresh. We managed to eat about half of this dish and gave it back. Next because we were already so disappointed, we decided to share one pasta and play it safe. We ordered a seafood pasta - linguine and shellfish in a white wine sauce.  You really can't go wrong right? Wrong! The pasta was overcooked and swimming in a soupy mess of even more watery tomato sauce than the last horrible version we had on the first course.  Worse, the seafood was obviously frozen and just really not worthy of a restaurat with the price points at this place.  But at least they didn't forget to put a heaping handful of that parmesan from a bag on this seafood soup.  This place either breaks or isn't aware of any of the basic rules of Italian food - like no cheese on shellfish.  We made it through about a third of this dish  because we were hungry until we resigned ourselves to quitting while we were ahead.

This salad is a MUST!!! Each of the four entrees at the table were terrific. I ordered a spinach pasta (in a half-moon shape) that was covered is an AMAZING brown butter, pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes and glorious parmesan.

The food, staff and restaurant in a converted house on Wrightwood is simply the best.  Imagine your favorite type of movie and substitute. Mine is romantic comedy.

When the professional server comes to your table to tell you all the amazing specials, bring a pad of paper to write them down. Musts: Get the special salad. Whatever you do, get it. It is a salad volcano. Any of the pasta dishes will be great. Get wine, you have to, it is Italian place. For dessert: you will probably be way too stuffed, but just keep going.

2013-01-17,4.0,"This is a nice and unassuming neighborhood Italian restaurant that is full of surprises (more on that later). Our waiter was very knowledgable of all the dishes and service was quick and attentive. It's actually a romantic place, dimly lit and definitely not pretentious. Good casual date place. My wife and I were here for our anniversary. Now the surprises. Of course every good italian restaurant has a bottle of olive oil on the table. Check. But I found this olive oil to be really tasty - hints of red peppers, garlic, fennel? and maybe even some bell peppers.  Next, we ordered the calamari, and it's wasn't what we were expecting. The calamari isn't deep fried, but instead cooked with spinach, red onions and sliced and mixed together in a sauce. At first I was dissapointed (my taste buds were expecting the usual deep fried version) but with each bite I grew to love it. Before long, that app was gone. Next, my wife ordered the linguine mare which is shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops mixed in a red sauce. Not too heavy and quite tasty. I ordered the Mezzalune al Burro: half moon spinach pasta stuffed with ricotta in a sweet brown butter sauce with pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes. Again, not to heavy and quite tasty. To finish this great meal off, we tried the chocolate mousse: 1 giant scoop of white chocolate and 2 giant scoops of chocolate. (i suggest you get the raspberry sauce on the side, it's a little tart).  All in all, Rose Angelis serves up some great italian food. Expect to be surprised. tip: the portions here are huge (including the appetizer) so pace yourself. And One wednesdays/thursdays, there's a $49.99 special for two people that includes 1 app, 1 large salad, 2 entrees and 1 dessert. And unlike most places, you can pick anything from the main menu.

It tasted like someone never met salt in his life :)...I had to ask for salt and that is never good. Also, I had an appetizer that was supposed to be calamari with mushrooms and spinach...the only thing I tasted there was spinach, I don't know what was the rest on my plate.

I can literally order something and eat it for dinner for the next three days.  What prompted my review is this: last week my husband and I stopped by for an impromptu dinner out on a Sunday. I ordered the melanzane alla parmigiana (the best in the city, IMHO) and he ordered the steak with gorgonzola cheese.  About two bites in, he remembered that he doesn't like the taste of gorganzola. Oops. Our server noticed right away that he was not eating his dinner and asked if anything was wrong. We explained that he didn't like the cheese, but it was his own fault and by no means did we want her to worry about it. Luckily, he has ordered a side order of pasta, which was enough for a meal anyway. At the end of our meal, our server came by with the check and insisted that we would not pay for the steak.  What a lovely surprise when it was totally my husband's fault!

The $13 monstrous Lasagna needed a little more meat, but it was full of ricotta and flavorful pasta sauce. The duck had a smoky flavor that complimented the sweet of the pine nuts and sauteed spinach. The cheese didn't exactly mix well with the soupiness of the wine sauce, so I probably would have chosen more a drier, grated Parmesan than a melted Mozzarella. Still, it was yummy. The bread was nothing special.  The tiramasu drizzled with a sweet cream sauce over top isn't as traditional as what I am used to, but it was still very tasty.

The real problem was the food.  It had no taste whatsoever.  Totally bland.  We had an underwhelming plate of mussels in an underwhelming (see: tasteless) red sauce as an appetizer.  Then I had a completely tasteless piece of grilled salmon in a tasteless red pepper cream sauce with tasteless roasted vegetables for dinner.  At lease I could take solace in ordering something healthy, right?  Except for the cream sauce?  I sampled my friend's pumpkin ravioli, which our waiter claimed was ""to die for"".  There were some good bits in there, like walnuts and some cinnamon flavor, but it was all but washed out by a completely flavorless white sauce.   All the calories, but none of the flavor.  Not worth it.

A recent visit left a bad taste...literally.  Service was awesome, as ususal.  Prompt, professional, and smooth even on a busy night.  Drinks and wine also excellent, as usual.  But the menu has veered off-course.  Too many ingredients (all good quality independently) in the dishes.  The Pizza Del Giorno was good as we waited for a table.  The soup of the day - a garlic and mushroom cream-based soup sounded fantastic.  When it arrived, however, it was little more than a bowl of flavorless brown, watery cream with melted cheese glopped in the middle.  But the salad was ok.   On to the entrees.  Ugh.  Frutti Di Mare was more like F**ing Night Mare.  Yes, the linguini was fresh and there was not a single thing wrong with any individual ingredient.  But the white wine and tomato sauce was bland at best and there was too much of it compared to the rest of the dish, so it swamped the dish.  To be very fair, our excellent server suggested a different sauce - agli olio with some pesto - that I ignored to my stomach's detriment.  Again, to be clear, the quality of the food was very good - the squid was properly prepared, the mussels were perfectly open, the shrimp were completely (but not over) cooked.  The dish was as if someone felt they had to fill the entire pasta dish with something and, well, tonight it was bland tomato sauce.  Dish Two:  Duck filled pasta with a cognac creme sauce.  How could you possibly screw this up?  Oh, add too many ingredients.  The pasta itself was very good, as was the duck.  The sauce was also very good, but undercooked (a reduction should not appear as a broth in the bottom of the dish, but rather have a thicker consistency that slightly adheres to the pasta...or so I've been told).  The mozzerella balls and giant scoop of grated cheese and spinach ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT.  Great pasta, good sauce (even if under cooked) could easily stand alone as a fantastic, if rich, dish.  Put the spinach on the side if you have to (perhaps they did not blanch the spinach or sauteed it with the sauce and that's what watered it down?).   As with this entirely too long review, the chef should have stopped about 1/3 of the way in each of his or her recipes.  KISS (Keep It Simple S******d).

First the pros: The service was good.  They were Friday-night slammed but still really cool and kept the flow going. Location..let's face it it's right there...super convenient for anyone that lives in the neighborhood and the idea of walking to the restaurant is attractive. The cons: The location must be the reason this place is still in business because the main detraction, and the only one that really matters, is that the food is awful. First off, the beauty of all Italian cuisines is the simplicity.  Fish simply grilled, pasta with good oil and fresh herbs, steak with little or no seasoning, fresh cheeses with tomatoes, etc.  These guys just don't get that.  The had a beautiful calamari with a perfect sear on it and then covered (ruined) it with gobs of cheap gooey cheese, spinach (which gave off all it's water into the dish), raisins and God knows what else.  I say this is not Italian cooking but more to the point this wouldn't work in any style.  Every dish was truly a dog's dinner--everything thrown into a pan and cooked together.   Also, someone needs to explain to the chef about draining the pasta.  A little pasta water to help the sauce stick is expected but all four plates on our table were floating.  Couple this with the spinach in every dish and the food was floating in a half-inch of water.   The only plate that didn't have water was the Caprese salad, which should have, caused by them using non-fresh mozzarella cheese.   Honestly, not only was the worst Italian I've ever had, it's the worst restaurant I've been to in Chicago.  Not only was it untrue to it's roots the food is just plain horrid.",0.9701,0.764,0.147,0.088,0.5940719696969697

Seriously, wear pants that have a hidden elastic panel and you'll thank me. I'm not talking about the greasy messy fattiness. I'm referring to the cheesy, flavorful and hearty dishes that a grandma in an Tuscan village would cook. When you pull out a slice of the pizza, the mozzarella is so stretchy and stringy that you'll be wanting to order everything in the menu and not worry about its consequences. The tortelini with gorgonzola, lasagna and the eggplant parmesan which can be considered traditional Italian dishes are brought to life in a whole different way. Most of their pasta are prepared in-house and you can taste the freshness. The service was fantastic for our large table and our waiter did an exceptional job in reciting a huge list of special items not in the menu. Then, why just four stars you ask... The bread pudding. Its too caramelly sweet and rich for my palate. I really enjoyed the Tiramisu though. Definitely a place that's worthy of all the rave reviews.",0.9898,0.765,0.207,0.028,0.6356060606060606
2012-01-30,4.0,"We're newbies to the 'hood and thought this place looked cute, so we checked it out over the weekend.  It was jam-packed on Saturday night around 8ish and we were told it'd be about an hour wait.  So we had wine in the bar area and waited.  Luckily we were able to snag a seat so it wasn't so bad, though we were starving.   Though they don't take reservations, Im not totally clear how they seat people because there were several people who came in after us who were seated pretty much immediately when they came in, and other people who came in after us and had to wait but they were still seated before us.  Do regulars get priority?  Or is there some kind of call-ahead setup? After our hour-ish wait, we were finally seated and nearly inhaled the bread and olive oil at the table.  Oops.  We shared the caprese for our starter which was okay, but the tomatoes were kind of mushy and the mozzarella was kind of dry.  Our mains were both very good, though.  I had the Tortellone Anatra Ubriaco which I absolutely loved, and my husband had the Gnocchi con Prosciutto e Albiococca Secca which was good, but it was a little too rich for me.  It had all the things that I love, but it was just too much.   The food wasn't the best Italian I've ever had, but it was definitely good.  The portions were way too big, though.  I think even if we hadn't eaten nearly the entire loaf of bread first, we still wouldn't have been able to finish our main courses.  We both brought over half of ours home with us.  I think next time we will share one app and one main and call it a night. The ambiance is great.  It's warm and cozy but very lively, too.  It definitely has that neighborhood feel and it must be a favorite given the crowds.  Anxious to check out one of their weeknight specials.",0.9961,0.79,0.182,0.028,0.5614285714285714

It honestly tasted like it had been sitting out for 30 minutes. My friend got one of the night's specials, a pizza that sounded amazing.

2011-11-15,4.0,"We arrived at Rose Angelis at 7:30, figuring we'd wait in the bar for 20-30 minutes.  We were seated almost immediately... what a treat! For those who haven't been here (and I'm presuming that's most of you, or you wouldn't be searching for reviews of the restaurant on Yelp! now, would you?) Rose Angelis appears rather small from the street front, but it goes back farther than you can imagine. The restaurant is set up kind of like a train... one room, after another room, after another room, ad infinitum.  As the matre'd walked us back to our table, in the far back, we walked through room after room, admiring the offerings we saw on the tables as we passed through each room.  Passing from room-to-room we were bombarded with delicious aromas and vistas of beautifully prepared foods, by the time we finally arrived at our table (a bus transfer and a cab ride) we were properly salivating. We were not disappointed.  We ordered a winsome Chianti, and started with a salad of mixed greens, heirloom cherry tomatoes, and a wonderful dressing.  We followed with eggplant Parmesan, zuppa de pesce, duck tortellini, and special of the day ravioli with a cherry & pinenut dressing. I have to forewarn you.  Bring your appetites, Rose Angelis doesn't know how to prepare anything small. I'm not a small guy... I have a good appetite, and rarely leave anything on my plate.  We all took our meals home in doggy-containers (and the poor dog didn't get any of it).. for second and THIRD meals!  Honestly, if we'd been eating sparingly, the four of us could have shared the eggplant Parmesan alone.... it was large enough to feed a small third-world country. Now... you'd think after all that food we wouldn't have enough room for dessert.  And you'd be right, but that didn't stop us from sharing a Tiramisu.  It was really a Tiramisu Tower!... About 8 inches tall, and about 4 inches square, it was a meal in itself.  And while it didn't taste at all like a traditional Tiramisu... (no ladyfingers, very little rum flavour)... it was a treat of another style.  Dense (like cheesecake), and flavourful throughout. Rose Angelis isn't a cheap night... (not after you've added a bottle of wine... or two... and dessert)... but for the amount of food they serve you, it's actually a great value... and the food was delicioso!!  I'd go again, and this time I'd share an entree!",0.9961,0.84,0.15,0.009,0.5806949806949805

For dessert we tried the tiramisu and that was lackluster as well...it tasted a lot more like a cake than tiramisu, the chocolate layer was very dense and not my favorite.   They also serve their wine from mini water glasses, just very odd and made me feel like I was at some truck stop diner drinking a $3 bottle of wine.   Rose Angelis is a very cute, intimate dinner spot and maybe we'll give them another try someday....but I'm sad to say that our first visit was not very impressive.",0.9677,0.789,0.143,0.068,0.6294398130605027

On our first visit, when we loved the soup so much - only one of us liked our entree, but we decided to try it again because the soup was utterly amazing (alas, it was a special, they don't always have it).  We did have a minor hiccup when we asked if we could get some different dipping for the dessert fondue because we didn't care for berries -- we were denied, but we understood because maybe those things are pre-portioned.  Not the end of the world... but.... On our second visit, we did the Wednesday special - appetizer, salad, entree and dessert for $49. For our appetizer, we had prosciutto wrapped asparagus spears which were cold, and the ""prosciutto"" seemed more like ham lunchmeat than prosciutto.. seriously.  The appetizer was weird, to say the least. For my entree, I wanted to order the steak, which comes with sun-dried tomato mashed potatoes.  I asked if I could substitute sauteed vegetables (or anything else at all) for the mashed potatoes because I don't like tomatoes. The waiter checked with the chef, who denied my request ""because it's one of the Chef's specialties"". Seriously?  You're going to let your ego and/or the purity of your dish get in the way of giving a paying customer what they're asking for?  I'm sorry, but that's just offensive.  I'd have been more than willing to pay a few dollars (even though I don't feel I should have to) to swap out the side, but it's not like these entrees are pre-made and it's any effort whatsoever to give me a different side. In case you're wondering: No, it wasn't busy.  A ""different than normal"" order shouldn't throw a wrench into things. Since he wouldn't make the substitution I had the pork chop instead - it was ok, but nothing special.  It wasn't particularly well seasoned, but it wasn't bad. Even with the ""good deal"" of a $49 full course meal for 2 - after 1 drink each, the tax, and the tip - the bill came out to $80 for food ranging from ""bad"" to ""better than average"" (my girlfriend did enjoy her pasta dish, mostly) -- not worth the expense. My biggest issue, and maybe I'm out of line here, is the absolutely ridiculous refusal to allow me to get a different side ""because that dish is one of the Chef's Specialties""...  Gee, how DARE I threaten the sanctity of the Chef's creation because of my personal taste...

But dessert is where this place just jumped to the first spot. I had a pear lasagna, yes that's right a pear lasagna. And on the side was homemade pumpkin ice cream (I went in November), they hand make it for each dish (so they tell me). It was decadent and incredible, words can't describe it!

2011-07-13,2.0,"I write this with a heavy heart, because of the great memories of Rose Angelis.  It was my first Italian place as an adult.  It was my first regular restaurant that i was picking up the tab.  It was my first neighborhood place!  But, you know when you thought you loved somebody, and you see them again, spend some time with them and you realize that they are not so great.  Your new experiences in life make you realize that the way you used to do it, just wasn't that great.  That is Rose Angelis.     My wife and I lived in the neighborhood from 92-06, then moved a neighborhood away for the last 5 years.  We have eaten there more times than we can remember (we even partied one time with the former partner at our place into the wee hours of the morning.)  The last five years we probably caught the place about once or twice a year, and always walk away saying, why did we go back, there are about 10 different places within a couple miles that blow it away.  Last night might have been the last time we go.   It is below average Italian food, served too fast.  My wife's ravioli was on par with a weight watchers frozen entree.  My gnocchi was just plain gross (and i am gross for eating so much of it...). The gnocchi was like store bought quality (you know when you eat great gnocchi, then try and recreate at home by buying the packaged stuff, that is how this tasted.)  The texture of the accompanying items in the dish were horrible.  The green scallions were raw and the ham was clumped together like cheap lunch meat.  I am a pig and eat anything and this was just not that good.  It really was like if I asked my 8 year old to make me a past a dish.   The kicker was the service.  (I guess we always go back to the place because of habit and because it is pretty darn cool in that old house.)  Our waiter took three tries to bring the right bottle of wine, which wasn't a big deal, but never mentioned that it was 1/2 price bottle day.  We had to over hear it from another table.  We also got drinks while we were waiting and the bartender never told us, so we spent more on two glasses of wine than we would have on an entire bottle.  Oh well, back to the food.  We have always complained that the food comes out too quickly.  We ordered our wine, ate some bread (one three piece section was fine, one three piece section was hard as a rock).  We ordered our food after getting the right bottle of wine and about two sips later, our food was out.  The same thing happened to the table next to us, they had a full bottle of wine and you could see that they had taken just a couple bites of their food.  I think McDonald's takes longer to get the food out.  My final thoughts: it was a great first love, but there is just so much better out there.  I give it 2 stars instead of one because she was my first and because the atmosphere is still one of the best around.  The food is just not that great and experience has taught me that it was never that good...",0.9914,0.886,0.092,0.022,0.40144146897878236

Last weekend, being somewhat adventurous and entirely famished, my better half and I found ourselves in this great gem of a restaurant. From the outside, it looks like nothing more than a hole in the wall. Inside, it's as is you've stepped back into someone's large home and just sat down for a comforting, carby meal. The entire place is beyond adorable and has an old world feel. There's no gold-tinted dishes and fancy crystal goblets --instead, you'll feel right at home whether in your Louboutins or flip flops. We started off with a veggie pizza appetizer on a wheat crust. First, it was enormous. Second, it was orgasmic. Delicious, crispy, crunch, fresh and really tasty. We ate half of it because we had an entree coming. Thank goodness we shared an entree (in fact, we even took some home) because it was bigger than my head. The portion sizes here are ridiculously large--be prepared to take home. Our pasta puttanesca was good. I wasn't in love but that's maybe because I don't care for an olive, tons of onions and capers mix. There was unequivocally no room in our bellies for dessert. We took tons of food home for tomorrow's snacks.  Wonderful place. The only down side was the waitress that may or may not have been under the influence of some tension tamers and possible muscle relaxants.

We got seated toward the back of the restaurant at a four top.   The menu was not big but packed full of many delicious options.  It was already difficult to decide and then the server told us the specials for the evening.  As if I didn't have a hard time deciding.  We ended up starting with the special grilled calamari bruschetta appetizer with lasagna for the hubs and the tortellone anatra ubriaco.   The appetizer was awesome.  The spicy aioli sauce on top of the perfectly grilled calamari was a nice touch. There were 5 pieces and very filling.  The bread did fall apart so it was better to eat with a fork and knife.  The entrees arrived some time after the appetizer and placed in front if me was a beautiful sight.  Pockets of pasta stuffed with duck, topped with shaved Parmesan, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and a wonderful sauce.  The pasta was decadent but not rich.  Hubs lasagna was a massive piece, about 5 inches tall and 7 inches wide.  It was the biggest I have ever seen.  We both dug in and all conversation ceased. The portions are so big that we both didn't even make a dent when we stopped.  The majority of the meal was brought home. Service was good although at times it seemed he might have been in the weeds.

Wed/Thurs - awesome value), you get to order one appetizer of your choice, 2 caesar salads, 2 entrees of your choice, and 1 shared dessert of your choice.   It might not sound like too much food, but IT WAS TOO MUCH FOOD.  I can't believe how large the portions were!  I haven't brought home that much food in a long time.  To add to it all, everything we ordered was OUT OF THIS WORLD good.  We really enjoyed with the pizza del giorno appetizer, and devoured our deliciously light and fresh-tasting caesar salads.  After that we were full.  Then our entrees came.  Aged New York Strip and Manicotti del giorno.  Both totally excellent, but we couldn't even make a dent.  How were we supposed to eat this incredible homemade chocolate peanut butter ice cream with blackberries and bananas and caramel?  Well, we found a way.   We literally rolled ourselves out of there, traditional post-Italian-meal style, but it was worth it.  We'll be back.",0.9924,0.837,0.154,0.009,0.5034261534261534
2011-02-16,2.0,"As I mentioned on Monday, Erica and I went to Rose Angelis for a Valentine's Day dinner. We had never been and had only heard good things. What made it even better was the dinner special for two, that included a bottle of prosecco, an appetizer, two salads, two mains and a dessert. Unfortunately the value may have been the best part of the evening, besides the company of course, since our food was only so-so. Oh well, it wasn't the first time a neighborhood Italian spot has dissapointed, and since they are still full most nights I guess I'm in the minority. The place is cute enough, set inside an old house that feels as if they've been there forever. I was surprised how far back it went, and how many seats were actually there. Everyone talks about the romantic charm and feel, but I'd say it just feels quaint and old fashioned. Old does not necessarily mean romantic and charming. Our service was very good and attentive, always filling glasses and removing plates as necessary. The food however was disappointing. Our appetizer was one of the specials, a pizza topped with all sorts of good stuff - sun dried tomatoes, cheese, pine nuts, mushrooms and a tomato pesto spread. It's hard to explain but the pizza was not that tasty. I loved the crust, and each ingredient was fresh, but the total flavor package did not work for me. It certainly was filling, we left a few pieces on the table to make room for the entrees.  Our cesar salad course came next. It was fine and plenty large, the dressing was not overpowering. For our entrees I chose spinach pasta half-moon filled with ricota, served in a brown butter sauce. Erica ordered a seafood linguine in red sauce. My pasta was the best dish we ordered all night, with plenty of flavor and well cooked pasta. The sauce was a little sweet for me, but it tasted better the following day. Erica's dish did not have good flavors, with a very watery and lackluster red sauce over undercooked pasta. The seafood was fine, though hard to tell since the red sauce was so bland.  Our dessert selection was great though: chocolate fondue. It came with some fruit, pound cake and cheese cake. If I had my way there would have been some marshmallows, but even so, it was very good (with many tables around us inspecting our choice). I don't mean to sound like a downer, since we had a nice evening at a local spot with good service and value. We were dissapointed with the food, especially after all the good things we had heard. It happens, but with so many ""cute"" Italian restaurants in the city it's hard to say we'll be back soon.

Rose Angelis of course.  Who knew - but on Thursdays they have dinner for 2 for $49.  Sound like a good deal? Wait until you hear what it includes: 1 appetizer 2 Caesar salads 2 entrees 1 dessert Seriously? That is amazing.  And obviously, we partook. We were seated immediately in the adorable restaurant that used to be a house. For app, we split the pizza of the day.  It was on a whole wheat flatbread with lots of roasted garlic, spinach, peppers, sundried tomato pesto, pine nuts, cheese...the flavor was delicous.  Only complaint was that the texture was a little off.  Around the outside, the flatbread was super crisp, like a crack, but in the middle it got mushy from all the toppings. Caesar was good, nothing remarkable, but a very generous portion size with homemade croutons. For entrees we split the ravioli with pesto cream sauce and duck tortellini.  Both were great, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  The duck tortellini came in some kind of broth, which was weird, but the flavor was great so no major complaints. For dessert we split the espresso cheesecake, which was divine. Our waiter was really nice and attentive.  Why four out of five stars?  The food was super heavy.  EVen though I only ate 1/4 of the pizza, a salad, and a few bites of each main course, and 1/3 of a slice of cheesecake, I couldn't move afterwards.  I still feel full!  Everything seemed to have some sort of cream sauce or cheese sauce.  Sometimes I prefer my Italian food a little bit lighter.

So far, so good.  We get the menu, looked it over, decided on an app and two entrees. We got the grilled Calamari all Griglia, which was grilled calamari with balsamic sauce and vegetables as the app. The calamari was overcooked, the vegetables were soggy, and there was way too much sauce. The sauce was also greasy. Not great, but whatever.  Then for our entrees the hubs ordered the Gnocchi con Prosciutto e Albiococca secca - long winded for gnocchi with cream sauce. I ordered the special seafood lasagna that is supposedly offered only on the weekends, but happened to be a special that was offered that day. Awesome I thought, because not many places offer seafood lasagna... but eeeeek if I only knew what I was getting into....  The dishes came out and there were big portions of white creamy concoctions served in large white bowls. After digging into both dishes we realized both dishes were soupy, like they were swimming in heavy cream. Not a big deal, we figured the cream would set in a couple of minutes because the dishes were hot. Well, they never set. After a bite of each, well, it turned out not only did we get mouthfuls of watery creamy pasta with overcooked mushy noodles, but it was bland as heck. GROSS.  We tried our very best to eat the pasta, but couldn't get past the taste or the texture of either dish. We gave up and left the majority of the dishes intact and untouched.

They were dead on. First off the place was accommodating and loud with the hustle and bustle of a full Friday night. I like that! The wait staff were very pleasant and attentive and the bartender pours a good cocktail ( hence the second star). We started with the tossed salad, which was enough for four to share, and the asparagus and prosciutto. The salad was very tasty. The asparagus were good with the roasted red pepper purée, but got decimated by the dollop of mascarpone cheese they were lying in. Scrape that off and it would have been just fine. Flavors just didn't blend. My wife got Seafood Pasta which was good. Linguini seemed al dente and the sauce was flavorful and full of scallops (bay not ocean) shrimp, squid & mussels. I had, on the waiters recommendation, the special. This was a concoction of some sort of cream cheese sauce( probably mascarpone, seems the chef has an  affinity for this) ravioli, jerk chicken, mango chutney & nutmeg!!!! It was like a 2 year old just threw ingredients together with no thought or it's like one of those days that you order several items because your just not sure what you feel like eating and then you say screw it I'll just mix them all together. The mango chutney was good but totally did not belong on this dish. It would have gone well on some grilled mahi mahi!! The ravioli had to be Biutoni brand out of the market. You know those little refrigerated dried ravioli that come in the fancy green package. The jerk chicken belonged on a stick or a sandwich, not in this dish!!!! And the nutmeg....... Come on man, what the Heck were you thinking!!! Totally didn't blend, Andrew Zimmern would have winced if he had taken a bite of this!!! Still had a very good time ( I ate my wife's pasta, sorry Gina haha). We tried the bread pudding for dessert. Rock hard dark blackish brown with the consistency of 10 year old fruit cake. This was drenched in a caramel sauce, probably to make it more moist. The caramel sauce was good the bread pudding was not! The espresso was flavorful with a nice crema and the grappa was good.

This was a very cute Italian restaurant.  A nice boy took me here when we were looking for a nice place to have dinner after work.  He told me that this restaurant has the best lasagna he has ever had.  I, of course, having an Italian mother who specializes in lasagna could not order lasagna.  I did try a bite and it was quite tasty.  It had no meat in it and still was very flavorful, that is impressive.   I had the ravioli filled with ricotta.  Now, generally, ravioli is ravioli, but the sauce on this ravioli was delicious and the ravioli was cooked perfectly.  While, I was not wowed, I really did enjoy it. I like the atmosphere of this restaurant.  We sat outside, which was really nice.   Now, the reason for the 3 instead of the 4, I didn't like the server.  I don't know why, but he just rubbed me the wrong way.  He was nice, but almost pushy or something.  I can't really point out exactly why he bothered me.  And while the food was very good, it was nothing to rave about.  Hence, the 3 (or 3.5, if they would allow me to rate it that). I will try this place again and try a more unique dish perhaps, to get the full experience.",0.9845,0.753,0.184,0.063,0.6172

2010-05-17,5.0,"Things I hate: pretentious, fancy pants Italian. Things I love: Rose Angelis. I've been to Italian places where you get 1 ravioli with such beautiful plating that you're supposed to weep openly. And I've left those same places thinking I would've rather went to Olive Garden. Rose Angelis does Italian right. Well-made food, traditional recipes, and heaping portions of it! I want Italian where I have to seriously consider unbuttoning my pants and Miss Angelis fits the bill.  The place is tucked away in Lakeview. A few years ago, I lived three blocks away and never heard of it (my bf gets all the credit for introducing me to this hidden gem). Rose Angelis is the chameleon of restaurants - come here for a romantic date (which I've done), a casual dinner with a group of friends (done that too), or a non-touristy restaurant spot to impress out-of-towners (and check).  The regular menu is phenom; but pay close attention the specials. I think everytime I've come here, I've ordered one of their specials. If they're offering the manicotti, go for it. I'd consider giving up my future first born child for the manicotti. They use some kind of mozzarella that has a little bit of smokiness to it and enhances the overall flavor of such a simple dish. The Duck torellone is amazing too and if you're overwhelmed and don't know what to choose, this is a great go-to. And yes, some people have complained about the wait as Rose Angelis doesn't take reservations. But haven't you heard the expression ""good things come to those who wait""? Besides, if you give them your cell phone number, you can skip over to Maeve, the bar next door, and have a few pre-dinner drinks and they'll call you when your table is ready.  Oh oh! One last awesome thing : you WILL have leftovers.",0.9881,0.811,0.147,0.042,0.4696611721611722
2010-05-17,5.0,"I haven't lived in Chicago since the early 2000's (how depressing does *that* sound?!?) but remember my experiences at this restaurant fondly. The back patio was the scene of many a romantic meal with my beloved, as well as casual summer outings with friends. Fast-forward to this decade (seriously, how depressing could *that* be???). My friend's bridal shower was held here recently, and given that she's one of my all-time besties, I was privy to some of the details going into the event. This space is a great idea for bridal showers for several reasons: 1) no room charge 2) patio seating 3) the restaurant is closed on Saturday afternoons, so you can have yourselves a nice little private party 4) ridonka-donk portions of good, hearty Italian food, for a pretty good price. The day was unseasonably cold and dreary with a threat of rain, so we had to move operations to the back room. It was perfect anyway - there are large skylights that opened up the space and highlighted all of the wall murals. Very cute. Getting to the food: yum, yum, delizioso, soooo much food, too. The appetizers were passed and also located on a table. We had a few different kinds of bruschetta (my favorite was the olive tapenade), grilled asparagus and portobello, and even a vegetarian pizza. I was stuffed beyond comprehension from snacking on all that good stuff, but we had yet more and more food to plow through. The meals are plated, another excellent touch for a shower-type event. We all got huge, HUGE plates of Caesar salad to start, and then our choice of the mezzaluna al burro, the rotini alla puttanesca, or the fish of the day, which was mahi-mahi. I am all over puttanesca, though the words ""brown butter sauce"" on the mezzaluna were beckoning...but I was not disappointed. And holy cow, I honestly got a pound of pasta for my dish, as did everyone else who ordered the pasta. The puttanesca is proper - an olive and caper explosion, punctuated with crunchy pine nuts. Do you not doubt that I couldn't turn down dessert, too? Strawberries drizzled with caramel sauce. Tiramisu, which I didn't sample, because...Italian bread pudding was also served and when I see the words ""bread pudding"" I just cannot turn it down. This was utter decadence - the caramel sauce was divine. To top it all off, the service was utterly perfect. We had a server, who passed the apps and tended the tables, and a hostess/waitress, who did an amazing job of corralling the ladies, directing the traffic, and pacifying a few guests who played prima donnas. What an excellent place to spend time celebrating loved ones! A five-star experience, for sure.",0.9989,0.732,0.233,0.035,0.5924047619047618
2010-05-11,3.0,"I'm right in between 3 and 4 stars for Rose Angelis.  My parents came to town a few weeks ago, and a couple co-workers recommended this place. We arrived, and had to wait 45 minutes for a table, but that was the ONLY negative part of the experience. The food was just incredible--we started with a caprese salad, which was fresh and delicious. I got one of the specials, an apple and gorgonzola-filed ravioli dish, my dad got another ravioli dish with a creamy sauce (don't remember the name!) and my mom got the fish special, which was a tilapia dish. We all tried each others' food, and every dish was spectacular. The service, wine and overall atmosphere were wonderful as well. If this was my only experience, I would hands-down have given this place a 5-star review... Fast forward two weeks...I was so excited to have discovered this place that I just HAD to bring my fiance. We went this past Saturday for an early-ish dinner (6:00 or so,) and didn't have to wait at all. We got seated, and ordered a caprese salad (it was, again, super fresh and delicious.) We told the waiter that we needed a minute to decide what we were ordering, and he disappeared for an entire half hour. No joke--we didn't even see him walking around that whole time. Flat out disappeared for 30 minutes. He finally returned and we ordered; my fiance got the duck tortellini, and I got the mezzalune de burro. The food was a little cold, and by that time the room was pretty cold as well. It was decent, but not nearly as good as the first time I went, which was incredibly disappointing.  Overall, I'll probably be back because I know how good this place CAN be...it seems like it might be hit-or-miss at Rose Angelis.

They had a tres leches cake ('tre latte') which I was really excited to see, but it turned out to be merely passable. But that's not to say it wasn't good, I'm just on the hunt for the best ever and this didn't even come close. The bread pudding was pretty good, mostly because it was sooo caramelly.  The atmosphere was great, an old house setting with really high ceilings. I think I saw that they do take reservations, if you just walk in though you'll wait an hour on friday night.

The server was amazing and very knowledgeable, I got the Portobello ripiene con pollo- portobello mushrooms and chicken, I thought the ratio of mushroom to chicken was a little off, I was wanting more mushrooms to accompany the chicken, or even some pasta in there might have been better. It was good and very filling.  My date got a special with sausage and pasta, very rich, I did like that they had other things that weren't on the menu as far as soups, dinner specials and dessert specials.  We got a bottle of Chianti and the server was very informed on the wine and where it came from and the fact of it being a reserve you have to put it in a carafe to open up the aromas of the wine, I liked that because I love learning anything about wines and how they are made and how they are supposed to be consumed.

Such an unrefined dish with humongous chuncks of peppers, apricots, scallions.   I love scallions but no dish should have this many  - it made the sauce look green there was so much! The gnocchi itself didn't have much flavor to it though it had a good texture to it. The sauce was also bland - according to the waiter it was just mascarpone cheese-if they had bothered to season it, it could have been a real tasty sauce... At this point, we decided to skip dessert...they sounded great like everything else, but I wanted no more disapointments....Best thing we had all night was the bread and dipping suace- oil seems to be infused with lots of herbs, olives, garlic, etc. - so it was very tasty.  The setting was warm and cozy.

I can't say there's a main course that I lean towards. I generally like trying their specials. Their eggplant parmesan, however, will get you full and satisfied and give you delicious left overs for the next few days.  I have had the same waiter three of the dozen or so times I have been and (though I wish I knew his name) he always has the best recommendations. Being a vegetarian, I've also had a few requests at times that the staff has never been unwilling or unable to accommodate.  Get dessert. You'll never be unsatisfied.",0.9894,0.796,0.198,0.006,0.47500000000000003
2010-01-14,3.0,"I've been to Rose Angelis three times in the past ten years but last night was my first return visit after about an eight-year hiatus. Let me say right off the bat that it looked exactly the same as I remembered it. (Which, after so long, is a mixed bag. Freshen up the environment a smidge,would ya? It's charming but also just a bit...sad.) Anyway, we had no trouble parking, which was amazing, and when we arrived there was no wait whatsoever. The host was friendly and helpful and the waiter was very good (and fun). We were told about an amazing special for two people. A shared app, two Caesar salads, two entrees (you can pick anything on the menu) and a shared dessert for $49. That's right...not $49 each. $49 total. An awesome deal so we went for it. We chose the Insalata de Caprese: fresh mozzarella, tomato slices, fresh basil, and olive oil. If the ingredients are fresh (and they were) it's hard to go wrong. It was delish! The Caesar salads were fine but they were entirely too generous of a portion. I finished only half, anticipating the onslaught of food yet to come. (That, plus I'd enjoyed some of the fresh bread with rosemary olive oil. So I was heading into the too-full-to-touch-my-entree danger zone.) We were finishing off some bubbly Prosecco (like Italian champagne) when the entrees arrived. I'd ordered off the list of the evening specials: spinach linguine, shrimp, mushrooms, broccoli, a little cheese...quite yummy. My dining companion ordered the chicken marsala. We both quickly agreed that her dish was just okay...mine was pretty darn good. However, we had room for only a couple of bites. And dessert was coming. Ehn. I don't know if there's room...but maybe just a bite? After some debate, we decided on the pistachio ice cream with raspberries, bananas, caramel and a dab of chocolate. I suppose it had that sweet-salty thing going on but after about two bites, I was a goner. Ugh. Too much food. And the presence of the bananas was just wrong, wrong, wrong.  (In my humble opinion.) I'm torn between three and four stars but for a restaurant that's been around for about 18 years now, they should be getting everything right. The marsala was super boring and the portions were just way too big. But...that wouldn't be a problem for many people, I'm guessing.  So we were two people with enough food to feed a crowd, plus flowing bubbly beverages...all under $100 (not including the tip). I'll be back again, I think and will order more conservatively. Skip the marsala, folks, and go with what the waiter recommends.",0.9954,0.743,0.178,0.079,0.5499579831932772
2010-01-07,5.0,"I really love the ambience and food at Rose Angelis. Located on a side street in what appears to be a house, it is a wonderful place to share a romantic meal. I took my girlfriend here last week for our 1 year anniversary. She is a vegetarian and Rose Angelis has a lot of wonderful veggie options.  We split the bruschetta to start and she had the Mezzalune al burro, spinach pasta half moons stuffed with ricotta and pesto served in a seasoned brown butter sauce with sundries tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and parmagiana. She wasn't a big fan of the brown butter sauce but I thought it was wonderful.  I had the Portobello ripiene con pollo- portobello mushroom layered with mushroom pesto, spinach and grilled chicken baked with fresh mozzarella and served with a balsamic vinegar and red wine cream sauce. I really liked this. There were two chicken breasts on top of two Portobello mushrooms. The mushroom pesto was delicious. We did pig out for desert with the bread pudding and tiramisu. I could have done without the tiramisu. The bread pudding was amazing. The Carmel sauce really made this dish. They do have a couple of nifty specials including 1/2 price wine on Tuesday and a fixed prix meal on Wednesday and Thursday.

The restaurant is cozy and intimate.  The service was great, and it was steadily busy for a Wednesday night.  We did the two for $49 special - shared an appetizer, each got a salad and entree, and split a dessert. The grilled calamari app left much to be desired.  It lacked flavor and could have benefitted from a red sauce.  Not sure I'm a fan of calamari unless it's fried.  However, I tried one of the specials for my entree, a sausge manicotti, and it was fabulous.  The noodles were baked a little much (crunchy and needed a knife), but the sauce was sweet and the sausage/filling was superb.  For dessert we split the chocolate mousse, and they nailed it.  Three different types of chocolate, a more than generous serving, and the white chocolate was amazing! Will definitely try this place again.  But maybe not the two for $49, I definitely don't need that much food!",0.9965,0.721,0.279,0.0,0.47681878306878306

We are still getting rave reviews about the food 6 months after the wedding. We served eggplant parm, chicken marsala and cheese ravioli for the family-style main courses.

2009-12-06,3.0,"After all the glowing reviews on yelp, I must say that I was disappointed in this restaurant.  Although the place itself is beyond cute, the food is really just a bit over average.  In a city laden with Italian places, I think one could do better for food.  They do serve large portions at fairly inexpensive prices, but there was just something lacking in some of the dishes that we tried.   Italian cooking is one of those types of cuisines that many think they can do easily.  But it's just not about slapping together olive oil, spices, vegetables and pasta and calling it gourmet.  It's the way one blends it all together and then adds that inexplicable touch that makes Italian cuisine memorable.  For example, one of the best Italian restaurants in the area, Gaetanos in Forest Park - the chef has a way with sauces that simply astounds the taste buds. Rose Angelis, although the food is decent, seems to lack that certain something.  For example, we tried two specials and one appetizer.  The special wood roasted pizza, was really unacceptable to me.  Just a hodgepodge of ingredients that never really came together.  The salad, although huge, wasn't more than average.  And the appetizer, a calamari and onion in a balsamic sauce, was the best thing we had.",0.9736,0.826,0.134,0.04,0.4936507936507936

2009-10-21,5.0,"Wow, it's either hit or miss on Yelp for Rose Angelis, isn't it?  While I just returned with my girlfriend to Chicago for a weekend visit, Rose Angelis was always my favorite Italian restaurant in the city (this would have been well before Jennifer Aniston apparently ruined it for at least one Yelper out there).  At least in my experience, the ambiance has always been cozy and wonderful, with all of these great little separate rooms in the converted house to eat in. I've been there a handful of times and have never sat in the same room twice.  Since it had been years since my last visit, I was worried that this time would be a let down, especially after reading some of the scathing reviews here. I mean, come on people, giving a restaurant ONE star when you admit the food was great just because you were asked to wrap things up? The staff must have been fuming at you.  Well anyway, a few nights ago I finally got to return with my girlfriend and a couple of other friends. Our cab was running late, so my friend and his wife were seated without us (which rarely happens at restaurants anymore... you usually get a whole lot of drama for something like that).  Upon our arrival, we ordered a few half bottles of a delicious Italian champagne and a carefully constructed tower of an appetizer salad for the whole table. I've always loved the salads on RA's specials menu because they are full of colorful, tasty vegetables (this particular salad even sold me on beets, for god's sake!).  The decision on my entree had been made months, even years before, though there were a few specials that almost swerved me. Regardless, I went with my old favorite, tortellini con salsa di noce (gorgonzola filled tortellini tossed with grapes in a walnut pesto cream sauce). Fantastic, even though it had more grapes than any human needs in one sitting.  The best thing about Rose Angelis is that the portion sizes allow you to share everything with your table. So, when the food arrived, we all plated up mini-dishes for everyone to share. My girlfriend had the chicken Marsala, which had to have been three pounds of chicken, perfect for sharing and combining with everyone else's pasta. My friend and his wife had, respectively, the gnocchi with prosciutto in a marscapone sauce, and the ravioli alla Luigi. While the ravioli was standard but still delicious, the gnocchi has knocked my tortellini out of the top spot of Must Have dishes when I return next time.  I was proud of my friends for being determined to save room for dessert, because I was dead set on having the bread pudding. A massive slab of chocolaty goodness soaking in a pool of warm caramel sauce... I have dreams of this dessert. My friend's pecan pie was good, if insanely rich. The coffee wasn't anything to write home about, but serviceable (it tasted a little burnt).  So, a massive appetizer salad, two half bottles of wine, a few other drinks, four entrees big enough to take home a couple of leftover meals, 3 coffees and an espresso, and two HUGE desserts for $150 pre-tip? Worth every penny.  I came close to deducting one star because you still can't make a reservation here. Coming in from out-of-town, I like having a little peace of mind knowing that I don't have to worry that we might get shut out of some of my favorite places. I guess I'd just tell the curious to go on a Sunday night, as it seems to be their least busy time.",0.9981,0.805,0.175,0.02,0.562804414003044

You may be tempted to get it minus grapes but DONT they actually go well with the blue cheesieness. The staff is really nice and they have great memory skills. Its really entertaining to hear them recite the specials. Each special could have 10-15 ingredients and they will remember all of them.

This was one of my most disappointing dining experiences.  People mention portion size, which in theory is great, but only if the food tastes good. At Rose Angelis the food does not taste great, in fact it doesn't taste like much at all.  I made the mistake of ordering the Chicken Marsala, and my date ordered some type of pasta and it was horrendous as well. Both dishes (and our pizza appetizer) were under-seasoned and bland, and boy was there a lot of it, almost to the point of repulsiveness.  The service was also terrible.

2009-07-19,5.0,"I love this place and I love to come here occasionally even though I live an hour and half away from Chicago.  Obviously there are many great reviews describing the food and atmosphere so I won't wax poetic about the ambiance, romance, family-feel, dim light and coziness of the place.  The great reviews are right on the spot. I love the menu because it's very unique and definitely not the basic spaghetti and meatballs you'd find at any other Italian restaurant. It's the feeling of a very close knit environment. Definitely a place you can go with your loved one and be very content with your selections and destination of choice. But I need to address something specific here. I read a previous review below about a woman being upset that she was asked to move her party into the bar area of the restaurant after spending $600 on dinner when they were sitting around after dinner and after they paid. Get a grip, lady, honestly. It's not about the money you spent -- it's about common courtesy to the people waiting to eat dinner. You weren't asked to leave the restaurant, you were asked to move to an area made for socializing.  While I understand your opinion on the functions of a restaurant you also need to understand that there are people in line waiting to eat who couldn't care less if you spent a thousand dollars or how many of your friends you were trying to entertain.  Did you know that average wait time in this place is 1 hour on a normal weekend and nearly 2 hours on a holiday? While you sit there having a party with your buddies, people have been waiting hours to eat.  How about showing some consideration for your public? Here's my 5 star rating to offset your 1 star.   The people serving us and the front staff has not been anything but professional and courteous. If they were ever rushed or anything of the sort it might have been because there are groups of people waiting to eat at all times.  Make sure when you go there on a weekend or holiday you are prepared to wait. Remember also that this is Chicago meaning that there is only street parking and can be very hard to come by so give yourself a little more patience and time. There are two quaint bars across the street you can wait at and they'll actually correspond via phone with Rose Angelis to make sure your party is ready to be seated so you don't miss your turn. That's great service when people who are rushed to sit everyone and keep a bustling restaurant running smoothly also call the bars across the street when your table is ready. My favorite dish at this place is the Mezzalune al burro and Gnocchi con Prosciutto e Albiococca Secca and I absolutely love the Tiramisu for dessert. It's just amazing.  I've never had a bad meal there and the food has always been delicious and delectable.  And furthermore, for the amazing prices you can't say no.  You'll be full to the brim and you'll walk out of there paying under $50 for two people if you don't overdo it on the wine (which is also very reasonably priced.) Definitely give this restaurant a try and post your own review of your experience but do everyone a favor and review the actual restaurant, food and staff and not the lack of your own consideration.",0.9987,0.806,0.185,0.009,0.5464097059588864

The best part of the meal was the house Chianti at $31/bottle and the Caesar salad -- lemony and crisp! The rest of the meal served up a major disappointment for this gal.  On the suggestion of our waiter I went with the duck filled tortellone with spinach (burned) tomato and fresh mozzarella with a wine and cognac reduction. A) I love love love cheese but this was ridiculous! If I wanted clumps of cheese (I am talking about blocks of cheese through out) I would have ordered a side of mozzarella B) the cognac reduction was hardly a reduction and maybe resembled a broth soup better C) the meal just wasn't hot. I want my plates of pasta to come out steamy.  My cousins had the Ravioli with the sun-dried tomato cream sauce AKA the Campbell's tomato soup sauce and the Portobello con Pollo . Blech for both. The chicken was dry and the sauce was an gross mucky-grey color. I understand that the makeup of the sauce was mushroom and balsamic but there must be something you can do to make it look like you aren't eating a hunk of chicken in the middle of a mud puddle.

2009-05-10,1.0,"I used to love this place.  I can't say anything bad about the food, as I have never had anything that didn't taste good there.  And if you do decide to go there, against which I advise you, save room for dessert and get the bread pudding.  But make sure you share it with someone as it is too big.  That being said, this place is not worth your time and integrity. The reason I no longer wish to set foot in this place is because once it got on the map and allegedly Jennifer Aniston went there to dine with whoever she was dating that month, it suddenly became way more well-known.  My friends and I used to go there all the time, because it used to be a nice quaint Italian restaurant with a nice crowd.  Then once it got the celebrity bug, the crowd was suddenly a weird mix of star-wannabes, most of whom probably don't eat pasta if anything at all.  The restaurant got caught up in all of that, and most of the staff became snooty with a horrible attitude. We had a group of 12 people dine there once, coincidentally the last time I ate there.  We ran a bill of nearly $600 if not more, and of course gratuity was included, which we happily paid.  Once we paid, but while we were still eating our dessert and drinking our coffee, we were asked if we can take our dessert and coffee to the bar so they can seat other people.  We were outraged.  How convenient to ask us to do that AFTER we paid our bill.  Most people don't go out to restaurants to just eat, but to spend time with their friends, and the fact that we were rudely asked to stop socializing makes this places a no-no for me.  Apparently, we had been there for an hour and a half, and according to the staff that was a generous amount of time for us to come in, eat, and leave. They have always been sticklers about reservations, which I think is rude.  If you want to act like a top notch restaurant, behave like one.  Telling people that they can't make reservations for groups less than 6 or whatever the number is, does not work in anyone's favor.  But I suspect they love making the extra money off people who are waiting in the small waiting area, which in the winter gets too tight. The restaurant experience is not just about the food, and while the quality of the food is important, the way the customers are treated is also very important.  If I just wanted to eat good food, I can order from anywhere and eat at home or in the park, but I go to restaurants for reasons other than just the food.  Rose Angelis gets a big F for the way it treats its customers now.  We went there before it was this big of a deal, and I am sorry that I had ever spent a penny in that place.  You can get just as good, if not better food, at other Italian restaurants, and without being insulted.",0.9512,0.826,0.105,0.069,0.5057884748102139

However, after hearing raves from friends on how it is one of their favorite Italian restaurants, I did expect more from the food.  I ordered the mafaldina verde al pollo e carciofe. The dish was definitely more like chicken with a little pasta and artichokes. The chunks of chicken were overwhelmingly large and you had to look hard to find the pasta in the dish. The pieces of chicken were also way too large, like 3 bites worth instead of bite size pieces, so it became much more involved to eat, like you needed your knife for every piece. Maybe that sounds silly, but I wanted pasta that I could grab a little chicken and artichoke with in every bite! Instead it was a bowl full of chicken. The portions are so large we all took doggy bags home and we didn't stay for dessert.  Everyone else loved their dishes - so maybe I'll have to give it another try. On Thursdays they have a deal for 2 people for $50 that seemed pretty good, so maybe we'll come back on a Thursday and give it another chance.

2009-04-02,4.0,"Ahhh lovely, lovely Rose Angelis!!! When I lived in the neighborhood, I'd visit and mangia at least once a week in your comfy and adorable confines. These days I'm no longer a Lincoln Parker, but still find myself dreaming often of your Tortellone Anatra Ubriaco - translation: absolutely fabulous duck filled tortellone with fresh tomato, mozzarella and shaved parmesan floating delicately in a boozy frenzy of the bold and beautiful wine and cognac reduction.  Orgasmic duck, duck, pasta aside... Rose Angelis serves up plenty more tasty, rustic fare in this off-the-beaten-path charming, comfortable setting. Set long and narrow in what almost appears to be an old living space, you'll find this to be a excellent and really versatile spot for making an impression... family dinners, first dates, special occasions, it just works here. Not fancy, but definitely muted and charismatic enough to be a really pleasurable experience.  Funny Carol K. mentions their penchant for pine nuts... it's so true!! Rose Angelis is nutty for the SS Pine Nut (ahoy!)... so yeah, I hope you like 'em! If not, just ask for them to be removed but here's a little taste of what you can look forward to, the ""Brett favs"" if you will...  I. Mezzalune al burro- spinach pasta half moons stuffed with ricotta and pesto served in a seasoned brown butter sauce with sundried tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and parmagiana // To Die For! Really! Creamy, cheesy, decadent, filling... everything a true pasta dinner should be, and more!  II. Zuppa di Pesce- fresh fish, mussels, shrimp, calamari and scallops simmered in a spicy tomato broth with polenta and farfalle // Ask for it extra spicy, I always do... Mmm the spicy is so sweeet, ya know? Let the sweat build up and bead on your brow; there's nothing like eating an Italian meal like a sweaty Goomba, with food like this you should, at minimum, look the part.  III. Gnocchi con Prosciutto e Albiococca Secca- potato pasta served in a mascarpone cream sauce with dried apricots, prosciutto, scallions and walnuts. // Mama Mia! Little pillows of love... like soft, zaftig Double D's... you know you wanna put your head up on 'em. Or shove 'em in your mouth. Nasty Girl! The perfect balance of tangy and sweet, just like someone else I know.  If that hasn't whet your appetite enough, you may want to scan their website for the recent addition of a weekday lunch menu and evening ""recession relief"" specials. Items like surf and turf ($12.94) or a full dinner for two including appetizer, entrée and dessert ($49) are a few of the tasty perks... looks like (good) sex on a plate just got cheap. Holla!  A word to the wise: Rose Angelis only takes reservations for parties larger than 8, and even then you're not guaranteed you won't be lingering in the bar for a bit prior to being seated.

We started with the sauteed ravioli with Gorgonzola and pesto dip.  This would not be my first recommendation for an app...it was simply sauteed cheese ravioli with nothing extra and an overpowering Gorgonzola dip.  Too much strong cheese for me thanks.  Our friends got the calamari which I found to be tremendous!  Well spiced with a huge portion.  The caesar salads that followed were standard...no points won or lost. The entrees were what secured 4 stars in my heart.  We actually both ordered tortellone (what they call tortellini) dishes.  First was the tortellone stuffed with porcini mushrooms and marscapone (I believe) served in a red wine cream reduction along with baby broccoli, portabella mushroom strips and dried cranberries.  These tortellone were something else.  There were multiple layers of flavor and they were all delicious.  Second we had the tortellone stuffed with duck and served in a sweet sundried tomato sauce.  I may have actually preferred the second tortellone because at points I became overwhelmed with the first.  Either way, both were phenomenal.  Alright enough about the food... The service was only ok.  Our waitress was serviceable but I'm hoping she's only waitressing because of the economy.  It is not her calling.   Our water glasses were always filled and the food came out hot, but our waitress was not awesome.   Rose Angelis is a very versatile spot for dinner.  It would work well for a date, even a first date, a family dinner, a birthday or whatever else.",0.9688,0.862,0.111,0.027,0.4954887218045113

It's not just that everything I have ever had here is delicious, it also has great service, it's a great bargain, and just a cute little place. I've tried at least 2/3 of the menu.

The special of the season [weekends excluded] was dinner for two for only $49!!! It included one appetizer, two Caesar salads, two entrees, and a shared desert. This is a phenomenal deal considering you can order your choice from the categories. We got a roasted veggie pizza appetizer that could have been enough for dinner. Absolutely delicious! For my entree it was three breasts of chicken cut thin and stuffed with risotto, veggies and cheese. Plenty of deliciousness to go around. My wife got the grilled salmon and grilled veggies. Can't go wrong with salmon. Our desert was the RICE PUDDING. Made with risotto and swimming in a vanilla sauce. This is, by FAAAAR, the best rice pudding I have ever had and I consider myself a rice pudding aficionado. It was enough for about four or five people. We also got the bread pudding, which they said they were famous for but I beg to differ on this. I am also a bread pudding aficionado and this one sucked butt. It had a caramel sauce which was delicious but the bread pudding was a little bitter and off. Again there was enough for 5 people. The wine list is extensive by the bottle and the per glass selections are very well picked out and affordable at about $6 each. We could have split an entree and desert and been stuffed with no doggy bag. The bread and oil was warm and tasty. Expect a long wait during prime times and weekends.

Every year I get the salad from the specials menu. This salad is big enough for two and it something you wont get anywhere else. It is huge, with full pieces of cucumber, carrot and beet. The dressing is a Cesar type that has a nice bite. Once you figure out out to eat it, it is very good.  I have had the half moons with brown butter sauce and have also tried the salmon ravolini. Both are rich and delicious. Also, enough to share if you would like. The basil cream sauce for the salmon dish really complimented the fish well.   Also the bread and olive oil they serve before your meal is very good (but dont fill up on it!)

He was more than happy to provide his recommendations on his favorites and what he think you would like based on inputs you give him. My husband and I both told him what we typically liked, and he was very assertive in giving us each personalized recommendations...the ""Ravioli alla Luigi"" for me...and one of the ravioli specials stuffed with pears for my husband. The food melted in your mouth...it was that good. We also ordered one of the salads, which was more than enough to share.  When our waiter asked us for desserts, we were too stuffed to order anything...even though we did let him go through the options.  When we thought he was coming back to give us the bill, instead he presented us with one of the desserts on the house!  He said he loved the strawberries with caramel sauce dessert so much and felt like we should try it.  Wow, that's service.

On my first visit I ate so much, I almost rolled out the door! Luckily, my friends and I lived nearby and we walked it off. A true sign that this place is delicious (or that I cannot stop myself from devouring the food). Since then I make it a point to head back to the cozy house-like atmosphere and enjoy the fantastic Italian cuisine. Dining here is like no other Italian place in Chicago. The server, Brian, that waited on my friends and I time and again has always been excellent! Rose Angelis can be romantic if that's your aim, or just a good place to enjoy great food and wine with friends and family.  On to the food! I love eggplant and beefsteak tomatoes, so these lovely apps were pleasing - Melanzane miniature alla parmigiana -  slices of baby eggplant baked with tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella and the Insalata di Caprese- fresh mozzarella and tomato slices topped with basil and drizzled with olive oil.  Without fail, I usually end up ordering my absolute favorite dish, Tortellone con salsa di noce - gorgonzola filled tortellone tossed with grapes in a walnut pesto cream sauce. I love the combination of the salty pesto cream sauce and the sweetness of the grapes. This dish is what does me in, but I somehow manage to squeeze in some of their amazing Trio of Chocolate Mousse in raspberry sauce and end it all with a cappucino!!

For appetizers, I really enjoy the bruschetta and the ""special"" whole wheat pizza.  The vegetable laden pizza had a very tasty wheat crust that added to, rather than detracted from the pizza.  In addition, I highly recommend the minestrone soup.  I am not even a big fan of minestrone soup but it will definitely be the appetizer I order the next time I visit the restaurant.  The grilled calamari steaks sauted with spinach and onions in a spicy balsamic sauce with toast points is solid and the sauce really makes this dish.     The menu is heavy on pasta but the chicken marsala and fish specials are very good also.  On the innovative side, the duck filled tortellini is one of those rare ""must try"" entrees on a menu that immediately catches your eye.  The wine and cognac reduction sauce is a good accompaniment to the flavors of the duck and the spinach, mozzarella, and tomato that are layered throughout the dish.  Rose Angelis specializes in different types of ravioli's.  I have been particularly impressed with the salmon filled ravioli and the ever changing special ravioli.  On other occasions, I have enjoyed the pumpkin filled ravioli and the cherry, walnut and portobella mushroom ravioli.  The linguini al frutti di mare features fresh linguini served in a tomato white wine sauce with mussels, shrimp, calamari and scallop garnished with parmagiana cheese.  It is one of the best renditions of this dish I have had as the home-made pasta is outstanding. On the down side, I wasn't blown away by the asparagus wrapped in prosciutto appetizer and thought the huge portion of lasagna was awfully cheesy, but lacking in taste.  The appetizer salad for the table was nothing special. For dessert, the bread pudding with caramel sauce is enough for 3-4 people and is one of my favorite deserts in Chicago.  The strawberries in caramel and the chocolate mousse assortment are also very good. The service is excellent and the servers here are ripe with suggestions.  Most of the servers have a ""flavorful"" persona that suits the environment of the restaurant.  This is not a formal atmosphere and this comes through in the personalities of the servers. On my last visit, we had 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and a dessert for 81$ plus tax and tip.  We had 5 people eating but did a lot of sharing because the portions are so large and we still left with a take home bag.  We only had 2 drinks total so that helped keep the price low.  I don't think you will find many other restaurants in Chicago that give you large quantities of good food at such great prices.",0.9983,0.834,0.16,0.007,0.5337698412698413

I can never find something I really think sounds great. I did have the fish special the last time i was here, its OK. My main beef with this place is lack of reservations. That makes coming here on any night a crap shoot on being able to eat within 2 hours and honestly I don't have time to sit around in the too-small waiting room and then wait more for dinner to arrive.  I came here recently on a Wednesday night when it was pouring outside- you would expect a short wait? Nope, half the restuarant (the front part) was closed which meant a 30 minute wait. Unaccaptable in my book for a WEDNESDAY night. Plus finding a cab can be difficult. La Escarola beats this place by a mile.",-0.8474,0.798,0.077,0.125,0.4232142857142857
2008-04-20,3.0,"Page and I went here last night around 8:30.  There was an 1.5 wait, but they had a nice outside area that was covered with a tent and we were told it was heated.  I do not think they actually had the heat on, but die to the nice night is was quite comfortable.  We ordered a bottle of wine and the Panzerotti Con Pesto E Gorgonzola (sauted cheese ravioli served with a pesto gorgonzola dipping sauce).  The ravioli was cover, and I mean covered, in parmigiana cheese to the point that it made the dish extremely dry.  The flavor was nice, but the same effect could have been achieved with a small amount of shave sharp parmigiana.   For the main course we ordered the Mafaldina Verde Al Pollo E Carciofi (spinach ribbon noodle tossed with grilled chicken and artichoke hearts in tomato sauce topped with toasted pine nuts and parmigiana) and the Gnocchi Con Prosciutto E Albiococca Secca (potato pasta served in a mascarpone cream sauce with dried apricots, prosciutto, scallions and walnuts).  Both of the meals were flavorful, but neither was a to die for dish.  The Mafaldina tasted mostly like the tomato sauce and the creme sauce for the Gnocchi tasted mostly like scallions.  I would have like to have seen less scallions, more apricots and more walnuts.  I think this would have helped make the dish stand out a bit more.  Don't get me wrong, we both had left overs for lunch today.  This brings me to my next point.  The portions were huge, and I don't see that as a good thing.  Mine was at least three times the size it needed to be. Lastly, we ordered the Tiramisu for dessert.  Don't.  The top layer of mascarpone cheese was good.  The bottom layer of lady fingers was good.  The two layers in between were chocolate cake and chocolate pudding.  Please, if you are trying to find the world's best Tiramisu, skip this one.  It will just depress you.",0.9867,0.804,0.142,0.054,0.48270202020202024

Other pluses:  I have always had the most sincere, helpful and accommodating wait staff, good affordable wine selection (not byob, but nothing in life is perfect), and charming atmosphere.    Minuses: The wait can be ridiculous.  Not quite as bad in the summer because of the outdoor space but I tried going this weekend at 6:45, figuring if we got there early enough we wouldn't have to wait more than 45 min to an hour.  Wrong!  Over two hours we were told.  And it was only 2 degrees outside!  We thought it would be cold enough that everyone would be ordering take out but I guess we weren't the only ones who wanted some hearty Italian comfort food.",0.9174,0.803,0.13,0.066,0.602979902979903

That said, the food here is outstanding, and almost makes the insane wait worthwhile.  Everything that was ordered was fantastic - from the special ""white"" manicotti with salmon, to the eggplant parm, to the lasagna, to the duck tortelloni.  Portions are massive, especially given the very reasonable prices, so don't be afraid to share. Our server, despite being extremely overworked, was pleasant and attentive (with the exception of the 20 or so minute wait for her to arrive with the check - it appears that Rose Angelis has adopted European custom in that regard).

The salad was drrrrrrrenched in dressing, & a creamy balsamic (which I don't mind) but it lacked the punchy balsamic flavor & was really bland. 3. The tortellone in my ""tortellone con salsa di noce"" was not al dente, but hard, typical of frozen pasta. It was also much too heavy to enjoy beyond three (literally) bites. The gorgonzola cheese filling, whole walnuts, & cream sauce (while it sounded delicious!) was just an overload, & for the stomach, not the senses. Much too heavy.

We tried the salad which was enough for 4 of us to share with large spears of cucumber, etc.  We also had an appetizer pizza del giorno which had a thin crunchy crust and lots of parmesan cheese and several featured vegetables. To the main courses, we had the Manicotti special, the Rigatoni special and one huge piece of lasagna that could have come right off Garfield's Christmas Special.  They did not cook this in an ordinary lasagna pan that's for sure.  The pine nuts contained within the cheese meshed flavors well.  The rigatoni came in a wonderful lemon cream sauce that lightened up the cream and balanced the lamb sausage.  The manicotti was stuffed with a mixture of cheese but the gorgonzola gave it a nice kick.  After that surprisingly we were still up for dessert and the chocolate ice cream with bananas and raspberries and a slice of cheesecake were the selections before we left satisfied.

I really don't understand the people who are complaining about this place, but it seems based on one dish that they weren't crazy about. I say, try another!

I have seen it before and never even knew from the looks of it that it was a restaurant -- it looks like a wine boutique!  It's cute and cozy, and you truly feel like you are a guest in someone's home when you walk in. I ordered dish that was on special -- it was a shrimp-filled ravioli with some kind of glorious sauce, and it was absolutely amazing! Everyone at the table raved about it. My boyfriend, however, ordered a spinach ribbon noodle dish, and I have to say, that was disappointing. The sauce not only tasted like jarred sauce, it tasted like a sub par brand, like Ragu. But, the portion was so huge that he helped me with my dish. Service was flawless, and prices are incredibly reasonable.

The bread was curiously delicious for some reason. I can't explain it, just a fantastic italian bread.  The server was a little bored/tired looking, but was polite enough and the apps and food arrived extremely quickly.   About half the food seemed to have some kind of fruit in it, which I think is a pretty cool (as someone else here used the word) innovation.  I got some gnocchi with apricots in it, and my wife a ravioli with pears.  And there were salads with apples, and other pastas with grapes.  They were great meals.  My only beef with the menu, was that I couldn't get a chicken parmigiana, but they had eggplant parmigiana.  And they seemed to have more cream based pasta than marinara based pastas.   But what we got we loved.   The desert menu looked great, but we were too stuffed.  We will come back here soon and get something from it.   A funny thing that happened here, that has no bearing on a review was this:  The patio has like maybe a dozen tables.  And most of them are situated for 4 people to dine at.  But when I say table, it's really 2 smaller tables butted up next to each other with 4 chairs.  My wife and I were at one, and we put our sweatshirts and her purse on the extra seats/table.   So this couple comes into the patio and sits in this waiting area back there.  There's some benches there to just hang out and have wine and even eat an appetizer.  But they were loaded (drunk).  His face was bright red and looked belligerent.   At some point, after they've been waiting for like 10 minutes for a table, he mosies over to another couple's table and yells back at his girlfriend that they can eat here.  RIGHT NEXT TO THE OTHER COUPLE in their extra seats.  Like elbow to elbow if they were to have sat down.  Didn't even ask the couple or the wait staff.  He's just planning on budging into these strangers meal. (The proximity would be the same as someone just joining you in a booth at a restaurant and just sitting down next to you and trying to share your table, and not even asking).  The girlfriend gets him to come back, because she seems to still have some of her cognitive ability.   Well the couple that was dining in this story finished their meal and left about 15 minutes later.  The drunk couple then proceeds to just walk up to the now empty table and just sits down.  Meanwhile there are like 3 other parties still ahead of them in line waiting to eat outside.  And the drunk couple start chatting with each other, but at a volume I'd only expect of a hyperactive 3 year old.  The host of the restaurant had to come up to them and ask them to return to the waiting area because people were waiting to dine here.  The host handled extremely well, and the drunk couple peacefully moved to where they were supposed to be.   But OMG, I've never seen someone try to pull a stunt like that.  It was pretty hilarious though.",0.998,0.829,0.142,0.029,0.47288794124615013

They don't take reservations, and are generally pretty busy, so come for an early dinner or late dinner 2. The service was great! Polite, quick, efficient.  3. The food variety was good and they did ""innovation"" not in an eclectic way, rather in an interesting way - what I mean is their ""creativity"" wasn't overwhelming.  4. We told the server we were vegetarian, and ordered the spinach ribbon noodles in arrabiata sauce. 5. We got our dish with chicken in it - but once we told them about it, the server apologized profusely - I think their training is great! It's not so much about making the mistake, it's taking the right steps to make up for it.  6. The portions are HUGE, so even though the 2 of us just shared one pasta, we had enough left to feed a 3rd person, so brought back lots home! 7. We then got the double chocolate icecream (the day's special) with caramel sauce and nuts/bananas/raspberries --- MMMMM... It was really good for the first few bites, heavenly, but then the sugar became too much. So make sure you're sharing dessert with lots of people, because again, they're huge!! 8.

Incredible! It's an all-white lasagna, with scallops, shrimp and crab in a creamy sauce. The leftovers were even better the next day!

What an academic thing to say as I start off why I love this place. Rose Angelis is not Italian-American food and they do not at all specialize in Italian-American dishes, but they are incredibly delicious regional Italian food. Their food seems to be of the Northern coast variety, and even more specifically of the Emilia-Romagna style with their love of (and exceptional quality) ravioli, half-moons, and maybe a little of Tuscany with their love of simplicity and pine nuts/olive oil everywhere. I love it. This is the square stuff that I miss from home because the vast majority of Italian places in Chicago seem to specialize in Americanized Southern Italian food with overdone red sauces and bricks of soft cheese everywhere ( ::cough, cough:: deep dish pizza).  Stick with anything with seafood or a basic design, and you're golden. The spinach half-moons with a brown butter sauce are amazing. I replicated that once at home, and people were stunned by how delicious and simple it is.  Also strongly recommended: Gorgonzola Tortellini Duck Tortellini - it's difficult for me not to order this every time Gnocchi with Prosciutto and Apricots - the sweet and salty in perfect balance and compliment I strongly recommend against the Vesuvio and Marsala... you don't go to a really great Chinese place just to order Cashew Chicken or an awesome German place to get a hot-dog.

This homey Italian restaurant serves up hearty Italian goodies like duck-filled tortellone, cheese and pine nut lasagna and rotini in a spicy putanesca sauce. There are inventive pairings, like gnocchi with walnuts and apricots in a mascarpone sauce, and very traditional ones, like ravioli in a tomato cream sauce. But no matter what you order, you can sure of two things -- the food will be good, and you will have leftovers that last for days. I walked out of there with 2 1/2 lbs. of lasagna and bread pudding. Seriously. That's a lot of food for not a lot of money. This is really great place to go with a group of friends or with your significant other. However, we were in the back room, and it was LOUD. Our party of six couldn't hear anyone who wasn't to their immediate right or left. So I'd be cautious about bringing someone here on a first date, or choosing this as the place to take your out-of-town friend who you haven't seen in ages -- it's not conducive to conversation. I suppose you could wait for a table to open up in one of the smaller rooms, but since you'll probably have already waited at least a half-hour to get the first available table (we waited 45 minutes on a Friday night at 7 pm), that might not be reasonable.  The only other drawback is that our service was a bit slow. The place was packed and our server had a lot of tables, so we had considerable waits between ordering our drinks and our appetizers, and again after we finished our meal and were waiting for the check. The restaurant had cleared out by that point, so we were happy to sit and chat while we waited, but the lag could be a problem for anyone who is a stickler about prompt, attentive service.

For dessert, we split the bread pudding (absolutely the best I have had and brought my review up from 2 stars) strawberries dipped in caramel and some type of chocolate decadence cake.  All were delicious!   As for the service, the waiter was helpful, but what I found annoying, as did other members of my group, was that the busboy in his efforts to keep the table clean, kept bumping into us!  I must have been elbowed twice and once when he slipped between my friend and I to grab something, I ended up with his belly in my face!  Not a good experience when you are eating, I might add!   They have a nice wine list- but one of my pet peeves is drinking wine out of tumblers.  I suppose it is for effect (you know, little Italian country inn feeling) but I still don't like it. The bar upfront was small and friendly, just right for this place.  The decor is simple -giving Rose Angelis a comfort-ability factor that is hard to beat.   Street parking is usually difficult in this part of the city.  My suggestion is to try the street immediately to the east of the restaurant (the one with the railroad track running through it).  You can usually find a spot along there. All in all, since my fellow Yelpers have had such great experiences at this place- I will give it another shot but I must say I expected more.  Maybe it really shines in the Summer months!",0.9981,0.752,0.202,0.046,0.5670265780730896

Last night we went for a quiet pre-NYE date night (our NYE is proving to be quite the spectacle & as a result, the bf made it up to me last night). We did not wait to be seated, which was great - we must've arrived at just the right time.  However, we did wait for just about everything else.  & wait.  & wait.  Which is the only reason I'm not giving this restaurant 5 stars (well, that & the tables in the back are awfully close, which made it difficult to have an intimate conversation). The bread was yummy & the herb olive oil was delicious, although I saw another table was given fresh parmesan to add to the oil.  I would have liked that, but I was not offered the option. We didn't order appetizers because we couldn't agree on one item.  I was fiending for the eggplant, but the bf wasn't willing to try something new, so I didn't force it.  :) We decided to order the two dishes we both were interested in (that in itself is a feat ... getting the two of us to agree on not one but TWO count 'em TWO dishes!), which were the manicotti special (delicious) & the Ravioli con Luigi. Oh good Lord.  The Ravioli con Luigi.  The sauce was amazing.  The toasted pine nuts really gave it an extra kick of flavor that was most welcome.  Even the carnivore bf loved it. I'm hoping to eat the leftovers today to see how well they keep --- & you will have leftovers --- the portions are ginormous. Since we were celebrating, we decided that even though we didn't finish our pasta, we woudl order dessert.  How glad am I that we did? The strawberries served in cold caramel sauce, drizzled with white & dark chocolate were HEAVENLY.  I seriously could've licked the plate clean had I not had a miniscule of self-control.  Comments were made about how fun the dessert would be if we took it ""to-go,"" but not too loudly because we didn't want to make things uncomfortable for the family next to us (see: too close tables). Our wine (Chardonnay) was good, nothing to write home about, but then again, I'm no wine guru. Our waitress was pleasant & helpful, & I'm sure that had it not been so busy, we would have received faster service (& not taken 2.5 hours to eat bread, not even half our order of pasta, & a few strawberries). Overall, I am anxious to get back here to try their other pastas & the bf commented that he'd like to bring his folks when they are in town next month (which surprised the hell outta me as he is an Italian food snob).

Service was great, we felt welcomed from the moment we stepped in to the moment we left.  Definitely have to agree with others who mentioned that the restaurant is humongous, especially since the front room can be a bit deceiving.  An ok restaurant but definitely not one I will go out of my way to dine at as there are better Italian restaurants in the city.",0.9892,0.753,0.192,0.055,0.5033333333333334
