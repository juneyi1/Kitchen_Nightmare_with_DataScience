2007-07-02,4.0,"ZK is a clean, airy restaurant, which serves tons of comfort food. Â I had a tuna fish sandwich on marble rye and finished my meal off with a red velvet cupcake topped with vanilla buttercream frosting. My god, if I go back for anything, it will be for that cupcake. It's to die for. I recommend ZK to anybody looking for decent comfort food. I spent under $10.00 without tip.",0.7506,0.779,0.168,0.053,0.29333333333333333
