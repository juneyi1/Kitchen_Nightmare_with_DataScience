2012-10-26,4.0,Just visited this place recently based in a high recommendation of a good friend. Sure enough he was right. The sushi here is incredible.  I ordered about three to four appetizers and each time it was fantastic. All different flavors and satisfying.  Enjoyed some good sake and the space had a great vibe. I'll check this place out again.  One of the better sushi restaurants I've visited! Update !!!  This was in my drafts and I never completed it.  I sent a friend to this place for his first date.  I was later informed it was closed for undisclosed reasons.  Sorry guys!  Especially you Ross.  Whoops!,0.9852,0.72,0.269,0.011,0.6156808688387636

The first time there I found it hard to find, as it seemed to be hidden away The decor inside is very pretty with pinks and greens and cool lampshades overhead. The staff are all pretty nice too. The sushi is pretty amazing to be honest. My favourite has to be the Unagi tempura and avocado, it's so delicious I could order a few of them and feel as though I will never get enough. Another favourite is the Crunchy Melt, with shrimp tempura, spicy mayo and melted mozzeralla cheese. This was my first time to try melted cheese on my sushi but it didn't disappoint. I read a recommendation on their Smoky Bear, people saying that they would be dreaming of it for nights to come.... Yes it was good - smoked salmon and cream cheese, but I think the Unagi Tempura just blew me away so much that I forgot about it that night!  I can't get enough of this place, I would eat there every week if I could, probably shouldn't. $3 beers aren't to be sneezed at either!

I usually can eat about half a bowl in about 6 minutes but with this I finally just gave up after a while since it didn't seem worth it.

All this for only $19? Boy was I a happy camper. Dessert time: they didn't have my favorite dessert that night; creme brulee :( but they did have this amazing double layer chocolate mousse cake garnished with an excellent preparation of sliced strawberries drizzled with strawberry syrup, it was so indulgent.  And my friend ordered a very refreshing mango passion fruit sorbet covered with white chocolate.

Both times, they accepted the groupon with no problem and the service has been excellent. I noticed a lot of sushi restaurants tend to have some issues when it comes to groupons, which is annoying because they are the ones who decide to use the service themselves.  Either way, the sushi here is so good and so FRESH. I had the sushi combo both times - it comes with the rainbow roll and 6 pieces of nigiri. Excellent choice for a little variety and for the price.  The restaurant is huge - I would honestly have this place in mind for a large party. It's spacious and the decor is unique. It is kind of dark inside, but they have a lot of very colorful art throughout, so it brightens the place up.

I'm walked to my table by her on the phone she drops the menu's on the table and walks off. No ""enjoy your meal"" or "" your server will be right with you "". Well, the server was not right with us but the bus boy was to bring us our water....15 mins later , there's our server. just to paint the picture there was only 6-7 tables sat and another waitress present. Not much of a reason to wait so long. I was using a groupon so she asked to see it on my phone and walked away to show the manager and was gone for 15 mins with my phone. I walked up to the manager to ask her for my phone and her reply was "" I don't have it, go ask your server"" I had flames in my eyes.

2012-03-13,1.0,"So, I order sushi via delivery.   They forget half my order.   The delivery guy is too busy on the cell phone the first time to ring my doorbell, so he's just standing outside waiting for me to notice him.  What the heck?   So then I tried to pay him and get my bag o'sushi from him and am so distracted by the fact that he remained on his cell phone the whole time that I didn't check inside the bag (silly me, I assumed they got my order right.)   So I look in the bag and it's not all there.   And $31 for all veggie sushi?? Really?   Anyhow, I had to call them back and let them know that my sushi was still there and not in my house or my stomach.   By the way, this extra sushi was required because they require a $25 order minimum - so I didn't even really need that much, but they required it....and then they forgot to put it in the darn bag.    The same delivery guy comes back and he sits by our door.  The door bell is right by his head and he doesn't ring it.   So I go outside and ask him why, when most delivery people automatically ring the door bell he didn't - twice.   He said ""No.  Nothing.""   His English was a not so good.   So I tried again.  Then he told me he had forgotten the receipt with our name on it.   That was the 2nd time he came by.  I reminded him that he brought it with him the first time, but he didn't give it to me because he was too busy on his cell phone.  So then he went back to his ""No. Nothing.""  response. Overpriced sushi and lame delivery.   Again.   This wasn't the first time.   Lesson learned.

At first glance this restaurant in the corner of a strip mall seems sketchy but inside it is gorgeous and quite large.  I like that the tables aren't on top of each other like some sushi places. We started with the bacon wrapped scallop cake - not exactly what I was expecting but it was tasty.  I think the cake at the end should have tipped me off but for some reason I was thinking it would be a scallop wrapped in bacon - not exactly.  The scallop is minced with crab and peppers then wrapped in bacon.  Good but not necessarily a winner for me. Sushi: -Hotate Unagi Roll - oh so good - any roll that puts a scallop on top is a winner for me - by far the best in my opinion.  It was a lot to shove in your mouth but the scallop and roll combo is fantastic. -Crunchy Melt Roll - if you like cheese you will love this roll - cream cheese on the inside and mozz cheese on the outside - but it worked with the tempura.  My dining partners fav. -Blue Ocean Roll - I found this roll to be okay but I felt it was lacking something.  It wasn't bad but I probably wouldn't order it again.

We walked into the entrance, in which there was a mini-wine shop.  I found out that they sell the bottles of wine that are featured on the wine list.  How brilliant is that?!? The dining room is decked out in bright pink (not too obnoxious) and lime green and there is a wishing tree on drawn on one of the walls. We decided to start with an order of edamame and seaweed salad.  Both were very fresh, seasoned well, and bountiful.  We wanted to make sure to pace ourselves before the sushi arrived.  As for the sushi, we enjoyed a Philadelphia roll, a Heat roll, and Midori maki (vegetarian).  The fish rolls were extremely fresh and stuffed with yummy goodness.  I could not stop eating them!!  As for the veggie roll??!?  The best veggie roll I have ever encountered!  They tend to be bland at sushi joints (which is to be expected), but not here.  A little bit of crunch, blended with a little bit of chew, blended with a little bit of soft.  Such a perfect combination and will make any vegetarian be tickled pink!

The other 2 rolls we ordered were the Crunch roll and the Hotate Unagi, both of which were fantastic. I LOVE the crunch of the Crunch roll - tempura, crunchy asparagus, perfection - we even grabbed some of the tempura and dipped other rolls into it to make the others crunchy too. The Hotate Unagi comes with scallops on top of the roll...it's certainly a mouthful. I tried eating the scallop first and the roll second, but you don't quite get the full experience of the roll as when you eat it all together.  Either way, these rolls were an awesome combination. Our waitress was wonderful in terms of giving us suggestions about what to order - we were very, very happy with what she recommended! I do have a feeling, however, that whatever we ordered at that place would have been awesome.  My only complaint about the restaurant is that it's not one regulated temperature in the whole place. Walk to the bathroom under a blasting shower of hot air in one spot, then sit and let your feet freeze at your table.

We trekked up north to Blue Ocean Saturday night with a 7PM reservation. Yelpers left me a bit confused about the BYOB policy, but after calling and confirming, they have a full bar but allow bottles of wine with a $5 corkage fee. Forget your wine at home? No worries, there is literally a wall full of purchasable bottles at your arrival. We started with the calamari appetizer...very delicious and gone in a minute. Nothing incredibly special about this. Like fried calamari? Go for it. We finally tracked down the infamous fire roll, under sushi appetizers... the Dragon Fire. Duh, of course we're getting that. That came out shortly after we were finished with the calamari. Disappointingly it was only 5 pieces of sushi and the sushi itself wasn't on fire, but it was fun to have some flames in the middle of the plate and make a wish (as the server recommended) when we blew it out. Our ""meal"" sushis consisted of the Smoky Bear and the Citrus Rainbow. We usually get three or four rolls, and due to the price of these, we couldn't justify ordering more. Both rolls were very delicious, but I definitely left wanting more. Overall, our meal was just under $60 for an appetizer and three rolls. Not too bad, but definitely on the pricier end.

2012-01-04,4.0,"Tonight we were able to check Blue Ocean off of our ever-growing list of Groupons (my husband is an addict, I swear).  This place was extremely hip.  When I was escorted into the restaurant, I fell in love with the huge curved booths in the front.  We didn't get to sit there--there were only two of us--but one day!   I don't eat fish or red meat, and I generally don't like vegetarian sushi because I detest seaweed and mushrooms.  The remaining items were few.  I ordered the house salad and the chicken and vegetable tempura.  My husband ordered the White Zen and Octo half rolls.  My salad came out first.  The creamy sesame dressing was bathe-in-it awesome.  It had greens and shredded carrots and grape tomato halves and mandarin orange segments.  Really, though, they were just a vehicle for the delicious dressingy goodness.  The tempura was luke warm, but it tasted very fresh and there was a lot more of it than I anticipated.  There was one wonky bit of chicken, but I lived to tell about it.  The sushi rolls were small but, I am assured, delectable.   Our server was nice, but seemed very shy and to have a fairly tenuous grasp of the English language (the two things may be related).  Less our Groupon, our meal came to $4 and change plus tip.",0.9722,0.858,0.123,0.019,0.5318452380952381
2011-12-29,5.0,"So absurdly delicious!  Ordinarily, I am a little particular about my sushi. I was never a big fan of special rolls - just give me a hundred pieces of sake (salmon) nigiri and I am a happy camper. I don't want the roll to be baked, or have cilantro and mango sauce on it. I just wanted expertly seasoned rice paired with fatty, marbled pieces of fish. Delicious. Until Blue Ocean rudely butts into my life and ruins everything. I came in with a Groupon to burn and seriously think it was one of the best online coupon purchases I have ever made. How else would I have ended up here? The decor is very swanky sushi lounge, but I didn't mind. The paintings on the wall were pretty and the place wasn't too busy. There is free parking in the lot outside. So far, things are going well. Our server, Bo Bae, was such a darling. Really terrific and attentive service with a smile. She kept our waters filled, brought our cocktails and teas and soups, cleared our dirty dishes... simply perfect. As for the food, there was one dish that I had 2-3 weeks ago that I haven't been able to stop thinking about since. So much so in fact, that I made reservations to have NYE dinner here. THAT good. Of course, I'm talking about the Hotate Unagi sushi - a roll (surprise, surprise!) of unagi tempura, mayo, black tobiko, and unagi sauce...each piece of the roll, being a bed for a divine half scallop on top. This dish has turned me into a sushi roll eating fiend. It made my eyes roll around in my head (much like that of a Great White shark feasting). There is crunch, there is a hint of sweet, there is salty, there is creamy, there is a huge piece of scallop on each bite. Perfection. Don't stop there of course. I sampled several other items. The Smoky Bear roll (seared smoked salmon/salmon tempura/cream cheese/unagi sauce) was also delightful. They also served up excellent versions of the Spicy Scallop and Rainbow rolls. The best part? Many of these rolls are half rolls, so you can have far more variety in your meal.  Start with the pear martini and battered mushrooms stuffed with snow crab meat, then prepare to gorge on some incredible sushi rolls. I have been converted and am completely smitten with Blue Ocean.

Our server, who was very sweet and very apologetic, kept blaming the kitchen for the delays and kept mentioning that they were busy. Busy? I thought all restaurants were apt to handle busy times, like dinner service on Wednesday.  Overall, the food seemed delicious. Its hard to enjoy food that is scattered and not varied.

I've switched jobs and my new office is in Uptown, I used to be in the loop and had a lot of sushi options within walking distance.  I'd gone to Agami a few weeks before, but they didn't have lunch hours (though the dinner was fab). When I got to Blue Ocean, I was very impressed with the convenient location, easy parking, and the welcome.  I asked a few questions about the menu but the waitress did not seem to understand and did a lot of nodding and smiling. The answers to my questions did not fit the questions that I'd asked. I decided to play it safe with two rolls - yellowtail and scallion and a rainbow - and a side of unagi sauce. Lunch was $14 (a splurge for me, I usually bring lunch). I had errands in the next door walgreen's and staples and when I returned, the waitress brought my bag to the door. So far so GREAT. When I got back to my office, I noticed that they didn't put the unagi sauce in the bag and the rolls seemed to be a bit on the small side. The yellowtail and scallions was $6 so the small roll was about what I expected. However, the rainbow roll was only slightly bigger and, upon inspection, looked suspiciously like spicy tuna on the inside. I do not enjoy spicy food. By this time, I only had 15 minutes of my lunch hour left and I was completely starved, so I ate what they provided. The yellowtail & scallions was delish and I cried my way through the faux ""rainbow roll"".  I probably should be more upset with myself for not checking the bag.

Truly. And humongous. We did not order that much food and could not finish the salad. The spicy tuna roll  was good, but I felt it was heavy on the tuna. Boyfriend disagreed and said the tuna ratio was just fine, but even moreso was the seaweed great.  California roll was unique from any other CaliRoll I've ever had, but it was good.

Obviously the last two weeks of the Groupon gave them a bigger rush than they expected for a Monday night.  Our server, never got her name, was sweet, kind, and really tried her best, but she just had too many tables. She ran her butt off trying to balance the load, and her manager, in some kind of weird, over sized sweater dress, didn't help either of the servers at all, despite them having to literally run circles around that restaurant trying to give good service.  I liked the music they played, and the decor, but the AC was up too high and I froze my butt off.  The sushi was good. Very fresh fish, and we very much enjoyed all the rolls we ordered.

2011-10-09,3.0,"This is more like 3.5 stars because it was just an ""okay"" experience overall and I'm not "" I'm a fan"", according to Yelp's rating system. There were two of us and we had a GROUPON and it was our first time dining here. We made a reservation for a Saturday evening dinner. We were greeted and seated immediately after walking in. The restaurant is very SPACIOUS!  The decor was very modern but felt a little naked, maybe because it was so spacious...  Our server was very nice and she came and introduced herself as our server for the evening. We received our waters right away. We were given plenty of time to look over our menu and then we ordered a large bottle of Asahii to share. FOOD: We started with an order of Shrimp Tempura Appetizer to share. Very nicely fried!!! The tempura batter was just perfect! We shared a Spicy Tuna Roll, Unagi Roll, and the Sushi Combo (6 pieces of nigiri and a rainbow roll) Everything we ordered was very tasty. Overall: We have read the yelp reviews before dining here and we really went in with low expectations. Our server did ask us if we had a groupon to use for our meal but not until we were first ordering our drinks. Also, YES our rolls were skinnier than what I'm used to seeing and  especially the Unagi roll did almost fall apart several times. HOWEVER, our theory is that despite the overall size of the rolls, it's not that they are being cheap about the amount of fish that goes into each roll, or each piece of nigiri, but it's the amount of rice that they use in each roll that effects the size and the sturdiness of the rolls. Again, yes the rolls are smaller but they just have less rice than typical. In the end, you might want to end up ordering more, since you are not as full as you typically would be after just having 2-3 rolls of sushi. I know that there are plenty of people out there who actually do ask for less rice when ordering their rolls... for those people out there, this might be a good place for them. Lastly, my other theory on why they ask for the groupon is that they automatically put that in their computer system so that when they bring over our check, they have two receipts. One original bill without the discount and one bill with the applied discount. Also, my printer was broken so we just showed them our groupon number on my phone after we had received the bill. To be honest, I don't think that this restaurant is trying to skimp out on the Groupon users but it's just that they use less rice in their rolls. We probably wouldn't come back to dine here without some sort of discounted deals. Possibly for lunch specials and for some other daily  offers that they have. It was definitely worth it to try it with the $30 groupon.  The food was definitely tasty.",0.9942,0.878,0.107,0.015,0.4086267995570322

2011-09-12,4.0,"Hubby and I headed here on a Friday night with our groupon in tow. I had read about everyone else's experience with groupons, and I was expecting small rolls and not great service. I was pleasantly surprised. The place is hard to find. It's on Clark, just a little south of Leland on the west side of the street. It's in the right corner of a large condo complex on the ground floor. When I got there about 6:30, the free parking lot was full except for two spots. We walked in and were seated. The place itself looks trendy and I liked the decor. As expected, the first thing the waiter asked us is if we had a groupon. It bothered me a little that they wanted to know up front, but not much we could do. I saw the place had a full bar and wine list, so we asked out server about BYOB, since we had brought a bottle of wine. He said we could have it, but there was a $5 corkage fee. No problem there, as most of their drinks were at least $10 on special. Our server opened our bottle and filled our glasses. Any time he came by and our glasses were low, he filled them back up until the bottle was empty. We ordered an appetizer to start - the filet spring roll. It was really good and not like any other spring roll I've had. I did think it was a bit expensive for what you got - $11 for about six pieces. For dinner, we split four rolls - spicy tuna jalapeno, spicy scallop, smoky bear, and spicy tataki. The spicy rolls were very spicy, which I liked. However, it felt like the spicy-ness of the dish masked a lot of the fish flavor. Still, the rolls were very good. My favorite was the spicy tataki and I really liked their use of pico de gallo in a sushi roll. I was weary of portion size, based on other reviews, but I didn't notice my rolls to be any smaller than those of the tables around us, and I know none of those tables used a groupon. Overall though, the rolls are smaller than those from other nearby sushi joints. I did think the rolls came apart a lot easier than they should have, like they were made too quickly and not with care. Any time I dipped a roll in soy sauce, I could feel it start to break apart. Not typical. I will head back though. We have one groupon left, and I'm looking forward to trying other kinds of rolls.",0.8356,0.855,0.078,0.067,0.5125747508305648

Well... it's only after getting home that I read someone else's review who said that if you have a Groupon (which we did) you get way smaller portions. That person completely called it, because when we first sat down, they immediately asked if we had a coupon. Guess what, we still spent a LOT of money (more than we have spent at other sushi places without a 'discount'), and shorting people because they have a Groupon is no way to get future business, in fact it's guaranteeing you are not getting mine.

Last week we went in and when we sat down the FIRST thing they asked is if we were using a groupon, we said yes, that is fine but this is what we got.  We ordered a 9 piece of sushi and the pieces were just about an inch long, the table next to us ordered the same thing and their pieces were HUGE. When that table had sat down they stated they were not using a groupon. That was the first indication that there was something wrong. Just because we were using a groupon we were getting the less quality cuts.  The rolls were SO SMALL half the size as normal, and again next to us the same roll HUGE. the table to our right had the same issue, they were using a groupon and got the same service.  If you offer groupon then treat people with the same respect!!!!!!  We ordered over $40 in drinks and over $90 in sushi so it wasnt like we were not paying more then the groupon but on the flip side we shouldnt have to we bought a groupon!

Blue Ocean was the spot, and I will be back, we happened upon a couple specials under way, a half off appetizer and an all you can eat special...  In general all you can eat sushi has very much jumped the shark for me, it almost always tends to be too ricey and just sad, I don't like limitations when I eat, so as of late I go for the menu and leave the all you can eat deals for everyone else... Blue ocean some how allured us to dip our toes back into the all you can eat sushi pool, and it reminded me of all you can eat sushi of 15 to 20 years ago, before there was sushi on every corner and every spot offered some sort of obligatory all you can eat deal... The price was higher as it was 15 to 20 years ago, although at around $35 it was actually what I remembered paying all those years ago, which with the eroding dollar I think that's a deal...   This was anything but ricey, and the limitations were few! We had one creative dish after another, the fish was fresh and truly delightful, truth is, I don't need that much fish, so next time I may opt out of the all you can eat story, and if I do, I know this menu will keep me pleased, but having said that, this may be the only spot in Chicago I agree to all you can eat at again!  It was just that good!   Even better the dining room was huge and not crowded, the atmosphere was great, they really tried and it was obvious!

There was asparagus inside and they left the hard white ends of the asparagus (which should have been cut off) and were very difficult to chew. I had to spit them out which is never a fun thing to do in a restaurant. My partner had spicy tuna avacodo which was good and the miso soup was just ok.  The service was very slow in the beginning. It took the server 10 minutes to bring a drink because she said they ran out of watermelon juice. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and modern with complimentary colors of red and green accents and some cool design paintied along the wall. I wouldn't rush back to this restaurant but would give it another try and possibly try something new on the menu.

2011-08-20,2.0,"I made a late reservation for a Thurs night and am not sure if that had anything to do with our bland, boring experience or not.  I had a groupon which made this better overall to take but also added to part of the problems.  Upon being seated, we gave our Groupon to our waitress (May) as you're supposed to.  We ordered the Sake Sangria but found out they were all out and wouldn't be making any more for the day.  Really?  Disappointment #1.  We ordered beers instead, ordered food and soon were digging in.  I'll say the sushi was bland at best.  We ordered the Rainbow half roll, smoked salmon, reg salmon, California roll and sweet potato roll (the only saving grace).  Nothing tasted fresh and it all had the consistency of mush.  Our reservation was for 9pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm so don't know if the ingredients were lying around all day or what.  It didn't have much flavor at all (even the smoked items) and I had expected better considering all of the positive yelp reviews.  I was def disappointed.  Mind you, I'm by no means a sushi snob so this isn't me expecting perfection.  The food simply wasn't that good.  Disappointment #2    At about 9:40pm we were done with our sushi, most of which we didn't finish, and were told it was last call for alcohol.  Ok, not sure why that was but ok.  Is this a bar or a restaurant?  We ordered another round and talked and let our dinner settle.  While the waitress was taking away our used plates/utensils, we noticed that the background music had stopped playing.  We also noted that the waitress began removing all the items from our table except for our beers which we were still drinking.  They removed the bamboo centerpiece, all of the sauce containers, drink menu, etc.  REALLY?  I mean, this all but said you've eaten so now get the hell out.  I've been to a ton of restaurants that close early and the norm is that they stop seating at the closing hour (so in this case 10pm).  This place wanted to be CLOSED and empty by 10pm.  What the hell??!  I felt like we were being shoved out the door.  Disappointment #3 The last disappointment was when we got our bill.  I looked at the bill and noted that they didn't take off for our groupon.  I let our waitress know that (May) and she said she'd go and change it.  She then came back 10 mins later and said we would be charged full price for the specials she recommended we order earlier in the night.  Mind you, this was right after we presented her the groupon.  What?  Ok, I'm not a genius but if we're not allowed to get the specials pricing when using a groupon, why recommend the specials right after we hand you the groupon!  Incompetent is the only word to describe our wonderfully nice waitress.  Bless her in that she tried hard but apparently didn't have a clue.  We quietly and calmly asked her why she would recommend the specials if we weren't allowed the special prices.  Her response was to leave and say she would fix it.  Her way of fixing it was to get the manager.  The female manager comes up to our table and shows us the fine print on the groupon stating we weren't allowed the special prices.  She was rude, abrasive and seemed like she was ready for a full-on brawl about the pricing.  We weren't that upset by everything.  We simply wanted to know why the waitress would recommend something she knew we weren't eligible for.  Being told we could order the specials influenced our order.  We would have picked other items on the menu had we known the specials weren't an option.  Disappointment #4 So, all in all, save your money and go somewhere else.  Even with my other groupon, I won't go back here (yes, I bought two).  I bought two groupons in part because this place had such great reviews.  Looks like I'll be giving the other one away.... and not to close friends cuz I don't want them mad at me when they have a bad experience.  LOL!  Just kidding.  Maybe I just came on an off night but I doubt it.  Either way, take your dollars and appetite to Coast.  It's much better!",0.9458,0.75,0.133,0.117,0.49411896146970785

Midori Roll - Sweet potatoe roll, seemed dry and kind of bland.  Ocean Drive - this one was the best, except, where is the lime to squeeze on top? This roll calls for that.

2011-07-23,4.0,"When the appetizers come out and you take your first few bites and realize you want to cancel your sushi and just eat app's, you know you are in for a good meal! My friend & I were bargain shopping at all the wholesale shops on Clark and decided to pop in here for some sushi because it was a gorgeous summer night and they had an outdoor patio. And what a great sidewalk patio it is. It's on Leland right across from the park. So there's some foot traffic and activity going on in the park for good people watching, but it's off the busy thoroughfare of Clark so it's also quiet enough that you can enjoy your meal. We started off ordering a couple of appetizers because they had a deal on them (I'm pretty sure it was buy one, get one free). As I mentioned above, when they came out and we took those first bites, we were very impressed! The spring roll with tuna, daikon, avocado and a sweet but tangy mirin vinaigrette were awesome. One of the best spring rolls I think I've ever had. The different flavors paired really well together and made my taste buds happy. We also had seared salmon on greens with a citrus ginger sauce. I love ginger and that sauce was tip top. I would like to bottle it so I could have it at home. The salmon was cooked to perfect, you took a bit and the fish just disolved in your mouth. After the app's, I was very excited for the sushi. We ended up ordering: -philadelphia (boring, I know, but I'm a sucker for smoked salmon!) -white zen half roll (which, don't be fooled, this was still 5 or 6 pieces) - super white tuna over spicy tuna with a little crunch. Delicious, and not too spicy, which is good for this girl. - red dragon - which was tuna, soft shelled crab, cucumber, & avocado. Yummy, although the crab didn't add much for me. - sweet potato tempura - this is my new favorite roll to get at sushi joints. And it's a great end to your meal...you won't need desert! Overall I was impressed with the sushi. The fish was very fresh tasting and they had an interesting mix of ingredients in a lot of their rolls that set them apart from other tried and true places that tend to serve 90% of the same thing.  They also had a house specialty drink which was soooo good! It was a sake sangria and if it's still on the menu next time I go, I'm gettin a pitcher, for myself (what, don't judge, I can walk home!!).  Service was really good too. Being on the patio you never know if they'll be slow in getting outside but they weren't at all. Water refills were plentiful and our waitress was really on the ball.  I also checked out the inside when I went to use the bathroom, and it's really cool inside. It has a very hip vibe to it, kind of dark and clubby but with bright magenta all over the place to make it feel like a big ole party is going to happen later. I think it's managed to tap in to that casual, yet still trendy, atmosphere that places try for but don't always manage to pull off.

We ordered a filet mignon, and once it was brought to our table, it took 15 minutes to flag down (another) server to relay to our actual server that we needed a fork and knife. Yeah. Simple kindergarten stuff like that. These kind of annoying shenanigans went on throughout our entire time here. We also ordered the shitake mushrooms, Heat Roll, and Dragon Roll -- all three star worthy.  I hate it when places treat Groupon customers differently.

The hostess seemed confused when we arrived.  After we explained that we didn't have a reservation, she wisked us away to the bar and dropped us off without any word.  I returned to the host station to ask how long the wait is, what protocol is for getting on the list for a table, etc...  She said that we could eat at the bar or wait for a table.  Really? I had no idea those were my options. (Sarcasm)  Never did she ask for my name.  Meanwhile back at the bar, the bartender was just as little help.  We told her that we'd like to wait for a table and would only be having cocktails.  Her question in response, ""How many?""  How many what?, I thought to myself.  We ordered our drinks, and when she returned, she told my girlfriend, ""I think this one is pretty strong.  I hope you can handle it.""  I'm not adverse to a bartender having a sense of humor, but what I had a problem with is that they have a bartender on staff who is clueless about the strength of drinks she's making.   When we finally get seated, we didn't get water for at least 15 minutes.  The server arrived at last and immediately barreled into asking if we were ready to order.  No ""sorry for the wait.""  No ""would either of you like another drink?""  Nothing.  We ordered, and when the food arrived (30 minutes later) her food was there but my maki rolls would ""be a little while longer.""  Fifteen minutes later, my food arrived.  When we finished our meal, the check took another 15-20 minutes to arrive.   I consider myself a very low-maintenance diner. I don't expect much other than for you to bring my food to me hot (or fresh in the case of sushi).  But the service in this dining experience was so atrocious that I will never return.  I understand that the dining room was full, and it was a Friday night.  My suggestion to the Blue Ocean ownership:  hire servers who can handle it.",0.9048,0.84,0.093,0.067,0.5131720430107527

2011-04-30,5.0,"First off, I wanted to find out what ""contemporary sushi"" was. let me just say this, YUMMMMMMM. if you need the details, read on if you must.  Service: -Friday night, 9:45 p.m. and this place was packed. probably because of the recent groupon deal (as we were there for the same reason), we made reservations for 10pm but was seated before that that.  -Our waitress was nice and prompt. she seemed informed about some drinks on their menu. We received our food in a reasonable manner considering the crowd. Food & Drink: Peach Blossom (alcoholic drink) ($10) Cali Tempura ($14) Filet Mignon w/ salad ($16) Sushi and Sashimi Bento Box ($21) -Peach Blossom (drink)  My girlfriend had this and it smelled and tasted as nice as it sounded.  -Cali Tempura (if you don't like raw stuff like me, this one is one to consider!)  It was a deep fried roll with crab and cream cheese & avocado in unagi sauce. and what made this one interesting was this sprinkle of citricy flavor on top. (it sort of like the lime flavoring in Tostitos' tortilla chips with a hint of lime for those who know what I'm talking about) The texture was crisp on the outside, soft smooth on the inside. This is one of those rolls good enough by itself without adding soy sauce/wasabi. which is rare as far as my appetite goes. Definitely a great try for those who don't like raw stuff! -Filet Mignon  I know I know you're probably asking me why would I order suchas dish when this place is for sushi!? My counter-argument: I was feeling ambitious and wanted something I could not get at any other sushi place. I do not regret my decision one bit. This steak came in a hockey puck like size (5oz) I ordered it medium-rare and it came out almost medium and they gave me a dull knife BUT the sauces (seems like a mushroom sauteed brown sauce and teriyaki side by side) mixed with the mashed parsnip (it's like a whipped, fluffy white sauce with a hint of wasabi) is almost to jump for.  **of course I'm probably wrong but thats what it tasted like TO ME** -Sushi and Sashimi Bento Box It just like any other Bento box and comes with what it comes with. I'm not a raw Sashimi type of person but my girlfriend is and she loved the thick cuts of fish and she exclaims it to be the best she has had so far. I did try the spicy tuna roll with the Bento. As much as I don't usually like raw fish, it was good. the tuna almost melted in my mouth as it did not require any effort to chew. overall, this one is pretty generic but was prepared nicely and close to perfection.  To conclude this extremely long review, the meal was very enjoyable but a bit too pricey on a college student's income. also, try drinking water or something that helps cleanse your tongue's palette so you can truly enjoy each bite.

The spicy tuna over crunchy rice appetizer is a must must must! There hasn't been a time we have not started out with his dish.  The maki roles are great portions and for those interested in something a bit more hearty their small entrees are excellent. The braised short ribs and the Filet are great ways to add more 'fullness' to your meal (or if you have picky friends and family members who refuse to eat a meal just of sushi).

Now don't get me wrong, I understand that the maki generally thrown onto the ""daily special"" menu isn't likely to be a restaurant's best and brightest dish. I get that. But I was sadly disappointed with what we did get, $4 or not.  Let me first say that the environment of Blue Ocean is great. I love the decor, the color and modern feel of the entire place is great. Just walking in we had at least four people on staff greet us kindly and our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  Sadly, I was disappointed with their maki. Some were better than others, we tried the spicy salmon which was pretty good but the seaweed wrap on that roll and a few others didn't seem fresh enough and almost dry on some edges. Many of the rolls seemed to lack flavor, such as the yellowtail and scallion roll and the unagi and cucumber roll.

You see the little storefront in that strip mall and are like, ""Oh, yeah, I've been to this  -tiny adorable sushi bar!""  Nuh-uh.  You just keep walking and walking past lovely contemporary decor and you realize that adorable, yes, tiny, no way.  It has patronage but definitely not crowded enough for a wait.  Good deal. Next, they put forth an interesting assortment of sakes, wines, martinis, and saketinis and it didn't take long to tempt my dude into a cucumber saketini (delicious and super bright Shreklike green) and me into your rice wine sampler (tiny sake spiked frothy fruit smoothies.  Holy hell, I could drink multiple rounds of these...) Interesting menu, too.  We went kind of a strange route and ordered the entree first.  We got the Blurashi (chef's premier sashimi assortment), which came with the salad.  I try not to be frivolous with the description ""best ____ ever"", but seriously.  SERIOUSLY.  Best sushi-place salad EVER.  Carrot-ginger puree is good.  Mayonaisse-soy-onion-whatever else this place does for topping salad?  Substantially better. Wow. Blurashi itself was pretty kickin' too.  We got to try sweet shrimp (tasty - and I don't even like shrimp sushi normally), some stunningly gorgeous cuts of sashimi, many of which hit the ""wow"" mark.  Even that weird egg stuff, which I normally avoid, was delicious.  The one miss?  Sea urchin.  Urgh.  I tried a tiny bit and shuddered.  My fiancee had a larger bit and claimed it tastes ""like gingivitis"".  I don't even know what that means, entirely, besides my absolute certainty that it is not a compliment.  But everything else was stellar, even the rice they put it on which was filled with bits of roe and shitake. Yum! Then, just to be backwards, we got the tuna salmon tartare appetizer.  This thing was delicious - just like a top notch ceviche starring two of my favorite raw fishes.  The only problem with that one is how it's served - it's in a martini glass with only two cracker-things to put it on, so you spill a lot trying to fit more on the crackers and after they're gone, trying to eat it with chopsticks over the long distance of a tiny martini glass in center-table to mouth.

2011-02-13,5.0,"My husband and I went here for dinner using the groupon we bought. I go here occasionally for lunch and always liked it.  Great lunch specials! Anyway, for starters we had the marinated portobello mushroom slices, which were amazing. They tasted like a very tender fillet mignon! I dont know what seasonings they used but very yummy. I dont eat beef any longer but I remember fillet tasting like that. We also tried the chicken teriyaki skewer. Not as good. The chicken was seared but tasted almost eggy on the outside. Not a fan.  Next was sushi. The salmon nigiri and hamachi & scallion roll were delicious. Just the right amount of wasabi on the nigiri and the seaweed was fresh and crisp not rubbery. Then we ordered entrees.  My miso soup was good, although somewhat heavy on the onion. My husband enjoyed his salad. He ordered the duck medallions. There were about 5 very small medallions on the plate, weighing perhaps 3 ounces. Not fair for the price on that. But they were tasty. I ordered the salmon plate. About 5 oz salmon, seared, and glazed with a teriyaki sauce over fresh cooked seasoned vegetables and mashed parsnips. Tasty and a tiny bit dry, but overall a good cut of fish.  Good food, fair price.  Our waiter was amazing and brought out each course exactly on time when we finished the one before. Very personable staff, clean clean place!  Fabulous restrooms. Bussers are right on top of every dirty plate. I highly recommend blue ocean!",0.9974,0.71,0.268,0.021,0.5557203907203907

My friend and I came here with a groupon and our entire experience -- from the staff that seemed unhappy to wait on us to the food itself -- wasn't worth the trek nor the money. Our most anticipated and pricey roll, the Cali Tempura, tasted like lemon cake and was downright gross. Our other rolls were good, but none were extraordinary and the portions were very, very tiny considering the price. I almost suspected it was because we were groupon users, as the first thing they asked us upon walking in was whether we had one or not. An 18% gratuity was also factored into our total because of the groupon and there were only two of us! I normally do leave an 18%+ tip, but I hadn't planned on it since our server really was borderline unpleasant... Guess she didn't feel like putting the extra effort in since she was getting that 18% either way. Don't get me wrong, I usually am very appreciative of businesses that take part in such promotions, but I don't think you should offer them in the first place if you plan on treating its participants as second rate customers. Period. The $15 off didn't seem to make a difference in our total bill and I needed a snack a few hours after my meal. I did really like the ambiance and the $1 sake deal, hence the extra star, but I don't think either of these are worth returning for unless you live in the area and go on a Monday for said sake deal.

We went with the bacon wrapped scallop cakes and oba chicken roll (battered chicken stuffed with mushroom, tomato and mint leaf served with wasabi and teriyaki).

I was very impressed once inside. First of all, the restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside. I thought it was going to be like Tokyo Lunchbox or some other ""strip mall"" sushi place. You walk in through a wine room and then are led past several different yet cohesive seating areas. We sat in an area near a second hostess station on the other side of the restaurant. Each dining area uses the same color scheme and modern design sense but in a different way. Despite the large size and number of dining rooms, each area felt intimate. As soon as we were seated, I noticed an additional special: $1.50 small sakes. I thought $1.50 bought one small glass but the deal was for one small bottle. Also, domestic beers were only $2.00. Altogether, my boyfriend and I ordered the Yuzu Hamachi, the Calamari roll, the Blue Ocean roll, the Smokey Bear roll, and several small sakes.  I love Hamachi, and I have very high standards. The Yuzu Hamachi was very fresh and served with jalapenos, cilantro and cucumber in ponzu. The Smokey Bear roll was my favorite, yet I enjoyed them all. The smoked salmon on the roll actually tasted smokey, as smoked salmon is supposed to taste. The Blue Ocean roll was very good but I'm used to a restaurant's signature roll being a bit more elaborate. (This is not a complaint). Blue Ocean may become my new favorite sushi place. They have lots of different specials throughout the week and several half-price days. I'm eager to return.

Their decor is warm and trendy.  I didn't feel a shred of pretentious get-ups like most places downtown cater to.  The staff is nice but I did have one server, once, who was a little frazzled. The Heat roll is delicious and one of my favorites to get each time I come by.  All of the different spices tie in to give a really nice punch but nothing overpowering. The ginger dressing on their side salad is also one of the best I've had in Chicago.  Normally I wouldn't suggest getting a salad but this is something you should have at least once. Braised Short Rib with Short Rib Maki is extremely good!  If you aren't feeling up to sushi that night, try this.  It filled me up!

2010-07-07,4.0,"I'm all about a good deal...any of my friends will tell ya that much.  If that includes the two little words of ""hour"" and ""happy,"" count me in!  Well Blue Ocean just recently introduced their Happy Hour every day of the week between 5 and 7 pm.  Get your Maki and Sake on!  Select Maki are only $4 for the same portions the normal portions usually include.  Pair that up with Sake for $1.50 (an entire mini carafe perfect for 2 or 3 to share--although it tastes like warm rubbing alcohol to me) and you're set for a good evening.   Now with all that said, there are a few down falls.  A little complaint: The touch-screen cash register needs to stop beeping obnoxiously with each touch of a finger!  Blue Ocean's ambience is quite contemporary with unique furniture/decor, bright colors, and pleasant bamboo plants on each table.  The darn beeping noise just doesn't fit in, however, a first date night would.  Not to mention the restaurant is a large L with some quaint party seating arrangements and a nice bar on one end (near the main entrance directly off Clark, not Leland).   The sushi itself is a bit more fusion than other places.  The California Rolls are more like a crab-mayo salad rolled between seaweed and sticky rice.  All the other rolls we had were tasty, but just average in quality--there's better out there.  Watch out for those Dragon rolls which fell apart every time we tried to pick one up.  And don't go blaming it on my chopstick skills!  For dessert we had the mochi and chocolate tartufo which were both nothing too outstanding; although the Pocky Sticks were a nice touch. Overall, I'm pleased to have Blue Ocean joint the ever-changing portion of Clark Street bordering Uptown, Ravenswood and Sheridan Park.  Not to mention, it's part of a small chain of three other Chicagoland restaurants: Nozumi (South Barrington), Blue Ginger (Woodridge), and Geisha Sushi (Wicker Park-Chicago).",0.9774,0.847,0.12,0.033,0.4981657848324515

2010-05-28,1.0,"I used to love this place. I am vegan and a sushi freak. They have/had this amazing roll called a midori maki. It was 10 pieces of yummyness. It was filled with sweet potato and asparagus tempura, making it a warm roll, on the outside of the rice was a thin layer of rice paper and finally the  cuda gras...thick slabs of creamy, fresh avocado. Its finished off with a delicious sauce and shredded rice paper. Trust me, it was well worth the $12. So you may be asking: Lisa, why did you give one star after all that? Let me tell you about the day Blue Ocean ruined my dreams of forever midori perfection.  I went in for their new lunch service with a friend, ordered the usual and waited eagerly. I had been craving this daddy of vegan sushi all week. When it came it was covered in a thick pile of ""edible"" flowers instead of the former toasted rice paper. I had to spend a good 2 min brushing off the petals to even find the joyous slabs of avocado wonder. FAIL. The avocado was thinly sliced  and BROWN. Gross. I was still hopefull for the warm, crispy tempura as a tucked into the first piece. All I tasted was sadness. The roll was cold, the rice was mushy, the tempura not crispy. My appetite was gone and my midori dreams crushed. Why oh why I pleaded with our waitress?!?! She, clearly being new & having no clue about the menu, left to find out. After waiting a good ten min she finally returned with the explanation that they had started using a new rice paper. Really? Did they actually think I was gonna buy that as the reason for this abomination?  Now heres the real kicker and the true reason for my one star rating for a once favorite sushi place. The manager came over and after I explained why I couldn't consume the roll on my plate pretending to be my beloved midori, she ARGUED with me about it. That the only thing different was the damn rice paper. I was done with it all at this point. I quickly finished my free water and exited Blue Ocean. You won't see me back in there. I can forgive a change in menu, a bad dish, a clueless waitress. But when I get treated rudely, like Im another dumb person who stumbled in off the street, or like my business isn't important; it totally ruins a place for me.

The calamari was very good way to start the meal, a few rolls, and a few rounds of drinks. For around 60 bucks (for me and a pretty young lady) you're thinking that's a pretty decent deal for dinner. I was a bit disappointed that the drinks cost more than the food. The service was great, the sushi was above par, but putting the kibosh on BYOB left be with a fishy taste in my mouth.

I've heard it has attracted some semi-celebrities as of late.  Here's what I filled up on today:  1) Edamame. I've been accustomed to most sushi/japanese places giving edamame complimentary, but the $4 is worth it. They came out hot and fresh, and plenty! 2) Ginger (dressing) salad. Normally I'd think of this tiny little side dish when getting salad but it was a pretty big portion. LOVE the dressing recipe that I asked for more and saved it (sans soy sauce) for my sushi lol. So, I have an eclectic taste! 3) the Heat roll (spicy tuna w/ jalapeno, avocado, etc) and it was SO GOOD. Definitely having more of that next time. 4) the California Sunset... think salmon atop a California Roll. It was good, but I think I might try another roll next time. I was eyeing the Crunch and Caterpillar rolls on the menu...  5) Also had some of the Braised Short Rib (extremely tender!) which also came with short rib maki... MMMM.

Easy parking, big modern space in a nice new building, hip downbeat music, soft lighting. Blended crowd with some groups of friends, a couple of obvious dates, more casual couples, and even a couple of tables that had a well-mannered child in tow. Hip crowd, but not too hipster douchie if you know what I mean. It was early for a Saturday night but it was starting to fill in nicely around 6:30p. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, the rest of the staff was very welcoming when we arrived and as we passed by.. the sushi chefs made it a point to thank us on the way out. Now for the food... the menu was lengthy and had all the usual offerings plus many surprises. The descriptions were enticing but didn't even begin to cover how incredible some of these dishes were. I started with grilled terriyaki scallops that were caramelized perfectly and a nice balance between smoky and sweet. I had a bite of my husband's bacon wrapped scallop cakes and those? Were one of the best things I've ever tasted. The bacon was thin and crispy, the buttery scallops literally melted in my mouth, the sauce was indescribably delicious. Heaven. Next came the miso soup.. I'm generally not a fan but I had a few bites and it was without a doubt the best I've had. My husband loved it. I had a shrimp tempura roll. Easily the best I've ever had... an incredible combination of crunchy, fresh, nutty, creamy, sweet, and salty. I usually don't like the nori, but it was very background to the other tastes and textures in this roll. I then had a small plate of the Chilean sea bass.. again, the menu didn't do it justice. It was plated beautifully with an incredible assortment of beautifully grilled fresh vegetables - asparagus, zucchini, mushrooms, red and green peppers, and some wonderful thinly sliced root vegetable - maybe sweet potato? Just amazing. The sea bass was pan seared and caramelized to perfection. Again, buttery and melt in your mouth wonderful. It was plated with a sweet mustard sauce that was a little to sticky sweet for me, but it was nice on the occasional bite in small quantities. My husband ordered a combo that included sashimi, nigiri and a roll. He was speechless throughout most of the meal and thought it was superior to even his previously favorite sushi place. The hot tea was mild and nice - I prefer more jasmine but it was a nice background for all the other complex flavors we were experiencing. Now just imagine a sushi place with a GOOD dessert menu.. there were upscale selections like creme brulee and chocolate souffle... we shared a white and dark chocolate mousse with candied cherries in the center.. again, a total surprise when it arrived.

Two drink menus and one food. We pointed out the error, no biggie. Then we got another food menu that was missing the appetizer page. Annoying, so we asked again. We ordered a bottle of wine. They were out. Another ordered. Out of that too. So, we ordered martinis. He had no other customers and couldn't remember who ordered which one.

I give this place credit for not creating another thai or chinese-sushi combo restaurant.  I don't really want pad thai with my sushi.  Needless to say, its not your run-of-the-mill sushi place.  Sure, you can probably find a deep fried cream cheese roll here, just like every other sushi joint in America.  However, the fish here is fantastic.  And, when you're smack dab in the middle of the continent, thats not an easy thing to do. Pretty much every roll is good. Its a little pricey, but those looking for just a taster can opt for some half rolls and still be satisfied with enough quantity and choices to come away with an informed opinion.  Highly recommended is the tempura, or any dish that comes with tempura, like the tempura udon.  This place has some of the best tempura in the city, hands down.  Added bonus - parking lot.

Unfortunately it was so discreet that apparently the hostess forgot about us did not assign a server. Once we flagged one down after about 15 minutes he took great care of us and apologized profusely for the lapse. For starters we had shrimp shumai, vegetable tempura and a couple of salads: wakame and and cucumber mint. Presentation was clean and unpretenious and portions were generous. All were good though I found the cucumber mint salad to have a bit of a soapy taste that I found offputting. A shame because the texture was perfect. We got a number of rolls which were satisfying, particularly the much-touted Heat roll. However I'm not a big fan of the soybean paper wrap which is used for many of the rolls. To me it lacks both the flavor of Nori as well as the contrasting visual of dark green. The Garden Maki for example, which was otherwise a nice vegetarian option would have been much better in Nori, in my opinion. If I come back I'd ask them to replace that. (Those with gluten allergies should make that request as the soybean paper has gluten in it.) We didn't have any sashimi so it's hard to comment on the quality of the fish. The maki rolls we ordered had a good bit of tempura and sauces, making for great texture and flavor but didn't necessarily showcase the flavor of the octopus, tuna etc. (This may be the fate of most Maki rolls!).

2009-09-21,4.0,"We went tonight for dinner and were thoroughly impressed.  The space is very open and inviting, the colors (fuchsia and green) are fun and funky.  It is has a lounge vibe without being too loungy.  I find that a lot of good sushi places have ""not so good"" ambiance and Blue Ocean is a step above. The spicy tuna, which is my go to, had an amazing spice!  The California roll, as basic as it gets, was truly wonderful.  However, the big winner of the night was called ""Heat"" (tuna, jalapeno, avocado, spicy mayo and crunch) - although not as spicy as you might be led to believe, it was quite delicious and we ordered seconds.   The service was friendly and attentive without being overwhelming. Bottom line is that we are super excited to have them join the neighborhood and plan to return often with hopes of future delivery service.  The only thing that I can even mention as a downer is that they didn't have high chairs, my hope is that they just do not have them YET.",0.9938,0.748,0.246,0.007,0.5788888888888888
2009-09-19,4.0,"Well, what a delight to find in Uptown! Blue Ocean was a delight, and we were surprised at their organization in their early opening.  Service was good and expedient, and the food was great. I kept it simple and ordered the Heat half-roll and Yellowtail and Scallion.  The Heat was good, but not nearly as spicy as I was expecting.  The initial texture is creamy, soft, followed by a medium crunch, and then the usual tuna.  Quite good, but I think I'll go for another choice the next time (and there definitely will be a next time).  The yellowtail and scallion simple roll was delish, and offered a nice simple counterbalance to Heat. They are still BYOB, which is great. Welcome, Blue Ocean to the neighborhood!",0.9869,0.748,0.252,0.0,0.436734693877551
2009-09-18,5.0,"I joined Yelp because I had to write this, I'm an avid reader first time writer. Living nearby and being a foodie, I was so happy to see this sushi place open.  The other sushi places nearby are kinda icky.  So if you like sushi that tastes like it's from a Jewel....go up the street.  If you want quality sushi that  blows your mind.... go to Blue Ocean ANYWAY.... my partner and I went the first night it was open.  The service was great even though they were brand new.  We had the oysters  (EFFING AMAZING.... though a bit small compared to what I'm used to)  and four rolls. * Ocean Drive (by far my favorite) *Smokey Bear (my partner's favorite) *Ungai tempura (I love eel, so it was YUMMY) *Heat (which was amazing as well, not too spicy but left a good burn) Everything was done really.... besides the creme Brulee(sp)... which they didn't torch???  Idk why not... but it came with pocky! I will come back again and again.  I hope they keep up the good work!",0.981,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.576925505050505
2009-09-17,4.0,"They officially opened today.   We popped in a few days ago to say hi and see when they would be opening, so we knew to come back today.   The space is huge and colorful.  They have three large, curvy booths toward the center of the restaurant that look like they would be great to hand out in with a group of friends.  The chairs at the rest of the tables are very comfortable, and overall I like the space a lot.  Their choice of music was fitting, and was only noticeable if you paid attention to it.    Service was about what I expected it to be opening night..  Food-wise, we tried the shiitake mushroom appetizer, the yamagobo (delicious pickled carrot-like vegetable) maki, the garden and midori rolls, and the creme brulee.  Everything we had was good, with the midori roll being the best.  I was happy to see so many vegetarian choices.   Price-wise, it was a bit more than I am used to paying compared to up the street, but it was still do-able.   I know we'll be back, especially because we live right around the corner.  They are BYOB until October 1st, when they get their liquor license.  They will also have delivery as an option in the near future",0.9437,0.901,0.099,0.0,0.5016369047619048
