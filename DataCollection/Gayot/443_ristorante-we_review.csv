2010-09-07,3.0,"I've always been a big fan of W hotels, not that I've stayed there but I like to frequent their XYZ bar in SF because of it's great atmosphere.  Every city I visit, I always try to take a look into the W hotels to see if they're as cool, cooler, or not as cool.  Well to start off with this hotel's lobby is pretty cool.  They were playing lounge music with a disco ball spinning on top of the ceiling so there were sparkling light throughout the room.  But since I didn't stay for the bar I can't give much more detail and I'll give you the details of the restaurant. For some reason I always have high expectations for W Hotel restaurants and they seem to let me down.  Perhaps I am thinking they should be in the caliber of hotel restaurants such as Four Seasons in Hong Kong, L'Adour in St. Regis, Dining Room at Ritz but they are not.  The vibe of the restaurant goes hand in hand with the hotel, cool vibe, dark interior, dim lighting, and it was so cool that I was the only one there for the whole dinner.  Maybe it's because I was that cool that I can have the place to myself.  No there won't be any Ristorante Me jokes.  Decor was so so, it was just tables with a black chair and a silver-ish booth or sofa chair.  To be honest, I felt the booth was a bit on the low end and my arms had to adjust to the table.  I'm about 5'10 which means those who are shorter would have to put their arms even higher. Onto the food.  I had a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  Nothing special.  Just a few green leaves put on a plate with a piece of toast with cheese on it.  There were some pine nuts however I think the salad had too much dressing on it.  For entree, I had the papperdelle bologenese.  It was not not delicious nor was it delicious.  It was average.  I will say that if you need to eat a good amount of food to be full,  fill up on the bread they give you which by the way didn't seem fresh and was at best lukewarm. Service was attentive as they made sure to take my plate away when I was done, if the food was good, and my hot water was refilled.  Also for the pricing (salad was $9 and pasta was $16), it isn't too expensive considering it is the W.",0.997,0.793,0.179,0.028,0.5600604686318973

2010-06-25,4.0,"Living in your own personal Twilight? Come on down to We and they'll make you vampire proof.  I met a business associate for a working lunch, it was a great choice for several reasons. First, it was close to both of our offices. Second, at least right when they open, it's an easy place to get a little work done. Lastly, the food is pretty damn good. The only downside is that's a little pricey to make a regular spot, something I've come to expect at hotel restaurants.  The menu has a nice selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, pastas and entrees. I planned to select something healthy, but the whitefish sandwich was too tempting to pass up. The sandwich was grilled and came on light rye with a garlicky aioli and a side of parmesan-truffle french fries. The sandwich was really good, perfectly cooked and the sauce gave it a nice bite. The truffle fries were awesome, definitely addictive! The only downside of the meal was that my breath was rank from all the garlic, it could've taken paint off a wall. At least I knew my associate didn't care, she ordered the same thing.  Service was friendly and attentive, our server was on his game keeping my iced tea full. At first I thought he was trying to rush us, but when it became apparent we weren't looking to get in and out quickly (as I'm guessing a lot of weekday patrons are) he eased up.  My only complaint is that they need to give this place a bit of a face-lift. At first glance it looks nice and sleek with the dark wood and maroon velour booth seats, but on closer inspection you can see it's getting a bit rough around the edges. The booth I sat in had some wear patterns and the bottom was frayed, revealing a bit of the frame.  This place won't ever be part of my everyday lunch rotation, too pricey and not enough healthy choices, but I wouldn't hesitate to return for another business lunch or when I just want something a little nicer. After all there's a plate of truffle fries with my name on it.",0.9927,0.821,0.148,0.031,0.5578442969067967

2010-04-12,1.0,"Came here on a night that I really didn't feel like ordering room service but felt too lazy to take a cab out to eat. I came into the restaurant with the mindset of ""please don't let this menu be the same as the room service one"". Well, it is..pretty similar. It has a few more options, but it's basically just as boring. I had a pasta dish which was beyond oily and unhealthy tasting that I didn't even want to finish it. We had the calamari for an appetizer...which was okay but again, un-healthy. For dessert I had the pear sorbet which was also unappetizing. Overall I felt that the restaurant was trying to be trendy, but was too small and a little too run-down to be. Also, the food was sup-par/borderline bad at best. I will not be coming back to this place. I really need to stop eating at restaurants in starwood hotels...i never seem to like them.",-0.8772,0.779,0.079,0.142,0.47175925925925927
2010-03-17,2.0,"I met my wife here for lunch the other day.  Right off the bat, we noticed that in typical W-Hotel fashion, the decor and ambiance was incredibly cool.  Upon entering the front reception, you are graced with glass vases holding fresh-cut, exotic flowers and the smell of lilacs is clinging heavily in the air.  As you walk past all the modern deco furniture you begin to detect music coming from the audio system.  It's a really amazing song but from a band you've never heard played before.  This is typical W all over it. The restaurant was hit and miss, unfortunately...and ridiculously expensive for a quick lunch in the middle of the workday.  We started with the appetizer of their self-proclaimed ""Famous Garlic Bread,"" which, I can confirm should be famous.  It was so delicious.  Think of long, toasted strips of Italian bread, soaked in garlic-Gorgonzola Alfredo sauce with garlic butter and chives.  Yummy and incredible. My wife ordered the white fish panini and she was fairly disappointed.  It had overcooked veggies on it and the fish itself was just ok.  The truffle fries were tasty, but had a soggy/mushy texture (instead of crispy) and barely lukewarm by the time they arrived at our table. I had the hamburger with swiss and bacon.  It tasted pretty good, but I had to keep stopping to pull pieces of gristle out of my mouth, which is usually a clear indication that the chef is using a lower-grade beef.  I would expect this at a Burger King, but not at a restaurant associated with the W-Hotel...and certainly not at a restaurant that charged us $50 ($60 with tip) for an app of garlic bread, a fish sandwich, a hamburger and 2 sodas at lunchtime.  I mean, seriously? The service was top notch all the way around, but the food was nowhere worth these kind of prices.  Had it been much better quality, I wouldn't have even mentioned the price, but my post-purchase dissonance on this experience was pretty high.",0.9817,0.82,0.125,0.055,0.5659897959183673
2010-03-08,2.0,"The food was bland, the service was only ok, and the price was ridiculous for what it was. I will not be going back to, nor recommending We.  We let the server know that we had a 730 curtain for the night, we had 1.5 hours for dinner, which shouldn't be a problem. The soup I was told didn't have dairy in it, did in fact have dairy in it. So the kitchen could make me chicken noodle soup if I wanted. Ok, that's fine. Yeah, dumping cut up grilled chicken breast and some sauteed veggies into a flavorless broth and serving it boiling hot does not make it soup. I had to ask for salt and pepper, even that hardly helped.  I had the salmon, it was bland and over cooked. The potatoes served with it were dry, not crispy as I'm sure was hoped for, but dry and gross. He had a bolognese sauce, you'd think that'd be hard to mess up. Also bland. I felt like asking them if they needed me to go get them some salt for the kitchen.  The space was cool, and for the most part, comfy.  The server was fairly good, although I think he was the only server and we waited on him more than a few times. He allowed us about 30 minutes for dessert, which we didn't want, but I appreciate the thought.",0.2867,0.837,0.088,0.075,0.6178888888888889
2010-01-06,3.0,"I'll preface this review by stating that I'm not nearly cool enough to be inside the likes of a W Hotel. Having said that, while the restaurant was sleek and trendy, I felt comfortable in the warm and inviting surroundings. My lunch partner and I shared the garlic bread that everyone raves about and it did not disappoint, although it could have used a bit more garlic in my opinion. The gorgonzola dipping sauce was a nice touch, but I thought it made the bread a little soggy.  We then shared a steak panino, which had arugula, tomato, and aioli. The meat was a little chewy, but had good flavor. Served on the side were truffle fries, which were thin and crispy and had some garlic, parmesan, and parsley tossed on top. These were addictive and the best part of the meal. The service was efficient and pleasant. I thought it was a nice touch that they split our entree in the kitchen, rather than have us do it at the table. I wish more places did that. Prices are typical and what you'd expect to pay for a hotel or restaurant located in the Loop. All in all, a good lunch.

2009-12-03,1.0,"My wife and I decided to try out this restaurant before the theatre. Read some reviews and it sounded reasonably good. What a disappointment. Their famous garlic bread was good but not the killer bread that other reviewers described. My wife ordered a Buchini pasta which was bland at best. I had ordered the tuna that the waiter recommended. And mind you, I've been ordering tuna for years from a wide variety of restaurants. This tuna was burnt in spots and the beans in the accompanying sauce overpowered the tuna. Plus the tuna was below average. We both returned our entrees and my wife ordered the Squash Risotto (tasteless) and I ordered the wide pasta noodles with a meat sauce (which was like a watered down meat sauce). We returned these as well. We have eaten at Italian restaurants all over Chicagoland for over 30 years and was amazed to have entrees of such mediocre quality. The manager though was very pleasant and accomodating. But this restaurant will not be continue to be a part of the Chicago dining scene by providing food that is mediocre at best.

So yeah, we like our red meat like an NFL blocker -- he's hearty, he socks a protein-packed punch to your gut, but damn, does he mow down those hunger pangs. So ristorante we is like going from Bears to bocce ball, a play in how Chicago can go from meat and potatoes to steak and frites. They say being in love means never having to say you're sorry, so I unapologetically devoured the thin, crisp fries that teasingly stuck out of their cone stand in amorous angles. Although I am a devotee to red meat, the rarer the better, I settled for a grilled tenderloin sandwich adorned with gorgonzola since it was lunch -- and so the closest thing to a steak. When I took my first bite, I almost wished I had a room waiting for me in the W, where the restaurant is located -- I just wanted to finish my lunch, then curl up in a signature W bed and dream on for the rest of this food fantasy. The steak was tender, juicy, flavourful -- I hardly ate any of the panini that held it together, I just wanted to taste the meat unadulterated.  By the way, in my haste to get to the main attraction, I forgot to mention how perfect the garlic bread was. You put it in your mouth, and the crisp crust melts away, leaving aromatic garlic to explore your mouth on it own, adrioitly disappearing down your oesophagus as soon as you re-open your mastiff for the next bite.
