The food here is an after thought b/c the real entertainment is the staff.  Corporations have sanitized the restaurant industry.  Servers and bartenders are expected to be neutral.  Gennaro's staff is not neutral.  They shoot from the hip and if you don't like it; they don't care.  Are they bad people?  No.  I'm sure they're great people.  They're the people who lived and grew up in Little Italy all their lives.  They did not move to Elmwood Park or Addisson and assimilate w/ the rest of the world.   This place is definitely more of a cultural excursion than a food experience.  I had the chicken vesuvio.  It was good, but the garlic just killed me.  My friends had the manicotti and ravioli and they were disappointed.",-0.4303,0.754,0.128,0.118,0.5301169590643274
2009-08-28,3.0,"An old school Italian place that buzzes you in the front door? Welcome to Gennaro's.  This place is a bit like eating at a relative's house. Open when they want (Thurs- Sundays) with children's drawings taped to the walls (grandchildren perhaps?)and the menu prices updated with stickers (who needs new menus anyway?) this was like a flash back to another time. A simpler time. But the prices were definitely 2009.  Once buzzed in, I took a seat at the bar to wait for my dining companion. The owner was back there greeting regulars and grabbed me a beer while I waited. There are three booths in the bar area and a handful of tables in the back. The walls are decorated with taxidermed fish (the owner's dad got the big shark on one wall) and pics of the celebrities that have eaten there.  We waited at the bar until they could get ""our"" table ready which ended up being one of the booths in the bar area.  As is often the case- we ordered a range of food so that we could try several things on the menu. For appetizers- we had the stuffed artichoke special and the antipasti plate. Both were quite good.  Next up- the soup (fava bean) and salad (iceberg and tomatoes) course which was okay but nothing special.  Finally the entrees. My dining partner in crime had the pork chops and peppers special (2 huge double pork chops smothered in peppers) which was quite good. I had the Braciole special (flank steak rolled and served over linguine). It came smothered in meat sauce and was good but I have had better at other places in town.  The service was friendly, folksy and efficient (again like eating at a relative's house) and was well coordinated between the two servers.  Given the low key approach to this place- I was surprised to see the bill coming in at $92 before tip. It felt a bit pricey for dinner and two drinks in a neighborhood place.  I love neighborhood joints to grab dinner with friends. But I love them better when they don't charge ""fancy place"" prices.",0.9964,0.771,0.199,0.03,0.42615027829313545

My group had a variety of dishes that I tasted.   First, the calamari was OK, not great, but passable.  The side salad--iceberg and a tomato wedge with Kraft Italian.  I had the lasagna special of the day and thought that, at least, this would be good.  I mean, come one, they've probably made it 50,000 times.  Not so.  I admit there were a lot of layers.   All noodles and cheese stuff--no flavor.  Did they forget the meat?  Did they forget the sauce?  The meat sauce served with it tasted scorched.   They should go down to Conte di Savoia and buy one of their homemade lasagnas--much, much better.  A friend had the sausage and peppers (another old Italian dish they should know how to make) and there must have been 10 green peppers ( so huge ) along with the dry sausage.  Peppers very greasy and oily.   I will admit that the plates of pork chops with potatoes looked huge.  But they doesn't make them good.  I didn't try that and can't comment on it.

I had the bracciola and it was unbelievable.  It was bundled nicely and wasn't too messy. There used to be some projects next door, and as a safety measure you have to get buzzed in.  It was a bit odd at first, because everyone in the whole (albeit tiny) restaurant looks to see who is walking in the door.

Since it was a Saturday night, I decided to call ahead just in case I needed to make reservations.  No joke, the woman who picked up the phone answered, ""Yeah.""  No question mark.  Just an I'm-really-irritated-I-had-to-pick-up-the-phone-again Yeah.  Awesome.  So I stammer that I need reservations figuring that if I got the wrong number, she'd hang up.  No such luck.  She asked my name, which was extremely difficult to pronounce let alone spell, but she didn't care enough to ask any follow ups, such as ""What's that again?"" or ""huh?"" --expectations were not high at this point.  Whatever.  We won't have to deal with her anyway, right? Oh, no.  Bad waitress was waiting for us when we showed up at 8.  I understood why she didn't take down our name--no one else wanted to spend their Saturday night in her surly presence.  Even though the restaurant was nearly empty, Bad Waitress sat us right next to the other table.  When we politely asked if we could be seated at a different table, she muttered none too softly and much too sarcastically under her breath, ""Well, I guess the customer is always right.""  Fun. It gets better.  So we order a bottle of wine, which Bad Waitress does at least open before plunking it down on the table.  I suppose she figured that we could taste it ourselves--good thing it was fine.  I'd hate to have dealt with sending the wine back.  She also gave us the opportunity to decide how much we would like to drink (i.e. she sure as hell wasn't going to pour it for us). Then the coup de grace:  as she delivered our salads, Bad Waitress actually hit my boyfriend's mother.  I'm not saying it was on purpose, but she sure didn't apologize. That being said, our food came fairly quickly, and it was absolutely delightful.  The portions were enormous.  I ordered the sauce with mushrooms on linguine, and it was fantastic.  My boyfriend ordered the veal, which was also very good.  Both of his parents ordered the same dish that they used to order more than 20 years ago: the sauce with mushrooms on spaghetti.  They seemed very pleased with the order.

As others have mentioned, you have to be buzzed in to enter the restaurant, which is quite fun if you're bringing guests from out of town. Once inside, you're confronted with one of the co-owners who's busy tending the bar and talking it up with the regulars. Off the bar, there are a few booths. In the back, there is an extremely tiny dining room. While this is an Italian eatery, I've never gotten one of the pasta dishes. For me, it's the pork chops with peppers and potatoes. Delicious! And so huge! I don't care who you are, you aren't finishing this dish all in one sitting. If you are in the mood for pasta be aware that the sauce err gravy is rather unique and different tasting than the usual red sauce. I took my father here, and I didn't think he really enjoyed it. However, he called me days later raving about that sauce and wondering if they would give out the recipe. I don't think so.

Yes, it was you, Yelp.  yes, it's homey. yes, it's old school. yes, you have to get buzzed in. yes, it wins buckets of points of 'ambiance'. But the food? Only Pepto could salvage this evening. We started with the calamari, which was good. I've yet to find a place that could butcher fried calamari. Soup & Salads were normal. Main dishes came next and we could not have been more ashamed to be hungry.  Between the four of us, we had two eggplant parms, one veal parm &  one beef bracciole.  The eggplant parm tasted like deep-fried sawdust patties, but mushier. If we hadn't ordered it, we never wouldn've known it was eggplant. I had a side of meatball & that was dry, heavy & flavorless. No, wait, does sawdust count as a flavor? the veal parm was skimpy on the veal & the breading was loose. the bracciole was the saving grace for the table. Unfortunately, that means only one out of four us walked out happy and I wasn't that one. Everything came on a bed of spaghetti & sauce. the pasta was fine. I couldn't tell if it was fresh or dried. it was spaghetti, I felt like I was 9. The sauce was...flavorless & pointless. Doesn't Italian food usually mean garlic?  The cannoli was actually quite good. homemade actually equaled delicious when it came to dessert. We all ravaged the poor cannoli and they never had a chance to escape.   This place makes Olive Garden taste like authentic Italian. You come to a place for the food, not the ambiance.
