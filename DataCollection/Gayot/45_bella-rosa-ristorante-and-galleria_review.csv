2008-05-01,4.0,"Honestly, this place probably deserves 3 stars, but I frequent it regularly, and I'm always treated to such fantastic service that it deserved a 4 star rating. I love their pizzas - my favorites are the Margarita and the Sausage.  The serving of pizza is ample, and I love the crust, nice and crispy. I've also had their Gnocchi, and it's fantastic.  I recently had dinner there with co-workers and I shared the Cavatelli with someone else, and everyone ended up picking up off the plate.  The sauce is nice and light, and doesn't overpower everything else.  Some of my other co-workers ordered the sausage.  I had some and thought it was pretty tasty. I've tried two of their desserts, the tiramisu and the - I can't remember the name of it - one with ice cream.  The tiramisu was good, but but the ice cream one was fantastic! The bread is awesome and they're more than willing to keep it coming. Above all else, the service I receive there is fantastic, and they treat their regular patrons very well.  I would recommend this spot to just about anyone looking for a good meal with good service.  I do agree with Jessica M. that the prices are a bit steep for a casual place, so if you don't want to spend too much dough, just order and share one of the pizzas.",0.9983,0.681,0.314,0.005,0.6109449192782527
2008-03-14,4.0,"We stumbled into this place after a looong night at the now-defunct Cabaret.  We ordered a few slices of pepperoni pizza. They have what they call ""Cincinnati pepperoni"" on their pizza, and though it was terrific, my boyfriend grew up in Cincinnati (lived there for 21 years) and had never heard of it. That didn't make it any less delicious though. Great crust, sauce, cheese, toppings- all top quality.  We also had (if memory serves me, which it very well might not) the garlic bread with fresh parmesan. Also wonderful.  If you're ever on Hubbard after the bars, this is great drunk food. We've been meaning to go back and see if our recollection of how good the food was is accurate. Can't wait.",0.9754,0.789,0.194,0.017,0.5857142857142856
2007-11-28,4.0,"So, I really think this place is a 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do that,so I gave the place the benefit of the doubt. :-) The space is ok -- a little cheesy, but hey - that never hurt anyone.  I thought the art was a bit weird, but I'll defer to my fellow yelpers since I'm pretty much a Philistine.  The food was VERY GOOD -- fantastic bread, good salad (though I think the dressing was out of a can), great linguine with clam sauce, and good tiramisu.  The service was also very good and the staff was very friendly.  I thought the prices were a bit steep since it was such a casual place, but  all in all it was a nice experience.   My summary:  Not a fancy dinner, but a good dinner, although a bit pricey.",0.9958,0.597,0.357,0.046,0.7066666666666667
2007-11-14,5.0,"Some friends were in town staying by River North when we bumped into this quaint and cozy spot. The food is decidely traditional Italian -- fab dishes such as spaghetti bolognese, veal marsala and linguine with fresh clams. Then there are some inventive dishes such as the lobster and crab ravioli and the house special called Homemade Eight Finger Cavattelli. What took our breath away was the art on the walls. Our server told us that the artist is the wife of one of the owners - Rosa Cayro Guidarelli. The style is surreal - you can tell she has been influenced by Picasso and Dali - and the themes focus on relationships and life's trials and tribulations. The originals are not for sale but according to the ""art menu"" giclee renderings can be purchased. Says that giclee is a high resolution reproduction of fine art. I wasn't ready to order right there and then but was given the website  cayroart.com  and now I am perusing for a Christmas gift for one of my sisters. . So you come here for solid good food and you get to enjoy the artwork. Great for conversation in a small, intimate setting.",0.9767,0.848,0.139,0.013,0.5577443609022555
