The wood-panelled bustling ambiance was nice - so our hopes were high. The waiter was nice, but we noticed early on that he was doing a fair amount of apologizing at other tables, so that might have been a bad omen. I had the spring roll appetizer - it was awful. My friend had the potstickers, which were OK. Then we shared a salad which was truly ordinary - bag salad and some vinagrette. Then the fish entrees came. My friend's halibut looked dreadful and tasted only slightly less so - an amorphous looking beige glob of fish floating in some sort of salty soup with bok-choy. Mine was a bit better, but still not as good as I could make at home. (only the haricot vert were truly good) The sorbet was strangely gummy, and the red velvet cake was strictly Sara Lee institutional.

2011-05-03,5.0,"I am saving all my prose for the current manuscript I am writing so I apologize if my review should come across too succinct. I bought one of those ubiquitous vouchers for a 3 course meal (a propos, a great Groupon deal would be a Groupon for the next Groupon deal) for 33 Club and took the girlfriend there for our habitual date night. Apparently, amongst the hostesses, there was an ongoing bet who could pull the shortest dress; notwithstanding they were very nice. I have to say, I like the décor, the staircase in the middle of the room, the tapestry, pictures on the wall, some rather pornographic by prudish American standards. Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable despite her Playboy Bunnyesque Bowtie. The wine list was quite impressive but since Alpana Singh no longer dispenses free tips for sommelier wannabes  tips in the Redeye,  I stuck with beverage of choice; Grey-Goose Soda. Girlfriend had the Bellini cocktail, and swore it was scrumptious, tasted to me like the generic mouthwash from ALDI. For appetizers we had the Mussels-heavenly- and Buffalo shrimps-very yummy -but a little bit spicy even for my African palate.  For Entrée, excuse my short excursus, but how did the main dish get to be termed Entrée in the US? I guess Plat Principal doesn't sound sexy enough, oh well; we had the Blue Crab Spaghetti with sea-food, again delicious, cooked just right (al Dente) and Chicken breast wrapped in Prosciutto. On the whole it was a great experience, great atmosphere, yummy food in sufficient quantities. The crowd is more on the mature side, though a Bachelorette entourage came through.

The bummer came at the end: We split our $500 bill into cash and two credit card charges. My credit card was overcharged by $100. You would give the waiter the benefit of the doubt, but after our inquiry there was no apology or corrected charge, and the charge was NOT presented as included tip. Our waiter disappeared mumbling something about recounting the cash. The menu doesn't mention automatic tipping for big parties either. So the only conclusion is that the waiter tried to get an extra $100 out of us, as if we were too drunk to do the math. At that point I didn't want to make a big stink to avoid ruining the evening, and I had planned to tip 20% - but not by means of an overcharge. I contacted management thru their website, but after more than one week still no reply. A sad affair, suffice it to say that we will not be back.

The calamari, mushroom soup and beet salad were excellent.  Parents had the salmon and halibut, both said their dishes were great.  I had the Blue Crab pasta in angry sauce.  I think my sauce was super angry, it was a bit uncomfortable to me to eat.  But it was good.   I'm glad I didn't finish my dinner, because I got Red Velvet Cake for dessert.  Holy cow that was EXCELLENT!!!  So good!!  It was my birthday and they said the birthday portion was a cupcake.  Forget that, I wanted a big slice.  We finished that bad boy off.

2011-04-08,4.0,"Made reservations on Open Table for Saturday night.  The bar was fairly busy, as expected, for the NCAA basketball semis.  Though the dining area was also fairly bustling, we were seated promptly upon entering. Service: Painfully unnecessarily ridiculously slow.  Wow.  I could not believe how long everything took, from putting in our order for drinks all the way to getting our check.  The place was nearly empty when we finally finished.  Not really sure if the waiter was particularly evasive with our table or just generally this way all around.  However, he was pleasant and talkative, when he was around. Food: I ordered the 33 Club burger, medium rare, with white cheddar and bacon.  Fantastic!  One of the better burgers I've ever had.  Perhaps my extreme hunger by this time played into it, but either way, the flavor was outstanding.   For dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse cake (not on their website when I checked, for some reason) and my date ordered the red velvet cake.  Unfortunately, they were all out of the red velvet cake, but substituted a complimentary red velvet birthday cupcake, instead.  Both were pretty good, but I was quite full by this time so I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have, had I not eaten so much of the main course (I also had eaten a sizable piece of my date's chicken dish, though she would have you believe it was a small bite). Overall, the pleasure derived from the food overshadowed the somewhat deficient service provided.  Again, the service was only sub-par based on the length of time everything seemed to take and it all seemed centered on our waiter.  I would go again for the burger alone and to sample one of their Allen Brothers dry-aged steaks.

We walked in about 815 pm and the hostess stand is in an awkward spot and she kind of stared at us confused until we said wed like a table for 2. No welcome, just grabbed some menus and took us to a table in a mostly empty room. I was the youngest person in there by 10 years and definitely got some looks. The decor is beautiful, I want to steal those Vuitton chairs. They must have gotten rid of the ugly green painting I keep hearing about or I wasn't stuck facing it. Our waiter was pleasant and competant, kind of stumbled over the specials, but no worries. Wine was 33% off, but I felt the selection was kind of lacking.  Tried the tartare and the boy thought it was crap. It definitely needed something else, but when combined with the pickled fig it was much better. Grateful the fish special was their scallop app because I love scallops and the boy hates them. Boy got the chicken which wasn't bad, he enjoyed it, but the addition of sesame oil was just odd because it overwhelmed every other taste. I was in love with my scallops. The capers and golden raisins mixed well with the scallops wihich were cooked to perfection. It was odd that some of them weren't presented correctly (inductor on the left), but oh well. The cauliflower puree with purple, green and white cauliflower was kind of awesome. We skipped desert because I was kind of full and couldn't agree on one to share, but I would like to be back to try the ginger brulee with sugared blueberries and candied limes. Price was decent, I'd definitely be back. The other diners meals looked nice, but the fish portions seemed extremely small and the salads seemed quite large.

The burgers & sandwich was good, but nothing spectacular.  We went back our second time for brunch w/ my family; this time we were there earlier so we dined on breakfast menu. A few of us were interested in the all-you-can eat brunch & the rest of the group wanted to order dishes off the menu. We were told the entire party had to order the all-you-can eat brunch special or else we couldn't partake. We weren't crazy re this option, but the entire group decided to order the all-you-can eat brunch. My brother really wanted to try the apple & pork belly so we had to order this dish in addition to the adult-per-person cost we were paying for the all-you-can eat brunch. The pork belly & apple benedict turned out to be much more apple than pork belly. The little bit of pork in the dish was good, but there were way too many apple slices topped on this benedict. The dish ended up being too sweet and sour as a result of too many apples. The all-you-can eat brunch wasn't bad. The first batch of sausage patties were nice & browned, but the second batch weren't browned at all & looked almost rare. The first batch of bacon was burnt, but luckily my family likes extra crispy bacon; however the second batch was greasy & stringy because they were undercooked. It just seemed like many of the dishes were cooked inconsistently. The service both times were just ok.

It's closer to 3.5 stars.  The steaks - using a highly regarded brand name steaks such as Allen Brothers is fine - but comes off a little too commercial, even if they are good (which they are).  A steak house 'Club' should specialize in it's own method of aging and be proud of it.   My latest outing was with the pan roasted chicken - very nice presentation and almost as good as my mother's.  Not bad.  Started out with a roasted beet salad- quite different........Tempura battered asparagus and bernaise sauce -sounds good, but not a fan.   I'll stick with traditional non-battered grilled asparagus next time.  I think others may like it, just not I.      Dessert-  A 'Club' should offer desserts in absurd portions as to make you embarassed to finish them in public, which these do not - they are closer to a trendy hotel sushi bar portion size.  However, the line-up is quite good and  the Apple Crostata & Coconut Cream cake are well executed - cinnamon gelato should be sizable to offset the 'pie', not  just a dallop!

The service was painfully slow. Our server kept disappearing when we needed something. When I told him that my halibut was not good, he brought us free dessert, which I appreciated but it didn't make up for the fact that my entree was absolutely awful. It is misleading and deceitful to label their fish selections on the menu as ""fresh"" when clearly they serve frozen fish. I cook fish at home and trust me I can tell the difference between fresh and frozen fish. When you cook frozen fish, it gets more chewy and less flaky and my fish was so thick and chewy, I couldn't cut through it with a fork, I had to use a knife. Fresh halibut should be nice and flaky and pulled apart with a fork. This was not fresh fish and to add insult to injury, it cost $32 for a tiny piece!!!

It was Saturday evening dinner time had approached and we had no plan so my wife and I decided to go for a drive and find a place to grab a bite. As I drove my wife perused  opentable.com  and saw 33 club had a 8:45 reservation  it was 8:00 at the time we made the reservation parked went in gave our name to the hostess  she said it still looked like we would not be seated until closer to our reservation time 8:30 and we should grab a drink at the bar. No problem but after waiting 1 1/2 hours we were still not seated. I get its busy Saturday night but don't take reservations if you are already full and not able to seat someone with in a reasonable time of their reservation. So we worked our way thru the crowded bar and ordered a few drinks  while waiting for our table my wife ordered a bloody mary and I ordered a corona the service was fast and the bartender got us our drinks fast and then said that will be 20 dollars .. 20 bucks for a beer and a bloody mary with house liquor...crazy so I ask a different bartender to see if I can get a unbiased answer on what drinks cost  MISTAKE he walks over to the bartender that took our order after a huddle he came up with some tax story  that coronas cost $5.50 or 6.00 im like well what is it you sell them all day but he had no answer he also went on about drinks are expensive it all made no sense. He then offered to get us a few comp drink ..or more like can I please buy your silence cause my buddy just tried to screw you. Later I saw a couple order 2 coronas and get charged 5.50 each and that is what popped up on the computer screen that would mean a bloody mary is $14.50  screw job is all I have to say. I decided to call the restaurant and talk to the manager the next day and tell them what was going on. Long story short the manager checked the price of the drinks they where not 20 dollars like the bar tender said and the bar tender was just pocketing the change. He offered a 25 dollar gift certificate as repayment. I said no thanks this place is so over priced you could barley get  2 drinks for that and im not gonna give Jerry Kliener any more of my money..  Ok back to the restaurant and the food I wish I could say the food made up for the  crap that happened before but no such luck.  We started with a shrimp cocktail 16 dollars for 3 colossal shrimp the cocktail sauce was good but one of the shrimp was not cleaned and had the mud vein or the real description shrimp poop in it, not very appetizing. Next we split a wedge salad  the waitress offered to split it in the kitchen that was great but the dressing was watery  and if you ever had a wedge the good creamy blue cheese dressing is key. For entrees I had a burger it looked great but the bun came out soggy to the point of being floppy I had to flip the burger over to eat it so the bottom bun did not fall apart.

The buffet brunch had every traditional fare and was absolutely delicious. I could not get over the sweet potatoes- they were thinly sliced and baked with butter... DIVINE!

Some reviewers dinged 33 Club for its service. Although its not perfect, it was adequate and friendly.  The food is where I think 33 Club falls short. With just a little more effort, the food could be stellar. Some food we had: Warm Goat Cheese App. - Nice choice of cheese, but the tomato sauce could have been just a tad more tangy or spicy and it would have been amazing.  Beet Salad - My wife and I love beet salad and we make a similar dish at home. This dish was nothing special. Pass on this one.  16 oz. Ribeye - Three people in our party had this dish. It just didn't have the umph that a good aged steak should have. The blue cheese crust wasn't done very well. Just a little more attention to detail and I think this could have been a nice dish. Ahi tuna - Again, the seasoning was just ok. Nothing memorable.  The ambiance was nice in the main room. The decor is nice to look at and tables are spaced well.

(Since I am pregnant, I don't have much of an appetite!)  After we finished our appetizer (about twenty minutes after ordered) the waiter came over and told us they were out of the halibut we ordered.  We had to pick something else.  He was unapologetic and just very matter-of-fact about the situation.  He neither offered to nor did anything for the inconvenience.    Our salad course was great, probably the only good thing about the meal.  We ordered the filet trio---similar to what we love from Wildfire.  I'd stick to going to Wildfire for this entree as it was only subpar at 33 Club--there was barely an crust on our ""encrusted"" filets.  After the meal the waiter basically threw the dessert menu on the table.  I stopped him and asked for the bill.  He brought us the bill and charged us for an extra appetizer, which we realized after he walked away.  He never came back over to pick up our credit card---we had to ask a manager to take care of it for us.  Overall, this was a crappy dining experience and I would not go back to 33 Club.  There are too many good restaurants in the city that actually care about your business---it was a huge disappointment.",0.9714,0.835,0.113,0.052,0.4041666666666666

The crowd is very mixed...we encountered over-plucked and pulled 50-somethings, young families with their children, and of course your typical 30-something Old Town dwellers. If you love people watching, you won't be disappointed here! We started with their tempura-battered green beens with spicy aioli sauce. Yum. Cool idea, nice outcome, and plenty to share. I was tempted to eat the remaining tempura flakes but remembered that I would be eating pure fat. No wonder I wanted it! My stepmom ordered their Sweet Chili Glazed Alaskan Halibut and she was smiling between every sip of water - spicy! My dad ordered their short ribs and he practically licked the plate clean. I'm never one to order red meat, but I did taste his and it was tender, tasty, and I even wanted more to make up for my bust of a meal. I ordered very poorly. I chose the Nicoise Salad and regretted it as soon as the server set my plate down. It was a full plate, unlike the others', but it was boring. The tuna, which I ordered rare, was bland and every bite I took to mix in some flavor was lacking. It came with anchovies which I immediately took off. Perhaps they were the key ingredient, but I'm now realizing anchovies were never even listed on the menu, while capers and fingerling potatoes were... ***Note to 33 Club: Please don't make such substitutions without informing your patrons, especially anchovies. I know 2 people that actually like them.  So my dish was pathetic. I did inform our server, and he was kind enough to comp us a red velvet cake. Delish. My belly says thank you to that! We also ordered the sorbet to share with 3 scoops of Blackberry Currant and it too was a delight. So overall, it's 3 stars for 33 Club.

The unenthusiastic hostess picked up three menus, placed them on an empty table outside, and walked away. I get it, you don't like your job. At least pretend like you do when there are paying customers around. Someone dropped off water and silverware after a couple of minutes and walked away without a word. And then, we sat there. For awhile. Like, 10 minutes on a not too crowded Saturday afternoon at 1:30. Our waiter magically appeared and took our order. I say ""magically"" because that was the only time we saw him until the bill came (which I'll get to, don't you worry). Oh wait! We did see him again. He dropped off a steak knife and came up right behind me, causing the back of my head to ram into his stomach. I think it was made more awkward by the fact that he didn't acknowledge that anything happened. Um, my head was IN your stomach and close to other regions that make us no longer strangers. No thank you. My girlfriend's Bloody Mary took another 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was held up by the deli counter freshly slicing the salami garnish. Or not.

Normally, I would send it back but we were on a time crunch and I had hangover stomach that couldn't wait another 15 minutes for a new meal.

I swear to you, it was about 15 minutes before our waiter came over and dropped the check. And then we waited again for him to pick it up. We finally got up from the table, handed him the bill and all went to the bathroom. The unenthusiastic hostess who we all know and love so much handed/shoved the bill in front of us on our way out.

2010-05-22,3.0,"Good place.  Ate outside on their patio on a Saturday early evening. They offered a bar and dinner menu, both with really nice selections. We ended up getting a bacon cheddar burger with fried egg and a salmon salad. I consider myself a connoisseur of burgers with fried eggs as I have had way too many of them in my day. I'd rate this one a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. So good, not great. The salmon salad was light and refreshing. The only complaint I had on their menu is I wish they had a bigger beer menu. I absolutely hate boring beer menus. Service was really good and friendly. I found the decor to be impressive. The bar/restaurant area is super sleek. While i didn't spend much time in there, the traditional dinning area looks like a beautiful ballroom. The guys bathrooms were filled with artsy pictures of boobs, always a plus!  So overall, beer (wish there was a better selection) + burger (good, but not great) + boobs = good!",0.9496,0.792,0.161,0.047,0.6358024691358024

Atmosphere was nice.  Restaurant has very masculine tones - basically your modern steakhouse look with lots of wood and a cool bar whose backdrop goes up to the ceiling.  Architecture didn't wow me though.  It was a bit heavy and even the bar just lacked some of the smaller details that would have made it be really memorable. Food was good but not outstanding.  I tasted both the whitefish and the sea bass.  The fish felt a bit heavy because of the use of a cream which was not helped by the fact that the fish was served over rice.

2010-03-14,4.0,"Club 33 is a throwback to the long gone days of dark paneled wood furniture, reptilian leather chairs, and old school hutches. Coming here for my mom's birthday, Club 33 rang it up in style.  Entering the old school revolving door reminded me of upscale New York or going somewhere fancy downtown. We walked into the entrance and were welcomed by a large bar area with a load of tables all with candles on them dimly lit with a few people passing the time with cocktails enjoying quiet conversation. We were led to the main dining room featuring 25-40 feet high ceilings with artwork and framed mirrors lining the wall.  We were seated against the wall and I got a good view of a giant 15 foot high painting of a steak complete with neon blank background and took a look up to the stairs to a private dining area and a look to my right to marvel at the magnificent hutch featuring choice liquors in the house and noted the white cloths at every table. The server arrived with a perfect recitation of the day's special menu and was all business as he did not emanate any degree of friendliness. Water and bread came on arrival and we ordered quickly without any fuss. Appetizers we ordered included calamari which had the best value for $10, four bacon wrapped dates for $9, and one crab cake for $12. Strange to have one crab cake on the menu, it would be better to say on the menu: ONE crabcake, but it was still delicious. The calamari was crisp with lemon aioli and a very water marinara sauce but there was a bit too much saltiness in the calamari. I ordered a center cut steak with a bleu cheese crust on potato cake and really should have ordered a soup, side, or salad since the portion seemed exceptionally small and the plate was very barren and I could see why the server asked if I wanted a soup, salad, or side when I ordered it! Despite this, the steak was delicious medium well and I was more full than I thought I'd be after eating it. Since I was still a bit hungry, we dove into dessert and I helped myself to a hot chocolate fudge sundae: YUM! The sundae came with homemade peanut brittle that was absolutely delightful! By the end of dinner I was satisfied with the meal but raised an eyebrow with the check. For $190 (not including tip) we received: 2 center cut steaks on potato cake 1 grilled king salmon 1 pork chop with potato 1 order of calamari 4 bacon wrapped dates 1 crab cake 1 hot fudge chocolate sundae 1 slice vanilla cheese cake 1 chocolate tart 3 diet cokes 1 iced tea A bit on the pricey side, but the service was top grade minus friendliness and the food hit the spot.",0.9918,0.879,0.107,0.014,0.4739687349687351

It had gorgeous slices of red and golden beets alternated and topped with goat cheese and candied walnuts. The greens were crunchy, fresh and peppery and a perfect complement to the sweetness of the beets.  Second course was the petite filet with pink peppercorn sauce over mashed potatoes. Perfect medium rare and so tender! We really couldn't have had dessert if we tried. Not only was Chris an excellent server, but the support staff was great as well. Never did my water glass go half full, nor did our plates linger on the table. Yet it seemed effortless and unhurried.

Ambiance: Probably the high point of the restaurant.  Soaring ceilings, tasteful artwork (very large abstract painting on one wall, eclectic grouping nearby) much better than the gaudy circus feel of most Kleiner restaurants.  About halfway through the meal they started piping in bad 70's music, which was quickly turned down.  Still, the music was an unnecessary element to a restaurant in which it was already difficult to hold a conversation. Service: Only ok.  The waiter was very polite when he was at the table, but he never checked in with us to let us know where our entrees were.  Normally this might not be a problem, but it was approximately one hour from the time my ass hit my chair, until the time I got my first bite of my entree.  Unacceptable. Food: I ordered the dover sole special and the fish came out tepid.  I was in a group of 6 so I didn't want to send it back, but especially when you've waited so long, the food shoudl at least be hot.  Makes me wonder if the waiter was at fault or the kitchen.  The taste of the sole was only so-so, despite our waiter raving about the dish.  The beet salad was lovely to look at (thinly sliced yellow and red beets), but the candied walnuts were not candied, the goat cheese lacked flavor and given that there was no oil, salt or pepper on the beets, the entire dish lacked flavor.  Major disappointment.  On the whole, the dishes on the menu lacked creative flair.

2009-11-18,2.0,"Let's cut right to the chase - there is no reason to come to this restaurant unless you are 25 and on the make. As you can tell I was unimpressed with 33 Club.  The menu was boring and lacking in anything imaginative.  It had aspirations of greatness, which clashed horribly with the 100% pedestrian dishes on the menu (steak, chops, and the same old fish you see everywhere else).  If I want comfort food I'll go to a comfort food place.  This place aspired to Prada but was serving Eddie Bauer. Service was poor and bordering on weird.  Our waiter creeped us out (four seasoned veteran diners, so it takes a lot to creep us out) and left us alone for long periods of time when we needed to order wine, food, and other things you usually do in a restaurant.  Not good for a place purporting to be fine dining. I knew it was going to be a long evening when I walked in to the bar (which at first glance looked well stocked and ready for a good evening) only to see the Bulls game on the big screen.  Fine dining and the Bulls are not a match made in heaven.  However, the scenesters picking each other up at the bar seemed fine with it.  I seem to have missed the memo that said that people over 25 years old should not eat here. In short - boring food, adequately prepared, with an emphasis on the bar scene and not on the food scene.  I won't be back.",0.9081,0.809,0.114,0.077,0.4541090629800308

The waiter was REALLY friendly, and by really friendly I mean over the line inappropriate and blatantly flirtatious.  All that flirty on his end and he didn't comp any of the $13.50 martinis?  You will be single forever, my man. Had the tuna special - sashimi grade with a delicous au poivre sauce drizzled on it.  My friends had the whitefish filet and the other had the steak, which they both loved despite looking like they barely touched it - the portions were huge!  However, the dessert was definitely the highlight of the evening, definitely recommend the brownie sundae topped with peanut brittle, vanilla ice cream and a raspberry.  Lucky for me, the other two didn't like peanut brittle (shhhhh, it's the best part). Probably a place I would return to with a group of friends or (if I had) a long term boyfriend, but not a great ""first date"" locale due to the noise level.  Hopefully by then they will have been able to weed out the weirdos.",0.9663,0.756,0.179,0.065,0.5254509379509379

The staff was friendly and the drinks were stiff--that alone gets a few stars. Then I went for lunch with a girlfriend before heading to the Field to see the Diamonds exhibit (omg, you have to see it!) and that sealed the deal for me.  I had somehow missed the swanky decor upon entering the first time (uh, too many free Yelp party drinks?!). When we went for lunch we were brought into the main dining room and I was in love. The chairs are to die for; a mixture of alligator (?) and red, black and white fabric, and the art covering the walls kept me straying from my companion's conversation. There is a huge, huge neon green painting with what looks like a charred human heart splattered on the corner--LOVED that one. A completely eclectic mix of decor but the place still had such an old school gorgeous feel. I totally want to have a date there. Yeah, okay, I would settle for just a date at this point. :(  I have not even told you about the food yet! Our server, Brian, seemed a bit nervous when we asked questions about the wine and menu but maybe it was because we were the first table of the afternoon or maybe it was because we two were just so pretty he couldn't focus! ;)  Once settled on, we ordered between us, the mac and cheese (which isn't on the lunch menu but we begged), the tomato soup with mini grilled cheese sandwich, and the mozzarella, tomato and basil omelet, served with toast (super dry) and potatoes (with onions and peppers--so good!).  That mac and cheese, which I think was made with truffle oil, was so good, I mean it..tasty! I did not sample my friend's soup/sandwich because my omelet was so big and came with the sides but what I had was really good. The omelet was really fresh and fluffy and those potatoes were perfectly seasoned.  After all of that food it was on to the Field to study our favorite topic, as mentioned previously, Diamonds!

Coming in here I had an open mind, an open heart and a hungry stomach.  Like quite a few people who have reviewed this place I came here for the after party, except I did not attend the before party. I came here a wee bit early to sit down with a friend, catch up and heave some tasty vittles in my mouth. Yes, the place is slightly over the top, but good lord do I believe this area needed something different and I like the style here. An updated version of an old style bar. Big bar, big mirrors,  loads of space and well, the place was jumping and pretty full. I was hushed to the downstairs private party room. Lovely and not over the top, I spied with my little eye my friend and an open seat next to her at the downstairs bar. I nestled up with a glass of Pinot Noir and gazed longingly at the menu... tracing every word with my finger, achingly imaging every descriptive morsel being wrapped around by my mouth... oh wait. Sorry about that... I sometimes tend to romanticize the past.  But here? No romanticizing the hefty and delicious burger I got. Cheese? Check. Bacon? Sweet Mama. Fried egg? Sorry for that pool of water there, that's my drool. Medium please and off my order went. Doc, (the bartender), was nice and informative on life. Never overbearing, forceful and could pour a mean glass of spirits, just like a good bartender should be. Then out came my burger. The fries were good, the burger was infinitely better. Nothin' says lovin' like a classic breakfast combo on a cheeseburger , (or an artery clogging meal), than this burger. Prices aren't horrible and pretty apropos for the area. Certainly a welcome new face for the Old Town area and a place I can be happy coming back to.

I then made my way to the party downstairs, which was serviced by bartender ""Doc,"" who was sociable, efficient as hell, and a true professional. When I ordered my calamari appetizer, the party was already crowded. I expected it to take a while. Doc waved me over to the bar in less than ten minutes, and there was my calamari (which was very good enough; I was so hungry that it could have been average and I still would have liked it). Someone turned off the Yankees/Phillies game and turned on the Bulls. I asked Doc if we could please have the Yankee game back. Done. Back to the World Series. Eh, Bulls....we have a few games yet to watch this year, don't we? Doc had asked me if he could run a tab; that was fine.

2009-09-22,2.0,"If there was a 2.5, I would have given 33 Club that score, but in this case I don't mind rounding down.  For decor, I would give the restaurant probably 5 stars. There are lots of dark woods, and rich colors. If you have been to RL, think that, but with a lot more color (and youth). So, in terms of decor, the room doesn't disappoint (if you like a clubby feel). Plus, there is a nice separation between the front bar and the dining room in back, so it was easy to actually have a conversation during dinner on a Friday night.  That being said, the front bar area is nice also, with a 30 something crowd the night we were there (and the time before when I was there). Also, think Kleiner groupies, and older preying types (of both kinds).  The food was decent, but not phenom. I had the salmon ceviche app, which was quite good. 3 good sized pieces of salmon on top of jicama and an avocado pure -- all for $8. However, it was essentially raw salmon, with no evidence of any significant citrus marination (which was fine by me). Then, as I had read about the Chilean sea bass entree in the paper the other day (in the Trib's write up), I gave it a try. It might have been a touch overcooked, but otherwise, I thought it was pretty good, and not unreasonably priced (at $28 I think). There was an apple pie at the table, which seemed to be appreciated.  Now, you might ask, why in the world would only 2 stars be awarded? Picture fruit flys buzzing your table all evening. I swear, they were all over our table, and there is nothing worse then having to swat at fruit flys all night, not to mention when you actually get one on the table that leaves a really artful blood streak (I guess the color matched the decor). Even if that wasn't the worst part, when this was brought to the attention of the server, he said he would ""bring it to the attention of the big man immediately."" Well, not that I was expecting anything major, but that was the last we heard about it, as if I hadn't even said a word. Not even an apology? C'mon.  So, for the simple fact that our table seemed to have an unfortunate amount of uninvited guests, 2 stars.",0.9959,0.828,0.153,0.019,0.5275021275021274
2009-09-21,4.0,"33 Club is a fairly new restaurant on Wells, from Jerry Kleiner and the guys behind Opera, Carnivale, Marche and other fun, high end places where Chicago's upper and upper middle class dine. The interior has soaring ceilings, mahogany everywhere and a grand staircase at the back of the restaurant.  It's decor is reminiscent of an expensive lawyers office, yet it's warm and inviting. The menu isn't large and contains typical American fair.  Everyone was more than pleased with the food.  We had the Chilean Sea Bass.  It was glazed in a teriyaki, and was excellent.  The pork belly was ""life changing"", the bone in New York melted in your mouth, and my prime sirloin was cooked to perfection.  We ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, probably the best creamed spinach I've ever had.  For desert the red velvet cake stole the show and the brownie chunks came in a close second.  Overall, we were thoroughly impressed with the food. The service was on par, but they brought out the wrong entree, which they quickly remedied, and forgot our wedge salad. The clientele is an interesting mixed of young, well to-do ex fraternity guys, stylish women out for a girls night, and old men looking for their next ex-wife.  The bar area up front has a few plasmas to catch the game and is always filled with a group of early thirty year old women looking for their next sugar daddy.  Definitely a cougar and cougar-in-training den. I enjoyed dinner with my girl friend an another couple and loved the food, but could have done with out the creepy old man stares and whispers from the catty women trying to defy age and gravity.  Overall, a fun time, great food, good ambiance, interesting crowd, and a new, well needed place in Old Town.",0.9955,0.794,0.193,0.012,0.4378718451359961

I went there for a special occasion and had thought it would be a little bit more upscale than it really was. (It was nice, don't get me wrong, but I think it is more trendy than anything.) It was the new place to try. We had gone a tad overdressed thinking it was a fancier place. But still, it wasn't like we felt totally out of place. The prices are a little bit more expensive than his other restaurants.  For an appetizer we had the tuna tartar. It was good but not the best tuna I have had. We shared our two entrees: first was the chilean sea bass with a miso glaze. I thought it was a tad salty and my boyfriend thought it was a tad mushy. So overall, not the best. We also ordered the filet mignon on the bone which was a special that night. The steak was good... pretty large size and cooked medium rare. But, of course, they don't tell us the price of the specials and it turns out the steak was $50! Yes, it was a prime cut of steak and huge... but if we had known it would be that much more than the regular menu (around the $30 range for entrees) we probably wouldn't have ordered it.

An attempt to copy Avec's flavors with a red pepper sauce, not quite the same but definitely good. Then we had a special heirloom tomato salad with red onion, Gorgonzola cheese and some orange flavored oil- I really liked that it came with a cute little spoon of sea salt.

We ate at the bar thinking that would be faster, because we were in a bit of a rush - which we told the bartender upfront. There were maybe six tables eating, max. The bartender was very sweet, and attentive - for the first five minutes. We ordered the plate of olives, the 33 Burger and the Roasted Tomato Soup with a Petite Grilled Cheese Sandwich (sounds fun, right?).  Twenty-five minutes later, the food arrived.  First of all, why not bring the olives first? I know you have them prepped behind the line - just send them out so we've got something to snack on. Nope, they came with the food. Second, the food was really meh. The soup was ok, but the ""grilled cheese sandwich"" looked as though they'd melted the cheese and slapped it between two un-toasted pieces of bread. It was soggy! Unforgivable, in my book. If you can't make a good grilled cheese sandwich you shouldn't be cooking. The burger was completely under-seasoned and, while cooked correctly, tasted like cardboard.  And all of this took almost a half hour to prepare - with six tables in the place! Since I work in the industry I'm typically very willing to forgive slightly slow service (I understand that things can get backed up, cooks can get stuck in the weeds, runners on smoke breaks, etc) but I thought that was a bit crazy.

2009-07-24,2.0,"I had dinner at 33 Club last night and arrived with high expectations because I really do love Carnivale. I agree with the posts below - the decor, atmosphere, etc is great. But, until 33 Club works out a few kinks, I will not be returning, nor will be I recommending it to friends.  We walked in at 7 and promptly got seated...so far so good, right??  But then we started this whole sitting trend...sitting, waiting, watching for our waiter.  The menu is one page and the font is huge. Maybe the large font was meant to conceal the fact that the menu is limited, which is fine for the first few weeks of a restaurant, but maybe don't make it so large that you could read it from 20 feet away.  We ordered drinks first and that was the one high point of the night. My drink was called the Ruby and it was heavenly - it contained red peach vodka, lime juice and peaches with a big peach slice on the rim of the glass. I didn't mind that it was a little sweet because every sip tasted like a bite of fresh peach, so delicious. That was pretty much where my happy experience ended. Our drinks came pretty fast, but disappointment started to set in when we waited a solid 10 minutes for our apps. I had the bacon wrapped goat cheese stuffed dates. Kind of made me think of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba...bacon wrapped dates are by far my favorite item on their menu. And maybe they should stay there. The bacon/cheese/date part was great but they were in a sauce that I couldn't really decipher and I'll be honest, it didn't really jive with the dates. Overall though, the app was good.  After waiting another 15 minutes, the entrees arrived. My pork chop was decent, but I could have used a teeny bit more sauce on the side to infuse a little moisture into my meat! I haven't a clue what came with it on the side and at that point I didn't want to bother the waiter to ask. There were some little gnocchi/potato looking things which were really good...but the ""cabbage"" almost looked like shredded beets and the taste was so pungent that I couldn't take more than one bite.  Fast forward about 35 minutes or so...we're done with our meal and this is when I realize that the restaurant is REALLY crowded and our waiter is literally missing in action. So we sit for a while and take it all in, identifying other people who are doing the same. Waiting. Watching the people around us who have just sat down, sipping water, hoping they get to order drinks soon.  The dessert menu, when it finally arrived with our flustered waiter, looked good...but ordering yet another course was way too risky. We asked for the check and I decided to check out the bathroom.  On my way down the grand staircase in the middle of the restaurant, I encountered a bus boy carrying a tub of dirty plates and a huge container of ice. Really, is that the only staircase? Because the classiness of the staircase was just downgraded to tacky. I don't want to see what goes on behind the scenes, that's what a back staircase is for. I also don't need to hear the bus boys shouting at each other up and down the stairs. And while we're at it,why there weren't there more bus boys to help my poor waiter who kept running from the second floor to the basement to get wine? Not great planning.  I arrived at the bathroom on the main floor only to find out it's a single stall. Interesting choice since there isn't a bathroom upstairs and the dining rooms are both packed, as is the bar. I guess that would explain why there were only a few sheets of toilet paper left. That can be forgiven. But the size of the garbage can cannot be. It literally was the size of a brown paper lunch bag and was awkwardly positioned in the corner near the toilet not the sink. If I was planning a single stall bathroom that was guaranteed high traffic, I'd probably get a larger can. I'd probably add more stalls too...but apparently those are downstairs in the basement. I wonder how large the garbage can is down there?  Feeling awkward from the bathroom arrangements, I walked back up the stairs only to find that our waiter hadn't returned with our bill. It's not his fault, so I'm really not trying to rip on him...but whomever staffed this place should have thought about the logistics!! We almost left cash and walked out. Another 10 minutes later, we paid our bill...a little on the high side for a mediocre experience. For $28 I could have made my own pork chops with edible sides.  Since we were skipping dessert, I was banking on the fact that there would be candy or mints on the hostess table. On our way down, we did a quick walk by and it was empty. Nada. I mean, I'm not saying a mint would have erased the various transgressions and disappearing waiter, but it would have left me with a better taste in my mouth. No pun intended! I'm not going to totally write 33 Club off , the atmosphere is great, but the food and service need some time. I'll give it 6 months or so and maybe try it again.",0.9981,0.839,0.122,0.039,0.48106731057202773
2009-07-22,4.0,"Jerry Kleiner's new place, 33 Club,  in Old Town, has all the magic of many of his other signature restaurants (Carnivale, Marche, etc) but done in a more understated way. The space alone warrants 4 stars in my book.  Kleiner took an old gym, removed part of the ceiling of the second floor to create a sweeping, open space with 20 foot ceilings, added a grand staircase to the second level with a beautiful oriental runner and furnished the walls and ceiling in rich mahogany. If you liked the chairs at the now closed Room 21- they are back in force at 33 Club right down to the leather seats, the velvet upholstered backs and the Louis Vuitton signature handles.  The artwork is another wow. In the main dining area- there is a piece of modern art by Wesley Kimler that a server told us cost $200,000 alone. (Must have really liked that piece!)  We went on opening night- knowing that not all the kinks would be worked out but knowing that most things would be in place. We were a large group (10) so we were seated upstairs with great views of the main floor dining room.  The menu is American with steaks, chops, chicken and fish. The chef is Daniel Kelly who most recently was at the now closed Avenue M. And the prices? Reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. Entrees were in the low $20 range.  Since there were so many of us, we pretty much were able to taste the full range of the menu. The appetizer winners? The lamb chops, goat cheese stuffed bacon wrapped dates and the crabcake with the avocado salsa.  As for entrees- the Chilean sea bass and the chicken and lobster rose to the top. The steak probably would have as it was perfectly done but it was cold to the touch. And the salmon probably would have as well but it was over done indicating a couple of timing issues in the kitchen as they work to find their cadence. The fries that came with one of the entrees were also way over salted- to the point we couldn't eat them.  And the sides? Well this carb loving girl was in heaven with the ""Macaroni and cheese stuffed baked potato"". It was like the gods knew the two perfect foods to combine. As for the creamed spinach? More spinach than cream which I loved but the creamed spinach aficionados at the table were disappointed.  As for desserts- go with the key lime pie or the peanut brittle sundae- the latter served with two kinds of chocolate sauce that you can pour over it yourself.  Parking in this area is pretty easy- but there is also free valet parking (yes, I said free!)  I loved the understated feel and club like atmosphere. 33 Cub is still so new that there is no sign and the big sweeping velvet curtains for the front windows are not yet hung but they are finding their way in an area that needs a place just like this.  Oh . . and if you know Jerry Kleiner- you know there is always a story connected with the naming of his places. 33 Club? 1933 is the year prohibition was repealed in the US.
