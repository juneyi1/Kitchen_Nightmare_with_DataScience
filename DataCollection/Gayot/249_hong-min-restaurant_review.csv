2008-08-04,5.0,"this here, would be my first review....i was first taken to this place by my cousin angel, back on my first trip to chi-town...we hit it up after a  nite of drinkin' at a club...he told me that the mongolian beef is what u come here for...yup and it sure wasn't the service...the place is/ or was usually packed...yes it has been shut down for the last couple of years now, due to a fire...(more like insurance fraud to me)..i mean how does a place burn down, with the fire station from ""backdraft"" just across  the street..hmmm..smells fishy to me, even tho we are in china town...back to the food...the mongolian beef is prepared deliciously peppered, and the kicker is the crunchy wide noodles...kuzzo says to make sure u tell the waiter u want it crunchy...after many a visits to china town, trekking thru humid heat in the summer, to snowy cold ass winter days with my now wife, and mother of my child, our orders grew larger with the addition of scallops in oyster sauce, and what my black brethren call ""general t-s-o's  chicken""....parking was  a little hard to find, because the meter's in front of the restaurant we're usually taken, but there was a paid lot down the street under the cermak train stop...yup, we've taken the train there before, and have even made it there with a friend visiting from la after a white sox game..shit, when it was open, i made it a point to take any out-of-towners there...its something u had to experience at least once in your life...and that is the reason why i'm doin' a review of a place that closed down..i've seen other people post about this place on the palos hills hong min...i've never been there, but i hear its not the same...there's no entertainment  like having the project residents, which is rite next to the restaurant, come in to pick up their order, and the conversation that ensues between them and the chinese workers..that's worth the price of admission alone...so , that's my first review...and it's of a place that doesnt exist anymore...at least im creative, rite!..and for all u haters..eat-a-dick in advance!",0.9664,0.897,0.082,0.02,0.4230555555555556
