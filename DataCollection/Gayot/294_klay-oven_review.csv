2012-05-19,3.0,"Okay is the best word to describe Klay oven. I almost gave them 3 stars, but I've been able to recreate some dishes I love in my home with much more flavor. Although, I've eaten here on many buffet days, they just don't compare to many of the places near Devon on Chicago's northside. The atmosphere of the place is great for Business lunches, Dates, and or just large groups of people who looking for a first time indian experience. However, if you're looking to experience bold indian flavors and spices then this is not the place for you. I also must add that having been multiple times some days are better than others. Also, you tend to not get the same quality at a buffet which they do at a specific time during the day. So maybe a non buffet hour. I had to add a extra star because they are part of grub hub so you can have things delivered right to your home if you like the food.",0.9761,0.863,0.137,0.0,0.41607142857142854

2012-02-08,5.0,"I cannot thank Klay Oven enough for a wonderful experience here. I had to organize a big lunch for work (about 30 people), and usually the number is never finalized until the day before, or even the day of, meaning I often have to pick places that are easy going, and frankly, able to deal with people showing up last minute. I called Klay Oven before hand to ask for information. They were very friendly and helpful on the phone. Given the fact that they have the buffet with or without our group, I didn't expect them to give me any trouble - but you'd be surprised to find out how many places don't appreciate a big group. They tell me just to call a day or two before hand to give them an estimated number. Two days before the event, I got a call from Klay Oven. They wanted to know how the number of guests. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I organize these events pretty often, and this is the first time a restaurant call me to remind and confirm with me before I call them. It might have been the timing but regardless it gave them a huge plus.  When our group arrived, the customer services could have not been any better. There were more people than expected, and the manager (I assume so because he was older and wearing a jacket) was SUPER accommodating and friendly. He kept track of the guests the whole time and reminded me everytime someone else came in. Our waiter was super attentive and my water was never empty. He made quite a few trip too as some people found the food a bit spicy.  The food itself was delicious. They had lots of option both meat and vegetarian. I remembered 3 types of vegetarian curry/potato and 4-5 other meat options. Along with salad (delicious chickpea salad), appetizers, 2 types of rice (white and spiced), and nan. There were plenty of food - a great choice if you are new to Indian cuisine or if you just want to eat it all in one meal. I tried all I could eat (that was anything without meat), and nothing failed to impress me. They also had 2 types of desert: kheer and mango kulfi (I think, I didn't try this so it might have not been).  The kheer was very good as well and it cured my craving! From the beginning to the end, everything was perfect: food, ambiance, decor, services, and even location (less than 5 mins walk from the Brown line). I'd recommend this place to everyone, and if you have a big group, don't hesitate, contact them!",0.9974,0.794,0.18,0.026,0.5302950558213717

We made reservations on  gdine.com  and for twenty dollars and some change, we enjoyed a lovely 3 course menu. Our waiter, Joel, was absolutely fantastic and made our dining experience that much better.  I had the vegetable samosa for starters and it was delicious. The plate came with two giant samosas the size of my hand. They were a bit spicy, but so great! The husband had spicy shrimp skewers and he gobbled them up as soon as he got them. For the main course, I had the chicken tikki masala. Super delicious. I asked for mine to be mild and Joel made sure it was! The dish also came with rice and naan. Again, super delicious. It's served family style so you can taste other people's dishes, if they are so inclined to share.  For dessert, I ordered the mango ice cream and it was perfect. Light, tasty, and a perfect compliment to the more spicier parts of the meal. The husband ordered rice pudding but only took one bite- he wasn't too big of a fan.

2011-12-12,3.0,"We were there on a Sunday for their lunch buffet where we received a zero level of customer service. No, there were not rude or anything. In fact there wasn't a chance for them to be rude because the staff hardly uttered a word. We were seated by the host (or maybe manager, since he wore a blazer) and brought to our table. And then he walked away. Not a single word telling us that we were welcome to start the buffet at anytime. OK, so we started the buffet on our own. There was only one other employee there who acted as the ""busboy"" and we ended up ordering our masala teas from him at the end of our meal. And then the host/manager appeared again at our table only to drop of the check, again without uttering a single word, and then walked away. Later, he came back to our table, swooped up the check + money and walked away, again without uttering a single word. Not even a thank you. And then we left. No byes or thank you please come again.  So yes, literally zero customer service at Klay Oven. Oh what a difference in atmosphere during the Karma Kitchen events held at Klay Oven on every second Sunday of the month.

The bad: the flavors aren't as good as India House's and they use lower quality meat as there were a few pieces of lamb that I was not a fan of.

2011-05-12,4.0,"Thanks to Groupon and Klay Oven for the offer.  Otherwise, I may not have known about nor cared to venture downtown for Indian food.  Why should I when Devon Avenue is within reasonable distance of my residence.   When you don't know or aren't sure when dealing with a cuisine you don't often eat; do yourself a favor and look up reviews or ask for a recommendation.  If some of the other reviewers did so, I think they would've dealt with far less problems.  But that's only half of it.  Read on. Nice atmosphere which is welcoming with a serene pond at the foot of the entrance.  Music is ambient and usually some sort of Middle East folk or Indian instrumentals.  The restaurant is dimly lit whatever time of the day it is and has a cooling feel to it.  Clean and comfortable.  Deeper inside, there are vibrant colored walls and detailed areas of seating perfect for that special date or party.     Klay Oven's greatest failure is wait and host services.  Unfortunately the heavy of this burden falls on a few guys, the hardest working in my opinion which is the runners.  I wish I knew this fellow's name, I'd say he's Mexican with an accent, a sharp guy with details and knows the menu thoroughly.  You know when you try to speak another person's language or order ethnic entrees, how people of that background repeat back the same words you spoke as if to hear it in a proper sound and then acknowledge it.  This dude did that to me(!), not once but twice!  I'm Indian, but a Southie and not a Northie, terms which carry more meaning to Indians.  Significant difference is that we southie's would pronounce some entrée names differently than those from the North.  Most Indian restaurants found anywhere are typically North Indian in cuisine, FYI. Since my first visit I've been back a couple times for the food which is stellar, but I've been boring and ordering the same dishes over and over.  First let me reiterate that the host and waiters are tediously slow and I'm not quite sure what their role is other than wasting our time.  I walked in on a Sunday just after they opened and another time during early evening on a week night.  Both times the runners were running their asses off helping customers.  (Literally running at one point.)  Not sure where the host or main waiters were.  I'd guess having a smoke or doing their hair.  No offense, just I assume that when a business opens for the day, a restaurant already has staff ready to go.  This place is located downtown, so I would assume some level of professionalism.  Yes?  Though not the case.    On that Sunday around early afternoon, we waited for fifteen minutes plus before someone came over and welcomed us.  Another five minutes to get a table in a place which was only 5% full at the time.  Ridiculous.  The runner was handling their phones, taking phone orders, trying to assist new customers as they entered and fill drink orders all at the same time.  Insane and all the while, new walk-in's grew more and more tired of the treatment.   After much wait and trepidation, we were happily surprised with the outcome of the food.  Every entrée was tasteful and kept our taste interests piqued.   A few memorable entrees to mention:  Aloo tikki, fried potato patties.  Aloo samosa, vegetarian samosa.  (I don't ever order non-veg samosa, because it's usually a waste of money.)  Mila Jhula because it's an appetizer plate and I can't pass on the opportunity of having one.  Poori which is a large circular puffy bread different to naan and great for dipping.  Though it can be oily.   Many of the chicken and lamb dishes are very good.  My favorites are on the seafood menu, such as lobster masala and (I think it's called) Jheenga nariyal.  The latter was composed of tiger prawns which are butterflied, spiced and grilled to perfection.  Tiger prawns so big that they are as big as your fist.  Four pieces offered.  The lobster masala had some big chunks of meat and was an excellent dish we fought over finishing the following day.  Not to be mistaken with crab masala which I am told is not taste worthy and they are considering removal from the menu. A few entrees can make your bill rise pretty quickly, so it's best to inquire with a waiter on how much food is needed to fill your lot.  The best deal for the new walk in is the buffet.  On one occasion I spent almost $120 dollars on top of a Groupon for three people with leftovers for home.  Another time almost seventy dollars for two and of these two visits, these were the charges without booze!  I think some of their pricing is far too high, but then again, I haven't a clue how much their rent is per month. For good parking, I typically find some by Doughnut vault or park in the garage and I think the restaurant will comp you on it.",0.9941,0.827,0.114,0.06,0.5018348318348319

I went there in the evening and didn't let them know who I was. My friend and I had a very pleasant dinner on their patio. The food was good, about where you'd want it to be vis a vis the price. Overall I judge Klay Oven to be a solid choice for competent Indian in the neighborhood. It's good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it, like I would for, say, Sabri Nahari on Devon. I never really did have complaints with Klay Oven's food, but rather with their handling of the Groupon. In my recent visit the service was as it should be: I didn't think twice about it. Three or three and a half stars is about what I think they deserve when they are not behaving oddly inflexible toward their patrons. I'd definitely go back during lunch if I was in the neighborhood. Kudos to their management for reaching out, I'm glad they did.  Original review: I'm very upset at this place. After buying their Groupon, the Klay Oven folks did everything in their power to stop me from using it. I can't even remember all of the weird reasons and excuses they threw at me: the kitchen was closed to non-buffet patrons for some reason, or it couldn't be used because they were privileging some other function, or because of some alternative vegetarian restaurant idea that didn't appeal to me, and so on. And every time the manager/host was completely inflexible and unwilling to work with me, which was annoying after driving all the way there, parking, etc. Shame on them for treating customers that way.

He recommended the shrimp masala and chicken green masala over what we initially ordered (shrimp biryani and chicken tikka--generic I know). We also ordered Mango Lassis to start, and I have to say, they were the best I had. The texture was nice, and they used fresh yogurt. The yellow dal was fantastic, smooth and mild. The bread was amazing (it was 5 bucks a piece, we would've ordered more if it wasnt so expensive for a small piece). The lamb was amazingly seasoned and very filling. The chicken was good and spicy and I'm glad we ordered that over the norm. Now, the shrimp was a bit disappointing ONLY because I think we were in the mood for a biryani.

2011-03-21,1.0,"STAY AWAY. I have never had so many problems trying to use a Groupon. One would think that if a restaurant offers a Groupon, they will be receptive to receiving it. Not so. Not only was the service incompetent, but the servers are indifferent about it.  My fiance and I both love Indian food, so we each bought a Groupon. Four attempts later, we have not been able to use one without a problem. FIRST ATTEMPT: Arrived for lunch on a Saturday with Mr. Fiance. They informed us that they have a lunch buffet. It was much cheaper than the menu options, so we said that we would do that. We then asked our server if we could order an additional dish to go (for dinner), since the buffet for two wouldn't add up to the $40 Groupon. He said that was fine. So we both got the buffet and I ordered a mango lassi and lamb vindaloo to go. When the check came, the same server informed us that we couldn't use the Groupon on the lunch buffet. Normally that would be fair, if we hadn't already discussed using the Groupon with the server! What!! We asked to speak with his manager, and was told unapologetically that rules were rules, and that the first server was mistaken about the Groupon but there was nothing he could do. I cancelled the lamb vindaloo but had already started in on the mango lassi. The entire affair was worth $30 down the drain. SECOND ATTEMPT: I returned with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night. We ordered off the regular menu and everything went fine. The bill came to a little over $40. Since I was providing the Groupon, my friend offered to pick up the rest of the tab / tip. But, our server informed us that he could not accept a credit card for the remainder of the bill if we used a Groupon. What??? He said that when you use a Groupon, the remainder is cash only. We asked to speak with his manager, who confirmed this absurdity. My friend told him that it was illegal for him to impose such unfounded conditions and that she would report him to the Better Business Bureau. He shrugged. THIRD ATTEMPT: My birthday. No bigs. Mr. Fiance and I arrived for lunch again. Already knowledgeable about how buffets and Groupons don't mix at Klay Oven, we agreed ahead of time that we would order off the regular menu and finally shed our cursed Groupon. When we arrived, however, our server informed us that they were catering a special event that day, and so we couldn't order off the regular menu - - we could only do the buffet. But they couldn't take the Groupon for it. Since we were already there, we decided to chuck another $30 down the drain on the buffet. FOURTH ATTEMPT: ""Hello, welcome to Karma Kitchen!"" Er, what? When I heard this upon walking in, I thought that Klay Oven's nasty tricks had finally caught up with them, and they had gone out of business. Karma, indeed. But nope, instead, the servers informed us of a new thing they have going on, the first Sunday of every month I think, where you pay nothing for your meal because someone already paid for you the month before. You have the option of paying for someone else's meal the next month. Exasperated, we asked if we could put our Groupon towards someone else's meal and be done with it. They said yes. Hallelujah! But upon sitting down, we were presented not with Klay Oven's normal menu, but with a ""Karma Kitchen"" menu, which had only vegetarian options. Since the fiance and I are both paleo (basically a high-fat, high-meat, low-carb diet), this was untenable. Also, what a scam! No reasonably-sized person could eat $40 worth of vegetarian food in one sitting because it costs NOTHING to make! No wonder it's free (although I must suggest that Karma Kitchen seems like a very dubious business model). In short, we decided not to go through with it because (1) we wanted to eat meat, (2) this is not normally a vegetarian restaurant, so we felt that we were misled, (3) we could not possibly have eaten the whole Groupon's worth of spinach and would thus lose money, and (4) we were just generally really pissed off that Klay Oven consistently finds sneaky ways to get us to pay for food we never wanted. We just wanted to use our Groupons. And after four attempts, we have not been able to do so. I want a refund.",0.788,0.833,0.085,0.082,0.4646310479643812

I asked if this was a possible factor in refusing to seat us in a more comfortable location?

I had the palak paneer (good but not spicy enough), Mom had the Chicken Tikka Masala (very tasty, smoky flavor and spicy) and Dad had the Quail--I think also in a Masala sauce (had an heavy sauce that overpowered the taste of the meat--Dad said it could have been chicken, lamb, beef, etc., the sauce made it impossible to taste the meat).  We also ordered a bottle of wine that was well presented and a basket of Naan that was hot and fresh.  I loved the dark atmosphere. What a lovely place to have a date.

The sauce was super dried and it was lacking probably 100 spices/ingredients. Like the Samosa- it was very flat and the taste was very single note. Its a disappointment.  Lamb Curry- My bf got this and the curry itself was good but the lamb was beyond dry. I suspect that it was leftover from lunch or last night and was re-grilled then dumped into the sauce.

I first dined here about 3 years ago and have tried other places... none match up to Klay Oven - especially the lackluster, overpriced India House located nearby.  What to try: samosas are good, mila jhula appetizer plate, good vindaloos, any seafood dish, tandoori mixed grill, channa masala, and gulab jamun for dessert. This is just what I've tried; I'm sure the rest of the menu is always appetizing.  Klay Oven also offers ambiance unmatched by any other Indian establishment in the city.

The food served at the Klay Oven was a little blander than at a typical Indian restaurant probably because they cater more to a western clientele.  There were no Indians dining at the restaurant.  For a traditional Indian dinner I would stick to the restaurants on Devon.  However, to impress business clients, the Klay Oven would be my Indian restaurant of choice.",0.8406,0.881,0.078,0.041,0.44074074074074077

I asked the server which dish was most comparable to a traditional Chicken Curry and he recommended the Bhuna Chicken.  I also ordered the garlic naan and a half order of basmati rice based on previous reviewers' recommendations. When the food arrived, it was brought out on a rolling tray (a nice touch).  The portions were actually quite generous based on previous Indian restaurants I had visited.  The Bhuna Chicken was delicious -- as was the basmati rice and garlic naan.

It was a feast. The service experience was unusual.  It's a long story, but the gist is that there were problems with a missed entree and an erroneous bill.  Each time, at first they resisted (seeming to disagree that there was even a problem), then relented and fixed the problem.  At the end, the manager/server comped the entire meal, which was way overboard for the problems that we'd had.  Then my friend and I both felt badly because the restaurant was mostly empty.

I deducted another star for the hapless waitstaff.  My table ordered two servings of samosas.  A different waiter delivered one plate to us, and our other plate was dropped at another table.   When our main courses came, they were lined up on the table without placing the proper dish in front of the proper diner.  One brave member of our group smelled each basket of flatbread in an attempt to determine which bread went with which patron. If you go, I recommend taking up smoking for roughly six years beforehand so your taste buds are deadened enough to appreciate the total lack of subtlety in the flavor.  Oh, and have each member of your party sit at a different table so there's a shot at getting the right dish delivered in front of the right person.",0.9239,0.887,0.086,0.027,0.5877164502164502

2008-08-24,4.0,"I am in no way a competent judge, but I think this is pretty tasty. A Indian (and Jain) friend of mine insisted we try it for dinner one night, and as he is pretty critical of Indian food, I figured if he liked it, it would be worth a shot. He's right - it's really quite good. We started with vegetable pakora, which had a nice mix of crisp fried onion and tasty potato. they were light on the peas that sometimes get included (and I like the peas) but they were quite delicious. Their mint/coriander chutney was pretty tasty as well. For entrees, I had my standard measuring stick, the lamb vindaloo. My friend ordered a dry grilled paneer dish, the name of which I don't remember, and we shared some dal makhani. The lamb was very good, tender and flavorful, but light on the potato. I love the potato. Plenty of sauce, which I love to sop up with breads. The vindaloo had excellent heat, which sometimes is missing when the guy ordering is not Indian. I try my best to keep up, and this was just right. The dal was also very good. Not quite as spicy as I would have liked, and with pinto beans. I've never gotten consensus on whether the addition of pintos is accurate, but I want to think it's not. Either way, I prefer the dal without - What I make for myself doesn't have any. I managed to make the dal plenty hot with the addition of some wicked jalapenos that my friend requested. Finally, the paneer was awesome - easily the standout. Skewers of bell pepper, onions, tomatoes, and squash, with big cubes of seasoned and grilled mild cheese, served dry. All wonderful. I'd never had paneer without some kind of sauce, so this was new for me, and I'll have it again, for sure. My only complaint is the price - as with most Indian restaurants, the price spiraled pretty high by the time we ordered a couple different kinds of bread (which might have been overkill, but what the hey) and some basmati rice (which was good - with saffron and peas). Oh - and I didn't see khir on the dessert menu. I love khir...and I can't turn it down...but none in sight! I have heard lunch service is very slow - in fact, the same day I went for dinner, two other coworkers went for lunch, and it took nearly two hours.

2006-10-23,4.0,"Oh, Klay Oven, you looked so empty and forlorn when my friends and I stormed in after work recently.  I'm so happy we could liven you up a bit, but I must say I'm surprised you didn't have very many other dinner patrons.  Do you cater more to the lunch crowd?  It's all silliness, really, because I would eat at your table at any time of day. We were a party of 6 and each ordered something absolutely delicious to share.  The garlic naan was awwwesome and everyone really seemed to enjoy the ""light orange"" and the ""dark orange"" chicken--which I believe translated to murg makhani and murg vindaloo.  The service was attentive, we were all pleasantly full by the end of the meal and I would definitely go back with a group for another shared meal. Besides, if I want to write an educated review, I should probably find out the names of what all I ate... ;)",0.988,0.756,0.221,0.023,0.5859375000000001
2006-10-15,3.0,"Ate here twice in one week (Wed and Fri) for their $10 lunch buffet.  Extremely close (1/2 block) to the Holiday Inn Merchandise Mart, especially if you exit through the right door.  Buffet seems to change daily.  Wed had eggplant, so I was in love.  The idli was the best I've ever had, more like a rice pancake and less like the usual thick, spongy tasteless rice thing at other buffets.  Coconut chutney also very, very good.  But idli doesn't make a buffet, of course.  Wed's lamb curry had thick, tender, lean chunks, but Fri's lamb curry had thin strips of lamb.  Same sauce, but the type of meat made a huge difference to the overall dish.  Wed's curry chicken was excellent, but Fri's chicken was a tandoori (white meat) chicken in a reddish buttery sauce, which makes it repetitive, if you are already having their tandoori chicken (available daily, it seems.)  In any case, hit or miss, depending on the selections.  Oh, yeah, hubby got moderate food poisoning here on Friday, before our flight back, which made it a miserable plane trip home for him, hence the 3 stars instead of 4.  Of course, if I got food poisoning, it would have been 1 star.  We didn't eat exactly the same selections, so I wonder which dish it was.  Extreme convenience makes up for the threat of food poisoning, so will probably go back.  Wish me luck. Update: after eating at more Indian lunch buffets around the country and then coming back to this place, I think this place is my favorite for tandoori chicken.  It has a nice charbroiled taste, even though the individual pieces could be larger.  Has the best Idli, of course.  But this place is probably a dollar or two too expensive, hence the three stars instead of four.  Also, when eating alone, it's best and most comfortable to eat after the lunch rush, and not when it opens.",0.9731,0.766,0.149,0.084,0.5349430641821945
2006-07-10,3.0,"Really a delightful experience.  I have been for dinner many times and find the food to be consistently good.  They just remodled their scene and moved it from very traditional to a bit more contemporary with engaging, clubbier music.  The scene does not, however, overwhelm the food.  True, it is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for with quality ingredients and great service.",0.9107,0.767,0.211,0.022,0.6490740740740741
2006-06-25,3.0,"Very good place to go for Indian food. Not terribly expensive, and they give you a lot of food.  The service was poor-the waiter seemed annoyed when neither of us wanted a drink right away and snatched our wine list from the table. I had to go in search of one 5 minutes later once I was settled in and ready for a drink. It took over 10 minutes to get a soda. But the food was delicious and if I get a craving, I will go back.",0.4927,0.824,0.106,0.07,0.5394642857142857
2006-04-02,3.0,"I really enjoyed my dining experience here, but I'd have to say that it's a bit overpriced and they were undergoing remodeling when I went.  The samosas were perfectly cooked and is a really good way to start off the meal.  I thought the service was superb and loved it when they pulled up with the cart full of food and they plated everything at the table.  I'd recommend this place for a nice evening out.",0.9865,0.675,0.325,0.0,0.807142857142857
2005-12-15,4.0,Indian cuisine with some table side service depending what you order. I recommend the seafood. The naan is good...there's multiple varieties. Nice decor. What's a little weird is the server was wearing big suspenders over a T-shirt. Food is good and you will not leave hungry.,0.787,0.779,0.192,0.029,0.5333333333333333

2005-09-27,4.0,"You can tell be the decor that this used to be a Japanese restaurant, which is pretty cool. Not only is it the best Indian food in the loop, but since New Laroche closed, it's the only Indian food I know of in the loop. And people -- all you can eat lunch buffet for $8.95 is NOT expensive!

2005-09-15,3.0,Its pretty pricey here for DELIVERY.. they have good nan and really good grilled chicken though.. i'd recommend actually going here to eat instead of ordering in because if you're going to spend you might as well have the ambiance,0.9118,0.72,0.28,0.0,0.6500000000000001
2005-08-05,3.0,"Definitely not the best Indian food around, but their lunch buffet does a pretty decent job of fulfilling my craving for a good,spicy meal. Very reasonably priced, the buffet has a lot of great dishes, including a bunch of vegetarian ones. The decor of this restraunt is really great, and I actually appreciate that more than the food. The waiters are friendly and accomodating. This place is a good stop for a pretty filling lunch at a very reasonable price in the city.",0.9855,0.628,0.323,0.048,0.6328205128205128
