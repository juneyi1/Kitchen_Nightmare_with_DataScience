2017-02-15,4.0,"WOW I found Kyoto Steak-Sushi Restaurant on Groupon.  They had a $45 dollar meal for $22 dollars.  At the time there was a further reduction of $5 for a discounted meal above $20 dollars.  So basically a $45 dollar meal cost $17.   This restaurant is located in the heart of Lincoln Park on Fullerton just east of Clark.  I guess it's a little off of the main stream of traffic, but it's literally located across the street from Lincoln Park on the south side of Fullerton Avenue between Clark Street and Commonwealth. From the outside there's not much to draw people in off of the street and you could easily go by it without even noticing it, which I have done literally 100's of times.  In fact I even drove by it tonight even though I knew the general location.   Once we got to the restaurant and went inside there weren't many people inside.  In fact only 2 other tables were occupied.  It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant ambiance, low lighting with a color scheme of burgundy accent walls, light beige taupe (identical to my living room) w/dark brown tables.  They also have some nice ornamental wall sconces with ornamental sculptured metal intertwined that serve as light supports as well as integral holders of the light sconce to the wall.   We ordered 2 fish dishes and some miso soup.  The soup came out in the coolest little bowls with matching lids, served on a cool little slate serving tray.  After that the soup was average, but the seaweed/kelp inside was very good. My wife ordered the miso glazed cod which was over cooked and rubbery.  This dish also came with oyster mushrooms which were excellent & asparagus.  I ordered the crispy striped bass which was excellent, light salted with a crispy charred skin that added to the texture and flavor.  It also came with bok choy w/toasted almonds w/a ginger sauce w/a soy meringue.  This was ok, but the crispy striped bass was the star of this dish.  We were also got an order of creamy garlic mashed potatoes w/green onions that were to die for.  I savored every mouthful of this dish.  Our waiter David was outstanding.  From start to finish his service and attention to detail were outstanding.  He had a good knowledge of the menu items and he was on point with the service.  That's why I gave him 25% tip.   The one critique I have and this isn't the servers fault was the kitchens turn around time was extremely slow considering there were only 3 tables occupied.  I didn't time it, but it probably took between 20-25 minutes to get our main dishes.  Overall we had a very nice meal (especially with the Groupon discount)",0.9959,0.846,0.137,0.017,0.6257692307692307

The environment was cute & cozy.  The prices were fair...not cheap & not too pricy.   The new restaurant is more Japanese steakhouse than sushi restaurant, with pricy cuts of meat on the menu.  The sushi menu consists mostly of rolls, not individual pieces of sushi.  We ordered sushi that they used to make but is no longer not on the menu.  On a busier night, they may not have done this for us.  New rolls have been added while others have been removed.  The prices appear to have gone up too.  The new location -- while it has outdoor seating which will be fantastic in the summer -- is really odd inside.  I am not sure what to make of it...too big, strange layout, really bad looking floors.   We left there underwhelmed.  While the service was very good, the sushi & rolls were not up to the old Kyoto standard...not super flavorful. We may/may not be going back for a 2nd chance when there are so many good sushi restaurants in Lincoln Park/Lakeview.  It's very sad.  We miss the old Kyoto!",0.3817,0.774,0.116,0.11,0.5083063973063972

For our party of 14, we pre-ordered miso soup, gyoza and edamame appetizers, and a selection of rolls; all were pronounced excellent. Guests chose between the chicken teriyaki and salmon entrees. The entrees were served hot and perfectly prepared as nearly as I can tell from diners' reports and my own experience. The chicken, for example, was tender and moist, and was served with rice and a slightly spicy broccoli preparation that was delicious.  Those who ate the salmon pronounced it excellently prepared and deliciously flavored. A team of servers kept our tables free of unneeded plates, and our wine glasses full with the beverages we brought in.  They served the birthday cake (which we also brought in) after the presentation with candles and happy birthday song.  Proprietors Tony and Sammy have a created a neighborhood gem in Lincoln Park; when they can offer valet parking it will be perfect!",0.9919,0.746,0.24,0.014,0.7956140350877193
2016-10-16,5.0,"First and foremost, this is the first time that I have made a reservation through the Yelp website! I had no idea that you could do that! That was so helpful to me because I wanted to make a reservation for a Saturday evening but the restaurant did not open until 5pm that day, and had no other OpenTable or website option available to make reservations. I will definitely be using that service again and I am very glad Yelp has that available! Now about the restaurant: I used a Groupon here with my boyfriend and it was an excellent deal! Really high quality sushi and a reasonable price for 4 orders of specialty sushi rolls (8 pieces in each order) with the Groupon. We ordered the Love Boat special, which is normally $69. Our waiter was kind enough to bring us a free dessert, since he said that one of the rolls in the Love Boat special was not available that evening, and he didn't realize that until after we had our meal. My boyfriend and I had not even noticed at all, so it was just a pleasant surprise to have a free dessert! They also have a $5 corkage fee (which is not bad for a Chicago restaurant on a Saturday night), so we were able to bring our own bottle of wine. The restaurant has a gorgeous atmosphere (right in the middle of the beautiful architecture near Lincoln Park Conservatory). I definitely want to return but will probably not be able to order as much sushi as we were able to with the Groupon, since it is on the pricier side.

I ordered a steak for myself and to my great surprise the steak was cooked dead on the money medium rare. Our boat of sushi came and was almost immediately devoured by me and my crew.

2016-05-29,2.0,"I live within a block of the restaurant and I went there with lots of expectations based on reviews. My night did not turn out too great.  Dinner was on a Thursday night with restaurant about 25% full. The food was great with good quality sushi. We ordered a few rolls to share. Halfway into the dinner, our waiter disappeared. Our food then came in with an extra roll we did not order. The server said they will take it back to the kitchen and credit the check.  We finished the dinner without a waiter. For about 20 minutes, it was impossible to find a person to pay the check. The check comes in, the unordered roll is still on it. Then, in another surprise, the menu prices do not match the check. Granted, a tuna roll for $6.95 coming on the check at $7.00 is not a big deal, but why treat your customers as idiots?  At the end, it turns out the waiters shift was over, and he just left without turning the table over to anyone and the restaurant was short-staffed. No explanation for the over charging on menu price of the extra roll. My view is that a restaurant review is (2 stars for food, 2 stars for service, and 1 star for ambiance). In this case, the food wins the 2 stars and nothing else.  Will be picking another restaurant next time - so many great sushi restaurants in Chicago.",0.9655,0.861,0.11,0.029,0.3999999999999999

It seemed like they were missing some of the rolls I loved from when they were on Lincoln but I'm not positive on that. The menu is significantly different now as they also offer steaks and other entrees but not necessarily in a bad way.  I do miss and prefer the old location- the one on Lincoln felt like a hidden spot and was more intimate & cozy. It was also closer to me. However, the new place is very nice and sort of fancy, and if I had never been to the one on Lincoln I wouldn't have any complaints with the new spot. It's still BYOB too.

2016-05-15,2.0,"Wish I had a better review to write for this place. This is the new location for Kyoto, which was previously in a basement location on Lincoln by Wrightwood. I'd been several times and the food & service were both great. This new location unfortunately has been rebranded very differently from the previous one -- it's a Japanese steakhouse menu with apps and high end beef cuts on the front pages, and sushi resigned to the back portion. Not what we had in mind or remembered from the place we liked. (Side note - they've definitely raised their prices, too.) The layout is kind of strange as well. The restaurant has very high ceilings with tables interspersed throughout. It has a very open feel to it, almost so open that you'd think 'this wasn't a restaurant before, was it?' We were placed in an odd side-room booth which we shared intimately with one other table. The service was incredibly slow. Maybe one of the longest waits for food that I can remember in Chicago. 30 minutes to get a drink. 45 minutes + before our apps came. I felt so bad for the table next to us, they were there before we sat down, and must've waited 90 minutes before they got food. They looked furious. You'd think a restaurant undergoing a rebranding would try to get these things right, but maybe they're just working out the kinks. The apps were fine, miso soup, edamame and seaweed salad were good. Tried the oyster shooters, yuck! Very very vinegary. Same with the tako su, which was very good but became a pool of vinegar by the end. Sushi was really just OK - eel rolls were alright, same with the yellow tail. My friend's roll had a large eel bone in it which was very painfully caught in her mouth -- ouch!! This area has so many options for BYOB sushi (this location is BYOB) with more casual vibes that I'd be hard pressed to recommend Kyoto for a chill sushi dinner in the area.",0.9524,0.843,0.102,0.055,0.45684759156187726

At the old location, I hosted so many birthday parties and dinners, that the staff actually knew my birthday :-) How great is that? But change is hard for me, and I was worried about the new move. Would the menu be the same? Would I still get the same 5-star service? Would there still be a private area similar to the back room at the old location for special events?  Yes to all of the above and then some! When my friends and I went to visit the new location, Tony immediately recognized us and gave us a full tour of the new restaurant. The dining room is much larger and is beautiful! He also explained plans for the future, including the opening of a full bar and outdoor patio! Awesome! He reassured us that the menu still has all of our old favorites (can you say Crunch Maki?!) but also highlighted some of the new additions. I was disappointed at first because we weren't greeted with the cucumber salad that was a staple at the old location. But once Tony heard me mention it, he brought out a huge serving for the table! So kind. We loved that.  We are huge fans of Kyoto, and even more so with the new location.

Lastly we ended our dinner with gooey almond cake and the chocolate mouse which were both heavenly and came with home made ice cream.

Their oyster shooters are fabulous.  On the plus side they'll have a dining al fresco option soon which will be amazing with great people watching on Fullerton just off Clark Street.  Another great plus is their expanded menu which includes more appetizers, entrée steaks and desserts made in house.  We were treated to one of those desserts which was an almond cake with apples and ice cream made in-house.  It was delicious.   My meals at Kyoto never disappoint and when I leave I can't wait to go back.

I went to the new location last Friday with a large group, from reading the new reviews I didn't know what to expect: 1. The food was excellent, the sushi was even fresher, the presentation was better and the flavor profiles were great. 2. The new location is a much better dinning room, the have real chop sticks and napkins, real crystal wine glasses and new furniture. The decor is minimalist with red accents and really nice old granite floors. My favorite parts were the extremely clean new restrooms and the beautiful ceilings with a pattern. 3. They had almost all of the old rolls and they have also added a few seafood entrees of which I think the halibut collars were the best and about 5 different types of steak with some really good sides. 4. I read some reviews that said their menu was small but I didn't see that unless they changed it. Some said the food overpriced, I did some research before dining there and the food is very well in line with the other less classy restaurants in the neighborhood and very low for the steaks compared to the steakhouses in Chicago. 5.

I realize these aesthetics aren't important to everyone but being in the service industry for half my life I appreciate the small details and the effort it takes to maintain a sleek environment. Especially when your average sushi joint in the city is just going to throw a paper napkin and disposable chopsticks on the table and call it good. Not Kyoto. They make sure the quality of the table set matches the quality of their food and service.  Speaking of food... My girlfriend and I started off with the Lobster Tempura. The breading was light so it didn't take away from the flavor of the lobster and added a nice texture. It was served with 3 dipping sauces that were delicious. There was a garlic aioli, BBQ-esque sauce with a touch of vinegar and a spicy mayo. We also ordered some Otoro nigiri, edamame, the Kyoto and Creamy rolls and the dry aged Ribeye.  The creamy roll had a velvety texture and was wrapped in avocado!  I love avocado and it looked like they used an entire avocado to wrap this roll!! The ribeye was cooked to a beautiful medium rare and had great marbling. At 22oz it was big enough to share. It paired nicely with our Prisoner Zinfandel (Kyoto is BYOB!!) The service was great. My water was never less than half full, the food came out in a timely fashion and our server did a fantastic job of checking in to ensure the dishes were prepared to our liking but he was not intrusive or over bearing. My girlfriend and I were able to carry great conversation while the staff took care of our dining needs. The manager Sami even checked in on us to ensure the quality of our experience. I always respect an establishment that has managers and owners who care enough to personally speak to their guests to let them know their patronage is appreciated.  The prices are fair for the quality of product that is offered along with the upscale aesthetics and service. This isn't a swing by for a quick lunch kind of spot. This is somewhere you take your significant other for a night out. Or an out-of-towner when you want to show them the high caliber cuisine Chicago has to offer. It's nice to have an elevated sushi and steak spot in the neighborhood that offers prime food options without forcing me to travel downtown and break the bank with overly inflated prices.

Prices were quite high and not what we expected from our old favorite Kyoto. We ordered two appetizers: grilled prawns and the fried octopus. Both were not at all what we were expecting. Only 2 shrimp prawns that were quite difficult to eat, and 4 stuffed & breaded with a tiny octopus meat inside... Just left us completely underwhelmed. Onto the sushi: my boyfriend was really wanting some sashimi but with a menu that didn't list out the descriptions for the types of fish and at $5 for one piece, he decided it wasn't worth it and to split rolls with me. We went with a Kyoto classic Spicy Tuna Takito for $16 and two original rolls of Salmon Avocado and one the boyfriend ordered...

2016-02-23,2.0,"RIP Kyoto. Fans of the original restaurant are going to be very disappointed by the new menu. They've eliminated the majority of their rolls in order to focus on steaks and chops. Prices were also raised. We arrived for an 8:30 reservation and weren't seated until 8:50. After ordering we had a 40 minute wait for our food. I ordered the duck breast, which was cooked well and tasted great. However, it came with no sides except for some sauce. I was very disappointed to leave the restaurant hungry. Overall, it was nothing like the original place and somewhere we don't plan to return to.",-0.1925,0.799,0.093,0.108,0.6649350649350649
2016-02-23,5.0,Even my picky fiancé who doesn't like raw fish will go here with me and eat their vegetable and non fish rolls. The staff has always been excellent; the corking fee per bottle is a little annoying but we ended up going for drinks after/before instead to avoid it.  Never had any problems with food. **I will say that I have not been here since they changed locations but I will report back if anything has drastically changed.,-0.7398,0.854,0.029,0.117,0.5723076923076923

I was so excited to eat copious amounts of their food that I will NEED to come back soon to do a more thorough analysis of the food. But really though, you can NOT go wrong with anything at this place!",0.7178,0.79,0.156,0.053,0.5435064935064935
