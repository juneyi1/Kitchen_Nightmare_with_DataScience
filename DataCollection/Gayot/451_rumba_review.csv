2012-09-18,4.0,"I experienced Rumba before they moved and I had a Groupon for the Tapas for two with two drinks. The Mojitos were very refreshing and made just right it didn't taste like a mix...so I would say they have a great mixologist. I loved when the Salsa dancers came up and start dancing then tried to teach us to Salsa, I can't say I could keep up...lol, I don't want to lie I had more than two left feet and when I tried to give up and sit down one of the ladies came and got me to get back up and try again. Now, I still didn't do any better but it was lots of fun. We did end up buying a couple of more drinks and two more Tapas because we were still hungry...lmao Although, I enjoyed my experience I won't be back because it is a tad bit out of my price range to spend for mini dishes, but I wish this establishment all the best and I say everyone should experience this place at least once!",0.9725,0.845,0.131,0.024,0.4632119514472456
2012-08-04,5.0,"I am so sad to see that Rumba closed! I hope that they open up again.  This was an excellent place for Saturday night salsa dancing. They had a vibrant and mixed crowd, live music, a great lay-out with tables surrounding the smallish wooden dance floor plus a coat check. It was a little packed, but understandably so. Rumba, please come back!",0.8691,0.767,0.199,0.034,0.4484848484848485
2012-04-06,5.0,"FYI this place is not closed forever - it's only temporarily closed as they are moving to another location; so do not fret, my pets!  Came here on a Friday for the first time, loved it so much, came back the next night... which happened to be the last night they were open! The Location (5): All the way down West Hubbard (literally all the way down by the chocolate factory), Rumba was like a little hideaway.  A discreet, quiet location, yet when you reach the front of the restaurant, you know you're in for a treat.  At least I did! The Space (5): Playful yet elegant, very vibrant.  You walk in and it kind of feels like you're attending an event.  As a dancer, I really, really love that. The Service (4.5): The week I was in town was Restaurant Week.  Go figure.  I didn't know this, so getting a reservation anywhere good was nearly impossible.  I literally stalked this place.  I actually got to know a few of the hostesses - the only reason I was able to enjoy Rumba.  Twice!  I felt so bad, but so grateful at the same time for the [kind of reluctant] customer service.  Reluctant because they were so busy, I sometimes felt rushed to talk.  But hello, it Restaurant Week AND their last week before closing... and there I was trying to get a table their last two night, haha.  THANK YOU, LADIES!  Post-dinner, service at the bar was slow.  I think another bartender was needed. My Server (5): Natasha.  Yes - she is so awesome, she deserves a separate category.  On Friday, we were seated in her section (the bar area - which wasn't even full which was so weird because we couldn't get reservation).  Upon arriving at 6:30p), we were told by the hostess that they needed the table for an 8:30p reservation.  Natasha was so cute and polite the way she would ""check-in"" with us to make sure we were aware of the time, but didn't feel rushed.  She was definitely successful in making us feel comfortable and allowing us to enjoy our meal.  She was funny and friendly.  Same goes for the following night I was there.  I was actually able to get a reservation in the main dining room area RIGHT next to the dance floor, in PERFECT view of the live band (more on that below)... where Natasha happened to be assigned.  Again, she was great.  Being that it was the last night, it was truly insane.  I'm pretty sure we were beyond room capacity, but she somehow managed to keep our wait time to a minimum.  She did this by constantly making eye contact with our table from afar to see if we needed anything.  I watched her do this with other tables as well.  Totally admirable.  Other servers would probably not try as hard.  It was so packed, it was hard to maneuver (literally, she had to maneuver around the tables/chairs/people).  Thank you, Natasha! The Food (4): Not the best I've had, but I think it deserves a solid 4 stars. My first night, I had the Caribbean Seafood Parrillada (sans Jalapeño Corn Cake because I'm not a big spice fan).  Everything was really good, not overcooked.  My least fave were the scallops and the Tilapia.  I love scallops more when they have a nice sear/char on them - these did not.  Tilapia is one of my favorite types of fish, but this could've used a little oomph.  I think a nice crisp would've bee nice.  Maybe it was there previously, but soaked in all the juicy goodness?  A little ironic, though, because, again, it could've used a little oomph. My second night, I ordered Scampi de Langosta y Camarones.  Again - it was well-cooked and all the flavor was there.  It came with coconut rice, but it actually barely had a hint of coconut (which is a good thing because I loathe coconut... unless I'm drinking Malibu).  It went perfectly with my meal. The Live Music (5): Friday night was a family band.  I was told it was a mother, father, and son accompanied by a few others.  Good energy, solid performance, not disruptive to dinner, great to watch as well as listen to while enjoying your meal.  Saturday night's band was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  Crazy energy, super talented... I couldn't take my eyes off them.  They definitely got you in the party/dance mood. The Dancing (5): We couldn't wait until after dinner, so we danced in between drinks/appetizer/entrées.  And then more after.  They have a 30minute lesson that started at 10p.  Perfect to burn off dinner!  I almost took half a star for the lack of space, but couldn't do it.  It was packed/hard to move/kind of uncomfortable during the lesson, but it was just so awesome.  The instructor was a peppy mother-version of Baby from Dirty Dancing.  She was easy to follow, and she & her partner were a pleasure to watch dance throughout the night. A perfect haven for dancers and amateurs alike, Rumba is so not competitive (as most places are); dancers got to showcase their talent while beginners were abIe to watch/learn.  Perfect for anyone who enjoys salsa/Latin dancing and appreciates the music that goes with it.  Looking forward to a new (and hopefully more spacious) RUMBA!",0.9997,0.725,0.241,0.035,0.5446099262613023

It's good to experience something like this at least once...  it helped that we were able to use our groupon and not break the bank... without our groupon, it would have been a very pricey meal! From the reviews that I've read, I thought maybe it might be a slow night, but almost immediately after we were seated around 7pm, the place started to really get packed. I think there were some big birthday celebrations and some group events going on...  It definitely was a very diverse group of people under one roof.... Really good live music. We lucked out with this 10piece band performing that night!  But other people were definitely correct about the noise level. Once the band began performing, it was really hard to carry on a conversation... It didn't matter where you sat since the speakers are stationed all over the place. Since it was getting pretty busy, it was difficult to get our servers attention at times...  The food was also just fine. Really enjoyed the Poblano Chicken soup. Mango Mojito salad was really fresh. Churrasco Rumbero, the beef just melted in my mouth. My Seabass was pretty good. Came with good sauce but just on a HUGE bed of rice.. Dessert was just terrible. Don't even bother getting the coconut brulee. They didn't even bother to caramelize the top. It was pretty much a thick chunk of very cold custard with little bits of coconut. The fruit dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was pretty decent with fresh mixed fruits.

Its not a sleezy dance club where everyone is grinding up on each other, but people are actually dancing and it looks really nice from the side.

It had sort of a tres leches texture that was soggy and wasn't very appetizing. I could have done without this. We just ate the ice cream and left the rest. The place was pretty dead for a Thursday.

It began well I ended up getting ""rock star"" parking in front even though I was fully prepared to valet but then a uneasy feeling occurred while walking up to the entrance. It felt like a club based the entrance and the overall layout. If there was ever a Afro-Cuban feel, I guess this would be it. To be honest it does seems more like a club then a restaurant, the tables are even all set up on a dance floor except for booths which enclose the dance floor. Then the medium sized stage was ever so present. No worries from me about the decor but I was worried about the food. The service seemed distant to me, not bad but not really giving that same energy as most places. Our waitress was at least smart enough to stagger our tapas (tables are small) unlike the table next to us who had a different waitress. They struggled to fit everything all at once.  So to recap, not feeling like movement, up for the parking, down for the decor, and about even for the service... I was back to stillness. Then the food... It was a Groupon ""special"" menu, you got to pick from an array of tapas that were mostly different from the main normal menu. Might sound like a bad thing but I can assure you it wasn't.   Queso Frito en Fuego- Chihuahua Cheese Rolled in an Herb Encrusted Breading then Skewered and Fried, Served with Chef Benjamin's Fiery Dry Pepper Sauce and Guacamole. Whoa... What is that tapping sound?! It's my hands tapping the table to a beat because these little suckers were brilliant!! Spicy Citrus Steamed Mussels- Three Quarter Pound of Fresh East Coast Mussels, Steamed in a Medley of Citrus Juices, White Wine and Cayenne Pepper, Garnished with Fresh Cilantro. Damn...Then the table was moving, I was asked ""Nick do you have to use the washroom (you know doing the pee pee dance)?"" I said no my feet, they are a movin & shakin!! Not sure what they called it but it was a Cuban flair pizza. The crust was a mix between Phyllo dough and Pillsbury roll-out dough.  The crust was layered and complimented the chicken, black beans, tomatoes, and avocado. Tasty... My arms just started swinging from side to side like they just didn't care. Then I took a sip of the BEST Mojito in the city. Suddenly I was up and my hips they were a shakin & jirating all over the place. If you could only see me now, I'm dancin', I'm dancin'!! So if you feel in a rut you need to RUMBA! P.S.

Instead, the waitress gave us the bar menu only (never even offered us the regular full restaurant menu) and we had to choose between a handful of tapas choices and two drinks for the groupon price of $39. It was supposed to be a value of ""over $80"" which is not advertised right because we got less than $39 worth of food and drink... It was a rip off. They said the groupon includes the value of $20 for live music on weekends.. Which is not true because not a single person paid $20 at the door while we sat there & could see the whole time. The tapas were tiny & mediocre. I'd be happier getting a bigger & better taco at atotonilcos.

Furthermore, my wife's a vegetarian.  He pointed out what our menu would be and claimed there is nothing vegetarian on the menu.  Oddly enough, there were 2 items in a separate menu that had the exact same name with a ""circle"" next to them which indicated they could be made vegetarian.  I questioned the server about this and he then said it has some bacon bits on the top but they can do it without it if we wish. I understand that tapas meals are to be paced out relatively slowly.  We got the first one after 30 min.  The remaining 3 we got at once after nearly 20 additional minutes. By the time we were done eating and ready to order dessert, it was 9:35.  It became 9:58 and I had to leave cause I needed to add money for parking so told him to just cancel the dessert and bring the check.  He said he'll pack it ""to go.""   BTW, when I entered the restaurant around 7:50, it was busy.  By 8:30, the crowd had reduced by over 50% so I can't even say that my server was ""very busy.""

2011-10-27,1.0,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. Where do I begin??? I made a reservation for my birthday party here and had one of the worst nights of my life.  When I made the reservation, I asked if we could bring our own cake and alcohol. They said fine, but there would be a cake-cutting and uncorking fee. I said fine, thanks for letting me know. End of conversation.  The night of my birthday, we all come and start ordering appetizers. We look around at other tables, see how big the entrees are, and decide to order just enough to split. Our waitress is useless--we need to ask her repeatedly to bring us water and bread. Some people at the table didn't even have place settings or glasses, and it takes forever to get those, too.  When she finally comes to take our entree orders, she then tells us that the restaurant's policy is 1 entree per person. I ask her why she decides to mention this now, after we've filled up on appetizers and already decided to split entrees. She tells me that when I called to make the reservation, that I was told about the entree policy. I told her that nobody ever mentioned that to me. She continues I argue with me until I ask to speak with the manager.  The manager, Marianna, comes, and proceeds to argue with me. She says that she personally made the reservation and that she remembers telling me about the entree policy. So I did a little test. I told her that my husband made the reservation and that if she told him, maybe he forgot to tell me. She said that oh yes, she remembers speaking to my husband and telling him that. Really, Mariana? I made the reservation, not my husband, and now I've just caught you in a bold-faced lie. She  then agreed to let it go and let us order how we wanted. I thought the matter was settled. A few minutes later, she came back and announced that she'd changed her mind, that she can't let the entree policy thing go because we decided to BYOB and that the restaurant is already losing money because of us. Really? You're losing money on charging $25 to uncork each bottle? Save the BS, lady. She then said that those of us who didn't order their own entrees would have to pay $10 per person. Excuse me? Where did this imaginary charge come from? I was almost in tears at this point. I told her do whatever you have to do, but give us our check and wrap my cake back up, because we're leaving. She refused to take off the $10 charge per person and threatened to call the police, so we just paid it and left. We had a better time at home over tea and cake than we had at that sorry excuse for an elegant restaurant. Readers beware!",0.6975,0.881,0.065,0.054,0.43900000000000006

They literally covered a good amount of songs I play over and over on my ITunes. I can say I was not impressed with the crowd. Majority of people were standing around and I am not sure why with such good music. When we did go to the bar for drinks there was a boyfriend/girlfriend-(ghetto to say the least) who got in a screaming match.

We went for my birthday and were seated in this huge semi-circular booth that overlooked the main room.  Our server was extremely attentive and personable, and brought us a treat after overhearing Andy talking about it. My entree was the Volcanic Seafood Mofongo, which was Shrimp, Lobster, Calamari and Mussels, simmered in a chipotle and sun-dried tomato sauce, and served atop a bed of mashed plantains, crowned with julienne vegetables.  This dish was excellent, and well presented.  My only complaint was that the plantains were more ""smashed"" than ""mashed"", and there were some hard plantain bits mixed throughout. We also ordered The Discovery, which was an appetizer sampler. This included an assortment of Beef Empanadas, Jerk Chicken, Coconut Shrimp and Vegetable Rolls, served with a Tomatillo and Pineapple Ginger Lime Sauce and Mango Glaze.  Beautifully presented and delicious, my favourite was the chicken. As previously mentioned, our server brought us a surprise at the end of the meal, and it turned out to be a slice of Bizcocho con Tres Leches.  This is a yellow cake, soaked in sweetened condensed and evaporated milk and heavy cream.  I am not much of a sweets person, but this cake was to die for.  i would come back simply to order that.

She then said she will bring over a manager, to which she brought a lady named Marianna who approached the birthday girl and was really rude telling her ""rules are rules"" and we apologized that there was some kind of miscommunication but she insisted that we have to have one entree per person and weren't allowed to share. Then I told her she is ruining our evening and that this is just ridiculous so she said she will let it go. 20 minutes later, she comes back to us and says ""sorry, I just can't let it go, there will be an additional charge of 10 dollars per person.""

First she says she is letting it go, and then she comes back and changes her mind once agian being rude to the birthday girl, I mean who acts like that in a professional environment.

The live band is amazing, and I usually go when they have the salsa lessons. Everyone is very into it, and there will be a mixed of non-dancers like myself to couple who've obviously taken lessons to older Spanish people who've been at it for years. The one thing about this place that you have to remember is that you pay for the entertainment in the price of the food. It's a little expensive for what you get, so consider the mark-up a band tax. The food itself is slightly above average. We usually start off with the empanadas, which are okay but won't blow your socks off. I've also had the Queso Fundido which is amazing. For entrees I've had the Chicken and Rice which once again is okay but isn't bursting with flavor like you'd expect. And it's kinda something I would expect from a hole in the wall Mexican place. My date had the Volcanic Seafood Mofongo and she wasn't a huge fan of it. I've also had the seafood and rice which was much better than the chicken and rice, but again I wasn't blown away.

Onto the more important stuff.  Drink selection is good, there's a variety of specialty cocktails- from Sangria, to rum mixers.  I liked the mojito, and our server added some fruity tones to it, tasted like mango and orange.  The guacamole is top notch, more lime-heavy, which I liked.  Chips were thin and crispy.  We also got the Cubano Pizza (shredded chicken in tortillas, topped with cheese, beans, tomatos).  It was tasty!  We were informed that the restaurant just unveiled a new menu.  And despite our server's charm, he lacked the knowledge of it when we asked questions.  A little odd, but not a deal breaker.

2011-04-25,1.0,"My sister and I were the organizers of my birthday party. My sister and I came in a week before the party on November 17th and asked Emerson many questions regarding all the packages available. We were told that for the package at the bar we would have to get two appetizer platters for $75 each and two hours ""all-you-can-drink"" for $24 per person including everything except for the premium liquor. We were also told that everyone who is included in the party would not pay the cover charge at the door. I specifically asked Emerson if I reserve the space for 20 people, but have less than 20 shows up, would we be penalized. He said that as long as we have at least15-16 people and get the appetizer platters, we will not be penalized. We were very happy with the information and decided to go ahead and celebrate my birthday and the Rumba. The day of the party on Saturday, November 24th, we had 15 people come to be part of the celebration and ""all-you-can-drink"" package. Later, we had three more people join us half an hour before the time for ""all-you-can-drink"" expired. Not to mention, when these people showed up, they were not being let in because ""the club has reached the maximum capacity"" and it took me almost half an hour trying to get the rest of my party inside. I came up to Alex (our server) and told him that those three people are NOT part of the ""all-you-can-drink"" and they will be purchasing drinks from either him or the bar on a separate check. He said that ""it was just fine."" It was as if Alex, went against my request, went ahead and distributed three wristbands to the guests that joined my party much later. Alex never served them the drinks; they got and paid for them at the bar. It just seems that Alex was trying to get more money on the gratuity by adding extra people to the check and hoping we would not notice by serving us excessive amounts of alcohol. A couple of days later I asked my three friends who arrived late if they received wristbands, they stated ""yes."" But Alex never explained what the wristbands were for and they assumed the wristbands represented them being over 21 and part of the reservation. Emerson kept saying that we drank enough to account for 25 people, but we did not even drink as much as we were served. Alex kept brining drinks constantly when we weren't even half way done with the previous drinks. It has gotten to a point where our table was covered with half full drinks and we never had to even ask Alex for another drink - there was a lot of wasted liquor. When my sister and I were trying to explain the situation to Emerson, he insulted us and threatened to call the police when we simply were trying to talk to him. He crossed the line by getting into my sister's face and was yelling at her to be quiet, refusing to listen. I had never been threatened, belittled and/or treated that way anywhere. The next day when I kept apologizing to my friends who have experienced the awful treatment from Emerson, I learned that 8 people from my party paid $10 cover charge at the door, even when they mentioned they were part of my party. That was not what was communicated to us the day we made the reservation. What was the point to make the reservation and buy the mandatory appetizer platters, if we could have just come in on our own, pay the cover charge and for our drinks? Also, we had a couple of separate checks prior and during the ""all-you-can-drink"" for two hours; we ordered entrees and a few drinks. Therefore, on top of the main check ($756.60), we paid almost $300 including the tip; total spending over $1000 at the Rumba and this is the treatment we have received. The overall experience was the worst I had ever encountered in my entire life. It's taking phone calls and numerous e-mails just trying to get this resolved.

We went on a Friday night (go early for dinner as the place is full by 10 if you don't!) We arrived around 8pm and got a seat right on the side of the Brazilian wood dance floor. Sweet!  A couple of drinks later, our toes were tapping to the music of the live band that was playing everything from salsa to merengue to the love song of ""Besame Mucho"". I wanted to paint my lips red, throw on my sassiest dress and heels and be spun around the floor.  But for the moment, food was on our minds so dinner came first. I ordered the house salad (delicious with greens, pine nuts. goat cheese and balsamic dressing) and the sea bass with rice and tomatoes also very good. My friend opted for the bean soup (smelled great) and some lobster dish.  The only misstep of the evening was that our first course came out at the same time as our entrees. They sent the entrees back but it was apparent that they sat under a heat lamp until we were ready- and so they suffered in the final presentation. Oh well. Mine was still good- but my friend's was just okay.  At about 9:45 they invite all new dancers to the floor to learn how to salsa. As the count of ""one two three four five six seven"" rang out over and over again, I noticed just how much fun the ""newbies"" on the floor were having as they laughed at themselves with even the men punching each other as men are prone to do every time someone stepped on someones foot, etc.  Finally, the big moment. After 10, the lights dim, the band comes back from break and it is salsa time! And I don't know where the men are hiding up until this point, but they come out of the woodwork to ask you to dance with ""no"" not even being an option. If you don't know how to dance, they will lead you. Tell them you are too tall and they say they like tall women (even though some could barely spin me as their arm did not reach high enough) Tell them you just finished dancing and they look so sad you just have to go back onto the floor. Wear your dancing shoes ladies as there is not an unpopular girl in the place given the ratio of men to women.  Know if you go that dinner ran about $70 with drinks (each) and valet parking is about $10. Also know that if you get there after 10 and are not planning to eat, there is a cover charge to get in the place.  Old, young, dancers and non dancers alike will have fun at Rumba. For where else in Chicago can you find a little hint of South Beach in River North?

I visited Rumba a couple of years ago, but this time I really got the experience.  Rumba is a Latino restaurant that also becomes a salsa dance club. They have a full band and the music is playing while you're enjoying your meal, it felt like a Puerto Rican wedding. The main reason is because they also have a large dance floor, so people can salsa the night away.  Food: We only went for drinks and appetizers I really can't talk about the entrees in more detail. We ordered the beef empanadas and a couple of mojitos. Wow, the mojitos were made perfectly, just the right amount of rum, mint and sugar. The empanadas were large and very flavorful, especially with the garlic sauce. I'll definitely be returning to eat a full meal, other people in the group were raving about their dishes.  Service: The waiters are extremely attentive and on their A game. They made sure dishes were removed and when your drink was low to ask if you needed another.  Note: There is a $5 cover charge to get into Rumba after a certain time because it's also a salsa club.

2009-02-22,4.0,"ok, I wanted to hate this place. I had been there before with my boyfriend and had a mediocre to bad experience when it came to the price for the food, drinks, and service. But, I went again last night with the bf and my parents and I had to say it was a lot a lot of fun.We ordered full on dinner this time instead of just appetizers.  APPETIZERS We actually ended up getting the same appetizers because my parents picked. ""The Discovery"" is a bit of a sampler with grilled chicken skewers, some sort of egg roll looking thing, an empanada, and coconut shrimp. It was pretty good, still not great in my book. The trio of ceviches was very very good. It had a lot of good flavors, and wasn't overloaded with fillers, the seafood could really shine through. DINNER I ordered the Shrimp Diablo, I was warned that this was incredibly spicy, made with habaneros. The dish came, it was very flavorful, but there was literally no spice whatsoever. I'm ot saying oh i'm a badass and this didn't phase me, I actually think they forgot to add the hot peppers to the dish. That being said it was still very tasty, the shrimp were cooked well, the veggies and rice it came with were good too. My mom ordered the scampi dish and hers was spicier and she said she enjoyed it very much. My dad ordered the chicken limon and he enjoyed his as well. My boyfriend ordered the Volcano Mofongo- if i didn't have a thing about ordering the same dish as someone else I would have ordered this and I wish I had. His dish was AWESOME. I was skeptical about seafood with mofongo (a dish of seasoned mashed fried plantains for those not familiar with it) which i'm used to having with chicken or pork. But OMG it was soooo good. There was just enough garlic and a touch of crispiness in the plantains. I would go back just for this dish SERVICE Our waiter was great, especially considering we sat around for close to 4 hours. He was attentive, but not smothering or pushy. Funny and friendly, everything a waiter should be A+++ for him. AMBIANCE Very romantic lighting and decor, but once the music gets going you're going to have to be sitting in your dates lap to hear them. We actually had a table on the dance floor directly in front of the stage, they took me seriously when i asked for a good view of the band, lol. It was nice until people started dancing, then it obviously got crowded. People definitely come her to dance. And there are some serious dancers here. You've got your native dancers, who grew up doing it and look great doing it. You've got the people who took lessons and look silly as hell doing choreographed routines of the same moves over ad over, and then you have the people who may not know what they're doing, but are out there having fun anyways. but it is VERY CROWDED. MUSIC The music was AWESOME!!! Now, I must disclaim: it was my brother's band, Afinca'o. But i promise you people were having a blast and i heard one girl say as she walked by our table, ""That band is incredible!"" They do three sets and speed up each one. Piano and congas only during standard dinner time. Next set they bring in trumpet, trombone, sax, bass, and timbales for some latin jazz. last set is the full band with singer doing dance your ass off salsa, cha cha, merengue, etc. SO FUN! OVERALL The music, service and food were all great. I still think that the food is overpriced. But when they are on, they are really on. And even if its silly to pay $30 for a plate of mofongo, if you want to have a fun night of latin flavor and amazing music i would definitely go back to RUMBA",0.9969,0.789,0.15,0.061,0.5456904761904763

They play traditional music but also bring in American old school classics like Stevie Wonder with a Latin flare and I must say that this is done very very well.  The singers and the musicians alike are so talented and quality of their sound was incredible. The band was so energetic and into the music that you can just tell how much they enjoy what they do. On the dance floor you have the pros and the Novice's, the old and the young (baby Boomers, Gen X, Gen Y) all dancing together and having a great time.

I must say that the food was spectacular ! I have eaten a lot of Latin cuisine at various restaurants and usually nothing really separates them or makes them stand out. Rumba was the exception on this evening.  Our appetizers were served family style and some of the more memorable were the empanadas, mashed potatoes, fried calamari and chicken skewers. My entree  included shrimp and scallops and coconut rice, and tostones and everything was great, I couldn't even finish everything. My boyfriend had the chicken with Puerto Rican rice and tostones, again awesome! Dessert was also served family style and included flan, tres leches, and another unfamiliar dessert.

2008-10-16,4.0,"Since this is my favorite spot to burn the floor salsa dancing, I'm a little biased. 'Twas about time the downtown area got another restaurant that caters to Puerto Rican/Cuban fare.  Parking is iffy. You can get meters around and do the parking boxes that aren't far away, but there's always valet for $10 too. When it first opened, I wasn't a fan of going there for dancing b/c it got waaay to crowded, the crowd was too young and there were too many non-dancers standing /fumbling around on the dancefloor. It was more of a tourist pit to me and my allegiance was to the Buzz. I believe they raised the cover a bit and the scene changed for the better. I like how they have a Latin mix . I believe Thursdays are for Samba, although I've never been. Have dined there several times, and the food is pretty good, although pricey. No complaints from me; I'll pay for a good dining experience. I love the rich reds of the decor with the bongos edging the booths.  Service is typically good, although it may take skill to flag down your waiter when things get going for the evening.  Don't come for conversation, as it can get  a little conversation challenged, but by the time the live band comes on, I'm ready to dance, not chat. If you expect to dine on Friday or Saturday around 10:30 and have a problem with people dancing in front of your table, Rumba's may not be the best place for you. Get an earlier reservation before the tables are moved away and the place turns into a club.  There are a lot of dance levels that show up on the weekends, but I think the dance lesson is kinda silly, as there's usually not enough room and the instructions can't be heard that well over the buzz of the crowd dining.  I wouldn't recommend this place for beginners coming to learn to dance. It could be intimidating and it gets really crowded. Hence, getting ""heeled"", bumped and elbowed. Have been caught up in the salsa ""matrix"" for so long now, I'm comfortable going there solo to get my salsa fix. There's the usual ""circle"" of dancers that I know or typically dance with and I can typically find good partners. I wish the live band stayed on longer (I think they stop around 11ish), but the DJ keeps it moving. Lately, something wacky is going on with the air conditioning system so it's been like dancing in a heat wave up in there. Also, the crowd is changing and more folks are heading to Alhambra when they have Salsa. For the first time, Rumba has a little competition for the crowd.

Cheesy white-suited waiters throw food at, or near, tables, as do the cocktail waitresses with their drinks. The soup was straight out of a can; the salad a soggy mess of indeterminable origin; the lobster hard and chewy and barely discernible from the steak (also hard and chewy); the dessert straight from 'Entertaining 70's Style' and the wine list was a collection of bad wines at ridiculous mark-ups.

2007-11-26,1.0,"Do not patronize this business! There are far too many other places in Chicago that actually want you back as a repeat customer and will treat you with the respect you deserve. I hate writing a review like this but the incident that occurred and the way it was handled leave me no choice. We went here on a Saturday night to celebrate the birthday of a friend. The group had reserved two tables and agreed to purchase a large appetizer platter (@$75) for each. People in the group could buy a wristband (@$24) for all-you-can-drink for about 2 hours. The service was spectacular- our waiter was very responsive, efficient, and on a couple of occasions, brought a new drink before you could ask or finish the previous one. Unfortunately, there was a discrepancy between the number of people we had in our party (15) and the number of wristbands they charged us for (18). I'll try to spare you some of the minutiae, but in trying to hash this out with the manager, we were told at one point that the manager himself came by and personally counted the number of people in our group. Here's the problem with that: *if* he came by, I never saw him and I was at our table the entire time. Second, we had allowed some people at a neighboring table to sit at the seats at the end of one of our tables because their group was a bit larger than anticipated. Despite explaining this to the manager, he refused to budge or even admit he may have miscounted. Then at another point, he tried to tell us that we had drank enough for 25 people so we should be glad we were only being charged for 18. Here's the problem with that: don't offer an all-you-can-drink and then complain when people drink a lot... especially when the waiter was Johnny-on-the-spot with bringing new rounds. I'm not complaining about that, but his efficiency did contribute to how much was consumed.  The waiter was extremely free and easy with handing out the a-y-c-d wristbands to people that arrived; as soon as someone joined the group he'd slap on a wristband. We believe he made a mistake and people a wristband in error and charged us for it. The manager refused to acknowledge the possibility of this mistake because he had allegedly counted the number of people in our group. During this time, the manager sent someone to have at least two of his bouncers stand behind him, apparently in order to intimidate us. The bouncers were actually pretty cool though and probably wanted no part of this disagreement. Plus, the majority of people in our party work in the service industry and were extremely keen on how to work this out with the manager without letting the dispute escalate. Ultimately, one of the people in our group paid the entire bill in order to prevent further ruining our friend's birthday. Nevertheless, the manager refused to admit the possibility of a mistake or to make any kind of offer to meet us halfway. In fact, he threatened multiple times to have our group's organizer (the b-day girl's sister) arrested. I tried to intervene and explain to him that the organizer loves her sister more than life itself and it was killing her that this dispute had ruined her sister's birthday party, and his unwillingness to make any attempt to reconcile the overcharging was the issue. Furthermore, I told him that the majority of people in our group are in the industry and have no reason or desire to bilk his restaurant out of any money. Nevertheless, he starts carrying on about how he told so-and-so about this-and-that five times, and I told him flat out that I didn't care; we were being overcharged and he could be doing more to reconcile the situation. I think it's important to note that the same manager was also dealing with another pair of angry customers; the coat check had lost her $800 coat and the manager refused any responsibility or restitution to her.  We did finally leave, but all in our party promised to relay the story of this overcharging and poor customer service to anyone and everyone we can. If the restaurant makes restitution to the organizer or some effort to reconcile the situation, I will be sure to update my review, but until that time, my review will stand as currently written. I realize large groups present problems for restaurants but I'll hand it to them- they were doing a great job of serving us and all were having a great time- it was when the dispute arose that everyone's time was ruined. Again, my suggestion is to not patronize this restaurant; you may have a terrific time but if/when they make a mistake, be prepared for them to make it your problem. UPDATE 12/3/07: We received a response to our e-mail to the restaurant. They agreed to meet us halfway and refund an amount equal to one and a half of the three disputed AYCD wristbands. This is a step in the right direction but everyone in our group is still edgy about the way we were treated that evening.",0.9448,0.752,0.132,0.115,0.5696818837727928

Yikes- if I ever put on a sequin top after the age of 35 someone please have a serious chat with me. * The entertaining photographer (who's snapping his camera at Rumba nightly) who used Halloween weekend as an excuse to dress up in a spandex one piece. He made us take the same picture about 10 times since my fiance and I have problems opening our eyes  in pics (we're working on it before the wedding) and was cracking us up the entire time.

My fiance ordered the best thing among the 3 of us- The Volcanic Seafood Morongo.  Dana and I shared the coconut plantain crusted sea bass, which I liked more than she did, but it really was nothing special....it sounds much better than it is.  We also had some sort of shrimp/lobster scampi dish and that really didn't do it for me, but Dana was somewhat happy with it.  * The price! Boy is this place expensive! I don't mind shelling out the dough for amazing food, but our entrees just didn't cut it.  Fortunately, my fiance (the man of deals) had found a $50 gift certificate on  restaurant.com  before we went to dinner so it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but without this gift certificate it was $160 for sangria, ceviche, and 3 entrees.  Not awfully expensive for amazing food, but Rumba has some work to do in the kitchen before I can justify paying this.   Overall experience: Would go back for drinks, people watching, & maybe an appetizer (ceviche anyone?) if was looking for a lively spot in the area, but probably not for dinner...",0.9976,0.81,0.169,0.021,0.5232539682539682

2007-08-18,5.0,"Alright - I had to write a review of Rumba because I try to visit it every time I'm back home... I had my wedding reception there and we could not have PRAYED for a better place.  Our priority for a reception was a big ol' party to celebrate that we just tied the knot.  We didn't do the typical bridal party intros, garter toss, etc.  F that noise.  We wanted a fiesta!  And it was one hell of a party...  Rumba was amazing to work with - so many places completely try to nickel and dime  you because it's your wedding.  Not Rumba.  They were gracious and completely accommodating.  I would have no hesitation recommending them for a private party.   I still get told that people had more fun at our wedding than any other they'd ever been to.  We had sangria and mojito stations, their band played during cocktails and dinner, we had a flamenco dancer show and they let our dj plug into their sound system (which is pretty good since it's a salsa club).   The. Food. Was. Amazing.  Period.  I'd put their flank steak and manchego mashed potatoes up against any.  And they had no problem bringing our own cake and dessert (a friend's mom is a professional baker...).  Their pina colada cheesecake is amazing.   And their valet is just as cheap as the garage on the corner so unless you find street parking, go for convenience.   If you haven't gone, get your party hat on and your hips moving to the latin rhythm.  Unless I'm in town - then stay out of my way.",0.9883,0.782,0.17,0.047,0.5175

Although the atmosphere is really nice (homey Cuban-club feel), and the cover's cheap ($10 for ladies- guys I don't know!)

2007-05-29,4.0,"This is just one of those restaurants where you want to come back for the atmosphere. My boyfriend tried to get a table in the main seating area, but we arrive late for our reservation and our seat was given away. So don't arrive late! We were taken to the back of the bar where it was more quiet, but we couldn't see the band. There was live jazz/latin band during dinner and also someone on stage singing, just like an old school jazz club. The food was excellent, big portions, and a tad bit expensive. Service was ok, probably due to the fact we were behind the bar in the back of the restaurant. We originally planned on going to dinner and salsa dancing afterwards, but somehow it got so packed on the dancefloor, we just left after dinner. I heard its better on Saturdays, but we had went on a Friday.

2007-03-24,3.0,"justin may be bringing sexy back but i like that Rumba tries to bring a little romance back.  in fact, i think that if there was a fight between Rumba and Nacional 27, i'd pick Rumba to win.  it reminds me of those old supper clubs back in los angeles in the 40s and 50s and who doesn't like that?  (do they still have the white clad live rumba combo play on weekends?  i don't know.) at Rumba, you go for the atmosphere, the people watching and the cocktails.  their mojito is the best i've had and their small appetizer plates are good enough to cushion the blow of alcohol your system might take while you listen to the music or watch the older couples on the dance floor (so cute!). after work, meeting friends, my favorite place to sit is at the low tables by the bar, in the tall windows.  i like going to bars and restaurants during the week (you get better attention) so i remember Rumba as being Up but not over the top UP.  if you go on friday or saturday nights, prepare to be in a crush.   what is especially good is their semi-private room.  i believe they used to have an old fashioned domino's night there back when they first started but it may be gone now (another Old World thing i appreciated.)  but if you want to rent a room for a private party, they have excellent service and customer care.",0.9958,0.742,0.224,0.034,0.4157738095238095

The ceviche sampler is a favorite, as well as the crab cakes.   Food could be better for the prices.  But the salsa dancing is wonderful!  Great place to go and let loose and have fun!  But make sure to bring plenty of cash, as it can get pretty pricey here!",0.9957,0.73,0.238,0.033,0.5120840116673451
