2016-05-03,4.0,"MOTO, THE FINAL & POINTLESS REVIEW- Part 2 The food and service was still great.  It simply was not what it was before.  At some level one could argue, ""wouldn't this be expected?""  I mean, in talking with the staff, the Alinia Group had not let any of them know any more than that Moto was closing.  Nobody knew if they had jobs moving forward or what was next for the space.  So, why SHOULD they care to do everything perfectly?  As ""short timers"" like to say, ""What are they going to do?  Fire me?""  Further, and no disrespect is intended to the staff, but it is entirely possible that we were no longer dealing with the ""A"" team.  I mean, from a practical standpoint, I don't know whether I would/should expect the truly elite staff at an establishment like Moto to ""hang around"" to the bitter end, just to see what might happen.  I mean it seems to me that once they were told that Moto was closing, they would immediately all be looking for new jobs...and I would clearly think that they would find them quickly.  The caveat here is that there are plenty of potential reasons why the service may have been a bit off. But let's get to 'dissing' the food.  The same caveats apply here as to the service but there is more to discuss.  Since we were the late seating, it gave us an opportunity to stay late and annoy the staff by not leaving sooner, I guess.  As the night wore down, we got the fellow who we presume was serving the role of maître d'hôtel to open up a bit about how the staff was feeling, what was next, etc.  One of his chief complaints regarded one of the diners' chief complaints, ""it is not the same"".  He said that everybody wanted the emphasis on the ""science of food"" but the staff felt that it still was being emphasized...just in a different way.  As too often happens in a ""disagreement"" I think that probably both sides have at least some degree of being ""correct"". If you did come expecting the cigars, snowmen, and 'flavor-redirects' of old, you would have come away totally disappointed.  However, in fairness to Chef Anderson and his staff, trying to imitate and maintain a style that was distinctly Chef Cantu's would probably have been ""wrong"" at many levels.  Nonetheless, it was cigars and snowmen and ""flavor-redirects' that clientele had come to expect as part of the ""show"" at Moto.  So, setting predefined expectations aside, the courses offered to us (we got the higher tier, full tasting with wine pairing) were fine and befitting a restaurant at the level of Moto.  However, as I have said many times in many reviews before, they were not ""special"" in any way that set them apart from other, comparable restaurants.  Had we been blindfolded, flown around for several hours, and sat down to an ""anonymous"" meal at Moto, we would have not guessed that it was Moto.  It could have been any high-end restaurant in any city in the US. It simply was not Moto; it simply was not memorable.  Sitting here removed by a couple of months and finally getting around to this review, I am not sure that I could specifically name a single course that we had.  This does not make the dishes bad and could be more a symptom of a memory failing from age.  In fact, maybe it actually results from me truly being a spoiled (asinine elitists) customer.  The food was fine but in the backdrop of being a 95th percentile restaurant, it simply did not stand out.   Perhaps that is the ""real learning"" to be had here.  If any professional in the field should even care to read the ""wisdom"" of an 'asinine elitist', perhaps if we distill it down, the real learning is that if you are asked to replace a Chef Homero Cantu and keep the same name on the restaurant, if you don't deliver circus tents and talking food, maybe you should run away screaming?  It is perhaps inevitable that if you take over a restaurant that has carved out a unique niche you will ALWAYS suffer by comparison.  Is this Chef Anderson's and his staff's fault?  No.  You don't become head chef if you don't have a personal vision and the burning desire to execute it.  However, it is also not the customers' faults if they come to a place like Moto and expect ""Moto to be Moto"". Am I saying that it is good for Moto to be gone?  I am not sure that it is good to ever lose a Moto.  It certainly is not good that a lot of talented people are out of jobs.  It certainly is not good that we are down one great establishment in a city where I feel that a once great food scene has regressed a bit over the past couple of years.  It certainly is NOT good that the death of a great chef was a cause of this.  However, maybe it was time for Moto to be gone. We have a lot of great memories from Moto.  We will have those forever (or at least as long as brain biochemistry allows!).  We thank the staff through the years for helping to provide those memories and wish them all the best of luck moving forward.  We will certainly miss Moto.  It was a key to the maturation of our Chicago food experience.",0.9962,0.807,0.125,0.069,0.515646747767001
2016-02-19,3.0,"Moto RIPed on Valentine's Day and it's probably for the best. I had such high expectations when I went and with dropping near $500. Sadly, the food was just okay. Some things were good, but nothing mindblowing, nothing even fabulous...all was just okay to good. I was a bit disappointed. The best dishes I had when visiting were the Chicken and Dumplings (served looking very unique like a little log and I think was one of their signature dishes) and the all vegetable dish. Who knew I'd like a dish sans protein so much!? Everything else was just okay and I honestly can't remember many details of the dishes. I do have to say plating was great the entire meal but was surprised there wasn't more presentation in such a pricey tasting menu. Service was amazing. The ladies took care of us all along the way and were personable in our chatting. A small appreciated cool thing was the customized menu. Made me feel way more important than I am. When we went, the front half of the dining room had some kind of special group tour/dinner thing going on where the Chef went out to speak on the courses. My friend and I were seated in the back half and they closed the wall between us. I actually really liked the exclusivity of feeling like we had a dining room to ourselves. But we had a bad feeling that there was no one else seated in the dining room. We definitnely found it to be ominous. I am glad I went to Moto prior to it closing as I think I would have always wondered how it was.

I'm so sad...although I think what we experienced was quite different from Cantu's original vision, I loved the experience. There was less of the sciencey influence and more of a southern infused fine dining. That was a major surprise for me, because I LOVE southern food! The southern creations were delectable and so creative: - Waffle House 'breakfast for dinner': I loved this, because if you spend any time in the south, there is a Waffle House on every corner - Okra dish: I LOVE okra and am so glad the team infused okra into one of the courses - Chicken and Dumplings: Let's just say, these aren't your granny's dumplings. They were cheese filled! Which was a nice nod to the Midwest in my opinion I absolutely loved my experience at Moto. We did the 16 course tasting menu and had a blast. My husband even had flowers delivered and they had them on the table for us! By the time the dessert courses started and we had eaten our weight in their cheese plate, we really couldn't handle the four additional desserts, but everything leading up to the final courses were amazing, unique, and accessible at the same time.",0.9826,0.821,0.167,0.012,0.5901234567901235

2016-02-04,5.0,"A pricey experience but worth it for the finest of finest dining. Fulton Market area is known for $$$$ calibre places and Moto fits the bill perfectly. Located right next to Aviary, it's no doubt that Moto is a perfect fit. Some magazines name Moto as the most notable place for molecular gastronomy in the world, and now that I've dined here I've discovered that something as small as a pebble on my plate can explode into a flavor sensation in my mouth. When I ate here, Moto had not yet earned its Michelin Star but really it was well deserved. I was lucky enough to be served by the late Chef Homaro Cantu before his passing, but really all his staff in the kitchen were nothing short of awesome (yes, we went down to the kitchen and met them all afterwards).  Our Maitre D for the night was Louis. He served as the face that would give us that sense of familiarity throughout the night when our servers became strangers. Louis is above and beyond. Every course had an underlying theme and he explained it all perfectly. This is fancy food, but come hungry because you'll want to come with a clean palate. The entire experience will last between 3 to 4 hours. What first drew us to dine here was the creativity of the dishes. Every course was a presentation in itself with that 1, 2.....TADA...... While I feel that the allure here is not knowing what to expect, but read on if you hate surprises. -=-SPOILER ALERT-=- As you walk in, the first thing you see is a giant chemistry set. At the business end of the whole ordeal is the Palate Cleanser. Have a cup, then be ready for the show. The first thing to come out after sitting was a plain plate of 15 dots of food. Yep, just dots. As we tasted each one, Louis explained that each dot was a preview of the courses to come. FANCAE! The creativity that came from these courses is nothing short of astounding. Like our salad was served still partially in the ground. Louis would come by and start trimming our salad for us and putting it on our plate. Another course was seafood served in a steaming wooden box. Then there was also a picnic theme of eating cheese and crackers in the grass. My crown jewel here, of course it was the seared foie. If you are looking for a long meal, where every course is worthy of discussion and Oo's and Ah's. This is the place.",0.9914,0.833,0.127,0.039,0.5001873897707232

The voucher isn't cheap it's $260 and the extra add ons brought our bill up to $350. The food all tasted fine. But the portion size is comically small. One ravioli with sprinklings of stuff, two small shrimp with sauce on them, 1 inch buy  1.5 inch rice with 8 beans, three tinny pieces of chicken, you get the idea. I not exaggerating to say it felt like getting a single piece of sushi serve to you very 20 minutes. The wine pairings were good. I upgraded to a pairing per course. Which in the end, I felt like was over drinking in a bar that didn't serve food. But then the server would come out with a small piece of food and would pour sauce on it and Id remember that we were eating out. I'm positive the entire 9 courses would fit in a 1 cup measuring cup. I get the small plate concept and the course concept but this was ridiculous.  When I got home and pulled the hummus and pretzels my husband looked and me and said ""I thought you went to dinner"" and I said ""I did, but there was no food.""",0.6194,0.896,0.076,0.029,0.5177962662337663

2016-01-10,5.0,I would describe this as an experience restaurant. Every aspect has been creatively twisted around so that what you expect is not the actual. By this I mean you will see an entree and it looks like beef steak but to your surprise it's a dessert that appears to be a beef steak.  Each part of the 20 entrees are a little different. I have ate here at least 4 times and my favorite entree  is still the pulled park sandwich aka smoking cigar in an ash tray. Even the Tobacco leaf on the outside is edible along with the rice paper that is the stamp. How in the world they can create food that can actually smoke like a lit cigarette is beyond me it's super food tech. The wines are amazing I recommend the pairing option for the food. This place can cost close to 500 for two people if you do 20 entrees and do wine paring so don't show up if your on a budget.  They offer a 20 entrees option and I think once we paid little under 250 that about as good as the price gets.

2016-01-06,2.0,"Full disclosure, we only came here because of the Gilt City voucher.   And when a Michelin star restaurant has a voucher, you know business isn't exactly booming.  While the restaurant was full, it was clear that a majority of the people there were dining on that voucher value, and quite honestly it showed in our main waitress' face.   I can go on and on about all the high end restaurants I've dined at all over the country and the world, but even on its most basic level, even if you haven't ever dined at a Bib Gourmand or Michelin star restaurant before, there's basic levels of service and quality you should at least expect for this level of dining.  And on the night we went it was missing. Hand to god I've gotten better and more attentive service at Olive Garden.   The overall staff seemed attentive enough from when we walked in, to the complimentary coat check, to the other wait staff removing our plates and serving us from time to time, but it was our main waitress that bothered the hell out of me.  The introduction of each plate was more of a chore than including us in the overall experience of what we were about to eat.  The wine pairings were good, albeit small.  I understand we paid marginally less than what the normal patron may pay, but giving us 2 healthy sips of wine is a joke, through and through.  You want to short change us because we bought a voucher?  We're not the ones who have a suffering restaurant.  If anything, stop standing on your past laurels and do more to give people a reason to recommend your restaurant and come back, not shun them because they got a deal that YOU YOURSELVES PUT OUT.  Just because the odd startup of Google exec walks through the door doesn't mean you do a disservice to others by being brusque and see lesser paying patrons as unworthy of your time.  Do a better job of explaining not just where the wine is from - anyone can read that off the menu - but explain WHY it's good with the food.  Tell us something interesting about the dish, not just what it is.  Don't just memorize what's on a menu card, make people care about what they're eating.  Even with the voucher, people are paying a shit ton for this meal and deserve better service than this at this echelon of dining. Food was whatever.  The first dish of ceviche was delicate and had a lot of great subtle flavors.  Until the waitress drenched it in overly tart lime juice which killed the rest of the flavors, and turned it into sushi in lime sauce.  The rest of the food wasn't very memorable, and the tastes were muddled.  The venison was good if not a bit dry and lacking in salt, which oddly enough was overpowering in nearly ever other dish.  The chicken...nugget...thing was just that.  It tasted exactly what I would get at mcdonalds, and at least those mcnuggets are juicier.  The chicken was dry and bland.  Everything else was just more meh. My wife and I took my parents here for a good retirement dinner.  We should've spent that on buying them a new iPad.  At least that wouldn't have left them wanting taco bell afterwards.",0.9829,0.816,0.118,0.066,0.46611712361712365

2015-12-17,4.0,"The outside was very unassuming with a simple red brick facade and a silver sign with green letters stating ""Moto."" We walked in to this West Loop location and were immediately greeted by the host. As we walked by some large booth-like seats, we were surprised to see a ladder laying in one of them. Not the best presentation, if I do say so myself. At least clean up a bit before dinner! The dining room we sat in was very small with only a few tables. The decor was simple -- black and white walls with modern artwork. The chairs were plush white chairs with contrasting black tables -- very comfortable seating. The ambiance left much to be desired though as it was very loud and very bright. Not the most romantic place for sure. Now before I begin, one thing to note is that the owner and Executive Chef Homaro ""Omar"" Cantu had just recently hanged himself in a new brewery location just a few months prior to this review. The restaurant was operating under the direction of Trevor Rose-Hamblin and the plans are for it to remain open in spite of the recent events. So, we were quite curious to see what was in store given the recent change in leadership. The server knew immediately that we were vegan and greeted us appropriately. He also knew of my friend's allergies without us having to restate them. That's the kind of attention to detail I expect in this level of establishment so I was pleased with that. We were eating the Gather menu -- the vegetable tasting veganized. And, so it began. We started with an amuse bouche of a split pea puree with dehydrated tomato. For the first course, we had the foraged forest, as they called it. There was a lot on this artistic plate including fried pumpkin, seared hearts of palm, and mulberry powder. I wasn't a big fan of the mulberry, but the pumpkin was delish.  For the second course, there was an poached tomato in olive oil over a cracker and white and ""purple"" asparagus in olive oil with black olive puree. I loved the asparagus -- simple yet elegant. But the cracker was too thick and plain for me. For the third course, there was okra three ways. Crispy okra, pickled okra, and an okra chip. The crispy and pickled okras were both very salty and excellent. The okra chip was kind of plain. The fourth course was one of my favorites. It featured smoked daikon radish, cocoa nibs, hazelnut, creamsicle foam, mandarin orange, and compressed orange juice. Paired with sake, this was a taste explosion. Party in my mouth for sure. The fifth course was my least favorite. The corn panna cotta set with agar agar was weird and rubbery. It was served with cilantro curl, jalapeno gel, and corn shoots. I'll have to given them an ""A"" for presentation though. The sixth course was fried hen of the woods -- freeze dried with morels, juneberry jam, and shiitake mushroom foam. This course was mind-blowingly good. The mushroom flavors with all of the sweet accompaniments made for a savory spectacle.  This next platter is also something to rave about. It included small bites to be eaten in whichever combination you chose. There was date spread, blueberry jam, cashew butter, and hibiscus along with mango panna cotta, rosemary thyme bread, pine nut with sherry reduction, and golden beet foam. It was a hit with the table. The eighth course was a key lime mousse in a waffle cracker with strawberry sorbet and raspberry spread. The waffle cracker and sorbet were fantastic, but the key lime mousse left something to be desired. Lastly, there was the ""pecan pie"" sorghum coated with chocolate ganache with a twill brown sugar cracker, peach sorbet and mint leaf. This was paired with a very nice 15-year aged sherry. They even finished it off with a special sorbet with a rice candle as an early birthday celebration! And gave the table some gelee. We all talked about the experience afterwards and agreed on a number of things. I loved that, for the most part, there were elements of every dish that were good and some dishes were hands-down winners. However, there were some dishes and/or elements thereof that weren't all that tasty. We were very impressed with the servers knowledge of these dishes given that they were made especially for us. The wine pairing I had was okay, but not anything to write home about. Some wines were good and some weren't. And as I mentioned, the ambiance left something to be desired. That said, we had a great time and enjoyed many delicious bites and when I saw the check, I felt that it was appropriate for the price. The meal was $135 (less than they said it would be) and the pairing was only $60 -- so for the value, it was well worth it.  The total ended up being $266, which is quite low for this caliber of restaurant. I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you are looking for a Michelin-star experience at a lower price point as you will definitely have fun tasting all the molecular gastronomy-style food you can over the course of three hours. It's an experience.",0.9991,0.836,0.15,0.014,0.5024179387863599
2015-12-12,2.0,"I think ""underwhelmed"" best classifies the experience. The breakdown is as follows:  Service:  Outstanding. Great explanations of each dish as it came out. Drinks always filled in a timely fashion.  Dish Timing:  The timing between each dish is quite slow. Awkwardly slow at times. After the 2nd dish, you do the math and are painfully realizing that you've got another 1 to 1-1/2 hours of just ""wait"" time total for your remaining dishes.  Food: Very good tasting food for the most part. After hearing so many great things about Moto, I was looking forward to being wowed, and it just wasn't there for me. Don't get me wrong -- the food tastes very good. I just didn't see the ""very good"" value in the ""wow"" price we paid.   Price: Speaking of which, the price was $150/per person for the 8-course menu. We chose this menu since we were a bit skittish (thankfully so in hindsight). I was certainly glad by the end of the evening that I did not sign up for the 18-course menu.

2015-12-12,2.0,"My wife and I came here for her birthday in December and I was both happy and disappointed. The experience overall was very unique for me and the plate presentations were outstanding.  Of the 9 plates we had I would list three as outstanding where all of the others fell flat or were just average. The three tops for me were the Oyster starter, the BBQ Shrimp, and Pumpkin dessert.  My least favorite dish was the Chicken and Dumplings. (Think of a Chick-Fil-A nugget on two dime sized undercooked pieces of dough/flour) We are happy we went for the experience and the service was outstanding, but we will not likely be back. Just too much good food in the city to pay this much, leave hungry, and be disappointed. Our out the door price was ~$385 $300 for two without wine $35 in tax $50 in tip Ultimately we were disappointed that the quality of each dish could not be considered at least good/excellent at this price point. When we think the 'cost out the door' and what we could have had at Joe's or other favorites, that is when the tinge of regret hits.  It is worth a go if you have never had a tasting menu and have something fun to celebrate, but temper your expectations.  Note: if you are like us and leave hungry (most seem to based on reviews) stop in to Carnival on your way home for some Ropa Vieja, Sweet Plantains, and a Mojito.  They are just a few blocks East and their food is filling and tasty with a fun atmosphere that can help you forget just how much money you spent at Moto",0.9593,0.753,0.147,0.1,0.5458333333333333

Below are all the reasons why - We came here for our 1st year anniversary, and were so disappointed with the entire experience - food and service. FOOD: Nothing exciting, 4 of the 9 courses were terrible - we just could not eat them Pork belly - Very salty, fatty and chewy Chicken & dumpling - The chicken was over cooked and tasteless.  The dumpling was a piece of fried dough that was disgusting.  Just go down the street to China town for better Chicken dumplings Duckotash - Kind of like a soup, it was so salty we couldn't eat most of it Carolina beets - The piece of filet was so tough that I couldn't even cut it.  We even showed the assistant manager how tough it was. The other 5 were ok, nothing spectacular.   SERVICE: Was a little disappointing.  I had called and confirmed our reservation, and told them of our food allergies.  When we got to the restaurant, they forgot that I had food allergies and did not have any substitutes for the courses that I was allergic to.  Once we had decided on how we wanted to proceed, it took nearly 15 mins for our first course to come. Did I mention that the assistant manager Alana was our server for the night?  She was friendly, but it felt like we were doing her a favor by being there. Throughout dinner, when we were asked how our food was, we were candid and told them what we thought.  We even offered for them to try the food to see how bad (salty, chewy or tough) it was.   I wouldn't pay more than $20 for that meal.  Given how disappointed we were, moto did not even offer to discount our $500 bill.      WINE: This was the best part of dinner.  We got a fantastic bottle of wine to go with our dinner.  We loved it!  As a warning, the red wine collection is quite bare - 8-12 options to pick from.",0.8105,0.816,0.1,0.084,0.6424119241192412
2015-09-19,4.0,"I really struggled to decide whether this was 3, 4, or 5 stars. How could one restaurant produce such a wide spectrum of ratings? The best part of Moto was the food. They are very creative with their flavors and I haven't had anything that's been as close to Alinea as Moto was. Their take on textures and unique cooking methods was extraordinary. Although there were a few dishes I would pass on if I were to go through the experience again due to personal preferences, only one dish would be because I legitimately thought it was a poor dish. On top of the food, the service is excellent. The worst part of Moto was the amount of time it took to get through the meal. I understand that it's an 18 course meal, but that's no excuse for it to take 5 hours. Even the website states 3.5-4 hours. I am not exaggerating when I say it took 5 hours. We got there early at 7:25 PM and we got in the car at 12:31 AM. That is ridiculous. Alinea was 16 courses and we were out of there in less than 3 hours. I'd have to say for me to try this again, they'll definitely have to work on their pacing. So in the end, I gave it 4 stars.

Desserts were average - coconut and lime was tasty but simple.  The second course - a deconstructed pecan pie didn't work at all - tasted not much like a pecan pie and the balance was all off.

2015-08-19,4.0,"This was an incredible experience-- even for a picky eater like me. A few words of advice though: 1. The reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because our dinner took much longer than we were told it would. This would have been perfectly fine except that we had tickets for a show and needed to leave before our dinner was finished. We were told it would be 4 hours for 18 courses. We added in the extra course at the start for a full 19 and also did the wine pairings. It took us 5 hours to get through 17 courses; we ended up having to miss out on 2 courses. They adjusted our bill and were apologetic, but I'm still disappointed this happened. My advice? Make sure Moto is the only thing you have planned for the evening. Otherwise you will be sad like me. 2. Make your reservation for as early as they will allow you to come. Why? Because then none of the cuisine surprises will be spoiled for you! We were the first people there and we both agreed that half of the fun was not knowing what was coming next. If the people next to you are even just one course ahead then you won't have the same laughs and gasps that we enjoyed. Hope this helps!

2015-07-14,4.0,"After craving ultra modern/ molecular gastronomy for months, I finally took a trip out to Moto. Unfortunately, with the tragic passing of Homaro Cantu, so did the excitement of Moto (at least until Executive chef Chris get's back into the groove of things). Moto was still a nice restaurant to try, but not a 'must eat' in Chicago. [Ambiance 4/5] Similar to a lot of other Michelin or fine dining establishments, Moto had a dimly lit, semi-modern dining room. There was limited artwork and items to keep your eyes busy while waiting for the courses to arrive. A big drawback with Moto is that there isn't an open kitchen or even a window to the kitchen to allow patrons to view the chefs at work. Downstairs, and where the chef table dinners takes place had a completely different feel to the restaurant. A periodic table filled the wall with shelves housing various sized beakers and cylinders. On a different side of the room, molecular gastronomy toys ranging from a dehydrator to a large centrifuge sat on a table.  [Service 3/5] Despite having dinner mid-week, and despite having a relatively empty dining room, the service was sub-par and not something I was expecting from a Michelin starred establishment. While the servers did try to serve dishes in a synchronized manner, more often than not it was an awkward display; as one server would freeze mid-movement to try and mirror the other. Additionally, the dishes were constantly placed off-center and not directly in front of myself, and the utensils were repeatedly replaced at the edge of the table; making for a clunky transition to eating. Lastly the timing between dishes was also awkward, with significant waiting time between courses. [Food 4/5] Despite not being the molecular gastronomy meal I was hoping/envisioned, the food was nonetheless rather tasty. We opted for the 9 course ""Hunt"" menu, but in retrospect should have ordered the full 18 course menu.   Oyster Bar - three different preparations of oyster (raw, fried, steamed) with a variety of toppings (ranging from horseradish powder, to Tabasco pearls) to 'play' with. A very fun tasty dish, and great way to start the meal. Foie and lobster - The tiny portion of lobster was a bit hard and lacked much flavor. While the foie was tasty,because foie gras anything is tasty. Trout and grits - this dish started with a 'show'. A device was brought out to create the broth, utilizing the same concept of a stovetop coffee maker, water boiled and rose to a container holding various spices and herbs. The freshly created broth was then poured over trout and crispy grits. The dish was a lot of fun to watch, but looked a bit better than it tasted. Pork Belly - Smoked pork belly with kimchied collard greens. The collard greens were a bit sour, and the pork belly lacked smoke or flavor on it's own. A bit disappointing dish. Chicken and dumplings - This dish was my favorite, tasty tender chicken on top of a cheesy gnocchi like dumpling. Duckotash - A succotash with duck. Pretty dish and flavorful. Carolina beets - Wagyu beef with carolina bbq marinated beets. While the dish was tasty, unfortunately the beets was by far the star of the show. The wagyu beef was salty, and could have used the same kick as the beets. Lime and Coconut - a key lime mousse over a coconut macaroon. Very light dessert, but was a little dull in flavor. I also fount it a bit weird to be room temperature. Having a warm macaroon or a cold dessert would have made it more enjoyable. Sweet Potato - sweet potato caramel logs with a jalapeno marshmallow. The sweet potato itself was bland as well, but the marshmallow was very flavorful without the spice of the pepper [Value 3/5] When going to a fine dining restaurant, you come in with the expectation to spend a lot of money. While Moto was tasty for the most part, I don't know if it justified the price. I have definitely had better tastings and service for the price. The Wednesday night chef dinners on the otherhand looks like a steal. [Surprises +1] After dinner was finished, we were asked if we would like a kitchen tour. Of course the only answer is ""yes!"" So we went downstairs to the kitchen and met with one of the Sous chefs Trevor. Trevor walked us through the demonstration room, explaining some of the gadgets/appliances and stories of Cantu's experiments in the past. We then were led into the kitchen to meet the team of chefs and the new executive chef Chris Anderson. This after dinner event was a pleasant surprise and one that more restaurants should offer. It's always a pleasure to meet the people creating your food, and see firsthand the skill required to make the dishes. Overall Moto is a solid dining establishment. I do wish the meal incorporated more foams, gels, unexpected textures and fun. And it will be interesting to see if they maintain the Michelin star in the upcoming year.

We got seated right away just before the time of our reservation and waited patiently for our food to arrive. I had chosen the 18 meal course. After our first course arrive and we finished it in less than 5 minutes, due to its small size, we patently waited for the next course, which took about 15 minutes. This pattern of eating a small meal and waiting an average of 15mins continued through the entire night. We arrived to the restaurant at 7:30 and left at 11:50! Seriously what the #@*¥. They need to include the time next to each option in their website! I could have easily saved $200 on a smaller course option, service fee and taxes having known this prior to the outing. Plus, we were still hungry by the end of the night as the courses were too small and too spread apart. What started as a fun experience ended up as a tiresome and excruciating experience. My wife was so tired and unhappy by the end ordeal that we went straight to sleep! We will definitely not come back again and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save your money and go to some other nicer place in Chicago!",0.965,0.793,0.134,0.073,0.42591269841269846

Moto has been compared to Alinea, Next, Goosefoot and other pretty fantastic restaurants. I think the similarity people are seeing is that it's a multi-course tasting menu with a scientific/""showy"" presentation to all their dishes. Other than that- Moto is stands alone as being original and thoughtful with their food. One of the highlights is being able to go into the kitchen (The Lab) after your meal and meet the kind folks who made that delicious meal for you and see where some of your stuff is not only made but also grown!

2015-05-18,5.0,"One of the best, if not the best, meals I have ever had.  I've been to numerous Michelin-starred restaurants, and I would definitely place Moto right near the top w/ some of my favorites (Gary Danko, Manresa, Redd, Wakuriya, State Bird Provisions). Everything was top notch - from the food to the service to the ambiance.  The funny thing is, my friends and I weren't even planning on eating here when we dined at Moto on a Friday night. We had planned on eating at another restaurant in the West Loop, but when we were quoted a wait time of 2 hours, we decided to make reservations at another nearby restaurant. We had an hour to kill before our reservation, so we decided to grab a drink at a nearby speakeasy. Upon arriving at said speakeasy, we were unable to get in (deservedly so, as we didn't have reservations and we were just hoping we'd get lucky). Moto is right around the corner from said speakeasy, and my friend and his girlfriend had been wanting to try this place. I decided to see if they had reservations just for fun, definitely not expecting to get a seat at a Michelin-starred restaurant on such short notice. However, to our surprise, there was one open time slot for a party of 3. We went back and forth as to where we wanted to eat, and in the end we ended up picking Moto - and I'm so glad we did. We arrived and were greeted with a warm smile by the hostess, who literally said ""um, did you guys JUST make a reservation?"" to which we all laughed and told her about the little adventure we just went on. She took us to your table and told us about the 2 options - a 9-course tasting menu or an 18-course tasting menu. We were feeling very Drake-ish so we said YOLO and ended up getting the 18-course tasting menu, complete w/ wine pairing (note: the wine pairing for the 18-courser is only for 12 of the dishes). This was tied for the biggest tasting menu I have had to date (I also did an 18-course tasting menu at Benu in SF). The whole meal lasted about 4.5 hours and the timing between each dish was PERFECT. I'm going to save the best for last, so I'll review the food at the end (edit: already hit the character limit, so I can't review the food - just know that each dish was  bomb.com ). Service: Phenomenal. Our server, Mike, was friendly and lively throughout the entire night. We were there from 8:30 pm - 1 am, and not once did his friendliness or enthusiasm waver. He was extremely knowledgable and answered all our questions, from the wine, to the food, to the restaurant's microgarden - Mike was dropping knowledge bombs all night. He was so amicable that we ended up talking about anything and everything we could think of; we even found out that he's also from the Bay Area (as was our whole dinner party). We were the last party in the restaurant, and there was never a moment where it felt like the servers were trying to rush us to get us out of there. I expect outstanding service from any Michelin-starred restaurant, and the service at Moto does not disappoint.  Ambiance: the ambiance here is very unique, which I loved. Unlike some Michelin-starred restaurants I've dined at, there is no hint of snobbiness or pretentiousness here. Moto is an elegant restaurant w/ a modern feel, and the crowd of diners was very eclectic. One thing I loved was the music - I'm so used to hearing some nice classical music or elevator music, but I was very delighted w/ the music selection here. They played any and everything, from Grammatik to Tupac to Chromeo to Alabama Shakes! I thought this was a great touch that added to the fun atmosphere. Wine: the sommelier at Moto knows his sh*t. Every dish that had a wine accompaniment was enhanced because of the artful work of the sommelier. If you dine at Moto, you definitely need to do the wine pairing. Food: let me start off by saying that I LOVED every single dish. I feel that there's usually 1 dish I could do without with most tasting menus, but this was not the case. Again, we went w/ the 18-course tasting menu and were blown away. Note 1: an * denotes a dish w/ a wine pairing Note 2: I've hit the character limit already haha, so I can't describe each plate. Trust me - they're all amazing! -Oyster bar* -Forest forage* -Grow room* -Shishito* -Poached tomato heart and asparagus salad -Foie and lobster* -Smoked radish* -18 month aged ham and stock -Fallen log -Trout and grits* -Pork belly* -Spring onion* -Chicken and dumplings* -Short rib and country peas* -Cucumber and citrus -Lime and coconut* -Angel food -Cherry strawberry pistachio cobbler -Mousse and strawberry Apparently, when you make a reservation they provide you with copies of the menu. However, since we dined here on a whim and didn't give them ample time for a heads up, they took down our mailing address and will be mailing us a copy of the menu from when we dined there. Major props for that. TL;DR: Moto is a fantastic dining experience. Well worth the $. Eat here & get the wine pairing - you won't regret it",0.9995,0.803,0.184,0.013,0.5164260912698413

Its not in some fancy building or unique part of the city. This in mind, that ambiance is incredible. We ate dinner downstairs in their prep area, and it was very cool. The elements written across the walls, chefs cooking, and staff all set a fantastic ambiance.  Food: As you can quickly tell by the photos posted on Yelp, the menu is constantly changing. You can visit Moto's website to see what you will be eating when you go. This being said, every course was better than the next! Everything had a story behind it. An example of this was our bison which had been hunted in Texas by helicopter and killed with a bow which was served with salad which had been growing for the past couple weeks at the restaurant. Defiantly not something you would get from your average dinner.  Staff: The staff was fantastic! They were overly nice, knew the ins and outs of their menu, and kept us entertained. Plus at the massive price tag they were able to keep my glass of water full... this was nice :).  Price: I usually don't factor price in to my reviews, but at nearly $500 for a dinner its worth pointing out that Moto is an expensive experience. I say experience rather than meal, because its not just a meal. We were there for about 3 hours enjoying everything. The price breaks down to $180 per person plus an included 20% tip.

2014-09-14,4.0,"I'm really torn on this place, probably a 3.5 but ultimately deserved a 4 rating but its not a restaurant I'd recommend or return to. The vibe is a bit too modern for me. The huge secluded tables when you first walk in are cool, I was instantly disappointed I was not sitting there. The main dining area is too dark and vacant, seems big when it isn't. The two top table is the longest table I've ever seen for a 2 person dinner. You are so far apart from your partner it made sharing items and conversation difficult.  I was also right next the drink island and I was constantly bumped  into by staff. Service was prompt and nice.  They articulately described the dishes and pairings, but it was off rote memorization. I was there a touch more of personality and connection in those interactions.   The first dish which was a bite of all the dishes to come was a unique way to wet your appetite.  The second highlight was the wine pairings which were well thought. The dishes were playful and creative, pleasing to the eye. However, they were all too small, especially for the price point. I wasn't remotely close to being full upon leaving. That also could have had something to do with a totally unacceptable 4.5 hour running time for dinner.  A meal like this should never take more than 3.  The pacing was horrendous. Our first dish didn't arrive until we had bee there 30 minutes, then the next several courses were 20 minutes apart. It finally picked up at the end but by then you are hungry, annoyed, and or drunk.    The only dish that was a total dud was the pearls of melon. No flavor, boring, should have been a mid dinner palate cleanser.  The chicken and the egg was ok, but a let down after you're being told you'll get fried chicken. The birds nest was another miss. The grilled goat was excellent, the mushroom was perfect, and the pork belly and thyme was a perfect savory finish. A few ups and downs, but ultimately for the portion size, and length of dinner at this price point there are 10 better options to try when you are spending this much money.",0.9662,0.774,0.133,0.094,0.5868253968253968
2014-08-04,4.0,"You know going into it that you're going to get some special food, and good service, and you know you're going to pay a lot. I guess I assumed that the setting would have a more intimate ambiance. It felt surprisingly unromantic. It may have been just bad luck that night, but there were tables full of loud, rowdy groups around who kept the overall ambiance less romantic or intimate, and made it feel a lot more like what I'd expect if I took my date to Chili's. Well, except for the fact that at Chili's I wouldn't be seated so far away from her.  Sure, I realize the wide table makes it easier to fit the dozens of wine glasses that are going to be there, but I'd like to have felt more within reach of my date, and not as if I needed to speak up in order to be heard... kinda felt like everyone else was listening to us. And they were. Among the 14 courses, there are some hits and some misses. When they're good, they're astoundingly good. And when they're not, they're not bad, but merely disappointing. And for the 12 wine pairings, I'd say that all but the first two were good. They led off with wines that taste like granite, which is entirely interesting, but a strange choice. Perhaps the most interesting part of the night was the mad scientist beaker system in which the after-dinner coffee was prepared. If you go, do make sure to order a coffee at the end. I wouldn't take back my experience. The service was impeccable, and on a few occasions even felt almost choreographed. And that, combined with the broad array of foods and wines we tasted -- I think -- justified the cost. If you've never been, you should absolutely go.

2014-05-31,3.0,"The food was objectively good. I'm not sure anyone can really argue otherwise. But I feel like Michelin star restaurants, especially when they cost this much should be held to a higher standard. Moto can't really be compared to the greasy burger joint down the road. And this review will not attempt to do that. The reason for the three star rating is that Moto does not live up to expectations compared to itself.  First, the actual space is really weird. The door next to the sign saying ""Moto"" is not the door you want to enter through. It's the door to the right of that one. Except that door might be locked and you'll have no idea how you're supposed to get to your dinner. You are taken down to the basement, which I guess is what they call the ""lab."" There are about four tables down there, but it looks very industrial, so it's not a cozy familial feel, but rather a desolate one of isolation. Also, you stare at a wall of periodic elements that are annoyingly not in order.  We did the 8-course chef's dining experience. On the website, it's advertised as sitting at the chef's table and cooking with the chef. The wording on the website was obviously misleading as we got to meet Richie Farina for about one minute before each course. Halfway through, his sous-chefs and the waiters started introducing the meals instead of him. The 1-on-1 cooking demo was him mixing together sorbet in liquid nitrogen. The ""grow room"" wasn't even that impressive. It was basically potted herbs growing a temperature-controlled room. I think the restaurant was expecting customers to be impressed based on his celebrity alone, but I don't feel like I got that much extra out of it. People who did not opt for the chef's experience got a 16-course menu, with equally creative dishes as the ones we got. To be fair, I don't know what their cost was, but my point is that if you are choosing the 8-course option just to meet Richie, don't bother.  I'll end on a nice note. The dishes actually were pretty creative. My favorite were the deconstructed hot wings. There was seared quail on a bed of celery and blue cheese puree with a garnish of hot sauce. It was everything good about hot wings, done in a molecular gastronomy style. Others at my table liked the onion dish (don't kiss anyone afterwards). I loved the scallops and buffalo tartare. By far the best presentation was this thing that looked like a log in a secluded woodland. To be honest, I didn't care for the taste, but I greatly appreciate the creativity behind the dish. It came complete with something that looked like a worm living in the dirt next to the log (but was thankfully not a worm).  Bottom line: It's molecular gastronomy, but I expected more. And I definitely expected more from the chef's experience.",0.9959,0.793,0.154,0.053,0.5749919015225138

Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend any foodie to go. It ended up being about $500 for two which is pricy but worth the experience.  In case you are debating between this and Alinea I will note that Alinea is the superior restaurant but also cost twice as much. We went 6 months ago for our one year anniversary and two meal tickets + wine pairings ended up around $1,000. Not a meal you do every day but worth it for a special occasion. You get what you pay for but by no means did this mean I didn't enjoy Moto. I just wish I would have gone to Moto first and then gone to Alinea (not the other way around). First world problems I know :) One thing about the sci-fi dishes - sometimes if felt more like science/art then food. One dish was called roadkill and it literally looked like roadkill. It tasted quite delicious but I was still struggling to eat it as it looked so unappetizing. This didn't bother my husband so maybe its just me.... My only (tiny complaint) is that it felt just a little disorganized. When I booked the dinner they asked what occasion we were celebrating so they could print out a personalized menu. We never got the menu at the end of the meal and there was a little confusion when we checked in.

Some courses were essentially inedible... the unsealed wood box (possibly from Michael's Crafts) filled with greasy herbs (herbs reused from diner to diner?) and fatty lamb was a poor attempt at an effort to offer something more ethereal but translated as pretentious.

A shot of special-made apple cider juice for your taste buds. 2. Herbs grown in a jar with coco fiber (not dirt). The server cut the herbs and topped it on our buffalo tar tar and funions-like-chip.  3. Salmon with carrot vinaigrette and ""aged"" carrots. Onions covered in salmon roe sauce. Drops of black licorice sauce. ""Aged"" carrots: Calcium oxcide then roasted after.  4. Aromatic seaweed in a hand carved box with searing rocks to keep the scallop hot. It also came with a piece of king crab and prince edward clam. 5. A glass jar with an aroma of hickory and autumn leaf seeping thru. The lid had veggie jerky, caramel onions and chips. It was my second least favorite.   6. Chilled eggshells full of truffle foam and creamy cheese!!! Our favorite! Came with another dish with chicken raised in an Amish farm in france. Side of brussel sprouts.  7. Food on little sticks that are stuck to a big stick of magnet. Our least favorite but the most creative presentation. The dish had squab, shiitake bread pudding, a cube of sweet potato and string beans.  8. Boar shoulder and boar leg jerky topped with mole powder with guajillo chile. Side of puffed rice with a  corn nutty taste.  9. Onion entre with smoked apple rabbit bacon in a ginormous round fish bowl. It was really tasty and not as stinky. 10. Picnic entre! A small box of grass with cheese/bread sitting on top. The entre came with mini napkins which looked like picnic blankets. Cheese truffle walnut, wisconson cheese with pesto and bread, goat cheese (?) and cheese with a dab of raspberry. 11. Foi gras!! the highlight of our meal!!!! It was so good with the apple butter/slices and chest nuts.  12. Chopped up green strawberry  garnished with solid dehydrated sweet milk and dehydrated cucumber skin topped with edible flowers. The sweet milk made the strawberry sweet. Good for people who wants something light for dessert.  13. Date cake soaked in pear  foam and pansy flower. Loved the texture and it's so sweet! 14. Mouse chocolate with chocolate crumble with lemon chips lemon cream and basil.  It was yummy but it wasn't something to rave about.  15. Inside-out-S'mores. Chocolate ganache wrapped with graham cracker then covered with vanilla bean marshmallow. They served them on a stick and a small wooden dish with a small fire in the middle to cook. Very romantic.

2014-03-25,4.0,"I've heard great things about this place so I thought it was the perfect place to have Lance's birthday celebration (being that it's a week late, it had to be a good make up dinner) and I was so glad I chose to come to Moto.  Lance and I both love asian and asian fusion so moto was a pretty good choice for both of us. The interior was designed nicely so that it was spacious and intimate but without feeling overly pretentious or uncomfortable. Albeit, we had a pretty rude couple next to us who said some very inappropriate things about us when they didn't think we could hear. Rude. However, the food was amazing. And it was really sweet that they personalized the menu with ""Happy birthday Lance"" and even gave us two copies to take home.  The funny thing about moto that I love was that there was no dish descriptions but merely a ""title"" to the dish. it makes you wonder what's going to come and each time, we're pleasantly surprised. Anyways, here goes: 1. Growroom: a beef tartare with cute curly crispy noodles and their ""fresh"" greens. Literally, they cut it at the table for us and it was funny because the waiter said ""This is literally the freshest salad you will get in Chicago"". Two minutes fresh haha 2. Aged Carrot: the carrot was cooked so it seemed and tasted almost like sweet potato fries. And the poached salmon was perfectt. Not overly cooked but not totally raw. Exactly how we love it. 3. Ocean Flavors: the seared scallops were delicious as well as the various other pieces that complimented it.  4. Which came first: lance's favorite dish. Chicken breast and thigh along with an egg with some custard in it. Perfect compliments to each other. Loved the sort of runny egg/custard. Except...I totally broke the shell embarrassingly and tried my best not to make it obvious -_- 5. Allium 6.0: not the most memorable dish being that the title doesn't even really ring a bell but I'm sure the attached pictures will help. I do recall the bit of rabbit (?) meat and I remember commenting that it was quite delicous. So not a bad dish, just not comparable to the others.  6. Fallen log: a cute little: lance thought this was good but I'm not a huge fan of sausage. It was complimented well by the sauce but I personally ended up giving him mine. 7. Thyme capsule: a treasure box with LOADS of thyme and two skewers. One with lamb confit and the other with pork belly confit. Both were absolutely delicious and the play of senses with smell and taste really intensified the experience.  8. Beef and broccoli: this was an interesting dish. The box had three parts to it, so as you were eating the wagyu beef on top, the pho broth on the bottom layer was steaming the broccoli in the middle. Our only issue with this dish was that it seemed overly salty. And that's coming from two people who love salt.  9. Sus Scrofa: omigosh, the pork shoulder in this dish was amazingg. So tender, juicy, and full of flavor. There was so much going on in this dish but not in a bad way. Everything mixed together very well. 10. Picnic: a cute idea. A cheese course with four different cheese made to feel like you were out in the grass (literally there was a column of grass) with picnic napkins. I loved the truffle cheese but lance loved the mixture of cranberry with a white cheese.  11. Strawberries and cream: a good, clean palate cleanser. Approved by both of us 12. Date Cake: Not really a cake but more a mixture of cake-ish crumbs and dates and pear. I devoured all the pears..and well...Lance devoured the rest haha 13. Chocolate Mousse: I LOVED the lemon sorbet and lemon puree in this dish. The mousse itself was good but nothing too distinct.  14. Toasted marshmallows: This was a fun dish because they bring over a piece of log that they light and you get to make your own smores right at the table. The cool part is that it looks like just a marshmallow on a stick but INSIDE the marshmallow, they stuffed chocolate and graham crackers. So creative and delicious!!

DO NOT let this be your fallback if you can't get reservations to Alenia.  Let me say this, if you know about food, you are a great cook, you are a foodie, you eat all over the world, or you know what good food is all about DO NOT EAT HERE. It is an expensive disappointment. The place was nearly empty when we got there - not shocking. I don't know who our server actually was, because random people brought out the food and wine. The girl, who I think was our server, knew absolutely nothing about the wines. We wanted to add on the wine pairings fro $85 each, but wanted to know WHAT we were drinking. When the glasses were poured before (or during - ugh) the course they were paired with, the server couldn't even tell us what they were. Just, ""this is the sauv blanc. enjoy!"" Thanks. not. Our first course was that roll up your own sushi dish. It tasted like card board. Our second course was served on a plate shaped like a scallop shell. It was a black potato and leek soup, but it looked like gulf coast after the BP spill. Best thing we ate, but I could get that shit at a diner for $5. We asked that if we were underwhelmed on the next dish, AGAIN, that we would like to pay for what we had an leave. Ooooh, but then the magic happened. The Italian Biosphere.  It was this huge glass fish bowl with dirt looking stuff on the bottom. We were told it contained truffles and given miniature shovels to eat with. Cute idea? No. Have you eaten dirt since you were a kid and want to feel nostalgic again? Eat this shit. It literally tasted like dirt. CHECK PLEASE! I asked for the Maître D and our wine pourer had no idea WTF I was talking about. Um, the manager then, please? He comes over, total douchebag. I told him we wanted to pay for what we ate and drank and get the hell outta there.  Well, douchebags apparently can't do math, he ended up bringing the check back for the remaining 6 courses and wine we didn't consume instead of the 3 or 4 we did. I asked him to please double check his math, and he stormed off like a little girl having a hissy fit.  Again, the check comes back. We were being charged gratuity on the entirety of the meal, not what we had! So I called him back over and said, ""I think you miscalculated the gratuity."" To which he responded, ""DID YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SERVICE TONIGHT MA'AM?!"" At that point, I really think we should have just walked out, but we waited patiently for him to come back with the appropriate bill, paid, and left. Check out the photo of our bill. Asshat.

We ordered the standard meal (no dietary restrictions) and the wine pairings.  Luis, our main waiter, was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. They started us off with a plate cleansing shot. It was unexpected and wonderful, especially since my mom was chewing gum before we got there. The dishes were amazing. First they brought a plate with a tiny taste from each dish we'd have that night. This was such an exciting start, so interesting and smart. After this we couldn't wait to experience each dish.  My favorites: Squash suspension- wow- This was the first dish that I deemed my favorite. I loved the clean presentation and how the bowl drew your nose in and invited you to smell the dish as you tasted. The rabbit was tender and wonderful with the slightly sweet squash. Paired with the crunchy cracker, it was just delightful. Light yet robust. I wish I could make this at home! WHICH came first? - Presentation was fun- the server explained this was Moto's take on ""what came first- the chicken or the egg?"" There was fried chicken skin- mmmmmmmmm! The chicken, polenta, brussel sprouts- all wonderful and a tastier, more tender version of a home cooked chicken dinner. But the real star- the egg! There was some kind of sweet cream in an egg shell with shredded truffle on top. Oh my goodness, if I could have licked the inside of the egg to get every tasty bit out of there I would have! Fantastic!! BAKING 101- Our favorite dessert. A mixing bowl and spatula were brought out with ingredients to 'make your own batter'... it was not only fun and silly, it was absolutely scrumptious. Licking the 'dough' off the spatula was pure genius and made us giggle like kids.  Every dish was creative and so flippin' yummy. They put a ton of thought into making their food a unique sensory experience. I can't imagine enjoying this meal as much as we did without the wine pairings. Each was perfectly paired to balance out the dish it was married with. They were interesting and beautiful themselves and fantastic when eaten with the food. Luis explained each one in depth and was able to answer questions about them. There was another female server who stopped by the table a couple times as we were drinking a few of the pairings and she would gush about how delicious they were too. We loved how excited and familiar they were with the food and wine; it made it feel like they were along for the ride with you. As we finished up, Luis said it seemed like we enjoyed the experience and so would we enjoy a tour of the kitchen? We said absolutely. He led us down the stairs to the ""laboratory,"" which was full with three large parties. He pointed out the equipment and what each machine was used for. It was the sort of futuristic machinery I expected to see and I wasn't disappointed. We then checked out the grow room, which was cool and unique. Finally, we were lead into the kitchen where we saw dishes coming together and the queuing system. It was fun to see the impressive production behind the food.  All in all, it was a fantastic and unique experience! GO!!!",0.9993,0.756,0.237,0.007,0.6931349206349205

We were in Chicago celebrating my birthday and I must admit that we only booked Moto due to not being abel to get a reservation at Alinea. For $500!!!! I was super excited and I had high expectations that this was going to be one of the best dining experiences.  Well sadly we were very DISAPPOINTED!! We had a horrible booth right by the door and hostess stand, which right away was a turn off. Our server never bother to fully explain our course for the evening, we had a female busser who seemed new, she was very sweet but had no professional demeanor about her. After the first couple of courses we were completely bored, there was no energy in the room, even the people working they looked super bored, it was literally torture just sitting there . Every course took 15-20 mins to be brought to our table and our ""three"" hour experience turned to be almost four hours!!!!! I really wanted to like this place, but it was a huge fail. I felt bad saying anything to my husband, because he went out of his way to plan our entire evening. We left hungry, and very discouraged that they would even charge 18% gratuity to our bill, since the service was not up to par.  I hate that I even have to write a review, but I really feel like we got ripped off and the only reason I give this place a two star is for the creativity in making the food.",-0.9208,0.734,0.123,0.143,0.5990099148163665

I seldom write reviews and Hate that I even feel the need to write a negative one but I was REALLY DISAPPOINTED...     The booths had really high backs to them that made you feel really excluded which would be fine except the restaurant didn't have any energy to it all!! They sat us right next to the hostess stand so the only choice of scenery we had was each other, the booth, ceiling and a HOSTESS stand...

The waiter came to the table and asked us what we would like to start with to drink and we both wanted martinis which again i had already been told in advance that they had a full bar and this was not the case at all and had to resort to a bottle of wine. When the waiter did the presentation he let me try the wine and poured my wife a glass and just walked away without even pouring myself a glass. I waited 10 minutes before anyone even realized I did not have any wine in my glass. We made it through the first two courses and at this point we over heard another table being told that it took 3 and half hours to finish dinner and at the rate we were going and it being 90 degrees in the restaurant this was unacceptable service so i went and talked to the manager and told him about all the issues we were having and that we did not have 3 and a half hours to eat dinner and that we would like to pay for what we had and leave. The manager charged us 80 dollars for literally 6 pieces of twigs in my opinion as a salad starter and 6 quarter size pieces of salmon. Then on top of that he did comp the wine but preceded to charge us a 35 dollar fee for uncorking the wine that we bought from them which is a total scam and then charged us a 20 percent service charge on top of that. So to be realistic, if your gonna charge me 175.00 to begin with per person, I would expect you to have black napkins when we are both wearing black and that you have a full service bar if you tell a guest you do and the air conditioning is on.

Overall, presentation looked nice.  There was a creative chese and bread picnic course, where the pairings were ""plated"" on real grass, and you got a red and white checkered napkin to go with it.  I really didn't care for the opening raw scallop dish or the onion course since the onion powder was way too strong, and no matter how much you had me at ""ice cream"", onion ice cream ain't gonna work.

The wine pairings were also adventurous and wonderfully done.  The allium course pairing in particular was striking.  The food really brought out a flavor in the wine that I hadn't noticed when I tried it before the food. Which brings me to a point regarding the service.  Very well coordinated -- each new wine glass was brought out and each wine poured at the exact right time.  Each dish was cleared at the right time and the pacing of the meal was just right.

2013-04-15,5.0,"Such a unique experience. I would have to say the food (which was excellent) was only half of what made this 4 hour visit so special. Our waiter, Quinton, was extremely informed about what would show up on our table, acting more like a tour guide at a science museum than someone putting food in front of you.  My main concern was paying a lot of money to have small plates with small amounts of food put in front of me and leaving hungry. As each plate arrived with it's unique aromas and flavors, you get lost in the momentum. Those worries left my conscience as I got lost in the experience. The waitstaff are in constant communication to time the arrival of your next course. When it does arrive it usually is accompanied by some fanfare, my favorite was the seafood course, served on rocks with a fantastic smoked aroma, and the goat course and it's wonderful rolled meat. I was lucky enough to get a personal tour of the kitchen by Chef Chip, ever so passionate about his work and explaining what goes into these concepts.

2013-04-06,4.0,"Lovely, fun & whimsical.   Staff was attentive and didn't take themselves too seriously.  When they saw that we liked to eat faster than most diners they paced the courses accordingly.  Others took much more time and they were accommodated as well.   Everything was delicious.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was a failed dessert, some sort of ""make your own"" cookie dough dish which just didn't gel with the rest of the menu, in my opinion.   We enjoyed the wine (sake, beer) pairing very much.  It's obviously a place for celebrations and special occasions, so if it's too expensive for you, um...how about you go somewhere else?  I saved my pennies to celebrate there and knew what I was in for before I made the reservation. As for they food portions, I would have to agree that mos were pretty small.  But suddenly the dessert portions got really big.  I would try to balance that just a bit.

2013-02-18,3.0,"First, I should preface this by saying that this definitely was a delicious meal. The courses were well timed, the wine was well paired, and the meats were very delicious and tender. That said, when you're paying over $250 PER PERSON, the standards become significantly higher. Add to that the hype and buzz around this place, and they've got a lot to live up to. Before you go, keep these things in mind: -BUSINESS SEEMED SLOW. Moto's 15 Minutes might be coming to an end soon. I'm not sure if this was a fluke, but it was Valentine's Day, so it should have been PACKED. Instead, the entire front portion of their restaurant was empty because it was ""too cold"" to put people there, and the lower level was only half filled. -THE BATHROOMS. If you're read my reviews, you know I almost always comment on bathrooms. These bathrooms are nice, modern, and clean... but I don't think they were thinking practically when they designed it. The toilet has a sign next to it telling you you have to bend down near the floor (with your face practically in the toilet) to find the ""flush"" button. This means that your face is like two inches from the toilet when you flush. I found this to be disgusting and rather inappropriate for such an expensive restaurant.  -MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY? I'd heard crazy stories about this place: drinking out of an egg and desserts that taste like cake but look like a half smoked cigar. THAT'S what my foodie brain was hoping to see and taste - and THAT kind of creativity might have bumped this review up to 4 stars. But, I think they have just started to run out of ideas. There didn't seem to be much molecular gastronomy going on. I mean, sure, they aerated some butter and put some sauce in a hollowed out clementine, but that's not mind blowing molecular gastronomy, and it's definitely not worth $520. -SERVICE. The servers were very much on-point, well-timed, and professional. At times, we did find them to be a bit too hyper and chatty for such a nice place, but over all, they were knowledgeable and helpful. The sommelier put together a wonderful wine list, which we appreciated.  We did have a bit of a hiccup toward the end - their internet went out, so they had to let it re-boot before they could scan our card and let us go on our way. We ended up waiting an extra thirty minutes (at 10:30 at night on Valentine's Day) for them to fix this issue. I don't understand why they couldn't have copied our card and let us go. It made us feel like they didn't trust that we had the money to pay, and they wanted to make sure the transaction cleared. As we waited, they didn't do much to ease the issue, either... They offered us coffee or tea, but they should really be offering an extra glass of wine or something (I'm not interested in caffeine at 10:30 at night). -OVERALL? It's definitely an experience in fine dining. The price tag is pretty hefty, but we knew that going in, so it wasn't a big deal. I think of it this way: When I was in Middle School, I was obsessed with rock climbing, so my parents paid for me to have a Saturday morning rock climbing adventure in Colorado. I got to climb a bolder and it was a wonderful memory. They paid for that EXPERIENCE. Moto is similar - it's an experience of sight, taste, and smell. Now that I've tried it, I have the experience and won't be going back - but it was definitely fun to try and it's a fun story to have.",0.9966,0.816,0.138,0.046,0.4893810916179338
2013-02-09,5.0,"On Christmas Eve, working for Ebenezer Scrooge, I checked Facebook and saw a post by Chef Homaro Cantu asking what holiday wishes people were hoping for this season.  I responded honestly with, ""To eat at moto.""  Much to my surprise, Chef wrote back that he was feeling generous in the holiday spirit and invited me and a guest to dinner.  I was floored, the jaw almost fell off my face as I jumped up and down in excitement.  The kindness of this man who I admire in so many ways already, both personally and professionally, made my year.  From his rough and tumble childhood, Chef overcame so many obstacles to become the innovator who is radically changing the culinary mindset, melding science, art, love, and gastronomy, in addition to being a father, husband and miracle berry genius, helping to eliminate the growing epidemic of sugar addiction. Our evening started with TASTING menu, a plate of amuses, each bite representing the courses to come.   1.  BLANC de blancs; Pierre Gimonnet Blanc de Blancs 1er cru, Cuis, Champagne, France, nv and Dewanoyuki, Snowflake, Junmai Sake, Yamagata, Japan A trio of mahi, snapper and scallops with hearts of palm, sea beans and flowers.  By far, my favorite course of the evening with the perfectly seasoned and prepared fish course, beautifully presented on a long glass plate to share between us.  How can you go wrong when you start the evening with a premiere cru Champagne?  My current drink of choice, but also a second pairing of sake so smooth, my tastebuds were dancing in heaven. 2.  BREAKFAST radish; Chasing Harvest Riesling, Central Otago, New Zealand, 2010 Visually stunning, the simplicity of each radish slice - purple ninja, black, pickled, raw, highlighted by a burst of flavors and textures from frozen sunchoke puree, watermelon, lime, candied Buddha's hand, brioche crouton, radish blossoms, sorrel, and a brown butter dust paired with a dry riesling  3.  RIVER; Domaine Guiberteau, Clos de Guichaux, Chenin Blanc, Saumur, France, 2008 A glass terrarium arrives at the table, filled with a hazy Cherrywood smoke, smooth river rocks, Serbian sturgeon, trout, Washington salmon sashimi draped over the stones and garnished with wheatgrass, served alongside everything bagel, saltine, and potato blini with lemon creme fraiche.  Not going to find this play on lox and bagels anywhere better! 4.  STICKS & stones; Paul Cluver, Gewurztraminer, Elgin, South Africa, 2011 A sweet wine for an unexpectedly sweet course - sticks and stones made out of Granny Smith apples, salsify, carrots, adorned with micro arugula, fromage blanc snow, pear butter puree and apple skin gastriche.   5.  DUCK a l'orange; Domenico Clerico, Pajana, Barolo, Italy, 2008 A forest of flavor in a glass jar, with the interaction of harvesting the orange bowl and being saucier at the table, drizzling the lid of seared duck, micro swiss chard, ""scallop"" of potato, gingery carrots in a fragrant orange jus with a BIG Barolo to stand up to the strong flavors 6.  DUELING shoulders; Avelada, Follies, Touriga Nacional/Cabernet Sauvignon, Beiras, Portugal, 2010 An aromatic hunk of tree with giant cinnamon bark, pine cones and juniper is ignited to smoke while you feast on wild board shoulder in a red wine glaze and a porcelet shoulder (suckling pig fed only milk) with caramelized milk, rutabaga puree, balsamic reduction, radicchio puree, dehydrated cippolini onions and micro arugula 7.  BEEF & cauliflower; Beatrice et Pascal Lambert, Les Terasses, Chinon, France, 2011 Cruciferous veg - Romanesco, cauliflower, broccoli, pureed, roasted, and cubed with Texan sirloin, veal demi-glace and shaved white Oregon truffles, toying with my childhood Chinese fave of beef and broccoli, elevated to a whole new level 8.  REINDEER lichen;  Dominio IV, Song of an Uncaged Bird, Syrah, Columbia Gorge, Oregon, 2006 I wish all my food was served on a heated stone and artfully prepared with eye popping color and flavor as was the tender bison loin chop carpaccio, white mulberry, white beech, maitake, and enoki mushrooms, caramelized onions and crispy, limey moss. 9.  BEET of the night; Altocedro, Tempranillo, La Consulta, Argentina, 2011 What is a winter meal without a blood red beet?  Foie gras truffle mousse dusted with coffee grounds encasing a beet center on a savory shortbread cookie, beautifully balanced between sweet and savory, beet emulsion, chicory jelly, balsamic reduction, roasted beet and bull's blood micro-greens scream with flavor from a stark off center white plating emphasizing the deep, luscious hue, balanced by a very mild Tempranillo.

2013-01-25,5.0,"Food - 5/5 Staff - 5/5 Decor - 5/5 Bang for you buck - 5/5 (And this is with the price being really expensive) I love this place. I've always wanted to check out this restaurant after seeing the great reviews on tv. So I ended up coming here with my mom and my sister who were visiting Chicago for the first time. Because I was travelling in Brazil for work, I set up the reservation about 2 weeks in advance using Open Table. Seeing how my phone did not work while in Brazil, I could not receive any phone calls until 4 days before the reservation when I flew back. The staff had called me a couple times to make sure that nobody had any allergic reactions to anything. Seeing how my mom was allergic to oysters, they were informed and they said this would not be a problem. I was called again the day of the reservation just to remind me that I had a reservation that night. Because my mom likes to eat a little earlier, we had a reservation for 7 pm and when we arrived, there was only one other couple inside. The restaurant is not very big so there are only a handful of tables. The decor was very relaxing and quiet. The waiter confirmed again that my mom could not eat oysters. I had forgotten that she also couldn't eat pineapples and this was told to the waiter who then said that he would inform the chefs and that this would not be a problem. We selected a wine for the dinner instead of going with the wine pairing option as my family members do not drink that much. Before they let us try the wine, one waiter poured a little bit of wine into a glass just to make sure that the wine was not bad. She then poured the wine into a decanter and let it sit for a little bit before pouring me a small sample just to re-confirm that the wine was good (which it was). Our first dish was the tasting menu which contained 13 small pieces of the main food for each dish that we would be eating that night. From then, each dish was brought out in a timely manner and explained to us. Because my mom is allergic to oysters, they made a different dish for her when the oyster dish was brought out. However, it was similar enough stylistically that if another table had looked over, they would have not known that my mom was not eating oysters. Each dish was just enough food and decorated unbelievably that by the end of the meal, we had not over eaten but were definitely full and satisfied. The menu changes each season so you'll never get the same thing twice.  Each time we had finished a dish, 3 waiters came to our table and at the same time, removed our plates. When a new plate was to arrive, the plates were all set in front of us at the exact same time. NOW THIS IS SERVICE!! When I had to go to the bathroom, one of the waiters walked quickly ahead of me and opened the door to get the the bathroom. When I was ready, he was waiting for me again and opened the door for me.  Of course you're going to pay a pretty penny when you come here and we knew well in advance that we would be dishing out a little bit of dough before we came. However, I can definitely say that for how much the meal cost, the service, experience and food was worth it!!",0.9868,0.915,0.072,0.013,0.5024276957610291
2013-01-21,4.0,"Lets start by saying that if I could give 4.5 stars I would. Service and food are the most important components of an upscale dining experience while the latter was outstanding the former was banal. We were immediately seated and our coats were checked. We were seated close to other patrons which slightly detracts from what was otherwise a serendipitous experience. The speed of the service was well paced and took about three and a half hours to complete the fifteen course meal.  The attention to detail was impeccable however the noisy dining room in conjunction with our very fast talking server resulted in us missing small portions of  course descriptions.  The flavours were very complex, distinct, and bright. The presentation of each course was unique and beautiful while remaining approachable. Moto harvests and utilizing micro herbs and greens from an inhouse vertical garden which supports their commitment to using local ingredients, however at times the flavour of the immature greens was a bit bitter on the palate. The exotic ingredients of almost every dish danced on the palate and always brought us to an unexpected place and left us with a smile. We greatly enjoyed every course with the exception of the ""Beet of the night"" course. The first course was bite sized tastes of the next 14 courses and was a poignant way to feature the flavours of the courses to come. The river course was an unexpected standout and the final ""Baking 101"" course was super playful and an awesome end to superb dining experience.

Richie Farina has really honed his skills in the kitchen and has been creating some really magnificent dishes, one of the areas I use to think Richie lacked was on the meat dishes, but this is no longer the case, last night I can honestly say Richie knocked it out of the park.  The newest addition beef & cauliflower is amazing and my new favorite.   In addition, moto has welcomed Claire Crenshaw to the team as the Executive Pastry Chef and she really delivers with creative, fun and tasty desserts.  My husband and truly love her Baking 101 course, if you haven't see the video how it's prepared, check it out, it's one of the coolest desserts out there. Miranda Elliot has also stepped up the wine program at moto as well, the last two times we dined at moto we couldn't find a single pairing we didn't love.  Her choice of the sake pairing for the first course sets the tone of the remainder of the evening, awesome! We also had the privilege to have Matthew Gundlach, GM assist with serving us the last 2 times being there.  Matt has a wonderful sense of humor and really knows how to deliver polish service without being stuffy.  He pays attention to detail and does little things to deliver on top notch service.  Last night I dropped my baby radish off my tasting menu sampler (the menu is delivered in the form of single bites representing each course for the evening) and replaced it on my plate but didn't eat it.  Matt inquired why I left the radish and I explained what happened.  About 3 minutes later a baby plate was delivered with the baby radish on it so I could have that single bite.  Those little touches make such a huge difference. I highly recommend you give moto a try if you haven't been here before or if it's been a while, it's worth another trip back.  The staff has worked really hard to make this a top notch restaurant and it shows.  moto has become one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.",0.998,0.802,0.182,0.016,0.46888672438672435

2012-12-12,5.0,"I ate at Moto over the weekend, and it was nothing short of spectacular!  The service was perfect.  All of our servers were knowledgable, friendly, and informative.  The wine pairings were nothing short of spot on, they complemented the dishes without overpowering them, in some cases, even made the dishes pop more than they already did.  The food, which I will describe course by course, was needless to say above and beyond anything your expecting. First course was a tasting of the tasting menu, fourteen little bites each highlighting featured ingredients and flavor profiles in all of the dishes to come.  I like to think of it as a little foreshadowing of your entire meal to come! Second was one of my favorite courses of the evening, blanc de blancs, poached mahi mahi, Nantucket bay scallop, and uku (Hawaiian snapper) servered with a sumchoke purée, heart of palm salad, and an all white theme to the whole dish. Third was the breakfast radish course,  probably the course that surprised me most was the incredible depth of flavor it had.  3 different kinds of radishes, some raw, some pickled, butter powder, liquid nitrogen noodles, red ribbon sorrel, and more. Fourth was the river course, an amazing three part course, in the center of the table was a glass container filled with rocks, smoke, and smoked sturgeon, salmon, and trout. To go along with that you had Iranian caviar, an everything bagel crisp, a housemade saltine, and a macaroon. Fifth was sticks and stones, a dish highlighting fruits and vegetables, namely carrots and apples, crafted out to look like sticks and stones.  To the nose, the dish smelled like a cinnamon roll, when eating it I realized the incredible balance of the savory flavors laced into this course. Sixth was farmhouse, awesome presentation, you have a big glass jar/container filled with straw and a beautiful egg, the top of the egg shell is opened up and a savory foam is piped in covering up rabbit shank.  The wooden top to the jar had a sliced rabbit loin with crackers, squash, baby carrot, and purple Brussel sprout. Seventh was my absolute favorite course of the evening, fallen log.  There was an actual ""fallen"" log on the plate that was topped with a sweet potato purée, fresh huckleberries, and too many other components to name, all topped by foie gras, Scottish pigeon, and quail, enough said! Eighth was bacon to the fourth. This course started out with a stunning wooden aromatic centerpiece, moving into four different bacon preparations, classic, bacon jam, pork belly, and pork jowl bacon, with one of many garnishes being a chicharon.  Need I say more? Ninth was osso buco,   A veal breast is rolled up, you have a mock ""bone"" that is a parsnip purée piped into the center of the roll, and it is servered with a Yukon gold potato noodle tossed in truffle oil, and all topped with fresh shaved black truffle. Tenth, reindeer lichen was just awesome, the lichen was actually the green served on the plate, or stone, nice and crispy. Perfectly seared bison was the highlight of this plate, with enoki, miatake, and white beach mushrooms too. Eleventh will round out the savory courses, with my third and final favorite savory course, study of venison.   One of the more stunning presentations of the night, including five different preparations and parts of the venison including tartar, seared loin, and jerky, all with garnishes!   Twelfth will start the sweet end of our meal, and with a bang!  Paradise was my favorite dessert of the night, and paradise is the best was to describe it.  Incredibly bright and refreshing with an astounding contrast in flavor and textures.  This dish highlights coconut and lime with a passion fruit tweel you can crumble over the dessert yourself! Thirteen was pumpkin patch, which is exactly what this looked like.  Creative preparations highlighting baking spice, pumpkin, and a little edible dessert menu. Fourteen was coffee service, to the untrained eye, you had a creamer with steamed milk, sugar cubes, and a cup of coffee.  The creamer was a sweet foam, sugar cubes were marshmallows, and coffee was actually a coffee gel with too much to name under it, all you need to know is it was incredibly fun, playful, and tasted great. Fifteenth and final course of the evening, and what an incredible bang of a course to end with, baking 101!  The only baking lesson I want to take, you get and empty bowl with a rubber spatula, 5 ramekins filled with what looks like ""flour"" ""butter"" ""raw egg"" ""brown sugar"" and ""chocolate chips"" then a straw for your milk and an instruction sheet.  The sheet will instruct to mix all of your ingredients in the bowl with your spatula and enjoy!  Too much fun, brought me back to childhood a little bit. What else is there to say other than I believe this is a meal everyone should experience!!",0.9988,0.849,0.143,0.008,0.537613730355666
2012-12-10,5.0,"Went to Moto Tuesday night, what a great experience. We were promptly seated as soon as my spouse and I arrived. We were given water and asked would we like to try the wine pairing they had suggested, of course we did.  Off we went through an evening of creatively thought out and emotionally evoked dish's from Chef Cantu, Chef Farina and their staff. The service was impeccable, they never missed a beat. Plates were dropped at the table in unison, water glasses stayed full. Every time my spouse got up to go to the restroom she was given a new folded linen. The wine knowledge surpassed any that I can remember experiencing any where else. The food was wonderfully presented very well seasoned and invoked the imagination. My favorite three dishes was the first fish course with bay scallop, Hawaiian snapper and Ono (I believe) all seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly. Next was the one on the stick which I thought added a nice touch. I love foie gras and this one was done well. Last on my favorite list was the venison course with its fall colors and flavors. I'm not a big dessert guy but all were well thought out and seasoned well. I will definitely recommend Moto to my friends and colleagues, and I will most definitely return soon.",0.991,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5567193675889327
2012-12-08,5.0,"I returned to Moto last night to celebrate my birthday; this was now my third visit to Moto and they have showed steady improvement - I feel they have truly ascended to one of the top restaurants in Chicago. Executive Chef/Partner Richie Farina and Pastry Chef Claire Crenshaw are so motivated and talented and really are delivering at a high level. While Moto used to be known for being on the cutting edge of molecular gastronomy and wildly creative dishes, the knock was that sometimes dishes seemed gimmicky and that taste suffered at the expense of presentation. Moto has really evolved to the point where now the cuisine itself is the star - but plating is still creative, whimsical and entertaining. They have advanced to the post molecular realm where the scientific techniques they use now adds to the taste of the food rather than is merely to make the food different or interesting looking.  The biggest challenge of my wife and I partaking in tasting menus is that my wife is somewhat of a picky eater, so unless a restaurant is able to be flexible with substitutions (and not sacrifice quality when doing so) the experience can suffer. I had noted my wife's aversions in our reservation on Open Table and was extremely impressed when our captain first approached us that she spontaneously mentioned my wife's aversions - and had them memorized! Not only did they flawlessly deliver dishes that were comfortable to her, they looked just as beautiful as the regular dish and tasted amazing to boot. This expert accommodation of my wife's special requests was greatly appreciated and is something that will ensure we are regulars at Moto! Be sure to speak up when they call to confirm your reservation if you have any food aversions as they really aim to please and want to ensure you have a wonderful experience.  In addition to finding the food much improved from our first visit and moderately improved from our second visit, service also has shown remarkable improvement. Part of it likely was attributable to us being frequent patrons at nearby sister venue iNG (we did receive some perks such as a couple of bonus courses), but the front of the house staff has undergone some changes and definitely for the better. Matt is a wonderful general manager; extremely friendly and very involved in interacting with patrons (when we mentioned we liked a particular wine he even researched to see if there was anywhere nearby where it could be purchased). Service at Moto is extremely polished and attentive; very worthy of a special occasion but at the same time the staff is so relaxed and personable, there is not an iota of pretentiousness and you can even joke around with the staff.  We again requested to sit in the downstairs area which is referred to as ""the lab"" and has such a fun ambiance (as well is a more quiet, intimate space than the upstairs).  Miranda (the Sommelier) has really elevated the wine pairings at Moto; interesting small batch wines from all over the world that both tasted well on their own before the food arrived and also paired superbly with the cuisine.  Be prepared for a lengthy meal; dinner can easily be expected to last three hours and depending on whether the restaurant is full, the size of your party and the pace with which you eat it may even take closer to four hours. While some are turned off by such a lengthy meal, I loved the leisurely pace. Dining at Moto is truly a special event and with such wonderful staff, delicious food and wines, and nice ambiance we were having such a blast we did not want the evening to end. Since there are approximately fifteen courses expect portions to be on the smallish side, but none are bite sized or comically small (and some are fairly robust); despite having a hearty appetite (and arriving quite hungry) I left quite satisfied.  Our meal last night was so excellent I really do not have much criticism to offer. The meat courses have definitely improved, but still have a little ways to go before they are as good the rest of the menu. One other nice touch would be some type of take home treat like some of my other favorite restaurants provide (i.e. Tru and Sixteen hand you a pastry to take home as you leave; it is always so fun to eat it the next day and remember your wonderful meal). With Richie and Claire being so young and passionate they are almost a lock to continue improving with time. If you have not dined at Moto within the past several months it truly has transformed into a much different venue than the Moto of years past; while it retains the whimsical, wildly creative aspect of Moto past, it now in addition offers top notch cuisine and service. If you have never dined at Moto before I highly recommend coming here and if you have not been to Moto in a while it is well worth returning; so much is new and it is very much improved.

2012-12-01,5.0,"For all you naysayers out there, in the words of my wife: ""WHINERS!"" I'll skip the part where I justify my foodie existence by name dropping, and I will say that if you are seeking a Michelin 3 star experience, this isn't it.  It is, however, an incredibly creative and interesting way of preparing food.  It's just plain fun.  So, let me update some of the comments that you've read below. 1)  There is liquid nitrogen prepared ingredients and dishes, but nothing that ""burns your tongue"".   2)  People complained about skimpy pours with the wine pairing?  It's a 13 course meal!  How many ounces did you expect per pour?  3 full bottles worth for 90 dollars would be an outstanding deal.  There are also incredibly reasonable wine options on the menu.  There is literally a 35 dollar bottle.  I'd imagine it's horrible, but you are by no means stuck with only expensive wine choices.   3)  There is music.  Not sure where that nitpick came from.   4)  There is a male and female bathroom - it's not unisex (not sure where that nitpick came from, either). 5)  The area is ghetto, sure.  Honestly though, did you really walk to a 600 dollar dinner?  The cab will do a great job ensuring your survival.   6)  Not every dish is going to blow your mind, but luckily, you have 13 to try.  It's impossible for everyone to love every dish with this much variety.   7)  Decor - yes it's spartan, but think trendy European as opposed to empty warehouse.  I thought it was classy.   8)  Time Frame - This was not 4.5 hours like many reviewers said.  It took us 2.5 hours, which for a 13 course dinner is completely reasonable.  We didn't feel rushed or that there were empty moments.  Note:  We went at 5 PM, so it's possible the later dining options take longer.  If time is a concern, go early.   All in all, we had a fun filled dining experience that we won't soon forget.  From reading other reviewers, it sounded like we had some different entrees, which makes me think they are always changing out the things that work and don't work.  So, I think that there will always be something unique to try there.  Go in with the realistic expectation that you'll pay about 600 for a couple for dinner and a show in 1, and you shouldn't leave disappointed .",0.9933,0.787,0.158,0.056,0.5897009966777409

I dined by myself, but was gracefully entertained by the courses and wines that I had that evening. the decor was plush and comfortable. I was given a moment to settle in and I then was brought a ""tasting menu"" course composed of a bite of all of the next courses that I would enjoy. This was the start of a wowing experience. Each course blew me away more than the previous. Miranda, my server gave me intense detailed information about each wine, so much so that I really had to search for notes in the wine that were not included in her discriptions to discover. The food was to die for. I think that it may have been the best meal of my life. I had an exceptional time. My favorite course was the Sticks and Stones course. Very complex and sweet. It was a bit much for one course so I did not finish it, but who ever complains about a generous portions. It was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone who is in Chicago and wants to be treated to a pure symphany of food, excellent service, and world class wines.

2012-11-13,1.0,". Salman Rushdie, the grand literary tragi-comic chronicler of America's Romanesque decline, knows America, better than 98 percent of Americans. I would love to read his yelp review of Mojoko,  But he probably wouldn't be caught dead there. It's a long story what I was doing at Mojoko, but I'll represent.  But first, to all you Foodies, this is your place, for sure! In the cowardly New America, keeping up with The (Dow) Joneses is impossible. They  (The 1%)  now stay hidden behind castle walls figuring out how to spirit their money out of America before the final fall, when China cashes in her chips.  And when they do venture out into town, they're refined enough not to play with their food. And certainly, not to pay others to do so. So now, the consumer class competes over who can afford to dine at the next ""in"" four ring circus Disney-restaurant.     That's MoJoko, prefabbed for the preprogramed ""Foodie"" as another avenue to exploit them. It's been in the making for a while. Weaning children into total hyper-speed consumerism by replacing cartoons like Bugs Bunny, Fat Albert, and Bullwinkle with cartoons of commercial toy characters, like Transformers and My Little Pony (created to sale more crap) then Beverly Hills 20666, Sex in The City, Seinfield, etc., creating generations of narcissistic consumer zombies. In Night of The Living Dead, George Romero's zombies flocked to a suburban shopping mall.  These zombies are women in plastic faces frozen with chemicals and tiny back dresses ( with French labels)  mass produced in China for 38 cents per., and men in square toed shoes, shinny suits and enough hair jell for five women. if I knew how to text,  everyone was texting at Mjoko, probably letting their social media followers know that they had ""arrived"" ,  I would've texted a covert message with a picture from the movie The Matrix,  of the those bodies hooked up to hundreds of wires, so the machines could harvest their body heat and chemicals. Foodies are in the same predicament, they just don't know it.  Foodies are preprogramed, so corporations can preform simple marketing wizardry, for instance, taking a historical American food staple like bacon, rebranding it into plastic red, white, and blue hype, and Voilà! A fortune is pumped out of the consumer foodie masses, while they run around like crazed monkeys drinking bacon soda cola and blowing bubbles with bacon flavored chewing gum. Then there are the ubiquitous Facebook pictures of ""food porn"" at term more vile than ""Foodie"", which  I'm sure an industry of cameras has popped up to ""support"" this venture.  The servers at Mojoko are diligent and conscientious, yet fear lurks in their eyes. They have to be smart to handle the chemicals pumped into the food and to use the various gases. Maybe they're down and out English Lit. Phd's who are just as horrified (  more so than I was) because due to our ravaged and beaten down economy, they have to work there.  They looked like they were being held hostage by that creepy six-year-old ""Anthony Fremont"" kid from that Twilight Zone episode who holds the whole town hostage while a creating a helter skelter alchemy of cartoonish deadly terrors with his mind, similar to the nuclear explosion of food wrongness that I witnessed at Mojoko.  Dim sum frozen by nitro? Oh and every thing has nitro in it. I think I heard Donald Duck out back huffing.  It could have been a Saturday Night Live sketch called ""Nitro it""  Seriously a smoking leather glove delivered to your table. What kinda kinkster designed that? Frank Booth, the gas sipping psycho from Blue Velvet? And the  accompanying chocolate glove looked like it belong to O.J. Simpson. And the other chef most be Dr. Arden from American Horror Story, because who else would serve orange goop out of a syringe? Well maybe Doctor Frankenstein himself Oh the horrors;  infused pasta with  fried chicken via chemicals, they got it. Any why would you destroy good wine in glasses infused by smokey chemicals from lasers?  What is this Israel?  America signed the Anti Chemical weapons convention treaty. We needed to escape because after a while the gasses produce  a paranoid toxicity. We thought the doors had disappeared. The people were all strangely silent, MoJoko  is not a conversation starter, so we thought they were aliens, about to attack us.

If the ratings were based solely on presentation, I would bump this up another star.  However, I feel that the team had sacrificed flavor for the sake of presentation.  For me, food is ultimately about the flavor, and without that, it really doesn't matter how pretty the plate looks.  There were also some funky things going on - e.g., the smoked leather gloves.  I know this was suppose to enhance the aroma, but the smoked leather made me want to vomit (this is just an honest opinion, I'm not saying that to be rude).

Our server was impeccable, he knew absolutely everything he should know and then more. He was very charming as well, and he didn't reek of pretension like many servers at high end places do.  They were very accommodating for my weird food preferences... for example I said I didn't want to eat any baby animals (in addition to foie gras, veal, marrow, or 'anything weird). Our server managed to not look at me like I am completely insane. If that is what was going through his head (it probably was) he concealed it well.

The restaurant itself had a really nice ambience, the music was the perfect volume the waitstaff were dressed very nice an the decor was gorgeous. We had a 15 course tasting menu. It started off with the actual menu in miniature bite sizes to prep our taste buds. I went through that one in at least 5 seconds. With that first menu item I was definitely looking forward to everything else. Afterwards, course by course comes out promptly. The service was impeccable and was orchestrated seamlessly. The pairings worked so well with the courses. A course that stood out to me the most was called River course. About five servers came out with each element. Two round crystal bowls were set at each side of a long rectangular glass dish. The dish has rocks at the bottom and was foggy on the inside. Each of is had a small shell type dish set in front of us with a puffed everything onion bagel chip and a macaroon (my favorite!!). As the server explained the course he pulled off the plastic and this wonderful smoke swirled out of the bowl. This aroma hit our noses and our stomachs. Inside, on the rocks themselves were thinly sliced pieces of sturgeon and salmon. The crystal bowls set on the sides had caviar. All the flavors melded so well, an absolutely wonderful adaptation of lox and bagel. Another favorite course of mine was baking 101. It was very homey and made me think of childhood with milk and cookie dough. A little handwritten instruction card came along with it and it was so much fun. We were set with a spoon and port and although I felt like it was unnecessary, I didn't notice a thing. We had a spatula and some milk and that was the perfect end to the meal. Although I finished the port and it kind of put me over the edge, I was so happy with that entire experience, I was perfectly content.

2012-10-11,1.0,"It is never a good sign that when a group of diners leave a restaurant, the entire room turns and looks enviously on those who are allowed to escape. Dinner felt like prison. The meal took far too long and was badly paced. Told staff at the outset that we needed to leave by a certain time. They assured us that we should be done far before that time. We were not.  Initially seated in the dead silent, dimly lit main room, in the space of 3 minutes about 8 people bump into my chair, 6 of them staff. Not a single ""excuse me"" was offered. We asked to be moved and wind up downstairs in a room filled with overly loud, drunk groups. But this was the preferable space that evening. At least these people seemed to be having fun.  It was not to last as it soon became apparent that courses that would take at most 3 minutes to devour had waiting times of 20 minutes in-between. Rising tension could be felt. After a while, diners started to get up and talk to other tables in a loud commiseration dance.  The food itself was presented in arty ways but it would be wrong to say that it was molecular gastronomy. There was french mousse-ing technique in crab mousse and pumpkin mousse and a japanese influence could be found in the raw sliced fish placed on rocks in a box. There was some pepper flavoured jelly and bits of foam here and there, but that was the extent of the molecular on this menu. Cutting edge this place is not. Cooked fish came out quite fishy and it felt like they didn't use quality ingredients.  The entire place seemed to be staffed with interns. All seemed extremely green and extremely uncomfortable. No sommelier was present and no one knew anything about wine. They memorised dish descriptions well enough as each course came out, but couldn't answer any questions. Cutlery was old and contained water stains. One set even came out sticky. Water glasses were refilled but empty wine glasses just sat there.  Wine pourings were stingy.   The single unisex restroom was insufficient for all diners and wasn't properly maintained.   The kitchen seemed very concerned about dietary restrictions and no fewer than 3 different staff members asked about them, but dishes still came out over salted. And in general, most of the food just didn't taste good. Saw some people get a tour of the kitchen but we weren't allowed in.  With 15 minutes and 3 more courses to go, we remind staff that we are about to turn into a pumpkin and have to go. They seemed to have forgotten and the last courses are simultaneously plopped down along with the bill before all staff disappear. No coffee or tea offered. Don't know if it was even available and couldn't find anyone to ask.  Overall, dinner service was a great mess. 20% gratuity included in the bill might explain the lack of effort, but doesn't excuse it.  We left without any member of staff saying good evening or thank you, just a stoney security guard asking if we needed a cab- too little too late.   Before writing this review I was wavering between a 2 and a 3, but after writing aIl this, I can't give higher than 1 star.",-0.9807,0.848,0.049,0.103,0.4372100122100124

Food: Food was wildly creative, the flavors chosen carefully, and seasoning spot on.  Each dish had an overarching concept or theme and, although all were very enjoyable, three stood out to me.  First was a cold course featuring vegetables in the nightshade family.  The textures, colors, and flavors worked perfectly and the pairing of a Sicilian Vermentino was the best of the night.  Second, the ""Crab Cone:"" Butter-poached king crab in a waffle cone cornet with complementary garnishes and a nice gewürztraminer that struck a nice balance of sweetness and acid.  Third, a pumpernickel and duck dish made to look like spent coffee grounds sitting in a filter.  At first you're uneasy about eating something so unappetizing but the flavors were rich and the textures very fun.

2012-08-18,4.0,"To enjoy this meal, you must love liquid nitrogen.  Or at least like it a little.  Two dishes were cooked in it and many others used it as an effect.  If you are over the liquid nitrogen craze, then you might be a bit annoyed.  Me, I can't get enough of it. Even though both dishes burned my tongue.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for smoke. I loved that the menu was little bites of what was to come.  The representations of each dish were either minor ingredients (e.g. ranch cauliflower in a dish that had much more than that), a representation of the dish (e.g. miso tofu for an Asian-inspired sampling that had absolutely no tofu in it), or a item that would be used for decoration but not eating (e.g. seaweed to represent the oyster course that was served on a large bed of seaweed).  This menu stuck out in my brain while we were eating more than any printed tasting menu ever did.  Ingenious! Onto the food.  Some dishes were excellent.  The Tostada with make your own guacamole served with two different kinds of chocolate (one blended with the guac, another served inside the chip) was delectable and totally surprising.  I loved that they combined smells with the food, for example the Smell the Glove dessert where you wear a smoked glove to eat a chocolate dish.  But there were a few dishes that were definitely form over function.  For example, I loved the design of the Zen Garden that others have raved about.  Almond sand with camembert cheese and apricot rocks presented with a cute little rake.  But holy crap was that dish salty and nasty. Also, before coming here, make sure you tell them about every allergy, aversion, not just types of food or drink you can't have.  They use unique ingredients so something that you think would never been in a tasting menu, just might be.  (Or might be burned in front of you.  For example, pine tree branches and needles.  If you are allergic to pine, that could really ruin your evening.)   Some of the dishes were alcohol.  Didn't just incorporate alcohol, but were an actual cocktail.  And speaking of alcohol, they really push the wine pairing. When I refused, they asked if they could still bring me a tiny bit of each because the wine is so much the part of the meal.  There was one dish, the Red Wine Salad, where they insisted that I have some just to smell.  (My husband said that wine in particular was tannic and horrible.  I got zero nose off of it.  So we really didn't get the point.) Restrooms.  Two single stalls.  One for men, one for women.  It worked out ok.  But I weep for the man who got sat right in front of the door to the restrooms.  Super awkward for us all as he was blocking half the door!  And he wasn't a big guy, he really had no choice based on the placement of the table.  They really need to just get rid of that table.  Object if they try to seat you in front of a nondescript door in the back. Definitely check it out.  The service was great and it was a great time.  The food presentations were amazing.  But I don't think it ranks up with wd-50, because the food quality doesn't always match the presentation quality at Moto.",0.9833,0.808,0.114,0.078,0.5497005091344713

The service is excellent and I am captivated by the self-inflating balloon that they presented my fiancee with for her birthday, which is still inflated to this day (how do they do that!?). I'm withholding a star because I don't like the way that the dining room is structured, or rather the way it is not structured.  It is just one big room with tables and chairs; there is no privacy.  Part of the whole fun of dining here is the anticipation of what's going to come out next.  Unfortunately, if you are seated as we were between two parties who have been there longer than you, you get a sneak preview of everything that is yet to come.  Major spoiler alert.  I don't know why they don't have partitions set up to address this issue.     I'm glad to have experienced ""molecular gastronomy"" for the first time, but it will probably be a long time before I drop this much coin on a meal again.  It is, after all, still just food at the end of the day.  Right?",0.9605,0.832,0.111,0.057,0.5270021645021646

2012-07-21,5.0,"Food science. I never really understood it until I ate at Moto. They will give you food they call ""food"". Appearances are not what they appear to be and they will cook things unconventionally. It is not uncommon to see a blow torch, oxygen tank, fish bowl, and steamer at your table. You will be surprised. You will be amazed. I spent many a moment oohing and aweing. That's not even a word but it's perfectly appropriate because dining at Moto was awesome. Take it for what it is. Moto is not a place where you will get a 12 ounce steak or whole lobster. You will get bits and pieces of the cow and sea but nothing more. Moto is all show and tricks. I was fine with that and I was pretty full at the end of the meal. Not stuffed, but satisfied. I've been eating non stop in Chicago anyway. We did the tasting menu in the lab downstairs and it was spectacular, complete with a tour of the kitchen. The experience was really something.  Top 5 highlights of our meal included: 5.  Reconstructed Corn- Savory corn ice cream popsicle complete with kernels someone placed one by one with a tweezer. You would have never known it was not a corn on the cob until you finished the whole thing. Completely edible. No cob! It's ice cream! 4. Zen Garden- Time to play with your food! The gravel was cheese and the rocks were chocolate. The garden came with a little wooden rake so you could make your own design and have an ""om"" moment. 3. Kentucky Fried Pasta- The chicken was dehydrated and crumbled into flour. They made a noodle out of it. The skin was served crispy on the side. There was a biscuit. Powdered buttermilk gravy. A specially designed fork entwined with a fresh rosemary sprig. It smelled amazing. Tasted great too. Dehydrated chicken noodle. Who does that? Forreal?! 2. Egg Drop Soup- They created a solid membrane around mango puree to make it look like an egg yolk. I learned how to do this food science trick at a friend's house and it is not easy at all. Hats off to the crew at Moto. They are skilled in what they do. 1. Acme Bomb- A Valrhona chocolate bomb complete with a marshmallow wick which they lit on fire. Once the wick melts away you pop the chocolate bomb in your mouth. Death by chocolate! It's rich and delicious if you love chocolate, especially melted hot chocolate. The center of the chocolate bomb was a liquid graham cracker. And you live.  The meal was spaced out and we were not rushed out the door. The staff was friendly and we had a great time exchanging banter with them. Moto is in a desolate industrial area. Since we were tourists without a car, Moto called us a cab. It was 5 star service all the way. They even tweaked their menu for our guests who could not eat nuts. Usually the substitutes are bland but Moto did not disappoint. We were drooling over the risotto dish they got.  Everyone wins at Moto. For a first time experience at a food science restaurant, I was blown away. I have high expectations now for Alinea and WD-50.

When I first came to the restaurant a little over a year ago I had been impressed with their innovative and creative dishes, but today's Moto has reached new heights. You can see and feel the amount of work and energy the culinary and front of house staff have put into making that evolution. Each of the 14 courses on the menu was like its own complete scene to be experienced through sight, smell, taste and texture. The components of each dish are so well thought out and the flavors melded perfectly. We opted for the wine pairing and I'm so glad we did because the pours complemented and heightened the flavors throughout the evening's meal. Ocean, Forest Foraging and the Red Wine Salad were probably my favorite courses, but it was truly difficult to choose because each was so different and good in its own right. ""Smell the Glove"" was a bit too sweet, but gets props for the Spinal Tap inspiration. One of my favorite parts about the night was that once we arrived we were able to let go and let the staff take over, guiding us expertly through the foods and wines. We are thankful to Alex and Miranda, our main server and sommelier, who were like our narrators throughout it all. Our thanks, too, go to all of the other countless servers and chefs who paid such close attention to every detail, from plating to serving to pouring and clearing.

We spontaneously went there for a Thursday night. There's no need to pick the food because they only offer one tasting menu. We decided to go with the half pairing since we both had to work the next day, and working while hungover is definitely not fun... The first ""course"", which was supposed to be a preview of the whole menu, is very interesting, about eleven or twelve small one-biters are supposed to present each of the following course. I don't want to go through all courses, here are a few that I remembered better:  Dimsum: I am Chinese, so I don't want to complain too much about this one. The ""Chinese"" style steamed bum was my least favorite of all night. It was just salty, nothing else. But I was happy because everything went ""uphill"" from there.  Salad: Don't remember which was ""deconstructed"" and which was in the original form, but I think there were beets, cauliflower, ranch sauce, celery, etc. in one form or another. And when you put all in your mouth, they worked perfectly together. Btw, BEST ranch pasta ever (and my first and only ranch pasta).  Reconstructed corn: One word. OMG. It's like a little corn orchestra in your mouth.  The seafood course: lobsters were perfectly cooked with butter cream, abalone, caviar, and seaweed (?), all very fresh and refreshing.  Red wine salad and forest are my two favorite presentations. I've never eaten stuff off a log, and I would've never thought the smell of some burning leaf actually enhances the flavor of the wine salad. Bourbon barrel and cocktails: there was four little cocktail bites. I didn't think it was that special, till I drank the accompanying ""bourbon"" right after the bites. The drink plus the bite was spot on on whatever the cocktail it was supposed to be. One of the best whiskey sour I've had in a long time.  Smell the glove: this was the only ""course"" I don't really get. I mean it does smell like camp fire, but why put a glove in the glass globe...And it's not really a course per se, I can't eat, I can't drink it. I can only smell. And even the smell isn't really that necessary because it's not like my smell was overwhelmed by previous courses. I don't need a nose cleanser... The three dessert courses that come after that were perfect. I like how they weren't overly sweet. And three! A girl can never have too many desserts! :) Ok, one small complaint. The waiter with thick glasses seemed to be very LIGHT on the alcohol. Maybe because we got the half pairing? But I didn't know half pairing also means half the pouring...Maybe he secretly knows our bosses and  just didn't think we should drink that much? Or maybe I'm used to Next's refill policy? Or maybe I really loved the Spanish red wine, and wished he could be a little bit heavy handed on that one...None of those matters, I still really enjoyed the dinner and would definitely go back when they change their menu.",0.9974,0.816,0.153,0.031,0.4654234693877552

I cannot say enough fantastic things about the wait staff at moto.  Our primary waiter was Alex and he was pretty freaking wonderful.  His knowledge of the menu and willingness to explain the little secret twists in each course to us was above and beyond most dining experiences.  Oh, yeah, and he helped crave the ice sculptures that were out front at the time with a chainsaw...no biggie, right??? When it came to the food, it was exceptional.  The Kentucky Fried Pasta was great.  The cigar sandwiches with smoking ash were adorable AND tasty.  The white gazpacho was off the charts according to my sister, who doesn't even like gazpacho but would eat that every day forever.  And the pig dish...holy crap! They called it nose to tail, I called it from the roota to the toota.  It was just about every part of the pig prepared to make each cut shine.  So freaking delicious. The one stumbling block for me was the black and white course.  While it was visually stunning and the scallop was prepared well, the puree it was served with was overly salty, and from someone who likes salt, that's saying something.   Even that minor misstep was nearly forgotten with Alex came over and blew out the candle on our table and poured it over our beef bourguignon course because OF COURSE, it wasn't just a candle...it was rosemary infused truffle oil!!!! Don't even get me started on the Michael Bolton cookie. Really, the entire meal was a treat.  It's not cheap, but well worth the price tag for the four hour dinner and show we got.  Not to mention, a tour of the lab/kitchen, and a chance to meet the chefs we had been tweeting with all night before we went home.  BRAVO MOTO!!!  Time to start saving up for another gastronomical adventure with you.",0.9826,0.821,0.131,0.048,0.581468253968254

If Moto is representative of the movement, I think ""molecular gastronomy"" is little more than the Emperor's New Clothes.  The best thing we had was a ""Cuban Cigar""--a cuban sandwich rolled in greens and presented to look like a cigar on an ashtray. It very was tasty. The presentation was cute. ""Cute"" is how I'd characterize much of the presentation at Moto. There was edible paper that tasted like stuff printed on it. There was a dish that looked like a fried egg but was actually made of yogurt.  Some of the food tasted pretty good. Some of it tasted gross, like a deconstructed freeze-dried coleslaw or the ""roadkill of fowl"" with sacharine marshmallow fluff sauce. Overall, the meal felt unbalanced--too many heavy meat courses, not enough freshness or lightness. If we didn't finish a plate, the servers interrogated us about what we didn't like.  Moto was depressing because it made me realize that food can only taste so good. The way food is presented can obviously add to the experience. But there was nothing close to revelatory about the food at Moto, and ""cute"" presentations--no matter the technical wizardry behind them--are not nearly enough to justify spending $300 for a meal for two.",0.9442,0.824,0.13,0.046,0.5221818181818181

We went on Saturday night when it was about 900 degrees below zero.  We were promptly greeted and seated near the hostess stand, right along the row of floor-to-ceiling windows.  It didn't take long to decide that simply wasn't going to work; it was so cold!  So we asked if it was possible to be moved.  They said they had no other tables in the main area but that we could move one booth back, to at least get us away from the windows.  We opted for that, but then we were right next to the door...  The hostess graciously offered to move us to the next available table as soon as she could, and for our third and final table of the night, we were seated downstairs.  Much better as far as warmth, but you definitely feel like you're dining in a basement.  Honestly, I'm not sure how they can use those tables in the front of the restaurant on cold Chicago nights like that.  They need to do something about the heat up there, or something... While we appreciated the staff accommodating us by moving us to a more comfortable table, the rest of the service was really sloppy and I found myself being embarrassed for our servers in many cases.  The service was simply clunky; it felt like a new restaurant still ironing out the kinks.  When my husband asked for wine recommendations, neither of our servers could really give him one (although our second server did a better job than the first), and they often had trouble explaining the dishes.  They'd either forget the ingredients or not really be able to tell us anything about them.  ""How does the chef recommend eating this?""  ""However you want.""  I can only imagine the chefs must cringe at these people serving their food. Speaking of the food... overall it was very good.  My favorite dishes were hands-down the gazpacho and Kentucky fried pasta.  However, there were other dishes which were total let-downs.  Crudite?  For $500?  No thanks.  I expect the dishes to be really inventive and interesting for the price paid, but a few of the dishes felt so gimmicky and had no relevance.  I had the half-pairing and that was also disappointing.  Honestly, I could've made those ""pairings"" at home myself.  The only wine that seemed to really tie nicely with any of the courses was the moscato served with dessert.  Don't waste your money (and don't ask the waitstaff for help).  One more note sort of related to the food - the timing between the courses was completely inconsistent and as the dinner went on, the space between courses got longer and longer.  Before we were even on the first dessert dish, I was ready to call it a night and go home just because it was taking so long. Apparently they offer kitchen tours at Moto, which in my opinion isn't appropriate on weekends when you have a packed restaurant.  We had two or three ""tour groups"" traipsing past our table and it just felt tacky and obnoxious, especially when Joe Tourist whipped his super-size camera out of his backpack to snap some pics.  Takes a bit away from the atmosphere when you're trying to enjoy a nice dinner.   So yeah... bit of a let-down, and for a hefty price!  Definitely has potential.  Maybe Gordon Ramsay should go whip them into shape.",0.9968,0.814,0.138,0.048,0.5041194642603093

We went for the 16 course anniversary menu.  We sat for a good 5 minutes before our server came over, and we ate our entire first course and sat for 5 more minutes before our wine pairing appeared. Speaking of the wine pairings, these were the skimpiest pours ever - literally two sips of wine.  After 12 pairings, I would have thought I would have a solid buzz. Nope. On to the food.  While we had a few things that were very good, overall it seemed like Moto is more concerned with theme-ing the plate than making sure it tasted good (i.e. an all black plate of food, the cigar dish, the whole hog). I agree with Tom Colicchio - who cares if it looks just like a cigar if it tastes terrible? And the cigar course was pretty disgusting.  Similarly, just because you can make butter into a candle, light it without telling us what it is, then come back several courses later and pour ""candle wax"" over our beef cheeks and then tell us it is butter doesn't mean you should. That was a pretty gross image (that didn't really add anything to the dish). Like I said, we did have a few things that were pretty tasty. The Kentucky fried pasta was good (although it has NOTHING on Next's ""chicken noodle"" soup), the ""egg drop soup"" dessert, the cassoulet and the acme bomb (chocolate shell, marshmallow wick, liquid graham cracker center) were hits at the table. Service was very spotty. I'm glad we got to experience Moto.

Wine pairings - they do NOT pair them with anything.  They just randomly poor red wine, white wine, champagne, or horrid sherry into your glass when you finish the one before.

2012-01-30,2.0,"Grant Achatz has nothing to worry about. On a recent visit to The Windy City, I made reservations at Homaru Cantu and Ben Roche's temple of ""culinary terrorism"", Moto. Now, normally I would rate a restaurant based on its own merits and not tabulate nor base my star rating on a comparison to its competitor. If you ask the powers that be at Moto, they would not say they are rivals to Alinea. But, with a menu and setup so similar, comparisons just cannot be avoided. The evening my friend Tod and I arrived for our 5:30 Saturday reservation, Chef Homaru and Chef Ben were not in the kitchen. Even Chris Jones and Richard Farina were absent as they were off filming episodes of TOP CHEF. The restaurant with its sleek, yet sterile minimalist dining room adorned with earth-toned walls, crisp white linens and almond-colored banquettes, had a disconcerting clinical vibe akin to that of hospital wing..in the ""Psych"" ward. Except, in this case, the wait staff, or ""stewards"" wear black from head-to-toe instead of the traditional light blue. Upon being seated, we were pleasantly surprised with two complimentary flutes of champagne..a welcome start to what would be a journey of ""twists and turns"". The goal of Moto is this..to keep you off-balance for the entire evening. There wasn't a moment when I felt at ease and comfortable in my seat. This was mostly due to the cordial, yet robotic service. These ""Stepford"" servers glide thru the room with a deliberation and regimen so stiff, that after a while, it just seems contrived and choreographed without any sincere warmth, with little human emotion at all. To their credit, there was not one misstep. For technical merit and required elements..a ""10"". But, for artistic interpretation and presentation..a ""2"". Whereas Grant Achatz is this creative genius, whose plates are spectacularly innovative, he still grounds them in classicism. The final dish is always recognizable and relatable. Chefs Homaru Cantu and Ben Roche's main objective at Moto is clearly to ""mess with your head"", often to the point of the crossing the line into the absurd. They clearly concentrate too much on purees and their avant-garde techniques fail quite a bit in overall execution. Our 16-course tribunal began with the standard ""edible menu."" On this night, it was in the incarnation of a mediocre deconstructed spring roll on rice paper and served with cilantro, minty, crispy tofu, pickled daikon and carrot and a spicy pineapple sauce. Next, was the Black and White plate divided in two with a seared diver scallop served in its shell with a tasty duo of crispy and celery root puree coupled with sautéed leeks. Its partner was an absolutely memorable olive oil poached striped bass served with the same accoutrements dyed black with squid ink. The Garbage Salad was a jumbled murky mess of pizza and romaine purees with balsamic vinegar, dehydrated romaine, Italian sausage, edible packing peanut with Italian dressing, pata negra and parmesan. The Nose-To-Tail was a clockwise tease of so-so ham, braised pork belly, crispy and spicy pig ears, tenderloin, roasted plantain puree and banana cubes. On the liquid side, Moto offers a noteworthy selection of craft beers and many affordable wines. They also have a cocktail menu as wacky as their food using top-shelf alcohol. Tod and I were impressed with Moto's carbonated grapes and almond/sherry Gazpacho with braised rabbit, more almonds and parsley. Conversely, the Bird's Nest of crispy noodles and soft-boiled quail egg fell flat, uninspired. The fried chicken flour noodles with mashed potatoes, gravy, and black truffle biscuit was no more than a cousin to the weak Garbage Plate. An interesting, yet not all flavorful offering was the infamous Trio of Cigar Tastings..three simulated cigar-looking bites..a Philly Cheesesteak, another, a Cuban sandwich, the other, a Monte Cristo..all rolled in braised collard greens and served with liquid nitrogen frozen ash made from black and white sesame seeds. Next, a venture into the woods with the Forest Foraging. Served over the length of a small tree branch were aromatic shitake and trumpet mushrooms, brusselsprout leaves and crispy mulberries. Finally, came a plate that would qualify as a dish. The Beef Bourguignon of tender braised short ribs served with, of course, more cauliflower puree, sautéed spinach, onion puff, and rosemary oil that was cleverly poured from the candle that was placed on our table earlier in the meal. We were hopeful this rollercoaster of a meal would rally with a flourish as desserts arrived. It started well. The Mango and Lemongrass Egg Drop Soup with spiced carrot puree and coconut milk foam was a wonderful palate cleanser. The Marshmallow Harvest three ways served with raisins, granny smith apple and shaved white truffle was intriguing but tasted misguided. The saving grace was the fuse-lit Acme Bomb, an explosion of marshmallow and graham cracker flavors.

2012-01-23,2.0,"I have to disagree with many of the reviews on this site for Moto. I am a world traveler and a foodie.  I have no issues with spending money on great food and service, that is until I ate at Moto this weekend.  I had 2 girlfriends flying into Chicago from LA and I wanted to pay for one of them - on top of my own dinner- as she does not have the money but I thought it would be a great experience for her.  We all arrived and got seated in the second floor area - which is below the first floor and has a totally different vibe than the first floor. I ordered the half pairing (as I don't drink a ton) with the 15 course tasting menu.  My first course came with a singed hair in it. Yes, a hair.  It was replaced with a minimal apology from the waitstaff. I asked for a round of black napkins - as we were all wearing black. The white napkins stayed on the table for 2 courses.    A few courses in, one of my girlfriends had to duck to get out of the way of a falling wine glass which broke right behind her.  Again, a slight apology.  The food was good. Nothing that I would say is worth $250+ per person. The service and the high level expectations in dining at a restaurant at this level were a let down.   I've lived in NY, Miami, LA and now Chicago so I've dined at the nations top restaurants which have always blown my mind. This one has a lot to be desired all the way around - with ambiance (again bottom floor) service and food. We laughed a lot and enjoyed ourselves but mostly as the expense of the service and food.  I gave it barely 2 stars for the creativity of the food. Skip moto, it's just not worth the hype.",0.9854,0.842,0.128,0.03,0.4088201058201057

I decided to pick the 20 courses since I'm a fan of molecular gastronomy, and technically, I'm paying for the food and a ""show"".  The restaurant was located on the West side of Chicago in the meat packing district. The restaurant was pretty hidden considering the area was very quiet and filled with delivery trucks. But once through the door of Moto, the dim lighting, the plain but modern decor, the fancy opened wine bottles, the well dressed hostess, waiters and waitresses await. The restaurant was very spacious and the dim lighting certainly made me use my senses to feel and taste the food more. Everything tasted delicious that night, but not everything has that wow factor. My favorite though was the Cuban Cigar, which was a deep fried shredded pork sandwich that was wrapped with chard and dipped with roasted red pepper sauce that looked like a cigar. Another favorite was the candle with the edible liquid wax, which the waiter poured over my chicken dish.  I think Moto is fun and exciting restaurant that's great for catching up or a date.

We had a 6:15 reservation, the place was understandably empty.  The host confirmed we were there for our anniversary.  We were then seated in the worst table in the restaurant.  I have a problem with a restaurant like this having a bad table but that is another story.  It is a little hard to explain why the table for 2 is so bad but know it is in the corner at the front of the restaurant and has a 1/2 wall so that one of us feels like they are in the middle of the restaurant staring at both their beautiful wife and the side of a wall. We ask to move to which they offered any table we wanted.  I don't understand that response but we move one table down.  What blows me away is that 15 minutes later they seat a single at that table.  So they knew they had a single coming in and that table is perfect for 1 but decided to seat us there. And they have romantic booths in the restaurant, perfect for a couple celebrating their  anniversary.  1 was still empty when we left.  There was no other mention of our anniversary the entire evening.

My husband and I had wanted to go to Moto for quite a while, but could never plan far enough ahead to book the reservation.  Finally, for my 30th birthday, my husband booked us a table as a celebration dinner. I was ecstatic to say the least! We arrived a bit early not knowing what to expect and and ordered a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to open up.  We stood at the bar watching the mixologist prepare 2 drinks for the couple just ahead of us as he was working he asked us if we'd like anything so we put in an order for (2) glasses of wine not really knowing how long we'd be waiting for our table.  About five minutes later as he was finishing up the drinks for the first couple, our seat became available and we were ushered over to our table, sans the drink we ordered. The waiter apologized for it, and asked us if we would still like the drinks we ordered - we politely declined because we were were planning on having the wine pairing with our dinner. The dinner was absolutely fabulous.  The attention to detail was wonderful and literally every single plate was a piece of art, both visually and for the palette.  Absolute perfection! We left Moto pleasantly delighted about our experience. We did not even think twice about the snafu with our drinks at the very beginning of our evening. Fast forward to the next day ... My husband is sitting in the living room and checking his voice mail. He waves his hand at me to come over and replays one message for the both of us.  It was Homaro Cantu himself apologizing for the disarray at the beginning of the night, and COMPING our ENTIRE MEAL.

2011-12-22,3.0,"No room at Alinea? No room at Schwa? What about Moto? WHAT about Moto? Like any good foodie, I researched Moto and found reviews to be fairly positive. I was very excited. When I confirmed the reservations, I specified we were coming in for the 10-course tasting menu. Because seriously, who can do the 20-course? I started out with one of their nifty cocktails. The one pictured came in a mini beaker, bespeaking of the science experiments to come. For you see, Moto was one of those ""powders and foams"" type places. It's molecular gastronomy. One memorable quote from someone who went a week or two before me proclaimed it to be better than El Bulli and Noma. Really? The former #1 restaurant and current #1 restaurant in the world? All right then, let's rock. My dining companion ordered the wine pairing to go with her meal and one of the courses was served with beer. She complained her beer wasn't in the proper glass (it was in a wine glass). Service was very interesting to me. Since there were two of us, two servers would come by and serve the dishes. If there were four, I saw four serve so no one had to wait. I did notice a rather large bug crawling around the table. I told the server who immediately said that was disgusting and brushed it onto his hand. There was no further mention of it. Hm.  I liked about half my meal, mostly the first half. Then I felt it start faltering. Although this meal was conceptually very interesting, not every dish worked. But I don't really expect all the courses to blow my mind. I thought the food was better the next night at Graham Elliot but Moto took far more risks. Although I probably would not return, this meal was a bit more memorable.  And the funny thing about the item I really enjoyed at Graham Elliot was that pistachio dessert. I would learn their pastry chef worked at Moto. So perhaps Moto is a bit of a ""c'mon"" to some people but at least people get to play and after all, it's just a science experiment.",0.9574,0.865,0.093,0.042,0.5240609880315761

2011-12-13,5.0,"Went to Moto and I'm not one to fancy any sort of seafood aside from sushi (tuna, -maybe- crab) I knew that the menu would have some items that I wouldn't be particularly fond of but I didn't want to mess with success so I kept my mouth shut and this ended up being a great decision in the long run, really. Foods I wouldn't dared to try otherwise were prepared deliciously, my only fear now is that when I try to go eat Swordfish again I might not like it. I had read that they did beer pairings and when our waiter Sam had asked me what we wanted to do for our meal I said I would like to do the beer pairing. First course came out and I was perplexed as to why to glasses appeared and a bottle of vino followed shortly there after. I told our Sam that we were actually looking forward to the beer pairing option but he misheard my request earlier and had to inform me that there was no such option (I suppose that was removed some time ago?) anyhow Sam had told me that he would instead speak with the chef and see if my request was even a possibility. First course is done, I now love swordfish and Sam is back telling me that the Chef had already composed a pairing for our 15 courses. AWESOME! The beers paired so well with each dish that I was absolutely astonished at how quickly the chef was able to whip up a list, produce the beers and facilitate my request with precision. Sam had filled me in on the GM of iNG being a beer nut too (not in those words, but yea) We had a lot of fun here, when we got in around 6pm the mood wasn't very lively which is something you might look for in a place like this but the atmosphere wasn't doing it for me initially, very stuffy. Once the drinks were poured and the meals were further in the place really opened up and people were less reserved. If I had to recommend a time to place reservations I would say depending on what kind of atmosphere you are looking for go early for a quiet reserved meal. Go later for a more laid back, relaxed setting. Our waiter Sam I would give a 10/10, and no offense to the other wait staff but I am glad we got him as our main server. Going back to the ""stuffy atmosphere"" comment I made earlier, a lot of the waiters looked like they walked out of an Express Catalog with very straight faced looks, not much personality to be seen but I cant blame them, it was almost like everyone in the room was fearful of sneaking out a Smile... though I can only really know our waiter the best as he was the only one we made any attempts to speak with during the meal. (I even got him to take a photo with one of the beers from our Improv beer pairing solution he and the chef cooked up). I feel like I cant talk our waiter up enough but Sam seemed to be having a lot of fun and said he loved trying something new because he knew all the wines and describing factors by heart (All of us had fun cooking up new descriptions for the beers being paired with our food, especially the one with the cherub on it). All in all the entire waitstaff made the night, my girlfriend described to me that they ""moved like shadows"" and was very impressed. I asked her what she meant and her explanation was one minute we would have one course, finished and within the next minute we would have a new one. It really was like clockwork, the timing could not have had been better. So back onto the food, each course was something new and I got to try a lot of things that I haven't had the chance to try. I now know how to eat an oyster and I unfortunately didn't take a liking to them... I'm giving crab another chance (the bisque, DELICIOUS). Me and scallops are back on speaking terms. Swordfish is my new best friend and I wont ever look at a wild mushroom the same way thanks to a guy named Running Squirrel. I was considering not posting all of the pictures that I am for fear of ruining any new visitors experiences but its clear now that the meal I had will be very different from the one you eat and you will still be amazed.",0.9968,0.788,0.137,0.075,0.4551241582491581

The food was good and surprisingly filling. The staff were very friendly and even asked us our opinions on the menu. Some of the dishes were I wouldn't say salty, but very strong in flavor. The menu had a very strong seaweed taste (it was a japanese style rice roll with pickled vegatables). The nose-to-tail was very good and had a little edible diagram of a pig which tasted like bacon. Desserts were our favorite, including one named Michael Bolton, which had a picture of his face painted onto a cookie. There were some minor nuances that bothered me. For one the music or muzak was somewhat annoying. Also the bathroom was stocked with Palmolive soap and not a true hand soap.

The plates some of might have been interesting lost their appeal once they were tasted .Each dish excluding the desserts were way over salted. The lack of depth to the flavor profile along with the over seasoning made several of the dishes taste almost the same. An attempt at being clever was an insulting and disgusting plate to put in front of a diner. The plate an ashtray consisting of half used cigars with ashes is the least appetizing plate I have ever seen. Against better judgement I tasted the plate to only want to spit it back out, the taste was another over salted one note and textural nightmare.

2011-09-28,3.0,"Actually 3.5 stars The Intro:  Homaru Cantu, the mad scientist chef serves up molecular gastronomic cuisine in this hip Chicago restaurant. The Food:  While my wife and I were not blown away by the savory courses we were impressed with the dessert courses. Having dined at Alinea the night before we thought Moto's control of the seasoning and flavors were not controlled as well. Some dishes were over salted or worse, under seasoned. Some highlights of the night were: Black And White: A fish dish with halibut and scallop served with potato and leek. Fish and scallop both cooked perfectly and matches well with the potato puree. Cuban Cigars: Great and fun presentation. Tasty and innovative, I'll leave it at that and you can find out for yourself. All of the desserts were also great and I thought all of them were highlights but they had a surprise elements to them so I'm not going to spoil anything. The ending of the meal definitely outshines the beginning.  The Decor:   Dark and cold. The whole restaurant had a gray tone to it. Maybe it was pretty empty when we ate that made it feel cold.   The Service:   Service was good, but not as inviting as Alinea. Maybe because we dined there late we felt a little rushed.  The Summary:   For molecular gastronomy Chef Cantu finds innovative ways to serve his food. He does make it fun and interesting but at times the control and flavors are not there. Overall I think the food needs more work and improvement. They are not quite there yet but definitely heading in the right direction.

I read up a lot since I've never been to a restaurant like moto before, but I still wasn't sure exactly what to expect. First, the way people on yelp describe it makes it sound really stuffy and industrial. The atmosphere is, yes, quiet and more ""classy"" -- but the waitstaff is incredibly nice. I was grinning pretty much the entire evening since I was so excited, and the staff was incredibly nice to us and were joking around. Also, remember when you come here that the person planning the menu has a sense of humor and wants you to enjoy your meal. They aren't looking to confine you to a chair for two hours and force feed you delicious food with a frown on their face. So, the rumors as far as that goes, are not true. Anyway, I loved literally everything I ate here. The standout dishes, by far, were the pork belly/foie gras combo and the cuban cigar sandwiches. Everything we ate was well thought out and the flavor profile was amazing. I don't want to spoil any surprises (though the menu seems to change often), so I won't go into further detail.

My favorite course was ""cigars"", it was so cleverly done, meats and cheeses wrapped with grape leaves made to look like half smoked cigars, the cigar was dipped in some sort of red sauce to give off the appearance of a burning cigar... There are 3 cigars served in an actual ash tray, the server comes out with a mixture of seasoning that is mixed in dry ice and put in the ash tray to resemble smoke an ashes... My description is hardly doing this course justice... service is great and friendly... It is a little pricey...

Some highlights?  The cuban cigar -- what a very cool presentation (with butt tray included!).  The sausage wrapped in grape leaves wasn't a full 5-stars in taste, but the creativity made this a whimsical dish that was fun to enjoy!!! The ""bomb"" for dessert -- I love fire. I love dessert. Put fire and dessert together and I am a very happy girl. Then add marshmallows. And I am in heaven.  (I am actually mildly allergic to chocolate but I ended up eating half of this dessert, just because it was so much fun!!!!)

First, the restaurant design is ridiculously spartan like, no real amenities like a nice modern table, no real reception area, no bar area, but cheap looking school desks to eat from.  NOGO, I mean MOTO, is located in a warehouse district which shocked the crap out of myself and my wife as we were riding in the taxicab to the restaurant, we thought we were driving to the mob district being uninformed out of towners that we were. I guess the NOGO owners thought it would be cool, but, frankly, I expected a much nicer, safer scenery for dropping 4 Benjamins at dinner. We thought we might get mugged later leaving the restaurant. The waiters were nice enough, but no one smiles there when rendering service as I suppose they are instructed to be serious. The food, or so called molecular gastronomy, wow, I am simply amazed at how many people actually rave about this mishmash of so called creations of gastronomic beauty? Not to be conceited,but we have traveled and eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world, in Asia, in Europe, in the US, i.e.,Michelin starred restaurants, Joel Rubuchon, Guy Savoy, etc., and this place and the so-called experimental petri dish food they served was not it, not even close.   The edible menu tasted like inedible tasteless paper, the tuna amuse bouche was warm, the test tube liquid entree tasted like brown oozing %&*#.  We had the 10 course menu, thank god instead of the 20 course menu as by the 6th dish,we were praying for this so-called 'foodie' experience to come to an end. My wife actually refused the last 3 entrees on the menu as she simply could not take it anymore. The food tasted more like the dishwasher not a top rated chef was in the kitchen cooking our food. In all honesty, my non-chef sister in law could have cooked and prepared a better meal using her feet to cook. It was actually pretty funny after a while, as looking around the restaurant, we noticed a few other couples eating their dinners in complete silence, with frowns or scowls on their faces, from this 'memorable' dining experience.    I have never posted on Yelp until now as frankly, if I can assist one person to save their hard earned 4 Benjamins and use that money to buy 100 Big Macs instead, I will have done a service to society. Suffice it to say, we, nevertheless, paid our bill, and made a fast exit, not looking back. My biggest regret is not being able to get a reservation at Alinea, which may have left a better taste in our mouths and re food in Chicago.   A word of advice, if you are thinking of MOTO, just remember, it's NOGO, not MOTO.  Save yourself the 4 Benjamins, Mr. Franklin would be proud of you.",0.9953,0.759,0.162,0.079,0.5353452380952382

On top of the food being an experience, and always flavorful, the service is great. Well timed, efficient, professional, but also  friendly and not stuffy or pretentious.

CHICKEN noodle soup:  chicken all processed and recreated into ramen noodles with some kind of chicken sauce, supposedly with KFC's original recipe.  Oh, we had a choice of 2 truffles which they SHAVED all over it! Paired w:  white rioja Verdict:  shaved truffles + KFC = delicious MISO soup:  foie gras with rasberry sauce and miso broth Paired w:  Cold sake Verdict:  Foie paired with sake is not something I've seen before, but it really worked. SHRIMP GRITS & caviar:  Langostino shrimp with the meat removed with cheesy grits Paired w:  Albarino Verdict:  least favorite dish of the night.  It was good, but the grits had too much of a shrimpy taste. POTATO & leak:  A ""solid"" vichyssoise with a scallop with some kind of potato gel stuff.  The waiters spooned out of sizzling saucepans super-cold leaks with LN2. Paired w:  Malvira Treuve, a Piedmont white blend Verdict:  Quite tasty and creative BASEBALL snacks:  Peanuts, edible cracker jack paper, quail, and cherry sauce Paired w:  Goose island Madame rose beer Verdict:  Extemely whimsical and creative, the beer was a great pairing CAPON & corn bread:  shredded rooster over cornbread.  After putting the dishes on our table, the waiter took our candle, blew it out, and POURED it all over our plates!  As we looked it horror, he it explained that it wasn't a wax candle, but rather a sage emulsion that had been liquifying during our entire dinner.

CUBAN cigar:  hot sausage wrapped in grape leaves with edible paper served in and ashtray with pepper ashes.  It looks exactly liked a half-smoked cigar Paired w:  Patagonia malbec Verdict:  Quite spicy!  Extraordinarily creative.  I loved it, but it was too spicy for my wife to finish it. NUAC man:  pork belly with a mushroom ""marshmallow"" that disintegrated in your mouth with your ate it. Paired w:  Catalonia pinorat Verdict:  delicious, loved the marshmallow ALLEY-yum:  a whimsical take on Funyuns.  Onions prepared in a bunch of different ways.  Oh, and there's venison. Paired w:  Argentine carmenere Verdict:  Crazy delicious. LIGHT bright:  light violet colored lavender soda in the bottom of an erlenmeyer flask with a pipette of passionfruit liquid.  Mixed together they changed colors. Verdict:  creative palate cleanser prior to the desserts. CINNAMON toast:  a bowel of what appeared to be Cinnamon Toast Crunch bits.  The server had shotglasses and dumped what appeared to be a RAW EGG over our dessert.  However, it wasn't a raw egg at all, but rather mango spheres that looked like raw eggs. Paired with:  Laurent Perrier demi-sec Verdict:  another fake-out where we thought our dish was ruined by the server.  Tons of fun and yummy. RHUBARB & yogurt:  small bit of freeze-dried strawberries, rhubarb, and Greek yogurt. Verdict:  a tiny, delicious, ""in-between dessert"" GREEN CURRY-esque:  pineapple, chocolate, marshmallow, curry Verdict:  Another unusual combination, but it worked BANANA split:  a bowl with LN2 banana ice cream in the shape of a big noodle.  Served with 3 pasteur pipettes of chocolate, caramel, and maraschino to squirt on top. Verdict:  One of our favorite desserts!  Delicious and fun. ACME bomb:  a chocolate sphere with a marshmallow wick sticking out of it.  The server lights the wick and it burns down just like a bomb.  There graham cracker on the inside so when you bite it, it tastes like your eating a hot s'more right off of the fire! Verdict:  Only one bite, but our favorite dessert.  Again, an example of outstanding creativity. COOKIE crumbs:  Earl-grey infused chocolate mousse with earl-grey ice cream and chocolate cake Paired with:  Austrian Kracher Cuvee Beerenauslese Verdict:  If you like earl grey, you'll love it. SODA du jour:  Another Erlenmeyer flask with Wasabi soda with a coconut-flavored LN2 edible packaging peanut on top. When you eat it, smoke comes out your nose and mouth!

People who complain about the price certainly have a right to their indignation, but did you not check out the prices before you made a reservation? This is not going to be a bargain. It's a very nice space--airy and almost futuristic. I agree that the evolving wait staff can be odd, but in some ways, when you're taking 4 hours to eat a meal, variety of staff isn't unwelcome.  I ate here with my dad; we had the 20 course menu. It was really really phenomenal. We agreed that 2-3 of the courses were ""good."" That was notable because everything else was OUTSTANDING. We spent the next day playing a game of which dishes we'd sacrifice to have doubles of another. Also, Chef Cantu came out of the kitchen several times to walk around and check in with diners. He was friendly and gracious, even posing with this one really loud, obnoxious guy's son for a picture. There are 2 fairly nitpicky things holding me back from giving 5 stars:  1. The wait time between courses--I get that they were trying to clear our palate and it was nice to not leave a 20 course meal feeling like I overate. But 4+ hours for a meal can get old. 2. The dishes were VERY inventive and tasty. But with several of them, like the ice cream sundae themed one (mmmmm), there was a certain element of ""What's not to like?""

There are a lot of similarities - similar lack of signage on the outside, similar dedication to modern preparation techniques and unique presentations at the expense of pretty much everything else.  But where Alinea seems kind of like watching a ballet with jetpacks, Moto is more like Cirque du Soleil on hoverboards.  Alinea is a meticulous, cultured future.  Moto is *fun*.  I mean, you still wear a suit and tie ( or a cocktail dress and heels ), but the food has a sense of humor and place I found notably lacking at Alinea. They offer two menus - ten or twenty courses.  There is also a wine ""progression"" - about a wine every two courses, not explicitly paired.  We opted for twenty courses and sharing a wine progression - plenty of wine for two relatively lightweight diners who wanted to actually remember the meal. The service is slightly formal, but not at all stuffy.  Pacing was good for a twenty course adventure; I don't recall having to wait overly long for anything in particular, though there was plenty of time to talk and admire the other diners between courses.  We left full, but not clutching our stomachs in pain - a reasonable amount of very strange food. Yes, strange food.  Nothing overly familiar.  But almost everything making a reference or a joke about its ingredients or plating.  And the flavors were just fine, thank you.  As was the wine progression. I guess the point is that if you want the very best flavors in the world, I'd suggest you go find a street food stall in some alley in Southeast Asia.  If you want the most expensive ingredients in the world coupled with the most perfect service, you'd end up at some three starred place in Paris no doubt.

2011-06-30,3.0,"SHORT VERSION: come here to be entertained by the novelty of it all--not by the quality of the food or service. LONG VERSION: In our final night in Chicago, Hubby and I decided to have one last dining hurrah and booked reservations at Moto. We had prepared (based on the reviews) to have the food take a bit of a backseat to preparation techniques but not by as much as it did. We both ordered the 20-course GTM and Hubby ordered a half wine pairing. Pacing of the meal was fine, but be prepared to sit for a long time--we were there a full 5 hours. Highlights of the meal included the caviar and lemon snow and the triple earl grey tea dessert. Hubby really enjoyed the golden twist ""ale"" soup and the banana split sundae. If you're counting that's four courses--out of 20--that we thought were good.  To be fair, the rest of the dishes weren't bad, per se, but they just didn't live up to the expectations set by the price point. We had dined at L2O two nights before and thoroughly enjoyed our experience and didn't begrudge a penny spent. That said, L2O had food that was consistently excellent, service that was flawless, accommodating and impeccable. They lived up to their 3-michelin star pedigree. However, Moto was different--and not in a good way. Food was okay with a few highlights, but service was awkward and throughout the evening, we probably had 5 different servers, only one of which was good at describing the dishes. The wine pairing was lackluster and in the end we paid $30 less than we did at L2O. So for the same price, we have a 3-michelin starred restaurant, great food and great service vs. a non-starred restaurant, okay food and awkward service. The choice is simple. I'm not trying to be overly-harsh or snarky but when you spend nearly $700 on a meal, dammit you should enjoy every bit of it. Period. Had Moto been 30% less, it would have been worth it.  The final insult was the automatic 18% gratuity added to our bill. Um, really? For a party of 2? Typically, we tip at least 20% and feel perfectly fine, but this is something that should be left to the diners' discretion. A tip is just that and is something that needs to be earned and not something a restaurant is entitled to.  Overall, the dishes were whimsical and fun, but again that alone isn't worth the money. Taste and service trumps gimmicks, anyday. I'm glad I tried it once but I wouldn't go back on my own dime. If you're going to go, I recommend doing just the 10 courses so you can see what it's all about without feeling just a little bit robbed.",0.9981,0.784,0.193,0.024,0.49085804132973937

On my second trip to Moto I was surprised to have warm white wine consistently brought to the table (we were drinking $150+ bottles and they were still warm), the waiter told us they were having a refrigeration issue and that he'd try and keep our bottles cold in a bucket of ice ... in his defense he did comp us each a glass of Bubbly, so we were all good so far and let the matter drop ... we could live with his explanation and he was at least nice about it.   HOWEVER...  Early on in the meal I told the staff that I had a very specific food allergy (pineapple) and that I needed a couple of small substitutions, they took this in stride and were very clear that they would make sure I didn't get any of the dishes with pineapple in them ... imagine my surprise when the after dinner drink (not listed on the menu) turned out to be nothing other than real pineapple juice... to his credit the waiter rounded up some Benedril, but by that point I was in no shape to stick around ...

It is very expensive, even if you just order the minimal five course meal (I think only 10 & 20 courses are now offered), but it is an experience I suggest people to try at least once. The ""salad"" was served to us as liquid in a shot glass. It tasted as though we had just eaten an entire salad after taking that one shot. The chef uses a lot of purees and unique ingredients. He also opened another more casual restaurant/bar called otom, which is moto spelled backwards.

I was very pleased with the 20+ courses spanning a time period of about 3.5 hours, give or take an hour. The first thing you will notice about Moto is the modern lucid decor - the place is very dark yet has an angelic flare. The first meal consists of an edible menu! Yeah, you actually eat the menu of the day, it's pretty damn good.  The drinks are top notch, unlike anything you have ever encountered. I had the bourbon with smoked bacon vapors covered in chocolate. I'm sure they used a high beam laser to vaporize the essence of bacon into the alcohol and then infused that with the cocktail. This was like drinking a silky well-aged bourbon with bacon and hues of chocolate. yummmy!!! Thus alone was worth the price of admission ($250 per person, including drinks, tips, etc.,).

The service was good although different servers kept bringing the various courses out to us. Just sort of weird to me. We ordered one drink each; the prices of their GLASSES of wine /champagne were very high in my opinion, approaching the $20-30 range for most of them.

I've been to Trotters and we've been to the restaurants at The Peninsula Hotel and the food was MUCH better there for less.

It takes too long to get from one course to another. 2 and a half hours for 10 courses. Majority is spent waiting not eating since you are done licking the plate 2 seconds after you get it.  4.)

The first course was a salade Nicoise ..which was basically cut green beans with soft tomato pieces and a strong anchovy flavor. It went downhill from there. Nothing had flavor, the colors of the presentation were mostly beige. The second course was mushroom in a forest..little asparagus spears in a totally tasteless paste. Course after course was flavorless. Even the powdered jalapeno with one of the courses had not kick to it.  My dinner partner and I are both in the food business. We love to eat, and were totally excited about eating here based on the other reviewers. We had the half pairing of wine for $55. We were lucky if in all we received one glass of wine total . Not the best pairings either, and they forgot the last one.  The service was ok, but somber, I do not think they ever cracked a smile. Took themselves a little serious with their ear pieces and black suits.  I do not mind spending money on dinner when it is worth it, but $450 for this, I wanted to cry .

I did the 20 course menu and wine pairings.  The GOOD: * Fun to try a lot of different (good) wines * Cool that you can eat the menu * Novelty in eating things like a cigar * Polished service/nice dining environment The BAD: * Okay, cool you can break apart a mushroom, freeze dry it, put it in a flux capacitor, and recreate something that looks like a mushroom, but why reinvent the wheel when Mother Nature already did it for you? * Wine pairings weren't really ""paired"" - they were seemingly poured independent from our food courses. (Although I must admit the wine selections were all very good and generously poured.) * Flavor was average at best. Ok, yes, you spin around a bunch of ingredients in a centrifuge and give them a dose of liquid nitrogen, and they'll taste like a pretzel, but do you really want to spend $400/person to eat a flippin' pretzel? Sure, it's a neat science experiment, but it did very little for my tastebuds. (This is the worst part of the experience, in my opinion.) Bottom line, you're not necessarily paying for the greatest tasting food; rather, you're paying for the privilege of being entertained by somebody who likes to play in a laboratory and, instead of using toxic chemicals, they're using something edible.   I had thought this place earned a Michelin star, so when I returned home after the meal I did some research,and my faith in the Michelin guide was restored because Moto does not have a star, and it doesn't deserve one.

2011-04-10,5.0,"I went for the 20 course meai. The food was brilliant--full of flavor, interesting surprises, beautiful plating, fresh ingredients. But to savor a 5 hour meal is not for everyone, so I recommend a 10 course meal option that they have--it will still be about 3 hours to get through if you take your time with it.  Moto is like a museum of food, you will not go here to order the steak that you like to order on special occasions. You will go here to be served the unexpected in celebration of the extra-special occasion: you get to enjoy extraordinary food and service that's really not available in many places. The 20 course meal started out light and built gradually to a crescendo. There was some very fanciful plating that I enjoyed and the reformed mushroom taste was really exquisite. My only problem was that the main dishes culminated in some very heavy choices. One of the heavier ones was ""cigar in an ashtray""--pork shoulder wrapped in collard greens with a roasted pepper tip and resting in an ""ash"" of white and black pepper and cumin. This dish was bursting with flavor and had some serious presence--but alas, a tad bit too heavy in a menu of 20 plates. I would have appreciated some lightening of the plates as we progressed to the end before the desserts. The desserts were really unusual--although I have to say I liked the concepts of the desert more than I enjoyed the flavors--the sundae plate felt just a little too cloyingly sweet, the earl grey ice cream plate just felt like too challenging a flavor to win most people over on, the chocolate bomb bon bon was so wonderfully dramatic, but I longed for more of a bold alcohol flavor to the inside--a rum or a cognac or something.   There are wine flight pairing options available, and they looked delicious, but I am a very light drinker, so I contented myself with a wonderful cocktail (I've really had no other like it, it had a wonderful flavor) and a glass of rose halfway through the meal and I was happy with that.  The timing of the dishes was impeccable, the service very relaxed and happy to answer any questions or repeat info. At the end of the meal I asked the waiter if I could walk down to see the kitchen and thank the chefs and staff. Its astonishing how much magic gets done in such a little space and the chefs were very friendly, humble and happy to answer questions. The restaurant location was very unassuming--I felt a bit like I was sneaking into a speakeasy, and that was fun. Inside, however, I felt   the lighting was too dim and the acoustics aren't great, so I was stuck overhearing an obnoxiously loud/tipsy customer in a corner which was  unpleasant.   Overall really an astonishing experience, not one I will soon forget.

Service- AMAZING! We had the most amazing waiter.  Spending about 5 hours there requires some good conversation and we definitely had it with our guy, I just wish I remembered his name to give a shout out! He told us that the servers are all chefs and they switch positions every month, which makes it fair and fun to work in a place like that!  Our main server had so much energy and enthusiasm, he honestly made our time at moto the best it could have been! Also, building a relationship with him through out 20 courses allowed him to comp us (well me, my boyfriend didn't want any...) about 5 glasses of wine!!!!!!!!! So nice, I honostly wanted to go out for a drink with him after..... Food-Meh.  It was all very creative and obviously the most unique presentations I have ever seen, but nothing was really THAT special or stood out to me.  We did do the 20 courses, and I braved through the phesant and pork belly, but by the end, the waiter realized I wasn't liking the special meat so he gave me more vege options they specially made for me in the back :-) Also very nice and attentive.  Other than that, nothing very special and for the $500 or so we spent, I would say definitely not worth the money.  The service again was just outstanding and that alone made our evening fabulous.  We really enjoyed our time there, despite throwing down $500 on just one meal.   Also, I'm not a big ""celebrity spotter"" but my boyfriend realized we were sitting next to kate winslet and the big black guy from the matrix, pretty cool! They were with two hot girls and an old jewish director, and the guy from the matrix kept looking over at me and winking ;) (haha not really, but he did smile and say yum that looks good when he walked in)  ALL IN ALL: I'd say try it once, and hopefully you get the same wonderful experience as we did.",0.9982,0.745,0.236,0.019,0.5388676303854877

We chose the 20 course tasting menu and were not disappointed- the service was phenomenal, and when we didn't want to do the full wine tasting they offered us several excellent wine pairing selections. I enjoyed the location and atmosphere, and thoroughly loved eating for 4-5 hours and relaxing and having marvelous conversation. For me, this is definitely a once in a lifetime kind of dining experience- and everything about the food, staff, and atmosphere was exactly what I was hoping for. The best thing about the service to me was the explanation the staff gave for every single dish- I loved getting to really ""experience"" the food as I ate!",0.9914,0.706,0.285,0.008,0.5978991596638655
2011-01-10,4.0,"My wife and I did the 20-course tasting menu. We both had  the half-wine pairing, which resulted in us not having any wine for the first few courses. It took us almost 4 hours. We have eaten at Alinea before but none of the other molecular gastronomy hot spots (Minibar, El Bulli). Evaluating Moto is difficult because it is so unlike other restaurants. Half the fun of the evening was the theater and art of seeing the unusual presentation of the food, such as the Cuban cigar that was a Cuban sandwich, the snow man, the Acme bomb, the 'coffee break' that was a soy-based soup, the sushi roll made of risotto and rabbit loin, and the edible menu. By presenting some fairly standard tastes in new ways (such as the Acme bomb, which was a chocolate shell with liquid graham cracker inside) Moto often provoked delight but the taste often seemed secondary to the unusual presentation. I am glad I went to Moto. I would go here again. But if I wanted my taste buds to be wowed I would spend a bit more on Alinea, where they do new things because they wow the taste buds, not just because they are new and unusual. As to service and decor, they were as good as I would expect at a fine dining restaurant such as this.",0.9549,0.82,0.121,0.059,0.5484848484848485
2011-01-03,5.0,"Ahhhhh Moto, Alinea's poor often ignored little brother. Between it's high profile Lincoln Park location, and it's higher profile chef that battled cancer, Alinea always gets more press than Moto when in reality these two restaurants are so similar only small differences distinguish the two. Moto, like Alinea is more about the experience than it is about eating. Chef Cantu is also a master of the food as art, but Cantu adds a little more science where Chef Achetz adds a little more art. It's very hard not to compare the two, but chances are, if you're here on yelp reading reviews about either restaurant, you're probably doing just that. I've been to both Alinea and Moto several times. Unlike Alinea, upon return visits, Moto was completely different than previous visits. At Alinea, some things stay similar but different, and some things are just the same. At Moto, other than eating the menu that you are about to be served, everything changes if you don't go back for a few months. Chef Cantu, like Chef Achetz, is a master of molecular gastronomy. Both restaurants provide an extremely unique dining experience, but Moto is far more interactive of the two. Where most of the magic at Alinea happens in the kitchen, a lot of the magic at Moto is table side or requires your participation. Getting into specific dishes at Moto seems silly to me, as they change so often that if you're reading a review more than a month old, you won't be getting the same food. However, from the menu that you consume as a first course, to desserts that melt into other desserts while you finish your main courses, Moto combines excellent food with chemistry class from high school. Sure, you're bound to have a couple of misses when you do an extensive 10-20 course meal, not everything is for everyone, especially when you are doing a science experiment. The same thing happened to me at Alinea, you're bound to get a course or two that isn't for you when you're eating 25 courses over a four hour time frame. As a person that has been to both Alinea and Moto on several different occasions, I can honestly say I'd go back to Moto before Alinea. At Moto, you never know what Chef Cantu will have you doing while eating. You might be mixing your own champagne from pipettes, or lifting glasses filled with smoke from a vanilla bean that was burned with a class four laser. Much like Alinea, Moto is dinner and a show, but the meal is the show. You have to have an open mind and an adventurous palette to dine at Moto, but in the end, you won't forget the experience you had there even if you've eaten at the older, more popular brothers spot.",0.9757,0.901,0.074,0.026,0.5181464646464644

My wife and I decided to try this during our short stay in Chicago and both of us really enjoyed it.  The decor is fantastic, the waitstaff impeccable, the food impressive both in taste and execution/design but at this price point, none of these things should be anything but. We had a 10 course progression paired with various libations as recommended by Matthew Gundlach, the sommelier. In terms of the food, I found the savory dishes best executed -- next would be the more 'amuse-bouche' style/sized dishes, and last would be the dessert class dishes.  As with a previous diner, I found the black truffle dessert to be a miss. As well, the drink pairings were well done -- one of the heartiest dishes was paired with a Belgian-style quad from Three Philosophers that is blended with a fruit lambic (cherry if I recall correctly).  I was pleased to see it wasn't a list of 10 wines. As long as they keep creating these unusual and delicious creations, this restaurant will stay unique enough to keep people interested...

2010-12-29,2.0,12/28/10---The decor of the restaurant is modern and stylish.   The service is good with fine explanation of the food preparation with each course of the 10 course tasting menu.  Wine selection was a highlight and cudos for that. All that being said---for a top notch restaurant the overall food experience was mediocre to poor.  While the food presentation was creative and fine--the pairings of flavors was challenged with virtually every dish.  This left many dishes most unfiufilling with bland and inconsistent flavors. For the very hefty price point I found the restaurant was not able to achieve the unique greatness it clearly seeks.  While it is a unique dining experience it is far over-rated.

Came here a few weeks ago on a Friday for what ended up being a four hour long dinner.  Had the 10 course and left amused, but dissatisfied. For me, Moto epitomizes the idea that ""just because you can, doesn't mean you should"".  There is very little use of restraint anywhere on the menu.  Which would be fine, if everything tasted amazing.  But for the price, there were quite a few misses. The most glaring offender was the black truffle mousse ice cream cake.  This course was actually revolting.  No one at my table wanted to take a second bite of it. The other two desserts were similarly off.  An impressive display of technique, but poor balance of flavors and textures. I'm not going to go into great detail about what I liked and didn't like.  Suffice to say, if you want to see someone play with your food, come to Moto.  If you're a purist, there are better, more ingredient focused places to try in the city.",0.9736,0.738,0.185,0.077,0.4647916666666666

2010-11-20,4.0,"Avec...Moto.. Otom .. all these unique, curious restaurant names..all related in some way or another,  I was fortunate enough to be invited by a fellow gf. Her sister, a chef, was doing a mini apprenticeship @ Moto and invited us for a special dining experience.  I love the Fulton Market area..a bit dark and creepy, but great hidden gems throughout the streets. We were seated in the tall booths & it instantly reminded me of the decor at Violet Lounge. Our bartender/server was quite the character. Very proper, nerdy, stylish, and very informative. We weren't quite picky with drinks so he made us his favorite 3 cocktails.  Don't remember the names, but the presentation was so fun! They were all in lab beakers, and quite strong. Each cocktail had some fancy emulsion of egg whites, blend of exotic fruits, etc. They all had a great kick and I got my buzz on.  We were fascinated by the edible menu w/our names printed on 'em. Every course was explained by my friend's sister, ze Chef in training..  The portions aren't huge, but that's alright..this place is known for their nerdy creations & use of scientific instruments. I enjoyed the Cigar and ashtray entree..the pork was the cigar and the ashes were a blend of seeds.  We got a special peak of private dining area in basement. What a room!! Periodic element as its wallpaper w/shelves of beakers and test tubes. Centrifuges and other fancy instruments which I can't pronounce. The chefs were busy at work, meticulous with their presentations, and still made time to explain few of the menu items to us.  It didn't cost us a fortune, thanks to our hook-up.

Not all courses were outstanding in taste (1/3 were not tasty or too salty, 1/3 were pretty good, and 1/3 were very delicious) but most were amazingly interesting in concept and presentation. You definitely have to love the idea of the crazy experiments in food design and recipes, otherwise the whole thing just seems hokey and overly expensive. The service was awesome and the waiters were super friendly and fun. They gave us a tour of the kitchen afterward, which was so cool (especially after watching their show, Future Food).  I ended up being too full at the end. 10 courses is a lot of food. Don't bother with the 20 courses, by the end of 10 you feel like you are ready for the 3 hour experience to be finished.

2010-10-22,2.0,"I dined at Moto a while back and enjoyed my meal thoroughly. Like many diners, the Cuban cigar impressed me, and the wine pairings, especially the Yealands Sauvignon Blanc with the whatever it was, were amazing. A year later, I returned and things had changed. The service was spotty -- wines were served out of order: several dishes were trickier than they were tasty: and one server apologized for radically mis-describing something, saying it had been a long day. Even if one is ready to ""enjoy"" the coy waiter-patter one is subjected to in places like this -- ""the kitchen made a mistake and forgot to make the tomatoes into a soup"" -- this kind of programmatic clumsiness, how shall I put it, chaps one's aspic. To add insult to injury, we were presented at meal's end with a DVD of the chef's TV show. I suddenly realized why I'd been so disappointed at Alinea and Craft -- no DVD! There's room for more than one molecular gastronomical restaurant in Chicago, and Moto's red-gold flash can be a long-lived complement to the blue-green iciness of Alinea's aesthetic, but not if they rush to greatness and drop their platters in the process. Step one: lose the DVD's. Step two: don't encourage me to take pictures. Step three: make sure the subterfuge is savor-worthy. At one point, my companion asked, ""Why did they make it look like cheese?"" I had no answer and neither would the kitchen, I'd wager, aside from ""Because we could."" That's not enough. I'm in favor of this restaurant and will go back, but things need to change if the place wants to live up to its ideals. And, to whomever trains the waitstaff and writes their patter: less is more. If you were less impressed with what the kitchen comes up with, there might be room for the diners to actually feel impressed. As it stands, one feels bullied into smiling.

2010-10-19,4.0,"Many, many, many months ago in the merry, merry month of May, my friend Dan asked me if I would join him to go to Moto. His wife was hesitant to go, but he wanted to try it out. I agreed.  Fast forward several months and here we have our dinner out.  He loved it. I was very much in heaven, with a few courses making me go ehhh, they were good, but not my style. Let's go to the tale of the tape.  I arrive, stand at the bar waiting for my dining companion. Perusing the wine menu, (we decided early on to do a bottle or two versus a wine pairing), I decided to have one of their seasonal cocktails. There was an explosion of fall in my mouth, with this brown butter bourbon, mixed with pumpkin and butternut squash puree, seasoned with spices, rimmed with orange and crystallized and crushed pumpkin seeds. Such a blend of salty, sweet and alcoholic loveliness. The second cocktail of run and coconut milk was a downer, (as in not that great, not as in a slam it down like a shot).  When my friend arrived we headed off to our table, our menus arrived, freshly baked on a delicate toasted bread, slightly seasoned with cheese and butter. On one side, you had their ten and on the other their twenty. Here is where you have to realize this place is about having fun with food. It borders on poking our conception of what we perceive food to be and what it can be. If you come with a fixated idea of what your mind and mouth can combine to be.... well, you may want to move along there Missy.  The first course was their take on a tuna tartar. If was a bed of lovely tuna, with a smirky foam of a snow person on top, (I like to be PC when I can be). To top it off, they killed off our snow person by drizzling some margarita love on top, combining it with the gelee underneath, think a very citric but balanced dish. The gelee was good, but gave a glossy feel to the tuna, which I just had a harder time to get over.   The next course was one of my favorites. Hawaiian Ono with a vanilla puree, crystallized grapefruit and roe. The flavors balanced again really well with the fish. The slightly sweet and tang of the grapefruit, with the silky smoothness of the vanilla blended well with the rich butteriness of the Ono.  Then on to their literal version of a crab cake. A lemon sponge cake filled with large pieces of Alaskan King crab. Covered with a not sweet, cream cheese and lemon icing, with butternut ice cream and slightly cooked shaved fennel on the side. The cake was delightful, more citric than I liked, as it seemed to over whelm and made me loose the flavor of the crab. Then came pork belly that had been braised over night, with maitaki mushrooms and Chinese broccoli. Delicious. One of my favorites, the combination of all the flavors played off of each other so well and were deep that they stood out but didn't overwhelm each other. The fun playful side? A dehydrated, reconstituted shaped in to a mushroom cap and stem carefully put together on the dish.  Then my second favorite, pieces of quail that has been covered in peanuts, deep fried in peanut oil, places on top of a Coca Cola reduction, with a dark caramel and apple sauce with a side of popcorn shavings and a Cracker Jack prize on the side, and yes, the prize was completely edible! The quail was done well, the sauces paired well and really, just a fun treat to eat.  The rabbit maki roll surrounded by risotto with a little simple garlic sauce on the side was very good, however I lost the rabbit and much of the other flavors when I ate it all together. Sad, I like a little Thumper flavor.  My favorite was the Mexican cannoli. A deep fried cannoli shell, filled with duck, covered with sour creams on the sides, lots of mole sauce over it, toasted pumpkin seeds and dehydrated corn and jalapeno on the sides. This was ingenious presentation, hearty flavors where nothing got lost and delicious in every bite.  Starting our trio of desserts, we started off with the truffle ice cream with rosemary crumble surrounding it, delicious, though not as sweet as I thought. Pineapple steeped in chai tea, with marshmallow fluff and coconut covered rice noodles were wonderful, but not my style. The final of a delicious chocolate mousse covered in crumbled shortbread, with earl gray ice cream was the perfect finisher.  All in all, a great time and meal. I would for go the wine pairings, I think you can get away with a bottle or two and have a great time and save some money. The wine list is okay, but not extensive for a pairing. The service was great, our sommelier was great and friendly and everyone made sure we had everything taken care of.

I made a reservation about three weeks in advance and they only reservation they had was a 9pm, well that meant the twenty course was out of the question because that can take up to five hours! We opted for the ten course with a wine pairing and we didn't leave the restaurant until midnight but it doesn't even feel like you're there for three hours. The restaurant is located in an industrial looking area. It can be easy to miss because the sign is small. It's very dark inside and they discourage flash photography, so I was scared to take pictures until I saw someone else doing it. They bring out the edible menu which is pretty much taste like a zesty cheese cracker, it was the best menu I ever ate! We ordered the 10 course (we ate here about a month ago, bear with me as my memory is fuzzy): -Snow man (hawaiian poke with a tequila, lime flavor) -White steel -Crab cakes  -Maitake & pork belly -Quail with cracker jack -Rabbit maki (risotto with rabbit meat rolled up to look like sushi) -Mexican cannoli (had duck inside, made to look like dessert) -Tasty cake with apple -Pineapple & chai -Earl grey -Vanilla flavored packing peanut served a beaker with bitter orange liquor Everything was delightful (and I never use that word ) but there were 2 or 3 things that made me make yummy noises with every bite a la ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""What About Bob"". The service was very good. I know nothing about wine pairings but I enjoyed every glass. I was pretty faded by the 9th one and I don't even think we got our 10th but by that point, I didn't care! Minus a star because there was no cuban cigar which is actually available on the 20 course but the menu does change. If you're into eating paper, eating stuff that looks like dessert but isn't, or trying new things and flavors, you'll like Moto. It's not traditional. Also, it's not as stuffy as I thought it'd be, there was a large group of about 12 and they were whoopin it up like it was Texas Roadhouse.  And now for the moment you've been waiting for, the grand total for 2! For each person, the 10 course is $135, plus the wine pairing (I think it's $80), and the 18% service charge = $550...but was it worth it? I'll just say it was definitely an experience.",0.954,0.811,0.107,0.082,0.5057609057609057
2010-10-16,5.0,"I open a narrow glass door among many, hoping I picked the right one. Signage is spare, and because our dinner is earlier than normal, there are no people waiting around or smoking outside. In fact, the desolate surrounding make me wonder if I've been dropped at the rear entrance. Just inside, however, a smiling man greets me and I know I've chosen correctly. I explain I am to meet the other diners downstairs in ""the basement"". He leads me through the upper dining area, and I get a fleeting sense of warmly-lit booths ensconced in browns and golds. Downstairs, I meet our fellow diners and drink in the cool environment: test tubes, lab equipment, and chemistry symbols adorning the walls. I'm in for a treat! To start, I try the cucumber & GINger cocktail. It is refreshing, though the ginger aspects are barely there. After some prompting from others, I follow up with the siesta. This is more to my liking! The coconut milk shields my taste buds from the harsher aspects of the tequila. For some reason, it tastes like a tropical version of egg nog...which isn't a bad thing. Adequately lubed, we are then presented with the menu for our 10 course meal. The menu itself it edible, a thin wafer of baked pastry upon which edible ink has been printed. The whole thing tastes like a grilled cheese sandwich! Some sections of raw tomato help freshen it up. We also ask the servers (who rotate out of the kitchen and sometimes create some of these dishes) to pair up some wine for each course. The servers are clearly having as much fun as we are, and that elevates our experience ten-fold. We start with a Ceviche Margarita, taking form as a lime foam snowman with Himalayan salt eyes, nose, and mouth sitting atop a sleigh of raw tuna. When all elements are combined, it does indeed taste like a margarita! There is no fish taste at all and the textures play off each other nicely. White Steel follows, a thick cut of mahi-mahi accompanied by bright red fish roe, all atop a hearts-of-palm puree infused with vanilla bean. The roe is salty and the texture is alien to me, but the fish is firm and flaky. Again, once all parts hit the fork with that puree, it becomes magic. I very nearly clear my plate. Our final ""fish"" course is the Crab Cake, which is really a puff pastry filled with lobster bits. Along for the ride are marinated fennel bulb and butter sorbet, all of it making for a rich and creative dish. Next up is NUAC man. No idea what it stands for, but it is a hunk of braised pork belly next to a mushroom broccoli rabe. In the middle of the rabe stands a tall, pale mushroom which has been dehyrdated then reconsistuted to create something like a mushroom ""peep"". It is light, crispy, and provides a nice constrast to the deep, earthen tones of the rest of the dish. Our next course is called Quail & Cracker Jacks, and that's about as literal as this meal got. Juicy quail breast, coated in Cracker Jack coating, arrives on a plate with dipping sauces and a cherry-flavored prize pouch. It is quick and delicious finger food. Our last main course is a Rabbit Maki, served up sushi-style with chopsticks. It is actually avocado and chunks of rabbit encircled by sticky risotto with a beet cone, garlic aoili, and a fresh pea puree made up to look like wasabi. It is a fun way to present the ingredients, and all of it works well together. I even like the rabbit! Finally, our dessert course begins with a Mexican Cannoli. But wait! It's another bait-and-switch! It's actually spicy barbeque pulled duck leg in a pastry that tastes like a tamale, covered in achiote sauce and sour cream. It is easily my favorite dish...the supreme example of your eyes telling you this is sweet, your taste buds testifying it is savory, and your brain trying to assimilate all the disparate sensory data. In a word: fun! Real dessert proceeds, including truffled ice cream and pineapple chai, but for all intents and purposes, the meal is done. I finish with a cup of hot espresso. For those foodies actively seeking a unique and experimental experience, I can't recommend Moto more. I can't imagine dining here more than once a year, but I can't imagine NOT dining here more than once a lifetime.

2010-10-15,4.0,"Last minute on April 23rd, 2010 we were wanting to celebrate our Anniversary at Alinea, well, a day prior, they were booked solid for 6 months so we were lucky enough to call Moto and they had room.  I rushed there from DeKalb, IL, 60 miles away 1 hour traffic plus more in order to beat Friday afternoon traffic to make it there at 5:30pm.  Lucky I left work early.  My date and I walk in and find we are transported to a new word like it was a filming on the Matrix movie set.  The food was neat and service was impeccable.  Deandre was a wonderful host and the tour in the basement was neat.  I had heard of the owner on Iron Chef and was excited to finally be at his restaurant without knowing about it prior.  This proves if you want something enough, you will get it, somehow it just worked out that way, whereas the chef at Alinea I've never heard of.  Anyway go there for the experience and time with your sweetheart rather than too much focus on the taste, it's meant to confuse you because you will be soon eating a cigar in an ashtray made of grape leaves and some other edible ingredients.  I found service to be wonderful and all the hosts there are actually culinary chef students/graduates so they are trained to be professional.  I walked to the rest room which a hidden side door opens up where a gentleman will open and close it for you otherwise you won't know it's there.  I came back to find, my napkin refolded very nicely, and table of crumbs gone and refreshed by the attentitive waitstaff.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would I go again, maybe in 10 years as it was $550 for both of us almost $600 since they do include tip.  For my date, I just told him, it was an investment and very modest price because it saved us a the price of an actual transport to another state for a dinner.  Plus we should be treated like royalty on our anniversary.",0.9925,0.86,0.135,0.005,0.4446969696969697

2010-10-06,2.0,"I preface my review below by saying that I had a lovely experience at Moto last year.  Food, service, custom dishware--I was into all of it and would have been happy to return. I did return--last night, and had a sub-par experience. I had the vegetarian 10 course.  Nothing stood out as exceptional and a few of the courses were distinctly overly sweet or overly salty.  However, my comment here is mostly to do with service.  A given table at Moto encounters a fleet of servers over the course of the night; all but one were quite courteous.  Unfortunately, that one made for a terrible dining experience.  Our head waiter sadly lacked all basic etiquette.  When he brought the courses, he began talking immediately over people (just 4 of us) with explanation of the course, rather than pausing just a moment for conversation to break.  During the meal, someone asked a question and his reply was, ""Well if you'll wait a minute I will tell you.""  At the end of the meal, he asked what we particularly liked and my boyfriend mentioned a drink, to which he replied, ""Well that's not a food course.""  And so on.  Then, and this still blows my mind:  he returned with the credit card slip at the end and automatically handed it to my boyfriend to sign, the ONLY MAN at the table.  (This was a business dinner, two execs hosting my boyfriend with me being the additional guest.)  He was at the far side of the booth, such that the waiter was certainly not handing the card to the closest person.  Meanwhile, the card clearly indicated a woman's name.  A lousy end to a mediocre meal. And BTW--the toilet in the women's room is obnoxious.  No one can find that button on the far right side. (It was clear I was not the only one.)",0.8026,0.83,0.101,0.07,0.6602106227106227

From the edible menu, kitsch tequila snowman to the nostalgia-inducing baseball snacks, everything about the dinner was super-creative and innovative.

2010-09-20,4.0,"Prior to our Chicago trip, my travel companion agreed to a sole elaborate dinner at Moto, the renown molecular gastronomy destination. I happened to be flipping through my HDTV channels a week before our trip and noticed that Moto had its own show on the Planet Green Network called ""Future Food"". After watching a few episodes about how the staff solved various environmental issues, such as finding ways to reuse their leftover ingredients, I could not wait to visit the conscientious place. The day soon came when we arrived at Moto. The decor was sleek and sophisticated, but stuffier than I would have expected from such a playful restaurant. Sure the tasting menus were pricey, but they were also edible! A legible meal list had been incorporated onto a large sesame cracker. Once we told the waiter which tasting we preferred, we were free to munch away on the giant crisp. We continued to be wowed by the innovative dining approach when we received our specialty cocktails served in scientific beakers. My ""Picnic"" was a crisp blend of watermelon juice, vanilla vodka, orange bitters, and ginger ale. It was the perfect summer beverage.   In terms of the menu, we opted for the smaller, 10-course parade, which began with the White Steel. This perfectly cooked cube of pan-seared fish was served in a sweet vanilla sauce and garnished with caviar and carbonated grapefruit that also resembled fish eggs. For the next course, I received a shot glass filled with a light Watermelon Soup. Strands of aromatic lemongrass added a savory side to the broth. In addition, baby scallops floated in the soup and were meant to be slurped up through a thick straw. Essentially, the drink was a play on Asian tapioca bubble tea. My friend did not like watermelon, so she was able to substitute this course for an alternative, but she missed out as this was one of my favorites within the procession. The unique blend of fruit, herb, and seafood flavors worked shockingly well together; each remained clean and distinctive, but also combined for a cohesive dish. Next, the Cuban Sandwich was a mini sub filled with pulled pork. The moist concoction was wrapped in sheets of collard greens that were designed to look like a cigar. Sesame seeds were pulverized and stuck to one end of the sandwich, resembling the ashy end of a cigar. The sandwich was stylishly plated in a silver ashtray that had also been dusted with the sesame crumbs. What made the experience even better was that the meat tasted as bold and smokey as it looked.   My next dish was also artfully concocted. The Rabbit Maki was a sushi roll of dried mushroom paper and risotto wrapped around braised rabbit. The meat and fungi made this maki more earthy than its traditional counterpart. The bite-sized morsel was served with pickled radish that resembled ginger, as well as a ball of dried, crushed peas made to look like wasabi. A creamy herb dipping sauce meshed well with the risotto, as they typically make quite a pair. Next came the Pork Belly cube, which was sadly a bit tough. It was served with a garden of broccoli rabe and mixed mushrooms. This was followed by the fabulous Jewish-Italian fusion course of Reuben Lasagna. Each layer was stuffed with brisket, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. It was definitely a trippy experience to eat something that looked like a lasagna, but tasted sour and briny. Our last savory dish was a Mexican Cannoli, which was the perfect transition into the dessert round, since it looked like the sweet treat. A tortilla was curved in half to resemble a cannoli shell. This crisp, corn roll-up was stuffed with mole-marinaded duck and sour cream. Pumpkin seeds topped the exposed cream like pistachio nuts on a cannoli. Corn dust and additional mole sauce were drizzled over the meal to make it an even heartier dish. After such a creative dinner, we wondered how we would be dazzled by our stream of desserts. First, we received a bowl of tart Strawberry and Rhubarb puree that contained a scoop of sweet almond ice cream. It was topped with homemade whipped cream and a dusting of graham crackers. The combination of textures and flavors made it a perfectly balanced dish. We then received a sloppy looking mess that tasted a million times better than it appeared. A rich chocolate mousse and a sweet vanilla cream popped when they were plated with a white cherry foam and tart cherry sorbet. A crisp funnel cake looked like it had been tossed on top as an afterthought, but it clearly added a childlike innocence to the plate. Then came a Chocolate-Covered Orange Cream Truffle topped with hazelnuts, chocolate crumb, raspberry puree, and fresh blackberry. The dish was beyond decadent. Lastly, a beaker of strawberry soda gave life to a bland marshmallow in the shape of a packing bean. Our meal at Moto was an endless procession of culinary creativity.  Neither my friend nor I had ever experienced anything like it, nor did we expect to again anytime soon.",0.9985,0.8,0.149,0.05,0.5186602418745275

Service was also impeccable, as all the waiters wear headpieces to synchronize their movements into effortless service which is anything but.

Menu:  1 SNOW man (tuna ceviche with lime foam snowman)  2 WHITE steel (scallop with roe and grapefruit done in the style of a gin & tonic)  3 MAITAKE & pork (pork belly, sautéed mushrooms, and mushroom foam) 4 QUAIL with cracker jack (quail fried in peanut oil with cherry and coke reductions w/ popcorn powder) 5 RABBIT maki (rabbit and brussel sprout wrapped up to look like a California roll) 6 REUBEN lasagna (braised beef, cabbage and swiss cheese) 7 MEXICAN cannoli (duck wrapped in mini tortilla with mole sauce) 8 FROZEN yogurt (piped frozen yogurt with cake and mango) 9 CATMINT & pineapple (mango and pineapple and catmint marshmallow) 10 TUBER melanosporum (chocolate mousse & oregano) 1 loved it, the snowman got melted with some tequila mixture 2 my favorite dish of the night 3 pork was very tasty and mushrooms were so good including the mushroom foam which was shaped into a mushroom 4 one of my least favorites; there was too much quail, I didn't like how it was fried but the popcorn powder and reductions were very good, pineapple flavored cracker jack prize was nice too 5 rabbit maki was good 6 rich dish but good; dill chip was a little overpowering 7 was alright 8 first sweet dish, very tasty, yogurt was good and fruits were very good 9 fruit was good but catmint marshmallow was not something I finished, kind of an off taste for me 10 combo of dirt-looking shaved chocolate with oregano was very interesting, would have eaten more if it wasn't the last course with my stomach stuffed Not included above: spinach-artichoke style menu which was edible (the menu was baked onto a pita chip) and a Styrofoam peanut-looking thing which was frozen and served in a flask with orange soda to finish our meal.  Overall, the highlights for me were towards the beginning of the night.  I ordered a cocktail called the picnic which had vodka, watermelon, Red Bull, etc...  I realized that I really dislike the taste of Red Bull, so that didn't work for me, but my own fault.  My husband loved that the cocktail and some of the other meal components were served in laboratory glassware (read: flasks & beakers).  It was a very interesting experience even though I didn't love everything that I ate.  Some of the things I loved, my husband didn't like as well, but the quail was one of his favorite things of the night and it was my least favorite, so it was just a matter of personal preference.  It was pricey, but we knew we were getting an experience when we went, so were happy with the result.  It's the kind of thing we'll do once and never again but are glad we got to do it.",0.998,0.787,0.178,0.035,0.5452127659574467
2010-07-31,2.0,"Well it had to happen, my first negative yelp review. Way overpriced. Got the 10 course tasting and 10 course wine pairing. For two people this dinner was a whopping $580...and when some of the food I taste is actually not good enough for myself or my date not to finish it clearly shows it's not worth the money. Of course this place is all about food presentation, and combinations that you have never had before, but the food should still taste nothing below amazing at this price. The waiter did however mention that their sister place next door, otom, offers a three course tasting menu for just $35 on Tuesdays. Skip moto and go there! This place is all hype and I can't believe the amount of good reviews on yelp, moto is probably writing them for themselves!",-0.8685,0.885,0.024,0.091,0.3816666666666667

We got the 10 course, and thank goodness we did cause the meal took 3hrs!  The serving sizes weren't super small too so we were full by the 6th course, which we barely took a bite of!  The service was impeccable and ambience very modern. They had two waiters waiting on you at a time and they changed the utensils for every course!  The food was very interesting but not too weird!  My favorites were the pork belly, quail, and uno. The popcorn dust with the caramel paper was super cool, as with the edible menu!  I'm usually a dessert kind of gal but the ones here weren't amazing.   Overall a great experience though, but pricy!  The most expensive meal of my life yet!  After tip it came out to be around $170pp w/o drinks.  But I'm liking this whole multiple courses thing and can't wait to try Alinea and compare!",0.9656,0.795,0.163,0.042,0.5290909090909092

Moto just maybe the only reason I decided to visit Chicago (well, visiting Wrigley may have too --but I'm a Foodie @Heart!), so what better way to experience it then on my 2yr Anniversary. If price is an issue, this is mos def worth saving up for; a mean and unforgettable experience.  We chose the smaller menu, as many of the things I wanted to try most were on here and my gf, being so impatient, wouldn't have been able to sit through all that. By far, my favorite thing was the cuban cigar. At first I figured it wasnt going to taste as good as crazy it looked, but, it tasted awesome. It was soft and flavorful and made my mouth salivate tears of joy. Other recommendations: The small little blueberry type desert (dang I cant remember the name). By far, THE BEST DESERT I EVER HAD. So good, we convinced the waiter to sneak us another *wink*.  Staff is super cool, the food is deliciously insane, wine was even good too (we got a bottle of a wine from here in northern california and STILL cant find it anywhere) Next time I'm out there, definitely going again!",0.9942,0.724,0.236,0.04,0.6189516129032258
2010-07-20,2.0,"I would not recommend anyone to Moto, even though there were bright spots to the evening.   After two nights of tasting menus, I guess a third night was over doing it a bit and we did it up with the Grand Tasting Menu, 20 courses.  The portions are NOT small here, we were stuffed silly halfway through and we barely nibbled on the edible menu, which I thought was AWESOME by the way.  Brought a humongo smile on my face.  So clever!!! My irritation with the service began when the reservationist called to confirm the dinner. Usually, it's pretty smooth, but she demanded to know if I wanted to order the 10 or 20 course menu.  Okay, sure, but I need to know what the hell differentiates the two.  Is is more luxurious?  What are some of the courses?  Normally they would oblige.  Not with this chick.  It was like pulling teeth.  Finally, still nothing after about two minutes of rallying on the phone.  I thought F this, it's our last night in the city, let's blow it out. TWENTY it is.   Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted kindly and enviously spied the cush booth seats, but ended up with a table in the center aisle.  I personally thought it was better than the cramped bench seating along the walls.  Still, not the best seating, the floor boards are thin, so everytime a server would walk by, we'd feel all the vibrations. Overall the servers were not the most engaging and barely explained what was being poured or served.  I was aghast.   The food was a little overworked & tried hard to be hip.  Do it, but do it well, follow along with the pictorial: The Hits: -Bubble Tea, loved the lemongrass scented broth & the scallops. -Pheasant two ways, white was like a really delicious moist cold cut, dark was like an odd jerky, both enticing. -Yellow Snow, I think this was my fav for the evening, loved the mild curry. -Nuac Man, awesome cube of pork belly, loved the crispness of the lily & the deconstruction of the gai lan into two parts. -Cuban cigar, great presentation & the pork inside was fragrant. -Banana Split, AWESOME.  The best dessert. -Pine Float, surprising and interesting.  The pine liquid inside the beaker were subtle and quite good. Middle of the Road: -Clam Bake, a little heavy handed & rich. -Baseball Snacks, breading was too thick on the quail, liked the edible prize. -Forest Roll, didn't like the rice  -Reuben Lasagna, okay, meat, good. -Shabuccino, WAY too salty, liked the edamame. -Duck & Mole, Duck was the best part. -Cheese Plate, I liked the berry crepe the best & the berries in the middle. -Lychee, okay, maybe too gelatinous. -Chocolate truffles, too much in quantity and should been contrasted w/another texture. The misses: -Snowman ceviche, too sweet. -White Steel, supposedly caught the day before, overcooked & not seasoned well.   -Forest Roll, did not enjoy the rice and the rabbit was bland. -Green Curry Lime, very hard to eat, flavors were fighting with each other. -Acme bombs, let's just say if this were not completely liquid in the center, we both would have spit it out. Wine pairing for the GTM is $95/pp which is a great deal, about 15 different types of wine, too bad most were lackluster.  Pours are generous and we split the pairing. There is a lot of work put into the food, but taste wise it just doesn't cut it for me.  That, along with the service, doesn't warrant the hefty price tag, when there are other comparable restaurants in the area who give you exactly what you pay for.  OK, maybe there's that HIP factor here, but still, not really.",0.9984,0.711,0.205,0.085,0.5242039295392953

During the conversations with the waiters, it came out that I worked at a science museum.  The waiter said, ""Oh, i bet you'd love to see the lab where we do some of our cooking!""  Heck ya!  So, we go downstairs and we start getting a private tour of the space they cook in during the Future Food show.  So many cool toys.  We head over the centrifuge and I look inside... and there's a ring.  Yup, the boy proposed right there.   How could I not love Moto after that?   The staff is super nice and accommodating.  The food is an adventure.  It's expensive, but it'll be a memorable night (maybe not as memorable as mine, but I think it'll still hold a special place in your heart).

2010-06-18,4.0,"I knew walking into moto that I was there for an experience.  I definitely got one - but what I hadn't realized is that it last 5 1/2 hours.  Seriously!  We walked in for the 20 course meal at 7 PM and didn't get back into a cab to head home until 12:30 AM.  Make sure you carve out a few hours for a meal here, and don't start the 20-course menu at 9:30, like the woman at the table next to us - I can only imagine when she made it home... I appreciated what the chefs did with the menu; my boyfriend turned me on to the show ""Future Food"", which is what inspired the trip in the first place.  It was also the most expensive meal I can remember paying for, with one possible exception - so I walked in expecting to be ""wow""ed. All in all, I felt like I got sent on a bunch of unexpected twists and turns, and couldn't foresee what each of the dishes would be about.  I don't really want to describe the dishes, for fear of ruining the surprise for people who are planning on visiting - but if you see the Bubble Tea, Clam Bake, Cuban Cigar, and Rainbow Sprinkles, those were probably the top of my list.  We also splurged and went for the wine pairing, which was incredibly interesting, and considering the price of the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu, absolutely worth it.  My favorite - more because it was so far outside of any reference - was actually a beer that was superbly smoky.  We also got to try a wonderful range of whites and reds and sparklings and... oh boy was I bubbly by the end of the night :) What made me sad about the meal - and what makes it impossible to give Moto a 5 - is that I started feeling full about halfway through the 20 courses.  After about 10 courses, I had to pace myself to the end - and some of the courses I couldn't finish. I'll still keep on watching the moto chefs on Planet Green, but I think this was probably a one-time-only visit.  I just wish they'd been more conservative with the portion sizes; it would have made this a truly outstanding experience.",0.9935,0.814,0.149,0.036,0.5633986928104576

The less flashy dishes tended to be more flavorful, while the visually pleasing tended to miss the mark a bit. I also got annoyed that three of our courses were pork based- I enjoy pork, but I want something other than what's trendy right now, especially a meat that is not that hard to prepare. The best dishes were the desserts, which really impressed me, including the pairings, which were perfect.  We also had a really awkward waiter who was difficult to understand and hear, which puts a damper on the presentation of it all. The other waitstaff was amazing and fun, I wish we would have had more of their service.  All together I had fun, but afterward I was wondering if I had the wrong expectations.

The biggest fail of the night was that our waiter forgot to bring us one of our courses.  Only after my wife convinced them that they indeed had forgotten the course did they bring it out.  This wouldn't have been even as bad if they had not but an automatic 18% gratuity on our bill.  I'm sorry, I tip well at restaurants that give me a great experience.  If you forget a course and I'm paying $350 for a meal, you better not expect a full tip if you fuck it up.  I thought this was tacky and actually had to go through the manager to bring the tip down just out of principal.

However, on my last visit we had a lovely dinner, I went home and went to bed - and was awakened just before 5 am VIOLENTLY ILL. I ended up spending the entire day in the hospital with a serious case of food poisoning. The doctor suggested it was most likely fish/shellfish (I didn't have shellfish, so I am guessing it was fish). I did have one fish course that wasn't on the menu (I was the only one that ate it) as a substitute for another course - and I am guessing that was the issue. I am really sad that this happened, and I will not be going back. Spending quite a bit of money on dinner, and then throwing in hospital bills - not fun. I would not recommend taking the chance!!

Each course was more fanciful than the next.  The menu revolves around surprise - each dish comes out looking uniquely like one thing, but tastes like a completely different one.  The highlights for me: a reuben that looked exactly like lasagna, a cannoli that was actually a Mexican entree, and (my favorite) the cuban beef ""cigar.""   It was a fun, fancy dinner that was full of unexpected ""wow"" moments.  However, I don't think it would be worth the money to do it again, unless the menu completely changed.  We paid for the experience, not the food.  It was completely worth it, and I adored it, but I think one time is enough per menu.",0.9821,0.829,0.155,0.016,0.4272727272727273

2010-03-19,5.0,"Moto is an experience for people who like to be surprised.  The aspect of adventure adds something that is very rare in dining.  Some dishes may be misses to a particular person's tastes but that is what happens when creativity takes risks.  When they are hits (as nearly all were for us)...they are really cool. I chose to spend the time and money since I have a culinary background and really appreciate chefs that are passionate about food and want to create a memorable experience.  As you can tell from the photos on the website and here on Yelp, you not only will spend part of your meal taking pictures and discussing dishes, but you will find yourself weeks later explaining the interesting  presentations and flavors.  The food does just look fancy, the tastes are also fulfilling. Another very important aspect to our dining experience was the service.  My girlfriend and I have been there twice now (once for a ten course and then again for a twenty-course with wine pairings) so we have had PLENTY of time to judge our accommodations.  Speaking as a former cook, I will say without a doubt that the kitchen staff has incredible passion for producing incredible food.  My only complaint is that a few members of the staff did not give these dishes justice in their explanations.  However, the majority of servers did a great job.  Also, the ""mixologist"" is a very personable guy whose friendliness completely wiped away any feelings of pretentiousness both times we dined there.  Finally, we have had the pleasure of talking to the manager on several occasions and he is 100% committed to make sure that all diners have the best experience possible.  It is very refreshing to see such professionalism at all levels. It is very apparent that the chefs have fun with their dishes and diners should come in with an open mind.  Moto is clearly a must-try dining experience in Chicago for any adventurous foodies.  However, if you can't find novelty in actually eating your menu, then you might need to go somewhere a little tamer.",0.9972,0.783,0.2,0.017,0.5435285285285285

They automatically add 18% gratuity to the check. I'm sure they often get screwed by people who don't tip appropriately, but I would have tipped more (20%+) had they left it up to me.  Now ladies, I'm going to save you a few minutes of your time here. The toilet doesn't have a visible flushing handle.

The overly experimental food was pretentious at best and mostly tasteless.  The combination of flavors were an equally poor attempt to be creative.  Above all else, a restaurant needs to be known for it's food in addition to it's service.  The food was fair to poor in every regard.  This is another lesson in price does NOT equal quality.  In addition, everyone at our table left hungry, which is another issue altogether. -hPOD",0.6486,0.782,0.128,0.09,0.5892857142857143

Delivery timed just right with impeccable service and attention to detail, it's definitely worth the five hours to do the twenty course menu: something I was very nervous about heading in. It's a foodie's dream, and an amazing roller coaster for the senses. Right from the start when we were sharing laughs with the staff over earlier comments we'd posted to them via Twitter (encouraged per the menu!), staff was on point. Food arrived in steady intervals - not too fast, not too slow. This isn't an experience you want to rush even if you *are* hungry. Having time between courses allowed for great discussion and many, many laughs. My favorite course was the Cuban cigar -- how fitting for a rabid anti-smoker. Every course had ups and downs, highs and lows. At our table, there was only one person who truly didn't like one of the courses. Lucky husband, he got to eat her rejects. Yum. A tip of the hat to their accommodation of lactose/dairy intolerance. Menu items were not sacrificed in quality nor quantity as a result, leaving everyone at the table impressed and thankful that our dairyless friend shared the same  tasting experience as everyone else. As Jen V. suggests, stay away from the basement. We sat upstairs, but were invited to the kitchen to have our final course with the chefs. On the way down we had to pass through this area and I couldn't believe that they'd actually seat people here. The space seems like an afterthought and definitely lacks the ambiance of the main dining room. One group had a young child with them, and I'm a bit confused as to why they'd bring the little one to a place like this. While I'm fine eating a foie gras cupcake, something tells me little Jimmy might find it a bit offputting. I didn't hear too much screaming from that side of the room, so perhaps they fed him chocolate truffles until he passed out.

His food is definitely challenging and not for the faint of heart. There are some hits and some misses for sure... but that comes from the creativity and wild - it's just fun to see what kind of ""rabbit hole"" experience it's going to be. It's totally experimental stuff and that is pretty wild. Plus, did I mention that the chef does research for NASA? From the ""Arnold Palmer"" freezies to the Kobe beef Shabuccino, I mean, this is stuff is totally far out. It makes you laugh and brings out the kid inside of you. The only real criticism I have was the timing of the dishes. Basically, you can stay there for 5-6 for dinner which in my humble opinion was a little too drawn out. I mean, most people do not want to be sitting for 5 hours for a chef's tasting menu. My husband and I found ourselves waiting for up to 20-25 minutes between dishes. We definitely did not expect to be at the restaurant for that long. For this, they lose one star. Service is wonderful because the waiters are not professional wait staff - they are chefs themselves in the kitchen.

Food & mocktails were nearly flawless in their engineering, flavor and creativity (had the 10 course meal with mocktail pairings).  but very disappointed in the overall dining experience. I have not read the other reviews but i would not come back, because the dining experience was so disappointing. For $350, i want the full experience and don't want to be relegated to the basement ""lab"" with minimal service and a disappointing ambience. (read: request upstairs seating!) .  Went here for a saturday night valentine day meal with my wife. this was our first time at moto. Had been to otom a couple of times and had been saving moto for a special occasion.  Made reservations 3 weeks in advance. Woman told us we would have the option of the fixed price or the standard ""a la carte"" menu.  Not true. We were undecided on how committed we were to the fixed price 10/20 course experience and I'm unsure if we would have gone if we would have known the $350 fixed price prior to going.  According to our waiter, weekends are always fixed price. Would have been nice to know prior to going. So that was frustration number one.  When we get there they take us to the recently remodeled basement, aka ""the lab"". Nice place for a group dinner party or food class, but definitely not the place I would have chosen for a high end dining experience. Surrounded by beakers and a giant element table with a 11th grade science lab table in the middle for ""food experiments"", the place had a ton of potential to be ""fun"", but the experience itself did not play off the lab theme with the exception of the the root beer liquid nitrogen beverage which came in a beaker.  As a result, we were left with tables and carpet that looked like they were bought on the cheap and did not match the rest of the modern or theme-specific decorum.  Plus with limited seating and an old, stuffy pretentious dark suit to a saturday night dinner wearing crowd with their sunless wives, this was not a fun, festive, unique, or memorable dining experience. Throw in two servers who had an added value of 0 with the exception of having memorized the complicated explanations of the 10 courses. No conversation, jokes, repartee, personality, or comments about the food or experience. nothing! we were there for 3 hours! They just delivered food and were derelict in their drink duties. I routinely have better service at the take-out burrito place in pilsen. seriously.  maybe the mandatory 18% gratuity has something to do with it. Perverse incentives anyone? Would rather have had monkeys deliver the food.   For mocktail drinkers, two of the three drinks the mixologist created were phenomenal. (1) Beet juice, soda and cocoa powder and (2) freshly squeezed OJ and bitters. LOVING IT. thank you mr magoo :).",0.9138,0.798,0.116,0.087,0.500095238095238
2010-02-15,2.0,"I am still in shock over the price tag for our dinner last night versus the quality of the food we received. Let me first caveat this review by admitting that we did try Moto for VDay, and restaurants do tend to cut corners on that day since a lot of occasional diners are in, and it's a big profit generating day. THAT BEING SAID, I truly expected more for the fine dining experience Moto purports to be. I'm sorry, but garlic toast and french fries, loaded or not, are not on my list when I think of spending a car note's worth (and a nice car at that!!) on a dinner. The Good: +  Service -- Timely. Attentive without being obtrusive. Not overly fussy. + WINE!! I am so pleased that we added the wine pairing or else the evening would have been a total bust. We enjoyed some truly outstanding wines last night, most of which paired nicely with the food. + Atmosphere. A lot of the ""nicer"" restaurants in Chicago are too stuffy and formal. We liked the upscale but relaxed vibe, as well as the intimate but not overly stuffed dining room. The Not so good:  - The Food  Truly disappointing since we were super excited about the place. Yes, the presentation was creative .... But the flavors were not (we did have the ubiquitous pork belly (about 1/10 ounce of a piece) and lots of truffle oil). The food was luke warm and the portions were small even for fine dining (the poor bf had to eat leftovers afterwards). There were a couple of truly unfortunate dishes (liquid paella), and while some were good (foie gras, chef's take on shabu shabu) none of the dishes left me craving more.   Very disappointing, and unfortunate that the restaurant missed the opportunity to convert the first time triers to regulars.",0.9968,0.684,0.242,0.074,0.5809649122807017

2009-12-31,4.0,"First let me say that the 20 course gtm (grand tasting menu?) is frankly too much - it took us 5.5 hours to get through it and by the end we were rolling our eyes with trepidation at the thought of the final few courses.  As my better half pointed out - this is Louis XIV territory. We paired it with the half wine tasting menu which usually consists of 6 wines, although we ended up getting 8 as our waiter slipped in a couple of extras as the evening progressed.  The only downside to the half menu is that you'll be without wine for a few courses here and there, but trust me by the end of the meal you won't be feeling hard done by. The food and atmosphere of the place is really fun and full of theatre.  Whilst it is pretentious (what do you expect?) it's not at all snooty so you can sit back, relax and enjoy a joke with the waiters.  Even if you yourself are snooty, by course 15 you'll be sitting back and relaxing whether you like it or not. For some reason our waiter had it in his notes that I was a Chef and despite explaining there had been some kind of mix-up, that didn't stop him organising us a tour of their food ""lab"" and an introduction to the sous-chef to talk about some of the courses.  The ""lab"" was next to the kitchen and was apparently where they experimented with centrifuges and microscopes to invent new dishes; frankly it felt a bit staged and I would've rather have seen the actual kitchen, but either way it was a fun end to the evening. All in all we had a great time and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a memorable evening of gastronomy. It's probably worth noting that we thought we'd booked ourselves in for the 10 course menu, but by the time we'd realised we were on the 20 course menu it was too late to do much about it - you lose track of the course numbers very quickly.  So it's worth confirming you're getting what you expected before starting out.",0.9944,0.841,0.142,0.017,0.38910427807486625

Other random points of note... I would suggest not coming here when it's hot outside, Moto is squeezed between two meat packing plants so It smells quite strongly of rotting flesh outside.  Every time the door opened I thought I was going to vomit.

The restaurant is located in the seedy bowels of Chicago.  Specifically located in the meatpacking district, It is off the beaten path, and the food represents this nonconformist mentality also. As you walk into the restaurant, you see a very meticulously calculated interior design with mod overtones.  No wild colors, just very basic shades that allow for no distraction from the food that is about to be served to you. From a food standpoint, the highlights of our meal were as follows:   Instant risotto- as instructed by our server, the rice krispy-like risotto was dropped into a savory broth forming the most delicious and creamy risotto Cuban cigar- shredded pork tightly wrapped in a leafy green (to resemble Castro's tobacco product of choice) with the ashes of the cigar being a spice mixture that enhanced the meaty goodness Sunny-Side Up Eggs- a passion fruit puree formed to look like an egg yolk surrounded by a coconut cream to resemble the egg white.  Sweet and delicious Cherry Bomb- a play on a childhood firework, this chocolate dessert was served with an actual wick that was lit and sparked.  Creative and a nice way to finish the meal. As I ate these dishes, I began to unconsciously become nostalgic.  I was transported to my childhood.  Maybe it was because I was allowed (and encouraged) to play with my food.  Maybe it was the play on universal comfort foods.  Maybe it was the laughter that the food elicited.  Regardless, I left Moto feeling happy and content, with no worries in the world.  Definitely don't go to Moto to eat, go to experience.

Pricewise it would be steep (@ $110 for 10-courses and $70 for wine pairings), if it weren't for how perfect each course is, how on target the service, how gorgeous the dining room.   Best menu I've ever eaten!  Saving my pennies so we can go back...",0.8517,0.779,0.155,0.066,0.6055555555555556
2009-08-13,5.0,"I'd been thinking about Moto since I heard of it a few months ago, so in honor of my birthday a week or so ago, a friend and I went for dinner.  As a food science major, I was really able to appreciate all the bizarre forms the food came in, and I especially loved how most of the food was not at all what you expected from the appearance. For instance, the mexican cannoli looked like a fantastically plated dessert, with chocolate sauce drizzled artfully over the cannoli and the plate, and whipped cream surrounding it... But it wasn't chocolate sauce, it was mole, and the whipped cream was a white powder that melted as it touched your tongue, and the cannoli itself was a crisp dough filled with duck legg, with sour cream on the ends.  I think the experience absolutely was worth the money, as you're not only paying for the food, but the interesting methods of preparation and plating. However, I have one complaint, and I think it's somewhat significant. We ordered the 10 course meal, because when we checked the menus on their website, the 10 course had some stuff we really wanted to try, and while the 20 course had some interesting things as well, we really wanted the cuban cigar which wasn't on it.  But when we got to the restaurant, we noticed that the table near us that had the 20 course option was getting all the same courses as the 10 course tables, plus more. Checking the menu again, we learned that yes, in fact the 20 course menu does include most if not all of the 10 course options, but with different names. It seems like they're trying to trick their patrons into coming back a second time making them think they'll have a completely different menu. So anyone having trouble deciding between the two, know this. If you have five hours and $175 to spare, go for the 20 course. The 10 course is great, but you might regret missing out on the 'strawberry flakes?' dish that makes you blow smoke out your nose.  (Seriously.)",0.9593,0.859,0.097,0.043,0.4244949494949494

If you're looking for a creative, delicious meal, Moto will not disappoint. We had the twenty course offering which while delicious, was a little overwhelming.  If we had the opportunity to do it over again, we'd definitely have gone with ten course offering. Although prices are somewhat high, a dinner at Moto is definitely a worthwhile endeavor. Service was excellent.  The servers were incredibly attentive to our needs, and explain each dish as it is served.  After accidentally leaving my jacket at the restaurant, it was personally delivered by an employee back to our hotel.  Service doesn't get any better than that.

2009-08-02,2.0,"As fine dining goes, Moto underwhelms My wife and I went for our 7th wedding anniversary and were looking forward to the creative and inventive menu.  We opted for the 10-course and the wine pairing.   While the dishes fulfilled the deserved reputation for playfulness and creativity, my wife and I both commented to each other on the first few courses the flavors would have come together so much better had the food been hot, or even warm.  We mentioned to our server that we liked the flavors, but wondered how they were meant to be served temperature-wise and were told warm to hot, at which we mentioned our food was coming out room temperature to cold.  Our server said that was definitely not right, that the french onion soup (onion & gruyere on that night's menu) in particular should have been hot.  She promised to tell the chef.   So fine, I expected things would get back on track and our food would start coming out hot, whimsical and delicious.  Not so.  The next dish was also cold.  We mentioned it to the next server, who again said it should have been warm to hot and promised to tell the chef.  At which point they said they chef would add a few courses to our menu.  A fine gesture, but unnecessary.  Just serve what I ordered hot.  Or warm.  Or lukewarm.  When another soup (one of the bonus courses) came out ice cold, we did not finish it.  Another server, when clearing our plates giggled minnie-mouse-like and said, ""How was it?  Not your favorite I guess?"" at which point I said, ""No, as we've mentioned twice already tonight, the flavors are interesting, I just wish everything wasn't coming out cold.  Especially soup.""  Again she promised to tell the chef, who I am sure was well sick of hearing about it by now.  I am not a chef, but I would have thought at some point he would have told the kitchen to make sure the next course came out piping hot.  Send us bubbling molten lava on a plate or something - trust me we would have gotten the joke.  The last thing I would send out at this point is more cold food.  But that is exactly what happened.  Not one dish all night even room temperature.  Not one. Add that I felt a few dishes were underseasoned and a lot of them could have used more acid, and I was left feeling the food could have been stunning, but just wasn't. Had it been stunning, one could forgive the clumsy service (pouring two different wines into the same glass, not clearing plates and glasses promptly).  One could forgive the poor lighting.  One could forgive automatically adding 18% to every bill.  One could forgive wrinkled tablecloths (on every single table).  Great food covers all manner of minor issues such as these, but just okay food in a place that can't serve a hot plate of food charging $110/pp for a 10-course tasting menu and $70/pp for wine pairing is more than a little disappointing.   At roughly this price point much better options in Chicago include Avenues, Alinea, Tru, Trotter's, Arun's (where the spectacular food does overwhelm the quirky decor and clumsy service), Spring, Les Nomades and many more.   Wanted to love it, but won't be back soon.",0.9982,0.789,0.187,0.024,0.5745709995709998
2009-07-28,4.0,"i really enjoyed our meal at moto. i toyed with giving it a three star rating but just couldn't due to the fact that i haven't experienced anything remotely close creativity wise.  the food was very very good. but i'm not 100% convinced it warrants the high price tag. i think the creativity of the dishes slightly pulls the wool over your tastebuds, the look is better than the actual taste, but i think your eyes convince you that its amazing. when in reality the food is just really very good. not great. i thought that the creativity of the presentation deserved an A+. for goodness sake, i ate something that looked like a real cigar with ashes! amazing. speaking of the cigar, it may have been my favorite dish. the flavor was great the the presentation was spot on.  we went with our usual group of 6 (max and i have 4 friends that we try to eat out with once a week), we made our reservation about two weeks in advance. and requested special consideration for two of our friends who don't eat pork. they were extremely accommodating and nice. when we arrived, we were seated right away and had a great table. we ordered a few bottles of wine and the journey began. we opted for the 10 course rather than the 20. it just seemed a bit overwhelming.  we were very happy with our choice. it was a nice amount of time and all of the courses were great.  the service was good overall, although the kitchen did have a slight problem and there was a decent amount of time between courses 7 and 8. when we asked (very politely) about the delay, instead of just apologizing, our waitress suggested that ""we'll just plate your last 2 courses on the same plate since you are in a hurry"", we were not in a hurry at all. and she made it seem like we were complaining when really we were just curious what was going on. so this was just a little off-putting. but really this was pretty minor. overall very good. i would absolutely recommend trying moto at least once. it is truly an experience. i'm just not sure if i would go back. at least for another few years.",0.9977,0.689,0.236,0.075,0.5508713961775187

Very creative courses (i.e. menu is printed on garlic crostini, use of liquid nitrogen, cuban sandwich made into cigar, etc.) but some of the flavors were a bit muddled and only one of the dishes had real pop. Service was a bit lacking for what I expected: staff was not warm, nor should it have to be, but it wasn't helpful or informative either which is a problem with an adventurous menu (almost as problematic as run-on sentences...).  It's a large time commitment (got the 10 courses) and I felt as though I spent too much time sitting there waiting for the next course. Perhaps going with someone you haven't seen in years is better than going with the people you had just spent the whole day with.  After 4 hours I felt that I had experienced it enough for years to come.

Yes, its quite expensive, but its certainly well worth it for a special occasion.  We chose to go with the 10 course tasting. My biggest fear is thinking that I'd be hungry after 10 course of small bites. Not so, we were absolutely stuffed after and wondered if we could of survived the 20 course offering.  The 10 courses led us through a progression from starters through deserts with each placing emphasis on amazing taste, creativity and science. In some way, each dish played with your senses, whether it was smell, sight, touch, etc., the food really jumped out in some sort of unique way. For example, who knew that eating a cuban cigar in a dirty ash tray could taste like a gourmet burrito. Or feeling like you're at a sports bar chowing on buffalo wings after eating a piece of paper with a flying buffalo on it.  Each of their dishes were unique and complex, yet the flavors were very down to earth and welcoming. I tasted everything from breakfast food and smores to mexican food and french onion soup.

2009-05-18,3.0,"I first found out about this restaurant through a friend's youtube link that reminded me of what my wd-50 experience should have been, had I not gotten food poisoning the night before.  Naturally, this was the first, and only thing I planned prior to going to Chicago on a weekend trip. Without getting into too much details about each of the 10 courses, it's easily the most creative meal I've ever had.  Somewhere along the lines though, a mixture of the food could have caused some funny reaction in my stomach, that I like to think is pretty iron clad.  As I'm sure putting together 10 courses that mix well together is a daunting task, trying dishes that range from italian, french, to cuban was overwhelming. Now, whether that is the intent of the chef, I'm unsure, but my 3 stars is strictly on taste.  Had I been rating on creativity and presentation, it'd easily be 4.5-5.   My favorite dish of the night: ""House Made Pequin Capon"", which is fancy word for buffalo wings.  I first was instructed to eat a paper that had a printed flying buffalo on it.  This was the start of a delicious course that involved capon (castrated chicken to which I've had oh so many delicious encouters with..) and pulled pork, complemented by the tasty paper that tasted EXACTLY like buffalo wings.   My favorite dessert of the night: ""ACME s'mores"".  This was a little chocolate bomb (it was literally shaped like a cartoon bomb) that was lit on fire.  With a thin outside shell of chocolate and a graham cracker caramel type concoction in the inside, this was a bite sized delicious explosion in my mouth. All in all, I cherished and very much enjoyed the experience, but the food and tastes were nothing I've never had before.",0.9942,0.791,0.183,0.026,0.6363984674329501
2009-05-10,2.0,"I really struggled with how to rate Moto.  Is it better than the average restaurant?  Yes, absolutely.  Then why the meager two star rating you ask?  Because, if Moto is going to price themselves up there with the varsity players then that's who they're going to be judged against.  In the category of $500+ (for two people) dinner establishments in Chicago, in my opinion there is Alinea as the winner lapping the field, and a second echelon containing places such as Les Nomades and Trotter's.  I didn't feel that Moto came even close to competing with any of them, and should not be mentioned in the same breath.     It's too bad, I had been eagerly anticipating eating at Moto for some time, mainly due to the reviews, the reputation and the pedigree of the team.  I can't tell if they once were a great restaurant that just lost their way, or an over-hyped place that was never there in the first place....needless to say it was spectacularly disappointing. For us, the service was very middling.  We were seated immediately which was nice and water was brought to the table right away, but then we sat there for almost 20 minutes before the waiter came back to take our order.  Worse, we we're never asked if we would like to have a drink while we waited.    Throughout the dinner the waitstaff came across as very green.  For a Saturday night, I would have expected the ""A"" team, but though they were attentive and VERY friendly, they did not seem to be very knowledgeable and didn't really seem to have the confidence and polish to take command of the meal.  In top places, usually you see very seasoned, confident and skilled servers who act as your guide through your dining experience.  Not so much here.  I wonder if they're having high turnover or if they are cutting costs (it wasn't nearly full on a Saturday night at 8PM!).    I didn't see anyone on the floor that seemed to be over the age of 25 so there's certainly a leadership gap there.   We did the 10 course menu which was plenty of food and matched it with the wine pairing.  Have to say that the wines were fine and plentiful but nothing really stood out as memorable, let alone transcendent.  The ""sommelier"" was very nice but wasn't very confident. polished or informative.  Maybe we caught them on restaurant internship night... The ambiance was fine, very modern/contemporary, though it can get  a little loud.  However, by 9:30 it started slowing down and wasn't too bad. As for the food, well, as the two star rating attests: Meh, I've experienced better.  Some interesting combinations and definitely some brave pairings.  But it just didn't tickle me where I itch if you know what I mean.  More troubling, a couple of offerings were just poor.  The breakfast course came out with two ""tater tots"" that were WAY over salted and just nasty.  The second one went uneaten on both my and my GF's plates.  A couple other courses just seemed to have a jumble of flavors that didn't make the sum greater than the component parts.  Over half the dishes were too liberally salted.  The only standout was the cigar which was clever and delicious.  But by the end, we were rather bored with the tedium of it all, and rather than basking in the afterglow of a wonderful meal, we settled the tab and got the hell out.  We won't be going back.   If you have been to any of the restaurants I mentioned before (Alinea, Trotters, Les Nomandes), please trust me and don't bother with Moto, you will experience epic disappointment.  If you haven't been to any of them, a trip to Moto will make you love them even more when you do go, or even better, save yourself the hassle and the moolah and go to one of them instead.",0.9961,0.789,0.146,0.066,0.5523700253048079

The gtm is a shifting 15 to 20 course tasting spectacular; tonight it was an 18 course festival of taste, texture, temperature, and trickery. Yes, he's famous for mad inventions of his own, such as edible inks that he prints via inkjet onto edible paper that incorporate with various dishes, and repurposing other technology, such as a cook-at-the-table 400° NASA-designed-polymer steamer that offers spicing of two courses via aroma while you watch it cook a third course (without any heat source other than the 200° sauce in the bottom compartment) in front of you. More importantly, though: he's an artist. He understands the subtleties of the holistic dining experience and presents them in a way that transcends description. He's no mere technician or trickster; he's the genuine article, capable of taking you to a state of culinary bliss that I've only experienced in four or five restaurants before. In fact, during the third dish, I hit a place that I truly hadn't found in perhaps six or seven years, in terms of dining. I recognized a resonance that I hadn't felt, gastronomically, since the height of Charlie Trotter's in the 90s. So it came as no surprise when we asked ""Where was Chef Cantu before here?"" and one of the first answers was Trotter's. Clearly, tutelage under the master worked wonders for Cantu; you can see the touches in the waitstaff's attention to detail, in the nature of the tasting menu, and in the daring of the dishes. But Cantu takes it to the next step, truly embracing the ""postmodern cuisine"" phenomenon full-tilt. Edible info blurbs float like hypertext on your dishes (we had no less than three expositories in our dinner); he even had a nod to the very concept of hypertext in the name of the first dish -- ""MAKI in the 4th dimension"". An artichoke and macadamia nut morsel that came on one spoon as a combination of purée and sorbet, shaped like a little snowman, designed to be eaten in one swift pop into your mouth. A carbonated half-orange that you squeeze yourself over a portion of lobster sitting next to a sphere of brown butter, all resting on a small cake of lobster sorbet. Chips, in the form of a small ball of purée, and salsa, in the form of a small translucent gelée cube, on one spoon. Every dish, every single dish, had some flair or distinction to it. Pros: Brilliant cuisine, wonderful mad-scientist feeling with even more brilliant technologies. Cons: Experiments occasionally fail. But that's pretty rare indeed. Summary: True post-modern cuisine that's sensorially masterful. Priced like New York and worth every penny.",0.9915,0.844,0.122,0.034,0.5149021268586487
2009-03-31,4.0,"Moto is an EXPERIENCE. The food is art. It tests boundaries. This is not comfort food (although they do spin offs of some common comfort foods, like BBQ beans). Actually, some of the dishes really were un-comforting to me, but I think that is all part of the experience. You eat and pay close attention to the flavors, the contrasts, the creativity and the irony. My husband took me here for my birthday. I have always wanted to try gastronomic cooking and of course after seeing Homaro Cantu on Iron Chef, I really wanted to try Moto. We were not disappointed. There were two dishes that I did not like (one that I could not eat and gave to my husband), but, a.) that's what you get when you do a preset menu and b.) it may not have suited my tastes, but it certainly entertained me.  We had the 10 course tasting which equals about 2.5 hours of your time. We were told that a 20 course tasting can last for 4.5 hours. We did not have the wine paring because that was an extra $70 per person and I probably would have been drunk and too full. 10 courses was PLENTY for me! By the 6th course, I was totally full. The 20 course looked interesting, but I have no idea how I would have made it through that one. I wish I would have worn a dress because my pants got so tight around my stomach! From what it looked like to me, the 20 course eaters got the same food that the 10 course people did, but with 10 additional courses. I'm pretty sure our menu was inspired by Warner Bros. cartoons from the good 'ol days. Our menu, printed and pasted on a corn chip, tasted amazing as did the smooth guacamole and salsa. That was actually some of the best tasting salsa I have ever had. Our first course blew my mind! It was a crab cake made to look like a slice of breakfast sausage served with a pina colada and passion fruit, sunny-side-up ""egg"". The egg white had very similar texture to a cooked egg white, but tasted like coconut. And the egg yolk, again, looked exactly like an over easy egg yolk, tasted like passion fruit. The yolk acted EXACTLY like a real egg yolk. You poked it with a fork and the filling comes pouring out, but leaving a slight skin around the outside. The consistency was even the same. I will remember that dish for the rest of my life! I did not really enjoy the Cuban Cigar. This was basically a Cuban sandwich made to look like a cigar, served in a stainless steel ashtray with ground sesames and some spices (I think cumin) to emulate ashes. It was a little too limp for me (I would have liked some contrast in textures) and I thought it was a little heavy on the cumin (or whatever the spice was). My husband liked it, though. The ""road kill on a plate"" was clever. I smiled. However, I was not a total lover of the duck confit that it consisted of. This was the second course in which we had a confit of fowl and a.) I didn't really want to try another one, b.) it was almost a pureed type of meat texture, which I was not so into and c.) it was a bit over salted for me. This was our 7th course and I was already beyond the threshold of being full, so I wasn't really hungry enough to devour the duck confit. So I avoided it. But I did eat the sauces (red beet sauce to represent blood was so good). The BBQ brisket was fantastic and it was served with a side of cole slaw ice cream. It looked exactly like cole slaw actually. But of course it was frozen shards of tri colored, cabbage creaminess. I tried eating the cole slaw with a bit of the brisket, but that was just totally weird! Warm meat with ice cream! Well, I guess the cole slaw ice cream is a love it or hate it type of thing. For my husband and I, we hated it! But that's okay, because I am happy to know that I have tried cole slaw ice cream! Okay, so my favorite dessert item: ""ACME S'mores"". It was this little, round, chocolate ball with a white wick sticking out of the top. Our server lit the wick with a tiny torch and it sparked and eventually went out and left a charred wick. You put the whole thing in your mouth and, with your mouth totally closed, smash the chocolate ball. It explodes. Cool liquid fills your mouth and after a few seconds you taste a perfect s'more! The texture is completely off, but somehow it all comes together to form a perfect s'more taste. The charred wick acts as the charred taste of a marshmallow. I even tasted the graham cracker! It was wild.  Our service was impeccable. I have never had such perfect service anywhere. The atmosphere was clean, simple and welcoming. It was not stodgy at all. My husband wore nice jeans, a button down and a blazer and that was perfect. You don't have to get super dressed up to come here. They have a nice valet service, however, we took a cab. It can be pretty tough to get a cab in this area, but they will call a cab for you when you are ready to leave. In the end, our bill was $330 (for 2 10 course tastings and 2 martinis). 18% gratuity is included. Great experience. But it will be a one time deal for us.",0.9995,0.754,0.199,0.047,0.5010369220151829

It is neat to experience how food can be deconstructed and then reconstructed and presented in a way that you had never thought of. Some courses tasted better than others and definitely offered a lot of playfulness. A few of the items (the crackers, and molded brain) were a bit on the salty side. It appears that someone had mistaken the tablespoon for the teaspoon when measuring the salt! We toughed it out, and had all 20 courses. It was good, playful and inspiring. Service was excellent.

2009-02-21,5.0,"I've been to Moto 4 times in the past 2 years.  I've tried both the 10 course (3 times) and the 20 course (once).  The 20 course is worth trying once but it requires a large time commitment as well as a big dent in the wallet especially if you also get the wine pairing. I have never been disappointed in any of my visits here.  I really love how the waitstaff, who also help prepare the dishes, are so knowledgeable about the dishes.  They provide a great description of each dish and can answer detailed questions about each dish.  On one visit, my group was provided a tour of the kitchen.  It was amazing seeing all the unique kitchen equipment that they use.  I grew up in Chinese restaurant kitchens and the contrast between the two were day and night.  Moto's kitchen was more like a test kitchen crossed with a mad scientist's lab complete with flashing yellow lights and the chefs were headsets to communicate. The menus change seasonally but there are some dishes that tend to stay longer or are rotated in more often than others.  My favorite dishes are the braised duck, the Southern Style BBQ, and the cotton candy balls.  The cotton candy balls explode in your mouth.  Some of my least favorite dishes are the Greek salad and some of the dessert dishes.  For the Greek salad, they take a Greek salad and puree it.  They do something else to it to intensify the flavor and the salad is served in an eye dropper.  It still tastes good but not one of my favorites.  As for the dessert dishes, they tend to be very sweet and intense.  Sometimes it actually hurts my teeth to eat them. Having tried the tasting menus at Alinea, Morimoto's (in Philadelphia), Everest, and other places I would rate Moto's as having the 2nd best tasting dishes on their tasting menu.  The best being Morimoto's.  In terms of presentation, Moto's is by far the hands down best.  Each dish is served in a unique and usually custom made plating.  For example, there is one dish (can't remember the name) that comes out in a Battleship (the game) style plating.",0.997,0.799,0.178,0.023,0.4786173767752716

Based on looks alone, one might expect less of it, no electric sliding door, more relaxed dress code requirements, less ritzy part of town, but I can assure you, although this place may not have the latest in state of the art threshold technology it does have pretty damn good food, after all it is a restaurant. I started off with a simple drink, the Fulton Sunrise, gin mixed with white grape juice, brandy and lime, not bad.  One of my dinner companion was a bit more daring however, she ordered the chorizo margarita, which I had a few sips of.  It had a smoky sort of lime flavor to it, but was surprisingly refreshing. After going with the tasting (12 courses) at Alinea we decided to give the 20 course meal a go at Moto.  I will say this, if you have a lot of time to kill (6+ hours) and are utterly famished go all the way otherwise stick with 10 courses.  Personally, after sitting there for six hours, the last thing I wanted was another course, no matter how tasty it was. Out of the 20, I found the majority of the courses to be very tasty, from the edible menu and spicy chicken-wing flavored paper to the oil spill and cuban cigar.  There was, however, one course in particular that I really did not care for, the savory creme brulee.  I do not remember exactly what was in it, but i remember biting into it expecting something familiar tasting and instead it tasted horribly bitter (especially the aftertaste).  Perhaps it was more a psychosomatic reaction than the actually dish itself, just prepare yourself to not expect it to taste how it looks if it is served to you.",-0.4213,0.831,0.083,0.086,0.4448979591836735
2009-01-25,5.0,"To quote Anthony Bourdain, ""Things are different now"". It was the Friday after my birthday. The entourage was partying in Vegas without me. I elected not to go to. Instead, I was in Chicago wrapping up work thinking to myself, ""What was I thinking turning down a Vegas B-Day trip""!?! Well, I was thinking Moto. And that's when I realized that things have indeed changed.  I'm a corporate manager now. My paycheck is about 4 times what it used to be. Now, the only interaction I have with food during the week is a vending machine in Building G or the corporate cafeteria. 4 years ago, I would have been giddy at the prospect of dining at Moto. So it was quite alarming that my feelings towards my B-Day dinner at Moto were no different than my feelings towards that vending machine. My dining experience at Moto helped me find that passion and excitement again. THE REVIEW Moto is located along Fulton St in Chicago's Meat Packing District. A shimmering Green light distinctly demarcates Moto. The front is very minimalist and pretentious---especially in its surroundings. It's a similar sensation to approaching the Comme des Garcons store in Chelsea, NY. It's a witty move that dramatizes what's to come. The restaurant is very small and intimate. There were only 5 other tables seated; mostly 2 tops. We were seated along a banquette. Moto is owned and operated by a very talented Chef, Homaro Cantu. He won his battle against Iron Chef Morimoto 2 years ago. He owns several patents and runs a consultancy, Cantu Designs. Every food company from Kraft, General MIlls, and Pepsi has approached this young chef to learn his secrets. Moto is tasting menu only. There are 2 menus to choose from: the 10 Course and the Grand Tasting Menu (GTM- 20 courses).  I chose the 10 course menu because the server had warned me that the GTM requires 4-5 hours of dining time. The 10 course, by comparison, only requires a slender 2 hours. I ordered a playful cocktail because the name intrigued me: Martini Library. What could this be? What would it look like? When my martini, or martinis, arrived I knew this evening would be special. It was a ""liquid Google"".  The cocktail is a library of different flavored martinis each distinguishable by colors resembling Gatorade: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow. Each flavor comes in a miniature plastic beaker. There were 2 beakers per flavor all kept ice cold on the rocks. My faves were the classic and lime. The menus arrive as your first course. This is the tastiest damn menu you'll ever eat! Literally. The menu was printed on a thin sheet of edible paper adhered to a fresh tortilla shaped like a tabulet. It came accompanied with lime creme fraiche, fresh guacamole, and fresh salsa. Dee-lish! Honestly, some of the best tasting chips and salsa I've ever had. Liquid Nitro Scallop was injected with butter and came with liquid nitrogen lemon powder, saffron and orange. The scallop was beautifully cooked and exploded with its own juice and butter in your mouth. Meanwhile, cold-smoke drifted from your mouth as you swallowed the lemon powder.  Greek Salad was nothing more than a tube of clear liquid that captured the pure essence of a Greek Salad: olives, feta, onions, lettuce, and tomato. Yet, none of these items were physically present. Seared Buffalo Hot Wings came with another edible piece of paper dusted with Buffalo Seasoning spice. Doritos should steal Chef Cantu's recipe for seasoning their Buffalo Flavored chips.  Cuban Cigar! This dish was AWESOME! A metal tray arrives with a glass test tube with neon green liquid and an ashtray with a burnt ""cigar"". The green liquid is a lime mojito minus the alcohol. The ""cigar"" is actually cooked collard greens wrapped around braised pork trotters. They add vegetable dye to give the collard greens the appearance of a cigar. Finally, they dry the cigar in a convection oven such that you may grab it without getting your hands dirty. The ""ashes"" were ground black sesame seeds which complimented the pork flavor quite nicely.  The evening progressed much this way. Perhaps, the least successful dish is the most widely publicized dish: RoadKill (duck confit). It wasn't plated properly and just looked like a pile of mush with marshmellow sauce and ketchup. The flavors weren't as harmonious as in the other dishes. The final savory course was named ""Chicago's smallest steak dinner"". Desserts were yummy too! I enjoyed the pumpkin pie dessert and the coconut and ginger milk was insane.  This was an overwhelmingly positive experience. I had 15 courses! The wine pairings were fantastic and the servers were professional yet every bit as playful as the chef's whimsical creations. Moto has its share of critics. I ain't one of them. Moto helped me regain the joy of eating out. I will definitely be returning. THANKSOMOTO.",0.997,0.844,0.119,0.036,0.5109407619797233

2009-01-04,3.0,"See profile site for full review with formatted pics. In a trip that included fantastic meals at Charlie Trotter's, Tru, Bongo Room, and Cafe Spiaggia it was my New Years Eve reservation at Moto with my sister that I looked forward to the most.  With only a small amount of exposure to the world of Molecular Gastronomy I'd seen videos of Fat Duck's obsurd bacon egg with liquid nitrogen preparred tableside and read numerous reviews of the presentations at El Bulli and Alinea - according to rumor, Chef Cantu's presentations at Moto were just as impressive even if the food was ""lower quality"" in ingredients and flavor.  Perhaps my hopes were too high or perhaps something was amiss, but on my first trip to Moto I thought the flavors were great; it was the presentation and service that were lacking.  From the ""too cool for you"" attitude of the servers to the overall lack of ""WOW"" to the meal something just felt off. Lodged in an area full of factories, galleries, and warehouses I couldn't help but think of Chelsea as the GPS steered us toward Moto and arriving at the neon green door I couldn't help but think ""hmm, this is it?""  From the obscure location to the cheap exterior to the bland interior and discolored paint and chipped wood leading to the bathroom I rather wonder where Chef Cantu is spending all his money.  Additionally, after e-mailing and calling the restaurant days and weeks before the meal, I was surprised that the menu was only finalized 4 days beforehand and that A) many of the chef's most famous dishes were omitted, B) no ""new"" dishes were being created for the holiday, C) innovative items like the black box or aromatic utensils were absent, and D)the price was increased to $150 for 12 courses while the ""additional surprises"" promised via phone were nowhere to be found.  Additionally, the meal which was promised to last 2:30-3:00 hours via E-mail in fact only lasted about 1:40 minutes leaving my sister and I stranded at the restaurant while my mother and aunt finished up elsewhere. With all those things noted, I must say I was quite impressed by some of the tastes and textures presented at Moto and that although I felt it was quite overpriced for both the quality and the presentation, that which we did receive was all quite delicious. When it was all said and done, I can't say I regret my experience - but I also cannot say it lived up to my expectations.  Given his training there is no doubt that Chef Cantu is a talented man with the skill-set to make amazing food, but given the ingredients used and the lack of props I rather wonder if the goal on NYE 2008 was simply to get people in and out as quickly as possible - despite the elevated pricetag.  With presentations far less intricate than others have described in the past and no lobster, foie gras, sweet breads, or other high end items on the menu it almost seemed as though the goal was to maximize profit instead of customer satisfaction.  Additionally, I personally was not a fan of the attitude of the female server, nor the 18% automatic gratuity considering the fact that our male servers fumbled over the descriptions multiple times and one of them even managed to knock over our neighbor's wine glass with one of the plates - the concept of a tip is that better service gets a better tips, if the gratuity is automatically included there is no incentive to perform better than average. While Moto was certainly a memorable experience with delicious food, the experience simply didn't warrant the cost and I'd be hard pressed to return given the reviews I've read of Alinea, Avenues, L2O, and the experiences I had at Tru and Trotter's the night before.",0.997,0.816,0.139,0.045,0.6003854478854479

Now, I realize, I'm not what one would describe as the ""elite."" I can't afford to eat here all the time, nor do I frequent establishments that would consider what they offer as ""fine dining."" So, am I in the demographic for this restaurant, what with my unsophisticated palate and shallow pockets? I don't care. I have yet to find another place, be it in Chicago or elsewhere, that offers up a more exquisite experience than Moto. From the moment you walk in, the waitstaff is there for you for whatever you might need. I've never had such attentive and friendly people taking care of me. They are one of the true highlights of the dinner, which should say something, because there's something positive to be said about it all. The food is astounding. I actually find myself at a loss for words (which is difficult for me, I'll have you know) when trying to find a way to perfectly describe everything. I've tried the ten-course and the GTM (which, I believe was eighteen or twenty courses the night I was there, and, trust me, the time it takes to get through it is completely worth it). Each and every course was perfect. Perfectly cook, perfectly presented, perfectly tasty. Even the edible menu they present you with (which also welcomes you, personally, in a little message printed at the bottom. Nice touch.) is wonderful. I had the best mojito here. A little glass of minty goodness that everyone should try. If I had to pick favorites? The Nitro Sushi and the Freeze Dried Macaroni and Cheese with Quail. But again, I feel bad even picking favorites, because with each dish that is presented to you, Chef Cantu shows his genius and offers you a meal you will not soon forget.  Moto is not just about the food. It's about the experience of trying something new. It shines a different light on something most of us take for granted.

It was right after I started culinary school, so it was kind of special. Normally, we would never have went somewhere quite so outrageous. The atmosphere at Moto is awesome. It almost felt like you were in a movie based off of a William Gibson novel. Very modern, almost futuristic... and a bit Asian. It was cool. As for the food, We chose the ten course meal with the wine pairing. It was amazing. A lot of people have complained about portion size, or that it isn't really food, or that it isn't even cooking. It doesn't matter. You don't go to Moto because your hungry. You go as a form of entertainment. What Moto does is create dishes based almost entirely on flavors and / or appearances. It is utterly surreal when you take a shot of liquid that tastes like a Greek Salad. Anyway, everything about our experience at Moto made it a little easier to swallow when the bill came. .It was a lot. Never before, and never since, have we spent so much on a meal. But when we think back about it, it was completely worth every penny.",0.9782,0.809,0.157,0.035,0.4162003968253967

I came here with my husband and his parents.  We ordered the GTM with the wine pairings.  Since my husband and I have eaten at Alinea, we had an idea of what was to come.  My in-laws had not and yet all of us were equally pleased of the meal.   The service was very good but not as good as Alinea.  Every time we left, they would take our napkin. However, they didn't always replace it so we would have to flag someone down for a new one.  It was a small detail that didn't really effect the meal. The meal itself was AMAZING.  The wine pairings were excellent.  I have had quite a few meals with the pairings were hit or miss.  Not here.  They complemented the food perfectly.   And the food?  I was impressed with the presentation as well as the consumption.  My favorite course was the the cigar course.  It was beyond my expectations in presentation as well as taste. I would highly recommend.  I doubt that I'll be back very soon as it is not the sort of place you visit regularly.  However, if you have a chance, try it.  It's fantastic!!",0.9938,0.746,0.222,0.032,0.5520178710178711

Plus everything I had has been reviewed in detail over and over.  My servers were outstanding and the wine pairings were creative and unique.  The Sommelier(Amie) even changed some of the pairings after we talked about my preferences.

2008-10-03,5.0,"I should have written this a month ago when I went, so now I will just throw in my few cents here and there to have done it. Moto is a great, fun, wonderful experience - so worth the price. I am sure the wine pairing would be a *blast* too - but as I had an interview the next day, and wanted to be able to *taste* and *remember* the food, we just slowly shared one bottle of white. We opted for the ten course tasting.   Of course by now u all know the menu is edible. A crunchy yummy chip served up with a side of some sort of sauce.  fun :) The CO2 Lemon and Sunchoke (scallop with liquid center) was decadent and delicious, though the 'carbonation' in the lemon was a little lost on me. Still, great first course. The ""Greek Salads"" were actually two fun salads - an octopus salad which was very good, and a tube of liquified cucumber you squeeze into your mouth. We were delighted children The ""House made chile pequin quail"" was one of my favorites. It came with another edible piece of paper that tasted like chili powder - unnecessary. But the quail was so juicy and lovely. Good job! The Cuban Cigar was, well, garish. It was served with an overly sweet ""virgin"" mojito that came in a glass with a huge ugly syringe in it.  The cigar itself as clever - the ashes being sesame seeds.  Oily in my opinion but my date loved it. Mozzarella caprese - very interesting take on this dish. It worked in a decadent way but floundered in the textural foundation ;)  Still a good dish. BBQ beans and slaw - Miss miss miss!  I was so looking fwd to this - being from Texas and love Texas brisket and beans. The brisket was just awful, the beans bland, and their frozen, dried, refrozen coleslaw took all the fun (and taste) out of the slaw! Braised duck - Thank god in Heaven for this dish! So delicious!  Did I mention it looks like 'road kill'??   Now you tell me what fine dining establishment you can go to and get served what looks like the remains of a small animal broken, mauled, and bloodied on your plate, brain thrown off to the side?  Now tell me where you can get it and have it taste exquisite. Salty, sweet, partially creamy. Another favorite. And a blast! Desserts came next. Raspberry forms is about right. -   I wasn't fond of the little frozen raspberries, nor of the sorbet (not my thing), but the gelatinous raspberry on the spoon (which the waiter told my date ""That's a one-biter!"") was super and fun :)  Blueberries & Cream -  I adore blueberries and this was presented beautifully. Very good also, nice textures all around. S'mores - such the rage right now ! And these came with a truffle! Fun take on smores, to be true, but I missed the graham cracker crunch :) They also gave us a complimentary glass of port. Thanks guys!  Anyone up for the GTM?? :D *Heart*  Moto  -   You do it up right :)",0.9996,0.637,0.316,0.047,0.5799645909645909
2008-09-29,5.0,"Wow, the smells as we enter the restaurant, not pleasant ones, I think the restaurant is in the meat packing area, not the best location for a restaurant. Seemingly in the middle of nowhere, you enter into the green building to find a pleasant little restaurant (be sure not to confuse it with Otom, the sister restaurant a couple doors down). But soon after you sit down, you are presented with the wine menu (which was pretty limited for a restaurant of this caliber, but the wines we did have were pretty good), and shortly after served the food menu... yes, served...The menu is EDIBLE! And has items such as ""Oil Spill"" and ""Roadkill of Fowl""!!! Wow, I knew we were in for a surprise, I just hope that the flavors will all be there.  There are two choices on the menu, The Ten and the GTM (Grand Tour Menu). Since it will probably be the only time we would ever come here and because we will be trying another foodie dream the next day, Alinea (review coming!), we chose to go with the 20 course Grand Tour. We were warned that it will take about 4.5 hours so with our 9 pm reservation, we wouldn't be leaving until 1:30. Our thoughts were, If they were willing to feed us until 1 am, we were willing to eat.  - Edible menu with summer truffle - Liquid center scallop - A scallop filled with a saffron liquid served on a tofu and vanilla puree and an orange on the side. Next to it was a yuzu soaked lemon that they suggest you squeeze onto the dish before eating. This was served with a sparkling sake that with the a bite of the dish, tasted like a creamsicle.  - Kalamata & feta - Greek Salad/Liquified - Nitro Sushi Roll - Oil Spill - As unpleasant as it sounds, this dish was a pretty large chunk of tuna served in a bowl with a crispy wonton. Tableside, the waiter pours in a green liquid (to represent the ocean). Then he tells us to rock the wonton (the barrel of oil) back and forth and squid ink flows through the ocean. A fun playful dish with great flavor, but the concept of the oil spill was kinda hard to take in. - Biscuit Crème Brûlée - Ants on a log with Foie Gras - Seared buffalo hot wings - A chili braised quail with blue cheese, carrots and celery accompanied by a tiny piece of edible paper with buffalo wings printed on. We were instructed to go between eating the paper and the quail which amazingly tasted exactly alike.  - Cuban Missile Crisis - Another fun dish that is ""prepared"" tableside. The waiters bring a metal serving ""dish"" with a beaker and a syringe served aside a ash tray and a ""cigar"". The waiter empties the syringe into the beaker creating a ""faux-jito"" (alcohol free mojito). The cigar is a pork wrapped and seared. Good dish, not great or spectacular. I think many of Moto's dishes weren't made to change your life flavor-wise, but more a mind-fu*k with food. Fun and playful.  - Fresh from the Garden - Smoked brisket & cornbread - Roadkill of Fowl - Kinda hard to appreciate something called Roadkill, but it wasn't too bad. On the plate was a beet puree, a mushroom formed into a brain, a line of marshmallow, and a mix of puff rice and salt to toasted to look like maggots. Oh, and this was served with shredded pork. An interesting presentation that tasted pretty good. I just stayed away from the marshmallow that didn't do anything for me.  - Fajita with aromatic utensils - Under the Sea - There was soooo much going on on the plate that it was impossible to get it all, but the main part was a coconut ball filled with ginger milk. We were instructed to put the whole ball in to our mouth and let it explode. What a crazy experience. The rush of the juice was tons of fun...too bad I don't like coconut. Also on the dish was nitrogen frozen raspberries bits and a edamame ice cream. Overall very delicious. - White Chocolate & Peanut - The next dessert was my favorite fun dish. A ball of white chocolate filled with a popcorn sorbet that we were told was to feel like popcorn popping in our mouth. This was definitely the case thanks to the pop rocks that continued to pop even after I swallowed the ice cream. This dish gave me a good chuckle.  - Blueberry cake & Ice Cream - Powered Peach Doughnut - Chocolate and Fluff - We were told by our waitress that it was her favorite dish and I could understand why. A chocolate cake filled with a liquid graham cracker over a toasted marshmallow smear (brown smear, not pretty to look at). Awesome smores taste.  - Cafe con Leche - Basically coffee and a biscotti...but reversed... A warm biscotti drink served with liquid nitrogen frozen coffee.  Overall, a great meal. The pacing was slow, as we were often sitting there for several minutes with nothing in front of us. Also, it was a pretty unspectacular wine list, but the wine's we did have were very good. I would definitely recommend, but I probably wouldn't return... there are plenty of other places out there I would like to go, such as Alinea tonight.

Weird science indeed. I'm so glad that I finally had a chance to try it a few weeks ago, when I was in Chicago for business.  I had been a little apprehensive about the alleged 3 hour dining experience (we ordered the 5-course, and my friends who had previously dined at Moto advised us to beware of the long meal) - but it wasn't bad at all. In fact, I'd venture to say that they whisked the food away from us right as we ate the last bite - almost too quickly in some instances. I did see the waitstaff peeking out from behind a door, watching everyone eat so they could time things correctly.  I believe they adjust the amount of food based on the # of courses you taste - so you just get smaller portions for the 5 hour GTM. Highlights include the aforementioned things, particularly the last course of coffee and biscotti. The ""coffee"" was liquid flavored as biscotti with a touch of hazelnut, and the ""biscotti"" was the coffee flavored, liquid nitrogen dipped concoction.

2008-05-22,2.0,"I was recently in Chicago for the National Restaurant show and had the chance to visit several of Chitown's amazing establishments.  About 4 years ago I first heard of Chef Homaro Cantu from a very interesting article in wire magazine.    After that I was fascinated with his artistry of cooking and longed to visit Moto.   I finally had the chance to visit Moto this trip.  On my final night in Chicago I decided to spend a solo meal with Moto.  I was as giddy as a school girl.  I had nothing better to do that night and opted for the Grand Tasting Menu (GTM, 20 courses) and the wine pairings (around 16) and was ready to be taken away on a journey with Chef Cantu.    My First impression of the restaurant was a little off.  After dining at Alinea's beautiful restaurant I thought that for a fine dining establishment that the decor and dining room was a little cramped and lame.   Since I was alone I had plenty of time to meditate over the food, the wine, and the service.  First off the service was less than comparable for the amount of money I was paying.  4 times my silverware was set incorrectly placing utensils in the wrong place and then the server coming back to correct himself.  Next, twice they poured me incorrect wine.  Also the wine service was horrible.  Out of the nearly 16 wines I tasted not one of them were explained.  The sommelier did pour a couple of the wines, but still did not tell why she chose to pour the wine with that course.  Lastly, the food.  The food was truly inventive and tasty at times, but my biggest problem was when I questioned the methods of making the food I was told they could not tell.  This really bothers me.  First off any one with an understanding of Molecular Gastronomy can figure these things out, but that's not the point.  My point is when becoming a great chef (which chef Cantu is) half the point is spreading your knowledge and techniques to people that want to learn.    I understand that there are several patent  pending creations Chef works with, but knowledge is one of the best things you can give a person.  If chef is worried about others taking his ideas then why cook at all?  Did Auguste Escoffier horde his knowledge?  No, he published Le Guide de Culinaire which is considered one of the most important cook books of our time.  I am not saying to Chef to publish a cook book but be a little more open to maybe expressing his thought processes and understanding of the products he use.  I also was very surprised at the lack of use of luxurious ingredients.  I am not saying this makes a good meal but I also felt his products he did use were sub par   I guess at the end of the day it is about making money and that's the feeling I got when I left the restaurant.     By no means have I given up on Moto.  I believe it is on the forefront of modern cooking and very important to the gastronomic scene.  I am just hoping Chef Cantu realizes how important his cooking is and helps mold the future path of the Culinary world instead of keeping it to himself.",0.9851,0.841,0.108,0.052,0.5135185185185185

The decor was simple and clean, waitstaff friendly.  Patrons were either in their 20s (probably because they also didn't have the foresight to reserve a table early enough), or late 70s (probably because they like eating dinner at 5pm or earlier.)  The food... was fine. I was expecting more fanciness, but a few rehydrated or liquid nitrogenized things here and there, starting with a gimmicky ""edible"" menu, combined with a slightly overcooked grouper, and finally four (4!) of the ten dishes ended up being desserts. It was disheveled.  One dish, as far as presentation goes, was extraordinary: the Road Kill looked like exactly that, including rice puff maggots (questionable) and beet reduction blood-spatter.

As everyone else noted, the menu itself was presented as edible paper, with the 10 course selection neatly printed on it.  The first course involved kajiki and sesame; blue marlin with sesame poured from a nitrous pot.  It was pretty neat to spoon a bit of sesame into my mouth and exhale through my nose; smoke would filter out.  The greek salad and gumbo were rather forgettable dishes.  BBQ pork was surprisingly good.  It was tender, with a cider-based marinade.  The next course was a modern take on mac n' cheese, but with quail, powdered parmesan, and pasta.  By this time, I was too full to finish it - but it was okay.  The desserts were probably the most welcome part of the evening.  Each dish was presented in unique ways, and tasted very different from one another.  My favorite involved the 2 and 3 dimensional truffle - there was a surprise with the truffle ball. So the food itself involved lots of hits and misses, but the drink pairings were spot on.  I had non-alcoholic beverages; I had to drive back.  My favorite was the lemon drop.  It involved lemonade encased in a gelatinous ball. Service was thorough, attentive, and extremely professional.  With each plate, the server spoke a little about it and answered any questions I had.  I never had to get his attention; he just knew when to drop in and he was never intrusive.  Overall, it's an interesting experience, but one I would not repeat at MOTO.  Why?  Because I might as well buck up for other great molecular gastronomy destinations a la El Bulli, Fat Duck, and Alinea.",0.9943,0.803,0.169,0.027,0.5105812324929971

I especially enjoyed the liquid salad, Quail Mac and Cheese, My substituted scallop dish, the Duck roadkill, and Grapefruit . I think that Moto caters to a crowd of people, who aren't necessarily looking for ""new"" or  ""tasty"" food  but for people who are looking for ""the future"" food ?  and even, ironic food.

We also had every single one of their signature cocktails, and I will say my favorite is the lemon drop. Which had the most magical orb inside of it, it is a must try.

I wonder if that's how happy meals will be dished out in 2041.  The specialty drinks are solid. The chorizo margarita was smokey, strong and garnished with a small sausage. Nothing like some meat to go along with your tequila.  When you strip away that hype, the food is ok at best. I know each ingredient has a novel backstory in the way it was acquired or prepared. But the flavors didn't blow me away. Found both the breakfast creme brulee and beef in the ""fajita x three"" course disappointedly bland.

Let me note as an aside, but one interesting to those who like to balance their checkbooks, that I am not used to paying more than $100, and certainly not more than $300, for a meal for two.  Having said that, you cannot possibly enjoy Moto thoroughly (and you must!) unless you forget about the price tag.  While at some restaurants, you might have to literally hold your nose to do so, at Moto you can more easily be seduced by the incredible gadgetry of the food if nothing else.  Yet I still remember how much it cost, and the ping pong game in my head goes on ... 3 or 4 stars, 3 or 4 stars, the memorable price tag being the only factor tugging me toward the 3. The ping pong game is now over, my head is fine, if wobbly, and I'm going for 4 stars because of the tremendously sweet service in such a potentially intimidatingly mod place, the exquisite presentation of the food matched with a different wine for every course, and the most appealing way I've ever seen my name in print (on an edible menu, of course). I had the smallest meal (but, I'm told, with the largest servings) with, as I mentioned, the wine pairings.  Though I'd like to expand my Moto dish repertoire, I think this is a sensible way to go, at least at first, because, as I heard from those seated next to me, it's a long, long road once you start reaching course seven, eight, nine, and beyond.  Even if you aren't attuned to or try to dismiss the gob stopper magic at first, it catches up with you, so eat slowwwly and enjoy, even if you can afford to eat here every week.  Moto food is art, and, overall, I think would make a seriously sophisticated Willie Wonka very proud.",0.9804,0.851,0.101,0.048,0.5923913043478259
2008-01-30,5.0,"I've been wanting to go to Moto for forever and finally this evening I had my opportunity.  John, Ashley, Audrey, and I decided to brave Moto's science experiment of a menu and take on liquid nitrogen one bite at a time. An Edible Menu is delivered to your table accompanied by Smoked Salmon Caviar, Unfermented Grape Juice Jelly, and a Poached Pear with Vanilla Cream.  The Edible Menu details the three tasting menus Moto offers. Seeing that it is/was a Wednesday night we decided to limp into Moto and order the five course tasting menu w/ wine pairings.  I know what you are thinking.... ""Hike up your skirt and order the 10 or be brave and order the Grand Tasting Menu!""  Regretfully we didn't.  DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU PLAN ON GOING TO MOTO AND WANT TO BE SURPRISED! The firstish course was a Fauxjito.   Moto takes a champagne flute and fills the bottom with mint syrup and then extracts lime juice from a syringe into the glass.  This concoction was delicious and tastes just like a mojito (minus the alcohol).  Our first course was Bacon & Maple, which consisted of a savory creme brulee paired with a bacon shortbread cookie.  Incredible flavors and interesting texture!  This dish was paired with a nice Chablis.  The second dish was the Shutome with Fried Rice, which was centered around a seared piece of Shutome (broadbill swordfish from Hawaii).  The fish was beautiful!  A tofu puree, braised seaweed, and popcorn shoots completed this perfect dish.  Surprisingly, this dish was paired with a Pinot Noir from the Northern Island in New Zealand.  Our third dish was the Crispy Hash Browns & Beef, which was a play on steak and eggs.  The dish was served on a metal Battleship-esque serving tray, with herb scented utensils.   Grilled steak w/ Bacon Puree, Hash Brown w/ Tomatillo Ketchup, and an Egg...........YUM!  Homaru Cantu you sank my Battleship! Wow, that Tempranillo sure is nice.   Our fourth dish was a Pumpkin Tamale with Risotto and Horchata Ice Cream.  You guessed it another winner. Making it even better was the 2005 Chateau Rumieu Lacoste Sauternes they paired it with.  We made nice with our server and he brought us out an additional dessert course.  Our fifth course was Smores.  Moto's Smores consist of a Chocolate Mouse filled with Liquid Graham Crackers that just Gooshed out when you broke into it with your fork (Oh yeah there was toasted marshmallow too).  This dish was perfectly paired with a Zin port.  The sixth and final dish was the Biscotti & Coffee. Sounds simple right? Wrong!  The pastry chef freezes coffee using liquid nitrogen to create the biscotti and then takes the components of the biscotti and turns those into liquid.  So you actually dip your coffee into your biscotti. Delicious!  This was paired with a 1968 Madeira. To make a long story short (TOO LATE!). The food was absolutely amazing! I had extremely high expectations going in and Moto exceeded those.  I was anticipating really cool food, but Homaro Cantu not only delivers the cool, but he also delivers sophisticated dynamic flavor profiles that just plain out taste great. The space is minimal and modern in design.  If you like mid century, modern, smart design you'll enjoy the space.  The service blew me away.  Totally casual, engaging, and not pretentious at all.  When asked where he likes to eat our server responded with ""I really like Hot Dougs.""  What a perfect evening! 4 Five Course Tasting Menus 3 Wine Pairings ---------------------------------- $600 PS...

Tuna sashimi prepared in liquid nitrogen with a spoon shaped biscuit. This bonus course was so tasty. The contrasting textures of the lightly chilled tuna melting in your mouth against the crumbly bits of biscuit just worked. 2. Steak and eggs deconstructed.

Pros: Excellent service with eloquent servers, an unforgettable culinary futuristic experience Cons: Price but that's expected On my first ""real"" visit to Chicago, my friend took me to Moto.  We first walked into Otom (the sister restaurant next door) thinking that the futuristic restaurant spelled its name backwards to deter unsophisticated patrons.  Unfortunately, we were wrong and the hostess kindly directed us next door. I wonder if the confusion is intentionally part of the experience that we were to enter an unknown. Regardless, my friend and I both had the 10 course tasting menu.  I have admit that my palate probably isn't as refined as most people and I was recovering from a cold.  It took some adjustment to grasp the complexities of flavor and felt that the menu should have increased in the wild...a sort of reaching the climax. Nonetheless, I was able to taste the complexities of flavor.  Although liquid nitrogen was used liberally through nearly all plates.  I appreciated the thought put toward the deconstructed sushi (which was surprising in taste at first, but really was a different way of eating sushi), cold beets (normally i don't like beets, but i liked in this form) and the mac and cheese (liquid nitrogen cheese melting with burnt? macroni).  But the first greek salad was surprisingly disappointing.   The second greek salad in a shot glass was the complex dish I had that night.  Taking a shot, I felt a slight extreme bitterness of a greek salad then at the back of my throat a few seconds later, I felt a tang.  Then the aftertaste lasted for several seconds more.  In some way, I almost felt like I went to Charlie's Chocolate Factory and had eaten something...but didn't really consume it. I love sweet dishes and here at Moto, it was probably no exception.  I loved the cotton candies.  The fizzy watermelon.  It was interesting how the way they placed the plate determined the way we choose to ate it.  At other tables, we noticed people got a smaller plate for the same amount of fizzy watermelon and didn't eat the fruit at the same time as the rice cracker. Another thought-provoking dish was the chili cheese nachoes and the chicago hot dog which looked (somewhat) like the real thing, but were simply desserts. Unfortunately, the one dish that really satisfied me was the pork shoulder.  It was sweet and meaty.  In some way, that was the only dish that didn't contain much molecular gastronomy and yet I have never tasted a pork shoulder that good.  It was simple. I liked eating the paper that said ""patent pending"". What added to the experience was how the servers seemed to appear from the dark.  The curtains to the kitchen were black and moving through the curtains, you couldn't see anything behind it.  The kitchen was right next door to the restrooms...and from where I was standing outside the restroom door (apparently people at moto take forever in the restroom), I could hear a lot going on inside the kitchen.  If I could only open that door...

2007-09-14,5.0,"Moto is a experience you will remember. The concept is extremely different; food that you will never have anywhere else. It is the ""marriage of science and food"" (quoted out of Zagat).  You must be prepared to order the 18 course tasting menu in order to completely appreciate the style of foods the chef presents. I can not describe the food as must go to Moto to experience it. It is not for meat and potatoes person and you must be prepared to take a adventure in eating.  They have no competition in Chicago and maybe in most of the USA. The three times I have gone I can tell you at least thirty percent of the guest are in the hospitailty/restaurant industry. The decor is very minimal and the staff all wear suits. Every staff person is cross trained in the dining room and in the kitchen.  If you have seen the movie Gattaca (Uma Thurman & Ethan Hawke); then you might get a slight feel of the atmosphere and staff of Moto. I highly recommend you go with a group of friends and only with people who don't take life to seriously. Valet parking and on street parking is available.

Delectable food, amazing science -- and a sense of childlike wonder, which is a rare experience in these jaded adult days :)  The chef filps and reverses textures -- a pool of fine cheese, crunchy macaroni, fizzy reconstituted melon.  Coconut powder.  An anti grill, powered by liquid nitrogen, in which liquid cooked pancake is squirted on and turned solid and served on a spoon with maple syrup. 10-courses, just like French Laundry, but with more food per course. We left full and delighted. Something that hasn't yet really hit SF dining scene.  It's located in Fulton Market area, which reminds me of the Meatpacking District in NYC.

The dinner continued with more ultra contrived dishes---deconstructed macaroni and cheese, a conceptual pulled pork sandwich with an edible briquette (a freeze dried substance dyed with squid ink), dessert nachos (candied tortilla chips, shredded mango, chocolate that looked like ground beef). The dishes were starting to feel more gimmicky rather than innovative. We weren't sure if it was standard practice at Moto, but servers tended to raise their voices a few octaves higher when describing the molecular gastronomy inspired courses. The circus like experience of Moto was heightened on our kitchen tour where we had to wear goggles to protect our eyes from... lasers? The red disco light in the kitchen?

2007-03-15,4.0,"On December 10th, at 9:10pm, Matt Skonicki and I walked into Moto. Moto is in the meat packing district of Chicago, and is located at 924 Fulton Market. Moto is small. After having our coats checked we were ushered into the dining room. Feeling much like a gay couple, we were seated at a small table. The water was served from individual stoppered glass bottles. The menus were brought. There was a pleasent din in the restraunt at this time. Matt and I pretty much knew we were going to have what is known as the GTM, or Grand Tour Moto. An 18 course, $165 dollar meal. The menu is edible. We ate the with much intrigue. We ordered a bottle of white wine for the meal, a hasty little 2005 vintage that was quite good. Then the courses started. -DUE TO A 5000 WORD LIMIT, I HAVE OMITTED THE COURSE BY COURSE REVIEW.  PM ME FOR IT- The meal was $500 all together. There was no one left in the restraunt when Matt and I left at 1:30am. My final score: 4 stars out of 5. The sense of taste, like all other senses, needs to rest sometimes. Moto hammered it out over all 18 courses with intense flavors. One or two courses with a more smooth and light flavor would have been great, and added just that last half a star. Moto also serves 5 and 10 course meals. I suggest to any to try this place, it's an adventure in fine dining. My final thought: ""There's something to be said about a restaurant where every bite puts a smile on your face.""

2007-02-27,5.0,"Just like with Alinea, you must view the pictures simultaneously with the review to better understand. I won't write a bunch of comments about each, but rather primarily rank the dishes and mention the highlights for each dish. I prioritized the dished by a 1 (dishes I loved), 2 (dishes I thought were good) ,or 3 (dishes that I didn't care for). I had 7 #1s, 8 #2s, and 7 #3s. #15 Tortilla chip menu It's obviously cool that he can print menus that are edible. But one side of the menus was not even legible and the flavors were that of grocery store chips. The sauce lacked depth as well.  #16 Salmon & sesame The idea is great on this one. Using liquid nitrogen to freeze the sesame oil with a salmon tartare. But there was no liquid in the dish to help bring the oil out of it's frozen state so it tasted pasty. #13 Soup & salad Another cool concept, pairing soup in salad in one bowl, both in liquid form. The soup was pizza, a good quality spicy tomato bisque. The salad not as good. Liquefied 'lettuce', anchovy paste, and croutons. I liked the paste.  #10 Acorn with bacon A very interesting dish. On the right was a normal acorn squash soup, but the left was where the dish was at. If I remember correctly, a dehydrated squash and hydrated. It had a funky texture, but I liked this one. #19 Synthetic champagne A syringe releases two ingredients, both of which I can't remember and 3 secret ingredients. I think the effort that went into this dish didn't show in the final product. Nothing special from a taste standpoint. #21 Goat cheese snow Snow? How about shredded goat cheese that was chilled. #2 Hamachi & orange I loved this one. The yellowtail was good, but the thing is you squeeze some of the orange on it. The orange is carbonated, so it's like if Orange Cola had a baby. not sure how this is done, but it's a very cool effect. #3 Miso & grilled tuna One of my favorites for the effects. The miso soup was good. The tuna sat on a grill frozen with liquid nitrogen, so it actually gave the raw tuna 'grill' marks or freezer burn for that matter. I thought the effect was really cool. #18 Pomegranate & caped gooseberry  Nothing special here. I think they call it a palette cleanser or palette yawner. Just pomegranate soup, gooseberry sorbet, and a gooseberry. #6 Caramel apple Another good one for me. A hollowed apple filled with bacon and given the usual caramel apple fixings. The sweetness of both complimented each other. #4 Rabbit & aromatic utensils  The battleship plate. The sage utensils didn't do much for me, but they looked cool. The roasted rabbit and the rabbit confit were delicious and tender. The beans and the rice krispie things were not needed. #14 Jalapeno & cilantro I love creative ice cream, so I like this and the avocado and cream went well with the dish. No need for the grains on the bottom. #9 Al pastor with avocado Duck al pastor, very good dish, avocado popper, spooned with a good mole sauce on the bottom. One of my favs that night. # 20 Orange scented wine glass You take a tour of the kitchen for this dish. A laser gives the flavor of orange into a wine glass. The wine glass is set on your table and served with wine after a few minutes. I tasted wine, not much orange. #22 Chicken-fried mac-n-cheese Rib-eye fried like chicken with white truffles and mac 'n' cheese. By far, the worst dish of the night. Rib-eye did not work fried and the dish was so salty. #1 Lychee rigatoni fruit plate Loved this dish. Flourless, eggless, lychee rigatoni on a marscapone sauce that was was great. #7 Carrot cake planet Carrot cake in three forms, all of which were new to me, hard to describe. I liked this one a lot and it just looked cool #17 3 cotton candy stages Top --- tasted like shredded filo dough with simple syrup. Bottom --- cotton candy edible paper --- cool, except for the copyright. Bottom --- hard candy --- it tasted ok. Nothing special. #12 Flapjacks prepared tableside The pancakes are prepared on a small grill that was frozen in liquid hydrogen and dipped in syrup. I liked the flavor of this one and it was creative. A keeper. #8 Cherry bomb This was cool. A cherry sauce cover chocolate with a cherry stem (play on words), macerated cherries (boring), and cherry cola candy (cool). #5 Doughnut soup & pancake I could drink this everyday. Jack-in-the-box should come out with a doughnut shake. Very cool. #11 Chili-cheese nachos I loved when this one came out. It looked great yet it was a dessert. As for the taste, as Borat would say, "" Not so much."" Sugared chips, kiwis, shredded mango sorbet, lemon marscarpone cream (loved it), and ground milk chocolate. The chef still need to refine his cooking processes and the same ingredients/techniques were presented in too many dishes. But, I think I still need to give it a 5 star as he is doing something that only a handful of chefs are doing or even capable of doing in the US.",0.9995,0.775,0.194,0.03,0.6262390273349175

It's experimental without being over the top.  And, unlike other uber trendy modern places with lackluster white walls and not much of anything else this place pulls off the minimalist decor in perfect style.  It's a perfect accompaniment to their cuisine.  Yes, it's minimalist complete with white walls and all but at least they add flair to it from the bamboo placemats to the touch of greens and neutrals on the walls.  And let's face it, for them it just works I couldn't imagine it being done any other way. The service is unbelievable.  At first it was a bit disconcerting, the staff appeared to be a bunch of 21-25 year olds, hardly what one would expect from a 5-star restaurant.  After discovering they are all trained chefs or currently in training and after listening to their renditions of the individual plates, the wine lists, etc I was impressed.  What a bold, daring move to hire the young ones in training to staff the restaurant.  And being a resident in training myself I can really appreciate this.  I think it's a great move and they seem to have a passion for what they do, combined with a desire to learn more both from their peers as well as from their customers. The food was out of this world.  I took advantage of the 10 course with the wine pairing.  The wine portions were very generous, perhaps even too generous for me but very good.  The food was outstanding, flavorful, exciting and filled with different textures that rolled off the palate beautifully.  This chef has true vision as well as the ability to produce a pleasing product for his customers.  Unlike other modern mediocre high priced places Moto gives you the aesthetic while still delivering on flavor.  The presentation is very pleasing and dramatic as well.
