2011-09-10,3.0,"The reviews on this restaurant read like sad sad comedy.  What the heck is wrong with people in Chicago?  Are you so cowed by snooty resto staffers that you will pay for whatever they put (or fail to put) in front of you???  It's unbelievable that so many people paid so much money to put up with this nonsense.  This is CHICAGO, folks, there's seriously good food around every corner, and in my experience it usually comes without a side of attitude. First of all, if you go to a restaurant for an 'authentic Italian experience' and the staff limits your table time, they FAIL.  Well, ANY restaurant fails if they do that, but in particular a restaurant claiming to present an authentic Italian dining experience.  The pros in Italy would be horrified to hear of this.  And if the place actually gives you the bad news in advance, when you make your reservation, why the heck would you go there at all?!  There's no food in the world worth being treated like a wallet on the hoof by the people serving it to you. Second, the minute the waitstaff starts with attitude is the minute the meal ends and you go elsewhere, or take it up with management.  Any staffer who gives you attitude because you ask for bread (WTF???) or are 'using a corkscrew incorrectly' is in serious need of some basic lessons in how to interact with people, and shouldn't be let out in public, much less be allowed to serve in a restaurant, until he or she gets them. I hope you poor misguided people who described these horrible experiences with waitstaff in need of attitude adjustments weren't fool enough to tip.  (And to be fair, that you explained WHY they were not being tipped - you are not responsible for paying their salaries,  that's taken care of by the management.  You tip to acknowledge good service.  So why would you tip if you were treated poorly?). The truly sad thing is that many of those who described this treatment were actually REPEAT CUSTOMERS.   Good God.  Right.  Why am I writing this?  I came here looking to see what folks have to say about the place, thinking it might be a good choice for a special occasion.  Clearly not.  And since I didn't eat here, why am I  'reviewing?'  Well, I guess this is more of a review of the reviewers than the place (hence the middle of the road 3 star rating - it won't affect the average one way or the other, since they've already got a 3 star average).  But I just couldn't stand to read one more review about the horrible treatment people received here, and in their final sentence...'maybe next time will be better'!!!   From the latest comments here, it looks like maybe their attitude finally caught up with them...both locations closed down and no further info.  (Although even in this circumstance, they appear to have managed to maintain their FAIL by not informing those with standing reservations that they were closed!)",-0.6175,0.787,0.104,0.109,0.47818132902878663

We showed up at 7:20 on a very rainy Sunday night with a reservation for two at 7:30.  Only two or three tables were occupied.  A waiter greeted us at the door and asked if we had a reservation and we gave our name which prompted his response.  ""Oh, you are a bit early"".  I asked if we could be seated anyways and he agreed like he was doing us a favor letting us sit down early in an empty restaurant. When we sat down we first noticed the smell of sewage, something must have been backing up with the heavy rain outside.  Then we noticed were sat directly across from a cleaning closet where they left the curtain open all evening.  We spent our meal staring at a closet full of cleaning supplies and dirty dishes on a bus cart. We ordered the four course menu.  I loved the bread with the salt cod mousse and we like our first course antipasti which was roasted beets, pickled mushrooms, goat cheese and a few other veggies. We made the mistake of asking if the pope's purses pasta could be served without sage in the brown butter sauce and were refused.  No big deal, I understand that the chef has a certain vision and doesn't want to leave out or substitute ingredients. When the pasta came I felt it was over the top and too rich.  It was swimming in oil and butter, way too rich.  We couldn't taste any of the ingredients, just oil and butter.  This was the biggest disappointment food wise. For the main course we ordered brasato del giorno, pork shank braised in white wine.  The meat was good in a Grandma's Pot Roast kind of way.  Again, the waiter talked down to us and explained how they braised the meat in wine and then blended the braising sauce and poured it over the meat.  Actually a really basic  technique, not one worth bragging about. Dessert was amazing; we had an orange mascarpone that was really, really good.

Spinach custard topped with gorgonzola cream sauce and pinenuts - The smooth, airy consistency of the custard amazed me. I have no idea how they made that magic happen.

Our  reservation was for 5:30 and we had a great time with the 4 course meal. Our desert had not arrived yet and we asked our server to open our second bottle of wine.

I pointed out that it was only 7:00 anyway and we hadn't even been served our desert that is included with the meal. She oh so graciously said we could keep the table until 7:30 but then we would have to leave, whether we were finished or not. Our waitress came back and gave a kind of apology. I told her I didn't blame her as I am sure she gets a lot of pressure to turn over the tables. I explained that I live on an extremely tight budget and for me to spend that kind of money for a night out is a huge deal and I don't appreciate being rushed out of my special evening.

I will say that I will go back to this place!  They truly due a fantastic job with the local (fresh) ingredients, and their homemade pasta is absolutely amazing (and I usually HATE pasta)!  Definitely excited to see what the chef can treat me to next time!",0.9963,0.775,0.203,0.022,0.5975675675675675

The gnocchi was a horrible texture, the chicken and trout were bland, the salad was barely dressed and we couldn't find salt or pepper, or our server. We had to ask for water- repeatedly.  We also found out that they have a policy that you must eat in order to partake in the byob- which is understandable.

I appreciate that they're trying to serve higher end Italian food without inflating the prices too high.  There are seemingly infinite Italian places (let's face it, Americans like carbs and tomato sauce), and this one stuck out as offering more interesting options.  The appetizers and pasta dishes were as good as any I've had around town.  They really advertise that the pastas are made in house, but I have to be honest, the freshness of the pasta wasn't really on display.  The texture of truly fresh pasta is pretty unique, and the pastas at Terra Gusto while well sauced lacked that fresh pasta texture.  Still no complaints since the pope hats with caramelized squash were really a memorably good pasta dish, which is pretty tough.  The disappointment came when the pork shoulder arrived.  Sure it was a tender hunk of meat, but it seemed heavy coming at the end of the meal with no vegetables and minimal sauce to balance the meat's richness. I'm still on the hunt for a solid Italian place pumping out great pasta dishes for 10-15 bucks a head, but until then, Terragusto will do.",0.9928,0.692,0.234,0.074,0.5443803418803419

Antipasti Course: I had the cured meats.  They were delicious.  Salty, oily, wonderful.  They also had boar jerky, which was a real treat.   Everyone else loved their appetizers with the exception of the salad, which was a little heavy on the carrots. Pasta: Delicious.  Decadent!  I am salivating now.  I ordered the parpadelle with a truffled ragu sauce.  The parpadelle was fantastic and probably the thinnest parpadelle I have ever had in a restaurant.   The white truffle sauce was definitely truffly, but I love that taste in moderation.    Meat: We had a half a chicken, and there brasato, which turned out to be a pork shank.  Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned again.

Granted I've never had sformata before, but I'll eat anything that taste like garlic! I also had the Gorgonzola gnocchi - and that was amazing. My friends had the ravioli (with a much fancier name) which I did not much care for, nor did they. The other friend had a pasta filled with potatoes which was also pretty tasty.

2010-09-10,5.0,"My parents visited last weekend, and as, you know, the host I wanted to take them to a few of our favorite places.  I gotta admit, we haven't been to Terragusto in a REALLY long time, but I had good (and delicious) memories, so to Terragusto we went for a Saturday night dinner. It's still BYOB, so we brought a red and a white. Ok, first off, thank baby jesus that they converted those stupid window stools into actual tables. Seriously. Those stools were infuriating. I like these new tables much more. Anyway, I wasn't expecting that you had to purchase meals in 'packages'. This is a new change that happened 5 or so months ago. Basically, a table has to decide on a menu format (30 bux a person gets you bread or dessert, an app and a pasta, and 40 bux a person gets you all that and a meat). I mean, I was planning on ordering all that for myself anyway (judge away!), but I was a little blindsided, to be honest.  Anyway, we decided to do the 30 dollar menu with 2 breads and 2 desserts, so we could try a little of each. Breads were fucking outstanding. The olive oil has chili flakes and parm in it, and we had 4 types of homemade bread with it. Don't ask me to recall the specific types of bread, because I can't, but I assure you they were all good. The appetizers were good, as well. I got the sformato, which is a vegetable custard. This one had zucchini and roasted red peppers with a balsamic vinegar sauce. A 'dirty bathwater' sauce, as the waiter called it. Super dreamy. Loved it. I always love the sformatos though, so I'm easy.  My husband and dad got heirloom tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinegar/olive oil and topped with Gorgonzola cheese. Those are some seriously good tomatoes, for real. My mom got the tomato soup with bread, which she thought was just ok.  For main courses, my husband and I got the gnocchi in a taglio (I think, my memory is fuzzy) cheese sauce and spinach. OMFG. SUPER rich, but really, really good. My mom got a thinner pasta baked with vegetables and my dad got meat stuffed pasta. Everyone was very happy with their pastas, and I think when meals are made with fresh pasta it's really a testament to how good fresh pastas can be. Seriously. For our first dessert we got a marscapone crepe with plums and a fluffy, sweet sauce on the side. This dessert was just ok, in my opinion. The marscapone with the crepe was just kind of dense and it needed more salt, I think. The plums weren't sweet enough to balance out the savory crepe and marscapone,. Oh well.  Anyway, the star of the show was the honey panna cotta with a melon mint salad on top. It was FUCKING AWESOME. It's the best dessert I've ever had, and I'm not much of a dessert person. It knocked my socks off. The panna cotta was sweet and creamy, but had a very mellow flavor. The melons offered a cool, slightly bitter sweetness and the mint really gave it a nice finish. Service was great, ambiance was great. No complaints here. Another fine meal at Terragusto. I was still full the next morning from this extravaganza, but holy shit, it was just so good.

I'd never heard of this restaurant prior to June of this year--although a few of my friends on yelp I now see have also been there.  My aunt recommended it for a special birthday dinner for my mom. I went. I enjoyed. I approved for second visit.  Second visit was just as unbelievable as the first.  The pasta here is very good! You will notice a lot of people commenting about the homemade, fresh taste. And for good reason. It is very apparent the ingredients used here are top knotch. Try the gnocci; it's unreal.  The set-up in here can probably accomodate 30-40 people max--so not the largest place. I hate to take off a half star because of the closeness of tables, but I just kind of half to. But I guess that also make it intimate, and the off-the-beaten-pathness (yes, I just made this up, but sounds appropriate) make it a special occassion type of place that will stand out in memory banks.  Thus, I remembered Terragusto when pondering  a special place to take a fine lady out on the town. Unique restaurants(with superb food), that come to mind when you need to pull out an ace to win, you dont forget. This is one of them.  Service is also great, prices are reasonable (roughly 30 per person) and who doesnt enjoy BYOB? I relucantly must also deduct a half star for the dessert menu.

2010-08-08,2.0,"All I can say is that place is just a bunch of PR and lots of hype... and these guys must have REALLY used a professional, because, ugh, it was just so disappointing!  The PR on this place is insane. Everyone I know cannot stop talking about how great it is... How the chef is so talented... How the local sourcing is so innovative... How the market sells out of the fresh pastas by 2 pm most days... And... Look at us: we are so cool that we drink wine out of juice glasses (ugh, that's just so... 2001)... Blah blah blah...  The hype started with the table next to us. The mother in the group wouldn't shut up about the braised pork, waygu beef or the vegetable custard. She loved it so much you'd think her daughter was the executive chef and had invented a new method of cooking or something... So upon her overly aggressive suggestion, we eagerly ordered the waygu beef, custards, gnocchi, breads and antipasto platters that were so enthusiastically raved about. Course 1 arrived and I stared at the plate of jiggly custard covered in pesto and across at the plate of a couple of different cold salads that could have been easily recreated by the $10/hour staff at Whole Foods. Hmm. The custard: weird and gelatinous. Not really the satisfying texture I was looking for.  On to the other courses. The waiter almost passed out when I ordered the gnocchi, saying that it's so amazing that it just melts in your mouth... he was so aggressive about the damn gnocchi you'd think that I had just propositioned a rendezvous in the bathroom with it! I think the word ""ethereal"" was used to describe the pasta, but I'm not sure because I was drinking... and thank goodness! The BYOB wine was the best part! Our pasta dishes finally arrived after a long lull in service, but the waygu beef was nowhere to be seen! The missing beef was certainly a strange topic of conversation while we were eating our less than stellar pasta dishes. Was it supposed to be served as dessert?  Once the phantom meat finally arrived, about 5 minutes after our pasta dishes were cleared from the table, we were beyond full with the carb fest of the earlier courses. It was a strange feeling to be eating strips of medium rare beef with nothing else... almost like eating beef jerky... a complete afterthought.  All in all, my opinion is that this place hired a really great PR person and hyped it to every wannabe foodie in Chicago. Don't get me wrong... I think that the IDEA is great. I like fresh produce and free range meats... and even occasionally drinking wine out of juice glasses... but It's the execution where this restaurant fails.",0.9875,0.815,0.12,0.064,0.5509652076318742

We were a party of 10 and were charged $52 per person, yet some of us left hungry. The portions were small as we had to ration two bites each. Where in Italy does that ever happen? We had an eleventh person join us (a friend's wife who dropped by 30 minutes before we were leaving) and they wouldn't let her have a glass of the wine that her and her husband brought. She was forced to sit there like a schoolgirl and watch everyone drink vino. To be sure - that's not Italian! We even agreed to order her food off of the menu, so she could have a glass of wine with us, but they wouldn't allow it. The one redeeming quality is that the service, though not at all accommodating, was quick and we rarely had to wait for anything.

Taken off guard, I replied ""Do you mean do we have a reservation? No."" Strike one. We were then sat by a waiter who, before we could even get our cheeks on the seats, told us that we were only able to have the table for two hours because they ""just get so slammed."" Umm, thanks for letting us sit here? I mean, we weren't planning on staying all night, but is that really necessary?? Strike two. He asked, with a condescending tone, if we'd been there before, which we hadn't. He explained the menu, which is pre-fixe. Yes, I know what that means, to the point where a four year old would have been like DUDE I GOT IT! We're civilized people who have eaten outside of a McDonald's before. No need for the painstaking detail. Strike two.5. So each round of food came and it was delicious. The condescending waiter was fairly attentive, but my mom noticed at a couple points that he appeared to be talking about us. Who knows what he was saying, but we were already both pretty uncomfortable from the less-than-welcoming experience so it was the last half-strike needed to make me not want to return.

Personally, for my selections, I chose the plate of sliced meats, tortelli and for the shared meat courses we had the waygu beef and braised pork. I'm a sucker for any sliced meat plate and Terragusto's didn't disappoint. Two of my dining friends ordered the insalata and raved that it ""tasted like a salad in Italy"" - obviously making me wish I had followed their lead.  Of the sliced meats, each was unique in its own way, and if I had to pick a favorite I would probably choose the lamb sausage. Not being a huge fan of pesto, I was a little concerned with the amount that would be found on the plate before my tortelli arrived.  The creamy pesto sauce was a simple addition to the smooth pasta filled with light potatoes. Finally, our shared waygu beef and braised pork both received rave reviews from our friendly and attentive server, Joey, and were spot on with his assessment and explanation. As we discussed at dinner, the pork had a spare rib quality to it and fell off the bone at the slightest touch of the fork.  The beef was a light medium rare and had a flavorful crust. I think the most important thing we came to agree upon, was that at the end of the night we were completely satisfied and full, but not to the point of being uncomfortable that can often happen.

There were so many courses coming out that I lost track of everything, but I do remember a charcuterie plate to start things off great. The meats were cut nice and thin, so needless to say, I started hogging it all up.  They also gave us the gnocchi which was awesome. It had this great gorgonzola sauce on it to where I was trying to get the last bit of cheese with my bread and the shrimp that was with it to didn't last all too long either.  We then were served a pasta dish and a whole fish dish. The pasta was really good, but I forget what else was with it. The whole fish was pretty good, but was a bit on the dry side, it was the only semi-disappointment of the evening. We finished up with the desserts and had a cheese plate as well as panna cotta. The cheeses were parmesan reggiano and I forget the other. They were good to nibble on, but the panna cotta was damn tasty. Yet another thing that was gobbled up real fast by me. All of this worked perfectly with the wines we were drinking. The staff was great and we made sure to send some bottles back so that they could drink them later.

But I am sorry, I can buy high quality beef and simply pan fry it with olive oil, S&P too, and it won't turn out chewy and tough. I wish they were as interested in doing some real cooking with their meat courses as they are with their pastas- which are homemade and interesting (ie: duck ragu), or their polenta (great rich taste, crust, and usuallly accompanied by a delicious sauce), or their sformata (oh yes, that's the stuff).

A few things to know about Terra Gusto: This is not a chain restaurant; nor is it a diner.  In Italy, it is an insult to the chef to ask for menu substitutions.  Don't do it here.  The staff isn't rude about it but, as a fellow diner, I'll tell it like it is:  if you want an American Italian restaurant, this isn't the place for you. If you want a true, authentic, gourmet Italian culinary experience, I have one word about Terra Gusto for you:  Foodgasm. Come hungry and be prepared to take your time.  You'll need it.  Don't just snarf down your food.  Experience it and savour it.  My companion and I let the chef select our menu and we said the same thing after each selection was sampled:  ""no, THIS one's my favourite!""  I never could decide which dish I liked best but my companion swore the Japanese beef was the best he'd ever had.

2010-04-27,2.0,"I was extremely disappointed in this place.  BYOBs that are not of Asian influence are difficult to come by in this city, so when I discovered this place I just had to try it.   The menu is seasonal, which I can appreciate.  The bread and pasta are made daily on site (hence the 2 stars), and all the produce and proteins are derived from local sources.  However, just because things are fresh does not mean they are inherently tasty.   The menu is prix fixe, and your party gets to choose between a two course meal and dessert to share, or a three course meal in which you choose the first two and your table splits the third (a meat) and two desserts.  I can appreciate this (sort of), but more often than not people do not agree on what to order.  This happened to be the case when I dined here. While it is not the restaurant's fault that the three of us do not share the same taste, there was nothing they would do to accommodate this dissemblance of our flava flaves.  Instead, we had to ""ro sham bo"" to see  who would go without the third course. Turns out that person was lucky to have their scissors crushed by a rock so they did not have to consume the final course.   After a disappointing round of starters for all of us (appetizers and pastas, all under/over-seasoned and...just bad), the final dish arrived.  A whole Orata on the ""bone"".  An ""Orata"" is apparently a fish with an overwhelming ""fishy"" flavor that dominates regardless of the quantity/quality of spices.  I love fish, but this F***ing sucked.  The singled-handed best part about this dish was the photo-op at the end in which I took pictures of it's head with a jury rigged ""ball gag"" (an olive and a piece of spaghetti) to make it look like an S & M participant.  Freakish you say?  Well, so was this damn fish.   Dessert was OK.  We got a vanilla honey panna cotta and a trifecta of gelatos.  Nothing orgasmic, which is why people eat desserts correct?

2010-03-22,4.0,"Terragusto is BYOB, which may strike you as a money saving feature - it's not - dinner for 2 is $75. You have to order from the three prix fix options, a light meal around $28, the standard for $38 or chef's selection for $45/person. You each order a small appetizer, a reasonable pasta, you share a meat and you share a dessert. I don't mind prix fix - but having to agree on a meat with someone can be a challenge. Since I would not normally order this many courses, Terragusto ends up costing a little less than other Italian restaurants when you order a $30 bottle.  The food was good. Appetizers were uninspired. They claim the pastas are hand made - if this is true, they must be striving to make them in a mass produced style. I couldn't tell the difference from boxed, and I make my own at home. The pork shank was pretty salty, which is probably authentic. Dessert was great, as was service.  All in all, Terragusto was enjoyable - but I'm knocking it down for the menu style which I considered to be limiting.

We made early reservations and walked in to an empty restaurant but were seated in the worst possible table. So when asked to move our waitress said no but the bartender said yes. (by the way, others were sat in this table after us and asked to move, so it wasn't just us) We were then sat at a very nice table but unfortunately had the rudest waitress who proceeded to cut my mother off as she asked a question about the menu and there began the extremely condescending attitude. I was so shocked I almost got up and confronted her, but didn't want to make a scene. Her demeanor was cold but she warmed up to us when she realized how upset I was. As the night went on, we listened to how she treated our neighboring table and she was pleasant and friendly with them. So watch out people you might get Sybil if you dine here.  It was my fault I didn't realize that the menu was not ale carte. As a table you have to decide on a meal plan. It was not what I wanted as it leaves you no flexibility but went with it. The food was good but definitely did not wow me.  Living in Chicago, you have a pick of so many restaurants why would you go to be abused for adequate food.

2010-02-21,5.0,"Terragusto, me gusta!!! Dined here for my birthday a couple of months ago and was I pleasantly surprised.  There were 4 of us and since we all wanted to get a taste of everything, we all decided to just order the chef's special, in which the chef decides your 5 courses.  So just make sure you tell your waiter if you have any allergies or things you can't eat for any reason so the chef can determine which entrees to make.  Oh, forgot to mention that all the dishes are based on what was picked fresh from the market that day....so definitely deliciously fresh! Ok, so we started off with a fresh organic salad as an appetizer, followed by a mushroom quiche with a cream sauce served on top of spinach as our first course.  The mushroom quiche was heavenly, it was cooked to perfection!  The next course was the butternut squash ravioli which was sweet and the pasta was al dente.  Afterwards, another pasta dish was served, followed by the roasted chicken and brussels sprouts.  Omg, that roasted chicken was juicy, perfectly spiced, and delicious and the asparagus was a perfect complement to the chicken!  The last entree was the steak with potatoes and that was yummy.  It was tender, juicy, and amazing; cooked just right. For dessert, you normally would get two dishes, but since my boyfriend and friends brought in cake, we were given a larger serving of one dessert, their white chocolate mousse.  The mousse was light, fluffy, and wasn't too overpoweringly sweet.  A perfect complement to the ice cream cake that I received for my birthday.  :) The service was awesome.  The server was very attentive and knew the menu inside and out.  The decor was very romantic, exposed brick all around, dimly lit perfect setting for a candle-lit dinner.  It is quite a small restaurant, only a handful of tables, so make sure you make reservations well in advance as i'm sure they get packed fairly quickly, specially on weekends. Overall, I had a great experience, enjoyed the surprise entrees strategically chosen by the chef to ensure the perfect dining experience, wonderful attentive service, and impeccable dessert. One word of advice though, make sure you keep an open mind if you are doing the chef's special as you have no control as to how the main entrees will be prepared.  On the other hand, its great since you get to taste something that you wouldn't normally order, and you might actually discover your new favorite dish!

2010-01-26,4.0,"This review is almost a half year late in coming.  I have extensive notes saved on my Crackberry, though.  So, please, don't worry your pretty little head about getting some vague ramblings from moi.  You're not going to get them. :-P So, here's the low down: A BYOB restaurant known for its handmade Italian pastas.  Incredible service experience.  Very accommodating to larger parties. I made reservations for a group of 8 for a Friday night to celebrate my sister being named chief resident of her program.  (I have a smartypants for a sister, and she knows how to get things done!  Congratulations, MB, on your brilliant accomplishment).   I'll preface this by saying:  Our entire party was late arriving for our reservations.  I wish I could say we were just 10 minutes late, but getting that many physicians away from the hospital on time is a hopeless endeavor.  Add to that a drama and thunder-filled summer rainstorm, and you have the makings for a traffic disaster.  Luckily, we were able to utilize the services of the valet next door and had everyone seated and enjoying wine from the many bottles we brought with. Terragusto was amazing about accommodating our delayed party, once everyone arrived.  We were waited on by Chris, who was approachable, sparky, and very well versed in the menu.  We decided on the $39 chef's menu. We started out with a selection of the crostini for apps.  Our choices included wild mushroom; roasted lentil and Tuscan bean.  Although the Tuscan bean topping could have benefited from some extra seasoning, the other crostini won raves across the board.   Next, we were served:      - Pan fried trout in butter- the fish was cooked to perfection.  But, unlike the bland Tuscan bean crostini topping, was seasoned with a much too generous hand.  More than one person remarked over the saltiness of the fish.        - Mushroom papardelle - loved the pasta, but the sauce was bland.  We did, however, love the variety of tasty mushrooms.       -  Polenta with wilted spinach - out of this world amazing.  We fought over the last pieces.      - Chicken dish?  Loves it! Roasted.  Moist. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Our dining companions still mention the chicken we were served. We received a selection of desserts to share. The plate included some heavier options as well as some light and refreshing ones.  All oustanding and delicious! We did have one small complaint.  Our party was seated next to the open kitchen.  Even after stripping off our outer layers, we couldn't handle the heat in the restaurant.  The back of my silk camisole was soaked halfway through dinner.  We asked for extra napkins to mop up the precipitation, but that did nothing to staunch the beads of sweat on our faces.   So, if you're heading to Terragusto in the summer or are seated near the kitchen, prepare to suffer looking like you had stepped in the path of sprinklers somewhere between your table and the front door.  Personally, I'm willing to take looking like a drowned rat if I get to sample more of the creamy polenta, wilted spinach, and roast chicken.",0.9976,0.763,0.182,0.055,0.5241919191919191

The place started with five stars; the woman on the phone with whom I made a reservation was extremely nice and accommodating. A small detail to some, perhaps, but a very telling one.  As we knew we would, we were seated at the front pasta table overlooking Roscoe. I thought I'd be freezing since we were right next to the door and it's December, but it actually was cozy. My only complaint was the dreadful woman in a group of 3 that we shared the pasta table with. She was loud and domineering and a snooze of a dinner date! I pity the fools who had to eat with her. But on to more important things...  The best part about dinner was the salad we ordered. Beautifully presented, deliciously and modestly dressed, with salty, savory, fresh Parmesan shavings on top-- yummers! We also ordered the polenta and brussel sprouts. Perfect portion size, deliciously browned Brussels sprouts. Very, very good. I would highly recommend sharing one with a dinner date.  Finally, the supposed pinnacle of the meal: the pasta. As a non-mushroom eating vegetarian, I was pretty much limited to 2 choices - the gnocchi or the ""pope's hat"" cavalatti (or something like that). I chose the latter. It was pretty darn good and my husband wanted to take a tongue-bath in it. A little too rich and sweet for me to go absolutely pig-face on it -- but still pretty decent.  The meal was finished with coffee and pistachio gelatto. Both so good that they finished in third place (after the salad and polenta, respectively) for best courses of the meal. Oddly, this left the pasta finishing last. Hmm.  My final comment is more a personal annoyance. They had bread and dipping oil listed as a starter. Yum. Except it was $8.50. $8.50?!?! For bread and oil....I was definitely turned off by that. $3 or $5 - fine...but $8.50 seems absurd.",0.9975,0.715,0.228,0.057,0.5776460017969454

But upon dining there I was faced with a cold, hard reality: it's just not that great.  Maybe they were better before? I don't really know, but I took one of my very best friends to Terragusto while she was in town. It was just the two of us girls. I made a reservation. We were celebrating her recent engagement. All those things combined made us incredibly happy, and we were really looking forward to a fabulous dinner.  Instead we felt that the 4-course option was pushed on us too hard, the atmosphere was unpleasant, and the food we did get wasn't that great.  I'm not an incredibly picky eater, but one thing I HATE is over-salting. Seriously. My pasta was like a giant pile of salt.

The thing that really bothered me was the experience though. I'm fine with restaurants (especially small ones) being loud. I understand the acoustics in a tiny box of a building are not ideal. That's fine. But I do prefer not to have paths so narrow that every time a waiter goes by he's bumping my chair even though I've scooted in to the point where my stomach is against the table. The decor in this place also sucks. And I know that sounds harsh and bitchy...but really it looks like they got half way through and gave up.

I had done this once before with a different group and really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, and of course the BYOB factor, but this time I was a bit disappointed. Maybe I oversold the place from my first positive experience because I do think my friends questioned my judgment in the end.  i was seriously ready to give this place 5 stars! A group of that size must do the tasting menu, and we opted for the ""cheaper"" one - $39/person. The first course was the antipasti and they started us with some pate on toast. Not impressive. Secondly, the vegetable custard and a salad. They were both very good. That's when they started to pick up steam...literally. I have never had so much food thrown at a table at once. I mean, the second they served the pasta dishes, they were ready to take them back and move on to the main course. One of my friends hadn't even dished any out yet! We told them they had to slow down. My understanding was that we had 2 hours for the table, and at this point (3 courses in), we'd only been there 35 minutes. The pasta was definitely the star of the show, as it was last time I was there, but I was disappointed not to get the black pasta ""rags"" with the scallops. That one was so good last time! We did have a lovely pumpkin ravioli of sorts and an excellent bolognese though. The gnocchi with scallops was a little too mushy and there weren't very many scallops. The main course was a pork shank and the chicken. The chicken just had too much skin and grease, but was cooked very nicely. The pork shank was good, but almost too similar to the chicken in flavor. Lastly came dessert. All three desserts were wonderful - mascarpone mousse, honey panna cotta, and something I can't remember.  I'm going to give this place 4 stars because the food really is good - you can't beat homemade pasta. However, we were finished with our meal after 1 hour and 15 minutes and none of the couples had finished our bottles of wine because we were so rushed. I realize we were a big, obnoxious crowd, but when you're paying $60/person with tax and tip (yeah, I was a little surprised when we got the bill too) for BYOB, I want to be able to enjoy myself. Another piece of advice for Terragusto, don't start with the cod pate on a piece of bread.

He motioned to a high-top table facing the street, saying, Yeah, you are over there.  It was the type of table you'd sit at to watch passersby at Panera. I asked him if we could have a ""normal"" table and he recoiled saying, no, those were booked for 8PM and there was no way they could cook for us that fast.

2009-10-28,5.0,"1 great restaurant. 2 yummy desserts 3 happy ladies 4 delicious courses 5 stars on yelp! Our mission: to treat a friend to a delicious birthday dinner. We got the 4 course meal, and since the menu changes so often, I won't name everything but describe the good stuff. Appetizers: veggie custard.  It looked just like flan but made of veggies, and it was GOOD.  I was quite surprised.  The thought of it kind of upset me, but that ended as quickly as I could taste the genius of the dish. The other two appetizers were also delicious. Pasta:  Lasagnette with shrimp and scallops.  The best pasta dish I have had, EVER.  The noodles were so good (squid ink noodles?), I can't even begin to describe.  They were black and slimy but oh-so-delicious.  The sauce made everything even more delicious. Squash and brown sugar popes hats-  Also very good.  It was a little too dessert-y for me, i.e. sweet enough for dessert, despite being a main dish.  Still delicious. Gnocci.  Good.  Really nice mix of stuff.  Gnocci was mushy, I tend to like it a little more chewey.  The mushrooms were delicious. Meat:  We had fish.  I can't remember the kind of fish we had but it was melt in your mouth delicious.  It was a kind of white fish.  It came off the bone so easily and the skin was delicious too!  Dessert:  They gave us a mocha mouse but 2 of us don't like coffee.. so they also brought a flourless chocolate cake with a creme fresh.  Delicious. I can't wait to go back.  Too bad it kinda breaks the bank :( uuumm.... did i mention it was delicious?",0.9986,0.645,0.32,0.036,0.7082478632478632

Apps: We were told we had to wait 15 minutes bc they werent ready yet...which is odd bc they open at 5pm so they had plenty of time to prepare before the first diners, but it wasnt that big a of a deal. We had the polenta which was good, kind of bland but polenta usually is, and the lamb sausage was excellent. We also had the sfrato (sp?) which is like a veggie custard. The flavors were good but the texture wasnt that appealing to me. Think vegetable jello. Pasta: I had the black rag pasta w/shrimp and scallops which was great! Very garlicky in a white wine sauce, yum! My friend had the parpadelle which wasnt so good. Kinf of plain and boring, but she liked it.  Meat: We had the pork shank. They bring you a huge baking dish with a giant shank and roasted veggies. The meat falls off the bone and the flavors are great.  Dessert: We had the flourless chocolate cake which was a snooze. I was expecting something dense..this was too cakey and didnt have great flavor. Id skip it and try something else.  There was plenty of food, we took leftovers for lunch..and overall its a good value. Evrything came out piping hot and fresh. My only complaints were that it was waaaay too dark in there and chilly.

2009-09-15,3.0,"3 1/2 stars anyone? I'm a bit perplexed about how I feel about Terragusto. We went there on a Sat night for a table of 4 and brought plenty of wine to share as it is one of our great pleasures in life.  I think just like many of the reviewers, I wanted desperately to like Terragusto's after hearing all about the fresh pasta they make daily, etc, etc, etc. I was excited to try this place, but I think they fell just a bit flat. I do like that they serve traditional Italian style dinner with the pasta first and meats after. Since there were 4 of us, we got 4 different pastas and shared them all. I think the gnocchi was our favorite dish as it was devoured first by the table; the texture was soft like how a gnocchi should be and just melted in your mouth! I think my favorite was the lasagnette neri con gamberi & cappesante which is their black pasta with bay scallops and shrimp (I just loved the seafood flavor). Don't let the black pasta intimidate you! For our meat course we got the whole fish and the sliced beef. I think most people aren't  served regularly with a whole fish on the bones and I think my dinner companions had a harder time eating it. I volunteered to crave the fish for the table as I grew up eating fish served whole. The texture of the fish was a little mushy, I wish they had put a sear on the skin to be crispy. The beef on the other hand was melt in your mouth good!  For desert we got the panna cotta and flourless chocolate cake. The panna cotta was interesting... I don't really care for bit of basil running throughout the desert and no one else at the table cared for it either. Needless to say, we picked off all the fruit on top and left most of it. The flourless chocolate cake was yummy and a great way to finish any meal!  Overall, there were some highlights and low points in the meal. And maybe I didn't give them a fair assessment as I was also kind of sick and that may have decreased my ability to fully taste the food. I will definitely give them any try!",0.9941,0.78,0.169,0.051,0.5099380777952206

Everything was very tasty, I have no real complaints about the quality of the food.  But I also wasn't blown away by anything either.  I tend to look forward to these fixed price menus as an opportunity to try some unusual dishes that I normally wouldn't be bold enough to order on their own.  But nothing that I ate was particularly unusual or adventurous at all. The Wagyu beef was by far my favorite thing on the menu.  Don't get me wrong, everything was good, but for $45 I guess I was expecting something more.

I WANT to love Terragusto.  And I mean, I do think it's one of the better places to eat some pasta in Chicago, but I feel that they are capable of so much more.  I had the Pasta with meat ragu and it was a YAWN.  I ate half of it and then meh'd my fork back down to the table.  It was our 3rd time here, and seeing that we live so close, it's BYOB, and it's generally pretty good (and the portions are spot on), I don't think we'll STOP going, but i'd like to try and find somewhere that pays a little more attention to what they're doing.  We sat for 20 minutes before someone came over (granted the server then did surprise us with on-the-house panna cotta - weee! It was like eating a wonderful little cherry covered cloud) I can say that since we called the same day and didn't get reservations until 9:30pm, the place was much quieter than usual, which I was WAY ok with.   Before I end this so-so post, I do want to comment on the Polenta.  I ordered it because I knew the ingredients were as fresh as can be (polenta covered with egglant and tomato) after seeing what was offered at Green City Market earlier in the day, and I was right.  It.was.awesome.  The best thing we had.  I'd say anytime you can get something with in-season veggies at terragusto, go for it, you can't go wrong.   All-in-all, we'll go back, but it just doesn't seem like this place is trying as hard as it needs to, which is disappointing.",0.9924,0.791,0.179,0.03,0.45156677613574164

Yes, the space is small.  But so what?  For food this good, I'll make the sacrifice.  The polenta alone is rich and buttery enough to drag me back and if I have to sit on a bar stool by myself, I'd do it to devour some more of it.   The pasta is amazing and served the right way.  No, you will not get spagetti and meatballs.  If you want that, go find some fake American-Italian place.  This isn't that kind of place. What you will get, though, is fresh seasonal ingredients prepared to perfection. Meat and fish will not disappoint, either.  The trout we had was awesome and the roast chicken that we had had skin so crispy and meat so moist that people still rave about it.  Great stuff.

Well - Terragusto could be the Sistine Chapel of Italian food in Chicago.  Hellllll-oooo heavenly skies!! But even in paradise you have to be reminded of the imperfections of the world. The name of the trouble-maker this time: service. Too bad to just dismiss it. So let's get down to it, shall we? Terragusto pushes the perfection to its extreme limits....you see ladies and gentlemen - this is a BYOB establishment. Yes. WAY. So of course we come with our wonderful bottle in tow. A nice Bordeaux St Emilion. Yum-yum!! Our waitress had a really hard time to pull up the cork and when she did.......wine was all over. The tablecloth, the menu - that she quickly wiped off. And Reuben's shirt. Didn't acknowledge the fact. That was just the beginning of a very 'spotty' service. Knowing that she had messed up she no longer cared about us.......... Minus 1 star. But OH BOY - the content of our plates more than made up for it!! When in doubt - go for Italian. Simple, rustic, fresh and strong values. Throw organic ingredients in the battle and you have a winner. After a few disappointments on the ""New American"" side of the restaurants spectrum I decided to trust the mighty pasta. Saucy carbs never fail to make my tummy happy. Once again, they didn't. - Warm savory ""sformato"" or silky warm vegetable custard topped with fontina fonduta. Melt in your mouth. Accompanied that time with roasted fennel. - Sweetbreads salad: even better than I remembered from back in the days. Perfectly cooked, slightly crispy on the outside, richness balanced by tangy greens and salty capers. Absolute contentment. - Crostini : smoked trout, pesto and fresh mozzarella, herbed roasted mushrooms with parmigiano. Buenissimo. The pastas...........hand-crafted. Bouncy. Deliciously prepared. Think along the lines of creamy cheesy sauce, brussels sprouts leaves, zucchini and lettuce. Little pillow-y clouds that would be called gnocchi down in this world. Juicy and plump shrimp. Tagliatelle or ribbons of ecstasy. Just perfection. I cannot imagine a better place to satisfy the Italian nostalgia that strikes me every so often.

It was kind of like a fennel panna cotta surrounded in a fontina cheese sauce and topped with roasted fennel. It was light but rich at the same time - a perfect first course! Proccuito salad: This was simple but tasty. Thin slices of prosciutto di parma were topped with arugula and parmigiano and drizzled with olive oil.  Pasta Course: Maltagliate in sugo d'anitra: This homemade parpadelle-like pasta was tossed with braised duck and topped with parmesan. You can't go wrong with that combination; it was delicious. Gnocchi di semola con gamberi e cavoletti: The gnocchi was tossed with shrimp and brussel sprout leaves. It was surprisingly not saucy, but the gnocchi was immensely flavorful. This was definitely another winner of the night! Main Course: Braised lamb shank: I always forget how much I love a good lamb shank. There was nothing particularly different about this one, but the meat was falling off the bone and had amazing flavor.  Dessert: Fruit tart: My only gripe about this was that the tart shell was impossible to cut without it crumbling everywhere. The fresh berries inside of it made for a light and refreshing dessert though. I will definitely come back to Terragusto. My only major complaint really was that the restaurant was very loud.

2009-05-05,5.0,"Oh yes, folks, this is my 500th review.  Just wanted to put that out there. Ahhh, Terragusto.  It's taken me awhile to really wrap my head around the experience that we had here.  The entire dinner was excellent from start to finish.  I made reservations about two weeks in advance for my boyfriend's Wednesday night birthday.  I highly recommend reservations as their spaces fill fast, so make them in advance.  When I made the reservation, the manager made sure to remind me that the restaurant is BOYB - I like that kind of reminder!   Upon arrival, my boyfriend and I were very surprised about the decor of the restaurant.  The ceilings are very high and everything is sleek and modern.  I was expecting something a bit more cozy and romantic but I think the look worked out for the restaurant.  The tables are close together, especially back toward the kitchen.  I will say we were both a bit disappointed with the fact that the restaurant was loud.  Louder than we wanted it to be, especially since we were on a nice date.  There was just a lot of general din created by the patrons.  However, it didn't ruin our mood and it got quieter the later it got.   The service was impeccable!  Our server knew the menu, made great recommendations and was present at exactly the right moments.  He was super nice and really, really friendly.  I enjoy a server that knows the menu and exactly what to recommend.   Ahh... and the food!  Amazing!  Brilliant!  Delicious!  We both decided to get the tasting menu for $37.50/person and it was definitely worth it.  I began my meal with the Baked Polenta and I highly recommend.  The sauce was savory with just the right amount of cheese.  The spinach added just the right flavor touch.  I proceeded to the Gnocchi made from semolina instead of potatoes and it was light and delicious.  The sauce was light (not heavy cheese) with just the right amount of Gorgonzola and the shrimp added a nice touch.  My boyfriend started with the Mixed Salad and said it was very fresh and delicious.  He proceeded to the Ravioli and said it was amazing.  I tried a bit and the cheese was excellent.  There was seriously tons of cheese stuffed in to each ravioli and it was pure cheese heaven. We split the beef steak and it was yummy.  Note that ordering any meat other than chicken will add an extra, one-time charge to your bill (in our case it was $12 extra) but it was worth it.  Most of the steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection but some pieces were erring on the side of well done and it wasn't as good as the rest.  In any case, it was still delicious and worth ordering.   We ended the meal with the flourless chocolate cake, which is really just like a giant brownie.  Served with nice whipping cream on top it was the perfect end to the meal.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it (he loves chocolate way more than me) and I bet would order it again.  I was happy with the dollop of whipped cream on top but would probably order something else in the future. All in all, an excellent foodie experience.  Terragusto is BYOB and that is awesome.  I love BYO and all that it entails.  $2 ""recycling"" fee is attached to each bottle that you open, FYI.  Everything in the restaurant is made in house and it's fresh and organic.  I love the care that the staff put in to everything they did because that care is evident in the food.  I'll be back to sample more of their tasty homemade pastas.  Make sure you make reservations - it gets full fast and the wait is long.",0.9996,0.721,0.267,0.012,0.6037922957801007

2009-04-25,5.0,"All I can say is WOW.  I've had this place bookmarked for some time, have called a few times and not been able to get in, was put on the wait list for yesterday evening, and then at 3:00 pm I got the call that we were ""in"" for 8:15.  So the anticipation was heavy. The dining area is tiny, and very ""cafe""-like.  No white tablecloths, just rustic looking wood tables and exposed brick walls.  No pretension either -- it's all about the food here. And I can see why.  I will be thinking about this meal for a long, long time to come.  In fact, it's 10:30 am and I'm thinking about breaking out my little bit of leftover bolognese al forno - that little hint of truffle oil just sets me right over the edge.  The preparation is obviously done with great care and great thought is put into every ingredient that enters the kitchen at Terragusto.  It has now entered one of my top 5 Chicago restaurants.  I can't wait to go back. The fiance and I went with a couple of our friends and we all had the chef's tasting menu.  For 37.50 a person, this is a TON of food.  Keep in mind that there is an upcharge for nearly all the meats, which will bump that price up a bit, but we still got out for about $60 a person including tip.  Trust me, it is worth every penny.  The best way to do it is for every person in your group to order a different dish and pass those plates!  My favorites were the sformato (again with the truffle oil, I think I might eat anything that is drizzled in the stuff); the gnocchi, which was surprisingly light and delicious with the shrimp and veggies, the bolognese of course, and the mezzaluna.  Between the four of us, we got to try nearly everything on the menu, and I would happily eat any of those dishes again.  The only slight disappointment was the beef, which was a bit chewy.  It wasn't overcooked, I just don't think it was the greatest cut of meat.  The trout, on the other hand, was fantastic.  There's something about the presentation of a whole fish on a plate that I just love -- and I love picking all that delicious meat off the bones.  The accompanying brussel sprouts were a huge hit too. Onto desserts:  we had the pannacotta and the warm flourless chocolate cake.  Both good, but overshadowed by the pastas.  The pastas are the hot ticket here. Terragusto is BYOB, making it a really affordable gastronomic experience.  The chef's tasting menu was awesome, but I will probably stick to the pastas next time I return.  Consuming as much food as I did last night is a twice or thrice a year event. :) Go here.  It is one of the best Italian meals I've ever had.",0.9984,0.792,0.186,0.022,0.5216818642350557

So, I took my #1 girl out to Terragusto last Friday, and had what can only be called an ""overall great experience"".  The layout of the restaurant was warm, and welcoming with food to match.  Our waitress was very helpful. As an app, I had the...I'm going to butcher this word...sformato?  It was a vegetable custard with oyster mushrooms.  It smelled, and tasted rich and earthy. My next course was a past with duck, which was excellent, and tasted almost like chicken soup except multiplied by a factor of ten. As a main course, I had the steak which was perfectly seasoned, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The meat melted in my mouth.  Very good.",0.9861,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5028947368421053

The flavors of the dishes range from subtle to strong and you can tell a lot of effort has gone into preparing the food and the ingredients are well sourced. I like the Tuscan inspiration in the dishes and combinations. I like how the menu changes every month but they always keep the 4-cheese bolognese pasta which is simply to die for.

I feel like the dishes are well thought out, and while not always knock your socks off, still impressionable. I've never had bad service. Apparently, this is a point of contention with some. I can't speak for every server there, but this is my third go around and I have no complaints. To be honest, I'm really surprised by any reviews under 4 starts. I think you need to know what you're getting yourself into before going so you won't have the wrong expectations. The menu is small, it's not a red sauce Italian joint, the secondi is supposed to be simple and straightforward (which may come across as flavorless or boring, but it's meant to be about doing as little as possible to something of high quality), not everything is going to delight your palette just because someone else thought it did. I feel the need to defend the place because it seems like some of us are going to a completely different restaurant.

We had to ask twice to have our wine opened, we didn't get water until we were halfway through our second glass of wine, and we didn't get bread until we were done with our pasta course and waiting for our entree.  We did the Italian meal - an appetizer, a pasta and then a shared entree. I had the polenta with cheese sauce and asparagus, which was very good. My husband had a trio of bruschetta, which he said was only OK. 50% to start.  On to the pasta course. Terragusto hypes its housemade pastas as the cornerstone of their menu. However, both of our pastas were horrific. I had the four cheese ravioli in a brown butter sauce. The sauce was greasy and flavorless, so it was like eating cheese ravioli sitting in puddle of oil. Ick. My husband had their famous chard pasta baked in ragu. This was mediocre at best. The pasta was way overcooked, and it tasted like a tuna-less tuna noodle casserole. 0 for 2 on the pastas. We shared the pork tenderloin for our main course. It was cooked within an inch of its life and was barely edible. Fail for the main course. The Verdict: The polenta was really good, as was the bottle of wine we brought with us. That's where it ends. Awful service, overhyped pastas and an overcooked, dry main course were really disappointing.

I was so excited to try this place - Italian food is my favorite and this looked like such a gem, especially with all the great reviews. But it was just ok, not great, but decent. There were some great elements to the meal - their olive oil is probably the best I ever had. I know, raving about olive oil? But it's so good. They serve olives with it which are also yum. Don't skip this!  We split the crustini appetizer and i can't imagine eating it by myself. The buffalo mozzarella one was delicious - my favorite. The other two were very good as well. Totally worth it. But the entrees were disappointing. I had the gnocchi with scallops with mushroom ragu. It sounded so strange to me - gnocchi and scallops? ragu? - that I thought this must be one of those amazing combinations that you would never think of putting together. It wasn't. The scallops, as I would've imagined, were completely overpowered by the gnocchi and mushroom. It just tasted ""fishy"". The gnocchi was a little grainy, too. My bf got the ravioli which were pretty decent - if a tad bland - but nothing to write home about.  Service is fine, everyone is friendly without being annoying. There are some good things on this menu, but you have to know what to get beforehand. Overall a meh-place with a few good menu items.",0.9974,0.703,0.272,0.025,0.5870202020202021

Since it's BYOB, it's really easy to keep the bill reasonable. I personally thought it was a bargain for how incredible the food was. We did the starters and the pasta course and added on a dessert.

2008-10-26,5.0,"I was excited when the H's (Katie and Dan H, the cutest yelp couple eva), asked me to join them and their friend for dinner at Terragusto. Knowing how much I enjoyed when I first came here, I maneuvered my party plans to join them.  Terragusto is a great BYOB Italian restaurant, actually one of my favorites. It is small, the place can accommodate large groups as was demonstrated that night with two lager tables of more than 6 people. It can get loud very, very easily. Super easy since, as Dan H pointed out that night, no sound dampening materials on the wall. Exposed brick all over and a slightly open kitchen are lovely things to see, but do not help limiting the sound. They also do cooking classes as well and their pasta is made every day on the premises. Also, service can be a little hit or miss, our server seemed to have something on her mind, or maybe I think she hurt her foot since she seemed to walk a little gingerly at points. I don't think she was on top of her game, but I am okay with it. Why? Well, let me tell you why... I mean that is why you are reading this right? Besides the wonderful company I had for dinner, the food is quite phenomenal. Simply done, nothing way over the top, but solid in taste, quality, ingenuity, presentation and value. If you really want to stuff your self silly, (and really,... who doesn't?), go for the Italian style dinner. That would be a starter, pasta course and your choice of meat and if you still have room you can take off a dollar for dessert. Add in the BYOB-ness of this place and well, you got a pretty good gut buster of a meal. What did we have? Well, for first courses, there was pasta fagioli, creamy and beany with smokey pork flowing through out. A roasted red pepper polenta with soft mozzarella on top and crustini. The crustini, (9 pieces in all), were of sauteed mustard greens and olive oil on three (my fav!), goat cheese and beets on another three and a trout mousse on the last three. If you didn't guess by now, yep, it came in the colors and image of the Italian flag. Awwww..... tasty and patriotic!    For the pasta course there was the baked bolognese which was quite tasty, rich and hearty, soft polenta with braised Waygu beef in a lovely and flavorful sauce. Then there was the egg noodles with seven different mushrooms, (can you name seven different mushrooms? Don't worry, we only came up with five off the top of our heads.), and gnocchetti with sweet shrimp, crab, cauliflower in a white wine and tarragon sauce. (Um be careful there.. your drool is getting on your keyboard) Yes, strange with the cauliflower, but the sweetness of the seafood and the sauce really balanced it out well and kept it together. Then the meat course. What happens here is you chose one meat course which is enough for two, (really its more like enough for four after everything you just stuffed in yourself). They have poultry, pork, beef and fish courses you can choose from. Simply cooked with seasoned sea salt and pepper and seared in a cast iron skillet and comes with baked polenta and roasted veggies. We did the duck and the fish. However by the time this course came, we were stuffed to the gills. Well... Dan wasn't as he munched on the fish and duck, but for the most part we were done. Yes, this means I didn't get dessert. Yes, you can pick up your jaw off the floor, I didn't get dessert.  Really, for about $50 per person, (if you do the Italian dinner), bring your own drink and the amount of quality food you get for the price, you are getting away with a very reasonable dinner. Be patient with the noise, but let me just say the pacing is good, the service is fine, the food is outstanding. Bring a bottle or two... or three, bring some good company and bring your hearing aids, you might just have as wonderful of a night as I did.",0.9987,0.813,0.169,0.018,0.49752760524499656

Period.  Every aspect was wonderful.  The chef makes the pasta fresh every morning and tries to use locally grown produce, meats, and dairy products as much as possible.  The menu is seasonal so whatever is fresh is what's used in the evenings menu. It's BYOB.  I can go on and on. I have eaten here two times. They offer a three course chef's tasting menu but i have not experienced this yet (portions are large).   Antipasti Forte: I have had the baked polenta, truffle oil, brussels sprouts, and parmesan.  Holy crap! yeah, that good. Also had the crostini another time. Also great but that polenta...man. Pasta:  I had the agnellotti d'agnello (braised Crawford Farm lamb & roasted vegetables stuffed into pasta, in brown butter with fennel & a red-wine glaze) and the al forno: verde alla bolognese (baked swiss chard pasta with a creamy four meat tomato sauce, parmigiano-reggiano & a touch of white truffle).   Do I even need to review those?

I had an amazing meal here with some friends before going to see the legendary Neil Diamond.  We were worried we were going to be weighed down by a rich, heavy, Italian meal, but were pleasantly surprised. Yes the food is rich (try the decadent al forno verde alla bolognese), but the portions are just the right size so you don't stuff yourself and fall into a food coma.  Having the pasta hand-made also makes a huge difference and you'll find yourself eating slowly to enjoy the toothsome texture.    Also good were the chilled fennel soup which was silky and refreshing, the tagliatelle neri con gamberetti, and the pasta con funghi e peperoni. The only miss was the free-range pork loin.  We opted to go for the Italian meal at $37.50 a head and our server assured us the pork loin would easily serve three.  Three what?  Supermodels?  Otherwise, six razor thin two-inch wide slices of pork for three people?  Not going to cut it.  Because of that, I'd suggest not going with the Italian meal and ordering a la carte.   Other than that, my meal at Terragusto was great and I'm a big fan of their BYOB policy.",0.991,0.769,0.195,0.037,0.5623015873015873
2008-09-02,4.0,"Not sure about the service complaints. We were treated very well. Promptly seated as per our reservation. Our server was extremely polite and walked us through the dishes very amiably. We got three appetizers: the polenta with mozz di bufala and tomato, the chilled zuchini/mint soup, and the tomato/gorgonzola salad. The soup was the low point, as it was just dominated by olive oil. The salad was the medium point... the tomatoes and gorgonzola were very tasted, though the portion size was small and we could have done without the drizzle of balsamic vinegar. The polenta was the high point... it was great with a slightly crispy crust, good quality mozzarella and a delicate tomato accompaniment.  For pastas we got the papardelle with beets and the black pasta with shrimp. Both pastas were wonderful. The beets were divine, though I think the dish could be improved by throwing another vegetable in there for flavor diversity. My squid ink pasta was very well done and reminded me of some of the good seafood pastas I've had in Italy. BYOB is great, and makes up for the fact that the restaurant is perhaps a touch on the pricey side. We brought a Canneto Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and not only did it finally make me enjoy sangiovese wines, but it paired perfectly with the beet pasta and polenta appetizer.",0.9686,0.863,0.123,0.014,0.6204232804232804
2008-08-29,4.0,"The good reviews for Terragusto are well deserved!  They turned what looked like a disastrous start to a friend's birthday dinner into a very pleasurable and gastronomically satisfying evening.     Let me explain:  We went with a party of 5 with an early reservation for 6pm.  At least we thought we had a reservation.  Due to a mis-communication among our group, each of us thought someone else made the arrangements and it turned out that no one did.     I understand the need for reservations, particularly in a place like this where the dining room is a single storefront that seats a maximum of maybe 60 to 70 people,  but this was early on a Thursday night and the place was barely a third full at the time.  When they told us the earliest they could seat us was 8:30, I figured we were getting a dose of that snotty-foodie attitude to which a few here have alluded.  I'm happy to admit that I was wrong! While we stood outside trying to come up with ""Plan B"", one of the servers came out and offered to put us at the ""pasta table"" in the front window.  It was counter-like seating that's not conducive to conversing with your whole party, but it worked for us.  They didn't have to do this, but we were all glad they did. We decided on the ""Italian Meal"", which was a combination of individual antipasti choices and shared family-style meat dishes.  Our server, Jana, was professional, friendly without being overly so, and efficient.  She explained that the menu changes monthly, the pasta made fresh daily, and all ingredients are organic and from local or Midwestern farms.  (I personally don't care that much about organic, but it makes the green crowd feel good) You can check out their menu for descriptions, but in a nutshell, I would've married my dinner if I could! I highly recommend the polenta and the whole grain pasta pappardelle.  The chicken and beef  dishes were deliciously seasoned and tasted good, but the ""market price"" extra charge seemed like a gimmick just to get a few bucks more.   A couple others have mentioned all the ""rules"", and I have to agree somewhat.  I don't want to remember complicated ""if-then-else"" statements when I go out to dinner and then get nickel and dimed to death.   They pride themselves on their simple but delicious pastas and they've succeeded there.  If they simplify the menu just a bit, they'd be 5 stars with no questions.   I will definitely go back!",0.9952,0.787,0.17,0.043,0.41832766439909286

Our first time at Terragusto was this past weekend.  We dined with friends who had been there several times before and have had nothing but wonderful words about the restaurant. The flavors & the ""pairings of flavors"" are fresh & vibrant at times ... then warm & subtle at others.  Nothing we had was overbearing, nor lacking.  We enjoyed the ""Italian Meal"" where each person chooses an antipasti (appetizer/salad) & a primi (pasta) and the table shares the secondi (main course).  The ingenious Sformato must be experienced!  The polenta was superb - smooth & moist yet firm. The tomatoes were tender as all get out.

Now, the service ... it's not like our server was verbally rude.  The ""Italian Meal"" is really designed to be a plate passing sharing experience, so it wasn't the staggered arrival of dishes.  It was the apparent lack of interest in paying attention to the table. When a server says, ""Relax, take your time"" - that should apply to the people dining - Not the server. The dining room wasn't so packed that our server should have been overwhelmed ... and It's not like our server needed to run to a bar to get drinks for tables ... and our server didn't seem to be new at waiting tables - but service-wise, the evening was a series of little things that were forgotten then topped off with an unexplainable absence after trying to sell us on dessert.  We felt ignored and that apparently our server had made up their mind that ""we were done"" and they didn't need to pay us much mind anymore. I guess there's a possibility that I'm being too critical, but in my opinion - the level of service we received didn't match up to the inspired level of quality that comes out of that kitchen.

Once we were seated, our bottle of wine was promptly opened and poured into those little juice glasses that make me feel very Italian.  :)   The menu is pretty condensed, but I like to think that a small menu means that everything is done well!  The menu also changes monthly, though there are some items that are permanent fixtures.  Mr. Man and I opted for ""the Italian meal"", which at $37.50 is a good deal.  Each diner chooses an antipasto and a pasta, and then you share the third course.  It's alot of food, I was totally stuffed!  Maybe because we had a very meaty dinner!   The bread and olive oil they bring out is so delicious!  I LOVE the bread, MMM.  The olives are good, but I like my olives saltier. For our antipasti, I chose the crostini, and the boyf had the carpaccio.  The crostini were good, but not mind-blowing.  The 3 varieties were porcini-bean puree, fontina-olive salad, and baccala mousse.  I ordered it mainly for the baccala mousse--MMM, pureed fish!  I mean, everything tasted super fresh, like someone had spent the whole day pureeing mushrooms and fish in the kitchen!  The wagyu carpaccio was light, and had a much more delicate beef flavor than I was expecting.  Tasty! For me, the highlight of the meal was the pasta course.  All the pasta is made in house by hand every morning.  Mr. Man ordered the black pasta with shrimp in a spicy white wine sauce.  The pasta is colored with cuttlefish ink!  It looked very dramatic, the rich black noodles crowned with plump pink shrimp!  The sauce was not what we were expecting.  It did have a nice red pepper kick, but it was more tomato-y than wine-y.  But that is not to say that I didn't LOVE it!  Per our server's suggestion, I decided to order the pasta stuffed with lamb and vegetables in brown butter sauce.  My other choice, the baked swiss chard pasta, is always on the menu.  Oh WOW.  The lamb and brown butter gave the dish so much richness, while the fennel and the red wine glaze added  sweetness.  Great layered flavors, such an amazing dish!  I hope these items show up on the menu again, because they are SERIOUSLY some of the best pastas I have EVER HAD. Just a few minutes after we started in on our pastas, our third course arrived.  We chose the steak del giorno, which that day was a skirt steak.  BE CAREFUL--all of the meat/poultry/fish is market price, so you might have to pay extra on top of the set price for the italian meal, depending on which meat you choose.  OK, OK.  All of their products are either locally grown, organic or all-natural, and I understand that this can mean a slightly higher price.  But $42 for a skirt steak?  When you can get if for like $4 a pound at the Mexican grocery store?  I thought that was a bit high.  However, the steak was cooked wonderfully and served atop a bed of zucchini and a piece of yummy baked polenta. Stuffed as we were, we decided to have dessert as well.  The special was an espresso-mascarpone mousse topped with lady fingers and chocolate shavings, basically a deconstructed tiramisu.  MMM, we cleaned out that big ol' cup of rich and tasty mascarpone!  So good.  Apparently the chef is also making gelato, and I hope to try that sometime soon! One tiny complaint was that it took forever to get our coffees, and we were sitting RIGHT in front of the espresso machine!  We heard our coffees being pulled, and then they showed up at the table about 15 minutes later.  Mr. Man's espresso was pretty much cold by then.  Boo. I really love Terragusto and plan on coming back again and again!  This is a wonderful and comfortable place where you can have food that is very fresh and of superb quality.  I would expect this type of food from a much fancier place!  This place is SO close to a 5-star rating, I can't wait to come back and be impressed again!",0.9997,0.769,0.223,0.008,0.5068167701863355

I was using their online menu which was still their May menu but they were now using a June menu. She took the time to read the current menu to me and help me make decisions. She also called me back to let me know when the food was ready- apparently its best to enjoy the fresh made pasta when it is still hot rather than reheating it. She was very nice when I got there and paid. You don't always get service like this especially on to-go orders and I really appreciated it!!  I had a problem with the food but it's because of my personal tastes: there was truffle oil on everything. Maybe I am the only one but I am sick of truffles, truffle oil or truffle flavor. It was great the first couple times but now it's all over every menu and I am just tired of the flavor. Because of the truffle flavor it was a bit too much for me to truly enjoy everything.

Single. Dish was amazing, fresh, and bursting with flavor, and it was so much fun to be surprised by what was up next.   The service was great (i know others have had a hit-or-miss experience) and perfectly timed.  They were pretty busy, but our server completely managed to take care of us and nicely explain each dish.  In addition, the chef came out at the end of our meal and we had a really nice chat (my participation was limited to still stuffing my face and getting a drool-laden compliment in every once in a while).   My tips:  Make a reservation, do the chef's menu, order desert, and plan on a food coma after.  BYOB, and there is a great wine shop if you go a block or two south-east.

Terragusto epitomizes purity of flavors by using the best seasonal and gourmet ingredients. And we didn't even need wine to keep our spirits high, the food took care of it all.  We started with some excellent bread and fruity olive oil and anticipation filled the air as we waited on our appetizers. The ambience was warm, rustic and loud, but in a good way. Decor resembled a family dining room, and I was ready to start pounding the table for food, but it arrived just in time. We had the terragusto mixed salad (a fresh verdant mix of shaved vegetables and greens), the baked polenta with fontina and asparagus (ohmigod!!!) and the sformato of spinach topped with gorgonzola, such creamy deliciousness.  I was almost afraid to get our main courses, the antipasti seemed like such a hard act to follow. But apparently not. The swiss chard pasta baked with meat sauce, the ravioli with brown butter sauce, and the pappardelle with asparagus and basil, each were wonderful. We cleaned our plates silently, with the reverence required by the meal, just stopping to make the requisite slurping noise and guzzle more Pellegrino.  Our waitress was a bit spotty but friendly and gave us enough breathing room before coming out with dessert menus. The four of us shared the pannacotta and flourless chocolate cake. All I have to say  is, if they had made a misstep on dessert, I would have been beyond shocked. By this point, these guys could do no wrong in my mind. Or on the plate. So so good.

If you've only lived your life with dried box pastas it will be like a blind man seeing for the first time. The olive oil they serve for dipping crusty Italian bread is out of this world! A strong and almost fruity olive flavor with no acidic aftertaste.  It was the best olive oil I've tasted short of the $150 bottle we used for garnish at the French restaurant I cooked at back in the day. The apps came on strong- a wagyu beef carpaccio with a classic horshradish aioli and baby arugula.  I could have had another two or three pounds, no problems.  Fortunately my girlfriend had the baked polenta with a decadent Fontina truffle sauce that I might start making for the world's most decadent cheese fries.   The baked bologenese with rich and real parmiggiano-reggiano cheese and a few drops of white truffle oil is worth the trip alone.  The papperdelle was also a great example of the art of noodle making but lacked the melty cheesy goodness of some of the other options. And yeah our waiter either thought we didn't want or deserve dessert since we didn't finish our dinner so we had to browbeat him to get a menu back but the espresso mousse was worth it.  I think Terragusto is struggling to adapt to the non-stop flow of Yelpers through the door- they only seat around 25-30 at once which has got to be a logistical nightmare.",0.8992,0.857,0.092,0.051,0.4203333333333332

My friend adores carpaccios, so naturally he got the wagyu beef carpaccio.  I'm afraid of eating raw beef (I mean, come on, it's RAW cow.

And at a fairly authentic feeling Italian restaurant, food should be a cause for celebration and conversation, so I didn't even mind the noise all that much.  But I wanted to enjoy the food more than I did.  I think my chef friends have ruined me with all their chef-speak and food lessons.  The pork was supposed to be medium, and although it was seasoned very nicely, it was a bit overcooked.  I particular enjoyed the baked polenta appetizer with lamb sausage (or something), although the polenta was a bit dry.  Overall I thought that all of the menu choices were wonderful, and for the most part, how I remembered Italian food to be (actually food IN Italy, not the American version).  I'm all for family style when it comes to Italian cookin', so even though we each had our own entree, being with such absolutely wonderful companions and sharing bites of all our dishes simply added to the charm.  The pasta dishes were nice, back to the basics of good food without adding heavy creams or hiding the flavors in sauce.  You really got to enjoy the beauty of great pasta.  The desserts were a perfect way to end, and I really enjoyed the bread budding.  Although what is it with every restaurant having a flourless chocolate cake on their menu?  I mean, even The Cheesecake Factory has flourless chocolate cake.  But, in retrospect this one was quite nice.   Nice.  My word of the evening for Terragusto.  Maybe I just had too big of expectations.

There's a lot of mediocre prosciutto out there and this stuff was serious- like you were in Spain or Italy. YUM.  Then to the pasta- I had the gnocchi with a lot of seafood, it was really tasty and had just the right amount of heat but I just love tomato sauces so much that I wish it were tomato vs. white wine. It was still amazing. But my boyfriend got the ""al forno"" Oh..my...God. It was to die for and extremely rich. Anything with truffle in it and I'm usually obsessed. This was so so good.

For our pastas, we chose the tortellini, gnocchi, and the pappardelle with mushrooms.  When ordering, I thought the gnocchi would be my favorite (as it usually is at other Italian restaurants), especially since it was a mix of zucchini and seafood (also favorites of mine).  But I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved the tortellini.  The pasta was huge and full of fresh vegetables and cheese.  I couldn't stop eating it. I had heard the maple panna cotta was not to be missed so I knew we had to order it for dessert.  We also chose the chocolate flourless cake which is usually my favorite dessert to order anywhere.  But the maple panna cotta?  I could eat that ALL day.  I actually picked up the little cup it came in and just started digging toward the bottom, ignoring everyone else at the table.

Definitely make a reservation, as this restaurant is quaint, small and perfect for a date.... thus, a popular place for dinner. (And don't forget to bring a bottle of your favorite wine, at this place is BYOB too!) We opted for the 3 course menu, which was $37 per person. We both got to choose our choice of 2 first courses, 2 pastas, 1 meat or fish to share & 1 litre still or sparkling water. The menu offerings change seasonally/monthly, so they take pride in serving up the dishes using fresh ingredients. Furthermore, they love mentioning how their pastas are made fresh in the morning using organic ingredients. First courses - My husband had the potato & leek soup with pancetta. It was smooth, creamy and the touch of saltiness from the pancetta was perfect. I ordered the crostini trio of grilled bread topped with three favorites - bufala/eggplant/tomato, olive tapenade, prosciutto/parmigiano/herbs. It was quite a large serving as an appetizer, easily enough to share, as there were 9 crostinis in the order. Pasta courses - My husband ordered the gnocchi di semola con granchio, gamberi, cavolfiore e dragoncello, which was roman-style semolina gnocchi with crab, shrimp, cauliflower, tomato & tarragon with white wine. He's a seafood lover so this pasta dish was perfect for him. For myself, I ordered pappardelle with various cheeses and spinach. I thought my pasta dish was a bit on the salty side - perhaps there was too much cheese that overpowered the delicate flavors of the fresh pasta. Lastly, for our meat course - We both shared the whole fish of the day. It was encrusted with salt then baked with fresh herbs and lemon slices. Our server brought the whole fish to our table and seemed apprehensive about us diving in... maybe because she wasn't sure if we knew how to eat a whole fish that hadn't been deboned. Little did she know that we both knew how to filet a fish cleanly and eating a whole fish wasn't something we were unfamiliar with. We deboned that fish perfectly, if I must say so myself! When we finished, our server was quite impressed and confessed that most folks don't order the fish because they aren't sure how to eat it whole.

Stepping in, the space was personal and inviting -- authentic Italian cafe style. But I must say it's really about the food.

Unfortunately, I can't say much about everything on the menu, because I was only able to try a few things during my first visit, but I will be back to eat my way through after the meal we had there. We learned that the chef trained in the Bologna region of Italy. The homemade polenta with mushrooms, cannelloni beans, and housemade sausage was a symphony in my mouth -- each bite offering new discoveries -- rosemary, a cheesey crust, parsley, cornmeal, etc.. The mezzaluna filled with rainbow trout in a white wine sauce was so surprisingly full of flavor that I never wanted each bite to end. The bolognese -- behind words. Rated best bolognese in the city of Chicago and I can see why. It was truly one of those meals you never wanted to end. Savoring each bite was not enough. Lastly, we had a whole fish similar to sea bass that was paired with caramelized brussel sprounts and potatoes. Very rustic but extremely flavorful and moist.

We did take advantage of the BYOB and service there was helpful and pretty good all around. The family style/prix fixe meal strategy does seem to be the better option for the menu. However, when you first sit and the waiter explains the menu, options and prices your head begins to spin.  The food was quite good, uses fresh and local ingredients and is a nice change from the linguini with clam sauce and lasagna of many standard Italian eateries. It didn't wow me though. I tried the crostini as an appetizer and one of the salads. Both were very good. The pastas were a little greasy with the amount of cheese and oil on them, but I favor going light on that stuff.

2007-11-20,5.0,"I recently came here with Isabella W and two other girlfriends for a Sunday evening dinner. She brought a nice bottle of cab franc that we didn't do a good enough job on polishing off.  Simply put, the food was phenomenal. Everything in the restaurant was fresh (and I love fresh pasta), local, and organic. We ordered the crostini and baked polenta for appetizers. Both were very good. I love polenta and this is definitely the best baked polenta I've ever had. It is a perfect appetizer to share - you want to save room for the entree(s). And I have to add that I even loved the olive oil that came with the complimentary bread.  For our entrees, we ordered the roasted pumpkin and butternut squash bishop's hats, al forno (baked pasta with meat sauce), and the fish of the day (I forget the name, but it was a Mediterranean fish that was similar to sea bass). I loved every single dish. They were perfectly seasoned and flavored. It made me dream of Italy. For dessert, we tried the warm vanilla pound cake bread pudding, which was very good and not too sweet, and the chocolate flourless cake. And if I had to make any constructive comments: - The restaurant was a bit chilly and though the restaurant is nicely decorated, it didn't lend enough warmth.  - The server needs to be better about refilling water glasses. - The chocolate flourless cake would taste a lot better if it was slightly heated before serving. I feel like this is becoming such a standard dessert fare. It would really make a difference if they at least served it warm like most other places! I'm not a Chicago local but I visit often enough.

Food-- We got the the 3 course shared deal.. Antipasta Misti Platter - I loved this!  The cheese was noticeably fresh, the crostini, still warm..thankfully my dining partner loathes blue cheese, which was of the  highlights of my night...An incredibly smooth blue cheese on crositini topped with a fig..the textures blended together perfectly! Pastas:  roasted pumpkin & butternut squash filled ""bishop's hats"" with brown butter, parmigiano & amaretti crumbs -- ""Scrumptious"" comes to mind..like pumpkin pie pillows..perhaps ..  Rustic whole grain pasta with mixed mushrooms, wilted spinach and pecorino - This was also outstanding...I think mainly because the texture of the pasta was just so perfect and so ""homemade"" it was comforting.. Main Course - Fish - (I will edit when I remember the proper kind) but it was a white fish, and it is served whole, which is fine, and great... but..the texture was way off, and though I would have never known why, my husband explained that it seemed it wasn't dropped into a hot enough pan to crispen the skin, then was overcooked, making it chewy.  So, that kind of sucked (the fish part). The desert was maple pana cotta and that was also really really nice. Overall, I loved the seasonal menu from start to finish - figs, tomatoes, pumpkin, kale, maple...so perfect for these early fall days.

Well when we arrived and after we became situated, the waitress came over and explained we were going to have to order from the fixed menu since there is not enough space in the kitchen for the chef to cook all our meals at once. Well, this did not make my aunt happy since they have two children w/ them (12 and 15 year old boys, not exactly gourmet eaters yet) so the chef/owner came out and well this is where the evening became.... entertaining. The chef was extremely frazzled since the restaurant was full and kept repeating the same thing over and over about how he can't cook eight differnent dinners at once since space/time is limited and the food wouldn't come out the same time -- well we didn't mind that part but he did since we were interrupting this process. Well my family found this amusing and good thing this place is BYOB because we all needed our wine glasses full again after that spontaneous yet amusing display of confusion. Well the kids were brought out pasta which they didn't eat but let's just say us adults devoured it. The downfall is the portions are a bit small and they said the pastas would be large enough to split so we ended up compromising in the end in doing so.

The Fontina salad had very good ingredients, but was slightly overdressed and a tad salty. Portion was very small as well for $9.50 price tag. The whole wheat tagliatelle with green beans was fine, but the pasta seemed a bit underdone, which was surprising considering it is made fresh daily. It had a light oil coating that was a bit salty, but overall it was a bland dish; pasta green beans, and shredded cheese. Again the portion was small. Our bill for just these two items was $28. I don't mind paying extra for local organic ingredients, but didn't feel this was very good value. The decor also seems a bit confused.  It has slightly upscale pricing, it feels more like a open floored diner with plain tables, large refrigerator in the room and jean clad servers.

2006-10-21,3.0,"First off, I called to make reservations for 7 and they said there were none open. -Called back and changed for 6 and had a table.. weird.  We got there and were the only ones in the entire place.  The waitress was okay (nothing great) but the other employees behind the counter were extremly rude.  We took advantage of the BYOB, which made up for the high prices.  The portions were way too small.. cheese ravolis cost me 2 dollars a bite.  The food was DELICIOUS though-I'd go back in a heartbeat.",0.6956,0.838,0.106,0.056,0.554888888888889
2006-10-09,4.0,"The decor needs help.  I can understand a minimalist vibe, but parts of this place are just plain ugly.  That giant refrigerator when you walk in has got to go!   Foodwise, I have no complaints.  We ate there last month....the antipasti platter was excellent along with the polenta dish which we practically licked off the plate.  We each had our own pasta dish which everyone loved and three of us shared a half chicken.  I must say I'm not one for ordering chicken when dining out, but this was hands down the most delicious chicken I've ever feasted upon!  And BYOB kept the bill reasonable too.  And the manager that night was perhaps the greatest host I've encountered in awhile.",0.9608,0.736,0.189,0.075,0.7268353174603174
2006-10-04,2.0,"A month ago, I was utterly shocked at how wonderfully executed the food was at Terragusto, and I began to sing its praises to all who would bend an ear.  Others echoed my sentiments as Terragusto became the talk of Roscoe Village.  But gushing patrons should check in again, because this Tuesday night's experience found the kitchen staff at Theo Gilbert's promising new surprise asleep at the wheel.  Despite confirming that we had been there before and understood the menu layout, our server frothed with a canned diatribe, insistent upon spieling it all over again.  But I was willing to forgive this distraction en route to anticipated culinary affirmation.  After the salads came out overdressed and poorly presented, I sensed something was amiss in the back of the house (a notion that was later confirmed by our server).  What were absolutely stellar dishes a month ago (polenta, swiss chard pasta, skirt steak) were botched by kitchen incompetence this try.  The polenta dish bore no resemblance--save for the ingredients--to that we raved about last time, and although the Bolognese appeared on the menu, it  ""wasn't ready"" in time for our 7PM seating (?).  The skirt steak was the most striking disappointment: curiously missing the peppery dry rub and high-heat sear that gave it such satisfying texture and flavor last time, it essentially steamed itself to rubbery, bland completion at surrogate hands.   The one true standout was the ripiene, a ravioli consisting of billowy, membrane-thin pasta pillows filled with butternut squash in a sage & brown butter sauce--outstanding, but I suspect it was made and frozen by the former chef before he scored some new gig in Vegas (I'm purely speculating here).  If I'm fixated on the food, it's because food is all Terragusto has going for it, and it might not have that anymore.  Let's face it, the location on busy Addison favors indoor dining which, given Chicago's 8-month winters, would not necessarily be a bad thing were it not for Terragusto's decor: a hopeless amalgam of over-watted (it's called a dimmer switch, people!) aluminum ital-design lighting juxtaposed with tired honey-oak panelling and idiosyncratic layout (what the heck is that refrigerator case doing in there?).  The wait staff is caring but unpolished.  The BYOB policy does keep the final check amount down, which is nice, and I enjoy playing sommelier for a night, but it stands somewhat in conflict with a frequently changing menu, for obvious reasons.  All of that I would gleefully dismiss for another taste of the food which once was.  I would have awarded only 1 star had it not been for the superlative ripiene course.  Gilbert needs to get his house in order at Terragusto---fast---or the groundswell of accolades will erode into a mudslide of mediocrity.",0.8848,0.861,0.078,0.061,0.5157828282828283
