Came here for restaurant week Prix-fix dinner and it had one of the best RW menus. I yelped about this place before going (of course!) and followed suggestions from the other yelpers on the 4 course selection. I went with Pate/Mussels/Amish Chicken/Chocolate mousse.  Everything was delicious.  Mussels taste amazing - the broth was rich and flavorful. The bread that came with it was perfect for dipping.  Amish Chicken was a pleasant surprise. I never usually order chicken when I dine out because I'm always afraid it will turn out dry/tasteless. I took a risk and gave up on steak to try this. I was very satisfied! The chicken was well-cooked, juicy and tender.  Dessert was delightful as well - The chocolate mousse was not too sweet and not too heavy.

First time the burger was cooked as ordered, but exploding with molten grease, and not the good kind. The brioche bun basically disintegrated on me on account of the grease level and cheese spread. Also, as noted in the review on ahamburgertoday, they seem to salt the beef pre-forming, which technically makes this more sausage than burger. The patty itself was dense like a sausage as well. I recently returned and wanted to give this burger another shot. This time, it was way overcooked and very dry. The patty was still dense and chewy almost though. Without the aid of the grease, the brioche was way too much for this burger. My girlfriend actually removed the top of her bun and discarded it. The bun compounded the dryness and made this burger difficult to swallow, literally. The beef here has no taste sadly, which really should be the hero of any burger.

2011-08-07,2.0,"I in no way blame the server for what I'm about to say. I served for many years and believe it is up to the management to educate the staff. However, that said, our service was really bad. She began by asking us if we want anything besides water, which reminded me of being at a diner. It was nine o-clock at night and we were obviously on a date. There are many better ways to pose the question. Not a big deal, though.  Then we were looking over the cheese menu, which charges $7 for a small hunk. We obviously had questions, because there was a 3-piece minimum. It was obvious the server knew nothing about the cheese, let alone how to pronounce them. When we asked for recommendations, she pointed to the menu and said, ""this one, that one, and the second one from top."" That's it. She didn't even attempt to say the name, describe the flavor, or tell us why she chose the ones she pointed to from the menu.  It was the same thing for our wine. She basically pointed to the three most expensive bottles on the menu without even attempting to pair a wine with the cheese we had selected.  It was all very awkward. The thing is, when you are spending $21 on three pieces of cheese and $14/glass on wine, you expect more...much more.  Another member of the staff dropped off the cheese by placing the plate halfway on and halfway off the table, because he didn't want to make room by rearranging a couple of things on the table. He said nothing as he did this and walked away. Again, it was just really strange. He didn't even say, ""this one is that that one, that one is this one..."" haha a little joke.  But it would have been nice to know what we are chewing on! Oh - which reminds me to say that it is communal dining at long tables, so you hear everything going on around you - not for an intimate date night. We had to laugh when the server used the same opening line on the couple sat next to us: ""Do you want anything besides water?"" The gentleman asked for a pilsner recommendation and the server said, ""Let's take a look...."" and grabbed the menu from him. She proceeded to read every beer on the list. It was just sad and unfortunate. She obviously knew nothing about anything on the menu and the management didn't care.  About 20 minutes after finishing our wine and cheese, we still hadn't heard from the server - even though she kept walking by us - and got the check and left. It was our anniversary and we weren't about to drop more money on such a weird and disjointed restaurant.  We will not be back.  Yes this place has a patio and they are attempting to do the foodie vibe, but it fails. They haven't taken the time to follow through with their staff.  There is not a lot of selection on the menu, either.  I honestly don't understand all the good reviews. Why go to a restaurant like this just ""be seen"" or sit at an outdoor patio when Chicago has so much more to offer?

And the few times I've put in such a ""special request"" I've been lucky to dine on this pretty fab patio. I'm not only a fan of Duchamp's patio, but also fond of their cocktails. The Audrey's Cup was so delightful that I ordered two of them.   My husband ordered the smoked jaguar and while it may sound like a manly drink it looks like one of the girly cocktails I tend to enjoy.  The food is good, but nothing particularly exciting. On my most recent visit my party of 6 ordered a bunch of things for the table.  Favorite apps included the mussels, steak tartare and grilled octopus.  None of the entrees we ordered were that good- the goat cheese ravioli was especially a letdown. However, Duchamp certainly knows how to make a french fry and I should probably use this review to apologize to my dining companions for eating all of them.  Somehow after an entire bowl of fries I still found room for dessert. We were all about the chocolate cake, but my hubby insisted on the rhubarb. And so we got both.  The chocolate cake was as good as the french fries (perhaps even better), but the rhubarb didn't really do it for me.  I think the hubby agreed, but pretended like it was the best dessert in the world since he had insisted on ordering it. Sigh. Personally I think we should have gotten two chocolate cakes.  Our waitress was friendly, although she did comment several times on our healthy appetites. I was waiting for her to oink at our table by the end of the meal, but I guess she had a point...we did eat quite a lot!

How can you not feel sexy when tequila is combined with house-made lavender syrup, agave, creole bitter, and lime... and sprayed with a mist of Mezcal? Can you resist the temptation? I couldn't! Preet's Bespin Cooler is the perfect summer drink, with citrus vodka, St. Germain, lemon, Sanbitter Soda, orange essence, served with a long stalk of mint. Looked as tall, beautiful, and elegant as Preet herself.  Scene 3 - the food: The manservant steps in. With his undying gratitude and unflinching love for his boss (me), Matt made sure it was stellar experience. It probably helped that he knows chef Aaron. Chef came to our table, chatted with us, and sent over special salads that we normally wouldn't have ordered. Seedless watermelon covered with prosciutto and other stuff? Simply delectable. Ordered a few more appetizers to share: the farro, house-made pasta, rabbit foie gras mousse,  shaved fennel salad, and the famous baby octopus everyone is talking about. We couldn't ask for a better waitress than Laurel, she made sure everyone was happy and well taken care of.  The man loves burrata.The Farro was served with smoked grapes, marcona almond, pea shoots, and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette. Vanished in a few minutes. House-made pasta: pulled wild boar with pine nuts and raisins, covered with a layer of flat pasta and shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Simple, yet stunning. Rabbit foie gras mousse: my favorite dish of the lot. I am a huge fan of foie and pate. The rabbit foie is served with apricot jam steeped in sauterne. The stunning component of this dish is the sauterne apricot jam. Smear a little of the jam on the baguette along with foie and you will be transported to foie heaven. Yes, such a heaven exists - a place where there is unlimited supply of foie and pate - in my mind! Lastly, the famous baby octopus everyone's been talking about. Most likely the best octopus I've had in this city. Slightly charred baby octopus served with a side of chick peas on top of romesco sauce. Brilliant combination of flavors and textures.  All through this meal chef Aaron came to our table and made sure we are enjoying our food. Laurel made sure our cocktails were refilled, before we moved on to wine. She asked the man what he likes and recommended a Slovenian Tohkai Brda. The Tohkai Brda - not as sweet as a traditional Hungarian Tokaji, and more dry - complemented our dinner very well.  For main courses, we ordered the Rainbow trout, duck leg confit, and fish of the day - Pompano. While pondering over a fourth entree choice, Laurel recommended we get the pork chop. We weren't quite sure, because pork chop is a simple and boring cut of meat, but I am glad we took Laurel's suggestion. The pork chop is  a big slab of meat (almost a pound), with a rib at the end. Cooked to perfection in a charred leek vinaigrette, it elevated the traditional boring pork chop to a higher level.  The highlight of the entrees was the rainbow trout. A butterfly filet of trout sauteed with ramps, Spanish chorizo, and served with a slight drizzling of harissa. My goodness! The subtle flavor of trout combined with smoky chorizo and spicy harissa resulted in delightful moaning on my behalf.  The duck leg confit was like a festival of beets. The confit was served with charred beet greens, baby beets, and beet gastrique. Beet-a-palooza! Ok, that was lame. As if we weren't full by this time, chef Aaron treated us to a few desserts. A chocolate cake, bread pudding, and the most divine of all - rhubarb consomme layered with mascarpone, topped with pecans, set in a pool of sweetness with citrus meringues floating around. It was so incredibly beautiful, I wanted to make love to it right on the table. Heaven came in a bowl. Service was stellar. Laurel made sure we had a fantastic time.  Food you want to make love to.

I love the sweetness of parsnip puree and the scallop was cooked perfectly, but I think I've had this same preparation elsewhere... The grilled octopus with some kind of red pepper sauce was the stand-out dish of the evening. We liked it so much we ordered a second one. As for the entrees, I had the steak with chimichurri sauce which was rather lackluster. It was a little over-cooked for medium rare and small. The chimichurri sauce lacked more oil and garlic. AI guess that I should just stick to ordering this prep at an Argentinian steakhouse! Also, there were both peruvian and maybe fingerling potatoes which were really undercooked--very hard. The trout that my boyfriend had was served skin-on, which didn't bother me, but there really wasn't anything to it. The flavour of the fish wasn't that great and I can't remember what else was served with it. Perhaps if it had some sort of additions to it...

They've kept the favorites like the Asian chicken wings, which are undoubtedly the best wings in the city and the luscious mussels chock-full of garlic broth and brought up some new menu items that are upping the ante in both style and flavor. If you've ever wondered about wild boar, look no further than the house made pasta with wild boar, pine nuts and... raisins?  Surprising in every way, mainly because a) I doubted I'd ever eat boar and 2) who knew raisins in a savory pasta dish would be so outstanding? Chef Aaron is doing great things with fish these days, so do yourself a favor and listen up when your server talks about the specials.  It's ramp season right now, so we were treated to a delightful mild fish with ramps.  Delish.

Instead of ahi tuna with mango sticky rice, the options included a burger, rainbow trout, or something else that I don't even remember at this point.. boo! However, the waitress did explain that they wanted to serve fresh ingredients so the menus are subject to change. I just wish I'd known that beforehand. We ordered anyway (I had the trout), and found that the food was good but I think the letdown of the menu kind of colored our experience.

With former chef Allen Sternweiler off working on a new venture, former sous chef and gourmet sensation, Aaron Lirette, has stepped up to fill his shoes in the kitchen. Now if we're being honest, it must be said, he has not only thrown those old shoes out the window, but appears to be wearing kick ass spurred boots instead. Gone is the stale, but trusty menu of Euro/American favorites and in are impeccably prepared, seasonally exclusive, beautifully plated, contemporary cuisine creations. Duchamp has had a major food facelift, and not like the Joan Rivers kind, there's nothing jarring here, no Sir! This Bucktown spot has just become an overhauled rendition of what a truly inventive dining experience should be. Bravo!  2. What you should eat:  \\ seared diver scallop, parsnip puree, oyster mushroom, bacon  \\ baby octopus, chickpea, radish and romesco  \\ house made pasta with wild boar, pine nuts and raisins  \\ duck leg confit, baby beets, charred beet green, beet gastrique  \\ rhubarb, mascarpone, pecan, citrus meringue  3. And lastly... the cocktail menu has also received quite a bit of a special treatment - and a hefty dose of acclaim to boot - in the way of specialty liquors mixed with undeniably clever and creative accompaniments. Time Out magazine recognized them as having one of the Best New Cocktail Programs in the city, and I recognized how much I effing loved my smooth, sexy Yakuza with Bulliet Bourbon, Oninoshitaburui Sake, Fig Simple Syrup and Lemon Essence. Bottoms Up!  If you haven't Duchamped in awhile, this is the time to do so.

I am all about two things, prix fixe menus and demanding ""is this a date?"" of my companion.  Duchamp made these things happen.  Tuesday, prix fixe, $25.  Be there.  I was a bit sad that the special no longer encompasses the whole regular menu as it once did, but the selection is still more than suitable.   We started out with some cocktails, a dark and stormy for me, and something with skeleton in the name that I called Skeletor Juice for him.  Nothing like a goblet of Skeletor Juice to make you feel manly.  My scallop starter was rich and lovely, a single scallop and parsnip puree accompanied by salty bacon and oyster mushrooms to counter the sweetness of the former.  It seemed on the small side, but in combination with my entree and the dessert, anything larger would have possibly split my pantaloons.  Boyfriend's salad was also lovely and sizable.  For entrees, he had the mushrooms risotto which wowed him and I polished off the half amish chicken which was juicy and flavorful and I really enjoyed the shaved brussels sprouts.  I would like to make those a part of my own culinary repertoire.  Finished off the evening with malted vanilla gelato, which was almost too rich, patted our bellies and rolled out the door.  What a nice cure for the cabin fever blues.

I started with the steak tartare, and it was superb.  Fresh, meaty, and topped with a raw egg and scallions.  This dish alone is worth a return visit.  For my main course, I had the beef tenderloin topped with mushroom bordelaise with a side of bacon wrapped asparagus.  The beef was delicious medium rare and the bordelaise added a wonderful earthy dimension to the meat.  For dessert, I had the chocolate cupcake, which provided a perfect bookend to the meal.  The chocolate was moist and the accompanying malted ice cream was rich and creamy - a close second to Longman & Eagle's malted cream. The service was excellent and managed our large group with aplomb.  We never had to wait long for drinks and they did not rush us while we were waiting for a couple of late arrivals.  Of course, why would they? We were ordering cocktails!  And the cocktail list was impressive.  I started with a refreshing rye Manhattan and moved on to one of their house cocktails - the Judge.  The Judge, like many of those presiding in the Daley Center, is a whiskey heavy concoction.  It combines Bulleit bourbon, the Dalmore single malt scotch, carpano antica, punt e mes, lillet blanc, Fee's old fashioned bitters, angostura bitters, and lemon essence.  (I am the king of cut and paste).  It was a deeply smoky cocktail that was restrained from going over the edge of murky syrup by the lillet blanc and lemon essence.  It has my highest recommendation to all of my noble bourbon boozers. I dug the wine list, as well.  Small, but well curated with an emphasis on terroir - old world style California, South American, and European wines.  The Beckman Chateauneuf du Pape offering, Cuvee le Bec, is pleasantly priced at $48.

When I go to Wicker Park I feel more out of place than a vegan at McDonalds, but for one night at Duchamp, I felt all my preconceptions disappear.  Duchamp is a friendly little gastro-pub located close to the Damen exit on the Kennedy. They have a valet, but my boo and I found a nearby un-metered street spot at 9:30 on a Friday night (across the street from a bar with a giant Schlitz sign). Score! Duchamp was still jumping at 9:30 on a Friday night, and despite our easily made Open Table reservation we still had to hang around the bar for 10 minutes or more before our table was ready. I was impressed by the crowd at Duchamp. It was much more diverse than I thought it would be which was great and there was even a girl in white-face trying her hardest to look like Amy Winehouse (soooo 2007). Our hostess seemed more than a little frazzled by all the activity, but I didn't find our wait to be too objectionable, and I am notoriously impatient. Duchamp practices the abhorrent trend of communal seating. To paraphrase Bill Mahr, eating at a table with complete strangers was something that should have stopped in the first grade. I have to admit, I thought the communal seating would be a lot worse than it was. Sure we were seated next to the obligatory downtown finance guy, but his schmohawky demeanor and faux-foody-ism ended up just being fodder for my boo and I to make fun of on the drive home. Sure, the downtown finance guy's drunken blonde date actually fell on me as she was trying to sit down, but at least we got to see how attentive the staff was. Even though communal seating wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it's still a bad idea. The place gets very loud. I could not really hear our server announce the specials (which certainly does not tempt me to try them), and I probably would have stayed for desert if our table had any feeling of intimacy. We started off our meal with a couple of cocktails and a plate of mussels. Duchamp has a great cocktail menu and handled our drink orders perfectly. The mussels were fantastic. Nice big mussels in a tasty broth and the perfect amount for a small plate. By far a great start and the best part of my meal. As you may or may not know, Food and Wine magazine published a list of the 25 best burgers in the country, and Duchamp was one of only two Chicago places to get picked. Naturally, I had to try this burger and my boo did too. Duchamp has a good burger, a nice thick flavorful piece of meat, topped with some amazing Havarti cheese, lettuce and tomato. It's a good, not great, burger, and I give minus two stars to Food and Wine for not doing more research. I have definitely had better burgers in Chicago (Branch 27 and Bad Apple are two that leap to mind). I would recommend this burger, but I think it was definitely over-hyped through no fault of Duchamp. My biggest criticism is that at a medium it was somewhat undercooked. I would recommend going a grade higher than you usually do if you decide to try the burger. I thought it was still delicious at medium but would order medium-well if I went back, and my boo was very disappointed with the burger and did not like the juices staining her bun red and making a mess of the plate.  I give Duchamp 3 stars, but a low 3 stars. The communal seating wasn't as bad as I thought it was, though like most adults, I prefer some privacy and intimacy when I go out to eat. I had no complaints price-wise and the service was fine. I do not see myself ever going back to Duchamp, but it's worth checking out for the experience.",0.9987,0.749,0.187,0.064,0.5527281746031746
2011-03-12,4.0,"My better half and I headed to Duchamp for dinner last night. After a rocky start, we had a great meal. We called and got a last-minute reservation, which was a pleasant surprise on a Friday night. We arrived at a frazzling time for the hostess, who seemed overwhelmed, but she rolled with it and apologized, making all the difference to me. We started with cocktails that both of us enjoyed. I asked about a bottle I'd never seen before, and unprompted the server brought me a sample. Great touch. My second cocktail wasn't nearly as enjoyable for me, but it was clearly a good, well-made cocktail. Just not my cuppa booze. We had the duck confit egg rolls to start and they were delicious. Really unique and yummy. As a roasted chicken fanatic, I had my heart set on theirs (with brussels sprouts? so up my alley). However, they had a special that night of roasted antelope loin, sweet potato puree and rabbit wellington with braised oxtail sauce. I wisely changed my mind and ordered that.  It was, to be blunt, fucking spectacular. Every single bite was a pleasure. My wife had the mussels and enjoyed them, and the side of fries was tasty and huge. Food-wise, my only semi-complaint was that the bread sucked. I say semi-complaint because this meant I didn't fill up on the bread like I seem evolutionarily programmed to do. The decor is really great in there. Cozy yet stylish and modern. Our server was excellent. I look forward to going back during patio season.",0.9972,0.721,0.256,0.023,0.660204081632653

2011-03-02,2.0,"After hearing such great things about Duchamp, I was eagerly anticipating a restaurant week dinner there with some friends. I am sad (and annoyed) to report that I was extremely disappointed with the entire experience. First things first...3 out of the 4 in our party arrived at 6:55 for our 7pm reservation and were told we could not be seated until our entire party arrived. No big deal as there were seats available at the bar. We grabbed some drinks and our 4th arrived at 7:10. We were then told by the hostess (in a condescending rude tone) that our table was not ready and we would be told when it was. Yeah, we know how restaurants work. We were just letting you know we were all here like you told us to. We were finally seated at 7:40. Our sever greeted us right away, noted we all already had drinks and said she would give us time to look over the menu. She then disappeared for 20 minutes. During this 20 minutes, we noticed that every table had bread except us. So, we finally flag her down and ask for bread as it is now 8pm and we are starving. Having to ask for bread or water is not something I like having to do in ""nice"" restaurants. On to the food...WTF Duchamp? It is not cool to post your restaurant week menu online and then change it up so much in house. Lobster bisque is NOT the same as chilled mint pea soup. There were a few other changes as well, but that one was the most annoying.  I will say I was pleasantly suprised to see that they had last minute added their burger as an entree choice. Food & Wine recently did their top 25 burgers in America and Duchamp was one of the only two listed in Chicago. However, this was only pleasant for a moment. I ordered my buger medium and upon immediately cutting it in half, found it to be extra rare. I sent it back and waited while the rest of my group ate their extremely small portioned meals. And waited...and waited...and waited some more. Our entire party finished and their plates were cleared before my burger came back out. I went to cut it in half and it completely fell apart. They had taken my original burger that I had already cut in half, cooked it more and put the two halves on a new bun. This seemed pretty tacky to me, however I wouldn't have minded if my burger had come back out in 5 minutes...NOT another 25 minutes. The burger itself was also only ""ok"". Certainly not one of the two best burgers in the city.   Back to bitching about things taking a ridiculously long time...why does it take a half hour to get our desserts when we all had gelato or sorbet?  Seriously, the entire evening was just one ridiculous, unnecessary wait. And when the food is mediocre, that wait just gets more annoying. Some things, like my friend's mussels (undercooked) and the caramel goat cheese gelato (worst aftertaste), weren't even mediocre-they were gross. Since I have already expressed my disdain for pretty much every aspect of this restaurant, let me just add that both the table chairs and the bar stools are extremely uncomfortable, not to mention ugly. Just like I don't want to have to ask for bread or water in a ""nice"" place, I also don't want to sit in a plastic chair. I would like to give Duchamp one star, but their chicken wings are some of the best damn chicken wings I have ever had.

2011-02-25,3.0,"So I went here for Restaurant Week with my best friend and my husband.  I think that we were all sad to say, that this place did not meet our expectations.   I started with the mixed green salad with a lemon vinaigrette with blue cheese and walnuts.  The dressing was light and tasty, but the cheese chunks were huge and not that well distributed.  I think that a dried cranberry would have have been a good addition to this salad. However, I really liked the dressing. I then got the fettuccine with goat cheese.  The pasta looked like it was fresh and homemade which was nice but it was quite al dente.  Though I did enjoy that the pasta was not covered in cheese (like you get at the OG) and it had a nice addition of fennel and roasted red peppers.  It just was not all that memorable. The pesto sauce was fresh and not too overbearing.  The portion was nicely sized as well.  I got the blood orange sorbet for dessert.  It was definitely yummy but nothing spectacular.  I tried my friend's goat cheese and caramel sorbet.  The waitress promised us it would taste like cheesecake.  While it was good, it did not taste like cheesecake.  My husband got literally the smallest cupcake known to man. The place is cute, the staff was pretty nice. Our waitress was pretty quick but she didn't really make an impression on us.  I felt like we didn't get much from the wait staff.  I don't think that I would go back to try their regular menu, I think that I would rather try other places in the city for more interesting food.  It makes me sad that we were all disappointed.

2011-02-23,3.0,"BF and I came here for restaurant week.  We live in the neighborhood and had always wanted to come here, but being a block away from the Bristol basically guaranteed we would never make it (alas, Bristol always wins in the end...)  So I decided to plan for it this time, Restaurant Week giving me the perfect opportunity. I agree with the other Yelpers that the face-in-velvet-curtain thing was a bit odd, but being a person of cold-blood (salamander... see above) I appreciate extra insulation from the freezing winds. We had to wait a few minutes for our table which was fine, and thankfully we were seated in the rear dining room, as the front room was exceedingly crowded and noisy. Now, for the food.  I ordered the steak tartare, the tenderloin, and the sorbet (a lot of beef, I'm aware).  BF ordered the mixed greens salad, the half chicken, and the gelato.  The steak tartare was yummy, pretty standard, although the portion size was tiiiiny.  Serving the tartare with the egg yolk on top instead of mixed in was striking, but I'd prefer to not have to prepare my own food at the table.  The tenderloin was tasty, although also a tiny portion, and a touch underseasoned, but the temperature was spot on.  I subbed out brussels sprouts for the asparagus, as asparagus in February is an abomination, more on that in another review....  The brussels sprouts were ok, a little lacking in flavor and texture, but they weren't overcooked, so that's something.  The mashed potatoes were good, although they were somewhat unpleasantly toeing the line between whipped and smashed, aka, slightly lumpy.  The sorbet was ""blood orange"" but tasted exactly like bargain brand orange sherbet.  Not that there's anything wrong with bargain brand orange sherbet, I'm just sayin. BF's salad was tasty, pretty standard, all in all.  The chicken was really quite good, tender, juicy, flavorful, which is a feat in itself.  The chicken was the original home of the brussels sprouts, see above.  The rosemary potatoes were also quite tasty, although fairly boring.  I make rosemary potatoes at home all the damn time, so a resto could stand to take it up a notch.  The turkish coffee gelato was good, tastes exactly like Breyer's coffee ice cream (that's a good thing) but BF doesn't care for ice cream (why'd he order gelato, you ask?  the only other option was a cupcake, which to him is anathema) Overall:  I'm confused about the name choice.  At first I assumed it was called DuChamp to invoke the Dada artist, Marcel DuChamp (ceci n'est pas une pipe, anyone?) and that the restaurant would be uber modern, avant garde, and even somewhat surrealist.  As you can read above from the menu items, zis is not ze case.  It was pretty much standard new american, not even particularly rustic.  The only modern thing about the restaurant was the ghost chairs, which honestly, I feel are pretty played out... To reiterate:  Bristol is ONE BLOCK AWAY.  If in the area and craving some tasties, for the love of criminy crickets, go to Bristol.  You'll thank me.",0.9969,0.766,0.17,0.063,0.5130094043887148

Absolute highlights were the steak tartar and the gelato.  Both were some of the best I've had.  The pate was one of my least favorite pates I've had, and my burger and fries were just average.  I think had the prices been significantly lower I might have felt differently, but they are charging downtown prices for mediocre fare on the far north end of Bucktown.",0.5624,0.875,0.073,0.052,0.6315972222222223
2011-02-15,2.0,"Located in Lincolnpark 2.0.. I mean Wicker Park/Bucktown, Duchamp is situated in a charming vintage corner storefront. Enter  through the wooden front door and youll come face to face with a disorienting wall of  velvet curtain that hides a dark cozy restaurant within.. We arrived early and were seated at the long communal table (which has its pro's and con's). The maitre d was polite and took our coats and our waitress was nicely attentive and we did not feel rushed. She complimented the bartender's creativity, which sold us on cocktails and overall we felt the service was pretty unpretentious and well run.  Appetizers were steak tartar with egg yolk and the duck rillet. The steak tartar was good but not memorable - the duck rillet was very tasty. However I think it would be a good idea to NOT serve the same bread 3 times over in appetizers. First they brought out the loaf with butter (boring butter like the ""european"" kind youd buy at TJ's with a sprinkling of chopped herbs) Then both the tartar and the rillet were served with the same boring italian slices. Carb overload - it would be nice if they served the apps with a different way, different bread, chip - SOMETHING that would make me want to pay for two additional apps..  The cocktails we ordered were indeed creative - I love St. Germain, and I love creative elixirs - but for 12 dollars a pop to only have a intsy tinsy drink that fit into nothing more than a glorified shot glass was a bit disappointing. The main entres were the boring acorn squash over radicchio drowned in oil stuffed with your basic rice mixed with cheese and some wild mushrooms. The mushrooms owned the flavor and that I liked since im a mushroom lover. Next was the special - rabbit wellington served over some sort of salty sauce and ironically with minced carrots and peas. The rabbit loins were wrapped together with wild mushrooms in puff pastry that was a bit soggy/oily. The mushrooms again dominated and were very very flavorful, the loin was succulent and wonderful. Standout dish, albeit small and garnished with unedible pieces of carrot. The acorn dish was 15 dollars which I think is pushing it for something so basic and cheap to make, and the rabbit dish took the cake for being overpriced at 35 dollars!  We finished up with a basic creme brulee whose standouts were the tiny infused madelines as garnishes and an orange glaze. Very good!  Honestly for best value at this place, get the burger and a beer.  ----------Next is my 02 cents so you may want to stop here.  Look I don't mind spending money on a nice meal but coming to Duchamp exemplified what I think  so very wrong with the general dining scene (and my experiences)  in Chicago at the moment - its like any restaurant deemed to be located in the ""hip"" suburbans-returning-to-the-city neighborhoods has some sort of excuse to stop trying (like the god awful 3 flat mediocre architecture condos that have decimated this neighborhoods character)  to really serve great food at acceptable prices. I dont understand how restaurants in this area dare to all generally charge upwards of 22 dollars a plate and really not serve anything creative or inspiring. But i suppose thats because the clientele they attract are the trendy, look now we live in the city types that propogate some commercial sense of well-this-cost-me-so-much-it-must-be-good attitude. It really irks me especially since Ive seen this neighborhood at its peak.  The clientele at Duchamp that filled in the seats around us were kinda snooty - wearing obnoxious gems and talking about real estate. Not that its wrong but its like sometimes it seemed like people were trying to talk loud to blow themselves up a little, to make themselves ""seen"" by the others seated at the communal tables. Yea I get it you are probabbly living in those god awful condos now in the ""hip"" Wicker Park - the neighborhood is dead.  Though I enjoyed the music earlier in the night when someone put on Mount Kimbie.  Generally the scene here is for snooty neuvo riche suburban Ohio transplant types who get that ""cool"" haircut and carry themselves like H&M styled hipsters.

Mixed greens salad - Lovely fresh greens, nice bold blue cheese, a refreshing dish to start out meal off. East meets west wings - I was too intrigued by this small plate appetizer not to order it, and I'm glad I did.  It was 5-6 wings with a spicy Asian (think chili oil meets sweet and sour), thick peanut sauce, and a bit of bbq.  A superb combination of flavors, complex, but not overwhelming.  The menu stated that it came with a wasabi mayo, but I didn't see it with our dish...not that it needed it.  And the coleslaw that accompanied this dish was amazing! Linguini with ox tail - This was our least favorite in our meal.  The sauce was just too sweet to do justice to the ox tail.  There were nice cuts of tender oxtail, but it thought the sauce just overpowered this dish, and it just seemed like it lacked the depth and richness of a good Italian pasta sauce.  I paired this dish with a glass of the mencia, which was a very nice dark, medium bodied, dry, old world style red.  Acorn squash stuffed with mushroom risotto - This dish was the hit of the night!  The risotto was simply delicious, creamy wild mushrooms.  The radicchio, and endives were a nice touch.  I would highly recommend this dish if you don't mind going with a vegetarian option.

What better night to do it than a Tuesday night with their fantastic $25 three-course offering. While they do not offer their full menu for this deal any longer, the options are plentiful. My lovely lady-date and I ordered in tandem and started with the mixed baby green salad and the flatbread. The salad was good and did the trick of making me feel less bad about ordering the later rounds, but the flatbread stole the show for the starters. The cheese and proscuitto came together in perfect harmony on that delightful pizza creation and we gobbled every last bite. Perfection. For our entrees, we shared the havarti cheese burger and the Amish chicken. The burger? Definitely one of the better burgers I have enjoyed in a very long time. Cooked perfectly with the right amount of toppings, even the leftover burger (eaten cold by my boyfriend the next day), was drool-worthy. And don't even get my carb-loving self started on my love of the fries. Fantastic. Truly. The chicken was marvelous as well. Tender, juicy and dripping in the juices from the pan, there was none of that leftover to take home. The desserts are served in bite-sized pieces which is the perfect amount for two overly indulged girls. The darling little homemade ice cream sandwich was the standout there, by far. Drinks were delectable, both red wine (the Notro...yum) and the ""Bonfire of the Vanities""...a margarita-like concoction that simultaneously warms the gullet and takes your mind away to sea-soaked breezes and hammocks. Do not miss a drink here. Trust me. Service is stellar (props to the lovely Laurel), providing helpful suggestions, laid-back pacing and an overall fantastic knowledge of the menu.

My sister and I visited on one of the price fixed menu nights....we thought it would be a good deal...$25 for a three course dinner (most menu items included). The fixed menu was great and we were able to try a number of the items (all delicious!). The drink menu, however, was quite pricey. A glass of sparking started at $12 and the least expensie wine was still $10. I know this isn't out of line for the city, but based upon pretty reasonable food prices, I was surprised at how expensive the drinks were. We were done with dinner and had spent basically the same amount on alcohol as we did for food! The atmosphere was great. This would be an excellent date spot. The communal tables don't make you feel packed in and I still felt like we had our own space. Large groups may make the spot a bit rambuncious (spell?), but overall, it was a nice space.  Service was really great. We were recommended food (though, to be honest, I'm sure all of the good is great).",0.994,0.772,0.221,0.007,0.6208638583638584

Duchamp kept me warm and set the mood.   Not only did they have a covered door way but they had thick ceiling to floor curtains at the entrance to block out Chicago's bitter cold December night.  My girlfriends and I cozied up to a long wooden communal table with clear plastic chairs-chic and comfort combined.  This theme would again emerge in their food.   Duchamp paid attention.   Our glasses were always refilled with water.  The server even came around to empty our beer bottles into our glasess for us every now and then which I appreciated even though I'm a drink-out-of-the-bottle kind of girl.  Chef Allen Sternweiler came by to make sure that our meals were to our liking.  Nice touch! Duchamp knew what I liked. We dined on a Tuesday night which is when they offer a 3-course $25 prix-fixe dinner.  Sophisticated comfort food in an American-French bistro done right. Start with the east meets west hot-wings with soy mayo.  Think crunchy hot and sour wings with a touch of honey.  I thank Julie R. for sharing.  My other girlfriend liked saucy wings so much that she began dipping the bread in the soy mayo. I had the braised beef cheek stew with brown buttered spaetzle.  Nommy nom nom.  Could have been more tender but the flavor with the red wine reduction was richly delicious without being too heavy.  Our trio of  desserts included an icecream sandwich with vanilla gelato-light, nutty, and fun (this was my favorite!), lemon tart with a delicoius flaky and buttery crust, and a mini chocolate cupcake topped with chocolate buttercream-this was a bit dense, more like a brownie textured cupcake packed with chocolate yumminess.    Needless to say, I left satisfied yet at the same time, wanting for more.",0.9957,0.789,0.184,0.027,0.5561791383219955
2010-12-06,4.0,"We ate at Duchamp with a party of 11 on a busy Saturday night with 9PM reservations. The restaurant is pretty small and only has two tables that can accommodate a party this large, and they were both occupied past our reservation time by lingering large parties that had earlier reservations. Therefore, we ended up sitting about 40 minutes later for our reservation. During the delay the front house staff were accommodating and did a good job of managing our expectations. Comp'ing us for some drinks at the bar and providing free appetizers for the party while we waited. After dinner they gave us a comp'ed glass of prosecco as well. Everyone in our party really felt we were taken care of and were impressed how things were handled. The server did a great job handling the large party and was very attentive. No snootiness, snobbiness that other reviewers have alleged, and at the end of the night they were more then willing to allow us to split payment across several cards.  We really liked the unique cocktails including the Simca (a gin, chartreuse, grapefruit and bitters based drink) and The Judge (scotch, bourbon, and what seemed like twenty other ingredients). The wine list was well priced and had some unique selections covering old / new world and there were generous per glass options. Don't be in a rush when ordering a cocktail, some of these drinks have so many ingredients they take a little while to make. The food was overall good, with some standouts and some that didn't meet the mark. All 11 of our party raved over the wings, the burger, the fries and a special entree of swordfish with lentils and an ox-tail sauce. Dishes that didn't work as expected were the rillettes and tartare (primarily the complaint was that the crostini were so oily they overpowered the flavor of each appetizer.) The special linguine with clams was deemed way too salty by all 11 of us. Prices seemed reasonable at this strata of restaurant and our total bill for Dinner averaged $48 per person with three bottles of wine and sharing appetizers and entrees.  Duchamp's service, ambiance, cocktails and food make it a worthy neighbor to the other trendy restaurants in the area (The Bristol, Ruxbin.) It is an ideal place to go for a unique drink, some wings and a burger. If you are looking for other entrees / appetizers ask the server what is popular as some of the entrees were better than others.  Duchamp takes reservations and is available on  opentable.com  (The Bristol and Ruxbin do not take reservations) so you can avoid a long wait in the Wicker Park / Bucktown area.",0.9961,0.821,0.157,0.022,0.5558982683982684
2010-12-04,4.0,"So I went to this restaurant ont he recommendation of a close friend. I went with my boyfriend and parents on a Friday night. The place was busy, but we only waited the estimated 20 minutes.  The bartender was friendly and quick to offer suggestions when they did not have the gin I usually drink. His suggestions were great and he offered reasoning for not having my particular gin. Unfortunately he forgot to ask my Beau what he wanted the first time around. Also, my parents ordered Pinot Grigio and received two different kinds of wine (not bad wine, just two different wines) each time. We seated in the very back and the lamp had to be unplugged in order for us to sit down at the table. Our server was quick to bring extra candles until the situation was remideed.  We at the mussels simmered in white wine with garlic and shallots and the artisanal cheese plate with seasonal homemade garnishes, fresh fruit and toast points for an appetizers. Both were awesome! For dinner I ate the sautéed rainbow trout over wilted spinach with lemon, capers, mushrooms and yukon potatoes. It was perfectly cooked and a fantastic choice. My father had bouillabaisse of grouper, mussels, calamari, shrimp, potatoes, basil and house cured tomatoes simmered in saffron-shellfish broth, and my boyfriend had the grilled beef tenderloin with potato, onion and goat cheese tart. Everything was made exceptionally well.  For dessert there was the night's gelato special. We were only brought out one bowl. After looking at each other a little puzzled, we decided to share. Then, after we had finished, our server brought out a bowl for everyone and apologized.  This was a bit on the pricey side, but well worth every penny. All in all it was a fantastic evening.

Despite the needy group seated near us, our server was incredibly attentive and service never failed. He had some great drink suggestions. I started out with a St.Germain based cocktail and he had a glass of Malbec. We ordered four small plates, but really, should've just stuck with 3. We had the scallops, burger, and the duck rillette and a side of the brussel sprouts. Every dish was fantastic and had bold flavors.

2010-11-08,4.0,"We had attended the Steppenwolf matinee production of 'Detroit' so it was very early (5pm) when we arrived at Duchamp.  What struck me most initially was the music playing, the latest CD of The National followed by The Black Keys.  I have to be honest, I was underwhelmed by the menu. I normally am able to narrow my focus down to 2-3 dishes very easily and then will make my decision from there. I was having a hard time with this menu, just not a lot of choices. Turns out if a restaurant executes well, not having a lot of choices isn't such a bad thing. For some reason I feel I had heard/read about the havarti burger. Turns out in Chicago Magazine - Feb 2009 edition they stated: Under a puffy dill bun and a melt of Havarti, the four-inch-tall hunk of three freshly ground meats (including filet mignon) weighs in at eight glorious ounces. Duchamp's burger is the juiciest, the beefiest, and the best we've had in ages. Alas I didn't choose the burger. We had a delicious bottle of Pinot Grigio by Canaletto, seeing as Sunday is 50% off bottles of wine day at Duchamp, our bottle was $22 Our starters: seared diver scallop with butter poached gnocchi, seasonal mushrooms and finished with black truffle. DELICIOUS and so rich! steak tartare w/egg yolk, served w/traditional garnishes of cornichon, mustard, capers and paprika. One doesn't see steak tartare often, this was a good one. Our mains: bouillabaisse of grouper, mussels, calamari, shrimp, potatoes, basil and house cured tomatoes simmered in saffron-shellfish broth. The seafood was not overcooked in this bouillabaisse, the broth was salty but Mrs Sweet Willie likes salt so she was happy. roast amish chicken breast with escargot whipped potatoes, slow roasted fennel and rustic pan sauce. Breast was skin on, seared in a very hot pan so there was a nice crust, keeping the meat juicy. Escargot potatoes were unique, the escargot really didn't add anything IMO. The oops of the night was the fennel, it was not slow roasted but quartered and put on a grill. The result was a blackened grill mark piece of fennel that was not cooked at all. The fact that the chicken and jus were so well done, I was able to forgive this faux pas. We were too full for dessert.

When we made our reservation we asked them to do a tasting dinner for us because we like to have no menu when we sit down and just be surprised.

The chef started us with a trio of tartares, one steak, one tuna and one lobster... great start. Then we were served a sea scallop over gnocchi (amazing gnocchi) in a truffle herbed butter sauce which was a knock out.  Next was fois gras over porcini mushroom risotto sitting on a tiny pumpkin with honey vanilla sauce that was outstanding.  Then we split large plates of their ""pork & beans"" and ""steak & eggs"".

2010-09-25,4.0,"We made a reservation on Yelp (super easy) and had a 7 pm Saturday night table.  The decor is very modern and nicely stated; I appreciate how the wood in the floors matches up to the wood in the communal tables.  Everything indoors is dark and romantic, and the music is very modern/alt eclectic - it went from The National to Sleigh Bells to hip hop, all over the place.  The food was very solid.  Whoever complained below about the small portions, I don't know what they are talking about.  Maybe they should get their eyes and/or stomachs checked because jeeze, after our appetizers, we were both giving each other pep talks about finishing our entrees! My boyfriend started with the lamb meatballs, and I got the duck rilettes.  Both were plated beautifully - his with an incredible colorful presentation, and mine more understated and natural.  The meatballs came with garnishes of crispy (read: fried) feta, olives, tomatoes, and an herbal sauce.  It was delicious.  I kept dipping hunks of the awesome soft, plump bread they bring you before your meal into that green sauce.  I also maybe stole a few olives. The rilettes came with a thick layer of duck fat and orange (or lemon?) peel zested on top.  I love duck fat, but there was a LOT of duck fat sealing in the juicy rilettes.  I scraped most of it off with my knife, leaving only a few flecks to help flavor the meat.  Not that it needed it.  They were fork-tender and rich, but not so rich that they turned my stomach.  The rilettes come with crispy buttery toasted bread, but I preferred them with the complimentary soft table bread.  The combination of the fatty rilettes with the buttery toast was just a bit TOO rich for my tastes.  Many restaurants serve rilettes this way; I wish they'd cut back on the grease present in the bread and serve drier crackers or crostini so that the flavor and the fat in the rilettes can show through. For dinner, my boyfriend had the signature ""steak and eggs"".  Outstanding.  The steak was flavorful and cooked perfectly to his preference.  The eggs were sunny side up, which was odd but worked with the dinner (I just think any eggs for dinner are weird but hey, it works at Duchamp).  It also came with this potato and goat cheese tart. The entire thing was tasty, but a little pricey at $25. I ordered the burger ($13), a more economical buy and perhaps Duchamp's other ""signature"" offering.  It was a decent, but not great, burger.  It was slightly overdone from my preference, and the toppings were a little off putting.  There was just so much sauce on the burger.  Something on the burger - maybe the cheese, maybe one of the many sauces it came with - smelled ""off"".  Sort of like old socks off.  It tasted delicious, but the smell often knocked me back in my chair.  Perhaps it was the cheese, though I've never known Havarti to have a more Roquefort kind of vibe going for it.   The fries were not very good.  I feel Duchamp could be more creative with their side here; the fries were the standard ""restaurant"" dressed-up kind, but where they attempted to get high class they ended up sort of failing.  They were overfried, empty inside of most of the potato, and topped with unnecessary shredded parmesan.  The dipping sauces included ketchup and a truffle mayonaise; both fine, but again, a little overdone.  It was a disappointment; Duchamp simply shone with their restraint in their appetizers and the steak & eggs; the burger could benefit from similar restraint.  There's a good burger in there, if they just pull a Coco Chanel and removed one or two things before sending it out from the kitchen. Overall it wasn't a bad experience.  I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but since Yelp only works in whole numbers I will round up to 4.  The service was very good.  Prompt with water refills and plate clearing, and the food came out quickly and correctly.  We never felt rushed.  At one point the owner/manager stopped by to talk to us.  We felt appreciated as guests and overall, we definitely enjoyed our dinner.  If Duchamp can rein in their burger a bit, and improve their fries, I believe they will have a truly great restaurant in Chicago.",0.9967,0.811,0.136,0.053,0.5254107477887965

She wanted to dine al fresco, and as neither of us had eaten at Duchamp, AND, they have that gorgeous patio, I made some late afternoon reservations.  It was a lovely summer afternoon, warm, a bit cloudy.  The patio is beautiful -- long communal tables with wicker chairs.  Protected from the street.  Perfect.   We ordered a bottle of rose, which was new for her.  We both loved it.  And, we shared several small plates.  First, seared diver scallop with ragout of cannellini beans & pancetta -- perfectly cooked and seasoned scallop (wish there was more than one), and love, love, love the cannellini beans.  Pancetta is essentially bacon.  Nuff said.   Second, mini braised duck rillette tartines & chilled cauliflower puree & hazelnuts.  Great duck rillette -- they are very generous with the rillette on each tartine.  Excellent accompaniments as well, and very tasty. Third, the gazpacho (I forget exactly what all was in it.....tortilla strips, some small tomatoes).  Very refreshing....and, there was a tanginess that we couldn't initially identify (it's fresh fennel).  The rose went very well with it.   Lastly, we had the special caprese salad with bufalo mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes.  Ding ding ding, big winner.  The tomatoes were meaty and fresh and delicious.  Probably the best caprese-style salad that I've ever had, and I think my date would agree.   We also had a bowl of the house marinated olives, which were fantastic, and, honestly, provided enough saltiness for each of the plates we ordered.   About halfway through our experience, it began to rain.  We tried to stick it out, but Mother Nature had other thoughts.  The restaurant was very gracious and moved everyone inside.  We finished our meal at the end of another communal style table next to a window.  As we were finishing, Chef Michael Taus came out and sat with us and chatted for a bit.  He was honestly interested in our feedback on the dishes...and, he asked if I was Filipino (which I am), mentioned his wife is as well, and we talked about Asian food!  (I promised to bring him lumpia and noodles the next time my caterer mother does a job).   All in all, I really enjoyed my experience at Duchamps.  It's not cheap, but it's not terribly expensive.  Our meal was delicious, and I love the farm-to-table concept, which gives us such fresh ingredients.  We did not have dessert here (sorry, Chef, we snuck down the street to another joint), but I'm looking forward to trying the lemon tart when we return.  There's something for everyone here; and I highly recommend that my readers try Duchamp when you can; you will not regret it.

For the small plates, I ordered the lamb meatballs with feta and he had the wings. The super tender meatballs combined with the feta and pesto was just delicious, super delicious. I got to try one of his wings and I must say that the sauce is addicting, I'm craving one now just typing about them.  For the large plates, I ordered the sea bass in coconut curry sauce. It was almost soup like. The flavors were amazing; lemongrass, sprouts, shrimp, mussels in addition to the sea bass and curry. I highly recommend this dish! My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. He ordered the steak medium and it was cooked perfectly. The 'eggs' part was a bacon quiche. The crust was light and buttery and the filling had a great smoky bacon flavor.

2010-05-19,2.0,"After seeing a nice mention of the patio here in TimeOut, and getting a special request to dine someplace pretty and relaxing, I opted to book a reservation at Duchamp.  I feel like pretty is exactly what I got, and not much else. The servers were attractive and uber-hip but icy cold and more interested in getting the bill taken care of expediently than providing suggestions or making us feel welcome in the least. While she didn't ever talk about specials, offer any tips or provide any guidance on the menu, our waif-like waitress must have asked five times about the bill, as if she was worried we were going to bolt at any minute without paying. I think we got water a few times from James Spader circa Less Than Zero. Seating is communal, which is fine, but when we asked if we could sit at one of the less crowded tables, the hostess looked at me kind of like I'd asked if I could shake a baby really hard. When I asked a busser if we could maybe get our candle lit, he responded wordlessly and seemed really miffed, and from then on, it seemed like every time something arrived at the table, it got slammed down. I thought this place was named after Marcel Duchamp, not Marcel Marceau (buhdumpdump)! The food was, in general, beautifully presented and well-written (menu-wise) but remarkably flavorless. The Seared Sea Scallop with Ragout of Cannellini Beans & Pancetta was small and unimpressive but blanketed in a thick layer of salad, the Sautéed Potato-Ricotta Gnocchi was criminally bland and overly doughy, and the lobster pizza had all the flavor of a storebought Boboli crust (again, covered in salad) with a couple tough chunks of what tasted suspiciously like that fake crab meat that's always on sale at Jewel. Even had the food been inexpensive (it wasn't), I would have been disappointed. In the end, they delivered what few leftovers we had in precious little faux-chinese takeout boxes. We couldn't figure out how they got the lobster pizza in there until we correctly guessed that they had smushed it down into the box - another example of how Duchamp is all form over substance. Then again, maybe that's the point. I mean, Duchamp hung a urinal on a wall and called it art. Maybe Duchamp is putting mediocre food and crappy service on the table as a statement. Hmmm...  Anyway, having recently dined at similarly hipstery gastropub/small-plate joints like Longman and Eagle, the Bristol, Sable, and the Publican, I can honestly say that this place isn't even in the same class as far as flavor, service or ambience, purty porch and all.

2010-05-08,3.0,"Some restaurants you just really want to love.  The sleek modern room at Duchamp and the contemporary French cuisine cooked up by Michael Taus  had us rubbing our hands together eagerly, but things got weird right away when we were seated at a communal table elbow to elbow with a pair of strangers.   They were decent enough sorts and we chatted amicably with them but it wasn't what we would've chosen.  Nor were any of the other diners offered any choice, for Duchamp is all communal seating.  Unless your party happens to have exactly the right number of diners, you are likely to be seated with strangers. Communal tables are the hot restaurant feature of the moment, and when done in an ambiance that lends itself to the concept, such as a German restaurant or a chowder house, they're okay.  But an intimate French restaurant is not the place to be pushing strangers together.   A couple came in and took the seats to our left, fidgeted a bit, briefly discussed how this was not what they had expected and left.  I've got to believe that this is going to hurt Duchamp, which is a shame because some of the dishes they offer are terrific and should not be missed. The mini braised duck rillette tartines & chilled cauliflower puree is out of this world.  The lobster bisque is captivating.  And the citrus-roasted beet salad is so much more than a beet salad; it's a wonderful medley of mâche, marcona almonds, mint and a particularly tasty French feta.  The only problem with these exquisite small plates is the lack of adequate space to put them in. Given the heavy emphasis on small plates, the communal seating idea is a hindrance.  We were grateful that the other couple had left.  Our three small plates and bread dish had advanced well beyond the confines of our narrow frontier and were well into neighboring territory.  Had that space been occupied I can imagine border skirmishes breaking out.    The problem could be avoided by skipping the small plates and concentrating on large plates but that would be missing the best part of Duchamp.  Our large plates didn't measure up.  A pork shoulder was good but all the flavors just kind of fused together and left nothing much to shout about.  The French ham & gruyère croque monsieur with housemade giardiniera was remarkable for its lack of distinction.  The bread employed was soft and crumbly, not toasted and crunchy as one would expect, and the gruyere was somehow working at cross-purposes with the ham, producing something strikingly uninteresting.    Yet the house recommended wine was first rate and the service was very good.  Moreover, the prices were reasonable given the type of fare being offered.  But the inconsistencies in the level of food quality and the discomforting communal seating arrangement prevented Duchamp from being all the restaurant we had hoped it would be. We had gone in hoping to love it but came away discussing ways that it could be improved.  Small plates with a French flare is a great concept, and Duchamp has all the elements in place to make it work.  Now they just need to provide a comfortable setting in which to enjoy it.",0.9951,0.79,0.15,0.06,0.4559561602418745

Such a phrase when uttered conjures up images of guys going crazy, hitting on women, playing poker smoking cigars, watching the game and of course the ubiquitous plethora of booze.  Well one two out of five ain't bad.  Duchamp does earn four solid stars out of five from me though. My friend Jeff and I came in, excited and slightly buzzed, (Violet Hour was before hand), and having hearing some rave reviews from my favorite yelpers and clients, I couldn't wait to start.  Our waitress was wonderful and certainly informative and helpful. Twice she was spot on with wine recommendations and was more than happy to offer her recommendations. The space is slightly dark. Yes, the tables aren't fancy, but the mood is perfect for a group of friends as well as cozy date. Well, Jeff and I were on a man date if you will, but there was merely a lust for some good food which Duchamp delivered on quite well.  For starters we went with the East meets West Wings, which had a tasty, although freaking hot, (temperature hot), glaze on them. Once they cooled down a little bit, the slightly sweet and lovely mix of spices seeped into our taste buds. Although I was slightly perplexed about the aioli, I was far from confused that this was a tasty dish. The duck rillettes were tasty and delicious, nearly stopping my heart out of sheer joy. The special small plate of charcoal grilled octopus was great as well. First cooked over a grill, soaking up the smokiness, then chilled and served perfectly tender over a crustini which soaked up some house made giardinara. Let me tell you, when you bite in to that crusty soaked in piece of bread, delicious doesn't even cross your mind. Heart attack inducing and delicious does. But again, I ain't complaining.  Then we hit the mains, my friend went with the bouillabaisse which made me green with envy. The rich broth filled with mussels, Chilean sea bass and rock shrimp, why just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate! My tender and falling apart pork shoulder with polenta and puttanesca was heavenly. As filling as all of this was, (and really we should have stopped there), but alas... we couldn't. Dessert was calling us by name! Well the ice cream sandwiches and cupcakes were along with a scotch, (or few) for my friend and a few swigs of moscato for I. Yes, we wobbled out of there stuffed and schlitzed, but we left with not only a soon to be raging head ache the next morning, but also a longing to go back.

I decided to go with the french toast with lemon marscapone and Nutella, he went with the Italian skillet.  Since we had to spend $40 for the Groupon, we also ordered the garlic and romano cheese french fries and apple smoked bacon.  I've put off writing this review a bit because I was waffling between 3 and 4 stars, but I have to say the only item that really stood out was the bacon.  Which was fabulous.  Perfectly cooked, not too fatty, not burned...just awesome.  My french toast was good (how is Nutella ever NOT good?) but I wasn't blown away.  I tried the Italian skillet, date liked it but I thought the french toast was definitely better.  The garlic cheese fries were really disappointing; I found them very bland and in need of more...something, as it stood they just tasted like potatoes.

First up: white pizza with lobster for me and duck for him. Deceptively simple - just flatbread, lobster, cheese, and vinaigrette - the lobster pizza was one of the best seafood items consumed in our fair city. While both dishes were tasty, I clearly won this round as my pizza was quite large for an appetizer and (hello!) lobster beats all.  Second Course: I went with the Thai Bouillabaisse - sea bass, bok choy, and mussels in a savory broth. I ate every last bit and just barely stopped short of tipping up my bowl and slurping down the last bits of broth. Mr Lovebird had good things to say about his eggplant dish.  Dessert: A selection of mini items: an ice cream sandwich, heart-shaped cookie, chocolate cupcake, and lemon (?) tart. The tart was good, but just not my thing (I'm relatively anti-lemon).

2010-02-06,3.0,"Sometimes you want a $1 McChicken, and sometimes you want a gourmet burger. There are your usual spots, like Kuma's, Hamburger Mary's, Epic Burger, etc, but then there are unexpected places. Duchamp is one of them. So apparently their burger is one of the best, according to Chicago Magazine. They're right. Truly, it's hard to f up a burger, but Duchamp executed it well, down to the foofy presentation. But that's ok. I was really impressed by the size of the burger... HUGE, I only ate half (and just finished the other half...), cooked medium rare perfectly, fresh toppings, and a tasty little pile of giant fries to help clog the arteries a tad more, all washed down with a Fin du Monde. I really do want to go back and try their other dishes, as well as see how their wine pairings fare.  I really enjoyed the decor, the giant, heavy curtains reminded me of Violet Hour, and the dark wood and soft lighting created a very date-like ambience. As for the communal eating style: we went there late on a weeknight, and it wasn't that full... so we had our own table. It kind of seems counter-intuitive, non? I mean, why bother with the romantic atmosphere and jam couples together? Eh. didn't get it. Oddly, though, the two things that really ""did"" it for me were the creme brulee and music. I absolutely LOVE creme brulee, and theirs is one of the best I've ever had. They even honored my weird request to over brulee it a little (big fan of the crunchy caramelized sugar on top!).  I'm a fan. Three stars b/c I just don't get the communal eating thing.",0.9974,0.736,0.243,0.021,0.5221816378066378

We walked in at 7pm on a Wednesday and there were only 6 other people in the place, so we got seated right away. Right when we got seated, the waters were poured and the fresh bread and butter was brought out. The bread was really good and the butter was a little garlic-y, which was very tasty. I already knew I was going to get the burger, but my wife wanted some type of seafood and even though the menu is small, they have great choices. She ended up getting the escargot and the special of the night, which was mussels. When I took my first bite of the burger, it tasted and felt just like a Wendy's burger and I was really hoping for it to get better. I switched it up to the deliciously-seasoned fries and then went back to the burger. It definitely tasted better, but one of the best burgers...it is not. I would take Five Guys in a second over Duchamp. Since I am allergic to seafood, I didn't try my wife's food, but she said it was delicious. We don't usually get dessert, but we were in the mood tonight. There were two that looked really good, so we asked the waiter what to pick and he told us to go with the ice cream sandwiches and cupcakes. I would go back here JUST for this.

2010-01-16,4.0,"Small plates, large plates, drinks and appetizers in a trendy, detailed to the max restaurant. No detail is too small. Look around. Outside their entrance door is a tented door system which is the first in trying to keep out the cold air. Once you enter you walk through a heavy dark colored curtain which is draped around the entrance, the second wave in cold protection which adds a bit of mystery to entering. It's drafty in this space and the cold seems to move about the room rampantly, you may like to keep your jacket on. Sadly the warmest space is the restroom for one. It's so nice and warm inside (and when I said earlier that every detail is covered) take a look anywhere. You need a few minutes to just sit and soak in the decor and atmosphere. Something for everything, for example after having a salad or appetizer, they bring you fresh flatware. (Instead of the usual practice at most places, they place the used flatware on the table. Ew.) Extra plates sit a top the table in case you want to share. The comfortable plastic molded chairs, the long wooden buffet type tables, and even the kitschy lighting. Interesting, cute for a date or meeting your girlfriends.  The food. I was looking for their brunch or the famed burger. I wished summer was here, so I could sit in their nice garden seating and have brunch. Instead we sat inside, ordered a cocktail, two burgers which came with garlic & Romano cheese fries and an order of crispy Asian wings with soy mayo. For those that can't look at the amply provided photos, their Havarti cheeseburger burger and food in general is all done in gourmet presentation. For me the burger was just okay, a full serving \ a huge chunk of burger smothered in tasty cheese and a toasted bun. I couldn't taste any seasoning in the meat and the sandwich dressing they put atop it was plain Jane. Fries were served hot and were tasty to even the next day when it was reheated. Asian wings were interesting, if you like the flavors of soy or Saki sauce, this would suit your palate. It was slightly too salty for us, nonetheless, every last piece was devoured. We were lucky enough to meet the chef and part owner, good guy, chatted us up a bit about his restaurant and details about the second venue Zealous.  The cocktail, well it was poured with a light hand and after one for $10.25, I ended with water. Why, because I think if I'd continued to order them it would cost me around $41 to leave with a decent buzz. With food and the one cocktail we totaled around fifty dollars. Some dishes are small and some medium, with this said, I'd suggest not coming hungry, but wanting to taste only.  Best when shared with friends.  Duchamps is a small space.  I'm guessing their sit down ability to be around forty or fifty people.  But, that would be pushing it.  Best to call ahead.  If you are familiar with the area, parking is hard to come by.  Make sure to check the side streets for signs because most of it has neighborhood assigned parking.",0.9928,0.875,0.111,0.014,0.5038916736285157

The menu is divided into small portions and big, but really it's just appetizers and entrees by another name. Rick and I shared the simple salad with asparagus. Light, tasty and dressed well (read: not drenched). We also divvied up an order of ricotta gnocchi. Not your typical pile of potato and heavy sauce. This had a range of ingredients and the pasta was more of a compliment than the main event. Different, but good. If I had been hungrier, I may have felt a bit ripped off, but as it was this ended up being the perfect amount of food.  The best part of the meal was dessert. Four of us split the cupcake and ice cream sandwich platter. Delicious. But again, pretty small portions. The cupcakes were a bite each and the sandwiches were two bites, max. Not a pig out by any means.  I really loved the cocktail I selected: the XOXO. I wasn't expecting it to have the consistency it did (akin to a mimosa) but it ended up being great. Can't recall all that was in it, but Black Cherry vodka was supposedly the main event. The owner (?) stopped by to ask how I liked the drink, apparently they had just put it on the menu. Kind of cool but also awkward after a minute. I tried the Suzanne as well. It was even better than theXOXO, but much stronger. Two drinks, a salad, an entree and 1/2 a dessert put us at about $65.

(Just as a real lady should never have to say she is one, a truly cool restaurant should never have to proclaim itself as such, either.) But the food left me flat. All of  three of us started with a serviceable ""lobster"" flatbread. I put ""lobster"" in quotes since actual lobster was virtually undetectable. A brown butter and sweet potato risotto was appealing enough, but the texture of the rice was slightly off and undersalted (only after my dining partner and I added some salt did its flavor profile come through). After an unremarkable cheese plate, we had a trio of desserts. The ice cream sandwich might have been enjoyable weren't it for the too-hard cookies that made it difficult to eat. I think there might've been a piece of chocolate cake and another thingamajig as part of the trio, but they were so forgettable I can no longer remember what they were.

We both agreed that we've experienced much better New American cuisine elsewhere in the city.    We arrived on time to the darkened restaurant. With the black velvet curtain and dim lights, I nearly took a header walking into the restaurant. The clear chairs make an interesting contrast between the darkened interior. The hostess seated us quickly. We looked over the wine and drink menu. I chose a Suzanne cocktail teeming with ginger and St. Germain. This cocktail was the highlight of my evening. My husband ordered the Egg Nog cocktail. Duchamp has an excellent bartender because these drinks packed a flavorful punch. For our prix fixe menu, I ordered the Mini Braised Duck Rillette Tartines & Chilled Cauliflower Puree. From its description, I expected it to be warm. Instead it was cold and reminded me of tuna salad, not braised duck. The dish disappointed. My husband ordered the lobster white pizza. It wasn't very lobster-y or white because it had a lot of red sauce on it. Out of the two starters, his was much better. For my entree, I chose the sweet potato risotto with brown butter sauce. The brown butter overpowered the sweet potato to the point of being bland. The sweet potato risotto disappointed further because it was so underseasoned. I couldn't taste the sweet potatoes until I salted it. When I saw the salt selection on the table, everything made sense. Meanwhile, my husband had the steak and eggs. His steak looked and tasted delicious. The accompanying bacon and egg quiche was light and airy. It was amazing the vast difference between these two dishes from a seasoning and flavor standpoint. One was pretty well seasoned; though the mister said his dish was better with the addition of salt to one completely underseasoned and bland. For the third course, we had some artisanal cheeses. These were pretty good especially the creamy brie and manchengo. They gave us bread with nuts which we had to request some nut free bread for me. Our server seemed confused by this request like we were yanking his chain or something. We managed to get a soft loaf of bread which is pretty good.  For the fourth course, we had a sampling of their desserts: lemon tart, chocolate cupcakes, and ice cream sandwiches. Again, I wasn't impressed. The desserts were so pedestrian and a little too close to home in ease to make. They just didn't thrill or delight us.  Our service overall was alright. They cleared plates a little too quickly and really didn't want anyone to linger let alone enjoy their meal. It felt like the fastest meal I've ever had at a high end restaurant.  After our NYE dinner experience here, I probably won't return here or go out of my way to. I didn't experience any amazing food delights where I remember the dish fondly and want to return to taste it again.

Flavor was amazing and comforting--great start.

So although nothing was bad per say I definitely know there are other places I would go for brunch before I go back to Duchamp.",0.9354,0.836,0.134,0.03,0.3994444444444445

First I should mention the good stuff - that the decor and environment are both lovely.  I totally appreciate good interior design.  Nice tables & flooring, nice choice of wood; the chairs, the lighting, the atmosphere, the menu design all get high points.   The food? Not so lovely.  We ordered the phyllo-encrusted escargot (which sounded heavenly), 2 lobster bisque soups, and we shared the lobster risotto special.   On all fronts, below average.  The escargot was like two soggy spring rolls buried under a ridiculous amount of frisee salad - like they didn't want us to find them?  And the taste was nothing special.  We were reminded of the amazing escargot at Bistro Campagne (a totally different preparation to be sure, but the best escargot dish we've had yet) and wished we had decided to go there that night, instead. The lobster bisque was watery and bland...like drinking orange-colored water with a little coconut milk thrown in for kicks. The risotto was the worst, however, because it was totally undercooked.  Risotto is a tough thing to do well, and the chefs could use a little more practice.  It was practically crunchy.  When we told the waiter, he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry.  Would you like to order dessert?""  Um...that would be a no. For what we ordered and the quality of what we got, we feel we paid too much, the server didn't handle our ""complaint"" very well, the food was disappointing and we certainly won't be back.  Sorry Duchamp.",0.9956,0.701,0.235,0.064,0.605069745069745

Really great portion size too.  I'm a little piggy so I scarfed down my whole plate, but my friend got the same thing and had enough to take half home.   The dessert trio was also awesome except for the lemon creme brulee that I kind of thought tasted like congealed duck fat.   It was a great meal and I can't wait to go back!!! p.s.

Luckily I was dining with a sharing party, so I got to eat a little bit of everything we had: - Garlic and romano cheese french fries:  Cooked perfectly (with the skin on!), and the light dusting of salt and romano cheese was a nice decision on the chef's part for a classy version of a classic bar dish. - Omelette: made with (you can choose other ingredients) feta cheese, ""exotic"" mushrooms (whatever that means), and tomatoes.  It was delicious, and the eggs were cooked with the right amount of firmness.  I would've appreciated a little more ingredients inside the omelette, but it could've been that I ate the more egg-dense part. - Duchamp havarti cheeseburger with tomato remoulade:  great bun, but the meat wasn't really fancy and despite what most reviewers have said I thought it was in desperate need of seasoning. B-b-b-bland.  I should add though that my friend got the meat cooked through exactly how he asked.  This is rare. - Salmon latkes (simplification b/c this dish has a long name): being Jewish, I had to order this dish.  I had no other choice.  Easily the most beautiful of the several dishes ordered and well put together.  Smoked salmon was thinly sliced and the celery-root parsnip latkes were soft and crispy.  Highly pleased. I only gave the restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because the waitress messed up our checks, wasn't as attentive as we would've liked (forgot drink orders, took too long, but she was sweet), and the price they charge for a Bloody Mary ($9.25!) is near-criminal. Also, it takes quite a while for your food to come.  This might've been because the place was packed, but the portions here are so small I had trouble believing it took that long to prepare our dishes.  Overall this place was a great restaurant with a beautiful and well thought-out design/ambiance and was a great upgrade to the brunch my friends and I normally enjoy.  I'll be back if I ever get a raise!",0.9963,0.763,0.196,0.041,0.5676739926739927

As a side note, amazed at how tiny the kitchen is and yet they crank out great food and quickly.  Ask to check it out and you will see that it looks fit for 2-3 people to work in max.  How they can work in there especially in the summer when all the outdoor seating is available is beside me. Overall, I might pass on the apps but the dinners were great and the service was awesome.  I'm looking forward to trying the burger next time because I've heard so much about it.   Service was great too.  Thanks Duchamp.",0.9984,0.737,0.237,0.026,0.6098809523809524

The food here is fantastic.  I mean, Duchamp makes the house salad taste amazing.  The gnocchi was delicious and the dessert!  We got the mini cupcakes and ice cream sandwiches.  A very simple dessert but...YUM.   Too bad it was raining, the outside deck looked like it would have been the place to be if the sun was out.  I would suggest Duchamp for anyone that wants to try a place with friends.  It seemed like all the tables were tables for 6-10 people.  Many of the small plates are meant for sharing, so this is definitely a place to come with friends.",0.9947,0.681,0.295,0.025,0.605922619047619
2009-07-27,4.0,"BF and I stumbled upon Duchamp rather randomly, having escaped the chaos of Wicker Park Fest, and ended up having a nice dinner there.  The other place we considered was the Bristol, but when we heard the loudness of that place from half a block away, we turned around immediately and opted for the calm sanity of Duchamp's patio. It was a beautiful night and we did not regret going there at all.  Even though we are not huge fans of communal dining, the experience was fine.  We were seated at the end of one of their long patio tables and another couple was not seated next to us until we were nearly done with our meal. We opted to eat light and so selected three appetizers to nibble on small plates-style, along with a crisp, Austrian white wine.  We had the beet salad, which consisted of several cubes of beets served with mache salad, a couple cubes of feta, some pecans, and a smear of creamy dressing.  We also had the salmon tartar, which were served on three little (potato?) pancakes with capers.  They were very tasty.  And then, our third dish was the assorted cheese plate with fruit bread, which was very good.  there was a manchego, a triple-cream cow's milk cheese, and a really interesting goat cheese.  after that we were still a bit hungry, but not sure f we wanted to order entrees.  We opted for dessert instead and were pleasantly satisfied with the lemon tart that we got.  It was on a delicious crust and the lemon part was smooth and custardy, with the top caramelized like a creme brulee.  Heavenly! If we're ever back in the neighborhood again and looking for a place for dinner, I would certainly come back.  There were  number of  entree items that sounded appealing to me, the atmosphere and clientele were acceptable (we came partly because the diners seemed like a more mature but still hip crowd rather than the loud, rowdy and overprivileged younger set that tends to inhabit this neighborhood), and the food was thoughtful and good but not pretentious.",0.9956,0.786,0.178,0.036,0.4714557226399332
2009-07-19,4.0,"What a delightful surprise. The only reason they don't get 5 is because it's really loud in the dining room, and there's not really a place to stand while you're waiting for your table. Luckily, we arrived right on time, had a res and got to sit outside, which was lovely, and definitely the way to go in good weather. The menu is a great mix of high and low-duck rilette appetizers mixed with ""wings"" that were STUPID good. We decided to order a bunch of different things, and the only thing I can say is that it was all freakin' great. The next time I go, I will definitely order the braised pork shoulder for myself, since one person at the table ordered, and by the time we had all had a taste it was practically gone. The staff was super courteous and my only comment would be that the hostess who sat us was acting a little aggressive, in the way that Debra Winger was screaming ""over by the car honey"" in ""Terms of Endearment"" ""Can I show you to your table, can you follow me to your table, can I PLEASE show you to your table"".

Good: 1)The outdoor patio is FABULOUS.  On a nice evening i'm not sure where else i'd like to be.  The patio is large, surprisingly quiet for it's size, and very comfortable.   2) The menu was very interesting.  Lots of choices for all types.  Most things made my mouth water upon reading the description (in all fairness i was very hungry).  I had the steak and eggs with quiche side which was very flavorful.   3) Wine and beer selection had good depth and made me happy. 4) I thought the price was fairly reasonable for what we got. Bad: 1) Reservations - we were seated an hour late on the patio.  They had two people holding up the table (we were a party of 8) and instead of politely offering to buy the couple a drink at the bar if they would move along (they had been finished for some time) they let all 8 of us wait without even an apology. 2) They offered to seat us inside.  The inside of the place was humid and loud.  Not a good place to go if you want to chat. 3) The food ended up being hit and miss.  I ordered the scallops appetizer.  It ended up being ONE scallop.  The waiter knew i was sharing it with someone and instead of telling us it was one scallop he let us order it and then fight over who got the larger half (RIDICULOUS).   4) Service was so-so.  The bus boys were quick but our waiter was a bit of a douche bag to be quite honest.

Though the waitress said they're known for their hot wings, we thought they tasted like straight soy sauce and were just okay. The tartines were good but not amazing. Service, also, was just okay.

Two other couples occupied each end of the table, and we were seated right in between them, in the middle two seats. It was oh-so-awkward and made conversation impossible.

However, my wife ordered the burger which was delicious.  Some of friends ordered the gnocchi and that was also very tasty.  All in all a nice dining experience but not mind blowing.  We would return maybe with out of town guests looking for a cool Chicago restaurant.",0.9501,0.847,0.142,0.011,0.5993528693528692

2009-02-11,4.0,"I feel like a bit of a codger for saying this- but Valentine's Day is for suckers! My lady and I feel this way and realize that one should not get hopes up for an overly romantic February 14th- especially when going out. Restaurants over the years have made the astute realization that this is a great day to capitalize on the idea that every person that has someone in their life is supposed to go out and spend money- usually on a nice dinner for two.  Despite our mutual hatred for Hallmark holidays, we still actually like to have an excuse from time to time to head out for that nice dinner for two at a place that is slightly more upscale than the places we fall back on (and appropriately more expensive too). While our friends and family look to us as the ones that are constantly going out to ""nice"" places- the reality is we tend to stick to places that we know are good and give great value for what we come for- mainly- good food.  Duchamp became our own private Valentine's Day excuse (on Feb. 10th). While it was supposed to be about going out for a special meal that costs a good amount of money for the special experience- it actually became a place that holds enough value where I think it could become a place to go to more often for us. Especially when you consider their Tuesday night pre-fixe menu deal ($25, 3-courses).  The decor is nice- kind of follows that standard modern trend that you find with similar restaurants. Lots of dark woods, industrial concrete (and faux-concrete walls in the restrooms), and some cool transparent chairs. I was a bit skeptical of the seating arrangement- considering they follow another dining trend of communal table seating.  Communal seating was one of my biggest fears in setting Duchamp as my ""romantic dining"" destination for last night. What equalized the fact that we were sitting at the same table as another set of two was actually the high noise levels. Somehow two things that I tend to get annoyed with- loud noise at restaurants and having to sit directly next to strangers- ended up cancelling each other out. Basic math rules applied- two negatives made a positive- and the dinner was intimate enough to where we were pleased with the ambiance.  Food was quite nice as well- and for $25 we indulged in multiple drinks- which of course ends up adding to the overall mood for the evening. Our aps were delicious- hers was salmon tartar with creme fraiche, and mine was a duck rillette with some nice accompanying sauces and purees. Main dishes were great too- hers were mushroom crepes with chicken paillard; mine- a nice take on steak and eggs, the steak being perfectly cooked (medium rare- and they didn't even ask how I wanted it done!!!) and the eggs being a bacon quiche. Desserts were a trio plated nicely full of rich flavors (albeit we didn't know what the trio was since it was predetermined for us- and by that time my Fin Du Monde was probably not the best pairing for rich chocolaty desserts)......  Service was noticeably quite good. The guy bussing the tables in particular was hustling, and everyone from the host to the bar staff to the waitress and server were working very well together and provided friendly service.  Good flavors all around, well prepared- overall a very nice experience!",0.9991,0.739,0.218,0.043,0.5547257308901143
2009-02-09,3.0,"We were running a bit late for a show and needed to grab a quick bite to eat.  While not the ideal choice, Duchamp is conveniently located, so we decided to give it a try.  After some initial confusion with the hostess, we bellied up to the bar.  The bartender was handling all the drinks, so I can excuse the slight delay and slightly gruff demeanor.  So far, I'm getting a little too much attitude, but we're committed, so we just shake it off and enjoy our $10 mixed drinks.  In all fairness, I was fighting a pretty mean hangover, so my annoyance threshold was pretty low. Anyhow, onto the restaurant.  The interior is warm, but with a modern twist.  The seating is mostly communal, save for a few 4 tops along one of the walls.  There are about 10 barstools around the bar and very little room for parties waiting for their table. With all that being said, here's where things changed.  We had casually mentioned to the host/hostess that we were heading out to see a show.  One of them apparently mentioned this to the bartender and they did everything in their power to expedite our food and drink orders.  My wife and I thought that was very cool and a very personal touch.  They get much respect for that. On to the food.  My wife got the burger and I tried their steak and eggs.  The steak was cooked to perfection and had great flavor.  The sauce was flavorful without being over-bearing.  The eggs, in the form of a quiche, were okay.  There was too much crust and may the dish seem really dry. The hamburger might be the best I've had in the city.  Despite its deceptively demure size, it contains a half pound of quality meat.  I believe it was sirloin, fillet, and rib-eye, but don't hold me to that.  The taste was fantastic.  I had serious entree envy after taking a bite.  Luckily my wife was kind enough to share.  The fries were also quite good. In summary, I don't know that we'll be rushing back to eat in the dining room any time soon.  However, once the weather changes we'll most certainly head to the patio to enjoy the burger and a beer.",0.9974,0.749,0.203,0.048,0.5050141723356009

As such, my fiancée and I decided to give Duchamp's Tuesday night prix fixe deal a try.  For $25, you can choose one dish from their small plates, one dish from their large plates and you get a trio of desserts.  The breakdown of the foods we got: SMALL PLATES Artisanal Cheese Plate - Excellent.  You get three cheese: two creamy ones (camembert and brie?) and a hard one (manchego?).  I probably should've asked which was which but they were all quite tasty, especially on top of the warm fruit bread that accompanied it. Duck Rillette Tartines - Decent.  My fiancée thought the taste was too rich and heavy.  I thought they tasted like tuna on toast.  But since I like tuna on toast, I wasn't complaining. LARGE PLATES Return to Thailand Bouillabaisse - Excellent.  Large chunk of Chilean sea bass, mussels and shrimp swimming in a coconut curry broth.  Very delicious and a nice spin on the traditional French bouillabaisse. Fish & Chips - Good.  The skate wing was a bit overwhelmed by the batter, which in turn made it taste sort of like cod.  I'm a big fan of skate wing but I think I prefer mine pan fried over deep fried any day.  The fries were a little soggy and I wish it came with more of the tartar sauce and aioli.   TRIO of DESSERT Steamed Chocolate Cake - Ok.  Sort of like one of those brownie bites topped with chocolate mousse.  I'm sure there was much more work in preparing it but that's honestly what it tasted like. Ice Cream Sandwich - Good.  It's an ice cream sandwich.  What more is there to say? Caramelized Lemon Tart - Good.  The tart itself was tasty but the compote that it came with was too strong. A couple other thoughts: 1) Service was a bit hit or miss.  I think they were understaffed that might because it seemed like there was only one server for 10+ tables.  So there were times our server was a bit MIA.  I will say the busser was fantastic in terms of clearing our plates and refilling our waters promptly. 2) Ambiance is ... interesting.  Duchamp is on the dark side and when you factor in the communal seating, it doesn't necessarily make for a pleasant experience.  Plus they have odd chairs that make you feel like your ass is too big.  Last I checked, my ass wasn't too big so I'm blaming it on the chairs. All in all, I would probably only return to Duchamp for the Tuesday night prix-fixe deal because there were a few other items I'd like to try.  If you haven't been to Duchamp, it's certainly worth a try.",0.9979,0.749,0.206,0.045,0.5555944600062248
2009-02-03,2.0,"I have been to Duchamp exactly three times.    Once for dinner/small plates and champagne.  Another time for brunch.  And the final time for lunch with my Dad. I live down the street.  It is just..so...close... First time was fun, it was still a little warm out; we started our meal outside.  Th patio was delightful.. wasn't unhappy with the communal seating.  Sure my water glass was dirty with the skanky gloss left from someone else, but I wasn't phased.  You see, I polish and wash a lot of dishes on a regular basis.  I know that you can clean forty glasses and sterilize them but somehow some ""slut-gloss"" remains.  No biggie.  I grabbed the empty glass next to me and poured my water in without anyone noticing.  Food was fine.  Nothing...great..the wings were tasty.  But the whole time we were mostly concerned with the fact that we were craving something SPICY.  It was all salt, salt, salt.  All I could think was, Chef's a big smoker.  I could be wrong, but it was a salty heaven.  And the croque monsieur was offensive.  The bread crumbled.  Not a sexy coffee cak kind of crumble, but a powdery--WTF-is-this really-bread-? kind of crumble.  Round 2. Brunch.  I got something with sausages and peppers and a piece of corn that way delicious but inconvenient.  I was not happy. Round 3. Brought my Dad.  He's an egg snob.  At home, he makes eggs like a pro.  I vaguely remembered one of the only good things from my brunch was this flatbread with an egg on it.  I encouraged him to order it and I got the impossible-to-eat, but tasty burger.  When the food came out, his egg was a mess.  Not cooked.  He even specified:  ""cooked whites, runny yolk, right?"" with our waitress before hand.  It came out with a very uncooked egg on top and a pile of greens that attempted to mask the disaster.  He was livid.  I was humored.  Only because I knew that he is so passionate and sincere about the temperature of his eggs.  They handled it immediately and apologized (obviously not a service issue but a BOH issue because they didn't know how to cook an EGG.) When they brought his dish back out the whites were too crispy and the yolk was overcooked.  Whatever.  FOH handled it well and my Dad just focused on the other interesting aspects of the interior architecture to get his mind off the disappointment. My beef with the beef--the burger doesn't suck, but my mouth just doesn't open five inches high.  Not bad flavors, just an irresponsible placement of the materials.  I had to rearrange the whole bit just to fit it in my mouth.  I just want food that I can put in my mouth without making a mess of my plate cutting and reorganizing the ingredients. Sigh. FOH has been consistently helpful (aside from getting left alone outside (my first time) in the rain with five plates while my friend and I had to balance them on our arms and wander in with our drinks...).  I am just concerned mostly that the kitchen doesn't have the grasp of simple food preparation.  Thy couldn't cook an EGG.  My advice: DON'T SERVE EGGS IF YA CAN'T COOK 'EM RIGHT.",0.973,0.759,0.143,0.098,0.5126934269434268
2009-01-09,3.0,"Finding The Bristol closed for a staff party, we went to our backup plan, Duchamp (bet they hear that alot, despite opening first). After the whole meal, I'm kind of bummed that The Bristol stole this place's thunder, because Duchamp was overall quite good. Started off with the lobster bisque, which had what I would describe as a donut or begniet floating in it. The fried dough was hard to cut, and the soup itself was unremarkable - definitely more cream than lobster. It was followed shortly by smoked salmon on caper blinis with creme fraiche. These lil fellas were damn tasty, the not-too-fishy salmon balanced by the sweet and salty, doughy little pancakes.  Katie got the Amish chicken with buckwheat pancakes and mushroom sauce, while I went the veg route with potato gnocchi with spring vegetables and grated pecorino (I believe). Both were quite good - the chicken was fairly straightforward, in a home-cooked way. The pancakes were a nice compliment. My gnocchi was quite exceptional, with great texture and nicely-cooked but un-seasonal veggies (cherry tomatoes and asparagus).  We had a merlot and riesling that were both fine, and amply portioned.  The space is beautiful, with clear acrylic plastic chairs, long wood communal tables, and dark grey walls. We especially loved the gothic-style picture frames painted the same dark grey. The bar looks like a nice place to chill, with a pretty good Scotch selection as well. Service was about average - we had to ask for bread, but the staff in general was pleasant. The bill ended up a little higher than expected, but not out of the question.

2008-12-21,1.0,"We went to Duchamp to have dinner with a couple of friends on a Saturday night. We had arrived on time on a rainy cold evening for reservations we'd made about a week in advance (my wife does it that way).  I liked the bar and found the bartender on his game, but that's about where the charm ended. For one thing, it was freezing. Like most restaurants in the windy city, there are two doors to the entrance to act as a barrier to the cold air outside. Someone forgot to explain these basic concepts in physics to the valet who insisted on holding both doors open for anyone who came in, resulting in an arctic blast that extended to the back of the restaurant.  We waited a couple of minutes for our friends to arrive and then asked to be seated. The hostess wanted to seat us right near the front door (aka the refrigerator). When we asked to be seated at another four-top fully set and ready closer to the back, she told us it wasn't ready. I knew then that this was going to be a long night.  After we insisted the table was ready, she reluctantly agreed to seat us and handed us our menus with a real attitude.  My meal was OK, nothing to write home about. My wife's salmon was overcooked and dry. Our water glasses were filled so often, it bordered on comical. Every time (I kid you not), my glass was filled literally all the way to the rim by the water boy. I actually spilled water on myself the first time, because I picked the glass up without looking at it and tipped it to my mouth pouring water down my shirt and trousers. This style of water service continued all night and became a joke for everyone at the table.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake. The presentation was revolting. The chef had taken the cake that had smeared the chocolate syrup from the bottom of the small round cake in a straight line across the plate, then placed the cake in the middle. It looked like someone had an accident on the plate.  Then we ate it. I think the closest thing i could compare it to would be a dried slice of 10-year-old fruitcake. We literally couldn't take more than one bite.  No one came by to ask us how dinner was or how dessert was. Ultimately, the service was sophomoric.  As far as I'm concerned, this place is overprices, overrated, and underwhelming. Try someplace else. You won't be missing much.",0.9837,0.878,0.093,0.029,0.47452601410934747

I found a spot just up the street from Danny's (a nearby bar where I would later convert the female members of my party to perfection that is JD and Diet Coke). Held my breath and pulled my hood tight and as I walked through the cold.  Angular and encased in black, Duchamp has a XXX look, especially with the vertically stamped red lettering. I approached gingerly. I wanted to see if anyone I knew was there but the windows weren't low enough. Too cold to wait outside, I mounted the three steps and grasped the doorknob, which swung open, propelled by a gust of wind, and I was forced backwards off the stoop.  They are badly in need of a railing.  Made it inside after I was confronted with yet another awkward door, which I swear was made backwards. Checked my phone. Of course I was 15 minutes early. I instinctively headed to the bar but realized that its only occupants were couples nibbling appetizers and sipping conservative stemmed beverages so I stuck to the corner of the room and scanned the joint for familiar faces.  The next 20 minutes were spent arriving, issuing various greetings (Isn't it cold outside? Can you believe how cold it is? Goddamnit it's cold!), and worrying if it would snow or not. Soon we were seated, wide eyed with open menus. Duchamp... Duchamp literally means 'from the field' in French. Slope of flaxen grains come to mind. Grazing bovine and a lone farmer carrying a spade. Johnny Cash echoes from an old Chevy under a gnarled walnut tree.  After a flurry of appetizer ordering, we realized that our meal was ""d'une autre champ."" There was shredded duck floating on pureed cauliflower. Salmon strudel awash with apple cider. The chef took the chickens of Amish farmers and paired them with buckwheat crepes. Chilean sea bass swam to Thailand with mussels and rock shrimp.  Maine Lobster skate to Italy on traditional white pizza. Hot wings glazed with lemongrass sauce makes you wonder: Wow. Is this what Hooters is like in Thailand? We liked this otherfield food very much.  George, our waiter, hovered around us. He topped up our glasses and made sure the girl with the gluten allergy was avoiding the bread. He more than answered all of our detailed preparation-related questions and even made up a reason as to why the Malbec tasted as if it was dug out of a snowbank. (Don't worry, our cellar's temperature is quite accurate for the varieties that we store.) After a bit, the wine warmed up, as did our taste buds, because of George's continuous hints about what to order next.  After attacking our third round of small plates, it was time for the check. We agreed that the food was excellent, the conversation scintillating, and the bill wasn't at all overwhelming. A near-perfect dining experience.

The food and drink selection was creative and seemed to match the season. My friend & I had checked the menu online before we went and were excited about getting a mango margarita and mojito.

One of my friends was recommended an awful drink by the bar tender that I can't remember the name of that tasted like a melted warm Popsicle with cayenne whirled in.  The salt on the table was cute and a nice touch (three cheers for pink salt on everything!).  The food was decent but didn't live up to our expectations. A couple risottos and hangar steaks at the table. The risotto was fairly flavorless and the hangar steak was good (what hangar steak isn't?). But the meat quality actually tasted a little bad-- I got a roast beefy aftertaste. And lastly, but certainly what closed the deal as a place that was somewhat lacking in it's cuisine's quality. We ordered the chocolate pudding cake and the ice cream sandwiches... the chocolate cake was horrendously dry and somewhat flavorless. The cookies were good, but certainly nothing special.

My apple cider cocktail was decent, but nothing I would order again. My other friends ordered a bottle of wine - that wasn't great either. It was probably safest to order your staple gin and tonics, like one of my friends. Entrees: Three of us ordered the special for the evening: risotto with mushrooms. The risotto was cooked perfectly, but lacked in taste and flavor. Thank goodness for the cute spread of salt on the table. We all loved the French salt (pink); this gave the risotto some needed flavor. My two other friends ordered the steak which came with quiche.

The hostess was super sweet and friendly.  I thought she'd give me a little attitude since I completely missed my reservation, but she was understanding.  She even worked us back into the system, so we ended up waiting only 15 minutes after my friends showed up.   Duchamp is all about this communal seating thing.  The three of us ended up sitting with five strangers.  To our delight, the men were really friendly, funny and normal.   To our disappointment, they were married. (Of course.) Anyway, the vibe in Duchamp is super modern, trendy, dark and seductive.  I love it!  Our server was fun, friendly with no hint of pretentiousness.  My friend (visting from Seoul) commented on the 'great American service'.   Even though my friend ordered an entree, I think the way to go here is to order a bunch of appetizers and split them among the group.  Top it off with dessert and a drink...and you're set!  The duck fries were amazing....I think that was my favorite item.  Followed by the wings (tangy and sweet) and the lobster pizza (tasty, but the crust was a little over-cooked).   The creme brulee was pretty good, but I was disappointed that they ran out of the cupcakes!  No ice cream sandwiches for us!  *sigh*  Maybe next time!

The decor gets better, outside is amazing.  It is the best outdoor seating in Chicago by far, no scrunching on a sidewalk!  It is communal seating but I like that a lot, always promises an interesting interaction! On to the FOOD:  I love the beet salad! It is one of the best salads I have ever had.

I think gazpacho is a great summer option, makes me feel like I'm on vacation! I love the Sunchoke soup as well! I can't wait to have this when it's getting cold outside!  My other fave thing is the White Pizza with Lobster which is more of a flat bread.  I grew up in california so this is the reminiscent of home! Gourmet pizza with unusual things on top! Lastly, for my entree one night I had the burger! Fabulous! I'm addicted to havarti cheese and I knew this burger was FOR ME! It is excellent and a thick patty! Great!  Also, I'm not sure where the buns are from or what they are made from but they are AMAZING! The perfect burger! Thank god! Chicago is lacking in this area!

My two stars stem primarily from the food. It just wasn't all that fantastic. It was all sort of bland and unexciting. We ordered the garlic fries: nothing special and could have used more of the star ingredient, garlic. The ""white pizza""...not sure where the ""white"" part comes in. I mean, it was white but why? I thought there might be some fatty alfredo sauce or something super tasty, but no. I'm not really sure what was in it besides some lobster. The chicken wings, according to my friends, were fantastic. From a girl who doesn't eat chicken, they looked lovely. My gnocchi was good, but not good enough to sway my two-star review. My poor friend ordered the chicken and was very displeased and disappointed. Her description was ""bland"". And it looked it too so minus a star on presentation! There also wasn't a huge selection.

2008-08-03,3.0,"Duchamp is located in the old Meritage space- a space that includes a fabulous outdoor patio which is a great place to enjoy your meal.  Having been open only two days, however- Duchamp is still working through some of their service issues which were apparent in our visit last night. Surprisingly- the place was packed at 9pm.  I called to get a reservation and that was the earliest that they could accommodate me.  We showed up and were escorted to a table on the patio.  Just a note- this place is all about communal seating- so if you are hoping to have a private table tucked away in the back you need to go somewhere else.  Inside the chairs are clear plastic adding to the high noise factor (the hostess told me that they are still working through some of the acoustics of the place).  You are seated at these large tables that hold at least 6 people which actually worked out okay given I have been to places where I have my own table and have sat closer to the people next to me. Once seated outside we were presented with menus.  What should have come with the menus were flashlights.  It was SO dark out there that I almost had to go and stand by the service area to read the menu.  Our server did bring another votive to try to help.   The menu is simple.  It is divided up into small plates (Appetizers) and large plates (entrees) with a dessert section. Entrees range from sandwiches like a burger and Cocque Monsieur to bouillabaisse and steak and top out at around $19 which is nice to see. The wine list is still only printed out on paper as they are finalizing their cellar. We ordered a couple of the appetizers- the white pizza and the beet salad.  The pizza was good (long and narrow like a flatbread) with lobster and arugula.  Very good.  My friend ordered the beet salad with out the feta cheese or sour cream but it did have to go back as the request was not honored.  Once corrected- the salad was also quite good. Next to the entrees.  We ordered the braised pork shoulder and the skirt steak.  The pork was more like a bowl of pulled pork in a ""tomatoey"" sauce. My friend said it was okay but not remarkable. The skirt steak was better and perfectly cooked but was drowning in a sauce that was a little overbearing.  It came with a bacon quiche though that was really good and the fries we ordered on the side were great. The winner of the entire evening?  The dessert.  Our server suggested the three mini chocolate cupcakes served with cookie ice cream sandwiches.  I should have just had that as they were amazing!  Perfect for a hot summer's evening. The service was off a bit which could be ""growing pains"".  They work as a team where one person takes your order and another delivers it.  But each time- the food runner put the wrong food down in front of me.  There were also timing issues between the appetizer and the entree and we never did get bread which the other people had.  I know it's a small thing but I had to ask each time I had a drink for lime instead of lemon and each time it came with lemon (one time it came with both- like they had just given up!) Our entire bill including tip and wine came to about $120 for two so this place is reasonably priced.  I also wonder why they named it Duchamp as I could see not evidence of Marcel Duchamp's work in the place (could there be another Duchamp that I am unaware of?) So give it a few weeks for them to get the service kinks worked out and to figure out what they are going to do with the acoustics inside.  The patio, however, is as great as ever- just bring a flashlight so that you can read the menu!",0.9969,0.856,0.124,0.02,0.5021609579504317
