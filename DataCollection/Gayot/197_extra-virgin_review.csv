2007-03-05,4.0,"Ate at this spot a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised.  Good option if you want to try something different than the pan-Asian restaurants (Red Light, Starfish, Dragonfly, Sushi Wabi) that seem to dominate Randolph street.  Drinks were really strong (big plus for me).  Had the mojito and some margarita (blood orange?).  Started off with one of their antipasto plates (proscuitto, cheese, and olives), which was quite good (I'm a slave to proscuitto!).  I had the duck, which was on special, and was outstanding.  Service was efficient and friendly.  The place was pretty empty for a Friday night, but may have had something to do with the bad weather.  Definitely would go back.  Good place for groups too.",0.9496,0.73,0.215,0.055,0.5303571428571429
2007-01-22,5.0,"My prior review of Extra Virgin was of the lounge only, which I hadn't really enjoyed, but I tried the restaurant portion on Friday night and LOVED it!  We had the mussels, calamari and bruschetta as appetizers and all were delicious.  The entrees were fantastic as well.  Service was great and the prices were moderate.  I'll definitely be back! Also stopped back into the lounge for a drink after dinner.  The loud music situation has improved greatly!  It was kind of dead, but overall a pretty good experience.",0.988,0.58,0.334,0.086,0.5777777777777778
2007-01-03,5.0,"I loved this place.  I had dinner at Extra Virgin before seeing a play with my family.  The food was excellent, the service was superb and the ambience was great.  The prices were right and the concept is perfect for a big group, or table for two.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I can't even come up with anything remotely negative to say, so 5 stars.",0.9732,0.632,0.323,0.044,0.6185714285714285
2006-11-08,5.0,"True to form, with my reviews, this review is for the BAR area only. I love it! Swank vibe, nice large bar, good drinks, nice service. We didn't eat anything, but our party of 4-5 had a great time. Pomegranate martinis, mmmmm.",0.9568,0.626,0.374,0.0,0.7535714285714286
2006-09-29,1.0,"What's the beautiful thing about Yelp? I can come back and change ratings (hooray). I just dropped Extra Virgin from 3 to 1 star after my 4th, and probably final trip here. My first trip here was excellent across the board - would have snagged 4 stars-ish.  The main problem remains: management is not running the show. I walked out of here last night after sitting for 15 minutes with no one even glancing at our table. This is the SECOND time in a row this has happened. WTF?! For an area as competitive as the Near West/Warehouse district neighborhoods are, I cannot figure out what the problem is. If you roll the dice (or offer some sort of sacrificial animal to the gods of restaurant service), and receive better treatment than I have, you'll find the food to be good (not amazing) and a decent wine list. The atmosphere is nice, very laid back even if the music is a bit loud for conversation. Best of luck, but please don't tell them I sent you!",0.9208,0.854,0.116,0.03,0.5150000000000002

2006-08-06,3.0,"I went here on a double date.  We were going to the theatre so we dined at 6PM.  Surprisingly, the restaurant had quite a few other patrons for that hour. For an appetizer, we chose the small plate dish of hummus, tiziki sauce (sp.), and roasted mushrooms with slices of pita.  The server kindly brought us more pita.  Huge plus in my book... why are some restaurants so stingy with bread?? Anyway, I ordered the small plate of roasted seafood for dinner.  It was really good and very reasonable priced. I don't frequent the West Loop very often.  When I do, I prefer to go to one of the nicer restaurants on Randolph.  However, I would recommend Extra Virgin if you are looking for a reasonably priced Italian restauarant.  Another bonus is that they serve both small plates as well as full entree portions so every can be satisfied.",0.9211,0.783,0.155,0.062,0.4581578947368421
2006-07-30,1.0,"Avoid it!  I do not know which I was less impressed with here, the food or the service.   I tried Extra Virgin for the first time for lunch recently.  There were only three or four other tables with anyone at them, and somehow it still took them 20 minutes to even take our order and it took even longer to get our bill after we were done with our food. The bread that they gave us to snack on was CLEARLY left over from the night before and was stale to say the least.  The rest of the meal was passable, but when you are down the street from a great Italian lunch and dinner spot like Vivo, you need to do better than that.   The only positive about this place is the decor.  The room is bright and pleasant to look at, but that is not enough to help you ignore the fact that the rest of the experience leaves A LOT to be desired.",0.9804,0.785,0.174,0.041,0.4934742158426369
2006-07-17,4.0,"We went last night (A Sunday night) and it was pretty empty but I really liked the decor and the whole scene there. I would love to go back on a busier night. The service was great, and attentive. The menu was interesting and had a lot of options for people who don't eat meat (like me) Everything was DELICIOUS! We tried a little bit of everything and shared. I can't wait to go back, I liked it alot!",0.9897,0.632,0.353,0.014,0.5583333333333333
2006-06-23,3.0,"My friend and I stopped here for a very light dinner before going out dancing on Saturday night.  They have an extensive Italian wine selection by the bottle and glass, of which I selected a glass of tempranillio wine from Italy.  We share two small plates (mussels and an order of antipasti).  The cheeses on the antipasti menu (we also got the salami and the artichoke hearts) were delicious and went well with my wine. Decor was very casual, and outdoor dining is available.  I felt the food was somewhat pricey and didn't match up to the quality.  The best part was the ""extra virgin"" olive oil that they serve (and change regularly) with their bread basket.  The olive oil was certainly delicious. If you are looking for a ""small plates"" type of place, look into my review of Fixture.",0.967,0.831,0.157,0.013,0.4933547008547008
2006-04-29,2.0,"It was OK. We sat at the open seating opposite of the bar (the person I was with wanted to smoke). This meant being served by the bartender... Not a good thing when the bar is busy. So, I have to give it low marks for service - at those tables at least. However, those seats would be nice for a late night nosh and drink.  The food was flavorful but not above average.  If you do go check these out: 1. Sit somewhere other than the bar seating 2. Stick with the small plate items and share The location offers better choices...",0.8725,0.868,0.118,0.015,0.3983333333333334
2006-04-26,2.0,"Eh.  I went here last Saturday night around 7:00 and the place was about half full, although it began filling up more around 8:00.  The decor and ambience are nice, but the service was a little too fast for what was clearly supposed to be a romantic dinner, and the food was at best mediocre. (I got the veal meatballs and my friend got the steak fritte.)  I probably won't go back.",0.9643,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.46388888888888885
2006-03-04,3.0,The food was decent - nothing made me swoon. It would be a nice place to go with a group if they would turn down the music a bit. Seriously I had to shout to be heard across the table!,0.3382,0.873,0.082,0.045,0.6555555555555556
2005-11-06,3.0,Owned by the same company as Bar Louie and this place tries to appeal with their title and offering Italian food (think of the Italian version of tapas) - the antipasta boards are good - a bit on the pricey end but the atmosphere is very nice - the decor is tastefully done with seletive artwork portrayed,0.7261,0.893,0.107,0.0,0.3541666666666667
