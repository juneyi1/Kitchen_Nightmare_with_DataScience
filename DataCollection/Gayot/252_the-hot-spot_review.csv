My only gripe about this place is the fact that they only had 1 server on a Sunday morning.. that seems a little peculiar to me being as it's usually a high volume time.  It took nearly 15 minutes to get water refills, and I felt bad for the overworked server.

ONE slice? Is this a joke? Come on now, bread really isn't that expensive.  The avocado I can understand, but getting one piece of toast is just absurd to me.   I also used to always order the cobb salad, and as most of you probably know, a cobb is quite loaded.  But reflecting recent hardships, their salad is a lame cobb salad (i.e. less tomatoes, less avocado, a half hard-boiled egg, etc.) AND they even raised the price from $8.50 to $9! More money for less salad? Umm, we're struggling too Hot Spot, times are hard for everyone.   In addition to that, they have down-graded their menu from about 40+ entrees, to now about 25.  So, there isn't very much to choose from.  They have raised their prices on all of the entrees too, not just the cobb salad.  The staff is still as friendly as always, but sorry, that's just not enough for me.   I hope Hot Spot owner/employees look at yelp regularly, I want them to know they aren't fooling anyone.  I want the old Hot Spot back! :(",0.8714,0.843,0.098,0.059,0.5107147324220495

I ordered something described as pineapple french toast. The waitress refused to let me substitute hashbrowns, or anything else, for the meat that came with it; her attitude dissuaded me from wanting to pay another few bucks for a side of hashbrowns. The french toast was like something a five year old would concoct--cheap white bread with a can of crushed pineapple dumped on it, along with an overly sweet sauce of some sort. It was barely edible, and I didn't finish it. Upon leaving, the proprietor asked me how everything was and I told her frankly but without anger what my experience had been like. She told me the waitress shouldn't have told me I couldn't substitute for the meat, but made no attempt to do anything to rectify the (admitted) wrong.

Just good. *shrugs* I got the corned beef hash, which was as expected, nothing special. He got the breakfast burrito, which was the same. Big portions. We both got coffee, which was nice n strong, but nothing to write home about. The prices were about spot-on with what I expected. The service was a little slow, and when we first got there the person behind the counter ignored us for a few minutes. Finally I just said, ""I guess we can just sit at the bar, then,"" and we bellied up.  I thought the grass wall was cool. I was looking at it awhile, seeing as how there isn't much else to look at in that particular area of the restaurant, and I realize that had to have been painted from the ceiling down. Took a lot of work, and it ended up pretty nice. I didn't mind the yellow on the walls; thought it was more cheery than blazing.  In all, it was fine. I'll probably go back for brunch because it's so close, but I honestly didn't experience anything worth raving about. Maybe next time - I hear those lingonberry pancakes are pretty good... EDIT - Aaand, 3 stars becomes 2. I went back this morning and while we were seated quickly (in the LOUD back room), after that, we were largely forgotten. After we ordered (he got the breakfast burrito, I got the fruit and cheese plate), we waited about half an hour before our pissy server came back and clambered our plates in front of us and skulked off without a word.  The fruit and cheese plate consists of 2 past-their-prime, un-hulled strawberries, some un-cored green and red apple slices, a few slices of orange, a handful of scattered red grapes (about half were kinda slimy and questionable), 2 slices of toast (the best part, and with ONE jelly packet, lol) and yellow cheese planks and white cheese planks. Guessing mild cheddar on both, though I could be wrong on the white, because it was so mild it didn't taste like anything.  Whatever they put on the green apples - guessing acidulated water, as I could mainly taste lemon and not apple on the granny smiths - had sloshed onto the bottom of the plate, making a distasteful little pool that poisoned the taste of anything else that touched it, and made for drippy, soggy cheese. Yuck. I mentioned this when we paid to the lady up front - guessing owner/manager - and she denied that they soak their apples in anything, which I have to say I'm darned near certain is not true - my tastebuds don't lie. She asked me if I mentioned anything to my server, and I replied no, because we didn't see her but for when she brought the check out (15 minutes after we'd finished). Additionally, the toilet in the front restroom was functioning poorly, and I fixed it.  Disappointing. EDIT AGAIN, part deux! HOW could I forget? I had also ordered grapefruit juice, and it came to me with a freshly-perished fruit fly on top. YUMMY! Rather than suffer the wrath of the server (if I could ever get her attention), I simply spooned it out and went about my bidness.",0.9242,0.843,0.089,0.068,0.43595711916607444

There has to be a better way to make a name for yourself. Oh well. Just stick to coffee. And yes, it can get loud, especially in the back, and I imagine only louder as more and more families start moving into the neighborhood...",0.9725,0.836,0.154,0.01,0.5568939393939394

2007-04-06,3.0,"Hot Spot is a pretty decent place.  I like that they're right accross the street (yay for convenient breakfast), but the menu seems pretty hit or miss.  The pancakes are delicious, the steak and eggs..  pretty gross.  I tend not to actually eat in there, as there's usually a decent wait on weekends and the colors give me a headache and can potentially worsen a hangover.  It is, however, a cute place and a good neighborhood fixture.  Very nice staff.",0.9637,0.604,0.292,0.104,0.7442176870748299
2007-03-20,4.0,"Good spot (hot or not). The owner -  Stacy - used to work at Wishbone (manager?), where it looks like she learned a thing or two about putting out a good breakfast & lunch. She's still pals with owner Joel Nickson (I know Joel too, great guy with a million fans).  FYI, last time I saw Stacy a month or so ago, she told me Joel GAVE HER AN OVEN (!). We both had a belly laugh on that one, but knowing Joel, it wasn't too surprising. But back to reviewing the HS: Love it. I've been there many times, sometimes with my sister's two small kids, and everyone had a good time, every time. There's not much else for a higher-end breakfast spot around the Humboldt Park area, so it has that going for it, but it's a good spot wherever it might be. Lots of nice stuff to choose from, from standard breakfast fare to more adventurous takes on Mexican recipes.  Service is always good & friendly; always asking if you need more coffee or water or whatever, but unobtrusive at the same time.  I would actually give them 5 stars but (sorry, Stacy) the green & yellow color schemes (even on the ceiling) almost make me feel like I'm on the verge of having some flashback somehow - a little twitchy on the eyeballs (especially when I'm nursing a Sunday AM hangover). Now that I think of it, maybe that's not a bad thing?",0.993,0.804,0.187,0.009,0.48575268817204303

I brought a party of 12 here and was completely underwhelmed. Loganberry pancakes came out looking dry and anemically thin. 2 orders of french toast were both cold and sickening sweetened by god knows what. So I didn't get the huevos rancheros nor the breakfast burrito. So what. 2 Mexican breakfast entrees does not a brunch joint make.

The bright decor here can either help or hinder your day.  I suppose it is a function of how bad your head hurts from the previous night. For me, this usually helps and adds to the typically gloomy days of Chicago.  The walls are neon green and the staff is wonderful.

The Loganberry pancakes are so GOOD.  They give you huge portions too.  The other breakfasts are pretty sweet as well, especially considering that this place is battling neighborhood giant Cozy Corner.  They hold their own pretty well. On a theoretical note, I think it's great to see a place try to fit into a neighborhood.  The owners of treat could take a cue from this place.",0.9912,0.65,0.322,0.029,0.7162698412698413

Mostly the usual standard brunch fare, but well prepared and tasty. I often get the logan berry pancakes which are great. The service is getting better, the first time I didn't coffee for almost 20 minutes (near death experience) and the second time I  went our waitress poured ice water on my companion's back when she was distracted by another patron. I blame karma for that one.... I go back because it is walking distance and recently the service has been great.",0.9306,0.696,0.211,0.092,0.37395833333333334
