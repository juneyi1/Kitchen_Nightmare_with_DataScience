2010-02-16,5.0,"LOVE IT! CANNOT WAIT TO RETURN!!! For my 30th birthday in November 15 of my closest friends and I came here for dinner then off to Belmont Burlesque for a show! It was an AWESOME night!  This isn't your typical spaghetti and meatballs Italian dinner. It's more unique Italian, and I LOVE that!!  I believe I got the gigli pasta dish- all I really recall is loving it.  It isn't cheap, that's for sure. But it's a nice restaurant and I really liked the ambiance- especially those exposed brick walls.  You must go! the Southport corridor has been in dire need of goood Italian for a long time and we finally got it!!! Now go, scoot- enjoy!",0.9861,0.713,0.254,0.034,0.6125730994152048
2010-01-29,1.0,So I'm not sure where to begin. Ive been here twice and had two very different experiences.  The first time was in early december. The food was fantastic. The server though seemed like she was from the cast of jersey shore. She was more interested in the football game that was on in the dining room...why does this place have a TV? As we waited for  food to arrive our waitress  Stared up at the television at one point even screaming at the television screen?  this is not a sports bar but  honestly i felt like i was eating at espn zone.  we like the food  pate was amazing chicken and pork were cooked brilliantly-very much so recomend the pork Our second visit was with a large group  on new years eve the food was once again great. Vanilla pana cotta was excellent. kobe beef and sable cod one of my favorite all great! this visit seemed more promising especially considering after dinner we had access to an open bar. But once again it turned odd. after dinner it seemed as if the bartender  a middle aged man seemed very intoxicated and kept doing shot after shot. As the night progressed he began grinding on the waitresses and at one point grabed and kissed the guess who - the football fan waitress who had waited on us three weeks prior. i would highly recomend this place for food but not the service --maybee takeout? it's just generally an odd atmosphere.,0.993,0.785,0.182,0.033,0.5391779701779702

First off, they have a nice list of wines that are all fairly inexpensive but quality (our bottle was $31). We had the grilled octopus appetizer and it was delicious - not chewy at all - and great flavoring. We shared a winter salad which was also very good. For my entree I had the black pepper papperadalle with boar bolognese and it was amazing - the pasta was homemade and the sauce and meat were so complimentary to the meal. My husband had the ravioli and it was delicious too - homemade. Also it is reasonably priced for the quality - all that food with wine and we still came in at under $100! I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a nice change of pace amongst the bars on Southport!",0.9948,0.728,0.272,0.0,0.7216666666666668

We tried a few different salads, the arancini, risotto, a couple of fish dishes, and two different short rib preparations. All the food was delicious. The wine list was reasonable and our server gave us some spot-on recommendations. He was friendly and professional and gave us just the perfect level of service without being too intrusive.

2009-12-07,2.0,"I heard good things about this place, so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We ordered grilled squid as an appetizer. After taking a bite, my husband started having an allergic reaction immediately (he immediately got up from the table and sprinted down to a drug store to get some allergy medicine). After speaking with the waitress we found out that the sauce had walnuts in it (they neglected to put this on the menu!). We couldn't believe it (we are very good about asking about menu items that typically might contain nuts, this appetizer never sent up any red flags). To add insult to injury, the waitress acted like it was our fault that we didn't tell her about a food allergy (even though nothing we ordered listed anything he was allergic to!). Their failure to do the right thing (offer to replace the appetizer or not charge us for it) left a bad taste in my mouth. Otherwise, the food was decent, however my husband couldn't taste any of his meal with a swollen mouth and numbed tongue. My advice: Beware - the menu doesn't list all ingredients so be sure to say something about an allergy (even if what you are ordering looks safe!).",-0.9485,0.827,0.048,0.125,0.4772354497354498

2009-10-30,3.0,"So much possibility!!!  Loved the atmosphere, location, service, ingredients -- just that the entrees were a disappointment. What I loved -- so many interesting vegetables incorporated into the menu!  I'm not vegetarian by any means, but I think vegetables are delicious and always ignored unless you're at some fancy-pants restaurant.  Fianco offered grilled pumpkin, escarole, rutabaga, brussels sprouts, beets, arugula, etc.  The appetizer list and side options made me very happy. What I didn't love -- the entrees -- they all sounded so delicious, with interesting preparations and ingredients.  I ordered the chitarra (square spaghetti with braised pork cheeks).  The spaghetti texture was perfect, and the pork cheeks tender and succulent, but it was oversauced and overseasoned.  It was so excessively salty that the server offered to bring a cup of the unsalted sauce to mix into my dish.  That toned it down and helped a lot, but the pasta, which was oversauced to begin with, became just swimming in sauce.  My husband ordered the black pepper pappardelle with bolognase, and he felt his dish was really salty as well.  The sauce was also too thick and congealed looking on the pasta, which is too bad, because the pasta texture was really nice. I will go back and maybe try the non-pasta dishes, but I really hope they fix saucing situation with the pasta because talk about a waste of good handmade pasta!  This could be a really terrific restaurant.  Everything on the menu sounded great, and its a lovely room and very good staff.",0.9949,0.722,0.219,0.059,0.6229960317460318
2009-10-08,4.0,"What a great addition to the Southport corridor.  It's nice to have an option other than the standard bar/restaurant joint.  We showed up around 7/7:30 on a Wednesday night.  By 8pm, the place was pretty full, which is saying a lot because it is a decent sized restaurant.  Our waitress was extremely helpful and recommended a nice (and most importantly not exorbitantly priced) bottle of wine.  I had the grilled salad as a starter, and my bf had the duck trio.  I am not a duck fan, but he loved his appetizer.  My salad was good, but it kind of had a grilled burger taste to it.  It was interesting, but something was just a teensy bit off for me. For our entrees, my bf had the bison ravioli, and I had the scallops.  His ravioli was delish, but my scallops were the standout of the meal.  The sweet corn puree was so good I could have eaten a bowl of it.  The scallops themselves were perfectly seared and very flavorful.  Even my bf couldn't stop commenting on them. For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding.  I think I would have loved it more if it wasn't called ""chocolate"" bread pudding.  There were a few pieces of chocolate in it, but they were few and far between.  The caramelized bananas were a nice touch.  Even though we agreed that the bread pudding didn't hold a candle to Rose Angelis', we had no problem eating every last bite.   The service was great, and I loved the ambiance.  With such high ceilings, the space could easily feel too big or empty, but this was not the case.  The restaurant had a warm and cozy feel to it.  We will definitely be back here soon!",0.9962,0.749,0.221,0.031,0.623828828828829
2009-10-03,4.0,"Hubby and I finally tried this place out (been meaning to since it opened), and can't believe we waited so long!  We went around 8pm on a Friday, and though it was crowded (now that we're getting into chilly weather, meaning less available seating and more people going out instead of firing up the grill at home), we were seated right away.  The tables are tight, but why not make use of all the space?  Love the decor, and even though they were clearly understaffed, I felt like the service was great.   To start, my husband got the arancini, which was deeelish, but not the healthiest option.  I got the grilled salad - grilled greens with grilled peaches, gorgonzola, and walnuts.  Loved it.  The cheese was strong and I've never had grilled greens before - interesting flavor with the grill char on them.  A little hard to cut, even with a serrated knife, but worth the effort.  Portions on the appetizers and entrees were generous. For entrees, I got the bison ravioli.  I liked the ravioli, but the sauce made the dish.  Husband got the matagliata, which was exactly what he was in the mood for, and had a nice kick to it.  We shared the chocolate banana bread pudding for desert.  YUM.  Definitely meant to be shared because it is big, heavy, and sweet.  I highly recommend it.

Honestly the only negative thing I have to say us that the paper menu they gave me had butter on it from previous customer , so at first was a little turned off. We went Friday evening at around 7:30 without a reservation and were seated immediately, and it was about 1/3 full and within a half hour all the tables were filled.  It was still packed when we left at 9. Fun atmosphere! We started off with the duck trio, very tasty! The caprese salad is huge and delicious, so fresh!  I had the scallops (4 large scallops) and my husband had the skate-wing which was a special served with couscous and again the flavors blended perfectly.  I am not a big white fish person, but i could have ordered this and been extremely happy!  Our waitress was great and was very knowledgable about wine list which had some unique wines we were not familiar with.  Although we were stuffed we ended with the fresh donut dessert served with chocolate sauce ice cream and berries!

Not to say that the portions are too small, but we werent totally full until our dessert (chocolate banana bread pudding..YUMMY). I had the special, skate wing over a bed of cous cous & my friend had the halibut. They use extremely fresh ingredients and cook all the food perfectly. My skate was crsipy on top and juicy on the bottom-perfection. The halibut was a large, thick portion done the same way. However, I have two complaints. One, my cous cous was really oily and her halibut was as well. Also, the food was a little lacking in flavor. I think the chef believes that if the food is so fresh, you dont really need to season it, but Im sorry sir (or ma'am) you do. Again, wasnt enough to deter me from going back, but you shouldnt EVER have to salt your food unless its scrambled eggs.

But the food just wasn't good.  Not horrible, but definitely not good.  The highlight was duck trio my husband ordered and enjoyed.  I ordered the farro salad which sounded delicious (farro, roasted beets, watercress, celery heart, pistachio, and lemon) but the flavors of the beets, celery leaves (not watercress) - yuck, and pistachio/lemon/farro mix just didn't seem to go together very well.  The farro with the pistachio and lemon did have a very pleasing flavor by itself, though. For entrees, I ordered the matagliata which was just pasta with tomato sauce (albeit heirloom tomato sauce), a sprinkling of basil, and a few spoons of ricotta.  The description on the menu sounded boring and it was very boring, but it was the only vegetarian option on the menu.  I asked if maybe they could do the duck with gnocchi but with no duck, and the chef said no.  The matagliata is the first pasta I've ever tried that I just didn't see the point of eating any more than two bites. My husband ordered the bison ravioli which had a delicious sauce of sweet corn-butter, mushrooms, basil and parmesan.  But he didn't like the actual ravioli at all.  We shared the sauce on his plate and left the ravioli. When we received the check, we felt ripped-off big time.  Especially since we went to Coobah after and had great appetizers and drinks for a quarter of the price.  Very disappointing.",0.9785,0.77,0.147,0.083,0.5973721340388006

For appetizer, we got the antipasto plate - it was not too bad, though only one cheese option. Paired reasonably well  For entrees we got the scallops and the pork which was recommended. The scallops were cooked ok, reasonably sized but a bit lacking in flavor.  The pork though also disappointing - just too much like pulled pork without the sauce, not a lot of exciting flavors and didn't really pair well with its accompaniment.

Fianco's is casual dress but an upscale atmosphere and conversation friendly.  They have a great menu I started with the green bean salad which was great.  They have a pretty decent wine list and I went with a Sicilian white by the glass and it was enjoyable.  For the main entree we both did pasta dishes.  I am Sicilian so I like a little spice in my pasta, so my gigli with lamb sausage was excellent.  The person I went with doesn't like spicy and ordered the maltagliatta which was advertised basically as a basil sauce it was way spicy and she couldn't eat it.  The waitress when told, 'offered condolences' but that was about it.   We would go back to Fianco, and try some of the other dishes on the menu that have been reviewed.  We didn't care for the wait staff, nor the spicy pasta.  However the salads, the wine menu and the possibility of the other items on the menu are enough to get us back.",0.9891,0.782,0.186,0.033,0.49166666666666664

We chatted it up with the bartender, who made some great recommendations for each of our preferences, as neither of us was entirely familiar with all of their Italian wine offerings. When I asked if they did wine flights, he mentioned that although they don't advertise it officially, they could do flights of three or four wines, and said it would only be around $9 or $11 for the flight. That's a steal, in my book! I looked at the menu before I left, and when I saw the duck gnocchi, I knew I'd be back again to try the food. Can't wait to eat there this week!

We sat outside on what ended up being a fairly beautiful evening.  The table was a little cramp but the lady and I are small-ish folk, so it didn't really matter. Our wait (who's name started with a B?) was very personable, and helpful throughout the course of the evening, and definitely added to our overall experience at the restaurant.   So what about the food? We started our meal with the Duck Trio which consists of duck cooked three different ways- each delicious in it's own way.  I think the Trio was my favorite part of the meal, but I'm partial to duck. For dinner itself, the lady got the Chicken Under a Brick, and I got the special of the night which was Atlantic Cod.  That's right- Atlantic Cod.  Most restaurants in the city serve Pacific Cod which doesn't have as much flavor as it's Atlantic cousin.  As a native New Englander, (where, you may have heard, we named a cape for the mighty cod-fish), I was thrilled to hear that Cod was on the menu.  It was served over a bed of fresh corn, and berries, and was flavorful, and full of awesome. The chicken was really good too. Oh, and dessert.  For Dessert we had the Italian Donuts with chocolate dipping sauce and gelato with berries on the side.  They were so good that I will probably not be able to look at my usual Dunkin' Donuts the same way ever again.
