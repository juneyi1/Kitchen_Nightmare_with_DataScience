2006-06-05,5.0,"Very fun hookah restaurant =) I have been here a few times for the cocktails and the smoking of the hookah.  For a flat fee, you can get a hookah or two for your table and friends and smoke the night away.  They provide many different flavors of tobacco to choose from.  And like someone else commented before, they have wonderful belly dancers performing.  The first time I visited Souk my friends and I had a great time dancer on the floor.  Also they have great wait staff here, they always make sure your fire does not go out on the hookah. =P",0.9839,0.708,0.272,0.02,0.5733838383838384
2006-05-19,4.0,"I missed the bellydancing festivities, but the food was absolutely amazing.  My favorite appetizer was the gambas - very succulent shirmp embedded in a flavorful slaw of corn, herbs, and olive oil.  The entrees I tried were also very delicious, but the star of the night was the chocolate and raspberry purse.  So light, yet deadly.  The price range is on the higher end, where you're more likely to spend about $40/person, but I'm sure if I went on a bellydancing night, the price would not play on the radar.  The only qualms I had was the inconsistent service.  The server and busboy were very charming and nice, but they didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Note to Souk: when serving appetizers, it might be a good idea to give extra plates and a serving spoon/fork",0.9899,0.736,0.239,0.026,0.7259259259259259
2006-01-16,3.0,"Don't go here for the food. It's not bad because it's inauthentic Middle Eastern food, it's just bad because it's sort of mediocre. Go here for the late night music and dancing.   I liked the restaurant interior better before the remodel - what it looks like now is sort of prototypical ""cheesy Arab nightclub"" - but it's the best place around to dnce, dance, dance into the wee hours. You won't recognize the songs, or understand the words (it's a v. Arab crowd most nights) but who cares! It's too much fun!!  Surreyah is dancing here now, and she is the BEST belly dancer in Chicago. Absolutely the best and most authentic.",0.9901,0.724,0.276,0.0,0.5614583333333334

2005-10-13,4.0,"Here's a trendy restaurant that decided to stick around. About eight years ago it was one of my favorite new places, featuring ""nomadic"" cuisine from Middle East, Egypt and North Africa. The animal hide chairs are a little frightening, but the food and service and atmosphere are tip top. Cool red bathroom with lighted floor too.",0.5922,0.824,0.12,0.056,0.5560606060606061
