2015-12-12,4.0,I'm very sad to hear that this great little spot has closed. We were just there celebrating my dad's birthday a couple weeks back and we're very happy with not only the service but the delicious food. I had the spinach and cheese ravioli in the cream sauce and my dad opted for the linguini with you thought would have a cream sauce as well but it turns out it had a white wine reduction that he preferred greatly. Hopefully they will be back up and running and not closed for good it would be a shame to see another great little spot shut down.,0.9573,0.716,0.209,0.075,0.5211805555555555
2015-11-28,2.0,"Made a reservation here long in advance. Was left a voicemail that our party would likely have a window seat ""depending on how busy we are."" I actually never even asked for this, but it was a nice gesture. We arrived for our reservation, before the real dinner rush. We were then seated in perhaps the worst table in the restaurant, directly at the hostess' behind.  We then asked if we could indeed have the window seat as we were told we could get that honor ""depending on how busy"" they were. When the head waiter heard this he then said ""well, I left you that voicemail and said that you could have the window seat depending on how busy we are."" At this point, my party and I look around and can see SEVEN empty tables, including the window seat. We didn't even say anything about that because it was ridiculous and obvious that they were being rude. They begrudgingly moved us. It was not an appropriate way to handle paying customers who actually took the time to make a reservation at your establishment. If you aren't going to honor requests, don't ask for them. If you are going to offer something, but then retract it when you are taken up on it, that's on you. The professionalism was embarrassing.

I've had their lasagna with a tomato cream sauce (a weeknight special) and also their vegetable, ham, and goat cheese risotto. Both times, the sauce was so wonderfully flavorful and savory. The garlic is spot on, without an overwhelming presence. The cheese is nice and subtle, with more sauce infused into the pasta. My husband and I also shared their homemade tiramisu.

2015-07-05,3.0,"My friend and I were in the mood for good Italian, and Filippo's delivered pleasantly, if not superbly. The hummus-type dip served with the bread was outstanding--I would buy jars of it if they sold it! Fresh foccacia baked in-house was also outstanding. Our actual appetizer was less than impressive, however; sliced eggplant rolled around proscuttio and goat cheese, then breaded and deep-fried, sounded wonderful, but in practice the goat cheese flavors overwhelmed everything else, and the breading was greasy and flavorless. (The goat cheese combined beautifully with the marinara served on the side, however.) My friend ordered the ravioli neri, which was exceptional; black ravioli stuffed with salmon and cream cheese, served in a tomato and cream ""pink"" sauce. I was much less pleased with my entree, one of the night's specials, which turned out to be a rather tough and dry pork loin stuffed with blue cheese and spinach, then deep-fried in the same greasy, flavorless breading as the appetizer, and plated on garlic mashed potatoes that were inoffensive but not very interesting. Dessert was delicious--a creamy, intensely flavored creme brulee for me, and an espresso-heavy flourless chocolate cake for him. Service was adequate but rather slow, considering the restaurant was almost empty. Overall, I'd be happy to return. But I would recommend against anything fried on the menu and advocate for the pasta instead. And make sure you get some of that heavenly hummus!",0.99,0.799,0.176,0.025,0.5595125039569484

I came here with a friend for dinner on a whim because the famous Pequod's next door had a 60 minute wait time for a table...and we were starving. I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place! We were seated right away with no reservation. The restaurant itself is quite small, but cozy. Small tables and dim lighting set the mood. I just wish there was a bit more space in between each table, as well as through the aisle way. Either way, we were just glad to be seated with no wait. Our waiter went over the night's specials with us and served us some focaccia bread with a hummus-like spread. The bread was just okay, but the spread was fantastic!  When ordering, I asked if they served farfalle pasta, but they said they did not. My friend asked if they could do a pesto alfredo mix, and was told that they do not do pesto, but definitely offer alfredo. However, our server mentioned that they basically do ""build your own"" entrées..i.e. you pick the type of pasta, sauce and any additional topping (chicken, shrimp) and they can make that combo for you. I ended up ordering the Ravioli Annarella. Let me tell you, this was the best Ravioli I've ever had in my life. It's stuffed with spinach and ricotta and put in a white sauce. Let's just say it was orgasmically delicious. Our server mentioned that it was a crowd favorite and now I see why. It was cooked to perfection and the flavors were wonderful. My friend got the standard fettuccine alfredo with chicken--no complaints there. Good portion size, too! For dessert, I opted for the tiramisu. I like to think of myself as somewhat of a tiramisu connoisseur. My friend got the creme brûlée (it was called something different there, but for the life of me, I can't remember the name..). Both were outstanding. The creme brûlée was extremely sweet, while the tiramisu was more of a rich taste, with a strong coffee flavor and a bit of chocolate sauce. It has definitely hit my top 5 list of ""best tiramisu."" We didn't drink any wine since we had already had a few drinks elsewhere before arriving and had to drive, but it looked like they had a decent selection to choose from. I must note that the service was excellent, as well. Not to mention pricing! Seeing as how we didn't drink anything but water, but had two entrées and two desserts, our total was under $60.

However, when our entrees came out, the chicken on my girlfriend's order was dry and the vegetables had clearly been frozen or reheated. The fettuccini itself was delicious. My ravioli had a nice creamy flavor and the pasta, again, tasted fresh. Something about it was a little off toward finishing it, though. Our bill was presented and that was that.

The atmosphere could've been a bit better, but no major complaint. We started with some fried calamari which was great, not overly greasy or overly crispy. The tomato sauce had some good flavor to it as well. For entrees, I got the black ravioli stuffed with salmon. Fantastic. the salmon was good, the ravioli was great and full of flavor - the black color comes from squid ink. It was flavorful and tasty on its own, but they put it all in this truly wonderful (albeit slightly salty) tomato cream sauce. Not quite a vodka cream sauce, but similar in color. You could get little bits of tomato in the sauce. I loved it. My girlfriend got the chicken stuffed with spinach and ham. It was pretty average, not bad, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. We got the bread pudding for dessert, not quite your normal Italian dessert I know, but I have to say it was absolutely delicious. It was rich, warm, the ice cream on top perfectly complemented the bread pudding. And a great portion, more than enough for the two of us. I do want to comment on the environment, the tables are really close together. Maybe that's because it was Valentine's day, but you'd still expect to not be on top of your neighbors. We ended up getting looped into their conversation at times, awkward. And they were pretty casual, which is fine, but you'd expect maybe a bit more formality out of an Italian place on Valentines.

Arriving at 5:45 on a Wednesday, we found the restaurant empty yet there were 4 menus on a table waiting for us. That alone was a great gesture and made us feel really welcome. Everything about the evening was great. The water and bread were brought out promptly. Our drink orders came right away, yet no one hovered or was hard to get the attention of. Our waiter came at just the right time to take our orders. His advice for dishes was right on the money, even suggesting that the ""smokiness"" of a certain plate divided people about how good it was. And his idea of two half orders of two different dishes for my wife couldn't have been more perfect. The fact that the food was fantastic was almost lost in how satisfied we were with everything else. The icing on the cake was...the tiramisu he brought to the table with a candle in it for my wife on her birthday. It was truly one of the best experiences we've had in a restaurant in Chicago.

2014-09-15,5.0,Best Italian I've had outside of Italy! The service @ this place is impeccable as Victor was definitely a huge help in describing certain dishes as well as recommending what was better and what went well with which wines....5 star service definitely...just an all around good guy! Now onto the food. We started out with the grilled calamari & shrimp appetizer...really good! The fettuccine Bolognese was delicious as the meat/tomato sauce was phenomenal. The salmon on top of garlic mashed potatoes was really good as the salmon just melted in your mouth and the garlic potatoes were packed with flavor. The star of the show was the italian sausage stuffed ravioli! Best ravioli I've ever had as the sausage inside had maaaad flavor. lol It came with four pieces of ravioli which was enough for us to share. We surprisingly finished all 3 dishes in addition to the appetizer and really good beet/goat cheese salad. We even had room for dessert which was the very delicious tiramisu. Yep we polished that off as well. We had a very good red wine called Liveli Passamante that of course was recommended by Victor The place itself is a nice size and good for families. The walls are decorated with very modern paintings that can be purchased.

2014-09-14,5.0,"This place is AHHHMAZING!!!  I visited this restaurant a couple days ago and I'm still dreaming of this food.  We were greeted immediately as we entered - they brought water, some garlic bread, and some additional bread with some sort of crushed garlic puree dip.  Definitely not the highlight and I recommend you don't fill up on it.   Décor:  The place is filled with tables they can maneuver around for parties of any size.  My favorite are the tables tucked in the bay windows.  It's not fancy, pretty comfortable.  Highlight - they feature different artists and their work - I loved all the art being featured currently - just wish I knew who the artist was.    Food:  As it was our first time there, we asked the wonderful Victor (our server), for his recommendations.   [I digress:  Victor is everything you dream about in a server -- animated, his passion for the food and drink exudes from his pores, and he's so pleasant and has this wonderful aura about him - seriously, this guy is the real deal.  He certainly made our experience memorable.] As it was our first time there, Victor provided recommendations on the wine, the appetizers, the entrees, and the desserts.  And when I say he provided recommendations, he was more of a sales person and we bought into everything he told us... and let me tell you, it was worth it!  I'm not joking when I say that every bite of food (not just the first bite, EVERY bite) was so good your eyes rolled in utter satisfaction followed by an ""mmmmmm"".  Yes, the food was that delicious.   We mainly ordered items that were on the Specials menu and my absolute favorites were the grilled calamari, the salmon, and the sausage ravioli:    Appetizer: Grilled calamari dish  (absolutely recommend) Salad: Beets, blue cheese, vinaigrette  (very good!) Entrée - Salmon (that they caught the day before), mashed potatoes Entrée - (a split entrée... yes, they can do it!)   1/2 Fettuccini Bolognese and  1/2 Ravioli with Italian sausage in a pink sauce.   Dessert - tiramisu and flourless chocolate espresso cake Please, if you're in the area, make sure you stop by this place.  It's worth it... and be sure to ask for Victor!!",0.9947,0.787,0.174,0.039,0.6175256769374416

My favorite dishes are as follows: Ravioli Annarella, Risotto Fratta, Pollo Valdostana, Rigatoni Napoletana, and their Bolognese. I have never ever liked bolognese cause, even in Italy, but I love theirs. Also no one knows this yet because it's new but they serve DEEP DISH PIZZA and it is SO DAMN GOOD.

The desserts are amazing too, you have to have the bread pudding. Also it's a family owned business and Filippo and his wife Annette are at the restaurant all the time. They are so sweet and their kids work there too!! The whole staff is like a famil-- everyone there is so nice and helpful. Filippo's is the real thing.

2014-08-08,1.0,"This was a random place I decide to eat at while I was in Chicago. The food was good, I did enjoy the complementary bread and what appeared to be hummus dip.  I had the fried calamari which was very good (very light and crispy) and for the entree I ordered the special for the night which was the blue cheese stuffed pork chop on a mound of mashed potatoes. It was very delicious.  However, let me explain this one star review. While the food was very good the overall service was utterly terrible.  To begin, I was in party of six and we all ordered some sort of appetizer, an entree, and drinks.  The bus person came by frequently and filled our water and cleared our table. The waiter on the other hand was beyond terrible. Never in my life have I ever experienced such bad service from a waiter. Keep in mind I was a waiter for years so I understand how hard it can be but I would have never treated my customers in the way their waiter did regardless of their attitude.  We as a party were not being rambunctious to the least and we were pretty well behaved in my opinion. He did not appear to want to serve our group and appeared to be miserable in doing so. Yes, he missed a drink order and quickly rectified it after a comment from management was given and I believe that was when it went further down hill. After ignoring our table for a very long period he decided it was time for the bill, we had asked to split the check (6 ways) not a big deal if they were using a proper point of sale system. Instead, he just stood there and stared at us blankly as if he didn't know what to do then we asked if we could help him out and number the check for him and he agreed.  Once he came back and looked at the check he rolled his eyes at us and left. At this point everyone in the group was completely livid. We just wanted to leave at this point. So one person just left paid for all of us and then he comes back and takes the check and proceeds to charge an automatic 18% tip. There was no sign posted in regards to this not to mention that automatic tips are illegal under the new IRS Rev Ruling 2012-18 which took effect January of 2014 stating: (1) the payment must be made free from compulsion; (2) the customer must have the unrestricted right to determine the amount; (3) the payment should not be the subject of negotiation or dictated by employer policy; and (4) generally, the customer has the right to determine who receives the payment. This restaurant is in violation of all 4 of these guidelines and will be reported as such. The restaurant has noted this as a ""tip"" and not a service charge as mandated by the ruling. Customers in general should avoid this restaurant and customers with larger parties should be aware of this.",0.1256,0.842,0.083,0.075,0.5031077859338728
2014-08-05,4.0,"Closer to 3 but I rounded to 4 because of the excellent service we had and because of the amazing tiramisu. I loved our waiter who was so approachable and gave us wonderful recommendations which did not happen to be the most expensive item on the menu. On the contrary, it was probably one of the least expensive entrees which he also said was one of his favorites.  I got the Ravioli annerella and had the option of choosing either a cream, marinara, or pink sauce. Went with the pink (a mix of the two) and it ended up being a tasty decision. The ravioli is homemade and when it was served hot in the beginning, it tasted awesome. However, after the dish cooled down, the ravioli dough became harder and tougher which I didn't like. I enjoyed the ricotta and spinach filling too but again, once it cooled down, it tasted less than glamorous.   Post-dinner, if you want a dessert option, go for the tiramisu. It's so soft, moist, and fluffy, and it almost melts in your mouth with each bite. I typically don't like tiramisu but it is exquisite here. It's obviously sweet yet not overwhelming at all. I realized later that they often have deals on Groupon which seems like it would be super worth it. As much as I liked the hot ravioli, it just doesn't seem to make sense paying close to $20 for 6-7 squares.",0.9929,0.766,0.192,0.042,0.5753968253968255

2014-06-27,4.0,"This little restaurant is unique and tasty!  I stumbled upon Filippos while searching Groupon for any great deal while visiting Chicago. We reviewed several restaurants and settled on Filippos. Upon walking in I was questioning our decision. The space seemed crowded but the tables were empty. We showed up early to first grab a drink at the bar,  but it was a maze through the tables and chairs to reach the bar located along the very back wall. We decided to sit instead with a view facing the neighborhood.  An old chandelier hung above our table,  but it's elegance was ruined by being covered in dust and cobb webbs. We were immediately served to slices of seasoned bread with a side of ??? The serving assistant just set the two plates down and left.  I caught his attention a minute later to ask what the mystery dip was. He shortly responded humus with a look that could have said how could you not know? It looked different from any humus I have had before but we dug in.  Strong onion flavor but it was delicious!  We didn't see our waitress for sometime. First things first I let her know we had a Groupon to make sure we ordered correctly.  She seemed confused and just walked away. I think she was just figuring out what it entailed.  She rattled off a few numbers and I corrected showing her the groupon shows that it's value was almost double what she stated.  Once again she just had her head down and walked away. Poor girl was pretty young and seemed intimidated by all the questions, but she may have just been new. We ordered a bottle of wine and the calimari appetizer. We nearly finished our app before the wine arrived. The calimari was perfect!  Seasoned correctly and cooked properly. Yum! The wine had to be served from the bartender due to the waitress being too young.  It was almost like he was frantically trying to open the bottle he kept stumbling over the wrap, but finally removed it, and it then took him two tries to remove the cork.  These are minor details but they were observations mostly because it was distracting.  There was cork in my glass after the initial pour but that was minor and easily removed.  The wine was a great red with our dinner.  I wish I could remember the name it was similar to LiVille. It wasn't too dry nor too sweet. My house salad arrived next and it was also delicious!  The fresh carrots, cucumbers,  tomatoes all perfectly tossed with their signature seasoning and balsamic vinaigrette.  I pretty much devoured the salad. My other half ordered the black ravioli filled with salmon in a light creamy tomato sauce and I ordered the spinach and ricotta stuffed ravioli in the house cream sauce. Both were to die for! On both there was a baked on parmesan crust that just made the dish.  We both we stuffed but finished every last bite.  I opted out of my dessert for an espresso.  I asked if they had a menu with their drinks or coffees listed but unfortunately they do not. My other half ordered the chocolate lava cake. My espresso was a little burnt but delicious all the same. The lava cake was fantastic.  We debated if it was ever going to come out but upon it's arrival we decided it must have been fresh. It was a great chocolate flavor paired with what tasted like a hazelnut gelato. He ate every last crumb! Our Groupon covered our food cost so our bill was only $35.00 instead of $150... not bad!  The food was outstanding but slightly over priced.  I may think this because the service and atmosphere didn't pair with the pricing, but overall this place was delicious. We left uncomfortably stuffed so that's saying something.  As a tourist I definitely recommend.  It allowed us to get away from the city and hustle and bustle and experience a different neighborhood.

2014-05-27,2.0,"I can describe this place in one word: overpriced. My girlfriend and I came here with a groupon, and without one this place is way overpriced. We started with the cheese plate, which was the appetizer special for that evening. For $17 we basically got only a few small pieces of cheese. Granted the cheese was very good, but definitely overpriced. For the next course, we got the ensalata tricolore ($9) or whatever it's called, basically fried eggplant, tomato, and cheese. For the main course, I got a piece of veggie lasagna, and my  girlfriend got salmon stuffed ravioli - $19 each. We both thought the food was good and appeared homemade. The lasagna was enjoyable, but not super flavorful, and my girlfriend thought the ravioli was too salty. For dessert, I got carrot cake and my girlfriend ordered lava cake with gelato - $8 each. Apparently, the only flavor of gelato they had was vanilla, which is kind of weak. This is definitely a family style or friends type of restaurant, but not somewhere for a romantic date or nicer meal. The service was pretty good, but it could be a bit slow at times between courses. Sometimes the water was filled without having to ask and a couple other times I had to ask for it to be filled. Given that this place isn't really fancy, and the food is good but not amazing, I just can justify the prices without a groupon I've quoted. I especially don't think the cheese plate is worth $17 and one piece of veggie lasagna is worth $19.

In addition complimentary eggplant. Both of these starters are amazing and it's a nice touch from the restaurant.  Portobella Alla Griglia $13 - Divine appetizer to get our meal going. I have a slight obsession with mushrooms and particularly portobellas. This mushroom was grilled well, sitting atop a bed of spinach with a yummy sauce. Fettuccine Bis $18 - What struck out to me instantly with this dish was how creamy it was and how fresh all the vegetables both looked & tasted. It was chocked full of mushrooms, peas & broccoli, as well as ham. I don't know if they handmake their noodles but they sure tasted like they were. I had already eaten so much at this point I could only have a few bites before nearing explosion. I was able to take this to go & enjoy the next day. I highly recommend this dish! Flourless Chocolate Espresso Torte - Even though I was near a dying point in my fullness level, there's always room for dessert right!? Especially if it's chocolate.

2014-03-08,1.0,"Disappointed. I purchased a Groupon for Filippo's Restaurant per a raving review from a coworker.  Needless-to-say, my Groupon expired and after I realized this fact, I asked a friend to go with me to try it last night. Our experience started with their complimentary focaccia with tomato, traditional crusty bread and olive oil dip with a vinegar eggplant resting in the middle of the oil. The focaccia was very good. The oil and bread was just that... oil and bread. Good, but nothing to rave about. The waiter was very nice and asked us about wine. My friend is not a drinker and is trying to learn about and like wine. The wine menu is very small and of the two choices of red he brought to my friend to try, both tasted very low quality for $9. The wine glasses are very small with stems, but the pour fills the glass. Yet, it still didn't seem worth the $9 price tag. We started our meal by choosing two of the specials. (I'm usually a bit cautious about specials due to the overall 'push' to sell aging product, and I've had food poisoning more than a few times due to these poor choices in the past... but, I went with it the appease my friend because I'm nice!:) We started with the seafood appetizer trio of  shrimp, calamari and octopus. I don't love octopus and the server offered to omit it. I said to keep some octopus on the plate because my friend likes it. The plate arrived with no octopus. The plate was lacking flavor and tasted grilled and dry. It was sitting on a bed of chopped red endive with a straight vinegar undertone. Not much going on here on this plate and my friend was bummed, no octopus.  Next, we ordered the special pasta of beef and sweet mozzarella stuffed ravioli with a tomato cream sauce. It sounded interesting at first, and after thinking about it, before it arrived, I started to wonder why you would pair four (4) heavy items together like that? I was beginning to regret my decision before it arrived. When the ravioli arrived, the beef was 'ground' beef. The pasta on the ravioli was uber thick and slightly too undercooked to the point of maybe 30 more seconds in the hot water might have produced a more appropriate 'al dente.'  But, the pasta was just too thick reminding me of a dumpling or thick exterior of a pierogi. The sauce, was a typical tomato cream, and a little on the 'chunky' side, which I did like. As I suspected, before this dish arrived... not a winner. Too much going on with this one. Lastly, we ordered off the menu. We decided on the veal scallopini. This dish also had a heavy sauce, loaded with mushrooms and more sweet mozzarella, served with a side of spinach. This dish was less than average and found myself eating it to 'eat' and decided to stop eating it. This dish (the sauce and the veal) lacked flavor and was overall too loaded down with 'stuff.' The mozzarella cheese was not a positive addition to this dish. This was our least favorite of all three choices. We did appreciate that the kitchen split all of our plates and coursed it out for us, which afforded us an opportunity to share our thoughts on our meal and try several things. All in all, Fillippo's Restaurant seems to have a good following... and, might be a good place to meet up with friends. However, this was not my idea of an excellent Italian meal. If you like to eat, just to eat and don't care that much about the food, the overall combinations of the food, or the flavor... then, this might be the place for you.",0.9937,0.788,0.139,0.073,0.4193870625901876

The food was delicious.  The complimentary faccacio and bread with delicious olive oil were an amazing start.  The Involtini Di Melzanane appetezier is an eggplant, prosciutto, and goat cheese roll which has been breaded and fried, and comes with marinara sauce.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like eggplant loved it.  I chose a special, the Caprese Salad, as the salad choice.  It was still good, but probably my least favorite part of the meal since everything else was so outstanding. Entrees - Just get the Ravioli Annarella which is homemade (gigantic) ravioli filled with ricotta & spinach.  It comes with a cream sauce which is approximately one stick of butter per plate, and absolutely delicious.  My BF absolutely loved his Rotolo which I had never heard of before. Just when you think you can't eat another bite, you each get to pick your own dessert.  I got the tiramisu which was very good, and to my surprise the BF went with the waiter's suggestion and got the bread pudding.  I don't know if I've ever even had bread pudding, but it was so so good. On top of the amazing food, the service was great.  The waiter explained the groupon and made some great menu recommendations.  It is so nice in here since it is quiet, so it is a great date spot.

This sounded intriging  & make no mistake, it is very special. However, it was the marinara sauce that bowled me over. It was so tomato-y tasting.

2013-09-21,1.0,"I don't like writing these kinds of reviews, but on a few occasions, they are merited. I had made a reservation on open table for a party of 8 (which was for my italian wine group). I had asked if it would be possible to cap the corkage at $80. I noted that this is a frequent group and that we were really looking forward to eating here.  Fast forward a couple of weeks to the night of the dinner. I walk in and I don't even see a table for 8 set up. Needless to say I'm kinda miffed as Open table had sent me two reminders in the days leading up with zero indication of what was to happen. I should note that I have rarely ever had the problem I would run into. Every other restaurant has been willing to work with us as we are clearly willing to give them theirs, but we are also bringing in an expensive cover for the night (plus wine that would go the staff).  When I go to the bar, I was told that the GM had called me and left me a message on my phone. Well, I promptly show my recent calls (which have numbers going back 3 weeks) and there is certainly no voicemail and certainly no phone number from either the GM's personal cell or Filippo's phone. The staff give me her number and I call her to figure out what is going on. I tell her that I certainly didn't receive a call and she claims that she left a message on my voicemail (note, I double checked my opentable account to make sure my phone number is correct. It is, and I have absolutely 0 record of her calling me before all the fun started). Now, I was too confused to ask her what my number was (even though my number is in open table and she took her sweet time answering from my cell number on a number that she allegedly called and left a message), but she then told me that the corkage is $25 per bottle (which is in direct conflict with the corkage listed on GOBYO:  gobyo.com/restaurants/ch… ). She gave me a schpiel about how this is how they make their money and citing dram shop laws (which oddly haven't been a problem with EVERY OTHER ESTABLISHMENT I'VE DEALT WITH), but my group could buy bottles off their list and that they had some bottles for under $25 per bottle. Well, the whole friggin point is that the bottles that we were bringing would be a ton better than their $24 bottle (which as someone who works in retail damn well knows that said $24 bottle usually costs about $9-12 retail at best). In all honesty it was somewhat insulting considering I had been very open with what this dinner was going to be in my open table comments that they didn't do a thing about until the very last minute.  The kicker was that she tried calling me (for the first time that my phone registered) while I was trying to figure out what on earth to do. I then talked to her on Filippo's phone where she then stated to me that she might be able to work out corkage with me once everyone was there and she knew how many bottles would be open (which I had already said over 10, but she gave me no figure on what could/would be worked out). Basically I knew we were going to be taken for a ride right there even though I had asked weeks earlier for a set corkage and I had zero contact with them up until 15 minutes before the dinner about the issue.  I was honestly shocked as I've never come across a situation like this in the 6+ years of me doing wine dinners around the city. Nothing was set up for our group and everything was being changed at the last second even though the place was maybe a 1/3rd filled on a Thursday evening. What brings me to doing this review is the complete lying from the GM and treating my group like a bunch of idiots. All of the situations she brought up have never been a problem for any group I've dealt with in the past 6 years. On top of that, they knew these issues existed from the beginning ( if we are to truly believe them), and didn't do a damn thing until the very last minute. They forced us to scramble or take it. I'm not exactly someone to sit there and take it, and I certainly don't appreciate the whole way all of this came about.  If all of this had been taken care of even several days earlier, all would be fine in my world. I understand that sometimes things don't work out, but for the love of god, don't drop this crap on me at the last second. It was utterly classless and they clearly had no intention of us even being there in the first place(again, they didn't even have an 8 person table prepared even knowing for a couple of weeks that this was happening).  I can't help but be mad as this had literally never happened to me before. Filipppos, you may have good food, but there are a ton of quality Italian establishments in this city and you are now completely on my shit list.

2013-04-14,4.0,"This is an awesome date restaurant for before/after seeing a movie at Webster Place Theater. Massive pasta portions. We were planning on ordering individual entrees until we saw a massive bowl of pasta pass by. We split the Sausage and Portabella Mushroom pasta. Not only was it enough to feed both of us, but it was incredibly tasty. Great tomato sauce, perfectly cooked mushroom and ample amounts of sausage. We noticed that the awesome, fennel-ly, sausage taste suspiciously like the awesome sausage that Pequod's next door puts on their masterful pizzas. Coincidence? Maybe. Maybe not... Also it's a pretty affordable place - entrees around $15-20 and again, the pastas are big enough to split. I also have to give them credit for creating an old-world Italian atmosphere that feels awesomely similar to the restaurant where Michael shoots Solozzo and McClusky in the movie ""Godfather"".

2013-04-13,2.0,"I'm half Italian and my husband and I eat a lot of Italian food, so I know of what I speak and I have to say that although the atmosphere, service, and prices are fine, I was disappointed with Filippo's food. Rigatoni Con Bracioline - thinly sliced prime beef stuffed with raisins, garlic, parmesan and fontina cheese over rigatoni in a light tomato sauce. Fettuccine Bis - sauteed in a light cream sauce with chopped ham, broccoli, peas and mushrooms. I was excited to try the rigatoni dish because I haven't had braciole, although technically it was involtini (thinly-sliced beef rolled around a stuffing of cheese), in a very long time. For sixteen dollars, you get a lot of rigatoni and one beef roll and I have three complaints--the rigatoni was undercooked (which seems to be a common thing now in Italian restaurants), the sauce was quite bland, and, although the beef roll was delicious, you only get one. I would prefer the pasta cooked a few minutes more (still al dente, but not as undercooked as what I received) and I would have liked at least one more roll of beef. I understand that they use prime beef, but after slicing the beef thin, I think they can use a less expensive cut of meat and give their customers more of it because the filling of raisins, garlic, parmesan and fontina cheese is delicious. I only tried a little of the fettuccinne, but my husband seemed to like it. Overall, I felt a bit jipped only getting a huge plate of underdone rigatoni with a bland sauce and only one braciole, so I don't see us returning anytime soon, but if we do, I'll most certainly update my review.",0.9621,0.898,0.086,0.015,0.5740408163265306

My girlfriend's dish was less stellar than mine, but by no means bland.  She got the Fettucini Bis, which came with a cream sauce that was surprisingly light (for a cream sauce).  Normally I'd expect a dish like that to be swimming in butter. Wine by the glass with standard pricing ($9 or so) with decent pours.  Parking is a bit tricky due to the location (Pequod's is always going to draw a crowd) but we were able to find parking just up the street.

I'm guessing the menu was authentic Italian, because I wasn't use to seeing a lot of the ingredients that went into each dish. This place isn't American Italian (Olive Garden), but I love pasta so I knew I would like. I ordered the Pollo Ripieno.

I got to tell you, the potatoes were PERFECT. They had great flavor and were really soft. I LOVED them (Mouth is watering thinking about them). The chicken was nice and juicy, tender. I had never been a fan of blue cheese, but it definitely went along well with my dish, it didn't have any unexpected taste different than any other cheese I've tasted.

2012-08-15,5.0,"Okay, time to get down and serious about reviewing last weekends picks.  Put Filippo's Ristorante in the heart of Toscana and it would blend right in. Everything fits, from the reasonably priced bottles of wine to the kitschy flickery-candle décor. It's all perfect. All you have to do is sit down, close your eyes, take a sip of wine, open them again, and you're in Italy. The food is simply fantastic. They start you off with roasted eggplant in olive oil and spices with fresh bread and tomato focaccia slices, which are to die for, (so, we asked for more).  I should mention that because of those reasonably priced bottles of wine, we ordered two bottles, right off the bat.  Really good move if you're going to be here for a while. Each was only $30 and both were great. We each marked a favorite half way through the bottles. I finished mine, she didn't quite finish hers, weak-sauce. Appetizer was eggplant rolled in prosciutto with goat cheese and fried. Really tasty, and I'm not a massive fan of goat cheese, but the flavors were really good.  Now time to thank Melanie S. for whispering the secret about splitting plates... thanks Melanie! Shhh!  It's a brilliant idea.  Primi: Half order of black salmon ravioli in pink sauce, wow, delicioso! The squid ink in the black ravioli is 'just there' and compliments the salmon. Also, a half order of pennette with pancetta and pepperoncino. Spicy and super.

2012-05-30,4.0,"In a conscious effort to patronize more establishments that I've driven or walked by a thousand times without ever trying, I have now visited Filippo's twice. I think it's been around for close to twenty years, so better late than never I guess. Both times have been on a weeknight, during prime dinner hour. I cannot understand why this place isn't busier, but maybe it's more crowded on weekend nights. Regardless, it's a cute place with above-average food, and it's worth checking out. You'll start off with complimentary tomato bread (it's been a little too scorched on the bottom on both visits but is tasty nonetheless), and olive oil with garlic and red pepper flakes served with crusty bread. For a relatively small place, the menu is impressively abundant and I've tried a number of things on it. Fried calamari: B+; good flavor, crispy, but a tad greasy. Served with marinara, but I tend to skip it and go for lemon liberally squeezed all over. Insalata ignorante: A-; fresh greens, excellent dressing, and chock full of tomatoes, cucumbers, mozzarella and artichoke hearts. Fettucine boscaiola: A; pasta tossed with five (!) kinds of mushrooms in a delicate garlic/white wine sauce. Delicious and earthy; simultaneously rich yet somehow light. Pollo pizzaiola: A+; tender chicken breasts, with a sauce of fresh tomatoes, herbs and garlic and white wine. I found myself compelled to try this dish on both visits, it was just that good. Budino di riso: C+; when I saw they had a baked rice pudding on the menu, I nearly wept with joy. Sadly it didn't measure up. I don't even know how to describe this dessert, but it was just...weird, and cloyingly sweet. Service is quite relaxed...perhaps a little too relaxed. On both visits I had the same waiter and there were but a few occupied tables, and it took forever. When we mentioned we needed a second to decide on wine, it was another ten minutes before he came back, and that theme continued. Once we got our appetizers, it was another twenty minutes after we finished those before we got our mains...and so on. I didn't necessarily mind since we weren't in a rush and were having a good time catching up, but one doesn't always have 2.5 hours to eat dinner. Overall, Filippo's is cute spot, and the food is well prepared and very fresh. The menu offers tons of pastas with many sauce options, chicken dishes, risotti, as well as daily specials. They don't really advertise it on the menu, but if you ask nicely, they'll give you half-portion sizes of most things on the menu - all the better to order way more food than you need.",0.9978,0.802,0.182,0.016,0.5275

Once we were seated (I made a reservation for 6:30p on a Saturday night) and ordered a couple bottles of {really great} wine, we were given a basket of warm, crusty bread, a plate of foccacia with a little tomato sauce on top, and some incredibly tasty olive oil with what I believe were shaved mushrooms on top.  All of this was so good, we couldn't wait to see what the rest of the meal would bring. To start we tried their Caprese salad which was on their board of specials for the night.  The mozzarella was just ridiculous-so fresh and delicious, its really some of the best I've ever had outside of Italy.  For my main dish I chose the Rigatoni Zughi  Zughi which is rigatoni pasta sauteed with sun-dried tomatoes and porcini mushrooms in a creamy pink sauce.  This was a delicious, fantastic, amazing pasta dish!  The sauce had a bit of a smoky flavor to it and everyone at our table agreed it was really, really good.   The rest of our table ordered pasta dishes as well that were equally as delicious.  Among us we tried the Fettuccine Masaniello, Spaghetti Integrali, and one of their specials that was spaghetti in a light white wine sauce with several different kinds of seafood and vegetables mixed in.  I would recommend any of these dishes; the sausage in the Fettuccine Masaniello was so flavorful, the vegetables in the Spaghetti Integrali so fresh, and the seafood and vegetables in the special were cooked to perfection. We ended our meal with Strawberry and Hazelnut gelato, Carrot Cake, and of course, Tiramisu.  The Carrot Cake stole the show for me, and I'm not even really a big Carrot Cake fan.  The Tiramisu was very good as well but maybe just a little too much liquid on the bottom layer for me.  This has for sure become are go-to spot for Italian in the city, I can't wait to go back!!",0.9889,0.866,0.134,0.0,0.50684126984127
2012-04-03,4.0,This place is definitely one of those things I miss about living in Chicago. The spaghetti and meatballs are likely some of THE best I've had in the city. Plus they give you this little dish of olive oil with a splash balsamic and sprinkled with shaved portobellos in it that are just yum! Not a bad dish in the place.

Every single dish at our 8-person table (lasagna, bolognese, angel hair and roasted veg, seafood alfredo...the list goes on) looked (and from what I could tell, tasted) amazing. Accordingly, this place was jammed on a Saturday night.  Despite our reservation, we had to wait about 25 minutes for a table. And the tiny, five-seat bar was not up to the task. Luckily, it was a warm evening and I didn't mind standing outside. Once seated, the bread and oil came out and the waters were endlessly refilled. I ordered the beet salad special. Wowsa. Super flavorful. The sweetness of the beets went so well with the tanginess of the feta and spicy black pepper that I doused on top. Not an earth-shattering combo but hey, if it works, it works.  I felt a little bad ordering a salad at a table of seven other ladies opting for heavy pasta, but having just come from a popcorn and candy splurge fest at the movie theater, I really didn't think I could manage a whole pasta dish. Lucky for me, the salad was huge and filled up my now-growling stomach that seemed to instantly expand upon seeing the pasta dishes.  The only hitch is that this place apparently can't split checks very well due to their computer system. It took 30 minutes for them to run our cards, some of it due to a mix-up that was our fault (someone forgot to put their card in).

During our wait, I noticed the host? manager? woman was running around scoping out tables but sort of lingering and  trying to see who would be leaving soon. It was awkward and as a diner, a big turn-off.  We finally get seated and the tables are on top of each other. Smelling cigarette smoke from the guy next to me was not terribly appealing.  I can't recall what I ordered, but it was one of the specials and a pasta dish consisting of crab with a cream sauce. It was tasty and the crab tasted really fresh.

The atmosphere was cozy and not so loud so we could all hear each other talk. The menu is large, just like the portions. People are right--the food here is really good. It's actually one of the better Italian restaurants I've been to. Everyone liked their orders. I had the rigatoni with pink sauce and sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms. I liked how the sauce covered, but did not drench, the pasta. The tomatoes were aged well and had just a hint of tartness to it, while the mushrooms were juicy and cut into perfectly sized slivers. Everything balanced the dish well. We ordered two bottles of wine, one during dinner and one afterward while we were chatting. It was a great experience until then, and I was thinking that this place was a definite 5 stars. We were finishing and paying when the manager (? I'm not sure who she was) abruptly came over to us and said we needed to leave NOW because other people were waiting for our table. This happened while we were paying our bill, signing our checks, and putting our coats on.  I understand that during busy dining hours establishments appreciate it when customers are considerate and not hanging around at the table for a long time. We weren't doing that. We paid our bill right after we finished our second bottle. I've actually never encountered an experience where restaurant management directly told us we needed to leave.

Well, that happened to me and Filippo's House Special: Fresh Salmon Filet. My friend had made reservations for a party of 20 for her birthday and they were very accommodating even though the group was half an hour late. I was quite surprise as to how empty it was for being such a delicious restaurant! Small, intimate, and just perfect for a group outing or a date.  We were given complimentary pizza bread - that's what it tasted like to me and regular bread with a spread, which from reading the reviews is made of roasted eggplant and olive oil? Didn't matter because I really enjoyed it and the love the heavy garlic flavor. Their fresh salmon filet special was phenomenal, beyond describable. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The next morning I woke up wishing I could have some for breakfast. Yup, that was how good it was. Made with a white wine sauce and cherry tomatoes and served with a side of vegetables (normally comes with cornmeal), you get a nice piece of salmon filet (about 8 inches) that was cooked to perfection, tasty sauce and tender vegetables. I love it so much I shared about 1/3 of it to some of the people in our group and a few were bummed they didn't get it also.  The rest of the party enjoyed their dishes. And my boyfriend who ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo (even though it was not on the menu and not a real Italian dish) loved his dish. The sauce was perfect.  The birthday girl enjoyed her risotto, perfect amount of sauce, not too tomato-y and the tiramisu also, not overly sweet. Service was great, our water and drinks were constantly refilled and for such a big party our food arrived in a timely manner. So happy I found a great Italian place!

I was shocked to find that many well rated Italian  dining spots, offered only one or two meatless dishes. Flippo's fortunately listed quite a number that sounded delectable. And the place was not far from home. We had a great time from the start. It was a weeknight and not very busy, and we had the joy of not only having a nice server, but the aid and imput from the co-owner, Annette. Service was immediate but never intrusive.  The bread and the terrific eggplant olive oil was a hit., and consumed in an instant----and new bread was brought instantly.  When we couldn't decide between several pastas, Annette offered split orders----- . I had the creamy ravioli (that I'm craving as I type) and my niece had the pasta with the smoked mozzarella and the 5 mushroom pasta. All were yummy. A nice touch was that while we were still eating our salads (talking way too much) our entrees were ready., and the server moved the empty table next to us so we could spread out. I don't think in eons of eating out that this was ever done before.   When it came time for desert once again as Annette recited the offerings, we couldn't make up our minds)it was my birthday as  well). As we debated between the homemade gelato, the flourless chocolate cake with the molten center, and  the creme brulee, , Annette suggested  a sampler platter. Well as she came out with our dessert she was chuckling and then so were we.------Instead of the typical sampler, Annette brought us out every single dessert , not small sized but a regular portion, and decorated with fresh fruit. Every item was delicious . The creme brulee was the best I had ever had.  As i said the whole night was magical. I don't expect  that night to exactky happen again----but what I do expect and receive from this jewel of a place , is warm concerned service, reasonable prices  and succulent food.

My life seems to be ruled more by Murphy's Law. My keys are in the last place I look for them, my bread will inevitably fall and land butter-side down, etc. So when out for a nice little date night on Saturday we see this Italian ristorante I was full of worry and thoughts of Lean Cuisine-style pasta.  At 9 p.m. on Saturday night this place was poppin'! However we were still immediately seated and brought the most delicious focaccia bread and garlic-y EVOO with roasted shavings of eggplant. That was gone in minutes. Maybe seconds. The menu features more true to real Italian cooking that I've seen in many places, including five options of risotto and several seafood dishes. Everything was just mouth-watering. Black fettuccine with mussels and generous portions of grilled calamari, risotto in a light red sauce with ham and spring veggies, we couldn't stop eating! The risotto could have cooked a few minutes more, and some of the mussels were a bit sandy. But overall the experience was fantastic. I wish we could have stayed for coffee and dessert. It's the kind of place you feel comfortable relaxing in and taking your time. The prices were also very fair and the portions are massive.

We had some friends come in for dinner tonight and they asked my brother and I to pick a place.  After asking my trusty restaurant recommender (Yelp, of course), I chose this place based on the 4.5 star avg. review.  Good Italian food is not hard to find and it's probably one of my favorite kind of foods, so it's not hard to please me with Italian food. This place, however, was impressive. The restaurant is small and quaint and has a good casual atmosphere.  The waitstaff was very nice and very on top of things.  I agree with several reviewers -- my water glass was never less than half full.  But by no means were they intrusive.  When you sit down they serve you bread and pizza bread and some amazing pickled olive oil (sounds weird but it was outstanding).  Both were excellent starts to the meal and a sign of good things to come. I ordered the Neapolitan-style lasagna.  Wowza was it delicious.  It was layers of noodles, lightly breaded eggplant, spinach, mushrooms, and cheese.  It also had a tasty marinara sauce.  This is, hands down, one of the best lasagnas I've ever tasted.  You're not going to believe this, but I actually SAVED half my piece so that I could bring it home and experience it again tomorrow night!!! My fellow diners were also more than pleased with their selections.  Here's some more major points for Filippo's...one of the other diners couldn't choose between two entrees.  When he asked the waiter for a recommendation the waiter told him he could have a half portion of each!  Talk about accommodating.  And they were very generous 1/2 portions.  Also, when we got our food, you could tell it was hot and fresh.   One last important thing that contributes to my 5 star review...prices.  The prices were very reasonable compared to some of the other Italian restaurants I've eaten at in the area.   The portions were a good size and the ingredients were high-quality.   Hmmm....maybe I won't save that lasagna for tomorrow....",0.9958,0.797,0.183,0.021,0.5381358024691361

FOOD The choices on the menu were fabulous and I had trouble deciding which dish to order.  I would have gone for a risotto (5 different ones!), but that itch was recently scratched...so to speak. After scanning the menu, I narrowed it down to two - Fettuccine Bis and Ravioli Neri.   Fettuccine Bis? Ravioli Neri? Ooooh, bread!  Such a nice way to curb my appetite while deciding on what to order.  How delicious with the olive oil and what appears to be thinly sliced pieces of eggplant!  The focacia bread with tomato sauce was soft and tasty, too! Where was I?  Fettuccine Bis? Ravioli Neri? Let me get one of them antipasti and then decide... Calamari Fritti - Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Two thumbs up. Fettuccine Bis. Ravioli Neri. Fettuccine Bis. Ravioli Neri. Fettuccine Bis. Ravioli Neri. Okay, lets try something new. Ravioli Neri - It sounded good in the reviews, so I ordered it, thus reiterating the good old wise rule of thumbs to stick with my first instinct.  The black ravioli and pink sauce not only looked good but tasted good.  Unfortunately, the actual salmon filling was fishy (and not in a figurative sense).  Bummer.   Dessert choices included tiramisu, flourless chocolate cake, creme brulee, and bread pudding. Flourless Chocolate Cake - WOW! Yes! Slightly crunchy top with a rich, smooth and surprisingly light body.  I'm not sure if this is how flourless chocolate cakes are supposed to be, but they all should be like this.  Others I have tried have been too thick and heavy for my liking.  The caramel sauce complemented this cake really well.  By far, the sexiest dessert I've ever had. Overall, a very good experience.  I'm going to come back for you, Fettuccine Bis! SERVICE Fast and friendly!  A nice alternative to slow and creepy.

Just nice, creamy, and fluffy with the right amount of bitterness from the rum and coffee flavors. Here's my take on Italian food. IMO, it's pretty easy to make good pasta. Hell, even pizza hut pasta isn't that bad. What's difficult though is making pasta that stands out as excellent. This is what Filippo's has done. I was wondering how an Italian place could get 4.5 stars on yelp - I figured it had super large portions or something. But after my first bite, I realized that the food here really stands out.

The only downsides of this place were that it was really cold (probably because the heat wasn't set to kick on that early and, after all, it was February in Chicago) and we were seated next to the basement (?) door and people and workmen were going down there the whole time with ladders and god-knows-what-else. Our server seemed like part of the family that owns the place.  Very nice. Very laid back sweatshirt and jeans kind of service.

After readin the reviews on Yelp, we made sure to order the grilled seafood appetizer and we also had some kind of deep fried rolled egglplant stuffed with prosciutto and goat cheese.  We never got the seafood, I guess they forgot about it or didn't hear us order, and we couldn't have eaten it anyway.   They served some delicious warm tomato-topped pizza bread and lots of chewy sliced plain bread served with seasoned olive oil for dipping with some kind of really good pickled vegetable (cucumber?) in it.  Of course, we filled up on the bread and then the deep-fried stuffed eggplant.  Our entrees were fantastic. I  had half orders of roast chicken and seafood risotto. My partner had the other half of the roast chicken (for obvious reasons, the roast chicken was the only entree they couldn't do just a half order of, but they split it and plated it individually with risotto for each of us). The risotto was creamy with just the right al dente bite to it.  The roast chicken was juicy in a fabulous butter and lemon sauce. The skin was a tad limp where it could have been crisper, but was a great choice.  My father in law got a half order of some kind of chicken breast wrapped in smoky bacon. My mother in law had a great vegetarian lasagna which she barely put a dent in before getting it wrapped for home.

We started our meals with a nice glass of the house wine (I had the red and my boyfriend had the white) and we both really enjoyed the selections.  We usually never drink enough to get a bottle, so I can't say what the prices/selection was like, but they seemed to have quite a large menu.   I tried the Rigatone con Bracioline and it was very yummy.  I liked the idea of roast beef and raisins mixed together, and it made for a good flavor combination.  However, I was disappointed with the slices of beef - they were kind of rolled up and a little dry, so it made the entire dish a bit difficult to eat.  There also wasn't as much sweet from the raisin as I had expected, so it didn't offset the tomato sauce as much as I thought it would.  The dish was still good, but it definitely had the potential to be a lot better and that was disappointing. My boyfriend chose the Nodino di Vitello, which is a breaded veal chop.  Since he absolutely loves veal and anything related to it, he thought the dish was fanstastic, especially with the wine.    We decided to skip dessert since we were going to a movie across the street, but the selections on the menu looked great. Filippo's is a pretty small place, but it wasn't that busy when we arrived around 7 p.m. on a Saturday night.  Some of the tables were full and they are able to accommodate large-ish groups, so come a bit early if you're going to bring five or more people.  The restaurant wasn't too loud or bright, which is always nice for me since I hate extremes in both of those areas.  It was pretty romantic, so a good spot for a date, but be prepared to sit quite close to other diners once the place fills up.  Very rustic feel inside and the decor was très Italian, fitting in with the authentic feel the restaurant is trying to accomplish.",0.9951,0.77,0.178,0.053,0.5758354218880534

There was also a request at the table for fried calamari, which came out perfect - very lightly battered and slightly crunchy.  The Rigatoni Con Bracioline I had afterwards was decent too, but nowhere as good...the beef was wrapped up in a roll/ball more like I've come to expect from Mediterranean style meat.   The only downer to Filippo's was that I was oddly seated as person #9 at a long table (clearly multiple tables put together), sitting at the end in front of the door.  So Filippo's...I wouldn't recommend coming in parties of more than 6 to be seated comfortably.  The rest of the restaurant was mostly 2s and parties of 4.  And service is a tad slow, though quite personal as my friend mentioned he is always served by the same guy. Prices are very reasonable here.  I think if I come back I may do what he does and simply order 2 of the seafood platter!",0.9915,0.776,0.195,0.029,0.5502028218694885

Reservations were at 5:30 p.m. and there were some tables available but come 6, they were completely full. We started with their bread and addicting olive oil dip. I think it was thinly slices of zucchini in it and it was tasty. Our calamari came next and it was a good portionsof fried goodness. My husband and I ordered the rigatoni with cheese and a chicken dish that was stuffed with spinach, blue cheese and something else. The pasta was amazing. I know red sauces are better for you and all but I always seem to want to get creamy dishes but I was trying to be good. I don't know what is in it but I couldn't believe how great the sauce tasted. The chicken was good, but not as great as I thought it would have been from the description. We were totally stuffed so no dessert this time. Overall, I definitely would come back but reading other chicken experiences reviews, I'd stick to the pastas as those sound like the stand out items. Also, I was a little disappointed that they didn't have any focaccia bread to serve. When I asked the waiter said it was still in the oven and I guess it was still baking when we left.",0.9525,0.804,0.132,0.064,0.5194444444444444

Complimentary focaccia topped with tomato paste and regular (unfortunately not heated) baguettes served with some savory olive oil with thinly sliced zucchini slices.  Insalate ignorante was full of fresh ingredients, and they obliged to light dressing (although it wasn't as light as I had hoped but it would do!). In terms of veggie: cheese ratio, there were A LOT of mozzarella wedges.  Pollo Shirley was tender and topped with a generous amount of veggies in savory white sauce. I was a fan.  We weren't that hungry but still had to eat dinner and the staff was more than happy to split our entire meal and for no extra charge!

2009-09-09,4.0,"I visited here before a movie on a random Friday night - just walked in at 7PM without a reservation and even though it was decently busy and there were a couple large parties, the hostess was very kind and seated us right away. And the service only got better from there - it's not a very big restaurant, but still, when it's at 75% capacity, it's nice when your waitress doesn't miss a beat in getting your orders taken, checking on you, ensuring your water/wine glass is constantly filled, and bringing the food to the table piping hot. I felt bad that we didn't have more time to sit back and enjoy a full 3-4 courses - we only ordered entrees and wine and still managed to make it in/out in 45 minutes, to see the movie  That being said, our tab was also pretty small, for a HUGE amount of delicious food.     I got the Fettuccine Masaniello - and that is the first time in any Italian restaurant that I ran out of noodles before I ran out of sausage/mushrooms.  It was delightful.  A tad salty, but I feel that's to be expected when you have 10 feet of sausage and all that tomato sauce in a dish.  The boy ordered Rigatoni Zughi Zughi - I'm not a fan of cream based sauces, but he ate 3/4 of it, took the rest home, and ate it later that night.  So I guess he thought it was pretty good :)   I only took 1 star away for the fact that their wine menu is not as good as I normally like to see - not very many whites that I particularly enjoy (but some people may consider it a sin to drink white with Italian sausage anyway).",0.9938,0.774,0.188,0.038,0.5854395604395605

I ordered the black ravioli stuffed with ricotta and salmon with a vodka sauce.  The dish was awesome.  The ravs were toasted in the broiler which gave them a slight crunch and the vodka sauce was excellent. All of the staff were very friendly and the restaurant itself is cozy and inviting. We had a total of 3 entrees, the bill was 43 bucks, and we were stuffed.  I actually managed to gorge myself and finish my entree.

I didn't even make it to the regular bread basket, but he told me that was awesome as well. We both couldn't decide what we wanted since so many thinks looked good to us, I ended up going with a recommendation from the waiter for a baked pasta. It was deliciously cheesy and they had no problem adding fresh mushrooms to it per my request. He had some delicious linguine with Italian sausage and mushrooms. He demolished his, but the portions were big and I got away with keeping half of mine for another meal.

FETTUCCINE GIORGIONE  In a light tomato sauce with sauteed chicken breast, broccoli and blue cheese. It's crazy, I'm not a fan of blue cheese but it gives this dish an amazing creamy taste but not overpowering. Each bite was finished with a ""wow"" being said by all.  POLLO VALDOSTANA  Lightly breaded chicken breast sauteed in a garlic white wine sauce topped with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. (Minus the prosciutto this time). My least favorite of all the dishes but still fantastic, the smoked cheese was a great compliment to the tender chicken.  What I really enjoyed about Filippo's was when you left you didn't have garlic coming out of your pores or feel blotted from heavy food.

And now, that something just so happens to be Filipo's. YUUUUU UUUUU UUUUMMMYYYY. I was on a triple date with rox & kev who have been together for 3 years. I like to think that when we go on our triple dates, kev is actually the third wheel instead of me. Either way, as soon as we started chomping on the warm focaccia bread, I knew immediately that I wanted to relive this meal even before I ate a morsel of it. The calamari was perfection and rox and i split one of the pasta dishes which was so good. I really wanted to go wild on it, and take it out in 3 bites, but I remained ladylike and took my time. It was mini penne with tomato sauce and pancetta. We finished off with creme brulee. That meal was so good it made me want to kill myself. And with an appetizer, wine, two entrees and dessert the tab was only 60 bucks. So, next time there's a wait outside of Pequod's, or you want to do something a little classier, hit up Filippo's. They look like they have a great lunch menu too. This was one of those meals that makes you almost want to cry. But you're too busy chewing.",0.929,0.841,0.115,0.044,0.4364035087719299

Step inside this quaint and cozy little Italian Ristorante, smell the aroma of Italian herbs, hear the sound of classic Frank Sinatra and you are greeted by a friendly staff who are very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable with the menu.  The food is authentic and almost second to none. Not like that heavy Olive Garden Chain restaurant noodle-crap-oodle they call ""lasagna"" and almost better than your Grandma's recipe. My personal favorite was the Rotolo Primavera stuffed with ricotta, spinach and prosciutto, with a light pink sauce.  Finish off your meal with one of their house made desserts and an Americano.  The prices are delicious too!  The restaurant is located across the street from a movie theater and major book store,so this is a great place to have dinner before or after a show, take a date or just meet friends and family for a great Italian meal..

Anypoop, the bustling server came over to our table right away with really nice Italian bread and this eggplant / olive oil side dip.  It was very good.  Since it was after, um noon, I ordered a glass of the house Merlot.  In my opinion, $7 bucks is a tad steep for house wine but I'll let it slide.  For an appetizer, my dining partner in crime and I went for ""vegetable rice balls"" (I'm not sure of the technical name. . .yes, yes something Italian).  I ordered the chicken / artichoke / tomato / mozzarella cheese salad with the balsamic dressing on the side.  Our starters (aka two huge balls of wonder) came first.  The rice and veggie balls were fried. . .and there was cheese and meat inside.  Interesting but kind of delightful.  Even though the pockets of cheese were cold, I enjoyed my ball immensely. Ready for the main event?  I was (and also ready for glass-o-vino #2).  I found my salad (sans lettuce) to be pretty good. . .nothing spectacular.  My date's penne and eggplant was tas-tay and so was his coffee - he had about 6 cups!  Crap!  Good thing it was midday!  He said the coffee was the best he ever had.

I don't know why, but there were only 5 tables or so filled, and the service was horribly slow.  Everyone was friendly and all, but SLOW.   I think I was there for 1.5 hours, 30 minutes of which were spent waiting for menus and to place our order.  The waiter told us the dessert menu and evidently forgot he did as it took him 15 minutes to come back; by that time we didn't want dessert anymore... oh well, I probably didn't need it after the rich cheese and cream sauce on my ravioli.",0.1573,0.835,0.084,0.081,0.6458823529411765

We both had the tilapia (it was on special, give me a break). It was $10.95, and I kid you not when I say I would have expected that meal to follow an order off of a $20+ dinner menu. Shit.
