I got a veggie burger on ciabatta bread and it was pretty good. Their homemade sandwich cookies are to die for, and the staff is relatively friendly. Also a clean space with brick walls. Kind of a cool little detail. But it's just decent-- the idea is there, and there's a ton of potential. It's a huge space, but they cram all their sandwiches / salads / wine / etc into one counter. I feel like someone had a great idea and went three-quarters of the way with it. An okay place to grab a sandwich but not much more than that.",0.9524,0.806,0.175,0.019,0.6822222222222223

2008-04-22,4.0,"If you're courageous enough to brave the armada of strollers and herd of tethered hipsters dragged by their purebred canine pals along the ultra-gentrified swath of North Southport, then you deserve a tasty lunch for your troubles. That's exactly what you'll find at Winston's Market...along with a seemingly confused concept/business plan. In a district that has become high-rent, it's refreshing to find such a spacious establishment, but it seems that much of the space is going to waste. I certainly don't want another claustrophobic experience like that of nearby Southport Grocery, but the square foot-to-selection ratio here is way off-kilter. Everything on the menu appeared great -- very fresh ingredients with enough creative twists to really distinguish the sandwich list...I just couldn't help but wonder if there could have been more selection, more prepared food, or whether the space is still evolving (one could lay down two bowling lanes on the vast hardwood expanse between the mostly-empty deli case and the drink coolers that held many bottles, but not as much variety as you might expect). Nevertheless, the experience was great - the employees very friendly and (most importantly) the food superb. We had the turkey apple reuben and the turkey-and-fig sandwich, which were both outstanding - and the sides were plentiful (including a stray hair); perhaps the proprietors have responded to the repeated Yelp criticism about portion size. I'll come back to the sandwich counter of Winston's as it is, but if they find a way to reconfigure and/or improve the ""market"" aspect of the business (without infringing on the solid aspects already present), this could be a real Lakeview treasure in the making.",0.9924,0.771,0.177,0.052,0.5398489503328214

I love the idea of a deli style market that is cozy and quaint, which Winston's is. However, I can't think of any dish that is very good there. :( Do not ever go for the goat cheese ravioli!!!! When I think of goat cheese, I think of a subtle sweet taste with a good balance. Their ""homemade"" goat cheese was very pungent and bitter more like a feta. And the red pepper sauce was watery like Campbell's and my ravioli was swimming in it! In fact, my friends asked me at the table if I had ordered soup. Nope just bad pasta.  Too bad, though.

We went for lunch on President's Day, and it was pretty busy.  After waiting in line for quite some time, we placed our order.  For me:  chicken and sun-dried tomato sandwich and a cup of tomato basil and goat cheese soup.  For B:  a meatball sandwich.  We were told there would be a 15 minute (at least) wait to get our food.  We had been seated for about 10 minutes when someone came out from the kitchen and informed us that they were out of meatballs, and could they bring out something else?  B decided on the burger and was told they would bring out a dessert for the inconvenience.  Another 10 or 15 minutes passed while we watched absolute pandemonium in the market...people were bringing receipts back to the register, the  guy at the cash register stepped away several times to bus tables (leaving a line of people waiting), and carry-out orders were being forgotten.  A waiter approached our table with two plates of food (mind you we had a number...11) and asked what we had ordered.  He apologized for not having our order and walked away. Then, the same guy who broke the bad news about the meatball sandwich appeared at the table again.  ""We have a problem,"" he said.  ""We took the burger off the grill and it fell on the floor.  We'll have to start over.  What do you want to do?""  I laughed.  I couldn't help it...I felt so bad for this guy who was repeatedly the bearer of bad news, and couldn't believe the luck that we had!  What I wanted to do was go home...I was defeated...I didn't want to sit any wait and listen to children scream and the staff apologize.  So, they refunded our money and we left.  They were so nice and so apologetic, I felt really badly, but they need to get their act together.  I don't think we'll be back.",-0.755,0.902,0.039,0.058,0.4495098039215687

I get a little crazy when I am hungry. Hmmm so many choices... but I ended up getting the grilled chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll, a bag of chips and the Greek pasta salad and got it to go. I got home, there was steam rising from my sandwich, good sign. It looked quite tasty, but I have learned many things look tasty when on a pretzel roll. So I took a bite, pretty good. A little too much mayo for my taste, but pretty good none the less. I wish it had a little more umph in the flavor department, but the smokey Gruyere helped. Then I tried the pasta salad, interesting. Much more refreshing than I would have thought. Cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, olive oil and dill. Really good. I liked the place, a lot of choices to choose from, plus they have a bunch of frozen soups, from squash to oxtail to lentil as well as a few hot ones that change daily. There were also quite alot of wine and beer selections. I guess I came here on a kid free day because I didn't have any issue with them as much as some of the other reviewers.
