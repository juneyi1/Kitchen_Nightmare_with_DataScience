2015-05-04,4.0,"Amazing food. Well presented, good atmosphere and in all a good place for dinner.  We were there on a night with ""valet"" parking and I'd recommend it as the area (construction and just where it is in the city) sucks for parking and that's no way to start a dinner with a suckie parking experience. I liked the food and the presentation.  The venue was meh, but that's not why we were there.  The bar is tiny (read TINY) but amazing mixology of the bartender will have us coming back for more and carving our names in the seats as regulars. The Brussel Sprouts were amazing as were most of the entrees, but for the price that's to be expected.  We were slightly rushed as we were going to hear a friend sing at ""The Store"" but the staff accommodated us and we were in and out with a high end meal under our belt.

The orange mule was phenomenal! It's very refreshing.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the manhattan!  2. As for the appetizer we had the mussels! I highly recommend! Has a little spice kick to it!   3. As for the entree I had the rotisserie duck and swordfish. The duck was hearty & full of flavor. 4. As for the swordfish I was pretty disappointed. The fish was huge! Looked like a flintstone bone!

2015-04-23,2.0,"I had high hopes considering all the positive reviews, but I left disappointed to be honest. Maybe as I get older I get more sensitive to how loud a place is, but I literally had to shout to be heard by my dinner companions. Not exactly a relaxing dinner chat environment. The service, while polite and friendly, was slow. There was a noticeable lag between our appetizers and dinner. Our server apologized (I'm sure the kitchen was backed up and it wasn't his fault) but the damage was sort of already done.  My asparagus burrata salad was tasty, but the burrata, instead of being a little parcel of heaven that oozes when you cut into it, was sort of a big gooey mess atop the asparagus. I ordered the rotisserie chicken because I figured that's their specialty so it should be really great, right? By the time it finally got to me it was just sort of dry. Pretty major disappointment there.  I think my companions enjoyed their meals, but I think I'd rather try somewhere new than go back to Rustic House.",0.9615,0.704,0.193,0.102,0.5418905895691609

It has a very ""homey"" feel to it, and on a chilly Chicago night, it's exactly what you need!   Their portions are pretty big, so expect to come home with leftovers. I got the Lobster Bisque (good), the Faroe Islands Salmon (good), and the Caramel Popcorn Brownie (huge).  My roommate got the Wood-grilled Octopus (super good), the Flat Iron Poivre (she asked for the meat to be cooked medium, but it was still VERY much alive when she got it. still really good, though, especially for me when I had it as my leftovers for lunch the next day. Hello, microwave. I win.), and the Baileys Crème Brulee (it came with a wafer which I really liked lol).

2015-01-14,1.0,"We went January 3rd, we had a 8pm reservation.  We had to make a 10pm show about 10 minutes away.  We were sat right at reservation time and were greeted by friendly faces.  There's coat check and valet.  Which was awesome because it was a cold night.  We get seated and were given entrée menu's.  We waited about 3-5 minutes on our actual server to greet us where she asked for our drinks. We asked about specialty drinks and she noticed we hadn't received a drink menu,  she then hands us one and says she'll give us a minute,  which all this mind you happened in a bout a minute,  we chose a drinks and waited another 3-5 minutes on her return. In her defense it was busy every seat was full.  But minutes were feeling like life time, there seemed to be people to help.  We decide to order everything at the same time, It's now about 8:10 which also was about the time we received the bread oil and water.   We went with the hot crab dip, Which honestly as I type this I wish I was enjoying it right now,  really delicious and a lot of flavor.  We both went for the new York strip which is off bone here.  My date orders hers medium/rare I order mine well done.  And garlic mashed potatoes Before we ordered we had explain that we had a show to make and we were fine with everything coming at the same time, if possible.  The steaks we received were under cooked.  I've eaten plenty of steaks to know what a well done steak looks to a medium rare steak,  it indeed was  rare. The only thing was when the food was dropped it was a minutes before any one asked if everything was OK.  When she takes the steak back I encourage my date to continue eating she said her steak was gummy, and fatty.  I took a bite of the mashed potatoes and they were bitter and garlic OVERLOAD grainy even.  My steak returned and it was medium.   At that point we had to leave.  I never got to eat dinner.  A manager did take care of my steak from the ticket,  but I also never touched it. I just don't know yet if this was a bad night or what.  If I crave that crab dip I might be back.   I also think it'd be a fun idea to have a system where the valet ticket is run out while you close you tab.   Until then.",0.9584,0.887,0.09,0.023,0.540808596165739

The server we had was very quiet and would occasionally disappear. Not around much when we needed her. The appetizers were good, pretty simple but the bacon platter rocked. Muscles were another that we enjoyed. My biggest issue was the main course, two of us were very excited about the seared tuna special. When I received the dish, the sauce was lukewarm and the fish was ice cold. We sent it back to heat up slightly but had very well done tuna returned to us. When we pressed the issue, a second waitress said the outside is meant to be hot and the inside of the fish slightly warm. She took a tone to make us seem wrong, but then I spoke up to reiterate that the fish seemed like it came straight out of the fridge. Desserts were good, nothing you can't find at your neighborhood grocery store. If you do come, the sweet corn brûlée was fantastic, it tastes like a dessert served as a side. Really enjoyed that one. With how many amazing restaurants there are in the neighborhood, I would pass on this one and move to another.",0.995,0.747,0.229,0.024,0.5557823129251701
2014-09-13,3.0,"I remember coming here over a year ago, and thinking that the food was just okay.  Not bad, not great, but not on my sh*t list. I came here again last night and was disappointed. The food is at best average, and does not warrant the pricing. For the same price, there are plenty of restaurants in the chicago area that can provide better flavors, better textures. There was no wow factor with the food. Same with the cocktails.  We ordered the mussels yesterday. While the flavors were good, I was so disappointed with the mussels themselves.  They were shriveled up pathetic little nuggets of tough chewy mofos. Mussels are supposed to be succulent and plump. And these were not.  It was embarrassing because we were the ones that suggestted this place to our friends that joined us last night. Then the poultry - the flavors were bland. I tried the duck and the chicken.  When people go to restaurants they want to experience flavors that you can't get at home, or at least experience an intensity of flavor.  Both of these were ok. Below, please find my comments and suggestions on the chicken and duck.  In case its not obvious, I am very much a duck person.  The Chicken: $22 for half a chicken, or $34 for the entire chicken to go -- let me help you -- Mariano's rotisserie chicken is so much more tender, juicy, and delicious. Costco's rotisserie chicken, though not as juicy and flavorful as Mariano's chicken (probably because they are bigger in an unnatural hormone-injected way) still had better flavor, and we all know for Costco chicken, it has that ""injected with marinade/brine"" taste to it -- but i'd still take that over Rustic House chicken.   The Duck: Then the duck -- who rotisseries a duck!??  Again, let that sink in .... WHO ROTISSERIES A DUCK? What a waste of duck! All the benefits of the duck is wasted when you rotisserie a duck. The contrast between the crispy skin, and the flavors that melt into medium/meidum rare duck breast are all gone. Try searing it or oven roasting it and shove some aromatics into the cavity for heaven's sake to give it more flavor, or smoking it. So the duck was bland except for the sloppy orange glaze on the outside of the duck skin.  It's too bad the duck skin wasn't better utilized, and that the duck was just your standard ""a l'orange.""  The Chicken and The Duck: Finally, who really wants to struggle with carving up an entire half chicken or duck? Lucky for me, I carve up helpless animals all the time so I know where to strike, but i'm usually using a kitchen knife. When you have the smaller meat cutting knife, it's hard. Rustic House should consider cutting up the poultry for its customers.  Sure, its not as pretty when you cut into the skin and expose meat, but hey, figure it out. You'd at least get better plating possibilities that way. Conclusion: Athough it may not sound like it, I hope Rustic House does well and doesn't continuously slip into the Groupon/OpenTable 1000points table hell its in.  But I can see why it's headed that way.  It simply doesn't have the ability to keep up.  I also noticed Karianne W's 8/24/2014 3 star review-- agree with it whole heartedly.  Thanks for reading.",0.9644,0.767,0.128,0.105,0.5910294455946628

I asked our server which of the rotisserie entrees she would recommend, and consequently chose the pork chop.

We got the corn brûlée (amazing!!) and brussel sprouts to share.  -Dessert: We ordered the creme brûlée trio and rhubarb crumble. Both were good.   Service was not: -Our server did not introduce herself to us -She had zero personality -She did not ask us if we'd been there before, make any recommendations, or tell us about any specials.  -She touched our table 5 times: to take drink, apps, main order (after I had to ask her to do so), and dessert orders, and to drop off the check -She didn't ask how out food was or check that everything came out as it should.

The skin is so crispy that the first time I ate it, I freaked out and through that they breaded it. It was that crispy. The inside flesh is so soft and buttery, it melts on your tongue.  Ok, the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable. I feel like this is such a neighborhood spot that is unpretentious. In Lincoln Park, on this street, it is hard to find.

And most importantly, the food fits right along with the vibe of the restaurant - if I had to use two words to describe the cuisine at Rustic House, it would be ""comfort"" and, well, ""Rustic"".  Ha.   The bread service is worth mentioning and stellar, the focaccia soft and buttery with a nice herbal crust.  To start, we got the Ahi Tuna Tartare, mixed together with a salsa of avocado, shallots, cucumber, and ginger.  The tuna and avocado dominated this dish, and paired together nicely, with the ginger adding just a bit of bite.  The crostini was sprinkled with sesame and were perfectly crisped. Sara went with one of the specials - an order of seared diver scallops served atop a bed of rich saffron risotto.  This was intense, flavorful, and the scallops were tender and meaty.  A sprinkle of truffle on top of the scallop only added to the richness of this dish. The rotisserie drew me in, and I went with the rotisserie chicken, served aside a scoop of mashed potatoes that were pretty standard, but the chicken steals the show (and most of what comes off the rotisserie, in my experience.  The chicken was juicy, tender, and the skin was extremely savory, the just adding a nice touch and melding the chicken and creamy mashed potatoes together into a blob of rustic goodness.  The rotisserie chicken here is not quite on par with Lee Wolen's chicken thighs, or the jidori chicken I had at Moto in February, but it was a solid choice and one of the better chicken dishes I've had in the city, and at $22, it's very reasonably priced.   Summary: Rustic House is solid comfort food well done in a perfect atmosphere.  Best in the fall or winter, as the warmth of the decor sets the stage for that kind of climate, but I'm sure they've got some great seasonal dishes as the produce gets fresher in the spring/summer.  Looking forward to going back.   Pics up at :  eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.9949,0.827,0.156,0.017,0.6551672891378774

Food was good all around, although nothing that was over the top spectacular.  I had the scallops on a saffron risotto and my husband had the rack of lamb.  Service was overall friendly with good cadence. We were seated in the front of the restaurant in a middle table and felt a little bit on display for everyone coming in for their reservation - if I were to do it again, I would ask for a table in the back which would offer more privacy. The reason it's three stars and not more is less because there was something specific that was missing, and more because I don't feel that I would need to go back again (although good to try out once).",0.9685,0.836,0.148,0.016,0.4170289855072464

Their Chef's Week menu and regular menu are both pleasing, but thankfully the waiter said we could combine the two!  He ordered the lobster bisque (smooth, rich and good lobster flavor), scallops and risotto (he's not a big fan of truffles, but the black truffle taste was quite slight and the risotto was rich and creamy). I ordered the chicken liver mousse (I wish the bread was a bit more toasted so it could hold up to the weight of the mousse but it was creamy and sweet) and the rack of lamb (mushrooms and green beans had a nice smoky/char flavor while the lamb was a good medium rare. The Dijon mustard paired well with the strong meat.)  My glass of Sancerre was disappointing, but that was probably the only thing I disliked! The hostess seated us next to the window, so it wasn't too dark for us. Our server was very friendly. The bread basket was wonderfully soft, although I wondered if we were supposed to get balsamic vinegar along with the olive oil.  Boy and I had a wonderful time. Intimate, delicious food. My overall experience was very comparable to Balena which I liked very much as well. I think Rustic House is a little bit more ""homey"" and intimate compared to Balena which has high ceilings so the environment can be a bit louder.

Our server had great timing, did not rush us and was able to answer all our questions about the menu. There was a bit of an echo in the seating area where we were, so I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet, cozy night as we had to talk loudly over the other guests. The food, though, I am on the fence about. I was not impressed with the lobster bisque- it was heavy on the fish/clam juice flavor and not much else. the three-hour cured salmon was delicious- very nicely seasoned, pan-roasted, and cooked to order. The spinach, fennel and lemon sauce all complimented one another perfectly. My friend ordered the rotisserie duck- a generous portion, lean and not at all game-y, but a little sweet. We had the blondie brownie and apple crumble for dessert- both what you would expect and not overly sweet.

2013-11-06,5.0,"For the TL;DR crowd, Rustic House served up one of the best meals I've had in the past three years living in Chicago. I went with two friends a few Saturdays ago. We had a reservation for 9pm and were not seated until past 9:20. I understand it's impossible to perfectly predict diner behavior, but I don't expect to wait 20 minutes with a reservation. Luckily, things improved from there. I ordered the flat iron steak, which was cooked to perfection (medium rare), tender, flavorful, and clearly a quality piece of beef. It was served with a side of potato gratin (about 2/3 the size of the a la carte option) that was also very tasty. One of my friends had the lamb rack, which was also delicious - perhaps the least ""game-y"" lamb I have ever tasted - and my other friend had the chicken pot pie, which was also delicious. Probably my favorite part of the meal was the side of brussel sprouts with pancetta. The sprouts were black when served, and I was worried they had been charred to death, but in fact were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. The side portions are rather healthy and can most certainly be shared. We finished with the apple cobbler, server with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, that was also very good. Our server was fantastic and the interior of the restaurant does not betray its name. My only other complaint would be the cocktails. This is clearly not a cocktail bar, but they are unimaginative and not all that tasty. Still, I heartily recommend Rustic House and plan to go back soon.",0.998,0.69,0.277,0.033,0.59365873015873

There is no minimum charge, unlike many other restaurants that host private parties, and they work with you to set up a prixe fixe menu that fits with your taste and any dietary restrictions (we had a few gluten free people). Of course the food is what really matters! I tried the wood grilled octopus, three hour cured salmon, organic chicken, maple leaf duck l'orange, creme brulee trio and the gelato. GET THE WOOD GRILLED OCTOPUS! You will not be disappointed. It is only an appetizer, but I enjoyed the octopus more than any of the entrees. The salmon was probably my favorite entree.

The NEGATIVE: We had date night on a saturday at 730pm.  We were a few minutes early and were seated right away... the problem was the food came out waay too fast.  We had gone through our first course and entree in 45 minutes when what we wanted was to relax and enjoy the meal.  Less than 4 minutes after ordering, her soup and my salad were out.  No time to sip on the cocktails we just got or try the bread.  Less than 2 minutes after our plates being cleared the entrees were out... no time to settle.  The waiter never rushed us, it was just annoying b/c the timing was way off.  And.. the waiter asked us to order everything at once so the chef could time the meal! The positives: Our waiter was really friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I had the grilled mahi mahi and she had the pork chop.  Both were great.  I loved the sauce mine came in and the fish was cooked perfectly.  Both servings were ample and totally worth the money.  The salad I had was delicious and the egg perfectly poached (surprising with how fast it came out).  I could eat that fish dish every night. I'd come here again but with a group of people b/c my experience for a date night was highly soured.  I'm usually one who can't wait to eat... but this kind of ruined a nice night.",0.8992,0.833,0.109,0.058,0.5209325396825396

I knew we were in trouble when the bread came out (some sort of garlic focaccia) and it was cold and stale. We started with the chicken liver mousse and snack trio. The mousse was so cold it was almost frozen. It also had an inch layer of what tasted like puréed dates and sugar. I believe it was ""sweet prunes and Armagnac"". Maybe others would like this, but at least put it on the side. The snack trio wasn't much better. The olives and bacon were cold...the almonds were hot. Spiced olives are sooo much better warm. Also, the only reason the almonds were hot was the 1/2 cup of hot oil they were sitting in...gross. My gf then ordered the butternut squash soup. Ever had those soups from the store that come in cardboard containers? That would have been an upgrade in flavor. Finally we split the rotisserie chicken as an entree. The chicken jus was good. The compliments end there. Chicken lacked seasoning and skin was soggy. The mashed potatoes were INSTANT. Now, I didn't get a peak in the kitchen, so I can't confirm this, but that's what they tasted like. Hard to mimic that ""instant"" consistency.

2013-07-29,5.0,"What a perfect choice for a nice mother-daughter dinner! I had fallen in love with Gemini Bistro during my v-day dinner, and thought of that when my mom decided to come into town for a mother-daughter weekend. Thank goodness for yelp and its handy-dandy ""people also searched for this..."" section, because Rustic House popped up and it never would have occurred to me that they were restaurants from the same chef and business partner. Anyway, I have just as much love (actually, more) for Rustic House. They honored my request for a table that might be quieter, and seated us in the back room, which has about 5 or 6 tables total, a serene fireplace, and is the epitome of ""rustic"" (because how else would you describe burlap on the walls?). It was perfectly quiet for the two of us, and even when it started to fill up later, was only average volume. Our server (Albieta?) was the definition of a great server - there when you needed her, gone when you didn't. The meal progressed nicely and I didn't feel like we had to wait too long to order, nor did we feel rushed. I started out with the Pomelito, which tasted like a perfect beach drink (tequila, grapefruit juice, lime, soda) but was a little too cold for the unseasonably cold July weather we were having. I did enjoy the Cote du Rhone red wine afterwards.  The food was so homey and comfortable yet refined and delicious that I can't even pick a favorite. I loved that they had a laundry list of specials, both appetizers and main dishes - I feel like that says really good things about the freshness and quality of their menu. We loved the lobster and pea risotto; so much lobster it was well worth the $15. We loved our main courses, the suckling pig rotisserie for my mom and the roasted rack of lamb for me. Perfectly cooked medium rare for the lamb, and I can't wait to try the leftover suckling pig. Desserts were amazing too, with a peach tart calling my name and the sorbet/gelato for my mom. They have fresh flavors for the ice creams, and you choose three - what a great deal! It wasn't a cheap meal, but that's because we went all-out with the drinks and all three courses. For the quantity and quality of what we did get, it was well worth the price. I highly recommend Rustic House be placed at the top of your list for a special occasion or family meal!",0.9982,0.766,0.212,0.023,0.6115816326530612

However, when the valets returned our car w/ the driver's side mirror  was broken and hanging off and the turn signal didn't work. The driver merely handed me a card w/ a phone # to call. When I called, there was no answer. I called the restaurant who assured me they would take care of the damage. We agreed on a place for me to bring the car for repairs. However, in the following days the restaurant decided the valet company was responsible & denied all responsibility. Now the valet company has refused to pay and given the claim to the insurance company of the driver. For a nondescript meal on a Friday night, I am now out 1000s of dollars.

2013-04-08,4.0,"For some reason I went into Rustic House with a skeptical attitude--maybe it had something to do with the stereotypical ""meh"" food that I've experienced in the Lincoln Park and Lakeview neighborhoods lately? That aside, I had a wonderful experience all across the board at Rustic House on a Sunday evening in celebration of my boyfriend's birthday. Upon arriving we were greeted by the hostess and we were able to pick our own table. We went with one of the small tables tucked away in the window which was great as it provided some privacy. We quickly looked over the cocktail and beer menu and put in an order for a Sazerac and a Vesper. The Sazerac was served on chipped ice (like what you'd expect to see with a Coke) which I didn't quite favor as it watered down the drink rather quickly. The Vesper, on the other hand, was fantastic and was served in a martini glass. I'd recommend either sticking to their beer or wine list, or making sure that a drink isn't on the rocks if you actually enjoy the flavor of alcohol. After our drinks arrived, we placed our order for the rest of the evening which was the following: 1) Wood Grilled Octopus: My oh my, I don't even know where to start with this one. I was SO happy that we ordered this as the execution and flavor were spot on. You receive about six pieces of fairly large octopus that is smoked and grilled to perfection. The smoky grill flavor really permeates the meat and it is oddly reminiscent of pork or chicken in flavor, but you know that you're eating seafood due to the texture. Speaking of the texture, the octopus isn't chewy or rubbery at all. It is a flawless dish that any patron should not miss out on. 2) Short Rib Pot Roast: Yum. The meat was very flavorful and tender, and literally fell apart once it was cut into. It was served with a side of turnips that I didn't quite care for as they were undercooked, but the pearl onions really soaked up the flavors of the reduction and were a great addition to the dish.  3) Duck L'Orange: This is a classic dish that they executed perfectly with a beautiful presentation. The duck was overall very moist and flavorful, but there were some dry spots in the meat. The skin was perfectly crisped and draped in orange glaze that wasn't overpowering but greatly kicked up the flavor of the duck. The glazed carrots on the side were a perfect addition to the dish. 4) Brussel Sprouts & Pancetta: We probably didn't need another side, but considering how I wasn't a fan of the turnips with the short rib I was glad that we ordered these. They were perfectly pan fried and served with a fair portion of pancetta, all around delicious. If you're venturing into the side dishes, I'd recommend getting this one. Since it was my boyfriend's birthday, we indulged in dessert. We decided to split the Blondie Brownie with two scotches. The brownie came out with a candle, which was a nice touch. The brownie was absolutely amazing. It had a nice chewy texture that all good brownies should have, meaning it reached the perfect ""underdoneness"" consistency. The vanilla gelato provided a nice hot/cold contrast of the dessert and the slight drizzle of the raspberry sauce really brought all the flavors together.  The service was prompt and polite, no complaints on this end whatsoever. Rustic House provided a great venue for a birthday dinner from the cozy atmosphere to the hearty fare.",0.9983,0.81,0.162,0.028,0.6579746642246644
2013-03-29,4.0,"The couple I babysit for has gone here a few times, and love it a bunch, so when I saw them on the list for Chef Week, I made a reservation right away. My coworker and I opted for a Thursday night 7pm reservation. From the moment we walked in we were sold. They gave us a choice to sit in the front or back (near the fireplace) and we chose to sit right by the fire. Very cozy.  Our waiter was very helpful and answered all our questions, offering suggestions to meet our needs.  We started with the wood-grilled octopus, which was absolutely delicious. The smoky flavor of the wood meets the texture of the octopus perfectly.  I also ordered the lobster bisque, which was served at just the right temperature and balanced amount of lobster and creme fraiche. With just a dash of fresh pepper on top, I was in bisque heaven.  We were torn about the Chef Week menu, and he suggested we share the flat iron au poivre and scallops for the entree; problem being my coworker likes her meat well done (tsk tsk), and I am very pro-rare  to medium rare at the most (depending on the quality  of the cut). Our waiter asked the chef if he'd be able to cut the meat to make both of us happy, which was very awesome. He even plated it separately and cut the potato gratin to make sharing even easier for us. The peppercorn on the flat iron was borderline too much, but I definitely enjoyed the flavor.  I could see where someone else may have a different opinion. The scallops were scallops, plain and simple, but the perfect accompaniment to the steak. I'm glad we decided to share because on their own, the scallops would not have been enough and the flat iron au poivre would have been too much, especially with the gratin.  For the dessert course we shared the apple tart. Nothing to ride home about but notably not too sweet and beautifully plated. Overall, great dining experience and they offer a three-course $35 prix fixe menu nightly from 5-6:30 on select entrees.

2013-01-13,4.0,"My boyfriend and I had our most recent date night at Rustic House. We made reservations the week before for 7pm on a Saturday. Making the reservation was no problem. When we arrived, we were greeted right away by the hostess. We were a little early, so our table was not quite ready. No problem; we just had a drink at the bar. What you will notice immediately is the quaintness of the restaurant. It is tiny, but charming. The bar is small, but for a saturday night we still managed to snag two seats at the bar. The bartender was nice and accommodating- also had a strong resemblance to Daniel from Lost.  We were taken to our table at about 7. We were a little disappointed to be taken to the back room, but all in all it was still cozy and had a nice fireplace. Our waiter took a bit of time to greet our table, but it did allow us plenty of time to debate our orders. I ended up going for the organic chicken while my boyfriend had the Flat iron. We also ordered the corn brûlée. When our food came out I was surprised to find the large portions! You do not have to order an extra side as the side that is served with the main course is plenty enough! However, the corn brûlée as many have mentioned is delicious. It tastes much more like a dessert than a side! My chicken was also very good. Full of flavor and moist! The garlic mashed potatoes served along side were to die for. Those were gone before anything else! My boyfriend also enjoyed his steak (I had a bite- very tasty!!) and his au gratin potato. All in all the food was quite scrumptious and comforting- like a night spent with the family, without the stress! So all in all my rating is as follows- food 4.5, service 3.5, overall ambiance 4. Prices are reasonable for the restaurant. Only other side note- the door to the restaurant is odd. They have a storm door that leads to a small landing where the front door is- not the best setup, as it requires you to do a little dance with the patrons leaving the restaurant!

Underwhelming food: the pork (recommended at medium--I generally like med rare but took the recommendation, but IMHO it was past medium and verging on hockey puck).  Completely disappointing food: veal cheek pasta--honestly, one of the saltiest dishes I have had in a long time, so much that I really couldn't eat it.  You would think that the wait staff would wonder why an entire plate (minus 3 bites) was sitting untouched, but that gets us into the service realm.  Other than 15 secs after we got our mains, and were asked how things were (and of course we really had not started),  we never really saw our waiter.  And the serving/bus staff brought the service score lower-- not that I am a huge presentation person, but their ""serving"" was to basically drop everything on the table and let us figure out where it belonged. Okay. And then it was constantly--""Are you done with that?""  I am convinced that the bus staff are on commission to turn around as many tables as quickly as possible--even if it annoys the guest. We were not slow, nor were we sitting around chit-chatting post-meal, and we had a fairly large bill since we ordered a more expensive wine.  And yet, everyone in the party felt that they were rushing us.

I also thought the ambiance was great really showing the rotisserie which drives the menu. Cute place, good food, attentive thoughtful service?

You could tell by his knowledge and interest in his customers that he was ""invested"" in the restaurant. I wish I remembered his name. The restaurant is built around the rotisserie where they have duck, chicken, and pork nightly. The pork was perfect thought the side cabbage wasn't as good as it read on the menu. The duck was some of the best I've had in Chicago but was dry in areas. Everybody else seemed very satisfied with their meals.

The portions were large and the quality of the product was high, and obviously, carefully selected. This visit was the same.  Service excellent on a Sunday evening. We felt the meal was worth more than the tab. Seasonal soup du jour (squash with apple and blue cheese). Octopus app, bacon app and Caesar salad. Double pork chop from the rotisserie had a delicious sauce and paired well with a dark beer.  Side veggies are ample.  We chose roasted brussels sprouts, which were great.  Very often the veg sides are lacking on most menus. A vegetarian would be OK here. Could not finish our food and took the remainder home. Wine list good.  I heard that you can BYOB for $20, and I find that to be quite fair.

Sure thing, it proved to be as awesome as we've heard and even better!  The service, to start with, was amazing!  Our drinks were really good, I got the grapefruit drink with vodka (not tequila since i'm allergic to agave).  We got the grilled octopus as appetizer - TO DIE FOR.  It is NOT chewy AT ALL.  Very tender and flavorful.  I mean I don't think I've ever had octopus that was this tender and tasted just amazing.  I would definitely recommend getting this appetizer if you're a fan of seafood/bottom feeders :)  For main course we got the rotisserie chicken - antibiotic free chicken which I think also implies free range, but i'm not sure.  We tried asking but the waitress didn't know.  :-/  it was indeed delish, in fact they specialize in rotiesseries - they also have other dishes that they slow braise or ... rotisserize (is that a word???) haha.  It was a whole half of a chicken with mashed potatoes.  Very yummy.  We also got brussel sprouts on the side - if you love brussel sprouts and Lord knows I do (rather obsessed with them) they are DELICIOUS.  They were made just right, garlic, olive oil, some other spices - delish!    Oh and I also overheard the table next to us raving about the corn brulee.  We didn't get it but it sure sounded good.   Definitely recommend this place.  I think it's also BYOB, which is totally awesome, but we didn't know.  They have valet but also some street parking.  I'd definitely go back.",0.9987,0.686,0.281,0.033,0.629545035068291

My boyfriend and I decided to do the three-course prix fixe menu, which was $35 per person.  We started with the snack trio, which included three strips of the honey-peppered bacon, marcona almonds (aka duck fat almonds) and marinated olives.  I loved the bacon and almonds, which both were amazing.  I didn't really care for the olives.  Also, you used to be able to order these items separately, but now they are in a trio, which costs $10. We then both had the corn chowder, which was the soup of the day.  The soup was amazing - the corn was crisp and the soup was creamy.  It was perfect for a somewhat cool evening. For our entrees, my boyfriend had the veal cheek ragout while I had the three-hour cured salmon.  I guess I didn't see that endives were included in the meal.  I hated them and did not eat them.  The gremolta was great and was a nice sauce for the dish. The veal cheek ragout, hands down, was the best dish I sampled all night.  The veal was cooked perfectly and was soft and melted in your mouth.  The sauce that accompanied the dish was amazing and I enjoyed the pappardelle very much as well.  I would come back and eat that again in a heartbeat. For dessert, we had the an apple and blueberry tart with gelato.  That was a good way to end the meal since it wasn't too dense or too sweet. The only downside was that we were seated at the tables for two along the wall and the servers and staff used that area to walk to and from the kitchen so I felt like we were a bit pressed up against the wall since I didn't want to put my foot or arm out too far and hit a server or staff member.  Also, the place is a bit small so it can get crowded and therefore, can get loud.

We ordered a Sazerac, Old Fashion, and Manhattan.  The drinks were awesome.  We did have to send back the Old Fashion, but that was for personal taste reasons.  The tender is a pro.  Expensive, 11$ each, but well worth it; as the largish glass and generous pour made us very happy. Moving on to dinner, two shared the generous pork chop special and I had the pot pie.  Each was outstanding.  (Next time I'm going to have the roasted chicken, their specialty).  We also shared two sides, outstanding, but I can't remember what we had (Sazerac Effect). We had the special desert, peach cobbler; outstanding.  They comped for our anniversary.  Nice touch.

He started with the Farmer's Salad that had a pretty presentation that he liked. I went with the Lobster Bisque which was delicious -- light and not too creamy, great chunks of lobster. He thought it was ""too oily and needed more cream"" -- I liked it just how it was. Second Course: He ordered the daily rotisserie which was their Kurobuto Porkchop (as the waiter described it ""What wagyu is to beef, Kurobuto is to pork."") with the Brussel Sprouts side (b.sprouts/thyme/pancetta) and I opted for the Free-Range Organic Chicken with the Broccoli side (broccoli/chili flakes/fennel seed). Both entrees were very generous-sized portions (12 oz pork, half a chicken) and cooked perfectly--the pork mouthwatering and the chicken tender. The sauces for each -- particularly the chicken -- I wanted to sop up with bread. The B.Sprouts were good, but the Broccoli was delicious and however it was prepared just made the flavors roll along your tongue.  Third Course: Creme Brulee Trio (choc./coconut/almond) and the Blondie Brownie (w/vanilla gelato and raspberry coulis). Blondie Brownie was good but nothing spectacular. Creme Brulee Trio won this round with the three, different and distinct flavors that paired well. Service: Excellent. We were late due to work and the restaurant told us not to rush they would hold our table. The waiter was friendly and helpful and not overbearing, providing guidance on the menu which was right on.

2012-01-22,5.0,"I could hardly wait to try Rustic House when I first read about it, and I didn't.  Wait, that is.  I convinced a girlfriend of mine to try it out with me on the second day it was open.  Risky, I know.  But hey, I wanted to check it out and since I'm a restaurant person, I understand that there are kinks to be worked out.  Nothing is exactly as you expect it to be upon opening a new place.  This is why I have a policy of always giving a new restaurant a second chance after a few months, regardless of the first dining experience. But Rustic House is in no need of a second ""chance"".  The first round was so good that I'd return without hesitation for another meal even tomorrow. Ok, so it's not like it was totally perfect, but it was pretty amazing for the second night.  And I'm sure that the minor issues they had, all technical stuff, not in concept, have long been worked out. Here's what we had: Wood-grilled octopus with tomato confit, picholine olives and charred greens.  It was wonderfully balanced:  a little bitter from the greens, sweet from the toms and salty & earthy from the olives.  The octopus itself was tender and well-charred, lending a little smoke and crunch.  Yum!  I could have this for dinner over and over. Next was handmade papardelle pasta with veal cheek ragout, tomatoes and shaved pecorino cheese.  The veal was deep & rich and coated the nicely al dente pasta with its sticky goodness while the toms gave a hint of sweetness and the pecorino brightened things up with its pungent saltiness.  *Slurp*  Yes, please!  This is what you hope you have at least one piece of crusty bread left in the basket for.  I don't think I could let even the smallest drop of that veal love go to waste.  In fact, I hope someone in the back gets to wipe those pans clean with some bread, too!  Lucky dog...   Then the monkfish.  The only time I like monkfish is when someone else has cleaned and prepared it.  It just might be the most disgusting looking thing on the earth yet you'd never know it from this plate.  The chef has made it beautiful and, dare I say, delicious looking!   It's wrapped in pancetta and sits atop an orange-fennel bouillabaisse (fennel still in tact for crunch) and is complimented with a tiny crostino dolloped with a black olive tapanade.  The saffron really makes the color pop, doesn't it?   We had to get our veggies, too, so we ordered a side of broccoli from the nice selection of sides.  I, for one, really appreciate it when a chef gives the some options for something green, which he has done here.  Others included sauteed spinach, Brussels sprouts and a corn brulee (which I'm not sure counts as a vegetable but I'm sure would be delicious!).  The broccoli was prepared with garlic and RPF.  You know... it was broccoli.   And now for pie!  A flaky pastry crust with brandies cherries, amaretto anglaise, candied almonds and vanilla ice cream.  This is where we saw the first technical error.  Clearly the oven temp needed to be adjusted because the top of the crust was the most perfect golden brown but inside the folds, we were left with dough.  The dessert was promptly swapped out with apologies for a second attempt, which was better but still not quite there.  We didn't have the heart to tell 'em.  We weren't in the least put off by it since everything else was so wonderful and we knew that, undoubtedly, they'd work it out on their own.   The only other blip we saw the entire time was the fact that there was no offering from the 'Daily Rotisserie'.  Apparently, the chef didn't like how it had turned out and, therefore, 86d it from the menu.  Admirable. I guess the thing I really like about Rustic House is that nothing was out-of-the-box crazy as far as flavor combinations, but not boring either, and execution is taken very seriously.  Over and over we saw classic flavor combinations reworked into (mostly) perfectly executed dishes.  Cooking techniques, seasoning, textures and presentation are all right on.  Beautiful and delicious. Service couldn't have been anything less than flawless since every member of the spankin'-new staff was present.  Actually, I take that back.  It could have been a junk show, as many restaurant openings are, regardless of the number of people on the floor, but it wasn't.  It was great. The ambiance, too, was delightful; as warm and inviting as the staff and the food.   The Short Version (Out of 10)... Food:  9 Service:  9 Ambiance:  9 Overall impression:  9 Would I go back? Yup.  Can't wait!",0.9993,0.754,0.2,0.046,0.5110746522980566

The milkshake-like qualities that the drink is supposed to have clearly were not apparent with this combination. The drink was not edible, and we did not receive a credit on the final bill.

Specialty of the house here is the rotisserie grill.  They offer rotisserie chicken every night, with a rotating (see what I did there?) daily special.  I've tried most of the menu and would highly recommend the grilled octopus, gnocchi, rotisserie veal rack, chicken pot pie and the lamb shoulder.   And for what it's worth - I've sat next to Charlie Trotter in this restaurant.",0.9825,0.812,0.179,0.009,0.4714965986394557

2011-10-22,1.0,"Food was very good.  My rating is based on a surprise  ""Event Fee"". A group of 14 was celebrating a friend's birthday in the back room at Rustic House.  Reservation was for 8, we were seated 40-45 minutes late. Event Fee After being seated, food and drinks went pretty smoothly.  A great evening took a dramatic turn for the worse when we got the check.  The bill had an additional charge called an ""EVENT FEE"". The additional fee of $1000 was approximately 50% of the food and beverages cost.  Food and Beverage + 50% .  This did not include Gratuity. Management did not discuss the purpose of the fee with the group.  After two people tried to discuss this with the staff, no adjustment was made. Our guest of honor was mortified and what was a great birthday celebration with friends, ended in tears. I have searched the website and menu, there is nothing that indicates any additional fees for any reason. We are all locals.  Many of us live in the neighborhood.  Charging  patrons and neighbors unadvertised and unrealistic fees without an explanation is a poor way to do business. edited 12/22/2011 (I apologize if I get a little repetitive) After waiting two months for a reply, the owners of Rustic House sent me an email. I was considering my response.  Brianne (manager) didn't wait a week for my reply when she ""was forced"" to respond with her comment below.  (btw, that is not her original response).  Thanks for the consideration and patience.  When you thought I wasn't looking, you jumped at the opportunity to post your response.        We had a Prix Fixe menu with three options. The most expensive meal on the menu was $48 and we had 14 people...that is a $700 in food. What manager in their right mind would expect a group of 14 to run up an 1800 dollar bar bill. What group of customers would agree if they knew the situation?   The group was unaware of the 2500 dollar minimum.  And the look of shock on everyone's face when they were hit with a 2500 bill was clear evidence of that.  A 5-minute discussion with the people in the room before we began would have saved a lot of words, a lot of money, and everyone would have walked away happy.  Even though the room was booked for 8, the restaurant didn't seat us until almost 9. So the unaware customers are accountable, but the restaurant can seat us when they please...we paid in full   We were only given bottled water (flat and sparking).  Glasses were filled often and new bottles were opened readily by the wait staff.  We bought wine by the bottle.  Staff filled wine glasses regardless of the vineyard that was in the glass, and without anyone asking for more wine.  Honestly, if I buy the bottle, I pour my own wine at my leisure and I don't assume that if it is red, I can pour more red in the same glass.  When the bottle was empty, the staff asked if we needed another bottle.  Convenient!   The waiters did not know the menu. They let several people to order the same side dish that was included with their meal.  They brought the entrees, vegetables and the duplicate vegetable (ordered as a side dish).  They said the duplicates were ""extra"".   So are the service issues poorly trained staff or bad business practices.  I would say the former, but either way it reflects poorly on the manager. Honestly, everything was trivial until we were surprised by the bill.  The lack of any discussion before the meal and no explanation to the group after the meal just exacerbated the issue.   It was so awkward.  And nothing was posted anywhere on the menu or website.   No one says anything about a minimum, we were seated late, we pay in full, then they send gift cards so we can come back into the restaurant and spend some of the money they already took from us.   Why would you think I would ever come back?  Especially after I ""forced you"" to respond. Again, the food was good.  The service was terrible.  I would never go back and would caution any group to spend their money elsewhere.",0.8002,0.874,0.067,0.059,0.5270383006823685

After the three of us were seated we perused the menu - small but well edited. Per the server's suggestion, we started with the onion dip and I chose the duck ravioli for my meal. The onion dip is super flavorful and nicely complemented by the salty potato chips. It's reminiscent of grocery store onion dip, but, of course, incredibly fresh. My meal was also full of flavor - tender duck confit stuffed into a ravioli pillow with a side of cherry chutney and a veal reduction sauce. It was a solid and well made pasta dish, but it's worth noting there were only four ravioli for $20 or so. It was enough food for me, but I wasn't ravenous at the time.

2011-09-21,3.0,"My friend and I are big fans of Gemini Bistro, and specifically their roasted organic chicken, so choosing to eat at its sister restaurant was an easy choice.  After inadvertently walking into Taco Joint next door and quickly realizing we were in the wrong place, we walked in to this lovely, and yes, rustic, little place. It definitely reminded me of Gemini Bistro.  The decor is very cozy and warm. It has a bar and wood burning oven in the front part of the restaurant which has about a dozen or so tables. There also appears to be a dining area in the back, but we were seated in the front so I can't comment on the back space or its size.  The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived (it was on the early side), so they were nice enough to seat us at a four top. I took a look at the cocktail menu and was hoping to see some old favorites that I enjoyed so much at Gemini Bistro. Where was my old friend ""The Squirtsky""? It wasn't on the cocktail list so I had to settle for a ""Pomelito,"" which was a blend of Milagro tequila, fresh grapefruit and lime juices, a splash of soda, and garnished with a grapefruit supreme. It was a tasty concoction, but I was a little bummed that there was no garnish.  The menu was divided into sections which had snacks, starters, daily rotisserie, mains and sides. It was a pretty extensive menu, but not overwhelming. Snacks included things like marinated olives, duck-fat almonds, kettle chips w/ onion dip; starters were lobster bisque, grilled oysters and a couple salads; rotisserie items change daily (the chicken is always available) but feature suckling pig, duck a l'orange, and lamb. Other entrees include monkfish, steaks, duck ravioli and chicken pot pie. There are options to suit everyone.  We passed on appetizers as we were trying to conserve calories so we could order dessert instead, and naturally we both ordered their roasted organic chicken, which comes with one side. Choosing sides was a little harder as there were many --creamed corn brulee, brussel sprouts with pancetta, three-cheese potato gratin, and many other delicious sounding items. I went with the three-cheese potato gratin at the recommendation of the server, and in an attempt to be healthy, my friend had broccoli with chili and fennel seeds.  Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The chicken was plated beautifully and looked delicious--crispy, juicy and freckled with fresh herbs. My potatoes came in a mini-cast iron pot with a nice crust of bubbly cheese on top.  The chicken was very good. Roast chicken can be a little boring but this was anything but. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and it was very moist. I enjoyed the potatoes but they were a bit undercooked and not very tender; still, they were good, after all cheese and potatoes can never be wrong.  I purposely only ate half my dinner so I could save room for dessert. I immediately zeroed in on the blueberry pie which was served with Black Dog blueberry gelato. It arrived piping hot (in the same cute mini-cast iron pot as the potatoes), and it had a beautiful sugared lattice crust and a tiny scoop of blueberry gelato. It was a large portion, and while I wanted to devour it all, I could only manage half.  It's 3.5 stars as I really liked it but for some reason I think I'll remain loyal to Gemini Bistro.

For dessert we ended up with scotch and a cheese plate.  I was expecting something more elaborate cheese wise but in the end we both decided it was perfect.",0.9916,0.691,0.282,0.026,0.7205215419501133

2011-08-25,3.0,"Pretty good place. Loved the room, although the noise level was obnoxious as the crowd grew. No complaints about service. But the food--I'd have to say, not such a big fan. My first visit was last night with the spousal equivalent and a mutual friend. I'd say there's no shortage of good restaurants in the Armitage/Halsted neighborhood, so this place has its work cut out for it. We started with a snack (yup, that's what they call it) of whole almonds, which seemed to have been heated and drenched in oil--I guess that would be duck fat, if we take the menu as being the truth. We're not the type to complain about our dinner while we're eating, but none of us liked this $5 snack at all. It was just awful. It tasted exactly as I described it: almonds heated in oil. If that's your thing, go for it. I like almonds and I like duck fat (at least when used to fry potatoes), but I'll tell you, this was tasteless and greasy and totally without charm. We didn't finish it. We also ordered the spinach salad and grilled octopus as starters. Both of these were pretty good. The spinach salad comes with a lovely poached egg perched on top, which I thought as a nice touch. For entrees, we ordered chicken pot pie, grilled duck l'orange, and veal cheek ragout. Although all three were good, the duck seemed to be the thing to order here. Desserts were the Whatamacallit (a kind of chocolate covered mound) and the creme brulee trio. Both were very good, although I preferred the creme brulee. Parking is very tough in this neighborhood, although if you dine early you should be able to find something on the street.  They also have valet parking, a necessity in that area.  We also had one mixed drink and two coffees, and the total bill was $145, which I consider reasonable for the quality and neighborhood.",0.9745,0.802,0.127,0.072,0.6368333333333334

We started off with the duck fat almonds.  Well, I almost burned my tongue on the first couple I ate, but wow...you can really taste the duck fat.  It is rich, decadent, and addictive.   I ordered the organic free-range rotisserie chicken with a side of brussel sprouts with pancetta, and it did not disappoint.  Usually, I NEVER order chicken from a restaurant, just on the sheer principle that I can almost always make it just as well.   However, since a number of the Yelp reviews recommended it, I decided to order out of character.  The chicken...was juicy.  The skin was crisp.  It was absolutely perfect.  And the brussel sprouts were great...you can't go wrong with brussel sprouts and pancetta. My friend ordered the veal cheek ragout (what I would have gotten instead of the chicken)...I tried it and it was great.  You could definitely tell that the pappardelle was freshly made. I'm a fan of Rustic House...I definitely want to come back to try some other menu items.  I feel like I need to try more of their dishes before I go ahead and award them their fifth star.  Also, note: they have a three-course prix fixe menu from 5-6:30pm everyday for $38.  I'll come hungrier next time.",0.9959,0.778,0.222,0.0,0.5373724489795918

2011-08-14,4.0,"I enjoyed the food much more than the layout of this place. It seems cozy and quaint but the space was a bit cramped and the tables were very close together in the back dinning room. Other than that I had an enjoyable time and great dinner. Right away we order some small dishes like kettle chips and onion dip and chicken liver mousse. They came out very quick and helped settle our appetite while having that first drink as we looked over the menu. They had a nice wine selection with some reasonably priced until they bottles start adding up and then your liquor tab outdoes your food tab. The starters were nice and I would recommend the oysters or the pork belly. Avoid the Farmers salad if you don't like strong onion flavors. The menu says nothing about this salad having onion but its there and very strong. For main dishes, the chicken pot pie was the winner at the table. The lamb shoulder was also good as well as the wagyu flat iron steak which had this great black bean puree side. For dessert, the Whatchamacallit and blueberry pie are a must. They are so good that it will be hard to want to share them. I also order a Brandy Alexander which is basically an adult shake, a very strong adult shake. It has two scoops of vanilla gelato and couple of shots of brandy. I plan to go back on a thursday when they have the suckling pig as a menu option.

2011-08-02,4.0,"Free range just about anything, that is kind of how their menu reads. What caught my eye was their free range veal rack and free range chicken. The latter makes more sense than the former...but who am I to judge on how you raise your meat? My boyfriend and I narrowed our Friday night dinner with his dad down to Rustic House. Why? #1 it was actually kind of close to where we live. #2 Good wine and beer list to appease the dad and ourselves. #3 Wide array of options on the main menu and side menu. #4 It's fairly new, and you know I gotta try it! We started with the duck fat almond snack which contained roughly about 50 almonds that were salted by the duck fat marinade and some salt. So good! You can fatty marinade any nut and I'd be on it... All ""snacks"" are $5. They also bring out bread which was spongy with hints of garlic and rosemary, it was quite good. I started with the spinach salad which had bacon and a poached egg on top. It was SOO good, the poached egg was perfectly cooked and coated my salad juuuust right. I finished all of it. Others had the bibb salad and grilled calamari which was good but left a weird taste in my mouth. Maybe that's cuz it was well charred, but not at all rubbery which is better than most grilled octo. The lobster bisque was nice and smoky rather than milky. It had a lot of chunks of lobster, I would highly recommend it! For the main course they have free range chicken every day with a side of multiple veggie options or potato options. There are additional specials of meat each other day as well. Most of the main entrees come with a side. I got the duck confit ravioli which had the best mild sweet sauce to accompany it.  The  beau ordered the swordfish. The cut of fish was probably the biggest piece of fish I had ever seen, with a freakin bone on it! I think the waitress actually said the same, he must have gotten the better cut. That being said, it was mighty mighty huge, enough to feed 3 people. My boyfriend usually tends to eat all of his meal, plus mine, so the fact that he couldn't finish his says A LOT!  All in all, Rustic House posed great service and delectable food. The atmosphere is pretty contemporary but has a warm feeling.

The chef accompanied the server out to make sure he pored it correctly. The first taste was delish, but then the overwhelming amount of salt kicked in.. I love salt more than most, but I couldn't finish the bowl, too bad.. I ordered the swordfish neck and my husband had the veil chop. Both good, the fish portion was quite large.

2011-07-12,4.0,"It's a quaint restaurant with dim lighting and great ambiance. The restaurant is basically two rooms separated by a long hallway. We were also informed that there's a private dining space in the wine cellar which sounds awesome. The front room is louder - that's where the bar is, but also where you can see the rotisserie roasting. Good for: taking parents out to eat, dates, and even just a snack and drink at the bar. The food is separated into snacks, starters, rotisserie, and mains. We opted for two of the snacks instead of a starter, but the hand-rolled gnocchi is calling me back to try. DO get the Duck-Fat Marcona Almonds, they were great to snack on as we chatted and drank wine. The Kettle Chips/Sea Salt/Onion Dip was fine, I thought the chips were a bit too thin and too salty. For our mains, we all ordered something different so we could taste several dishes. The Duck Confit Ravioli rocked. There were 4 large raviolis stuffed with delicious duck in a tasty veal reduction sauce and cherry compote (preserved/cooked in syrup). It was the perfect amount. The restaurant features the rotisserie, so I'm glad my friend ordered it. Each day Organic Chicken is available, along with the special of the day. On Friday it was Veal Rack, she went with the chicken. Very moist, and again, a good portion, not too outrageously huge. Had a bite of the Halibut (served with sweet corn and lobster succatash) and Veal Cheek Ragout (served with a wide noodle). I can only say good things about what we ate!

Everyone was all smiles as they ushered us to our table by the window.  It's a nice space and perfect for what we were looking for.  A nice, cozy neighborhood place where you don't feel out of place for not dressing up. The cocktail list looked good but I decided to pass it up this time.  Kudos to the water guy for keeping us replenished all night.  Some of the starters looked delish but we decided to go right for the entrees.  We figured that the rotisserie and the wood burning grill were their signatures so we had the pork shoulder rotisserie and the salmon on the wood burning grill with creamed corn brulee and the roasted garlic spinach sides. After about 45 minutes our entrees finally arrived.  This is a very long time if you're not drinking.  It's a good thing we like each other and didn't run out of things to talk about during the wait!   The salmon is gigantic, 10 oz.  It was pretty good but it was drenched in olive oil and garlic.  I like olive oil and garlic but it was definitely overwhelming.  I was disappointed, as I would have liked to taste the effects of the wood burning grill.  The creamed corn brulee was not what I expected.  I was thinking that it would be basically creamed corn that was torched on top.  I was wrong.  It was very sweet, didn't have much corn and had the consistency of quiche, only not quite as solid.  I didn't like it.  The pork shoulder was better, but tasted like something you'd get at the carving table off of a buffet.  The garlic spinach was good, the highlight of the meal. Overall, the experience was just ok.  I appreciated that the management seemed enthusiastic and genuinely interested in providing good service.  It seems like it has a lot of potential.  Next time I will try some of the drinks, starters and entrees.  Perhaps I was looking for something with a little more pizzaz.",0.9984,0.748,0.23,0.022,0.6320937263794406
