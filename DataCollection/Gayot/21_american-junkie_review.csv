2015-01-11,1.0,"My friends and I chose to go here hoping to have fun - the DJ was decent, the place is big so there was plenty of space to choose a good spot to dance and not get knocked into. My compliments end there. I'm not sure if he was having a rough night, but the bartender who served me demonstrated the worst customer service I've experienced period. I know bars get crowded and drunk customers are annoying, but there was no excuse for his behavior or ego. I'm normally a calm person and ordered a whisky sour - he left to make the drink and I was chatting with my friend to figure out what she wanted to drink so I could order something for her too. By the time the bartender came back with the drink, I was looking in the wallet for payment (the club is pretty dark so its difficult to see) so I made sure I grabbed the right card. Frankly, only a total of 10 seconds passed, until he decided that was ""too slow"" he took the drink away and put it under the bar. I flagged him down again and he had an attitude about me being too slow and refused to accept my payment for the drink. He didn't even throw out the drink, it just sat under the counter. A customer being ""too slow"" to is NEVER an excuse to miss out on revenue for the restaurant/company/etc that you work for. That was a first out of any bar or club I've been to.  No manager to be found or tracked down, when I asked for one. Based on the reaction of the bouncer trying to kick me out, jumping to conclusions and disrespecting customers is the norm. No wonder the place will be under new management or at least that's what I heard.",-0.8043,0.817,0.084,0.099,0.5208327514779129

2014-11-24,1.0,"I would definitely keep copies of all of your receipts if you are using a card. I went in for a birthday party and purchased a shot, a beer and a margarita which came to somewhere around $25. I closed out immediately and threw away my receipt. Two days later I went to make a payment on my credit card and realized I was overcharged by $200 more than I should have been. So for a shot, margarita and beer I paid American Junkie $225. I called the GM and they were not able to fix the problem since my credit card company was already notified and cancelled the credit card used. Two and a half months later my credit card is unable to refund the additional $200 charged because American Junkie did not return any of their messages and have been completely non-responsive. I would never go here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone. If I wanted to spend $225, I would have ordered bottle service instead. I can't imagine all of the drunk people that get taken advantage of here. They clearly have no respect for their customers because if they did, the General Manager would have responded to my email I sent him last week.

Let me mention here - I never send back drinks. Ever. I sent back the old fashioned. It was literally the worst old fashioned I've ever had - just disgustingly, syrupy sweet. My friend choked hers down (I think she made it through about 2/3 of it before calling it quits) and we both switched to plain, good ol templeton rye on the rocks. Hard to mess that up. But seriously, over $100 for 7 standard drinks, badly made or not? Hah. Add to that, my friend and I split the bill, leaving the tip on one of our cards - and they switched our invoices somehow and charged the wrong cards. Neither I nor my friend realized this until I did my monthly bank statement check a couple weeks later and noticed the wrong amount charged for American Junkie. I tried calling American Junkie numerous times to get that resolved, all during their business hours, only to be rung straight to an automated voice system every single time. All of their extension options rang straight to voice mail boxes as well. Absolute crap - the drinks, but more than that, the management.

The view of the city on the rooftop isn't that spectacular, but I do like that the space is big and they have plenty of seating. I'm sure seating is normally reserved, but since it was a private event we could pretty much sit wherever. There were two bartenders. The guy was great and since there was no cocktail list he help me come up with different mixes. The girl on the other hand didn't seem like she wanted to be there and sort of had a stuck up attitude.  All in all we had a good time.

No acknowledgement, no greeting, no welcome, no nothing but scorn. He only greeted chicks. While I was contemplating ordering food this ahole actually grabbed my menu without asking if. I was done or if I wanted anything and gave it to a couple if chicks who he was working on. I guess it's his personal little pickup playground. But he had no problem grabbing the tip I left for the other bartender when I got up to leave. I haven't been in the industry in many years, but i still think the goal is to provide excellent service.

We went with the bacon wrapped dates (surprised that even these weren't great), mussels, lobster roll and tuna burger. The lobster roll and tuna burger were pretty bland, there was a weak attempt in spicing up the tuna burger with a little too much pepper, but it didn't do the trick. The mussels weren't bad but still didn't excite as much, probably my favorite part of dinner if I had to pick.

Our waitress came and she was very nice, don't know where she was when we were waiting, and got us some water (which was all we wanted), found out if we'd been there before or not (which we hadn't), then proceeded to let us know about their lunch special (every weekday, 11-3 I think, $13-- includes one sandwich, and one lunch size salad or a soup) and that it qualified for the Groupon: awesome!

Didn't look upstairs and didn't go there in the evening so I can't comment on whether it sucks or is ok, but from what my experience was downstairs it's not bad for lunch.

We ordered, I got a shaved Prime Rib sandwich complete with sweet potato fries and a side salad that had steak and artichoke hearts and bleu cheese in it. Not bad! My bestfriend got the Lobster Roll, also with the sweet potato fries and some Manhattan clam chowder which she enjoyed quite well.

We ordered a number of different items and pretty much all of it was solid. My walleye was cooked pretty well (not perfect, but better than many places do) and the sauce with it was really good.

I noticed the lobster roll was very popular among people that wrote reviews here, so I had no choice but to order it. The lobster roll has lobster (seemed like crab meat actually), lemon, chives and brandy mayo on a new england bun. It was pretty good, but as a guy that enjoys lobster, it didn't seem like that's what I had. It comes with fries (sweet potato or regular) and I chose the sweet potato option which included ketchup and a delicious aioli sauce....loved it. The bar is a nice size and has TVs from every angle so you can keep up with whats going on the world of sports. They have a nice beer selection which is surprising for a part of town where most of the peeps order bud & miller lites. I opted for the Kentucky Bourbon Beer in which it tastes like it sounds; bourbon with beer lol. There is an upstairs portion of this place known as Attic which seems like more of a partying atmosphere. DJ was spinning some great joints for our listening pleasure which is always nice and essential to keep a party rocking. Love the setup with all the seats and the big ass graphic lights board.

The upstairs was not even that crowded. After about 10min of different girls running down and saying they were with them, they got in.

We were going to leave and go somewhere else so I told him to just wait we'll be outside. The birthday girl decided to stay so I texted him and let him know that. He went back to the doorman and asked if he could go up now (He was freezing) and the doorman changed his mind and told him $20!

The waitress came by often enough to make sure we were topped off at all times so that was nice. As for the usual crowd, it's a blend of good-looking crowd with trashy-ish suburban Ed Hardy sporting crowd ... it's kinda weird but they have their share of good looking people and I've had a ton of great people watching experiences here ... for some reason people tend to loose their sh-t here haha. It's a nice Sunday Funday stop for a drink or 2 in the summertime too. And they have a huge projector upstairs and will turn on the sound for some games, which is a huge plus in River North.

Yeah, I was judging it solely by appearance but it did indeed turn out to be terrible when we finally went.

One of the worst things I've ever had in a restaurant. The flatbread was just bland. No flavor at all. The pork belly? HAH that was not pork belly. That was dry, overcooked, tasteless pork. Terrible. Even the gorgonzola on it was bad. The quality of the ingredients were just piss poor. I had to force myself to finish this dried out excuse for a flatbread because I was starving. We sent my girlfriend's plate back to the kitchen when the server finally came around- after I had already finished eating the entirety of mine. She never made one of those quick check ups after the food was served to see how we liked it. We never ever normally send things back to the kitchen. This was a first. Strike three was my beer.

The restaurant is more trendy than a simple Chicago bar and the rooftop looked nice from downstairs even though we didn't go up. We definitely enjoyed sitting by the open windows on a nice Chicago summer night so we were happy about that. Yes, you're kind of on top of your neighbors but you just make it work. Going for a Bears game is definitely a place to be cheering on with your other Chi town fans. Also, making reservations is definitely recommended because otherwise you'll be waiting for a while to get in.  So we had to get some of their talked about munchies. We got their bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese in a spicy red pepper sauce and they were very tasty and you get 6 of them for $10. Our friends got the Shrimp appetizer wrapped in a flakey dough that they also seemed to enjoy. For our entrees we split the junkie sliders which were very cute and their lobster roll and both of those entrees come with fries which we got sweet potato of course. The sliders were adorable but tasted pretty average, would have liked something more unique on them like a tomato jam but our friends got the pork belly sliders with quail eggs and liked those. The lobster roll was absolutely delicious and for $15 it was a steal. Tons of lobster meat filled with some kind of mayo dressing, I'm thinking it was one of the best I've had in Chicago, but shh don't tell them that. We were too full for dessert at that point but the chocolate pecan pie definitely sounded appetizing. Our server was pretty on top of it except in the end she messed up the check a little bit, honest mistake and we didn't fault her too much for it.

Let's talk about how whoever runs this place is a terrible business person.  I have worked in VIP nightlife in cities where actual VIP nightlife exists. I know how it works. Never before have I even heard of establishments making their bottle service customers wait in a line. THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY YOU A 700% MARKUP ON BOOZE TO BE IN THIS SHIT HOLE. Be grateful! Invite them in, roll out a red carpet, tell them how great their bedazzled button up shirts look, ask them where they got their spray tans so that you can get one too. Under no circumstance do you make them wait in a line outside of your shit hole. Somehow they have been duped already, and you need to take advantage of that before they realize that they are complete and utter morons and need to go spend their money anywhere else.  I wasn't even too concerned that I was not being let in even though I was the first name on a list of VIP's (the door guy refused to even look at the list, probably to avoid revealing to everyone that he can't even read). No, I was horrified at how completely asinine their business practices were. Idiots, I tell you. Fucking idiots.

Steak came out okay; cooked rare to specification, but unfortunately, missed the sweet taste of premium beef available at its legitimate steaky competitors up the street.  Salad, which consisted of mostly romaine lettuce with a topping of my choice, was forgettable. Seafood salad looked interesting, but overall tasted underwhelming.  You know there's a problem when the waitress needs to ask the kitchen if the crab is in fact real crab (supposedly it was).",0.1531,0.81,0.097,0.093,0.5815789473684211

2013-06-29,2.0,"So you know- I'm not the clubbin' type anymore so this review is for a Wednesday night during the Hawks playoffs and not late night on a weekend . . .so there were no lines to get in or some of the other River North expectations.  But there were more misses than hits. First of all, I get that they have to check everyone's ID.  But 21 is a long way in my rear view mirror and the fact that  I accidentally breezed by the bouncer (I'm a little out of practice of showing my ID)and it was made into a huge scene in the front of the place as he demanded my ID was a bit much!  Sheesh! My other gripe was that even with a reservation- they wouldn't seat my friend until I got there.  So they left her standing in the front area- right next to the table they were going to sit us at.  Go figure!  A little common sense would go a long way here . . .especially since the place was not full. Our server was a ditz but I guess that's to be expected in a place like this, I guess.  She really had no idea about how the food was prepared which was too bad as the chef here is all about creating interesting combinations and was one of the reasons we chose to come.  She took our order- only to come back later to tell us our mussels appetizer was no longer available.  So we added the ribs to our order. Well, talk about timing issues.  The ribs came up in a couple of minutes, and they were not hot nor was the BBQ sauce that was obviously poured over at the last minute.  Not good.  And where were our appetizers that were ordered long before the ribs? Well then our appetizers showed up.  We had ordered a range of things hoping to try some of the unique flavor combinations I had heard about- but all I can say is that sometimes simple is better. The mushroom risotto with asparagus, mushrooms and shrimp was good but the addition of the tomato sauce made it taste like two dishes had been combined.  The wild boar chili cheese fries were a soggy mess (I was hoping for something more akin to ""poutine"" but it missed the mark).  The cauliflower with dried fruit and vinaigrette was also a miss.  I think the best thing we had were the bacon wrapped dates but it's hard to do anything with those!  And the grilled octopus was okay as well. They fared a little better on the specialty drink list although not much as the two we tried were overly sweet for my taste. But the real kicker came when I went to go upstairs as this place has a rooftop area with a retractable roof that I thought might be a great place to grab a cocktail after work with friends.  Given we were seated by the stairs- I had seen many people making their way up and down the stairs so I went to take a look.  Again- I had an unpleasant interaction with a bouncer.  He told me it was ""bottle service"" only upstairs and that I couldn't go up. Really?  On a Wednesday night at 10:30?  I'm guessing probably not.  And I didn't want to drink . . .I only wanted to look.  So after a bit of negotiation, I was finally ""allowed"" to walk up a flight of stairs to the rooftop.  The space is quite nice- large bar- plenty of places to sit and gather . . .it could have potential . . .but who wants to go through all that hassle to have a drink?  Not me. So even though I was supposed to be back at American Junkie that same week- I suggested to my friends that we go elsewhere.  As I, for one, am too smart for rude bouncers, mediocre food, and a place that has an attitude that thinks it's guests are merely a pain to be dealt with.",0.9936,0.823,0.119,0.058,0.48377356150793654

Shout out to Moe's Cantina, I see you boy! -I've lived in Logan Square for the past four years, which is my roundabout way of saying, I was predisposed to hate this place. So much to my surprise (and based on Yelp reviews, everyone else's), I didn't hate American Junkie. I, suffice to say, enjoyed my meal.  I should note I dined at 6:30 on a Tuesday (reservation was not necessary) so I can't speak to a majority of what the complaints on here seem to stem from (poor service, access upstairs, long waits at the bar). Our waitress was attentive and respectful. Also, it should be noted that the acoustic duo performing in the back of the restaurant did a really nice cover of ""Human Nature,"" one of my top six Michael Jackson songs off ""Thriller."" It also totally reminded me of a run I went on at a blackjack table at Planet Hollywood while the same song was playing. This also all occurred while I was eating nachos.

2013-05-27,1.0,"Started at this place the Sunday before Memorial Day.  For a holiday weekend, it was not as crowded as you would think.  In fact the place was dead.  I came here the opening weekend and it was PACKED, and fun.  Can't say the same for this night.  Ordered 2 mixed drinks at the bar, closed the tab ($19, not too outrageous for the area).  The bartenders butt was literally showing from the bottom of her shorts.  I guess thats what they want though?  Anyways, ordered another round of drinks from the other bartender, asked to close my tab out and she says ""Theres a $30 dollar minimum"".  Confused, I explained that literally 20 minutes ago I closed my tab with the exact same things on it.  She seemed mad, and I would have kept my tab open if we weren't planning on going upstairs, but she closed it out anyways.  Also, for some reason, the 2 exact same drinks cost 20 dollars now.  Whatever. After our drinks my friend and I (both girls, dressed nice, etc) went outside to go to the upstairs part of American Junkie, which is more club like.  I don't understand what it is about these places in River North wanting these bars to seem like they're a Vegas night club.  ITS NOT.  Bottle service at a bar is absurd, anyone paying it is kind of stupid, and most of the time the atmosphere is NOTHING like a real Vegas club.  But pretend away. The door guy outside lets 2 people in front of us in (yes you have to go BACK outside to go upstairs), then pulls the rope in front of us and we kind of expected to wait anyways because again, this is River North, its what they do.  After making small talk with the man he asks if we have reservations for a table.  Confused, we told him no, and he tells us the bar is ""pretty much at capacity right now and were only letting people in with table reservations"".  Umm, what?  Your downstairs bar is completely dead, I've seen people leaving from upstairs the entire time I was sitting downstairs, but its ""pretty much at capacity""?  Whatever.  We go to walk away and a group of 3 girls who just wanted up to the door man are getting let in.  We just wanted to see what it was like upstairs, clubs are NOT my scene to begin with, so we weren't too heartbroken. As we walk away, this group of gentlemen invite us to their table.  We go upstairs and decide to go grab a drink at the bar.  The place was NOT at capacity.  You could move around freely, half the tables were open, there was standing room AT THE BAR, etc.  We waited for 20 minutes before deciding f*** it.  While we were walking towards the door, my friend saw her friend who is a bouncer there and told him we were leaving because we couldn't get a drink.  He walked us over to the bar, flagged down the bartender who was NOT happy about it.  We went to order our drinks and before we could even say our order she says ""What do you need?  IM IN A HURRY HERE!"".  Get a clue.  I understand working in at busy bar/restaurant is stressful, especially when its busy.  I've worked in both those settings.  When its not busy, which this place wasn't, theres no need to be rude.  Be kind and SMILE.  We paid our tab, chugged our drinks and left.   The setup of the place is cool, lots of TVs, the service downstairs isn't half bad.  Upstairs is a joke.  I understand hustling and making drinks as fast as you can to get more tips.  But being rude to customers that are the ones tipping you will result in no tips.",0.9887,0.829,0.11,0.061,0.46355259617971495

2013-05-24,4.0,"Good Lawd this bar has racked up the haters. I was warned about the spotty service and lackluster cocktails before I visited American Junkie one Friday evening. But I am also just about the most stubborn, hard-headed gal you'll meet, and therefore if you tell me to stay away, I'm probably going to go anyway. Twice.  Hubs and I took my visiting cousin here after too many rounds of martinis at The Knickerbocker, and therefore had the liquid patience to deal with a presumably d-bag crowd. Except... AJ was missing its supposed standard of patrons. All we could identify were 9-5'ers as far as the glassy-eyed could see. And since Hubs is hooked-the-eff-up, he called ahead and got us a table upstairs. Bonus points to me for marrying Mr. Chicago. AJ informed us we needed to dip or buy a bottle to keep our table after 10pm, but that's cool, I respect the honesty and business. Cash money keeps a bar open, not pretty faces. We ordered cocktails and flatbreads and enjoyed the transition from day to night under their retractable roof. 1. Get the Sunset Blvd and then keep ordering it. It isn't sweet, and it goes down smoothly with Effen cuke, St. Germ and prosecco. 2. order the mushroom flatbread because it's delicious and easy to eat. This isn't Five Guys- order something dainty, please. 3. It was still hella cold in April and therefore we had to pretend to feel the Chicago breeze under the, thankfully, still closed glass rooftop. Just a thank you in general to AJ for keeping us comfortable and not showing off your new toys.  A note about the service: the servers are excellent. Really. When my cousin had had three martinis too many and spilled shizzle everywhere and always, our waitress was sweet and just smiled and winked and had someone clean it up. Repeatedly. She checked on us as often as she could and was so polite. However, AJ does not staff enough waitresses, and therefore our poor waitress was zooming around like Tinkerbell on speed. So be nice, and tip nicely.  I'll definitely come back in the summer when I can experience eau d'Chicago in warmth because AJ is place to see and be seen.",0.9957,0.773,0.174,0.053,0.5599020508111417

I'd say probably.  Our food came out surprisingly fast, once I started eating I immediately knew why.  The food was frozen at one time, and out of a jar/can etc.  My Bison burger was ordered medium rare and came out well done on a soggy bun.  It was definitely freezer burnt and the mushrooms that topped it were so chewy I couldn't bite into them. It had a decent flavor, but not great.  My boyfriend had a steak sandwich per the server recommendation, it wasn't bad, but again, very greasy and salty.  Fake cheese with frozen vegetables.  We tried to order the chili cheese fries but unfortunately they were out so we got the regular fries instead, they were well seasoned, but were definitely frozen, we even had the bottom of the bag remnants in our bowl to prove it. We decided to check out the upstairs ""club"" the bouncers let us up there no problem, it was definitely a happening place as there was a bar crawl going on at the time, the Preakness just ended, and the White Sox were playing.  It was really nice.  The bar tenders were either not trained, or overwhelmed.  They didn't seem to be rushing at all to get drinks out, I waited nearly 5 minutes, the poor guy beside me had been waiting for 10 just to get noticed.  Once i ordered my Moscow Mule the server lost the signature slip for my tab so I had to wait another 10 for her to figure out how to re print it.  That didn't bother me, but I felt bad for the other patrons who couldn't get a drink or even a glance.   I would go back there if the group I was with wanted to go.  The food wasn't good so this is definitely a spot to hit up for a few drinks or possibly an appetizer.  I've had way worse food but the drinks were good and the place had a great comfortable rooftop.",0.9942,0.779,0.155,0.066,0.5254426129426131

My manfriend & I arrived a little early for the reservation, so we grabbed a beer at the bar downstairs. They have a decent beer menu, but the downstairs beer list is different than the upstairs list (in my opinion, downstairs is better). Prices are about what I'd expect for this area, $6-$8ish for a pint. The menu is also decent, though slightly pricey for what are essentially small bar eats.  We got seated upstairs underneath the ginormous American flag. I have to give props where props are due, I admit I like the decor and layout of this place, and the bathrooms are clean & huge (though they do have attendants). But that's about where my ""likes"" end. Bouncers in 3-piece suits, giving you side eye every time you try to go to the bathroom. Also, not exactly the greatest waitress service, our waitress tended to disappear for 30 minutes at a time, so much so that we had to go up to the bar and order beers ourselves. Oh, and since we had a group of 6, apparently the waitress got an automatic-yet-VERY-undeserved 20% tip.  However, the highlight of the evening happened when this place turns into ""American Junkie After Dark"".  Douche. City.  5 minutes after the Bulls game was over, bus boys came out and made all the patrons sitting at the bar give up their chairs. We essentially got kicked out of our reserved table so it could become someone else's reserved table. A bus boy came over, dragged our tables around as we were still sitting at them, and started setting it up for bottle service, slamming down plastic glasses & carafes of cranberry juice. I felt like Joakim Noah when that (alleged) husband-killing Miami broad gave him the finger.  We were then swiftly surrounded by dudes wearing Sperry Top-Siders & pink sweaters tied around their necks to set up shop at their [our] bottle service table. I wish I was kidding about the sweater thing, but I'm so not. If I expected anyone to order bottle service at a Chicago bar, these would be the dudes. Apparently their money spends better than mine. When we decided to get the hell out of dodge & go to a better bar, I didn't even have my coat on before the guy pulled my chair away. So classy.

One girlfriend had suggested American Junkie and since I had heard some hype about this new place, I figured 'why not?"".  Well being the avid Yelper that I am, as we arrived I 'checked in"". To my surprise, this place only had 2 stars but I always like to form my own opinion. Unfortunately, Yelp hit the nail on the head with its rating.  Let's start with the good-  The place is huge with 2 floors and open floor plan. The upstairs has a massive TV with many other flat screens and  has lots of seating and I did I mention the retractable ceiling? Pretty sweet. The place was packed as the Hawks game was just starting but we were able to find some standing space available at the bar.  Okay, that's about all the good i've got.... Now let's move on to the bad.....  As soon as we walked through the doors, we were ""greeted"" by 4 ladies lined up next to each other behind a hostess stand. Now the reason I say ""greeted"" is because there was really no 'hello' or 'how can I help you' so we awkwardly walked right past them and tried finding seating ourselves.  As I previously mentioned, the bar was packed for the Hawks game. There were tables available on the first floor but only if you planned on eating. Come on, you can't just let us sit and enjoy our cocktails without ordering food? So anyway,  we decided to go check out the upstairs where we stood at the packed bar. They had two female bartenders dressed in skimpy black dresses and  were so thin that I probably could have used one of them as toothpick. I get that it's a sports bar and they're trying to attract men predominately so their outfits didn't really bother me. However, what did bother me was it taking forever to receive our overpriced cocktails. This busy of a night, 2 bartenders didn't cut it. They needed to throw another girl behind the bar, hell, throw a man back there just to give the ladies some eye candy perhaps.  I think customer service is the main issue with this place. It's a very nice set up and great space but if they don't get their act together this place is going to continue to lose a lot of good customers.",0.9911,0.815,0.141,0.044,0.53457086391869

2013-05-06,2.0,"Let me start by saying this bar has big space. The downstairs bar is nice and open, good music selection. Upstairs will be awesome in the summer time with the retractable roof and windows. But the downfall of this bar will be the service. First off, I had to call twice regarding our reservation. The guy on the initial phone call was helpful and offered me a booth for our 6+ people. I received the email confirming the reservation for only two people though. So I called back to fix my reservation and get a rude hostess who wouldn't guarantee the booth. Not sure if it helped, but I also mentioned we all worked at one of the more well known restaurants in the city. We walk in to ONE table in the place and shoved in the corner and NOT a booth. Did I forget to mention there was only one table downstairs and 4 people at the bar. So VERY DEAD! Strike two! The downstairs bar isn't built for one bartender. Nothing wrong with her personally. Seemed like a sweet girl. But greet a guest within a minute of them sitting. Whether it be hi, I'll be right with you , maybe even a smile? Service sucked when there are 4 people at the bar total. Being a new place they definitely need to step up the service aspect. I think this has to do with the management . They need to enforce the importance of customer service. The pos system seems to suck too! Three strikes. Which means I probably would only go back if I was drunk. And I don't drink so what's that tell ya. Just stinks cuz we are all in the industry and always looking for a place to recommend to guests. Let me finish by saying this. Yelp sucks! Especially if you are a new restaurant. People like to tear you apart when they probably have never worked a day in the industry . I think the training process needs to be restarted over here. Emphasize the importance of customer service. Because that's going to be half you battle!!! That includes managers! Biggest pet peeve...watching a busy bartender/server and you look over at the manager doing nothing.  What happened to TEAM!

2013-05-06,2.0,"I am giving this 2 star only because the Ambiance is so cool! I have been here 2 times not and the first time was just for a couple drinks after work. Our waitress was nice but not very attentive, but I assumed since it had just recently opened that maybe she was new. I loved the layout of the bar and the upstairs is very trendy with good music. So I recommended to some of my friends that we go back there for a birthday gathering. We had 15 people with us, all on my and another friends recommendation. This is where is all it all went down hill fast. We had reservations for 715. There was a line outside, we told the door man we were here for our 715 reservation (it was about 710) and he told us it didn't matter that everyone has to wait in line. I asked what will happen to our reservations if we don't get in my 715. He said they will give them away. Already not starting off with a good impression to my group of friends. Eventually they moved the line and we got in around 725. Luckily they still seated us. After being seated our waitress did not arrive for 25 mins. Took our drink order and came back  with them about 15 mins later. 40 MINS to get a drink at a bar. That's crazy to me.  TO make things worse as we were waiting a friend of mine that plans all her works events for a large company wanted to see what the upstairs looked like so that she could use it for an event. They would not let her even go look at it. They said you have to have reservations to go up there. I explained that we are at a table, which I pointed at, and said we are sitting right there and she just wants to see if the space would work for her. He said ""no"" i asked can I ask why? He said ""no"" So we moved on and she just decided that she will not be holding her events there. BAD LOSS for them. She hold about 4 parties a month with 200-400 people. We went back to the table and found that our waitress had brought food for half the table and not the other half. I was on the side with food, but we tried to wait and see where the rest was...it came out 20 mins later! Never once was there an apology for this mix up. My group of friends like to have drinks and we probably would have spent more on liquor if our waitress ever came back. We each only got served 2-3 drinks in the 3 hours we were there because the service was horrible. There are so many other things I could go on about, the bouncers were not nice, the hostesses were not pleasant, clearly our waitress was horrible and even security by the bathrooms were not helpful and not paying attention to what was going on. I really loved how much potential this place had! But honestly unless you get your staff together, people are going to stop coming. I know my 14 friends and I all had a bad experience and by the reviews on here clearly others have as well.

2013-05-05,2.0,"Um, where to start...   I guess I'll try the good.  Great location in River North, and definitely lives up to its billing as a sports bar.  The decor is kind of industrial which I like.  They have a ginormous tv on the second floor that is pretty impressive, and it was fun to watch the NCAA basketball championship games (my first visit).  I imagine it will be cool to be up there when they're able to open the roof as well. The not as good: the service.  And by not as good, I mean pretty bad.  The first time I was there it was right after I opened so I thought maybe they just didn't have it together yet.  I was with a group of 10-12, and I know that it can be hard to keep orders straight - but if that's the case, write it down already. Our not-so-bright waitress came back THREE times before bringing my drink order.  To be fair, she admitted she'd forgotten what I'd ordered, but seriously - I ordered a cider.  It's not like I had some sort of crazy mixed drink that I'd never heard of.  She messed up a couple others as well. On my next visit, my colleagues and I went for an early happy hour and the place was still relatively empty.  We decided to order a round of one of their signature drinks, The Sunset.  Well, they took a remarkably long time to make.  We got an excuse about they needed to go in to wherever they store their booze to get one of the items to make it.  And then our server told us that she didn't really think the bartender knew how to make the drink...  Now, on the one hand I appreciate the heads up from the server.  On the other, don't you train your bartenders on how to make your signature drink?  A couple people ordered a second one, and it tasted nothing at all like the first round.   The other thing, and this is a pet peeve, but please stop making your waitresses dress like hookers.  I get that you're a sports bar and you want to hire attractive women to bring in the boys - and the girls here are definitely good looking (however, good looking AND competent would be nice), and that's great.  But you don't need them in tiny black dresses and stilettos - I'm a woman and a sports fan and it's just  really off-putting.",0.9962,0.758,0.199,0.043,0.5206551668286362

My fiancé and I showed up around noon. There were three tables in the restaurant, so you'd assume they would be eager to take care of you. No, not the case.  The hostess at the door clearly had no desire to be there and was very short with us. She tried to push us into a corner to sit. We asked for a booth. She rolled her eyes and said they had reservations for the booths at 4. How long would we be staying? It was noon..,I told her we would be gone in an hour, because I had to work. I was in a suit...she reluctantly sat us. It took over 15 minutes for someone to greet the two of us. The hostess, a busser, and two bartenders at the bar just sat there and looked at us....?!?!

Somehow even though there were 3 hostesses at the front, their group conversation with one of the bouncers was much more important than seating us and at least 2 other parties waiting in front of them. I guess the front desk is their water cooler. Once we sat down, the experience didn't get any better. Our waitress was selectively attentive. She come by ask if we needed anything and when we'd order a drink it would be about 15 minutes before we could enjoy said beverage.  The food was ok, but for how pretentious this place came off, we expected more. Like our drinks, our food took a long time to come out. Again, we ordered before the place filled up. We continued to get these half interested check-ins from our waitress throughout the night. She could have easily milked us for more, but given the service we were turned off.  When the bill came, she had charged us for a glass of wine we hadn't ordered. We brought this to her attention and she claimed that we did have the drink and didn't remove it from our bill.  I can only assume the hostess interaction and overall service are a reflection of management.  At the end of the day, American Junkie gets 1 star for the ambiance and 1 star for playing the in-game sounds instead of music while the game was on.",0.9921,0.85,0.131,0.02,0.5375396825396824

We tried to get a table but were told that in order to sit you have 2 hours to eat and then after that each person at the table has to spend $30 for each additional hour in order to remain at your table!?!?!? WTF is that about? Ridiculous. The bar staff was hit or miss, one bartender was one her game, some of the others not so much.

2013-04-09,2.0,"Went here with another couple to catch the Michigan NCAA Game. The other couple had called Saturday and made a reservation, at which point the hostess informed them that we could only have our table for 3 hours then we either had to get up and drink at the bar or pay $30 / person to continue sitting at the table. As we made the reservation for 7:30 - no issue as the game would likely be over by 10:30 PM. When we arrived Monday night the hostess informed us that we now could only have our table for 2 hours (vs. the 3 they originally told us), and then we'd either have to pay the $30 / person or be booted for other reservations. Annoying that they cut off an entire hour. More annoying that the place - although a sports bar - wasn't remotely crowded and they were still stating this.  The service was terrible - our waitress was extremely slow, didn't really know how to approach the table?, and didn't seem to know the menu (we ordered the cheese platter - which was good, but neither the waitress that brought the food nor our actual waitress could tell us what kind of cheeses were on the plank or what the accompaniments were). The food was pretty good - the menu in general looked like some good options (as long as you're not a vegetarian or have a gluten allergy). Beet Salad was pretty good, flatbread was average. The beer selection is good in the number of options - but what those options are...less impressive. The place is great in terms of decor...plenty of TVs to watch a game, nice atmosphere, upstairs is a retractable roof over a cool lounge area and an impressively large TV.

2013-04-08,2.0,"Tthe ambiance is very cool - thats as positive as this rating will be.  Just another pretentious bar in River North trying too hard to be trendy and exclusive while missing the basics of the restaurant industry - service, service, service, experience.   I came on a Saturday afternoon during their special March Madness hours. The staff was incompetent and ill-trained. When we asked if they served pitchers of mimosas we were given the bottle service menu.  Get real - I'm not spending $300 on a bottle of champagne.  Luckily we found the $33 bottle of Prosecco on the menu that was much more fitting for noon cocktails.  What really brought this review down was a situation handled by management.  When I went to pay my invidual tab (after contributing to my table's $500 tab) the bartender informed me he needed his manager to ""unlock"" my tab.  He assured me it was not a problem with my card he needed to wait for a manager.  So I waited a half hour before I tracked down the manager myself to fix the situation.  He wouldn't even give me an apology for the inconvenience.  Perhaps they should try setting up a decent POS system instead of insisting their staff run tabs off of iPads. If you're interested in being seen and waiting in line then go for it.  If rude managers and poor service piss you off as much as they do me - keep walking.",0.3074,0.817,0.096,0.087,0.4840314711743282

I understand a reservation system and how they work, but the tables sat empty.  For HOURS.  I went up to ask the hostess again around 7:30, and she says with one hell of an attitude ""I quoted you 9:20.  That means 9:20"".  Around 7:45, we left as table that had been empty remained empty.  At that point, we could have eaten, spent several hundred dollars, and left.  I saw a line outside when we left, I can't imagine waiting in line to get into this place.  The only reason it has two stars is that the two apps we ordered while at the bar were pretty decent.  Overpriced, but tasted good.   We never made it upstairs (as the ""line"" started at 5:30), but from what I heard from our friends who were up there, it was worse.  If you would like to be treated poorly at a stereotypical river north bar that caters to the ""beautiful people with money"" crowd, this is your place.  You will probably fit in perfectly with the hostess that can't seem to keep her bottom in her dress.",0.9393,0.79,0.13,0.081,0.5356060606060606
2013-04-08,2.0,"This place is new and has some kinks to work out. It clearly has potential to be a great hangout: cool ambiance, good food, fun crowd, but right now the service is so lacking it ruins the whole experience.  We had a reservation for a table for the Final Four games on Saturday April 6. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time, but once we were seated our waitress seemed completely overwhelmed. Our drinks took a long time to arrive, but given the fact that we were there during the Final Four, I could understand the bar being backed up. My friends ordered the sweet potato fries and beet salad, which I tried and would recommend. I ordered the duck fat chips, which were really tasty and the striploin burger which I never got to taste because after waiting 45 minutes for it to arrive I finally asked our waitress what was taking so long. She told me that she'd ""check on it"" and she wasn't sure what the hold up in the kitchen was. I suspect she forgot to put the order in because when it did arrive over an hour after I originally ordered, it was the wrong burger, the Frieda burger. I was really hungry so I decided that it wasn't worth mentioning that it was the wrong order. The Frieda burger was good and our waitress assured me that my burger would be comped since it took so long. I was happy with the service at the time because I felt she tried to remedy the mistake. The burger ended up on our tab at the end of the night, and the process of coordinating payments with my friends was painfully slow so I didn't bother asking her to remove the charge. I know I probably could have asked for it to be removed, but I was anxious to get going. All these things would have been forgivable mistakes to be expected from a new place still trying to get in their flow, so I don't hold this against them too much. What really bothered me about my experience at American Junkie is what happened as we neared the end of our night. I got up from my chair to use the bathroom and left my purse hanging on the back of my chair. I was not concerned about anyone touching it since several friends were still sitting at the table. When I came back, before I could sit down on my chair I noticed that suddenly my purse was sitting on the table in all the condensation from the drinks! I looked behind me and the hostess was there, removing my chair from the table with some vague comment about needing the chair for another table... um, what? As a customer who hasn't paid my bill yet, why should I give up my chair? If I'd paid my bill and was about to walk out the door, sure, but we were there another 20 or 30 minutes during which I had to stand since the hostess so rudely took my chair. Furthermore, do not move someone's purse unless you have permission to do so. I felt that was flat out rude and I was even more upset that she had placed it directly on top of the water on the table. If she had asked me I would have gladly held my purse and given her the chair, but the way she went about it really upset me. Anyway, bottom line? I'd like to give this place a try in about 6 months when they have the kinks worked out, but I wouldn't step foot back in this place until some serious changes are made.",-0.4495,0.819,0.092,0.089,0.4960457752124418

Got inside and believe me there were some very average looking people and outfits.  They better get out of the business of judging style and start worrying about their quality of customer service if they expect to be successful long term.  Cool looking place on the inside and upstairs but I won't be back.  Oh and $30 min on the credit card or you need to use their $4 fee atm.

2013-04-05,3.0,"4 stars for downstairs, 2 for upstairs..... Downstairs is a nice upscale sports bar.  I could do without the name.  I still don't know why they kept it, yet decided to go with a more upscale theme than their AZ counterpart.  Tons of tv's, I've been here a few times to catch the NCAA games and the food is good, great vibe and the waitstaff seem well organized (even during their soft opening events).  The first time we came here, all 500 TVs had the same Syracuse game on despite 3 other games going on concurrently.  Thankfully the AV system got smoothed out before halftime. As for the Upstairs ""club"" portion, its a nice area and has the potential to do well as the layout looks very familiar to a nearby hotspot on Hubbard that is also the upstairs portion of a restaurant, but I've had an issue the three times I've been up here.  The first was during the opening party, where there was an open bar (aka free alcohol).  After making a reservation for a booth days ahead of time and specifically making sure we didn't have any bottle service minimum since it was a Thursday Happy Hour event, we were seated and get handed a menu and asked for a credit card to hold our tab.  I look at the menu, then ask ""Wait this is an open bar event right?""  Host - ""umm yes but you wanted table reservations right?"" me - ""Well I wanted to reserve a spot to sit at so we could watch the games"" Host - ""Well this is bottle service...."" (this was at 5 pm on a Thursday) Me - ""but there is free alcohol at the bar right?"" Host - ""yes...but if you want bottles that's something completely different"" Me - ""well can we not sit here if we don't order bottles"" Host - ""no you can....we are just talking about two different things I guess"" I might be an idiot, but even I'm not spending $300 a bottle, when I can walk 12 feet and get the exact same drink for free.  He let us be, no harm no foul, just some opening day confusion....but it was definitely annoying that we were being pressed into getting bottle service at an open bar event.  We quickly retreated downstairs after we realized they weren't playing the games on the tv's upstairs as they wanted a club atmosphere (again...this was at 5 pm on a Thursday during the heart of March Madness).   The second time I came here to watch the games, they decided to play the games during the day, but they shut the TVs off upstairs halfway through the second half (when 90% of the people were there to watch the games), started blasting house music (don't get me wrong, I LOVE house) and turned down the lights at 9:30.  You think they could have waited a little longer, or given us notice so we weren't stranded without a place to watch the end of the games (as downstairs was already flooded). Finally, I went here on a normal Saturday to check out the crowd and space.  Granted it was Easter weekend, but it was half empty and by 1 am it seemed like they had let the energy out of this place big time.  Despite putting all this money into the ""largest TV in the midwest"" the DJ booth looks like it was a picnic table on a stage with a lot of bare space.  On top of it all the minimums were pretty outrageous for the experience it ended up being.  Money can be better spent elsewhere... Three strikes and I'm done with this place for now....  I've have consistently had a great time downstairs, its relaxed and fun.  Upstairs feels like they are trying to hard to be the cool kid in the back of the class.  With the retractable roof and the layout, I'm not crossing it off my list, but this place needs to get things ironed out before I head back anytime soon.",0.9977,0.798,0.156,0.046,0.5114313561681985

Goodies... 1) ***THE FOOD*** - Pork-belly Quail Egg and Cabbage Slaw Sliders were leggitter than I could've imagined.   I will be coming back here for these alone.    We also had the smoked chicken nachos.  Above average. Decent beer list amply priced considering what this place is trying to be. Swanky upscale sports club. 2) They really do up the 'sports bar thing' right. They had lots of TVs. and the guy spinning March Madness did a good job. We could see every game. Negatives... Like I said, these didn't really affect me too much, but I would be annoyed with them if I were arriving when instead I was leaving.  1) This place starts to turn club-ish after 9p.  I wish they wouldn't have to do that.  Why can't you just be a swanky sports bar that people like to hang out??  Why add the --club on the end and ruin it by trying to be baller, when instead it's just annoying?? We had dinner hung out for a couple hours and were leaving at around 9.30p.  Then (like others here are saying) the bouncers started CREATING lines at the door for no reason. It wasn't that busy inside.   2) I wanted to see the upstairs.  I heard about the 16ft HD TV they built and wanted to see it.  Nope, not after 9p.  Even though I was already IN downstairs, I couldn't go upstairs without ""being on the list"". Dumb.  I have no time for this.  3) When we first arrived, they were quite obviously understaffed at the bar and it was difficult to drink.  Chalk it up to first week growing pains I'd guess. There's too much $ invested for that to be a problem after week 1. All in, we had a good time, and I'd come back.  Especially if it was an afternoon to watch a game.  I definitely think it'd be fun to go with a group and get one of the side-tables just to chill and watch something...

I took a group of friends here for my birthday last week for what I thought would be a great time with good eats but i was sorely mistaken! If i were to judge  this place solely on atmosphere I would say it's  pretty cool i liked the set up and I think the retractable roof is awesome! However, I find it tough to put into words how awful the food was. We were sat down and greeted by our server who had ZERO people skills she was just as bland and boring as the food we had.   We started with the chicken nachos the chips were stale topped with a weird  tasteless ""boiled"" like pieces of chicken quickly finished with a sloppy  drenching of weird white liquid cheese...How do you mess up chicken nachos! Next we moved onto the entrees.  We ordered an assortment of things from the menu. I had the chicken flat-bread, again topped with the same bland chicken. I don't know what the crust was made with but I ate one piece and never went back for seconds.  I instead looked around the table to see what I could sample from other people's plates but found I was equally as disgusted with theirs as I was with mine.  My gf ordered the lobster roll it is served cold which I do no prefer and was quite small for the $14 price tag that come with it.  My other friends ordered a salad and a hamburger. The one with the hamburger ate it only bc he was hungry but i think it left a lot to be desired.  Apparently the salad was not too bad but nothing to write home about.  I was also, turned off by the presentation of the sandwich items.  Instead of some edible normal side dish it comes with about 6 circle pickles. No fries? chips? something other than just a garnish so essentially it was a small sandwich on a big plate with 6 pickles for $14 dollars..I would much rather go to Hub 51 or Bub City or any other place in River North that actually gives you a meal for the $14 you are spending.

We had a table of 13 people so lots of potential for them to win us over and make some money.  First, the deejay played random songs from the 90s (think Sugar Ray's 'Fly') and the lights were turned up so bright at 10pm - so the ambience was way off. It took our server 30 minutes to bring us our drinks orders...it would take so long in between her visits that our drinks would be completely empty before she returned to take another order. I specifically wanted a baguette with the cheese board so asked if it came with one, our server confirmed it did. When it arrived...it did not. I didnt even complain but was disappointed we spent $20 on a cheese board that was not even what I wanted. When our food came the food runners just yelled out what we had with no direction, no idea what end of the table it belonged. I had one guy pretty much yell at me to move something on the table becuase the food he was holding was hot. My food was cold and not very good at all (asmoked chicken nachos) but to be fair, I think everyone else at the table really liked their food. I ordered a glass of prosecco and it came in a plastic champagne flute and was only filled up halfway. When we asked to speak with a manager it took 20 minutes for him to meet us and then offered some dessert to make up for it. After a 2 hour dinner (and less than 3 drinks per person in 2 hours!) and hoping to bring some energy back to this group - dessert was the last thing we needed.

We saw a bit of a line, which we initially thought was for the lounge upstairs or bar, but no, it was shockingly for anyone, dinner reservation or not.  There were 2 door guys, one of which was at least trying to accomadate people, the other that just kept letting a few 'friends' in, while turning to us, stating how he hates this part of his job....Really? I'm standing outside, for a dinner reservation mind you, freezing. I could care less about this guys professional woes. After 45 minutes waiting outside and just when we were about to leave altogether, we were let in. We checked in with the hostess who was very nice, but was so overwhelmed and basically just told everyone the same thing: it'll be about 30 min.  We had 2 cocktails at the bar, which I agree with the other reviews in that the bartenders were very nice, but geez, I think I asked about 3 different beers and 3 different whiskeys and they had nothing in terms of variety. I state this as the place seems to be having an identity crisis between having a talented chef but being a run of the mill sports bar. After 2 drinks, it was 9:45, so we checked in again with the hostess to see where we stood in her cluster f**k of reservations. She said there were 4 tables of 2 ahead of us. At that point, I just said screw it, as we didn't even want to give hem anymore of our $$. We headed to Rockit for an amazing lobster burger and some much needed nice service. ADVICE TO READERS: good riddins to this Scottsdale import and spend your night at Municipal Bar, Bub City, LP Stadium, Rockit, even the Pony or State for good food, drinks and some appropriate service.",0.879,0.821,0.094,0.085,0.446111111111111
2013-03-23,1.0,"I was intrigued about this place when I read about it's opening earlier this week. Of course I was curious about the retractable roof (and this will probably be awesome in the summer) and the gigantic TV they boast. I was disgusted the moment I walked through the door. Of course on a Friday, during March Madness and a few days after they opened I was expecting it to be pretty busy. However, the place was insane. There's no waiting room and the hostess was a b****.  Lets start with the hostesses, they know nothing and were helpless. Why have four girls trying to look pretty not doing anything? Waste of payroll. We made a reservation for 6:30 and were finally seated at 7 p.m. after the hostess gave us attitude (we waited so that we could watch the basketball game and to at least try the food).  We didn't get to see the roof or TV because they roped off the upstairs to dinning and open bottle service. Really? That leaves just the downstairs with the bar and a few tables for the bulk of patrons. The beer menu is backwards (drafts are bottles and bottles are drafts), oh, and watch the prices. The bartender told me the beer I ordered was actually $10 when the menu stated it was $9. Sorry, you can't just charge what you want when someone orders. (I got my $1 back).  Once we were finally seated our waitress was actually very good and knowledgeable. We did not have to wait long to be served or to get our food. I complement also that they did not mess up our order (for a place that jut recently opened and seem to be unorganized with everything else). The food is good but over priced. We sat near the retractable windows. It was drafty and cold on a 30 deg. day.  Altogether, I give this place a 1 star given the fact their hostess and bartender situation sucks. They need to learn how to treat their company. I also feel the managers need to work to organize the place instead of also trying to walk around and seem important. The atmosphere is pretty fratty but with a more tanned-tight shirt, designer everything type of crowd. Not my type of atmosphere. We will not be returning.",0.9339,0.895,0.075,0.031,0.5808064516129032
2013-03-23,1.0,"Absolutely worst dinning and outing experience I have ever had in my life... I made 815 reservations for dinner on Friday night and for once I was actually there before my reservation, at 810. We got to the front door and they explained that even though we had reservations they could not let us in because they had ""reached capacity"". Usually people get upset if there table isn't ready when they get there, so not only did we have to wait, but we had to wait outside!! In the cold!!! I do not blame the door guys for this instance because they are doing there job, I blame management because they are not doing there job, which is to manage the place and make sure everything goes smoothly and everyone is happy. Management IS HORRIFIC THERE making the experience horrific. Then after 20 minutes, mind you, we are finally let in. We go up to the hostess stand and say, "" hi we have an 815 reservation"" the hostess has the audacity to respond, ""oh we don't hold tables for longer than 15 minutes past a reservation so your table has been given away"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? I was there at 810 the only reason i wasn't inside ready for my reservation was because we were not allowed inside!!!! So now, after waiting outside for 20 minutes, we get inside to find out they have given away our table.  We get a drink at the bar (bartenders were wonderful) and decide to just eat at the bar. 1 hour and half later (not exaggerating) as we are paying our bill at the bar,  the hostess comes up to us and says, oh Alexis your table is  ready for two. Really?... Almost 2.5 hours after our reservation our table is ready. Cool.  With that being said the only good experience was the service from the bartenders. This place is a chain so they are probably holding on to the fact that they don't really have to prove themselves as a new restaurant, but truth be told they are new to Chicago and this place was horrendous!!!  I think this place needs new management 100% and a new outlook on how service should be provided, don't ever ever ever have people who have reservations to eat wait outside.  To top it off, nothing was comped and no one ever apologized to us. The food was alright. Chili cheese fries had a weird spice in them that made them edible, but wouldn't order them again. Sirloin burger was over cooked no pink in the middle at all, when I orders it medium rare. The chocolate bunt cake was beyond dry. Needless to say I WILL NOT EVER GO BACK.",-0.8884,0.845,0.07,0.085,0.5518434343434342
2013-03-23,1.0,"Great chef. Cool looking space.  Great location. Everything else falls short. I had high hopes for what Chef Kendall would bring to the table, and it was pretty good but had a few kinks to work out I think.   I enjoyed the cocktail I had, and the beer list had some good options but I couldn't bring myself to even consider ordering wine which is what I usually drink because the selections were so awful.  I really hope their drink menu is just a work in progress because right now it is not at all appealing.  As far as the rest, the service was horrible and as a paying customer you would think the staff would be nicer and not treat you like they are doing you a favor by taking an order.  Management really needs to educate their staff on what customer service is.  Here's a hint ... don't be a douche to people that are paying you.",0.9676,0.701,0.214,0.085,0.5930952380952381
2013-03-22,5.0,"Very nice upscale bar! Chef Kendall has created a wide variety of phenomenal menu choices! While we tried a variety of menu options with no complaints, my favorites were the lobster Mac and cheese, lobster roll, and the Freida burger (too die for!). The floor plan is open and spacious and will be a treat in the summer with the retractable roof, windows, and garage style doors. Upstairs is a spacious dance floor, a second bar, and the largest tv in the Midwest. How can you go wrong? Staff are kind, courteous, and Very accommodating.

2013-03-22,1.0,"If I could give this place -10 I would.   This place is absolutely awful.  Came here for March Madness, and not even the manager could figure out how to work the tvs.  Every tv in the entire place was on the same game.  Finally some fans told the manager they wanted a certain game on. Well after 20 minutes their game came on... On ALL the tvs.   The bar manager told  me "" this place is so effing unorganized.""   And I totally saw it.  We sat upstairs and our waitress told us the beer menu was mixed up and the bottles were listed as draft and the drafts were listed as bottles.  We proceeded to order some bottles and found out that only some bottles were available upstairs.  The rest were only at the downstairs bar.  Way to have an organized menu.  At least the bar manger admitted no one knew what was going on.  Food was good.  Very very small portions for the price.  We had the pork and kumquat pizza, nachos, bacon wrapped dates, and lobster Mac.  Again, all tasty but not even enough to satisfy the lightest appetite.    Horrible experience.  But I assume with a retractable roof and summer approaching this place with benefit by default. Growing pains perhaps.  Awful awful awful. Take your money somewhere else.",-0.929,0.82,0.068,0.112,0.6365838509316771
2013-03-22,3.0,"I feel like this is going to be a solid place eventually, but they have some things to work out first. For starters the tables were so close together that the waitress could barely get past us without bumping our table. Both waitresses we dealt with were extremely nice and helpful though.  The place was packed and there was a short wait at 10PM. Pretty young and fashionable crowd. Three Blackhawks at the table behind us.  There were a number of things on the menu that really jumped out at me as novel sounding flavor pairings. Unfortunately, in most of the cases there was just one detail keeping it from working.   Dish by dish:  Lobster w/ bone marrow, onion jam, and horseradish- Served in a split bone with sourdough toasts on the side.  Verdict: Tasted fantastic, but they only gave us three small toasts for two people. An even number would make more sense (we requested and got three more). I'd recommend trying it once, but as a $19 appetizer it's not the type of thing I'd rush to try order again.  Foie Gras, Pineapple, Pistachio and balsamic and black pepper syrup Flatbread: Verdict: The foie and pineapple mixed together well, but there was way too much syrup on it and that ended up overpowering everything. We agreed that it was overly sweet and could just as well have been served as a dessert.  Pork Belly, Bourbon, Kumquat, and Bleu Cheese Flatbread:  Verdict: The chunks of pork belly were delicious, the bleu cheese and and bourbon  sauce complemented it beautifully - BUT here again the overly sweet and tangy candied kumquat sprinkled around forced out the other flavors in every bite. I understand the concept of contrasting flavors, but the kumquats simply don't work here. If you're okay with picking the kumquat off it's still worth ordering. Brussel Sprouts with Smoked Pork Jowl and Dates- Verdict: This combination worked very well. The brussel sprouts could stand to be cooked a little bit longer (very firm), but the flavors were solid. Pork Jowl was wonderful.  Cheating Tiger Cocktail- Jim Beam Black, Combier Peach, Tea, Lemon Verdict: Solid drink that tasted just like it sounds - a alcoholic sweet peach tea. I like them stiff and this one didn't skimp.  I know it's really early, so I'd give them another shot down the road. Just have to make some small tweaks before everything comes together.",0.9972,0.774,0.2,0.026,0.4753910181958962
