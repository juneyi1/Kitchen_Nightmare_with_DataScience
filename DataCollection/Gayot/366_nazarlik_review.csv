2008-04-06,3.0,"This place was just alright. Some friends told me to get to this Turkish hole in the wall before it closes. I made it, but not by much as it appears as if they were close to closing. I ordered some mujiver and lahmacum. The mujiver are good sized zucchini fritters and were tasty. The lahmacum is a thinly crusted turkish pizza with minced meat and vegetables. Both items were good, but not great. I had called ahead to order for takeout and when I arrived 15 minutes later, they hadn't started making the food yet. 20 minutes later, I had my order ready, so if you call ahead, wait a little extra time before showing up.",0.8426,0.846,0.118,0.036,0.41
2008-03-07,5.0,"Often I only give 5 stars to those places which remain outstanding...however, this exceeded my expectations.  The outside looks like a ""hole in the wall"" hot dog stand, but inside you're surrounded with quirky hand sewn purses, pixelized pictures of Turkey and childish, hand-painted paintings.  I came across the little family-owned Turkish joint in TimeOut's 100 Best article and tried what they mentioned as a Turkish ""thin pizza"" called Lahmacun.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! The price is low at $4.25 for a 8 inch ""pita"" covered with lots of garlic, ground beef and a variety of vegetables.  We also had the lentil soup which was yummy, especially with the accompanying lemon slice, a pinch of salt, hot sauce (not necessary) and pita.  Lastly, the Shepherds Salad was also extremely fresh cut, healthy and tasty with the oil/sauc. Everything was VERY delicious, made right then and there, cheap and healthy (especially for it being what I would consider ""fast food"")!  The daughter will most likely do the waitressing and runs the cash register, while the mother cooks in the kitchen.  Most importantly, you feel comfortable and happy inside.  RECOMMENDED TO TRY!  Yet, BEWARE, the name means Evil Eye...it's a big deal in Turkey! ;0",0.9886,0.714,0.208,0.078,0.682840722495895
2008-01-30,2.0,"I ordered the chicken kebab dinner, which wasn't bad, but not at all my cup of tea.  The chicken was juicy, but it had almost no flavor.  Very, very bland, and the red pepper oil just added sheer heat--kind of unpleasant.  I guess for four or five bucks it wouldn't be a bad deal, but for $10, I felt ripped off.",-0.2048,0.813,0.087,0.1,0.7416666666666667
2008-01-28,3.0,"I am a big fan of family owned restaurants. Honestly, I prefer them to chain restaurants, and I try to go and support them.  Also, I travel for food, so even though this is far away from where I live, I made a point to go try it.   Let's start with the good points: 1. Family owned.     Side note, the Dad used to be a fashion designer and master tailor in         Turkey! 2.  The daughters are very very nice. 3.  Everything there is DEFINITELY homemade. 4.  The food was good.      (We got the Turkish pizza, which were really thin, light, covered with ground lamb, and tons of spices  We also got an order of the chickek kebabs, they were very juicy and well seasoned.) The bad: ummm....only one. But wait, I need to preface this with the fact that I have an iron stomach. No joke, I can eat ANYTHING and it really has no effect on my tummy. None.  Seriously, I can eat days old pizza, I can eat suspect lunchmeat, yogurt, cheese, chili, and any kind of leftovers. It's kind of gross, but I do it and it doesn't cause me any problems. Nazarlik's pizza caused me some problems. That's all I can say before someone flags this review as being too inappropriate. LOL.",0.5171,0.82,0.1,0.08,0.5766666666666665
2007-09-27,2.0,"I ordered the kebob dinner and found it to be overpriced for what you get.  It was basically 6-7 bites of kebob chicken meat over a bed of plain white steamed rice, with a piece of pita bread, and a tiny lettuce salad.  I would normally expect to pay about $5-$7 for that meal.  However that meal came to over $10 with tax.   If you ordered the sandwhich kebob it appeared to be a better deal as you got the meat, pita bread, but also a full size salad of your choice for the same price.  I might try it again because I live nearby and I would like to try the hummus, pizza and cheese/potato pies and the food seems decent enough.  But I cannot recommend the kebob dinners by any means considering the price they cost.",-0.2651,0.9,0.039,0.061,0.48170995670995675
2007-09-24,4.0,"This was such a cute Mom & Pop place to grab a bite.  I would highly recommend the cheese & potato pies.  For around $3 it was a steal!  The Turkish pizza was pretty good too, but I would order the pies if I went back.",0.6296,0.761,0.19,0.048,0.6066666666666667
2007-08-31,4.0,"I am a definite fan. In a neighborhood with at least two other Turkish restaurants, this family-operation is brave, and their courage is worth it for us eaters. Plenty of tasty food for an inexpensive price, though as they move along, I'm sure their vegetarian options will expand (my only complaint). Definitely a great place to go.",0.9694,0.644,0.356,0.0,0.579320987654321
2007-08-22,5.0,"I am utterly taken with Nazarlik.  You can go to Turkey--I did--and not eat Turkish food this good. So strong is my love of Nazarlik's lahmacuns (Turkish ""pizza"") that I have been there every weekend since it opened:  the flatbread is rolled out and baked to toasty perfection when you order, and topped with a smoky mix of minced lamb, spices, and veg.  The salads (I like the village salad most) are fresh and crisp, making a perfect counterpoint.  You should also try the gozleme (spinach-cheese pie) and lamb shish kebabs, which are excellent.  Regional Turkish food like this isn't ""spicy,"" but you can turn up the heat if you'd like by adding red pepper flakes, and I suspect that if you asked Secil, they'd be happy to make any dish spicier when you ordered. Nazarlik is very much a family-run business:  Mom and Dad do the cooking, making everything fresh as you order it, daughter Secil serves and manages the counter, and 5-year-old Volkan entertains himself and customers.   The space isn't anything notable--if anything, it's a little bleak--but who cares when you can walk in and have an amazing meal of made-from-scratch Turkish goodness for less than $10? P.S.  I hear that they'll soon be offering delivery.  That will kill a bit of the just-homemade taste, but for the lazy lahmacun lover (like me), what bliss!",0.9922,0.735,0.218,0.047,0.622156862745098
2007-08-15,3.0,"Real small family owned place that serves authentic Turkish food.  They have a big open oven that they use to make their flat breads.  Everything looks and tastes fresh and service can take a while when there are more than a few people here.  They do have a fairly limited menu, but the family that runs the place is super friendly.  The food is good, but I was expecting a bit more spice.  The lamb shish kabob was really tender and tasty, but the bread was a bit too chewy for my taste.  Prices are low and you can get a ton of food here for about $10.",0.9194,0.83,0.134,0.036,0.40563492063492057
2007-08-10,5.0,"yea, i heard about this joint in the Food Chain blog in the Reader... i am pretty frickin glad i did. this place is sweet. staff was very friendly and i think they were all related. friendly staff is always a bonus for me. holy crap the food was good. pretty much everything there is homemade and you can tell... it just all tasted fresh. i went with my roommate and we go a few things to split and try as much as we could.  we got an app of ""Hummus chickpea favorite served with homemade pita bread 4.99""... big plate of silky smooth hummus and a large basket of that homemade pita. the hummus would have been awesome by itself but they add this kind of red peppery oil on top that kicked it up a bit. it went so well with the hummus i was scraping the hummus plate with all my pther food to get every last bit.  then came the Lamb Shish Kebab Served w/ Onion Salad 5.95... again, just awesome. it was my roommates favorite. you could tell the meat was quality and was seasoned perfectly and the wrap was a fair size for the price. good stuff.  next came the Lahmacun served w/ baba ghanoush 3.45... like the review below says its kind of like a thin crispy pizza. the dough is all hand stretched and came fresh out tha oven. definitely worth the price. along with the Lahmacun came our order of Gozleme (with chicken, potato & cheese) pie 3.15. they also have a spinach and cheese one, and judging by the taste of the one we had, i definitely will be trying it down the road. it was a melty and delicious and stuffed in a thicker pita pocket. sooo good... they also had some hot sauce on the table that i think was homemade... either way it kicked arse.  i finished it off with a piece of the baklava that they have that was not the typical looking one (i believe the name of it means ""around and back"", or something to that effect because it is made in a ring shape). it was total awesomeness. not too sweet, the right amount of chewy, i would get again for sure. i thought i was ordering 1 piece, instead i got 3 big pieces... worked for me. so yea, i am definitely going back to try everything else on the menu... know that there are only 3 (maybe 4) tables there so it could be crowded if word gets out on this joint....",0.9975,0.785,0.192,0.023,0.5648770619358855
