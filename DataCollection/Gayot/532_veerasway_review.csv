2017-08-14,1.0,"The Grange Hall Burger Bar was our second choice for Saturday night dinner. We had anticipated eating at Au Cheval, but refused to wait 2.5 hours for a table. I came across this place on yelp. It had decent ratings and the farm to table caught my eye. Upon entering this cute establishment, we were greeted by a sweet, friendly hostess...little dude elbow this would be the highlight of our experience. She led us to our table and waited more than 8 minutes for our server to make an appearance. First off, our server never introduced himself nor did he make any recommendations. My husband ordered their monthly special burger and I decided on the three cheese burger. I asked for it well done because although I like beef, I don't like any sight of pink let alone blood!  We also ordered a basket of criss cut fries. Hubby liked his massive burger. I, on the other hand, was flabbergasted after taking the first bite because all I tasted was burnt bread. After inspecting my bottom bun I noticed it was totally charred! I immediately told my server and in an unapologetic, monotone he said he'd take it and bring out a new one. While I waited for my burger, I ate some of the fries. I was so disappointed by these too. They were lukewarm, and borderline stale. After an eternity, my remade burger arrived. I was once again shocked to see blood drops all over my bun and the meat was cooked medium-medium well. At this point my appetite instantly vanished! My server never returned to check in. And since I was over my dinner I flagged him down, paid for my check, and bailed out!  Shame on you Grange Burger Bar!",0.9744,0.801,0.135,0.064,0.5619931457431457

The burger was good, but the price was not. If you like paying $15 for your burger and NOT having the fries included, then you will adore this place. 4 burgers, two waffle fries, two sodas, and two beers = $100 with a 20% tip all in.

2017-08-12,3.0,"I waited a week to post my review because I wanted to be fair and not let one experience tarnish my overall impression of the restaurant.  Grange Hall was my pick to go with a few co-workers on my last day of working with them.  This was my first time, but it seemed to offer nice food/drink selections that the majority of my group would enjoy.  My boss made reservations earlier that week, so we were all set.  We were seated right away, and our server greeted us in a friendly manner. Once we  let her know that our group had dwindled down to 5, she asked if we minded freeing up a table for other patrons.  No worries! It was a completely understandable request and we quickly accommodated.  Per my server's recommendation, I ordered the Berries and Brie burger. Great choice! Especially for someone like myself who likes to try different things. The combination of the sweet and savory was awesome.  The fries were good too. Our group was having a great time laughing and joking (normal group behavior) and Our server was attentive throughout.  We deliberated on the dessert menu for a little bit,  but realized we were just too full.  I saw a few yummy looking desserts going to other tables and secretly decided that I would be back. My co-workers picked up the tab, and we continued to chat and finish our drinks.   That's when things started to unravel.  Our server, who had previously been great, started acting strangely.  She kept stopping by to ask if we were ordering anything else, which wasn't strange in and of itself, but it was the frequency that she was doing it and her body language/vocal tone. She went as far as telling us that she needs our tables and would appreciate it if we could hurry up.  She started snatching napkins, and other items off the table. When we expressed that some of us still hadn't finished our drinks, she walked off in a huff. The next time she passed by, she actually picked up my coworker's beer can and shook it to see if anything was in it (which there was). Who does that? My celebratory feeling was starting to wear off due to her bizarre behavior, so I pulled her aside to point out that she was making us uncomfortable.  In particular, she was bringing my mood down with her rude behavior.  She yelled, ""Well, you made it pretty obvious that you weren't pleased with my service by the tip that you left!"" I reminded her that my co-workers were treating me to dinner and regardless of her feelings on the tip they left, she should still maintain her professionalism.  After all, that night was supposed to be about me.  At that time, she gave me an insincere apology and angrily told me she was going to walk away now.  I was so outdone. I told her that up until  a few moments ago I was actually considering coming back with more people because I enjoyed myself so much. However, with how she was treating us, I was not inclined to ever come back.  She then mustered up a more believable apology and said that she was being put under pressure to free up our 2 tables.  Assuming our server was just having an off day, I have decided not to mention her name.  Unbeknownst to me, my boss went to track down the manager on duty, Sarah. I am purposely mentioning her name for a few reasons--I want to publicly thank her for her handling herself in a professional manner; I want to hold her accountable to address our server as she said she would; lastly, while Sarah told us that Grange Hall never rushes patrons out of the restaurant, I want her to realize that somebody else may have encouraged our server to do so that evening.  Perhaps all staff are not aware of the restaurant's policy not to rush folks out the door? There are too many great restaurants in the neighborhood to have to put up with rude customer service.  Please make sure that other patrons don't experience what my group experienced, because it ruined what was otherwise a nice dinner.",0.9976,0.79,0.153,0.056,0.45810274560274566

I ordered the Ultimate burger and and house rosemary ""fries"" (or should I say bite size potato pieces). The burger overall was great, but I think it could be better. For starters, the horseradish aioli sauce was hands down the best part of this massive burger beauty. Second place would have to go to the grass fed beef patty which was incredibly tender and savory. Then everything else tied for third place, the applewood smoked bacon, muenster(cheese), caramalized onions, arugula (lettuce thing) were fantastic (especially the bacon of course). For the side I mentioned earlier:which I honestly now think I DID NOT NEED considering the size of the burger, I overall thought it was decent. I did not like nor did I expect the ""fries"" to be in a chunky form instead of a nicely cut rectangular prism form like I'm used to. However, when I bit into one of them, I was happy to see that it tasted like an upgraded version of any other fry that I've eaten in other places. The spices used to to make the ""fires"" were amazing. To end this sincere review, I'll mention an important suggestion for the ultimate burger's recipe; ADD SOME MORE GREENS AND TOMATO!!! (Lettuce, spinach, kale etc.) so that the savory flavor of the patty doesn't become to much to bare; sometimes you can have to much of a good thing you know; especially when there is no more of that yummy sauce on the burger to balance out the savory (umami) flavor of the burger.",0.9942,0.781,0.17,0.049,0.5921146953405019

Surprisingly it was easy to get into especially considering the nice weather, and it being a Friday. I just assume every place in this area will have a wait when those two factors are involved. It was construction close to it so maybe that was one of the reasons? Either way it was great walking to this place and being seated right away. I ordered the BBQ Picnic Burger and I was more than pleased. If you're not sure what burger to grab I would say put this at the top of your list. The BBQ sauce is really good and didn't taste like generic; it was almost like it was whipped up from scratch in the back.  It also comes with slaw, which I'm. It a fan of at all, but it didn't taste bad and really worked on this burger. The fries were hit and crispy but you can probably split an order or the fries that come with a sandwich; it was so many. The drink menu is pretty legit, but I didn't get anything too fancy, but I would definitely consider on my next visit. It can get a little tight because this place isn't THAT big, but it's not a deal breaker.

2017-06-30,4.0,"I've had this place on bookmark for ages and somehow we just never got around to coming here. I'm so happy we finally did. I was a bit surprised, because the place wasn't that full - although it was like 9pm on a Wednesday. I assume it's busier otherwise. We first sat outside, which was beautiful - but then it started raining and so I was elated that there were plenty of open tables inside, because we were able to rush in. Starting off with the appetizers... the waiter recommended the fried veggies. We didn't really like these. They were deep fried very oily. I mean, usually you can fry anything and it tastes good, but I'd pass on this one next time around. Everything after this was excellent. This place has one of the best veggie burger options you're going to find. And not only that... they have more than one! If I remember correctly, there are 3 different vegetarian burger options and you can substitute those veggie patties onto any of the burgers on the menu. I had the three-cheese burger with regular veggie burger pattie, and it was great. Well, I've only been here once so far, so I can't speak for all of them, but the regular veggie burger was awesome. It's kind of like fried, which is more along the lines of the fried these of everything here, so that's probably not the healthiest thing, BUT it does mean that the pattie stays together. A lot of places you go, the pattie falls apart, because they don't have a proper binding agent. Definitely not the case here. And it tasted great too. I also got this fried avocado, which was one of the ingredients from another burger added to mine. That was delicious too. They did charge me extra for it. Lastly, the fries. They took a LONG time to come, but they were awesome. We got the Parmesan waffle fries and they were super-flavor packed. Loved them. I was mostly eating them plain without ketchup - because they had enough flavor on their own. I think they must've had some garlic on 'em too. If there were a couple of things to bring up, I think I'd mention that the service was a bit off. Our waiter was very nice and all, so no complaints there. When we got the burger, we didn't get the fries for probably 5-10 minutes later. I was probably half-way done with the burger by then. Also the other side we ordered came sometimes in-between then. So it just seemed kind of uncoordinated. Especially with the place not being very busy, I wasn't sure why something like that would happen.

2017-05-19,4.0,"Ate here last night with a friend on a whim. Was a pretty descent place to grab a bite to eat, but background noise and space infringed a bit. ***AMBIANCE & ENVIRONMENT***: West loop parking--to quote ""The Stranger"" à la Lebowski: ""sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes the bear eats you""--we took a chance and passed on overprice valet. We parked three blocks from the restaurant--our choice, but it does affect the rating for accessibility. The decor was pleasing to look at--it had sort of a barn-bar feel to it, with complimenting large barn door that opened to a patio area--the weather had dropped so we opted for indoor dining. Unfortunately, without reservations, we had a ~45 minute wait time. We opted for the bar which was tightly packed with limited elbow room--I ended up sitting sideways after awkwardly standing next to my friend drinking my two-fingers of Bulleit bourbon--I'll touch on that more in a bit. Aside from this, because of the barn-style structure, the acoustics were horribly loud within the dining hall--this was made worse by the large group of birthday well wishers at a table behind us--side note, the bartender cracked me up with a snide remark after one of their many loud outbursts. Once our names were called, it was similarly tightly quartered--there was a couple next time us and we could hear their unfolding conversation of a first date...AWKWARD...beautiful to behold, annoying with the sound level and poor seating.--2 of 5 stars. ***FOOD/BEER*** At the end of the day remember, this is a burger joint. We did try an app: the fried veggies (sorry arteries, fooled you!) They came out piping hot, accompanied by a nice tartery-sauce. I ended up ordering the the ""Ultimate"" with an additional cooked egg on top. He got the ""BBQ Picnic"" but sub'd the beef patty for a turkey patty instead. Our burgers were both tasty as hell. As far as libations--I stuck with the Bulleit Rye bourbon--just took it neat. My friend had a Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Laguanitas and tried his hand a cocktail--the ""Great Big 'Dill'"" (I love puns). His cocktail was pretty refreshing! As far as the beer and bourbon, I think that's left into the eye (or rather tongue) of the beholder--choose your own poison. One random side note--when we asked for water, it was given with no ice--thought it was odd to have to get a separate glass for just ice--I know...maybe a little petty, but it was odd. 4 of 5 stars. ***SERVICE***: Service was excellent--again our bartender was Johnny-on-the-Spot with our beverages and our waitress (I think her name was June--I couldn't quite catch her name because of the ongoing cacophony taking place) was welcoming and dutiful with checking in to see our needs were met. The hostesses were also welcoming, no complaints in the service department, bravo~ 5 of 5 stars. In summary, it was a good evening with some good refreshments and conversation (from what I could hear!). Perhaps this might not be an ideal place for an intimate dinner like the lovers that sat next to us, but if you're looking for a good place with some decent burgers and tasty beverages to imbibe in with your mates, this will fit the bill--just be sure to make a reservation ahead!

2017-01-25,1.0,"So I stopped in for a bite before heading over to City Winery for a show. The reviews are good and I like burgers. Sounded like a plan.  Upon entering Grange Hall Burger Bar, hereafter referred to as ""GH"", I noticed that the decor was somewhat ""farmy""/""country"". The place resembles a barn. The bar is on the left/west and the dining area is on the right/east. It's actually a nice concept. Our party had reservations and we were promptly seated. So far so good. I ordered a Two Brothers Domaine Dupage and the others in my party ordered their drinks. We put in an order of spicy fries/fire fries/buffalo fries...whatever. My waitress returned and informed me that they were out of the Dupage. Okay. Not happy. I ordered a different beer. She then came back and told me that they were out of that beer as well. Not at this point I'm numb because I'm in a bar and these brews are featured on their menu. The waitress then recommended a ""Hibernation""-something beer which was 8.9% alcohol. Miss, just because I ordered two craft beers doesn't mean that any other craft beer on the menu is similar. Plus I really don't need to be pounding 8.9% ABV at 7:00 PM. Out of frustration I ordered a PBR in a can - no glass. I thought that they couldn't possibly out of that. They weren't.  She then returned with the appetizer. The fries were of the waffle variety. They were covered with some sort of seasoning, a hot sauce, and chopped up celery. Meh. I ate them but they were far from memorable and certainly nothing I would bother to tell anyone about or order again. [It should be noted that at this point a young couple came in and were seated next to our table. The gentleman ordered a Domaine Dupage and also learned that it was not available. He then ordered a PBR. Great minds think alike. Thank you.] Another round of drinks came as did the entrees. One person ordered a chicken sandwich and liked it. Everyone else ordered burgers. I ordered a triple cheeseburger, medium well. The burger was cooked properly. I appreciated that. The cheese was colorful and tasted fine. Very good. The burger was thin. When you are charging in excess of ten dollars for a burger it should be a solid 1/2 pound. I don't care if the cow got daily manicures and was fed Kentucky bluegrass. For the record, the burger was closer to $14. It tasted fine but was nothing special. I've had better burgers at chain restaurants such as Meatheads and Five Guys. Our party also ordered some fried pickles. They were good but again, nothing to write home about. I also had to hound the waitress for ketchup and mustard because the bottles on the table were empty. That's a no-no in the restaurant trade. At close you set up for the next day and make sure the condiments, salt, pepper, etc. are all set. No excuse for this. Then again, there's no excuse for not having your featured brews in stock. [The young couple left without eating. They made the right call.] I also wanted to add that during the entire visit GH was piping in some of the worst music ever recorded: 70s Disco and Soul. Not just one or two ""dusties"" but a whole bunch of it. Ehh. So the check came and with a 20% tip the bill came out to be about $200. Really, some drinks, some basic burgers, fries...$200?

The onion rings are outstanding...beer battered and cooked just right. Nice selection of beers both on tap and in bottles/cans. Some that you don't normally see in Chicago. Being raised there, I like that Grange Hall has a bit of a Michigan flare. They carry Michigan Hard Ciders (the flavors change with the seasons) which you can also purchase by the gallon, and some very good Western Michigan beers. A neat thing is the ""floats"" they serve. Beer and booze floats. Unique. House made lemonade and cranberry juice as well. For me, the fact that they have Vernor's ginger ale was over the top. They'll make a Boston Cooler with it...you gotta be from Michigan to know what that is. Yummy.",0.9765,0.826,0.155,0.019,0.6097513227513228

Same situation both times: woke up late on a Sunday, wanted brunch, realized most brunch places in the area are about to stop serving brunch because it's 2pm, see that Grange Hall has a brunch menu and are open till 4, get there and decide to get burgers instead. Atmosphere is cozy and casual. They have some fun drinks with an emphasis on bourbon. I really enjoyed the hot buttered rum. Fresh whipped cream on top! Because I really enjoy my burgers with raw onion on them, I've ordered the three cheese burger both times. It's good. The meat tastes really fresh, and I wouldn't be surprised if they ground it in-house. They come a la carte. My boyfriend got the sage fried chicken sandwich last time and I thought it was really good. The breading was super crunchy and the chicken was moist.  I wish they noted on the menu what kind of fries they're using for each fry dish (and there are a few). The first time I came here, the poutine (very good) came to my surprise with waffle fries, but on my next visit the buffalo fries were more like small wedges. I care about the cut of potato I'm going to eat! They are not created equal.  The staff is really nice. Very warm service.",0.9796,0.809,0.159,0.032,0.5590281224152192

I went with the frittata.  SOoooooo....definition of a frittata to me is similar to a quiche minus the crust.  I was expecting the spinach goat cheese and tomotoes to be baked into the egg but instead I got a omlette with steamed spinach on top and a few tomatoes and some cheese for show.  I was very disappointed that it wasn't a hearty warm frittata.  I could have made a simple 2 egg omlette at home and definitely saved $14!! Overall the bloody mary jane was decent and service was prompt.  Our wait was non existence since it was obvious people were stopping here for brunch unless the line at Au Chevel was unbearable.

2016-07-25,3.0,"3.5 stars I originally wanted to go to Au Cheval for a burger but the host there said it would be a 2.5 hour wait and after waiting we would most not likely receive food because the kitchen closes at 3:00 pm.  So disappointed that I couldn't check out their burgers, I searched for another burger joint.  I found this place on Yelp and luckily it was right down the street. Fingers crossed hopefully this place doesn't have such a long wait. The tables would be a 45 minute wait but the bar was open. Bar it is! Food: Ultimate ($14.00)-Grassfed beef, cheese, bacon, arugala, onions and horseradish aioli.  Very good and juicy with nice toppings to balance out the flavors but I had asked for medium rare but came out medium.  Patty Melt ($13.00)-Grassfed beef, cheese, onions and thousand island. Good but not great.   Waffle Fries ($3.75) Overall, it was good but a bit pricey for what you get.

Arrived for a last minute reservation at Grange Hall today after the recommendation from an acquaintance and was instantly impressed. Greeting from the host stand was great, ambience was fun and even the bathrooms were cute, clean, and well lit.  For drinks we had a beer that was recommended and a house margarita. The margarita was the best I've had in Chicago so far, very refreshing and definitely not from a mix, also loved the slice of lemon and cucumber in it.  Burger-wise we tried the Ultimate Burger (bacon, horseradish aioli, caramelized onions, and Munster cheese) and the Berry and Brie Burger (berry compote with lots of while berries in it and a nice slab of brie). Both burgers were outstanding, juicy without being greasy, and had the perfect combination of toppings to be balanced. Going again, I could easily order either of these burgers but if I'm in the mood for a solid burger experience then I'm definitely getting the Ultimate! We also tried their new garlic parmesan waffle fries. AMAZING! So often I feel like garlic parmesan fries under deliver at places but these fries were perfection. They had a wonderful crisp to the outside and you could actually taste and smell the  garlic parmesan topping! Get these!!!! We didn't have room for dessert but pies looked nice.",0.9956,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.6868967452300787
2016-07-19,4.0,"Been to GHBB several times and have never left disappointed. First time my girlfriend and I walked in and it was a bit crowded but we were able to take a seat at the bar near the kitchen window. Bartender doubled as our waiter and was very friendly / attentive. Even dropped a line about GoT when he overheard us discussing the L + R = J theory. We weren't terribly hungry but split the BBQ Picnic (medium) and a side of fries with a few dipping sauces. Food came out pretty quickly, burger cooked perfectly and fries twice baked large potato slices. Toppings on the burger included a jalapeño jicama slaw and a fried avocado (usually considered sac-relig.). Fried avocado was crispy and added a creamy element to the burger but the topping feels more like a showpiece than a true flavor additive. Fries are everything you want from potato wedges with fry like texture. Crispy, long cut salty goodness. Also ordered some special summer cocktails which were good but I can't remember what they were. Since that first experience I've been back 3-4 times and tried various burgers, sides, and of course adult beverages. Patty melt and onion rings are noteworthy - not implying everything else is subpar, it's just the way chips stack up on my table. Only thing I'm curious about is why I'm always handed a postcard ""From the Grange's"" asking me how the food and service was. Are they still unsure at this point? It's been good, borderline great each time I've gone but still the need for validation is curious.

First- it is not very often that you have such a delicious house made veggie patty option (mostly a boca patty if I'm lucky) but they actually have 2 veggie options to choose from!  Seriously, one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. The panko breading gave it a great crunch and layers of flavor from the carmelized onions and relish.  And the waffle fries were delicious as well. Seasoned nicely with a spicy thousand island dipping sauce. And excellent service from Seth. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back.  Pricing is comparable to other places in the area and totally worth every penny.  Sadly, I had to go back to work or I would've tried the Michigan tart cherry margarita.  Oh and some pie.

For the pancake, neither the blueberries or basil were very strong, seemed like regular batter with things added while cooking, not something I cared for.",0.9852,0.723,0.234,0.043,0.48968031968031966

2016-03-15,3.0,"I really wanted to give a four star review, but I had too many issues with our experience.  We came in on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be about 40 minutes.  (My boyfriend thought she said 20, but I thought I heard 40, so I'm giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt on this one).  There isn't really room to wait inside, so we decided to walk around the neighborhood.  We came back to check to see where we were on the list and were told it would be longer still.  After walking around even more, we decided to stay at the restaurant and hoped that we would be seated shortly.  As we were standing inside and waiting, we witnessed a couple of people enter who must have known someone who works here.  We watched a worker basically push a couple out of their seats at the bar so these new people could have their seats.  One of them was in the woman's seat before she could even put on her coat and grab her purse.  I thought it was pretty rude of the worker to be so pushy ushering them out.  Our overall wait time was an hour.  We each ordered a cocktail, which were good and reasonably priced.  It took a long time for our server to come back and take our food order.  Once she finally took our order, our food arrived at the table very quickly.  I took a bite into mine and realized that it was not cooked medium well like I had asked, but more like medium rare.  My boyfriends was more of a rare than the medium he requested.  No wonder our food was ready so fast.  Our server never came back to the table, so my options were sit there and starve or eat my under cooked burger and hope for the best.  I chose the latter as I was really hungry from having to wait so long.  Thankfully, I was able to eat it, but I'm disappointed our food wasn't how we requested.  I ordered the berries and brie burger and thought the berries added an interested component to the burger.  We finished our meal with a scoop of red velvet ice cream.  They also have pie for dessert.  I'm not sure if I would return as I've read several reviews that had similar problems with their experiences.  It's one thing to have an off night, but to repeatedly have the same complaints is when it becomes a real problem that needs to be addressed.",0.9195,0.818,0.103,0.079,0.4275953984287318

2016-02-08,5.0,"There's this trend in burgers lately of having 2 greasy patties instead of one thick one. Probably created by some almost-vegan who can't be reminded that their food was once a cow. Or a germaphobe who thinks the red in a burger is a sure sign of of getting sick. Or a person who's height of burger perfection is Shake Shack or Five Guys or Au Cheval.  Yes. Au Cheval is good but overrated. I actually think their menu aside from their burger is great. However, I fear for the tourist that waits in line for 2 hours since they read in some magazine that the best burger in the country is in Chicago and that it is made from thin Sysco patties and a kraft single ( chicago.eater.com/2015/4… ). Said tourist will go home feeling disappointed and questioning the palette of the Chicago foodie. Can the city that regularly puts an Italian sausage and Italian beef in the same sandwich be afraid of a juicy (not greasy) burger? I say no. There are plenty of excellent burger joints in this city and Grange Hall is one of them. Thick 1/2 lb patty of 100% grass-fed beef. Quality ingredients. Perfectly cooked (if you get red meat cooked at anything more than medium, you're doing it wrong). Amazing combinations from their chef's or create your own. Add a craft beer or cocktail and some pie. This is how Chicago did burgers before the ""thin patty"" trend. This is how it will do it after that fad leaves.

They have one of my favorite veggie burgers of all time. And I've eaten a lot of veggie burgers. We take friends here a lot, and it's always a huge hit so I feel pretty confident saying the regular burgers are great too. My husband actually thinks they make a better burger than Au Cheval down the street (a controversial opinion, I know).

I'm actually really surprised it only has 4 stars. And I particularly don't understand complaints about the price. For the quality of the food, I don't think the price is at all unreasonable. I think people just get hung up on the fact that it's a burger. Yes, it's more expensive than a fast food burger or a burger at a chain restaurant. But it's tastier and made with better ingredients.

2015-11-16,2.0,"We went to Grange Hall Burger Bar for lunch on a Saturday and had a decent time. Décor: This place is a smaller hipster spot that has a handful of tables (and some outside when the weather is nice) and a decent-sized bar. Now, when I say hipster I certainly mean it: everything from the tableware to the decorations, to the bathroom is in full-on hipster mode. But it's cool, we rather enjoyed it. It isn't overly bright in there but you should have no problem seeing what you're eating. Bathroom: The décor does not stop in the bathroom but the large stone sink is cool! Semi-well lit, clean, gets the job done. Staff: Our hostess and waiter were both very nice. The one issue I had, and this is not unique to this place as I've had it happen several other times at different spots, is waiter attention to detail. Example: I ordered a burger that came w/ onions (stated on the menu) and requested ""no onions."" I also ordered a Turkey Chili (accoutrements of which are not stated on the menu) and, upon delivery, discovered a generous portion of diced onions on top... Now, I could have sent it back but I am not a fan of doing that, so I ate around them the best I could. My point is this: the waiter, upon hearing ""no onions"" on my burger should have asked if I also wanted my chili ""no onions"" as well. Like I said, waiter attention to detail. Food: We arrived ready to have lunch and were sad to discover that the lunch menu does not start until 1p... sigh. But they still had burgers on their breakfast/brunch menu so we were not totally out of luck. We each had a burger (plain cheeseburger and The Ultimate) with a side of Rosemary Potatoes and I had a cup of Turkey Chili. The burgers and the potatoes were very tasty and the Turkey Chili was just so-so (it was kind of watery). We also had just water to drink. Value: The prices here, overall, are a bit lofty. I understand that the burgers are grass-fed but $13 for a burger is a bit much. And the prices really do not make any sense either: my Ultimate (that came w/ bacon and sauce) was $14 while her plain cheeseburger was $13. Only a $1 up charge for bacon? That's awesome!, but I feel like what it really means is that we were over-charged for the regular cheeseburger... Also, the side of Rosemary Potatoes is pretty small for the price, same for the chili. Your dollar does not go very far here at all. I had high hopes for Grange Hall Burger Bar but ultimately left feeling disappointed and overcharged.

Don't forget to order the fries as they are amazing - thin sliced Russet potatoes that are crunchy - so good! Best part: they are truly gluten free as they are fried in a dedicated fryer.  Drinks: Tons of options including cocktails, craft beers, wines, and ciders (naturally gluten free). If you have room, they even have gluten free sorbet & chocolate pudding for a sweet post dinner treat.  Finally a place that offers gluten free options not just to cash in, but they do it right and understand cross-contamination, etc. (apparently the owner has Celiac disease).

The burger was juicy with saltiness from the bacon, sweetness from the onions, a little heat from the aioli, and additional richness with the fried egg. Also ordered were the Thankful turkey burger, the corned beef sandwich, and one beef burger without cheese. For sides, we had a basket of hand cut french fries, mac 'n cheese, and a basket of beer battered onion rings. The batter on the onion rings was the right consistency, not too crispy but not soggy. I was able to get about one bite of the mac 'n cheese which was devoured by everyone else. Everyone enjoyed their sandwiches, especially my daughter who went out of her normal comfort zone and ordered and finished a corned beef sandwich. For dessert, we all split a piece of house made pumpkin pie with hand whipped cream. The grass fed beef, free range turkey, and locally sourced fruits and vegetables will elevate the price, but well worth it to me. Grange is a solid option for burgers made with quality ingredients and without the extended wait time.",0.9858,0.861,0.134,0.005,0.5425324675324675
2015-11-01,4.0,"My friend's original plan (from about a month ago) was eating at one of the most well known burger joint in Chicago called Au Cheval, but he immediately backed down and told me to look somewhere else the moment he heard the wait for Au Cheval was approximately 2 ~ 2.5 hours. The result of my last minute and emergency (seeing my friend was starving to death again - hey who knows what he will do during that ""extreme"" hunger state) Yelp search was Grange Hall Burger Bar, locating just 1 block away from Au Cheval. So our group just walked in without any reservation for the weekend brunch and the wait was approximately 15 minutes. While we were waiting, I almost tripped at the front door because of this weird gap at the entrance - so watch your steps! Grange Hall Burger Bar mainly serves the grass-fed beef burgers, but other brunch options are also available (e.g. buffalo fries, pancakes, French toasts, etc). Service was pretty good, but there were bees that constantly circled around the patio area and eventually these little stingers became somewhat of a distraction. Oh, I also liked the cucumber iced water! *** Ultimate Burger (grassfed beef, Muenster, applewood bacon, arugula, caramelized onions, horseradish aioli - $14): Dry bacon, but juicy patty & toasted bun. Overall it was a good burger with solid execution.  *** Not the most amazing burger I've had, but a decent B / B+ (above average) & good quality burger bar. Considering the wait at Grange Hall Burger Bar isn't as bad as other SUPER popular restaurants in the Fulton Market area (e.g. Au Cheval and Little Goat), I would definitely consider Grange Hall Burger Bar as one of my hassle-free brunch options.",0.9841,0.765,0.162,0.073,0.5359477124183005

They're so variant between restaurants; sometimes great other times tasteless, mushy, crumbly, or oddly seasoned. I've had some good ones for sure, but this takes the cake. I recently took a vegetarian friend of mine who also gave it 2 thumbs up. Aside from the veggie burger, they have a great selection of other burgers & usually a seasonal one on the menu. Last night I had the seasonal Burger España - DELICIOUS. It was covered in amazingly seasoned capers & olives with a garlic aioli (the best aioli I've ever had - not greasy like some others).

The service was casual, very friendly, and personable. Smiles all around with great attitude. The decor and look of the place was clean and charmingly rural. The menu lists familiar food options but with eclectic ingredients added which intrigued my palate. Looking over the menu, I already wanted to come back again to try multiple food items. But first, I had to try something... I ordered the beetroot burger with the jalapeño jicama honey slaw. The elements of the burger blended well together flavor-wise. The burger meat was a good size and juicy. The meal portion was satisfying and not over-filling. The slaw was refreshing and the jalapeño provided a hint of a spice kick, a subtle boost. After finishing, I just had to bring home dessert after the waitress described their pie as ""like grandma's pie"". I brought home a blueberry slice. I'm not a huge blueberry pie fan but was open to try it. Later that day, I had the slice and devoured it. The blueberry had the right amount of sweetness and tartness for my taste, and the crust was perfectly flaky and tender.  The menu item descriptions with ""grassfed"" and ""free range,"" its variety of spices and herbs, the offerings of flavored condiments and sauces, and their suggested beer pairings make their options stand out from other burger places in the area. Combined with a dining space evoking a rustic and homey feel and an attentive and happy staff, the whole experience is very welcoming.

2015-07-22,5.0,"I've been to Grange Hall maybe fifteen times now, and I have settled on the Berries and Brie burger (formerly known as the French burger), cooked medium rare. Without a doubt, it is the best burger ever made. It's so fantastic words can't do it justice. I have introduced many of my friends to this burger, and they often agree that it is the best burger they've ever had. Since the berries and brie hit my taste buds for the first time, I have made it my mission to find a burger that beats or even matches the berries and brie in delicious, savory, sweet sweet flavor. I've tried what was recommended as the ""best burger in X"" for New York, California, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco, and countless other smaller cities. Not. Even. Close.  And the more I try the more I think I will never find a better burger. It's a bittersweet realization, because I may not live down the street from Grange Hall forever.

The restaurant is pretty small, especially with half the outdoor seating too wet to sit on that night, so we were quoted a 30 min wait for a table. Instead we sat at the bar immediately, which was a great decision. The inside decor made me feel like I was in a farmhouse, with large wooden doors at the entree way and lots of wood paneling throughout.Our bartender was very friendly and gave great food and drink suggestions throughout our meal. I went with the BBQ picnic burger while my friend tried the chicken burger. Both were great! The BBQ picnic had fried avocado on top, which I thought was pretty unique and very enjoyable. I also had an order of onion rings which came with a really tasty bbq-y ketchup. Our bartender convinced us to try dessert so my friend got a float with brown butter ice cream and Vernor's ginger ale and I went with a slice of the peach pie. The slice of pie was a bit pricey but really good. I highly recommend it if you're still hungry after your burger! This is a great place to grab a burger in West Loop if you don't feel like waiting 3 hours to get a table at Au Cheval (you should still try and go though).

I decided to try something new versus the same thing I always get at any burger place ( a regular cheeseburger with everything on it) I tried that berries and brie and WOW, it was a flavor party in my mouth. It was absolutely amazing minus the bun. I feel like the bun kind of didn't go with the burger and wasn't a fan, after a few bites I just removed the whole thing. I didn't love the texture (it was too bready). With the burger I ordered fries and onion rings with ranch. All three were great pairings with the burger.  I also ordered the sangria (not a fan). I will definitely be back to try something different.  Side note: The building the restaurant is in is great! It's a little barn yard smack dab in the middle of Randolph st. & the service was amazing!",0.9785,0.795,0.174,0.031,0.47979226655697244

2015-03-28,4.0,"Grange Hall...barnyard chic meets hipster heaven all complete with bomb ass burgers and some funky 80s tunes. I came here with two coworker frands on Thursday night and loved the entire experience. The space itself is really cool. As I mentioned it's made to feel like you're in a scene from little house on the prairie...but 2015 style. Also in the summer time they open their big front (barn) doors and there is outside patio seating. Pretty dope right? The liquor/beer selection is pretty robust and will be sure to speak to your taste buds esp if you are a bourbon or scotch fan. I went with a Mama's Little Yella Pils which was probably one of the lightest beers they offer as most of them are pretty heavy. We were seated pretty promptly (about 20 mins) without a Rez so that was nice. Seeing as this is a ""burger bar"" it was a natural choice for our dinner options. I went with the patty melt which was obscenely delicious! 2 kinds of melted cheese, grilled onions, thousand island dressing all sandwiched on top of a killer grass fed burger patty. Ahhh my mouth waters as I think back to it. My coworkers went with the build your own burger option and were very pleased. The options for the build your own are endless and include even a gluten free bun if that's your thing. I will say the only thing to note is Grange Hall does not melt their cheese on their burgers...not a tie breaker by any means but glad I went with the patty melt because I'm more for the ooey gooey. We also ordered a side of buffalo fries to split which were fabulous and way different then any loaded fry I've ever had. Caution: not for the faint at heart as the hot sauce is HOT.  All in all, Grange Hall is a fun little spot on restaurant row that offers deliciously fresh burgers, hearty beers, and a warm rustic vibe. Icing on the cake: Steve Winwood playing as I mauled a great meal. Can't wait to come back in the summer to enjoy the patio + people watching.",0.9949,0.8,0.179,0.021,0.6476651901070507

Everyone was very friendly and  Food was beyond great. I got the oatmeal and the peasant breakfast.  The oatmeal was perfectly balanced, sweet but filling and the oats were not overwhelmed by the sweetness of everything else that was going on.

We were quickly seated and were attended to by one of the friendliest servers I've probably ever had. Their attitude and ambiance is humble, casual, and just overall welcoming. Even the server stopped to chat and make jokes every now and then, so that set the tone for a nice chill brunch. A lot of things looked good but my eyes being bigger than my stomach I zeroed in on one of my favorites, biscuits and gravy topped with scrambled eggs, while my partner in dine opted for the triple berry pancakes. And in my post-party state, I had to of course indulge in a black cherry soda which was awesome! To be clear, they don't make their own black cherry which is what I assumed, it's bottled, but nonetheless great. Both items were pretty straightforward -- the triple berry pancakes had your standard pancake but with a berry compote built into it towards the center. It tasted fresh, not overly sweet or processed so that was nice to try. My biscuits and gravy were pretty solid with a heavy black pepper gravy with sausage bits of the perfect size throughout, and the biscuits were also awesome with a nice homestyle feel of not too hard but not too soggy either ... just right in between. Another nice thing about Grange Hall is that in a restaurant district thriving with high end options abundant with eclectic and gourmet cuisine, you can get a more casual and straightforward meal without spending too much (we rang in at about $25).

It was up there with an AU Cheval cheeseburger. Unfortunately, the veg burger wasn't one of the best I've had. A little too dry and bland...

2015-02-04,4.0,"So I'm not really a burger person... But there's no way to not adore this sweet taste of the farm on Randolph Street.  This (Michigan) farm-to-table burger joint makes you feel like you've stepped right into someone's home! From the worn-in linen napkins to the bathroom with vintage touches, the atmosphere is comfortable, rustic and just charming. A nice change from the lofty, industrial aesthetic that's found in most West Loop restaurants.  We set reservations on a Wednesday afternoon during Chicago Restaurant Week (they have one of the largest 'bang for your buck' menus!) and didn't need it. When we left at 7:30 p.m., the place was half full.  Because of CRW we were fortunate enough to  try a ton of food. The Ultimate burger is a hit - beef, bacon, Muenster cheese, arugula and carmelized onions. The chipotle BBQ sauce that's served with crispy onion rings is bold and unique. But most importantly, you CAN'T leave without ordering the buffalo fries! You will, will regret it. Perfectly sized fries are drizzled with homemade buffalo sauce, a bit of sea salt, celery and what seems like a whole package of blue cheese. These things will keep me dreaming for days. Finish your meal with a scoop of red velvet ice cream that is surprisingly not too sweet or overwhelming - a rare commodity with cake-flavored ice cream. I'll definitely return for the quaint atmosphere alone (and buffola fries, obviously). My only recommendation is to turn up the lights! The lightening isn't allocated well, so when dimmed, some areas are increasingly darker than others.

First, it took forever to get the waitress to come and take our order. Finally, when she gets there, I asked for a glass a water and that took about 15 mins. I ordered a turkey burger with fries and my fries never showed up. My friend ordered a burger with bacon and fries and the fries showed up 15mins after the burger and they forgot to add bacon to the burger but they did include jalapenos instead! We didn't bother letting them know that these things were missing since they would've taken too long to correct it anyway. The burgers were okay but not worth this bad service.  The only good thing was that they gave us the fries for free because it took so long. I can honestly say that I will not come back here again!

Don't let me confuse you, the menu is filled with beef and swine, but all can be substituted for either house made turkey or veggie options.  The menu choices are extensive and the flavors are impressive! My favorite is the Thankful, but can't go wrong with Victor's Veggie--piled high with fresh vegetables. Their rosemary homefries are on point with a delicious combination of herbs and a peppery kick. Ambiance here is cozy and casual. You almost feel like you're dining in someone's rustic home. And the (women's) restroom is super cute! The front doors open to a patio in the summer allowing for a few tables outside to people watch. This also makes the dining room feel more airy and open.  Overall, I would give Grange Hall 5 stars, but I need to take 1 star off for the price.

2014-09-16,5.0,"My sister was in town the other week and we were both jones-ing for a burger. She has celiac disease and finding a gluten free burger place was more difficult than we imagined it would be. Coming from Denver where everything is gluten free, she was expecting some more options. However, we were able to find Grange Hall Burger Bar and were treated to some of the best burgers I have had in Chicago. Tucked back into Randolph Street, near Au Cheval and Little Goat, Grange Hall is delightfully rustic and takes farm to table seriously. Their beef is all grass fed, their vegetables from local farmers, even their drink ingredients are sourced locally. We each got the Grange Hall version of a margarita, which was served in a Mason jar-what else-and was very refreshing. After much deliberation, I ended up ordering the BBQ Picnic burger with tangy slaw, chipotle BBQ sauce, pepper jack cheese, and a fried avocado. Yes- I had a food baby for days, but it was totally worth it. The regular buns here are great, topped with poppy seeds and they have Udi's gluten free buns for those who need them. I loved the fries here as well, thick cut and served with house-made spicy catsup. I would come back here in a heartbeat as I think it was some of the best meat I have had in the city-so fresh and very flavorful. . I did feel that I was back in Denver with the rustic hipster vibe that you don't really find much in Chicago, and I still have mixed feelings about this!

2014-09-06,4.0,"Wow. I want to say 5 stars but will save that for a second visit. After wandering around the near west side and trying to decide between Au Cheval, Little Goat Diner and Grange Hall we obviously settled on Grange Hall and I am so glad we did.  My boyfriend had been to Au Cheval about a week ago and said their burgers were good but just super super greasy. After dining at Grange Hall he confidently proclaims this restaurant to be vastly superior to Au Cheval.  Boyfriend ordered the build your own beef burger with mushroom, bacon and swiss. The mushrooms were quartered chunks, not typical thin slices. He said the mushrooms were incredible, perfectly seasoned, not soggy, stand on their own plain as a side dish. I had a bite of his burger and I was immediately OH MY GOD, SO GOOD, DROOL EVERYWHERE. We decided this is the best burger we've ever had in Chicago. I wont claim we've dedicatedly tried all the burgers there are to be had but we're Americans, we've eaten a lot of burgers. This beef burger has to be the best we've tried in Chicago easily. It was so juicy, tender, flavorful, mouth watering and perfect. Everything you always want in a burger but never get. The beef was truly tender, not fighting to bite through anything. The burger wasn't heaped with unnecessary ingredients. It was just purely delicious. I tried one more bite of just the beef. It wasn't perfectly seasoned on its own but it had good flavor and good salt, combine that with really good, soft buns and cheese and bacon and Ohhhhhh my god. I immediately said we have to take my dad here (Yo, Jon T.) who is an unofficial burger critic. I think he would be pretty impressed and that is saying a lot.  I ordered Victor's Veggie burger which is a wild rice, veggie and black bean burger. This was also outstandingly good. Covered in caramelized onions, grilled peppers, greens and chipotle mayo. The patty itself had a very crispy outer coating, probably fried, negating any healthy qualities contained within the veggie patty. The chipotle mayo was of course super tasty. The burger, every bite, was crazy delicious. It had sweet, spicy, crunchy, savory, fried. Everything in every bite. I could only eat half so I get to enjoy the other half for dinner tonight and I cannot wait.  Hugely impressed with Grange Hall. Ready to go back now.

The french fries are the thick cut potato slices like my mom used to make and their onion rings were to die for (passed on the sauce that came with it though). I also got the Coffee in the Rye spiked milkshake and it was heaven. Sucked that bad boy down in no time! Very cute place with a modern farmhouse vibe. Decent food, stock up more on the sides and shakes than the burger though!",-0.5666,0.716,0.135,0.15,0.5812301587301587

2014-07-18,5.0,"Having heard great things about Grange Hall Burger Bar from a  friend and visiting its web site for more information, I decided to check it out on Thursday.   Upon entering it and scanning its confines, I felt like I had been transported to a small  town restaurant despite being a few minutes from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago.   I almost expected the  farmer couple from Grant Wood's American Gothic painting to be sitting at a table.  I definitely felt a rural, rustic, farmhouse vibe in my surroundings.  Aside from its patrons, which were the typical eclectic mix of characters from the area, I found Grange Hall atypical of the many restaurants in the Randolph Street area. Grange Hall is very laid back and non-pretentious.   The 80/90s music playing in the background was a refreshing change for me and made me reminiscent of my younger days.   A quick look at the menu brought me back to Earth and made me realize I was still in Chicago and not Utica. The burgers at Grange Hall  are definitely not small town.  Instead, they are gourmet gastronomical creations featuring a unique selection of toppings.   As I am trying to eat more healthy foods, I was very pleased to learn that the meats in Grange Hall's burgers come from  grass-feed, hormone and antibiotics-free livestock.   Equally pleasing is that toppings are fresh and meat freshly ground.  Does this make a difference in the overall  taste of a burger?  Not being much of a foodie,  I was somewhat skeptical, but hopeful nonetheless.  My skepticism was laid to rest after one bite.  My Ultimate Burger was delicious.  The beef and bacon  on my burger actually had flavor.  One of the great things about a burger is that it is essentially a meal.   All the food groups are there in a nice, easy-to-handle package.   One of the bad things about many burgers is that it is often hard to distinguish the toppings, or one topping dominates the overall  flavor of a burger.  This wasn't the case with my Ultimate Burger.   I could taste each of the carefully selected topping as well as the beef and bacon.   Each topping lent a complimentary taste to the others.  None were overpowering.   To my astonishment, although the Ultimate Burger was pretty huge, the bun actually held together quite well which is remarkable given the size of the burger.    I also had an opportunity to sample a spiked shake called the  Bourbon Carmel Malt.  I  am generally not a fan of mixing any types of crème with alcohol.   However, the Bourbon Carmel Malt hit the spot with my taste buds.  I could  certainly taste the bourbon, but the bourbon didn't overpower the shake, rather it lent a syrupy flavor to the rich, very creamy ice cream.   I could have drank a couple of these.   I should mention that the service at was welcoming, friendly, prompt, and courteous.  The only minor complaint I have is that my cranberry juice, which was very good and had a nice spicy tinge,  was kind of small in comparison to the ample portions of my burger.    I will certainly be back at Grange Hall in the future to sample more of the unique burgers, the ciders and ales, possible the ice cream, and most certainly the Green River Lime soda that I haven't had since I was a kid.   If you are in the mood for a great tasting, reasonably priced, healthy burger in a casual, relaxed, downhome atmosphere right in the heart of the city, Grange Hall is well-worth a visit.",0.9984,0.785,0.185,0.031,0.533679060665362

She could not have been more apathetic. She said, ""Well, it's Sunday brunch and we are very busy."" It was Saturday at 1 p.m.  I get that she is not personally responsible for making those burgers, but she is responsible for having a professional attitude towards customer's feedback, especially because she asked! Then the person who bus tables came by, looked at our plates and said: ""Are you done?""  Can someone teach him how to say: ""may I take your plates?""",0.814,0.87,0.085,0.044,0.4525555555555556
2014-07-12,4.0,"For me it was all about the sides - those beer batter onion rings go down as some of the best I've had, and the big cut seasoned potato chunks are memorable. The batter on the onion rings was super thick and didn't flake off like a more typical onion ring that falls apart before you get it in your mouth. I don't remember what they season it with, but it left a nice almost-spicy kick in my mouth.  The french fries are seasoned potato chunks as pretty as they taste. These came with the kids meals and were super filling, so I'm glad my kiddos couldn't finish them all. The story with the fries is that when the server brought them out she dropped one on the ground and basically said 'oh well, good thing you ordered onion rings!' Mind you, there are only about 4-5 potato chunks that come as a dish, so you can now understand that they aren't just a typical everyday fry... really something special. They serve grass fed burgers here. I added batter fried zucchini and white cheddar cheese to mine. It was $12 and didn't come with a side, so I was really hoping for the big wow factor. Either I'm losing my love for burgers, or it was just okay. I did love that it was cooked perfectly, with an ever so slight pinkish hue on the inside. I think I would have preferred a bit more seasoning, but the quality of beef was certainly there. Not as cheesy as I would have liked.  Kids meals are foolers and a great value. My kids were stuffed after a few bites! The server compared them to the size of a White Castle slider so I was worried, but the menu states for 12 and under on the menu, and a $6.00 price ticket that includes a side of the big chunky fries and a lovely little dish of cucumbers and strawberries. The combination tasted like a watermelon bite.  Lovely outdoor patio with an electronic awning. They expanded it to make sure my uber sunburned kids were protected - thank you.  Decor is like a modernized barn. It's super dark inside, and the bathrooms reminded me of being on my grandparents farm. Super cute and nice and clean.  Wish I had room for dessert, because they are known for their pies - I spotted a cherry pie slice on the menu that I'm so wishing I had room for.  It's pricey here, but it's Randolph Street with a view of the Willis Tower in the distance. The ultimate urban experience.",0.999,0.721,0.25,0.029,0.5446856520385933

Any way - we walked several blocks to Girl and the Goat and while dripping wet (us California peeps were not prepared for sudden downpours) found that it would be a two hour wait to eat.

I chose the Ultimate Burger with Beef, Muenster, bacon, arugula, caramelized onions, and horseradish aioli with Fries. Strange person that I am, I added White Chedder to the burger as well.  Burger - most excellent.  Bacon - done right - crispy but not burnt Cheeses - melty goodness Fries - homemade - excellent. I love ketchup and am a Heinz 57 guy. They had 78 Red Ketchup. I dare say - it was better than Heinz with a little spicy kick! I finished with a piece of their homemade Strawberry Rhubarb pie with some Butter (nut?) ice cream on it. My Dad would have loved it, a perfect balance between the strawberries and the tartness of the rhubarb. Collective agreement amongst everyone - food was delicious, had a decent selection of beers for the drinkers in the group and everyone walked away happy.

Service was generally OK, although we had to ask for an extra plate a few times. Interesting beer/liquor menu. My main problem with Grange is that its veggie burger pales in comparison to Little Goat's version a few doors down. I'm not that high on Little Goat but their veggie burger is great. It is the same price as Grange's but infinitely superior. Actually, I ended up at Granger because I went to Little Goat but the wait was too long. I should have stuck it out. I was going to give Grange 3 stars for being merely mediocre until we got the bill. 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a side of fries was $61 with tax and tip. That would be fine if we enjoyed the meal, but it just wasn't that good. My wife had a beef burger and she said it was fine if instantly forgettable. Overall, a poor value.

2014-06-17,3.0,"Came here about a month ago for dinner with a friend. I forgot what my burger was called, but it had BBQ sauce on it and fried avocados which was really, really good. The waitress recommended we order our burgers medium, and I usually go for medium-well, but I thought why not, I'm sure she knows what  she's talking about. It was definitely too red for my taste. And to confirm that my body agreed, I ended the night with a massive stomach ache. Not a huge red meat eater to begin with, let alone super red meat, so I'm chalking it up to my poor choice in cooking style than anything wrong with the meat itself. The onion rings are magical and amazing. Even ordered them at Randolph fest last weekend because I love them so much. Cocktails were good, I had the red sangria which is always a go-to for me. At the end of our meal, we split the bill, and each of our checks came out to under $20. After 2 cocktails each, burgers, and sides, we knew that wasn't correct. After trying to get the waitress's attention for like, 20 minutes, she finally sauntered back over and acted all annoyed that we weren't ready to pay until we were like ""yeah something's not right..."" she whisked away our checks so quick without a single word of thanks and we were both a bit put-off. Hey, we could have just kept our mouths shut and got away with basically free meals, and we didn't think twice about being honest about the situation, but a thank-you would have been nice.

The burger came out with onions on it. I had the choice of being a jerk and sending everything back or being a nice guy, switching with my girlfriend so she could eat my burger without onions and I eat hers; we chose the latter because we really didn't want to wait for our food again.  I mentioned the fact that my girlfriend's burger came out wrong to the server who said ""oh, I think he must have been smoking something back there."" She offered to fix it but like I said, not interested in waiting again and didn't want to make a fuss.  We got a side of chili cheese fries to split, again no onions. There were onions in the chili cheese fries which, even if they were onion free, were horrendous. 6 or 7 large fried wedges of potatoes, topped with thin chili with lots of beans and chopped up cheese that was cold and wasn't melted.  Girlfriend's cocktail had no booze at all.  All totaled, we spent $50 plus $10 tip for 2 burgers (neither of which what we ordered), a side of horrendous chili cheese fries, 1 ""cocktail"" without any booze and a can of Vernors. The Vernors was tremendous though. I have worked in the industry for 20 years in nearly every capacity imaginable in a restaurant. Because of that fact I try to be a nice guy and not cause a fuss, it's just a meal after all. The fact that we spent that much money for food that was not how we ordered it and the explanation was that the cook was ""smoking something"" really frustrates me. No manager came out and said anything, no real apology was given, no dessert was offered or drink comped.

2014-06-11,4.0,"What exactly is a ""burger bar?"" Is it like a salad ""bar"" in which ground beef replaces lettuce, and toppings to choose from are aplenty? Is it a ""bar"" as in tavern, where you get a burger ""back"" instead of draft with your shot of whiskey? In either case, the establishment that uses this combination of words sets a high ""bar"" for itself. I happened to walk past Grange Hall last Saturday, after I had unfortunately arrived a week early for a morning class. Mornings have never been my forte.  I took a walk around the 'hood. What's this? A burger place serving breakfast and, adamantly, not brunch? (""We dont do brunch, because the farmers we honor dont either."" I appreciate the youthful idealism, but I've known a few farmers, and while they might not have done brunch, neither did they eat burgers for breakfast, nor did they spell 'don't' without an apostrophe.) I poked my nose into a very cozy room with a wide, comfortable bar, stage left, meant for savoring as well as sipping. Behind the counter, a smile that launched a thousand ships invited me to sit down. It wouldn't be right to deny the down-home hospitality of a purty farmer's daughter.  The name of the establishment being what it was, my choice had already been made as to which section of the menu  to order from. And besides, I've always heeded any dietary advice from Jules in Pulp Fiction: ""Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast."" I opted for The Ultimate, medium, and decided to hold the gluten today; they'll serve it on a bed of lettuce if you ask. ""Ultimate""ly, Muenster and caramelized onions were two characteristics of this burger. And an available side of home fries, as a car ad might say.  ""Mmm. That was a tasty burger!"" It was cooked perfectly: a moist, pink, loosely-packed inside, surrounded by seared brown goodness. It was a fine chew, though the farmer in my taste buds sang ""Hi, ho the Derry-O"" perhaps one too many times. The home fries were big chunks of tater that were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I believe they were deep-fried--not what Noah would define as home fries, but even more tasteful, to tell you the truth.  It was one of those rare days that wasn't right for a breakfast libation; I'll have to go back for that. And to try the corned beef burger and hash or the biscuits and gravy. I might be able to persuade a real farmer with excellent punctuation skills to join me for the latter and a beer back.",0.9918,0.877,0.109,0.014,0.44550407550407556

The host was very accommodating; adding extra chairs to the table outside and making sure we had enough room.  I read previous reviews that raved about the fried pickles, and they weren't kidding. Lots of crunchy batter, great seasoning, and definitely homemade. The sauce was great, too. I'm someone who loves STUFF on a burger, so I was overwhelmed (in a positive way) with choices. Build my own? Go with a pre-build? Wait, there are items not on the menu, too?! Again, based on reviews, I went with the BBQ Burger. In the history of dining out, I don't think I've ever finished a burger. Until today. The flavors, incredible. The size, perfect (order the extra meet if you prefer a huge burger!). The cole slaw was crunchy and a perfect amount, the BBQ sauce tangy (though messy), good cheese and the fried avocados...where have they been all my life? I'd never heard of such a thing and fell in love. We ordered a basket of fries. They were so fantastic that a basket didn't feel like enough for four to share, but that's likely why I was able to finish my burger! Ask for a side of ranch with whatever you get. It was delicious! I wanted to stop, but I couldn't leave without dessert. I opted to share a brown butter sundae. For the price, it was perfect and just enough to share.

We ordered the veggie burger and a BBQ burger with a side of fries. Our food came out quickly and the burgers were big. My veggie burger had tons of bell peppers spilling over the sides and it was possibly the best veggie burger I've had out. I could taste sage or some kind of delicious herbs in it. My man's BBQ burger was great as well - he really enjoyed that. The fries were out of this world - and the ketchup they have - it really was the best ketchup I've tasted.

Well, the burger itself was delicious, I can't argue that. You can taste the quality of the beef in every bite. But for such a small portion at $12, it's a hard proposition for me.

My tablemates got the patty melt and the ultimate and reported great things too. Another great aspect is the portions are not out of control, which is nice when eating burgers, fries,etc.  There are many little aspects of the restaurant that make the whole experience nice - lemon cucumber water, amazing artisan ketchup, good service.

2014-04-02,3.0,"I discovered this place during Restaurant Week 2012 and have been coming in almost every month since.  First, the good:  the pies are amazing and are worth the visit. Even if that weren't the case, these burgers are some of the best I've ever had. They started doing chef's menu burgers a while back, which has been a real treat. They've changed something in the recipe for fries recently, and they're great. Overall, the menu has changed slowly over the years, and all for the better. It's been a delight to see the menu gain its footing and come into its own. There isn't a thing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend.  Now, the reason I give GHBB 3 instead of 5 stars:  a lot has changed at GHBB since I've started going there. A lot keeps changing. Most of it has been great, actually. I have had a few bad experiences with the host/floor manager; for example, he once moved my table out from underneath me while I was eating, and has regularly misquoted table wait times, etc.  Additionally, I've had a lot of dinners here next to babies, in various moods. I've never witnessed the restaurant staff be unfriendly or unaccommodating to families or children, but it's my personal opinion that this isn't the kind of place you bring a kid to on a Friday night. This is a judgment on my fellow diners. I imagine that lunch, breakfast, and off-peak nights are probably the best time to bring kids here. I certainly wouldn't bring my child here on a Friday or Saturday---tables are tightly packed and it can get loud.  **Edited 4/3/14 to clarify part about babies.**",0.9678,0.875,0.105,0.02,0.41792836792836807

2014-03-24,2.0,"Had a truly bizarre 1st experience here that will also be our last. We had a big group (10 adults+1 baby), which I now know is a challenge to fit into a cozy space like Grange Hall, but that's why we made a reservation ahead of time. If this seemed totally impossible, the restaurant could have said no and we'd have understood.  When we arrived (on time) we were told that our table wasn't ready-- no apology, just that fact. As someone who has had a million jobs in food service, including as a hostess, I know that sometimes previous customers camp out, so the table you need for the next group isn't ready and it isn't your fault. That's what seemed to be happening here. However, you communicate this to the party in question and update them periodically on the situation. That didn't happen at all. So here we are, this giant group of people and a baby in a carseat, standing at the front of the restaurant waiting... for more than 25 minutes. Several times the hostess asked us to move (which we would do, only to be in the way of someone else, so then we'd move again) because we were ""in the way of everything [she needed]""--her tone was crazy rude, as though we were actively ruining her entire life. I understand that we're taking up space and it's annoying, but where else are we supposed to go? Our plan was to be seated and eating by now, believe us.  Eventually the campers get up and some of us are placed at their table, but the rest of us are seated across the restaurant. Since this was a reunion of a group of people who were all in from out of town and hadn't seen each other in a year, this was really sad (also, we reserved a table so we'd all sit together?). There was an empty 2-top next to us so we asked if we could add it to the mix, pull up a chair and all sit together. The hostess looked at us like we were from an alien planet and said, ""there's not enough room."" We recounted ourselves and insisted that yes, if we added one more chair, we'd all fit, could she please let us try? She brought the chair, but continued to insist that we'd never be able to fit. It wasn't a tight squeeze AT ALL.  Our server was LOVELY and a nice antidote to the sour experience we had our first 30 minutes in the restaurant. We all got to catch up with one another and the food was tasty. All in all, we left pretty happy. But if I'm being honest, there are SO MANY amazing places to eat in this town, where the food is stand-out and the people aren't jerks... so why bother going here again?",0.9862,0.815,0.12,0.065,0.5506845238095238
2014-03-24,5.0,"I went here on Friday night with a craving for a nice juicy burger, and judging by the ""Grange Hall Burger Bar"" I figured I would be in the correct place.  When you first walk up to the place it stands out from the rest of the restaurants around there because it makes you feel like you are entering a rural type of establishment and it makes you think of farms, and yes....cows.  One thing they advertise about their burgers is that it is all grass fed beef, oh boy, ""grass fed"" are two of the sweetest words in burger language.   We went in and there was a slight wait.  We were a little upset at first when we arrived and got a bad impression, due to the hostess asking us how many and after we told her two she said just a minute then vanished into the back for like EVER!  We were staring at this empty table for two that was all cleaned and we were thinking about either just taking it or walking out in anger due to her horrible communication and the fact that she vanished, in fact, I do not remember seeing her ever again that night, hmmmmm. Luckily we did not walk out or steal that table because a gentleman came to replace the loopy chick and said that table was resevered but he said he would seat up very soon.  In the mean time me and my brother got some entertainment when a group of dingbats walked in looking for a table then they decided to leave due to one woman's comment ""They only have burgers here,"" ROFL what an idiot, this place is a ""BURGER BAR!""  Well that was entertainment for us while we waited, sometimes hearing someone be real stupid can be funny as hell. It was not much longer before we were seated at the bar, we chose the bar because we were hungrey as hell and because we are brothers and not a couple we figured the bar was just fine, BTW, the gentleman doing the seating was doing a good job unlike the airhead that vanished into thin air before him.   They had a restaurant special that day where you get a 2 burgers, 2 sides, an appetizer, and two deserts for $44, perfect!  That was what we were going to order anyway, accept now we would get free desert!  The bar tender provided excellent service BTW, and was extremely tentative and sharp. We ordered our burgers medium rare like usuall although, I can't remember the name of the burger (see pic below) but it was so damn good and juicy and yes organic, grass fed baby!  Delicious, juicy, fresh, beef taste and the bacon on it was damn good! We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer, holy shit, you get a lot in the order and they are the best damn fried pickles I ever had!  The breading was this super crisp, seasoned, and light tasting breading that blew my mind!  We had beer battered onion rings for a side and fries.  The onion rings were amazing with crisp, light taste.  The fries were Russett Potato wedges so of course they were damn good.  Even their ketchup they have there is freakin good and I hate ketchup.  The hot sauce they have at the table is really damn good too. Now for the desert, we ordered the key lime pie and the ice cream.  The ice cream was so smooth tasting and was obviously fresh dairy.  The key lime pie was heavenly but the biggest appeal with the whipped cream on, that whipped cream was amazing and upon every bite it made me feel like I was sinking into the bar stool due to the incredible taste of that delicious cream, muah, superb!   I will definately return here, and BTW they mainly only serve burgers LOL, so don't come in disappointed like that ding bat I talked about LOL.",0.9983,0.718,0.196,0.086,0.650640331890332

Now we are currently on the paleo diet, trying our best to stay away from grains and carbs (i.e. the wonderful bun that makes a burger so much better).  We ordered 1 seasonal salad, 1 turkey chili, and 2 of the chef burgers - the Ultimate and the Beetroot with lettuce instead of the bun.   Salad - had a great variety of greens, loved the sweetness of the strawberries that complemented well with the light saltiness of feta cheese.  So yes, it was seasonal, so for all you know, when you order it, it could very well be something else.  If you are trying to be good and only order salad for yourself, I have to warn you that you may still be hungry afterwards due to the lack of meat...what can I say?  I'm a meat eater, so hell yeah we ordered the chili and burgers too... the Turkey Chili - who said you have to have beef or pork in your chili?  The flavors were definitely there, so it doesn't hurt that it's technically a little healthier for you, right?  The bowl was a little small, but hey, not bad for $3. the Ultimate - here's your classic bacon and cheese topping with the glorious caramelized onions!  YUM.  I have to say that one is a must...if not for the flavor of the grass-fed beef itself.  You can really taste the quality.  Makes it hard to go back to your regular whatever crap-fed frozen beef burger. the Beetroot - also tasty, but eating roasted beets with the beef didn't seem to pair quite as well.  I almost feel like I prefer to eat the beets on their own with goat cheese and pistachios!...But that's Purple Pig instead =) And finally, if you are planning to order the burgers withOUT the buns, no need to order the salad!  We were under the impression that we might just get some romaine or iceberg lettuce leaves under the bun, but it was the same greens from the seasonal salad...minus the additional toppings, but still.  The waiter didn't inform us about it, so we basically had some salad overload...maybe he didn't realize that as well?  Who knows.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for the burgers!",0.9914,0.824,0.136,0.04,0.5334563055991627

Here is what happened: I called on a Thursday and made a reservation for Sunday for 3 people for 11am. Sunday came around, and we showed up at 11:07am. When I gave my name to the person who appeared to be the hostess, I was told that it would be a 20 minute wait. I explained that we had a reservation for 11am, and she was quick to snap back that she gave our table away because we were ""late"" (yes, a whole 7 minutes). I then asked to speak with a manager, and she informed me that she was the manager. Unapologetically she continued to insist that it was my fault that she gave our table away because we were ""late"" (by 7 minutes). Mind you that there were NO other people waiting for tables. She gave our table away to the first group that walked in the door, not honoring their apparent reservation policy whatsoever.  We then got out our phones and began to search for other places to eat. In the process a table opened up, which we chose to accept. The manager/hostess remained unapologetic, and guided us, with her snotty attitude, over to the table where we attempted to elevate our moods with food for the remainder of the meal. The food was good, not fabulous, and the greeting was really something I could have gone without. Given that the poor decision making, customer service and general attitude was coming from the leadership/management, I probably won't go back.

In the meantime, I was able to enjoy some good conversation (until it got really loud as more people filed in) and soak in the cute decor in this smaller than expected venue.  I was pretty underwhelmed with the portion sizes here. For $4, I was expecting more than half a dozen onion rings. While they were tasty and not dripping in grease, I'm not sure each one is worth a king size candy bar.

I don't think it would hurt to throw a few more in there. The turkey chili fries were only okay, there was nothing special going on there. The picnic burger was really, really good. It had that great beef flavor with fantastic toppings. One thing I can really commend Grange on is that my burger had bbq sauce, cheese, and fried avocados on it.

2013-10-19,4.0,"A burger Bar with awesome sides. Got hungry and you know how challenging it is on a Saturday without reservations - well, we thought it would be a good chance to try Grange Hall.  Called ahead and they said there wasn't much of a wait and we hightailed it over.  Got there about 5:20PM and was seated right away. My dining companion had the Ultimate Burger and I had the Patty Melt.  The taste of both was excellent and the quality was there. HOWEVER, usually, I expect a lot of food at a place like this and honestly, they were smaller than expected portions.  My Patty Melt meat did not measure up to the bread in size and I felt I had to search for the meat.  Again the meat was very good, I just had to look for it.  The onions and cheese - excellent as was the rye bread.  The ultimate burger seemed rather average size to me but my dining companion had the same issue, quality meat, but not a whole lot there.  I think their heart is in the right place on the meat, but keep your expectations in line as far as the portion size goes. Now the sides were the surprise.  The mac and cheese was superb, but they added potato chips for the crispy accent.  (In watching shows like Top Chef, they crucify the chefs when they take products that they buy in the store and add to their dishes - I think the chips took away from the dish.)  Suggestion for the establishment: try crispy bacon, just a little goes a long way, but I think crispy bacon would make it to die for. The french fries were home cut and prepared with excellence.  Well worth it, reasonable portion for the cost. Do order the Onion Rings, but you may want to make it a double order if you really like onion rings because these are the absolute BEST onion rings I have ever tasted.  They got it right.  You will be in onion ring heaven with theirs. Service was good, bless their hearts they forgot to bring me my sweetening for the ice tea.  I think they would be far better to bring it and put it on all the tables rather than have to ask the customers to have to ask for it.  Can't be too critical since I only asked once - but this is becoming the norm, sad to say, especially on Randolph Street. Took the Green/Pink line there and got off at Morgan, then walked two blocks to the restaurant - easy to get to and great interior, small but efficient. Booth Size, Tight but manageable.  I am a portly 44 around the waist and I barely fit, but I was comfortable.  If you are bigger than a size 44 about the waist, go for a table and not a booth. I say go and enjoy it, but keep your portion size expectations in check.  ;-) Good job overall, Grange Hall.",0.9979,0.783,0.189,0.029,0.6096238095238096

2013-09-14,3.0,"Coming from LA, I'm spoiled by the gourmet burgers of Father's Office and Umami, so it's a difficult for me to say great things about Grange Hall Burger Bar given their price range.  There is no exception that the burgers here are tasty, but I cannot justify the exorbitant cost they charge. 14 dollars for a burger and $3.50 for 5 pieces of onion rings. That's right. Five fucken onion rings for $3.50. Yep. 5 fucken rings. Not 10, not 9, not 8 but FIVE.  I don't know about you, but you don't need a PhD to understand that 5 onion rings should not equate to that price. Also, if you're a burger's fan then Chicago has better and cheaper burgers at a higher quality than what they offer. One rare location I can name is  Yoshi's Cafe, who is not known for their burgers but nevertheless make one of the most amazing burgers Chicago has to offer. Yoshi's burgers cost 15 dollars but come with sweet potato fries and is made out of wagyu beef.  Honestly, let's be realistic. The staff is great. The food is great, BUT this place is way overpriced. As a man no longer in puberty, I still need 2 burgers to feel full along with a side of onion rings. That equates to around 38 dollars with tip. Yep, 38 bucks for burgers.

In my most recent experience, she had messed up who ordered what temperature for their burger, and then also put a huge serving of caramelized onions on my burger when I requested NO ONIONS. The best part was she charged for me the onions and I had to tell her to remove it. When she removed the upcharge, the total changed less than the amount of the upcharge for whatever reason.

This place is located at the West Loop near other restaurants like Girl & The Goat and DragonFly..The place is nicely setup with the restaurant' looking like a barn The main entrance was interesting -- it looked like a small wooden shed. Inside, the decor and dining area was setup nicely. The ""barn doors"" of the restaurant were big doors that lead from the dining room to the outdoor seating area in the front. We decided to sit outside since the weather was terrific. This place is known for their burgers, hence the name. I ordered the ""Ultimate Burger"" which was grass-fed beef burger with muenster cheese,  Applewood bacon,  onions, and spinach. It was by far, the most absolute TASTIEST burger I have ever eaten in my life. Every burger you have the option of putting a fried egg on. DEFINITELY GET AN EGG!The egg was cooked to a perfect ""over-easy"" with a tap of the yolk, its yellow gooey awesomeness flows down from the top of the burger, down the meat, and gathering in a delectably drooling-worthy pool of yumminess on the plate. The burger was cooked at a perfect medium. I never had a grass-fed burger, but this one was damn delicious. My friend, in his words, called it ""nut-busting delicious"". The burgers were somewhat pricey at around $14 a la carte meaning it didn't include any sides such as french fries. We ordered the onion rings and fries and they were deep fried to a nice crisp. Even the water tasted awesome -- it had a cucumber and lemon slice that added a refreshing twist to the planet's most ample resource. BATHROOM REVIEW: Located in the back of the restaurant, there is a private bathroom for Mens and one for Womens. Inside, the bathroom was clean. There was no tiles as it conformed to the rest of the restaurant having lacquered dark hardwood floors. To go with the barn/countryside theme, there was a random old iron fence door just sitting on the side of the toilet.  The sink was rather cool -- it had a handle that dispense to a salad bowl type bathroom sink. Very homely. Sit or squat? Luckily even though this place was resembling a barn, there was toilet paper and a door lock. Sit!!",0.9923,0.852,0.133,0.016,0.5328165374677002

2013-07-28,5.0,"I would definitely recommend this place. We went for the first time last night and had a great time. Grange Hall is going for a farmhouse-style decor and is heavily focused on local ingredients from the Midwest.  We started out with the Stella Blue Bull Fries (handcut fries smothered in blue cheese and hot sauce), which were incredible. The menu centers around burgers (if you hadn't guessed), so as a vegetarian, I tried the ""Garden."" As a side note, I hate paying $10+ and getting a frozen ""Garden Burger"" patty, which seems to happen a lot in Chicago (Hey, Kuma's), but Grange Hall makes its own (wild rice, black beans, some veggies) and does a  mighty fine job of it. My dining companion did a Make-Your-Own Grange burger and enjoyed his as well. The beer menu is limited to several Midwest options, but they were all worth drinking. I tried a ""Hound Dog"" cocktail, a play on a Greyhound but with maple/cinnamon accents, which was unique and dangerously drinkable.  The staff were all very friendly and Wade, the bartender, was awesome. We probably would have left much earlier (and sampled fewer Midwest brews) had we not enjoyed talking with him so much. The only real downside to Grange is it's a little pricey (a $12 burger doesn't even come with fries?), but I guess that makes sense on Randolph.

And, In a world full of nonsensical 'craft' burgers on 'artisan' rolls, a solid burger can be hard to find.  Tonight, I thought I'd give Grange Hall a try. I ordered some simple items - two bowls of chili, something called the ultimate burger and the beer-soaked sour kraut dog (yes, this order was for two). Let's start with the chili. In many cases, chili is just flavorful mush with the individual textures lost to the act of boiling. In this case, the beans were firm yet delicious, the meat was tender and plentiful and the overall bowl was more like something you'd expect from your own kitchen (IF you can cook) than GrubHub. That's a big win for an item that costs less than $4. The dog was so good, I don't remember much about it. Why, you ask? Because the 1st bite of that homemade thousand island style sauce coupled with the beer-soaked kraut on top of a juicy dog turned into the last bite without warning. I threw that thing down so fast, I must've scared my girlfriend. When I looked up, she was just staring at me. I asked why through thousand island-stained lips and she said 'I wanted a bite but was afraid to ask' The burger was equally solid.

Per usual, if I see Biscuits and Gravy on  menu, I'm going to order it. Grange Hall's version of this southern staple hit the spot. There are very few places north of the Mason-Dixon line that can cook up a decent plate of B&G. I was impressed by GHBB's version. It was served with generous portions of sausage chunks covered with a spiced up gravy that was mighty tasty. Everyone else in our group really enjoyed their food.   My only gripe would be the service. It was awfully hard to get a server to bring us a cup of coffee that morning. And the place was about 3/4 full. I'll try not to be too harsh.

The food came out really quickly but I think it was because of the way that the kitchen works - like they just make a schload of patties and then throw the toppings on them. I am guessing this because the cheese on my burger was not melted, it was just a cold, hard piece of cheese on top of the burger. Kind of disappointing.

The hamburgers are solid but not exceptional.  I was there with two other people and we all ordered our burger to a different doneness from medium rare to well done.  When the burgers were served they were all well done.  The toppings offered for the burgers are standard type toppings offered by burger joints of this ilk.  The seasonings on the burgers were too bland to be noticed.  With all the upscale burger joints you need to offer more than an equal to the competition.   When it comes time for dessert they serve a pie of the month.  This is great as long as you like the pie being served that month and that you can eat the same pie choice over the entire month.  Usually I can't do that.  However, I'm a sucker for key lime pie.  I could have a slice every day and never get tired of it.  Their key lime pie is excellent.  Nice creamy texture with a sharp taste and wonderfully thick graham cracker crust.  Next time I go during key lime pie month, I will order the pie for my main and the burger for my dessert.  That way if I fill up on my main, I won't feel bad about not having left enough room for dessert.",0.9888,0.841,0.134,0.025,0.5480303030303031

Our burgers are brought to us and shortly after we'd each taken a bite, our server comes and tells us that the order that came before us had ordered the exact same thing, except done medium-well and we'd gotten their burgers. Now, the interesting thing is that he simply told us this- no offer to fix it, no offer to knock something off our bill. Just, ""hey, we screwed up. enjoy our error!""

Don't get me wrong, I love Au Cheval, but Grange Hall is a busy place, and for good reason! The Burger was fantastic, maybe not the best burger I ever had, but that's a tough one to beat. Every ingredient was a $1, but for good reason, simpler is better. Walked in on a Saturday night and the host greeted us warmly showing us right to an available seat (something I wasn't expecting since everywhere was so packed). My first instinct was to look at my friend and say ""uh oh look at all this hipster non-sense!"" All organic and locally grown food and drink, meh choices on the local beers they decided on, everyone is wearing plaid. I was already ready to shrug this place off. I ordered a plain bacon cheeseburger with onions and a fried egg. My roommate got the same with fries. He got a local gingerale, I had a two brothers beer and we were off. Our food came out fairly quickly and when I saw it I knew this place was going to be OK. That bacon, my word that bacon, thick juicy slices, crisped to perfection, smothered in fresh onions and a fried egg. Thick carved out chunk of gorgeous pepperjack cheese with some real substance and flavor to it and this patty dripping with flavor. I bit in and was hooked. Not to mention my roommates fries, thick cut real fries, basically potato wedges seasoned amazingly, and each burger came with homemade pickles. Normally I hate those gross dill pickles I get at regular burger bars, but the sweet pickles here. Wow. End of the night we were stuffed to the gills, but we still had to order their pie. One specialty pie that changes each month. We had their Lemon Cheesecake, and if I knew it was that good I would have placed an order for a pie to go on top of everything else. And MOST IMPORTANTLY, don't forget the bacon or friend eggs ;) The staff was super friendly, the liked to joke around and were easy to converse with. Upon leaving we left comments on the comment card and our server had fun joking with us about what we had said. Service was speedy and prompt and we managed to get in get a seat, order eat and were about to pay before Au Cheval finally called us to say there was an opening available. This place was especially a treat because you are at big picnic tables with strangers. If you have no issue making new friends, it is even more fun as you get to meet new people. I highly recommend this place, go with a group of friends, keep it simple and just have a great time over all.",0.9989,0.713,0.239,0.048,0.5011669078048387

I don't mind communal table, it makes it easy to scope out what others are eating and eavesdrop to see if they enjoy it.  I had heard great things about the turkey burger, and it was indeed the best turkey burger I've had (moist with a touch of sage!) - ie: it made me not regret ordering turkey over a grass fed beef burger with *applewood smoked bacon*!  I also had the onion rings, which were crispy and served with yummy bbq sauce.  My friend had the burger with fried avocado (big chunks that are deep fried).  She said it sounded better than it was, but overall was a good burger.  The fries (actually big potato wedges) looked good as well.  Dessert-wise I tried the PB&J ice cream and it was delicious, it tasted exactly like it sounds. For drinks, it's a tiny beer list, so I got the Hello Daisy (gin cocktail).  It was more like a mimosa, heavy on the fresh squeezed oj.  It's not exactly a craft cocktail, but the $8.75 pricetag should have given that away. Service was good and the food was good but didn't blow us away.  I'd give this a solid A-OK (3 stars).

2013-02-17,4.0,"Did I just take a trip down memory lane?  Faygo pop, hand dipped shakes, and big thick juicy burgers reminded me of a place in Detroit where I grew up where my dad would take me when I had been ""good"". But Grange Hall Burger Bar is here and now as the grownup, I can go whether I am good or not!   See . . .there is a benefit to getting older!   We went on a Saturday for lunch.  Here's a secret.  There is one hour on Saturday (12 - 1) when they serve BOTH breakfast and lunch (or so our server said) .  So we were given both menus to peruse.  Tough work for a restaurant to do changeover from one daypart to another especially when they serve both menus but they pulled it off beautifully. It was pretty busy when we got there so we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar.  The place is cute . . . .flowered napkins, small furniture pieces around (even under the bar) and other ""farm friendly"" decorations.  Most of the seating is communal which is just part of the charm of the place.  Know that when we left (around 1:15) the place was packed and the waiting list was long so plan accordingly! Our server, Michelle, was terrific!  Friendly and quick she made some good suggestions and went to find out answers when I asked about specific ingredients.  I like that if you order a burger, you have a choice of sizes of patty, kind of bun, (they even carry Ubi gluten free buns) and then various toppings.  It's a pretty simple operation. I ordered my burger along with a side of the turkey chili.  Know if you want to eat things together you should tell them otherwise it's kind of a hodge podge of when things are going to come up. My burger was perfectly done and the chili with it's two kinds of beans was quite good and the perfect size for a side.  My friend had the mac and cheese (the pasta was a little over done) and a burger which was equally as good.  A couple of Faygo Rock and Rye's completed the lunch. But what we both yearned for and we will have to return for are the hand scooped, hand blended milk shakes and pies that were cut and garnished with whipped cream or ice cream  Sitting at the bar we had the perfect vantage point to watch these creations come to life.  And it was then that I had that flashback to that place in Detroit where my dad always took my brothers and me when we had been ""good"".   I'm going to be good so I can go back to Grange Hall and relive the moment again and again!",0.9985,0.8,0.192,0.008,0.6022486772486774

If the waiter was busy, why didn't anyone else help out to drop the drinks, so people can drink them and order more, and spend more money? - two hostesses and still people on a wait while there were open tables. Hostesses would stop in the middle of turning a top to immediately greet and take down the name of an incoming party, it literally took 20 minutes to set an empty top and seat a table because the hostesses weren't working together (i.e. one turning tops, one managing wait) It seems as if their saturday staff were hired for their hipster looks rather than experience, and there was no management to be seen.

Our waiter was very nice and service was prompt. Our table ordered the turkey chili fries and while I did not partake, everyone else seemed to enjoy them. Everyone in our party ordered a beef burger and the beef really did taste better than it does other places, it was just everything around it that was kind of lacking. A few other people mentioned that if you are going to be a burger bar it would be nice if there were a list of suggestions for some burger topping combinations that one might not think of to encourage a more adventurous choice. I think that would be a great revision to the menu. I got the onion rings as a side and it was mostly fried ring and very little onion, so those were just average. The pie of the month didn't sound that great to any of us so we all got ice cream. You order it by the scoop, so I imagined a little scoop of ice cream and therefore ordered two different flavors. I was very surprised when they came out with two sundae dishes with what really seemed like like 2-2.5 scoops of ice cream per flavor. This is a nice problem to have and I mention it here not as a complaint, but just so others don't make the same mistake I did. One order would have been more than enough for me. Luckily, I just shared.  As we ate dinner the place emptied out a bit and we all commented on how much we liked the decor as we could actually see it more and more, so that's a plus.

I was fine with that, but if you're someone who really values your privacy and personal space, this place might not be the right fit for you. My burger was just alright. I chose the beef option; there's also a choice of turkey and something else that was probably vegetarian. I added avocado slices and an egg to it, which usually makes an ordinary burger into an extraordinary burger, but this time it seemed to do absolutely nothing. I probably should have specified that I did not want my egg to be sunny side up. When it came that way, I didn't want to complain so I just ate it. But the whole time, I hated how the yolk soaked my burger and dripped down my hand and onto my plate... That's a personal preference, I guess. Other than that, the burger just tasted really bland. Maybe it's because they're grass fed burgers. Or maybe Swiss was the wrong cheese choice on my part. Whatever it was, my taste buds were like eh.  However, I did like the mac and cheese side that I ordered. You can't really go wrong with mac and cheese. I got it without the potato chip crumbs because I personally don't like my mac and cheese to be crunchy, so I can't say much about that aspect of this dish. I also tried the spiked milkshakes. I liked the Coffee in the Rye better than the Bourbon Caramel Malt because it had kind of a chocolatey taste to it, but both were good. You can taste the liquor in it, which makes it extra sweet.  So overall, the experience was just okay. I'd come here again but maybe just try a different cheese with my burger.",0.9865,0.799,0.152,0.049,0.5042882744495648

2012-12-03,4.0,"Went with the family to try out Grange Hall's Farmer Breakfast (was advised by those who have been before to NEVER call it brunch) and the meal certainly fit the name.  Picture yourself out on the ole homestead sitting in your kitchen looking out over acres of land watching the sun rise and preparing for a day full of manual labor with a rooster's lament in the background.  Okay, maybe I was preparing for a day of doing absolutely nothing and the sun rose a good 5 hours before I took my seat, but you get the picture.  Grange Hall's ambiance is perfect for a rustic down-home kind of breakfast in the middle of the city. The breakfast cocktails are outstanding-- I had the cowboy coffee (coffee, rye whiskey, vanilla, cinnamon, and whipped cream) and my dad tried the bloody mary- made with bourbon.  Never again will I make one with vodka, this drink was genius. The most popular order at our table was the peasant-style baked eggs... eggs, tomato, cream, thyme, rosemary, basil and muenster cheese all melded together served with your choice of various kinds toast or biscuit, meat (applewood bacon, maple pork sausage patties, apple turkey sausage patties, or canadian bacon) and fresh fruit.  Or, if you are me and have fat kid tendencies then you sub out the fruit and sub in the hot, crispy fried rosemary potatoes- a choice everyone should probably make. Or they can just update the menu and credit me... just saying.  Others ordered the open-face breakfast burger, veggie quiche loretta, and slow-cooked apple and cranberry oats.  Everything was outstanding, fresh, not at all greasy, and managed to fill us to the max without that ""roll me out of this restaurant"" feeling some (I) often (almost always) get after a big meal.",0.977,0.877,0.104,0.019,0.6473684210526316

Food: We both had the open burger entree.  The french toast, burger, cheese, egg, and bacon worked so well together.  I loved the sweet and salty combination throughout.  The burger was cooked medium and tasted great.   Drinks: We both had a canned pale ale.  It was okay. Service: He seemed a little busy at first, but he was quite good.  Friendly and warm.  The hostess couldn't have been nicer. Atmosphere: Very cool.  We both felt like we were eating in someone's home.  Be prepared to sit next to strangers, as the tables are long and communal.  The bathrooms are also cute.

2012-11-29,5.0,"Don't tell my bf but I've fallen head over heels in love. Yes, fairytale, run into each other's arms, I'd become a vampire for you to spend eternity with you type of love. Well, except I couldn't become a vampire because I would never be able to enjoy another burger from Grange ever again and I'm pretty sure vampires don't eat in-house churned ice cream.  We called at about 5:00 on a Thursday. They don't take reservations unless you have a party of 8 or more but the guy that answered the phone said it wouldn't be a problem for us to walk in. We showed up an hour later and sure enough, there were plenty of places to sit at the communal tables and at the bar. We opted to sit at a table and this place is too cute to be true! Nothing matches here and they have quilts on the walls which really makes the place so warm and inviting. All of the servers wear plaid and blue jeans. Nothing is pretentious or trying to hard here.  They have some decent beers here as well as a few wines and some awesome cocktails. The bf went with a Bell's Amber Ale while I went with the Rosemary Peach Iced Tea. The peach was pureed and perfectly sweet. They had a lot of great lemonades and teas on the menu, I'll be back to try more. Oh, and the water comes with cucumber slices, me likey, me likey a lot!!! The burgers come in different sizes and you can either have poppy seed, rye, or a gluten free bun. Gluten free will run you $2 extra. Next, you add cheese, and they have some awesome ones too! I opted to get sharp white cheddar on mine, all cheeses are $1 extra. Next, you add some premium toppings like sweet grilled red onions or sauteed mushrooms, those will also run you an extra $1 a piece. I didn't get any extra toppings, I got your typical lettuce, onion, and ketchup variety. The bf got the mushrooms, avocado, and the sweet grilled red onions. Each of the burgers also come with a little silver cup of the sweetest, most delicious pickles I have ever tasted. Add them to your burger or savor them separately like I did.  All of the burgers come medium but mine was a little pink the middle and juicy, just the way I like it. If you don't like to see any pink in your burger, order it medium well. The bun was crispy on the edges, so essentially perfect I couldn't believe my tastebuds. All of the ingredients were so fresh and the grass fed beef really does taste different in my opinion.  Now, for dessert... my favorite meal of the day. The ice cream is all house churned and the flavors are amazing. Chocolate banana? YES! Peanut butter and jelly? How can I say no to that! They also do a different pie every month, November was a pumpkin cheesecake. We opted to get a scoop of ice cream each. The chocolate banana and the peanut butter and jelly were to die for! I can see why they make shakes out of them! They also sell them by the pint and the 1/2 gallon. Man, if I had the money!! I'd be knee deep in this ice cream.  Grange deserves every single one of the 5 stars I'm giving it. The menu is stellar, they serve a quality product, and the decor is so quaint and inviting. I mean, they had Christmas trees lined up outside the barn windows that had tags saying ""eat up!"" How much more adorable could you get?",0.9994,0.757,0.224,0.018,0.4934586797682036

Nothing matched but it all seemed to come together. I like the fact that you can choose each topping, you even get to choose your bun. I didn't like that you had to pay for each topping, that's how it all adds up, fast!  We had some turkey chili fries to start which were very tasty! My wife had a 6oz burger, I had a 9oz. The burger was really good, I enjoyed it.  My wife had a root beer, I had a beer. We finished up with chocolate ice cream cones. The bill was nearly $70. I can appreciate a good burger but you can get plenty of ""good"" burgers without having to pay so much.

Pumpkin pie a-la-mode with vanilla ice-cream: The pie is thinner than their apple, so maybe order one for just yourself instead of sharing, because it is freaking delicious. It has nice luscious chunks of pumpkin in their pie, none of this is-this-babyfood-pumpkin-filling. My favorite thing here so far. Pumpkin icecream (house made): They serve their icecream with a graham cracker, which goes perfectly with their creamy, well-spiced, pumpkin-y icecream. You will want your own scoop. I am glad I didn't have the pumpkin icecream on top of the pumpkin pie, I think it would've been too much pumpkin pie spice, if that's even possible. Apple pie a-la-mode with vanilla ice-cream: The apple pie is very tall and filled to the brim with apples. The three of us could easily share a single slice. Really, their apple pie describes the entire vibe of the restaurant. It has this classically American feel with their quilted wall decorations and mismatching cloth napkins. I mean c'mon, their pie comes out of a cupboard! Apple cider: The hot apple cider goes perfectly with pie. Just be warned, it's very very very hot.

2012-09-24,2.0,"The Grange Hall Burger Bar is located in the west Randolph St. restaurant row area.  It consists of one plainly decorated dining room with communal tables and a small bar.  On a recent Saturday night our party of four dined there with me as a first-time customer.  We arrived around 9:00 p.m. without a reservation and, although the place was busy, we were seated immediately. Their spirits are extremely limited and all are obscure brands.  We all ordered a drink, and I found that the serving amount was extremely small and excessively expensive.  For instance, one drink was Valentine vodka from Detroit (the only vodka available) on the rocks that was served in a very small glass for $10.  Another drink was gin on the rocks that was half the volume of the vodka drink.  The amount was so meager that the recipient complained to the waitress who brought the drink back to the bar where a small amount of gin was added. I ordered a nine-ounce hamburger ($12.25) with bacon ($1) on rye bread that came with lettuce, tomato, and onion accompanied by a side of potato fries ($3.50).  The meat was cooked at the temperature I had requested and was good but not special.  The bread, however, was mediocre in quality and didn't hold up well.  Toward the end of the meal I was eating my burger with a fork and knife.  The fries were flavorful and well prepared.   My assessment of the Grange Hall Burger Bar is that the variety of spirits is too limited, the overall quality of the food is average, and the cost ($10 for a skimpy drink and $16.75 for a hamburger) much too high.  Unless you are attracted to the vibe of the area, I would advise going elsewhere for a hamburger and drinks.",-0.4049,0.921,0.033,0.046,0.42134575569358174

The hipster staff is young and clad in jeans and plaid, but manages to maintain an open and unpretentious attitude despite what one might expect at first glance.  They are surprisingly kid-friendly, with an eclectic collection of old-timey high-chairs and a drink menu offering fresh fruit lemonades to compliment the Midwestern farm aesthetic and communal tables. However, the kids menu is fairly limited - just a small burger or grilled cheese. My son was not a fan of the grilled cheese, but he did enjoy a plain toasted burger bun the server was gracious enough to bring on request. For starters, I have tended toward two dishes in particular: Farmhouse Chili Fries and Stella Bleu Cheese Fries. The chili fries stand out for their use of turkey chili and crisp raw onions. The dish comes off pleasantly fresh and clean rather than greasy and soggy. The bleu cheese version incorporates hot sauce and celery, bringing an unexpected, skewed Buffalo spice to the whole affair. Interesting and flavorful, but the spice can be a bit too intense for some. The burgers have never failed to disappoint. Offering 6 and 9 oz patties, the smaller size is ample and a refreshing in this age of portion distortion. A variety of cheeses and toppings means never having to have the same thing twice, and all of the ingredients come out fresh and packed with flavor. In total, each meal has left me feeling full and satisfied, and with the thought that the preceding burger may have been one of the best I've had, or at least in the top ten. Just beware -- prepare yourself for a somewhat hefty price tag. The quality does not come cheap, and you could easily expect to spend $50-$60 on burgers and beer for two.

GHBB serves up something a bunch of folks hate: communal seating without reservations. If there's one way to rile a crowd, it's to offer communal seating. I find that people have a general fear/disdain for talking to one another or getting to know each other and that's a real shame. I think it's part and parcel of why we're so disconnected as a people and why it's so easy to show cruelty to one another. Break bread with a stranger: it's good for society. So, the fact that GHBB forces you to sit with strangers while adorning the wall in urban barnyard chic went a long way with winning points with me. I wasn't over-the-moon with the price point, but it's the price (hyuck) you pay for living in the city. It is what it is. You can't take the advantages and then complain about what comes with when it comes to eating farm-to-table in the city. You want decent farm-to-table prices? Eat on a farm. I've done it (many times) and it's fantastic to eat so well for so little. But, The West Loop has about as much to do with farm life as Chicago Aldermen have to do with pristine ethics. Again, it is what it is. And, it's pretty delicious. Start with some booze. Know that the sticker shock will shock you. Numb yourself by imbibing. A tip: ask about the glassware in which the drinks are served. My Long Island (Strong Island?) came in a decently-sized glass. My Juniper drink looked more like a shot. The first pleased me. The second did not. Ask what you're getting. Or, just stick to beer. They have a decent selection and beer always pairs well with burgers. Feeling saucy from the sauce, I threw gastro-caution to the wind and ordered some chili cheese fries. I should have ordered them with my meal. As it was, I tried stretching them out until my 9 oz. turkey burger with cheese, onion, bacon, and pickle was ready. But, being that the food is prepared fresh-to-order, that wasn't such a good idea... and entirely my fault. I was pretty starved by the time I ate so I inhaled my burger. I'd contemplated getting the 6 oz but there's no way that would have been enough food. I over-titrated by ordering dessert. The ice cream of the evening was maple walnut bacon. It was so sweet and creamy, my stomach curdled a bit. I couldn't finish it and I am a dessert-eating pro. I could taste that this was homemade ice cream and, as a result, it was a bit too rich for my tastes. But, again, that's on me and not GHBB.  I admire what is it they're trying to do at GHBB. I like the fact that they're putting real effort into eating 'farmlike.' It's not just a schtick. The proof is in the pudding... or, the ice cream. Admittedly, I'd be prone to give it a 3.5 but wrt what they're doing, I'll round up for authenticity's sake. And, for Faygo in glass bottles.",0.9895,0.82,0.118,0.062,0.6001889644746787

The space is cute and cozy.  Cloth napkins and thrift store silverware are very charming.  I am not a fan of the communal tables though so I chose to eat at the bar.  We had some really good lemonade.  Peach lemonade and Cherry lemonade.  Not too sweet and still lemony but with a touch of peach/cherry flavor.  Little girl liked her burger of grass fed beef(yes!) with locally sourced veggies(yes!) and Wisconsin cheese.  My veggie burger with avocados and colby jack was delish.  It was a bit crumbly but chocked full of eggplant(I think) and broccoli.  But the star was definitely the dill pickle and the onion rings we ordered on the side.  Those onion rings.  I dream of them.  On a road trip we stopped at the world famous Varsity in Atlanta and had the lightest, crispiest onion rings.  I talk about making the drive to Atlanta for them.  No more!!  Grange Hall is down the street and those rings will be a normal character in my life. And as there is no ice cream parlor in the West Loop(Baskin Robbins does not count) we have already made the late night walk over just to get a scoop on a cone.  Yet to try the pie but since it is August(they have a rotating monthly pie menu) and blueberry pie is making its appearance I will be there soon.  Definitely a must try place for burger lovers and ice cream/pie lovers.",0.9836,0.833,0.129,0.038,0.5766203703703705

And I'm slightly glad it's not closer to my apartment because I would be here all.of.the.time. First, the decor reminds me of a restaurant in northern Wisconsin. That's not a knock against it at all. It's quaint, adorable, homey and simple with great touches and nuances around it for decor. From the bright table cloths to the mismatching napkins and rustic silverware. Even my dad loved agreed when we had lunch there and he loved it. Food. I've had the battered vegetables, which were amazingly good and still light without compromising taste or feeling like you're only eating batter. Nice mix of veggies within and the sauce that went with it was tasty. The second time we went, for the full meal, was even better. We got the the homemade lemonade, which was light and refreshing and a nice way to start the meal. The strawberry rhubarb was delicious and light. I got the 6oz beef patty with sesame poppyseed bun, white sharp cheddar, fried egg (but of course) and split a side of beer battered onion rings. Another tip: Grange Hall defaults to ""medium"" temp and that still has a dark pink center. As someone who prefers medium rare, this was the perfect temp for the meat. According to the waitress, the ""rare"" is VERY red, and probably borderline still alive inside. I'm not an onion rings fan but holy sh*t they were good. My dad, who is an onion rings aficionado took one bite and said, ""holy sh*t these are good."" AND THEY WERE. I would go back just for those. The burger was also really delicious and flavorful. I could only eat half (because we wanted pie) but I'm ridiculously excited about leftovers. And the pie. Changes monthly and is served with honest-to-god-serious ice cream rather than the lighter, more popular fro yo stuff. We got the tart cherry (being northern Wisconsin fans) and it was really good.

2012-07-07,2.0,"I went here yesterday for a last minute lunch with my sister. First, let me begin by stating that the food was fine. It was a decent turkey burger, decent fries and the special black cherry lemonade was good. I always try to eat organic, locally-sourced, yadda yadda food whenever possible. I spend an absurd amount of money on groceries each week to accomplish this. I write this simply to point to the fact that I'm not the type to bristle about price if I believe in the product and it tastes good.  However, I think this restaurant takes that ""concept"" a bit too far and uses as an excuse to charge an absurd amount of money for a pretty average lunch. Again everything was decent (not great and nothing I'd bother returning for) but I felt like a complete idiot paying $22 (incl. tax and tip) for a perfectly average burger, fries and a lemonade. Because of my absolute love for cherry pie I was so tempted to order it but I couldn't get past the fact that they were charging $7 for a SLICE of pie. Uh. No. Despite my insatiable sweet tooth I just couldn't fathom why a slice of ""homemade"" cherry pie would cost $7? I would rather just cross the street and go to Loretta's Bake Shop and get multiple ""homemade"" goodies for that price. In addition, doing so would have brought my lunch tally to $30 which I think is pretty unreasonable for lunch (unless you have a nice expense account). Not that I'm an expert on burgers or anything but I thought the burgers at Butcher and the Burger and even DMK were far superior. Even though those burgers are pricey, I think they're worth every delicious bite and I don't feel like a moron for paying more than anyone ever should for a burger. Also, there isn't an upcharge for every ""extra"" item. I think its obnoxious to charge extra for something as banal as carmellized onions or a slice of swiss cheese. Burger ""bars"" are a dime a dozen in Chicago and Grange is not good enough nor priced well enough to stand up to its competitors. I'd be shocked to see this place in business in the next few years.",0.993,0.799,0.161,0.041,0.5635978835978838

They offered many toppings but I went with very little so I could taste the meat, which had no flavor. It came with no sides, and the fries were okay. Nothing great. The condiments were also uninventive. Ketchup, mustard, mayo and thousand island dressing. Each topping was an additional dollar. Now for dessert. Did not have the pie, but I wondered why they used Homer's vanilla for their pies alamode, but had other flavors that were homemade. Also, two burgers, a glass of wine, 2 beers and two scoops of ice cream...$70.00 and parking was an additional $10.00. An evening of burgers and fries for $80+, even in Chicago thats ridiculous.

We had no wait and a pretty good waiter. They were reasonably quick with service and had a nice atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the fact that they added a cucumber slice to the water along with lemon: most refreshing. I ordered a 6 oz. burger with pepper jack and two scoops of their home-made ice cream. The burger had very little seasoning, but this allowed for the condiments to really get absorbed and influence the taste. They provide all the condiments separately: a spicy mustard, ketchup, mayo, sweet pickles, lettuce, onions, and tomato. They served the burger on delicious rye bread. The burger was plain and slightly undersized for the $10 price tag, but very enjoyable. I then finished off the meal with two scoops of ice cream: I came for the strawberry rhubarb walnut cheesecake and decided to try the peanut butter jelly ice cream as well. Two scoops were four dollars, and while the portions were not overly generous, the ice cream was well worth the price. I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of rhubarb taste in the former: it tasted very much like a strawberry shortcake flavored ice cream with no real tartness to it. However, the peanut butter jelly flavor was absolutely phenomenal. It was sweet and you could taste the peanut butter. What made this an absolute hit was the fact that they added bread crumbs to the top of the scoop of ice cream. This tasted like a very sweet peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Delicious!

The menu focuses on burgers, drinks and desserts which are hand made and/or locally sourced.  If you like a little pink to your burger, this is definitely the place to have it made medium rare since grass fed beef actually tastes like beef.  I've had both the turkey burger and the beef burger with fried egg and bacon and they were both top shelf. Sides were good - fries were large but thinly sliced which gave them a good salt and crispness. Onion rings were great - not soggy and paired amazingly with the home-made BBQ sauce. I read the bad reviews about mac and cheese so we stayed away from that. The only negative anyone in our group had to say was that they would have liked to see the cheese on the burgers melted, but it didn't stop anyone from enjoying the meal. Even though we were already full, we indulged in pretty much all of the desserts.  The rhubarb pie was a winner and the banana/chocolate/nut ice cream was also a crowd pleaser.   The ambience of the place  and serving ware definitely feels like you are having a home-cooked meal at Grandma's, which I think is what they were aiming for.  All around a nice restaurant with a simple but well-executed menu.  Not sure what more you could ask from a place that calls itself a burger bar.  Kuma's corner it isn't (and I do love their burgers) but you won't miss the hype/hour long wait to get a table.",0.9905,0.763,0.187,0.05,0.6075140809011778

Grange Hall's menu isn't anything exotic, but all of our food was consistently good.  My dinner companions each chose the beef Grange burger and I tried the turkey burger, which was actually very juicy and flavorful-- I didn't even miss the beef.  All burgers come with the standard veggies and condiments and then you can pick your own local cheeses and add-ons like avocado, bacon, and caramelized onions.  Sides are all a la carte-- the fries are the real deal: thick sliced, fried potatoes.  The decor is cute and super casual-- a very rustic farmhouse vibe with long community-style tables.  And the service is really above average even though they were totally slammed with customers.  My husband and I got to the restaurant a few minutes before our friend showed up and the restaurant was packed so I assumed they wouldn't seat us until he arrived.  But, the hostess said that if she didn't seat us right away we'd be waiting another 40 minutes so just go ahead and sit now and get a drink-- love it!  And they're honest-- I asked our server how the mac and cheese side was and she told me she preferred the baked Northern beans.  A great choice!

2012-05-03,4.0,"Grange Hall Burger is located in the West Loop in Chicago, and they describe themselves as ""a new farm-to-table philosophy for the humble burger."" I'm not exactly sure what that means, but their burgers are grass-fed as well as hormone and antibiotics-free, so it probably has something to do with that. The place looks like a barn, and you sit at communal tables which is also like barn. Wait, is it like a barn? I've never actually eaten at a barn. I assumed they use communal tables. Anyways, I guess it's all part of Grange Hall Burger's farm-to-table philosophy. It actually wouldn't look completely out of place if they had a live cow just wandering around the dining room. You pick a patty (beef, turkey, or wild rice vegetable), a size, and then you can add cheese and additional toppings for extra. I was tempted to just add every single thing available, but thought a $25 burger might be excessive. They bring the burger out open and with all the condiments on the side, to allow for maximum customization. I'm lazy so I wish they just threw everything together for me, but after getting past the exhaustive work of lifting a bun and putting it on another bun, I was delighted to find the burger to actually be pretty delicious. Everything is fairly traditional, so if you're looking for some wild innovations or crazy ingredients you're in the wrong place.

2012-04-21,4.0,"Been meaning to check out Randolph street's contribution to the Chicago burger scene for sometime now, and finally made it for lunch yesterday. The experience definitely had its ups and downs, but the ups prevailed by a long shot. Basically all I had was the burger, which for the most part was excellent. I ordered it medium-rare with the expectation they would overcook it to medium like most burger joints do; I was pleasantly surprised by a tender, slightly bloody patty (which is difficult to actually pull off with this patty, a somewhat thin six-ouncer). Major points for this. The burger itself was bursting with grass-fed flavor; definitely one of the higher quality patties I've had in the city. Toppings (superbly sharp white cheddar, lava-like fried egg, and housemade pickles) are all of the highest quality and complement the burger well. My one issue is with the bun; pedestrian to begin with, but to add insult to injury, it comes grilled to oblivion in a large amount of fat; this not-entirely-pleasant taste occasionally overpowers the mild flavor of the beef, which is unfortunate. Also, the baked beans are far too sweet for my personal taste, but the addition of fennel is a welcome change from the norm.  Pricing is, well, steep (I paid $19 after tax and tip for all of the above), but I've paid the same at several places for far worse ""gourmet"" burgers. The service is pretty decent. All in all, this was a pleasant experience; I waffled between giving it 3 or 4, but rounded up because they respect the beef.

2012-03-16,4.0,"When we saw this place was moving into the Veerasway location, we thought it seemed like an almost comically out-of-place concept for Randolph Street. Down-home country-style cooking, in a BARN, right next to Maude's? We finally ate there on a Thursday night, and really enjoyed it. Somehow it just kind of works, and they seem to have a good vibe going now that they've worked out the service kinks. (p.s., I think Yelp should not allow reviews within 3 weeks of opening. Of course there are going to be some issues right after opening.) Anyway, we thought that the decor really feels authentically rustic, rather than some decorator's idea of rustic. Again, what a risk to go for that on Randolph. The food was really good, though the menu choices are a little limited. The standout was the key lime pie. My wife had a bite and just shut up for about 30 seconds, and then said ""this takes me to a different place."" Yes, it was that good; now I feel threatened by a piece of pie.  The real secret to this place, based on what we saw, is that it's kid-and-family friendly without being a turn-off to couples or singles. There were 5 families with kids in there when we were there, and the kids were all talking to each other and having a blast (the communal tables help with this). There are so many families moving into the West Loop, and there aren't really many restaurants that they can take kids to.

2012-03-14,3.0,"So my boyfriend and I go to this place a lot. Like twice a week. We loved it when we first found it (when it first opened) Over the past month things have been slipping quite a bit. First of all, the waitstaff is really hipster which means they wait like 10 minutes while your food gets cold at the pass, and expect you to eat a cold burger. Granted, whenever I've complained that the burger is cold, they take it back, re-do it, and give me some chips and dip while I'm waiting. That is nice. (hence the extra star). However this is starting to happen every single time I eat there. They also say that they cook their burgers medium rare, but I am almost always given a medium well burger. What's that all about. This is always after they give me a cold burger, so I'm not too eager to send the second one back as well.  Now the real reason I'm deciding to write this unfavorable review now is because last night my boyfriend (who always gets the vegetarian burger), got horrible food poisoning. Granted, it might not be the fault of this place. Though it suspiciously seems so. He didn't eat anything since breakfast (we had the same breakfast), he felt great all day, he ate the burger at Grange hall and 5 hours later BAM, he's violently throwing up all night. Of course, there's still a chance its not the fault of  Grange hall, but, when I called them to let them know that he was ill after eating there, the manager told me that there was no way it was there fault because ""food poisoning never shows up for 24-48 or even 72 hours."" Now that is patently false. Food poisoning can happen as early as four hours after eating. While pleasant on the phone, I did feel like I was being brushed aside. So, all in all, we will not be going back there, since the price doesn't match the quality of their service and ultimate presentation of the food. Though if you do go there - get the chips and dip - those are truly fantastic. ****Review Update*** The business owner contacted me, and I was at first hesitant to call her, but just did it. It turned out that she was truly concerned about the possible food poisoning incident, and we went through everything my boyfriend ate to try to find the culprit. She also addressed the wait-staff concerns, and let me know that the issue of food-sitting-at-the-pass-getting-cold would hopefully be ameliorated by the new addition (yesterday) of a food runner. This business owner / chef is truly dedicated to her project, and I'm very glad that she is, since I had such hopes for the place (and it's around the corner from me). When I get back in town, I will try it out again. Until then, I urge you to try it out too - and don't be afraid to let them know you don't like the way your food is coming out, because they will fix it for you.",0.9757,0.787,0.131,0.081,0.5038213770356627

2012-03-10,3.0,"I'm conflicted about this place. On our first visit, there was much to like and a few things that are off. First, we had about a 20 min wait for 2 on Saturday night at 7:00. That's totally reasonable on a Saturday night in that neighborhood, especially for a new place that's getting a lot of buzz. We had a couple of drinks from the bar while we waited. I got a Bee's Knees cocktail, which was OK. The description on the menu wasn't quite what I ended up with, but it wasn't bad. Probably just a disconnect on my expectations vs. the menu description. Also a bit overpriced for such a tiny cocktail (served in the same glasses used in my college cafeteria.) We started with the fried veggie basket. They're tempura fried and I liked the light breading but they were a bit greasy. The horseradish mayo dipping sauce saves them from being too bland, it's fantastic (and homemade). Otherwise these are just OK fried veggies and the grease got to me after several bites. One of the problems is the pricing of the burgers. Once you choose from a 6oz or 9oz burger, condiments like mustard, ketchup, mayo are free (as are the very tasty house made pickles) but anything else is $1.00 extra per item. It adds up quickly. And bacon is $2 extra PER SLICE. I love bacon on my burger, but damn! With that pricing, they've guaranteed I'll NEVER order bacon on my burger there.  So do the math - my boyfriend orders a burger ($9.00) then adds jalapeno, fried egg, cheese and fried onion. Now it's a $13 burger.  Add a side, and now it's a $16 meal. I get that it's locally sourced, etc. And I get that they need to turn a profit. But at the end of the day, it's a burger and there's a limit to what I want to pay for it.  it kind of felt like I was being nickel & dimed a bit, which is not how you want customers to feel. $2 per piece on bacon is a very nice profit margin. (I'm already considering making my own at home, taking with me in a baggie and sneaking it onto my burger once I'm there.) I opted for basic, just ketchup, mayo (which is made in house - bonus points) and cheese. Sides are $3 extra. I'd love to tell you the fries are good, but they RAN OUT of potatoes. At 7:30p on a Saturday night. This is a burger place - dudes, seriously, how do you run out of fries, you have to know it's the most popular side you offer (especially when your portions are not that big)? There's a Dominick's down the street, send someone there when you see you're running low. So our sides were onion rings (fine) and baked beans with fennel (amazingly good).  The default temp for the burgers is medium-rare, which is how it should be as far as I'm concerned. They arrived perfectly cooked - nice bit of crispy char on the edges, dark pink to red in the center. My boyfriend said his was also perfectly cooked, including the fried egg, which is tricky, so he was impressed. I was also happy with the 6oz size. I prefer a slightly smaller burger than most places serve, I feel like it's harder to deliver a nicely cooked burger when they start to get too big. The burger really tasted like the ones my great-grandma made me when I was a kid. We split a piece of pie, lemon cheesecake (there's a different flavor every month). It was delicious, it tasted like someone's Grandma was baking them in the back. I'm picky about pie and I'd go back just for a piece of pie. The service was very friendly and efficient, especially given how busy they were. The manager stopped by to ask how our meal was and apologized for our wait (which wasn't a big deal at all, we'd expected it). The decor is cute, although I could live without the plastic trays they deliver the food on. There's kitchy and there's tacky - ugly brown plastic trays are tacky. And sticky.  So, the conflict. The burger is good, but way overpriced. All the extras start to add up quickly. We'll definitely go back but we'll skip the cocktail and veggie basket (maybe try the homemade chips and onion dip instead). Hopefully they'll actually have fries next time. And I'll keep my burger basic to keep the price down. But we'll definitely save room for pie. And from reading other reviews, the ice cream sounds good and I'd like to try it.

2012-02-29,4.0,"After spending some time across the street for cocktails, the bff and I were ready for something to eat. Having seen Grange Hall from the outside (it looks like a barn!), we were excited to see what the inside looked like. As expected, the inside of the restaurant also looks like the inside of a farmhouse. Dishware is all mix and match and tables are long, dining-room style tables. We were seated at the same table as another group.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly. We started with the fried veggie appetizer. I personally loved the zucchini and mushrooms. The green beans and onions were very good too. The dipping sauce that accompanied them was quite tasty too. For dinner, my friend and I split the 6 oz burger and got the fries and mac & cheese as sides.  I love the way the burgers are served here. They recommend medium-rare so that's what we ordered. It was juicy and the meat was great. It was served with small cups of homemade pickles, mustard, ketchup and mayo on a vintage tray. Tasted like a very well made homemade burger. The fries were more like steak fries. They were crispy and salty and delicious. The mac & cheese wasn't as garlic-y as advertised, but it was very good nonetheless. Overall, I may have enjoyed the overall atmosmosphere of Grange Hall more than the food itself. I was treated like I was at home-great food, great service and a great atmosphere overall.

2012-02-24,1.0,"I am so disappointed by the dining experience my husband and I had this evening and I was really, really looking forward to this place. The only good thing I can say is that they put a lemon slice and a cucumber slice in my water.  We started with a $7 salad. For that price I expect more then just a side salad portion. The few grapes, orange slice and walnuts they add does not make this salad worth $7. I ordered a medium well burger with sharp cheddar cheese for an extra $1 and avocado for $1 extra. When my burger arrived there was a huge piece of lettuce covering my whole plate. Now I can appreciate a lot of greenery on my burger but this presentation was horrible and the lettuce was soggy after putting a hot burger on top of it. The avocado slice I paid $1 for was more of a sliver and had some brown spots; the top of my bun was placed on my tray (gross!) and the bun was cracked on the side; they put a napkin on the plate under the burger (I don't know what for) but that just ended up getting soggy from burger juice; and the condiments that come on the side were not fresh - the mustard had a thin hardened layer on top from sitting out too long. But my biggest complaint was that my medium well burger was not cooked how I ordered it, it was much closer to rare than medium well.  When our waitress, who was friendly enough, came to check on us she apologized but didn't quite know what to say or do. She said that she wasn't sure if the kitchen would cook it more since I already took a bite out of it (good god I hope they wouldn't dismantle my once-biten burger, try cooking it again and then give it back to me to eat!). Then she said that she would have to show the kitchen and her manager, like she had to get their approval first before taking action because they might look at the burger and decide that I was being silly and should just eat it how they cooked it rather than how I ordered it. I would have preferred her just apologize, take the burger back to the kitchen because it was obviously under cooked and get me a new burger. That should be the protocol. My husband likes his burgers rare and even his was pretty undercooked for his tastes. So.......we waited. We waited for my burger and for the onion rings that never came out the first time. We waited much longer than we should have before the soggy onion rings (yes, soggy and not at all crispy) arrived and my second medium well burger arrived. Unfortunately, it was another epic failure on Grange's part- the burger was once again pink throughout the whole patty and now charred on top. I couldn't even eat it. But I hated being that person, so I tried picking around to find some cooked part but by that time the whole experience had been ruined. When our waitress came by again to ask how everything was I had to be honest that it just wasn't good at all. She was very apologetic. The manager came over to apologize as well. He took the burger off our bill and offered to buy us dessert but we declined. As kind of a gesture as it was a free dessert wasn't going to make up for a ruined meal.  I'm sorry Grange Hall but I won't be back. Maybe a better beer list would entice me to give you another try, but even your cute decor can't bring me back. There's a lot of burger places in the city and Grange doesn't stack up to the competition. I'll just have to add a lemon slice and cucumber slice to my water at home.",0.9897,0.829,0.117,0.054,0.50141835016835
2012-02-20,1.0,"This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. I was accused of lying about my order, harassed by my server and the manager who raised their voices at the group, and chased us out of the restaurant. Why? Because I ordered a $9 turkey burger, and the server got it wrong. Our group of five came in on a Saturday for burgers and drinks. The service was pretty bad to begin with, meaning he would disappear for awhile and return without our drinks. However, we were having a good time and looked past that.  Now, really the only thing you can order here is a beef burger, turkey burger, or a vegetarian Burger. Our whole group ordered beef burgers, except me. I asked for a turkey burger. The burgers took over a half hour to come out, and we were hungry by the time they arrived! Well, two bites and I said, ""Wait! This is beef."" I waited patiently for our server to check-in, so I can ask for a turkey burger (which is what I asked for). He never came back, until someone else had cleared everyone plates. I told him that he had brought me the wrong item, and since everyone was done, I no longer wanted a burger. He was confused and thought someone else had eaten the turkey burger. We told him that no one had been given my turkey by mistake.  The bill came, and he charged us for 5 beef burgers. Now, I had two bites and was not willing to pay for his mistake. He came over, and we asked for the burger to be taken off the bill. Remember, this is a $9 burger. He said that I had ordered beef, not turkey, accusing me of lying. He interrogated everyone in the group about what I had ordered. Once they confirmed that I had ordered turkey, he then accused me of eating the entire thing. Two bites does not equate a whole burger. It escalated into the manager coming over, both of them raising their voices at me and my group. ""Are you sure you ordered a turkey burger?"" ""So, you ate the whole thing, even though you didn't order it?"" ""Are you sure?"" It went on for 20 minutes! It was almost comical. I mean, all of this for a $9 burger? And why are you YELLING at me? As we were leaving, the server followed us out, talking loudly about his disappointment in the tip. Really? Then the manager grabbed my friend, put his arm around him, and started to follow him out to ""talk about this"". We shrugged them off, and practically ran out. This was the most disrespectful and unprofessional experience I've ever had. I was shocked that a server would call the customer a liar, and a manager would raise their voice at a customer while accusing them of lying. All over a $9 burger. And then to chase us out?

Our server, Adrien, was attentive and had some good recommendations. At a few points during the meal, I mentioned that it seemed like the kitchen was pretty slow in getting food out -but, when the bill came and it was $50 for the aforementioned food, it definitely made sense that the pace of the services was likely intentionally slower than need be, because I don't think a lot of people would be tremendously keen on spending $50 for a burger, side, and a beer and being in and out in 15 minutes ...

Somehow, three of us ended up paying $75 for burgers, fries, fried vegetables and a few beers. So, here's the deal: it's not cheap, and let's get a grip: these are burgers. The hipsters drinking Schlitz are an odd component, but I chalk that up to it being West Randolph. The seating is funky and weird--communal and uncomfortable with low seats.

A quality product may leave you full, but just doesn't sit like a greasy wad in the belly. This was great quality stuff. WHile my burger came out over cooked, due to the juiceness, it was still very good at mid well to well ( I had ordered mid rare). They offered to bring a new one very graciously, but because it was so juicy even well done, I was perfectly content. One suggestion....please melt the cheese under a broiler. That's purely personal, but I like melted cheese on my burger. I didn't mention it, but I am sure they would have happily taken it back to melt it for me had I asked.

2012-01-25,3.0,"This review is rated V for Vegetarian. I wasn't really sure what to expect when trudging through the snow past the likes of Girl & the Goat and Sushi Wabi to a white, sided doorway. The interior of the restaurant was not what I expected on this trendy stretch of restaurant row; in my head, I envisioned a much larger space, but liked the cozy feel. The inside is dark, simple, and country; not yee-haw, Toby Keith country, but 'my grandma lives on a farm, quilts and makes jam country.' A large, black, 3-d steer silhouette is the focal point of the one wall. A long counter, more apt for dining than drinking lines the other. In between are five family-style wood tables that seat 8 people each. I loved the little touches like the mismatched plates and flatware, but I would like to see them ditch those cafeteria-style trays.  I was part of a large group, 17 in all at two tables, and felt like our meal moved at a ""country pace"" which was fine at first, but as we approached the three hour mark, this city girl started to get a bit twitchy. Our table started out with beverages and three of the four appetizers. Hopped up on cold medicine, I opted for iced tea, but drooled over my dining companion's Hound Dogs - vodka, fresh grapefruit juice and brown sugar. I would come back just to try this drink, served with a wedge of grapefruit. I tried two of the three appetizers we ordered - the grilled vegetable basket and the old fashioned chips and dip. Of the two, I preferred the veggies paired with a tasty garlic mayo. I found the chips disappointing and fragile and the dip, with diced onions too big to scoop up - unmemorable. I went with the homemade wild rice veggie burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and bleu cheese. Overall, I was disappointed with my burger. Not only was it messy, falling all over my napkin and plate, but it was bland save for the bleu cheese and ketchup. While I truly appreciate a veggie option, it needs work (read: zing) to bring it on par with its meaty compatriots. I also think they should offer topping combo deal, like $2 for any 3-$1 toppings. At $9 to start, a burger (without side) can get expensive once you start adding premium toppings. To accompany my burger, I ordered the hand cut fries. The fries are cut in thin, steak fry-like wedges; they were crispier than I would have liked, if I return I'd opt for something else. For dessert, I opted for some fresh churned ice cream - the walnut chocolate chip cookie. Served with hot fudge and with chunks of walnuts and cookie peppering the ice cream, this was by far my favorite part of the meal and the perfect way to wrap it up. Even if you're full - make room for ice cream! Our server was extremely friendly and attentive to our large party. When our meal lagged, he proactively gave us updates. Unfortunately, there were still a few diner's that got their burgers well after most had finished without so much as an offer to comp a side, appetizer, etc. for the inconvenience. The only other hiccup was unexpectedly receiving one bill for our two tables, which was extremely tedious to settle up. Since we were basically treated as two parties throughout the meal, one per table would've been ideal.  Bottom line: 3.5 stars. Don't let the name confuse you, this burger hall has plenty to satisfy veggies and meat eaters alike. I'd definitely give it another chance, but this time with a smaller party. Not to sound antisocial, but I don't think their kitchen is well suited to serving large groups. I also might skip the burger and stick to Hound Dogs and ice cream with a side thrown in for variety.",0.9967,0.817,0.138,0.046,0.5832257196663977
2012-01-23,5.0,"Grange Hall Burger Bar won me over.*  Fine, maybe I was set to like this place as soon as I stepped in based on the decor and atmosphere, maybe not.  I'll be back though! Things I found charming: * Quilts on the wall (cut off pieces of quilts?)  As popular as that style is, it reminds me of a few homes, including mine, which make me think ""cozy"".   * Communal seating.  There are some places this doesn't work and if you have a large party, you're clearly going to wait due to the seating, but it works for them.   * Servers/staff have a laid-back, yet clean cut look to them.  It reminds me of the farm, without being TOO farm.  (My mom is from some small town, I'm familiar with farms.) * The worn spoons that accompanied the ice cream.   Things I liked: * You can see into the kitchen.  I'm not one of those people who is worried about my food being tainted, but I do like being able to see into a kitchen.     * Family friendly.  While we were waiting for our table, I noticed a few children ranging in ages from tiny and in a car seat to, some age in middle school.  This doesn't mean it was loud and you won't be able to enjoy your meal, it just means that you can bring your kid.....and hopefully they won't make you ""that guy"".   * They carry beer from Wild Onion.  I just discovered this brewery not too long ago and have a hard time finding it, both in stores and at bars.   Now that that's out of the way, I was part of a LARGE party and I thought our server was great.  Sure, there were a few mistakes, but he was always very apologetic and rectified the problem right away.  Plus, they were small mistakes.  Seriously, I thought he did a great job and as an added bonus, our guy knew how to pour beer!  This may seem like a small thing, but I've had servers pour beer after insisting they do it only to have a bad pour.   The food was perfect.  Perhaps it's because I didn't eat all day (fine, I ate some movie popcorn, I confess).....but I don't usually finish meals or get dessert.  Looking around at my table, I'm pretty sure everyone finished their food.  They cook their burgers medium rare, if I remember correctly, and I ordered mine medium well.  Most places will over cook it, most likely because I'm the ass ordering a burger medium well, but I thought this was great.  Juicy, flavorful and I could actually fit the burger in my mouth.  The carmelized onions were so good that I ate the ones that didn't make it on my burger.  Fries were nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  The mac & cheese was some of the best I've had.  I don't like my mac & cheese overly creamy and this was just right.  The fried veggies..while I didn't try the sauce, I thought they were pretty darn good.  Not too much batter, not overly soft veggies.  Not sure of what the others thought, but I know my friend and I really liked them.  Lastly, one scoop of walnut chocolate chip ice cream.  Mmmm, mmm, mmm!   I'm definitely a fan and will be bringing friends and family here.  I will say though, there is potentially one drawback and it only applies to certain people.  If you're tall, I'd caution getting a counter seat as the stools (and counter) are kind of low.  I'm only 5'3"", so this wouldn't be a problem for me, but I did see one guy kind of hunched over when eating and arching his back from time to time.  Just something to consider for you tall folk.  Other than that, I was impressed.  Oh, and the bathrooms (well, the women's) was very nice.  Decent size, clean and plenty of mirrors.   I'll admit, when I first looked at the menu I thought ""a dollar per extra ingredient?!"", but when I thought about it, most places I get the extra stuff on (avocado, cheese, carmelized onions, etc) tack that into the price and give it a fun name.  $12 is what I'm paying elsewhere, why not pay it for a delicious grass fed burger?  Their beer was $6.  Not bad, not bad at all.   * I noticed I was 2 reviews from #200 when I started this one and while I normally wouldn't care about such things, I thought, let's save this one for one I really, really liked.  I also broke my ""no check-ins"" rule for this place.  200th review AND 1st check-in?  I liked you Grange Hall, I really, really liked you!",0.9991,0.73,0.205,0.065,0.5779829545454545

(But isn't it a pretty small place with a pretty basic menu --burgers; I assumed that the restaurant could manage the burger demand in the place).  Unimpressive BURGER.  The burgers finally arrived and were actually tepid or room temperature at best.  Seriously after this long of a wait!  I ordered my burger medium (which usually means still some pink but juices run clear).  My room-temperature burger didn't have a trace of pink in it...gray all the way.  I also didn't get the bacon I ordered on my burger either.  While we were waiting, I watched them making the burgers and don't really understand how they can get behind. They don't put the cheese on the burger until after it's cooked (thus no melted cheese), and all the additional condiments come on the side.  So there isn't much back of house preparation going on for these burgers.   Mac & Garlic.  I would recommend not getting the garlicky Mac 'n Cheese.  It should be called Mac & Garlic.  It tastes like butter, garlic and macaroni.  Zero cheese taste and overall pretty bland except for the overwhelming garlic.   Expensive PRICE.  The bill for our four burgers a couple rounds of drinks was another $130.  Total for the night with tips was $300 for the four of us....a bit more than I was expecting for going out for just burgers (and room temperature burgers nonetheless).  BUT the condiments...ketchup, mustard, and mayo are free!  But if you like more than a tablespoon of ketchup, you'll need to let them know because that is all the condiments you get with your burger.   There are too many other good burger options in Chicago so I won't be going back to this one (even if it is really convenient to where I live).  DMK is a good example of a burger joint that can crank out GREAT tasting burgers and move the crowds quickly.  Urban Burger is another place where the taste of the burgers is far ahead of this place.",0.9824,0.873,0.091,0.036,0.5329861111111112

2012-01-15,4.0,"i have to say, i really love this new burger joint.  love the concept and style. unlike what some other yelpers have said, i quite enjoy the quaint, town-hall-type feel with communal seating and barn styling.  generally i'm not the biggest fan of communal seating, but when you're talking about a casual, farm-to-table burger place, it just kinda feels right.  now on to the food: mmmm good. their burger is one of my favs in a while.  i've been here twice now and both times had a pretty traditional burger (just cheese, ketchup, mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato). the second time we went i thought about trying a diff burger, but ultimately decided i like what i had the first time so much that i wanted to get it again. their sides are also great: - i love their fries - perfectly crispy yet so soft in the middle. yum, yum, yum. - i also really love their mac and cheese. its definitely not for everyone, as it's kinda dry and not very cheesy. i personally love that though. and the garlicy seasoning....mmmmmmm! - their pies?!!! yes! i've had the pumpkin and the lemon cheese pie. both were perfect. the pieces are kinda small, but so yummy.  love the selection of midwest drinks too.  i'll definitely be back. and often.

2012-01-05,1.0,"I decided to check out this place because of a good review from a friend and also because of it's convenient location (half a block away from my apt).  Don't bother with this place! It will be out of business in 6 months.  When we walked in, it was pleasant enough, and I don't mind the communal dinning, but the tables were so weak and flimsy, that the guy cutting his food at the other end of the table was shaking it badly enough to spill my water.  I think the decor is cute although, almost annoyingly trendy. I can think of at least 4 places in the immediate vicinity that have very similar styles.The mismatched napkins and old silverware are nice details, but again a bit kitchy.  When our food came, the kitchen had forgotten half of my order (including the cheese that was supposed to come on my burger) so I had to wait till that arrived. Not to mention, of course the cheese was cold and didn't melt because of that. Also, I like my burger on the rare side of mid-rare and I informed the server of that, unfortunately, my burger was mid-well. The meat was good quality, but the temp just kinda ruined it for me. Oh and lets not forget that I paid close to 15 bucks for this measly burger. My boyfriend had the dinner special which was the turkey sloppy joes. I tried a bite and had to give it right back. The turkey tasted REALLY game-y. It was almost like they had used old turkey. Not pleasant.  And don't bother with the $3 garlic-y mac & cheese that doesn't even taste like cheese. I actually got a doggy bag for it, so I could take it home and fix it up myself (it needed help!). So overall, this place had good service, ok ambiance, but the food was terrible!

One star is for convenience to where I live, and the other is for the tasty meat.  While the 'Fresh off the Farm' theme isn't a bad one...  This spot is simply not memorable.  Its vibe is almost as weak as their Iced Tea - which was 3 bucks.  Another 2 dollars for a super rubbery piece of bacon (yes - just one piece).  Another buck for cheese, 3 more for a dozen fries and 12 for the patty...  Bringing the burger and fries combo up to 20 - which is getting to be too much.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to pay that - if I'm happy to pay that!  ya feel me?   I like to dine according to the 3 strikes moniker...   And Grange Hall racked up more like 5.   They got a strike for terrible tea (I like my tea).  Strike two came with the communal dining.   Bacon was krep...  Strike 3.  Prices blow.  And (perhaps the most gut gurgling of them all) NO RANCH!  This problem seems to be common across the Burger Bar scene in Chicago - and its a sad, sad thing.   You'd think that a Farm themed place would embrace some fluppin buttermilk ranch, but no...   On a positive note - the burger itself wasn't bad at all.  Quality for sure, and the bun was great.  They cook med-rare unless you say otherwise - which can become mushy and flavorless in the middle, but theirs was purty good.  And I dig their support of local stuff like cheeses and wine and such. They could have pulled me back for a second chance - with a warm farewell.  But, that didn't happen.  After passing and making eye contact with a couple servers, a manager and the bartender without any ""have a great night,"" or ""thanks guys, see ya next time...""  I'm fine with not going back.    In fact, I don't even remember where it is;)",0.9942,0.757,0.188,0.056,0.5552669552669554

So your total could be upward of $16 for a burger. Now, I get that it's from a local farm, but damn.  I do have to say it is a tasty burger and their homemade fries are delicious. I agree with some of the other people that the mac and cheese was a little dry but it still was good. They have some fun options for the burger as well. My friend got a huge slab of blue cheese with jalapenos.  The drinks were also really good, nice cute ""country"" style choices.  Now... the Ice Cream.. OMG SO GOOD. I got a vanilla shake to split and we couldn't finish it was so rich. But it was really good. Nothing better than homemade Ice cream.

2011-12-28,4.0,"This place reminds me of my mom's hometown in Kansas! It was just kitsch-y enough and our server Maura was a delight. I had been dying to try this place because I LOVE hamburgers and most restaurants in the West Loop. Because of its location, it had a lot to live up to but I am very happy to report that I was very pleased with my experience. My friend and I sat next to a sweet young family with an adorable little girl, so we weren't bothered by the communal dining experience. I realize that's not everyone's thing, but I was two drinks in thanks to Maude's next door, so I was pretty ""happy"" by the time I stepped in to Grange Hall. I ordered the Grass Fed beef burger with egg, caramelized onions, and swiss cheese on their fabulous poppy and sesame seed bun. It was large and in charge, just like I am going to be if I keep eating there! I also had the side of garlic mac and cheese. There was a lot of garlic, which was a little overpowering, and I could have used a bit more cheese. But it was still delicious. For dessert, I ordered the bacon ice cream. If that's on the menu, I will order it. I'm like a moth to the flame. I love the sweet and salty taste of bacon ice cream. The vanilla base was rich and creamy, a perfect canvas for the salty bits of bacon.  I'm sure I will bring my parents to this place at some point because it will remind them of home. I happen to like little kitsch-y bits of decor in my life so Grange Hall was just perfect for me.

2011-12-17,5.0,"Been here twice now and I believe this establishment may very well serve up the finest unadulterated burger anywhere. When I say unadulterated I am referring to a straight up classic-style burger not topped with all sorts of unruly ingredients like fried onion rings, pork bellies, and other things of the sort. Not that I have a problem with unruly ingredients on my burgers as I very much enjoy Kumas, DMK, and Burger Bar (at north/halsted) but sometimes you just want a daaamn good burger in its purest form. Folks, I'm saying this is for sure the place to get that. All the way down from the melt in your mouth tender grass-fed beef (even at medium well), to the ridiculously good poppy seed & sesame buns which are toasted to the point of offering a similiar texture and flavor to the outside of a grilled cheese sandwich, and the masterful selection of cheeses available for the picking, this is a true winner in my book. As for the rest of the menu, who cares since the choice of what to get is quite obvious. The onion rings are great as a side, fries are really good, don't care for the Mac and cheese so much (although I've already been challenged on that). The pies are also really good. Had the pecan pie twice now and will do it again if I make it over again before the end of december before they switch up to January's pie (pies switch up every month). Homemade ice cream there is also great - looking forward to trying a shake at some point in the future as well. I suppose my only complaint is that they dont have the largest or greatest selection of beers. Their theme on that is local and they do have Bells (which is good) but they should really take it to the next step and bring on the 3 Floyd's (Alpha King in particular).  Oh yeah, I notice that some other reviewers weren't crazy about the communal tables (which I'm not big on either) but this place is all about the burger (at least for me). The ambiance is pretty neat with a Midwest country living room type of style. Honestly I dont love it nor do I hate it. I do like that its chilled out and that I can hear what the person sitting across from me is saying - sometimes that goes a long way.",0.9968,0.771,0.186,0.043,0.5233187134502922
2011-12-11,5.0,"I can't speak to the complaints that others may have, I totally dig what they are serving up at Grange Hall Burger Bar.   It's a unique spin on the farm to table concept.  After finding myself in Sushi Wabi, no that's the wrong door, a barn door like entrance led me into what felt like Aunt Bea's kitchen.  I found my friends at the end of the bar at what looked like a soda fountain shop with a few old school milk shake stations.   After we caught up and I apologized for running late (I don't feel tardy) we grabbed a few vacant seats near the front at the end of a long wooden communal table.  The  farmhouse vibe is all in here with touches like simple homey decor, plaid shirts and even the farmer's daughter type server we had with the great smile.  I'm typically not a fan of the communal seating.  But, it works here and it was easy to deal with.  It also allows them to get everyone seated rather quickly as this is sure to be yet another popular destination in the best restaurant row of the city.  My friend turned Shazam app was in a zone nailing just about every 70s tune we heard after just a few bars like she was cruising to an easy win on Stump The Booey.  Grange Hall is proud of their meat, and rightly so.  Options include grass fed beef (hormone and antibiotic free), free range turkey and veggie and legume burgers.  We opted for the entry level burger (6 oz) instead of the impressive 9 oz monster burger.  The kitchen serves them up at medium rare.  Yes!  Finally a burger place that gets it right.  Please don't burn your meat.  You'll be scared for life.  Burgers should be bloody as hell, just like at Jack Rabbit Slim's.   We were all pretty hungry and ready to eat.  We began with the fried veggie basket that included mushrooms, onion rings, zucchini and green beans.  They were tempura fried, which was a different spin and served with a dipping sauce that added a nice zing.  Our burgers and sides arrived just as we were wrapping up the apps.  These looked like burgers that you might have cooked on your own backyard grill.  I got mine with white cheddar and fried egg, lettuce and tomato.  This is the part of my review where it becomes useful.  Unless you are allergic or despise egg, get it on a burger every time you see it.  It's a simple thing, that when done right sets it apart from other burgers.  And they nailed it here.  The egg was perfectly cooked and runny.  It needed none of the mustard or ketchup that I was brought, it was just perfect as is.  We got most of the sides offered: mac and cheese, beans, rings and wedges.  The wedges were my favorite, though it should be noted that the portion was rather small.  So, if you are looking for a Five Guys like satchel, order a few.   We enjoyed it all and though stuffed easily found room for dessert.  This is another strong point of GH for me.  Homemade desserts that include monthly pies, ice cream and freshly made milkshakes.  We got chocolate and peanut brittle ice cream (the peppermint sounded good too) and we loved them both.   We had a great time here.  They've got a decent beer selection, though sadly no taps.  Word is that they will be serving up breakfast soon and I can't wait for that.  The new kid on the block is unique and off to a fine start.  A perfect medium rare that is done well.",0.9977,0.776,0.173,0.05,0.620804240562305
2011-12-11,2.0,"I wanted to like this place, but there are so many reasons why I don't. And that makes it a solid two star review for me. I definitely like their farm to table concept. Eating locally and sustainably has become more important to me in the past few years. And the decor is right on point with a very farmhouse, homey theme, right down to the staff's uniform of plaid shirts and jeans. Unfortunately, that's all I love about Grange Hall.  We waited for 2 hours for a table. With 6 people in our party, I realize that it was more difficult to seat us due to their communal dining style (which is my least favorite dining trend right now), but the host kept telling us 20 minutes, and then 20 minutes again, etc. etc., all the while seating other parties that came in after us. Not cool.  Once we finally! sat down, we ordered pretty quickly. We got the Fried Vegetable Basket and the Old-Fashioned Chips and Dip for appetizers, and 4 of us also ordered burgers. The dip that came with the veggies wasn't very good. I can't really explain it, but I ended up just eating the veggies without the sauce. The chips and dip were actually pretty tasty. The chips were obviously freshly made and the dip was a homemade version of the onion dip reminiscent of childhood picnics.  Next, the burger. The ingredients were certainly high quality, and it tasted good, but it just wasn't the be all end all of burgers. Plus, it was really hard to eat because it was SO MESSY. The one person at our table who had the most success not losing all their meat and toppings out the other side of the bun didn't cut his in half. My husband and I also shared sides of the fries (really delicious crispy steak fries) and the mac and cheese (super dry and DISGUSTING).  Lastly, it was so insanely loud in there that we all had to yell to be heard. I think half the times our waitress came by to check on us, she left frustrated because no one heard a word she said.

Extras on the burger, like cheese or mushrooms, are $1 a piece and can add up quickly. We also got the fries, which were very tasty and large. For $3 dollars, however, you should get more than 5 french fries.

2011-12-04,3.0,"I can't give this place more than three stars.  It's always great news when a restaurant opens in my neighborhood. After reading the stellar reviews on Yelp, I had to check it out.  Not surprisingly, it was packed on Friday night. We waited about ten minutes to get a table. I hoped for seats at the bar, as I really dislike communal seating. I can live with it, but such seating arrangements can make it difficult to talk to your dining partner with any privacy. Opt for the bar seats. Not only are they are more ""intimate"", you'll also get better service since there's always someone behind the bar (and your waiter doesn't stray far from the area either). Carnivores are going to hate me for this, but I had their wild rice vegetable burger. I appreciate GHBB for offering a veggie burger option, but it was a major fail. The buns and fixings were ace, but the patty was just horrible. I took one bite of it and half of the patty fell out of the other side. It was mushy and had no density or flavor. It was one of the worst I've had. A little char and firmness would improve the burger greatly. The garlic mac and cheese was average. It was dry, but some people prefer that over melty, gooey mac and cheese. I loved the french fries. They had the crispiness of french fries and some softness of steak fries; a good hybrid. Ketchup and other condiments aren't available by bottle. They bring them out in small sauce cups, which can be a little annoying if two tablespoons of ketchup isn't enough for your burger. After feeling a little disappointed by the main course, I ordered their vanilla peanut brittle ice cream (a seasonal flavor) with fudge sauce. The ice cream was very creamy. It wasn't fancy or out of this world, but it satisfied my sweet fix. I thoroughly enjoyed the service here. The lads are cute in their burly beards and plaid shirts and jeans. They definitely have that ""country hospitality"". At least, our waiter did. He was charming, and another server was helpful in determining whether or not their pecan pie had lard in the pie crusts.

2011-12-04,3.0,"I've been tracking Grange Hall's progress since Veerasway closed down.  I was skeptical of the concept (don't we have enough burger places?) but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt since it is right down the street from my condo.  Anyway, this past Friday, I finally tried it out. Unfortunately, I was not impressed.  I'll start with the good things.  The decor here is really great.  It looks like stuff the owner picked up from flea markets and garage sales.  I have family (who are farmers) in Michigan, and the decorations at Grange Hall do a good job of approximating the vibe.  The servers were all wearing plaid shirts and jeans, which also fit the vibe.  Suspenders were also out in full force, however one server was wearing both suspenders and a belt...oops. Some of the food was excellent as well.  The hot fudge sundae I had for dessert is something I'd want to go back for.  They use fresh whipped cream, which is awesome.  I also particularly liked the bun on my burger and the mustard, which was exceptionally creamy and tasted almost like horseradish.  It was wonderful.  Service here is also super friendly and helpful.  They handled the packed restaurant very well, though they forgot to give us napkins, which is sort of essential when eating a burger. However, a number of things didn't impress me or downright bothered me.  First off, Jade T's veggie burger literally oozed out of the bun when she bit it.  Before I saw that happen, I was going to ask her to try it.  However, after seeing its baby food-like consistency I figured I should stick to my own (beef) burger.  My burger had highs and lows.  I ordered it with all the free toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mayo, and mustard) plus muenster cheese and a fried egg ($1 a piece extra).  The fried egg was perfectly done and all the ingredients were fresh and good.  However, the patty itself didn't have much flavor.  For a place that only serves burgers (and one that cost $14), I expected to be wowed.  I prefer a nice, greasy Five Guys burger to be honest. The sides were also a mixed bag.  The garlic mac 'n cheese was good (very garlicky, but in a good way).  However, I didn't care for the fries, which were overly large, dry, and crispy.  They don't bring ketchup out with the fries, which I understand is the preference of some fry snobs, but I am not one. All in all, Grange Hall got almost everything right except the core of their business:  burgers and fries.  On top of that, dinner for two here easily tops $50.  I don't automatically assume that just because I'm paying more for something it's better, and in this case it wasn't.  I won't be back here unless someone else suggests it.  I'm still longing for Veerasway.",0.9987,0.731,0.221,0.048,0.5835511982570807

2011-12-02,4.0,"Given that Grange Hall has already been open for two weeks and also my propensity for trying new burger places immediately, I'm surprised it took me this long to make it there. Of course, I was out of town for a week, so I'll cut myself some slack. It was certainly worth the wait. The decor is country- farmhouse-meets-your-great-aunt's-house, with white, barn-style doors, wood hutches, and old-fashioned homey touches. The servers wear plaid shirts (a little overkill in the country theme if you ask me) and our adorable server, Mara (Beth R's doppelganger), even sported braids. She looked straight out of ""Little House on the Prairie.""  We sat at the bar while we waited for our friend to join us. I ordered a ""hillbilly margarita"" made with lemonade, cucumbers, maple syrup and tequila and it went down very easy. My companion had a PBR but the nice bartender insisted he try an ""American"" on the house. We thought that was very nice. We settled up at the bar and took our seats. They have communal tables, which is something I'm not normally a fan of, but it worked out okay, as there was a couple of  empty chairs between our group and the people at the end of the table. We started with a fried vegetable basket of mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings and green beans, all tempura-style, with homemade mayo for dipping. This was huge, and more than enough to share. It's pretty hard to go wrong with anything fried and it was all delicious and quickly devoured. The mayo had a nice zip of dijon and it was a great complement to the fried veggies. Naturally we all ordered burgers. They offer burgers in two sizes (6 oz. or 9 oz.) and three varieties: grass-fed, farm-raised beef, turkey or veggie burgers. They have an extensive assortment of toppings ($1 extra) and a handful of sides. We all ordered the 6 oz beef burgers with various toppings and four sides--the garlicky mac and cheese, baked beans with fennel, onion rings, and fries. We were pleasantly surprised at being told that burgers are automatically cooked medium-rare unless otherwise requested. Finally--a burger place that gets it! I'm so sick of having overcooked burgers :( Our food arrived and we dug in. All of the sides were generous and there was plenty to share. The fries were different: more like big, deep-fried wedges than traditional fries, but they were delicious. The mac and cheese was a big hit too. I didn't particularly care for the beans, but the others liked them. It should also be noted that the egg on the burger was cooked perfectly and was runny, just as it should be. I also love that they unapologetically only serve Heinz ketchup; I'm rather non-plussed at all the housemade ketchups being served by restaurants nowadays. There's nothing wrong with Heinz. Despite being stuffed, we couldn't pass on dessert. They serve homemade, fresh churned ice cream and seasonal pie. In fact, they only offer one pie per month. Sadly, I missed the pumpkin offered in November and had to skip this month's offering (pecan), due to a nut allergy, but when I saw the monthly list of pie offerings, I instantly drooled. It looks like I'll be a monthly regular from May - September next year to sample all of their fruit pies. We settled on chocolate and peanut brittle ice creams and both were outstanding. The chocolate tasted like frozen chocolate mousse.  As an added bonus, they play all the awesomely bad 70s songs you hate-to-love and love-to-hate (""Ode to Billie Joe,"" anyone?). I asked our server about the music and she said they specifically chose the music in keeping with the theme of reminding you of your great aunt's house. They definitely succeeded. When our check was dropped off, they asked us to note any suggestions or comments we had, so clearly, they're looking to keep their customers happy. I'd say so far, so good. Well done, Grange Hall. You're a great addition to the Randolph Street dining strip.  This burger-lovin' gal will be back.",0.9988,0.764,0.185,0.051,0.6077307735000044
2011-12-02,3.0,"If any city can enjoy a good burger, Chicago can.  I've done my fair share of burger soul searching and live right by the mecca of burgers, Kuma's.     I'd like to think of burgers encompassing three styles: fast food style, casual, and gourmet.  For fast food style, think of something like an In and Out.  Gourmet would be something along the lines of a burger at a great steakhouse or a fancy Kuma's style burger with fancy or eclectic toppings. Grange is definitely of the casual style of burger.  Which most burger places are and the majority of good burgers are. Decor:  The decor is great.  Inside it looks like a non-tacky version of Cracker Barrel.  The cutlery looks like some antique silver your grandmother might be hoarding at her place.  Everyone is dressed up in the style of plaid and blue jeans.  The interior is very nice and cozy, especially well suited to the feel of the holidays.  Seating:  Communal.  Deal with it.  Love it or hate it, it is what it is. Drinks:  They have a lot of local craft brews, and some cocktails.  The cocktails were a bit lacking.  I'm probably spoiled or and elitist bastard but I can't stand cocktails without proper ice.  The ice they used looked like it was used in a motel 6 ice machine.  It was much too small and had too much surface area ruining any sort of wonderful nuances of booziness.  I ordered the bee knee's and found it to be a bit too saccharin for my taste.   The strong island was pretty strong, so no complaints.  Also, the glasses were a bit small and chintzy. Service:  I liked our server.   My dining companion said he looked like a mustachioed Ryan Gosling.  I, for one, didn't see it at all.  But ladies, feel free to try to get a ring on this fella.  He was courteous and not too energetic to where it gets annoying. Time to table:  The food took kinda long to get to us.  It wasn't too busy and 3 burgers took what felt like 30 mins.  Granted I was really hungry, but still it felt like waiting for a burger at Kuma's which almost always takes FOOOOREVER. Appetizers:  We got some rainbow chips and dip which comes with some piece of verbiage speaking to the history of rainbow chips.  Which are basically well done potatoe chips.  I liked the darkness to them but I prefer a much thicker cut of chip especially when it comes from scratch.  But for all i know they are suppose to be super thin, so I can't really hold it against them.  The dip, though, the French Onion dip was really really good.  Seemed to be made in house.  Sides: Onion rings were nothing to write home about.  I woulda preferred a crispier texture.  The mac and cheese was unfortunately along the same calibre.  I really enjoyed the use of garlic.  But the cheese was a bit too thick and hard to enjoy after it cooled a little.  Furthermore, the mac and cheese was bland and underseasoned.  A little salt would've went a long way.  Also the noodles were too soft for my taste.  Definitely not al dente.  I think I can make a better mac and cheese. Da Burgers:  My dining companion and I split a 11 oz burger which came out to $12.  A little more than half a pound.  Right off the bat, I thought the burger was freaking delicious.  The bun was perfect, and not overpowering like most buns can be.  The beef tasted so clean and delicious; not fatty with a nice, earthier quality to it.  The burger, though, seemed rather diminutive since I'm used to burgers being piled high full of stuff. This probably has to do with their rather paltry list of toppings.  For the free stuff, it was lettuce, onion, and tomatoes.  For a dollar each, there was caramelized onions, a slice of cheese, avocados, and sauteed mushrooms.  For a dollar, the fried egg seems like a good deal.  But you get a half pound cheeseburger with an egg and you are looking at a 14 dollar burger.  I love jalapenos and hot sauce on my burgers, I was rather sad they had neither. Dessert: Ice cream there is cheap and it rocks.  Do it. Value:  Burger expensive but good.  Sides cheap but not that good.  Ice cream cheap and good.  Drinks expensive for their size. Overall:  Great burgers, great beef, but need more toppings at a slightly cheaper price point.  The value of this place isn't good enough for what i want. Hard to justify But the service is good, and the ambiance is great.  I'll go back, but it won't be for a while.",0.9994,0.735,0.221,0.044,0.5896367206676486
2011-12-02,4.0,"I have achieved burger-vana! What a lucky find...and completely unexpected!  I stumbled upon Grange Hall after looking for a last minute place to eat last night...and not being able to find a seat at my other local favorite, Girl and the Goat (hat's off Stephanie!).  I have to admit, the decor at first was a little off putting, but the warm reception I received from the staff made it easy to overlook.  Great service and quite honestly the best burger I've had in a long time.  Ask for 'Andrew's Burger' - turkey, avocado, american cheese and a fried egg...wouldn't have been my first choice but damn!!!  My friends that joined me later concurred and we all polished off a fantastic ice cream desert as well.  The only suggestion would be expanding the wine and beer list.  I know its part of the midwest theme but Michigan just doesn't produce good vino... Very impressed and can't wait to try out their breakfast sometime!",0.9904,0.726,0.238,0.036,0.5398550724637682
2011-12-02,5.0,"nom nom nom nom! This place is awesome.  Went there last night with a friend and my hubby as an impromptu gathering.  I work nearby, and I hadn't actually been there before. I regret not going to Grange Hall sooner. I had a hard time picking between the cider and the list of awesome cocktails they had.  I'm kind of a cider snob;  the waiter was patient and willing to describe the pear cider they had.  It was incredible. The burger and fries were amazing.  First of all, their gluten-free bun tastes ""normal"" a big deal for those of us who can't have regular bread!  The fries are perfect.  Crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle.   The waiter did an excellent job of checking in, but not being pushy.  We had a great time. He talked us into a sundae, which was also fantastic!   We will definitely go back again!!!",0.9812,0.776,0.193,0.031,0.5413614163614164
2011-11-29,4.0,"Another burger joint but this place was badly needed, it's located on Randolph Street with many world class restaurants with menu prices to match.   They advertise ""farm to table"" fare with grass-fed burgers and hand-made pies and ice cream.  The burger was one of the best I've had and the toasted bun is a star on its own.  I like that the burger comes in 2 sizes and that's there's a turkey and vegetarian option also.    If I remember the sides run about $3 each, we loved the potatoes wedges and the garlicky mac and cheese.  Burger topping came in at about a buck each; between the sides, the topping and a beverage or 2 it all adds up but you can taste and see the quality.    The décor is very unfussy, like eating in a barn at communal tables, the staff is in plaid shirts and jeans which maybe crossing the line into farm-land cuteness but its great addition to the street and we'll be back.",0.979,0.826,0.152,0.023,0.5395833333333333
2011-11-17,4.0,"I was invited to the soft opening of Grange Hall Burger and was really impressed.  I've been back twice since then and whilst I know it's a new place there seem to be a few things they need to get right immediately. Firstly - no reservations in a small place seems like it will be tricky to maintain without pissing people off, especially as the bar area is set up for people to eat at too.  If I'm going to wait for a seat, I don't want to be hovering over someone else trying to eat their meal. The sides seems overpriced at $3 a pop for a small portion.  I like the chunky fries but each time I have had them they are undercooked and not enjoyable to eat - definitely not worth $3. On my last visit we sat at the bar for a drink while some table space freed up, but we were forgotten about so they seated other people that arrived before us - which goes back to the point about reservations: surely it would be easier to do them and not just all walk-ins?  Anyways, two of us had a drink each which came to $15, we paid the barman with a $20 and his response was ""so we're good here?"".  Um, no, I'm not leaving a 30% tip for the 2 drinks you served us! The servers are doing a grand job, but they need to slow down a little.  We were asked if we were ready for our check before finishing our meal and then as soon as the plates were cleared, but we wanted dessert - I felt like we were being shooed away so they could seat someone else and it just made the experience feel tainted. The burgers are wonderful - and I will definitely be a regular for them.  But I may only be a take-away customer.  We shall see.......",0.9885,0.814,0.143,0.043,0.4787984237984238
2011-11-16,5.0,"Our party of 4 LOVED this place.  We were sat immediately at 9:00 on a Saturday night at a large communal table.  It's so refreshing to visit a restaurant that feels so casual (barn doors, mismatched napkins, plaid shirts on servers, Johnny Cash playing), yet serves amazing food that's prepared perfectly with the best ingredients from around the midwest. We started with the chips/french onion dip and the fried veggies/horseradish dip and they were crave inducing - I could seriously drink those dips.  We all had beef burgers with various toppings - they offer several choices.  The burgers were super flavorful, and the juice ran down my wrist - the way a good burger should.  My favorite part was the bun - it was perfectly griddle toasted with butter and did its job of soaking up the juicy burger.  You got just that little bit of buttery crunch from the toasting with each bite.  We had the fries and the baked beans, which were really yummy.  And we tried the pumpkin and salted-caramel ice creams which were amazing and just the right serving size. I also have to mention the cheap beers!!  $3/can - yay! Can't wait to visit again before the buzz starts.  I'm also looking forward to the upcoming breakfasts and farm dinners.  This place is a fantastic addition to Randolph street and easily competes with the rest of Chicago's burger joints.  Well done.",0.9953,0.775,0.218,0.006,0.6630230880230881
2011-11-14,4.0,"One word to sum it all up? Delicious.  We got turkey burgers after hearing the hype from other reviews and the hype did not disappoint. Was it the best turkey burger I'll ever have? Probably not, but the sage and white onion they add to the meat gave it an amazing flavor. Also the size was ideal... big enough to be enjoyed for awhile but small enough to be paired with fries or another side. I was surprised in that they never asked how we wanted the burgers cooked but they came out just right. The quality of the homemade bun and locally-sourced cheese and veggies was also a huge contributor. We both kept it simple with lettuce and tomato (free) plus swiss for me and white cheddar for my girlfriend (two of several available extras, each an additional $1). Our waiter strongly recommended the fried egg but I think the quality and flavor of the burger were best represented without the presence of a bunch of toppings.  My girlfriend was ecstatic about the fact they also offer a gluten-free bun (made by Udi's). She's gotten used to always having to eat burgers without the bread but she claimed that this was as good as you could eat as far as gluten-free goes. The sides are each an additional $3 so we went the economical route and split some of the hand-cut fries. They were cut really thick like steak fries and had that same quality as the burger but they don't give you that many for the price. The sides of chili and mac & cheese we saw on other peoples' plates looked tasty but similarly small. As for everything else, I was surprised that the place itself was pretty small. We sat at the bar where there was room for maybe a dozen or so people. Other than that there were only 4 or 5 long communal tables. If this place ends up getting popular it might be hard to get in without a reservation. The bartender who served us was great and we were well -attended by a few of the waitstaff throughout the meal. Lastly I have to add they do have a short list of wines, also sourced locally. We tried both of the two available reds and having never tried Michigan wine before, we were pleased. Overall I think this place stacks up well above the typical high-quality burger chain but still below the burger from a high-end restaurant. It's a good addition to the ""focused-on-quality"" burger scene in Chicago and we'd definitely consider returning.",0.9973,0.827,0.163,0.009,0.5083576287657922
2011-11-10,4.0,"So, showing up to Burger Bar during the soft opening, my wife and I were pleased to see it wasn't crowded and we were seated immediately. I'll do a quick run down of how the meal went so you can see the end to end experience at this new joint. Overall Ambiance - The inside of this new restaurant is very cozy, looks like the inside of a barn...has the matching tables, bar stools and outfits by the waitstaff to match! My wife commented that she didn't even feel like she was in Chicago, which is a plus already given that it's winter.  Waitstaff/Service/Seating -  Communal table seating, which may be a plus or minus depending on how you feel about it, we didn't mind as it wasn't very crowded.  Waitstaff was great, very friendly and helped to explain the menu and what was offered. I would suggest that you look at the menu and maybe make some selections as to how you want your burger beforehand, as there are a lot of options and determining this beforehand can help speed up your order. Service was great, Maura was very attentive to us and always refilling water, etc. One comment is that you may not be offered water right as you sit down, so make sure to order it (and it is cucumber/lemon water FYI). Food - Burgers are juicy and very tasty, the myriad options with how you are able to put together your own burger-du-jour is nice. There are no pre-made selections to choose from so what you want is entirely up to you. Choose wisely :) One thing to note (another commenter has noted as well) is that the amount of sides that you get for $3 is not really that much and is why I'm detracting a star. $3 for maybe 7 onion rings does not add up...and while the rest of the items are reasonably price I feel like the amount here needs to be increased. Overall, don't let that detract, the sides are of good quality and the burgers are very tasty and not on the ' oh my god' size scale that Kuma's is. A perfect amount. Dessert -  Pie and Ice Cream? Not about to turn either of those down, Homemade ice cream was delicious and really a treat. The pumpkin was excellent and the added touch of whip cream and graham crackers really cemented it as a tasty dessert. Not too expensive either at $4 and more than enough to share, so a definite pro there. Overall Experience - If I could give a 4.5 rating I would, but Yelp doesn't allow it and given that it is a soft opening there are definitely things to work through and Grange Hall was a fun, friendly and atmospheric place to eat. I do think Grange Hall has a great great future and with a few tweaks can be a great burger stop for folks on Randolph. We're looking forward to coming back again and seeing how things progress and enjoying many more juicy burgers!",0.9968,0.834,0.154,0.012,0.5118247409156501
2011-11-10,5.0,"Are you kidding me?  I have no idea how to make a turkey burger taste like THAT... I mean sheesh, I have never tasted a burger so delish. The BF and I each got different burgers and apps so we could taste a little of everything, and man-o-war, everything was just beyond. The burgers as they are (with the fixins that come with them)the best burgers ever... and I almost regretted putting blue cheese and mushrooms on my grass fed beef burgher to taint the taste of perfection.  The turkey burger was the star of the night though-- it was soft, crispy, and full of flavor.  I don't even like turkey burgers normally. Angela came over and told me how she makes those perfect turkey burgers... and though i will try to make something that tastes close to these, I won't come close. We had the fried veggie app and the fries as well, which were both outstanding.  I have to insist that you get some of the horseradish sauce that comes with the veggie app-- it's pretty life changing. The drinks were good, but the burgers are the star here.  Foe on you others that will make this place have hour long waits!  This secret will be out before you can say ""Grange Hall""",0.8515,0.874,0.094,0.033,0.59375
2011-11-09,4.0,"My dining companions and I really enjoyed our trip to Grange Hall Burger Bar.  Obviously we came for the burger and it did not disappoint.  The beef burger with toasted bun was extremely flavorful and nice and juicy.  The cheese was delish!  I can't wait to have it again.  We also shared a fried vegetable basket and were thrilled with how fresh and loaded with flavor the veggies were. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things that prevented me from giving a full 5 stars.  I was mainly disappointed with the the price/value of some of the side items.  The fries were good, not out of this world, but good.  This would have been no problem except for the fact that you pay $3 for just a small handful of wedges.  Similarly, I think it kind of ballsy to charge $3 for a small bottle (albeit a cute little bottle) of Faygo.  And maybe I'm used to the huge desserts that restaurants typically serve nowadays but I just expected a little more than a sliver of pumpkin pie considering the cost.  I hope I don't come off as cheap, I just think some people might find this info important especially when deciding which new burger place to hit up.  All in all we really enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and most importantly the burger.  I'll definitely be returning, I'll just probably skip the fries and drink something that is actually worth 3 bucks.",0.9856,0.774,0.181,0.045,0.6533724340175953

They do have long communal tables, so if that isn't your thing, you can sit at the bar.  One of my dining companions absolutely hates communal dining, so that was a turn off for her.  Regardless, I don't care one way or the other as long as the food is good. And it was. We started with the chips and french onion dip - I know, doesn't sound adventurous but as a lover of Mrs. Grass French Onion Soup Mix, and french onion dip is a staple at all my parties, I had to try the fancy version.  I loved the small bursts of onion, it was truly delicious.  I had the grass-fed burger with blue cheese and a side of onion rings.  The rings were super thin cut and flaky, the burger was super delicious and juicy, and the bun was poppyseed and sesame seed and awesome.  My friend had the veggie burger, and she said its one of the best she ever had.  That's tough to come by, I think.   She had the garlicky mac n' cheese which was good, but a little oily.  My other friend had the burger with cheddar, and she loved it too. We split the pumpkin pie, which lacked flavor, but  we still finished it. Drink wise, they have Faygo (?), canned beer ($3) specialty drinks and some fancier midwest beers and a couple of wines.
