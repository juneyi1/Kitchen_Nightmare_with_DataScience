2013-11-27,1.0,"The complimentary appetizers were nice and tasted good.  Tonight I had the beef carpaccio and the langastinas.  The carpaccio was good.  Wasn't a huge fan of the horseradish sauce but its more of a personal taste.  The beef was nice and thin, with no inclination that it had been frozen.  Then came the langastinas, unshelled, breaded and soggy.  Both that and the risotto were overlooked and nowhere close to what you'd expect from a $55 price tag.  The service was good but it went unnoticed because of the food.  I'd like to point out that I have been here multiple times, with experiences ranging from 3-5 stars.  The last time didnt turn out well and this was their second chance.  Yes, they do have nights where it's perfect but they're not consistent and that is incredibly important if your paying for fine dining.  The only thing that wont be forgetting that meal is my wallet.  Overall the food was mundane.",0.9785,0.76,0.19,0.05,0.5444444444444444
2013-03-07,5.0,"I absolutely love this restaurant! It's an old mansion transformed into a very cool Italian restaurant. Me and a group of 10 people came here for restaurant week. The waiter brought out an entire slew of appetizers that didn't even count as the restaurant week menu. It was mostly antipasta items like olives, cheese, bread, salami, pepperoni, and different pickled vegetables.  For my first course, I choose the eggplant roulade. It was perfectly cheesy and crunchy where it's supposed to be, without getting soggy, and just absolutely delicious. My main entree was mushroom ravioli. Their pasta is heaven, super creamy and delicious. It is a lot more filling than it appears. None of us were able to finish our meals, in fact. For dessert, we had a chocolate concoction that must have been made special for restaurant week.  A lot of people say this restaurant is over-priced, which it probably is, but it is such a great deal for Restaurant Week!",0.9738,0.843,0.157,0.0,0.5916534391534392

2012-07-01,1.0,"The worst fine dining experience I've ever experienced. Went there for Valentine's Day with my wife and another couple, everything was a disappointment. They have a prefix menu on Valentine's Day which we didn't know in advance but not an issue. Of course it became a problem when half the tables around us were ordering off the standard menu. In either case, when we asked the server for some insight in the menu and he said pick one from each category. Really? That's how it works? Only known this for about 20 years. Apparently what was lost on him was we wanted to know about the options and how they are prepared and it was clearly  explained we wanted guidance on the menu. This shouldn't be difficult for a server at a high end restaurant. He was rude and disiniterested. We asked for the manager and requested a new server. The real manager  wasn't working on Valentine's Day but the ""acting manager"" (who claimed to be the manager but later found out he wasn't) came over and acted like he was on Goodfella's and talked in circles but never actually did anything about the situation. He finally apologized and offered up a bottle of wine but when we asked about the wine he had sudden memory loss and claimed he said no such thing, even though the 4 of us heard him loud and clear. We never actually were assigned a new server and instead were continually waiting for our meals, several tables were seated two times before we received our entrees, and basically it was the busboys who handled our table. We left before the dessert and grappa because we were so disenchanted by the entire experience. Upon leaving, I asked who the  real manager was and for their contact information. I was informed the guy acting like the manager wasn't but they couldn't provide the contact information for the actual manager.  For the record, I contacted the headquarters in New York and per their request sent them my account of the experience. This was in February. In May, after 3 months I contacted them again letting them know I was disappointed nobody chose to contact me. I received one message from the manager, called her back, and haven't heard anything since then (6 weeks later). Before pounding someone on Yelp I figure its fair to give them the opportunity to rectify a bad experience or explain it somehow.

The old mansion converted restaurant is beautiful - but I gotta say, they didn't do much to the space to modernize it, make it their own, or make it unique or interesting in any way. The entrance is pretty hokey - basket o'lemons, boxes of Barilla pasta (come on, really? I can get that sH$&$t at Jewel man), jars of fermenting or pickled items...just odd.  The restaurant is also just way too dark - no light, drapes closed, this is lunch, let in the light people!   As for the edible food, I started with a meat ravioli in broth. It was intereeesting...but the meat ravioli was meat mush and I have certain textural issues with meat mush that I couldn't enjoy it very much. My second course, of which I had low expectations, of papparadelle with tomato and basil. was pretty amazing. Really great homemade noodles, and the sauce was delish.  3rd course of tiramisu was pretty bad...the cake was hard and dried out...shockingly bad for an italian staple.   I will say our service was excellent.

2012-02-19,5.0,"Thank you, Restaurant Week, for allowing me to try Il Mulino. Restaurant Week is my favorite week of the year.  I'm a bit of a foodie, but my wallet prevents me from exploring every restaurant on my to-do list.  When the RW list was posted online, my boyfriend and I immediately made our reservations.  First up, Il Mulino.  When we arrived at Il Mulino on Friday night, we were asked to wait in the bar area while they prepared our table.  My boyfriend and I each grabbed a glass of cabernet, which was delicious.  After a couple of minutes, we were led to our table on the first floor.  Almost immediately, the complimentary appetizers began arriving. Fried zucchini, salami, parmesan cheese (broken off from a huge wheel at the table), bruschetta, garlic bread, and a delicious bread basket - all complimentary!  The fried zucchini was surprisingly light, in the most flavorful olive oil - I think it had chili flakes in it.  The bruschetta was the best I've ever had, hands down.  The tomatoes were packed with flavor and I could've eaten an entire meal of that bruschetta. The parmesan, salami and breads were all perfect.  I would've eaten everything in the bread basket, if we didn't have three courses ahead of us! First course: eggplant rollantine for me, insalata spinaci for my boyfriend. The eggplant rollantine was incredible.  I've had eggplant in the past that wasn't prepared properly, so I'm always nervous when I order it.  This eggplant was pounded pretty thin and was cooked perfectly.  It came with garlic sauteed spinach on the side, which was a perfect complement to the dish. My boyfriend liked his salad, which had plenty of bacon on it.  I think my dish was the winner though! Second course: ravioli ai porcini for me, veal rollantine for my boyfriend. My ravioli came in a champagne truffle cream sauce, which I could smell before the dish was set on the table.  It.  Was.  Amazing.  The raviolis were delicious, and I couldn't help using some of the bread to soak up the leftover sauce. My boyfriend's veal was wonderful.  I've never had veal before, so I had to sample it - it was VERY delicious!  Portions are generous and quite filling.  I couldn't imagine eating any more than what we were served. Dessert: flourless chocolate cake for both of us. This cake was divine.  I love homemade whipped cream and I couldn't stop eating it.  The cake came with two different kinds of whipped cream - the standard whipped cream, and a pistachio whipped cream.  I couldn't get over how delicious it was. Service was fantastic.  We were not rushed at all - our reservation was at 7:00 and we left the restaurant at 9:00.  The courses were spaced out perfectly. We were given a complimentary grappa after dinner, which we enjoyed while trying not to burst through our clothes.  We were full! I would absolutely come back here for a special occasion.  The regular prices are a bit high for me to enjoy on a regular weekend, but it's well worth it for the amazing food and service.",0.9994,0.742,0.248,0.01,0.602635992125788
2012-02-17,3.0,"Swank.  If I were a guy trying to get a girl horizontal or wanted to impress in-laws, here I'd go.  Very old-school fancy vibe, with lovely chandeliers in a dimmed mansion, oo la la (or the Italian equivalent to oo la la).  Husband and I went during Restaurant Week, because like heck would we have been willing to to drop the benjamins to try a restaurant like that, so it was special.  I was very excited to get decked out together and celebrate a late Valentine's Day.  The night started out impressively, with perfect bossa nova music and a behemoth boulder of some kind of hard cheese being wheeled around and three plates of little bites before we even got the menu; I thought the bruschetta was very tasty.  I wished the bread in the basket was warm, but it was pretty good.  Fresh red rose on the table, and waiters taking care of us like we were three-year-olds, so attentive, I half expected them to make airplane noises and feed me with a spoon.  The eggplant rolled up with cheese was splendid, gooey and tasty, and we were off to a good start.  Entrees (chicken and salmon) and desserts were okay...like, $18 okay, not $35 okay, and definitely not more than $35 okay.   Parts of the service were very odd. As the evening wore on, the stiff chairs became uncomfortable, and the table was too small to even hold hands...point of a romantic restaurant?!   There was literally less than two minutes between courses.  Hubby remarked this as ""faster than McDonald's.""  After a while, this was a little irritating, we started to feel rushed...I know it's Restaurant Week and we weren't drinking, but come on, give us a sec to digest at least.  Also, they asked if we wanted ""sparkling or flat"" water, and not understanding, I said flat, thinking it was regular tap water (Chicago's finest), but no, it was from a bottle, and then on the bill, there was $16 for two bottles of WATER.  Do you think I would ever in my right mind and under normal circumstances spend $16 on water?!  Even if you don't know me like that, I bet you can guess I'm not that crazy.  My bad for being dumb about the fine art of water-ordering, but just a heads-up for other foodies who do not want sticker shock, ask for tap.  Between that, tipping the coat check woman and the $15 valet, so much for the budget fancy night out.  I know this is not the place to go if you care, it's a ""if you have to ask you can't afford it"" vibe, but still, I don't like feeling hoodwinked.   Most surprisingly, given the amount of attention given to the traditional, the waiter plopped the check on the table on an open plate, face up, right in between us.  Now, in reality that is no big deal, I'm with my husband, but they didn't know that, and we were obviously dressed up for a date.  If I could be an old lady about it, I thought putting the check where I could see it (and couldn't help but see it) was gauche.   My husband ordered coffee,  and they never came to refill, and  then they picked it up our signed check while we were still sitting. Ummm, hint taken, we'll go now.  Veni, vidi, vici:  I wanted to go try it and we did, it was interesting and fancy and had some good food moments.  Just wish it could have been just a little more leisurely and that the meal would finish as strong as it started.  Glad we went...once.",0.997,0.791,0.159,0.05,0.5471840659340658
2012-02-16,2.0,"Let me preface this review to say that Il Mulino, on a regular night, is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It's charming and the food is wonderful- on an ordinary night. This is my rating for one night- Valentine's Day 2012.  After such a miserable experience on Valentine's Day, I don't know if I'll ever go back. Making the reservation, we were told we could order off the regular menu but when we arrived, it was ONLY pre fixe. As someone with a lot of food allergies, pre fixe menus are not my friend. I understand why they're necessary on nights with such high volume but had I known that, I would not have come here. The waiter and captain didn't speak English well enough to understand my concerns about allergies.  The prices are quite high. Ordinarily, I would gladly pay the high price for the regular menu but the subpar food (bordering on disgusting) on the pre fixe menu was not worth the price. There was very, very little choice and the staff were very rushed and not nearly as great as they usually are. Again, I realize this is an unrepresentative sample of the restaurant- just one night out of many I've been here... but given the importance that people put on special occasions like Valentine's Day, I would think such a high quality restaurant would put more effort into their preparation and organization.",0.4013,0.862,0.074,0.063,0.5487805742644452
2012-02-16,1.0,"I have to confess that it makes me really sad that I have to rate Il Mulino so low after wanting to go to this restaurant for about five years.  I always had it in my mind as a place to go celebrate a special occasion and finally did so on Valentines Day this year.....what a mistake. First, our reservations were late that night (at 9 pm) but we were okay with that because we had been wanting to go for so long.  However, we arrived at 8:55 but didn't get seated until almost 10:00.  Keep in mind, it's a Tuesday night.  It would have been nice if we had been offered a glass of prosecco for having to wait for so long, but we moved on and hoped that once we got seated that our troubles were over.....wrong. Second, when making the reservation we were informed that we had a choice between a pre-fixe menu or we could order off the regular menu.  Once we sit down we are instantly given some random small bites or appetizers that we gladly accept but we're confused because we haven't even recevied a menu yet.  Then when we finally receive a menu we are told that pre-fixe is our only option (no price listed but I guess at this point we're all in!).  Not only is it pre-fixe only, but the options to choose from were incredibly limited.   Third, I selected the caprese salad to start and was actually delivered a plate with only one tomato and one piece of mozzarella.  One.  And it was not bufala mozzarella as listed on the menu....anyone who has had bufala mozzarella before would know the difference. Fourth, I  am not a picky eater by any means and I realize that the whole world is becoming obsessed with truffle oil but I am not a big fan of mushrooms and absolutley hate truffle.  Of course the pasta course has only one option, and it's a mushroom ravioli with truffle sauce....no thanks.  So we ask if there is ANY other sauce that they could put on it and he said yes; marinara, so we hesitantly agreed, but hey, it's not truffle!  Once the pasta dish was delivered it tasted like a chef boyardee can had been heated up on the stove and poured on a plate....it was unbelivably disappointing. Fifth, the entree selection had one meat option which was veal and what my boyfriend selected, but unfortunately, they were out of the veal.  So only shrimp, fish, or chicken were left.....we both opted for the shrimp, which was mediocre at best. Fifth, you would think that when you order a bottle of red wine that they would know how to present the bottle to the table.....wrong again.  The waiter poured the tasting for my boyfriend to sample the wine while holding the glass up in the air, then the waiter tried to swirl the glass in the air and then hands my boyfriend the glass.  Ummm, what just happend???  Please just pour the taste into the glass while it is resting on the table and do not touch the glass again.....it was soooo uncomfortable.   The entire experience from beginning to end was just plain terrilble.  Thank goodness I at least had good company.",0.961,0.84,0.094,0.066,0.5778591778591778

Pro: They do bring you a lot of complimentary items, including an entire array of appetizers and breads. The hand-carved cheese was pretty great, and the mussel was nice and briny. Con: Maybe I am naive, and real Italian food is served this way, but some of the appetizers tasted like they had been prepared in the morning and had sat around waiting to be served. The zucchini was oily; the bruschetta bread was cold and soggy. Again, a matter of taste? Just not what I like to eat. Pro: The desserts were delicious - we had the tiramisu, which just melted in your mouth, and it came with a homemade amaretto zabaione. Con: My entree was just fair. I had chicken with mushrooms in a garlic sauce, and while the sauce was flavorful, the whole plate was way too heavy and oily for my taste. The chicken was just swimming in the sauce and it was impossible to tell how the chicken had even been prepared. Pro: The ambiance of the old mansion was as grand as all the other reviewers mention, helped by some soft music played upstairs. Con: This ambiance was ruined by the party going on downstairs, including the bumping Rihanna tracks playing in the bar that were vibrating the floor beneath our feet.

There is no question that this place is romantic.  I was hating the fact that I was single, the night before my 29th birthday (for the 6th time) with no foreseeable prospects, and I was here for a business dinner.  The waiters in tuxes, the lighting, and the structure itself,,,,I just wanted anyone to ask me out while I was in here. A few reason why this is 3 stars.  We held our business meeting upstairs, with 40 people in attendance.  Waitstaff was very attentive and served everyone well.  They helped me with my gluten allergy, and while I had to remind them when they were serving flights of the meal of what I specifically needed (they accidentally gave me a Caesar salad instead of the fruit plate, but it was corrected), they did take care of me.  I ordered the veal, which I ate a few bites of and could not finish.  It was very salty. The other reason is was bad for a business meeting:  LOUD.  There is no way to close off the area, and with the bathrooms nearby, all we heard through the entire dinner presentation was girls laughing.  There was some type of party downstairs, and they all had to walk upstairs past our room to get to the bathroom.  Even worse, is there were tons of women dressed like we were in Vegas, and all the men in my meeting with getting chubbies through out the entire meal and were completely distracted.  The staff was sometimes loud, the room allowed voices to carry, and it was not ideal for a business presentation. I did not pick the location for the meal,,,a local representative did.  I would not have chosen this place due to the lack of privacy and the noise level of the upstairs. I guess maybe next time I should grab a group of the Vegas wanna be girls, hit the Viagra triangle, find my victim, and then come back here and let him propose with a Kardashian size diamond and never have to suffer through another business meal again. Or maybe I will just go back to Portland.  Where men don't shower, the women don't shave, and everyone just drinks beer and fights anti-establishment.

2011-07-28,5.0,"I agree with David D.; some of these reviews are insulting.  It reaffirms my belief that some people just like to complain.  As many people mentioned, they do bring you LOTS of free tastings before your appetizer/meal to get you going: a mussel, bruschetta, fried zucchini, and AMAZING parmesan cheese.  I had red snapper stuffed with seafood and it was DE-licious.  Husband had sea scallops wrapped with pancetta - also amazing.  Very attentive servers as well.  This is a great place for a special night and I can't wait to go back!",0.9644,0.704,0.242,0.054,0.6421428571428571

2011-07-13,5.0,"I wasn't going to write a review because there are so many good ones on here. BUT there are a few 2 and 3 stars that are honestly insulting.  Yes, this place is high end and expensive but well worth it. First of all, the dishes so thoughtful and the menu is HUGE. Not your typical italian restaurant with the same standard 15 items. The meats are AMAZING and really give the diner unique options.  One thing I love is that they swoon you with free tastes at the beginning to warm your palate - breads, fried zucchini seasoned with oil and red pepper, mussels and Bruschetta. A perfect start while you drink from their great Italian wine selection. In my eyes, no need for an appetizer!  In addition to the food, the service is impeccable and the interior is old school fine dining with low lighting (it works) and heavy, dark cloth everywhere. The outside you ask? It's in a cute little white mansion, can't beat it.  Bottom line - best Italian downtown in my book.",0.9958,0.686,0.285,0.03,0.44590090090090106

2011-06-04,2.0,"Let me start by saying that this is a 'real-deal' review. I was scanning so many reviews about this place that simply glossed over important details. Last evening, the hubby had wanted to treat me to a romantic date night, restaurant of my choice. A coworker recommended this place and after reading reviews on Yelp, I made the reservation.  The venue is nothing short of spectacular! The waiter didn't know too much history about this mansion turned restaurant, but the date 1874 was mentioned ... Giant doorways, exquisite curving balustrades, 20-foot (maybe higher?) ceilings, windows for days, ambient candlelight, magnificent marble bathrooms ... It was truly beautiful. There was a slight musty odor when you first walked in, but it's an old, old house and so totally part of its character. It reminded the hubby of period homes and buildings in New Orleans. The menu link wasn't working on their website, so I had no idea of prices going in. Pastas (no meat) ran from $26-$30's, steaks were upper $40's-$50's, and there was a Dover Sole on special for $65. Yes, I said $65 ... for sole. I quieted my inner practicality and decided to focus on the environment and the company. They had other seafood, beef and chicken dishes as well, but nothing that had caught my eye.  Upon being seated, the waitstaff (attentive to a near fault), regaled us with an assortment of breads (one almost baked to the point of being a crouton, and I mean that in a delicious way), fried zucchini chips (or dare I say shavings) that were a little too oily and over-spiced with pepper flakes, a chunk off a massive block of aged Parmesan cheese (couldn't get enough!), a piece of bruscetta (refreshing, yummy!), and one lone mussel that was a tad briny; not to mention, while mine was quite plump, the hubby's looked a little sad and pathetic.  We looked over the wine list. Glasses were $12 and up, bottles $40-$100's. We opted for an Italian red table wine (Puglia region) that was $40 with a pleasantly sweet flavor and velvety finish.  We ordered apps of oysters on the half shell and escargot. The oysters were plump, fresh, and mild tasting, but the cocktail sauce and vinaigrette sides were lacking punch. The escargot, which we traditionally like prepared in nothing more than garlic, EVOO and/or butter, were out of their shells and on mushroom caps in a tomato-based sauce that neither one of us cared for.  Our entrees were Cannelloni and the evening's special, a homemade white porcini stuffed ravioli in cream sauce. I enjoyed my Cannelloni, which was two very large pasta tubes stuffed with an herbed veal and beef mixture (almost a pate consistency) and swimmimg in a bland (though hearty) tomato sauce that I doctored with TONS of fresh grated Parmesan and salt. The hubby's ravioli was nothing out of this world and the cream sauce was also bland and not identifying with an particular flavor. (Maybe us Americans are brutes with our seasoning???)  The entrees were ample enough that we took home leftovers. After dinner, we were served a small glass of grappa each. It tasted orange-infused and a little like gasoline, but hey, that's grappa!  The bill was $156 for a bottle of wine, 2 apps, and 2 entrees. Although the venue itself was romantic and luxurious feeling, I wouldn't recommend a friend go there, except maybe for a drink.

We had appetizers and entrees and I would say that everything was excellent, though the pre-appetizers (the items they bring when you sit down - cheese, bruschetta, etc.) were the best, appetizers were second, and the entrees were my least favorite (if I had to choose).  It's definitely a great place for a special occasion, especialy a romantical one.",0.991,0.722,0.263,0.015,0.5838763575605682

2011-03-09,5.0,"I've decided that Il Mulino is the place where I want to get engaged or at least flee to after committing a heinous crime. Il Mulino was the last leg for me on a fantastic GNO tour and we couldn't have landed at a better venue. As we approached Il Mulino, I got goosebumps! It looked like one of the haunted mansions one might see in a Scooby Doo episode--dark, daunting and mysterious. When the maitre'd showed us into the sexy, dimly lit bar and I spotted a lone couple by the fireplace locked in a passionate embrace, I knew this was where I wanted to receive some serious caratage. Or at least huddle in a corner, wild-eyed, while contemplating the ramifications of the bloody butcher knife hidden in my Carlos Falchi python bag. It just had a sensual, romantic, murderous vibe to it. Marco, the GM, came over and instructed the server to take good care of us- which he did. We ordered the house pinot grigio and the bruschetta (Marco was impressed that I pronounced it correctly, broo-SKEH-tah) and we commenced to laughing, drinking, munching and also flirting with the  male lookers-on who kept peeking into the bar. Marco even sent over an order of fried zucchini which was surprisingly light and extremely flavorful (I'm not a big fan of zucchini) and informed us that tiramisu was on the way. I glanced over at the couple to find the woman sobbing hysterically into her lover's arms. How romantic! Did he just break up with her, propose or inform her that he was the one who killed her husband?  Time for a potty break and as I climbed the long, spiral, spooky staircase to the one of the most beautiful all-marble bathrooms I had ever seen, I began trying to figure out who I wanted to propose to me or who I could kill. By the time I had thrown away my paper towel, I hadn't thought of anyone. With much reluctance, it was time for us to go.

All was great except the zucchini--was very oily and somewhat bland even though it had huige chunks of red pepper floating in it. We were so full from bread and cheese that we opted out of ordering appetizers. Dinner took a little while since I ordered the mushroom risotto; it was delicious! Well cooked and seasoned. My BF had the branzino. They brought it out whole for viewing and then deboned it for him. It was good, with a subtle lemony flavor.

2010-11-06,3.0,"Yeah....I had REALLY high expectations for this place, not only based on reviews, but I had heard about how great the one in NY was from a neighbor, so I was excited when some friends suggested we get together here...a group of 8 people. So to start, the entry and service when we came in, including coat check option and ambiance was very nice. We were lead upstairs, but I do suggest that if you want to people watch, stay downstairs. Upstairs is definitely more quiet and private (except with us there...we were kinda loud and did a lot of laughing. I'm sure we annoyed all the tables around us...Mi dispiace (I apologize) on the group's behalf...but we did have fun! The music is great and plays throughout the whole night....we recognized a bunch of songs, so that was cool. I think this place is better for an intimate/romantic dinner vs coming here with a big group. Starters -  We looked at the wine menu, and I had hoped they had a better mixed drink menu, but nope....alas, they did not. We had a variety of orders, from wine to cosmos to bloody mary's, and everything was fine, nothing fantastic. Then came the, I would say ""BEST"" part of the meal! Chunks of Parmesan cheese, thinly sliced salami, bruschetta, garlic bread with a clam for each person, and a  bread basket. You could really just get full off of that.  Note - We had asked for more cheese on one occasion and then more bread on another occasion and they forgot both times. I finally asked for more bread again and it did arrive. Meal -  Then one of the waiters come out and told us about their huge list of specials and we were a bit overwhelmed with all the options and that we wouldn't remember anything, but they handed us separate special menus in addition to the regular menu (few). The waiter/presenter reminded me of Pavarotti and I thought...hmmmm...it would be cool if he sang all that! Anyhoo, we ordered a variety of items, although they were out of the lamb that one of the girls wanted to get, so that was annoying for her. We had pesto gnocci and cannelloni, and both were just ok. I was told the pesto was too strong and the cannelloni, well, I would say that Olive Garden's is better.  I know...shocking and sad, but true. The guys all got veal and they said it was ok/good, and one girl got the fish and she enjoyed that.  We didn't get dessert but were given peach grappa, which was nice. The Let Down -  Here is the thing...no one raved. Not one person said that their meal was excellent, great, or even yummmmm. I would say we were all disappointied and really expected much better.

I have NEVER EVER heard this before. We were told that they could only split the bill evenly...WHAT?! So evenly 3 ways, even thought the amount range of what each person owed was different.

2010-10-04,5.0,"This restaurant holds a special place in my heart as it is where I got engaged and spent my first anniversary, as well as multiple outings in between.   First of all, the staff is very accommodating with special requests and instructions.  They will work with you to make sure your ideas come true as planned. I have worked with them multiple times with special instructions and each time have been overly impressed. The best attribute of Il Mulino has to be the service.  There is not a minute that goes by that someone isn't checking on you, filling your water, getting you a fresh drink, topping off your wine or anything else you may need as each minute passes.  Now, at some restaurants this could be annoying, but the staff here knows how to be very low key and in the background. Not intrusive or abrasive at all.  The food is excellent, very well prepared and plentiful. Pasta is fresh and sauces are not overpowering, even when it is a heavy sauce such as Alfredo...  The salads are always cold and crisp and the standard appetizers that everyone gets are always great before your meal.  It is small bites you don't have to think about.  Great slices of sausage, chunks or fresh cheese and my favorite are the spicy zucchini chips. The ambiance is great.  An old mansion turned restaurant in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Chicago.  A lot of history in the building.  You can feel it in each room.  They all have different personalities. All in all, I hope Il Mulino is around for a long time and we are excited to try Il Gabbiano in Downtown Miami when we are there in November.   Enjoy. FYI.  Everyone is always dressed very well at Il Mulino, although, I am most comfortable in jeans and a nice shirt.  They never have a problem with that.  As long as you are comfortable being a little under dressed.",0.9981,0.741,0.246,0.013,0.5471280915466962

They did serve it with a rather dried out mussel. No thanks.  Their caprese salad is enormous. As is everything else on the menu! I would recommend their spinach salad over any other... it is served with a generous pile of bacon, and is sharable for two people.  I had their Dover Sole, sauteed with butter and lemon.... it was not the best dover sole I've had, but decent. Unfortunately, I was only able to eat about a fourth of it!  Adam had the veal marsala.

All of which were excellent (especially the Parmesan) For an appetizer we ordered polenta and sausage in a borolo wine sauce which was very good. The sausage was actually fantastic but the polenta was only so so.  For our entrees I had Shrimp oreganato and escarole which was very good, not great  (it had a very very flavorful sauce which I liked)and my husband had chicken paillard which was average. He was actually disappointed in his meal and after tasting it, I couldn't blame him. It was just kind of blah.  I don't know much about wine but the list had something suitable for our tastes and price range so we were happy with it.  The service was perfect. Not a single problem in that arena. I almost felt like they were too attentive at times (we were talking and just felt like we were being interrupted a lot). I don't really consider that a problem though.  Price wise- I don't think it's as crazy priced as everyone always says. It's doable for a special occasion.

Ordinarily, I couldn't rationalize forking over the cash for a fancy dinner at Il Mulino. And maybe that's because it was just OK.  I walked into the restaurant on Sunday night for my 8pm reservation. The place seemed to be packed with younger people who probably had the same idea as me (i.e, try a big fancy expensive restaurant on the cheap). The hostess took our coats and we ventured upstairs to the dining room. We sat down and..boom! All of sudden there were a team of waiters at our table putting napkins on our laps, filling water glasses, going over the wine list and cutting chunks of parmesan out of a gigantic cheese wheel! It was pretty overwhelming and didn't give us girls a chance to sit down and chit-chat.  The complimentary appetizers were a nice touch- bruschetta, zucchini chips, pepperoni, and a yummy bread basket. The waiter came over again to spout of the specials and hand us the ""regular menu"" . It was almost like he saved the Restaurant Week menu for last like he didn't really want us to order from it. Oh well. All us girls came for the cheapy menu.  To start, I had the caprese salad. I got one slice of a tomato and one slice of mozzarella.  For my main course, I went with the Herb Roasted Chicken. The chicken was spiced really well. The side was supposed to be rosemary potatoes but they looked more like the hash browns you get at Denny's. I'm not dissin' Denny's, but I expected a little more from fancy shmancy Il Mulino. For dessert, I had the lemon sorbet which was really refreshing.  The waiter also came around with complimentary peach grappa. A nice touch..but yuck. I don't think I'm the grappa type.

The food I found to be pretty average, in my mind the point of restaurant week is to appeal to a new population of individuals who don't frequent your restaurant.  Unfortunately, Il Mulino fell far below my expectations in execution.  With such a large group we were able to try everything from the tasting menu, I had the caprese salad, ravioli and coconut sorbet.  The complimentary parmesan reggiano and the sorbet were the best parts of the meal for me... not a good thing.",0.96,0.81,0.147,0.042,0.6076731601731602
2010-02-26,5.0,"I had an absolutely dreamy dinner here at Il Mulino. It was a combination of the wine, the mood lighting, flicker of candle light, the mystery of an old mansion, being treated like royalty by the staff, and the great food.  One of the things that makes this place special is all the complimentary appetizers they bring you as soon as you sit down: fried zucchini chips, prosciutto, parmesan cheese (brought out and cut fresh right off the wheel), an assortment of bread including garlic bread, and a really fantastic bruschetta with fresh tomatoes. I ordered the eggplant rollatine to start, which was good but not great, the herb roasted chicken for my entree, which was delicious and cooked perfectly (not too dry) and served with rosemary potatoes (so good I felt like I was eating tater tots), and the coconut sorbet for dessert (cue choir singing ""ahhhhhhhhh""). Also had a taste of my friend's veal piccata in a butter and lemon sauce, which was scrumptious and by far my favorite dish. Don't order the cheesecake, it's a thin slice of cake, not your usual cheesecake. Service from the staff was fantastic, except for our actual waiter, let's just nickname him Carrot Top (seriously, not kidding, he looked just like Carrot Top, same hair and all). He was not overly friendly and came to our table only a few times while other staff checked in on us throughout the meal and I absolutely loved the endearing older gentleman who kept asking ""May I?"" before taking our plates. Why yes, nice polite man, you may take my plate.  They save the best surprise for last--another freebie--a glass of grappa to go with your dessert. FYI, if you don't know what grappa is, it's an Italian brandy that is between 37%-60% alcohol. So if you weren't falling over already from the wine, you will be falling under the table after you're finished with your glass of grappa. Bathrooms are upstairs and the spiral staircase can be tricky to climb (especially after that grappa!) so be careful. This is destination dining Italian style, so take your time and sit back and relax because the staff will not rush you here. Clientele tends to be on the older side, but a great place for a romantic dinner and/or special occasions.

At first, I was thoroughly impressed with the wait staff and how attentive they were to us. We were immediately brought out bruschetta, fried zucchini chips, parmesan and Italian sausage. The bruschetta was probably the best I've had in a very long time! The tomatoes were really fresh and the olive oil was delicious. However, as the night wore on the wait staff appeared less and less at our table and we were sitting there for long periods of time first waiting for our dessert and then waiting for our check. Not to mention, there was this light that would literally switch on and off every 10 - 20 minutes or so. At first, we thought they were setting the ""mood"", but after awhile it was just down right annoying!  For our starter we both ordered the eggplant Rollatine, we both agreed it was pretty good, but I was definitely a little let down. The sauce was pretty flavorful, the cheese was very light and tasty and the sautéed spinach was OK (my garlic appeared burnt in mine).  For our main course I ordered the Ravioli Porcini and it was out of this world! It was amazing, the sauce was rich and decadent, the filling was substantial and tasty, and it was delish. My boyfriend, however, ordered the Veal Piccata, and had to send it back! He was not happy with the flavor or quality of his dish what-so-ever. He ended up getting the ravioli and was happy. The dessert was very strange to me. I ordered the Cheesecake and once again was very let down. I received two tiny slivers of what appeared to be bread on my plate! My boyfriend ordered the Lemon Sorbet and that was very good! It came in a frozen lemon and he ate it right up! We also received peach flavored grappa to end the meal and I thought that was a very nice touch. It actually reminded me of being in Italy when they would serve us Limoncella at the end of our meal!!  For how much we paid even though it was Restaurant Week I definitely expected something more.

2010-02-25,5.0,"Get out the stretchy pants...it's Chicago Restaurant Week!! One of my favorite, and most fattening, weeks of the year. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately for the diet), I've been out of town the first half of the week so I didn't get to indulge until last night.  And the wait was well worth it.  I've been wanting to try Il Mulino forever and ever, but the menu prices have scared me away since they opened a few years ago. It seems a bit expensive for Italian food when I can get an uh-mazing meal at La Scarola for about half the price. However, when I saw they were participating in Chicago Restaurant Week I rallied the gals. For me Restaurant Week is all about trying the places that are unaffordable during the rest of the year and Il Mulino fit the bill perfectly. My friends and I sat down and within minutes several waiters had placed chunks of parmesan cheese (mmm), zucchini chips (mmm), perfectly soft yet crispy bread (mmmm), bruschetta (mmmm) and prosciutto (mmmm) on our table.  Wow, no wonder their menu prices are so high with this many complimentary appetizers!  We were in appetizer heaven, but wait...there was still a 3 course meal in our future. I attempted to order the healthiest options on the menu: Appetizer: Caprese Salad Entree: Salmon Dessert: Coconut Sorbet All of the above was incredible, although it was the coconut sorbet that really blew me away. By far the best sorbet I've had.  I also stole bites of some of the other plates on the table: eggplant appetizer (unbelievable), the veal (pounded oh so lightly) and the cheesecake dessert.  The cheesecake dessert was really good, but I""d save yourself the calories and go the coconut sorbet route. Service was a bit on the slow side (took a loooong time to get our check), but it's the type of place where you sit and enjoy your meal for awhile.  My friends and I never run out of things to say so it gave us plenty of time to catch-up. I left racking my brain for upcoming special occasions because I need to go back to this fabulous restaurant located in the most adorable house.  I still find the normal menu prices to be on the expensive side, but now I know after last night's delish meal it's well worth it!

2010-01-01,1.0,"Went there for new years eve dinner. Supposedly this dinner included a wide variety of appetizers. When I asked about this the guy was very rude and pointed at our small plate of gross deep fried zuchini and said ""you got your appetizers! Your bread, your zuchini, what else did you expect!?"" Alright, no big deal. We were a large party of 16 so we asked if we could have the 4 of us at the end on a separate tab to keep things straight at the end of the night. Long story short, they overcharged us over $150 dollars on the total bill and charged us for the ""complimentary"" shots they gave us at the end of the night that we did not even ask for. When we asked them nicely what this was all about they went on a rampage talking about how they have never had to split up bills before and that's what caused this mess. The one waiter started telling me that he doesn't make any money but he will ""pay for my ravioli"" that they overcharged me on. Overall I wasn't too happy with how it was handled. To be fair, the house wines were great and the atmosphere was awesome. BUT, I will never go back there again due to sub-par food (for the price) and HORRIBLE service.

At one point, I went to the ladies room, and three guys practically carried me - service! The bartender was attentive and great, and gave us a complimentary little nosh of zucchini chips, parmesan cheese (mmmmm) and garlic bread. Nice! This review is for the bar area only, but the food smelled great. If the food is as good as the service, I hope to return! The only glitch, and this is due to the location, I'm sure.

2009-09-19,2.0,"This restaurant clearly markets itself as being very authentic and boasts itself as being ""very Italian"". Upon entering, you're greeted warmly with a ""buona sera"". I suppose I had very high expectations given the VERY high prices and the renowned reviews from others. The food was really good - we had the vongole casino which were excellent, my husband had the risotto ai frutti di mare and I had the veal chop sage. We also had the tartufo for dessert. BUT.... for a place that charges as much as it does and tries to create an aura of authenticity, I believe it failed. I realize I may be coming off as a bit of a snob when I write this, but too bad. Strike 1 - huge pet peeve of mine - calling the complimentary bruschetta, BREWSHETTA!!! There are NOT two ways to pronounce this, and whoever tells you there are is grossly mistaken. The Italian language is relatively simple. Except for just a few rules, if a letter is there, it is pronounced. This particular word falls under one of the few rules. ""s-c-h followed by an I or an E is pronouned ski or ske, respectively. That's it. End of discussion. Strike 2 - the server and staff speaking Spanish and trying to make it come off as if it were Italian. If we were called Senor y Senorita one more time, I was going to lose it. Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with speaking Spanish - but NOT in an elegant Italian restaurant. And not when the proprietors are clearly attempting to create an ""Italian experience of authenticity"". Strike 3 - Upon my husband being presented with his risotto ai FRUTTI DI MARE, the busboy asked if he would like any fresh ground pepper and/or some GRATED PARMIGIANO!!!! I realize the customer is always right, and if they want it you should oblige. BUT anyone who knows Italian food, knows you should NEVER put grated cheese on fish! EVER!!!! So, don't offer it. As Tony Shalhoub's character Primo says in the movie ""Big Night"", ""if you teach them, they will learn."" To conclude, it was very good food with a few complimentary items served upon being seated (which I'm sure are buried in the item prices), but the managers really need to train their staff better. As a result it did not meet my expectations. If you want to check it out for a special occassion (as we did), then you should.

We made a tactical mistake earlier in the evening by heading to Eno wine bar in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel for pre-dinner wine.  I say ""mistake"" not because of Eno, but because we simply couldn't pass up the cheese selection pre-dinner.  By doing so, was stuffed and too full for dessert at Il Mulino, but first things first. Because our anniversary fell on a weeknight, we knew this place wouldn't be packed.  Fantastic service with an entire fleet of people waiting on your table.  I won't go into details on the Parmesean tableside, complimentary appetizer, great wine selection (everyone else has said the same) but I will comment on the food... Being a cook and foodie myself I appreciated three things:  1. The chicken parmesean was so finely pounded out, crisp and flavorful that I had to rank it as the absolute best I've had.   2.  There is a pre-serve prep station within eyeshot from a few of the tables that allows servers to mix the pasta and sauce at the absolute last minute for prime presentation and flavor.  I think it probably has something to do with the layout of the restaurant, being that it is an old mansion designed for living not serving. 3.  As mentioned before, we didn't do dessert, but I appreciated the post-meal grappa offer from a copper decanter.  Nice touch.

From the outside, it's a classy, old-fashioned brownstone that's been slightly updated for comfort (i.e. warming lamps in winter) without compromising the aesthetics of the facade.

If you're claustrophobic and enjoy huge industrial loft-like decor, this might not be your thing, but for those who enjoy little nooks and crannies in rooms, this place is totally cute. I came here with the bf for a romantic dinner and we were seated in an alcove on the second floor. I loved the decor - intimate, and Italian without being garish like, say, Buca di Beppo. Weird moment - our amuses (bread, prosciutto, olives, etc.) were already laid out when we got to our seats. On one hand it felt very personal, but at the same time it made me wonder how long it was lying out before we'd gotten there/ if the table was already taken. Either way, a little unusual. They bring out the parmesan in traditional big blocks and carve it out for you by hand right at the table, which is a nice touch. The specials we tried were not the best Italian I've ever had in my life, but they were nicely seasoned/portioned, as to be expected. The bill was pretty sizeable for two...as to be expected.

2008-05-12,1.0,"I am SHOCKED that anyone gave this place more than one star.  Heck, if it were possible to give it negative stars, I would.  Yes, others have mentioned the horrible service but none have really mentioned how awful the food is! I am appalled at the state of cuisine in this city if this passes for Italian food.  It is not only inauthentic, it's just plain bad. What makes it worse is the fact that the service is really atrocious, the patrons seem to have been pouring in from the suburbs to have a ""big city experience,"" each of whom seemed to be louder and more backwater than the next, with people shouting from all corners...  and no, I'm not trying to impugn the suburbs of having only low class denizens as Chicago has them as well, but I couldn't help but overhear various suburban locales being shouted out among the hubub.  Locals (and visitors who like great food):  AVOID THIS PLACE!  I cannot stress this enough.  People who know absolutely nothing about Italian food:  feel free to patronize this horrible establishment.  You're the reason why places like this and Maggiano's stay in business.  Have fun with your pomodoro sauces infused with sugar or honey, your overly-garlicked bread and flavorless carbonara (which is VERY hard to screw up by the way!)...  while Southern Italian cuisine is more ""flavorful"" than the more subtle and fantastic dishes of Northern Italy, this restaurant kicks the cooking far south of Sicily, far west of the Italian-American overly-sauced kitchens of little Italy in Philly or New York, and frankly, is the second-worst Italian restaurant in the city, the first being Maggiano's.  The only thing that saved this restaurant from being the absolute worst is that one of the hosts was actually Italian (but he should truly be ashamed to be working here).  It has been some time since I've given less than a 20% tip but my 15% was far more than the waiter deserved.  It was a full twenty minutes before anyone even came over to offer us MENUS let alone get a drink order...  while most wonderful restaurants are deserving of a three-hour meal given the various amuse-bouches, the multifarious courses, the fantastic flavors, this was NOT among them.  I cannot stress enough how awful this place is and how you should RUN away from this hole.  There are some really fantastic places in Chicago, so don't waste any thought in even considering this place.  Your wallet and palate will thank you.  It's really a shame, actually.  While Bigg's wasn't fantastic, it certainly wasn't anywhere near the caliber of dreadful that embodies this place.  Did I mention I didn't like it?  I'm all for giving places second or even third chances since every place can have an off night, but this was so incredibly putrid that I refuse to let them have any more of my hard-earned cash.  It's taken a few weeks just to get the callouses off my taste buds.  'Nuff said.",0.7877,0.735,0.136,0.129,0.5544050756007276

The pastas were the highlight but everything was delicious. The meal end with a complimentary dessert sampler and peach grappa.

2008-03-11,3.0,"After reading several gleaming reviews of this restaurant specifically as a ""special occasion"" restaurant, I decided to take my girlfriend here for her birthday. To start, the building is gorgeous, providing a very romantic setting.  There is a fireplace in each dining room, which are rooms in the former mansions in which the restaurant resides.  They immediately serve some tasting dishes as you are seated along with parmigiana reggiano and some bread. My first turn off was the wine recommendations.  I appreciate that this is a fine dining establishment, but the waiter should be able to recommend a range of wines that fit their customer's budget, not exclusively recommending wines over $200 a bottle!  I settled on a wine that they ran out of, so he brought out a substitute, which he said was more expensive but he would only charge me for the bottle I ordered (which he should, but still appreciated). The menu is very extensive, with pastas, meats, and fish.  I obviously cannot appreciate fine Italian food because I have trouble understanding how Mediterranean sea bass can cost $55 at a restaurant.  I thought that was a little ridiculous.  After all the tasting dishes and our starter, neither of us were terribly hungry.  I ended up ordering a simple Amatriciana pasta dish, which was bland.  I think they just put marinara sauce on my dish because I did not taste any prosciutto or onions.  My girlfriend enjoyed her prawns and risotto, so we had one winner at the table. Overall, a good dining experience.  For the price, I certainly would not go back.  I think there are many, many other Italian restaurants in the city that are much better in flavor and consistency. My biggest complaint of the evening was the service.  I phoned the restaurant twice asking them to please bring out a special dessert with a candle at the end of the meal as we were celebrating a birthday.  At the end of our meal, no dessert, no candle!  I said something to the waiter afterwards, and he said it wasn't his fault and that I should talk to my other waiter.  I wasn't looking to place blame here, I just wanted them to know how badly they dropped the ball.",0.9797,0.794,0.139,0.067,0.46481829573934846

Before we get into the meal, I must mention this:  Il Mulino is one of the most beautiful settings for a meal that I've ever seen.  Located in the historic Biggs mansion, Il Mulino is pure opulence - high ceilings, dark woods, huge chandeliers.   Now, let's get to the meal.  Before you even get to your salad, a massive amount of free goodies will be foisted upon you.  And they are all great (I love you, bruschetta).  But use caution.  Do not do as I did and load up on the freebies. Why?  Because the main courses are positively massive.  Fortunately, Il Mulino does not employ the Maggiano's theory of ""quantity over quality,"" because everything I tried was fantastic.  The pastas are clearly homemade, the seafood is fresh, and the osso bucco is fall-off-the-bone tender. Top it off with some of the most attentive and cordial service around, and it is clear that this place is a winner.  It is perfect for both a romantic date and a business dinner.",0.9943,0.774,0.226,0.0,0.5773214285714285

Was disappointed to be seated next to a group of 10 in for a convention who apparantly thought they were at TGIFridays.  Even the wait staff was embarassed for them.  A recent trend in New York and London is to not take reservations from group of more than six.  I originally hated the idea, now can see that it really does make sense.  Food was very good, including all of the wonderful little treats they bring at the very beginning.  Some of the entrees were blander than we expected.  Osso bucco was a bit hit, as was all the fish.  Loved my pasta...fresh ingredients, just the right amount of sauce.

The initial deluge of food is welcoming as well. Highly recommended if you want to differentiate from some of the other high-end steakhouse-type restaurants.  Service: Unpredictable. Evening service is apparently based on a team of captain, waiter, and numerous SA's. At first it's overwhelming, and then later you feel like they've lost interest in you. Additionally, sometimes it seems like they don't think before they act, which can be not only distracting but potentially ruin your experience. They are often like robotic monkeys, but at least they are not flinging poo at you.  Environment: Dark as hell. I'm not really bothered by this, but it's something to consider.

2007-01-15,4.0,"Il Mulino is one of those places that I would recommend for a romantic dinner- but not for a business dinner which seems to be what I have been on all the times I have been there. The first time I went- we were seated in the bar and it was sooo dark that I couldn't even read the menu.  When I asked about it- I was told that because the space is so crowded (and it was) they use the dark to provide ""space"" between the tables.  Interesting approach. I told my colleague that I had not been on such a romantic dinner in years!!!   The waiter did have a small flashlight which he shined over my shoulder on to the menu to help me read!   The subsequent times I went, I sat in the dining room to the left of the main entrance and it was much better.  Didn't need all that ""romantic ambiance"" with people who want to do business with me. The Biggs mansion is as beautiful as ever.  It is a pleasure just to sit at the bar and look at the beautiful oak doors and to imagine a time when this was someone's house!  The bartender is friendly and pours a nice glass of wine. The food is great and the wine list is equally as impressive.  Try the osso bucco or the lamb- both are some of the best in the city!  The sea bass is also delicious.  The complimentary antipasto starters are good but be sure to save room for dessert!  We had a little tray of varietal desserts and they all were good. I actually got used to all the serving people hovering around after my first visit, although I did personally question the addition of a tip for the captain on our bill.  While he was pretty pretentious the first time I was there- on subsequent visits, he actually recognized me and welcomed me back - the sign of a great restaurant recognizing its patrons!

2006-11-28,4.0,"We were very excited to try Il Mulino, being that we living in NY but never tried the one there. We went for my birthday yesterday (Nov. 27th) and it was great, and it met and exceeded our expectations in many ways! First off, the mansion is beautiful and the ambiance is amazing. It is dark and there are chandeliers and we sat next to the fireplace. The portions are huge so be mindful of that when you order. We don't eat meat or chicken so I cannot comment on that but the sea bass we shared was really good and plenty for the two of us. Their ceasar salad is among the best I've had as well. Excellent flavor. We also tried appetizer portions of their pasta. These are large and more like an entree size at any other restuarant. I had the pesto ghnochi. It was very rich and I definately couldn't finish it but the flavor was great. My husband had the mushroom ravioli in a cream/truffle sauce. It was also delectable! The one negative is that the service can be a bit much at times! There is a captain, an assistant waiter and a whole group of bus boys. When we first sat down, there was some antipasti type food already on the table, compliments of the chef. Then, within 15 seconds- 3 or 4 more items were delivered to us and it was very overwhelming! We had to just laugh. After that, things calmed down... The other criticism I have is that our captain/head waiter had such a thick Italian (?) accent---we really couldn't understand him at all! He read the specials list, which was quite extensive and we didn't know what he told us! Fortunately, it was all printed on a card. The specials list  is large and seems to be a staple that doesn't change very much. The regular menu paled in comparison to the selections that they call their ""specials"". I say- go, and give it a try! Its a really great experience. And, it helps if you know some Italian b/c you will be greeted with a bunch of words you don't understand. I think it was ""Bueno Sera"" followed by a bunch of things we also didn't understand! Oh, and for the ladies--its really nice to be called ""Bella"" all night by all  the waitstaff!

2006-11-20,4.0,"If you were going to make me define Il Mulino in one word? ""Seussian."" I picture Sneetches and Thing 1 and Thing 2 and the Lorax and other crazy Rube Goldberg like serving utensils flying around our heads as we brace ourselves at the table for the next psychotic occurrence. Let me explain --- Jacky and I were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary this past weekend (thank you, thank you...). Jacky, a former Manhattanite, had dined at Il Mulino New York in their original location while I, on the other hand, had eaten at Bigg's, and had attended events at the Mansion before. So --- my chocolate and her peanut butter being ripe for the combining, Jacky and I decided to go to the relatively new Il Mulino New York in the old Bigg's Mansion on Dearborn to celebrate Friday night. We were greeted at the door of the venerable Gold Coast Manor by an incredibly nice and professional valet. He was clad in a sweater and leather coat, and kicked off the evening in a great way. As we walked into the Mansion, over the Il Mulino doormat, the romantic and dark atmosphere immediately drew us in. However --- we immediately feared for our lives, because there in the shadows lurked a mob of about 20 people. Okay --- jokes aside, there was a host(ess) stand with about 7 staff members, waiters and greeters gathered around, and an immediate mumbled chorus of ""Buona sera...buona sera, dottore, buona sera, bella, sera..."" We sat down and immediately dined on some antipasto and complimentary appetizers (yummy zucchini fritto and fresh chunks of parmesan and salame). We also had two glasses of Prosecco as cocktails. Now --- a couple things to speed things up --- there is a fine dining experience going on here: Wait Captain, multiple backwaiters, busboys and more. This should --- and needs --- to be run in military-like precision. The problem, however, is that it did not. There were way too many hovering moments --- hovering to the point of ""get away from me and let me eat!"" Weird table cloth snapping rituals, marking of silverware that was not even used...yet replaced with an identical piece?! Distracting to the point of concern...the most horrible moment was when our wait captain starting whisking the warm zabaglione (which looked good) tableside at one of our neighbor's tables -- a metal whisk in a metal bowl, for what seemed like an eternity - whiskwshkshwlshlkswhsk...all conversations in the room stopped as the noise continued. Rubbery Silicon-topped whisks, people! They're at Sur La Table for less than 12 bucks!  The kicker? What have I not even talked about yet? The food!  The service in this restaurant was such a distraction that it overshadowed what we both felt was a tremendous 'five star' food experience (Osso Bucco with saffron risotto for me, a red snapper with an amazing wine-sauce and shrimp, mussels, clams and tomato broth for Jacky). There has been some mumbling and grumbling regarding the prices, but we found them to be right on par with any steakhouse in the city (Morton's, Gibson's, et al.), and certainly on par with Ambria, Avenues and others of their ilk. Expensive? Yes --- but that wasn't the issue. We were looking for a romantic ""Anniversary Event"" restaurant, and we found it --- the beautiful 12' tall ceilings of the Mansion, the ambience and lighting, the amazing Italian cuisine, even the dinner's wine presentation. But the romance was almost spoiled by this Cirque de Soleil of Chicago waitstaff. Two words, Il Mulino...settle. Down. Let us relax and enjoy the evening. Calm down the screaming (our wait captain was literally hoarse from shouting the specials and commanding his 389 person waitstaff in the 12' x 12' room), and let the beautiful space you have created be enjoyed in the peaceful manner for which it was intended (a Jacky note: Il Mulino New York in NYC is very peaceful and calm and romantic. A Chris note: seeing as I was not there in NYC, I'm not sure I want to know how romantic it was...). Bottom line -- amazing, amazing food and luxurious location for a romantic special occasion...I recommend it to everyone -- but the reverse Emeril in me wants them to 'take it down a notch' in the service department! NOTE/UPDATE: Just went tonight (5/25/07) with Jacky for dinner...our waiter, Matthew, remembered us from November and treated us great all evening: following some great conversation throughout the evening, he offered a wink and a sampler of desserts -- complimentary -- Jacky asked if I had said something to tip them off, and I laughed and said, 'no!' -- the service overall? comPLETEly sane, and completely delightful...Jacky and I just looked at each other throughout the evening  and smiled. The food was just as good (I had salt-packed Branzino (sea bass), and Jacky had an incredible risotto primavera, and we also shared arancini and grilled octopus), the wine (a Tocai) was tremendous, and we enjoyed a well-paced relaxing evening with none of the 11/17 ""Seussian"" behavior. ahhhh....",0.9993,0.804,0.173,0.023,0.521206030621615
