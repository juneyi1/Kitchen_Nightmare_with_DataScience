Our server was rude and not accommodating AT ALL.  I asked for a glass of water; she grabbed a glass from another place setting where nobody had been sitting (all the ice was melted) and gave it to me.  The food on the buffet was cold, and when and IF it was replenished, the food they brought out was burnt or cold. Not a drop of soap or a square of toilet paper to be found in the bathroom.  The kicker - when it came time to pay the tab, she told us she didn't have any change. We paid in $20 bills.  How do you not have cash on hand? Bottom line - there are so many better places to eat Thai food in this city, and I will NOT be back to Thai Classic.   Go to P.S.

Opart, Thai Oscar, and Spoon are right around the corner - but some days, especially those sick days where NO ONE but the delivery man and whoever lives with you should see your face, delivery is a must.  I've ordered Thai Classic delivery twice in a week. That's a big deal. Why? Their menu isn't huge - which is a great thing, when you don't want to use your brain too much. Too many delicious things to choose from = brain overload. What they do have on their menu, is really solid Thai food. Last night I had the glass noodles with tofu, and will now declare this my go-to Thai Classic dish - glass noodles, veggies, tofu, in a garlic soy sauce. The ""silver noodle"" soup is also a great variation on a noodle soup, and great for cold/flu season - just make sure to choose chicken as your protein. The soups only come in one size, and are small - so if you've looking to steam those sinuses into submission, do what I did and order (at least) 2.

When the bill came, my friends and I split the bill with cash and card.  We asked the waitress if she could deduct the cash from the bill and split the remaining total between the cards.  We told the waitress how much cash there was and also witnessed her counting the cash.  When she returned the cards, we discovered that she ""miscounted"" our cash and overcharged all of the credit cards.  After much discussion, we decided to make her aware of the situation.  Upon hearing her mistake, she simply reached in the cash register and gave us the debated amount.  She was very unapologetic and it made us think she did it on purpose.   I completely understand that sometimes mistakes are made, however, this did not seem like a mistake.",0.785,0.861,0.085,0.054,0.43941102756892225

The entrees were amazing.  Between the three of us we had Panang Tofu (medium), Chicken Curry Noodles (Mild) and Lad Nar Tofu.  I'll start with the Panang Tofu - it was DELICIOUS.  I love panang and it was near the top of best ever.  All I could have wished for was a little more rice to eat up the remainder of the sauce.  They took my empty rice bowl, seeing that half my entree was left and didn't ask me if I wanted more.  (Which was fine anyhow, since we had more than enough food for the three of us on the table and were unable to take home the leftovers.)  Nicely spiced, but could have used a little more heat, especially when compared to my wife's 'mild' curry noodles which were 'hotter' than my medium.   My wife's Chicken curry noodles (mild) were also very delicious and despite them making it spicier than requested, she loved it.  A few times she pushed the bowl away to say she was full, but kept going going back anyhow.  :) Our daughter had the Lad Nar Tofu - it was amazing.  I usually don't like the wide noodle dishes because I an not a fan of their texture.  That was definitely NOT the case here!  They pan fried the noodles a bit before serving them with the (awesome) sauce, tofu and broccoli (which was also perfectly cooked).  The pan frying of the noodles gave then a nuttiness and texture that I have not had at any other place where this dish has been ordered.

The curry had a perfect blend of spices and flavor, and the salmon was good. My PadThai was nicely done, the noodles cooked well, the sauce was sweet and sour, but the chicken was a little overdone and the noodles more broken then I'd like. But the taste was excellent.  I would have to say that the chef/cook here is very meticulous with his/her flavoring. Everything is done with a purpose, and it shows. The Thai ice tea and ice coffee are very good. If you go for lunch, the entrees will come with soup and eggroll. Needless to say, we were stuffed and had to get the rest to-go.

2012-06-07,2.0,"This was a tough one.  Based on the food, I'm sure the all-time review score of 4/5 is accurate.  I wanted to give them 4 stars, potentially even 5, because the curry dishes we ordered were simply amazing. But some things you just can't let slide.  Green Curry with mixed veggies was superb... I chose the 'hot' spice level (mild and medium being the other two choices - how practical!) and it was really good.  Definitely a throat-tingling and eye-watering type of heat, but surprisingly, didn't make my mouth burn.  To me, this is the perfect kind of hot.  My girlfriend's Masaman Curry with chicken, mild spice level (wimp!:-) was where we had a problem, not with the taste, which was again incredible, but with the delivery/packaging (see below).   The other food, fried curry puffs and fried tofu, were run-of-the-mill 'meh' appetizers, tasty but boring.  No points awarded here, but none deducted, either.  I'm not going to count this against them because such items are never really showstopping choices from any restaurant anyway, especially since fried anythings invariably deteriorate during transport. So I won't penalize them for these.  BUT... FAIL TIME. Our major problem was their choice of containers for our curry entrees.  I don't know if they just ran out of good ol' takeout-soup-style Glad ware/tupperware or what, but this was pitiful.  They used these flat, black-bottom-clear-top containers that are meant for dry foods only, not meant for holding liquids, and totally incapable of containing liquid food without serious leaking.  Think of flimsy, one-time-use dollar store containers versus your thick, reusable and recyclable ones that come from any halfway decent takeout/delivery joint.  Pieces of crap, basically.  We could tell they knew these would leak because they just wrapped plastic around them and let the food leak into the plastic.  So both dishes were scalding-hot gigantic messes, contained in saran wrap tied in a knot at that top.  We had to clean our entire kitchen after dinner just from trying to get these things open - splattering curry-laden coconut milk everywhere.   WORST OF ALL, my gf's container was on the bottom of the delivery bag, and the plastic lids on the entrees were just like larger versions of Chinese carryout-style sauce lids - i.e., fragile.  Now, place that on the bottom of a bag filled with pounds of other food, and -presto- you have a shattered lid.  That's right, the lid was crushed from all the other items on top of it and it SHATTERED into her food during transport.  Most of the pieces were large enough to remove at first, so we were able to at least try the food and are able to speak to its amazing taste.  But after a few bites with tiny shards of plastic in every one, she gave up and we threw it out.  They were closing for the night when we called and would not send us a fresh order, but they did refund the cost of the one entree.  That's a half fix at best, especially for the severity of this error and the potential danger involved with trying to eat this.  We ended up at square one - having to cook a meal.  When someone orders delivery, is in not for the express purpose of not having to cook because you either don't have food to cook or don't feel like eating what you have on hand?  Fail. Again, I loved the food... really loved it.  I moved here from NYC so it's been a struggle to find some great Thai, and this joint has what it takes.  Given all the great reviews, I will consider this a fluke and assume they ran out of the correct containers.  I will order from here again, telling them in advance about this experience, and when we get some delicious food without plastic pieces in it, I will come back and give it the 4 or 5 stars I had wanted to.  TRY THIS PLACE, BUT DEMAND THAT THEY TAKE CARE OF YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU ORDER!!!",0.9302,0.777,0.12,0.103,0.610515873015873

That may be the thing to eat in Chicago, and it may even be delicious, but one can only eat it so many times during a single week. Therefore, we stepped into Thai Classic.

I thought that was cool, but since the floor is a long way down for me, we opted to sit in the former area. Our food was excellent. I ordered Pad Thai, and it was perfectly savory and salty and sweet. One of my companions was so-so on Thai, but even she really enjoyed her meal. That's a true sign of a good cook in the back.

I've tried probably half the menu, so I feel like I could claim to know this restaurant very well. First, I'll say that the ambiance is a little odd--I feel like they only let people sit in the front area (even though there is a back seating area?) and during the winter this posed a problem because a very cold breeze often wafts through the restaurant, but whatever. They also have this crazy seating area where you have to take off your shoes and sit on the floor--after eating there dozens of times, it wasn't until very recently that I ever got to sit up there--I was always jealous of the people who had those tables, but now that I've sat, it really wasn't as fun as I thought it would be--I kind of missed my shoes.  As for the food, I've never had something there that I didn't at least like. Sometimes Thai food can be hit or miss, but Thai Classic does everything pretty well. My favorites include the Pad Se Ew and a beef curry noodle dish that is pretty great. The Crab Rangoon are probably some of the better ones around--some restaurants' Crab Rangoon are pretty gross, but Thai Classic has some good ones. They have a catfish-noodle dish that is pretty great too, and perhaps one of the most spectacular dishes I've ever had was the Orchid Chicken that was...omg...served in carved-out half-of-a-pineapple. I didn't believe them when they said it on the menu, but it actually came in a pineapple--totally ridiculous, but absolutely fun.

You can serve as much as you want but please make sure that you eat your portions, due to this raising the prices everywhere.  They gave you a variety of 3 various beverages included in the price, but if you want a Thai Coffee or other special beverage that for another $3 and some change you can get that. But why do that when the beverages are just as nice?

2011-03-27,3.0,"Ah, the Thai restaurant that (re)started it all for me.  Thai Sookdee in Evanston was my first Thai experience, during college, but I didn't have it again until four years later, when a friend who lived in the neighborhood dragged me here almost against my will.  But I owe her a big thanks, because ever since then I have eaten at countless Thai restaurants and consider the cuisine one of my two favorites.  It wasn't that Thai Classic blew me away, but simply that it clued me in that the cuisine in general has a lot to offer my tastebuds.  But...I never went back to Thai Classic for almost EIGHT years!   So...how does a neophyte's recollection stack up to a veteran's discernment?  Eh, it's pretty good...ish.  Silver soup = bland (to me) or satisfying (to my girlfriend), depending on your perspective.  It's glass noodles, tofu cubes, plain broth, green onions, and cilantro.  The ""squid disco"" (just fried calamari) was bad.  I love calamari, and I tend to roll my eyes when people describe it as ""rubbery.""  Sometimes inexpertly cooked calamari can be a little more chewy than the good stuff but to say ""rubbery"" is exaggeratingly finicky.  But this stuff WAS rubbery.  The breading component was fine, the chili dipping sauce was fine, but overall this was a D+. I have to say that the calamari worked better with the sweet dipping sauce provided with the ""rice chips"" that they served before the meal.  I have never seen this at a Thai restaurant, so they get bonus points for that.   Entrees were better.  I had a few, er, um, several (thanks darling) bites of the Vegetable Delight which was a well executed version of your standard, plain, stir-fried vegetables.  My choice was the drunken spicy fried rice, since it seemed the closest approximation on the menu to one of my two Thai standbys--basil fried rice.  This stuff really was spicy, although not so overpowering to keep me from finishing.  I'll give this dish an overall B+; it had a lot of flavor and a bunch of mushrooms and basil leaves, plus the ""fried rice"" angle was not too heavy or greasy. Yesterday I needed heat in my meal, but I'll come back and try the pad thai and the spring rolls when the weather is warm.  Service is a little timid, and if you get there at a peak time you may be forced to sit on the floor on the raised platform instead of at a ""real"" table.  But it's a great spot for eavesdropping on the compelling triumphs and heart-wrenching woes of multiple tables' worth of typical Lakeviewers (yes, please insert eye roll).",0.9966,0.805,0.162,0.033,0.36084656084656075

For a main course I had the Spicy Basil. It was really really nice. It was good and had a nice kick to it. For desert I shared the Coconut ice cream. This was the one let down. It had a hint of coconut flavor but no actual coconut in it. I expected/looked forward to some actual real coconut in the ice cream.

A waitress came right over and gave us waters, but we needed more time to look through the menu since there were so many thing that sounded and looked (menu had pics) good.  I ordered the Som Tom salad and massaman curry with chicken and my friend got the golden cups and basil shrimp.  The golden cups were excellent...very flavorful and the perfect bite size.  I would definitely order these next time.  Som Tom was similiar to others I've had but this seem particularly spicy.  The Massaman curry had tons of chicken and was flavorful...a Thai staple for me that I would order from here again.   The basil shrimp was good, but I probably wouldn't order it for myself.  We got the coconut ice cream to end the meal and it was very refreshing, but not too strong coconut flavor.  The whole meal the wait staff was very attentive with refills and checking in and they were very friendly.

I'm grateful that they offer pork (and not char-su style BBQ pork, which doesn't particularly belong in a Thai restaurant as far as I'm concerned) as a meat selection, and also more seafood options (beyond shrimp, including calamari, scallops and 3 types of fish) than many of the other Thai restaurants in this price range.  I do feel that it is a good value.

2010-05-15,5.0,"I told you that I wasn't really fond of Thai food, didn't I? Well, let me explain a little bit: I actually used to enjoy Thai food... back when I was in good ol' California, where delicious Asian food could always be found. When I first had Thai food in Chicago, the pad thai came out more orange in color and with way too much sauce which made the noodles soggy and gross looking. Ugh. Ever since then, I've decided that maybe Thai food just isn't for me because there were Thai people working in those restaurants and the food still sucked! But anyway, this is a review for Thai Classic Restaurant. Now that you've heard my story, you'll have to be convinced that this is the best Thai restaurant in all of Chicago (ok, granted I haven't tried every single one of them but this is one of the best!). I first came here about a year ago and I only had the tom yum soup (I was hung over), but upon smelling and looking at the food my friends ordered, I knew that this place had to be good. I didn't want to write a review for them solely based on the best tom yum soup I've ever tasted so I waited until today. I know it's shocking I haven't been here in a year... Anyway, I came here today because a friend suggested Thai food at a restaurant that I didn't particularly enjoy. I successfully convinced her to try an even better restaurant. Enter Thai Classic. My mouth was salivating with the thought of what I should order when I enter the restaurant. She suggested the lunch buffet. I decided we should take a look first because other Thai lunch buffets were only mediocre in my opinion. OMG, they had tom yum soup on the buffet line! I'm sold. Ha! I got a small serving of the spicy beef salad and the spicy squid salad, a couple of the pork potstickers, some fried egg noodles, the soy sauce catfish, spicy green curry (trust me, it's spicy even for my Asian-I-can-take-spicy tongue), rice, and of course, my tom yum soup. Everything was delicious! Imagine, if a buffet line serves such delicious food, that only means that their freshly cooked food would be even more awesome! I didn't get the pad thai, but seeing the pad thai on my friend's place confirmed that the pad thai here would be good -- it didn't look ridiculously orange and it didn't have too much sauce.

The crab rangoon and the spring rolls were awesome. Dumplings and chicken satay were good. We did end up ordering two though, so we were fans for sure. For dinner, I went with green curry shrimp, hot. Our server said it would be thai hot - and it was. Score! The cucumber salad was the perfect accompaniment to cool off from the spicy curry. I wish I could tell you what the other gals ate, but I was too wrapped up in mine. I do know that they must have liked it, because we didn't talk much and the plates were pretty much cleaned.  Now, here's where it gets tricky. The service here was kind of weird, and super fast. As we were finishing up our second app sampler, our waitress came by to remove our plates. The problem was that I was still eating my chicken satay, so I had to do it very carefully over a napkin. One of the gals was much smarter and clung to hers. We had a couple different beverages between us which called for a different glass option. It took a couple of tries to get the right one. Also, our server was like ninja fast! Never have I ever not made it through a bottle of booze. This was a first for me. When I do dinner out with pals, I like to linger and gossip. Not really what our server had in mind.

2010-03-16,4.0,"*A FOUR and 1/2 stars if I could... In a highly unusual case, I was actually really impressed with the dishes that I tasted at Thai Classic Restaurant. Let me just get this out of the way and say that I hate it when Americans use 'Pad Thai' as a litmus test for Thai restaurants to pass. If anything, it makes the pad thai so... American. I originally hail from Southeast Asia, and in my 7 years of living in the States, I have been more underwhelmed by Thai food than any other cuisine.  I think that a big part of the problem is finding the right ingredient, fresh ingredient, colors that don't exist naturally in this part of the world. THAT ALL said, the food here tastes quite authentic to me.  I had the garlic basil shrimp, green curry chicken, pad kee mao and tom yum soup. They were all perfect. I highly recommend the garlic basil shrimp. Oh and save room for the coconut ice cream. Prices are reasonable and its BYOB.

2010-02-28,4.0,"I came here for lunch on a cold afternoon and had a hankering for some Thai food. Apparently they have a buffet that seemed decent, but as I scanned the selection, I noticed a serious lack of vegetarian options so I opted for the menu items which gladly was more veggie friendly. Some of the tables are low and are ""sit pretzel style"" so that seemed cute although I'm sure I couldn't take the lack of back support. I ordered the ""Drunken Noodles"" ($7.95) which were these wide noodles with carrots, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, basil in a sweet/spicy sauce. It was tasty! The big complaint I have about some Thai places is that they tend to put a lot of sugar or something that make a lot of their dishes sickeningly sweet. I suppose this is to appease the American palate that loves the sugar and salt. Hmm, how can we obliterate the delicate flavors of our dishes? I know let's put MSG, too much sugar, or too much salt or fat! /end foodie rant. Well like I said, that didn't seem like the case here. They care about their food.

2010-02-10,5.0,"One advantage I love about going out to eat with a group of friends is trying a little bit of everything. And Thai Classic was perfect for this! I was with a small group and we waited a little bit for a table but not too bad for a weekend night. It was a very busy night as we could see. Of course we each had a bottle of wine and set it on the table and waited for a server. And waited. And waited. One thing you do not want to do to this particular group is keep them waiting for their booze, trust me. We had no glasses and no way to open our wine and probably waited a good 15 minutes before anyone came over and spoke to us, which, I thought, was too long. But things got better quickly once we had a drink in our hand and started ordering apps.   One item you do not want to miss out on here is the ""Golden Cups, "" which are flaky pastry cups filled with a delicious blend of minced chicken, corn kernels & herbs. The corn was so sweet and juicy, a really tasty blend of flavors and crunch. I wish we had ordered more of these mini morsels. I cannot go to a Thai restaurant and not order soup. It's a must-have and most of the time they are right on. Thai Classic's Tom Yum with shrimp was more than 'right on.' Just perfection. Tons of heat, big juicy shrimp and just enough citrus. I was guzzling wine, trying to put the fire out in my mouth after biting into one of the floating peppers. Love it! Everyone's dishes were awesome. I was happy to have split a tempura pad thai, as it was PLENTY for 2 after all the apps we had just devoured. Fresh, beautiful, hot. Exactly how it should be. Great place for groups or a date. You have the options of sitting on the floor which would be fun if you're not in a skirt, or at a regular table. I would have loved a little more attention from our server, but, I know she was slammed.

2009-12-08,3.0,"Ordered delivery from here last night to try something new. I usually order from Pho's Hot and Spicy. It took about an hour for the food to get to my apartment. That was annoying, but in all fairness, we were warned it would take that long. Delivery fee was 3$.  We ordered the Thai rolls, Gai Yaang, and the Chicken Pad Thai. The Thai rolls were OK. Some were crispy, some were soggy. The Gai Yanng looked very interesting. It was a butterflied boneless bbq chicken breast served over a bead of kind of somewhat soggy lettuce--wrapped in tin foil to keep it warm. All and all the chicken was OK, but definitely not deserving of anything more than three stars. It really was just a marinated and dressed chicken breast and not much else. The pad thai was pretty standard. Better than duck walk though (that place sucks and makes me sick to my stomach without fail). Reader: keep in mind that I do not like spicy food, so I order everything mild.  The total bill was 25$. This place was a bit less sketchy than Pho's Hot and Spicy, but I would argue that the pad thai at Pho's is a hair better. I do trust the chicken (I would never order beef) at Thai Classic a bit more though. I don't know why, but I am very untrustworthy of meat from delivery services. Perhaps it is because I can not go to the actual establishment to see where it is prepared.  I don't really understand why most people gave this 5 stars. I rated this three stars against the thai places in the city (i.e. le colonial) not just the thai delivery places in lakeview. Perhaps that is the reason for the discrepancy.  So, in essence, when ordering from Thai Classic, do not expect 5 star thai food.

I've probably walked past Thai Classic hundreds of times & never given it a second thought. Wow. We've been missing out! After having a miserable experience last time we tried a new Thai place it was time to try something new again. So we crossed our fingers,  scoured Yelp & grubhub for a new place & came up with Thai Classic. Went through reviews again for some recommendations on what to order & here's what we went with: Golden Cups: Unique & delicious bite-sized awesomeness. Chicken, curry, peas, carrots & cilantro. We adored them. Every order from Thai Classic will always include this. Tom Kha: Bizarrely white. I know every Thai restaurant is going to have their own recipe, but I'm used to seeing some chili-red in there. Nonetheless, it tasted great (possibly a bit bland?), the chicken was super soft & it was fairly filling. Not my favorite Tom Kha, but edible. Pad Thai w/veggies & fried tofu: Pad Thai is my barometer of Thai places. It's like ordering a plain slice in a pizza place, a piece of tuna sushi in a sushi restaurant, or broccoli w/fried tofu in garlic sauce in a Chinese restaurant. If they can't get that right then you know you're in trouble. This was the best pad thai I've had in ages. But I didn't love it. It was sadly a bit dry. But loaded with gorgeously cut vegetables, an  abundance of tofu, peanuts, & flavor. If you like pad thai you'll really enjoy it. I'm just not sure I like pad thai anymore. Which kind of makes me sad. Next time; the masaman curry. I'm too big of a spice wuss to try panang. Jimmy Salad: I have fried tofu issues. Seriously. I'll eat it in tons of forms & love it. This was a simple lettuce, onion, pepper salad topped with fried tofu & served with peanut sauce & sweet & sour. It came in one of those huge styrofoam containers & I'm pretty sure I can make 3 salads out of it. All the vegetables were generous, cut well & fresh.  Crab Rangoon: Who doesn't love a place that offers free crab rangoon? These are either baked or somehow fried without oil & greasiness. They're tiny--think tortellini sized; but they're also quite good. Thai iced tea: Perfectly made, way too much ice, WAY too small a cup. I finished it in about 4 sips. This was probably my biggest (and only) complaint about the meal. We ordered through grubhub & made a few special requests (extra tofu & peanut sauce), delivery service was fast, everything was correct & the delivery guy was as sweet as could be.

Steak so flavorful, spicy deliciousness. The word ""num"" isn't in this dish for nothing!  5 stars. 6.  Ginger Chicken Stir Fry:  lots of veggies, great taste, but not as good as the Garlic Chicken (which is what I meant to order).  4 stars. The waiters are always SOOO super nice here and I appreciate the fact that everyone is Thai (although I bet they don't realize that I am too...half counts!).  This is def my fave Thai place I've ever been to.  So fun with a group (due to the BYOB policy and everyone's general happiness w/their food) and also just for a casual meal when you don't feel like cooking.

There was a showdown on Clark between PS Bangkok and Thai Classic. We go to PS Bangkok because ""it looked nicer"" and, what? Excuse me? $10 corkage fee? No thanks. We walk over to Thai Classic and are greeted warmly and ushered to the back room, which I wasn't expecting - this place is bigger than it looks from the outside! The menu is overwhelmingly expansive and full of things I've not seen at many other Thai places in Lakeview or the city. The menu features pictures of many of the dishes, which is very helpful. There are a LOT of seafood options. Solid appetizer options include the Golden Cups (a must!), Thai Rolls, Disco Squid.  The Drunken Noodles are spicy, yummy, and mind-blowing. The Trio is a great non-spicy option. The green curry will knock your socks off. The Seafood Ginger is another strong performer.  I recently went back for my 3rd visit for my birthday with a group of friends. We were seated on ""the floor"" which was fun. Service was great, even for a group of 8. The table was large and we had no problem fitting all of our food and beer/wine on it.  Service is good - very relaxed which is refreshing since many other BYOBs rush you to get you in and out - not the case here. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu offerings.

And than the shrimp tempura pad thai. It could bring a person to tears it's so delicious. I usually skip pad thai anymore and go for curries or other specials. You don't want to do that here. Quite possibly the best pad thai in the city. Flavorful and lovely with big pieces of perfectly crisp, light shrimp tempura. And another dipping sauce. I poured it on well, everything. It was finger licking good sauce, in fact you could almost eat your finger off if you weren't careful. I'm just saying. Big enough portion to split with the other apps we had but next time I might need an order just for me.  And to end try their house-made coconut ice cream. Just do.

I had the Pad Thai with Shrimp Tempura and it was so large my friend and I split it.  They may make the best Pad Thai in the city and the addition of the light tempura was delish.

All portions were GENEROUS. Other highlights: Spinach Dumplings: excellent on their own and superb with the spicy dippin sauce.  Chicken Satay: big pieces; tender and delicious. Crab Rangoon: best I've had in Chicago. Plumb, large and not greasy. Disco Squid: light batter; tender calamari. mmmmmm Seafood Tom Yum soup: just right. Minor annoyance: my salmon pad thai was really regular pad thai with an overcooked piece of salmon. But, I'd try it again with a cautionary request of the Chef. It had great potential. The service was first rate.  We were triple teamed by the friendly, attentive staff. Environs: A lovely pleausure removing our shoes and sitting at the sunken table.

It's so good that I'm actually surprised it's on Clark St. (seeing how Wrigleyville is such a touristy spot). The decor is warm and inviting, and the staff there is very friendly and patient. They will be happy to make recommendations and answer questions you will have.  I've had a numerous number of dishes at Thai Classic. A few I recommend are: All the curries, especially the Panang Gai Yang Tom Kha Soup Moo Ping (My fiance goes nuts for their Moo Ping) Curry Fried Rice (not on the menu, but ask for it) Orchid Chicken Thai Classic has a great combination dinner platter.

I've been to Thai Classic a dozen or so times before, but hadn't been there in two years or so, mainly because I don't live as close to it as I used to.  I was responsible for planning a reasonably-priced BYOB dinner event for my team, and I am known at work as a BIT of a foodie, so I had to pick a place I knew wouldn't tarnish my reputation. Thai classic delivered.  The seven of us ordered various appetizers and six entrees, which we shared around (if you don't eat Thai food family-style, don't bother inviting me).  The place was a major hit with my team.  I won't go dish-by-dish through the meal, but I will say that we ordered two panang entrees (beef and chicken), and it was so good that we actually ordered more rice TWICE so that people could sop up that delicious sauce and gobble it up. I'll go on record one more time: Thai Classic has the best panang I have ever had.  Their panang may just be my favorite food in the world.  It may be better than Morton's bone-in ribeye cooked medium rare.  It may even be better than freshly-made rice krispey treats eaten straight out of the pan.

You might say. Well, I'd never had it before, but I'd heard it on an episode of South Park (the 'It Hits the Fan' episode where Cartman talks about how it should be a swear word) and I had to try it. Delivery was quick, and the driver was super sweet. He handed me the menu and told me that next time I ordered I could use the coupon on it. The food arrived piping hot, and the portions were a good size. We ordered the shrimp pineapple curry, pad thai, thai egg rolls, cucumber salad, and of course: the mee krob. Now, I don't eat shellfish, but the shrimp pineapple curry was awesome (though I'd skip the shrimp, since I don't eat them). We ordered it super-spicy, and it was- it made my nose run- which is a really good thing. The flavor of the curry was out of this world. Really, really good. The pad thai was also really good- it wasn't dry, but wasn't swimming in sauce, it had a good amount of peanuts and great flavor. The boyfriend practically inhaled the egg rolls. They were mini ones, they had a thin (not thick and lumpy) crispy skin, and they were really tasty. The cucumber salad was crisp and refreshing (and there was a good amount of it for the price). Now, the mee krob. The best way I can describe it is sort of like a savory sweet and sour 'rice crispie treat' except with fried noodles and bits of fried tofu. It was kind of neat, but if you're weird on textures I'd probably skip it. I wouldn't agree with Eric Cartman, though, the taste was pretty good.

In addition to being foodies, my friends and I also enjoying cooking.  And competition.  So, we had an Iron Chef party at my buddy, Mike's, house.  It was battle: citrus and the competition was going to be fierce.  I wanted to make something that highlighted the secret ingredient but was also crowd-pleasing and palatte-friendly.  I came up with a great recipe/idea for a Thai Citrus Curry Chicken.  I experimented with the right blend of spices, meat preparation and citrus combinations for days in order to make something awesome.  What I didn't plan on, however, was making the accompanying Jasmine rice; I couldn't just serve the curry by itself.  Was my plan for Iron Chef dominance to be foiled?  Gack! Luckily, I called Thai Classic at the 11th hour and put in an order for a tray of Jasmine rice...about an hour before I needed it.  The woman on the phone was gracious and kind and she assured me that the order wouldn't be a problem.  Great!  I put the final touches on my dish, got the plating together, hopped in the shower and made my way to Thai Classic.  As promised, the manager had a tray of piping hot, aromatic Jasmine rice waiting for me.  $10 later, I was out the door and on my way to the West Loop. Three minutes into my drive, I got a call on my cell phone from the restaurant.  Turns out that the manager was not happy with the rice that she gave me and wanted to know if I could come back and get a new tray.  I wasn't that far away, so I turned around and came back.  I parked in front, threw on the hazards and exchanged the rice AND got an order of crab wontons for my troubles.  She was very apologetic about having to have me come back but, after I left, she discovered that she wasn't very pleased with the rice and didn't want to have me pay for anything but her best. As I drove to the party, I couldn't stop thinking about how impressed I was with what just happened.  I'd already paid.  I'd driven away.  It would be a while before I discovered anything 'wrong' with the rice (and who knows if I even would).  But this manager's pride in her food and sense of doing right by me as a customer compelled her to give me a call.  That's beyond cool.  How many people would have done that?  She already had my money.  I was out of sight.  It was a done deal.  The fact that she thought enough of her food's reputation and me as a customer to call me back and give me her best...well, that's aces in my book.  I'm quick to bellyache when I get screwed.  It's nice to be able to report something good, for a change. Oh yeah, the Iron Chef party.  The rice was a big hit (she gave us tons).  I shaped it in a small funnel, stacked it in a bowl, surrounded it by the curry and topped with (the various citrus) zest.  You know I won.  First place, baby!  That Jack Lalanne Power Juicer prize was all mine (and it's AWESOME).",0.9976,0.796,0.162,0.042,0.5690708101422387

2005-11-21,3.0,"Tried their Saturday buffet lunch.  Nice selection of Thai food and desserts, especially for vegetarians.  They did a nice job with the squid salad - tender and not rubbery at all.  Fried whitefish was terrible.  Beef entrees tended to be overcooked and tough, however I have yet to taste beef that has been done well at a Thai restaurant.  Grilled chicken was decent, especially when eaten with the peanut sauce that was for the chicken satay.  The noodles in the tofu pad thai were done well and not greasy.  The much anticipated coconut ice cream was absent on the buffet (perhaps it is a la carte only).  Available desserts included fried bananas, assorted cut fruit, pudding cake and stewed pumpkin in coconut milk.  Will try the buffet at PS Bangkok across the street next time.  Another excellent thai lunch buffet worth trying is at Baisi Thai on Mag Mile where they have an excellent spicy sauteed shrimp and mixed mushroom salad.  Wait staff deserve kudos for being very attentive and coming around multiple times to make certain things were fine.  I'd forgo sitting on the floor; Can be a pain for the ladies wearing boots this time of year - having to put your shoes on everytime you hit the buffet line.",0.936,0.84,0.116,0.044,0.686734693877551
2005-09-15,5.0,"One of the few buffets in Chicago that I really enjoy. On the weekends, they have a great buffet filled with all sorts of amazing thai dishes. And if you're not really a all-you-can eat buffet fan (?!?!), then there's a pretty extensive menu you can browse through and order from as well. The service here is excellent and the decor and ambience are very sophisticated. This place is an excellent choice for a good, enoyable meal at an affordable price. Oh, make sure to save room for dessert -- the coconut ice cream is amazing!",0.9921,0.641,0.359,0.0,0.7194444444444444
2005-08-18,5.0,Almost a perfect Thai restaurant. The decor and ambiance make you feel far from Chicago. Great food and a great price make this Thai restaurant a favorite of mine. Sunday is my favorite day there with the all you can eat buffet featuring dozens and dozens of items. Get a group together and sit on the floor with your shoes off and enjoy a great Sunday brunch.,0.9774,0.688,0.312,0.0,0.84375
2005-08-14,5.0,"This has been my all-time favorite Thai restaurant for 13 years. The combination of ambience, quality of food, price and BYOB can't be beat. Pad Thai, a signature yet simple dish, is always a good test for a Thai restaurant, and they pass brilliantly. In fact it seems they've recently spruced up their recipe, perhaps in response to competition like Vong's Thai Kitchen downtown, which actually does better Thai Classic, but at more than twice the price. Their curries and drunken noodles are also excellent. Sundays feature an all-you can eat buffet where you can sample everything. The floor tables are great fun -- take off your shoes and play footsie. I think it's family run, and they've been doing it a long time, so the service is tip top.",0.9828,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.5231292517006804
