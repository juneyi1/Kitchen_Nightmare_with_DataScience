A flood of soulless restaurant-group ""concepts"" have opened over the last 12 months along Wells Street and I guess those appeal to the rural state transplants who grew up eating at chain restaurants who move to Chicago.

The ambiance is that of a classic French Bistro, the service is warm and friendly, and the food reminds me of something my mother would cook at home for me growing up. In other words, this is a restaurant that is unfussy and uncomplicated, wholesome, and fulfilling from the ambiance to the service to the food that it serves.  Having said that I would not particularly recommend this restaurant for a one-on-one date night spot as the seating seemed to be very open. I think the open-seating lends itself very well to group dinners, however, and Bistrot Margot would be an excellent place to take family or friends visiting from out of town that want a relaxed meal to begin the evening.",0.9651,0.812,0.172,0.016,0.46749999999999997

They served us with one salad each for the entire table of 11 and we ran out.   Instead of checking on the table-  I had to ask for more.  Then the hot entrees came out cold, which was the most dissapointing.  Cold steak frites, salmon and French fries-  it was disgusting. And again I had to keep asking for more food.  We are not big eaters- it was a group of 11 older women and there was not enough food for the table.   People's wine glasses were empty and I had to keep asking for our waitress.   She was too busy watching the Cubs game and talking to the other staff. I host many many parties and this was definitely the most dissapointing experiences I have had with a group dinner.   The only reason I am giving it any stars is because the actual food is usually very good when it is not sitting out cold for an extended period of time.",0.8268,0.888,0.075,0.037,0.554888888888889

2015-09-28,3.0,"Went here for my birthday last weekend with a group of 14. I had been there once before and loved the food and had great service, so I was excited to introduce this spot to my friends, many of whom had never been there. I had the filet, and it was a 4.75 for me. Everyone in the group said their food was also great. The chef(s) and kitchen staff are definitely on point.  But there was one glaring issue that made my birthday really awkward and stressful and, despite great food, brings my review down to a 3. For 14 people they accepted only 3 credit cards. Nobody told me this when I booked the reservation or confirmed it the week of. Two of my guests also inquired before ordering whether they could be on a separate check and the waiter gave them the impression that it would not be a problem. At the end of the meal, the waiter announced that only 3 cards for 14 people would be accepted. Several of my guests had to leave the restaurant and walk several blocks to an ATM as there wasn't one in the restaurant. It was so stressful and ridiculous and totally killed the good vibe. Seriously, in this day and age people don't always carry 40 to 60 bucks of cash on them to dinner because it is the expectation that credit cards are universally accepted when you go out to eat. If a restaurant has such a policy about splitting bills for larger groups, they need to let people know when they book or when they arrive. Certainly after 2 people inquired, they should have been informed of this policy.  The clincher is that after several of my guests were gone for 20 minutes to get cash, the waiter comes back with no apologies about his failure to inform me/us of this policy in advabce and states they will make a one time exception and accept as many cards as needed. He couldn't check with his manager on that BEFORE my guests were inconvenienced? They did bring out a complimentary birthday  dessert which was nice. Again, I will emphasize that the food was great. But I will not be back in light of this service and I doubt any of my guests will either. It seriously put a damper on my birthday.",0.9803,0.793,0.135,0.072,0.5275853775853775

I chose the escargot, the bouillabaisse and a berry cake with vanilla ice cream. None of them were particularly noteworthy, but they weren't bad. The bouillabaisse broth could have used more flavor and fresher shellfish, but otherwise everything was fine, just not great. Service was friendly, and the outside eating area is pleasant.

2015-05-06,1.0,"So my friend and I went to this dump to have dinner. We were the youngest couple in the restaurant, and I think that was why the waiter took FOREVER to serve us, because in my opinion, they probably thought that we were not going to spend lots of money and order alcohol. I don't drink alcohol, it is a risk factor for MANY diseases, including cancer. So we ordered appetizer, and it took the waiter FOREVER to come and take our main entree order.  Then he came back after 20 min and said ""sorry Ive forgotten about you guys, I'll be back.""  What really pissed me off was that we wanted to split a meal and the waiter told us that if we wanted the kitchen to split it for us, it would be $2.50 extra just to cut the F****N duck in 2 pieces....SERIOUSLY? I told the waiter that we will do it ourselves. That is such a RIDICULOUS RIP OFF.   WOW! But then again, we were having dinner in Chicago, which is a corrupt low class city.  So I waited even longer to order dessert and by the time he got to our table, I was so pissed off that I did not order dessert.  I will NEVER come back here again, they treated us subpar, like children, and that is NO WAY to treat customers.  I hate businesses who treat us poorly when we don't spend LOTS of money there.

2015-04-17,2.0,"My boss gave myself and my fellow employees a gift card to here like three years ago and we finally decided to use it today. Honestly I was in a mood for a burger and fries (last day of real food before purification) nothing fancy and I have to say honestly that the food satisfied my appetite. I had the skirt steak and fritters it was one of the few things I was able to eat as a gluten free as well as my son. And I am not much of a steak person except on rare occasion I have a hankering for it but the sauce on top of the steak was great as well as the tenderness. I am a fri fanatic and liked the fritters small and crunchy just my style. My boyfriend also enjoyed his dinner the fish with pasta and my son ate the steak like a champ. My only complaint was the service. We sat on the patio it was a beautiful day intermittently sunny (kinda wished there was some shade, but not the worst thing) and cloudy. The waitress took a few minutes to get to us, Michelle and took a while to get three waters. I had a sense we were a huge disappointment to her because we mostly stuck with water and my boyfriend had coke. I just had acupuncture today and was told not drink so water was my preferred hydration and my son doesn't need to bounce off the wall and my boyfriend was driving. I also asked about gluten free and I got the sense she wasn't thrilled about that. She just seemed above us and the service seemed huffy/stuffy. She was not very friendly and when i asked about the gluten free menu she pointed out the astrics but I got the feeling like she felt like I should have know that (even though it was my first time there) and yet again the same feeling when I asked what fritters were.  My boyfriend is a bartender/server/and works parties. I have worked 6 years in restaurants myself. We put out the credit card and gift card the tell tale sign we were ready to check out and we got a menu dropped on the table. For a moment we were enticed but we just really wanted to go home. Her section started to fill up and when she finally came around to ask if we wanted desert I told her know we were closing up and she seemed yet again disappointed and asked for my form of payment which I handed to her on the table and she realized was sitting out. It took her a bit to run the card and after the wait for her to return just so we could tell her we were ready to get out it took even longer. As my boyfriend sees it top priority returning the check and getting people out and flipping tables when she came by she had two peoples check in hand and assumed one was ours so when she went to talk to the table next to us he tried to grab her attention which honestly wasn't the best thing no matter how anxious he and I were to get out of there and through her teeth when she was finished with that table she told us she had to have a manager run the gift card. We understand that the same has gone for our places of work in the past and present but it took a long time. And when she dropped off the tab to be signed finally I really just wanted her to leave and not say anymore because we had kinda had it and she lingered for what seemed like a very bullshit thank you for lack of a better word. And the busser was kinda huffy and unfriendly too. Just a general vibe of unfriendliness and like we were the wrong kind of customer or something.

Escargots ($11) are a classic and these were well done, though I thought they weren't the most flavorful. Maybe more garlic in the butter would have helped. Mussels ($13) were delicious and perfectly done. The white wine beurre blanc was light but extremely flavorful and every mussel got a nice hit of flavor. These compare very favorably to some excellent moules I've had in Brussels. I didn't get to try the poisson amandine ($22), my friend seemed to enjoy the dish a lot and the fish looked flaky and perfectly cooked. Filet mignon ($28), while good, was not all that interesting and the roasted potatoes had almost no flavor. The entire thing needed a bit more salt. Dorado ($23) was excellent, the fish was perfectly cooked and although I don't remember what the sauce was, it was addictive. My lamb chops ($30) were OK, but slightly overcooked past the medium I'd requested and slightly tough. The mustard crust and side of ratatouille were great, the bland mashed potatoes not so much.

I've eaten here for lunch, brunch, dinner, Valentine's Day and most recently during Restaurant Week when I was starving for lunch.  I tried two items from the menu that I've not tried before and it was well worth the $22 special prie fixe pricing. I ordered: 1. Soup Aux Oignons (onion soup) 2. Moules Frites (mussels and fries) 3. Tarte Aux Pommes (Apple tart) - I've actually eaten this a million times here and I'm excited to eat it again.  The onion soup is sweet and filling with a thick layer of Gruyere well crusted over on top. The crouton was well toasted, which I appreciated because I hate soggy bread. There was a perfect balance between salty and sweet and multiple textures that were interesting in a fun way.  The mussels were plentiful and the broth was so delicious, it was full of garlic and lemon flavors. Delicious, delicious, delicious! I wish I could give 5 stars but my only complaint on this day as well as in the past is that there is inconsistencies in their salad making. The dressings have been tart with too much vinegar the past few times I've dined. My fiancé had the salad with bacon and the dressing was horrid. I have been obsessed with the endive salad in the past but I no longer order it because the dressing has been terrible and/or there is a lack of balanced flavors between the cheese, apples and candied nuts that it comes with.

I originally walked over to Pinot Gigio but the line was so crazy and I was so hungry I couldn't wait 90 minutes for a bowl of pasta... So I headed to Bistrot Margot across the street. I started off with the mussels because 1) who goes to a french restaurant and doesn't eat mussels? and 2) the pictures everyone else took looked fabulous. Now, I'm always apprehensive about eating seafood in this city because I always break out in hives from the lack of freshness - but I took a chance and...whew, I was safe! and boy, were the mussels yummy! I ordered some sort of fish, which was awesome, and my dining partner ordered the steak frites which were surprisingly delicious! I'd be as bold to say that they beat mon ami gabi's!

We started with a couple of cocktails, they have a nice list of house specialties, all of which sounded wonderful.  The Mule, in its chilly copper cup, was a very refreshing aperitif. For starters we shared the moules marinières and the pâté maison, both of which were close to sublime.  The one small drawback was the quite small portion of bread offered; there was too little for the pâtés, and some had to be eaten with a fork.  However, something that heavenly should just be eaten, by any means necessary! I had the roasted duck, which was perfectly cooked.  Just amazing.  My friend was very happy with the tilapia, which wasn't dry at all, as someone else here experienced. Splurged on dessert, which I don't normally do, by trying the mixed berry clafoutis.  It was quite wonderful, like a bread pudding in consistency, warm and delicious. I heartily recommend Bistrot Margot for a special evening out.  The rich red walls and glowing, dark wood trim contributed greatly to an authentic French bistrot experience, but the food will make you really glad you chose it.",0.9889,0.789,0.211,0.0,0.6989795918367347

2014-10-18,1.0,"I took my Mom for the day out, and this was our first stop of the day. We live in the suburbs and made the special trip out to try this place and visit the city. To be quite honest, we were not very impressed. We were asked once if we would like something to drink, and we ordered mimosas. They were great, but we were never asked again if we would like another. We had to ask for coffee, it was not offered. We also had to ask for water, which is something I've received without asking at every restaurant I've ever been to. Mind you, there was only one other table of folks in the restaurant at the time. We were given a plate of french bread and butter, which is a nice offering, but the bread was cold, and the butter was frozen. Now, I shouldn't really say anything bad here because it was free, but the bread was full of holes and it was hard to spread the butter because it was completely frozen. We still ate it though, because we love bread and butter. Would have been nice to have warm bread and spreadable butter...just my opinion.  My Mom ordered an omelet that was quite dry, and there was truly nothing special about it. Nothing more than a simple omelet that even my 11 year old niece can make. My mom also ordered a side of toast which came dry, and had to ask for butter and jam, as it was not on the table, or offered to her.  I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. Now, for a restaurant that offers several types of egg Benedict, I would expect that my poached eggs would have run all over my English muffin and smoked salmon, but they did not. One was completely cooked (like a boiled egg), and the other had a very gummy yolk. They weren't even warm. I told the waiter not to worry about replacing them, just to please let the cook know, and that I would be fine eating the ones on my plate, despite the doneness. He came out with extra poached eggs anyhow, which was a waste, because I cannot eat 4 eggs. I did not read any reviews prior to coming to the restaurant, because I wanted to form my own opinion of the place. We will not be returning. What really got me was that egg!! I've gone to Denny's and never had a hard poached egg. I expected more from a French bistro. About a day or so later, I received a message from the restaurant asking how they did. I told them exactly this, and never heard back from them again.

The black bean soup was alright, the steak frites were not as good as I had remembered, partially due to the fact that mine was cooked way past the medium rare I had requested. As a matter of fact, multiple people in our party ordered the steak frites cooked to various degrees and all of our orders were switched up, so some of us got overcooked pieces and others got undercooked pieces and we ended up switching halfway amongst ourselves. The roasted chicken was also very overcooked. However, we aren't ones to send food back to the kitchen because we feel guilty that it'd all go to waste, so being the passive aggressive people we are, we just grumble through the dinner quietly. Our  waiter definitely detected this and ended up giving us each of us of age an awesome glass of dessert wine (ruby port) with our desserts to apologize for the slip-up. What spectacular service!

The menu is full of delectable items to choose from. He did remark that items like Beef Wellington (one of the specials, which they were out of) would not be found on a traditional French menu - nor would be the RISOTTO DU JOUR which I had. The dish was awesome and probably the best of its type I've ever had. The delicate balance of flavors with goat cheese was simply divine. However, I wanted to eat a French meal and just got carried away at the ingredients in the risotto. The portion was so large that I would never have been able to have an entree with it. My daughter had the ENDIVES ET NOIX with Belgian Endive, Spicy Candied Walnuts, Bleu Cheese, Apples, Red Wine Vinaigrette. We all tasted each other's dishes and this one was also excellent. She followed with TILAPIA AUX NOIX with Asparagus, Beets, Carrots, Walnuts, Balsamic-Brown Butter Sauce. This portion was also so large it could feed two. Antoine had SALADE DE POIRE with Field Greens, Grilled Pears, Pistachios, Bleu Cheese, Dried Cranberries, Red Beet Vinaigrette which was off the chain. One of the best salads I have ever eaten. He followed with FILLET DE FLET POELE  - fried  Flounder over Orzo Pasta with Spinach, Scallions, and Tomato, finished with Chive Compound Butter. Fantastic dish and a huge portion. However, he said it would not be served over a pasta as it was here. Nonetheless, it was delicious. Antoine said the portions served here were about twice the size of what you would find in Paris.

We had a nice bottle of champagne, which I had never tried before.   Mixed drinks are also somewhat limited but tasted pretty good.   The restaurant is very loud and crowded.  The service was pretty bad, as our waitress only came to serve our drinks and meals - didn't stop at our table after the meal was served until she asked about dessert.   They need to hire more help or train their servers better.

If having an appetizer, I always order the mussels. They are just amazing and highly recommended. For the main course, I ordered flank steak, medium (pink, no blood). And yet again, the chef decided to under cook the steak. Not just mine but my friend's, which was ordered medium-rare and came out rare. I sent mine back but asked for a new steak, as recooking a steak ruins the taste. The second one came out undercooked (medium-rare) and was sent back again, this time it came back medium to medium-well, which was as close to my request as I was likely to get; yes, I know it wasn't a new steak the third time but the lesson was learned. Fries were tasty. Chef or cooks at BM are no different than those at L2O or many other restaurants, they blissfully ignore both what is ordered and the fact that I am paying for what I want to eat, not what they want to serve, and if they don't want to cook food to certain temperatures, say so, those of us who want different will dine elsewhere.

The french onion soup was as good as I remembered.   My entree had a healthy portion of veal (2 cutlets), but after 2 bites of the first cutlet, I sliced open the second and noticed it was undercooked.  My fatal flaw was sending the entire plate back instead of just the raw meat.  What came back was one (new) cutlet one a new plate with new sides.  So I lost half of my dinner?!  The waiter was nowhere to be found so I sucked it up.

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was how the hostess originally sat us beneath the stairs, which felt like a very undesirable location. The decor is lovely  with red paint and mirrors lining the wall, so it felt a bit like we wouldn't get to experience all that Bistrot Margot had to offer by being seated there. It was especially odd because the dining room was far from full, considering how early we were there (our reservation was at 6:00 to be sure to make the show) and that it was a week night. Nevertheless, I requested to be moved and from then on, the meal was great. We started with the escargot and a special appetizer of grilled shrimp and sausage. Both were lovely. For our entrees, I had the duck over risotto with asparagus, and my boyfriend had escalope de veal with gnocchi and asparagus. The risotto was a bit of a surprise for me. It wascrunchy and almost seemed like it'd been formed into a patty and then pan fried. This wasn't a bad thing (in fact, I liked it a lot) but not at all what I was expecting for risotto. The duck and veal were both excellent. For dessert, we split the profiteroles, which felt like a bargain at $5.95. There were three of them, and they were smothered in chocolate sauce. For two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert, two glasses of wine (me), and one soda (my boyfriend doesn't drink), the price tag was around $125, including tax and gratuity.

2013-01-27,3.0,"Solid Three Stars. Bistrot Margot was everything that you would expect for a French restaurant in the city. The atmosphere was quaint and charming, fitting in nicely with the upscale vibe of Old Town. I came with a large party (10 females) on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was incredibly accommodating to our group, which is a major plus in my book. Bistrot Margot offers a wide range of French food that appeals to a wide range of tastes and preferences. Luckily for our group, we decided to come on a Wednesday night where they offer any appetizer, any entree, and any dessert from the menu for the low price of $26. This is a huge deal as many of their entrees are in the mid $20 range, so you come out ahead by partaking in this deal in terms of value and food (seriously, I had two full dinners worth of food from their portion sizes). After hemming and hawing over the menu, I decided to stray a bit from the classic French fare of escargot and steak frites by choosing the following: 1) Risotto Special: Onions, peppers, and mushrooms as a base topped with a balsamic reduction and hearty globs of goat cheese. This dish was rich and flavorful, making it a great way to start of the meal. I had to force myself to stop as I could have easily made myself full from this large appetizer for one. 2) Scalope De Veau: Thin-Pounded Parmesan-Crusted Veal, Pate a Choux Gnocchi, Grilled Asparagus, Capered Citrus Butter, Cherry Tomatoes. I can't decide how I feel about this dish--there were parts I loved and parts I could have done without. The veal was a bit overcooked and lacked any flavor on its own, with parts a bit chewy and almost gristly. Luckily, the veal was saved by the parmesan crust and the citrus butter, which kicked up the dish in terms of flavor. The gnocchi had a weird texture and tasted solely of flour and water. The grilled asparagus was overcooked and shriveled up, which was incredibly disappointing. Had I not filled up a bit on the risotto I would have been incredibly disappointed with this choice. 3) Apple Tart: This tart was oddly reminiscent of a croissant, which was a nice surprise. The dough had a nice crisp to it and was filled with five to six large apple slices that were seasoned with plenty of cinnamon. The vanilla ice cream and caramel were a perfect balance to the tartness of the apples, and the warm-cold contrast is always enjoyable. There were definite pros and cons to the meal, but I enjoyed my experience here. As I said before, the service was great for our large group and we never felt like we were being rushed or ""putting out"" the restaurant for dealing with our group. Although the menu states otherwise, our waiter offered to break up the check for each of us individually which was greatly received by all of us.  I probably won't be back anytime in the near future considering all of the other restaurant options in the city, but I'd recommend checking out their daily specials (ie the prefixe or the Wednesday special) so that you can get a wider sampling of the menu as many items appear to be hit or miss.",0.9872,0.88,0.096,0.023,0.5334523809523809

Staff was very accomodating and made sure we had eeverything we asked for. They were also very attentive at our tables and did what they do very well. The Bistro Salad was very good but a bit surprised at how big the bacon chunks were. It was a little uncomfortable trying to chew two pieces of it while trying to make conversation. But overall people were happy with it. I ordered the roasted chicken which was quite tender. The sauce was a bit overly salty and i truly didn't think that fries/frites matched well with this dish. I would have much rather have some sort of vegetable or even roasted potatoes or something to go with it. But Ah well. I heard the white fish entre which came with green beans (I think) was very good.  My only little complaint is that we had 3 left over meals and so we asked to take them as takeouts. i received 2 of them and asked that the 3rd one be given to the lady that was paying the bill. She never got it. I just hope that someone from our group at least was given the order but i guess I'll never find out. One of my two takeout box lids was not secured completely, so when my car swerved, the lid popped off and much of the marinara sauce sloshed all over the thin bag which then tore open when I tried to carry it out. I suppose it's not really the restaurants fault that this happened, but if that lid had been secured there was a lower chance of this happenning. Recommend overall. Edit: Forgot to comment on the profiteroles dessert. the pastry portion was a bit on the hard side. Cutting into one and trying to have it not slide off the plate while having a conversation was a bit tough. We all concluded afterwards that they must of had these made beforehand with the icecream scooped in and then stuck the entire thing into the freezer until they were served.

For starters, we shared the Tarte au Brie and Escargot.  The Brie was amazing; it was cooked in puff pastry and topped with balsamic, toasted walnuts, and asparagus.  It was a unique combination of flavors and not too heavy - the highlight of my meal.  The Escargot was nice too.   For entrees, I had the Steak Frites and he had the Fillet.  Both were cooked exactly how we ordered them.  The French Fries with the Steak Frites were cooked just the way that I like them - thin and crispy.   For dessert, I had the Chocolate Mousse and he had a peach dish.  I love peaches but wasn't a big fan of his dessert.  The Chocolate Mousse was fine, but nothing overly special. Service is good.  The wine list is varied with plenty of affordable options.  This is probably my favorite French restaurant in the City, though I'm generally not a huge fan of French food.",0.9671,0.812,0.154,0.034,0.5510281385281385

Perhaps they don't handle holidays well-- they certainly had a full house, but our experience was so bad we'll definitely never go back here again. Although we had a reservation, we had to wait quite a while before being seated, and although there's a bar, we were not encouraged to wait there, so we clustered at the hostess stand with everyone else waiting for a table. We had brought a bottle of white wine which the waiter had said he would bring us a cooler for, but he never did. The food was a huge disappointed-- it mostly tasted like ""prepared"" food: like a slightly dressed up version of the frozen food that cafeterias heat up and serve. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a tub, the cranberry sauce was clearly canned with a little orange zest thrown in on top, the rolls came from a grocery store bakery, and my dessert tasted like something I could have ordered at Applebee's. The one saving grace is that our waiter was pretty friendly, and kept refilling my wine glass.

Food: We shared a pear salad and a scallop appetizer.  The scallops, in a creamy sauce were good but too fishy for landlubbers.  The salad was very good, albeit not balanced in quantity of content.  (heavy on craisins and blue cheese)  I had pork tenderloin (one of the few options for those who don't do seafood); my husband had veal schnitzel.  His was tasty but chewy in spots.  The pork was nowhere near as good as I make at home - and all I do is try various online recipes.  For tenderloin, it was significantly overcooked; seasoning was not great.  Accompanying pasta was too salty to eat.  Asparagus was good, though.  I ate 3 bites of pork & left it appearing completely intact.  We declined to take a box -- wouldn't the waiter ASK about the food quality at that point?  Nope.  He had asked while flying past earlier & he didn't care then any more than when removing the full plates.  We declined dessert expecting nothing to be any better quality on that menu.  We still had an hour & a half to kill and did our best to stretch out a double espresso and single (never offered a refill) coffee.

2012-09-20,2.0,"Bistrot Margot has been my go-to French place in Chicago for quite awhile.  I love the half-price wine Mondays and the prix fixe options.  Unfortunately, during our most recent visit, the experience was a letdown.  We had a reservation and were seated right away at an indoor table by the window, which was great.  It was a quiet night - there were maybe four tables inside and the outside patio was about half full.  The escargots were good, as usual.  Our server was friendly enough, but he disappeared at really inopportune times for long periods of time.  Like when our entrees were served by kitchen staff.  All of us were drinking white wine, but most of us wanted to switch to red for our entrees.  It was probably 10 minutes after our entrees were delivered that our waiter finally reappeared so that we could order red.  The steak frites, which is usually very good, was not so great this time.  The steak was very bland, even with the sauce.  And the frites, which are usually fabulous, were barely warm and dried up, visibly so ... as if they'd been sitting there in the kitchen for an hour or more.  They should have been tossed instead of served to a customer.  I'm not one to send back dishes to the kitchen, but I probably would have this time with the frites - had I been able to catch a glimpse of our server.  I'm not sure where he had wandered off to, but we had been finished with our meals for quite awhile when he resurfaced, chatting with the bartender and not even glancing into the dining room in which we were seated.  We had to flag him down to get his attention.  All in all, it was a disappointing meal and a very different experience than what we usually get at Bistrot Margot.  Maybe it was just an off night, but we walked out of there thinking that both the service and the food had really dropped in terms of quality.",0.9572,0.889,0.08,0.03,0.476986271986272

We split a bottle of pinot noir for $34 - they have a few bottles in the low $30s - but I didn't think it was a super great wine.  Our waiter refilled our glasses for us throughout the meal.  He brought us some baguette slices and butter, before our appetizers came.  We shared the french onion soup and salade de poir, a pear salad with pistachios, cranberries, blue cheese, and beet vinaigrette.  The salad was tasty and fresh, and would be great for sharing as it was fairly sizeable.  I expected great things from the onion soup based on other reviews, but frankly wasn't hugely impressed.  The broth did not taste homemade (not saying it wasn't, but it didn't taste it), and didn't have much depth of flavor.  It was salty as well - if you're eating french onion soup with all that cheese you want it to be worth the fat and calories and this was not.  Made me wish I'd ordered a different appetizer! For my entree, I got the filet mignon - and why not, since I could pick any entree for the same price!  It came with Yukon gold potatoes, grilled asparagus, and bordelaise sauce.  It was a pleasant dish - steak was pretty well cooked, potatoes a bit crispy on the outside, asparagus providing a fresh component....but the overall impact was still a bit underwhelming.  It wasn't inspired, and I wanted more richness, deeper flavors.  It was a fine dish, but I've had far far finer steaks elsewhere.  The potatoes and asparagus were very simple, which isn't necessarily bad, but the plate was very simple overall.  I think they could've done more with the dish to make it more exciting.  I tasted my friends tilapia which I also found ""okay,"" though the vegetables underneath were very good. My dessert was creme brulee, and they did a nice, if again simple and uninspired job.  Really, start to finish, from wine to food to service, everything was fine or good, but none of the components were a step above average.  I've had French food in this city that makes me close my eyes and sigh, French food I don't even want to swallow because then the moment is over.  This wasn't it.  I'd seek French elsewhere in the city.  Many of the French restaurants I've loved have closed (for WHY!?!) but I'd return to Mon Ami Gabi or Bistro Campagne before returning here.",0.9984,0.774,0.205,0.021,0.4551756440281032

Also was trying to check out the place to see if it would be a good place to recommend to costumers at work.  Impressively bad food: Bread was cold and stale. Escargot was drowning in a flavorless greasy pesto which I had to add lots of salt and paper to (how do you take the flavor out of pesto?). Truffle oil and asparagus risotto was a combination of what looked like jasmine rice stuck in some sort of over cheesed thick gloppy sauce which had a fermented taste like bad cheese (It takes talent to make truffle oil taste bad). Bistro salad must have been sitting in dressing for awhile because most of the greens were wilted, the bacon lardons were burnt and rock hard, and the balsamic dressing was some creamy white liquid I could not identify. My boyfriend had steak and frites. Fries were definitely from frozen (McDonald's tastes better). Steak tasted slightly rank, as if it was frozen and defrosted. Despite that the steak itself was cooked well (at least its not the chefs fault, one can only execute so well if the ingredients are bad),  Dramatically understaffed: Service was so slow I could have gone down the street to La Fournette and gotten better French food and make it back before the server ever took our order. Took 20 mins before she took our order. She stopped by twice in that time just to say she'll be right back, but left so fast I couldn't even put in an appetizer. Took just as long to get her to pick up the bill so we can pay. Though this is not completely her fault since she was the only waitress on our half of the restaurant and the outdoor patio (looked like 20 tables or so).  The whole experience was so frustrating, I drove all the way to Lincoln Square to eat better food at the Tiny Lounge, just to get the taste of rotten lettuce out of my mouth.

However, you have to know what to order, as I feel that some dishes are not as excellent as others.  My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here, so we have a soft-spot for it, but it always delivers and we still go there about once a quarter. Make a reservation, it is a small space and I've never had to wait when I make a reservation. The best menu items from my experience are: the veal special (the gnocchi served with this is unlike any I've had and it is delicious), the whitefish almondine, the mussels as an appetizer, the Bistrot Salad and the caramel apple tarte as dessert.   Their service is superb. On a recent visit, I deviated from my usual whitefish entree and had the duck. I regretted my decision, but didn't want to mention it. The waitress asked me how I liked it and I was honest that I preferred the whitefish and she insisted on giving me that instead. I protested, but in less than 5 minutes she had the whitefish at our table. The manager came over to make sure I was happy and they made sure the bill did not include the duck. This from me not even complaining, just making a statement that I preferred my usual!  I was blown away by that and it is things like this that keep us coming back. As I mentioned, we had our rehearsal dinner here, so if you are looking for an event space, take a look at their upstairs room. It is beautiful, charming, has stained glass windows that open up to the outside, and a big mahogany bar. In my opinion, the upstairs room is much lovelier than the downstairs dining room (no photos of half-naked kids if you know what I mean!) They serve the same food as the restaurant, family-style.

I would recommend going on Wednesdays for the Prix Fixe of any app, entree and dessert for $26.95...in my opinion, that is a steal, esp since some entree dishes start at $26.95!!! All in all, great intro to french food. Recommended for the seafood and veal. Kinda pricey,  but you can't beat an outdoor patio (which you cannot reserve, so get there early!).",0.9923,0.751,0.222,0.027,0.6157407407407408

2012-05-30,1.0,"I have been here for brunch and dinner a few times and have enjoyed it. After last night, I will not be returning. Our server was not friendly.  Having been in the industry, I am not a high maintenance diner who needs constant attention.  However, this server was negligent and had an unpleasant attitude. We started with cocktails and the pate.  The bread plates were dirty and it took several minutes to flag someone down to bring fresh plates. I ordered the Entrecote Au Poivre (Medium Rare) and my boyfriend ordered the Beef Wellington (Medium Rare) with two glasses of red. The entrees came to the table.  My boyfriend cut into his meat and it was almost blue because it was so raw.  I cut into my steak and it was well done.  Our server was nowhere to be found for at least five minutes.  We flagged down another server, who wasn't happy because we were taking him away from his table, to take our plates away. Our server came and said, ""Oh, they were wrong?"" and left.  We waited ten minutes.  The food runner brought our plates back and asked us to check to see if our dishes were cooked properly. This should have been done by a manager. The Beef Wellington was a messy pile of scorched steak and soggy pastry. Clearly, they had taken the original plate and threw it in the oven without even trying to put it back together.  It looked ridiculous and never should have left the kitchen.  My steak was now raw.  Our server came back and we asked to speak to a manager.  She was very nice when we explained the situation.  We had been sitting there for a while and were not in the mood to wait for a third time for entrees.  I packed up my raw steak to cook at home.  She brought our check, which had our cocktails and wine I hadn't touched, on it.  Having worked in the industry, I think that the number of mistakes made during our experience constituted the entire meal being taken care of.  The manager should've been involved as soon as there was an issue. However, we agreed to pay for the cocktails only. I have no desire to return to the possibility of a rude server and sloppy food.  It is unfortunate because I've had good food and service in the past, but last night was very uncomfortable.",-0.7435,0.887,0.047,0.065,0.4585771173271174

First of all, you must go on a Wednesday night..everything on their menu (not just three options) are offered at a prix frie of 26.95 which is a steal..in terms of starters, the  seafood puff, mussels and the french onion soup were all raved about. I personally got the endive salad which I kind of regretted as it came in a big heap with no presentation and didn't look all that appetizing.  Main course I definitely perked up; I got the flounder filet which was very soft and delicious; I loved every bite of it. I also tried some of my friend's pork shoulder and the lamb was also complimented by all who had tried it. Also note that their portions, unlike other bistros, are very generous so that was another plus of Margot. Desserts was another great affair. I got the chocolate chip bread pudding which was great but not as good as the raspberry/chocolate terraine that my friend got. That was delicious and I highly recommend that as well as the ice cream filled eclairs which just looked precious and oh-so-delicious.

Being fairly close to second city (and having some of the highest reviews in the area) we decided to check out Bistrot Margot. Coming in for an 8:30 dinner reservation, the place was packed, which I took as a pretty good sign. We were seated promptly, given a minute to peruse the menu, and ordered away. I ended up going with the tilapia with vegetables, my guy went with the duck, and we split the house risotto for an appetizer. Overall, we were both very satisfied with the quality/quantity of food. If I had planned better, I would of saved room for dessert or one of their specialty cocktails. Oh well, there is always next time... I think the only negative thing I could say about the experience was the seating arrangement. We had a small table for two (not surprising for a date), but we were jam-packed behind a group of 6 (or 8) women. I mean, it was TIGHT. Luckily this seating didn't keep the waiters away; they were very attentive all night. However, it wasn't what I would call comfortable or conducive to a very romantic experience.

2012-02-16,5.0,"Visited the day after Valentines Day, which I assume would be a ""down"" day in the restaurant business. My wife and I had visited the Auto Show and were looking for a comfortable, but memorable place to have dinner. I recalled that this restaurant was near Second City and had generally good ratings on the internet. We were not disappointed. I loved the decor and atmosphere which was truly French chic/shabby bistrot. Service was good, friendly and helpful. Waiter recommended a good and relatively inexpensive wine for my wife and a craft brewed porter beer for myself, both of which we truly enjoyed. The waiter also immediately brought to our table a plate of sliced French baguette and butter . First course, my wife had a bowl of (what else) French onion soup which was, frankly, better than my own, even though I follow a classic French recipe. The sweetness of the caramelized onions and cheese  truly set it off. In my opinion it could not have been better. I had the Bistrot salad which was also excellent, lightly dressed, with dark green and very fresh lettuces and spinach, a lightly boiled and creamy egg and chunks of ""bacon"" which were either broiled slab bacon or some other smoked pork. Excellent. As a second course, I had the ""white fish"" , recommended by the waiter and my wife had the rack of lamb. Again, in my opinion, they could not have been better. The lamb was perfectly cooked, medium rare, with an assortment of complimentary vegetables and a light flavorable sauce. The white fish was much better than I anticipated, light, moist, flaky and again enhanced by a light sauce, small red potatoes and green beans (cooked al dente) and capers. The portions were large and filling but not (fortunately) overwhelming and did not leave room for dessert. My wife said the soup was her dessert and took a portion of the lamb home. Initially I gave this place 4 stars, but in retrospect our experience was 5 stars. I have no complaints. I also walked through the other rooms before leaving and noted that the servers distribute the customers throughout the restaurant at comfortable spaces to allow for private conversation and a more romantic atmosphere rather than packing them together. Obviously, this is a serious restaurateur who has high standards and experience. As for price, we left with a bill, including tip of approximately$75  which I consider low for Chicago, particularly for the quality of the food, service and atmosphere, and I must admit, I am regarded as ""cheap.""

I, however, was really disappointed. I think the best way to describe Bistrot Margot is that is is FRENCH FOOD FOR AMATEURS--I'll elaborate in my review of the food. Let's start with the service. Service was really slow. We were greeted by our server about 15 minutes after being seated. The place wasn't that busy but there were other tables. It took a long time for everything to come out. We waited about 10 mins for drinks. Our escargots came out about 5 minutes after that, which wasn't bad, but then we waited for a good 20 minutes before our entrees came out. We also had to wait a really long time for our check because our server was too busy chit chatting with a table he wasn't even serving--it was rather annoying. The Food. MEH! I'm not sure where the chef is from in France but it must be a place where salt is hard to find. I found that everything that we had was rather BLAND, actually, really bland. I rarely ever salt food at the table but nothing had taste. The Escargot wasn't anything to write home to mom about. In fact, I could have made it better at home. The butter on the snails was tasteless and had a hint of garlic. We were also sheisted one escargot. We got a puny excuse for a snail in the hole where a snail was suppose to be present. We were going to bring it up to the server except he was nowhere to be found for most of our dinner. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites which was tasteless as well. I tried the Grouper and it was bland. I think it could have used a little more searing as well. My poor fish was lacking some color and looked sick.  I won't be returning here for French Food. I much prefer Le Buchon and Mon Ami Gabbi for reasonably priced French Food.

This place is pretty big and nice inside so I think we could have been seated...I don't know...anywhere else. To be fair, the hostess or manager (I'm not sure which) came to our table to apologize for the salad and gave us a dessert for free. I just think it would have been nice if our actual waiter had come to our table once during the main course to follow up and see how things were going after the salad course but he never did come to ask how anything was. Honestly, we were not looking forward to eating anything after seeing that salad and couldn't wait to leave. The chicken I had was ok and the chocolate dessert was pretty good. I see from other reviews people like this place and maybe our experience here was totally out of the norm. I just can't see returning.",0.9882,0.777,0.163,0.061,0.5894115369725126

We had the mussles, escargot, steak frites, and the scallops. All outstanding. My complaints were that there were too many children and that they weren't isolated to one section of the restaurant. Crying children, preteens, and I get that they're humans, but I'm on a date and I don't want to hear or see them. My other complaint is that they seemed short staffed. Our waitress did do her absolute best to stop by and give us good service but it was very clear she had too many tables. She forgot to ring in my creamed spinach, and didn't check back soon enough for me to say anything. It wasn't a huge deal because as it turns out we ordered way too much food, but it still irked me a little. I will go there again. If you decide to check it out, I'd say this place isn't for the diner who likes fine dining type waitservice. Its a bistro.

2011-05-02,2.0,"I hate giving this reviews, but after thy recent experience at Bistro Margot I feel I should. This past weekend we celebrated my wife's birthday at Bistro Margot. We were a party of 12, I called a week in advanced to make the reservations, had talked to them a couple of time before to change the amount of people for the reservations. My final conversation was with them on the Friday before to confirm the reservation.  I want to start out by saying that everyone in the group loved their food. The issue was not the food, but the policies and personnel. My wife and I arrived about ten minutes early to so we could meet our guest as they came in. The hosted who was not the friendliest showed us our table, but asked us to wait in the bar for the rest of our party. When about half the party was there she stated that we could be seated. We noticed that the table would be crapped for 12 people. Having been there before and with a large group I know they have larger tables. We noticed a couple of smaller tables next to our so I approached the hostess about the crapped table and asked if we could get another table added. She was short and rude with her response, we did not get the additional table.  Everyone in our party showed, we had a wonderful meal. A couple of our friends had to leave to catch a show. They left cash, we still had 4 of the remaining 10 who needed to pay with credit cards. We were told that they will not cash out more than 3 cards per table. It would have been nice through our many conversations or the first conversation when I made the reservation to have been given this information. We had to shuffle a few things around,but the bill got paid.  This brings us to another customer service issue. My wife spoke to one of our guest the next day, she stated that she had been double charged for her meal. She actually was charged for her portion and the remaining balance of the check. $340.00. She spoke with a person ( assistant manager) at Bistro Margot the next day, he stated that they were aware of the problem that night, but it would take a couple of days to fix. Our friend asked if they would be willing to pay any over drafts she may incur because of their mistake. He stated he would have to speak to the manager or general manager, but they were not available.  Now for myself I will give anyplace a shot twice if the service is good, but I cant stand poor and rude customer service especially if your paying alot of money.  Sorry Bistro Margot you have lost several customers because of poor and inadequate customer service. We may try again at some other time but I will not be recommending anyone to dine there anytime soon.",0.9828,0.819,0.112,0.069,0.45009157509157516

2011-04-24,5.0,"Three months ago I could not remember why I harbored negative feelings about Bistro Margot.  Did I have a bad experience there?  Was the food bad?  Did a waiter abuse me?  Not recalling, I returned to Bistrot Margot and remembered what my issue was...the food is so absolutely delicious that it can become an addictive, fattening and wallet draining habit. Today I returned to Bistrot Margot for the third time in three months, having already fallen under the spell of their escargot. Problem with the escargot at Margot is after eating them I realize that most other escargot are over or under cooked, the garlic butter sauce is lacking depth and I find myself sad and disappointed until I can once again return to that grand palace called Bistrot Margot for GREAT escargot.  And when all the snails are gone, I find myself going through too much bread to sop up that garlicky, buttery goodness and wondering how I will find space to eat anything else. But I find room, because Margot has taught me the wonder of risotto.  Yeah I've had it before and no I've never cared about it much or understood the whole risotto-is-so-wonderful thing.  But last month I savored a duck, raisin and nut risotto and today I enjoyed a lamb, lamb jus and asparagus risotto.  Pure heaven! I had never ordered the French onion soup, after all it's just soup right?  Wrong!  Got to taste a spoonful of heaven today and next time I will definitely order it.  Chock full of sweet onions, savory broth, thick bread and layers and layers of cheese!   Next I moved on to my true love, the entrecote au poivre.  This thick NY Strip is perfectly cooked, bathed in a rich brandy cream sauce and served with thin, crispy, lightly salted French fries.  Are French fries supposed to be this good?  It's just a potato!  What, WHAT do they do to these potatoes? I also got a bite of the whitefish with spinach and potatoes served with a lemon caper amandine sauce.  OMG!  Enough said. As if we hadn't eaten enough, we were defenseless against the call of the bread pudding.  Although already served with crème anglaise, I also requested the caramel sauce on the side.  This was no mistake!  Rich, savory, sweet, wonderful! And let me not forget to mention the glory of the French Martini.  I like French Martinis.  I've had a lot of them at several different restaurants and there is something that Bistrot Margot's bartenders know about making this fruity concoction that others don't.  I wish I knew what it was. After a wonderful dinner, I made a promise to myself to wait at least two months before returning to Bistro Margot.  Or maybe at least one.",0.9891,0.764,0.152,0.085,0.5182142857142857

Once we were seated, we got some appetizers to nibble on as we waited for a friend to arrive. To start, we had chicken liver mousse pate and country pate as well as fried calamari. The chicken liver mousse didn't thrill me. Too silky without that rich, hearty liver flavor I enjoy out of pate. However, the country style was thick and rich. Much better of the two selections. The calamari satisfied as well. It was lightly battered which let the calamari show through. After our friend arrived, we ordered. I got the Duo de Canard while my husband got the veal tenderloin. My duo de canard had pieces of white meat with a dark meat breast with lentils. The white meat pieces were flavorful, but not quite the duck meat I like. Once I cut into the breast, my duck ambitions were recognized. The meat was flavorful, a little salty, and delicious. My husband loved his veal tenderloin so much so I barely got a taste of it.

2011-02-17,4.0,"This Old Town staple continues to deliver good food by friendly people in a lively bistro environment. Bistrot Margot is a good spot to grab lunch or dinner and in the Summer months- sitting outside on the sidewalk could have you almost thinking you were in the countryside of France.  The place was hopping on a recent weeknight. Reservations are a must as there wasn't a table open in the place. We were seated along the wall in a cozy table for two (read into that that we were practically on top of the people next to us and people were bumping into my chair all night as they tried to pass in the small aisle way- my real only complaint of the night)  They carry my favorite beer, Kronenbourg 1664 and even have the right glass to serve it in. So now that my mind was firmly reminded of when I first had that beer (Paris, Summer of 2006) we got down to ordering after checking out the tables around us to see what looked good.  To start we had the french onion soup. While I expected the cheese melted on the top and the gooey nature of it- what I didn't expect to find was the thick soup base underneath the cheese that almost had a tang of tomato to it. Know before you go- that if you order this soup- you will have no room for anything else- so I ate half as did my friend but we could have split one.  For entrees- I went with the chicken cordon bleu special of the day- delicious. Crispy on the outside with goats cheese and prosciutto on the inside, served with haricort verts and a rice mixture. My friend had the risotto of the day which was supposed to be an appetizer but came with 4 lamb chops and a huge bowl of rice. Both were so much food that we have a another meal waiting for us in leftovers!  For desert- the classic creme brulee down perfectly as we had asked- extra carmelization on top-hard to punch through but once you do- delicious as well.  Dinner for two ran about $120. There is valet parking out front (use it if you drive as street parking is not easy in Old Town) or you can park in the small lot located closer to North Ave.  Another beer in hand, we watched the place slowly empty as the night wore on. But there we sat, with the memory of a good meal and a little Edith Piaf, ""La Vie en Rose"" playing softly in the background. Bon Nuit.",0.9928,0.861,0.12,0.018,0.4957760141093474
2011-02-15,3.0,"Bistrot Margot has a bustling Parisian elegance that can help you wind down the week with a bang.  The restaurant is crowded and the crowd is loud, as are the walls, but not unpleasantly so.  The decor is straight up bistro - deep red walls, floors tiled in small octagons, wood chair rail paneling, banquette seating.  The bar area is small and crowded with highboys forming a boundary, along with red velvet curtains, between the bar and the dining area.  Its a bit dark but promises high energy. Cocktails here are excellent, and I'm pleased to inform my fellow bourbon boozers that they have High West Rye, which makes a superb, and I do mean superb, Manhattan.  Walk in my shoes for an evening - start with a Knob Creek Manhattan and then upgrade to the High West, and you will, as they say in ole' gay paree, vive la difference.  The High West has layers of spice and complex flavors that the Knob Creek (while quite good) just can't match. The food is well prepared and tasty, if not outstanding.  The French Onion soup is quite sweet - like they used spanish onions instead of white ones.  It created a very distinct flavor, but by the end of the soup I was tired of it, not so much because it was cloying, but that there were no savory notes in complement.  For the entree, I had a duck breast special, and, as with all duck at French restaurants, it was well executed.  Seared breast, nice and smoky.  It was a solid performance, but not the most outstanding duck I've had in the city.  The offerings were certainly filling, however.  After the first two courses, we declined a dinner option and opted to roll ourselves out the door.   The wine list was small but affordable.  We had a lovely St Joseph.  Additionally, the staff is very friendly, and its clear that the crowd has a large percentage of locals as regulars.  The crowd represents the spectrum of the Gold Coast - young up and comers and long term residents alike.  They have the right idea - I, too, would be a regular if I lived in the neighborhood.  The cocktails are great, and the food is solid and well executed.  However, the plates were not sufficiently outstanding to make it a destination spot.",0.9966,0.762,0.194,0.044,0.4997090964590963

2011-02-14,2.0,"Quel désappointement.  I figured this would be an update from a previous review, but much to my surprise I've yet to give my .02 about what used to be one of my favorite bistros. We had our rehearsal dinner here and always loved it. After our dinner this weekend, though? The love is gone. Gone gone gone.  We had a reservation for Saturday at 7:30, arrived on time and were promptly seated. On the 2nd floor. One of the things we've always liked about Bistrot Margot is the decadent, warm, sexy, red Moulin Rouge theme in the restaurant, so imagine our surprise when we were taken to the 2nd floor to find none of that red velvet-y charm. No ooh la la. In the 10 years we've been dining here we've never sat upstairs and I'm sorry we had to this time. It's nothing like the first floor; no red, no vamp, just a lot of boring wood and no atmosphere. Okay, whatever, but I couldn't understand why we were banished to the boring beige level when there were plenty of tables on the first floor. We were seated along a banquette of 2-top tables, which was somewhat empty when we arrived. There was a couple siting 2 tables away, and we learned right away that we were being made privy to their argument. Not the best way to spend a relaxing meal on Saturday night. We had to listen to the woman tell her dining partner repeatedly ""NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING."" Magnifique.  Our waiter came by to take our drink order, and while he was pleasant enough, he just didn't seem interested. There was a specials menu, but there were apparently other specials available that we didn't know about because A) our waiter didn't tell us, and B) we missed the sign on the first floor advertising them. Maybe we would have ordered coq au vin had we known it was being offered. We started with the endive et noix and escargot, which were good, but the escargot had way too much parsley. I had the entrecote au poivre for my entree and my husband had the tilapia. I normally love the entrecote, and it was good, however the fries? No good. There was so much salt on the fries I had to wipe them off in order to eat them. My husband enjoyed the tilapia. I can't explain it but we felt somewhat rushed. The main course came out immediately after they took our appetizer, or one of our appetizer plates..why the rush? Did they need the table? The table was small and 2 extra plates and my first empty wine glass sat there thru the meal, so there was even less room. The couples on each side of us were so close we were trying to keep our elbows down so as not to bump.  The overall atmosphere was a let down. By the time we got our entrees, we were completed squished in by 2 other couples that had been seated on each side of us. The couple to our left was so close that we felt as if we were really at a 4-top. We know that this is their style of seating, however, the same type of seats on the first floor have way more space between tables, and, the music is louder, there's more general conversation, etc. so you don't feel like you're eavesdropping on the people next to you. The woman next to me was so loud that we didn't feel like we could talk to each other without shouting, so we just stopped talking. Then they brought another couple up and sat them on the other side of us, so we were surrounded. And, it was hot as hell on the 2nd floor, which made for an even more unpleasant dinner. By the time we finished out entrees we didn't want desert, we just wanted to get out of there. I looked at my watch as we were leaving: 8:38. In and out in a hour..great. We just didn't have a good time. We were cramped and crowded, the decor was blah and not at all cohesive with the 1st floor, it was uncomfortably hot..blah. Yuck. Didn't enjoy. FYI: your long table of 2-tops at the back of the 2nd floor is too crowded. Remove a table or two, for the sake of your customers! As we were leaving we walked past the bar on the 2nd floor and both of us, at the same time said, ""that's where we should have dined!"" Hindsight is a beeyotch, huh? There was a ton of space and much more intimate. When we got downstairs to leave we noticed that there were several open tables, plenty of space, which left us even further frustrated for having been banished to the 2nd floor. We both agreed that it wasn't at all what we first came to love about the place, and, I don't think we'll be going back. Now that we have Bistro Bordeaux and other equally charming places, there doesn't seem to be any reason to endure a mediocre (at best) meal.",0.9853,0.827,0.096,0.077,0.4084920634920634

The downside? SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. The hostess seemed clueless. She called us when our table was ready only to find out that it really wasn't ready for another 10 minutes. Once we sat down, it took 10 minutes for our server to greet us. Another 15 minutes until she came back to take our order. Water was also refilled quite infrequently. After 20 minutes with an empty glass, I got up, went to the bar, and picked up the metal water jug to refill my table's water. Sure, I caused raised eyebrows from idle staff members.

I told the waitress what kind of reds I like, and wanted a French bottle...she made an excellent suggestion, and we both loved the wine. We weren't that hungry, so we ordered an appetizer (it was the appetizer of the day, asparagus, with prociutto, and filo dough, with truffle hollandaise)...excellent, pear salad, mushroom soup (which had to be the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted) and a petite plate of the day, beef wellington, also excellent.

Certainly come here to enjoy a glass of wine with friends or your significant other. Having said that, I didn't care much for the photos of babies dressed like soldiers from the French Foreign Legion. It felt a little tacky.

For my entree I had Blan de Poulet, Sauce Aux Herbes et Tomate. I was very disappointed by the chicken as it was clearly a piece of processed chicken breast with a thigh attached to it.

Reisling was fantastic. In addition to the bread and butter given to us, we were quite hungry and ordered a creamy shrimp gratin appetizer. I literally said aloud, I'm trying to refrain myself from licking the plate. THAT good. We then ordered 2 entrees to split: the Duo de Canard (Duck Duo that was mouth watering served with lentils and spinach!!) and a Porkloin dish on special that was stuffed with I think spinach and served with this yummy gnocci like pasta and like a cranberry type of side? Not really sure what it was but its slightly bitter taste went well with the pork and doughy pasta.  Once we were wined and dined and agreed all 3 items we ordered were out of this world and that we have a new fav fancy dinner place, we said, why not when our waiter casually dropped off the dessert menu and went with Terrine au chocolat with Raspberries, which of course too was nothing short of delightful in my mouth. :):)  Not a cheap place to go, but well worth the price and will definitely go back or take my parents here.

The flavor of the escargot was thrown off by the shear amount of pesto in the dish. The crab casserole was very good, but very hot and I burned my mouth on it. Perhaps I should have known better. The entrees were fine, but nothing special. We split a chocolate dessert that was very rich, and topped the night off with excellent coffee. Valet parking was a nice touch, but I can only give three stars because I thought that all of the dishes could have been done better.

The wine I tried was great! It was a Bordeaux that was a mix of Cabernet and something... and only $8/glass. Definitely worth it. Maybe I will go back just for the wine. The entree I ordered was the filet mignon with crab. I ordered it medium rare, but I should have ordered it rare because it came out medium to medium well--light pink in the center, brown near the edges. I'm a snob about that; to me a filet that's even a little bit overcooked is a ruined filet. The hollandaise sauce that it came with was quite good, although the black pepper definitely overwhelmed any black truffle that was purportedly in there. I tasted the potatoes but they jut didn't do it for me... horrible texture, totally bland. I figured I would give dessert a try and went with the server's recommendation of chocolate chip bread pudding, served warm with vanilla ice cream. Again, it was just a let-down. The bread pudding wasn't particularly warm, and worse, it wasn't soft at all, it was dry and still had the texture of stale bread. The coffee I had with it was pretty good though.

Service, on the other hand, was absolutely horrible.  We had reservations but when we checked in we still had to wait even though there were open tables everywhere.  The waiter took forever to come and take our drink orders and even longer to take our food order.  He never refilled our drinks and when we finally flagged him down, he ended up forgetting to refill it.  He disappeared when it came time to get our check and took forever to ring us up when he did show up.   Overall, I still like this restaurant because the food is decently priced for French food (they have $20 prix fix on mon-thurs 5-7pm) and I've never been disappointed with the steak.  Just hope you don't get our waiter!",0.9687,0.816,0.136,0.047,0.5936111111111112

2010-06-25,4.0,"Last Thursday my boss was out of the office, and as I am wont do it, I'll sneak away for a long lunch. Keri H and I decided to change things up and meet for lunch instead of our usual dinner, and since time was not an issue, we met at Bistrot Margot, quite a ways from my office. She got a well-deserved RotD for Bistrot Margot, and it had been a couple of years since I dined here so I was excited to sit outside and enjoy some delicious French fare with my food twin. We had a lovely table on the patio on a beautiful sunny day - to my mind, it's one of the simple pleasures in life: eating outside on a  perfect day when time is not an issue, and enjoying good food with a good friend. Keri wanted the exact same dish she ordered the first time she ate there, which was a whitefish in a lemon-caper brown butter sauce and since we are still on a quest for good onion soup, she ordered that too. I had a harder time deciding what to get as everything sounded delicious. They have a soup/sandwich/creme brulee lunch combo which sounded ideal. I too, got the onion soup, half a croque monsieur, and the aforementioned creme brulee. We both agreed the onion soup was overly sweet. Typically, sweet onions are used in onion soup and caramelizing them renders them even sweeter, but there was no balance of flavor. And horror of horrors, there was but a scant amount of cheese on top, and it wasn't crusty or bubbling like it should have been. And so, the search for the quintessential onion soup continues. My croque monsieur was quite tasty though. A grilled French country ham and gruyere cheese on egg bread with a touch of dijon mustard. I would so order that again. We also spilt some pommes frites which were nice and salty and crispy. Keri's fish was just as good as she remembered and I was able to taste it (after I pushed the almonds in the sauce off to the side). I can see why she liked it so much; it was delicate and all the flavors in the sauce did not overpower the fish at all. To me, a lemon-caper sauce is just about the best complement to fish ever. It was a decent-sized portion, and she asked the server to package her leftovers. We shared my teeny-tiny creme brulee and it had the nice sugar ""skating rink"" on top that is tantamount to a good creme brulee. Not the best ever, but then again, creme brulee is not my favorite dessert. The bill came awhile later and the waiter brought out her doggie bag. It seemed there was a miscommunication and her original leftovers were inadvertently thrown away, so they made her a brand new entree to take with. I thought that was a very nice gesture, considering there wasn't that much left on her plate to begin with. For now, I'm giving Bistrot Margot 3.5 stars, but I hope to go back for dinner, which I think I'd enjoy more.",0.9969,0.8,0.171,0.029,0.49547663221132604

It was absolutely without taste or texture. Grocery store chicken has more substance. The meat had obviously been treated or bred in some way to leech out the flavors.  McDonald's does this kind of thing to their beef, continually testing until they arrive at something that looks like a hamburger, but that has no identifiable beef flavor. It displeases no one, except the few of us who want to satisfy our taste buds before we fill our stomachs. A manager stopped by to see how we were enjoying our dinner.  I told him.  He removed my plate but did not off anything, charged me for it anyway. Clueless. He did check with the chef though, who avowed that the duck had not been marinated (I thought in might have been soaked in milk for a few hours.) Clearly, this was not his mother's magret de canard. It is a sacrilege to ruin a duck. I skipped the desert, but my friend ordered the mousse au chocolat which looked like a half portion of milk chocolate flavored flan, very creatively arranged on a large plate, nothing even remotely like the mousse we enjoy in Paris.

They were uber-tasty and the broth is the best for dipping. We couldn't get enough of them.  The brie was very tasty although they were a bit stingy on the amount of brie (only 2 slices) on top of a puff pastry drizzled with honey and dried cranberries.  Delightful! We then ordered caesar salads, french onion soup, and bistro salad.  All were very good. The french onion soup had plenty of cheese and bread and was not too sweet.  I liked it a lot.  I ordered the bistro salad which could have used a little more acidity in the dressing but was overall very good especially with the HUGE lardons included in the salad. I love that salty goodness. For entrees, we had the lamb, entrecote au poivre, whitefish, and ribeye (special).  All had oustanding flavor and if I returned I wouldn't know which one I would order again.  The 'au poivre sauce'  was very peppercorn-y and very tasty. It's a twist off of the regular steak covered in peppercorns.  Much more palatable and very tasty when dipped with fries.  The lamb was perfectly cooked, well-seasoned and overall very pleasing to the tastebuds.

I live in the neighborhood and if I were to choose a chill quaint place to take a variety of different groups of people, this place would be in my top 5 on the Wells strip.  First off, it's so cute and small. The inside dining rooms are romantic and soft music croons in the background. I feel like drinking martinis or wine whenever I frequent (Maybe it's the music or decor?).  The menu is fairly small but I have tried a couple of the Entrees to get a feel for their cooking style. This place is family owned and operated so you get that ""cozy"" touch. They had tableside Dover Sole this evening and I really wish I had taken them up on it because I'm sure it's quite tasty. Tonight instead I chose the COQ AU VIN which is a Chicken Breast Cooked in Red Wine, with potatos and sauteed red peppers. I had them use the Lemon Garlic Sauce instead it the chicken was very juicy and flavorful. I've also had their SAUMON GRILLÉ ET SES LÉGUMES (Grilled Salmon) and that is also very flavorful. My friend had the soup of the day (creamy tomato) and she said it was wonderful. Tonight was a bit chilly, so soup sounded like a great idea. For dessert you should try the Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding (yum!) as well as Warm Apple Tart with Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She added her own personal touches when explaining dishes and you can tell she's very familiar with the menu which is nice because I would assume people ask have a lot of questions about the dishes.

My main issue with this place was the service overall.  Our waitress was sort of passive aggressive the entire meal.  I ordered the Negroni cocktail-  gin, Campari and bitters.  I can't drink a lot of alcohol anymore so when I do have a cocktail, I sip at it and rarely finish it (I know!  Sucks!).  We also got a bottle of wine-  an amazing Pinot Noir.  After she had served the wine, she asked me if I wanted the Negroni cleared and I responded, nope, still working on it.  She replied to me, ""Well lots of people don't like Campari.  They just don't have the palate for it.""  Wow.  Way to assume that I don't know shit about food or booze.  Mind you, this wasn't the only time that she was a little lippy--  passive-aggressively joking to my boyfriend that she was thankful that he poured himself a second glass of wine before she came back around, being bitchy when we asked if they are able to wrap your wine to go (again, not being able to drink a lot means that there's always about 3 glasses of wine left in a bottle, which always tastes better at home on the couch)...I just wasn't impressed.  She made me feel like I was out of place at the restaurant, like this was a special occasion joint for us and not somewhere we'd ever come back to.  Any time I get service like this anywhere, I just have to laugh...I've been able to eat at some wonderful places over the years and know food and LOVE food.  When we're doing a big special occasion, it's a little more involved than this--  we're looking at heading back to Seattle for Tilth for our anniversary.  So when we receive service like this somewhere, it's just laughable.  Assumptions like this will KILL your tip....and both my man and I have been known to be insanely great tippers.

In fact, someone who sat at the table after us left a hat, and they called us to make sure it was not ours the next day. I really enjoyed the food. The portions are very huge and generous. They have a really great whitefish encrusted in almonds, has no fishy flavor at all and a great sauce. I had the Moules Mariniere (had to order fries to go with it, Moules should always go with fries), and they have an AMAZING mussel sauce, it has shallots, wine, butter, dill, very rich and filling and so good. I also had a special fish halibut in the past, great sauce again, and my mother in law liked the pork tenderloin. I haven't tried the steak but may never do so, generally I am disappointed with steaks that are not from Whole Foods. It's really rich, buttery, cheesy food. They pull all the stops to make sure you get that great rich French flavor. I really enjoyed the experience of the ambiance and the food and will certainly go back many times.

Right on time our table was ready.  The restaurant was very busy and loud(something I actually like), the hostess was very friendly, and the decor was nice.  Appetizer: Scallops on top of a potato gallete with spinach and creme sauce. Phenomenal!!!  This was a wonderful starter. Entrees: We had the lamb and the duck entrees.  Both super great though the veggies and rice that came with the duck left something to be desired.  The duck confit was juicy and fell off the bone.  Dessert: pecan torte.  This was the only part of the meal that wasn't too great.  This is why I give this place four stars instead of five. It was a bit dry and needed more flavor.

I don't believe I've ever paid full price for a meal here... thanks to other websites and coupon books I've received in the mail. While I've never had a bad meal it's definitely missing the wow factor so probably not a place I'd go out of my way for now that I don't live in the area.  FYI: French restaurants worth going out of your for= Le Bouchon and Kiki's Bistro.  I had a lunch meeting in Old Town the other day and remembered that Bistrot Margot served lunch...although I'd never had the opportunity to try their lunch! And apparently I missed out all those years I was in town because their lunch proved to be pretty delicious.  I ordered the spinach salad topped with goat cheese and savored every last bite. It was also the perfect portion size for a lunch salad. Still wouldn't go out of my way for a dinner here, but I could see myself making my way back to Old Town for lunch- especially since that means I'd get to stop by my favorite boutique (Sara Jane) just down the street as well!",0.9275,0.846,0.117,0.037,0.4657004830917874
2008-12-15,4.0,"I really like this place a lot. It's really good french fare and the price is great for what you get. There was one yelper who said the prices were through the roof, but I think that's laughable since going to a French restaraunt will usually set you back $50 or more a plate. This place is a bistro so the prices aren't high at all. Not to mention my vodka tonic was $6.50 and it's 3/4 voda and 1/4 tonic water. This place is a bargain for the food. The food is great and they will alter any menu item for you if you have an allergy or if you're vegetarian. You gets tons of food on your plate as well. I've had a number of things from their menu. I love the tilapia aux noix (this is under $20 and a steal for all the food you get), and the coq au vin (this one's about $24 and there's more here than you can eat). I've had other dishes but these are great deals and tons of food. The escargot is wonderful and all the sauce left over is great for dipping your bread into. I've had a few of their desserts and my favorite is the grand manier bread pudding. It's to die for. This place is a great deal for all the food you get and your drinks aren't outrageous. If you're really looking to save some money - get one appetizer to share, one entree (it'll be enough for 2 people) and 1 dessert. And stick to water if it's that bad, otherwise, the drinks aren't bad prices at all.  Bottom line: This place is not expensive and the food is great. You would spend more here than, say, McDonald's, but this is steal for French food. Don't come expecting to get a full meal for $10, more like $20.

The night ended on a good note when we shared the creme brulee for dessert.  Overall, we really enjoyed the whole dining experience here and can't wait to stop in again next time we're in the neighborhood. I do wish they had at least one vegetarian entree on their menu, though.

2008-10-17,5.0,"This is an somewhat unfair 5 star review. It doesnt get 5 stars for the food - the food hinges between 3 and 4. It's OK - quality and reliable. It's the standards of French bistro fare and prepared well, but not outstanding. but the service-it's really top notch for a little place with such modest prices. I have been there a few times with girlfriends mostly and their soups and salads are nice. Try the French onion soup, and the salmon nicoise (large enough to feed and ARMY though).  I'm not a white wine drinker, but the house Rhone is very nice. Charming setting, very clean, and servers who know what they are serving and I never feel rushed. The 5 star rating is due to my most recent visit though. They had a Rhone wine dinner. For $75 Six courses with a wine pairing. I had a mid term that would have put me an hour late and when I called them, they said no problem, come in late, it's fine. When we got there, I realized it was a hosted dinner and the diners were almost halfway through. No prob, they said. They offered us the opportunity to join them partway thorough and they'd try to catch us up or we could start at the beginning and dine in the main dining area and start at the beginning. We opted for that. We had no idea how welcome they'd make us! The sommelier, who was, upstairs explaining each wine to the group upstairs came down and sat with us at our table  and gave us the schpeel regarding the history of the wines and the locations. He was a riot and representing the House of Glunz who supplied the wines. The real star of the show was the maitre'd who I *think* her name was Jennifer who was absolutely fabulous through out the entire meal - she elaborately described each dish-including the components, made sure we got each dish in a timely but not rushed fashion and was absolutely charming. The food was very good despite the fact that we were far behind the rest of the diners and not on the same floor as they were. They had ot prepare each dish separately for us.We were never in want for anything and felt we got VIP service by reason of being guests in their restaurant.  As an added bonus, they even moved our valet parked car to the front of the restruant b/c the valet had left for the evening AND they sent us home with a complimentary bottle of wine just because. At the end of the evening we couldn't threaten the GM (Marc?) to take a tip b/c he insisted it was included in the price fixe meal.  I truly felt like a rock star here and couldnt have asked for better dining expereince. I would recommend this place for a romantic dinner, a casual lunch with your fella on a summer day (the patio is wonderful and the wide doors that open to the street) a lunch with the girls or even to take your parents to prove you arent only eating McDonald's and sushi.",0.9975,0.793,0.166,0.041,0.579709557581898

Two thirds of the way through, I had yet to taste pepper.  Then I noticed that the sauce on my steak resembled the mushroom sauce for my friend's veal.  I mentioned this and then too late to do any good, the head waiter came out and showed me the same sauce with a few flakes of pepper in it....  proving what, I don't know.  No matter what they say they served, it wasn't peppery.   The creme brulee tasted like flan with a hard shell.  Nothing creme about it.  We spent $116 and on top of that the french fries (frites!) did taste like they were from McDonald's up the street.   I still think they pulled one over on me, but I am not going to order the peppercorn steak again just to find out if their peculiar way of doing it is consistent.",0.9513,0.875,0.11,0.015,0.49411764705882344

During my dinner Saturday night with an out-of-town friend at Bistrot Margot, everything started out parfaitement. (Believe it, people; franglais everywhere.) The red walls and black-and-white art on the walls feels lovely and cozy, and the tiny ceramic tile floors add a certain...je ne sais quoi. Those little tiles do get incredibly slippery during the dinner service, though. (Attention!) We were seated at a tiny table underneath the staircase; it was dark and hard to read our menus, but it was a lovely spot to catch up. Our server was incredibly informed about the wine list and had opinions on favorite menu items. He was charming and just talkative enough to keep us entertained, but not enough to bother us while we chatted. He recommended a big, jammy Malbec (Catena, $49) to go with our dinners, and I ordered to satisfy my week-long craving of steak-frites. I decided so hastily that I didn't check to see how it would be served, but it turned out to be some kind of ridiculous herbed garlic butter. DRENCHED in it.  But that wasn't the worst part. The delicious-looking fries were crispier than I'd expected. Murderously crispy, as it turned out. Trying to be proper, I skewered a few with my fork and tried to bend them into my mouth as I so often do. I was surprised and pained to find they didn't have the give I expected, and one of them shot underneath my tongue and punched a hole in my gums. Sacre BLEU! So, while that put a damper on my dining experience, my friend loved his entree, the skate wing with roasted potatoes. Determined not to let my oral injury completely taint the meal, we ordered two desserts -- what luxury! I had the terrine de chocolate, served with white chocolate and raspberry drizzle (and what tasted like canned whipped cream? seriously?), and my friend had the Grand Marnier bread pudding. Which was absolutely delicious.

We thought we might as well have some drinks while waiting. We asked the bartender if he has some special drinks that we can try (many bartenders create their own speciality drinks) but he looked at us with a long and sour face and apathetically replied, ""Uhh, I'll make whateva you want.""

I actually burned my tongue because I couldn't wait for it to cool down before eating. It was an average experience overall.

I ordered the duck confit and wild rice with pecans and vegetables.  The duck slices were extremely tender, very well cooked and flavored.  They went well with the crunchy wild rice mixture.  The duck breast, on the other hand, was slightly overcooked and too salty.  Still, I think my dish was probably the best of the evening.  My boyfriend had the risotto with steak, which wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either.  I think we were expecting it to be a steak with risotto on the side, but it was actually steak chunks mixed into the risotto.  Personally, I prefer risotto in small portions so it was a little too much for me. For dessert, we picked the pecan tart even though we were advised to go for the apple one.  I liked the vanilla ice cream (which actually had bits of vanilla seed in it) but the pecan tart was too much like pecan pie for me, though with less of the ""jelly"" texture.  That's really our fault for not clarifying first.  I thought it was going to be something made of a pecan batter.

My toast was dense enough for a substantial crackle, while remaining soft and bready on the inside. While I meant to skip on the carbs, I kept taking one last bite after another until it was gone altogether.

(you know how when some people recommend places you're like, ""let's go right now!"" & when others recommend places, you're like, ""oh ... yeah ... i'll definitely hafta check that out sometime ... ::uncomfortable pause::"") Well we went & none of us were thrilled with our food.  My best friend got the some sort of seafood - mussels, I think, or oysters (probably both, knowing her appetite) - & thought they were salty but good.  She also got the pomme frites because she likes her French Fries to sound exotic or something, who knows, but they were just so-so.  My other friend, a fashionable Boystown boi, got a steak dish & thought it was bland.  I didn't see a whole lot on the menu that I could order, being a non-meat-eater, so I got the French Onion soup.  I'm not a fan of French Onion soup anyways, but I thought, hey ... French restaurant, it'll probably as good as I'll ever have it outside of France, right? Nope.  Still don't like it. & never had the inclination to go back.",0.9905,0.75,0.191,0.059,0.41559523809523813
2006-05-25,4.0,"Bistrot Margot fulfills my three ""F""s (which, unlike your high school years, are not something to fear): friendly, flavorful, and fun. Despite (1) having a rear-ender occur as I was cutting into my first piece of lamb and (2) paying a young entrepreneur $5 for the most god-awful hideous balloon-flower wrist corsage, I really enjoyed my meal there, and it just reinforced my recollection of previous dining experiences here at Bistrot Margot. I've come here multiple times for brunch, and they serve a delicious, plentiful, and relaxed brunch.  For dinner tonight, I chose to sit in the patio area out front, and it was a relaxing and fresh experience. The cheery French music inside drifted outdoors through the wide-open patio doors. Inside, the atmosphere is equally accessible-but-charming with a general deep red theme and dark wood with unobtrusive but thoughtful prints on the walls. I'd give the setting a 4. It's very cute and not intimidating in a frou-frou way.  The food was quite tasty, and I was overall very pleased with my meal. The bread was REALLY good. Don't ask me why! But the entree I chose tonight was really the star. I had the Gigot d'agneau brais, which is a braised lamb with herbs. It was really tasty, and it came with potato gallette and roasted tomatoes. It was flavorful and moist, and the sides were equally good. Having a major sweet tooth, I of course ordered dessert. (Of course!) Sadly, though, I was actually a little disappointed with my Tarte Aux Pommes (which was an apple tart served warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce). It wasn't quite warm, and the dough...call me crazy...tasted a little frozen. I don't know if that makes sense, but something just tasted off with it. Overall, the food would probably get a 3.5 from me.  The service was stellar. Dining alone is a real eye-opener as to service usually -- ""will I be treated worse because there is lower potential for tips for almost the same amount of work?"" That definitely was not the case here. My server, Oscar, was very friendly, helpful, and had a great attitude. The staff kept the bread coming and the water filled. They all worked efficiently and seemed to have good attitudes about it. The service gets a solid 4 from me.  I'd recommend coming here. It's a lot of fun, and while the prices can get a little high, (here come the Fs) it's got a fun atmosphere, flavorful food, and very friendly staff.   For shits and giggles, I will now single-handedly try to reinvent the F to a desirable achievement. Believe you me, you'll soon see Fs in a new light!",0.9977,0.751,0.204,0.044,0.4865371900826446
2006-05-15,4.0,"I don't typically eat at Bistrot Margot, but my friend and I had a certificate from  restaurant.com  so we decided to check it out tonight. I had been there a few times before and my friend had never been there. Overall, it's a great atmosphere...it was pretty coupley tonight, which made me realize it's the perfect setting for a date. The food is very good. I had the salmon, which was delicious and my friend had the tilapia which she raved about. They also had half bottles of wine tonight, which I believe happens every Monday.  I love their outdoor patio as well so I'll be back when it gets a little warmer outside.",0.9946,0.657,0.343,0.0,0.49589743589743585
2006-03-18,4.0,"I recently found this Old Town Bistro and I have brought 3 friends there in 3 weeks! I have opted for Sunday brunch each time. The food is amazing. The wine is delish and the prices are incredible. The French Onion Soup is brilliant, the bread and butter is amazing and the Croque Monsiuer (ham and cheese sandwich) is RIDICOULOUS!! Of course the Quiche is also quite good. You certainly cannot beat it for the money and the neighborhood is a great place to people watch. See ya Sunday!",0.9791,0.748,0.252,0.0,0.6071428571428571
2006-02-08,3.0,"""This French Bistro is very cute on the outside and equally cute on the inside. In the summer months they have outdoor seating which I would definitely recommend because the inside does tend to be a bit on the stuffy side. However, the food is great. The French Onion Soup is delicious and my steak pomme frites were good. Not the best meal I've ever had but a definite option for French food in trendy Old Town.""",0.9432,0.765,0.235,0.0,0.48571428571428577
