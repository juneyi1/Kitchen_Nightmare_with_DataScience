2017-07-31,3.0,"We were staying at the Drake Hotel, so the location was convenient. We really liked the dark, pubby vibe. The bench seat that held my bottom was perhaps the most comfortable ever.  The service was slow at first, but after the party next to us left, very quick and friendly. The drink menu was not huge, but had enough of what I wanted.  We tried the pretzels for an appetizer. The pretzels themselves were average, but the Gouda dipping sauce was amazing. We tried the cod and chips and the crab cakes as entrees. The fish was very average. Being from New England, the dish was nothing incredible. I had to ask for tartar sauce and what they brought was probably store-bought. The crab cakes were also mediocre, however, the inclusion of rhubarb in the salad was interesting.  We tried the brownie for dessert, and would not do it again. It consisted of a small, soft circle that hardly registered as chocolate, with chocolate in the center, almost like a lava cake. Unfortunately this was relatively tasteless and not warm enough. The dish was topped with blackberry, raspberry, as well as dried powder from both fruits. The creme fraise ice cream was interesting.  Overall a very average place in a city filled with excellent food.",0.9832,0.82,0.148,0.032,0.5566528925619834

They said this place??  Ok so the ONLY difference seems like the type of bread but the waiter obviously didn't want to suggest that's probably what I wanted.  I was in the food service industry and always tip the same whether it's sit down or take out since I know they work just as hard, but apparently he didn't know that nor wanted to bother, not that it should matter.

I ate it everyday. It's snapper in a tomato base that comes out with Sherry that you pour in before eating. Extremely good. The Buffalo Wings are very saucy, and good. Fries were good as well and made fresh. The margaritas were made fresh. However, I ordered a caipirinha and I have drank several. This drink on the other hand was a mystery to me.

What we found instead was a limited knowledge of cocktails and generally gruff service. While Coq D'Or touts a long and esteemed history, it is in practice no different than your standard (read:slightly sub-par) hotel bar. If you order drinks from the cocktail menu, then have no doubt that what you get will be well-made. My Manhattan, for example, was totally adequate. Caveat emptor if you order off the provided list, however. I ordered a Martinez, and only got confused looks from the bartender. I explained to him what was in it, hoping to jog his memory. Instead I got a skeptical look and a less than encouraging offer to mix those ingredients together (nevermind proportions). Plenty of nice bars nail this classic cocktail. I was surprised that Coq D'Or was in the dark. The wine list was only about ok. Meanwhile, service was moderately bad. We had waiters roll their eyes at us when we changed tables to get away from an annoyingly loud patron. The cocktail menu was partially thrown to us at the bar, with a faint air of disgust or annoyance. At no point did the bartender make us feel welcome, and at no point were we impressed by his service. In the end, it was not an impressive experience. Coq D'Or is satisfactory if you want a drink off their menu, but not worth the trip if you are looking for an experience that lives up to the hype.",-0.1009,0.839,0.076,0.085,0.5937925170068029

2014-08-28,5.0,"Had lunch here after a site visit at The Drake--- and was absolutely blown away. The restaurant is dimly lit and decorated with red furniture that gives it a cozy and intimate feel. I couldn't spend too much time in this restaurant-- I need windows and natural light! But it totally makes sense that back in the day people would come here for their cigar and brandy fixings--- gives you that feel of doing something bad and you feel so cheeky about it.  The chef brought out a split pea soup with lobster amuse bouche--- FRIGGIN' DELICIOUS. I normally hate peas and the sound of split pea soup did not seem good--- but I took one sip and didn't want to stop. It was sooo good-- very refreshing, but still flavorful. We had the crab cakes, which weren't too breaded, which was delightful to see and not have to taste the breading! I only wish that I ordered the bookbinder soup--- since I've never had it and now I'm intrigued--- I feel like I always eat crab cakes every time I order seafood. Should have tried something new! Had the salmon with cheese grits and asparagus--- it was the cheese grits that got me. It was good but now I wonder if I should have tried the lobster roll instead since that was recommended. Anyway, I love that the salmon had the skin on and was crispy--- I love grilled salmon skin.  BTW, I ordered the deep sea margarita, and not only was it HUGE (felt like I was on vacay), but delicious--- right amount of saltiness. We were also served a basil gelato with strawberry champagne sauce. There's just something about basil and strawberry that goes so well together, and this was another affirmation of it.  Service was great too--- I'm definitely going to have to check this place out after hours for a cocktail--- and to get the bookbinder soup and lobster roll.",0.9958,0.805,0.177,0.018,0.6435642135642134

What else does one do when taking a break from shopping on Michigan Avenue?  Until then, I had exemplary service in all of the establishments I'd visited...until I got to Coq d'Or.  One would think that service would be better at such a legacy establishment.   I love the ambiance of Coq d'Or, but do not care for the pretentiousness with which our sullen waiter attended to us.  It took a complaint to the manager to get things moving.  Upon arriving, it took 20 minutes to place a drink order, 15minutes for those bevvies to show up and 10 minutes after that to even get menus!  I couldn't believe that our waiter was moving so slowly with the place being so crowded.  While I understand what one Yelper was saying about attire, should the Coq d'Or wish to suggest a dress code in order to get better service, I suggest that they post a sign at the door requiring gentlemen to wear sport coats, and ladies to wear hosiery and high heels. In spite of the bad service, the Bookbinder Soup was sublime and the fries were done to a perfect crispness.  Since I ordered a Jack Daniels on the Rocks, there was no way that ANYONE could mess that up, so the drink was decent (two stars for the food and beverage). Should I visit the Coq d'Or again, I shall be sure to wear one of my classic Chanel suits, and have my Hermes purse proudly displayed.  Maybe this will get our waiter to take notice...of course, I could just stay the hell out of his section.  (Just so you know...it's the section at the very back of the establishment, across from the bar, and closest to the kitchen.  If you want better service...pick another spot in the restaurant.)",-0.6351,0.813,0.089,0.098,0.5057716049382717
2011-10-01,5.0,"Simply put, one of the greatest bars in the city. Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is old school. And yes, you might get spotty service if you're dressed like you picked clothes out of the hamper. However, for people who get it, there is no substitute. If Bob, Polo or Hana are working, you're in good hands and if you've been there before, they will likely remember you. They do have beer, but the smart money is on the executive mixed drinks. Considering how much liquor is in them and the area you're in, they're not a bad deal at all. Two executives will have even the most seasoned drinker feeling pretty good. The real beauty of the Coq, for me, is in the entire experience. I can be walking on a bustling Michigan Avenue packed with people and sneak into the Coq and feel like I'm in an entirely different time and place. The room is warm, the conversation is always great and the snack bowls are always stocked. I've never come here and not had great conversation with strangers. Never once have I been there and been disappointed. Next time you're in the area, stop in and jump back to a time when men didn't drink 65 calorie beers, there was only one flavor of vodka and vegans didn't exist.",0.9918,0.768,0.199,0.033,0.5559027777777777

After threatening to remodel the venerable Coq D'or for the last few years, it has finally happened. Gone is the old red carpeting, replaced by -- wait for it-- new red carpeting! TA - DAAA!!!  The old dark woodwork is lighter now. Maybe that's what it was originally, before years of smoke and such aged it's patina to to a dark walnut. Now its kind of a redish maple.  The old murals remain intact.  The oversized and hopelessly uncomfortable elbow rail is gone, so your food is now a reasonable distance from your face.  The old and beat up lower back bar has been rebuilt and thank god for that.  The back bar features that big, bright Micros touchscreen front and center for all to gaze at. I really wish it was off to the side as opposed to being a focal point. Which brings me to the rest of my review.  Thank god, they didn't wreck the place. It has remained intact for the most part. The most horrible, and I do mean HORRIBLE thing is the lighting. Excuse me Coq D'or, but there are these things called ""dimmer switches"" that would do you well here. Please look into it.  Every sconce has glare. The new lights beaming down on the brightly polished brass bar are twice as glarey and reflective.  The entire room is lit up like an upscale senior citizens dining room.  It is way too bright in here to be handsome. And its hard to rely on charming. And give the ladies a break.

My husband and I each had 2 drinks. I first ordered a highball. It was made with Seagrams 7, and therefore was way too sweet. I couldn't taste any alcohol! I prefer bourbon to blended whiskey and I thought a highball was made with bourbon. Maybe I'm mistaken?  My second drink was a piña colada, because I'm such a sucker for them and the recipe looked great. However, it was definitely made with a mix and not well blended. And again, way too sweet and light on the alcohol. Very disappointing. My husband had the cucumber classic cocktail and that was excellent. However, his old fashioned had no orange or cherry and was made with Jim Beam. Really? An $11.50 old fashioned at The Drake made with Jim Beam?  And the men's bathroom is outside the restaurant and my husband said it was filthy and smelled of urine.  One of the urinals had a big box over it - guess it was broken?

2008-01-13,5.0,"Ah...the Drake..is there anything about you I don't love?  I think not. I used to come here (and to the Cape Cod) room with my dad and sister for lunch.  I always felt like I was getting away with something being in here - it always felt so grown up. I mean, c'mon, you could get soup with booze in it! Dark, clubby, old school - great place to have a fancy drink and chat up the geriatric neighborhood regulars who always have great stories to tell once they've gotten a few under their belts. So, the fella and I got hitched one Saturday morning and by the time we made it to the hotel, we needed a drink and some hangover curing food so we could enjoy our wedding day.  The Coq D'or Lounge, as usual,  did not disappoint. Had the bookbinder soup (of course), fish and chips and a burger.  It makes me very happy that this is one of the few places in town where they still remember to bring out the damn vinegar with the fish, bless their time-warped hearts.  Burgers are cooked correctly, as in if you ask for medium, you actually get medium, and the sides (fries, coleslaw) are fresh and tasty.   The drinks?  Cold and plentiful - you want a vodka tonic at noon?  They're not judging - as long as you don't prance in here like Lindsay Lohan or something.  Then, forget it.  You'll be treated, well, exactly how you deserve.  This place is old school - be polite, the staff appreciates it.  One of Chicago's best bars, period.",0.9846,0.831,0.141,0.028,0.44930555555555557

2007-04-19,5.0,"If you want a good, strong drink after work, then come here. This place has a very cool vibe, lots of older patrons, white tablecloths, and a nice staff. I'm always happy when I leave the Coq D'Or. They have an array of excellent appetizers. I spent under $40.00 without tip for two drinks and one appetizer and I'll definitely be back.",0.9674,0.665,0.318,0.017,0.5611666666666666

I came here to see the Super Bowl last year and it was nice to not be around the typical super bowl crowd.",0.9655,0.65,0.325,0.024,0.5181818181818182
2006-06-23,4.0,"Coq D'or is my favorite bar if I am on Michigan Ave. for whatever reason.  First, the ""executive size"" cocktails hit the spot (one manhattan = a brandy sifter full of bourbon and a small glass to pour it into).  The bartenders are always nice and the mix of people is odd.  You get tourists who stay at the Drake, old-timers who look like they have been coming in since they got their liquor license back, and many others.  They have a great lounge singers ala ""Lost in Translation"" and a piano man.  The food is pretty decent and cheap for the area, I usually stick to the fried cheese wedges, the bookbinder soup is an alcoholic treat as well.  Unfortunately since the smoking ban it has lost it's appeal as a dark, smoky haunt of old Chicago, but they still sell cigars at the bar for you to enjoy outside.",0.802,0.817,0.114,0.068,0.5289473684210527
