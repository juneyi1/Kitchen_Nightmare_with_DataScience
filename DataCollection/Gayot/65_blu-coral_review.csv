If you don't believe me, ask Lulu R. who I randomly ran into while here! Even funnier, I ran into friends from college. Weird. Seriously, the Chicago As Am community was up in this place... So why the low rating? 1. Don't come here if you're a mature, independent female, several years out of college - like me. The clientele are young and in some cases, too reckless for my taste. 2. The idea of giving out shots by pouring vodka straight down your throat from a handle and then making you pay for it is disgusting. 3.  You know why the girl was drinking out of the faucet?

Walked in and the interior was pretty cool as and very well lit.  We had a party of 5 and an 8PM reservation so we had no trouble with seating. For some reason I was in the mood for an Amaretto Sour so thats what I ordered and everyone else was having a special martini (can't remember the name but it was something seductive) that included strawberries. It took a long while for our drinks to arrive and we were told it was because the bartender was busy making so many drinks which is interesting since the place didn't look too packed. For my meal I had the spicy tuna and one of their signature rolls, The Octo which is spicy salmon over spicy octopus. The spicy tuna was good as well as the octo, which I truly recommend. Blu Coral isn't as pricey as most sushi joints and the rolls are pretty good. The only real problem I had was with the service on what seemed to be a not too crowded evening.

Our reservations were for 8:30, and by the time we arrived, the place was nearly empty. Take note: you don't need to make reservations here because it doesn't fill up. The restaurant tries very hard to be cool and contemporary but falls short and ends up at kitschy-modern (but it has Christmas lights!). I'm just thankful that the advertised band wasn't there to spark things up.   We ordered Sake and Sapporo to start (with the plan of doing Sake bombs). Our Sake was 10$ off, so that was a nice surprise on a 40$ bottle. The waitress originally poured it in to champagne flutes, but, when we requested shot glasses, they happily obliged.  For our meal, we had a hard time figuring out what to order because all of the rolls seemed deep-fried, covered in cheese, and injected with mayonnaise. We eventually decided on the Ocean Drive role (because it was repeatedly mentioned on Yelp) and several pieces of hamachi, maguro, and sake. We were not impressed with the Ocean Drive role. The bell peppers overpowered any other taste inside, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why they would call this role the ""Ocean Drive"". I mean, I guess it has fish in it, and fish are from the ocean...  Anyways, the actual sushi was standard. Nothing too exciting. The bill ended up being 75$ for two people.  Would I recommend this restaurant? Probably not. But the lack of patrons did make us feel less disrespectful when we were downing our sake bombs.

At the end of the night we had made $200 toal which was better than any other band had done. We were asked by the owners to come back at the end of the month. When we cam back our assumption was that we would be given the same guarantee. Low and behold we played for 3+ hours and were given $30 because no one was there.

2009-11-05,1.0,"I am updating my review to reflect a recent experience I had with a take out order from Blu Coral.  Recently my husband and I placed an order for sushi and cooked dishes.  We have a newborn now and cannot get to the restaurant as often so we thought we would try delivery since I like it so much.  We ordered exactly what we order when we dine in and we ordered it exactly the way we do when we dine in.  My husband gets the steak and he asks for everything on the side -- otherwise it comes piled high on top of grilled vegetables and with fried onions on top.  This time we ordered two steaks and I specified with both that everything should be on the side -- nothing should be on top of the steak.  When the order arrived, there were several issues.  First and foremost, both steaks came with fried onions piled on top and smashed into the steaks by the container lids so you couldn't really scrape them off.  Plus, the steak tasted like the onions.  Second, they put the sauces on the side and the teriyaki that they sent was not right.  It was thich and smelled almost like bbq sauce.  Remember, we eat here all the time and know exactly how their sauces taste.  Third, they crammed my two sushi rolls into a container that was too small and with nothing to keep it separate, the wasabi was smashed against one of the rolls, rendering three pieces inedible (I like wasabi as much as the next girl, but not that much!).   I called the restaurant and explained to the woman who answered what happened.  Without putting me on hold, she talked to the manager and said I was complaining.  My subsequent conversation with the manager was very frustrating.  While he offered to remake the meal, he didn't really indicate he understood what was wrong.  At that point I didn't want them to remake it because it already took an hour to get the first one delivered and I didn't want to wait another hour for the meal.  Ultimately, he did offer to send us a gift card to make up for the errors.  If that is where the story ended, then my update might be a one star reduction but I would say that overall I was happy with the result.  Instead, I receieved the gift card as promised but with a letter that listed out the errors I reported and refuted all of them.  One problem -- the letter didn't accurately list what I complained about, which tells me they either didn't understand and didn't clarify with me or they weren't listening or paying attention to what I was saying.  They also only gave us a gift card to cover the meat items instead of the sushi, which was also not right.  As a very loyal customer, I was really put off by the tone of the letter, which was essentially, we didn't do anything wrong but here's a gift card that expires in 30 days.   If the gift card had arrived without the letter, I wouldn't think anything of it, but the letter was so rude.  What happened to the customer is always right?  I was very polite when I called the restaurant to let them know our order was wrong and was very patient on the phone explaining things several times.  As someone who used to consider Blu Coral my go to sushi place, I was really disappointed at the level of service.     Given the restaurant is almost always empty or close to it when we dine there, I would think they would want to keep their loyal customers.  I am going to respond to the letter and will post an update on the management's response.  I'm not looking for additional gift cards or discounts, just good customer service and acknowledgement that my complaints were valid.  I hope they come through because I will miss their sushi but I won't go back there or order from them until that happens.",0.779,0.842,0.085,0.074,0.42563492063492064

2009-07-29,2.0,"So given the glowing reviews here on Yelp, I decided to go to Blu Coral with my husband and two family friends. I consider myself a fairly well-educated sushi consumer - I eat unagi happily, very little in the sushi world scares me (you can keep your blowfish) and I've been to a great number of sushi restaurants from here to London. That being said... I was so very underwhelmed by this place.  First of all, we walked in around 7:30pm on a Wednesday night to incredibly loud lounge music. Now, I get it. You're a sushi LOUNGE. But if I can't hear my husband speak from across the table it's simply too loud for a restaurant, in my humble opinion (though if I ever have to take a boring or gabby friend out, I'm coming here). So already we were a bit wary, even if we couldn't communicate that to each other over the damn music.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, I'll give her that. But the sushi? Really - meh, guys. Several of the rolls fell apart on the way to my soy sauce, and while I didn't get the impression that the fish was sub-par, nothing really stood out. Oh, that's a lie. One roll did. I forget what it's called, but it's the roll that's smothered in melted mozzarella. Now, I'm a pastry chef, so I'm all for experimentation (which is why I ordered the odd-sounding roll in the first place) but it was absolutely disgusting. You put the piece of sushi in your mouth, you chew a few times thinking, ""Huh. This is interesting."" And then suddenly you're thinking of pizza. With... soy sauce on it. And... raw fish. There must be enough people ordering this roll to keep it on the menu, but it may stand out as the worst piece of sushi I've ever had. I'd be curious to try it with asiago or pecorino though. Anyone a sushi chef up in this joint? Then came dessert. And I have to sigh loudly here and admit - ok. I'm kind of a dessert snob. The desserts sounded lovely though (atypical for a sushi restaurant, in my experience) so we each ordered something different and waited excitedly.  Oh, the disappointment. My friend's key lime tart came out in what looked like an unbaked tart shell which was so soggy she had to send it back. Our waitress was very kind and brought her something new saying, ""Oh, most of our desserts sit in the fridge so they get soggy sometimes."" What?? Really?? Oy. My chocolate/vanilla/cherry dessert would have been ok if it hadn't been smothered in cocoa powder (because nothing says delicious like a puff of bitter powder in your mouth). My husband's key lime cheesecake was ok if kind of boring and the fourth dessert was chocolate lava cake... with no lava. Seriously. You cut into it and there's this gelatinous pudding-like lump that doesn't ooze anywhere. How sad.  The perks? A live jazz band started half way through our meal (huzzah! a break from the obnoxiously loud lounge music!) that was phenomenal. The service really was great and the prices weren't too expensive. Also there's free parking in the Jewel lot just north on Milwaukee. Beyond that I'd opt for ANY other sushi place. How this won ""Best Sushi in Chicago"" is completely beyond me. Total meh.

The decor is relatively modern and there is a pretty nice ambiance, and the food is quite delicious.  The only thing I remember getting is the Maui Tartar as an appetizer and needless to say, it was amazing.  I think all we got after was sashimi and I was pleasantly surprised--all of the fare was very fresh and the flavors superb.  Also, I really appreciated that the fish was cut masterfully. Other than that, I have also ordered from them through Grub Hub for delivery.  Honestly, the food was still good; but I've gotta admit--it doesn't compare without the ambiance.  And way too much for take out night. So if you're looking for a great ambiance and super fresh fish, I'd definitely recommend Blu Coral.  Only thing is, you best make a recommendation for anything starting at 7 or 8; but if you make it earlier, like 6 as we did, there's barely going to be anyone there.  In fact, I think I remember a single mother and her children there...yeah that was kind of a mood killer.  But the food certainly made up for it.",0.9928,0.735,0.236,0.03,0.6464682539682541

And to top off a great sushi and drink menu, the prices are completely reasonable (you can get $4 rolls, martinis are closer to $10 though). For such a nice place (the ambiance is great) you would expect to pay twice as much. I am someone who likes to stay close to home when going for a meal but this is definitely worth leaving my neighborhood for!

When you walk in, the decor is nice.  It's shiny and colorful.  We sat near the bar and had a great view of the HDTVs, so we could sneak peeks at the Cubs game.  The main dining area looked nice and the bathroom interior design was cool, too. Dining tables are round and small in the bar area, so they were awkward to bunch together for large groups.  Chairs were unique but also awkward to sit on. Staff was friendly but not always readily available. I ordered a dirty martini and it was awful.  It was weak and the olive juice and olives were bad.  I asked for 4 olives, b/c I love em, and could only stomach 1.  Really disappointing considering it was almost $10.  I switched to beer while my friends continued with their hot and cold sake. Beers and sake were thankfully more reasonable, $4.50 for beers and $12 for the sake bottles. The appetizers were decent, but tiny portions for the price.  We got the Sunomono and Dragon Fire, which were good and had a nice presentation (especially with the Bacardi 151 fire on the plate), but totally overpriced. The sushi was decent, but pricey, too.  If I were to go back, I'd only get the Pink Cadillac, which had delicious fruit on top.

We ordered off of the menu instead of getting the special since I am somewhat of a purist (no super fancy rolls for me)I thought it was good. The nigiri was fresh, the specialty rolls were good and interesting, we were seated right away and the food came out quickly...where they lose points is in service and competitiveness.  Our appetizer came out not two minutes after our miso soup. After we finished our soup and were working on the appetizer the first plate came. We finished the appetizer and the second plate came before we'd started on the first one. After finishing the first plate ALL OF THE DISHES were still on the table. I had to ask twice to have her take plates away. We were eating our second round of sushi and the miso soup cups were still there. This isn't necessarily a big deal if the tables are big, but this was a tiny little round table. She walked by several times and I KNOW she saw the plates but I got the impression that she didn't feel it was her job since there was a guy going around taking plates away. If I'm sitting there with three courses of empty plates at my table it is her job.  The wine special was really blah. I only drank it because I bought it. As far as the competitiveness issue, while yes the food was pretty good, I've had just as good of sushi at Butterfly for half the price. Green Tea also has just as good of sushi for half the price. So for general overpricing they lose a star. I also felt like the server thought we were a hassle because we wanted to order off of the menu (sorry I don't like cream cheese in my rolls).

I'm not going to be a sore loser. I'll refrain from unleashing harsh criticism. So Yelp Chicago: This review is you. THE REVIEW Blu Coral was voted ""Best Chicago Sushi"" in 2006 and 2007 by Yelp competitor Citysearch. Best sushi? No, not really.  (conscience) Behave Max! You promised. Uh humm, I meant to say that Blu Coral isn't bad. That is if you like a large selection of maki rolls.  (conscience) Max! Okay. Blu Coral deserves some credit. For example, the restaurant offers a 15% discount for any dinner reservation between 5-6pm daily, except on holidays (Early Bird Special) They have free parking avaliable in the Jewel Osco and Kmart plaza.  (conscience) Good. Keep it up. The restaurant feels more like a club and lounge than like a sushi restaurant. In fact, the restaurant transforms itself into a club on the weekends. The owner was very warm.  (conscience) You're fillibustering. Alright. Alright. The sushi is priced similar to other sushi restaurants: $2-3 per piece of nigiri depending on the fish. The common rolls like Spicy Tuna are $6 for 6 pieces. The special maki rolls come in 6 or 8-10 pieces. The 6 piece special maki costs $8-10. The 8-10 piece special maki rolls range in price between $12-15.  I ordered: 2 botan ebi (good) 2 albacore (average) 2 halibut (average) 1 hamachi (average) 1 ikura (average) 1 spicy tuna roll (good) 1 spicy blue crab roll (average) My buddies ordered Pink Cadillac and some other rolls that I can't remember. They were none the wiser and, hence, enjoyed their sushi rolls.  Seriously, the sushi nigiri isn't that great. I would stick to rolls at Blu Coral. I would also take advantage of the Early Bird Special. I can deal with average sushi at the prices after 15% off. I ordered a large Sapporo and my check came out to $45 with tax and tip. Not bad.

The menu is huge. Our two appetizers couldn't have been more different.  The oven baked sake roulade tasted incredible, but I thought that $11 should have gotten us 4 pieces instead of 3 - next time I'll just order a good maki roll instead.  On the other hand, the veggie and shrimp tempura was huge; they brought us 2 extra pieces for free, which made it a great deal at $8.  Still, tempura is tempura, so it tasted fine, but it was nothing unique. We then preceded to split 3 maki rolls.  The shrimp tempura was pretty standard, but the two signature maki rolls we had were fantastic.  Blue Coral's signature maki incorporates distinct combinations of ingredients, and the 5 pieces each were large enough.  Next time I go (and I will certainly go again), I will sit indoors and stick to the signature maki.",0.9971,0.781,0.194,0.025,0.5324891774891776

2008-09-04,4.0,"We had the pleasure of eating at this establishment the Sunday before Labor Day. We found the food to be excellent but the service to be a bit on the slow and inattentive side. I believe though this was the fault of mangement not staffing properly as opposed to the servers fault. Our server was very nice, very friendly and attentive in the beginning but as additional tables were sat we found ourselves waiting longer and longer. However I can put up with some slow service if the food is good. This was definitely the case at Blu Coral. What was ordered: From the Drink Menu: Lychee Martini - Perfect lychee flavor not overly sweet. Watermelon Martini - The description said it had pureed watermelon in it. It didn't appear that way however it was still pretty good. From the Food Menu: Tower Tartar - This wasn't what I was expecting as far as presentation. Not really a tower more like a scoop of tartar in the center of the plate. The taste was very good though and I found myself scooping up every last morsel with my chopsticks. Dragon Fire - Impressive flaming display. What can I say I am a sucker for anything flaming. The fresh asparagus made these rolls extra crunchy and good. Sweet Blossom Maki - I love, love, loved the sauce this came in. A bit on the spicy side but wonderful. Blu Coral Maki - Excellent! The cream cheese helped take the edge off the spicyness of the tuna. I also really liked the texture of the soy sheet that was wrapped around the roll. Pink Cadillac Maki - Spicy but oh so delicious. The combination of spicy and sweet hit the spot and all the right notes. Seven Bridge Maki - Yummy! The tobiko made this one extra special. From the Nigiri Menu: Fatty Yellowtail Salmon Roe Fatty Tuna Sea Urchin Stoplight Tobiko  Everything on the Nigiri menu was very fresh and good. The only complaint I had was they didn't indicate the Stoplight Tobiko Nigiri did not indicate that it came with quail egg yolk on it. I would not have ordered had I known that. From the Dessert Menu: Chocolate Lava Cake Mango Cheesecake Nothing spectacular about either dessert but were both satisfying none the less.  We were both thrilled with our meal and would both return! Great job Blu Coral!",0.9988,0.691,0.26,0.049,0.6191765873015872
2008-08-30,4.0,"We went at 6:30 on a Thursday night and, like other reviewers, I wondered why there was no one in this place...literally.  Well, except for the staff.  When we left at about 8pm there were only 3 couples in the seemingly cavernous dining room. Speaking of the cavernous dining room, I also agree with other reviewers in that the ambiance of this place is a little weird.  I understand that they're trying to go for the modern, post-industrial vibe but, unlike so many successful such designs, this one comes off as kinda cold and antiseptic. Also, considering that the place was completely empty, the music was unnecessarily loud.  The outdoor patio is very nice, however, and it's esp. nice that it's far off the street. The food, while interesting, didn't ""wow"" me.  We started with the Tower Tartare.  By its description I expected a ""poke-style"" tartare: chunky pieces of fish.  The ingredients in this dish, however, seemed to be just shy of pureed together, then glopped onto a bed of crispy rice noodles.  Weird, the flavor was just OK.  The Filet Spring Roll was the best dish we had.  It had a great balance of interesting Japanese and Thai flavors that all worked really well together.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Maki roll - it's always seemed to me to be the favored choice of novices that want to ""go for sushi"" but are trepidatious about eating raw fish.  Considering the quite large selection of interesting-looking maki-rolls offered here, however, it occurred to me that these are the ""specialty"" of this place and maybe we should try a couple.  We chose the Salmon Obsession and the Red Dragon rolls.  Both were beautifully presented, but ""just OK"" flavor-wise.  BTW...we learned that black tobiko is a VERY fishy roe while orange tobiko has a mush fresher flavor.  Lastly we had the lobster tempura which, since I LOVE both lobster AND tempura, I was really excited about.    This place does tempura REALLY well and I appreciate the interesting variety of veggies they use.  However, lobster doesn't lend itself well to the tempura preparation - it tends to get way over-cooked.  I also liked that they offered an interesting sesame/balsamic dip as well as the standard tempura dip. The service was fair, though not as attentive as you'd think it would be considering we were the ONLY GUESTS THERE.  Luckily my husband and I enjoy each others company so it wasn't an issue.  However, when we asked our server which dishes were the most popular, got the biggest raves or that she would recommend she seemed pretty apathetic about everything (bad sign) except one: the filet dish.  She was pretty adamant about that one and it was a good call.  I would definitely consider returning to try a few more things in hopes that perhaps we just missed the best dishes. One last comment about the space:  I agree with other reviewers about the bathrooms.  The common wash-area is just a bad idea.  Firstly, it's a stones-throw from the open kitchen.  While this may not actually BE unsanitary, it sure SEEMS unsanitary.  BUT...I do wonder if this set-up inspires more people who wouldn't otherwise wash their hands after going to do so.  Secondly, vanity is a thing best enjoyed in private.  Patching-up-around-the-seams isn't something ladies like to do in front of a decent portion of the dining room and any guys coming out of the guy's loo.  But, since it seems that no one comes to this restaurant, I guess it doesn't really matter that much.",0.9993,0.723,0.23,0.047,0.5488310948310949
2008-08-24,2.0,"I went to Blu Coral last night on the strength of the Yelp reviews, it being one of three sushi bars in my neighborhood that had four stars, and I had been to the other two, Bob San, which I love, and Mirai, which I'll never go back to.   Sad to say, Blu Coral is much more Mirai than it is Bob San.   When we walked in the hostess/waitress ignored us for a good 30 seconds after coldly asking if we had made a reservation, despite the place being mostly empty.  Once we got seated, and she started waiting our table, the ice queen routine just kept going, with her really pushing the drink menu (we had ridden our bikes, so we weren't going to have any alcohol), and seeming disappointed that we weren't ordering more.   Ironically, we did end up ordering a second course of sushi because everything we got was so small that the first order wasn't enough!  The worst was the tuna Nigiri, which was about half the width of the Nigiri I've had elsewhere, and cost the same $3 that I'd pay for a normal sized one.  Also, the $8-10 specialty rolls that we ordered came in five smallish pieces, instead of the usual six.   The entire time we were there (which was quite a long time, as the service was slow and we ordered twice) I felt uncomfortable, like our waitress would have preferred were weren't there, despite most of the tables being empty.  The one shining light of the service was the rather punk looking latina busgirl who refilled our waters and was actually friendly.  I think we must not have passed the shmancy-looks test or something with our waitress.

Beautiful bathroom and minimalist chic throughout. Place was full of patrons but not ridiculously crowded. 2) Service- I had a few friends that were sushi veterans and some friends that were not as adventurous. The waiter was friendly, funny, and able to explain everything on the menu from the taste of sea urchin to details on all the specialty rolls.    3) Menu- Selection of traditional and non-traditional sushi was huge, and I liked that there was a wide selection of dishes for people that weren't really into sushi.  4) Quality of Food- Yes, I have had better sushi (Momotaro) but I thought the quality here (including tuna and oysters) was still very good.    5) Price- We were able to bring bottles of wine for a corkage fee of $10 a bottle. It's high but way cheaper than buying wine at the restaurant. As a result, six people had an awesome meal and drinks for only $150 for the total bill.

2008-05-07,3.0,"Blu Coral is one of those trendy places when you want to look cute while sampling mediocre sushi. Overall this place is an all-show-no-go place. We all had a nice time here but were definitely left underwhelmed by Blu Coral.   Came here a few weeks ago with friends from out of town. One of which is a chef in Detroit. We were seated and waited 20 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order. She was a doll but completely absent minded the entire evening. The drinks then did not make an appearance for another 15 minutes.  Appetizers sampled was the shumai with pork which was average, calamari, shitake mushroom salad and seaweed salad were good yet still not terribly impressive. The edamame was overdone which is just not okay.   The nigiri was really fresh and perhaps the saving grace of the meal.   We had great difficulty finding a good maki which included, pink Cadillac, urban heat, red dragon, flaming hamachi.  We wanted really spicy with great kick and none of these delivered. Seven bridge was the most unique flavor and would order again. My chef friend spoke to the waitress and designed a maki that they made for us which was amazing.  Really that alone gives this place the three opposed to two stars for their willingness to give us exactly what we wanted.  For the amount of money dropped at this place, you shouldn't have to design your own maki in order to be wowed, not just satisfied. The scene is pretty dope, and oh wow, the tiling in the bathroom is amazing.

We arrived on time and sat immediately in a half full dining room.  The menu was a bit overwhelming, but was loaded with dishes and rolls that sounded great.  We started with 3 pieces of super white and 3 pieces of hamachi nigiri.  The super white and yellowtail were fresh, delicious, and melted in your mouth.  Honestly, some of the best fish I have had in Chicago.  After our nibblers, a precession of specialty maki made it's way to our table.  We had the Seven Bridge, Red Dragon, Pink Cadillac, Flaming Hamachi, White Sox (Go Sox!), and the Totoro Kani.  Every roll we had was solid.  We only ordered specialty maki for some reason, so the rolls were a bit pricey, but well worth it.  The Totoro Kani was hand downs the show stopper.  Blue Crab on the inside topped with Spicey Tuna.  It sounds simple and uninspired but the flavors combination work really well.  Another nice thing was that a lot of the rolls we ordered had unique ingredients or presentation that made sushi exciting again for me.  One roll was topped with minced strawberries, apples, and pears and another was plated on top of a plate coated in a light citrus sauce.  The fish was so good in fact that we ended up ordering more super white,  hamachi, and a final Totoro Kani roll.  Very good sushi! The service was great.  The perfect balance of giving us our own space and being attentive made for a great evening.  Our server gave us her recommendations and they all went over well, including a great bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. The interior design was modern with a heavy dose of metal.  I give Blue Coral credit for not doing the typical concrete floors, white walls, and minimal design, but for me the decor was a miss.  On the other hand, you can't eat the interior design. All in all we had a great experience.  The sushi was some of the best we have had in Chicago.  It's definitely not your everyday sushi joint, but we will for sure be heading back. 3 miso soups 1 edamame 10 pieces of nigiri 7 rolls 1 bottle of wine --------------------------- $189",0.9992,0.736,0.253,0.01,0.5382949735449737

2007-10-07,4.0,"My favorite place for sushi for years has been Blue Fin, but Blu Coral is giving them a run for their money.  Last night my finance and I were in the mood for sushi and decided to give Blu Coral a go. We didn't make reservations, it was early, 6 pm and there were plenty of tables. We were both wearing jeans and tshirts, and there seemed to be plenty of others dressed that way too. People were dressed anywhere from casual to semi-formal (but it was early on in the evening so maybe it gets more formal as the night goes on). The Ultra Mod decor of Blu Coral gives it a more fancy vibe then Blue Fin. We both started with a martini while we looked over the menu. There martini list is great. ""The Ginger"" martini goes great with sushi and ""The Aloe"" is a very refreshing and clean drink. I personally felt that each martini we tried were better then Blue Fin's. Enough about the drinks, onto the food. The maki list was amazing! The combinations they offer beat any sushi place I have ever been to. They were all very creative.   My biggest gripe with Blu Coral is there ""Super White Tuna"" was awful. We tried it in the Tuna Sampler and on the roll called the ""White Sox"" both times it didn't melt in your mouth like  ""Super White Tuna"" should. This made both of us think that maybe it wasn't fresh and sort of made the other fish questionable. Perhaps this isn't a good time of year for ""Super White Tuna"" I'm not too sure. This is the reason I can only give them 4 stars. If someone was to suggest Sushi for dinner I would probably want to go to Blu Coral, there is  a lot of seating, creative food, good martinis and wonderful service.",0.9949,0.767,0.183,0.05,0.5566816816816816

2007-08-16,4.0,"The food and service were both fine. The fish was fresh and tasty enough, didn't give me a boner or nuthin. The atmosphere, however, was goofy enough to make me no want to go back. It's all done up in black and brushed stainless and mirrored surfaces and ""industrial minimalism"" and such corniness, it's like they took every tired idea of what a ""hep"" restaurant should look like, and threw it all together. You know how you sometimes go into a place and laugh and say, ""oh my god, it's soooo 1995 in here""? I went into Blu Coral and said, ""oh my god, it's soooo 2006 in here."" It just seems outdated already. The food is good, but there are a billion sushi joints in the neighborhood, and I prefer to go to ones that are a little less ostentatious.

2007-07-29,3.0,"This is another one of those places that might require a few attempts to figure out.  The sushi was good but nothing knocked my socks off- we tried the ocean drive, as well as a california roll and unagi (my sister is a sushi novice and I was trying to give her a taste of a few different basics!).  The great thing about this place is the extensive menu- there is just about every combination of fish in the rolls that you can think of, which I like, although it made it tough to decide! The martinis were heavenly- small list, but I had the asian frog and my sister had a chocolate one and we were both very very happy!  The outdoor seating could use some work- with a little atmosphere I'd definitely come back because they have a lot of tables out there and its not right on the street but rather off to the side in what is basically the alley. So right now its kind of blah- but with a little landscaping and lighting could be really nice! The bathrooms are a little bizarre and I found it to be off-putting that there was just a curtain separating the sinks from the dining area. Something about that seems yucky to me. Plus come on, what ladies want to share the mirror space with the men!  Worth a shot if you are in the area, but it definitely needs work!",0.9883,0.799,0.163,0.038,0.47339544513457554

Very pricey.  Probably will never come here again, except maybe for cocktails, even though location and parking are both convenient.  Better choices not too far away (Butterfly, Bob San's, Mirai).",0.8582,0.889,0.101,0.011,0.48333333333333334

I'd just had Kaze earlier this week, so Blu Coral had alot to live up to.  It failed. I felt the sushi was just average ( and the prices are average as well). I really felt the nigri ( always wanna say the N-word, but i dont) was really TOO warm, like slightly warmer then room temperature. This came me a  slight concern! The Maki was just okay ( but well priced for being average). I didnt order the house special maki ,because well....it scarred me. There seemed to be way too much going on. ""Fancy or Special "" does not mean a shitload of different fish and incredients to me. I did see some other tables get them and the rolls looked much larger then the regular rolls.  I think the real special thing about Blu Coral will be their hot  ""kitchen"" menu.

The place gets 2 stars for food, but I'm adding a star for the cool atmosphere and good service.  It's hard for my boyfriend and I to go eat sushi together.. he likes the trendy rolls with cream cheese that are deep friend whereas I prefer a place with incredibly fresh high quality fish. Blu Coral pleased neither one of us.  The fish was not fresh. The menu of rolls was large, but none of the four we tried were good. The prices were up there for low quality fish. The spicy tuna was among the worst I've had... ever... it was VERY mushy, and smelled really gross. Not sure how you make fish that soft or nasty.  My search for good sushi in Chicago will continue.. hopefully I find something soon!

2007-05-24,2.0,"Hmm...after reading everyone's reviews, I'm a bit surprised.  Although the decor was very mod and the libations were excellent (the asian frog & peach martini were delicious), I can't really say that the food was up to par with the the decor and beverages. We started with crab cakes and edamame.  How can you go wrong with ordering these, right?  Well, the edamame was overcooked (is that even possible to do?), and the crab cakes were too moist to the point that they just fell apart when we tried to split them.  The spicy tuna roll was way too spicy for my taste.  The Snake Eye (f.w. eel over snow crab) was good, but nothing spectacular.  The Caterpillar roll had way too much avocado.  The best I can say is that the sushi was mediocre.",0.8862,0.89,0.096,0.015,0.6468367346938776
2007-05-07,5.0,"I've fallen in love with this restaurant.  My bf surprised me with dinner here on a Friday night.  Although new, it got pretty busy after 9 PM, and street parking wasn't difficult to find.  The decor is right on the money for a swanky date.  I did not feel overdressed in a dress and heels, although jeans are perfectly acceptable.  Check out their website ( blucoralsushi.com ) for photos. Their menu is rather extensive; you can easily sit there for 10 minutes reading through it all your first time.  Our waiter (Devin) had a great personality, was attentive, very knowledgable, and had great suggestions.  I definitely recommend getting a specialty or signature maki.  They have some unique combinations.  My bf loved the Octo, which is spicy salmon over spicy octopus.  It was on fire!  You also must try their desserts.  We had the Chocolate Tartuffo, which was a large scoop of chocolate gelato with zambaglione cream in the center; not too rich, not too creamy.  Try their martinis too (Ecstasy and Asian Pear were my faves) - they come in a V-shaped glass held by a small fishbowl looking glass with ice water so that your drink isn't watered down by the ice (psst - I've seen these at Crate & Barrel, but we won't tell). Although pricey, it was a splendid treat for the great food, service, and intimacy you get.  Our bill was ~$120 before tip for 2 appetizers, 2 pieces of toro (they were CHUNKS!), 3 rolls, 1 dessert, and 4 drinks.",0.9857,0.821,0.158,0.021,0.6156815406815407

The menu has way too much good stuff to choose from, regular maki menu ($4-6), specialty maki menu ($8-12), and blu coral signature maki menu ($14-18).  We tried the salmon obsession, rainbow-dragon, white dragon, and white sox....WOW and YUM!!!!  super good and perfectly spicy.

The sushi was delicious...I'm standing by Kaze as the best sushi in Chicago, but sign me up for some raw fish at Blu Coral anytime.  I had my eye on the crab cake appetizer, but my boyfriend was feeling adventurous and wanted to start with something else since we ALWAYS get the crab cakes.  Instead we started with the seared scallops (not sure if this was adventurous since we always order scallops as well, but they sure were good) and our usual seaweed salad.   We ordered 3 specialty rolls for our main course- the wasabi eel, the ocean drive, and the spicy tataki.  All of them were fabulous, but my favorite was the spicy tataki while my boyfriend couldn't get enough of the wasabi eel. I noticed the rest of our party had cleaned their plates as well by the end of the meal so I think the sushi was a hit for all. One of the more sober and mathematical savvy members of our party said that it's a better deal (for the size of the rolls) to go with the specialty maki over the normal maki.  I didn't notice a size difference since we ordered all specialty rolls being the special people that we are, but figured this may be of interest to future Blu Coral diners.
