2013-09-12,4.0,"What drew me in to La Bocca Della Verita was the cash special. Yup. The $9.95 pastas and $20 bottles of wine were enough to pique my interest. Sadly, the house-made (!) stuffed pastas aren't included in the deal, so it was a good thing we had the reasonably priced wine. The $20 wines cover a pretty wide variety; you're not stuck with a generic/unidentifiable ""red"" or ""white.""  The dining partner and I went for the stuffed pastas. This was a very wise decision. He got the famous duck breast ravioli and I got the veal tortellini. Wow. The veal tortellini in meat sauce was, well, meaty. Itt was plenty rich, although the tomato sauce and parmesan cheese on top provided a nice counterpoint to the meatiness. The duck ravioli were little short of incredible, or at least, the one bite that the boyfriend spared me was. The sage offsets the richness of the duck SO well, and the sauce is so good he just about cleaned his plate. In general, the pastas melt in your mouth.  Service was a little lacking, and the atmosphere was alright. It definitely took quite some time for our food to come out, and the bread, despite being tasty and served warm, could only hold us over for so long.  At first, the waitress was very prompt and involved, but disappeared as the meal progressed.  In terms of atmosphere, points for use of fresh flowers. There was some soft music in the background all night, mostly classical (the kinda typical Italian-American restaurant stuff) with one funky bass song that played once in a while.

It was nicely breaded, perfectly cooked and tender. A bonus of piping hot bread was thrown in with my order.

The meal was fantastic, his attentiveness continued throughout the meal.  We were there for a very long time talking, but they never made us feel pressured to leave.  This place is great!  The portions are big enough that we both had leftovers, but not giant and gross amounts of food.  If you want a giant plate of nasty pasta that you pay $8 for, go to The Olive Garden.  This place makes really high quality food at a reasonable price.  We couldn't have found everyone to the restaurant nicer, and that has been true every time I have been in there.   One time, I was there on a date here years ago and we closed the place...and they never kicked us out..they told us to keep talking as they were cleaning up!  But more amazing than that was that it had started to POUR outside while we were inside.  So we left and we standing outside under their awning waiting for the rain to die down so we could walk.  Someone from the restaurant came out and gave us one of their umbrellas and just told us to bring it back!  Seriously!!!!!?????  You couldn't ask for nicer people.

2012-06-15,1.0,"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had: 1)  It is not ok to offer your guests the option to have the kitchen split the two dishes they are going to share without telling them that you will charge them a per person splitting charge 2) It is not ok to bring out all but 2 people's food, and then make the remaining two wait for almost 30 minutes for their pizzas to be ready (except for cases when the pizza will truly take an extra 30 minutes to cook).  Further, if it becomes obvious that your oven is not working properly (which we eventually learned was the case last night - I'm sorry, how does the explanation that the chef kept opening the oven and letting the heat out even make sense??), offer your guests the option to cancel their order and order something else; do not disappear for so long that one of the guests has to get up and find you after 10 minutes to see what is going on, and do not promise that it will ""just be a few more minutes"" over the course of the next 20 minutes. 3) It is not ok to start arguing with your guests when they refuse the dessert/limencello you offered rather than offering to just comp the two pizzas. It was late and we just wanted to leave. 4) It is not ok to charge a party of 5 gratuity because the waitress is likely scared she will not get a tip otherwise, since she knew how annoyed we were.  Last time I checked, restaurants do not charge gratuity to parties less than 6.

The place started getting busy -- not out the door busy -- but most tables were occupied. Their drink order went in and our food orders did, too.  And then came the wait.  You kinda knew it was going to be a problem as you saw a waiter give a free dessert to another table as a reward for their patience (that's the other 1/2 star).  But 20 minutes later and the new drink orders had yet to arrive. We flagged down the hostess as our waiter was not around.  When our waiter came by about 10 minutes later he informed my wife that they were out of what she ordered. So, 30 minutes in they discover this problem. Timely. About 20 minutes later the food arrives.  All would have been forgiven, but....  My wife's dish, the replacement ravioli, had one flavor to the sauce, green peppers. My lasagna, the special, had another singular flavor -- salt. And the pasta for all dishes was as firm as Chef Boyardee.  On the bright side, the portions were small -- 8 regular sized raviolis for my wife. With the peppers-only flavored sauce and good spacing, this was just enough to layer a dinner plate.

No, this place is like an Italian chef's dining room...eclectic and used and inviting. Not chic but who cares, if the food delivers!

What more could you want?  So many places torture their ingredients just for the sake of innovation, but that doesn't impress me. Good, flavorful ingredients do. My husband had the spaghetti carbonara and they do it right. No cream...just pecorino, egg yolk, parmesan, and guanicale (cured pig jowls!).  C'mon! Let me preface this next section by saying I don't like salads. I hate them. I find them insipid. And yes, the menu does include the obligatory spring mix salad  which my husband had and loved (greens, pears, mascarpone, balsamic reduction, etc.)...ok, sounds nice, tasted fine.  But I ate something I've never, in all my travels and meals, before encountered...the Arugula and Anchovy Salad. It seems like the kind of salad that would be common in country Italian restaurants and family meals, but it was new to me. And it's now my all-time favorite salad. It was salty and smokey and garlicky...and oh, sooooo good. I will go back just for this salad and I can't believe I'm even saying this. It's so frickin' simple...again, why I love this resto. The salad was a small pile of arugula with teeny pieces of anchovies that frankly, I couldn't even see...and oil and vinegar. And it tasted fantastic. I love that they even had this on the menu.  I mean...who even orders this??   To wrap it up...order appropriate items (ie: don't get tomato items (bruscetta or caprese) off-season) and you'll have a great, neighborhod meal.",0.9983,0.701,0.246,0.054,0.6032450353878925

Our waitress brought crayons and invited our son to draw on the white paper covering the table, and she was speedy in bringing him an order of pasta. There were plenty of other families enjoying dinner in one of the three rooms that make up this inimate restaurant, and you half expect an Italian grandmother to come walking out of the kitchen to greet you. The bread was crusty and straight from the oven. My husband ordered the pear salad, which was a large side salad (enough for two people) with dressing that was a little too acidic. We also got the prosciutto and melon, which was fine. I had the ravioli special -- three kinds of mushrooms in a white wine sauce with truffle oil. It was large portion and very tasty, though the oil was a little overpowering; I would have liked a bit more mushroom. My husband had the spaghetti carbonara, which was fantastic. The pasta was delicious and perfectly cooked and the flavor was smoky. Since we had both filled up on salads and bread we had plenty to take home, and I almost ""accidentally"" took his leftovers for my lunch this morning.

My hubby & I planned a nice laid back date night out for Tuesday since we had been so busy lately.  I called to make a reservation earlier in the day and requested the patio, which I was told was no problem.  We were both coming from work & I arrived first.  I went inside &  there was a guy behind the counter talking to another guy.  He asked if he could help me & I told him I had a reservation.  ""For 2?"" Yes, I said.  ""Go ahead & sit anywhere. Someone will be right there.""  I went out to find one table left (no ""reserved"" sign or anything) that was mostly shoved into the potted plant behind it.  I scooted it out a bit, but was limited by a potted plant on 2 sides & another occupied table on the other.  It wasn't great, but at least I wasn't sitting in the plant.  And I waited.  And waited.  I thought maybe they were waiting for both of us to be present, but thought it was odd they hadn't brought menus or water.  About 5-6 minutes it, water arrived.  Then my husband arrived.  We waited another 7 minutes (which I know because I made a call right as my husband arrived).  Bus boys & servers waited on those around us, but no one came to our table.   Finally, I suggested we go.  Husband agreed.  First, though, I went in to tell them we were leaving and why.  At that point a woman saying she was the hostess asked if she could help.  I said ""I wanted to let you know I was leaving because I've been sitting out there over 10 minutes without even getting menus.""  She says ""DId you tell anyone you were here?""  I explained that I had & she apologized profusely, said there must have been a mistake, and said she'd have someone help us right away if I would stay.  I felt uncomfortable about it, but agreed.  We sat back down, she brought menus, and...no on ever came by.  We gave it several more minutes of our lives and no one even approached for a drink order.  My husband asked if they were ignoring us because we complained.  He felt the attitude of the staff was to punish us--which is surprising coming from him because he's super laid back & thinks the best about everyone to an annoyng degree.   Anyway, we left & had a really delicious dinner at Trullo down the street.  And we had attentive service!",0.3073,0.798,0.099,0.103,0.44962462462462466

See, the Italian stuff is a lot lighter flavored and smaller.  And that pretty much describes this place's stab at the dish.  The pomodoro sauce it comes in here is tomatoey, rich, robust, and filling.  I quite enjoyed dipping the bread in it.  But as far as the potato dumplings, I was left very disappointed with their lack of flavor unique from the sauce since they were $15!  The plate, however, was full of them which was a definite plus.  I don't think many people leave this full portioned place hungry. In fact, other than my unfortunate discovery, the experience was wonderful.  The thick bread and oil were brilliant.  The miniature menus are darling and the decor is so romantic that I felt guilty treating myself to a pre-birthday dinner there (and stealing the possible experience from some imaginary else). If I ever do find reason (and income) to come back, however, it will be for their gelato.  I figured out where the slightly missing flavor from my gnocchi went - straight into the dessert.  My giant vanilla gelato was pure sweetness right down to the cookie sticks.  And at $5.00, unlike my gnocchi, this felt like a bargain. I think I'll need to give it another try with a different pasta when I visit Chicago in the future.  Since I can't, obviously, rate it on my hated gnocchi.",0.9031,0.701,0.158,0.142,0.5623057820732239

That being said we went to La Bocca Della Verita on a fairly slow Sunday night. Service: I have read some reviews that say the service was not great, but this was not the case for us. Our server acknowledged us right after we sat down and said he would bring some warm bread over. He was very attentive, but also not too obtrusive throughout the meal. Everything we ordered arrived at perfect timing, he even made our espressos at the bar after our meal and let us cash out there so we could make it to the movie next door.  Wine: We got a bottle of pinot noir that was surprisingly good, because obviously you should probably be ordering a bottle of Italian wine.  Food: The bread is right out of the oven and delicious; Appetizer prosciutto and melon. Three large pieces of each, it is exactly what you would expect; we split the walnut, pear and mascarpone salad. It was perfect for the two of us to share. Once again what you would expect. Now the reason I would come back to this place again. I had the Gnocchetti Ai Formaggi which from the menu is a homemade spinach-potato dumplings, sautéed in cream sauce, blue cheese, mascarpone, Parmigianino cheese.  This dish is so amazing. It is the perfect portion too. It is so rich you don't need too much. I like to try new things when I go back to restaurants, but when I go back here I will definitely order this again, it is that good.  My wife got Spaghetti Putanesca  and also loved it.  Bottom line: This was a perfect place to go before catching a movie next door. From the attentive service, to the owner letting us try her new recipe for bread. The blue cheese gnocchi was fantastic and the other fair was worthy. The price was reasonable as well.

Sinful because I had hopes in mind of a lighter, healthier meal before I caught a movie next door at the Davis. But with the torrential downpour outside, I couldn't do much browsing on Lincoln for a place to eat. So this place was convenient and looked cozy.  I felt like I was sitting down at an Italian grandmother's kitchen table. The outdated decor was actually cute and endearing. Our server did as much as he needed to do, nothing special there. I knew I was in trouble when the piping hot bread came to our table and our bread plates were filled with olive oil and perfectly shaved parmesan. I could eat that and drink wine all night. No joke. I ordered the Carpaccio app which was served with sliced raw beef fillet, parmigiano cheese,mushrooms, capers, extra virgin olive oil. The addition of the capers on this plate was nice. The beef didn't have a ton of flavor I thought, but the cheese was very good. Then as I was browsing the entrees I noticed that some of the 'lighter' items (dover sole or sea bass) were a lot more than i wanted to spend for a casual dinner- as in $32. So I turned back to the pasta page and just committed to eating a 'sinful' amount of cream and cheese and heavy pasta. And let me tell you, they put the ""carb' in Carbonara people. The little chucks of homemade smoked Italian bacon mixed with the egg yolk and blend of Italian cheeses was to die for.  It was crunchy and salty and the balance of the Pecorino and lovely homemade noodles was quite delicious.

The house bread they serve is also quite good and fresh. But, the duck ravioli was overcooked, and the veal saltimbocca was actually well flavored, but after a while I felt like I needed to drink a gallon of water because it was so salty. Again, pretty average italian. The price is not average. It's way up there. Our plates averaged about $18 each. See, I wouldn't have a problem paying for well prepared Italian food. But there were certain points where I said to myself that Maggiano's makes better food than they do, and the veal saltimbocca at the hole-in-the-wall place across the street from where I live is way better, comes with more sides, and is $10 cheaper!

2008-10-27,4.0,"Whenever I look at a plate of gnocchi, with its coating of sauce and little shavings of parmesan, I can't help but thinking of its actual value (about $1.25?) and its remarkable profit margin in most Italian joints. I just have this feeling that won't go away that no pasta dish, anywhere, should cost more than, say, $7-8.00, especially if it has no meat or fancy mushrooms in it. But, I guess, if you have to pay for three dining rooms, all that art and all those ceramic pitchers, the pin-spot lighting, and fresh flowers, you just have to charge a little more for the pasta! I finally had the opportunity to try the Bocca with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening. The ambiance is inviting, and cozy and intimate with the separate rooms. We three dudes were whisked off to the last (and empty) room, making us wonder if we were under-dressed, or exuding some unpleasant odor. When we looked around the room, we were also at the only table without fresh flowers. Were they concerned that our halitosis might kill the fresh-cut flowers?. After reassurances from our very knowledgeable and courteous server that this was not the case, we moved on for the kill. First, the appetizer of fresh figs, prosciutto, and goat cheese very beautifully presented, and a salad ""misto"" of mixed greens with deliciously ripe and luscious small tomatoes nicely plated around the greens. The flavors of the appetizer melded perfectly. The textures were pleasing to the palate. The salad was tasty, but the dressing was just a bit heavy on the dark balsamic vinegar. But not over-dressed. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay de Puglia (the Italian birthplace of the pug :-). It was from ""Natural Merchants"", a distributor of organic wines. This was a very pleasing wine, and unique from other Chardonnays I've had. A golden color with green nuances. Straight forward and well balanced, with a finish of fresh fruit and grass, and a little bit peppery, per Doug. And that's a quality you usually only find with reds. On to the entrees: Duck Ravioli pour moi, Spaghetti Carbonara (at my urging) for Dan, and that high-as-a-hot-dog-in-profit-margin gnocchi with marinara for Doug. Of course we all traded tastes, too. My ravioli was in a Vodka sauce, and was very fresh and delish. The Carbonara had huge chunks of bacon or pork and was mouth-watering. The gnocchi was tender and full of flavor, but Doug felt there was not enough of it. An unusual occurrence in most Italian joints in Chicago, but I had to agree. All of our portions were moderate, and we all cleaned our plates. (So I'm guessing they don't spend a lot on doggie bags.) Overall, Bocca was a fresh, flavorful and classy Italian experience for us. With all the great Italian choices in town, its hard to frequent just one. But I'm sure we will repeat  this neighborhood treat! Thanks again, Dan!",0.9981,0.754,0.198,0.048,0.5565412186379926

I find that really annoying.  The place looks nice enough, and the soft warm roll with the high quality olive oil on the table bode well to begin our dining experience. We didn't have ridiculous expectations, but we were excited to have stumbled upon what looks like a sweet little neighborhood bistro.  The service was terrible. The waiter was nice enough, but clearly overwhelmed, literally running back and forth to cover all his tables, passing us by every time, not giving us any chance to speak up if we needed something. That was bad enough, but he also assumed that we didn't know anything about food, and his condescending attitude was a little embarrassing. The appetizer (baked scallops in a white wine sauce) we ordered was very saucy, and we needed a little more bread to sop up the sauce (this was the best thing we ordered, though the scallops were a little over cooked). The waiter asked us if we wanted more bread, and we said yes. We waited for over 15 minutes before I had get up and go ask someone for more bread. The bus boy was hovering and just dying to take away our plate before we had the chance to sop up the sauce. When the bread finally did come, it was warmish in the outside, and cold on the inside. Very frustrating. We ordered duck ravioli for our main course, which sounded great. The ravioli is supposedly hand made fresh, and how can you go wrong with duck?

I pondered what to get... looking over the menu... mouth starting to water... ""Ohh that looks good.... mmm salmon... duck stuffed ravioli? Daaaammmmn...""  I settled on the gnocchi al pomodoro, you basic gnocchi in tomato sauce, pollo campagnola and an order of tiramisu. The gnocchi were lovely. Not light and fluffy, but a little more firm and with substance, but not heavy when bitten in to. The red sauce was a little sweet, but not over powering and still tasty. I was really a. happy they gave me bread to polish off the sauce, b. really happy I was at home, no one can see you lick the sauce off of the plate when you are home alone. I do have to say I thought I was a little disappointed about the portion size... ten minutes later my stomach was pleasently full. Not before I tried the chicken. Chicken breast pounded flat, seasoned with thyme, black olives, tomatoes, roasted potatoes and um did someone say garlic? The undead won't be bothering you later on... I only had a few bites so I could get a sense of the dish and not stuff myself silly. The chicken was tender, the flavors nice and of course a good amount of garlic. That will be good later tonight..

Service was a bit slow, and our server seemed kind of spacey. She was nice enough, just a little flaked-out. We had the bruschetta to start, and it was quite good. Very garlicky and peppery. I liked that. Our main courses were also tasty--maybe not the best Italian I've ever had, but I'd go back. Our table had the ravioli, pesto special and the spaghetti. The sauces were full of flavor, though pretty simple. The pesto could have used something more, but I'm not sure what.

Extremely neutral attitude from waiter, sat us in the back. Two guys from another table walking out, to us: ""Go somewhere else. Seriously. Don't stay here."" Curiousity! Well, oh my, how bad can it be? Fresh bread! Oohhh. Only olive oil on the table, though. No offer of balsamic from neutralman. Perhaps the other two guys had the same problem but verbalized their desire and luckily had left a jar of vinegar on their table. Just sneak that over here... much better. No wine tonight, thank you, on the wagon for a few, only some sodas and some food.  Average time later, food arrives as do unsolicited soda refills. So far so good. No offer for fresh cheese or pepper on pastas.  Just slow down sliding from there. Our food was ... well... I had a salmon pasta thing and my buddy had some... I dunno, some pasta. He said his was okay. Mine was not very good, and had obviously been reheated as the middle was cold and the outside was hothothot. A bit flavorless, but that coulda been average for whatever I ordered.  Some other people had arrived in the interum and had requested some tasty water. When the waiter spotted a waitress with the aquajug he promised she would fulfill their wishes. She did not, and they had to re-ask when the waiter sauntered back.  More refills of our soda and eventually the bill, which was a bit high.

Either way, you are treated to friendly service. The food is solid. My rigatoni with eggplant in a tomato sauce was fantastic, with just a tiny edge of heat. The eggplant is baked, not fried, which I greatly appreciated. Rafe's lemon sole was also tasty, although the sauce was a little creamy for my taste.

The restaurant has a pretty big space right next to the Davis Theater but is broken up into three rooms which helps to make it feel smaller and gives it a comfortable and intimate vibe.  The rooms have big windows that face Lincoln Avenue.  The restaurant also has outdoor seating in front of the restaurant when weather permits.

That's something that can really put me off quickly. Anyway, it took over an hour to get our food. From what I understand were not hard dishes to prepare (my friends had pasta dishes...without meat...and mine was a chicken dish with roasted potatoes).  The dishes looked great when they came out, but sadly it was Less then desirable. My chicken was great, but you could tell all the dishes had been sitting for a while.

2007-04-26,4.0,"One of my girlfriends and I met here for dinner last night to catch up on gossip.  It's been years since I've been to this little Italian joint, and this place is still as quaint and charming as ever.  It's in the heart of Lincoln Square near Chicago Brauhaus.  This place is casual - don't wear a suit, fancy dress or heels or you might feel a little outta place.  Okay, so it's not the place you propose to your girlfriend or announce that you are retiring.  But it is a great place to hang out with your pals, reconnect with old friends, and even have a nice casual date with someone you want to get to know better.  It is a very good choice. The waitstaff was very good, kinda quirky, but attentive and prompt.  The bread...oh my...the warm bread...well if you're on that South Beach diet, you might as well kick that diet to the curb for awhile because the smell of that yeasty bread (okay, maybe yeasty does not sound like a very delicious word) will cause you to have a nervous carb breakdown.  What is it about warm, fresh-out-of-the-oven bread?  I ate the Ravioli Valles (kind of a spicy ravioli with jalapenos, and it really was not that spicy, but it was tasty), and my friend ate the chicken scaloppine, i believe.  We both enjoyed our dinners along with our house salad, which has a very light Italian dressing.  (The dressing could use a little more flavor, I think, as it was a bit bland of a house salad). We didn't drink since the next day (today) was a 'school' night, but they had a nice little wine menu, too. Note -- while it is true that this place gets supercrowded on the weekends, it's ""just right"" on a Wednesday night.  Still, it's a good idea to make reservations...just in case.

I could have made it at home (but I would probably have added some salt & pepper...). The Bocca Bruschetta was okay - the portabella was small and had a weird texture, like it had sat out for a while.  In fact, everything seemed pre-made and not fresh at all, which is my biggest dining turnoff, especially at small mom&pop places. The duck ravioli was bland, and while the pasta seemed fresh, the filling popped out in one lump. It was chewy, like pre-packaged ravioli you can get at the grocery store, yuck! For $16, what is that!? I did not detect any sage, either.  Also, it's nothing special to look at. I hate to sound stuck-up--it is quaint and full of regulars--but the flowered tablecloths were an eyesore, and the random vintage deco just really didn't do it for me. I didn't even notice it, though, until I got my food and was like, ""What is this?!"" ...and then I started to look around.  Finally, the desserts all sounded great and I was excited to try them. However, the gelato ""sundae"" was missing the amaretto cookie, and the texture of the gelato was unappealing. It tasted like it had been melted and then re-frozen (you know, like when you forget to put your groceries away, and your Haagen-Das melts, but you stick it in the freezer anyway, and try to eat it later but it's all icky). Also, the mascarpone-caramel-brittle thing was too cold and hard, it only softened by the last two bites.  I really wanted to like this place, you guys.
