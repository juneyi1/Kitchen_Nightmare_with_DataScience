2007-08-04,4.0,"When I lived in Lincoln Park I went to this place a lot because they have really good sandwiches.  Some of the baked goods are o.k., but nothing to write home about.  The last time I was there, the owner mentioned that they were going to open a location in Wicker Park. He was always nice to me and even gave me a few freebies every now and then.  But I did see him treat the staff like crap on more than one occassion.  He'd be really rude and condescending to them for no apparent reason.  I was always surprised none of them quit on the spot because he'd yell at them in front of customers often.  It was kind of a pain in the butt that the only took cash too.",0.2772,0.768,0.127,0.106,0.6097222222222223
2007-02-27,1.0,"I agree with JJS, he bounced 3 checks to the Alliance Bakery and still hasn't paid them back yet. Boo to businesses that don't pay their bills! AN update An employee, not the owner (who refuses to return our calls or get on the phone when we call) phoned the Alliance Bakery today threatening us because we posted this information with legal action We've been trying to a week and a half to get Michael on the phone and keeps pushing back paying us and he's threatening us? And to think he's going to be opening a store in Wicker Park soon",-0.5853,0.881,0.051,0.068,0.09333333333333334
2007-01-16,1.0,Let me tell you something people. I've known 3 people who worked there and this place is sketch. The owner calls his employees profanities. Everything is done illegally under the table. The food is moldy and old and  definitly not organic. The owner is a bit of a nutjob. Enough said.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.39999999999999997
2006-11-15,1.0,"This could be a really cute new addition to the neighborhood. I live about 5 feet from here so I decided to pop in today to get some breakfast. They had fresh english muffins, so I ordered one with butter and rasberry jelly - simple but delicious. Plus, the girl working there was really nice.  However...I went here again and the owner must have been there (Michael?) and he was ordering around the person who was trying to help me and I didn't like it. Also I ordered a hot chocolate and it was really bad. Like, horrible. And I went in another time to get some Homer's Ice Cream and the girl wanted to give it to me in a chinese take-out container. And they don't seem to keep consistent hours. After reading the reviews from ex-employees on here and on centerstage I do not think I will ever go back here again.",0.7354,0.799,0.122,0.079,0.5413110698824986
2006-11-12,4.0,"I think this is a cute little bakery and coffee shop. Its a nice alternative to starbuck's. They have interesting items on the menu and it has a pleasant atmosphere. Although I haven't tried the bagels, I have heard that they are new york bagels.  The prices are a little high but would reccommend it to others.",0.7096,0.853,0.147,0.0,0.6826515151515151
2006-08-14,4.0,"Yum...  I love this relatively new spot for lunch!  The food is very well-prepared and fresh, and I think they use all organic/macrobiotic products.  The sandwiches are delicious, with my favorites being the grilled chicken with avocado and lemon vinaigrette, caprese on french, and the egg salad on wheat.  They also serve a very nice fruit salad as a side to all their sandwich orders.  The chocolates and desserts are delicious (great cookies), and I always get the Homer's ice cream on my way out. They get four stars because they only accept cash, which I never have on me.",0.9718,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.6867768595041323
