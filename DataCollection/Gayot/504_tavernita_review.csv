The gnocchi was way too rich and one bite was all that was possible. The meatballs were overdone and encrusted in an alfredo sauce. The most disappointing was the halibut. You could tell it was a great piece of fish but was so over cooked we had to send it back. The only redeeming quality was the hamachi.

2014-07-19,3.0,"The food was very good, but I didn't love this place. My biggest issue is the way the menu works - everyone had to order the same thing to share. When I think of small plates and tapas style food, I think of ordering a bunch of different dishes, sharing, and trying things I might not have ordered otherwise. I came for a work dinner, and it was a group of 9 of us. All 9 of us had to agree on what to order. It wasn't too difficult, but it meant that were a lot of menu items I would have liked to try that we didn't get to order. As I mentioned already, the food was very good. The gnocchi was out of this world. The scallops were near perfect, and the butternut squash puree that was served with it was heaven. The sides - spiced fries and balsamic mushrooms - were okay. The fries were nothing special at all. The desserts were amazing - especially the brownie. The service was okay. It was a little slow, and looking back, I'm not sure we received all of our dishes. The atmosphere was good. It was trendy but didn't feel overly pretentious. The place was pretty empty when we arrived for our 6:45 reservation, but by the time we left it had filled up.

The pork chop was so soft it nearly melts in your mouth, the fries were DELICIOUS w an aioli dipping sauce. Omg I want it again. Then I got the catch of the day which was mahi mahi.. And since I'm a huge corn lover, I got corn for a side. I don't even know how to explain how this corn was prepared, but basically, it tasted like heaven. The iced tea I ordered was like nothing I can describe, so pleasantly unusual. With all that food, it most definitely filled both of us. We ended with the brownie, it was flourless.

Greg's Meatballs were delicious as was the Serrano Ham Flatbread. I recommend trying both of these dishes. The Burrata Cheese Spread definitely hit the spot. The tomato marmalade went perfectly with the cheese when spread across the bread. This dish was so good we ordered a second serving. Two thumbs up for this dish. Lastly, the corn pudding was just OK. I wouldn't get it again nor recommend it to. The service was suspect on this visit and here's why. 1) When I checked in with the hostess she seemed confused when I told her I had a reservation. I mean I know my name isn't what you'd expect when looking at me, but it shouldn't have thrown her for a loop.  2) We didn't receive our free tapas that you are suppose to get when you order a cocktail, wine or beer between 5pm -7pm; until I read out loud (in front of the waitress) the huge sign above the bar that stated you get a free tapas when you order a drink. 3) Our waitress was very abrupt and lacking in personality.

The vibe of the restaurant was trendy and fun, great for either a date night or to bring a group as there was ample group seating.  Unfortunately, the food and drinks were not very impressive compared to other tapas spots in River North. My boyfriend and I split the pork belly sliders, white bean spread, crispy potatoes and meatballs. The sliders were definitely my favorite. The pork that was wedged between 2 soft buns seriously melted in my mouth. The spread pretty good, white bean with a bacon jam on toasted bread. There were only a couple of pieces of bread to scoop everything up so we ended up having a lot of the spread leftover. The potatoes and the meatballs were just okay...nothing to write home about. The potatoes were pretty bland, easily something I could have made at home and the hazelnut sauce on the meatballs was too overpowering. Drinks were pretty standard- the beer selection was small but they had a decent cocktail menu. I had a couple glasses of overpriced sangria which were fine. Throughout the meal our service was great, our server made sure our glasses were full and our plates were well spread out.

2014-02-28,4.0,"My wife and I have been to Tavernita now a handful of times with a bunch of different people--it's becoming our go-to place, given how close it is to our home and the quality of the food. Atmosphere-wise, it's not really our kind of place--too many young professionals rubbing up against one another (and I say that as a young professional myself). However, the food is incredible--inducing many a craving, which for me, is rare in a restaurant (maybe I'm picky?). The craft beer list is so-so (though I'm enamored with the glasses they serve the beer in), but my wife and her friends seem to enjoy the cocktails they've tried. Anyway, forget all that, it's the food you come here for (did I mentioned that yet?). We're not big meat eaters, so I can't comment on the meat dishes (though a friend did order, on the advice of the waiter, the meatballs and liked them). However, the gnocchi is simply delicious. They sprinkle some kind of breadcrumbs on it that give it a nice crunch, and every time we order it, it has been cooked perfectly, not too soft and mushy. Get this dish! When we go there with other people, we sometimes even order a second helping. The beet salad is also a must order for us every time we go. Beets + potato chips + artichoke hearts + blue cheese = deliciousness. Other things we've tried: mushrooms (good), the pear flatbread (pears were a little firm, ok dish), the fries (decent), the mushroom flatbread (good), a variety of the spreads (very good). Ok, so writing this, I guess I go back mainly for the beets and gnocchi. They alone could get five stars, but I balanced with the atmosphere and service, I'll go with four stars. The service has been good, nothing too great but serviceable, and the dishes come out quick. I'd suggest starting with a few plates and then adding more as you try things (like I said, the dishes come out quick). Just a few small negatives: it can get busy and crowded and the hostesses can be a bit cold. Our first time there, we made a reservation but had to wait 30 minutes to be seated, no apology, nothing. I understand the difficulty in navigating reservations and seating, but it soured us a bit. I'm glad we stayed though given how great the food is. It seems to bring in a lot of work parties, so we always seem to have to weave through throngs of people clogging the bar area on the way to our table. It's a noisier place. We don't usually mind it, but it might not be the best place for a quiet, intimate dinner.",0.9902,0.835,0.121,0.044,0.49503267973856213

I worked with Sharon to plan the event and it went off without any problems.  We did have to wait maybe 10-15 minutes, but it was a Saturday night, so it was not bad at all.  We were seated in the back room, which was not as ""exciting"" as the main dining area, but it was still very nice.  The decor is very trendy.  There were a lot of groups as well as couples.  Here are the items we ordered from our sharing package: pork belly sliders, fruit jam, picked red onion, brioche bun half mushroom and half ham flatbreads corn pudding, shrimp, poblano peppers, herb salad halibut, avocado, grapefruit salsa, crispy plantains ny strip (medium rare) with 2 sauces: red wine sauce, chimichuri sauce spiced fries, garlic aioli balsamic glazed mushrooms dessert tasting Everything was amazing.  Good sized portions, and NO ONE, not even the bigger guys in our group, left hungry.  It was great that they didn't skimp because that's always a concern with a tapas/sharing menu.  My favorite items were the pork belly sliders and the halibut.  Everything was served fresh, done just right, tasted great, and the presentation was spot on.  I would not hesitate to return.",0.9948,0.814,0.174,0.012,0.5076453308596166

Our older daughters ordered the artichoke and beet salad and the charred fennel salad which were quite large and very tasty. Only two in our party ordered entrees, and they were very slow to come and all of the servers seemed to mutually disappear when we wanted to inquire about his order. In fact, it took so long that my husband didn't even want his any more, but they promised his pork chop was on its way. Eventually it arrived, and it was ok, but not worth the wait.

I got the emperors new clothes (wished I had gotten the full sized since it was delish) and the missionary's imposition, which was too sweet for my taste but was glad I tried it. The wines were great too, but their sizing for glasses is a little different so just make sure you ask. We also got the hamachi from the raw bar and the mushroom flatbread, ok and good in that order. Their downfall was service. I do feel. Like it may be better for bigger groups because you get more attention. Maybe it was because there were only two of us in a corner but  we kept getting forgotten about! Our waiters kept switching because the next person kept realizing we had been sitting forever and would apologize then take our order.

The way the food is served is family style- ie if you order a skillet, you get three little skillets of the same dish that can be shared across the table. I had the brandy punch, which I liked a lot- they dont stint on the alcohol here. I take all the ice out of the drink and so I could taste it better. This one is sweeter, a better dessert option. I also had the margarita, and it is a fair one, would give it 3 stars.  We had the breakfast skillet, the chicken and waffles, the eggs benedict and the pork sliders.

They were cooked to perfection and I would go back just to have those again. Other items that are very very good were the cheese spreads (burrata and the ricotta were amazing). The gnocchi is amazing (super heavy) and has this breadcrumb crust on the top of it. So good! The chicken ""large plate"" was so good. The sauce was almost a thick balsamic type sauce that had mushrooms in it. The sauce was amazing.  The booty collins is a really good drink. I also had a sip of the turista as well. I would highly recommend both. \ CONS: Service was just okay. It took some time to get our drinks out and the food was slow at times. We asked for more bread for the spreads a couple of times until we just gave up. Some of the other specialty drinks were awful and definitely for a certain pallate. I wish they had more cocktails similar to the booty collins.  Their desserts are awful and they need to add more to the menu. I felt like everything else was so good as far as the food went and their desserts were not good at all.  Overall, we had a really good experience.

This is where I like restaurants like Sable or Cafe Babareeba better -- I think by selecting a menu up front, you're signing on for food you're not even sure you'll be hungry for. I'd much rather order a few things, keep a menu, and then order more if we're still hungry. Anyhow, some things were stellar -- the spicy fries and baked chicken were divine. And the Booty Collins drink was DELICIOUS and a must-order. Other things were just average, like the cheese spread and the calamari -- I've had better. For groups - great choice.

We were seated immediately and our waitress dropped off drink menus. She gave us a very thorough explanation of the drinks and how to order off their menu. Based on her recommendations and the cocktail samples she brought over (I know, cocktail samples!), we each ordered two delicious drinks: the Booty Collins and the Hot Tony G. Booty Collins is nice and fruity with a bit of bubbles, and the Hot Tony G is definitely on the spicier side.  As per our waitress' recommendation, we ordered 4 dishes: Artichoke and beet salad, heirloom tomato salad, mushroom flatbread, and the chicken croquettes. This was probably one too many dishes (waitress recommended 4-5 but I would definitely say 3-4 for girls). All 4 dishes were delish, but the chicken croquettes stole the cake. Deliciously creamy and decadent.  One place where I would definitely dock points: SERVICE. I personally like to take my time with ordering and eating, and I feel like our waitress continued to come over far too quickly and put pressure on us to make decisions and order. My girlfriend and I were looking to catch up and have a nice, long meal, but we felt rushed. From the time we were seated to the time we got the check was less than 45 minutes. I don't like when restaurants just bring the check without asking if we'd like anything else. Definitely room for improvement on that front.

You have several choices around Chicago for tapas, but I think besides the food the main reason for going is the atmosphere. Tavernita has the atmosphere and then some. It's loungy and decadent at the same time, but a comfortable decadence. The staff was very friendly and very helpful when it came time to order. The best thing I liked about the food, was the many choices of seafood options, including the raw bar. Every time I go I always order the corn pudding, which is like soft, creamy cornbread with poblano peppers and shrimp and herbs on top. I will add though, the best time to go is for dinner.

I love the decor and look of the inside, but otherwise, it was just... ok. Would have been a three-star review if I hadn't been so ambivalent. So I work in the same building, and last week someone came around giving out free sandwich coupons for everyone who works in the building. It says ""1 FREE SANDWICH"" on it and indicates one per guest, doesn't include fries or salad, and that the offer is only valid during lunch hours. Nowhere on the little card does it have any restrictions on what sandwiches you can order from the lunch menu. So I called and ordered a burger from the sandwich section of the lunch menu, told the woman I had a coupon, and thought everything was fine. Not 5 minutes later I get a call from Chad, who told me that they only have three options for the free sandwich offer, and the burger isn't one of them. When I explained that nowhere on the coupon does it say that, he repeated himself that there were only three options. I told him that it's very misleading not to put that on the coupon and he said, ""Okay."" Based on that fabulous customer service, I told him I didn't want anything and hung up. Now I'm not sure what made them hand out the coupons to everyone, or if they overestimated their capabilities or underestimated the cost of the endeavor, but either way, instead of enticing me in to come back even when I don't have a coupon, Tavernita has ensured that I won't be back at all for any reason, and I won't be recommending the place to anyone else. It's a shame, because these coupons normally work! After getting a discount at their neighboring in-building restaurant, Taco Joint, I was hooked, and have gotten lunch there quite often, something that could easily have happened with Tavernita.

Our friends arrived so we moved to the tables.  The clientele can be somewhat of a type.  Let's just say there were dudes with their shirts buttoned just to the middle.  No gold chains though.  The service took a bit of a dive.  Our server was friendly but was the kind who says ""that's so good"" for everything you ask about.  I need more direction.  So we were on our own.  I wanted a sparkling rose and their only one is $16.50/glass or $50 for the bottle.  So I got the bottle!  I loved it.  My friends got a red wine that they seemed to like, and a beer.  We started w/ the chicken croquettes which were truly ""so good"".  I could have had 80 more of them.  Then we tried 2 spreads - burrata which is never bad, and the white bean spread which was heavenly.  We asked the server what's in it and she reluctantly said beans w/ some oil on top.  LOL!  They did bring some extra bread which was nice.  Then we got the 2 flat breads - I only tried the mushroom which was good but didn't knock my socks off.  Nice crust.  Same with the calamari.  It was just ok.  Then the meat eaters had some steak tartar.  We got the halibut which was great, and lastly the corn pudding with a few tiny shrimps on top (am I redundant?)  The pudding was good but its like they hid the lack of shrimps by putting a mound of arugula on top that was not needed.  It wasn't like the corn pudding at Bub City which does just fine by itself. And that was it.  I think we'd be back for oysters and snacks at the inside bar.  I hope that guy is there!  I have a feeling we have to go early.  As we were waiting for the car a couple pulls up, the woman took a lot of effort for dinner at 9 on Sat night - great hair, pretty dress.  Her date or whatever gets out and he's in scrubs.  LOL!!!  ""Oh-Are they?""",0.9989,0.722,0.229,0.049,0.54876026272578

The goat cheese and arugula mixes so well and the caramelized onions is almost like a spread.  New dishes include: Pork Belly Bocadillos: This was def. one of my favorites! The thick piece of pork belly was so delicious and the fruit jam added a great sweetness to the savory slice of meat.  House-Made linguini: This was so good! At this point, I was really full but the linguini had an amazing buttery taste, and I loved all of the herbs they mixed in with it! Brussels Sprouts: This was another surprise on the menu! I am not a fan of brussels sprouts, but the fontina cheese was delicious and the pieces were crispy!  Paella: To be honest, I was not a fan of this dish. It was one of the specials that night and it had serrano ham, octopus, and shrimp in it with saffron and other spices. It was a bit strange because it was made with pasta and not rice and I don't think it was worth the $20 that we paid for it.  Ceviche: Made with celery, tomatoes, cilantro, orange and jalapenos. It was served on thin crackers and the the jalapeno contrasted really well with the orange! Foie gras conserva: Foie gras mousse with a cherry compote on a grilled baguette. It was absolutely delicious and the first time I had foie gras. I think we all had 3 pieces each! Coca de jamon: It was a flat bread with serrano ham, mahon cheese and tomato sofriot. The nice addition to this was a pepper they used so it was an unexpected flavor.  Escalivada: This was a crostini covered in eggplant, red peppers and goat cheese. The goat cheese was SO delicious and it was a generous piece. the eggplant was cut so thinly and absorbed the flavor of the hazelnut.  Artichoke salad: They gave us so much ARUGULA and the artichoke chips were super delicious! Croquetas: It was filled with serrano ham and saffron aioli. I described them as the pillow of flavor.  Patatas: The best potatoes I have had for a while. They were cooked with chorizo, topped with a fried duck egg and then covered in brava sauce. Like the salad, we all ate generous helpings of this and we still had leftovers.  House made ravioli: They were stuffed with ricotta, and cooked in saffron butter. Included arugula, artichoke and olives as well.  Scallops: cooked with olive oil croutons, almonds and celery. They were huge portions and super flavorful.  3 kinds of mousse: OMG, perfect way to end the dinner. There were 3 kinds: One was a passion fruit covered with pistachios, another was almonds covered with an oreo cookie crumble. and the center one was a chocolate mousse covered with strawberries and blueberries.

My first few visits to Tavernita included refreshing cocktails - the Booty Collins was always a favorite - and copious amounts of Spanish wine and cider; it has always been a good place to ""empinar el codo"", in other words, (liberally) imbibe ""the Spanish way"".  On my latest visit, the cocktail - the cocktail of the month - was undrinkable; it was a jarring combination of tequila, salt, and grapefruit juice - a Paloma gone horribly wrong.  It was time to revert back to the ""old faithful"", a glass of Albarino. And then there's the food: the albondigas (Greg's Meatballs or whatever they're called now) were at one time succulent and juicy; they've been replaced by an over-salted breadcrumb ball, enrobed in an (you guessed it!) over-salted romesco sauce.  Three-quarters of the cazuela was sent back to the kitchen, untouched, on my most recent visit.  The corn pudding was also a clever way for us to receive a generous dose of sodium chloride, but not much else in the way of flavor, satiation, or enjoyment.  The burrata cheese was probably the least offensive of the lot, but as a cheese fanatic, I cannot recall when I last met a cheese I didn't like. From the beginning of time (or at least when Tavernita first opened), I'm not sure who decided those little pots of pudding/ mousse with Oreo and other miscellaneous toppings (a la Pinkberry) for dessert were Spanish (or, for that matter, actually tasted good).

The menu is tapas (small plates and meant to be shared).  We ordered seven dishes which was the perfect amount. The ladies who were drinking started with the Booty Collins, their signature drink.  It was delicious! Highly recommend it. We ordered 3 plates to start a cheese and jam spread, meatballs, and a salad. My favorite starter was Gregs meatballs. They were great and had a little kick to them.  My favorite side we had was the potatas. These consisted of a fried egg, potatoes, chorizo, and a brava sauce. This was one of my favorite dishes we ordered! It was a great blend of sausage, egg, and potatoes.  My favorite entre we got was the house-made linguini. It had shrimp in it with  great seasoning! We also had calamari which was nothing special. We had an order of lobster macaroni.  They were only a few pieces of lobster. No different than the macaroni you can buy at the store. We were too full for dessert. However, they had a nice selection.  This restaurant is very chic and has a fun ambience! Highly recommend it as a date spot or a great place to go with a group of friends.

When you go, you MUST order the corn pudding with shrimp, poblano peppers and herb salad (on second thought get two). Greg's Meatballs, the ceviche and the beet salad are also great.  The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is the fact that despite making reservations every time I've gone (4 times now) I've been seated at least 20-45 minutes after I've arrived and dealt with indifference/rudeness from the hostesses each time.

2013-02-18,3.0,"Went here for my girlfriend's birthday after failing to find tables at 3 previous restaurants? I'm sure it was close to that number. Then the group stumbled upon this place. It's one of those places that you can get a 7on7, oh wait, no you can't because they don't have Seagram's. I'm sorry, a whiskey 7 for $15 and about a mile away they cost $6. These places are my favorite... Finally sat down and it's ALL BOOTHS! Who would pick a table over a booth? NO ONE! Smart on you, Tavernita, well played to win over my heart. I didn't even look at the menu because the group just ordered everything. We had a few plates and most of them were good. I just can't put a name to the really good ones, unfortunately. The ceviche was awesome. It is probably the best ceviche I have ever had. Although we had a girl in our group have her stomach disagree with it, as well as mine, I will still defend it and say it was amazing. Just try not to mix it with alcohol. That was probably why it hated us. The bad... For such a prestigiously priced menu, you would think the steak would be amazing. It is not. It is so fatty and tough that it is basically inedible. I didn't see the price of the steak itself but I'm assuming it was up there. I don't even want to talk about it anymore. And last of the bad, is this dessert they brought out. I'm not going into detail about it but I will explain exactly what it tasted like. A stale saltine topped with warm chocolate pudding and too much salt. Disgusting.  Other than the bad, there were some very good plates brought out and our server was very knowledgable of the menu. He engaged our conversations slightly too much and too often but we're an awesome group of people so it's really hard.  3 stars from me. A lot of good, a few things in the middle, and a few VERY BAD things. I feel I am being fair. Give it  a shot.",0.854,0.765,0.133,0.102,0.564355850867479

It was just okay, perhaps the restaurant week offerings were not as good as their regular menu, but I thought the whole idea of restaurant week was to entice people to try out a new place and then come again.  I have to say everything was edible, it was not horrible, but it was pretty small portions and very plain without much flavor.  If I am going to have small portions I want them to be delicious. We ended up getting the chicken as our big plate and the skin was very mushy and the chicken lacked flavor.  I cannot even remember what else we got as it was just not that good or worth remembering.  The service was not very good either, our server was pleasant enough, but I do not believe he asked us how our food was and we had wanted to order a liter of wine, but he never came back to our table so we sat drink less till dessert.  The only saving grace of this place was the dessert.  It was amazing, we ordered the Dulce de Leche or perhaps it is the Tres Leche (I am not too sure).  So if you want to have some drinks and dessert I would go here if you are looking for a tasty dinner and good service try someplace else.  I now know why the place was so empty on what should have been a very busy evening.",0.9456,0.838,0.099,0.063,0.5420852912519579

2013-02-04,3.0,"Tavernita is a nice trendy spot...I dig it. I don't dig the way they do Restaurant week though.  You're able to pick a couple of plates for your table but we thought that maybe since we had 6 people in our party, it'd be a little different. As in, we'd be able to get a variety of things to choose from since people's tastes differ. That wasn't the case here. If it says ""pick one"" they mean, pick one for your whole party and we'll bring out a medium size portion that will kind of accommodate you and your party. Let me give you an example, 6 adults (3 men, 3 women) had to share 1 whole chicken for an entrée. The guys that were there with us, aren't big eaters by any means but... the three of them could have easily shared 1 or 2 chickens on their own...now throw 3 more people in there and imagine just 1 chicken for all 6 of us. I'm allergic to shellfish, so we were stuck getting said chicken, but  1/2 of the table wanted the hand made linguine with shrimp sausage. So again, I point out the VERY limited choice we had for a party of 6 with different tastes, and a food allergy.  All in all, the food we did get to try was excellent. Here are the other things we had (again, VERY SMALL portions for a table of 6) pork belly bocadillos: Think pork belly sliders. (eggplant, red peppers, hazelnut romesco, goat cheese) escalivada: Must love eggplant and peppers to enjoy this appetizer. (apple jam, pickled red onions, brioche) brussels sprouts: The brussel sprouts and cheese were a great combo. (chestnuts, val d'aosta fontina cheese) patatas: This was the stand out at the table. Everyone loved this. Smash that egg, mix, enjoy.  (potatoes, chorizo, fried egg, brava sauce) The drinks were tasty, I loved the Booty Collins.  Oh, I'd stay away from the Pan Con Chocolate as a dessert. It's really not very good.  The staff was super friendly. The restaurant is huge and dimly lit (great date spot).

My only complaint is the food was served way too fast until I asked our server to slow it down. The NYE menu included the following at a fixed price - one crudo, three en pan, two small and two large plates.  We selected faroe island salmon, pork belly bocadillos, serrano ham flatbread, mushroom flatbread, corn pudding, patatas, braised beef short rib, and the chicken a la brasa.  I wrongly assumed all dishes would be much smaller portions than usual. The mushroom flatbread had a tasty topping blend of goat cheese, caramelized onions and herb salad.  It was the first time we tried the serrano ham flatbread and quite enjoyed it.   The jam and pickled onion topping complement the pork belly bocadillos quite well. The corn pudding and patatas are I think some of the restaurant's best dishes.  The pudding has an interesting mix of shrimp, poblano chile, and herb salad.  The fried patatas (potatoes) have a spicy flavor complements of the brava sauce and chorizo and is topped with a fried duck egg.  Delicious, although I could have used more brava sauce.   We only tried a bite of the large plates which were full size entrees.  I found the chicken to be bland.  The beef short rib was good; I particularly liked the potato puree and the horseradish gremolata that accompanied it.     We tried a variety of drinks including the red sangria, booty collins, tatan hat, comandante big nose, antoni gaudi, turista, and the sos cherry.  The sangria and booty collins are what stood out.  I got the gaudi since this drink is named after my favorite architect.

2012-12-31,3.0,"My husband and I checked out Tavernita when we spent an evening in Chicago for a wedding gift. I had read a lot of the reviews about the long wait even with a reservation, so we had a back-up reservation around the corner just in case. However, I can happily say it wasn't needed! We had an 8:30pm reservation and arrived right on time. We were told we would be seated closer to our reservation time and to grab a drink at the bar. Let's just say the clock started ticking at that moment and I was giving them 20 minutes to seat us or we'd be out of there. Thankfully, at 8:45pm they scooped us up from the bar and we headed to our table. As many of the other reviewers mentioned, the tables are extremely close together. I would imagine for a big group this would be annoying, but since it was just my husband and I we didn't mind one bit. We started off our meal with the burrata en pan. The cheese was so creamy and delicious, and the tomato marmalade was to die for! We were off to a good start. Next came the corn pudding. I am a huge fan of anything with corn so I had high hopes for this dish and I must say my expectations were definitely met. The poblano chiles add a little spice and sweetness to the dish. Finally, we come to the entree- my husband got the New York strip steak special. He said it was good. I had a small bit and it was cooked perfectly. I opted for the braised beef short rib. I knew this was a bad choice when they served my entree with a steak knife!! YIKES! A short rib should never need a knife.... if cooked properly it should fall apart with a fork.

At 8:30 on a Saturday night, the restaurant was dark and the bass made conversation virtually impossible. Most of the girls walking in were dressed to go clubbing.  Unfortunately for me, it wasn't a great setting for a first date. This guy could have been charming and hilarious and thrilling all at once, but... I have no idea what he said that night. He looked good in the lighting, though. I take Tavernita for what it is and am not giving it 3 stars because it's better suited for a girl's night out. It was just a 3-star kind of place for me. Our waiter was really hyper and talked incredibly quickly-- it was actually funny that he was able to explain the entire menu, in great detail, in a matter of seconds. There's a heavy emphasis on drinks here, as you might expect. I took the waiter's recommendation of the Turista, which was good enough for me to order a second. I'm glad it wasn't super sugary, but it was a little weak. Food! The tapas are a bit more inventive than, say, Babareeba or Quartino. I tried the pork belly bocadillos, la bomba, and Greg's meatballs per Yelp's suggestions. Tastewise, they were a bit of a letdown compared to their descriptions. The pork belly tasted like delicious pork belly always tastes. The la bomba reminded me of those fried potato balls from Omaha Steaks.

Spanish patatas with chorizo - very good.  The only dish that we thought was just OK, was the Cobia - also the most expensive. All-in-all, the food very good.  I thought this restaurant is a bit overpriced, even in this neighborhood. Service - unusually fast, to the point that we sat down, ordered all the dishes and had our check in 54 minutes.  Even the waiter talked so fast and wouldn't stick around long enough to ask for additional drinks, or coffee or dessert. We were not even offered coffee or dessert - just given our check and it was over licitly split. Drinks - we ordered the red sangria - too sweet & could be named ""Fruit Punch"".  Did not taste the red wine that is usually in red sangria.  Ordered some Spanish white wine - very good, although the wine is offered in 3 sizes, we were not offered an option of what size we received. Summary - go there with more than 2 people - the ambiance is very loud & friendly.  Lots of groups sharing lots of plates.  However, be prepared to pay inordinately high prices for everything from the drinks to the small plates.  I cannot comment on coffee or dessert - not offered any.",0.9906,0.836,0.158,0.005,0.5017460317460317

2012-10-09,1.0,"Holy pretentious ridiculousness!  When my friend sent me the menu to this place, I got a pretentious vibe pretty quickly, but since majority wins, we settled on Tavernita. Turns out I was totally right. Our group of 5 had a confirmed reservation for 8:45 pm on a Saturday night. Four of us arrived by 8:30 and we were told we couldn't be seated until our fifth member arrived. Fair enough. Our #5 showed up promptly at 8:45 pm. When we went over to the hostess to let her know we were ready, she told us our table wasn't ready yet and that our reservation was actually for 9 pm. No it wasn't. We had called to confirm 8:45 pm the day prior. Whatever. Waiting 15 minutes didn't seem like a huge deal given that the place was poppin for a Saturday night.  9 pm rolls around and we hear nothing from the hostess. Meanwhile other groups are coming in and getting seated just fine. Around 9:20 pm, we politely inquire again about our table and get the same answer of a ""few more minutes."" By 9:40 we were getting patient. What's the point in making a reservation if you're going to end up waiting for an hour anyway?! The hostess was not at all helpful and kind of snobby- how dare we ask about our table more than once after waiting for an hour right? The manager eventually came over to us close to 10 pm and apologized for the wait, though he still didn't explain WHY we were waiting. In an attempt to placate us he bought us a round of drinks at the bar, which admittedly, was a nice move. We figured that things would move along now that the manager was apprised of the situation but it took another half hour and one more trip to the manager who told us he would go check on the table right now before we were seated. The basic gist of it was that the group at our table opted to dawdle for a considerable amount of time and didn't think about leaving until the manager went over to talk to them. The manager didn't even bother checking up on them until we asked him again what was going on.  When we were finally seated, we were completely starving. Our waiter was very nice and took the time to explain the menu to us and offer his suggestions. The menu is of course tapas based and fairly limited in its choices. We had 2 vegetarians and a vegan in our party who had an interesting time trying to figure out what to order. Me and my fellow meat-loving friend ordered the croquetas, pork belly bocadillos, and prawns a la plancha. Croquetas were the best- creamy potato puree with hints of ham. The prawns were unexpected...they arrived with heads, tails, and exoskeleton still intact and having to pry them off with silverware was undoubtedly a messy experience.  Overall the evening left a bad taste in my mouth and a stomach that was still hungry. The food was meh- nothing to really write home about or rave about. I'd like to see a broader ranger of options but given that it's a tapas place, not sure how often they change their menu. We could've gone some place equally swanky and gotten a lot better and a lot more food for the price we paid. The service was our biggest point of contention- if I wanted to wait an hour or more to be seated without any explanation, I wouldn't go through the trouble of making a reservation.  I'd chalk this up to a lesson learned and definitely DO NOT plan on going back to Tavernita again. Save yourself the hassle, I'm sure there are better places in River North that are actually worth your time and money.",0.9856,0.834,0.104,0.063,0.4742374727668846

Would definitely pick Cafe BaBaReeba over this just on the basis of portions. I would like to add that our service was great! I wish I could remember our servers name and give him a shout out.

The pork belly was some of the best pork belly I have eaten. The cut of meat was just right and the cooking was just enough to make the meat not spongy and so rich in flavor. The pickled onions and jam were perfect complements to the pork. Greg's meatballs was another good dish. The meatballs were a mixture of beef and pork and had just the right hint of spiciness. The sauce was incredible and gave the dish a wonderful, rich flavor overall. The poached eggs were perfect. They were served on a brioche bread with a sweet tomato marmalade and saffron-hollandaise sauce. The sweetness seemed a little off at first but really made an interesting point and balanced out the richness of the sauce and bread. Our final course, the fried chicken & churros was not very good. The chicken and churros were both cooked perfectly but the sauce seemed a little off. There was no sweetness to the sauce and just tasted a little burnt. When we notified our server of our concerns, she quickly apologized and asked what we would like instead. We asked for the pancakes and are very glad we did try something else and give the restaurant a chance to redeem themself. They were just sweet enough and had the perfect amount of tartness with the fruit. The brown sugar mousse was a perfect complement and made the syrup unnecessary. The serve at Tavernita was incredible. The waitress was attentive but not annoying. She handled the disappointment with one of the dishes flawlessly and had very good knowledge of the menu. We are adding this restaurant to our regular list for Sunday brunch. I am curious to see what their other meals are like. They seem a little pricey for other meals, but given the quality of the food for brunch, I am sure they will meet expectations very well.",0.9991,0.73,0.251,0.019,0.6394826055170881

Problem one: I couldn't get over the fact that this used to be Martini Park, and that place was gross. Problem two: Every restaurant in town does small plates now, so it takes a lot to stand out. Problem three: Spanish tapas should be simple and relatively cheap, and this food just can't compete with Cafe Iberico and Ba Ba Reeba in that regard. The best dish we had was the burrata en pan, but let's be honest, it's nearly impossible to mess up cheese and bread. The squash dish was really spicy even though the menu didn't even mention peppers, and the short rib croquetas were neither short ribby or croqueta-ey. We also had a mousse trio for dessert that was pretty unique and tasty, and our server was excellent, bringing out an extra free dessert w/a candle in it because we were celebrating a special occasion.

Because we were a relatively large party (12) we had multiple people serving our table and bringing the food out and taking orders for drinks and such. I think that led to some confusion on our part and on the restaurant's part as to what we were ordering and what we had already received.  Second, the food was incredibly plain and boring. I will echo what others have said and say that I have had much better tapas and spent A LOT less money. This place was a huge rip off. We had sangria for the table which ended up costing more than sangria ANYWHERE I have ever been before.

There was no fish flavor, just a nice tender whitefish with a delicious citrus finish.  The pork belly bocadillos was a close runner up.  Basically, this is a pork belly slider with pickled onions.  It is so decadent and the pickled onions add the perfect crunchy, cool balance to the fatty pork belly.  The pan con burrata was also fantastic.  The burrata was a delicious creamy cheese with so much flavor packed into one bite.  I thought the scallops were really interesting as well.  It was almost like a chicken salad, with nuts, grapes, celery, but they used scallops instead of chicken.  I thought it was a unique idea and very delicious.  I also loved the ravioli.  The saffron sauce was a perfect complement to the artichoke ravioli.  I thought the meatballs and patatas were pretty standard tapas fare, and nothing too amazing to note here.  A final dinner note, the bomba de Barcelona was so unique.  The meat was covered in fried potatoes with a delicious aioli on top.  I've never seen anything like this and I really enjoyed it.  Since I'm marathon training, I didn't enjoy any dinner drinks.  My in-laws seemed to all enjoy different cocktails, and it seemed like everyone had positive things to say.  I found the dessert menu to be a little lacking.  Since it was a birthday, we had the toast with chocolate and sea salt.  The chocolate was a little too bitter for my taste.  Overall, Tavernita is a fantastic tapas experience that I highly recommend.",0.9955,0.742,0.211,0.048,0.7225530303030302

2012-08-14,4.0,"I'd been to Barcito & Tavernita for a number of media functions but didn't think it fair to review it because the experiences were so over the top as to not be accurate. So, when I had the chance to have a sit-down dinner at Tavernita, I jumped at the chance to experience the restaurant like a real, live boy. And, you know what? It was just as good. I want to begin with the service. I felt very well taken care of. My server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, gracious, non-hovering, and extremely attentive. He added to the experience. Tavernita is all about tapas/small plates, so order a bunch, see what you like and don't forget to keep the booze flowing. In previous visits, I'd sampled much of the cocktail menu (the Booty Collins is truth) so I wanted to spend some quality time with the sangria on this go-round. Good choice. Packed with fruit and a nice, sweet flavor, the red sangria is a party in a glass. Be careful. It could easily go from fun to trouble in no time flat. Fun trouble, but trouble nevertheless. The plates are constructed to share, so you really can't go wrong with any. A few of the standouts are: 1.) the eggplant. I *know*. Eggplant? Yes. I was surprised as well. Eggplant, peppers, romesco, and goat cheese on bread = delicious and addicting. It's heavier than it looks, so don't plan on eating a great amount of it. 2.) The meatballs. I don't eat beef, but that romesco sauce is just too good. The combo of the beef and pork provide a delightful bite. 3.) Scallops. Not a huge portion but buttery delicious and bathed in ajo blanco. 4.) The citrus notes popped in my mouth and nose to make what could have been ho-hum into something that was fantastic. Because man can't live off savory alone, save some room for dessert. When I was there, mousse was the order of the day and whether it was fruity, chocolatey or nutty, it was all devoured. In seconds. You know me. The atmosphere is loud, brash and sexy. There's nothing subtle about Tavernita. So, know before you go. Is it a deal breaker? For some on some nights, I'm sure.

Funny, no manager ever came to our table to discuss our experience.  I was so unhappy that I actually called to speak to a manager once I got home.

Beautiful decor. We pretty much felt baller status sitting outside. Now for the food.. we ordered the Roasted Veggie Salad which was nothing too special. It had some roasted peppers, like 3 tiny pieces of eggplant, a sprinkle of goat cheese on top of mixed greens. It was very vinegarette dressing-y, to be honest I was let down. The Frites, basically thick cut fries with a spicy red sauce and aioli, was decent. I also tried the Beef Brisket Panini, good sized portion, which had a few pieces of pickled onions. It was still bland, kind of chewy, super dry. I think it really needs a sauce component as to balance out the dryness of the giant chewy bread. The spicy red sauce would be great on it! Either that or actually make it more of a grilled panini since to me it was just a lukewarm sandwich, nothing about the bread was pressed/heated. We also tried their handmade sodas, the white grape flavor and the orange, $4 each, meh. - I should have just ordered a glass of wine instead. Overall, this is a decent place to come with a couple friends for lunch or quick bite before going out for the evening. The restaurant itself, aesthetically, is worth experiencing.

Raw tuna: Much better, liked the green sauce  Crispy cod: Just a fish filet with corn meal or something on the outside. The fish itself was flavorless. The spinach underneath beat the fish! Calamari: Very oily... not the best. Served with the same ""aoli"" as the ham ball things. I use quotations because it wasn't really an aoli at all... I think it was just straight flavorless mayonaisse from the jar!! Was a bit shocked. Would have loved some garlicky aoli goodness... Mushroom ragu: Ummmmm... yeah. Slimey noodles in a sauce that tasted like it came out of a supermarket can. I was very bummed, I am a huge pasta fan. Way below expectations.  Steak tartar: Found a hair in it, politely sent that badboy back to the kitchen.

Food however was average at best, and inedible at most. Super loud, but fun at the same time if you don't mind the clamor. Basically, scenester establishment with pretty people, great decor and ambiance, average food, average drinks. Priced to match the incomes of patrons, not the menu itself. What rubbed me the wrong way service-wise was our server saw that not one of the 8 people in our group touched the cod main course. Mainly because it was inedible, completely unseasoned (like barren), and was not very fresh either. When we mentioned it to the waiter, he just said ok, and the bus boy took the 3 uneaten plates away. No apology or restitution. Also, we asked for some of our steak tartare to be packed up and they never came back with it.",0.9369,0.782,0.147,0.071,0.4710351377018045
2012-06-29,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about my dinner at Tavernita. There were highs, and there were lows, and they balance out.  First off, we had a reservation but still had to wait 45 minutes. I hate that and so many places get in the habit of doing it. You need to manage your reservations people; which is the point of a reservation! Luckily they have Barcito which is an indoor/outdoor bar with creative drink specials and catchy music. Creative drink specials, but weak on the alcohol. For the price of each drink, I got more mixer than I did liquor. Flavor wise, I had a paprika infused whiskey drink which was delicious.  The food was GOOD but there wasn't enough of it. I understand tapas but for the price of each dish, I expected more on the plate. We did ceviche and hamachi, both very good but not a lot of hamachi. Oysters were small, especially for $3 each. Pork Belly Bocadillos = DELICIOUS but i think came two per plate for a charge of $10 per plate. Greg's meatballs was the best thing on the menu and came with 5 meatballs, I really picked up on the hazelnut in the sauce. Our other favorites were the Steak Tartare and Braised Berkshire pork for both flavor and quantity, these hit the mark. The apples with the braised pork was to oink for.  Other fillers which didn't make the biggest impression were corn pudding (needed a kick and it didn't have one, ended up tasting just like corn bread), frito mixto (again, quantity, and this isn't an expensive dish to make), and the escalivada.  There were five of us and we paid $60 a person - not horrible but didn't get a whole lot for our buck. There are multiple tapas that if you want everyone to try, you need to order 2. I think their quantity does not equal their price coupled with weak drinks may be the down fall in the future.  On the positive side - amazing atmosphere with really really cool decorations .",0.9962,0.779,0.184,0.037,0.5810591206179441

2012-06-16,1.0,"My husband and I went to Tavernita last night for my birthday and we were extremely disappointed.  We had reservations and we still needed to wait about 15 minutes to be seated.  The hosts/hostesses just walk around aimlessly in the crowded entry/bar area with these little receipts that apparently have the parties last name and maybe some indication of what those people look like or are wearing.  Where is the efficiency in this process?  Once we sat down, we ordered a bottle of Cava (which was great), but throughout the dinner our waitress never brought an ice bucket for the Cava after saying she was going to.  She never once poured us more Cava either.  Her service was mediocre at best.  Now to get to the food - We ordered the ceviche, the croquettes, the fried calamari/shrimp dish, and the braised pork.  The only dish that was ""excellent"" was the braised pork.   The ceviche was served with housemade crackers that were too thick and didn't complement the taste of the ceviche at all.  Chef Poli should have stuck to corn chips.  The ceviche was also very watery - not as thick as typical ceviche (too much lime juice?, not sure what was causing that).  In any case, the ceviche was probably the 2nd best plate we had.  The other 2 dishes were terrible.  The croquettes especially had too much garlic and potato and barely any serrano ham at all (also, we love garlic, but the garlic here just didn't complement anything it overpowered the croquettes).  The sauce for the croquettes was also really bland and neither of us used it at all.  The same goes for the sauce for the calamari - it was a mayo based sauce, very non-comittal and totally bland.  We would have much rather had a cocktail sauce.  We chose to eat the calamari and shrimp by themselves without any sauce at all.  The seafood was cooked correctly, but the breading was a little too thick for our liking.  We actually shared our disappointment with the waitress and she did adjust our check (which was surprising and unexpected) based on our feedback.  Tavernita does have a very gorgeous atmosphere, but it is extremely loud and the tables are awkwardly close together.  We will not be going back to Tavernita ever again.",0.9708,0.863,0.092,0.045,0.5134823848238482

My only reason for giving this place a 4 and not 5 starts is because their menu outside is different than inside. It was an all you can eat bite sized menu for 20 bucks. I was dining with a vegan and a fitness model getting ready for competition, so we had to move inside because of menu limitations. Our experience inside was amazing. Our server Matt was outstanding with answering questions and being attentive. He pushed the salmon app with peppers and some sort of nuts and it was to die for. Plate licking good.

We tried the pan de burrata, the pork belly bocadillos (my absolute fave of the night) the mushroom flatbread (also another fave, clearly I have a love of carbs) the grilled shrimp (kinda messy but yummy, but they give u warm towels right after-talk about good service). Then we had the croquetas, super yummy with a garlicy alioli mayo, yum. Then came the Greg's meatballs, which I loved their spicy flavor and also the papardelle pasta (not my favorite dish, but the bachelorette loved it so I take that as a success) Lastly, they gave you a trio of desserts, different custards of chocolate mousse, passion fruit and pistacio, a wonderful sampling for everyone.  Overall, great experience, yummy food, adorable atmosphere, it wasn't overly loud that night and the bachelorette left happy. My only complaint is that the food was coming out too fast and we didn't have as much time to enjoy everything, felt a little rushed in my opinion.

We ordered the following:  - frito mixto--calamari and octopus were perfectly cooked, the cilantro aioli was kind of unique.  - Croquetas--fried cheese ball with serrano ham inside. Now this was yummy, cheesy, BUT we couldn't not taste the serrano ham at all. I could see the ham, but seriously, when i tried to taste the ham, I could not taste it. The other complaint was that the this dish combined with the calamari/octopus made the meal already very heavy. Both aiolis tasted very similar, and the fried part was a little overwhelming.   - Corn pudding--this was my favorite, it has multiple layers of flavors. Shrimp was salty, chile pobalano sauce was on the sweet side, corn pudding was also sweet, and arugula salad added the bitter note to it. Awesome!  - Greg's meatballs--I was excited to try this because I read so many good reviews on it. But it was kind of average, the meatball was not tender enough, the sauce, once again, too heavy. The balls got a little spice to it, but that's where the flavor ended... - Scallops - Perfectly cooked, but there's some sauce in there that tasted too creamy and heavy. Now if we started the dinner with this dish, I would've loved it. But after three heavy dishes, this dish was just too much.

At one point my girlfriend said to me: ""I feel like i should be fist pumping right now"" hahaha she has a great sense of humor. another thing that surprised me was when it came time for the check, the waitress added gratuity! i understand i was using my industry discount, but i honestly found it a little insulting. I see servers on a daily basis get crappy tips, and by no means would i ever do so. I ended up giving her far more then the 20% she already added.  if your into this kind of place and good little latin plates check it out, but be willing to spend some money.",0.995,0.734,0.226,0.039,0.628601866883117
2012-04-22,3.0,"It starts with some naked cowboys, continues with slurping the juice out of the (shrimp)head, and the finish is Greg's balls.  Meatballs, that is.  As I arrived for a friend's bday, the first thing I noticed is that the space is big, sexy, and very, very gold.  Don't know if it was because of the lighting, the flickering ""candles,"" or the wood paneled walls, but there's something to be said about having a gold hue over everything that makes the environment that much more lively. I don't remember much about the music playing while we dined, but I noticed some pop and dubstep intermixed.  It seems out of place, but once the crowd fills up the space, you hardly notice.   The drinks were interesting and flavorful; some red sangria was flowing, a one thumbed leprechaun or something like that was ordered by our birthday celebrant, several uve's - which, I believe were soda's, and and a drink called a Bootsy Collins were added to our tab.  While good and refreshing, the Bootsy was a tad on the weak side and by tad, I mean it was weak.  Not something I like for a $10 drink.  Now that I have that out of the way, let's get to talking about all the suggestive foods, starting with the East Coast Naked Cowboys.  No, not the Times Square Naked Cowboy, but the long island oysters, affectionately, the Naked Cowboy. While the table shared those cowboys, our group also lined up the tuna and crab, foie gras, prawns, frito mixto, croquetas, corn pudding, patatas, bocadillos, scallops, and Greg's meatballs.  As previously mentioned, these are sharing plates, including the meatballs.  While our waitress advised us that the best juices in the head are best sucked out - and by that I sincerely hope she meant the prawns - I taught some new oyster eaters best etiquette.  Which essentially is slurp, chew on the gelatinous, briny, filter feeding mollusk, and let it slide down your throat.  The taste of minerals, sea salt, and quite possibly, open ocean pollution.  The oysters are fresh, but I miss the traditional mignonette, instead, we were served with some type of bbq hot sauce.  And I found bits of shell in the oyster, possibly from a hurried oyster shucker keeping up with orders.  I would honestly recommend though, should you order the foie gras, please also order the Chef's meatballs.  They're tasty, dense, and when you spread them onto the toasted bread which comes with the foie gras, it's worth it. The after dinner coffee and tea were more than I expected, serving cappucinno, teas and coffee, and solo/doppio cups of espresso.   The drinks are unique, the service is great, and it's lively for hip and lively groups.  I might be back for another special occasion.",0.9977,0.788,0.181,0.032,0.46964510181176855

2012-04-18,1.0,"I was at Tavernita last night with a group of friends for a birthday party. The decor of the place is posh and stylish and the drink I had at the bar (Baricito) was good, although overpriced. Unfortunately, I cannot speak about the food because I didn't have a chance to try it even though we planned to have dinner there. Originally, the guy who was having the party negotiated the five course meal and drinks for $65 per person (which included all you can drink beer, wine, sangria and premium cocktails and mixed drinks for one hour) or $40 for the same option without drinks.  Some of us weren't OK with that and we were told that the à la carte was also available. We were a party of 13. Five of us wanted the 5 course meal and the rest wanted to go à la carte. In order to make things easier for our server, we decided to divide us in two groups based on this, one on one side of the table and the other one at the opposite side.   Unfortunately, when we told our server our intentions, he said that the only option available for parties larger than 7 people is the prix fixe menu because otherwise the  kitchen cannot handle it (Really? On a Tuesday night with 70% of the restaurant empty?!). In addition, the $65 all-you-can-drink-for-an-hour option was available only if everybody was choosing it. Some of us didn't feel like drinking that much so we were left only with the $40 option. At this point, 4 more people felt obligated to accept the $40 option (that was now discounted to $35, because we complained about the situation) while other 4 (me included) decided to leave and find another place. I think this is completely unacceptable from a restaurant of this level. Needless to say, I won't return to this restaurant again.",0.7769,0.87,0.074,0.056,0.5089506172839506

Honestly I'm not a big River North person- I typically stay away from girls dressed in bandage dresses reeking of desperation. However, I loved Tavernita. It's a scene for sure, which made me have low expectations heading in. We were seated promptly upon the entire party arriving. We were jammed in but we are all friendly so it worked. The food really exceeded my expectations. Honestly I was shocked. It was delicious. We had: Eggplant bruschetta   Pork belly sliders  Mushroom flatbread artichoke heart and beet salad (artichokes were clearly canned but salad still good) Grilled octopus Scallops Meatballs Small plates are tough for a big group but it was well executed and there was plenty of food. Service was good albeit a bit quick. We had been served all our food within 45 min of sitting down. The last few plates- they literally brought out 3 different dishes at once which was a but much.  I'm not giving 5 stars for several reasons: Service was a bit rushed. You can't turn over a party of 16 in an hour so stop trying to.  Cocktails were weak. For $12 I want a good cocktail. I got the booty Collins and it was weak. Tasted like seltzer. Another girl at the table ordered the same drink- and hers mistakenly had tequila in it instead of vodka. At least you could taste the alcohol in hers.... Draft beers here are super small- do yourself a favor and order wine- you get the most for your money.  Overall the atmosphere was really cool and the food was delish. I would definitely recommend it.

The drinks we had were winning- the sweet vermouth cocktail was a digestif dressed up right and the chile ginger soda was better for its mild dose of honey. Server awkwardly addressed girlfriend and not me, but perhaps because of the angle of the table, or perhaps because she is beautiful and I was dressed in a Deadliest Catch in memoriam Captain Phil teeshirt and black hoodie.  You know how folks react to those hoodies.  I thought it was weird that food runner was on Madonna style headset short band radio but girlfriend reassured me that it was natural. The food was consistently tasty across all sections of menu.  The raw oyster cocktail had mango papaya and shrimp in a large chopped up oyster.  At first I was taken aback at the disrespectful handling of the sea critter (myself being from East Coast) but it made sense in the context of real fork to mouth eating.  The duck flatbread with the little segments of orange was balanced.  The artichoke and golden beet blue cheese salad was girlfriend's favorite.  I liked the rich croquetas (""there's meat in there?"") and the fried custard for dessert.",0.9889,0.773,0.161,0.066,0.6030812551645884

2012-04-08,4.0,"I went here on Friday with a group of 9 girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. I'd highly recommend this for groups. Any group more than 6 I believe must coordinate with a party planner. I worked with Danielle who was excellent and responsive. One slight concern was that the entire meal must be picked in advance, but we ended up having more than enough food and one friend who was a Vegan was easily accommodated even though literally nothing on their sharing menu is Vegan (they ended up adapting a few vegetarian dishes).   Out of concern for my friends' budgets, I picked the lowest-level sharing option ($30 pp), and was a little worried we'd not have enough food. Boy, was I wrong. We had seven different items and for a group of 9, we got 3-4 plates of each of those to share. We had left overs from each course -- a rarity among my friends! Every dish was excellent ; my favorite was the meatballs and flat bread with caramelized onions, mushrooms and goat cheese. The pan con burrata was also a winner -- the burrata was the lightest and best among a few places I've recently had it at (Balena and Bar Toma).  Our server was friendly, but service in general has a few kinks to be worked out. A server brought out an extra plate of meatballs (which we were charged for) even after there were several leftovers remaining from the plates that were included in our package. The server took it off after we pointed it out, but still kind of confusing why we were charged in the first place (considering we never ordered extra). Overall, the place is a great place to go for awesome food and a great scene. The space and the people dining around you make you want to return. But, it's not a place to go if you're budget conscious, despite paying only $30pp for food, the total bill was about $75pp as drinks were very pricey. We each had about 2-3 cocktails or glasses of wine each, so be prepared to shell out. I'll be back for another special occasion with a group.

I had to communicate which dishes we would like in advance-no problem.   So here IS the problem....First off, it is a no-brainer that you should be nice to your guests.  I've been treated better at a Dunkin Donuts than the hostess and waitress treated us.  I will say that the food was good, but definitely not great.  It seemed like the main goal for these people was to get us in and out as fast as humanly possible.  After each dish the bus boys came and picked up all of the plates and glasses including my very expensive drink that was still half full.  All of us at the table were thinking  'why would they do that??'  So I thought, no big deal I'll just let the waitress know.  She looked at me like I was the biggest a-hole on that planet for even telling her something like this.  Yet again, this is hospitaly- be freaking nice.  My party ended up spending $500 there not including the drinks we bought at the bar before hand.   Here is my tip, just in case you are thinking about eating here......You have tons of great options in this city for dining....and most of these places treat you well because they WANT you to come back.... don't bother wasting your time or more importantly your money!",0.9973,0.714,0.24,0.046,0.5816576479076478
2012-04-02,2.0,"I'll stick with Cafe Iberico.  Their management is MUCH better.  The renovations Tavernita made are BEAUTIFUL!  Wow it is so hard to believe this was the old Martini Park.  Looks aren't everything though.  My cousin and I came here for a girls night out.  She is generally excited for Applebees so I was a little nervous she would think the place was pretentious or over priced for sharing plates.  The prices in fact were not that bad.  We walked in at 8:55 pm and they didn't have our reservation (@ 9) ready.  Which is fine... I guess ... the place was still very busy at 9 pm good for them!  The hostess was very passive aggressive with our ""situation"" (aka not having our table ready but making us feel bad about it).  It is also ridiculous that if you are waiting for your reservation, and are pressured to buy a drink at the bar, they will not send your tab to your table. EVEN if you are willing to tip the bartender.  As soon as we had placed our drink order (Booty Collins - was pretty good - and Comandante Big Nose - too sweet) our table was ready.  So by the time they made our drinks and we closed out,  the hosts were confused on who we were.     They led us to a small table on the east side of the restaurant.  THIS PLACE IS LOUD.  It was packed, so the roar of everyone in the restaurant was distracting, along with the loud music and tables that are on top of each other.  We were literally yelling to talk to each other and even then we could barely hear.  Which stinks, because we wanted to spend the evening gossiping!  We ordered:  Pan Con Burrata (this comes with 3 pieces) which was pretty good.  The burrata cheese had the taste of cottage cheese but the tomato marmalade was very good.  Coca de Setas (flat bread) was just okay.  I liked it much more than my cousin.  I also think they forgot to put the goat cheese on it.   The herb salad on top of it was interesting, but did absolutely nothing for the meal.   Greg's Meatballs were the best part of the entire meal (5 balls).  They were delicious.  It seemed like they were covered in some kind of cheese, bread crumbs and spices and the romesco sauce was delicious.  I only wish they weren't called Greg's Meatballs... just doesn't fit with the rest of the menu haha.   Our waitress was very nice, and the staff is OVERLY attentive.  My only complaint is the staff kept touching my fork and knife.  Sounds weird but true, they would pick it up from the mouth part of the fork, and top of the knife and move it every time they brought new plate.  They would touch it with their bare hands, that have been molesting other peoples forks and knives and god knows what else in between.   So overall everything was just okay.  I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The end of the night ended HORRIBLY when I stepped into the ladies room.  I walked in and start looking at my teeth, when all the sudden I see a man walking around the bathroom basically doing janitorial work.  A woman walks out of a stall and she screamed.  Keep in mind there are multiple women using the stalls when he was in there cleaning.   When I came out, I went to the manager standing at the host station and said there is a man in the women's bathroom.   He literally shrugged it off.  ""We don't have a female attendant"".  His lack of concern was REALLY bothersome.  So much, that I probably wouldn't come back.    I told him it would be nice to be informed of a man's presence in a WOMAN'S BATHROOM.  And he responded with a thanks and looked the other way...

We had several dishes which were all solid but nothing spectacular.  We started with the hamachi which was fresh and tasted great although one piece still had a bone in it, the knife work seemed uneven.  The en pan escalivada was good.  The best dish by far was the corn pudding with shrimp but only had one large shrimp on top cut up to smaller pieces.  Greg meatballs were also good and had some heat/spice that I thought some of the other dishes could have used.  The server was knowledgeable and personable but when some of the dishes arrived by the runners, a description of the dish was not always provided.  They only offer three desserts and we had two of them which just seemed like an afterthought",0.9873,0.778,0.182,0.04,0.5613945578231293

The food was ok, the one thing that stuck our was the porkbelly bocadillo;get it, its a not-to-be-missed-item. Drinks were the highlight of the evening. I vowed to only go back for drinks; unique flavors and outstanding complexity. However, my friend wanted me to try it out again, this time in the fun space. It was DEFINITELY better in the main dining location, but the food still didnt impress. Im going with my gut on this one, and will only be back for liquid items.

As great as the energy, the service and the cocktails were here, things inside the restaurant went downhill quickly.  Yes, it's loud and crowded, that's a given.

With that said, this review is based on limited foods and not having to pay---keep that in mind!*** I have been wanting to try Tavernita for some time, as its only a couple blocks away from me. I was thrilled when I learned about this cocktail reception my new company was throwing! The atmosphere is to be described as trendy. Gorgeous decor with latin flair, loud-ish music, and great service. The foods that were passed were wonderful. I do not recall the names of them, as I didn't really look at menus, so these are just my descriptions!  I tried these little potato ""rolls"", which were basically hollowed out with some sort of greenish creamy blend inside. Awesome tiny bites and could have eaten a tray full. The pork belly ""sliders"" were amazing as well. Lastly, tried the meatball skewers. Again, wonderful and rich. Now, the real winners: The drinks! I tried 3 different drinks and all were great. The tequila based drink with pepper syrup and bbq bitters was one of the best drinks I have ever had. Period. Amazing, easy drinking, yet with a bite of both tequila and pepper. The other two drinks were the Booty Collins (good) and some ginger rum drink (again, really good). All in all, Tavernita is a great place to go for happy hour. I did look at the menu this morning and gawked at how much it was.

First of all, we went a few weeks after opening so I'm sure that has something to do with things. To start off, the beverage program was incredible and our server did an excellent job of navigating us through the many options, even bringing over tastes of the kegged vermouth, and I'm so glad he did as I would have never tried but might consider ordering one next time. The wine list was impressive in that there was a decent variety but the prices were very low considering the area.  we ordered a bottle for $26 and it far exceeded expectations. now, what you've been waiting for....the food. We ordered the pan con burrata, the corn pudding with shrimp and the papardelle.  The burrata was smooth and flavorful, just as good, fresh burrata should be.  the corn pudding was excellent, i'd definitely order it again.  lastly the papardelle was underwhelming, it tasted like regular pasta with tomato sauce, and not a rather boring tomato sauce at that.

The bar menu seemed limited as it was more so geared to authentic beers and cocktails to accompany the Spanish theme... that's about all that was good. Having been seated at a larger booth 6 of us were crammed in while 2 additional chairs were pulled up to the table. I didn't care to be crammed in the middle and it seemed like Tavernita hadn't made appropriate accommodations for our reservation. Aside from that the tables were on top of another so I acknowledged that I would have been crammed either way. The food was just okay. There are a few winners like the meatballs and an eggplant/goat cheese bruchetta but a lot of the dishes missed the mark. Almost every one seemed to be cooler than the desired temperature, giving ne the impression that they sat under heat lamps. This was most likely due to the poor service! Being a former server myself, I always believe this aspect of dining to be most important. I watched as our server spent most of her time at smaller 2 top tables. We placed our orders in rounds and she was never available when we were ready to put in the next. Empty plates and glasses were left at our table, so we handed them to bus boys and food runners as they passed. We joked that she must Not have been paying us too much attention since she was already getting our 20% gratuity added for the large party size.  Didn't think this place was worth the hype.

2012-02-27,3.0,"The recently opened Spanish/Modern Tapas restaurant by Ryan Poli and the folks behind Mercadito definitely understand the crowd and strengths of their location and cuisine. Tavernita played the part of a hip, trendy, loud and place to be seen new restaurant in River North perfectly. The tables are on top of each other, the noise level boisterous and the cocktails simply wonderful. And I don't mean of of that in a negative way because it works well so long as you don't expect a quiet, low key and simple dining experience. I imagine that the food was an honest after thought in the design of the concept. It was mostly good overall with a few really nice dishes but nothing that I would rush back to order again (and not unlike many similar properties in the area) - but the focus of making great cocktails and a lot of money should work out very well. Our service was very good, very informative and attentive of all aspects of our meal. And the last reason I won't likely return in the very near term is that you definitely pay a premium to be at the hot spot with the hot people and the long wait for a table and chic cocktails (read: value is not high here, an expensive meal with shared plates and small portions). We were a table of four with our friends Barisa and Joel. As you can see from the pictures we were not shy about trying many things on the menu. We started with some pretty good sashimi crudo (or whatever they called it) and then moved right into traditional tapas fare. The menu is simple and not overwhelming with choices like other tapas spots in the city. We tried a veggie on toast dish (not my favorite - strong goat cheese), a really nice brussel sprouts dish (I see them on every menu these days), a version of patatas (good but needed more sauce with spice and the egg is a nice touch), lamb sausage, wagyu meatballs (delicious) and a round II selection of the house-made pappardelle (ironically the last thing we ordered but probably the tastiest thing we tried and funny because it's really an Italian dish, right?). I don't really know what the dessert was but it involved crazy good chocolate pudding (?) with salt on top of small toast squares - also a highlight of the meal. Overall the food had some nice moments but the drinks over shadowed the plates throughout and it was hard to take it seriously when you felt like you were eating in a club. But it all worked and if that is the environment desired, Tavernita is a nice addition to that scene (in addition to any Rockit Ranch or LEYE property). I don't know that Tavernita was going for a Michelin star but I don't think they need to or care to because it's a great place to hang out and have an exciting night out with delicious drinks and good food (but bring your high limit plastic).",0.999,0.757,0.225,0.018,0.5956064878104351

We had restaurant week reservations but we decided between the four of us we wanted to try more plates, and we went for the main menu.  Our server was really helpful, first,  recommending some of there kegged cocktails. We tried the booty collins, and another friend had the turista. The booty collins was a little sweet but not over the top. The turista had a smoky flavor, but was still sweet, which was a unique combo.  Our waitress recommended we get around seven plates to split between us, and so much looked so great on the menu it was hard to decide! We startedw ith the raw tuna with mango and jucama, which was great. I was excited for the escalivada, which is a favorite dish of mine, and our waitress was helpful in telling us right away that one portion came with 3 portions of it on a little piece of bread. She offered right away to add a fourth which was really helpful. It was a great combo of the peppers, eggplant, and goat cheese! Other dishes we got- coca de setas- i don't even really like mushrooms, but my friends wanted to order it and it was really great! the mushroom, onion, and goat cheese combo was perfect! grilled octopus- i love grilled octopus, and this was pretty good! They give you a really large portion (only oneother fried wanted to eat it) so I really ate a lot of it! The orange and tapenade was a really unique flavor with it! brussel sprouts-i love brussel sprouts, and the cheese  was a good combo. They could have been cooked a little more to my taste though cod- this was perfectly cooked! very slightly crispy breadingo n the outside, but so moist and flavorful on the inside! the chimichurri added a little spice with the more expected combo with the onions and mushrooms. pig confit- they were out of suckling pig, but had pork cheeks. This was AMAZING, and probably the best pork i have ever had. It was so tender and flavorful! I would have never guessed that this would have been my favorite dish. Overall, service was pretty good for just opening, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was not too loud, however some of the tables are a little close together. This did not bother me until they had a huge party of about 15 people stuff into the tables right next to us.

We both liked them enough to order full sized ones after the half cocktail that came with the Restaurant Week menu. For our choices we had the escalivada, which was a great blend of flavors between the eggplant, peppers, and goat cheese. We also had the pork belly bocadillos. It was my first time having pork belly, and these were like little high-end sliders. The bread was soft, and the pickled onions gave a nice crunch to the sandwich. For our second round we had the artichoke salad and the corn pudding. While the salad doesn't contain anything incredibly interesting, it was a really nice blend of fresh flavors. The corn pudding was great. The poblano and shrimp really complemented the creamy, warm pudding. For our big plate we had the crispy atlantic cod. I love fish, and this was done nicely with a crispy cornmeal dusting, but the chimichurri really makes the dish. There was absolutely nothing average served to us during this meal.

Here is what we ordered: -Shrimp Pintxo (really good!) -Pan Con Ricotta (amazing-like bruschetta) -Artichoke Salad (so fresh and perfect) -Patatas (just the right amount of flavor) -Greg's Meatballs (cooked just right) Here is the restaurant week menu:  tavernita.com/menus/tave… We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and it hit the spot!

I'd been looking forward to this place opening for months, and I was excited when the restaurant sent me a 15% off coupon for signing up tp be notified when they opened. We were seated in the bar area. Our waitress told us they were filming for 190 North that night, so it was cool to see Ryan Poli running around. My favorite part hands down were the drinks; they're kegged, which is cool, and this means you can order two half cocktails, which is amazing. I think we tried six total. As I've seen mentioned here, the Booty Collins was just ridiculously good. You can't go wrong there. From the En Pan section, we did the pan con burrata, with sweet tomato jam, and the pork belly bocaditos, which were just succulent. I loved the corn pudding topped with shrimp, but I was just meh about the meatballs, though they did grow on me. The croquetas were tasty, but I could have done with a little more ham in them. Overall, we were really impressed, especially having been to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba the same week.

The cheesy decor of the bar once frequented by Chicago cougars has been replaced with a sleek modern decor. And while you may still spot a cougar or two this new hotspot is full of an attractive, young trendy crowd ready to get their drink and food on.   I myself was ready to get my drink on and ordered a glass of sangria. And it was one refreshing and tasty glass of sangria. The food was good as well, although didn't I was much more impressed with the atmosphere and drinks. Our party of 4 shared several dishes from the menu (sharing is the way to go here). I enjoyed everything from the ceviche to the parardelle to the scallops, but nothing really blew me away. I left dessert up to the one and only Johnny T. I was at first a bit disappointed he chose the mousse trio, but liked it so much that I didn't leave much for him. Sorry Johnny. Our waiter was very attentive and seemed to know what was going on, which isn't always the case with a new restaurant.  Overall, a nice addition to River North.

The ambiance and service was great, it is really great place to have a nice group dinner before going out for the night... if you're not concerned about the food.  I will concede that maybe we ""ordered wrong,"" but that's such a cop out because there shouldn't be mediocre items on your menu. There were some things on there that looked good but we didn't get. There was the hamachi crudo (yawn), scallops (I'm od'd on those right now), the grilled octopus (just had some). So maybe we missed all the really great stuff... but that just seems wrong. The croquettas were actually not bad, but weren't really hammy enough for my taste. The pork belly bocadillos were okay, but a little too much bread. Patatas bravas were not good. The potatoes on top were inconsistently crispy, and I didn't really like the chorizo (I like chorizo). The crispy cod was okay, just not very exciting at all.  I'm mostly mad at the fact that I came for spanish tapas and what I got was... I'm not really sure what I got. I guess this is a modern take on tapas, and that's fine, but this was the most boring meal I've had in a long time. Maybe I'm traditional.",0.5823,0.757,0.135,0.108,0.6131178856985308

2012-02-16,4.0,"Given I am not a fan of its sister restaurant, Mercadito, - it was a gamble the other night when I suggested Tavernita for a dinner with a close friend.  But that gamble paid off as Tavernita is a fun, contemporary place to grab a drink and a bite to eat! Located in the old Martini Park space at La Salle and Erie- Tavernita is huge and offers a couple of different bars with different attitudes- kind of like the contrast between the classy sister and the the tomboy. The classy sister is the bar at Tavernita, classy, sleek with the music level turned down and tapas available to eat.  The tomboy?  The Barcito bar- a little rough around the edges, music louder and pintxos to nibble on.  We chose to have drinks at Barcito and dinner at Tavernita . . .which turned out to be an excellent choice! The bar was empty when I arrived after work- but by the time my reservation came up at 7:30- this place was hopping!  They have what they call ""kegged"" cocktails which means that their specialty drinks are on a line (try the Booty Collins- or so says my friend!)  I started with my standard martini- but there were a couple of misses- no Grey Goose (I settled for Kettel) and no martini glasses.  Instead- your martini comes in a short cup.  Lost something in the translation for me so I went with a standard cocktail the rest of the night which fared better. We were seated in Tavernita right on time.  Know that the tables are close together so chances are you will have a chance to see what others around you are eating.  Given it is tapas- everything is sharable and know that it is going to come up in any order so don't expect certain courses at a certain time. We ordered a wide range of the menu- oysters and hamemachi from the raw bar, fois gras from the spreads, croquettes, Greg's meatballs, scallops and a shrimp special of the day.  All were good but my favorites were the meatballs (delicious!) and the fois gras (smooth and creamy although it needed two more pieces of toast to go with it!) Service was spot on!  Our server, Chris, so pleasant and helpful- always had an eye on us to see if we needed anything and the bus help kept the tables clear and clean, with fresh plates and utensils quick to show up between pauses.  And  even the hostess staff was pleasant, welcoming and accommodating. If there was a downside- it was that as the night went on- it got pretty loud in the place.  I found myself having to repeat myself several times and my friend was sitting about 2 feet away from me.  But I really think it's part of the ambiance as this is not formal dining- but a causal sharing experience. I found it interesting that none of the ""attitude"", ""rules"" and ""hassles"" that I found at Mercadito, exist here.  Same owners . . . . .hmmm . .maybe I owe Mercadito another try for perhaps this restaurant group has finally found it's Chicago voice.   Dinner for two with drinks and dessert ran about $170 but you can get away with less . . .we were trying a range of things.  Valet parking is available on the Erie side for $12. Tavernita is a fun, lively place, perfect for gathering with friends for a drink and some food.  Check it out!",0.998,0.799,0.167,0.034,0.5127534774593597

PROS: - The decor and mood, very nice. - The service, Excellent - The food, I loved the hell out of it! Loved the lamb sausage! - The drinks, from wine to beer, your in the clear.  I love how it actually is a ""different"" tapas type. they make their own soda, which i though was cool. I think the chef is very creative, and knows how to put things together without being so redundant. It reminds me of the band incubus. Every cd they have come out with sound different, but you still know its incubus. the chef is like incubus. Im a fan of incubus.  Cons: -Close quarters, i feel if they got rid on 1 table in certain areas, there would be enough room for everybody down the booth lines, i don't want to hear the conversations of the people around me. Its annoyingly distracting. - SOME not all dishes were not worth the money. Maybe bring the price down on CERTAIN not ALL dishes or make them slightly bigger portions. ( or give me a bit more space while sitting down and i'l gladly pay the price fro the dish) Its like when you go to the dentist without insurance, so he doesn't use enough anesthetic, cmon man il pay more just make sure this is painless!

I don't understand the fuss about the prices either, we couldn't finish all the food on our table and had a few cocktails per person and it come out to $50 each before tip.  I thought it was a good deal given the quality of the food and vibe of the place, you can easily spend double/triple at some of the neighboring restaurants without blinking an eye.",0.9935,0.784,0.169,0.047,0.5260919540229885

The hype between us is probably the biggest hype we will have had in our lives until Bavette opens. The verdict: opening night was good; the two times since have been great. This is entirely related to the fact that the opening night ran out of the fantastic duck confit flatbread AND the croquetas which are little fried potato balls of the lord. Nothing on the menu holds a candle to the pork belly bocadillos, though, of which you should order 3. For just yourself. Kegged cocktails can be gotten el cheapo if you do the 2 for $12 thing, and I've tried most of them that way - the standout for me is the Turista, which is tequila blanco, brandied cherries and an impressive spike of black pepper syrup. I could drink these all day. I actually like their fancier, ice-less stirred One Thumbed Gypsy too, which is red pepper to the extreme but very good and the right amount of weird. The rest of the kegged ones are good but I haven't repeated any besides Turista.  The concept is cool. The space is a cavern with weirdly close tables but the bar size is really the impressive part. They play a lot of Rodrigo y Gabriela which earns some points for music taste. I never know how to feel about the service, though. It can be... sparse and aloof. On opening night it was fantastic. There isn't a lot of intimacy to be found here, but other than a questionable moment with your croquetas, it isn't trying to inspire intimacy. If you watch closely, chef Ryan Poli, bandana and all, may end up lurking on the floor. If you ask nicely, he'll even take a picture with you and won't ask questions, which is a nice quality to have in an executive chef. The fried cake tastes like a churro puree.

The wine on tap was expensive for what tasted like cheap wine, the food was really good though overpriced, even for the neighborhood - not filling for what was billed as a full entree. The kicker was hair in our croquetas, though the staff was very kind and comped the appetizer.  If you want great tapas, you're better off at Bulleh Dias in Lakeview or even Ba-Ba-Ree-bah, to be honest. If you want to eat in the area, you're better off going to any nearby place in River North - Fogo de Chao was across the street & Wildfire next door.

2012-01-29,4.0,"Tried this place out with a small group on monday jan. 23, which i think may have been an opening night for them. All the food was exceptionally tasty. We shared a variety of ""crudos"": hamachi, ceviche and tuna. The Hamachi was my favorite of those. Of the ""bread""/""pan"" plates the coca de setas was enjoyed by all. I also liked the coca de pato with duck confit, but not everyone agreed on this. after adding brussels sprouts, grilled octopus and pork belly sandwhiches, I felt like my table had sampled most of the menu already (and dropped a lot of money) very quickly. The service and the drink refills came fast and furious, but that was probably because we were the ONLY people there early on a Monday night. Can't complain about attentiveness, but I would have appreciated the hostness not being snooty about not seating our table until we had our full party. (as we had an additional person joining us). I mean c'mon, almost every table was open until we left! So besides the delicious food (if pricey for the portion size), and the ambivalent service, I was mostly befuddled by the ""keg""-served wine. It all tasted great, but you'd think you'd get a price break if they are not cracking the bottled open especially for you. And if you do order a ""bottle"" it comes in a plain glass from the keg, without any label on the bottle or the menu, so you can't be quite sure exactly what you're getting (if you're particular about that sort of thing). All in all a fun place that's a little bit different, with good food to share on a night out with friends. For birthdays: they put a candle on my leche desert. yum! I just recommend pacing yourself and order slowly so you can enjoy your time there.",0.9937,0.8,0.171,0.029,0.5722288359788359

My absolute favorites and must trys were the hamachi, escalivida, croquetas, and greg's meatballs, but the absolute best item on the menu that I can't stop thinking about were the pork belly bacadillos (pork belly sliders). They were so delicious and cooked perfectly. The cocktail that I could not get enough of so I had about 4 of them was the Booty Collins (green tea infused vodka, passion fruit, lemon, cayenne) and it was garnished with a brandy soaked cherry that could get you tipsy all by itself.

2012-01-27,3.0,"Just alright for me, dog. (Randy Jackson voice.) It's basically a more-trendy Cafe Babareeba with seating that is entirely too close to one another.  They are known for their kegged drinks, which range from cocktails, to wine, to sangria. The drinks were pretty outstanding (red wine sangria, booty collins), and definitely a welcomed addition to my 5:30pm need for alcohol. Food was good, but nothing I'm going to dream out. I liked Chef Poli's creations at Perennial more than Tav. The food is served small plates style, here's what we got: -eggplant crostada: favorite of the bunch; goat cheese on top capped it off nicely -scallops: salty and smelled fishy; but the broth it was in was nice -steak tartar: overly peppered, almost inedible; but moist and eggy -patatas: fried with chorizo, and a fried egg?

2012-01-27,4.0,"I've been waiting for Tavernita to open for what seems like forever.  On Facebook when they announced they were taking reservations starting January 12th, I jumped at the opportunity.  I wasn't disappointed. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I had the 3x Wise and Booty Collins at the bar which were recommended by the bartender.  After the second visit, I was hooked on the Booty Collins.  It's fruity, but Cayenne pepper adds a nice heat.  The Turista is the best selling drink, and  the black pepper syrup is great.  Definitely get the little twin - you can try two smaller portions of the kegged cocktails for the price of one. The food was very good. Order in waves, because the dishes come out quickly and at a good pace.  The pork belly bocadillos are the best.  First of all it's pork belly which is always delicious, but then it's served on a pillowy brioche bun with pickled red onions and some awesome apple jam. On the first night they ran out of croquetas, but it was the first day of the soft opening so it was understandable.  On return visits I've eaten a ridiculous amount of croquetas, because they are creamy and delicious.  They're served with saffron aioli that I like to smother all over my croquetas.   My other favorites: Steak tartare- has a nice spiciness  Coca de pato- duck confit flatbread, nom Brussels sprouts- cheesy and good, should be split between more than 2 people Carne del dia- ask what it is, the hanger steak was awesome and the fennel was really good Coca de seta- another flatbread with mushrooms and onions, but the creamy goat cheese makes it awesome Artichoke salad- crunchy artichoke chips, yes Everything I've had here was good. However, I think you could skip ordering the pimientos, ceviche and greg's meatballs, because there are better things to eat at Tavernita. They don't list any desserts on the menu, but ask your waiter about them. They have leche frita which is basically fried cake and is awesome.  I didn't love the pan y chocolat.  Maybe bread and chocolate just isn't my thing, but my friends loved it. Service is usually good, but sometimes falters.  One waitress was really inattentive, but the waiter, Joe, on my fourth visit was seriously awesome.  The decor is cool, but the music can get a bit loud.  The booths are big and very comfortably fit a group of 4, but the rest of the tables are situated close together.",0.9992,0.706,0.267,0.026,0.5888768115942031

2012-01-25,2.0,"I was a little bit disappointed about this place. The decor is nice, but the tables are horribly close together, making you almost claustrophobic. Good: the cocktails were good, we tried three different ones, and they were quiet good (despite me being skeptical about the entire cocktail on tap thing). Service was friendly, too. But the food was just very average. The pork belly slider was nice, but the octopus consisted of a two tiny pieces of octopus, and the rest rucola salad. The taste was pretty much only orange juice. The croquettes had a weird texture, like bread, but the aioli was OK. I did not like the lamb sausage at all, a strange mix of spiciness with sweet and sour flavors. The desert was not worth mentioning, some deep-fried piece of bread (?) in caramel sauce. Not worth the $120 in my opinion. Would not go out of my way to go back.",0.9777,0.695,0.211,0.094,0.5760897435897435
2012-01-24,5.0,"Good food, drinks, ambiance...what more can you ask for! We had a big group here for a friend's birthday last Saturday and got to try a lot of different dishes and drinks. Ambiance: good music, great crowd. They did a really great job in designing the space. It was divided up into smaller areas, with an easy flow between the different areas. There's a lounge space that wasn't open yet. I'm excited to try it out sometime. Drinks: They have kegged cocktails and sangria, which is an interesting idea. I particularly loved the Booty Collins (green tea vodka, passionfruit, lemon, caynne, yohimbe) and the red sangria. My pregnant friend sampled some of the house-made sodas and said they were great. She recommended the ginger chile ale.  Food: Started with the hamachi and tuna crudos - both were fine. The fish was fresh, and the flavors were good. Good staples, but I've had similar dishes elsewhere so I wouldn't necessarily order these again. The pan con burrata and escalivada were delicious and good vegetarian options. The burrata had a great texture. The tomato marmalade was a bit too sweet for my taste, but that's more of a personal preference. I love seasoned eggplant dishes, so the escalivada was right up my alley. The breads were a bit hard to bite through, but that's pretty typical for these bruschetta-type dishes. I really loved the grilled octopus. Tender and flavorful. I don't even usually like olive, but kept going back for the olive tapenade. The patatas with chorizo and fried egg was a fun twist on patatas bravas. I particularly loved the fried egg. HIGHLIGHTS: Greg's meatballs and pork belly bocadillos. The meatballs had this great sauce on it. The bocadillos were out of this world - these are basically pork belly sliders. great flavor and the pickled red onions offered good contrast to the richness of the pork. I didn't make it to the chicken a la brasa - way too full, but I heard from others at the table that it was good as well. I can't wait to go back and try out some other dishes, like the scallops and the brussel sprouts. I definitely recommend this place, but make a reservation soon - I think they'll be harder to get pretty soon.",0.9986,0.731,0.253,0.016,0.5361552028218696

2012-01-22,3.0,"I imagine Tavernita is packed on a Friday or Saturday night.  I like the decor -- on the whole (but like many places the seating is way too close together, and I'm not sure what is with the 70s looking square things on part of the ceiling).  Our waitress, Morgan, was super-helpful; maybe too helpful to us and others, as the restaurant got busier as it seemed that she could have been more focused then.  There seem to be communication problems between the kitchen and the waitresses (about timing of food in particular).  I was skeptical of the idea of cocktails ""on tap"" , but these were tasty (and I like the idea of being able to have two mini cocktails for $12). However, while the cocktails were certainly tasty, they didn't seem too have much of a kick.  The pork belly dish was delicious (the best item we tasted--sort of served as if they were mini-burgers).  The croquettes were so so (I liked the aoli though).  The octopus was also so so (seemed too citrus-y) .  I liked the lamb sausage.  For desert, we had the caramel ice-cream dish.  It was okay, but the taste and textures didn't really work well.    For Spanish-influenced food, I felt that there should have been more flavor (most of the food seemed a little bland).  Aside from helpful-Morgan, I did appreciate the bussing staff, who were very attentive.  My general impression is that Tavernita has the makings of a very interesting restaurant, but they need to work more on the menu and on communication issues between staff.",0.9902,0.816,0.157,0.026,0.5696514837819187
2012-01-22,4.0,"Ventured to Tavernita to kick-off a girls night. I had high expectations and wasn't disappointed. We did have a short wait even though we had reservations, but the ambiance and people watching kept us company. The space is very crowded, each table and booth closely together. I'm very intrigued by the bar in the front room, it has separate doors that closes it off so I wonder if you get a different feel in there.  We ordered a range of drinks, I had the white sangria and I didn't have complaints. A few of the others ordered the mixed drinks from the bar and everyone seemed to enjoy them. Wine comes in three sizes.  We started by ordering one tapas per person- the tuna, steak tartare, tomato burrata, mushroom flatbread, meatballs and the chicken. While I'm not a fan of raw things, but the other four items were delish! The chicken was ridiculously moist, had a ton of flavor and was great for sharing. Runner up was the burrata, toasts with a sweet tomato spread and mozzarella/ricotta mixture on top. Our only mistake was ordering the dessert that were three small toasts, chocolates and sea salt on top. Way too salty.  Finally, the service. I was weary coming so close to the opening, but they were very prompt and helpful. There did seem to be quite a bit of commotion and multiple staff running around, but their interaction with us was pleasant. My last comment is simply about the music- I understand that it's a a very club-like restaurant but the music volume was so loud we couldn't hear our waiter half the time.  I'd definitely go back for drinks, would eat there again if in a smaller group. Hope it does well!",0.9887,0.819,0.146,0.036,0.4885525412087913
2012-01-20,4.0,"The first thing that struck me about Tavernita was the gorgeous decor. Warm brown tones with gold accents create a very warm and inviting experience. Love the seating, it's very open and wide so you don't feel as if you're sitting on top of anyone. They've utilized the massive space in a really great way making you feel cozy yet uncramped. The bar area is also spacious; you can mingle with friends while you wait but not hover over other diners. I saw another reviewer complain about the music level and I have to say they must have taken note because I barely noticed it when I was there which is a good thing; you can hear it but it doesn't drown out your conversation.     The service is great. The hostesses were gracious and speedy; our waiter was knowledgeable with good recommendations and explained the menu in a detailed way without sounding like he was talking down to us (a bad habit some servers have a tendency to pick up). The food was good; the steak tartare is incredibly delicious and well-presented. The hamachi was also very tasty but as my friend pointed out, the presentation was poor and looked like leftovers. The coca de pato was yummy but the duck a little dry. I absolutely loved the meatballs--by far my favorite. Soft, tender and an explosion of flavors. The brussels sprouts were equally delicious and rank now as my 2nd favorite veggie dish in the city (after Girl & the Goat's green beans). The corn pudding was recommended by our waiter and we were definitely pleased with it. I had the Turista cocktail and it was divine; the tequila they use is smooth and easy to drink.      I went with a friend but we noticed several groups of girlfriends as well as a few couples on dates so it's got a good mix and a nice spot for different occasions.

2012-01-18,4.0,"This place is going to be big. Even during its soft opening, there were still not a bad amount of people in it (and at 10PM), plus did I mention that the crowd was legitimately cool...already. Make reservations now for March. The décor of this place is awesome--the tile, the murals (besides the weird chess one; can someone please explain...), the ceilings--and makes it both a cool dining destination as well as a place to go out on a Saturday night. That is also helped by the unique and cool music (with touches of pop indie music circa 2007 - not a bad thing), accessible (but confused) menu, cheap wine, and giant space (bar, lounge, dining). Last night however, my brother and I were there for the food and the drinks. First the drinks: INCREDIBLE. True I am a vermouth-obsessed person; however, the vermouth on tap (our waitress (who was fun, knowledgeable, and engaging) really nicely brought us over the sweet vermouth to try) was incredible. The second best drink of the night was the Turista with tequila blanco, preserved cherries, grapefruit, black pepper syrup, lime, and bbq bitters. It was well-balanced and giant. We also tried the sangria, which was a little sweet for my taste, and the one-thumbed gypsy which was good. I will definitely come back for the Spanish beer and more cocktails. As for the food, as I said before, the menu is [consciously] confused. It has both Latin and Spanish staples. The plates definitely don't go together, but when eaten and reviewed separately, are quite delicious. The two favorites of the night were the Escalivada (eggplant red peppers, hazelnut romesco, and goat cheese) and the vegetarian patatas bravas with egg. One thing I LOVE as a pescatarian, is that Tavernita symbolizes on the menu which menu items can be made vegetarian. Awesome. As for the other items: Oyster cocktail (Samish bay pickled oyster, mango, papaya, poached shrimp, and jalapeno relish) - big portion, unique, and tasty. I may not get it again if I went but you should upon first visit. Hamachi (avocado, lime, jalapeno chili, cucumber) - interesting/weird texture (creamy with the avocado), but fresh and good flavor. Green bean salad (celery, white anchovies, crispy shallots) - perfect amount of dressing and a must for any anchovy fan; a perfect crunch on the green beans too. Pimientos de pardon (blistered peppers, sherry vinegar, maldon salt) - unbalanced taste (maybe too much sherry vinegar) and not cooked enough. Grilled octopus (fennel, oranges, olive tapenade) - really tasty, tender, and a great sauce. ASIDE: I was struggling between rating this restaurant a 4 or a 5 so just know if there was a 4.5 option, that is what I would have given",0.9969,0.819,0.164,0.016,0.521818181818182

But still, let's be clear about two things: I rarely go out in River North, and I am very picky when it comes to tapas.  I'm going to cut them some slack because my girlfriends were completely enthralled with the entire experience and, like I said, I was a little tough when I wrote this review the day after out experience.  A couple of the things that turned me off were that they wouldn't seat us when 2/3 of our party were at the restaurant (side note: there were maybe two other tables seated in the entire restaurant), there was a constant draft from the door, and the portion of food (considering the price) was scant. To be fair, the flavor in the ceviche was phenomenal, and the croquetas and the lamb sausage were my ideal comfort foods. I would highly recommend doing the half tastes of the cocktails, because they have a lot of great options and just trying one isn't enough. I just don't feel like it was enough food for the price (but refer to my disclaimer at the beginning of the review). The service was impeccable (although they definitely try to up-sell) and both servers and bus boys were incredible knowledgeable.

2012-01-12,5.0,"I really dig what the Meracadito guys have done here with the talent of Ryan Poli at the helm! The kegged cocktails are refreshing a quite unlike any I have had before.  The fruity fresh flavors integrate quite well along side the house-made bitters. It brings a new level of freshness that is difficult to accomplish on a regular basis (the kegging supposedly prevents oxidization.) I personally was quite enamoured with the kegged sweet vermouth. Made in-house as well, this was on par with carpano on ice. Not an easy feat. The food at Tavernita is rockin' as well for those who enjoy shared plates. Every dish we had tonight was excellent and I would be psyched to order again. But if I had to pick two favorites it would have been the hamachi crudo and the steak tartare. The space is rather large but divided into numerous small areas - most with specific purposed.  One of these is a yet-to-open stand-and-eat pintxo bar, Barcito, you can see from the outer windows.
