2014-10-19,3.0,"D'Vine has opened and closed so many times I'm not even sure how to rate this place.  10 years ago it was one of the better clubs in the city.  But just like most clubs in Chicago, promoters eventually ruin a good thing.  It's reopened now for the 57th time and doesn't seem to have the large following it had before, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess. On Tuesdays, I believe they have Reggae night and on Thursdays it's an on going Thursday Night Football special.  So if you are looking cheap food (50 cent wings, $2 burgers, etc) and are in the area, it's a good spot to stop by.",0.8791,0.81,0.136,0.054,0.512962962962963
2014-02-04,1.0,"This place in my opinion belongs in Detroit or some other ghetto hood. My friend and I walked in here and upon entering, we needed to be pat down to check for weapons. If this is the way you need to enter a Wicker Park club, well... I suggest a different location where you won't fear for your life.",0.4456,0.856,0.096,0.048,0.4212962962962963
2008-01-06,1.0,"After Pint, we headed over to D'Vine, we were able to get in for free but thinking back, they should of paid us for going!  Sausage fest and dark.  D'Vine is one big room with a bar in the middle.  One thing I like to do is people watch but it was too dark.  So, during one of the songs, they had some stroll lights where we were able to see some folks and our entire group was like ""keep it dark keep it dark"" - then we left!",0.8494,0.9,0.1,0.0,0.3645833333333333
2007-10-08,4.0,"YES!  YES, YES YES!! My friend and I had been talking about making our way to D'Vine for a late night of ghetto dancing.  We finally made it. AMAZING!  All the booty you could ever want in one place.   Downsides:  $20 cover for guys, super-expensive drinks, and they change the song every 15 seconds.  WTF? But go there and get your dance on!!  Whoop whoop!",0.9607,0.659,0.287,0.054,0.875
