2006-09-21,2.0,"Square Kitchen is under new ownership - yikes! Gone are old favorites Red Oak and Pear Salad, Lobster Club, Lobster Martini, Mac and Cheese, the bisques, etc. The new menu is typical boring, overpriced noveau riche chow; postage stamp-sized ahi ""bites"" that break the $10 range, overpriced entrees, underwhelming everything. The booze menu is the same, but who cares? Unfortunate!",0.2105,0.819,0.097,0.084,0.46676136363636367
2006-09-10,4.0,"I have always had a pleasant dinning experience at Square Kitchen. I haven't been to Square Kitchen for the past 6 months, but my meal tonight was delicious. My entree was a sauteed Lake Superior Whitefish. It was light, fresh and the perfect portion. My two complaints are that the top of my creme brulee was not burnt enough (but the strawberries on it were FABULOUS!!!) and  I wish the music wasn't so load.",0.9751,0.666,0.295,0.039,0.7316666666666667
2006-08-21,4.0,"I think this place has some real potential. The restaurant itself has a really cool vibe. When you walk in you know it is upscale, but yet feel comfortable enough to be wearing jeans. They have a great wine selection, martini list, and some very affordable scotch. We had a wide variety of food ranging from Ahi-Tuna to the Portabella Sandwich, to the tomatoe and mozzarella appetizer. The only thing lacking was the service. They were short staffed. Everyone was nice, they just didn't have enough people to service the customers.",0.9485,0.842,0.158,0.0,0.6545454545454545
2006-07-17,3.0,"Not a bad place has potential. But needs work.  First time i went here i had a great potato crusted Tilapia fillet, and i was over all happy with the place.  My recent visits have been a little on the bummer side. IN a nut shell.  I know this may sound strange but it is true. The Acoustics in this place are HORRIBLE you have a hard time hearing people at your own table but those across the room are in your face clear. Annoying.  I have found that this affect is far worse in the front area so try to get seated in the back area.",-0.7945,0.728,0.102,0.17,0.6180555555555556
2006-06-03,4.0,"This is my safe restaurant.  I know the food will always be good.  I go there regularly for brunch and dinner.  Try the lobster martini, all salads, ahi tuna with avocado, burgers (the bun does fall apart), side of fries or mac & cheese.   I don't recommend the pasta dishes or the lobster club.",0.5705,0.856,0.106,0.038,0.3923076923076923
2006-06-02,4.0,"Regarding Brunch: I've been here 4 times.  Each time unsatisfied while looking at the brunch menu, but also each time I was completely content with whatever I ordered and totally satisfied and full. THE best creme fresh.  THE most amazing hollandaise.  Seriously",0.9534,0.591,0.332,0.077,0.6020833333333334
2006-02-22,4.0,"YUM. I had the Ahi Tuna with snap pea pods and a delicious Pinot Grigio. Habibi had the Sirloin Steak with red wine sauce, and garlic mashed potatoes. All delicious.  Our server was charming but unobtrusive. This restaurant has a great bar, and is v. well designed. Nice, casual place!",0.9665,0.649,0.351,0.0,0.8023809523809524
2005-11-28,3.0,Decent group place for brunch - they have the comfort food such as their mac n' cheese - service is decent and the wait is decent.,0.3612,0.902,0.098,0.0,0.6249999999999999
2005-08-10,4.0,"Great place to have a nice brunch. Very crowded, so expect to wait for a table unless you get there early. The staff isn't friendly, but I think they're just really busy. The banana french toast is a must have. As for the dinner menu, it is just mediocre. Not much to it.",0.3891,0.88,0.085,0.035,0.4833333333333333
2005-07-20,3.0,"Square Kitchen is a casual place to grab brunch or dinner in Lincoln Square. The interior has a modern, yet comfortable feel, and cool artwork on the walls. The prices seem a little high, especially considering that you have to order sides separate from entrees. The portion sizes are big enough to share, so there's always hope for lunch leftovers. The bananas foster chocolate brownie was excellent! The wait staff is also very friendly. My only complaint was that it tends to get a little loud and felt like I had to yell across the table to talk to my friend.",0.9711,0.753,0.227,0.019,0.6271111111111111
