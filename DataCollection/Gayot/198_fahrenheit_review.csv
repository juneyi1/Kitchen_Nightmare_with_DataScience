2011-03-21,1.0,"Fahrenheit is now closed, apparently for good. Call Saturday morning and phone was disconnected. Walked over there and all signs are gone and inside looks taken apart. Sorry to see it go.",0.3818,0.877,0.085,0.038,0.5125
2011-02-25,3.0,"Although fahrenheit opened last August, it is still a work in progress. They are using 2 menus, which add up to quite a few items to choose from. Christopher and I ordered in two distinct directions. He chose a corned beef hash skillet and I chose pork with a ""spicy"" mushroom sauce.  The skillet was good, but not great. They use canned hash which is ok, but will certainly not help to tack on extra stars. We have canned hash at other places we like, but they are not places that seem to have the same aspirations as fahrenheit.  My meal was decent though the meat was rather tough and over cooked. I had my choice of two sides. I chose mashed potatoes which were home made, but seriously under-seasoned and asparagus. It was not bad, but I did kind of wish I had ordered something else. The salad that came with the meal was quite ordinary and uninspired.  My criticisms sound harsh, but in truth I want to come back and eat here again down the road to see how things shake out. I think they want to be all things to all people right now and because of that they are missing the mark. They need to scale back their menu(s) and perfect the things they do well.  One last thing ... they really need to get some art or plants or something to cheer up what is now a rather stark grim interior. With a bit of color and a more focused menu, this place could have potential. I wish them well.",0.9599,0.749,0.16,0.091,0.4858934971838198
2010-12-21,2.0,"The server was courteous and the decor was welcoming, but I think the chef needs to go back to cooking school.  I ordered eggs over easy with corned beef hash, which came with toast and hash browns and coffee.  Both the eggs and hash browns were undercooked.  Will not be returning to Fahrenheit.",0.7876,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.6111111111111112
2010-12-01,4.0,"I never see this place very busy when I walk by, so I really hope it sticks around.  Great sandwiches & fries, yummy tuna salad & cheeseburgers, excellent, huge breakfasts.  We've eaten in and carried out and been pleased both ways.  It's nice having a simple diner in the area.  Definitely give this place a chance.",0.9785,0.594,0.406,0.0,0.6774603174603174
2010-11-21,4.0,"Good cheap breakfast!  Pancakes are typical and delicious. Bacon crispy and salty. Bacon Omelet with swiss was as amazing as it sounds. Hash browns need to be browned much more though ( I suppose you could ask to crisp/brown them more) - better with added salt, pepper and hot sauce. Toast was somehow really delicious and their diet coke better than most fountains.  Friendly service, well cooked, not overly greasy, well priced.  I like this place a lot better than A&T Grill down the street, way cheaper and better food. Give this place some business! Accepts credit cards. Yay!",0.9918,0.637,0.363,0.0,0.6149305555555555

2010-06-28,4.0,"New breakfast place. We went on Saturday morning. Had pancakes and eggs. The pancakes were huge and tasty even a little bit sweet.  My wife had a skillet with hasbrowns, and vegis. She really enjoyed her meal as well. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Even brought my son some lolipops. They have a big menu. The only downside was the coffee was a bit weak for my liking.  We will be back as its a nice new addition to the neighborhood.",0.9262,0.737,0.21,0.053,0.5987762237762237

2010-06-12,5.0,"Great breakfast. This place just open on Clark just south of Morse. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner. Typical dinner food and just what this area needs. Nice atmosphere, fairly good server but the food was great and inexpensive. The cook knows what he is doing.",0.9011,0.777,0.223,0.0,0.6833333333333332
