I dont know what is going on in the kitchen, but no explanation was given by our server. Strike two was not having mussels anymore for a Friday night then when we asked for wine glasses, we got champagne flutes instead. Wow!  Not having enough wine glasses in a BYOB restaurant is just unbelievable!!   The food we ordered were very good. The salmon was well seasoned and the paste dishes were delicious.  After dinner, they gave us our check receipt. We asked the waitress that we would like to try some desserts and the reply was ""We dont have any more desserts"". That  is weird because the restaurant is not even too crowded. So, one of my friends ordered a small coffee and guess what happened next? Our waitress literally took our check and added an extra $2 dollars! I think at that point, they could have comp the coffee after all these mishaps for the night. Overall, I just find the whole dining experience horrible.

I decided on the spaghetti dish and when I got the dish, the serving size looked like it was for a child. It was $12 for this tiny bowl of spaghetti, while the table next to us received their meals and their dishes were over flowing with pasta. Not cool...strike two.  The whole time we were sitting there eating the whole restaurant was filled with smoke from the kitchen. This place is tiny and I can understand once in awhile something might go wrong in the kitchen and the smoke overflows into the eating area, but this was insane. It was actually getting hard to breathe in there and it started bothering our eyes. Strike three.  When we got our bill we saw the $4.00 corkage fee. We had opened two bottles of wine so we were charged $8.00 for opening those. That was kind of a shocker. I can understand a one time charge for the corkage fee, but for each bottle!

My wife and I decided to eat here last night (it was New Year's Eve).  We live in the neighborhood and didn't want to drive anywhere with all the drunks on the road. We arrived at 7, and there were very few diners.  I ordered the veal parm, and my wife had the lasagna. We asked for bread, and the waitress told us they didn't get their delivery, so they had no bread - in an Italian restaurant on New Year's Eve!  We didn't complain, but my wife looked at all the reserved tables and said, Couldn't they just pick some up at the Jewel??? Our food came in bowls - definitely a surprise - and was bad.  BAD.  The veal parm looked like they had boiled some spaghetti, threw on some sauce, an topped it with a piece of veal that they took out of the freezer, precooked and  frozen, and nuked it with a little cheese.  And my wife's lasagna had some hard, dried out piece of noodle, and was passable at best. When the waitress first asked how everything was, I lied and said fine.  But when she came back, I told her that I don't like to complain, but it was really bad.  The look on her face told us that she knew, and felt bad about it.  To her credit, she took $20 off the bill (we didn't ask for anything) and looked sufficiently chastised, so I left her a decent tip. Haven't been here for a while, probably since last summer, and had decent to good food before.  Hope it's not in its death throes - I get the feeling that they're trying to survive - because with good food, a better menu selection, and better prices (my $20 veal parm looked like the stuff I can buy for $8.99 at any number of local diners) - they could really be successful.",0.9884,0.73,0.182,0.088,0.4299141414141413

"" I'm updating it today to reflect my experience last night at Adesso. I had been to Adesso at least once ever 2 months since I moved to Lakeview, but last night will make my visits far more infrequent.   Ambiance: For some reason the lights were much brighter than they usually are, to the point of a cafeteria like environment.  The EQ on the sound system was so muddy and the treble was turned down so far, it felt like the speakers were from the 60s and all you could hear was the dull thud of the beat. Food: I ordered the same delicious Spaghetti Arabiatta with Shrimp that I always do, IMHO it is the best thing on the menu.  For some crazy reason, it came in a bowl instead of the large saucer it used to.  Same with my partner's food.  This is fine if you're eating just noodles, but to maneuver your fork and knife to remove shrimp tails, it just makes it difficult.  Worryingly, I believe the change to the bowl is to camouflage the fact that the portions are getting smaller.  When our kind waitress brought over Parmesan cheese, I was sort of mortified to find that it was the odious pre-grated kind that you can shake out of a green Kraft tin.  I'm certain that in every single one of my prior visits, they shaved the cheese tableside onto the dish.  That was pretty much the 'ick' moment for me.

2010-11-14,2.0,"Three of my friends and I went to Adesso for an out-of-body brunch experience this morning.  Since then, I have had dinner and three snacks, but I'm still processing my midday meal.  Nothing was overly wrong with it, but a lot wasn't *quite* right with it.  This is the second time we've been to Adesso.  Both times we've found the food to be decent, but the service is pretty hit or miss.  We all live in the neighborhood and will probably eventually be back.  We're brunch folks; rotation is necessary.  We used a groupon, with which we had no problem. I've only been to Adesso for brunch on the weekend.  Both times, there's been one person working the front.  This seems fine as it's pretty much always pretty empty.  Today's person committed a few faux pas: 1.) She wasn't sure what they were out of.   We were told that they MIGHT have pancakes, but they might not.  She didn't seem to think we'd like a definitive answer on this one.  When specifically asked, she asked the chef and reported back that if someone wanted pancakes he could make batter.  (Someone did want pancakes; that is why we asked.  The batter was made and the pancakes were pretty good.  Unfortunately, they also came out about 75% of the way through our meal.  Fortunately, the pancake eater ordered other food too.)    2.) One thing they WERE out of was orange juice.  Actually, any juice.  Oh, and milk.  Would we like some water or soda to drink?  This is 12:30 on a Sunday.  They opened at 11am.  Dear golly.  This is not okay.  This means black coffee and no mimosas.  The server followed up the ""out of juice"" info with a prompt offer to ""send someone up the street to the store to buy some juice"" but seriously?  Why are you telling us that you are out of OJ and milk if you can easily get some?  It is not impressive and causes concern.  The mark-up on juice is huge.  Send someone out to get it and then gouge us on the bill.  Ideally, don't run out of juice during brunch, but I understand things happen. 3.) We were at Adesso for 75-90 minutes.  During this time, two random kids (one high-school aged, the other elementary-school aged) came in and went table-to-table selling candy.  I was not okay with this.  First, I hate being hit up on the train or street.  I definitely do not want it to happen while I'm dining.  Second, um, shouldn't we be encouraged to buy food from the restaurant?  Far from asking them to leave, the only person who purchased anything was the server. 4.) The bathroom was not gross, but it was less than clean and smelled a bit like yeast.  There were table napkins instead of paper towels.  It is very dimly lit.  Pee before you go. In general, the service at Adesso tends to be slow, but it's fine if you are not in a rush and want to linger with friends.  I have never felt like I was being pushed out the door.  The food is consistent and good, but not great.  It's BYOB and the prices are reasonable.  In general, it feels to me like it has yet to find its grove.  As someone who lives in the neighborhood and can only go to Joy's and Ann Sather's so often, I'm hoping Adesso figures things out.",0.9918,0.794,0.134,0.071,0.573174603174603

We were seated promptly and politely, and our server quickly took our drink and Antipasti order. Not sure if there were specials - I thought I heard our waiter rattle off some dishes to a nearby table.  We ordered the traditional Bruschetta (there was a fancier version that also sounded interesting) and the calamari. Both were visually appealing, but I felt that both lacked some basic seasoning. The only actual flavor in the bruschetta was the fresh basil - the Parmesan lacked bite and the tomatoes were pretty neutral. The calamari was well prepared, but the accompanying cocktail sauce added little to the dish.  The main courses also looked great and were great in concept but lacked seasoning. My fusilli had great components - sausage, peas, tomato cream - but the fennel in the sausage was too subtle and the sauce needed pepper. As for my friend's dish, the flavors in the gnocchi were initially delicate, but the textural similarity between the pasta and butternut squash gave the dish a very one-sided feel. I know that many of these problems could be remedied by adding salt and pepper, but neither seasoning was on the table. I assume that if a restaurant doesn't put salt and pepper on the table, the chef has seasoned the food to their liking and I shouldn't have to alter it.

We've lived in Lakeview for a year and always walked past Adesso but never tried it until last week. First of all, the service was outstanding! Our waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and really helpful when it came to deciding among the many delicious-sounding main courses. We started off with the calamari which was decent but a bit rubbery. Complete 180 when the main courses came! My husband's cioppino was fantastic - the risotto was perfectly cooked and they definitely did not skimp on the seafood. My fettuccine alla carbonara was also perfectly cooked and the cream sauce was exactly what I wanted! The best part? We came away from a great al fresco Italian date night for under $35. Gotta love BYOB! Would definitely recommend Adesso to my Lakeview neighbors.",0.997,0.686,0.314,0.0,0.4836666666666667

I have been singing praises about your fabulous food and sleek interior designs since I first laid eyes on your gnocchi, but I think I'm going to have to shut up for a while until your wait staff gets their cabooses in order and your bathroom gets a better drainage system.  The night before the pride parade, the boy and I came here for some bubbly and yummy Italian. We were seated by the door (not the greatest seat in the house but whatev, we'll take it) and that's when everything started going downhill. - No one came by to open our wine or give us glasses for 20+ minutes. Eventually we pulled a McGuyver and opened it ourselves. -Our waitress was all over us like white on rice for the first half of the meal (equally annoying to not being served at all I tell ya), and then pulled an Amelia Earhart for the second half and fell off the face of the earth. -Our over-sized appetizer plate wasn't cleared even after our entrees arrived. And those are tiny tables. -We waited and waited... and waited more just to receive our bill when we were itching to cross the street to Phoebe's Cupcakes.  -The co-ed restroom had two inches of water around the drain.

I think Jeff K. said it best - the food we had at Adesso was just mediocre.  It wasn't bad food by any means.  It was just middle of the road.  If I'm paying $13 for a plate of gnocchi, then I want to go somewhere and get really good gnocchi, not settle for mediocre gnocchi. If you're looking for a quick yet satisfying meal, this is your place, mainly because I've never seen the restaurant anywhere close to capacity.  If you're looking for a really good Italian meal then I would recommend going elsewhere.",0.9863,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.5461538461538461
2010-06-25,5.0,"Last night my hubby and I wandered down Broadway looking for a place to have a nice dinner, sit outside, and, since it was Thursday after all, drink some vino. Since Wakamono and Ping Pong were packed (and wouldn't let us drink our wine outside) we decided to eat at Adesso. I had never been, but was always curious.  Since the moment we walked up it was a very enjoyable dining experience. The hostess was very pleasant and friendly (a nice change from the pushy and bad attitude ones at the surrounding restaurants.) There was a small wait for a table outside, but we decided to stay. The wait ended up being a little longer than promised, but the hostess came up to on a few different occasions to let us know some tables had cashed out but were just hanging around. She also let us know that she has a reservation for 4 outside, so if we see her seat another table before us, that's why.  Hostesses of the world take note, little things like this makes a huge difference. Simply being friendly and acknowledging my existence goes a long way.  Once seated, we ordered fried calamari as an appetizer which was very good, but in all honesty its hard to mess this one up. For dinner, I had the Lasagna and my husband ordered the braised short ribs. I don't normally order lasagna, but it sounded good for some reason. It wasn't groundbreaking, but it was 100% delicious, and there was a lot of it.  The braised short rib dish was to die for. It was on a heavenly bed of polenta. Seriously, I don't think I've had better. All said and done we got out of there with a $50 bill for a meal I would have paid a lot more for. The service was good, and I never felt rushed, which, as we all know, is very is rare for a BYO place.  I am giving Adesso 5 stars because for what it is, it's great. Does it have perfect ambiance or culinary mastery? Maybe not, but I had a great meal and dining experience. If you are looking for a casual yummy meal, I whole heartedly recommend it. For the people who wrote less than stellar reviews, I encourage you to grab a bottle of wine and give it a second go! And order better this time :) One tiny recommendation, Adesso, a candle and little flower on each table would do wonders.",0.9984,0.731,0.228,0.041,0.5199173280423282

The waitress was really nice and attentive in the beginning, but after we put in our orders, the service went a bit downhill. The butter that came out with the bread tasted really old. Then our appetizer came out at the same time as our entrees. I don't understand why since it was just bruschetta. We ordered a steak entree and asked for it to be cooked medium-- it came out very well done, burned, and dry. It could hardly be cut with a knife.  When we told the waitress it was not how we ordered it, she said she would tell the cook: ""it was not to your liking"". I expected that another steak would be coming the way we ordered it, but it never came.  Our waitress came back to check up on us and we reminded her about the steak's bitter taste, and she said ""I told the chef about it and he's sorry"" and then she left. Alright, an ""apology"" from the chef does not improve our meal.  At any restaurant I've ever been to, the staff has always offered a replacement or fixed a meal that is not prepared well, even Denny's for goodness sake!  So at a restaurant where you pay $17-18 an entree, you expect your food to come out the way your ordered it. Our other entree, salmon, was mediocre-- it tasted rather strongly of fish.  I'm glad we had a groupon because if I had to pay full price for this meal I would have been beside myself.  Don't go to this overpriced and subpar joint.

She comes back to inform me , although it is not clarified on the menu, the ""basil"" in this panini is actually ""basil oil"". Weird. So anywho since i wanted basil and was mislead by the menu she brought me a side of basil to put on my sammich. To sum it all up everything tasted underwhelming.

2010-06-07,5.0,"While we have dined at Adesso for casual dinners with friends, and birthday dinners with medium (10-12 person) groups in the past, this review is based on our recent experience hosting our wedding's rehearsal dinner here. When we began our search for a venue to host our rehearsal dinner, it looked like it would be an uphill battle from the start.  Most restaurants, upon hearing the words ""wedding"" or ""rehearsal dinner,"" would just slap down a dollar minimum for our event.  This was before hearing how many guests, what we wanted to serve, etc.   When we called Adesso and spoke with Dave and Trish, they immediately stood in stark contrast to every other place with whom we had spoken.  Their first question was about how we envisioned the night to be--just appetizers, family style, seated dinner??  Their second question was, how many people did we anticipate, and what budget did we want to keep the meal under?   We ended up electing to do a seated dinner with a limited menu.  Our guests were treated to passed appetizers, given a choice between 2 salad options, and lastly got to select an entree from 4 choices.  As Adesso is BYOB, we brought in wine for the tables (they even let us drop it off early so that they could chill the white down before dinner).  The result of all this was that the cost of the dinner came in UNDER budget, and I think the quality of the food, service, and event far exceeded what we would have received even if we had plunked down the many thousands of dollars in advance guarantees other restaurants in the city wanted.   One last point of note, in the course of planning the wedding when we provided Adesso with our final count for the rehearsal dinner, we forgot to count ourselves.  On top of this, some out of town guests who had not RSVP'd showed up for the dinner to our (pleasant) surprise.  Despite suddenly needing to accommodate more guests, and the miscount being our fault, Trish didn't bat an eye but simply had the staff create additional table space and seating for us and our guests.  That to me was truly professional, and a quality that is increasingly rare in the hospitality industry.   Thanks Dave, Trish, and the staff at Adesso for helping us kick off our wedding weekend with such a successful dinner!",0.9688,0.911,0.073,0.016,0.4364583333333333

2010-04-02,1.0,"I've been to Adesso a few times and it's the kind of place that serves food that's just average enough that I'll forget about my experience the prior time 6 months later when I'm contemplating going back. Enter last night.  Beautiful night, they had tables out and it's early in the warm season.  We opted to eat there instead of Nookies, who also had tables out.  They were very nice to put 'rogue' tables out for the people who were wanting to eat out. But apparently they didn't have the staff to support it (even though there were maybe 5 tables occupied total in the whole restaurant).  I'm willing to overlook all service issues because of this, but not food.   The calamari was straight out of the deep freeze and you could taste it.  After about two bites it wasn't worth eating any more for fear of food poisoning.  Our bus boy took it, but our server must have seen it in the kitchen sitting because 10 minutes later he brought it back, confused if we had gotten it or not. I ordered the fusilli with sausage.  It was passable. Had I just had that and nothing else I probably would've left thinking I had another barely average meal.  But then again, what I was served wasn't actually even close to fusilli, it was a thick straight egg noodle.   My other half ordered a spaghetti.  He ate about two bites and insisted I try. It ruined our meal.  It was unquestionably the most disgusting pasta I have ever tasted at a restaurant.  You know that fake sauce taste that Chef Boyardee canned pasta has?  It tasted *exactly* like that, and I truly wish I was saying that to be funny, but I'm not.  I didn't really like that as a kid, and I wouldn't expect any restaurant to be serving anything resembling it 20 years later. Our server didn't bother to ask us once how anything was.   I'm guessing every person he asked previously in the night told them their honest opinion and he gave up on asking.  He didn't offer us bread, didn't offer us Parmesan.  The table next to us was going on and on about how bad their food was.  I feel even worse for the table on the other side of us who felt this place was worthy of bringing an expensive bottle of Turley to the table. Not only were their tables set up illegally (which I don't really care about), they allowed BYOB on their sidewalk cafe.  This is completely illegal in Chicago.  I partook--why wouldn't I... but ignoring the rules gives them an unfair advantage over the other nearby restaurants who all DO follow the laws.  More importantly Adesso's breaking the law on this matter just confuses the general public who later whine to the restaurants next door when they're not allowed BYOB outside because those places follow the law. Also, they charge a $4 corkage fee which is also illegal. And for a place without a liquor license, a per bottle price is an absurd fee. It's pretty sad when we're upset for not choosing the diner down the street.  $50 for food that any fast food place could easily beat, fail Adesso. P.S., Adesso has been practicing bad Yelp habits.  They've went out of their way to message threatening violence. And our waiter just posted a fake review, only he failed to leave out HIS PICTURE of his fake review?  After checking my receipt, he even used his real name for his fake review.  See attached business pictures for the scan.   P.P.S., since posting the above the owner has TWO months later apparently checked his Yelp reviews and messaged me on here threatening me.  A direct quote from Dr David J himself (who himself has a fake review of Adesso up...): ""Go fuck yourself u piece of shit--or come in and have the nerve to speak to me directly--PLEASE!"" ... Unfortunately judging by so many poor reviews here and terrible food, he's probably a ""phone in"" owner/manager or I'd be able to do so.   Hey guy, take your teal BMW and drive it back to the burbs for good.  Please. P.P.P.S, as proof that the staff of Adesso has reviewed their own restaurant I uploaded an image of said review as well as the copy of my receipt with the same waiter's name as the reviewer. Yelp HQ unfortunately found this irrelevant even though the fake reviews of Adesso are still up and not filtered by them.",-0.998,0.759,0.079,0.162,0.515079365079365
2010-04-01,1.0,"So I had this idea.  Rent a restaurant space on a hot corner, throw some tables outside, hire bad help (with the exception of the busser who will be the most helpful person in the restaurant) and then serve Chef Boyardee to a bunch of gays and trixies with bottles of Charles Shaw that were turned away from Pingpong and Wakamono due to long waits. Then I realized Adesso had already worked that concept, so I decided I'd go work for a software company instead.  Our server wore a gray pullover hoodie with casual blue jeans.  He looked like he was going to the gym to shoot some hoops, not work as a server.  He disappeared for 20-30 minutes at a time into the kitchen, so I'm quite sure he was working the can opener for Boyardee's sous chef.  He took our neighboring table's order prior to ours.  They got their food 25 minutes after I was served some sweet tasting, aluminum-y ""Spaghetti Arrabiata"".  The menu promised capers and olives along with spaghetti in a spicy sauce.  Yep, 4 capers and 6 olives.  And I'm quite certain I've already described the sauce.  Wow, that was bad.  I tried to get the server's attention 2 or 3 times to get some Parmesan to no avail.   Let's take a step back for a second though.  Let's talk about the ""Grilled Calamari"".  Ever chewed on fishy tasting rubberbands?  No?  Well, here's your chance.   SO had the fusilli which, to me, tasted weird.  Eggy and weird.  Sadly, the best thing I tasted.  I'll let him describe that, though.  BYOB corkage is $4.  You'll need at least $16 worth if you plan on enjoying the meal.   AxeMe's review mentioned store bought bread.  I only wish.  We were offered nothing.   The people next to us told us that the pesto pasta they were FINALLY served (after they flagged down the busser and asked him to check on the food) was ""horrible"" and didn't have any pine nuts, as promised, in the dish.  Luckily for them, they had vodka.  Anyone eating at Adesso should, no question, stock up on vodka prior to ordering.  It will make the fact that you spent $50 on something you could have just as easily bought in the canned food aisle for $1.39 much easier to handle.   Best part about the dinner?  The wine.  Best part about the day after the meal?  The owner's ""compliment"" posted from his fake profile ( yelp.com/user_details?us… ):  ""For your review of: Adesso It's assholes like u that are screwing up our country---it's a Thursday with 70 degree weather & they simply were not staffed and tried to set up a patio before being ready---they work very hard there but just  like he shit job u probably have--they r not perfect & had a bad night--but, no, pricks like u r perfect!

I had a healthy portion of Pasta Carbenara (excuse my spelling there), the presentation was good and the taste was excellent. The bread and special butter are a must, so try all 3(butters). I have to give the server credit, I was with a BYOB group and we stayed and drank awhile after the meal and even though it was near closing she never stood over the table or rushed us in any way. Moreover, the waitress was also very attentive.        They must have been reading their review because I didn't notice the loud music that others complained of. The atmosphere is nice and starts to border on upscale, although most people were dressed fairly casual.         Prices are decent about $15-$16 range on the pastas, which is fair.  Unfortunately, one cannot review Adesso without mentioning the $4 corkage fee.  Fortunately, I was with a party of ten (if you have a party of ten or more the corkage fee is waived) so I didn't have to pay it. However, I think it's bad business charging $4 a bottle. Now more than ever folks don't want to be nickel and dimed and I know people that will simply avoid BYOBs with corkage fees (especially $4 ones).  Why not have people remember the great food & service instead of the fact that they had to pay $4 to have someone open their bottle of wine.  If they take away the corkage fee I bet they'll make more money off of the additional customers.  However, even with the corkage fee the place deserves better than a 3 star overall rating.

We were a very large group, and it was during Market Days, so it took a couple people a bit longer than expected to get to the restaurant. Though we had a reservation, the waiter absolutely would not seat us until everyone was there. Since the restaurant was small, I understand. However, no one else was in the restaurant to lay claim to our table, so 12 of us sat crowded at the door, blocking the way, staring at our table and waiting for two girls who were on their way. We even asked if we could order appetizers at least, but the guy said no. Their loss; they could have made a lot more money allowing us 12 hungry girls to get started on the eating to pass the time.  When we finally did get seated, the staff was somewhat friendly, but the food was not the greatest. Nothing sounded like I needed to have it, so I settled on the eggplant parm, which was far too greasy and just not very good. Tried some of the other girls' dishes and wasn't all that impressed.

I ordered a completely pasta free dish that was a battered thin slice of eggplant rolled with a ground beef mixture inside & covered in a delicious red sauce.

I honestly have no idea how they would have accommodated 20 people? But either way, it worked out for us. Most of my table was pretty happy with their food. Mine, eh. I go the lemon chicken, and it was WAY too citrusy. All I tasted was lemon. Potatoes were pretty undercooked as well. I should have definitely gone with a pasta dish. So, I'd go back, but I definitely wouldn't order that. Corkage fee is $4 a bottle I think, not bad. Of course I prefer no corkage fee, but BYOB is still a good buy at a $4 corkage fee. So, I'm impressed with their ability to accommodate us last minute. But, my meal selection wasn't fantastic. And the service could use some work. There were some points when we didn't see a waiter for a long time. And they brought a table of 10 about 7 rolls in the middle of dinner? Not right when you sit down or anything. I mean, it's fine, but I thought it was a little weird - I'll have to say. Anyways, good experience for the most part.

I enjoyed the Salmone Adesso, a foodie helping of smoked salmon, chopped egg, Italian toast and marscapone cream cheese. Very nice, indeed. My friend had the frittata, which caused me egg envy. Mmmm, it's a rare day that I deviate from eggs. Sigh, regardless the meal was a success... My only gripe was the service. Pretty inattentive (hello, we were literally the only table) with slow coffee refills, and unenthused chit chatter. Fake it, doll. Seriously.  Then the check came: $2 EACH for the mimosa oj, which consisted of about a quarter of a champagne flute each. $4 corkage, $2 for cold coffee that was not refilled. Eh, that's a lot of beverage charges for a little bit of drinking.  So, it wasn't quite the deal I had anticipated, but enjoyable none the less.

2008-10-20,4.0,"This review is more 4.5 stars than 4. My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night around 6:30 and were able to sit down immediately. Our wine was uncorked right away, and we were brought menus promptly. The decor was definitely minimal, but the three flower mosaic on the wall in the main dining room is gorgeous. We started out with the Bruschetta Adesso, which was delicious. A bit messy, you can't really cut it and share, so get this with someone with whom you don't mind swapping germs. You're going to want to be like, ooh try this! We both thought it was creative and very delicious. I leaned more towards the ricotta/tomato/honey/arugula combination, while my boyfriend preferred the arugula/prosciutto/red onion marmalade.  I am a big fan of the bread they bring you. It's a little bit salty on the outside, but I like salt, and you only have one roll, you don't OD on the NaCl. They bring you three different kinds of delicious butter, my favorite was the pesto.  For my main dish, I got the gnocchi in a butter sage cream sauce with squash in it. The portion was just right, a tad too much, but gnocchi is so filling. The squash and butter and sage flavors were very nice, and it isn't a pasta you can get very often.  My boyfriend got the pesto alla genovese, and he liked it. I tried a bit, and my first reaction was, ""wow, what a pesto!"" It had a very powerful flavor, and tasted fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that my dish was the same consistency throughout. The squash and gnocchi were great together, but the dish could have used a little something else with a different consistency to make it perfect. I still loved it though, and I'd get it again.  The tables are also a tad close together inside the restaurant. It's a bit loud when it's crowded, but you can still manage a conversation. But you can't really enjoy the food in your own little yummy-taste bubble.  So, in sum, I give it 4.5 stars based on the deliciousness and creativity of the food choices, and detract a half star for the noise and crowded tables.",0.998,0.764,0.212,0.023,0.615386002886003

2008-09-24,4.0,"When I first moved here I walked around...alot.  Taking it all in up and down the streets.  On many an occasion during the night time hours I would pass Adesso and look at it and Ping Pong in longing to be one of the people sitting inside the restaurant.  It was so small and with the dim lights, votive candles and all glass wall facing Broadway it looks as if it's a place that would require a lot of waiting to get in. But really not so if you get there before 8 or so.  First what you do around 7 is go down Buckingham towards Halsted to Kafka and pick up a bottle of white to go with your Italian meal (I recommend the Four Sisters  sauvignon blanc) and walk down to Broadway.  Bottle in hand sit inside or out (both are perfect) and then the hard part starts... The Adesso Antipasti platter comes in three sizes depending on how big of a group you have.  For me and my girl it's the small...when I'm out with my boys who like to eat, it's the larger one.  Also you get warm bread with three different flavors of butter all delicatly squeezed on a plate:  regular, pesto and sundried tomato.  Little things like this makes a difference. And then you have to decide on an entree!  Too many choices!  Not that there are that many on the menu but just that each one sounds so darn good!  This past time I had the Rollini which was meat, sauce and cheese rolled up into eggplant.  The lady had a great gnocci w/ sausage I believe that the sausage had quite the flavor!  I've also had the burger (odd choice yes) but oh so good!   The place is very clean looking and runs pretty smoothly.  It does get quite loud so if you don't like that sort of thing I would move on, at least during dinner.  During lunch, this would be a great quiet lunch to sit outside with a salad and a glass of wine (as long as you're not on the clock of course!) and read a book.  Bring the dog!  They don't mind and neither will poochie who gets the pieces you drop!   The four star rating after all this ranting?  The service has always been less than on par.  Everytime I go in and stare at their gorgeous espresso machine and leave without coffee.  After asking for water 4 times I'm through asking.  I shouldn't have to.  So no coffee for me...I'll just stop by Kafka again on the way home and nab another bottle of Four Sisters!!",0.9904,0.872,0.102,0.026,0.44897089397089396

I flagged down the waiter, who didn't seem to care much. He picked up my plate, and asked ""you want something else?""  Yeah right. no thanks buddy, aaalllllll full.

We both ordered the chicken burger infused with herbs, served on a pretzel bun with provolone cheese. It was good, a little dry, but very flavorful. A rosemary garlic aioli was served on the side. The fries were delicious. Perfectly crispy. Our waitress was fairly attentive. I have no complaints, she just wasn't exceptional. The decor is plain, simple, and modern. The tables inside are definitely cramped, I'll probably stick to eating outdoors and ordering take out. We went for lunch around 1 pm. however we were given a brunch menu which was fine, because it had some lunch items on it, but was a very limited selection.

Service was lovely! The host was friendly and accommodating and our waitress was charming and friendly. We were seated immediately in the outside area and service was prompt and efficient.  First, I love a BYOB, particularly when the waitstaff still provides the kind of service that you'd get if you'd ordered a $60 bottle of wine from their cellar. The wine was flowing. The food was very tasty--we started out sharing an order of bruschetta...yummy. We each ordered fresh salads (the misto, sedano, and rucola) which were fresh and generous in size, and each enjoyed her own entree. The fusilli pasta w fennel spiked sausage was quite good, as was the rolini (eggplant, beef, mozz, parmigiano and tomato sauce), and the pollo al limone (sauteed lemon chicken with lemon, rapini, and roasted potatoes). Dessert was a special treat. We shared tiramisu (I know, cliche...but yummy) and tartufo...which is the italian word for truffle. Never had it before and it was well worth the extra calories.  Cost is very moderate: an appetizer, four salads, five entrees and two desserts were enjoyed all for under $150.  The restaurant is bright and attractively designed. There is plenty of outdoor seating and the tables inside seem to provide enough elbow room, though the space is smallish. Broadway is always a fun and energetic place to hang. Sure, parking can be a little challenging. There was a Cub's game last night so it was a bit tricky. I found street parking a few blocks away. This is close to public transportation so this shouldn't deter anyone.  Great experience. I'll definitely come again.",0.9985,0.685,0.287,0.028,0.5221746031746031

First I had the Bruschetta Adesso to start. The Bruschetta sounded great on the menu but when I received it was so large and covered with some much greens that it made it impossible to eat in any clean mannered sort of way. Also it was deconstructed, one piece of the bruschetta had the cheese, greens and mushroom while the other had greens, and the proscuitto. I prefer all my bruschetta ingredients on each piece of bread. For my meal I had the fennel spiked sausage in a tomato cream sauce. It was very good. The sauce was very creamy and the sausage pieces tasted great. So for me the meal went from okay to good. I would go back - just wouldn't recommend the bruschetta adesso but I'd recommended the sausage pasta.",0.9806,0.818,0.166,0.015,0.5198065476190477

Don't expect to get a table without reservations on the weekends.  Great place for people-watching.   My only major complaint is that of 80% of other restaurants in Chicago - the tables are often right ontop of one another.  It's distracting for me to enjoy my meal and conversation while trying my best to tune out those right next to me.",0.9555,0.808,0.153,0.039,0.55741341991342

Perhaps this is the reason your reviews are not consistent.  The house has a hot head and has no room for change. ""I have been here before anyone else"" is not an answer. Every aspect of your restaurant revolves sadly around working with this person.  Secondly, for this person to yell at someone whom was dinning for the reason given...

2008-02-29,3.0,"I'm not a solo diner. As a result I usually go places that my group of friends can agree on. One of my friends heard a bad review of Adesso and as a result we avoided the restaurant for many months after they opened. Now that I have eaten at Adesso, I feel rather indifferent. Starting with the positive, both times I've been here I ordered the same thing. I don't remember the exact name from the menu but it is veal with prosciutto, cheese, and potatoes. It is delicious and if you enjoy veal you have to try it. This dish is the perfect blend of different flavors, each working off each other. The most difficult thing is trying to elegantly cut each layer (this is served tall with each ""ingredient"" built upon the other) such that you can get a little of each flavor in each bite. The portions also seem to be perfect. I always seem to have just one bite left over. What is holding Adesso back from a better rating? I have two critiques. The first is their BYOB charge of $4 per bottle. I'm not saying it is unacceptable to charge for BYOB but there are plenty of places in the neighborhood that don't charge a premium at all and actually do a much better job with their wine service. At Sura, for example, they come around fairly often to freshen everyone's glasses (and at no extra charge). At Adesso they kindly pour your first glass, but after that you are on your own. And forget about it if you have more than one bottle. Getting anyone's attention to open a second bottle is barely worth the effort, forget about the extra charge. The second negative is simply building upon the first: less-than-stellar service. I wouldn't go so far as to call it poor service, but getting the attention of your waiter is not the easiest thing to do. Often times it seems as though they aren't even busy, just hanging out at the register (Did you know their register also surfs Facebook? It does.)  I'm not ready to give up completely on the restaurant after only eating there twice. If you find yourself in the mood for something different I would still recommend giving it a try for yourself. For myself though, this won't be at the top of my list until it can compete with other area restaurants on quality of service.",0.9597,0.797,0.119,0.084,0.48764391636732074

We ordered tiramasu for dessert and a few minutes later a very apologetic waiter came out to let us know they were out of the tiramasu and brought us a complimentary chocolate sorbet/mousse thing that was delicious!!

Modern, trendy feel, thanks to the IKEA-esque furniture, sparse decoration and low-volume trance music playing in the background. While they do have a corkage fee ($4), the BYOB still makes it cheaper than many competitors, at least for drinks.  We had great service, our waiter was very attentive. The food was delicious. Definitely try the arancini (sp?) - fried rissoto balls filled with mozzarella and hamburger.

You can't go wrong with their arancini - ample fried cheesy rice balls with a touch of beef ragu.  Their celery salad promises to be a winning match-up with julienned granny smith apples and fresh parmesan cheese, if it can be consistently made with good celery.  Pleasing ""modern"" pasta dishes include the fennel sausage, shellfish in red sauce, and the tortellini, although I find myself perusing the menu in hopes of more ""modern"" options outside of lasagna bolonese and seemingly standard arrabiata, marinara and pesto sauces.  We finally tried the tiramisu and were glad that we split it - it's huge, but the cream, cinnamon and rum were nicely balanced, and had I been allowed, I'm sure I would have eaten it all myself.

The Adesso bruschetta had a little bit too much stuff going on, but all in all the food was pretty decent for the price. Service was just right - they were helpful but not constantly in our faces. Even though we didn't sit at one of the communal tables my friends and I ended up talking with some of the people at the table next to us. The BYOB atmosphere seemed to lend itself to chatting among the patrons, which I enjoyed. The entrance got a bit crowded with all of the people waiting for a table, especially since there are only a few chairs for parties that haven't been seated yet, so I was glad that our table was far from the door. I can easily see how it might be annoying to have people who are waiting for their table hovering over you while you're trying to eat. The music was also a bit too loud for my taste, but it wasn't unbearable. I don't know if I'll be back to Adesso, but I liked trying it once, especially since I don't know of any other Italian BYOBs in the area and at $75 for 4 people, you really can't beat the price.",0.9886,0.842,0.145,0.013,0.5182072829131653

My opinion is that it fits well on the block with Ping Pong and Wakamono; you pay for the trendy factor, not the food.  But hey, if it makes you feel cool (I'm not one to judge) then go for it.   Check out Adesso once, but you may wish your bill was a little a-less-o.  (yeah, i went there.)",0.9366,0.868,0.116,0.016,0.49444444444444446

Arrival:  We opted for a later seating 9:15 so dad could watch football.  Perhaps that was our fatal mistake. At any rate, we arrived a little late but were promptly seated.  This is were the ""good vibe"" stopped.   We had to wait for menus...they didn't have enough?!  And, the noise level was horrible.  Everyone was tipsy and talking way, way too LOUD. So much so, that my dad had to turn off his hearing aid!  That said, he couldn't talk to me...and I had to write notes to convey cryptic shorthand messages.  I suggested we leave, but  because my daughter and I had raved about the food, he was determined to stay.  The Food:  We both had the onion soup which is a lovely dish.  Wonderfully seasoned.  Dad (oh, did I mention he is a Master Chef?) was pleased.  The second course arrived...fairly well timed, I might add.  Dad had the short ribs and polenta, I ordered the lemon chicken.  The lemon chicken was quite good, but unlike before, the brussel sprouts and pancetta were very disappointing.  Dad said the short ribs tasted like pot roast (is that a compliment?) and the polenta had no taste...oh, yes, after a few bites he said, ""this tastes like plain cornmeal!""   Needless to say, neither dad or I enjoy dining in silence (you will recall  the place was so loud dad had to turn off his hearing aid)  we hurried thru the meal and we made a quick dash.  As we were walking around the neighborhood, we noticed  Ping Pong.  A nice quiet little place with candles.  Remember that V8 commercial?  I woulda, shoulda, coulda?   That's exactly how I felt.  My dad lives 6 hours away...he is 84 years old.  I cherish our times together.   A two hour dinner in silence is not something I will cherish!  Note to:  1. Anyone over 25...or at least acts as if they are older than 28 2.

The halibut looked pretty tasty and so I figured this would be a healthy option, while sneaking bites of my boyfriend's pasta dish.  However, my party pooper boyfriend wanted the halibut as well, especially since it came with his favorite mashed potatoes.  We decided to be boring and both get the halibut and of course started with the fried calamari (so much for being healthy!).   The calamari was good, but not as good as the calamari at La Scarola and Sushi Samba.  However, the halibut dish was a real treat.  It was absolutely delicious and came with a yummy piece of bacon on top of it.  Don't tell my rabbi, but this Jewish girl ate both her bacon and her boyfriend's bacon.   Oy vey. I didn't have much room for dessert and wasn't even looking forward to it after reading Amanda A's review that they only have a few choices.  However, my boyfriend is a big fan of tiramisu and couldn't pass it up.  I like tiramisu, but I'd rather have a piece of chocolate cake any day.  However, this tiramisu was so amazing that it may be worth gaining 10 lbs over this holiday season!
