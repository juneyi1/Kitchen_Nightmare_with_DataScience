The polenta cakes were mild with a tasty mushroom sauce.  The mussels were good, but I've had better-- to be fair though, I prefer mussels in a wine or beer broth rather than marinara.  And the bacon-wrapped dates were just excellent-- they were served in a red pepper sauce that complimented the dates perfectly.   I'll eventually make it past the appetizer section, but it might take awhile, there's a lot more I still want to try.",0.9395,0.827,0.145,0.028,0.643939393939394

We could easily have split one or the other and been full (and we'll probably do that next time). We decided we were too full for dessert, but after seeing other people enjoying the zabaglione with fresh berries on our way out that was probably the wrong call. And yes, the bread guy is great.

We finished off with tiramisu for the table which was about average as far as tiramisu goes. We went on a Friday night at 7pm and had no problem getting a table.

The food I had was fantastic, especially the Twice-Baked Souffle and Butternut Squash Ravioli (both on their regular menu.)  My husband also enjoyed all of his meal (each course was prepared as a special that night.)  The wine pours throughout the dinner were generous and service was attentive.  For $60 per person, which included an appertif plus five courses with five different wines, it was a great deal!

It took her ten minutes to introduce herself and ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  This was our first time here and we didn't know that the drink menu was printed on the underside of the placemat. In the first place, a menu on a placemat is pretty tacky when you spend $60 for two people, but hiding the drink menu on the underside is just crappy.  Lucky me, I chose quickly.  John didn't know immediately what he wanted so the waitress was quick to ask him if he'd like a minute to decide.  She gave us ten!  And then it was about another ten minutes before our drinks came, and John's beer was overly foamy because it was the last draw of the keg.  The waitress was kind enough to let him have it free but he had to order something else to go with the meal. As for the food, John had some kind of regular salad.  He said it was good.  I had the special salad - beets with goat cheese.  Wow, that was good!  I should have ordered two since they ran out of the special soup before it could be dished up for me.  The special was gone before 7:30??? Very disappointing.  I glumly chose the linguini.  It was ok even though I'm guessing the sauce came out of a can.   John did better with the orecchiette with baby shrimp, olives, tomatoes, and arugula in a light lemon herb sauce.  He let me steal a little bit, and it was very good!  When we left, we noticed that most everyone was eating personal pizzas.  Next time we come, if ever, I'll order myself a pizza.  We live a mile away and there's better Italian food closer to us.  Il Fiasco is the kind of place that's good for local people who don't want to travel far to have a nice-ish dinner.  I wouldn't recommend traveling more than a few blocks to get there.",0.9936,0.758,0.175,0.067,0.47911608233036806

2008-05-01,4.0,"Oh, my, pasta! I hit Il Fiasco on a Tuesday night with some Yelpers to wine and dine over the musings of Bill Buford, author of ""Heat"" -- a tale of a love affair with Italian cooking. I'd never been in this particular part of town before, but it was easily accessible and the walk was quite pleasant. Il Fiasco is a pretty large restaurant, and it's definitely not busy on a Tuesday night, despite the amazing 1/2 price bottle of wine deal. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I don't drink wine. I just don't. I've never liked wine, unless it was of the thick, sweet, syrupy Manischewitz variety. I blame it on my friend trying to get me to drink boxed wine in college, really. So I got there and a Yelper told me of the 1/2 price special. I wanted to be excited, but, you know, I don't do wine. So I explained this to the waitress, who quickly brought back three cups of wine for a mini-tasting. And then, with her immaculate choices, I found a wine I'd drink -- Riesling! It was thus that I purchased my first bottle of non-Manischewitz wine. It was a time to celebrate! The appetizers we got were outstanding, though I only took part in the margherita pizza (the other items were laced with pork!), and it was absolutely delicous. I ordered the cavatappi, which if I'm correct was a chicken and mushroom and sundried tomato concoction in a tomato cream sauce. I usually stray from cream sauces, but this sounded perfect. The plate arrived, well presented, and I downed half the plate of delicious curly pasta and tasty sauce. I still have the leftovers at home, though I think they'll go the way of waste, unfortunately.  Overall the experience was outstanding. The servers were friendly and helpful, not to mention patient.

I liked it even before superstar chef Eric Aubriot got there -- and it's only gotten better. The food is that much richer, more complex, and more enjoyable. He's taken an already great restaurant to an even higher level. Il Fiasco's atmosphere sets the perfect tone: a nice mix of comfortable booths and a sturdy bar in the front of the house, and off to the side, banquette booths and tables fill the room comfortably but not too close for comfort. The noise level is animated but not bothersome, and they always have some really nice background music. Service is warm and friendly, filled with suggestions (if you need them), witty quips, and geniune hospitality and grace. Chances are, if you go back more than once, gracious host Nannette Patterson will remember your face and greet you like a long-lost friend upon your return. Your server may also remember what you had previously. All good things in my book, way beyond expectations. The pizzas, though not officially Neopolitan, are deliciously thin and crispy yet with a bit of a doughy goodness -- they are some of my all-time favorites in town. Pastas abound, from light and fresh to rich and savory. For the high quality of food you receive, and the attention to detail, the prices are beyond a bargain.

Polenta Cakes with Musroom Sauce - The polenta was really dry. The sauce was nice but boring.  3. Spinach Salad with Gorgonzola, Apple, and Candied Walnuts (or Pecans?) - My favorite salad generally, but this was pretty boring. There was more Spinach than anything else. And while it was fresh, I've seen this salad done a lot better in even kitchy, chain places. 3. Butternut Squash Ravioli - FABULOUS. I would go back just for this. One of my friends thought it was too sweet, but I thought it had a nice mix of bitter, sweet, and salty. I've been craving it all day.  4. Gnocchi in Tomato Cream Sauce - Eh. Not that good. The Gnocchi was very doughy and there wasn't enough sauce. The sauce itself was good though.  5. Grandma's Chocolate Cake - Extremely Dry. It tasted like it had been left on the counter for a couple hours. My friends and I are chocoholics and we didn't even want to finish it. When we told our waitress it was dry (after she asked) she just shrugged and said ""sorry."" (And she was the one who had recommended it!) Service: Not that good. Our waitress left us for a long time without coming back and we started at a relatively early dining time - 6:30. But the bussing was great and our plates were cleared quickly and our water glasses were kept full. Atmosphere: It was nice, although a little loud at times.

Then we moved on to dinner, I went with the rigatoni with chicken, spinach, tomatoes and a Gorgonzola sauce. My friend had the chicken porcini which had a well seasoned chicken breast, some great mushroom risotto and brocolini. Both were really damn good.

The food was totally delish, our meal was a bit poorly timed, but it didn't spoil the experience for me.  I had the gnocci with marinara and plan to have it again sometime.  I was expecting the inside to feel quite stuffy and tight but it is not at all.

The mussels came with their little fork and extra dish for shells.  The sauce was very fresh, the tomato and basil tastes just popped, and the mussels had a great consistency.  (Plus, interacting with your food can be fun!)  I was very impressed with the salad as well.  Baby arugula was topped with layered slices of sauteed (?) portobello mushroom, goat cheese (mmmmmmmm...), a few cherry tomatoes for color,  and a reduced balsamic dressing.  Really, the taste combinations in this dish impressed me.  And the cherry tomatoes really added, to my surprise. My waiter, Chris, was great.  He checked on me, but not too much.  After I had finished the meal, he came and asked if I lived in the neighborhood (which I do) and since I was interested, told me about some of the events the restaurant was having--artists' receptions with free hors d'oeuvres, Thurs-Sun free pizza if you sit at the bar and order a drink (even if it's not alcoholic), all sorts of stuff.  It strikes me as a place that my friends could have a great time, whether it was a birthday dinner or just a place to catch a quick, fresh bite.   The guys sitting next to me were having pasta, and when I smelled it it made me wish I wasn't so full!  I'm definitely getting pasta next time, especially when you can add protein to any pasta for an extra $3 (chicken) or $4 (shrimp).

The tomato and mozzarella salad was good (a basic item for any place calling itself Italian) but the Caprino pizza (goat cheese, mozzarella, tomato, grilled eggplant, zucchini, and basil) was a bit overwhelming in all the ingredients. My friend said his Penne with bolognese sauce was good, but not great. This restaurant is located at a good corner spot and has decent food but given the choice again I would more than likely head across or down the street to other great Andersonville places.",0.9952,0.716,0.284,0.0,0.5621345029239766
2007-10-08,4.0,"Go here before everyone else finds out about it! My husband and I went here as part of our honeymoon after reading mixed reviews in Timeout and the Red Eye. The service was impeccable, and the staff gave wonderful recommendations. I am a huge fan of fresh tomato and mozzarella salad..Il Fiasco's was plentiful and fresh. We also tried a delish merlot marinated poached pear and creme tart appetizer, unlike anything I have ever tried...yum! My pasta was good...the wine was better! My husband's jalapeno gnocchi however...yummy, but be prepared for water refills.",0.8786,0.852,0.148,0.0,0.55
2007-10-07,2.0,"I don't quite get this place. I went there recently for a Sunday dinner and generally, from the not Italian items on the menu to the odd selection of videos on the TVs (TVs???) to some poorly prepared food to an overall uninspired setting, I left kind of scratching my head. The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't special and for that, although reasonably priced, was overpriced. For an appetizer, we got the calamari, which clearly had come from a box of frozen, already breaded calamari, since every piece was the same size and shape. Wine was OK. The front area was nice enough, but honestly I had better pasta when it was Rioja. I had the seafood pasta and it was good enough, but nothing like the seafood linguine I remember in the Northwest Side and northwest burbs where I grew up. It just didn't seem especially Italian, if that makes any sense at all. On the walk home we stopped to look at the menu in front of anteprima, and thought, you know, for a few dollars more we could have gotten a truly memorable meal, instead of one we may very well be crossing off our list of neighborhood Italian alternatives. The pizza looked interesting though, so we may be back for that, but not too soon.",0.9826,0.806,0.154,0.04,0.4510262725779967
2007-08-13,3.0,"This new concept in the former Rioja space is billed as ""Italian"" and has been reviewed as such, so I was a bit taken aback as I was skimming along the menu, past the pastas and the ""Neopolitan"" pizzas and found myself among the ""Specialties"" in...France. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that duck confit and lamb with peas and mint are not Italian dishes.  Many of the specialties sounded rather good, as a matter of fact.  I was sorely tempted by the confit (I can almost never turn it down on a menu), but Italian was what we were in the mood for so I turned my attention back to the pasta and  ended up with the pappardelle with mushroom marsala cream sauce, while my husband took the Speck (a cold smoked and cured Italian ham) pizza for a spin.  We started off with the ""Antipasto Selection of Cured Meats and Italian Cheeses"". The antipasto plate was fine, nothing special, with my only real complaint being that the prosciutto was sliced too thickly, which makes for unpleasant texture.  The olives were pitted, which was a plus for my husband, but overall the presentation could use a little pizazz - a little color, maybe some roasted red peppers?  Good for nibbling with wine while you try to make sense of the rest of the menu though. The pappardelle was nicely cooked and the dish was tasty, but I guess I sort of hoped for something besides button mushrooms.  Even criminis.  But the portion size was good, the pasta-to-sauce ratio was good and it was well seasoned, though could use a few dashes of fresh ground black pepper (which the server has if you ask).   The pizza said it came with speck, tomatoes, gorgonzola and arugula and was somewhat less successful.  The crust is slightly too crackery and was a little bit tough, and when they say ""tomatoes"" they mean ""tomato sauce"", not fresh tomatoes.  The gorgonzola and speck are nice, but the arugula is so finely julienned it is basically there for color not flavor. Service was excellent and attentive.  Wine list is short but affordable (we had a bottle of the $21 barbera, which was a little dull by itself but was nice with the food).  Il Fiasco seems to know what it is trying to accomplish but not quite how to get its point across, as if the chef has a hundred crazy ideas and wants to try them all at once.  Still, it's an affordable, pleasant, friendly place and I'm curious to see what they can do with the more complex items on their menu.",0.9925,0.817,0.138,0.045,0.4892853863308408
2007-07-29,4.0,"Tried Il Fiasco with bunch of coworkers, and I think it was alright. It's a newly opened restaurant so I have to give them some time to settle. Their mozzarella tomato salad was delicious, much smaller than I thought it'd be but tasted great. Pizzaz are definitely to die for. They are thin crust, and come with toppings like eggplants or zucchini. Yummy! I sort of felt like they wanted us to leave right away after we were done with our meal, but maybe they were just being attentive coming to our table every five minutes. Overall, nice, classy restaurant in Andersonville for dinner. Oh and I have to say the decoration is very nice!",0.9821,0.682,0.256,0.063,0.6991883116883116
2007-07-22,4.0,"I think Il Fiasco makes an excellent addition to the Andersonville Italian offerings. My eating partner and I have soured on Calo, finding their entrees too rich and expensive, and the service rather inflexible at times (so it will cost me an extra 7 dollars to substitute a vodka sauce for the creme sauce?). Anteprima seems exquisite so far, but for the everyday fare, a little too dear.  After a few weeks of business, Il Fiasco seems to be running like a top and was completely packed at 9 pm on a Saturday. This is a good sign, especially as I thought that the name of the restaurant was a playful and sardonic reference to the fate of the previous two tenants of this location... The menu has many tasty-looking options, none too artful, but with many thoughtful ingredient pairings. We started with the carpaccio, which was quite good although a bit meager in portion and compensated for with a huge mound of arugula. My pasta was wonderful - a large amount of seafood (shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari) on very simply dressed linguine in seafood stock, butter, cherry tomatoes, and garlic shavings. All the flavors were bright and it was a perfect portion size. My honey had the pork tenderloin which was really tasty - medium rare pork is delicious, but I thought a no-no (?!) - although it seemed to be missing the glaze described on the menu.  The food was brought to the table in a timely fashion, although I found our waiter a bit annoying. The most egregious fault we had with our meal was that our waiter never offered us freshly ground pepper - an addition that would have really made my dish. On the other hand, I am no sommelier and i really appreciated the organization of the wine list in terms of body and dryness - especially since i am rather unfamiliar with Italian wines.  All in all I had an excellent experience at this new restaurant - and our bill was under 80 dollars for an appetizer, two entrees, a bottle of wine and dessert - a welcome change from the ever increasing prices in this neighborhood.",0.9941,0.775,0.172,0.053,0.5788155642806805
2007-07-19,4.0,"I was walking by on my way home and saw this place had opened up.  I thought it looked cute, so my fiance and I decided to head out and try it. It's cute inside, and the food we had was good.  I had an arugula salad dressed with olive oil and lemon juice and topped with shaved parmesan.  My fiance had pork tenderloin?  Pork something.  Then we shared the steamed hot chocolate pudding.  I'd recommend any of those dishes.   I found their soda selection odd and a trifle lacking.  They have RC, Diet Rite, Ginger Ale, and one other (maybe Diet RC?).  Granted, most people who go there probably order an alcoholic beverage, but even so...  The menu is fairly limited in general, and they didn't seem to have much vegetarian friendly fare, so be forewarned. I found that most of the food was reasonably (even cheaply) priced, though some of the entrees were more than they needed to be.  Our check was nearly $50, and my salad was only $4, so the pricing is a little uneven. The service was fantastic.  Granted, there were only 2 customers at the bar and (I think) one other table when we came in, but I really cannot complain at all.  Very attentive, very efficient.  Our server's name was Andy.  If you go, you should ask for her. The highlight for me was that they were showing a DVD of Il Divo singing pop songs (Hero by Mariah Carey, being a shining example) in Italian.  Classic.  Hilarious.  Fantastic.  I can't come up with enough adjectives to tell you how amazing this part was.",0.9913,0.824,0.159,0.018,0.564360119047619
2007-07-17,4.0,"I questioned whether we really need another Italian eatery in Andersonville. And truth be told, we probably don't. But Il Fiasco is a nice addition to the Clark Street strip. The basic concept seems to be neighborhood restaurant with an upscale twist. Prices are definitely affordable, with most pastas and pizzas (12"" thin crust) clocking in at about 10 bucks, and entrees in the $15 range. The decor is clean and simple. The layout is the same as it was when this space was Rioja, and Atlantique before that, but it feels roomier. No doubt because the new owners ditched most of the the tchotchkes that cluttered up Rioja. The overall feeling is casual elegance -- you can definitely wear jeans, but this would be a nice date spot as well. The restaurant is brand new (it just opened last weekend), but the staff seemed to have its act together. Granted, I was in on a Tuesday night, so we'll see what happens on a busy weekend. But my server was helpful, and the food came out promptly. Because it was a slow night, the chef stopped by my table to check in. Fiasco is focusing on building good will among its neighbors, and doing a good job. I started with a gorgonzola and spinach souffle, which was served on a bed of baby spinach with a side of poached pears. Excellent texture and flavor. The souffle is called ""twice baked,"" which I think is a nice way of indicating that they are not made to order. But neither the texture nor temperature suffered for it. I need to eat my way through the appetizer list, which includes fried artichokes, bacon-wrapped dates, figs with prosciutto and mascarpone, and a home cured salmon. For an entree, I had the grilled lamb chops, which are served with a mint vinaigrette, which is a nice accent. Dessert was a steamed chocolate pudding, which was rich and decadent, but which no one seemed to have the vocabulary to explain to me. (For ""pudding,"" think English pudding, but not as dense.) Fiasco offers about a dozen pizzas, ranging from a simple margherita (mozzarella, tomato and basil) and funghi (mixed mushrooms), to the ""fiorenta,"" which has wilted spinach, garlic, mozzarella, tomato, and ham, topped with a fried egg. Not your typical pepperoni. There are also a handful of pasta, both simple (rigatoni with meat sauce, angel hair with tomatoes and basil in olive oil) to the more complex (jalapeno gnocchi with asparagus, peas, and roasted red pepper sauce). Fiasco keeps its prices low by offering modestly sized portions. This is a good thing. You won't be taking food home with you, but you'll be paying 5 or 10 dollars less per entree, and won't feel stuffed. My dinner was three small lamb chops, with a side of zucchini fritters, which was perfect. If you want more food, you can add a side (mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus) for 3 or 4 bucks. I'd rather skip the leftovers -- and the bloat -- and save a few bucks.",0.9971,0.814,0.159,0.027,0.46698882512836004
