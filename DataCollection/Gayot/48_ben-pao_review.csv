2011-07-11,4.0,"Ben Pao and I have had a rocky relationship that started last year. Their menu in general is not very large. Even more sadly, their food is littered with peanuts and peanut oil so that has really limited my options. I also had an incident where a chicken potsticker was in my noodles (and they claimed that it was impossible), but that was handled very well overall.  *This review is only for my visit tonight.*  I picked up vegetable fried brown rice with tofu. I appreciate that the person taking my order informed me that it would be $2 extra for the tofu, which prevented any surprises on the price. And let me tell you, I never ever eat brown rice. But I had come in for dinner a few weeks ago with a friend who ordered the brown rice and I tried some of hers. It was soooo good! It's a little bizarre that the fried rice tastes exactly like the chow fun noodles but I'm figuring that they use the same sauce. It's a feel good dish because of the veggies, brown rice and tofu. Definitely a good amount of tofu but I would have liked to have more veggies. Even though it's fried rice, it's not greasy at all. I should have ordered it as medium spicy because it lacked any kick. There was so much rice! It looks like it'll be enough for another lunch or two. It was strange that it was packed into a takeout container (which I have to throw in the garbage!) rather than a plastic container (which I can recycle!).

For dinner we ordered some Kung Pao chicken and Mongolian beef. The meat in both was very tender. Ofcourse, since I'm a pepper freak, I loved the kung pao, it had just the right amount of spice.  Now all was fine and dandy when we were first sat. I mean a 10 minute wait at a restaurant downtown? Really, that's unheard of. So we were sat in a very spacious round booth. Then we waited a long 10 to 15 minutes before our waitress came and said she'd be with us shortly. Like Nene, on the Real Housewives of Atlanta, would say...Oooooooooook!  She was really busy which isn't fully her fault but come on, the other half of the restaurant was nearly empty!!! Plus all her time and attention were on the table of 12 she was attending to. BS!

Despite having a reservation, the hostess cobbled together 2 circular tables in the corner area of the restaurant (not the main dining room).  It was a very awkward seating arrangement, as 3 of my siblings were sectioned off on their own table and had trouble participating in the conversation happening at the other table where I was seated.  Not a great way to spend a dinner with family that I do not see often.   I was annoyed with the seating arrangement, but thought, at least the food here is great!  Not the case.  We did the group share menu and the cherry bomb shrimp dish that I used to love, was extremely soggy, with the tiniest shrimp I have ever seen.  Also, our waiter forgot to mention that the share appetizers are ""portioned"" for the group -- meaning that each diner gets exactly one potsticker and one crab rangoon stick.  Eh.  To put it lightly, my 6'5'' pot-sticker loving brothers were disappointed.  Overall, the dishes were bleh.  I regret taking my family here for our big group dinner.  For spending well over $300, I expect better food.  And the $300 total was AFTER we had to ask the waiter to take beers off of our check that we did not order.   With so many great restaurant options in the Grand/State area, I will be taking my out-of-town guests elsewhere from now on.",0.9814,0.808,0.134,0.059,0.6003205128205127

This wasn't my first visit (I attended a cooking class and the food was excellent!) but I can't say it won't be my last.  I ordered the tofu lunch special that comes with hot & sour soup, a spring roll, and white or brown rice.  It being Ash Wednesday, I went with the tofu and asked if the soup could be vegetarian.  No can do, they tell me.  It's pre-made with chicken in it already (and chicken broth, but that's not a big deal to me).  So can we find you another option or give you a second spring roll?  I opted to pay an extra $1.50 for the vegetable dumpling soup.  It came with asparagus, mushrooms, spinach, salt, and a fruit fly.  All the elements of a nutritious meal.   I ate my veggies, but the broth was so salty I couldn't finish.  Good thing though because it gave me time to find my little buggy taking a bath in it.  Ugh. As I tried not to think about swallowing any of his pool party guests, I just let my server know.  He was totally apologetic, and brought the manager over to ask if they could do anything for me.  They offered another soup, a spring roll, something else off the menu...  Honestly, I couldn't stomach the thought of eating more soup, so I just let it go.  It's really not my bag to expect things for free even if my meal came with an ingredient I didn't order.  So I let it be and got my 8 treasures tofu entree.  It was ok, but again, a little heavy on the salt.  I did appreciate all the slivers of ginger, though.  The spring roll was probably the highlight. Delish! At the end of it, I guess they felt bad enough about my lunch experience to comp my meal.  My experience with Lettuce customer service has always been good, but I was particularly delighted about that.  My only question would be why offer a vegetarian lunch special option if you don't have a vegetarian soup for it?  Then, seriously, you're going to charge extra for vegetable broth?  I guess I've had mixed experiences here, and it's a little too spendy to make it a destination for me.

2010-11-17,5.0,"Easily the best Asian meal I have had between the Atlantic & Pacific oceans. Flavours are subtle, nuanced and balanced on a small menu where the Streeterville venue has focused on a few dishes that they can delivery perfectly. Ambiance is fine; drink menu is sad; service is ideal.   Dinner, Nov 2010, single table, appetizer, main course, dessert. $37 including tip.  Decor is a sleek mix of clean, modern lines in classical oriental colours. The drink menu is small and given exclusively to overmixed, overflavoured, ""creative"" cocktails. The wine list is simply anemic. Asked for hot tea, a staple in any good Asian restaurant. ""I'll bring you the box of teabags to choose from."" Box? Bags? ""Um, I think I'll just have water."" Menu was sparse to the point that I almost reconsidered eating there - a couple dozen dishes in total, including appetizers. What I did NOT expect was the phenomenal care they put into each one. Appetizer was Chicken Potstickers, which I thought were underdone at first. No, they'd simply stuffed the dumplings so delicately that the ingredients could cook perfectly without becoming the hard little meat-nugget you normally get. The dipping sauce was a superb, with a vinegary tang, plum sweetness, subtle heat and soy saltiness, obviously crafted specifically to complete the flavour profile of the chicken. It's what you'd expect from Dim Sum in Heaven Beef Chow Fun, my entrée choice, is easy to destroy and hard to master. It takes a subtlety rare in any kitchen. The objective is to make a star of the most boring of ingredients: a flat, soft noodle. Most swamp it a sticky sauce or hide it under a mound of creatively carved veggies. The dish arrived with loads of beef, sprouts, scallions, slivered onions, julienned peppers and what looked like WHOLE baby bok choys, all seemingly drenched in a sticky sauce. I expected the worst. I have honestly never had a more subtle, nuanced and balanced dish in an Asian restaurant, and rarely outside of French cuisine. Even there, the French seldom highlight the noodle, instead focusing the work of the sauce on transforming the protein or a vegetable. Here, the perfectly-cooked beef and veggies simply sang chorus and the surprisingly subtle sauce played a lush melody that allowed the noodles to sing a virtuoso lead. I never order dessert - it's a waste of space better devoted to savoury flavours. I made an exception simply because I didn't want the meal to end. The Lemon-Ginger Cheesecake sounded daring and adventurous - instead it was comfort food at its finest. The almond-cookie crust and the interplay of sour-cream tang, zesty lemon and striking ginger were the perfect end to a nearly perfect meal.  Out of my person 100-point scale, it gets a 93 - the highest I've ever given to any restaurant more than twenty miles from an ocean.",0.9962,0.779,0.174,0.047,0.5321763916834338

The decor is also really cool and is pretty chinese. We ended up ordering a couple main dishes and sharing them. The combination fried rice was decent. There was a little salty for my taste. The sesame chicken was pretty good. They literally threw the chicken into the sauce, tossed it around and then dumped it onto the plate. There was a lot of sauce. However, this not being a bad thing because the sauce was actually pretty good. The Mongolian beef wasn't too bad. I did like mixing it the chow mien noodles.

Been there a few times in the last couple of months, and I've decided that I really like the idea of walking over a footbridge to get to the dining room--something about it that portends adventure and expectation.   We went for the group share menu, which, since there were six in our party, made it easier to choose something for everybody's palate.  Our waiter (who could be Legolas' brother from 'Lord Of The Rings'--very elfin.  And, apparently elves make excellent waiters.) suggested something not on the group share menu: 'Nine-Flavor Beef.'  Outstanding.  Just the right amount of spice and crunch--the hit of the Lazy Susan.    We also had a shrimp dish as well as something with scallops--both were tasty, but the Nine Flavor Beef hit on all cylinders. Also: some of the best egg rolls in the city--I'd be happy with just a plate of these, and let the hounds ravage the rest.

Entrees:  Mongolian Beef, Black Pepper Shrimp & Kung Pao Chicken - i only ate the shrimp, which was alright...sauce had a nice kick to it, but the shrimp were a bit overdone.  The men at the table rather enjoyed the beef dish - very ""meaty"" as one put it.   Side:  veggie fried rice - a big fail in my book, the rice seemed underdone, and it was real salty.  No one seemed thrilled with this dish, I stuck to the white rice. Overall - eeeeh, it was ok.  Food didn't taste super fresh, which leads me to believe that the ""group share"" items are sitting in big vats in the back of the kitchen waiting to be served...notch down in my book.  Drinks were really pricey too (I know, I know, downtown...).  Honestly, the service and ability to handle a somewhat rowdy group of this size is what's earning this place 3 stars.   The search for killer Chinese food in Chicago continues....",0.9911,0.761,0.182,0.058,0.5129084967320261

I have found the wait staff here quite adequate to the price point, certainly not the best trained but sufficient. The food is hit or miss. The wrinkle cut green beans are fantastic. They recently (5/8/10) implemented a new green tea that is one of the best I've ever tasted. I dined here for Chinese new year and found the Red Snapper to be genuine Chinese food. However, my more recent visit left me feeling like the food was a fresher version of your ordinary take out. I had general tso's chicken, which was near flavorless. When they say something is hot, just assume it is not. I've never had anything at the restaurant that was truly hot including their acclaimed cherry bomb sauce poured heavily over my general tso's chicken. If you are into real Chinese food, look to this place around the Chinese holidays. Otherwise, you'll need to look elsewhere entirely.

They sat us at a large round table that you would normally seat a party of eight - quite an interesting choice for only two people! But it was kind of cozy and we had a view of the entire restaurant. The waitress came to introduce herself and she was super friendly and immediately congratulated me on my new job - of course this was the sweet doing of my date when he made the reservations :) We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and then ordered the sesame chicken and cherry bomb shrimp for the main course - all were delicious! The only critique I have was that the waitress seemed a tad bit pushy to have us order our main course because the kitchen was closing down even though it was only around 9:30 on a Thursday night. So, my advice would be to have dinner a bit earlier if you don't want to feel rushed. To top if off, the waitress came by with the banana egg roll for dessert!

2010-03-24,3.0,"2.5 stars. I come here often enough but I always seem to forget to write a review. It must be because no meal I've had has been all that memorable. There is nothing inherently offensive about Ben Pao, but there's nothing drawing me in either. As Bob D. mentioned, when BP first opened it was a culinary mecca of sorts. Now, it's kind of on life support. I went for lunch yesterday and my sole purpose was to add to my LEYE points. Yes, I am a points whore. The goal is to save up enough points so when I dine at Joe's, I can eat to my heart's content and have it cost nothing. I have been able to do this several times. My friend and I both ordered the ""lunch bundles"" - basically a cup of hot and sour soup, an egg roll, and a chintzy portion of some overly sauced, overly caramelized, breaded chunks of pick-your-protein with some uninspired vegetables thrown in, and vegetable fried rice on the side. I don't care for their hot and sour soup, so the server very kindly substituted some vegetable dumpling soup. It was pretty good, certainly better than the hot and sour. The egg roll was so greasy, it could have been wrung out. It had none of the crispness that defines a good egg roll. Took one bite and pushed it aside. I had the Mongolian Beef and my friend had the Cherry Bomb Shrimp. All through lunch, I kept singing The Runaways song ""Cherry Bomb"" in my head, because, well, just because that's the dumb stuff I do. Other than the mild heat on the shrimp dish, these two things tasted exactly the same.  I'm not gonna say that I won't go back because I know I will.

Ok.... Appetizers: We started off with the Crab Rangoon Chopsticks, which were preseted in a really cute way and tasty.  Because they resemble straws or chopsticks, there isn't much room for stuffing and the crab meat was lacking.  They were still yummy and I liked the sweet chili dipping sauce they came with. We also had the Cool Peanut Noodles which were supposed to be spicy, but not to us (our tolerance must be building...finally).  They were very good and I wish that there was a full size dinner option of this as well!! I actually wanted more!!  What!? I said I was starving didn't I??? Main Course: For our main courses we opted for the Seven Flavor Chicken which again was supposed to be spicy, but nope.  It was a tasty dish, and the pieces of chicken were nicely fried and crispy.  I thought it was a tad bit dry, but very tasty none the less! We also had the Chow Fun Noodles with Prime Beef, which I really liked.  The beef was tender and the noodles were crispy on the ends and the sauce was great..I even used it for the chicken. It was a great meal, which left no room for dessert and we even ended up taking half of both main courses home for leftovers!! I love that!!  The service was great and on the way out the hostess gave us a tip that if we want the food spicy, ask for it extra spicy.

Aren't spring rolls supposed to be non-fried? They were seriously sick, to the point I could not finish even half of one. I could squeeze about a gallon of grease out of those things. The veggie innards tasted better but were still uber-greasified. Same issue with the Dragon Noodles. I liked the heat from the pepper flakes, and the mushrooms and spinach, but they were just drowning in oil.

[Insert PF Changs here] I couldn't wrap my mind around charging someone $15 for the same sweet n sour chicken you can get at Golden Wok/China Palace/Jade Dragon/China Wok/Golden Dragon, etc for a quarter of the price that includes rice and an egg roll. But I wrong about this place. The layers of flavor each dish had could not be duplicated by any place with the words ""golden"", ""wok"", or ""dragon"" in its title. I ordered the tangerine chicken that was a large chicken breast crusted with a crisp breading and covered with sweet and savory orange flavored sauce. The tables have strategically placed lazy susans on each table that make sharing very easy. I had a chance to devour a delicious chicken curry swimming in a delicious broth of coconut, ginger and curry; crispy beef topped with crushed peanuts and scallions; sesame chicken; and seared scallops. The birthday boy was presented with a delicious banana cheesecake with a nice crispy crust and a nice caramel sauce. It was a great way to end a great meal at a great place.

The decor is primarily a rich red and black, with red globes providing accent lighting overhead (I loved this, since the restaurant matched both my outfit and my phone, but I realize that this may not be solid criteria for extra points...).  The hostess and waitstaff dress to match the decor, but not in an over the top way.   Our waiter was fantastic; he told us about the evening's specials without pushing them too hard, and gave us a complimentary chicken salad-y bite atop a sesame cracker for being new to the restaurant.  When he asked where we were from, he was a touch surprised that we were locals; I gather that most of Ben Pao's business is from travelers staying at the various hotels in the area. We started with the Crispy Garlic Tofu and a large Hot and Sour soup.  Our waiter anticipated our desire to share both appetizers and had the soup brought out with 2 smaller individual bowls.  You could taste the freshness of the Hot and Sour soup; the broth wasn't congealed like I've had at other places (mind you, it was thick like it was supposed to be, just not congealed).  The flavor was also a lot more subtle than I'm used to for this dish; it wasn't overpoweringly hot nor overpoweringly sour.  Ben Pao's Hot and Sour soup would be a great choice for someone who hasn't tried the dish before and wants to dip their toes in.  The tofu dish, however, was delicious!  Perfect for a garlic lover.  Check out a photo of the dish here:  flickr.com/photos/247354…   I had the Penang Curry Chicken and my companion had the Seven Flavor Chicken.  The chicken in my dish was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the Seven Flavor Chicken (my companion and I share most dishes) was crispy and flavorful.  Both dishes also served us well for breakfast the next morning.  Our evening ended with complimentary fortune cookies (with real fortunes, not the silly ones).  The entrees contained a large amount of food, so we were too full to attempt the dessert menu, so that will have to wait another time. Overall my experience here was very good; I would definitely like to try a few more items on the menu, especially the dessert!  The prices are appropriate for the quality of food (so fresh) and service (so friendly and non-intrusive), and I think this is a great place to use for a dinner & movie outing in downtown Chicago.  Thumbs up!",0.9974,0.823,0.151,0.026,0.5224147727272728

We ordered the Ben Pao eggrolls and steamed veggie dumplings.  The eggrolls were good - a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I loved the veggie dumplings - they were flavorful and moist.  I don't get fried dumplings as I think the oil overpowers the filling - these were just right. For an appetizer, we got the eggplant to share - I picked around the peppers and didn't get that pepper taste in the eggplant - it was delicious, but seemed the plate had been sitting waiting for our main meal - it wasn't warm enough. For dinner, we ordered the seven-flavored beef and the fish special - striped bass over bok choy.  The beef was excellent - sticky, sweet, beefy, flavorful.  The bass was also really good, but I'm picking the beef as the favorite of the night.  Rice was perfectly steamed and sticky. For dessert, the banana cheescake and chocolate lava cake with blood orange reduction were quite tasty and just the right size. The biggest downside to the evening was the noise.  Could have been that the loudest people in the city were seated next to us and made it hard for us to talk to each other (and I sat NEXT to my sweetie) - the restaurant should have a policy to let people know that shouting and loud laughing need to be toned down as consideration to other patrons.

Our server was very friendly and knowledgable, and he got our meal right back on track.  The lettuce wraps with chicken and dumplings with shrimp appetizers were very tasty.  We also enjoyed the atmosphere as the decor was festive (perhaps due to the holidays?), comfortable and contemporary.  We found the entrees to be agreeable enough, with interesting flavors from both the seven flavors beef and the sesame chicken.  Yet, both overly generous portions proved to be overwhelmingly flavored and grew tiresome.  The flank steak, less lean than you'd want, grew chewier over time and the spices that adhered to the meat were less enjoyable as the dish cooled.  Similarly, the chicken was really tasty initially, but becomes an overload of one flavor especially as the dish cools.  I suspect that having a bigger party and eating family style provides more variety and a better overall taste experience.

2008-09-28,4.0,"Ben Pao is a Chinese restaurant as interpreted by 1960s Hollywood. It's all red and black and gold, full of plants and water features, with accessories snapped up from a Chinese New Year going out of business sale. At any minute, I expected to see Nancy Kwan or Anna May Wong come mincing out of the kitchen, their hair all tied up with chopsticks. Which doesn't make it bad. There are plenty of Chinese restaurants run by Chinese who are dumbing the food down for the round eyes. And I'm a fan of many of those places. And given that this is a Lettuce Entertain You joint, you are guaranteed that the food will be of high quality. But you are also guaranteed 22 oz. foofie drinks called the Big Kahuna. Much of the food is excellent. One of our party ordered the peanut noodles, and she was lucky I didn't snatch them away from her. The pork shoulder is good, and the ""7 flavor"" dishes -- with three kinds of peppers -- are delicious. On the other hand, the kung pao beef and the panang curry were nothing special. I think the key is to stay away from what you've ordered in more authentic Chinese restaurants. Service can be dicey. Since they get a lot of large groups, the servers are sometimes hard to wrangle. But if you can get their attention, they're generally helpful and efficient. If you're in the near north neighborhood, Ben Pao is a good option.

The chicken was melt in your mouth and the noodles were damn good. The sauce was light but had this amazing flavor that brought the dish to a new level.  We shared the dish so the bill was small. I do agree with the reviews below. What makes this different then a regular takeout asian joint? Not much to charge 15-17 bucks for a plate that would be 7 dollars takeout.

The food was much less than average.  I had fired shrimp wonton (suggestion from the waiter) and one of their highlighted specialties, the peppered scallops.  Well, wonton tasted anything but shrimp, and were drenched in oil, way more than any fritters, as if they had refried them twice or thrice.  The scallops were simply seared after being battered in flour.  The ""peppered"" part was just grounded at the table from a pepper grinder.  Rice was hard on top and cold (microwaved to reheat). WHen I called for the check, my waiter was not around, so I asked another waiter if she could process it.  She said no, and sat 2 tables back with her friend (seemed to be the manager) who was having a soup...

2007-11-11,4.0,"Ben Pao, good Chinese in a pretty (smoky) box. I give 'em 4 stars on my Chicago Scale, three if they were in So-Cal.  -First the food. We started with the Crab Rangoon, a fresh crab and cream cheese mix contained in a crisp won ton wrapper. It was good and creamy cheesy the way it should be although I didn't notice the chive or water chestnut that were supposed to be in there. -Their namesake Pot stickers were well made, seared, and full of meaty filling although they were heavy on the seasoning making them taste very sausage like. A serious complaint though... not nearly enough rice wine vinegar in the dipping sauce. -The Spicy Eggplant Tofu was again well prepared. The tofu was done perfectly leaving it firm on the outside and soft within and the eggplant was a nice flavor and texture. IT WAS NOT SPICY though and so we requested chili paste from the kitchen. Not even a tingle although I attribute that more to accommodating the tastes of their usual Midwestern clientele. That's right. I called you people soft and weak when it comes to heat!  -Sesame Chicken was perfectly crispy, not overly battered, and good pieces of meat. On the savory side, a minuscule touch of sugar to balance the soy would be nice, but I'd have this again.  Ultimately I'd have to compare the tastes at Ben Pao to that other ""Pfff Chain"" restaurant although Ben Pao leans towards the better side and was certainly one of the better spots I dined in Chicago. It is a pretty box with a ""cool"" dark theme. I have to say the smoking killed it for us though. About halfway through dinner it was all too much and we boxed the leftovers and got out.

Cocktails are good, too--we've tried the Zombie, the Rum Barrel, and the Sangria, and all were good. I also love their crab rangoon. It's always a favorite of mine, but I hate how at most places, the crab part is just one big glob at the bottom. Here, they roll it up into long crispy sticks, and it's delicious. The old world egg rolls are also really good, and ginormous. We've tried several different dinner entrees--sesame chicken, seven flavor beef, mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, and black peppered shrimp--and they're all good. However, my absolute favorite is the sesame chicken. It's SO good. We always get one order of that and then try something else, too.

2006-12-15,4.0,"I'm always really wary of asian restaurants that cater to rural white people. they always feel like a theme restaurant; chinese cuisine extra disney style. the decor is hyper-asian - dunk everything in red paint, wrap it in red silk, dress the emo-kid staff in those cross-tie, nehru collar jackets, throw in some paper lanterns and a koi pond and you're done. I feel like any asian restaurant that pays that much attention to the decor ain't gonna put that much attention into the food. not Ben Pao. all cynicism aside, the food at Ben Pao is great. everything was robust and flavorful. crisp flavors that all worked well together. get yourself an overpriced drink and give in to the atmosphere.",0.872,0.872,0.107,0.021,0.18205128205128204

2006-10-25,4.0,"This place was my first foray into Chinese food a few years ago.  First, the decor is great- I love the little bridge you walk over to get to the dining area- totally unnecessary but still fun :) They also have a lot of good drinks on the menu, none of which I remember as being especially Asian, but still tasty, and really that's all that matters right? I haven't tried a lot of the food, but what I have had is really good! The portions are also really huge, and its very convenient that they have the lazy susan type device in the middle to spin the dishes around the table so everyone can try some of each others' orders! They also even made my grandma a nice plain chop suey, which was not on the menu, when I came here with a bunch of family members for lunch one day.  Granted this isn't a huge thing, but we still appreciated them doing so, as the rest of the menu seemed to be too out there for her tastes (little Polish grandma, you know...)  Anyway I'd definitely recommend as a good dining experience - I'm sure you can get more authentic chinese cuisine elsewhere, but Lettuce restaurants are still pretty dependably good, if not authentic, and this is probably along those lines.  Now I want some Kung Pao.  dammit.",0.9959,0.745,0.242,0.012,0.5241943241943242

I've been here half a dozen times or more and the service, food, and atmosphere have left me with the same satisfied feeling.  Also noteworthy is the speed at which we were served on the two occassions I was there with large parties.

We had originally wanted to eat outside on the patio, but upon entering the restaurant, we both knew we would enjoy the detailed ambiance indoors more.  The lightening, especially, was per-fect.   After walking over the (almost cheesy) little bridge, we were seated at a lovely bench table for two.  Our waiter recommended drinks from the creative menu--I enjoyed the Sake Sangria. All was delicious, including the free mini egg rolls served to us by a manager in honor of our first-time visit. It's not too often that a guy and a gal living on teacher's salaries can expect such classy treatment.  I would stick this on my list of places to take out-of-towners when ""near downtown"" is a requirement.",0.9936,0.755,0.245,0.0,0.6736842105263158

Attentive host staff, we were immediately greeted upon entering.  Our server looked a bit worn out as he butchered the descriptions for the specials of the evening. I'm a big soup fan and for the most part enjoyed my chicken wonton with spinach, although the broth was a bit on the salty side.  I  had the weekly special, chicken hong sue.  For what is considered a special, I was disappointed.  The chicken was dry and chewy and turned me off immediately and I instead chose to munch on the vegetables that accompanied the dish. For the amount of money we spent on two entrees and soups, I don't think it was great.  I could have gotten better quality food at a dive in Chinatown for the fraction of what we spent.  And the service wasn't nearly as attentive as I would have expected.
