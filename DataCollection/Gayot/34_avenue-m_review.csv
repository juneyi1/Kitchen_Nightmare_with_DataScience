2008-08-10,2.0,"Went to the restaurant Saturday evening for my bachelorette party with a group of 15.  The restaurant was fully aware of this large party reservation and staffing was not appropriate to serve the table.  The table ordered sushi and hummus as appetizers - the sushi smelled & tasted fishy (not good!), the hummus was good. We repeatedly asked for more bread (they only brought out 2 bread baskets for 15 people).  When the food came out (at 10:20pm!!!) the plates were warm, not hot - but the food was delicious - half of our party ordered the Chilean Sea Bass (AMAZING item on the menu).  As a note, the restaurant was nearly EMPTY - aka the kitchen was NOT busy and should have been able to accommodate our party more efficiently. The manager was made aware of the tardiness of the food, and did provide 2 complimentary bottles of champagne.   Overall, the dinner good items were good, the sushi was not good and service was a mess.

Being a health-conscious diner means that I can be a bit particular when it comes to menu selection.  Last week I ordered the shrimp cocktail which was presented nicely on a bamboo dish, followed by the Chilean Sea Bass.  The sea bass nearly melted in my mouth and I would love to know what they did to wild rice that make it taste so delicious (it's rice after all) plus the portion was rather significant. We finished with the pan baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream - it was cooked just right to make it taste like cookie dough icre cream...yummy!

2008-03-06,2.0,"Avenue M is like the Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface of restaurants. She's kind of foxy with maybe one or two redeeming qualities, but at the end of the day, she's just an expensive coke whore that needs to get her life on track. Let me preface this dining review by recapping previous non-dining experiences at Avenue M... First time: Right when they first opened. Unappealing. Met up with fellow tribe members and realized that my money wasn't as green as certain other people's. Second and third time a couple summers ago: thought I was going to get shanked. Jailhouse tats abounded and Mr. thuglife and his rapey friend seemed like they would do anything to steal my former ladyfriend away from me for an hour.  Tonight, I went back to celebrate the inauguration of their new chef (read: drink and eat free shit). Well, the appetizers were embarrassingly hard to come by, and when we finally snagged a couple, they were... not good. The crab ravioli was truly bad and the salad was lettucey. Can't complain about the free drinks though.  For whatever reason, my friends decided we should stay for dinner. I had the tomato soup which wasn't very good, the 8 oz filet which was VERY good (yet not worth $34) and some brussel sprouts, which weren't bad. They do serve a mean cup of coffee too. The service was unbelievably slow. The server was really nice though, and comped us for a round and I think a bottle of White Star too, so that was cool.  What I found truly disturbing though, is the poor upkeep of the place. They have those 1 man bathrooms that are perfect for Tony Montana. I used two of them. Neither had any hand towels left nor any way to dry one's hands. One of them didn't even have a handle on the faucet, and I had to push this tiny thing up to get the water to go on. Forget temperature. It also had a space heater on the floor beneath the sink which I thought was a great idea. My idea of the perfect way to end a good meal is getting electrocuted in the mens room.  Anyway, if you want a good hearty meal in a sceney environment where you can drink the night away and hit on skeezy talent, I'd probably take Landmark over the Ave.",0.9772,0.723,0.164,0.113,0.5300586429074802

After 5+ minutes of trying to get the 1 bartender's attention, I was able to slurp down a good martini in the semi-crowded bar prior to dinner. According to our friendly server, they changed the chef & menu recently.  None of the appetizers on the menu really stood out among the usual suspects we see so often: crabcakes, carpaccio, coconut shrimp, etc... So, I had a nice goat cheese salad w/ very fresh greens. I ordered the 16 oz. NY strip because the martini got me in the mood for a steak. I was not disappointed in the quality of the steak, however I forgot to ask them to go easy on the salt (my mistake).  However, my date's miso-glazed Chilean sea bass was one of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this wonderful dish. Ave. M is a very nice-looking place with a minimalistic style and very tall ceilings in the bar area.

2008-02-11,4.0,"I had my doubts about Avenue M the moment I walked in the door. I tend to prefer smaller, more intimate restaurants and get turned off pretty quickly by the likes of large, ostentatious spaces like Carnivale and N9NE - it's like eating at a circus. When the nuances of class and taste become overshadowed by trendy, loud decor and trendy, loud people my feathers get ruffled pretty quickly. The only saving grace is usually really fabulous service coupled with really fantastic food, and I have to tip my hat to Avenue M because they've converted me...  from cynic to saved, I really had an excellent time at this luxe steakhouse.   Yes, it is trendier than Gibson's and Ruth's Chris and thusly the people who come out to Avenue M are a bit more on the dressed and coiffed side. If you want to debut your new fabulous dress and heels combo, this would be the place to do it. They have a pretty kickin' bar and lounge scene upstairs so you'll see people coming and going who just do drinks here for the night... I've done only cocktails and I've done dinner and both were pleasant surprises. My steak with bernaise was perfectly cooked and served up with roasted garlic - YUMMMMY! We also shared the leek and mushroom risotto with duck breast and it was some of the creamiest and most perfect risotto I've ever had. Shocking, I know.  The lounge upstairs has gangways that extend into the front room and look down onto the diners and bar action. It's a nifty vantage point when drinking with your friends up there, but trust me, you do not want to be one of those diners down below; it gets way too loud!! If you're coming in for dinner request a seat in the main dining room which remains buffered behind a massive wall of velvet curtains and actually preens to the persnickety folk like me who don't want to dine in a circus tent.

Several months later, I was glad we had come.  The decor was great and the food was fabulous.  My date had the veal chop (which he enjoyed, although he would have prepared it a little more medium rare than medium) and I chowed on the delicious Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass.  The server had no problem switching my rice out for asparagus, and overall we were very well taken care of.  The wine list was great too, and we happliy sipped vino while we took in the scene. Although we were feeling the laid-back, yet upscale vibe, we also felt like we were surrounded by some real cheeseballs.  The sharp-dressed suit to our left was joined by three, annoyingly giggly trixies, and the suit to our right announced to his date ""If you want a steak medium-rare at a nicer restaurant, you should always say medium.  Yeah, they always under cook it at the fancier restaurants. ""   We reveled in our self-proclaimed normalcy amidst the interesting crowd that surrounded us.   My only real nag is that I am a dessert person, but after a quick glance at the offered sweets we decided that the dessert list at this place was a chef's dessert list as opposed to a pastry chef's dessert list.  More of an afterthought, whereas the steaks and chops definately play center stage.

Service during dinner was fine.  Our glasses stayed full, and the food arrived in a timely manner.  The kicker came when we got our bill.  When we ordered a bottle of wine at the beginning, our waiter suggested that we get the magnum if we planned to go through two bottles, because ""it would be a better bargain.""  We thought this suggestion was very helpful, as we were very likely to drink two bottles.  Well, turns out they didn't have the same year in the magnum, so our waiter substituted another year without mentioning it.  (Sure, he showed us the label like they always do, but who the heck checks the year?)  Of course, this particular year was significantly pricier than two bottles of the year we originally ordered.  I won't say how much it actually was (because in my opinion it was obscene, and I'm embarrassed because of course we paid it, being pretty drunk by that time), but let's just say that we could have gotten nearly three of our original bottles for the price of that one magnum.  I'm no mathmetician, but that doesn't sound like a ""bargain"" to me.

Let me start from the beginning....  1- 8:00 reservation on a Friday about 10 people at the bar and not a full restaurant (1st bad sign)  2- Odd men in suits who obviously work there standing around making people feel uncomfortable not doing anything 3- bad restaurant layout.  4- I ordered lobster bisque (which is usually my FAV.) and the loud obnoxious fat busboy spilled the soup all over his hand and then had the audacity to put it in front of me- sent that back! Then when it returned it was not good. strange corn flecks and small pieces of peppers floating in it with no hunks of lobster or cream. For $9 I wanted something delicious 5- The loud obnoxious bus boy kept throwing dishes in the bin  6- The food runners were auctioning off food and not even to the right table, when I said the dish was mine he gave a dirty look to the waitress (very unprofessional) 7- Entree: when I looked at the menu online I noticed really good fish choices except when we arrived nothing looked very appetizing so I ordered chicken and lobster (again my fav) and it was horrible! it came  with some strange foam on it (hello top chef) the chicken was dry, the lobster had no flavor and neither did the wild rice. I sent it back Yuck! 8- I shared my boyfriends chicken dish which he had last time he was there and remembered he liked (*side note we're not Chicken people but sometimes it's really good at a restaurant) and it tasted like it was 4 days old- completely dried out no flavor and that's all that came with it a whole chicken and a whole shallot (random)  The only good thing about this place was our waitress- she was great I just wish she would've said don't order this that and the other.  Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or your money.

Behind us were the stairs leading up to the lounge area which were separated from our table by some sort of gauzy curtain so that every time someone came up or down the stairs the curtains would blow into the back of my head.

The good: I loved my food.  Started dinner with delicious pretzel rolls.  My boyfriend and I shared a wonderful crab cake with a lemon sauce and little side of guacamole.  I like my crabcakes a little more ""lumpy"" than most, but this more traditional take was still yummy.  My brother and his wife shared the hummus plate, which was ENORMOUS.  A big bowl of decidedly lemon-y hummus with a plate of veggies and pita.  Delicious, definitely enough hummus for an entree. For dinner, I ordered the special, a Chilean sea bass with miso glaze and soba noodles.  (I am a sucker for miso-glazed sea bass)  The soba noodles were thicker than usual, but I still really enjoyed them.  My boyfriend had the braised short ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and a mushroom sauce.  It was extremely rich, as you might expect.  I loved it, he was not as enthusiastic about it.  My brother had the veal ragout with homemade papparadelle - it looked good, but I didn't try it. Dessert?  One of the best creme brulee dishes I have ever had, and it was huge, as well.  The warm cookie with ice cream and Bailey's sauce was also excellent - it was like a pizzookie but smaller and actually cooked in the middle. The wine list had some interesting choices, but few in the $40-60/bottle range.  The mark-up on some of the wines was also higher than I have seen in other restaurants.

We were invited upstairs to the club/bar...but it was PACKED. I will be back to ""Avenue M""",0.9644,0.769,0.211,0.02,0.47884615384615387
2006-07-19,5.0,"great trendy spot - has something for every occasion - nice bar, hot dining area, second-floor lounge, and a super-nice patio.  the drinks and service were spot-on.   best of all, the food was excellent - had a steak sandwich and side at the bar and the food could not have been better - way above your average bar food but the price was right.  I will be back for dinner, drinks, a night out, whatever!   Yes we were here somewhat early on a Wednesday and it wasn't  crowded, but the service in the bar was perfect.",0.9484,0.8,0.183,0.017,0.5873626373626373
2006-04-13,5.0,This super trendy restaurant/lounge just opened up on Milwaukee and is spectacular!  They have so many steak cuts to choose from but I had the grilled salmon and it was amazing!  The steaks looked great and I'll have that next time but the salmon sounded better to me that night.  Then after dinner you can head upstairs to the lounge area where they have a DJ playing great music.,0.9795,0.687,0.293,0.02,0.6518518518518519
