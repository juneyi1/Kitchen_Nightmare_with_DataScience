The one that says 'open'?"" he said while pointing to a sign (about as small as a CD case) set off from the door. ""See how it's pointing towards us? That means we're closed. I'm on break."" I replied by saying that the sign wasn't in a place where people would notice it (as was evident by the other customers in the shop) and that it might be a better idea to lock the door instead of leaving it open for customers to come in. I mean, who am I to enter an open door during business hours expecting to purchase what a store has to offer?

My wife shared my disdain.  The drink had the consistency of ice milk and was devoid of any caramel taste at all.  What a disappointment.

My major gripe is how it consistently looks terrible. 98% of the time there is only one poor person trying to service ten or more people. Even in the the summer. Because this person is obviously mainly focusing on serving people, the rest of the space is severely neglected: sticky counters and tables, trash, etc. The walls are marked with dirt and fingerprints. The tables and chairs are not only visibly cheap but are just beat to hell like old lawn furniture (in fact, I'm sure it is just old lawn furniture). I don't think anyone should get in trouble as it's clear they are doing the best they can, but management should drop in unannounced one day and see how gross it gets when they're under-staffed.

I have tried going there at least 1.5 hours before they close. On 3 occasions, they ran out of liquid nitrogen - absurd, since this is the most important part of their recipe. On a couple more occasions, they ran out of other ingredients. Today I went hoping that they returned to form. First, I wanted hot pudding, but their espresso machine was broken. Not terrible, I thought, because that's not their main product. But when I tried getting ice cream, they were out on all but 1 ingredient I asked for (nutella and chocolate chips, which aren't exactly exotic ingredients) and the flavor I wanted (hazelnut).

I ate half of it on the drive home then gave the remaining half to my boyfriend and it made it just fine without melting all over the place. Yes it takes them a bit long to make orders.. but again keep in mind they are not scooping your order from a tub.. they are making it custom. Stop being so inpatient! I've always found the staff friendly enough. They don't seem like ""AMAZABALLZ! I'M WORKING THE CASHIER AT AN ICE CREAM SHOP HURRAY!!!"" but seriously I'd be a bit worried if they did.. Yes the place is a bit pricey.. but have you ever been to any yogurt/ice cream place in Chicago or Oberweis? HELLO!? They are all expensive! At least this yogurt/ice cream is made fresh with fresh ingredients! I'd pay a bit more for that any day. Now why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5: Taste alone I'd go 5 all the way.. but there were a few things I noticed during my last two stops that make me give iCream 4 stars. The place is definitely small, a little too darkly lit, and when I went to the bathroom it was god awful dirty and the toilet was overflowing. I told them about it and I'm sure they fixed it right away but it was definitely gross.  This place is a start-up so I'm sure once they get enough hype they'll move to a better, bigger, location and be able to pay employees a bit more and therefore get more quality work out of them. Final Verdict: I'll be going back PLENTY for the 'Mom's Favorite' yogurt! My gawd that was good! Plan to wait a bit for your order, pay around 6 bucks for it, and high tail it outta there once it's in your hands and eat outside. \You'll have a great experience then!",0.99,0.762,0.161,0.077,0.5315460927960928

The menu works like this: pick (1): ice cream, sorbet, frozen yogurt, shake, or hot pudding; (2): dessert base of regular, light, organic, soy (VEGAN!), regular or non-fat yogurt; (3): pick one or two flavors and fruit or candy mix-ins from the toppings selection.

My husband had a chocolate ice cream with Reese's Pieces. Our total was $13 -- my jaw dropped. All I had was a small, but my husband had a large -- and I guess they're not cheap. This definitely isn't the place to go for a $1 ice cream cone. We waited ten minutes while our ice cream was being made.

So I was all for ICream.  So I went back a second time with my partner and the second time I wasn't so thrilled. It's an interesting concept, but no one welcomed her the way I was welcomed. They just treated it as a regular old ice cream place where you just give the scoop and call it a day. This could be a really awesome place, but it's all about the experience. When you create that experience for a new person, it makes all the difference. The first guy did that for me and if I were just rating him, he'd have 5 stars, BUT since this is about the entire business, not to much. The rest of the staff didn't seem to enjoy being there and my partner got her icecream with graham crackers and blackberries. She nor I tasted any berries in there. She said she noticed the woman only put in about 3 berries. So that was a bit of a rip off.  Middle of the road place, okay icecream depending on WHO makes it.

The science is not just all steam and excitement, it actually is tasty.  The nitrogen makes smaller ice crystals, and makes the desserts creamier even without cream.

The concept is genius and I can see why they have so many loyal patrons. I came with some friends to catch up and hang out. The set up resembles something you would find in a chemistry lab with their use of beakers and syringes to make the custard base. When choosing your ice cream, it couldn't be more simple. You choose your size, flavor, color and any toppings or mix ins you want. Then, they head over to their KitchenAid stand mixers fitted with nozzles to a vat of liquid nitrogen. They dump the liquid concoction in and let it rip then VOILA! That liquid mixture you saw two seconds ago has become some of the creamiest ice cream I've ever tasted. Here are some great flavor combos: STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE This was delish. We opted for blueberry flavor ice cream with bits of cheesecake, strawberries, graham crackers. The mix-ins really made this! POMEGRANATE WITH RASPBERRIES Again, I loved the fruit-y and refreshing taste of this combination. It was perfect after having such a heavy meal beforehand.

What's cool is that they have both ice cream and frozen yogurt along with a lot of flavors for both. I was more in the mood for yogurt, so yogurt it was.  The sizes didn't seem too much different from each other and the medium was what seems normally a small at many places. Absolutely fine by me, seriously more places need to make smaller portions in the first place. Onto the yogurt itself. I decided on almond and cherry flavors and I was pretty pleased with my choices. Nevermind the awesome liquid nitro display, the flavors were pretty damn good. There were obviously a lot of cherries, but the almonds turned out to be a real nice touch too. This is me now patting myself on the back for choosing such an awesome combination. I do have to comment on the liquid nitro for this. It's sooooooooo friggin cool to watch. Yea, it's as cool as the pic for iCream shows. It almost seems like it's out of a sci-fi show or film and is kinda hypnotic.  I definitely dig iCream.

2012-07-11,5.0,"When I heard that there was a place that combined two deep loves of mine (science and ice cream), I had to try it. I've never been a huge fan of froyo: If I am going to splurge, I want to do so extravagantly. However, I really just wanted to see the liquid nitrogen. You get to choose a flavor of ice cream or yogurt (you can blend two), followed by mix-ins, followed by selecting a color (which I did not know about). I previously made the mistake at Andy's Custards of not having enough mix-ins and regretting it later. I figured that it was worth the extra cost to have something truly memorable. I got a medium caramel and white chocolate ice cream, with peanut butter, peanut butter cup, and nutella mix-ins.  I anxiously awaited as they moved my cup towards the vat of liquid nitrogen. It actually didn't take to long, but it looked awesome. I was wondering how this would affect my concoction as I got my first spoonful.  It was honestly magnificent. The quick freezing really does add texture. There were slightly frozen chunks of nutella and everything was mixed in so well. Each bite was decadent. The price tag was a little high, which normally ends in me docking the rating, but the experience on a whole in tandem with the quality of the product deserves a 5 star rating. I wouldn't come back here monthly, but you should definitely try it if you haven't. Liquid nitrogen is awesome, as is the ice cream!

My friend and I made the trek on a Friday evening (around 9:00 PM) and quickly found parking right across the street from iCream.  Inside was smaller than I expected. There was a short row of stools along the front window, a flat screen tv showing muted Star Wars, and one or two tables way in the back. I would naaaaat go there to hang out - even to eat my ice-cream after it's made for me. It is just too crowded.  The line stretches along the counter and moves with purpose. It does take a few minutes for your treat to be made for you, but the time goes quickly as you watch the process (or the muted Star Wars). My friend and I both agreed that it was worth the wait. We loved our ice-cream concoctions!  Our two treats costs a little over $9. We both got small cups. I would have liked to get shnazzy with my ice-cream experience, but thought that the additional mix-ins and toppings were pricey.  Weird points:  - the menu was a bit confusing: * it was numbered (as if in steps), but number 4 was drinks.  * I know that you can get pudding there too, but I didn't see it on the menu.  * the prices weren't really that clear.  - there was no background music or tv sounds.  - the waiting area (in the front by those tall stools) was pretty crowded.  - it took me a while to figure out where to collect my treat.

Then you pick one of their dozens of flavors and some mix-ins. There are some suggestions of flavors on the wall, but I would just figure out what you want to try the best and go for it.  I opted for the fro-yo that was vanilla flavored. I added in nutella and reese's peanut butter cups and dyed it blue.

""iCream"" sounds like the favorite phrase of either a baby or a pervert. Nominal issues aside, the crazy liquid nitrogen flash-frozen mad scientist ice cream they serve here is a pretty great snack for these hot Chicago summer days. They have a pretty large list of flavors and they can make them into a yogurt, ice cream, or sorbet. You pick the flavor, what kind of frozen whutevathang you want, some toppings, and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I went in around 5 PM on a weekday, and with a few customers ahead of me, it took around 7 minutes to get my lime ice cream with strawberries and gummy bears (don't judge me). While the staff is making iCream - I don't feel so comfortable saying that - you can watch as the fog pours out of the bowls like a witch's cauldron, without all the worms, warts, and stuff.   The ice cream itself is super refreshing, and because of the liquid nitrogen, it's smoother than regular ice cream, with less air pockets, if that makes any sense. There's not much seating in the shop, save for like three little butt-hugger stools (you'll know what I mean when you see them), but it's located right in the heart of Wicker Park, so grabbing a cup and walking around or crazy-people watching outside isn't a terrible option.

We stopped by one afternoon during our week in Chicago - two interlopers from the SF Bay Area ready for a faceoff of two very different LN2 ice cream shops.  You see, there's another place in San Francisco that does the same thing in a very different way.  Chicago being all avant-garde and molecular gastronomy oriented yet midwest has iCream with zillions of flavors and colors mixed on the spot in kitchenaid mixers.  San Francisco has Smitten, with custom designed mixers and something like four all-natural all-organic flavors with no added coloring and a limited number of handmade waffle cones. The shop was pretty empty when we got there, walking from the nearest ""L"" station through a neighborhood that seemed very much like home.  Staff was friendly and gave us plenty of time to make our choices from the vast menu.  Something like two flavors and a color come standard per ice cream.  You can choose a healthy or less healthy ice cream base, or frozen yogurt, which we feared to try.  We hemmed and hawed and thought and eventually got a pinkish cherry/almond thing and a yellow curry/peanut butter concoction. The process was a joy to behold, fog rising from the mixing bowls.  The engineer in me enjoyed looking at all the liquid nitrogen piping and valves, and admired the ingenuity of the way they had integrated it with off-the-shelf mixers.  ( Smitten has their own custom designed machines, which result in a better consistency, but which are no doubt more prone to breaking down. ) The ice cream was decent.  Not great by any means, but good.  The flavors in the cherry almond were way too mild, though the curry ice cream was more clearly flavored.  Which of course brings up the issue: what is the utility, other than the spectacle?  Certainly, the ice cream is no better than you could get elsewhere - sometimes worse.  The answer is - you can make almost anything you want here - it might not come out the best, but if you are into mixing strange concoctions, this is an amazing place.",0.9842,0.788,0.146,0.066,0.49634920634920626

Too many choices to choose from.  Even to start off, you need to choose a base for your icream, with regular & reduced fat ice cream, soymilk, yogurt, and sorbet.  I think I also saw some hot pudding.  Then you have the huge list of flavors, mix-ins, and colorings to choose from.  I couldn't decide, so just went with one of the pre-made mashups.  I got the Momma's favorite, which was made of chocolate ice cream, nutella, and raspberries.  It took a little less then 10 minutes to make and I line was quickly forming, since the owner was working alone that night.  It was worth the wait, as I really enjoyed my ice cream and definitely notice the unique texture.  I'll definitely try some of the crazier ingredients next time, maybe some curry?",0.9841,0.814,0.167,0.018,0.5071761571761572

Last night, upon finding my favorite spot (Forever Yogurt) closed, I desperately searched for a substitute place. My criteria was only that it was frozen yogurt and open late (it was already 9:45!) iCream was open until 10, and when I walked in, the man behind the counter was wonderfully nice, and very helpful as he explained how everything works. After making my decision, I watched him create my magically frozen treat.  I gave this place two stars for the actual product. While all the flavors to choose from sounded good, and watching the magic happen was fun... I have to say, I was craving yogurt, and my yogurt just tasted like really bland ice cream. My friend got a banana flavored yogurt, and when I asked to try a bite, I could hardly even swallow... the banana tasted like chemicals to me...not like real banana.  To me, it's just not worth the $20+ that was spent. I would much rather get my money's worth buying Breyer's in a carton, or hitting up Cold Stone Creamery... my frozen yogurt cravings are a serious business, and need to be treated with only the best of the best yogurt.

You can add flavors to the ice cream (the liquids other people mentioned), as well as mix-ins (pieces of fruit, candy, etc.).  The staff is super friendly and patient as you try to cope with the overload of choices.  Most importantly, if you've chosen wisely, it tastes REALLY good.  I've had the light ice cream twice, and my husband had the soy twice - both super yummy.

As much as I love anything involving fog and liquid nitrogen, both of those be damned: Not only was the place sterile and uninviting (essentially a narrow bar with a few dingy white stools and large nitrogen dispensers), but the staff seemed positively unenthusiastic.  I imagine its a similar feeling shared by KISS' pyroteam: the wonder wore off after the first world tour and now they just want the check.  Speaking of my love of fog (which I'm certain stems from a deep-rooted appreciation of the aforementioned band) the only grace -- and not even a saving one as it was far too fleeting -- was the liquid nitrogen mists billowing from the food processors.  It was purdy.   In the end though, my Small cup of chocolate, soy (or rice, I can't recall) milk based iced concoction was less creamy treat and more frost-bitten, taupe colored chunks of disaster.  Lifeless, passionless, with a similar taste to the cardboard HALP ME sign the Crusties who haunt Wicker Park keep in tow... I assume.  I rarely throw away food I purchase while eating out; even if its bad I try to reach some kind of compromise with the establishment to reach a culinary conclusion that's satisfactory to all parties. Even more rare is tossing out a dessert.

We were only two customers in a small handful that had wandered in off Milwaukee that winter day, but the employees were super attentive and helpful as we stood with our mouths gaping open at the menu. One guy even grabbed one of the flavor extracts--Burnt Sugar--so I could get a sense of it since he said most people either love it or hate it. I loved it and ordered ice cream with Burnt Sugar and Honey, mixed with crumbled graham crackers. DELICIOUS. I think next time I might even order caramel sauce for topping. My friend ordered a green tea and honey mix, which was delightfully light and tasted like a green tea smoothee thickened and sweetened up. I will say that I expected the consistency of the ice cream to be noticeably different from regular ice cream. I didn't really notice that, but the joys of getting to choose my own flavors was enough to really satisfy me. My only other slightly negative comment would be that I am so not a fan of fluorescent lighting and don't like feeling like I'm in a laboratory when I'm devouring a treat that reminds me of my childhood. The base options are extensive outside of regular ice cream, even with low-fat and soy ice creams, sorbets and frozen yogurts.

I got an Irish cream pudding, and Diana got a chocolate and banana flavored pudding.  Both of them were fantastic, but Diana's was actually a mistake.  She wanted a chocolate pudding with bananas mixed in, but got a half banana, half chocolate flavored pudding instead.  No stars off for that, though, because that probably had more to do with how I worded the order than anything else, and anyway, it cost less as a result.   Maybe it was for the best that she didn't get the mix-in.  The next day we came back so Diana's mom could try it, and that time she ordered hazelnut pudding with bananas mixed in.  She was disappointed when she only got five tiny slices of banana in it.  When you can get a pound of bananas for $.50 at the store, paying the same amount for a few small pieces seems like a bit much.  But that does not change the fact that it all tasted very good.

I glanced up at the big menu board, and much have looked a bit overwhelmed, as the girl behind the counter inquired if I'd ever been to iCream before. I said I hadn't and she explained the process to me. I think other reviewers have adequately covered the process, so I won't repeat that. I went with a low fat frozen yogurt with white chocolate flavor and peanut butter mixed in. After watching my special creation made in what I can only assume was a magic witch's cauldron, it was ready to eat. First impression: it looked a little soupy. The taste? Very good. Maybe I just have a knack for mixing flavors or I got lucky, but I was very happy with the taste of my little (ok medium) treat. The texture was smooth and creamy and the peanut butter was mixed in evenly. But like I said, it was soupy. It was already a bit melty when it was handed to me and it continued to liquifty rapidly. It only took me a few minutes to eat, but at the end I had to drink what was left out of the bowl. If that is the norm, I understand why they don't offer cones; they would never hold up. The process of making my treat was pretty quick. Not much longer than it would take to make a Blizzard at the DQ. However, I was the only one in the store at the time, and I could see it getting backed up quickly if there's a rush. In fact when I walked past the place later over the weekend there were a bunch of people waiting in the front.

I have mentioned my obsession with PB/Banana ice cream/yogurt before.  I thought going to i cream would remedy my local need for such treats.  No. So, you pick a flavor for your ice cream (or a couple).  The flavors are juices they inject (although, they said they are extracts, i.e. banana flavor would be extracted from a real banana).   So the flavor isn't ""fresh banana"" i.e. it's not blended smooth to make the ice cream a new flavor. Then, you pick mix ins or toppings.  These are mix ins just like you'd have at cold stone or in a blizzard.  They're just mixed really well, not blended (so the ice cream will have chunks of your mix in). I had Vanilla flavor ice cream with PB/Banana mix in.  1. The vanilla flavor was cheap.  It didn't taste vanilla-y. 2. I liked the texture of the ice cream, yay liquid nitrogen. 3. The PB and banana was chunky mix-in, like cold stone.   The bonus is that they HAVE peanut butter as a mix in (most places don't), the drawback is that .the ice cream itself just isn't that good.

2009-07-12,2.0,"I created a Yelp account to write this review. This place is hilarious. Not in a good way. Well, sort of in a good way.  a) They really ought to have rethought the name. I mean ew. b) I guess it's supposed to be Apple-y, but really, all I could think of in this place was the TV room from Willy Wonka. Which is actually cool, although not, you know, that welcoming. c) I went on a warm Saturday evening with two friends. I'd heard good things, and, as it was my first trip, I went with something simple: organic ice cream in the burnt sugar flavor, having been told the flavor was good (""like creme brulee"") by the girl (woman) behind the counter. The idea of blue-dyed ice cream did not appeal, so I went with no color, as did my friends. One friend ordered the light ice cream in hazelnut with chocolate chips, and the other ordered the frozen yogurt in burnt sugar with cookie dough. The wait wasn't long and the service was really friendly and helpful. Although there's not much you can do to ""help"" a product which is so terrible that it makes you laugh out loud. My iCream (see, gross) came out (sorry) first. It tasted like burnt plastic frosting, which had then been frozen. The texture, I guess, was fine, but who could tell when the ice cream was so sweet that I got that tickly feeling in my cheeks and jaw. I took another bite. I could not help making a face and laughing. I passed it to my friends. Same reaction. We decided to withhold final judgment, because if you order something called ""burnt sugar ice cream,"" it seems sort of stupid to be surprised when it's absurdly sweet. I acknowledge this. The hazelnut ice cream, when it was ready, tasted no better. It was like the hazelnut syrup they use in coffee shops had been passed through a tin foil strainer and added to an even more plasticky-tasting ice cream. Inedible. Equally sweet. ""Maybe the frozen yogurt is better,"" we said to the last friend. This friend is very polite and easy-to-please, unlike, arguably, the first two of us. She took a bite. ""No,"" she said quietly. ""It is not."" It was not. I don't know if I can explain the offensive nature of this frozen yogurt, but for one thing, it had the texture--the EXACT texture--of the paste you use for collages, etc., when you are in kindergarten. I know this because I widely sampled the paste inventory of my kindergarten classroom.  And the flavor was . . . worse. Awful.  ""Let's talk about this outside,"" said hazelnut friend, because we didn't want to be rude. We moved toward the exit. This next part I feel really bad about, and that's why iCream, despite selling, across the three samples I tried, the worst ice cream I have ever eaten, receives two stars: The girl who had sold us the ice cream had overheard us, although I really do think we were talking at a reasonably discreet level (although, uh, I guess not), and stopped us at the door. ""I don't want you to leave unhappy,"" she said. ""Please let us make you something else."" She didn't say it in a sassy way at all, but really kindly, as though she just believed in the product and wanted us to enjoy it. We said we felt terrible that she had heard us, but that we would come back another time to try again. ""No you won't,"" she said. ""Please let us make you something else."" She was still really nice, but sounded, after about 60 seconds, almost desperate. We promised to go back sometime and finally escaped.

I do not recommend iCream based on the unsurpassed heinousness of the product. But I think of it fondly, because of the entertainment it has provided me. Every time today that I have thought back on that burnt sugar monstrosity, I get that tingly, horrible feeling of TOO SWEET, and I laugh.

2009-07-09,3.0,"I'm moving to the neighborhood and now will be less than 2 blocks away from icream.  Hmmm, pretty dangerous.  But I guess not too dangerous because it's $3.50 for the small, and that doesn't include mix-ins.  Plus Coldstone is on North Ave, and on Milwaukee and Paulina there's Oberweiss and Baskin Robbins.... Really cute idea to make your own ice cream, fro yo, sorbet or hot pudding.  They also have coffee drinks too.  Everything is a bit pricey, but it's custom, and the cost of the equipment is rolled into the price.  3 of us went last night, ordered 1 small and 2 mediums, and it was about $17. First time I went I got green tea flavored frozen yogurt.  No mix-ins.  It was pretty awful.  I was expecting sweet fro yo, like TCBY, but instead got that Pinkberry stuff that's sour, like real yogurt.  Gross.  I kept adding the powdered vanilla to it to make it palatable.  I will never get the fro yo again.  That night was cold and my friend got the hot pudding, it was surprising good!  It got a little TOO pudding-y at the end though, I kind of wish it had a hard top though, like a souffle, to breakup the consistency.   Went for the 2nd time last night.  I was smarter this time and kept with the basics.  Ice cream (light) with white chocolate flavor, and strawberries mixed in.  It was lovely.  One ""complaint"" is that the strawberries were mixed in too early so the ones on the bottom were frozen solid.  I ordered a small, and it was maybe 10-12 oz?  There was actually so much it came out over an inch above the top of the cup. Do NOT order the gum ball mix-in.  It's not like the chewy little gum pieces you get in bubble gum candy.  They were actually big gum balls they put in at the last minute.  You can get them mixed in or just on top.  My friend actually spit them all out because it was too much.  At least it didn't add/subtract to the flavor of the actual ice cream. There were about 7 people in line before us, our wait wasn't that bad, maybe 10 min, but the wait goes by fast because it's fun watching all the stuff get made, and figuring out ""is that mine?""  But when it's not, boo. The people taking the orders at the register both times were very nice, had a lot of patience, and were very helpful.  I guess it's their job when pretty much everyone that comes in doesn't know what they're in for.

If you didn't like it, you should give it another shot and try one of their recommended flavors. It's pretty obvious that the ability to get ANY flavor combo you want can potentially be a minefield, but there should be some stuff that obviously doesn't go together. A month before I went to iCream, my parents (who were in town for the weekend) had gone and my mother foolishly got peach and peanut flavors mixed (I'd call it the Georgia special). Heeding her warning, I took a bit more conservative tack. I got a peanut butter and burnt sugar base with heath bars and reese's peanut butter cups. While the wait was long, I was with friends, so it wasn't a huge big deal. And since I'm kind of incredibly nerdy, the whole process was enjoyable, because watching them make people's orders is actually quite cool. It did come out a little soft, but it was really tasty.

Double-you tee eff, mate?!  In addition to the wait, the shop is just plain dirty.  Spent napkins, drops of spilled ice cream, and other random strata besmirched the otherwise snowy white counters. Worst of all, some of their creations just don't taste that great.  The green machine sorbet, enhanced with lime and peach, was cloyingly sweet.  A real shame, because the quick freeze process leaves the product with a beautifully creamy texture, due to under-developed ice crystals.  However, a creation of soy ice cream with chocolate and coffee flavoring was exceptional.

Alas, we didn't get to use the computers for whatever reason we weren't told. Instead we got a surly, short haired girl who didn't seem to like the fact that I polluted the earth with my kids and their indecisive minds. When I made a comment about using the computer, she asked if I didn't want to deal with her. Awkward silence. I made sure to have my kids know exactly what they wanted before stepping up to the counter to make the process move quicker. They have a great selection of ice cream, yougurt and soy based products. Any flavor you could ask for was available and the add in's we numerous. It does take awhile for your creation to get made but it was a quiet night in there so it wasn't too cramped waiting. The ice cream was good, not great. I think it was very comparable to Cold Stone in taste, size, and price. I don't think I'll go back. It wasn't an awe aspiring experience. I would be just as happy at Dairy Queen a few blocks down, Cold Stone or Baskin Robins.",0.9604,0.839,0.114,0.047,0.5648989898989899

After my last create-your-own-flavor fiasco I decided to play it safe going with a small mint, Oreo ice cream - a flavor combo I knew I liked.

My small treat ran me $4, which wasn't bad since I thought the portion was pretty darn generous. After I placed my order I settled in to watch the show.

My safe flavor choice didn't fail me, maybe next time I'll study the menu online and come prepared with something a little more adventurous.  My only complaint/critique is regarding the output of the treats. The process looks pretty involved and therefor is kind of slow, it doesn't take much to create a crowd of people waiting.

However, unlike Stogo, and unlike any other ice cream shop I've been to, iCream doesn't have any tubs full of flavors to choose from. Instead, you choose what flavor(s) you want and the staff then makes the ice cream on the spot, with fancy machines (which you can watch through glass) and sophisticated computer touch-screens. It was like something out of Star Trek. They have vegan soy varieties of every flavor (except for white chocolate). I asked them to produce a mixture of chocolate and hazelnut which came out tasting pretty good, though not great (iCream is definitely not of the quality of Lula's or Stogo, both in NYC): the texture was a little bit icy, and the flavors didn't gel quite properly. This was especially true of my friend's combination of ""burnt sugar"" flavor and hazelnut, which had an overpowering after-taste of the hazelnut. That said, I like the concept of the place. Single scoops cost $4 (there's an extra charge for soy), and we waited at least 10 or 15 minutes for our order (it was sort of busy, but not packed by any means). Like most things veg-related in Chicago, iCream is a compromise: it still serves dairy ice cream and isn't 100% vegan.

I can't imagine what they paid in rent for all those months with basically no product to sell. First time I visited iCream, i got raspberry frozen yogurt, no mix-ins, with a yellow color. It literally was yogurt, poured into a mixer with liquid nitrogen to freeze it. It tasted like I was eating Dannon that had been in the freezer. It was actually kind of bland though. Not very tangy, not very sweet, not very much of anything except a faint raspberry flavor. The yellow was super bright and pretty though. Second time I went, I wanted chocolate ice cream, but I was informed that the red color I wanted wouldn't show up in chocolate. I guess I should have known that, since chocolate is obviously very dark brown. But I had hope, and I'm glad the girl at the counter told me ahead of time so i didnt end up with some nasty reddish brown ice cream. So i got peppermint ice cream, with chocolate chips, and a red color. The girl comped the additional 75 cents for the chocolate chips because the whole red chocolate thing didnt work out, which was unnecessary but nice. My boyfriend got green vanilla with gummy bears.  My red turned out to be pink, and with no chocolate chips, so I told the girl. She offered to make it over again for me but I said it would be fine if she just poured some chips over the top, I'm not that difficult. The vanilla flavor of my boyfriend's order was very good, but my peppermint was again a little bland. So far the best part about this place is the texture: I'm in love with the smooth creaminess.

Got here with three others about an hour before it closed and checked out the menu for the first time.  Pick a size, flavor, and color for free.  Mix ins are cost extra per mix in as you go.   After much deliberation, we each chose a medium with a variety of mix ins, only to find that three out of the four of ours we would likely not get again.  The one that was actually quite good was the hazelnut/burnt sugar ice cream that one of our friends picked out.  The straight coffee was somewhat weak in flavor, the cider was average... and even though we requested colors, they came out odd looking (orange turned into brown, blue turned into green, etc.) While it's true you make your own flavors, paying six dollars for ice cream that you don't really enjoy that much just doesn't cut it for me.  If you're going to claim to be able to color the ice cream, make sure you have a formula to perfect that color.  (I expected bright orange ice cream, not light brown, much like my fiancee expected bright blue ice cream, not green).  Also, the idea of using commercial food extracts to create the flavors is well... not quite tasty.  While these flavoroids work well in dishes, using them as the basis for the flavor to be highlighted (like ice cream) leaves you realizing just how fake the flavor is.   Excellent idea, but requiring refinement... may I suggest you incorporate the food in a fresh form directly some how (use actual roasted coffee with milk, or cider, not just a few drop of flavoring) so that the ice cream's flavors aren't generically commercial. Verdict:  Would I go back?  Not for the price and for the ingredients used... while the concept of using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream is neat, we really don't get to see much of anything except the ""smoke"" from the production... and be disappointed with the taste/flavor there after.",0.952,0.866,0.098,0.036,0.4621447028423772

We went Friday afternoon and I was surprised at how busy it was since it was cold and everyone was supposed to be at work or school. There was also a news crew filming. Since the place isn't very big, it seemed crowded.  The employees were incredibly friendly and they took the time to explain how the process works and how the menu worked, even though I thought it was pretty self explanatory. Because I was getting over food poisoning I thought it would be best to have a fruit smoothie. I had the mango based smoothie, with banana and peaches added. Because of the aforementioned illness, I decided to skip anything solid in my drink even though I had that option. My sister had ice cream, pomegranate based, flavored with green tea, blueberries on top, colored purple. The cashier took our name and we went and sat down on the bench to wait. The girl next to us already had her pink ice cream concoction, and while I thought it looked pretty disgusting, she absolutely loved it and couldn't stop gushing about it. After 5 minutes, our names were called and we got our treats. My smoothie was pretty safe, so of course it was amazing. I was a little hesitant on the green tea pomegranate, but it was pretty amazing as well. I didn't try and of the blueberries on top, but they were giant and looked very fresh. My sister approved of them. I absolutely loved this place. The prices were cheap too, considering all your options and everything you can get. It's also open until midnight, which is great if you want a treat after a couple drinks. I'd be a little concerned during the summer though.

The idea is interesting....you use liquid nitrogen to freeze the cream and thus you have ice cream on the spot, however, our experience of the product was sub par....I didn't finish it.   The ice cream lacked taste, was bland and the consistency was similar to cheese curds vs a creamy blend of ice cream.  If I was consulting for their business, I would recommend to analyze if they are getting repeat customers.    I know they just opened, but If you're only getting first timers like myself -- you have a problem and this metric will alert you.  I want to see their biz succeed,   I think the idea sells but the product doesn't.   Vanilla and chocolate are the most common types of ice cream, start improving those first.  Yes, like some other people on her mentioned, it may take you some time to order.  I timed it, it took 13 minutes.  The location is good though.",0.9738,0.832,0.144,0.024,0.5416666666666666

I could see how the wait for your ice cream could get excruciatingly long since its not a simple scoop and serve process. Overall, its quite a novel idea, I'm just not sure how sustainable it is.  Although I don't live right around the corner, if I did, I probably wouldn't make iCream a regular stop on my search for sweets.  But, I think you definitely need to go experience iCream at least once for yourself!",0.9865,0.768,0.19,0.042,0.4821023832134944

2009-03-11,4.0,"LIQUID NITROGEN IS F*CKIN' COOL  And making ice cream with it is just an awesome idea.  THE CONCEPT: Basically they have Dr. Octopus arms hanging from the ceiling that dispense liquid nitrogen into Kitchen-Aid mixers filled with your ingredients of choice. Extra points for letting people choose between milk, yogurt, or soy.  THE SHOW: Once the liquid nitrogen starts flowing, it's a fun sight to behold. The billowing wisps of super-chilled air, the whirl of the mixers, and the chilling thought in the back of your head that the person making your ice cream could potentially turn into a popsicle in a tragic liquid nitrogen accident.  THE PRODUCT: Delicious! The liquid nitrogen freezes the milk instantly and the result is very tiny ice crystals that give the ice cream a smooth, velvety mouth feel. The liquid nitrogen method also opens the door for a ton of new flavors and possibilities. Love gummy bears? You could add the gummy bears w/ the liquid nitrogen up front, pulverizing them and incorporating their flavor into the ice cream itself instead of just being a topping.  Regarding all the negative reviews early on...it appears that iCream just had a grand reopening perhaps because things didn't go smoothly the first time around.

The lady called out ""um..chocolate icecream, banana, and blueberry""...clearly did not sound like mine so I just stood there. No one owned up so I thought I'd ask about the chocolate part and see if she meant nutella. She didn't even have the order receipt to tell me definitively if it was. And blueberries?? When I asked the cashier about whether that was my order (since I was the last person that he took order from)...he was very confused and was like, did you want banana and nutella? I said yes, but I didn't order blueberries. He was like, ""huh??"" seriously dude, confused much? I just took that order and left. It was nutella...with blueberries. I didn't mind the mix up, but was just thinking...if someone was allergic to blueberries and you are as confused about the order as the people that made it for you, wouldn't that be a little shady? I guess I had a really really confusing experience and they definitely need to tighten up their ship or people would be very turned off.

2008-08-16,3.0,"It's a cool concept. I talked to the owner for awhile and she said that she was inspired by Flattop, which she loves, and wanted to create something similar for ice cream, where everything--from the fat content to the sugar content to the mix-ins to the flavor--was DIY. This is how it works. You pick a base: ice cream, sorbet, frozen yogurt. Within those categories, you have a choice of fat content (i.e. I had frozen yogurt and could choice low-fat or no-fat). Then you pick a flavor (there are about 20: the normal ones plus a few innovative ones like white mocha, etc.). The flavors are in the form of a liquid base. And then you can add a mix-in, like butterfingers or chocolate chips or the like. And then a topping and a color (some of the flavors are not colored, so Chris got chocolate but then added a brown color to make it look like normal chocolate). All of this is just liquid, so they mix it together and put it in a blender with liquid nitrogen. Mix, mix, mix, and it turns into a frozen mass. I would give the place an A for effort and innovativeness. But the product was not great. My husband got chocolate with peanut-butter-cup mix-in. The chocolate was very very bitter. Almost unsweetened. It was tolerable, but only for a few bites. I got pistachio and it was completely inedible. Like, I walked out of the store and threw it away. There was a number of people there that were complaining about the taste and they were re-doing them. I really WANT them to succeed. It's a cool idea. Molecular gastronomy for ice cream is nothing short of innovative.  Plus, I liked the owner. She was very attentive to what people thought and how to change the product. But in the meantime, there are a LOT of kinks to be worked out, including flavor.... Maybe if you plan to go, I'd recommend sticking with the simple flavors for now--i.e. not pistachio.",0.98,0.842,0.126,0.032,0.6027210884353742
