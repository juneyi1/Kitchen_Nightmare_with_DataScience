I feel like the restaurant is at a bit of a disadvantage because of the cavernous warehouse-like space.  It's not very bright and airy and although funky retro decor and colors have been introduced, it's a hard space to make pleasant.  Details like plastic plates also lend a bit of a gritty, greasy spoon kind of feel.

And I mean, excellent. The decor, atmosphere, food, drinks and waitstaff were all perfect. The space made our wedding reception really different and fun, and everyone loved the casual comfort food. Delish! The staff was very receptive and the entire night went off without a hitch. So all in all, the wedding reception was a great success. But... getting to that point was like pulling teeth. Although the management is friendly, they were extremely difficult to work with. We're pretty low stress, but we're very organized. Them? High stress, unorganized -- not really what you want from your reception venue. They were non-responsive to emails and phone calls; we often had to email back and forth 5-6 times just to get something like a cost estimate. That should be easy, but not with Kitsch'n River North. Multiple times they over-explained why they were too busy to respond to us or why it wasn't their fault. Seriously? Sorry, I thought this was your job... But then again, in the end, everything went great. Hence, we're torn. Would I have a party here again? Yes, I definitely would because it's cheap, funky and different. (The cheapness IS a major factor though. It's about half the cost of any other options near downtown.)  I would recommend this party/reception venue for anyone who has a lot of time to follow up on details and is willing to do it all themselves.

2009-03-01,2.0,"Ok, so I was super stoked about going to brunch here today.  I ran a 5k and was pretty hungry by the time we got there! turns out there was a wait (to be expected on a Sunday morning I guess) but a 45 minute wait?  Not my idea of fun.  What was fun though was the brightly colored walls, comfy couches and chairs and even a few tv's to watch while we were waiting.   We were seated and promptly ordered the $2 Mimosas.  Our server brought them out promptly...and that was the end of our good service. There was 6 of us, it took at least 35 minutes for our food.  One of my friends orders had been messed up so she waited another 10 minutes for her food.  In this time, our server came back twice...once when I flagged her down to order hot chocolate (which was only luke-warm chocolate) and the second was when she brought back my hot chocolate which she set down in front of someone else at the table...she walked by several times after our food was brought out (by someone else) before stopping to ask how things were...we had to tell her one meal was missing-she didn't even notice...and she was standing right next to the person with the missing food. the food was ok.  Not great by any means.  I ordered one of the specials-Eggs Benedict.  It wasn't actually special at all.  The english muffin was a little soggy, the canadian bacon was over cooked and all shriveled up.  The egg and hollandaise sauce were actually really good.  There was a little rosemary in the sauce which added a nice flavor...there just wasn't enough sauce to start with. When the bill came we asked if she could split it, she said not unless we wanted to be there another hour (which we didn't) so we figured out how to make it work.  Also I was a little annoyed that gratuity had already been added.   A party of 6 is not an uncommonly large party.  Gratuity shouldn't be added unless its a party of 8 or more.   I'm wondering if the automatic gratuity policy for 6 or more is the reason our service was so poor.  She did comp my friends meal with out being asked so that was nice. I was really let down after eating here. I had really high hopes but I don't think I'll be going back.",0.9937,0.81,0.147,0.043,0.45259637188208623

Staff is generally crappy, though there is one freckled gal there who always have a smile and is very helpful; the worker dudes there are basically useless.  Oh yeah, you want take out, it won't be ready in 15 minutes, but at least you won't get your order messed up at the next door place at Motel Bar...

While the Southern Fried Chicken Club that I had was tasty and enjoyable, and their rosemary-garlic mashed potatoes tasted as homemade and authentic as mom's, I think I could get a better spicy chicken sandwich at Popeye's. Sorry, Kitsch'n, but Popeye's chicken sandwich is hard to beat!!

The one thing, however, that might bring me back to this place is the giant heaping bowl of brownie batter. Wow. It was good and the big ol' warm cookies that it was served with could have doubled as another dessert, themselves.  I don't know what they do to make it---they could use raw eggs, boxed brownie mix, whatever.

So, we dropped in there this afternoon and I went ""can't mess it up"" and ordered a Cobb Salad.  The blue cheese dressing wasn't up to snuff (too runny) and not enough (I had to request one more serving of it).  However, my wife loved the BLT and ordered it on both visits.  I had a corner of the sandwich and it was damn good.  Fresh avocado and tasty bacon.

While the service was pretty good and the prices are quite reasonable, I can't get past the fact that the food was so subpar.  Personally, I prefer the Kitsch'n on Roscoe much more, but that might be because I've only had brunch there and I have much lower standards when it comes to things like bacon, eggs and pancakes.",0.7953,0.87,0.083,0.047,0.6044444444444443
