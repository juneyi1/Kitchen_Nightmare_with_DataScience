2017-07-10,4.0,"I met up to have Sunday brunch with a friend and she chose this restaurant (located in the hotel). I didn't have the heart to tell her that the yelp reviews were horrendous since this was only a 8 minute walk from her condo. Plus I didn't want to be that person who's all, ""oh, choose whatever you want!"" and then shoot down the idea, haha.  We get there a little past 10am and the entire place is dead. Not one single person. We were seated immediately and coffees were brought right away. I ordered the beef brisket with diced potatoes and a poached egg, and she ordered the lobster soft scramble. My beef brisket dish had good flavor overall but the brisket itself was pretty dry. Portion sizes were normal and prices were very high (~$22-25 a dish). It is the Gold Coast area after all.  Ambiance was nice though and the decor is really unique. The location itself has historic value, and there are photographs downstairs of all the famous celebrities that have visited. I can imagine this place doing better in the evening for drinks, as it has that loungey feel.  All in all, this is probably more a 3.5 star. Service was very good and attentive, food tasted good, ambiance was nice, but prices are very steep especially for what you get.",0.9795,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.5927103174603173

2017-07-05,3.0,"Pump Room caught my eye because of the decor. The menu was plain and the reviews weren't great, but I really wanted to go because of the champagne bubble decor. Came here on a Sunday night and it was not full at all. Pump Room is attached to a hotel in Gold Coast and easy to spot. Service was not super attentive or friendly, but I hardly care about that. The food is what got me. The entrees are mostly $30, so I opted for the tagliatelle, the cheapest entree on the menu at $22. Plus, I love pasta, so it was a win, or so I thought. The tagliatelle was topped with Meyer lemon cream parmesan and black pepper. I disliked it so much that I couldn't even finish the dish, which is unusual for me. They gave a good amount of pasta for one meal, but the lemon cream sauce was borderline inedible. It tasted like a lemon tart and the parmesan cheese was not helping. It seemed like the chefs were trying too hard to make the pasta savory and sweet.  My boyfriend got the snapper for $34. It was probably the size of a deck of cards. Definitely not worth the money, but at least it was seasoned and cooked well. I don't have any other complaints except for the portion. The best part of this experience was that they asked us what occasion it was, and after I said our anniversary, they brought chocolates for us. They were also super friendly about taking pictures and knew how to get the bubbles in the background. If your only desire to come here is for the picture, I would just recommend taking the picture and going somewhere else to eat.",0.9928,0.744,0.187,0.069,0.5339065255731922

Now the actual experience... I ordered a black truffle pizza and a glass of the house red.  That combo in itself was enough to seal the deal.  Service was attentive but not intrusive, nor was it stuffy.  I dined with a friend and ended up paying around $100 all-in between the two of us.  When eating at a place like this, you definitely pay for the atmosphere as well.

2017-02-13,1.0,"Pump Room, pumping out the worst meal/meals I've experienced in Chicago. Chef should convert Pump Room into a pizzeria because that's the level this place is at. The ""special"" dish of short ribs needed a steak knife and someone suffering from dysgeusia to be able to enjoy it. Caked in cheap bbq sauce and salt it was almost as unappetizing as the side dishes. The side dishes were either prepared for a patron coming in late after an all night bender or for a child that you have to disguise the fact you're feeding them vegetables. Nothing is done in moderation or in a way to enjoy the main item you're ordering, except for the filet, the filet was a piece of meat cooked perfectly to medium rare and left to absorb flavor from the china at which it sat.   Service was friendly but weak. You shouldn't go thirsty after ordering a bottle of wine nor should you have to endure an entire meal without a cocktail that was ordered just before the food was coming out. Halfway through the soup appetizers we were offered pepper. Uneatable meal (short ribs) was not comped but was replaced and not in a timely fashion at all.

Still, he ushered us to the bar, explaining they needed more time to prep. It soon became obvious that this was a ploy to get us to order overpriced cocktails, as we were left sitting for over 20 minutes, pressured to order several times.  I finally had to walk back to the host (whose stand was a mere ten feet away from us at the bar) and asked when we would be seated. ""Oh, you should have gotten a text from me saying that your table was ready"" he explained without apology. There was no text on my phone. And even if there had been, was it THAT hard to simply walk the five paces over to the bar and grab our attention in person? Awkward. Moving on to the food- we both compared it to airline cuisine. Overly salty fries, undercooked and fishy salmon...The one bright spot was the appetizer flatbread, which was still hardly worth the cost.

2016-10-17,1.0,"This past weekend I attempted to go there for dinner. Mind you, I had made reservations over a week ago. When i called and made the reservation I specifically told the woman on the phone that I wanted to be seated at the Frank Sinatra booth. She said I will make a note and see what i can do. I then told her that if it wasn't guaranteed that I have that booth that I didn't want to make the reservation. She said they usually only reserved it for big parties, but that it was available and it wouldn't be a problem.  So I was celebrating a special occasion with my boyfriend.  We arrive on time for our reservation and they try to sit me somewhere else. I let the host know that requested a specific seat. She leaves and another woman comes and tells me that the table is on a first come first serve basis and that she wished I would've spoke with her. So because you have someone answering the phones and taking reservations that obviously doesn't know what she's talking about how is that my fault? All I was offered for their huge mistake was a different table or a reservation for another day.  None of those options were going to help because obviously I was celebrating that special occassion that night, not any other night. I also wouldn't have made a reservation at all If I had known It was for nothing. Pump Room ruined what was supposed to be a special night and in my opinion didn't do much to try to resolve the problem or make up for their mistake.  We ended up leaving and not dining with them and leaving.",0.988,0.818,0.146,0.036,0.4581845238095238
2016-10-10,4.0,"The food in this place is well done, however I think the customer service leaves a little bit to be desired. My fiance and I came here for our engagement night dinner and did the tasting menu. Everything on the tasting menu was very well done: 1. The first course was sushi and was hands-down the best thing I ate during the meal. It was very well balanced, very fresh, and textually pleasant 2. The pasta, while cooked well and with an interesting flavor (very technically difficult to get lemon and cream together without a curdle) was a tad heavy for me  3. The tomato soup was good but not mind blowing, I also felt that the grilled cheese on the side was proportionally small to the soup size. 4. The polenta fries were excellent and and the short rib, while very well cooked was my least favorite portion of the meal (it was way too sweet) 5. The dessert was this strange popcorn, ice cream, chocolatey thing; nothing to write home about but it was tasty Here are the things that I did not like: 1. Customer Service: No one explained anything on the tasting menu to us. Literally, people would just walk up and dump plates in from of us and walk away. This was problematic because our server had taken our menus so we literally had no reference point and were trying to remember the descriptions of things we read when we first arrived. 2. There was wayyyyy too much time in between each course. Some of the times were over 15 minutes after we had finished eating the dish so we just had to sit there. It was too much time to wait. 3. They were short staffed on the night when were were there (one of the hosts let my finance know) so this meant we could not things are quickly as we would have liked. I'll definitely go back--hopefully they will be fully staffed next time!",0.8102,0.838,0.098,0.064,0.48086419753086423

I was so confused that I didn't even want to pursue the issue.  We were told we had a few drinks with Ketel One and that was an upgraded vodka.  Now, only 1 of the guests asked for Ketel One, so I'm not sure why the charge was for like $76.  Anyhow, whatever it was, I didn't like how it went down so I had to take a few stars away for it.  I'm by no means cheap when it comes to paying a bill, but I need explanations and don't like shady charges being thrown around.  I don't even like questioning a bill but this was just weird.",0.9248,0.847,0.109,0.044,0.4487734487734487

I feel like we did not get the experience or service one might expect from a restaurant of Jean-George's caliber. The only saving grace is that the food was prepared well and delicious.  First, the catering contact given to me misused my personal email address for her own business purposes (I guess she is a real estate agent on the side as now I'm getting Chicago real estate listings and market information). I absolutely did not give her permission to use  my email for this purpose. This is completely unprofessional and violation of privacy. On the day of the party, there were not enough place settings for my guests despite having signed a finalized banquet order with the correct number. The servers had to scramble to correct this by adding an extra table, place settings and seats. This was awkward for my guests and embarrassing to me as the host. The birthday cake had the wrong inscription on it despite the correct one being clearly set out in the banquet order.  We did not have coffee and tea service which was prepaid for with the cake and at the end of the meal. It was completely skipped.  They initially overcharged me and did not credit the deposit I had paid several months ago which was supposed to be applied to the final bill. I realized this the next day and was alarmed that it was not included making me believe that I was being overcharged. This was resolved when I called a few days later and it has been credited back to my card.  In the end, a lot of extra work and stress on my end despite being charged a 22% service fee.

Turning to the food, on the recommendation of our server, we started the meal with the pretzel dusted calamari with spicy maranara and mustard aioli dipping sauces.  The calamari was lukewarm by the time it got to us and the pretzel coating made it very salty.  We also tried the tuna tartare, which came on an avocado bed and was topped with radish in a bowl of ginger dressing.  There was just too much dressing and nothing to balance out the wetness of the dish.  It could've really used some crostini or crackers to put the tartare on. For my entree, I got the lobster, which was small and overcooked and had too much seasoning that overpowered the lobster.  For dessert, we were there for my mom's birthday so they gave us a free deep dish cookie dessert, which sounds better than it was.  It was a hard block of cookie that was probably previously moist on the inside but was hard by the time it got to our table.   I've come here for their cocktails before which is always a fun time but dinner was kind of a let-down this time.",0.9763,0.851,0.109,0.04,0.4942528735632183

2016-04-27,1.0,"Never been so disrespected by a restaurant in my life.  I came here for a birthday dinner with my girlfriend and her stomach got upset after having a couple appetizers and drinks. When our entrees came out, we asked for them to be wrapped so we could take them home and eat them when she felt better. A very simply request.  The Pump Room has a system of wrapping left over food where it is taken to the back, wrapped, and your food is picked up at the front desk on your way out. Assuming nothing was wrong, we picked up our two bags on our way out, and didn't think anything of it. Upon opening these bags the next morning, we realized that they had only wrapped the leftovers of our appetizers and completely forgot to give us our entrees.  In my eyes, this should have been an easy problem to correct. Because of their mistake, I essentially paid $80 for food to be thrown out. Those entrees should have been removed from my bill. Instead, I was emailed back saying I would be given a small discount on my next visit. I replied telling them that while I appreciated the offer, this does not appropriately correct the problem. They didn't even bother responding. I paid them to throw away my food and to compensate them for their mistake. Absolutely ridiculous.  I have previously referred clients of mine, as well as friends and family to this restaurant, because their food is great and the restaurant itself has a great atmosphere. After seeing the level of respect that this establishment shows to it's customers, it is safe to say I will never refer anyone here again.

I was really impressed with the carrot salad.  Now, on to the beverages.  The lemon thyme vodka was awesome as was the pear fizz.   The service on the other hand was lacking.  There was a lack of client engagement and urgency.  I assume that played a part in why the Chicago food department shut it down a few months back...yes, that happened.  Unfortunately I read the article after we had our dinning experience.",0.9738,0.734,0.205,0.061,0.5898692810457516

The lights hanging from the ceiling make the room feel cozy and warm even though it is really loud and packed inside.  First off, the waiter recommended the ginger margarita, but we thought it was okay. Tasted like lemonade to me.  Then for the appetizers, we had tuna tartare and crab crostini. We loved the crostini more than the tartare. But both were made perfectly. I definitely recommend the crostini more if you like crab. We wanted some more!  For the mains, we had the organic fried chicken and soy glazed short rib. The fried chicken was cooked perfectly. Perfect crunch on the outside and tender inside. But the sauce that came with it was decent. Note that it has a little bit of heat. The server asked if we wanted extra sauce for that, which was a plus though! The short rib was also cooked perfectly. Very tender inside and yummy glaze. We liked the short rib better. The potato puree that came with the short rib wasn't pureed enough, so it was a little tough. Also, the crunchy garnishes went well with the short rib. For dessert, we had creme fraiche cheesecake which was DELICIOUS. Beautiful presentation, but too much sour cherries, which made the dessert overall sour. The cherry sorbet that came with it was also pretty sour. The cranberry pavlova had a lot of cranberries with cranberry/lime sorbet, which also were very sour.

They have a great ambiance if you're looking to unwind with friends after work or with a special someone for a date night. I also like the location of the restaurant as it is pretty close to downtown and hence is esily accessible via cta and located centrally enough to attract a diverse crowd.  The décor is stunning inside. It is very chic - especially the bar area. Although the seating area is really pretty and classy, the bar area does take the cake for its upscale yet rustic look. The hostess and the servers are also very professional and friendly. In fact I was having an issue with my Opentable reservation and the manager personally came up to me and tried resolving the issue - something he really didn't have to. He just went above and beyond to ensure I was having a pleasant time. I'm yet to try their food but have had several drinks there. Below are my top choices:- Passion Chill - this has rye, chili, lime, ginger, and passion fruit. So delicious! La petite mort - It is strong with a bold finish. Very good to taste. Judge's Chamber - Another strong drink. This has a nutty taste and is quite stunning. Dance of the sugar plum fairy - Perfect fruity drink. With sherry and plm n bay leaves. Unique and delicious.

Our server Clayton took our drink orders and I ordered a martini with only Tito's Vodka and White Chocolate Godiva. He came back at a reasonable time and served all the drinks except mine.  He said the bartender was still making mine.  20 MINUTES LATER he gave me a chocolate milk looking martini and after taking a sip and it tasted like Frangelico, creme de cocoa, chocolate syrup, and vodka. The food was average and my linguini with pesto and brussell sprouts was extremely salty. Next Clayton forgot to give us our desserts but gave us our check. We paid it and I notified him that we never recieved our desserts but it was ok because we are already done. He came back 2 minutes later with our desserts and a revised check and told me he forgot to charge me for MY dessert. At this point, I just wanted to leave so I paid my portion of the tab and the 20% gratuity. The ladies and I went upstairs to grab our coats but no hosts were around to assist us with our coats or ask if we needed any help, so we grabbed our own. We looked around for the rest of our party and found the gentlemen still sitting at the table......turns out Clayton overcharged us by $45. They notified Clayton and he corrected the check.

My date and I ordered drinks and told the waitress we'd pass on food after she inquired while we were sipping our drinks.  She said ok, immediately breaking eye contact and looking to the ground.  Thirty seconds later a manager came (or more likely, jogged) over, telling us that the seating area is for people having dinner only and that they cannot have people only having drinks in that space.  She told us about the bar and then said with a condescending attitude that we could stay this one time only, framing it as though it were pure benevolence, like she was Mark Zuckerberg donating 99% of her wealth to charity. For reference, this was on a Wednesday evening with multiple empty tables in each direction.  I would completely understand the urgency on a busy night and would feel extremely badly for making such a mistake.  After finishing 2 drinks, I left feeling embarrassed for the Pump Room for making the experience as awkward as possible.  A more tactful approach would be to say after the check, by the way, on busier nights, the dining area is for dinner only, but we have a great bar right there...",0.9034,0.777,0.127,0.097,0.6104269293924467

We had a chocolate peanut butter dessert and a berry cheesecake. Both did not disappoint! Food and drinks were awesome. Service was sub-par and disappointing. If the service would have been halfway decent, I would have given the Pump Room 4 or 5 stars.  Our waiter totally brought the vibe of the whole evening down.  He didn't smile once or offer congratulations.  He actually seemed annoyed by us the entire time we were there.  My friend, who had just gotten engaged that night, actually pulled him aside to ask him if he was okay.  He gave her some kind of snooty answer.  Also, when the bill came (that was over $500), 20% gratuity was added automatically.  I'm completely fine with this- as I know gratuity is often automatically added with large parties.  What bothered me most about this is that they didn't mention that gratuity was already included when the check was dropped off.  I later searched on their website to see if I could find the policy on larger parties... I didn't find anything.  Also- when I called ahead, the hostess on the phone said they would send over a complimentary dessert (for the engaged couple).  This didn't happen either.   All in all- it was still a memorable evening and my best friend was happy.  It just could have been way better had we had a better server.",0.9966,0.755,0.217,0.028,0.5231179138321996

However, for the price and the service, it leaves much too be desired. Specifically, the position sizes of both the calamari and tuna tartare  are minuscule. The attempt at Caesar salad was pedantry. The main courses our group had were the saving grace for the meal in terms of flavor appeal: specifically the cod and the salmon. The fried chicken is tastefully done also. However, again, the portion size is small and meant for perhaps a small woman on a calorically restricted diet!

The best short ribs I have had are tender and fall apart easily at the touch of your fork. The short rib was also TINY. For $35, it was not worth it at all. The piece of meat was tiny and the plate only had a 'dusting' of mashed potatoes rather than a full side like most other restaurants I have been to (fyi - the best short rib I have had is at Pinstripes and only $25).

The server who brought the salads looked very confused when we asked about our appetizers. Our main server later explained pleasantly that the kitchen had some confusion. One person ordered the salmon well done and mine was supposed to be medium. When a server brought both pieces, she had no idea which was which. Another server came over to straighten things out.  We received a cheerful goodbye and ""Hope to see you again."" I think these are earnest and pleasant young servers who could benefit from better training. The kitchen could be better organized and more responsive.",0.9968,0.659,0.29,0.051,0.6689333333333335

There is a great $65 tasting menu if you are willing to eat seafood as part of your courses. A really swell deal.

I have been many times and the food has always been on point! If you are a large group I would avoid this place, keep it small and simple for them. I am really not really sure why the sever had it out for a group of wonderful ladies, I have my theories but non proven for sure since I am it a mind reader but here goes... We weren't drunk or obnoxious or even loud. We worked all week and were tired to be honest. Perhaps it was because it was 8 of us instead of 10, kids get sick, moms stay home. Or that they wouldn't seat us until  the WHOLE party was there and the doctor in the group got held up by a patient. We all have that tardy friend, but that was a noble delay. So we didn't order a lot of drinks at dinner because we ordered a few while we were forced to wait for 30 mins which we really didn't mind the wait but seems like said server cared...a lot.  He told us the specials, when he came back we ordered some apps to share and he said super condescending 'so the sushi doesn't interest you'. 'Nope' it doesn't sir, don't bully us or make us feel bad.Then my highly gluten intolerant friend asks him in private what they can do and he asks he if she will have to go to the hospital if she has gluten! Really, no but she will get a migraine and her hair starts to fall out and I like this one, so would prefer that wouldn't happen to her,don't worry I didn't say that but my jaw dropped! Another friend asked for roasted potatoes instead of whipped and a different veg, he told that would mess with the texture but ok and then proceeded to do none of that when it arrived. He went MIA between dinner and dessert, out of drinks and out of patience, when he arrived back we just asked for the check or a birthday dessert if they do that and 'it was already on the way!' we felt like Dad just yelled at us. It arrives a few minutes later he lights it at the end of the our table and then brings it to the table next to us for their bday, classy. Of course gratuity was included because of our party size and he knew that all along. Really I would have loved to know what we did, I am the first to admit my downfalls but we were an easy, efficient group. I just think he had a long day and probably had some other stuff that had nothing to do with us and we were easy targets with gratuity already included.

So, Friday, 27th February, between 6pm and 8pm, I met with some friends in the lounge of the Pump Room. I decided to start off with a double espresso while my friends opted to start with alcoholic drinks. While it took no time for my friends drinks' to arrive, my espresso took a shocking 15 minutes to be delivered! During my wait, I had to wave down the server for a glass of water so that I could at least make a toast with my friends. Upon alerting her and after the toast was done, she very rudely and rushingly barked at me that my espresso was coming up. At this time I didn't even have the opportunity to ask for water. It took a total of 3 waves and chasing her down before I even had ANY drink in my hand!  Finally when I was able to speak with her, I let her know that I wanted a glass of water and that I still did not have my espresso. Without any apologies, as if I was bothering her she snapped, ""You want a glass of water? I will bring you water!"" Even though I was bothered and annoyed by the server treating me of annoyance, I had no intentions to complain about the horrible service I'd experience that night. It wasn't until my friend had the same problem with his drink. His drink took roughly 15 mins. to come to the table and the reasoning behind that was because ""the bar"" lost the ticket. Another server came to help us and was really nice and was very apologetic! :) While leaving, I decided to talk to a shift manager and was told there was none, however I settled to speak with someone who seemed to be the bar supervisor. He was polite, apologetic and understanding. He ended up bringing the server over to speak with us and still she was unmoved, unapologetic and even defensive! She'd stated that she explained to us that it take 20 min, to receive an espresso, but we never got this memo! Had I known I would have to wait so long I would have ordered a different drink hell my intentions were to order more drinks but because they took so long, I scratched that idea.

As the case with many places laid out this way with rows of two top tables, there just a bit too close for my liking, one less table would be nice. The staff is very welcoming, from the host(ess), server and busboys. Our server was informative as well as engaging. Service was efficient, but not pushy and well timed, I didn't feel rushed at all. I could have stopped at the salad, a delicious endive, pear, walnut with bits of blue cheese, the salad and bread had me just about full. However, I had already ordered an entree, I had the beef tenderloin, and this is the one hiccup in the meal, the server failed to ask me how I wanted it, and I failed to catch it and speak up. The result was a steak served medium with just a little pink, way overcooked for my usual taste. Next time I need to be more careful to speak up if not asked. Dessert was an excellent Greek yogurt cheesecake, of course I made room for dessert ;) Parking is convenient, there is valet, however you can bring it to the garage yourself which the street just to the north of the restaurant.

The bar area has couches and small tables and chairs that are low to the floor. The dining room has beautiful large ball lights that illuminate the entire room. Very classy and 'young'. Anyway, we came around 5:30pm and started off with some cocktails, which were all fantastic. They have an awesome extensive cocktail menu She hooked us up with salmon app, 4 pieces of raw salmon with crispy sushi rice and aioli, delicious. She also recommended we order the crostini with kabuchi and ricotta, which awesome. 4 pieces of toast with kabuchi (similar to squash) and fresh ricotta. The bar area stayed crowded but never too crowded, which was nice. We decided to move to the dining area after about two hours in the bar area. The dining area wasn't too crowded either. The hostess was super sweet and sat us right away. We started with the pretzel calamari which I thought was okay, but could have been a bit better...tasted like regular fried calamari (I wanted a pretzel taste!), but I like to mustard dipping sauce and the calamari was good. Then we had the kale salad which was very light and refreshing. For dinner we split the salmon which came with bok choy and delicious mashed potatoes in a chili ginger vinaigrette. She said the chef recommended the dish medium rare, but I completely disagree...it's so much better medium well when the salmon is crispy. They had some decent wines by the glass, so we grabbed two glasses of wine, but an elderly gentleman behind us asked our waitress if he could buy us some Merlot, so we ended up drinking a bunch of the Merlot he never finished for the rest of the meal. I don't even like Merlot and I loved this Merlot. I ended the meal with a tasty desert: brownie sundae I believe (I tried to Google it to confirm, but couldn't find the exact name of the desert).  They had a pre fix menu for $65 which looked awesome. If we hadn't eaten so much at the bar, I might have considered it. The price was certainly reasonable for the amount of food they were willing to give.  Waitress was very attentive and friendly, she also knew the menu really well.

2015-02-20,2.0,"I was at the Pump Room on Valentines Night, I know, Bad Idea. However a friend had made reservations for eight people and I thought it would be a nice break from university auditions to have a nice dinner.  When we arrived the atmosphere was overwhelming, in a good way. The Decor of the restaurant was fantastic. They seemed to struggle with getting all of our coats checked, but the staff was very accommodating. We sat down and read the menu. Being College students we were immediately struck by the prices. We all appreciated the quality of the restaurant though and were excited about the whole wheat flat-bread options. Our waitress was fantastic throughout several members of our group leaving for the bathroom, and being indecisive about ordering. Once we ordered our food came to us very quickly. We were all shocked by the portion sizes. They didn't make any sense. The person next to me ordered a half size pasta for $18, which consists of six medium size ravioli in sauce. My prosciutto three cheese flat bread was 20 dollars and enormous. I don't understand why the sizes were so different and the prices so similar.  We were all very tired after an unfortunate experience on the subway, so we didn't complain about it. Then it came time to process our bill. This restaurant is apparently incapable of processing separate checks. However they are perfectly fine with taking multiple forms of payment. When we got our bill we divided up our food and added in the gratuity and tax. We even put our cards in the order of the chart on the back of the receipt. We wanted to make this as simple and easy as possible for the gentleman who took over for our waitress. When he took our cards he made ""joking"" comment about how we were difficult. I wasn't over concerned though, because I wanted to get out of there and go to bed. When he came back our checks were all out of whack. all of us but one paid the correct amount. I was willing to ignore it but others in my party weren't. So we did our math again and it all came out the same. We couldn't figure out how she was paying half the correct amount for her food. The waiter brought over his manager and he tried to help us get it figured out. Unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing either, so he took our receipt and we told him each item we ordered. He left and processed everything again. Unfortunately our receipts got switched and two of us paid for each others checks. At this point I was done and said that I would make it right with her later. Unfortunately the story doesn't end here. When I was looking at my banking app the next day I noticed two charges on my account. I called the restaurant and left a message. About four hours later I called again and talked to a very rude individual who was completely unwilling to help me. She said that it takes two to three business days for a charge to leave an account. I accepted this and drove home to Ohio. Three days later the charge was still there. It has now been four business days and the charge has not disappeared. I am about to call my bank and file a dispute of charges. $26 dollars is a lot of money to me, it may be inconsequential to them but I work very hard for my money. Overall I felt very disrespected and disappointed. I cannot comprehend why a restaurant of this caliber would not have a better way to pay a bill. The most disappointing aspect is that I would have received better service at an Applebees. The only reason I gave two stars is due to the quality of the food and the skill of our waitress.  TL:DR Don't take a group here because they don't process separate checks. If you go by yourself get the Flatbread. The Pasta portions are tiny.",-0.981,0.822,0.07,0.108,0.4997329835889157
2015-02-19,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went to lunch here during restaurant week on a Saturday. We were incredibly disappointed to find out that they weren't participating in restaurant week lunch on the weekends. However, my boyfriend simply told the waiter we were disappointed and it was unclear that they weren't participating on the weekend. The waiter spoke to the chef and manager and they quickly decided to accommodate us and everyone else in the restaurant! Our waiter was wonderful and the manager checked in on our table multiple times throughout the lunch. The service was top notch. The restaurant has a great ambiance, but I can see how it can be a bit more appealing for dinner. It doesn't feel like a hotel restaurant by any means. The food was delicious. Surprisingly, my favorite dish was the beat salad. The description really doesn't do it justice. The flavors were really unique and memorable. Overall, I had a wonderful experience here and I would definitely come back.

2015-02-13,4.0,"One of the best meals I've had in Chicago. Great atmosphere, comfortable environment, fantastic food and some of the best service in the city. The light fixtures make you feel like you're in a glass of champagne, or some sort of cracked-out planetarium, but it works. We went here with a couple of ""foodie"" friends for Restaurant Week, and had an absolutely great time! The salmon was decadent, the chicken perfectly crispy with a touch of spice and the short ribs were unbelievably good! Restaurant week is the time to check this place out. My wife and I started in the bar area, which has tiny chairs and itty-bitty tables. At first they seemed awkward, but I ended up really enjoying it there! While waiting for our friends to arrive, we got cocktails and appetizers. She got the flatbread, which really was fantastic - and I'm not a huge fan of flatbreads. I got the sashimi trio (Tuna, Salmon and Scallop) on crispy sushi rice with chipotle aioli. Oh... my... GOD! To be perfectly honest, I am an adventurous diner, but raw scallop is a wee bit out of my comfort zone, so I didn't eat it. The salmon and tuna, however, were amazing! I can't recommend them enough - easily the best thing I ate that night. Pump Room misses on a few issues, though. They need to replace the chairs in the dining room. They are a little beaten up, and are too short for the table. They offer you a ""booster cushion,"" but really should replace the chairs. Their Restaurant Week menu only offered one dessert, which consisted of the two things she hates the most: Pineapple and coconut, so she didn't get dessert. And finally, their martinis are a miss only for one reason: they don't use traditional martini glasses. They have an odd, curved lip on them, which makes it difficult to sip without getting gin all over your face. It usually takes more than my initial martini for that to happen. This place can get a little pricey, but if you want to go someplace for a special occasion, and have a few extra bucks laying around, go here. You won't be disappointed.",0.9972,0.721,0.216,0.062,0.5897644022644024
2015-02-12,2.0,"Admittedly, we came here on the last day of Restaurant Week. However, the food,  a combination of the special menu and the regular menu was only OK.  The crab crostini was OK.  The fried chicken was good.   The beef short ribs,  however, were not good.  I have had these many times at various establishments. These ranked low on the list of beef short ribs experiences. Though they generally tend to be a bit fatty,  I received an unusually extra fatty cut that was 50-60% fat.  Coupled with the lack of leanness, even by short rib standards, the sauce was anything but subtle. It was as if the overtly tangy,  citrus-y, salty,  brown sauce was designed to mask the shortcomings of the cut of beef.  Topping this were very sweet, julienned apple pieces which provided tactful additional masking and also took away from,  rather than complementing, what would normally be the intended focus  - - the beef.  I am usually a proud Clean Plate Club member, but this time I could only muster finishing half of the dish and felt unwell afterwards. The service was very good, but when the food is lacking and you are paying $100 per person for a meal and a couple of drinks,  you expect the meal to be great.  It was a three-star meal,  but is hereby donned only two stars for value.  If a goal of Restaurant Week is to build a customer base and get returnees,  I would say this establishment failed to encourage a return trip from this diner.",0.9808,0.814,0.141,0.045,0.5534414510220962

2015-02-06,3.0,"Let me just start with the fact that I've heard nothing but great things about Pump Room ever since I moved to the city three years ago. So, needless to say, I was truly looking forward to my experience. My two girlfriends and I thought it would be perfect to try Pump Room during restaurant week. We were sat at a table next to the front door, which I was a little disappointed about since I felt like we were seated away from much of what the Pump Room offers. I didn't let it bother me though, until I realized we were not greeted by our server for over 10 minutes.  I get it, I was a server once before, I know that if you have an overbooked section, things can get hectic. So, again, I let this slide. We finally ordered our drinks (Moscow Mule for me, mm!) but then didn't receive them for another 10-15 minutes. When I asked our waiter what he recommended off the restaurant menu, he just went through every single thing on the menu and said everything was ""amazing."" I have no doubts, but I was looking for a recommendation from him. My one friend decided to get the crab crostini and my other friend and I got the flatbread - or shall we call it pizza? Either way, it was delicious. We then ordered the salmon and linguine for our main course. Everything we ordered was well made and the perfect temperature. I was just disappointed in how long it took to get our food in between courses - about 20-25 minutes. Even the dessert took what seemed forever to receive. Our reservation was at 7:15 and we didn't end up leaving until close to 9:45 - and not because we sat around talking after we got the bill. We had to put our credit cards out even before we received the bill to show that we were looking to leave. Again, I thought maybe it was because our server had a lot of tables but we were always looking around for him and never saw him attending to other tables. You would think during Restaurant Week, a restaurant would have most of their food ready to go (especially the dessert since there was only one choice). It just seemed like Pump Room took a little too much time out of our night, hence why I'm only giving it 3 stars. I'll undoubtedly be back, likely just for drinks. Even though I have no complains on the meal itself, the service alone is reason enough for me to never order there again.",0.9773,0.826,0.11,0.064,0.5981292517006802

2015-02-04,3.0,"When we walked into the Pump Room we knew that we were dining with legends. Guests are immediately confronted with walls of framed photographs of celebrities - especially the glamorous ones from about fifty years ago. How could my skinny jeans, tall boots, and nice top possibly be appropriate to dine with the spirit of Elizabeth Taylor dressed in a gown? The Pump Room has been renovated since that grand epoch and has remained en vogue; however, the clientele is still wealthy, well-educated, and well-connected. We opted for their Restaurant Week menu and I would have been foolish to pass on the $10 wine pairing! The two pours were small but definitely worth the laughable price-tag. M opted to start with a sashimi trio but was offered a crab crostini as an alternative - an option with which she readily agreed. She enjoyed the crostini to such an extent that she only grudgingly allowed me a bite after multiple requests! Although the bread was toasted it wasn't hard. On top was a rich concoction that included fresh crab meat. It was light and refreshing with a suggestion of buttery richness. I chose the beet and yogurt salad. It was definitely my favorite between the two starters. What I liked most about it was that the earthiness of the beets was preserved and then contrasted with the clean creaminess of bed of yogurt. It was such a good pairing that it seems surprising that I haven't thought of it before! Next, we got the fried chicken and the spare rib. Originally I ordered the chicken and M the rib and then we discovered that we preferred one another's entrees. This is just an example of how personal preferences can be misguided and I'm thankful that we were able to switch. The fried chicken was half of the bird, de-boned, battered, and fried. The meat was succulent with a flaky, crispy exterior. It was served on a bed of collard greens. There was a flavor element (lemon grass, possibly??) that disagreed with me. I couldn't quite identify the taste. Anyway, M loved it. The spare rib was truly amazing. It was served as a cube of meat, no bone, with some sort of fresh slaw on top. I've never seen spare rib (or any kind of rib) served in that fashion and I was impressed. It was tender, lean, and pulled apart easily with a touch of my fork or knife. The flavor was salty and rich - a little too salty for my preference. I was thankful for the thinly sliced vegetable on top to provide a fresh, crisp contrast to the meat. For dessert we each had the pineapple upside down cake. It was served with a small scoop of ice-cream and shaved pineapple. It was a spectacular dessert. I can think of no possible improvement. It was balanced in every way: fresh, sweet (but not overly so), moist, and creamy. Our server was Nick who was absolutely wonderful! He had an easy and cheerful disposition. He answered questions, took our orders, served us, and checked on us in a timely manner without being obsequious. His service seemed genuinely good-natured. Alex was his silent yet still pleasing serving partner. The two of them made a fabulous team and I would surely ask for their section again if I return to the Pump Room. There were a few annoyances in the evening that kept us from having a perfect dining experience. For one thing, our table wobbled. It wobbled to the point of distraction and often sloshed our beverages nearly over their brims. Next, our table was unnecessarily close to others. At first we didn't notice because no other guests were seated by us; however, soon a chatty group of august persons gathered behind me loudly calling one of them ""ambassador."" Then a pair of young women were seated immediately next to us and the two of them talked loudly about their jobs. It was very difficult to hold a conversation of our own as we felt as if speaking up would interrupt our neighbors as much as they'd interrupted us! In all, I think that the Pump Room would be an impressive place to bring out-of-town guests or possibly to celebrate a special occasion. Although I can envision being chummy with Nick, the Pump Room wasn't approachable enough for a midweek dinner on the fly. However, it is in the neighborhood so I could toy with the idea of heading over after work for a drink.",0.9993,0.762,0.201,0.036,0.6563157391470643

Normally this would not bother me, especially since our main reason for attendance was the drinks. However, the hostess came up to my group and rudely interrupted a conversation we were having and almost demanded she show us our table. Mind you, we had not closed out our bar tab. We then made our way to a table, which they cramped a fifth chair at on the end. The service was eh. Our waitress was present but not when we needed her. Every time we ordered a cocktail it seemed to take longer and longer to receive. We decided to just split a few appetizers and I am glad I did not commit to an entrée as the food was not good. Our flat bread was highly over seasoned and almost inedible. The burrata was decent, but then again how can you mess up a cheese...? The ambiance was intimate and romantic and I am very glad I was able to finally check out this spot. I will be coming back but only for the drinks since they were amazing! I ordered an apple brandy cocktail as well as a margarita. Both tasted very fresh and could still taste the alcohol, which is my kind of cocktail.

Appetizers (crostini, a kale salad, a flatbread) were better than the bland fried chicken or the steak, and the cocktails were literally disastrous (as in, multiple diners sent their cocktails back, and at least one of my cocktails was flat-out the wrong drink).  I'm really not sure what to make of the service--our server was a great guy, funny, but it took a while to get drinks at any point throughout the four-hour stint I was in our private room and it's clear that the person making drinks for our party had never made cocktails before.  We sent back so many old-fashioned, a few of us wondered why they even bothered to offer this on their drink menu.

2014-11-26,4.0,"Tasting Menu Review Course One: The ""Man, Things are Starting Off Well"" Course Food: Salmon, Crispy Sushi Rice, Chipotle Aioli Wine Pairing: Ruinart Brut Rose, Champagne (France) I loved this course because the sticky rice was exactly the texture I want for an appetizer and the salmon just lightened it up. Some bites of the sushi were saltier than others- and those were the best. As for the wine, sparkling wine is such a good general pairing for food. It is also an easy pairing for a sommelier to make. It should appear more on wine lists and in wine pairing supplements to tasting menus. This Ruinart was dry with high acid while being very pink and sincerely lovely. I imagine it is what Deborah Kerr is asking for when she orders pink champagne in An Affair to Remember. Great beginning to the meal. Course Two: The ""I Wish I Had More Of This"" Course Food: Roasted Butternut Squash Soup with Ginger and Basil Wine Pairing: Chapoutier 'La Ciboise' Blanc 2012 (France) The soup was amazing. Super-rich-coating-your-mouth kind of good. The basil was a perfect add and there was something crunchy in the soup, as well, that added nice texture. Simply, this was the perfect fall meal. The wine was mainly a Grenache Blanc blend (Southern Rhone). Kind of uneventful wine, but it didn't take away from the soup because of the acid in it which cleansed my palate and prepared me for the next spoonful of soup. The wine is spicy and peppery at the end, so could also be a good sipping wine, too. Course Three: The ""Um, Well, Maybe I Didn't Need This One"" Course Food: Fresh Tagliatelle, Lemon Meyer Cream, Parmesan, Fresh Pepper Wine Pairing: Maison L'envoye, Chardonnay 2011, Bourgogne (France) You smell the lemon first in this dish. Then, you see it looks straight gorgeous. As for the taste, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the Parmesan provided the salt needed here while the pepper did it's job. Unfortunately, the Chardonnay was really strong and wrong for this dish. It is hard to define it at first and I just kept wondering what you would pair with that Lemon Meyer cream because this wine wasn't it. Eventually, I realized that what it did to the Chardonnay was make it more bitter. Seriously bitter. I might have gone the Sauvignon Blanc route to get some herbal notes. Straightforwardly, this was just a bad round. Both components separate could have been lovely, but didn't have a chance together. This is the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston of dishes. Course Four: The ""Oh Crap, I Forgot to Take a Picture of the Food"" Course Food: Roasted Walleye, Crispy Potatoes, Sautéed Herbs, Red Wine Chili-Lime Sauce. Wine Pairing: Licia, Albariño, 2012, Rias Baixas (Spain) Well, there is always a point in a meal with this many components where things start to blur. The spinning dishes and the replaced glasses distract you as the diner from your MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY that is to take a picture of the food. I messed up here. I'll tell you, though, this was good. The chili sauce and the herbs are great. They crush it, really. The Albariño was also a really nice pairing. Light and crisp with some nice mineral flavors, it should stay married to this dish and they should be listed together on the permanent menu. Course Five: The ""Oh God, What Did I Get Myself Into"" Course Food: Soy Glazed Beef Short Ribs, Apple-Jalapeño Puree, Rosemary Crumbs Wine pairings: Boedga Catena Zapata, Malbec, 2012 Vista Flores (Argentina) ...And then the train leaves the station. As anyone who has done a tasting menu or just unpretentiously over-ordered knows, there is a point in the meal that is like standing at the edge of the cliff. This is where you need the restaurant to carry you over the gap and gently place you on the other side of dessert. The Pump Room did this by making this dish crazy, crazy good. The short ribs fell apart, which is exactly what short ribs should do. The apple purée with it was light and tart perfection. The Malbec felt like it had high alcohol (which it would), but the tannin was completely managed. With its deep dark cherry flavor it was spot on for this dish. This was a great course. A great, great course. Course Six: The ""I am So Glad This is Over Because I am Burping at the Table"" Course Food: Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae, Candied Peanuts, Popcorn, Whipped Cream, Chocolate Sauce Wine course: Dow's Late Bottle Vintage Port 2008 (Portugal) In general, your wine course during dessert should be sweeter than your dessert. This was a VERY sweet desert, but it was also salty. The port stood up to it in flavors and cut through the sweetness a little. This is also the first port I have ever had served in a champagne glass, which made it more interesting somehow. Overall, this was a great dinner. Did my silverware and new plates show up on time always between courses? No. Did a couple of support staff try to take clean wine glasses away? Yep. But, I felt like they were well-intentioned through-out and that goes a long way with me",0.9991,0.772,0.178,0.05,0.5706705251270467

My fiancee and I ate at the Pump Room in the Gold Coast 3 weeks ago to celebrate our engagement which had just begun an hour before we dined here. I visited this place once before, a long time ago, when it was a part of the Ambassador East Hotel.  It was very old school, and I can't remember much about it except that it had a reputation for celebrities frequenting it back in the day (50's through 80's?).  Now that the hotel has become Public, the Pump Room has been completed remodeled.  It's very modern and chic, and looks like an appropriate place if you're trying to impress your date.  For drinks, my fiancee ordered a $23 glass of wine which was probably the best glass of red wine I had ever tasted (for that price, it better have been).  I would give you the name of it, but I intentionally didn't want to learn it after having discovered the price.  I ordered a moscow mule, and it was good.  Not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it.  We ordered tuna tartare and salmon sashimi dishes for our appetizers.  I highly recommend both.  The tuna was very light and the salmon sashimi was like butter... both were ideal representations of what to expect from tuna tartare and salmon sashimi.  For our main entrees, my fiancee ordered the salmon dish.  It was perfectly cooked.  In fact, it was the best cooked salmon I had ever tasted.  I ordered the beef short rib, which was excellent.  I would not hesitate to order either again, as they were both delicious.  However, the salmon was the winner if I had to choose between the two.  We didn't order dessert, because we were full after our entrees.  There was no issues with the staff... everyone was nice.  I mentioned we were celebrating our engagement to our waiter and he didn't do anything special for us.  It would've been nice to get a small congratulatory dessert.  I still tipped 20%, but I went the pre-tax route rather than including tax.  I had purchased a Gilt City voucher for the Pump Room.  I think it was something like $50 for $90.  I'm glad I did because this place is pretty expensive.  Although, if you're going to drop $$$ you want to make sure that the food is delicious.  This place delivered.  I recommend this place for special occasions or if you don't mind spending $150+ (2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees) between two people.",0.999,0.722,0.248,0.03,0.578874883286648

Also, he seemed to know a decent amount about the history of the restaurant and neighboring hotel.

The absolute kicker in this that made it really stand out above any others were the added chilis. They weren't overly spicy or anything but the flavor was intense and worked so well.  The mimosas were ok, really nothing special. The bloody mary was a bit spicy which was actually pretty decent. I am almost positive they add olive juice which took a few sips to get used to but was ok. All together the bloody was decent but not really the way i normally like mine.  We also tried a homemade cinnamon bun and it was fantastic. It tasted like they added an orange zest in the creme.  All in all, the food here was great, the service was good, the decor was nice depending on your style. The big reason this is 3 stars and not 4 is the prices. For the portions i just think they were a bit high, however i had a giltcity voucher so it really wasn't too bad. I don't know if i will be back, but it wont be because of the food.

2014-09-03,1.0,Very disappointing meal.   I had short ribs which were very fatty.  My wife can't eat spicy food - and the kale salad came with jalapeños on top.  Then the carrots on her dish had spicy sauce neither of which was listed on the menu.    The service was poor.  We ordered a second  bottle of a nice wine and the waitress just went to pour it without offering a taste to make sure it wasn't corked.   She also disappeared after food was served. For a supposedly classy restaurant this one falls far short.,0.079,0.812,0.101,0.087,0.6289898989898991

2014-08-30,4.0,"First time dining here but we had a Gilt voucher to use up.  The patrons were definitely more dressed up than other trendy restaurants in the city. The diningroom is really nice comfortable with enough space between the tables so you are not listening to each other's conversations. I love the outer space lighting they have going on.  My husband had a beer on tap, Black Butte Porter. It was delicious. It's a dark beer, similar to Guiness so if you like Guiness, you should try this one.  I didn't check out the wine menu because I already had a lot to drink last night so I went dry tonight. Food- Most of the dishes ordered were delicious.  Burrata - least favorite on the menu. It's house made but i didn't enjoy the taste. Bar Toma's burrata is much much better. Frisee peach goat cheese salad - My guess is that this will come off the menu very soon because it is no longer peach season. The peach was not fully ripe but it was still pretty good. Couldn't taste the goat cheese very much but I love goat cheese. Tomato basil flatbread - Approx 8"" and served on a mini cooling rack so the crust doesn't get too soggy, nice touch. I've had better pizza though, Nellcote, Bar Toma, just to name a few. It wasn't horrible but I would pass on this at $14. Broccoli - Very good! Who knew that steamed broccoli goes well with olive oil, pistachio, garlic chips and mint! I might have to try to make this one at home. Salmon with crispy rice and chili aioli - Yum! I've seen tuna crispy rice but never salmon. It's very good. My husband couldn't get enough of it and I agree with him. This was delicious and not very spicy. If you are looking for HOT, th is is not it. Short rib - Wow!! Short rib is a very fatty cut of meat. I don't know how it was prepared but it was not greasy, fork tender, perfectly seasoned. It was served with match stick granny apples and it was perfect with the short rib. It gave a nice refreshing crunch to the tender meat.  Olive oil - this is the olive oil that's served with the bread. It is so good! I wish they would bottle it and sell it.  Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu.

The first time was for brunch, and had an amazing food experience since everything was delicious, however the service was lacking. I was able to overlook the spotty service at brunch because everything we ordered on the menu was so incredible.  The second time was for dinner, and we had amazing service and awesome food once again, so I was thinking that Pump Room had redeemed themselves and I caught a server on an off day.  However, the reason for 2 stars is because of our experience for brunch yesterday. I had purchased the Gilt City coupon which included 2 drinks per person and 2 brunch entrees. When I called to make a 10:30am reservation, no one ever mentioned that they do not serve bar items until 11am. When we arrived at our table at 10:20am since we were early, it took a solid 10-12min for a server to greet us and get us water. After finally getting some water, our server told us about having to wait until 11am for drinks.  We got the french toast and the eggwhite omlette with spinach, goat cheese, and peppers. The french toast was delicious, however the omelette was extremely tiny and only had one grape tomato on the side as a ""side"". It was $15 and I can not imagine in any possible way how they could charge that for such a TINY and flavorless meal option. It would feed a 2 year old at most.  We were finished with our meal before 11am, so we had to sit and wait for our drinks to be delivered well after we had finished since our food came so quickly. The entire time the server barely noticed us and was pretty standoff-ish towards us the whole time.

I was in Chicago by myself to do a half marathon. I arrived about 10 minutes before my reservation and was sent to the bar by the hostess and whom I believe was a manager.  I ordered a drink at the bar, a raspberry basil gimlet.  It was yummy!  It had Belvedere vodka, St. Germain liqueur, lime & raspberries(and I guess there must have been some basil in there based on the name).   I paid my tab and waited to be seated.  I did not wait long.  I had maybe two sips of my cocktail before they came to seat me. I got seated at a two person table between a couple on a date and a foursome celebrating a birthday.  My waiter came over right away to drop off a menu and offered to help me understand it.  I knew what it all was and how it worked for the most part.  They filled my water glass immediately.   I sipped on my drink and ordered.  I went with the scallops and assorted peas which was basically just snow peas and garnishy looking leafy like thing, but they were so good!  It was 4 large scallops over the peas and I tried not to show my excitement as to how good it was by not gobbling it all up in 5 minutes.  After dinner I had another drink and got dessert.  I went with the cheesecake parfait and it was so delicious!  It had fruits, crumbled graham waffers, tasty jelly cubes and sorbet on top of a cheesecake bottom.  Again, I tried not to gobble it all up like a piggy, but it was hard.  I ate it so fast I again may have eaten the garnish, but it doesn't matter.  It tasted good!   I arrived there at 8:50, was seated by 9:00 and my tab was paid and I was out the door by 9:50.  Excellent service!  I also got a lovely compliment on my rockabilly style from another server there who said, ""It's nice to see the whole package put together.""  Way to butter a girl up Pump Room!  When in Chicago in the future...

2014-05-28,1.0,"Let me preface this review with the disclaimer that I eat out frequently but have never felt the need to leave a review until now --  Shockingly terrible service.  I went to Pump Room for a 9pm dinner last Friday with my friends, but when we arrived, Pump Room clearly didn't have a table to match our reservation.  We were instructed to wait in the lounge and get a drink, as the hostess mentioned our table would be ready in 15-30 minutes, but no one was available to take our drink order for 20 minutes.  We finally had to go to the bar to get our own drinks -- we asked for the sour cherry old-fashioned on their menu, but the bartender 1) had no clue what we were talking about and 2) made us ""regular"" old-fashioneds with a splash of soda water. By 9:30pm, we had already asked the hostess TWICE about our table, to no avail.  Decided to order a flatbread while we waited, but 10 minutes later, our flatbread arrived at the table next to us -- the woman sitting there brought it over to us and apologized profusely, asking if we needed silverware (best service I'd gotten all night -- from someone who didn't even work there!)  By 9:45pm, we asked to speak to a manager.  We were finally seated at 10pm, a full hour after our reservation, at a terrible table in the back corner.  I might understand waiting an hour if we had walked in, but we actually had a reservation!  Moreover, we waited much longer than the time that was originally indicated to us.  Had we known a 9pm reservation would be delayed until after 10pm, we would've left. After such a terrible first hour at Pump Room, I would've expected, at the very least, an apology from the manager.  No apology came - he didn't even give our waiter a heads-up about the fact that we'd been waiting an hour to eat dinner.  Thankfully, our waiter picked up on an offhand comment my friend made about our poor experience, and he was very attentive and even comped our drinks and an appetizer.  However, I believe this is a standalone comment about our waiter, Eric, rather than the restaurant; we tipped accordingly but we will not be coming back.

2014-05-05,3.0,Pump room always has great drinks and pretty good food as well. But if your going to get a reservation make sure you make the reservation at LEAST a half hour before you actually want to be seated. This is the second time I have visited the pump room where I made reservations and had to wait 30-45 min after my reservation time to actually sit down. Luckily they have delicious cocktails but when I make a reservation I don't expect to wait that long and feel obligated to get drinks beforehand. Also- the first time I ate here the waiter messed up our order. And when I visited this time our waiter again messed up our order. And all we got were drinks and desserts.  This all being said I wouldn't waste your time sitting down getting a meal because there are plenty of other great restauants to check out in Chicago. But  ok to go get drinks and check out the old pictures and history of the pump room.,0.9493,0.816,0.149,0.034,0.44874999999999987

Not what I would expect from such a great restaurant with incredible food. Regardless of the atmosphere and food being good they really need to interview and keep tabs on their rude and insensitive employees.

The second time was for my best friend's birthday about two years later.  We had a reservation for a very large party in which a little more than half showed up for.  The dinner and service was excellent and although it's elegant kind of ecclectic decor makes it a bit intimidating, the food was spot on and atmosphere was very intimate.  I really was having a great time until we found out no cakes or not even cupcakes were allowed unless we were to be charged $5 / person.  So... just for opening the tray of cupcakes that a guest brought for the birthday girl, we'd be charged.  Didn't get to enjoy my cupcake there or cake for that matter since the person who reserved asked in advance.  I took mine on the go in a napkin.  (Molly's cupcakes btw!) I had the blackened sea bass entree with a side order of the broccoli w/ pistacios.  Some other guests ordered the scallops, lamb, fish, and flatbread.  The sauce was interesting for the sea bass but not bad.  I'd order it again.  I'd love to go back to try some of the other yummy offerings.   The staff is friendly and accommodating.  I didn't have drink that night but have had them before and are pretty good.  They have a great cocktail menu. I do recall dinner around 8:30-9pm, the lights suddenly dimmed, a lot.

I was really eager to order it myself but went with short ribs instead thinking to myself that it would be messy to eat and who cones to a place like this and eats died chicken. Boy was I wrong.

The food is truly outstanding.  We shared the following dishes: Broccoli rabe and pepperoni flatbread:  We were warned this was chock full of garlic, and it was.  Personally, I love garlic, and found this flatbread to be well seasoned, cooked to perfection, and well balanced. Roasted carrot and sprout salad:  One of the most unique and delicious salads we have had.  The carrot is roasted with a dusting of chili powder, and served warm with fresh avocado and sprouts, all topped with sour cream.  The sour cream offsets the heat of the carrot perfectly, while the sprouts give the texture needed for the dish.  We were given four beautiful carrots that were perfectly roasted.  An A+ dish! Fresh bowtie pasta with jalapeno marinara and smoked bacon:  A great dish.  Perfect amount of pasta.  Bowtie pasta was wonderfully al dente and lightly coated in a refreshingly sweet and spicy sauce.  The bacon was perfectly cooked as well.  A simple dish with perfect balance of salt, sweet, spice, and texture. Beef shortribs:  The sauce is the star of this dish.  A perfectly slow-cooked shortrib with wonderful caramelized coating.  The meat falls off, and the dish comes with a sweet and sour soy-based sauce.   Mashed potatoes:  Lots of butter, lots of cream, lots of potatoes.  Perfect. Doughnuts and coffee:  Fresh made doughnuts served with espresso chocolate and whipped cream.   A perfect night cap.  We asked for a spoon to drink the chocolate sauce (classy).   The experience as a whole is what set this place apart.  They were very welcoming and hospitable.

Ever since landing in Chicago 20+ years ago, this place has been on my list but finally got around to it for a quick lunch. Luckily I'd walked from near Trump tower up a mile or so before sitting down to this small pizza that deserves its own velvet roping.  The salad on top is pale and looks like it'd also gone through the roughly 8 months of Chicago winter, but damn it was crisp, refreshing and twangy. Mated well with the gooey topping and super crisp crust. This one's a winner.  And it was apparently in love with the red zinfandel poured... some of the best I've had. The Ken and Barbie cuties at the door almost broke character when I walked in looking like one of Bob Marley's children, but I do reckon that their smiles were genuine. I hobbled over to the bar, which felt a bit more casual, then sat down in the velvet love seat off to the side with its proprietary floor lamp beaming over the small round table. Bistro?

Well let me tell you; this experience was by far one of the worst experiences (service wise) I've had in Chicago. We had to wait ten minutes for our waiter to come back to our table after he introduced himself to place our drink & food order. After placing our orders we had to wait another 13 minutes for our drinks to arrive (which was just a bottle of Prosecco Served with the mixers and a margarita). It shouldn't have taken this long for us to get our drinks. Its not like the 5 of us each ordered some insanely difficult to make cocktail that required the bartender to drive to Hyde Park to get the ingredients. I mean the place was half empty so what was the hold up? Thankfully, our food was good. However, it took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive and the 2 of us who ordered the French Toast didn't get any syrup and had to ask for it.  Again the place was half empty so we couldn't understand why things were moving slower than a 10K race with 90 and old participants (no disrespect to the elderly population).  The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the peanut butter and jelly doughnut that was topped with candied peanut & sea salt. This is doughnut was truly amazing. The service at the Pump Room (from my experience) is horrible.

The difference in price between the entree and the ""simply prepared"" tenderloin is enough for me to recommend against ordering the entree. The burger looked pretty good.  All in all, I'd recommend this for a group of single folks. Lots of beautiful people in a very sceneny atmosphere off the beaten path.",0.9872,0.72,0.223,0.057,0.5734989648033126
2014-03-08,3.0,"I have been dying to go here for quite some time...it's a great place for cocktails but a terrible place to eat! I came with 3 friends so we decided to order a few things to split. Pretzel Dusted Calamari: good but didn't taste the pretzel covering at all, similar to calamari you'd get at any nice place. Spinach Flatbread: burnt crust so the charred flavor was all I tasted. Ravioli: very disappointing, the large $23 order was five medium sized ravioli that oozed out when you cut/bit them. So food is not worth the price!! Go elsewhere to eat.  Cocktails are $12 each, pretty standard. They were tasty! Ginger margarita was delicious! Raspberry Bellini also good. Skip the elderflower unless you love pulpy orange juice. I think the cucumber martini was the best and most flavorful! Atmosphere is fancy, but I think most patrons were above the age of 40. It was on my list of places to go, I'm glad I went, but I prob won't go back.",0.9895,0.726,0.22,0.054,0.5444285714285714
2014-03-05,5.0,"I came across Pump Room based on some recommendations from friends to make my Chicago trip even more memorable. This definitely did not fail. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, it was an awesome experience! FOOD/DRINKS - 5 Stars: We ordered so many amazing items: - Raspberry Lychee Bellini: I'm not big on bellini's, but since there was lychee, I was all over it. This was really tasty. - Basil Jalapeno Margarita: This really had a kick from the mild start with the basil to the spice from the jalapeno contrasted followed by the coolness of the margarita. It really had your mouth jumping. - Sour Cherry and Yuzu Soda: I drank this during my meal and how could I not have this? Cherry and yuzu are two of my favorite flavors and they're married together in a soda?!?! Awesome! - Bread with Olive Oil: They provided complimentary bread with olive oil for dipping. This was a nice start to our meal. - Tuna Tartare: Now this was not what I expected and I mean that in a good way. Throw whatever you normally think of tuna tartare out the window and try it here. It's so delicious especially with the ginger dressing and the crunch from the spicy radishes. You can't go wrong with this. I wanted to order a second one, but I had to control myself! - Seared Scallops: This was really good. The scallops were perfectly cooked and had roasted pumpkin seeds and squash spaghetti, which was a surprising treat. - Grilled Beef Short Rib: This was amazing! It was so tender and it just fell apart. The Asian pears and red wine glaze gave it an extra pop of flavor. The creamy mashed potatoes definitely appeased my craving for potatoes! Overall, this dish was mouth-watering and delicious! - Peach Cobber: I love peach cobbler so when I see it on a menu, I'm quick to order it. This was just so freaking good! The bourbon ice cream definitely brought this to a new level. - Deep Dish Molten Chocolate Cookie: Now who goes and makes what's practically a chocolate chip cookie cupcake? Pump Room does! Yes, it's all that delicious cookiness with a center that oozes molten chocolate. Mix it with a bite of ice cream and you'll be in heaven! This is a must try no matter how full you are! SERVICE - 5 Stars: The service was truly impeccable. The moment we walked in, everyone was extremely friendly. Our waiter was amazing. He helped to give plenty of recommendations, answered our questions, was animated, very funny and of course extremely personable. ATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: The atmosphere in here is very classy, elegant, and relaxed. It felt very throwback modern, yet chic with the decor of the restaurant. I can see why this place is very popular with people. The vibe is very social and I loved the overall atmosphere. It was relaxed, people chatting, laughing, etc. Also, the bar area is pretty cool and laid back. I actually wish I arrived earlier to enjoy a cocktail or two before dinner. RECOMMENDATION: I truly loved everything that we ordered at the table and I'm so glad that I saved room for dessert. I can't wait to come back to Chicago because Pump Room will be on my list of places to eat at again. Everything from the food, service, and atmosphere was amazing and I hope they keep it up! So, if you haven't figured it out already, make your reservation and enjoy all the deliciousness Pump Room has to offer!",0.9997,0.696,0.294,0.011,0.5524481112494809

We arrived about an hour before our reservations at 10pm (thanks to the showing of ""Cuff Me"" at the apartment theater.)  This place is without a  doubt a super sexy establishment that begs to be enjoyed with good company.  Our party of 6 sat at the bar, sipped cocktails, played with the bartender, enjoyed each others and the other bar patrons  while we waited on a table.  I was a little disappointment at the level of consistency in the craft cocktails. While some were delish; as in the cucumber martini, others left something to be desired as far as the sour cherry whiskey. We literally tried every cocktail on the menu and our favorites were the cucumber martini and the Moscow Mule made with bourbon. The least favorites were the Passion Chili and the Basil Jalapeno Margarita. mainly because they tried to hard, those drinks, in our opinion, just wasn't good.  What we ate:   Appetizers Kale Salad with Parmesan Dressing - I wasn't a fan -- at the table my party felt like the dish ""grew"" on them -- that is doing too much to like something Pretzel Dusted Calamari - It was very tender and enjoyable - however I did not feel like it tasted any different or stand out from any other calamari dish that I have tried.  Tuna Tar tare  -- the surprise standout at the table --  Shaved Brussel Sprout Salad -- even my father who hates brussel sprouts liked the taste of this salad. Pasta Ricotta Raviolis -- this was good  Fresh Tagliatelle -- we liked this but not as much as the ravioli  Entrees Beef Short Rib - so tender that you couldn't use a knife - My cousin enjoyed it -  Lamb chops - simply prepared, but it was good; did notice it was a touch fatty, however it did not offend the eater so... They were out of the lobster so my friend settled for the simple scallops -- she said they tasted like scallops -  Roasted Beef Tenderloin - cooked to a perfect medium - it was very tasty with the miso butter and  I had the black sea bass -- It was okay - but I was more impressed with my husband's dish:  Scallops with pumpkin seeds and Spaghetti Squash After all of the tasting -- a few more drinks mixed in -- (which we had to go to the bar to get because the bar drinks were way better then the ones from the back  -- the ones from the back we sent back) --  we left the restaurant kind of hungry.  We all agreed that the food was good and fresh -- but none of us were satisfied in our dinners. Literally, a couple of hours later we were chopping on left over pizza. -- Arguing over the last slice. Meaning we paid over $100 a person to end up debating whether White Castle was going to be a night cap. Which is way I rounded down instead of up on my 3.5 rating.

2014-02-22,4.0,"So much history with this legendary spot that I am surprised how long it took for me to find out about this place as well as go here. The Pump Room is an amazing place hidden away in the Gold Coast. Hidden enough that you could probably show up without a reservation and get a table with ease. The Pump Room in my case I had to make reservations since I was hosting was a dinner party with a 9 course tasting menu created by James Beard award winner Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten to match. The food is what I expect from Chef Jean-Georges - Amazing. The mixed drinks they offer were excellent including the Raspberry Lychee Bellini and Orange Elderflower. The only issue I had was a small pick with the service. Since this was a tasting menu dinner, the dishes should have been presented and explained Top Chef style. The server did do that but did not vocal it loud enough for the entire table to hear as well as did not bother to even let us know what we were eating with some of the courses. The tasting was not their normal service so I somewhat let it slide but empty drinks are not out of the norm. The Pump Room has everything it needs to be as roaring as it was years ago - James Beard award winning Chef Jean Georges, Michelin Bib Gourmand awarded, and a legendary history (go to the restrooms to see all the pictures). The Pump Room is great for small parties, dates, or casual dinning among friends. I would go back and recommend this place.

My husband hit the nail on the head with the design... it's kind of cool, but minimal and a little bland, as if it's trying to figure out what it wants to be and it's not quite there yet.  If you dig margaritas, get the jalepeno margarita. Yum! The food was good. I had the fried chicken, which was the highlight of the meal. Super crispy, juicy inside, and the buttery hot sauce with it was awesome. My husband had the sea bass and was disappointed. It was good, but considering the price and the restaurant's reputation, he expected it to be great. Lost a star there. For dessert we had the chocolate chip cookie with malt ice cream. My husband isn't a fan of rich decadent desserts so we thought a cookie and ice cream would be good. The menu failed to tell about the liquid chocolate center of the 2"" tall cookie. There was more chocolate sauce than cookie. If you love that sort of thing, this dessert is for you! I had no problem finishing it. :) The service was very good but we had a gift certificate for the hotel and dinner which we gave to the hotel at check-in. The receptionist called the restaurant to inform them of it, but when it came time for the bill after dinner, it wasn't accounted for and it took 20 minutes for our waiter and the manager to figure out how to take care of it.

We made a reservation for late evening on a Friday.  When we arrived, our table wasn't ready- so we had to wait at the bar for a bit and have a cocktail.  The hostess was really sweet- took our jackets - but didn't come get us when the table was ready, we had to go up and check. Once we were seated, our server arrived after a little bit.  He was really knowledgable and got us started off with some new cocktails. When we decided on the meal we would like from the restaurant week menu, I noticed the server became less interested... Maybe b/c we weren't going to be spending an arm and a leg? Who knows.. maybe he was busy, I shouldn't speculate.. but he definitely came around a lot less. The choices on the restaurant week menu were ok.  Nothing too exciting.  The portions were TEENY TINY.  I had a salmon appetizer, fried chicken, and a tiny sundae.  It was about $45 bucks for that - and I was still hungry when I left.  The food was good, but nothing to write home about.  I've had much better salmon/crispy rice, and WAY better fried chicken at The Southern (which was also much more affordable).  The sundae seemed like a sad consolation prize... none of us even wanted to eat it. After I spent $100 bucks on myself between food and drinks at the Pump Room, I felt major buyers remorse.  I could have done so many better things with that money. #FAIL",0.9768,0.844,0.119,0.038,0.4769660238751147

I was happy to see that the Pump Room does this.  Our 9pm reservation was a bit backed-up, so we were invited to have drinks at the VERY cool bar. The raspberry bellini was good, not amazing, but my friends all enjoyed their cocktails. (The Hemingway daquiri, which I tried later, was incredibly wrong in terms of flavors. I know ""wrong"" doesn't say much, but the fruity flavors all interacted in a way that was just...not right. Almost soapy.) About half an hour later, we were seated. What I loved was that we could observe the incredibly sleek, interesting decor (e.g. the lighting fixtures!), but we could also hear each other!  Our waiter, Eric, was very friendly and helpful when describing menu items. Although it was restaurant week, the four of us ladies weren't into the appetizer or dessert options, so we went with entrees. One of my dining companions had the pretzel-crusted calamari, an inventive dish that I briefly sampled - pretty good!  I got the lamb entree, which was served with a mushroom ""bolognese"" - basically intensely rich and slow-cooked mushrooms that resembled a mini-stew. The lamb was also served with some green beans, which were wonderful. The star of the show, of course, was the lamb. Sometimes, lamb can be gamey, but this was not the case here. It was beautifully cooked and very rich - I did not finish it by any stretch. Still, it was so good that I couldn't stop blabbing about it at the table.

Yes.  Overall, it was a unique, upscale menu that lived up to the Pump Room reputation, in my opinion.

2013-12-26,1.0,"My family comes to the Pump Room every year on Christmas Day for brunch- my dad bar-tended there in college so we have always loved it and have always had a great experience... until yesterday. We were sat right away which was great, but from there the experience went downhill. We waited, and waited, and waited. It seemed as though our server was visiting every table except our table of 5 people, and it wasn't even very busy. Finally when he decided to take our food order, one of our guests asked for the mayo from the sandwich on the side- to which our waiter responded that he would have to ""ask the chef if this was possible"" and ""wasn't sure if they had any"". What? Denny's can handle a side order of mayo, why can't the Pump Room? Not only that, but he had such an attitude and back and forth about it, it was bizarre. Ok, whatever, ask away.  Basically we never saw the waiter again after that except for when he brought us our check, which he took another 20 min to come back and pick up. We had to flag down other waiters for cream and sugar for our coffee, refills on water, etc. We would have loved to order more rounds of mimosas with our meal and gladly spend much more, but he was literally never around.  The only good part of the experience was the food- everything was delicious, and they seemed to have found the mayo for the side so that was a plus. If it wasn't Christmas, he definitely would not have received a full tip. So disappointing.",0.9436,0.863,0.094,0.043,0.6357112332112334
2013-12-25,1.0,"I have had great experiences at this restaurant in the past and decided to bring a group of close friends for Christmas Day lunch. I called to confirm the reservation the day before and also informed the restaurant that a member of our party has a severe dairy allergy, which, I was told, would be noted for our server. We were not seated until 12:30 for a noon reservation, and when seated, we were not greeted, given water, or provided with menus. At 12:45, we asked for and received water and placed drink orders from what turned out to be our server, walking by ignoring us. After a few more minutes, we asked for menus from another staff member when we noticed that tables seated after us had received menus, water, and even bread service.  After 1 pm, our server returned with drinks, indicated that he was our server, and asked what we would like to order. My friend made it clear that he has a severe dairy allergy and asked the server to check with the chef about menu items before we would place our order. Our server assured us that certain items would be dairy free, and we ordered our food, hoping for a good Christmas meal despite the opening bumps. We never received bread. The entire meal took close to 4 hours. My friend's entree arrived via another staff member. Out of habit, my friend asked the staff member to confirm that the dish was dairy-free. The staff member returned to announce that the dish contained dairy and removed the dish.  In the meantime, the rest of our party, having waited nearly 2 hours for food, began to eat. Our server returned later to let us know that the chef had ""forgotten"" that the dish contained dairy but that he was remaking it. Very anxious that a chef could forget such things, my friend changed his order and requested items that he had been told would be safe and are typically dairy-free. By the time the alternate dish arrived, the rest of the table had finished. And the alternate dish caused an allergic reaction, so my friend did not eat his food. While he was visiting the front desk to ask for Benadryl, his wife informed the server that the food contained dairy.  No one cleared our plates for what seemed like an eternity. The server tried to engage in some banter with us, but he obviously hated us and definitely made some rude comments that he tried to laugh off. A manager never visited our table. We ordered dessert. The check came. Nothing was comped. We felt insulted. But we couldn't ethically pay for a meal that my friend could not eat and which made him sick. So we asked that it be comped. The server challenged my friend, asked how much of the meal he had eaten, and was completely unapologetic. We watched him speak to his manager, and the item was removed from our bill. A manager NEVER visited our table. I feel terrible that I brought my friends to this restaurant on Christmas.",0.969,0.807,0.119,0.074,0.47834249084249075

2013-12-16,5.0,"Wow. Still reeling from the incredible experience I had here yesterday.  I purchased a private pastry class with chef Kady Yon on Gilt as a present for my sister. We were told we'd get two hours in the kitchen, an apron, and a bag full of goodies, but we walked away four hours later with so much more! Chef Kady was beyond welcoming; showing us around the kitchen, explaining ingredients, and letting us choose two recipes to try out (we chose cocoa peppermint meringues and homemade ice cream!) I was impressed by the thought and care that went into each recipe (and even ingredient choice). When I inquired about a few racks of basil being dehydrated, Kady let us know that they use it to make a salt rim for one of their margaritas, they also squeeze fresh fruit for their other cocktails.  It's that kind of attention to detail you can expect at Pump Room.  Okay now onto the food (and the reason for my future diabetes): Cheese cake & carrot cake -  normally my eyes would glaze over these (usually) boring dessert menu staples, but the cheese cake with homemade grape sorbet and figs is unreal. And the carrot cake isn't the rock that your mama makes, light and creamy...mmmm  Deep dish cookie: cut it open and surpreeeese! Molten chocolate! Now that's a surprise I'll never tire of Peanut butter and jelly doughnut -  I died Cinnamon roll - just shut up (can anyone else eat a cinnamon roll without thinking of Louis ck and hot jizz?) Kady and the rest of the servers and bartenders made us feel so at home. Fan for life!",0.949,0.869,0.094,0.037,0.5462499999999999

2013-12-09,4.0,"Driving up the north end of a tree-lined State Street past a variety of quiet high-end residential units immediately sets somewhat of a mysterious, exciting vibe for a night in the Pump Room.  The entrance to the Public Hotel is not the typical hotel's loud entrance protruding from the street, which isn't a bad thing whatsoever.  It rests quietly along the street, only highlighted by two door men and a subtle ""Public"" sign, almost waiting to be discovered.   The same holds true upon entering the Pump Room.  After proceeding through the cool, sleek lobby of the Public hotel, you simply proceed up a small stairwell to the left into the opening of the Pump Room.  The host stand is situated as such so it requires you to walk all the way through the bar, obtain a view of the restaurant, and immediately become hooked even before checking in.   Let's begin with the bar area - The bar area is tightly, yet still comfortably, filled with low tables and chairs with strong sides/arms, which further provide the guests the ability to feel somewhat closed off, or more connected with the rest of the people at their table.  Upon taking a minute to observe the bar, I noticed a group of young woman, two older men, business men, and a couple other tables of mixed groups and a wide age range.  It is important to keep in mind here that this place used to be an historic/iconic restaurant, and despite the recent renovations, still attracts well seasoned guests that were part of the scene years ago, and continue to remain so today.  This iconic/historic essence, in addition to the fact this is a ""hotel"" bar, truly makes for an eclectic environment through the variety of interesting people present every night.  The bar itself is simple, sleek, and doesn't try to be the center point of the room.  It does, however, catch your eye from across the room while the carved in collapsing design of the walls surrounding the bar almost pull you in with them.  Three steps below the bar/lounge area is the restaurant itself.  This sunken design draws the bar guests to the restaurant while also drawing the restaurant guests to the bar, further enhancing the the likelihood you either return to eat there, or grab an after dinner drink up in the bar. The restaurant is comprised of simple, and again sleek designed round booths and square(ish) smaller tables for 2-4 tops.  Don't picture your standard Applebees booth when you read ""booths"" here.  These are modern, yet very comfortable booths that could hold 4-5 within the booth itself, and then 2-3 in the chairs on the front rim of the booth. So if you were hesitant to make that reservation for 6 or 7 because they would have to provide some awkward makeshift table that only allows you to speak with the people that end up sitting at the other end of the table when you're getting your jacket to leave, fear no more.  These booths are designed to enable a full, comprehensive conversation between up to 8 people.   The menu itself is very thorough, yet simple.  I would consider it modernized-american with hints of french, italian, and south american.  It is hearty, yet daring....which typically aren't used in the same sentence. Everything from pizza flatbreads, to a high-end burger, playful pastas, seafood, truly green salads, and red meat are available.  I decided to have the Beef Short Rib.  The meat itself was perfectly crusted on the outside, which provided an extremely enjoyable contrast to the world-renowned tenderness of a cut of short rib.  Many restaurants will simply cook the meat and maybe add some type of gravy to such a dish.  However, as I stated, the revitalized Pump Room has a daring side to the menu.  The short rib was coated in a chile glaze that provided a rich, yet spicy aspect to the meat, further enhancing the overall experience on top of the already perfectly cooked and contrasting piece of meat.  After dinner activities involved cappucinos, espressos, and people watching in the bar from our tucked away table in the restaurant.  Regarding service, the staff is very knowledgeable of the menu.  They are dressed in line with the vibe of the entire restaurant/bar, allowing guests to feel comfortable wearing anything from a custom suit or a simple black-t with jeans to dinner.   One thing to keep in mind is that you are just off State street in an Ian Schrager hotel restaurant, so the prices aren't necessarily life-threatening, but they are not cheap.  End of the day, however, it is completely worth it due to the menu, environment, and potential that lies within this establishment to serve as the beginning, middle, and end of your night.",0.9788,0.913,0.067,0.02,0.4350420168067228

2013-11-24,3.0,"I came here about a month ago for my birthday. As I'd just moved to Chicago from overseas I didn't know much about the restaurant scene but chose pump room based on the reviews and photos of what looked like a place with good ambience and a bit more up market to celebrate a belated bday with my bf who had been out of town on my actual bday. Anyway I guess for me it just didn't sit right as a trendy upmarket restaurant. As we arrived we felt a little off place to begin with... I felt like we were the only people under 40 there (oh until we were seated next to a sugar daddy and his much younger date... but I'll get to that). The hostesses at the front were not all that welcoming, a bit aloof, but I put it down to the place being pretty busy. Both our waiters on the other hand we had were easy going and attentive. We were seated on a tiny table with comfy chairs... however they were a bit deep so you ended up having to eat with high elbows if you get what I mean. Also VERY close to the tables next to you so you could hear pretty much the convos going on... and feel the awkwardness when the sugar daddy was trying to hold hands with his younger date and getting denyed. It also meant when the waitress was going in between the tables she knocked my glass / the candle  etc with her bum!  Final word on ambiance... I liked the ball lights on the roof but that was about it for the room... there isn't anything else memorable about the place except it's dark but not dark enough to not see the lady wearing a dress with full cut outs down both sides of her dress! I feel like this place is trying for classy but falls short... Not only with the ambiance but the food isn't exactly fine dining either... And firstly, I'm not a food snob, I eat everything from kfc to degustation... but here I felt like we paid over $150 for an experience that was lacking. I had a prosecco based cocktail that was ok but nothing memorable so just stuck to plain prosecco after that. We shared the charcuterie platter for appetizer which was probably the best part of the meal... heaps of different cheeses and meats... a great spread! I then had the pork with prosciutto and my bf had the fish. We also had sides which I don't remember which we got. I'm a lover of pork and this was pretty nice... but it was a huge thick chop and was completely (I mean completely.... bone and all) wrapped in prosciutto! I was kind of expecting 2 small thinner chops with say one or two rashes of prosciutto.... what I got just felt a bit more like a hearty pub meal then fine dining! My bf liked his fish but it was a pretty standard dish. As it was my birthday I would have loved dessert and more cocktails but as we hadn't had the best meal ever we decided to give dessert a miss and go out for cocktails elsewhere. Maybe if we'd stayed we would have got a comp dessert or something for my birthday... but we didn't get anything special for the occasion... although the waiters acknowledged it was my birthday that was it. When I went to jelly fish with girlfriends on my actual bday they gave us two rounds of shots and a dessert. I'm not always looking for something free but the extra effort for an occasion makes you want to go back. The food was fine, service was fine too I just didn't feel it at this place. Maybe it's just not right for what I'm after... others seem to enjoy it!",0.9986,0.808,0.16,0.033,0.5349194847020933

It wasn't terrible but at the same time after hearing how the dinner menu is excellent I was kind of was expecting the same. I got the Challah French Toast, Caramelized Apples, Smoked Bacon. Bacon was undercooked (I know that is just a preference and some people like that. Of course I would never rate a place based on my own preferences) and the French Toast was soggy, it was like my whole meal was the consistency of a shake, just limp and mushing. It's saving grace was that it had flavor.  Walking in the place is gorgeous, great design. I don't know if it was a bad morning but the staff with the exception of the bartenders were really aloof.

2013-11-13,3.0,"I chose to make reservations at the Pump Room, located in the Public Hotel, because I wanted to try one of the older, established restaurants in the Gold Coast and see what Chicago's swanky dining scene was all about.  I chose the Pump Room over other establishments because of the fact that Frank Sinatra used to hang out here, and my husband is a big fan. I'll start with the food, which easily merits 4.5 if not 5 stars.  The fried chicken, served with spinach, was outstanding!  I believe this dish was $22, and I would definitely have this again.  The fried chicken was served with a fancier hot sauce, and the spinach was seasoned like no spinach I've ever eaten in my entire life.   The pork chop wrapped in proscuitto was the best pork chop I have ever eaten.  It was a thick chop which made for a hearty meal.  The portion sizes look deceiving, because we were both wondering if we'd be starving when we left here.  We were not! We had the crab cake appetizer.  I was very disappointed with this appetizer.  It tasted okay, but for the price (almost $20) and portion, (one cake smaller than a chicken patty) it was a waste of money.  Earlier in the bar, we shared a flatbread, which was very good, but honestly I would skip the appetizers here and go straight for the entrees. I also had a Hemingway Daiquiri while we waited in the bar earlier.  I was very appreciative when the hostess carried the drink to our table for me, otherwise I probably would have spilled it!  Most cocktails on the list aren't anything special as they are classic cocktails you can get elsewhere.  Again I'd suggest you do your cocktailing before or after dinner if interested in a more inventive menu. Our service during dinner was wonderful.  Our waitress was very attentive and made sure our water glasses didn't go unfilled.  I love the classic, Midwestern cuisine served here, but it's in an upscale environment.  There is nothing confusing about the ingredients or food. The dining area is simple, dim but not too dark, and very comfortable.  I also didn't have any problems making a reservation, and I think all dining times were still available a month in advance.  Our dinner was great, and I would love the place a lot more if our experience from walking in the door, to sitting in the bar, was a lot better. Our reservations were at 9:00 p.m., but we got here early since I was so hungry that I began to feel sick, so I had hoped they would have a table available for us.  The hostess told us we would have to wait until 9:00 p.m., which was fine, I don't expect to be catered to just because I show up early.  However, she was less than apologetic, quite snobby, and didn't even point us in the direction of the bar.   There are two bar areas.  The one connected to the restaurant was packed.  We walked through the hotel lobby, which is much too dimly lit for a hotel lobby, and found a bar on the opposite side.  I approached not one, but two waitresses, who were standing at the POS stand.  They both turned around and walked away from me.  Is this another one of those dreams where no one can see me?  Finally, I flagged down one of the waitresses and inquired if there was a wait, or if it was open seating since it wasn't clear if this was only for the hotel guests or restaurant guests.  I truly did not feel welcome at all in the bar area - and we did order two drinks AND an appetizer. We grabbed a spot on the sofa, which we sunk into (it was constructed like a grandmother's basement sofa that survived many decades of floods).  I like to lounge.  I like to go to lounges.  I don't like to be sucked into sofas!   I was curious about the dress code before booking, and I didn't see much about it on Yelp so I'll add my thoughts here:  It's dressy casual.  Men do not have to wear a jacket and tie, but a jacket looks nice with a dressy button-up, jeans and dress shoes.  Women can wear nicer jeans or dress pants, and I saw several women in cocktail dresses or skirts.  Leave your t-shirts, hoodies, army jackets, hippie wear, UGGS and athletic shoes behind. When I think about how we spent $120+ here, I feel I can definitely classify it as 3 stars, A-OK, because I did enjoy my meal despite the bad first impression, but I'm not likely to recommend it.",0.9973,0.795,0.148,0.057,0.551357671957672

2013-10-23,1.0,"Our dining experience at Pump Room last night will go down as one of our worst experiences in Chicago yet. 75 years later, this restaurant has officially lost its appeal. Things got off to a rocky start when I watched the hostess take the coat of the woman in front of me and check it. I removed my coat assuming the same would be offered to me, but my coat was not acknowledged at all. We were seated at a lovely table and our server came by to greet us. We ordered a bottle of wine and started looking over the menu. We noticed that other tables around us had been served bread and olive oil, but we received none. The second unfortunate event occurred when our server poured, and ruined, our lovely bottle of wine. We were impressed that he brought us the proper wine glasses for our cab franc, but very upset when he poured literally ¾ of the bottle between the two of us. If you know anything about wine, you know that it needs to breathe and open up, and cannot do that where there is so much of it in the glass. Not only did our server clearly not know this, but another server who tried to top off my glass when it was still half full clearly did not either. We did not enjoy our buckets of wine. We decided upon two starters (foie gras brulee and beet salad), at which point my boyfriend let our server know that he has a nut allergy and we asked, just to be sure, if there were nuts in either item we were ordering. Neither menu item listed nuts, but you can never be too safe. Our server assured us that neither did, so we went ahead with the two. Minutes later, our beet salad arrived, chock full of hazelnuts. So, not only did our server put my boyfriend in danger, but the menu also failed to mention the nuts. Incredibly irresponsible. We actually then debated if we should even order entrees or just finish our dinner elsewhere because things were going so poorly. I am sorry to say that we stayed at Pump Room, and ate two of the worst, greasiest plates of food we have ever had. The short rib and the pork chop were both ""flash fried"" which has to be one of the worst culinary decisions I can think of. It caused there to be absurd amounts of grease oozing out at every bite. The pork chop itself was so fatty that half of it couldn't even be eaten. These were truly gross and after only a few bites both of us were feeling sick to our stomachs. Our server then attempted to sell us on dessert, sadly highlighting two desserts that clearly stated that they had nuts in them. ""Here we go again"" we both thought. At that point we just wanted to get out of there, paid our check and left. I should also note that we were surprised to see that the beet salad had not been comped; clearly our server didn't even bother telling the Manager that he nearly killed one of his guests. It's been a few years since we have been to Pump Room, but I can assure you that there is NOTHING in this world that would get us back. Even this morning I am disgusted by the entire experience and can't wait to forget it.",-0.9782,0.791,0.088,0.12,0.4883318070818071
2013-10-23,4.0,"It's amazing how some restaurants can barely fill half their space up on a Friday night and others are overflowing on a Tuesday. The Pump Room - Tuesday evening - dining room and bar area - BOOKED. From observing the well-heeled crowd to scanning the gallery of black and white photos of celebrity guests, there is a lot of people-watching going on! In between that there's the food. First of all, perfect cocktails - Orange Elderflower and Sour Cherry Old Fashioned - both great choices. The bread service - there's bread here! Who would have thought! I'm not sure if they bake it themselves, but the bread is fantastic. It only comes with 3 pieces so enjoy every last drop of olive oil! Whole Wheat Flatbread is more of a small pizza (Reminds me of a piadine) - although the lamb merguez can barely be tasted, overall the ""flatbread"" has a lot of flavor - comes with 4 large round slices. Pretzel Dusted Calamari sounds exciting but is really just fried calamari - I will give them that they are lightly coated and one can still taste the calamari inside, but I could not taste any pretzel. This would be much classier and tastier if it was grilled and truly dusted with pretzel. The best part was the 2 sauces the dish came with. Fresh Tagliatelle with caramelized Brussels Sprouts and basil-pistachio pesto was by far our favorite item. Soft homemade pasta, roasted nuts, pesto, and bite-size pieces of Brussels Sprouts make for a great appetizer or entree (love that you can choose a size). 3 appetizers (and 2 cocktails) were enough to fill the 2 of us up, together with friendly service made for a wonderful Pump Room experience!

2013-10-10,1.0,"I don't like having to give a one star to a place that I mostly like. But my last experience was horrid, and I don't know if I'll be going back as a result. Me and my date arrived around 9:30, and we were only planning to drink in the bar. There are plenty of opens spots, but a number of places that have ""reserved"" signs. We sit at a couch and proceed to order 3 rounds. At about 10:30, just after ordering our third round, the waitress informs us that our seat is reserved for 11. Interesting - you just let us order another round and yet you are telling us we need to move along.  Fine, we said, we will be done by 11, though we were irritated at the treatment. Especially since there were several other available tables. No more than 5 minutes passed and the waitress's manager came over to us to ask that we leave soon. We said we had just received our drinks and while we understood our seats were reserved at 11, we would finish our drinks and leave before that time. He was irritated with us for wanting to finish the drink we had just received. I shouldn't be shocked my such rudeness in the hospitality industry, of which I've spent a lot of time working in, but I always am.  At 10:45, as we are nearing the end of our drinks, our waitress reminds us that we need to leave (note we haven't yet received our bill yet so we haven't been able to pay). We said we would be leaving soon, after getting our bill. She returned quickly with the bill and said the people who reserved our table were there. Her manager stood near our table and stared at us. We weren't being loud, rude or obnoxious. We were just trying to finish our drink. Also, 2 gentleman had sat at the other end of our couch, despite the ""reserved"" sign, and were allowed to order a bottle of wine. And no, they weren't the ones reserving the rest of the couch, but they weren't kicked out like we were.  We probably stayed longer at this point just because we were so offended by how rude the Manager treated us. But we did pay and leave at 10:50, 10 minutes before the alleged reservation. I say alleged because we went out into the lobby, and waited....11.....11:15 and those people so eager to take our space never materialized. Which was interesting since we were told they were already there.  I understand that some bars want to attract/detract a certain clientele. But we had just come from a 5 star restaurant so we were definitely dressed appropriately (suit, dress, heals, etc.). We were drinking spendy drinks at a decent pace, and typically we are very generous tippers. If we were too ""old,"" or ""unfashionable"" then I guess our money is too ""old"" and ""unfashionable"" to patronize your snobby club. You should have refunded us and just asked us to leave on the spot. There are HUNDREDS of great, classy bars in Chicago, so it's no loss to us not to return here. But we will be telling everyone we know that if they don't want to be treated like a 2nd class citizen, they should go elsewhere.",0.3116,0.829,0.082,0.088,0.44025689223057646

You know, the basics.  Their website has a picture of some really cool light balls in the dining room. I chose skinny jeans, a breezy dark blue cotton top, and black Tahari heels. SO glad my boyfriend talked me out of a see-through turquoise tank and matching bra! (It looked classier than it sounds. Promise.) When I was nearing the right address, I kept looking for a sign with the restaurant's name on it. Then I saw them, peeking through the large windows - those light balls! I knew I was in the right place. I parked my Honda on the street about a block away for free. Nice. I was a little early so decided to chill for a minute in the bar area. They have a bunch of low tables and big comfy love seats in a semi circle around the bar. I took a seat and got a glass of Riesling. Knowing that I would soon be eating in the dining room, I asked for my bill so I could pay right away. $13. For a single glass of wine. Yikes. That was when I realized this place was fancy.  My friend arrived then. The hostess carried my unfinished glass of wine to the table for me. The room was romantic and softly lit Those fun light balls provided the perfect amount of light to be comfortable. We sat in the middle of the room in big stuffed chairs around a small square table. I really liked how our menus came on small wooden clipboards. It's unusual and that makes it fun. I had perused the menu on their website earlier and decided on the salt and pepper shrimp. My friend who had been here before chose a spinach flatbread. Shortly after sitting down our waitress brought bread and olive oil. So far, so good.  My shrimp was absolutely amazing. It was incredibly flavorful, but nearing on the edge of too much spice. It came with a light yellow sauce, that I didn't particularly care for.  I had a bite of my friend's flatbread. Oh yeah, I could definitely see myself getting that some time.  So with a couple glasses of wine, bread, and a shrimp appetizer I left full and happy.

It was served in the same glass with the ice leftover from the previous drink - no additional ice added. The charcuterie was a good appetizer. The special was halibut.

Loved the black truffle flatbread- def something unique.

First of all, Brian is an excellent bartender. It was fun to watch him apply his ""mix magic"" although we were only drinking wine. He explained how the chef made his own flavored simple sugars - very appealing but we passed on a ""school night"". He was also one of those engaging bartenders that we like to talk with - the right amount of conversation and professionalism...and service.  Food: The kale salad was outstanding. I usually think of Kale as being stiff without a lot of flavor and this was well-chopped and infused with an excellent dressing. We then had the flat bread pizzas. The truffle pizza was a little too overloaded with the truffle flavor - not subtle at all. My husband's margarita pizza was great.

The place is loud but not so loud where you can easily have a great conversation with your friends. The seating is also extremely comfy as you sit in this super classy hotel restaurant. By the way, the Public hotel is also gorgeous! The food and drinks were terrific. The lychee champagne drink we had was awesome, perfect combo of sweet and bubbly to get the night started. We started with the pretzel dipped calamari with a mustard sauce which were a little spicy just the way I love it, also served with a delicious marinara if the mustard isn't your thing.

I tried to ignore that. Than when I asked for some bread for the table since I saw other tables had bread, he flat out said ""That's for people who have a complete dining experience."" WTF, and us ordering an appetizer, a flatbread, dessert and drinks, that's not a dining experience. I'm thinking wow, how rude. Than when our check came in the end of the meal as he really tried to get us out of there for some reason, we asked him to split the check among the 3 of us and I wrote down exactly how much to charge per card. He f*cked up and charged us all the wrong amounts. And then instead of apologizing he said ""you know, I don't have time to split bills on such a small amount since most people order more than you guys"" I was in shock, who talks to their customers like that, I mean wow. So then with a whole lot of attitude he finally did it right and we paid and left with a real sour taste in our mouth because of him. Today when I checked my credit card bill, I was over charged just for my part alone $65.00. I mean $65 over what my personal tab should have been.

The calamari was a none event, you can find much better fare at other restaurants without the price and pretentiousness.

2013-07-26,5.0,"Dining date:  July 20th, 2013 Website:   pumproom.com A quintessential Chicago restaurant, the Pump Room is a destination everyone in Chicago should visit at least once.  Established in 1938, the restaurant quickly became a celebrity hot spot.  The restaurant was recently re-opened (2011) and has now become more approachable. The restaurant itself is very open and the lighting is some of the best I have seen.  The service was excellent and I found our waiter to be attentive and very knowledgeable about the food.  I also appreciated his recommendations, which I am sure he delivered because we informed him early on that this was our first time at the restaurant.  The true hallmark of a great waiter is someone who listens to his guests, and reacts accordingly.  In our case, we were newbies to the restaurant that needed some guidance, and he was quick to offer suggestions without being overly pushy. The food itself is comparable to some of the best restaurants in the city.  Great care is put in appropriate presentation of all the dishes.  Any of the dishes when photographed could grace the cover of a food magazine.  Some of the culinary highlights include: Watermelon salad with goat cheese -- A light, refreshing starter.  The watermelon and goat cheese combo bring together the perfect ingredients to get the taste buds firing. Black truffle, fontina cheese, frisee, and chives -- Whole wheat flat bread with a generous helping of black truffles.  Would highly recommend if you are a fan of black truffle. Fried chicken -- Both white and dark meat chicken fried perfectly. Dessert -- The star of the evening.  I don't recall the exact name of the dish, but it was the perfect ending to a great dinner.  Essentially an elegant lava cake with ice cream.  The ratios of chocolate to cake to ice cream were perfect and expertly made. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special event.  This restaurant is perfect for birthdays, anniversary's and those days when you just want to dress up and go to a great restaurant. pbarot.blogspot.com",0.9968,0.797,0.199,0.004,0.5641011042097999

2013-07-17,4.0,"I dined at the Pump Room twice. The first time was back in January and the second was around mid May. The first time I went there, I made reservations for 9:30 p.m. Though I arrived on time, our table was not yet ready. It was no problem because my date and I got our drinks (I had the rapsberry lychee bellini, he a red wine) by the bar and the waitress was very attentive and the drinks were remarkably delicious! I have to say, I'm not much of an alcoholic drinker, but golly, that bellini has got to be my all time favorite.      We got our table and our main waitress was extremely friendly and checked on us at the right moments. We even had a great conversation with her here and there. The food was spectacular! The chef actually gave us a complimentary appetizer. We ordered the salmon and Hands down the best salmon I have ever tasted. The salmon was so delicate, but with just the right amount of flavor in every bite. The suckling pork belly was my favorite. They marinated the pork for 48 hours! We ordered a passionfruit cheesecake for dessert and that was also very delicious. I ordered a second drink, which the waitress said was one of Pump Room's favorites from customers. I didn't like it so much, and the waitress gladly replaced my drink with another raspberry lychee bellini.     The reason why I am giving this a 4 star instead of 5 is because the second time I went there, they added a few new items on the menu. The foods we ordered were okay, not as great as the first time. This time we ordered another type of pork (sweet to the taste) and beef tenderlion. We also had 2 waiters instead of one, and I didn't felt like they were interactive with us at all. The appetizer with the calamari was amazing though! I enjoyed this one spicy sauce so much, I asked for more bread and dipped it in the sauce. By end of dinner, One of the managers did kindly stop by our table and offered to help us take a picture.  Breakdown: 1. They have valet parking ($14).  it is gold coast and it saves you time looking for parking. Trust me, weekend nights are probably the toughest time to find parking.  2. Drinks are delicious but around $12 per drink.  3. Dishes are bit pricey and small portions 4. great ambience and service  5. they encourage and welcome people who takes pictures!

To my surprise the place looked incredibly elegant and with this drastic update came drastically improved menu.  FOOD & BEVERAGES  Now, two brunches and one dinner later I must extend my genuine compliments to the chef for many unique to this place and absolutely mind-blowing dishes!  BRUNCH truly stands out with a fun ""Make Your Own Bubbles"" idea! That alone has many guests returning. You get a great bottle of prosecco and three different in-house made juice blends to experiment with mimosas! Some of their brunch highlights also included Warm Shrimp Salad (served with avocado) and Egg Custard (served with whipped goat cheese) if you want to stay on the light side. Of course, if you are hungry go for their Friend Chicken (served on a bed of lightly sautéed spinach with out-of-this-world spicy sauce) is amazingly delicious! It could be the most elegant execution of this urban dish with a southern influence I had seen!  Bravo!!!   At DINNER, my favorites were the Sweet Pea Soup and the Tuna Tartar, yes... the usual suspects but I promise you, different from traditional presentations, certainly worth a try - both excellent! I thought the smoked pasta with meatballs was an interesting twist on Italian comfort food, and also very well done!  Excellent value! Very nice wine list and very creative cocktails (ask them about the passion fruit cocktail)!  SERVICE  Beyond expectations!  Especially during my last visit our waitress Vera and her supporting staff were beyond attentive and genuinely friendly with us! My friend was telling a story over brunch,  gesturing in excitement she dropped her mimosa on the floor. She was so embarrassed when the flute broke and her drink spilled allover.

The waitresses were all very attractive, but that was about the only thing they had going for them. As I mentioned, they were blatantly forgetting to put in orders. They actually brought out and extra order of fries that no one ordered. When we told them no one ordered these fries they took them back. The problem is that it still showed up on the bill. They just seemed very aloof. Clearly they were hired for their looks and not their capability to be a good waitress. By the end of the night, they didn't want to wade through a crowd of people to our table so they held the check out for me to physically stand up and walk over to get from their station. Really?

We had a reservation on Saturday night and had no trouble being seated.  Waitstaff was incredibly helpful, charismatic, and attentive. Can't ask for more.  We had heard good things about the specialty cocktail menu and we were all pleased! Very unique and fresh. I was especially impressed with the raspberry lychee bellini and the lavender daiquiri which were most suited to my tastes. The food was delicious. I had perused the menu prior to our trip and was not particularly impressed with any of the options, but after eating we decided the menus did not do the food justice. We had the kale salad which was incredible. The waiter described it as ""our version of a caesar salad"". The fresh mint really stood out and the kale was finely shredded and delicious. Not too much dressing, either. For an entree, I had the half-sized bowtie pasta with veal meatballs and smoked tomato sauce. The half-size came with two decently sized meatballs and a bit smaller portion of pasta (compared to the full-size with four meatballs and more pasta). I usually find restaurant portions to be too large for my appetite, so the half-size was exactly what I wanted. The entree sounds simple but the tomato pieces in the sauce were bursting with flavor and the meatballs were very moist. Others were pleased with the slow-cooked salmon with truffle vinaigrette, angel hair pasta with asparagus pesto, fresh ricotta ravioli, and the spinach-herb-goat cheese flatbread (which was LOADED with toppings and quite delicious!).  All in all, the atmosphere, good drinks, helpful waitstaff, and general ambiance made this a great location to celebrate the bride-to-be. Very classic, elegant, and swanky. Definitely worth the money and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating any event in Chicago.",0.9972,0.784,0.206,0.01,0.6032175032175032

2013-05-13,4.0,"This place has a lot of history for my family as my father was an agent and used to bring his celebrity clients there in the 50's and 60's and sit at the famed ""Table 1"", which had the phone that rang to Irv Kupcinet. When they auctioned off all the remnants of the old Pump Room a few years back, I went and tried to purchase a photo that hung on the wall of Phil Ford and Mimi Hines, the performers that introduced my parents to each other. I was told the new owner was keeping the photos, which they still display on the walls of the entrance and downstairs by the bathrooms, but sadly the photo of Phil and Mimi is missing from the bunch. Even so, the redesign looks fabulous and it appeals to a younger, hipper crowd, but is still tasteful enough to bring the parents, which I did for mother's day brunch. The staff was more than accommodating seating us together with friends that had a reservation for the same time and our server was attentive and friendly. We ordered the mimosa mixer flight, with blood orange, strawberry lychee, sweet chili, and regular orange mixers, all of which were fabulous. My mother and I started out with the PB&J donut, which was tasty and very rich, but nonetheless yummy. My friend's son had the Kale salad which he declared ""the best thing ever"" and kept raving about it for the rest of the meal. My mother ordered eggs benedict, which she split with me and while they were decent, not the best eggs benedict I've ever had. I had the Challah French Toast, which was slightly disappointing, but the bread was soft and melted in your mouth. For dessert, we had the cinammon roll, which came recommended by our server and that was truly a delight. Strongly recommend that for those going to brunch. I have visited on a few previous occasions and both times, we were highly impressed buy the cocktails (the Old fashioned is a favorite) and the quality of food. The beets with yogurt and balsamic vinegar are to die for and a dining partner absolutely loved the fresh suckling pig entree. A wonderful place for a special occasion or dressy ""night-on-the-town"" dinner. Great place to take out-of-towners to show them a slice of Chicago history.

As well as the flatbread with San Marzano tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella. The flatbread had good flavor, but would have liked the temperature to be a little warmer. Additionally, at one time, we had all three appetizers on our table at once. It would have been nice if our waiter had spaced out the dishes a little bit. Because so many of the appetizer and starter courses appealed to us, we decided to share the Fried Chicken. I had heard so many rave reviews about this dish, and we were both disappointed by it. I have had much better fried chicken at upscale restaurants, and thought the flavor of the hot, melted butter did not go well with the chicken and ruined the sauteed spinach for me. We also ordered the broccoli with pistachios, chili, and mint as our side and it was delicious. I would highly recommend the Pump Room if you are looking for a restaurant with great tastes and atmosphere. It is one of the best looking restaurants in Chicago.

The bar menu is cool.  Craft sodas, big whisky selection.  Our service wasn't very on point.  We had to wait a while for anybody to come.  Half of us were served, the other half weren't.   Moved into the dining room.  Appetizers were on point.  Absolutely delicious.  Coursing was very off though.  Very long time to take our dinner orders. We were finished with our appetizers for about 40 minutes before our server ever took our dinner order.   Half of the entrees were meh.  I'd definitely recommend the lamb.  Best entree on the menu.  Stay away from the Diver Scallops. Desserts are great, though just as pricey as the appetizers. I'd go back because of the food, but I did expect a bit more from their service.  Next time I'd eat a lot of apps and dessert, and probably skip the entrees.",0.8956,0.903,0.091,0.007,0.3526470588235294

The restaurant is big, beautiful, chic, and swanky at the same time. My bestfriend lives in Chi Town took me here for lunch. - Tomato Soup, with crostini and chese on the side for dipping. It was so tasty and satisfying for a cold day in Chi town.   - Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - Giant piece of crostini, plenty of crab meats to share. - Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare with Ginger Dressing, Spicy Radishes - this is chef Jean-Georges signature dish.

I had heard a lot of hype about the Pump Room, and expected it to live up to the quality of other restaurants in the same price range. The food at Pump Room is on the pricier side with most entrees costing $30ish.  I ordered the squash and ricotta toast appetizer. The taste of the caramelized onions overwhelmed the other ingredients. I could barely taste the ricotta which was disappointing. Then I ordered the tagliatelle with caramelized brussels sprouts and a pistachio basil pesto. The waitress even said that it was one of her favorites. The brussels sprouts were not caramelized, they weren't even browned. They also had zero flavor. I gave one to my husband who said, ""your brussels sprouts are better, these need salt and lemon"". This is a dish that sounded delicious, and probably has lots of potential, but the execution just wasn't there. It was a mediocre $24 pasta that I only ate half of. For the amount of money spent, there are other restaurants that are far better (like my favorite, Gemini Bistro).

The roasted carrot salad was interesting with the spices but not something I would get again. The same applied for the fried chicken. The fried chicken is a large serving  approximately at least half of an 8 inch dinner plate. It appeared to be nongreasy but tasted greasy.  We also tried the squash ricotta cheese from the appetizer section. The squash is super salty, making it no longer tasty.  The desserts were good: warm chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. only sadness is that the vanilla ice cream is 1 tablespoon large.  Could I not have more ice cream so I can have a bite of ice cream with a bite of chocolate cake?  Also tried the sundae - salted caramel ice cream with chocolate fudge, peanuts, caramel popcorn. The salted caramel ice cream was interesting but overall too salty for my taste even with the excessive amount of fudge I would have with it.

The restaurant was not very crowded and thus, was very capable of seating us quickly at a large, prepared table. The service was impeccable, the food was great, the interior design is gorgeous. I love the light installations!   My one major complaint was that there was very loud construction (floor buffing?) going on in the nearby lobby. Finally, after we asked our server if something could be done about the noise, he and the manager closed the heavy drapes that surround the dining room. This did help to muffle the noise, but unfortunately, the construction was still audible and lasted throughout our entire meal. Another peeve is that they go around to each patron with bottles, offering still and sparkling water without the option (unless you ask) of having tap water. And then, of course, you get charged for the bottled water. In my opinion, they should ask if you'd like regular or bottled water and THEN, if you select bottled, whether you'd like still or sparkling. We didn't know such a significant price ($40) would be tacked on to our bill for bottled water because most in our group just selected a bottled option without requesting tap water.

2012-08-19,2.0,"I quite honestly didn't know too much about this venue, but with an education from friends that live in Chicago, this was the IT place to hang out. So with such a deep history (Rat Pack and celebrity hangout) and the Ian Schrager name behind it, you would expect this venue to be the tits--decor dashing but unexpected, service to be impeccable, food and drink to be top notch. Even with all the hype over this place, I truly came in with no expectations, and sadly it didn't even satisfy the bare minimum.  We came for for drinks and something to nosh on before our dinner reservations at Nightwood (amazing, BTW) and were promptly seated on some luxurious arm chairs and couches. The service was a hot mess. I think they hired servers for their legs and not for the ability to carry a drink correctly. We ordered four cocktails and she put down one drink and spilled a quarter of the contents on the table--splashing some on my friend. And as she was apologizing, she subsequently spilled the next two drinks, leaving the final one (mine) intact, albeit with a very sticky martini stem. I was at first sympathetic to her situation--she was pretty tall and wearing heels and had to place drinks on a relatively low table--but I can't excuse people not doing their job. She said she would replace the spilled drinks, but she only replaced the first one. My friend commented that it would have been nice if they comped at least one of the drinks.  As for the food, I noticed that the menu was created by Jean-Georges and I was looking forward to tasting a decent canapé or two. Sadly, what I thought was the famed crab toast from his ABC Kitchen restaurant in NYC, was definitely not. My friends even thought it wasn't that good for crab on toast. On a brighter note, the fries with the siracha mayo were crispy, delicious, with just enough kick. Cocktails were decent, but i would avoid the bee's knees--I've had better. My first thought of the decor was that it was pretty bland with its extremely muted color palette, but that's my opinion. Friends said they liked it because it takes away the focus on the venue and more on the amazing conversations and company. I didn't like it. I especially was bothered by the floating balls in the dining area. Although we didn't dine there, I did notice the balls were placed dangerously low, and I just feel a quick stretch of my arms and I would knock one of those balls, but that's just me. And I could also imagine mini anxiety attacks for claustrophobically-inclined, or at least an off-putting awareness that there was a ball fairly close to your face. There was an occupied table where a ball was just to the left of the a lady sitting, and I noticed she was leaning to the right--you make your own conclusions (see ball on bottom right next to the seat.  interiordesign.net/artic… ). I actually liked the hotel library room on the opposite side of the entrance a LOT better, so i recommend if you have your drinks, have them there, perhaps the service will be better too.

If you're looking for inspired food and impressive service, book elsewhere. It's style over substance and that's fine, but don't hope for more. Our first server introduced himself to us and took our order. Then a woman (who ended up being the unfriendliest Chicagoan we encountered in four days in our new favorite city) appeared on the scene to take our wine order. I thought she might be the sommelier, but no explanation on the staff change was offered and we continued to be served (oddly) by two people. Anyway, I asked a clarifying question about the wine list (a Southern Rhone was labeled as such AND as coming from The Loire) and was told by our unfriendly Chicagoan: ""I have no idea. It must be a typo"". No offer to seek an answer. Ok, then.... I ordered the wine (knowing that it wasn't from The Loire); it was delicious. She showed me the bottle of wine and then took it to the other side of the room where she opened it. She brought it back for tasting and pouring and then put it in an ice bucket on the other side of the room, along with someone else's bottle. This was all just weird, unprofessional and downright bizarre. I finally had her just leave the bottle on the table and then she annoyingly  continued to overfill our glasses (either due to her naiveté or from a corporate dictate to make sure wine gets consumed quickly) Beet and yogurt salad: interesting combo; beets were flavorless. Heirloom tomatoes on toast: how could this be bad; it wasn't; but it didn't knock any socks off and I'd be shocked if it really were an heirloom tomato. Meyer lemon pasta: delicious and cooked perfectly to al dente. Fried chicken: delicious but plain and uninspired. Crispy suckling pig: not crispy, too salty and the meat was mush; disgusting, really. Sunday with chocolate and popcorn: delicious, but how could it not be? Limoncello: fine Moscato d'Asti: first glass served was watery and had not a hint of effervescence; sent it back and our unfriendly Chicagoan snipped: ""It was slightly flat so we opened another bottle."" Condescending and pretentious and then insulting because the second glass, while definitely from a different bottle, again didn't have a hint of effervescence. In summary, I'd never eat here again which is sad because we'll be definitely staying at the hotel again. This is a restaurant that definitely needs more professional management and training.

Really cool art lights hung all over the restaurant and I enjoyed this tremendously. The service was also perfect. Our server, Ruth, was incredibly helpful and knowledgable. She was super cool too. When our lamb chops were not cooked to our desires, she sent it back right away, no questions asked--and then again afterwards when the meat was still not cooked right, she sent over the manager to apologize (who then took care of this entree and a dessert). She felt terrible and even though it was not her fault, she felt sorry about this incident. This impeccable service is out of the norm and very much appreciated.  I would recommend the crab toast, roasted carrot salad, truffle flat bread, and the lamb chops (without the bbq sauce). I cannot stress how good the food, service, and overall experience was.  However, we left the restaurant to retrieve our cars parked at valet (since there is no parking in the Gold Coast), and we were charged $20 bucks a car for 3 hours. That's $40 bucks we had to pay for parking, which ended up being equivalent to the food and dessert that was paid for earlier on. We were shocked that the Pump Room doesn't discount parking or that there isn't a deal through dining at the restaurant. This factor alone will unfortunately not bring me back to Pump Room, unless I am close enough to walk to the restaurant.

We ordered several items including their home made donuts, pancakes, eggs and bacon and for me a turkey club. The food while presented well was mediocre at best though service was good. We also ordered one of their signature drinks ($12) which was good and a mimosa which was not on the menu. The check for this order was around $75 not including parking which they do NOT validate. What was offensive was that charged us $19 for a mimosa which was the most expensive item we ordered but they never told us. We assumed that since their signature dring was $12 then the mimosa would be $10 or so but to charge us $19 for a simple mimosa was offensive and underhanded. When I talked to the manager he simply refused to do anything about it. This place is completely over rated and they have ruined the legacy of the Pump Room.

2012-07-16,4.0,"I've been here twice- once with my husband and another couple for dinner on a Sunday night, and another time with a friend for lunch during the week. Both times I had a really great experience.  First, if you haven't been in the new Pump Room at the Public Hotel, you must go! I have to take a moment to talk about the decor in the bar outside the restaurant, since IMO the entire experience should be reviewed. The bar/restaurant decor is really incredible. Everything is lush and comfortable- dark wood and cream upholstered couches, soft creamy glass balls for chandeliers, beautiful attention to detail. The art in the lobby bar is way fun, and it is so comfy there! Also in the lobby bar there is a large glass table in green milky glass with soft yellow lights that is a business area. And there is a movie/hangout room that is full of huge upholstered couches and chairs, and it makes you want to go in there with a good book and take a nap or just veg out and enjoy it all.  Now the restaurant - same beautiful decor- large round creamy ball chandeliers, tables surrounding the center area that have upholstered couches with pillows, or if you prefer, chairs in the large lower (sunken) center of the dining room.  The menu is eclectic, maybe because the Pump Room is located in a hotel, they strive to have something for everyone. When we were there for dinner, I had the whitefish and it was really fabulous. My husband had the grilled tenderloin and it was excellent. The other couple had the angel hair pasta which was also very good. And we ordered both the salmon and yellow tail appetizers plus the baby spinach and the pretzel-dusted calamari. The sauces for everything were outstanding.  Since we had a veritable smorgasbord in front of us, you would think things might get a little confusing for the waiters. That was not the case for us- everything was served in a timely manner and all the food was cooked to perfection.  We also ordered two bottles of champagne and our waiter was very prompt in refilling our glasses and making sure we had everything we needed.  For dessert we shared the carrot cake, the homemade doughnuts, the warm chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was the best. The doughnuts were not as good as anticipated, and the carrot cake was ok, not incredible.  All in all we had a fabulous experience. And when I went for lunch with my friend, we had the tomato/basil/mozarella flatbread and the croquet madam, both of which were excellent. We also had appetizers (the tuna tartare is incredible) and a bottle of champagne.  As to quantity of food, you don't need to order as much as we did unless you haven't eaten all day. We were just being decadent. You ARE given an assortment of incredibly delicious bread and butter prior to your meal, plus small amuse-bouches at dinner.  All in all I would highly recommend this restaurant as its own experience to be enjoyed especially if you want to arrive early and have a drink or to go to the bar lobby and have a coffee or after dinner drink and spend time socializing. It is also a great place to go if you are looking for an eclectic menu with different choices for everyone and different appetites. I will definitely go back, this is the kind of restaurant you can go to for a special occasion or just for dinner on a week night.

2012-06-28,3.0,"The worth of any restaurant and for that matter any business is how the establishment and its employees handle a situation and their customers when things aren't going as planned. Here is an example of a fine restaurant that fell flat on their face. We had reservations for their Sunday Brunch at 1:30, we were celebrating a special occasion.  We arrived promptly but were told by a nervous and distracted hostess that it would be 10 to 15 minute wait for a table.  OK, we can do that with no problem but we thought it was strange since the dining room appeared about 75% empty.  We thought we'd settled in for some Bloody Mary's and Mojito's at the bar while we waited.  This is where things started to go wrong, we were greeted by the bartender with an apologetic smile.  He explained the point of sale system was down..... period.  I said ""so you're a bartender standing behind a bar and can't make a drink because of the P.O.S. system""?  Honest to God, his answer was ""well I need to get paid"".  I took a deep breath...  then another person in our group politely explained we weren't going to run out on the tab but that we were staying for brunch and wouldn't it be possible to write our order on a piece of paper and transfer it to the dining room to be processed later?  It's like a light bulb went off in his head, he agreed and we got our drinks.    Our 10 to 15 minute waited turned into 20 minutes, remember from the bar we're looking into a nearly empty dining room.  I went back to the host stand and approached the nervous looking hostess, I asked about our table and she did apologized for the wait and also explained they were working on the P.O.S. system, I said ""I know, can we eat ""?  She took us to our table.   Service was a slow (because of the damn P.O.S)  but we all agreed our meals were good.  Will we return, possibly.

The lobby of the hotel is very modern and sleek and the chandeliers, tan leather booths, and wood floors of the bar/restaurant make it a very cool space.  We first had drinks and calamari in the bar. The drinks were awesome (very Violet-hour/Drawing Room-esque) and the calamari was very different with the pretzel crust. My main concerns were with the service at dinner. I found our waitress to be stuffy and condescending when we asked questions about the old Pump Room, and on more than one occasion she actually said things that seemed like she wanted us to feel bad/guilty. She asked if I liked my food because I apparently kept ""picking at it"" (this was awkward and a weird way of asking the question), and complained that she had to bring back the dessert for the birthday girl twice because the first time she was in the ladies' room.  Why even say things like that? Just pretend we didn't know that and help us to have a good time.  My food was average/too lemony (whitefish) but the food of the rest of my group was good (salmon).  All in all, I expected better service for the type of place this is on a special occasion which they knew in advance about. The pictures in the basement of guests at the old Pump Room are cool, but I also wish they would make more of the history known as without the group I was with, I would have known nothing about it.

2012-05-14,5.0,"Although I've lived in Chicago for 10+ years and was at the old Pump Room a handful of times - the original place (blasphemy ahead) really held no special place in my heart as it does for so many others - history shmistory - so I was happy that Ian Schrager redesigned the whole space and that JGV took up residency on the food side of things. Two people whose work I've always enjoyed in NY. We finally made it to the new Pump Room for brunch on Mother's Day. The place was packed as expected, but I loved the layout which unlike a lot of other newer spots popping up these days - you actually have a nice amount of room in between tables. We got a great seat by the window, perfect place to park the stroller, and enjoy a nice relaxing meal. We split the delicious pretzel dusted calamari for an app. The grilled chicken salad I had for my entree was light and scrumptious and Amy loved her ""ham and cheese"" sandwich. We couldn't resist the marshmallow covered chocolate cake for dessert. This, along with a few cocktails was just over $100 - so unexpectedly inexpensive. Our server was really nice, albeit a bit forgetful (as was the hostess who oddly forgot to seat us for 20 minutes even though our table was ready). None of this detracted from our time though - and I'm sure the staff just had ""one of those days"" since Mother's Day can be brutal in restaurants. We used to live 1 block away from here - we're not too far away now, so while this may have easily become a 1+ times a week spot if we were still down the block - I think it will definitely be a regular on the rotation for brunch and dinner.

2012-05-14,2.0,"Ohhhh, where to start! My fiancée and I took my mother here for Mothers Day Brunch yesterday.  When I went on Opentable to make the reservation, over a month ago, all that was showing as avaliable was for 10:30am, usually a little too early for us, but since my mother has been dying to try The Pump Room since I reopened, I took the reservation.  We arrived at 10:35 and when we checked in with the Hostess, we were told they were running about 15 minutes behind, so we were directed to wait in the bar area.  This should have been my 1st indications that thigs were not going to go well, upon looking around, all but 3 tables were open in the restaurant.  We approached the bar only to be informed that they were not serving alcohol until 11am, so we're we're out of Luck there.  After waiting for 25 minutes without being seated, I approached the host stand to inquire when we were going to be sat; the hostess appologized and said that they were extemely busy that days with large parties....I looked around the restaurant, then looked bak at the Hostess and commented that the restaurant was more than 3/4 empty.  Her response was that the large parties were all coming with I the next hour so my response back to her was ""then wouldn't you want to get our 3 top seAting and moving along BEFORE all these large paries arrived?"". To which I received NO response but an empty deer in the headlights stare.  I became quickly apparent that they had no clue what to do.  We were finally seated at 11:05 after waiting in the bar, that didn't serve alcohol, for 30 minutes. Our waiter approached our table with an""Happy mothers day"" and went through some of the things they were offering that day.  We all proceeded to order and about 10 minutes later, our server came back and apologized to my Fiancée, saying that the items she ordered was only on the breakfast menu, not the brunch menu. It turns out that we ALL had been given the breakfast menu instead of the Brunch Menu...another fail by the Hostess.   Once the food arrived, my food and my mothers food came out but my fiancées food, so we sat there waiting, our waiter nowhere in sight....  5 minutes later her food finally arrives, so we ask the food runner if he can bring us Salt, Pepper and jam, which for some reason was never brought to our table. The food was mediocre at best, but then again, if we had been given the correct menus, we may have ordered differently.",0.6671,0.914,0.047,0.039,0.4865079365079365

I said I wanted fish and white wine and so the Pump Room it is.  We arrived around 9:45, starving, after seeing a movie.  We were quickly shown to a table and placed an order.  I had the asparagus and avocado salad and it was delicious.  A perfectly matched combination of avocado, crisp asparagus, sesame seeds, and a few other ingredients I'm forgetting but loved every bite of.  For my entree I had the whitefish with chilies and herbs, also delicious.    As if I wasn't already stuffed I decided to have the sundae for dessert.  Oh my, it was wonderful.  Salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, surrounded by a chocolate sauce and topped with the perfect amount of whipped cream.  Every course was perfect and by the end of the meal I was in love with the Pump Room.  MmmmmMMmmmmm....

But only 1 star for the service. i was excited to try the brunch, JGV has a great reputation and i have enjoyed his NYC establishments.  we started with the donuts and ramp toasts. The donuts were light and sweet, and the chocolate added the appropriate richness. The ramp toasts were delicious, and presented very well, most notably the vibrant green from the ramp pesto. For brunch, I had the croque Madame. OUTSTANDING. The ham was salty, the bread soaked in creamy bechamel, and the gruyere cheese added a nice bite, but it was the sunnyside-up quail eggs that took the dish over the edge into nirvana. the sandwich was served with fresh greens that helped cut down on the richness of the Croque Madame. I also tried the challah french toast, which was very tasty. The service was not what I would expect from an establishment with the superior decor and food achieved by the PUMP ROOM. The waitress could not crack a smile or make a guest feel welcome. we waited for close to 10 minutes before we were greeted or received water. she wasn't helpful in answering questions or providing recommendations. I ordered a ""Passion Chili"" cocktail, which didn't have any heat to it. I mentioned this to the server and she looked puzzled, explaining that it only has a little chili in it. if the name of the drink is ""Passion Chili,"" wouldn't you expect it to have a pronounced amount of chili? she brought me a bloody mary instead, which was very tasty. overall, the food was excellent. the service affected the experience and does not justify the price.",0.9874,0.778,0.17,0.052,0.5909722222222223

One thing that really stood out to me, were all the pictures from the ""good ole times"" of before.  Great black and whites of Chicago socialites, actors, rock stars and beauties.  It was fun to look through them all to see who you recognized and the great styles from before (and how many of them were being repeated today).   The service was OK.  We were running a bit late due to our search for a parking spot, so our table wasn't available when we first got there. We meet our friends who were sitting at the bar.  It took a bit to get the bartenders attention. The drink menu was interesting with lots of fun options but it took a good 10 mins to actually get our drinks. And really, that was the only ""delay"" throughout the night.  Once we were sat, the service was quite good.  Our waitress was prompt, attentive and knowledgable about the menu.  When we re-ordered drinks throughout the evening, they took longer than they should have. The bar was crowded so maybe that was why?  So the food....YUM.  We started with the crab toast with lemon aioli (fresh tasting, the lemon was light but highlighted the crab really well) and beets with homemade yogurt (perfectly roasted and the yogurt was rich without being over powering).  Both were super tasty and made me excited for what was to come with the main meal. The boys both started with salads.  Mike had the pear and apple salad, endive and blue cheese vinaigrette which he really liked.  Our friend Craig, had the boston lettuce and arugula salad, carrot-miso dressing.  He was craving arugula and asked the waitress if there was any way to go heavy on arugula versus the boston lettuce, they happily accommodated. Mike got the tagliatelle, meyer lemon cream, parmesan, black pepper which he said was very rich but had the lightest hint of lemon and Craig got the prosciutto wrapped heritage pork chop, mushrooms, sage. Both Craig and his wife Allison said the pork chop was extremely moist, tasty and not tough at all. Allison got the tagliatelle with caramelized brussels sprouts and pistachio pesto (I was able to get a taste of this, the pasta had the perfect amount of pesto and was really great, also the pasta is homemade so it has a nice flavor) and I got the seared scallops (4 large scallops which were nicely seared on the outside).  The ""simple"" items on the menu didn't have anything else with it, so I ordered a side of the roasted brussels sprouts with pecans and avocados.  The scallops had this almost egg white spicy sauce on the side which added a nice light taste to the flavor of the scallops.  The brussel sprouts were perfectly roasted and delicious.  Everything was really well prepared and yummy. We were all part of the clean plate club lastnight.  We didn't opt for dessert but ended up getting a final drink at the bar.  This was potentially the only saving grace of the bar.  I asked them if they could make a drink for me using some of my favorite things (prosecco and st. germain) with the lavender simple syrup from another drink on the menu, and they made it for Allison and I.  It was the perfect way to end the evening.    Overall, we had a really great experience.  Glad we checked it out.",0.9993,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.6114835164835164

2012-02-23,4.0,"When you visit the Pump Room, you have two considerations to address, which compete against each other as black does white - the scene factor, and the food factor. As a gentleman of a certain age, I am nonplussed by the scenesters who infest this restaurant's bar.  However, I am pleased to report that once you penetrate that platform of preening and plumage, you will be presented with a most rewarding presentation of down home comfort food with a French flair. Indeed, Chef Vongerichten provides immense gustatory pleasure at a surprisingly pleasing price point.  To begin, bread service consists of bread sticks and the customary loaf - the bread sticks, in particular, are superb, as they have a hint of cheese baked within them while remaining crisp and airy.  The wine menu is divided by grape, for New World wines, and then by region, for Old World wines.  He has some very interesting and affordable choices, particularly a delicious St. Joseph priced to steal. For starters we opted for the butternut squash soup and the classic margherita pizza (oh, excuse me, ""flatbread"").  The soup is an extravagantly large portion, and delicious.  Be warned, however, that Chef V loves his ginger, and it penetrates the soup entirely.  The flatbread is a 10 inch personal pizza - there is no reason to apply the misleading ""flatbread"" label, in my opinion - and was delicious, with fresh creamy mozzarella, tomato and basil. For entrees, we had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and the bacon wrapped pork chop.  At this point, I wasn't sure whether I was consuming French haute cuisine or the best offering of KFC, but really, does it matter?  The entrees were superb for either occasion.  The pork chop was juicy and flavorful, and one of the best prosciutto wrapped chops I have ever had.  The fried chicken was juicy with a skin that was just crispy enough without being too crunchy - think one sixtyblue, not Nightwood.  The mashed potatoes were impossibly creamy, entirely free of lumps.  It was, simply, one of the best dinners I've had in quite some time. For dessert, we had the salted caramel ice cream sundae.  It was, in a word, unbelievable.  Creamy and salty in the best way.  While the chocolate cake also looks tempting, DO NOT GET IT.  Go with the caramel sundae; trust me on this. As for the service and decor, the main dining room is pleasantly lit with a gorgeous galaxy of frosted globes that emit a pleasant ambient light.  I find it to be a scene best viewed from the side, off of the dining room, where you are shielded from the noise of the main room and the noise of the bar, and can enjoy your dinner without the need to scream and shout. Service here is impeccable, and the prices are very reasonable for such a hot spot, except, and it pains me to say this, for the bourbon.  My Woodford Reserve was $19 a glass, which is ridiculous, especially compared the cocktail prices, which are $14 per.  Boyd Crowder simply will not stand for that sort of carpetbagging, Mr. Quarles.  You lose one star for that sort of action.  The Pump Room would be well advised to alter their bourbon pricing policies accordingly.",0.9973,0.802,0.161,0.038,0.5785369990633149

2012-02-19,4.0,"A lot of people say that the Pump Room is classic Chicago, but everything about it felt so very New York to me. This kind of grand-scale, dramatic space is usually found in the trendy meatpacking district, but here it is in Chicago, in Ian Schrager's contemporary Public Chicago Hotel. The clientele here on a Saturday night was a mish mash of old (really old) and young, Gold Coasters with fake tans, tourists (hotel guests), and an assortment of other types. At one point I looked around the room and thought where am I? This is such a bizarre crowd. You'd never guess by the outside of the building the amazing space that awaits you inside. Simply put, the lobby and restaurant/bar area are elegant and gorgeous. The lobby has traditional detailing, while the restaurant and lounge are bold and modern. There are several seating areas, the dining room itself with the globe lights, the bar/lounge area with a gold metallic wall backdrop, and another lounge space on the other side of the lobby that has couches and a semi-private room that looked like a Miami club or poolside cabana. I didn't get an old Hollywood rat pack vibe, but I did think that the atmosphere was warm, romantic and inviting. Service was good considering how crowded the place was. Our server came around often to see if we needed more drinks. Good wine and cocktail choices and rather reasonably priced. I had a great tasting Pinot Noir. I did not have a chance to try any of the food, but I would definitely recommend the Pump Room for drinks, it gets four solid stars.",0.9934,0.781,0.189,0.03,0.49042053184910334
2012-02-18,3.0,"I wanted to love The Pump Room. And in a lot of ways, I did. The decor was gorgeous, and the other patrons definitely dressed for the occasion. It's just that the food wasn't the best part, and based on that, I can't go above a three. Our service, though, was definitely five stars: we had two waiters who checked on us often (without being annoying), and we ordered most of our meal based off of their suggestions. The drinks were excellent: I had a spicy, fruity thing, and the hubs had a really refreshing tobacco-infused drink. Bread was yummy, as was the crab toast appetizer. I don't even like crab that much -- was being accommodating -- but I'm so glad we got it. It was really just the entrees that let us down. We ordered and shared the prosciutto-wrapped pork with wild mushrooms and the fried chicken with hot sauce butter and spinach, and added mashed potatoes. The potatoes were great -- I think they floated butter and cream on top -- but the rest was just so, so salty. I wished that the chicken had been bone-in; it just didn't work for me. The pork was nice, but it needed something less rich to cut the salt. The portions were really big -- this was the first time I've ever taken a doggie bag home from a nice place -- and the pork and mushrooms were lovely topped with eggs over English muffins the next morning.",0.9916,0.806,0.172,0.022,0.5587962962962962
2012-02-18,3.0,"THE PROS: The space itself is very lovely.  The lobby is beautiful in way that makes you feel like you stepped into some cross between the future and the past.  And I like how you can kind of walk between the two bars and mingle. The doorman there has to be one of the most courteous doormen I've ever encountered!  Kindly explained to me there was a slight wait and that it shouldn't be too bad and almost seemed to feel bad that he couldn't let me in just yet.  The girl running things at the door was nice as well--ZERO attitude.  How refreshing! A mixed crowd and mixed ages, which I consider a plus.   Music was decent. LOVE that it's not too loud!  You can actually hear yourself and other people talk.  Very rare to come by in a lounge these days. THE CONS: The bartenders act like they are doing you a favor.  The three times I've been here, this has not changed.  They have a pompous air about them like they are saving lives that I could definitely do without and do not appreciate. The drinks:  They're decent enough but, not for $14.  Violet Hour doesn't even charge that and their drinks blow Pump Room's out of the water. They need a late night menu of small bites or something.  We asked around midnight for food and they said the kitchen was closed. I have not eaten here so I can't comment on the food.  All in all, I'd probably drink somewhere else and then come here to hang out.",0.9692,0.879,0.115,0.006,0.5699404761904762

2012-02-14,5.0,"I was totally ""pumped"" after my recent visit to Chicago and the new Pump Room. I am old enough and young enough at heart to remember the original Pump Room. The two can not be compared, but the two of them are/were  at the top of their class.  The ambiance of The Pump Room is ultra modern, chic and swank all at the same time. I normally do not like a restaurant to be so well light, but here at The Pump Room, it added to the experience. The tables and chairs are close together, but there is still enough room to give you comfort and privacy.  I started my experience off with; a Vodka Thyme Lemonade. A totally refreshing  drink made Absolut Citron and house made lemon thyme syrup. This drink was a perfect treat after a busy day of business meetings and I can see enjoying this drink poolside in the summer months ahead.  There was so much on the menu I wanted to try, that I had a hard time narrowing it down. I knew I wanted to end my evening with The Sundae, so I had to plan accordingly. My server, Ruth who was fantastic recommended the Roasted Carrot  & Avocado Salad as an appetizer.  So I took her advice and added a side dish of Roasted Brussels Sprouts to my order. I was giggling to myself, a true meat and potato man was eating like a vegetarian, but I was going to have room for ice cream.  When my salad and ""side"" order of Brussels sprouts arrived, I was shocked by the size of portions. Both were big enough for two to enjoy. The carrots were presented in full size, They were not baby carrots, nor were they diced or shredded. They were big flavorful carrots roasted to perfection. Large slices of fresh avocado and chunchy seeds were mixed with the carrots and topped with sour cream & a citrus vinaigrette. The mixture of texture and flavors had my mouth saying, ""WTF"" and ""OMG"" at the same time.  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts were done with Avocado and Pecans. If my momma made Brussels sprouts like this when I was a child, I would have started my love of these little delicacies much earlier. I remind you again, the portion was large enough for two, but I am glad I had no one with me to share.  I ended my meal with one of the best sundaes I have ever had. The foundation of the sundae was candied peanuts and chocolate sauce with a sprinkling of caramel popcorn that is made fresh daily in the restaurant. It was then topped with one of my favorite ice creams, salted caramel and topped with fresh whipped cream. I was one happy little boy, while I devoured the entire bow. For those few moments, I did not care about my diet.  The wait staff was top notch, I loved Ruth my main server and the assistance from the rest of the team was equally professional and friendly.  I even had the opportunity to meet and talk with the manager, who was making sure his guest were enjoying their meal.  Many of the couples around me were doing Valentines dinner a night early. So I was pleased  that The Pump Room still gave me the attention and excellent service as a single diner. I will be back and I may plan an earlier return to Chicago just so I can visit The Pump Room.",0.9987,0.784,0.186,0.029,0.504746121933622

Our food was really slow, not served all together, and multiple orders were messed up when everything was put together.

I don't know what the space looked like before the remodel, but what they've done with the space is so chic, cool and modern. The ambiance is just great. Our server was awesome!! He took great care of us, and made some great recommendations. We started off with a pre-dinner cocktail, and both were delicious! Try the one with the burnt orange peel! For our starters we had the calamari in a pretzel crust with a spicy marinara, and they were delicious! We also had the shrimp, and those were so tasty! Cooked perfectly and paired with the fried basil leaves gave it such a kick of flavor! For my main, I had the salmon and it was to die for! The black bean vinaigrette was such a great addition to the fish and the bok choy always goes so well with salmon. My date had the beef and he loved it. The meat was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes were so creamy and delicious! The service was impeccable, and we were very well taken care of. I noticed that each table seemed to have their own server, which kept our server focsed on us, which was nice! This restaurant has it all down!

The whitefish was the only 4 star part of the experience. Still good just not great.  A small comped dish of the ravioli was the highlight. The tomato sauce was sublime! Dessert was a comped cheesecake that was done well with sherbet on top instead of fresh fruit. We took up a dessert of donuts and a vanilla sauce up to the room for a late night romantic snack...

As such, I always picked ""rawther"" glamorous restaurants for my birthday dinner (thank you for indulging me, Mom and Dad) with the former Pump Room being one of my favorites.  Recently, I traveled back in time and visited the new Pump Room with a group of friends for dinner and, other than the sad fact that I am no longer on my parent's ""payroll"" and have to pay my own tab (which was not cheap), it was better than ever! The cocktails were a little weak but all of the appetizers and dinner entrees we ordered (calamari, eggplant toast, salt and pepper shrimp, tagilatelle, lobster, salmon, pork chop, and friend chicken) were delicious. The only food item that was a slight disappointment was the dessert...it was fine, just nothing special.  The room is beautiful (albeit a little cold by the hostess stand and coat check) and the service was acceptable (we stayed for hours and, although we weren't tended to on a regular basis, no one complained or rushed us either). By the end of the evening, the bar scene was VERY young and VERY wannabe (not a chic crowd) but lively and fun and that added to the overall vibe and energy of the restaurant. I look forward to both returning to the new Pump Room for dinner and also trying their breakfast and lunch.

I'm totally into egg whites in my drinks right now so this place was my Mecca. I had so many options! The standout was the Pump Room Pisco. It had a ginger finish and was delectable. It was very difficult to pick food - multiple items screamed my name and taunted me with their potential deliciousness. Based on our very well informed server's suggestions, my friend and I went halvsies with the spinach and goat cheese pizza, which was herby and amazing, and the bowtie pasta, done perfectly in an al dente style. The warm apple cobbler rounded out the meal and was easily 1 of at least 8 desserts I would have happily devoured. Nothing was anything less than scrumptious and every bite/sip was too short lived.

It would have been ok if my drink was strong, however I ordered the gin fizz which was DELICIOUS, but I think there was only a splash of alcohol.  Violet Hour prices, but my dearest drink, you ain't no Violet Hour cocktail.  If you are 16 you will love this place because there was no sign of anyone ID'ing anyone, and I'm pretty sure there were a few kids among us all, playing dress up and drinking. There were some very gorgeous people there so we might have to come back just for the scene before it dies, but I'll have to be tipsy first to put up with the mob, and I might have to break out the flask to make sure I am being taken care of since the bar can't seem to do it right.  I'll tell you what, gorgeous people aren't so hot when they are packed like sardines.  I'd work on crowd control, Pump Room.",0.9954,0.755,0.23,0.015,0.6136300897170464

The space itself is very open and decorated excellently. Being such a big place also means there's a lot of people but the crowd makes for great people watching. Everyone's dressed to the nines(suits and dresses) and dolled up. Think Tavern on Rush crowd, but more dressy.

We put in our drink orders and waited 10 minutes before we were told that a large group just sat down and put in drink orders so our drinks were backed up. Its lunch time and the restaurant was maybe half full. Cant imagine what its like during dinner time. After another 15 minutes or so (still no drinks) we were told that they had run out of mix for our drinks. We were given the option of either switching drinks or having a manager go to the basement and get more mix. Didn't really see like we had a real choice there, almost felt like we were inconveniencing them. We put in our appetizer orders and a were served bread while informed that the kitchen is broken so we will not be getting our appetizers. I think the runner was being sarcastic but I highly doubt he would've had that same tone if our party was in their 30s or 40s. (We are in our mid 20s.) Food was fine. Nothing to really rave about. About half way through our lunch, the matre d/manager clearing the next table dropped the plate containing a bowl of oil on my coworker and on my handbag. While apologizing and attempting to clean up, he made jokes that did not make me better and felt a bit patronizing. I know this is an upscale restaurant that tends to have an older crowd, but respect your customers.  When all was said and done, I was surprised we were not offered a dessert on the house or comped meal. My purse still has an oily feel and I left with a bad taste in my mouth.

2011-10-18,2.0,"What a Zoo!!!. We were there last Saturday night at 9:30 and it was already really crowded. By the time we left at midnight we could barely get through the hall to leave. It's a happening place and we were glad we went but cannot see returning.  If you have every been to the Delano in South Beach, Ian Schrager's other place, the Pump Room is very similar. Ultra trendy and hip. There are two bars, the Pump Room itself which is packed and has a dining room and an area on the other side of the hotel lobby called The Library. When we left the place was packed from one end to the other and there were two lines outside to get in.  This was the opening weekend so maybe they just weren't prepared despite having a three week soft opening. It took a long time to get waited on, to get drinks and to pay. Obviously if you have big crowds and can't serve them you aren't making money.  For a place like this the cocktails are pretty reasonably prices, about $12. There is almost no place to sit and what seating does exist is pretty uncomfortable (deep, deep sofas and little stools that look like tree stumps). Maybe I am just to old for this scene. I also hate being told at least four times that the area that we started to sit down in would only be available for $300 bottle service after 10:30.",0.6825,0.868,0.073,0.059,0.462088122605364
2011-10-12,5.0,"As of Oct 11, 2011 the Pump Room inside Public Chicago, formerly Ambassador East, now Public Chicago. Jean-Georges Vongerichten will partner with Ian Schrager to run the revamped historic hotel/restaurant. The restaurant will be inspired by JGV's ABC Kitchen in New York, which just won best new restaurant at the James Beard Awards, yet is ""tailored for Chicago"". The hotel and restaurant have been fully redone with a modern and glamorous look, still keeping the ideals of the famous Ambassador East alive.  The drinks, the food, the atmosphere is crisp and golden. The 12 k gold walls in the bar & private dining area are just like the neighborhood.

2011-10-03,1.0,"Went on Saturday night and will NOT be going back.  When a woman in probably her 60's fell and was lying flat out, eyes closed, in front of the bar and surrounded by many people...not one male attempted to help, the guys next to us were laughing and saying ""buy her a tequila shot!""  When I told the bartender he said, ""I'll tell someone when I see someone, that's all I can do"" and he kept on making martini's.  My friend and one other woman jumped and went over to her and I dialed 911. Another woman did get security, who eventually got her up and into a wheel chair and took her out.  NEVER once did any man in the room who was a guest, look, act concerned or do anything to acknowledge the situation, other than laugh or mock.  AND if she was drunk - well I don't want to hang out where bartenders are more worried about overserving people than helping people they may have overserved or who are just ill...",0.8114,0.826,0.107,0.067,0.34791666666666665
2011-10-02,4.0,"Stopped in here on a Saturday night to check it out and have a drink.  It is a really cool space.  It felt like a mix between Rose bar in NYC, and the Delano in Miami.  It's very open with white walls (the Miami look) but then with a cozy, sit in someone's den and look at artwork in certain parts of the bar sort of feel.  I didn't do much walking around, but I liked what I saw.  It's just nice to have something completely different in Chicago.  I'm sure I'll be back.",0.9337,0.814,0.171,0.015,0.5883597883597883

2011-09-28,4.0,"Stopped in for after work drinks and to check out the reinvented Pump Room! It is BEAUTIFUL! I can see how people can spend hours in there without even realizing it. The dining room is amazing...like something from a dream. The bar area off of the dining room is swanky but comfortable and the bar across the lobby called ""the library"" is warm and inviting.  The drink menu was appealing and the drinks were delicious...the cocktails are $12. In the bar area there was a small plates menu and we had the eggplant crostini (my words, not theirs) and it was DELICIOUS!! That was $6 and worth every penny. My friend had the crab crostini and loved it more than the eggplant..it's their specialty...i believe also $6. We had the olives (a bowl of olives in some sort of orange infused oil) and my friend said she wasnt a huge fan of the orange taste.  The service was great; every single staff member was friendly, inviting and knowledgeable. The one down side was that there were only reservations on  opentable.com  (their host reservation site) for 5:00pm or 9:00 pm but the entire time we were there 6:30-8:30...40% of the tables in the restaurant/bar were ""reserved"" but the patrons never came....I sense a build up for hype. The ""new"" Pump Room is certainly the place to see and be seen...the experience backs up the hype and  I am dying to go back!",0.9943,0.776,0.197,0.027,0.5791657173236121
