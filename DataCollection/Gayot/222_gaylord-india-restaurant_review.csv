Needless to say, three strikes and they're out - we had equally-good or even better food at India House and excellent service, so from now on we'll be taking groups in the mood for Indian there.",0.4854,0.775,0.12,0.104,0.6535087719298247

The service is fairly attentive once you are seated, but the people running the place aren't the most affable.  I would not call them rude, as did another review, but it has been my experience that when you walk in you are met with blank stares and a seemingly apathetic attitude toward the fact that you have arrived.  Perhaps a cultural thing, or they expect the business suit crowd (of which I am not a member)....  After lunch there, today, my lunch companion left his hat at his seat and the server was at the door with it as we were walking away from the restaurant, so they are paying attention.

Which leads me to the one issue I had with the place - the food was so unbearably hot, I was literally sweating when eating it. It got to the point where I couldn't even eat it anymore, even though I was chugging water and stuffing my face with naan to try and kill the burn. The two entrees we got, something with lamb and chicken vindaloo, had no indication on the menu that they were so spicy. I'm not really affected by super hot food either, so it's not like I have sensitive taste buds. My recommendation is to double check with the server when you order, if you're getting something new, just to make sure it's not too hot. Besides the insane overkill on the spicy-ness, the food was awesome.",0.9355,0.787,0.146,0.067,0.6993827160493828

This is one of those places where I eat until I can't eat anymore. The lunch buffet is great - unlimited trips to the buffet for around $12...so the price is also reasonable. Now, why it's getting a 3 star review... The wait staff at Gaylord's is UNBELIEVABLY rude. Several times I have walked in and they have looked at me and walked away. It takes forever to get seated. They have also tried to take away my plate before I was finished with it. In general, their body language and manner are really poor and they are consistently rude. They give you that look, ""Can you just finish so the next person can come in?"" If this was, oh, I don't know, McDonald's, I could understand that mentality. IT'S A FREAKIN' sit down restaurant!

The chicken curry was smooth and flavorful, and there are actually hard-boiled egg halves in the sauce! So good. The only thing that I would have really liked would have been some good green mint chutney that we usually have at other Indian restaurants. The only thing that they said was ""mint chutney"" was a white yogurt based sauce with some mint in it. Not what I was expecting. Also I wish there had been a couple more chicken dishes to choose from - like Chicken Tikka Masala. Their desserts - WOW! One of the most flavorful rice puddings I have had, and their little round donuts were also very good.

The chicken was AMAZING...full of flavor, grilled to perfection, and so tender. The cheese naan was served up hot and the taste...tremendous. In the spirit of the holiday, we topped off our meals with the Gaylord Special--a mango and vodka concoction that went down smooth and fruity. I gave this place 3 stars because the service was SLOW. Not only that, but the waitstaff kept trying to take away all of our dishes before we'd even finished. And when I was waiting for my friends (who were majorly late), the management kept bugging me and asking me what party I was part of (even though I'd told them twice that they were late).

Perhaps, everyone in this very quiet, very authentic restaurant knew it.  Or perhaps, it was just my imagination.  Don't expect the waitstaff to welcome you with open arms into this Saag/Nan/Tandoori Paradise, however, the host at the door reminded us on our way out that ""free soda"" was included in the buffet.  Good to know for next time.  When you don't know quite what you like, the buffet is the way to go- it's your passport to food adventure.    Everything is delicious even when we didn't know what we were eating.  I know- read the signs- but it's much more fun to pick by color and texture.  A taste bud surprise.  $25 for two people for the Sunday lunch buffet.  I feel a sequel coming on!",0.9569,0.852,0.132,0.016,0.5621794871794873
