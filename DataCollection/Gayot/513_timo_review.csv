2007-12-31,1.0,"I can't say I'm surprised this place is closing. I have read some pretty terrible reviews on other sites, and I'm beginning to understand. As much as I would like to fully review this establishment, I will not have the opportunity to do so. I was really looking forward to dining at John Bubala's restaurant, and was even more excited to do so on New Years Eve, their last night of operation. I was excited that I was able to make reservations only a couple of weeks in advance and planned my New Years Eve accordingly. About a week before the date, I received an email containing the menu and requesting a credit card number. A couple of days later I sent in the info. New Years Eve day rolls around and I have heard nothing from the restaurant in the way of a final confirmation, so I call to ensure that all is well. It isn't. Apparently when I made my reservation, I was not actually reserving anything, which would have been nice to know at the time. That email I received, that was pretty time sensitive as it turns out. What they were doing is accepting every reservation that anyone made, and then it was a race to see who returned their CC# first. The people who got the numbers in first got a table. The rest of us were out of luck for NYE, and they didn't even have any intention of letting us know. I accept my responsibility in this, there was fine print in the email saying that CC #s confirm the reservation, but... A. No one mentioned anything like that when I made the reservation. When I got off the phone, I was definitely under the impression I had reserved a table for two. No mention of needing credit card numbers was made. B. If you are going to make it a foot race for NYE tables, send the email in a timely manner, not days after the initial phone call. C. If you can't honor the reservation, at least have the decency to let people know. Had it not been for my nagging desire for some confirmation, we'd have shown up for our reservation and then been completely screwed. Thank you Timo for leaving us hanging on NYE. While I wish I had gotten the chance to experience the food, something tells me it's better if you just fade away.",0.9866,0.814,0.138,0.048,0.5348989898989899
2007-09-23,3.0,"Prosciutto, flighty waitress, onions, cheap pours. Yesterday evening we had dinner in Timo's excellent outdoor dining area.  (Who knew?)  All in all it was okay, but for the money I would go elsewhere. We started with the shrimp appetizer.  It had vanilla bean extract in the sauce and was delicious.  I had the beet salad, which was also pretty good.  For my entree I had one of the specials, veggie lasagna.  Goat cheese, vegetables, pasta, mushroom cream sauce?  Pretty freaking good.  My boyfriend had the Penne pasta which was actually kind of gross.  Lots of prosciutto and onions, not much flavor.  One of the other people in the group had the tenderloin tail and said it was excellent.  In my opinion all three desserts we tried were weak and a waste. As I mentioned, the outdoor area is really nice.  They had fun pieces of artwork up that children had created from Gallery 37.  The windows, I have always enjoyed.  When you walk through the restaurant you can take a gander at some pig legs...  Various prosciuttos.  Gross.  This place always seems empty when I drive by, and even last night it was. Our server was pretty flighty and made us uncomfortable.  She tried, she was  just weird. The drinks were weak.  The Maccallen and Maker's pours were laughable... if you are giving a tiny pour - get a tiny glass.  I just had coffee as I was nursing a hangover.  Coffee was decent.  Someone else in the group got a French Martini/Flirtini... whatever they called it... That was pretty weak too. All in all my meal was tasty and my company was excellent.. I just feel it was not worth the money and I would not be interested in returning.",0.9651,0.712,0.167,0.12,0.6106481481481482
2007-08-24,4.0,"Our group of four went to Timo on an early Wednesday evening right after they opened. The place was empty. We sat outside on the patio and it was absolutely gorgeous. It's probably one of the best outdoor spaces in the city. (Apparently they only serve full service dinner out there - we were there for drinks and light food, but they let us stay because it was early.) The inside was funky and warm, but I wasn't a fan of the meat on display. We ordered a few martinis, all off of their speciality menu (which isn't a printed ""menu"" but the waiter's mental list), and all of them were good. As for the food, we started with the risotto with sausage and gouda  and the pear ravioli with corn and pea relish. The risotto was amazing - perfectly cooked and very creamy. (Our friends had tried another variation of risotto previously and enjoyed it.) The ravioli was decent. I thought the pear taste was a little too sweet and the peas were undercooked. We were still hungry and reeling from the drinks, so we ordered the scallop dinner with corn and peas. I was disappointed by the repeat of the relish because it's so distinctive. The scallops were tasty and very tender. I would definitely go back for the risotto and drinks. Something prevents me from giving this place five stars... it was either the waiter's weird attitude or the disappointing ravioli. This is not a restaurant I would take children to and I imagine the staff wouldn't handle them well.",0.983,0.79,0.149,0.061,0.5221088435374149
2007-07-27,5.0,"I love dining on the beautiful outdoor patio here!  I first visited a few years ago when it was Thyme and said that I could see having my wedding here...now, years later, this is where my boyfriend and I are getting married.  Obviously, I'm a huge fan of this place! The service is very friendly, accomodating, and doesn't rush to turn over tables.  The wine list is interesting (in a very good way) and has few selections that I rarely see at restaurants.  And the food...the food is incredible!  We've been here a couple of times now and the shrimp appetizer is a standout.  My boyfriend is a huge fan of the pork loin entree and I love their pastas.  All of the ingredients taste so fresh.  And the banana crepes are something that I crave for days!",0.9873,0.765,0.235,0.0,0.5633333333333334
2007-07-23,4.0,"What a cool place!  I came here last week for a work event and our company rented out their private dining area.  It was super cute and very private- separate entrance, bathroom, bar, etc...  The staff was very friendly and seemed extremely accommodating to our group of ~35.  The food was delicious- from my caprese salad to the skirt steak served rare and perfectly tender to the chocolate crepes (possibly my favorite thing in the world). Next time I go back, I will make sure it is still summer time because they have a ""not to be missed"" outdoor patio to dine on!",0.9806,0.756,0.244,0.0,0.6456481481481482
2007-06-20,5.0,"It was expensive, after we included 3 bottles of wine.  But the food was well worth it.  The outdoor dining area moved this up from 4 stars to 5. The italian influence wasn't an overwhelming theme.  Overall the food was excellent as was the service.  It is always nice when the waitstaff suggests a cheaper bottle of wine than what you originally asked about.  We loved the shrimp appetizer and fish dishes on the menu Friday 6/15.",0.9246,0.827,0.173,0.0,0.5944444444444444
2007-06-18,3.0,"I am extremely torn on my review of Timo's.  I give it 3.5 stars, but I am tempted to give it 4.  But I just cannot bring myself to do so.  Here's why... We went to Timo's on Sunday for and early Father's Day meal.  We had 2 kids with us, so we went right when the kitchen opened.  The place was really uniquely decorated.  It was warm and cozy on the inside, but the best part about Timo's is by far the outdoor dining area.  It is large and spacious with beautiful lush greenery surrounding the entire area.  My nephew kept asking if he could go play in the flowers.  It is complimented with beautiful lights of different shapes and colors throughout the patio area.  This alone is a great reason to come to Timo's on a summer evening. The food was really quite middle of the road.  We started off with the parmesan shrimp, gazpacho soup with shrimp and guacamole, and a couple orders of the tomato mozzarella salad for appetizers.  The shrimp was under seasoned and quite bland.  The gazpacho was tasty, but one piece of shrimp really is not sufficient.  The tomato mozzarella salad was served with just a few grape tomatoes, which was extremely run of the mill.  It was tiny~ Each night of the week, the chef has a special ravioli.  I love ravioli, so I chose the special, which was four cheese ravioli with corn and pea relish.  It was pretty good, although not as warm as I wanted it.  Salmon with roasted red peppers was another special which 2 people at our table ordered and loved.  My dad got the pork tenderloin, which he raved about and was happy that his portion was more generous that everyone else at the table.  Both of my brothers ordered the scallops, and they received a so-so review.   For dessert, I had the Crme Brule Trio, which I thought was very good.  Pear crepes received an ""ok"" review and the banana and chocolate crepes were described as ""pretty good.""  I was a little disappointed with the food, bottom line.  I expected more for the price, and just in general.  I thought everything was just a little bland.  The atmosphere was lovely and makes me want to go back if nothing else for a great evening outdoors.  Our server was nice, attentive and very knowledgeable and the staff was quick to refill our glasses or take away dishes when we were finished.   Oh, and one more thing.  There were about 5 cars in the parking lot, which we parked in ourselves.  We were still charged $10 for valet which I thought was just plain lame.",0.9983,0.778,0.193,0.03,0.5955887445887447
2007-06-18,4.0,"Four stars overall, mostly for the food and also for the outdoor dining, which is among the best in the city that I've experienced.  If you go, be sure to make reservations for the patio ahead of time.  The $25 fixed-price menu is only available in the winter months, and the slightly pricey menu would keep Timo from being my weekly go-to place, but VERY NICE for special occasions and celebrations.  The shrimp appetizer was a big hit at our table, as was the tomato-mozzarella salad (cherry tomatoes and mini buffalo mozzarella balls, yum).  The scallops melt in your mouth.  I highly recommend Timo!",0.9662,0.833,0.167,0.0,0.5305820105820106
2007-04-28,5.0,"Delicious. Amazing food. Plus they have high chairs, though the hostess gave us a ton of attitude. And the valet parking is a ripoff, since the valet just parks your car in their enormous parking lot. PS - No changing tables, of course.",0.743,0.792,0.161,0.047,0.835
2007-03-16,4.0,"YUM... I've been meaning to get here for quite some time now, and it was fantastic.  They have a great three-course prix fix menu from Sunday - Thursday for $25.  What a great deal!  Ambiance is nice - I was with a large group of people, but the restaurant could be good for a casual date night as well.  Our service was great too. I had the beet salad with candied walnuts, cherries, gorgonzola, arugula and peaches - the beets were a bit bland, but blended well with the rest of the ingredients.  Candied walnuts and cherries were fantastic with the gorgonzola.  For the main course, I had the butternut squash ravioli - it was delicious.  So sweet and buttery, in w savory cream sauce.  For dessert, I went with the roasted pear crepes... not the best, but still pretty yummy. I think the prices are a little expensive for what you get, but I'll definitely be back.",0.9939,0.685,0.29,0.025,0.6812169312169313
2007-02-07,4.0,"heh. Apparently Jenn ate @ Timo within days after us in Jan. Dining room was near empty, ditto to the praking lot.  The (winter) menu was fluffed with ominpresent risotto and butternut squash cooked in every form. No harm no foul as the butternut squash ravioli was indeed excellent. For apps, everyone jumped on the shrimp which was, overcooked and underflavored. The tasty gnocchi + risotto were topped with interesting items (pear on risotto? SURE!); the risotto set aside one diner's year long lousy-risotto-phobia. Between the 8 of us, we ran amuck with the menu, selecting everything for the main course. Hands down, the goat cheese ravioli was the tastiest. Hanger steaks were all done correctedly, but seemed bit irrelevant on this Italian-inflected menu. My lamb was tender and totally edible yet also irrelevant on the menu. Finally, the ladies loved both the creme brulee trio and the chocolate gateau for desserts. The upside down/inside out apple ""tart"" was interesting but along with other desserted, demonstrated the weak side of Timo is in the pastry chef... There were decent amount of affordable reds available by the glass hence everyone had complete meals for ~$40. Server was attentive, not overbearing, helpful in suggestions, honest with recs yet unpushy. The dark colored room was a warming contrast to the weather. Dig this place. Will come back when the summer menu arrives. I just can't do risotto/gnocchi/butternut squash on a regular basis.",0.8291,0.864,0.077,0.059,0.5781880341880342
2007-01-22,4.0,"I love eating out in January in this city-- dining rooms are empty, servers aren't hassled, the food leans toward comfort, and the prices are often geared to get folks out of hibernation and in through the door. Timo (the restaurant formerly known as Thyme) has recently rebranded after Chef Bubula spent some time (unavoidable pun) in Italy-- the restaurant switched gears and now focuses on wood-fired and rotisserie meats and seasonal dishes with Italian style. The menu closely resembles that of the now MIA Thyme Cafe (yelp, Centerstage and others say its closed for good, their website and phone message suggest otherwise)-- a dozen or so selections in the appetizer and entree categories and the option to practically make money by ordering the three course fixed price for a mere $25.  At Timo, this option is only available Sunday through Thursday, which, frankly, means you have absolutely no reason to go to Timo any day other than Sunday through Thursday.  The prix-fixe does not limit your selections, so go ahead and get the tenderloin or the planked salmon.  I greatly enjoyed the romaine salad (which saw a little time on that wood-fire, giving it a wonderfully smokey flavor) and the roasted chicken and mushroom risotto (the perfect antidote for a 20 degree night-- served in a comfortingly shaped deep, cereal-style bowl, I just wanted to hug it to my chest and eat it with a spoon.  I did eat it with the spoon, but left the bowl on the table like a good girl...) The money you save can then be applied to the wine list, which is compact and offers a little something for everyone (not always a great thing, though).  There's a good selection of by-the-glassers for those of us who like to start with a little something.  I greatly enjoyed two glasses of Trebbiano before our main course selection--a fine little Rioja with plenty of juice to work with the roasty toasty smokey flavors in the food. The dessert menu was a little rickety.  There were some good looking options, but the chef's drink pairings dissuaded me more than they encouraged me (and made me wonder if he's getting kickbacks from Bailey's-- multiple appearances of the liquor including the truly scary Bailey's Caramel...).  I have, on multiple occasions, enjoyed the cheese plate at Thyme Cafe, but apparently cheese doesn't go over so well in River North.  The server seemed aggrieved to tell us that despite his love of cheese and the chef's love of cheese, they no longer serve cheese.  Too bad.  To console ourselves, we had the decidedly un-Italian creme brulee trio and loved it death with double espressos. One less than stellar thing:  the bathrooms are so below par, I can't even explain it all away--it's as if they were designed by someone who had never stepped foot in the restaurant.  Glossy black and hunter green tiles, smeary-looking Gauguinesque murals, heavy fruity potpourri in World Market style baskets.  I felt as if I were in the restroom of a college-town coffeehouse run by crazy artsy drop-out types.  Very very bad and for no discernible reason. If you're a normal person, though, you don't spend much time in restrooms and won't let the horrificness of this particular decorating scheme get in the way of  enjoying one of the tastiest best-deals in the city.",0.9957,0.797,0.147,0.056,0.48136363636363644
