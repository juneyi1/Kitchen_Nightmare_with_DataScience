We got there at around 2pm and we were out by 2:20. We asked the unfriendly hostess when we had to be out the door and she said 3pm, though when we sat down we were told by the server that it would have to be by 2:30. The place was almost empty already, with just a couple of tables finishing their meal. We should have known better than going into a place that dead on a Sunday at brunch time in the Southport corridor. Our bad.  We were still working on our rushed meal when our server and another person we hadn't seen till then came to our table ready to take our plates away and with the check, literally 15 mins after we had sat down.  A plus, the hostess did us the ""huge favor"" of allowing us to get the stroller inside the empty restaurant, next to our table.  This is the second try we give this place, and the last one.

In terms of recommendations - steak frites, fish tacos, benedicts and the breakfast burrito (but add cheese). Their fish special is typically good and their desserts are really good.

The waiter was attentive, informative, honest about the menu and also quite funny. The waitress who was working with him was also fantastic. If I could give them 5 stars for their service, I would. The food, however, was another story. It was unimpressive. We started with a bottle of pino noir and their complimentary bread which was dry and had a bad texture. We then had the mussels (which was a large portion for sharing) which were okay and the Brussels sprouts which were mushy and cold. The cauliflower came out next and was also just okay but no one would order them again. Then followed the snapper dish which was burned and no one liked the flavoring & we left half of it on the plate. The meatloaf came next which was very dry/overlooked and also cold.

I went here with my roommate late on a Monday evening; we were the only two diners in the entire establishment. I only mention that because it makes the 45-minute wait time for quite simple dishes all the more ridiculous. I ordered the Amish Chicken and my roommate ordered the tomato bisque soup and the quinoa/vegetable salad. My chicken wasn't bad, per se, but it was totally forgettable and really lacking in any unique flavor. I still ate some of it, as I was so hungry after waiting for 45 minutes that I was ready to start eating the table cloth to satisfy my hunger.  The server got my roommate's order wrong the first time. We attempted informing him of this, but he never returned to our table to even check in on us until we were finished with the meal. When her salad arrived, we were confused if it was actually the soup in modest disguise, as the veggies and quinoa were completely submerged in oil.

I'd recommend a rez (OpenTable) because it sure fills up quickly if there's a show playing next door. It was cacophonous once full! Had an essentially vegan meal here of small plates including: Beet Salad ($7.5), a subtle but tasty dish of  roasted fennel, sliced radishes, watercress & lime-agave nectar yogurt Crispy Rosemary Polenta Cakes ($8), the star dish of the night: crispy and chewy, slightly oily polenta cakes with a rich romesco (red pepper) sauce as well as sundried tomato-walnut tapenade, roasted mushroom ragout and arugula Broccoli with Almonds ($6.5) Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($8): (minus Nueske's bacon) crimini mushrooms, red bell peppers, garlic & yuzu-nampla vinaigrette --------------- Now all that didn't add up to too much dough but enter drinks. I had a Tarragon Royale ($10) served in a champagne flute. It's vodka, tarragon syrup, bubbly and lime I believe. Very tasty but served not too cold. I very nicely mentioned something about drink temps (guest's 3 glasses of Hall sauvignon blanc, $11, was also not too chilled) to our very nice server Anna...I really wasn't fishing for freebies, maybe just some ice cubes...but Anna brought me another. Funny thing is second one was about same temp. Oh well, free drink. I finished din-din with a $7 Domaine DuPage. So Deleece was a pleasant experience overall.

I mean, we had 3 kids with us, one of whom is an infant. Ok.. whatever.. Then after a good long wait, our totally bored seeming and VERY slow moving waiter ambles over to say hello. We order drinks... wait 5 minutes...get 3 of the four drinks and he wanders off.... wait 10 minutes.. We flag him over he is leaning on bar chatting with a waitress) to order our food and I request missing drinks.

We get them, but no cream for the coffee, another five minutes until I can flag him to ask for crew. He forgets it.. I ask again... It was not even busy in there.  He never checked on us, never refilled our drinks, never checked to see if we were ok.  Meanwhile, the host has been talking on the phone on a bar stool in the corner behind the host desk,  the entire time we were there and at one piont talking on her cell in the lobby near the theatre entrance, twice making guests who came in wait for her to seat them. At one point we dropped something on the floor, she was walking by and looked at it, hesitated as if she was about to pick it up, but then just left it there as I was beginning to rise to get it. Ugh.. We then waited 15 minutes for the check after or food was cleared and already had the kids wrapped up in their coats. Not one person said goodbye or thank you to us as we left.

I know they're always busy, but had never been inside. The decor is nice and it gives off a great vibe.  The main problem is the service. There was one server taking care of all the tables. He was running around a bit frantic, but on top of him taking care of too many tables he literally put in zero effort. He talked then walked away multiple times without letting myself or my wife ask questions. He did this to other tables too. Many of the tables were frustrated. He would literally be walking away when talking about the specials. That's very annoying when we have very few nights to get out and have to pay for a babysitter.  The food itself was OK, but really could have been much better. My lobster roll had good flavor, but was a little light on the meat. My wife's ahi tuna tacos had literally one small slice of tuna on each of the three tacos. They also neglected to drain the water from the slaw, so it was very runny with the taco. The best part of the meal was the truffle fries, but would have been much better if served with an aioli.  On top of everything my wife's glass of wine had a very light poor. If you read my reviews I rarely complain about portions, but for an upsold $11 glass to be so small it was bad. Naturally when I asked the server started walking away we were told it was a standard 5oz pour. Needless to say we will not be coming back.

The person who seated us (didn't catch his name, bearded guy) and took our order behaved in extremely rude and disrespectful manner. His attitude was disgusting! While taking our order itself, he was looking so annoyed for no reason!

2015-01-01,1.0,"Went here for our nye dinner and I'm not sure if it was an off night or what but my wife and I were very disappointed.  We had the tuna tartare and the calamari to start, the tuna was decent but pretty bland the calamari was super basic and was drizzled with some boring white sauce.  I had the duck and she had the salmon..  The waiter asked how i wanted the duck cooked and I said I differ to the chef (which was a mistake because it came out raw), I would've sent it back but the waiter never came back to ask me about it.  The skin wasn't crispy and only about half was edible.  My wife's salmon was ok (extremely mediocre) but again very boring and plain.  We ordered a side of brussel sprouts which came with very little seasoning and tossed with some red and yellow peppers.  BOOOORRRRING!  Again I would've asked for some salt and pepper if our waiter was around.  I know it's New Year's Eve but the restaurant was only about half full and not very crazy.  Too bad because we only live a couple blocks away but I honestly would've rather ate at one of the neighboring bars and spent my $200 on something else.  So bland so boring will not be returning to deleece anytime soon.  Definitely needs some creativity and some seasoning on the food!",0.5183,0.799,0.103,0.098,0.5780712751300987

2014-09-12,5.0,"Deleece is truly a phenomenal restaurant in the Southport Corridor in the Lakeview neighborhood. It's been a long-standing restaurant well-known on the north side of the city for many, many years and their newer location adjacent to the Mercury Theater (currently showing Avenue Q!) is outstanding--light and modern with a beautiful bar and exposed brick walls. Over the years I've tried everything from the signature salmon with black rice (yum!) to the mussels, calamari, and crab cakes--and all are excellent and with creative presentations. I'm from Maryland and VERY, VERY picky about my crab cakes. Deleece's are authentic and made with actual LUMP crab...the best I've had outside of my home city of Baltimore (and I've had some lousy crab cakes in the Midwest!)! I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu at Deleece.   Perhaps an unexpectedly EXCELLENT aspect of Deleece is the bar area, and their wonderful, gregarious bartender Anthony has created a cocktail menu completely in line with the increasingly popular craft cocktail/martini trends today. All of Anthony's mixes and elixirs are house-made and incredibly creative--not to mention delicious! My favorite martini at Deleece is the Understudy. You must try it (I posted a photo)! The bar area alone is a great place to stop before or after a show at the adjacent Mercury Theater, and they'll even make to-go cocktails to bring right into the theater. It's perfect!  I'm even more of a fan of Deleece now than I was years ago, and this is one of my go-to spots in the city for always excellent food and drinks.

2014-06-23,3.0,"I am torn about this place. The food was very good, bordering on excellent. But the decor and the prices kinda don't do it for me... Went on a Wednesday night around 7pm and the place was packed with people going to the show at the Mercury Theater. My bad - didn't think to make a reservation on a Wednesday but we were seated so off to a good start. Had a whiskey old fashioned and a glass of red for the wife. The cocktail did not mess around with bacon infused vodka and maple simple syrup. Nice. Started with the Brussels sprout salad with had roasted pepper strips and what appeared to be back bacon. Excellent. For dinner the wife had the burger (very good) and I had the Halibut fish special. it was good.  Here's where I think things got a bit off for me.  First the place seems to be a theater crowd kinda place. At 7:30, the place emptied out. It was so weird. At 7 not a table to be had. At 7:30, poof. You are alone. Second is the location of the front door goes right out into the theater lobby. Not too attractive seeing floor mats and crowd of people milling around. Finally the prices are a bit much for Southport. My fish was $33. Holy heck! The burger was $16. Cocktails were more reasonable at $10 - $11 so OK there. But for those prices, I'm wanting a bit more ambiance. Overall, a nice place. Food and service are 4 stars but I just can't get past the value / decor issue which I give 2 stars, hence my average of 3 stars for this place.",0.9895,0.81,0.153,0.037,0.5361822660098523
2014-06-13,2.0,"Firstly, the service was excellent. Our server, who was very busy, was very attentive even though she had way too many tables (perhaps hire another server)... the food was just ok, and for the high prices, I was expecting better. We got fried olives to start, which were just alright, not sure how much more flavor you get by frying an olive? And then I ordered the red snapper special which said it would be served with a ""tomato cream sauce"" which I never tasted. The fish was about 4 inches thick, and look like it was smothered with a twice baked potato, so that threw me off. Red snapper is my favorite fish and I have never seen it served this thick, kind of grossed me out. My husband got a lobster roll which shockingly didn't have that much flavor and looked unappealing. The fries were average and not crispy at all. My white wine I ordered (a sauvignon blanc from Chile) was way too acidic to pair with food. I think overall there needs to be more refinement with this food, for this high price I would not return.

First the goods -- the patio is big and not overcrowded (brunch convos with my group of friends are not meant for tiny ears!) and the food was a good mix of the usuals (pancakes, eggs Benedict) and more unique brunch creations and, seeing one of the cons as a positive since I believe in the silver lining after all, they don't make you feel rushed to leave! But the bads...umm, we Wanted to leave and couldn't because our server never brought the check, then when she did she didn't come back for it foreeeever. And then she did what smart servers would never do -- gave a $10 bill and a $5 bill as the change.. No singles. Well, you aren't getting 10 for crappy service, so I guess 5 it is! There were also coffee grounds in the coffee and the mimosas didn't seem to have much bubble to them. Good coffee and heavy champagne pours = return customers and good tips!

His starter was the Calamari which he declared was some of the best he had Ever eaten. Lightly battered & crispy. I decided since the menu was not run of the mill I would choose two starters, the Cheese Plate which had a delightful assortment of three cheeses with an assortment of dried fruit & nuts, honey & fig preserves. I loved it, one of the cheeses was Maytag Bleu cheese so good. Second, he Crab Cakes! Simply, prefect. Enough filler to hold them together but mostly, Lots of crab. Two & pretty big size. They were fall apart tender. And last I had to try the Arugula salad. At $8, this is indeed a bargain. There was a white Balsamic dressing that had honey marinated figs, more of the Maytag  Bleu cheese & pistachios!  It was one of the best either have had, unusual & very distinctive.

Me and two of my girlfriends decided to share some small plates, so we started with some soup and the roasted pear and gouda tart. The soup special (Moroccan lentil) was by far the stand out of the night, the tart, not so much. Between the 3 of us, we couldn't stomach to finish the one little tart... The tart is described with spaghetti squash, gouda cheese, caramelized onion, walnuts & balsamic syrup. No gouda cheese or caramelized onions were to be found, and the balsamic syrup was literally glued/melted onto the plate. It was basically a pear tart with some dried spaghetti squash in the middle.  We then each decided to get our own salad (beet, cous cous and arugula) and split an order of the vegetable risotto. I absolutely LOVE beets and fennel and could not eat more than two bites of the beet salad, one of my friends spit out her one bite, and my other friend refused to even try it. It was completely flavorless; the fennel was cooked to the point where you couldn't even tell what it was anymore and there was absolutely NO seasoning. That was not roasted fennel; more like boiled to point of oblivion. The ""watercress"" was 2 little leaves, and the lime-agave nectar yogurt was flavorless as well.  My friends each thought their respective salads were decent, but again, wished that there was a little more on the plate, especially for $8. The vegetable risotto was okay, but again, wasn't exactly as described. It seems that they put whatever vegetables they have on hand into it.  Our service was also lacking a lot. It took about 15 minutes for us to get our server's attention to order our soup, and trust me, the place was not crowded at all. He also never checked on us once to see how we liked anything.

2014-04-06,4.0,Great place good service. I hadn't been in years (before they moved) and popped in for a quick dinner a couple of weeks ago. I ended up ordering three appetizers instead of an entree and all were spot on. Yesterday I found myself in the neighborhood again and decided to have some lunch. I went for the ahi tuna tacos and side salad and they are probably some of the best tuna tacos I've ever had (save for some place in San Diego I can't remember from years past)... Anyway salad was great too. Might seem like a basic review but the last thing I'll say is the thing that impressed me most was everything tasted so fresh.

2014-03-28,4.0,This place was great. Limited but expertly crafted dishes. Had an interesting  appetizer ; breaded and deep fried olives. Very unique and filling with a dipping sauce. Also had calamari cooked perfectly. Tender with crunchy coating. The Berkshire pork chop with reduction sauce was cooked as requested. (Well done  even though this usually bugs chefs) other family members had salmon which I tasted and was cooked perfectly on a bed of spinach with black rice. Seasoned well. Also ordered the lobster roll and wagu burger. Had small taste and also very good. Some nice specialty cocktails ( a bit small for price ) but good. Will go back in spite of bad parking in the area.

After about 30 minutes of waiting, it was apparent that the kitchen was producing the food very slowly. Other tables around us were inquiring about their food. Our waitress did not check in with us once through out the entire hour we waited for our food. Finally, I asked a random server to speak to a manager. No one came and in about ten minutes, our food came out. After we finished the meal, I asked our server to speak to the manager. This is a small place and we could tell that the manager knew we wanted to speak to her. She avoided it and finally came over with small, complimentary desserts. She informed us that they were down one person in the kitchen. As someone who works in the restaurant business, I understand that these things happen. However, she said that our bad experience was ""not her fault,"" and that there was nothing she could do about it to help. I understand what she was trying to say, but updates would have been appreciated and she surely could have come talk to us sooner. She could have done many things to make our experience and wait for our food better, and did nothing. The waitress also did not give enough attention to our table and gave the minimum effort. The food was okay, but not worth the price.

It took a long time to get our meals- so long that the wait staff came by to apologize and say that the meals would be out soon. Everyone in our party stated that their meal was ""just okay"". The menu is overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. One friend could not eat the chicken because it was so dry and the vegetables barely cooked.

Not at all the case!  In fact, I really liked it and if I lived in the neighborhood, dare I say I'd actually return!  Here's the skinny on food. Despite seeing multiple complaints on the filet I went out on a limb and ordered it anyways. The verdict? Delish! It had a nice char, was cooked to perfection, had the yummiest sauce, and tastiest vegetables on the side. It was the perfect portion. I don't usually order filet but I certainly did not regret. My husband ordered cous cous salad and raw hamachi which he said was very good. He also ordered the baked Alaska for a dessert which tasted like it was made with fresh mint. A modern twist on a classic. As for drinks, they were quite good though I had to admit I laughed when I saw ice in my martini as several others have noted.

We had a reservation for 6, but had to call because we were running late, and they nicely pushed it back for us.  We were immediately seated.  Our server was very thorough in her description of the specials.   The restaurant is in a former storefront.  It's a cute atmosphere, but poorly executed.  We were seated against the wall (booth + little table and a chair).  He had the heater blowing straight on him (no wonder our candle couldn't stay lit).  We asked if we could move, but apparently they couldn't seat us elsewhere, so our server said she'd turn off the blowers.  (About 20 minutes later, though, they were back on and blowing full heat onto us, making us both sweaty!).  I had a light shining right on me in my booth seat, as did other patrons seated in the booths.  Felt like the spotlight was on me - literally. Awkwarrrrdddd! We ordered the Vegetable Risotto to share as a starter.  To me, it was lacking in flavor - needed salt!  It was pretty good (albeit on the gummy side) but not outstanding. He ordered the Amish Half Chicken ($17) and I had the Shrimp + Truffle Linguine (19).  He really enjoyed his chicken, but it was mostly just that, with a few little vegetables underneath. If he were to order it again, I'd think he'd want a vegetable side to go along with it.  My Linguine was just OK - nothing fantastic.  I felt like it's something I could easily replicate at home.  I didn't taste any truffle or chili to tell you the truth.  Meh.  My date did enjoy the crushed tomatoes in my dish. I had a few glasses of wine and my +1 first ordered a Deleece Sour (Maker's Mark + red wine) which was pretty good.  For his second drink our server recommended the Smoky Old Fashioned with bacon-infused bourbon.  We were both disgusted by the flavor - it tasted like bacon grease and was extremely thick and overpowering.  He was at first going to sip it and deal with it, but then thought about asking the server if he could swap it out for something less disgusting.  She nicely obliged, telling us that ""people either love it or hate it"" (?!)  which made me wonder why she suggested it in the first place.. He got a Lemon Basil Manhattan instead, which was much better. Our total bill - 2 glasses of wine, 2 drinks, the risotto, and our entrees, was $88 before tax + tip.

She made recommendations and took her time with us. That was appreciated. No pretentiousness here.  Food 411- We ordered the Beet Salad, Tuna, and Duck. The Tuna and Duck entrees were recommended by our server. We enjoyed it all. I was leaning toward the salmon or New York strip steak, but went with the recommendation of the server. I will try them next time.  I popped my duck virginity. (Don't judge...I do get out.) I was fearful it would taste gamey, but thankfully it didn't. I have no frame of reference for comparison, but my good looking date confirmed it was tasty. It came with kale and potatoes. The potatoes didn't rock my world; they weren't bad, but they didn't burst with flavor. They were topped with the kale and moistened by the juices of the duck. Not the best mixture of flavors for what could have potentially been good potatoes. The beet salad was also nice; it led to tongue arousal. It was light in flavor, but moist and refreshing. It consisted of a good mix of textures.  I did prefer the tuna over the duck. I felt it offered a little more flavor fusion in the mouth.  Drink 411- We had the Beckmen Vinyards 2011 Cuvee Le Bec Syrah, grenache, Mourvedre, Counoise blend.  (Santa Ynez Valley) It was a great mix and blend of grapes for a taste that wasn't too sweet and wasn't too dry.

2014-01-02,1.0,"Currently the 3rd person to write a terrible review for Deleece based on a completely awful New Year's Eve experience. I've been here before and the experience was a good one, but after the incredibly poor customer service and ""meh"" food, I will never be back. Let me sum up the ways Deleece disappointed our party of six: -We had a 9pm reservation and checked in with our full party at 9:02, then headed to the bar to have drinks. At 9:25pm, we were still not seated.  -Around 9:30pm (note, we were still not seated), the power went out. Yikes! No problem...we waited it out at the bar and ordered another bottle of wine. The power was out for maybe 30-40 minutes. During this time, the owner (who was there) never came around to check on anyone at tables or waiting for tables and provide an update. A quick apology and a note to let us know they were working on getting the power back on would have been appreciated. Or maybe buy us a drink at the bar to make sure we stay?  -We were finally seated after 10pm (over one hour after our reservation). It took 20 minutes for our waitress to come over and ask for our order. We were already debating leaving due to the fact it was 10:30pm and we hadn't even ordered yet, so asked if the kitchen was running on time despite the power outage. She assured it was so we put in an order for another bottle of wine, and ordered our appetizers (one member of our party orded from the prix fix menu) and main courses.  We then sat and waited for 15 more minutes with empty glasses waiting to get the wine we ordered.  -The first course of the prix fix came out and our friend ate, while the rest of us sat there for 15 more minutes waiting for our order of calamari. Not ok. Appetizers and the first course should have come out at the same time.  -The majority of the food was fine (not good, especially for the price), but there were some HUGE misses. The duck, while ordered rare, was RAW. Pork chops were also not fully cooked. One friend ordered mussels (which she asked to be brought out with the appetizer and were brought out during the main course) and while some were fine, others were rotten. Like, spit it out in a napkin disgusting. The table next to us heard our complaints and also stated that half of their batch of mussels were bad as well. We were also pretty nervous there were going to be some sick bellys the next day. -The owner came over around 11:30pm after we had complained the waitress about the bad mussels. She didn't introduce herself, just awkwardly stood there until we explained what happened. She did offer to remove the mussels from the menu, but there was no apology.  -Finally, after we received the bill (with a 20% gratuity charge included OF COURSE because we were a party of six), we ended up having to run it up to the bartender to get our cards run because our waitress disappeared. We finally left at 11:56--THREE HOURS after our initial reservation. Not the best way to celebrate New Year's Eve -To add insult to injury, two of the three credit cards used that night were double charged. Needless to say, we will not be back to Deleece and highly recommend others don't go as well. I understand the power outage threw them off, but decent customer service could have greatly improved the night.",0.9508,0.773,0.126,0.102,0.5057860588049268

We were seated quickly, but then waited for 20 minutes for waitress to come by and take our drink orders. After she came back with our drinks our waitress never came back till after 9pm to take our dinner order. Shortly after placing our dinner order the power went out. Our group had to hail down the waitress (that was avoiding our table) to get any ETA of what was going on. In total our waitress came by once during the black out which we had to ask for more drinks and bread to eat (because we have had no food for 2 hours). This should have been an indication for us to leave. You think a server or manager would be more attentive to their customers during a black out? I wish now we all just walked out then. After the power came back on the food came out, but it was inconsistent. Two steaks at table were over cooked, the prime rib was cold to the touch, one salmon dish was raw, and my salad was missing half the ingredients. The waitress grudgingly took our food back into the kitchen. When we finally left out of their taking our dessert to go we had been there for 3 hours and their were no accommodations done to the bill for our poor service, bad food, or our time. It was extremely disappointing and I regret more than ever having my friends spend their money on a disorganized restaurant.

The waitress did not come back at all for another 30 minutes to let us know what was going on, give us an update, take a drink order or even refill our water glasses!! It's a small restaurant and an announcement could have easily been made. When the power went on we still go no update of when to expect our food. The food was inconsistently cooked. A salmon dish came out undercooked, 2 steaks overcooked, and 2 prime ribs cold. The waitress showed no care or concern over the food. We received no offer for any discount on the bill for the inconvenience, glass of wine or any real apology. And what should have been the easiest - good service, was not offered. This was the deal breaker for us.

Cocktail was nice, as was the calamari - except it was DROWNING in sauce. Had to scrape a ton off.  Ready to order a beer and our food, our waiter was nowhere to be found. I guess sitting on the patio was no mans land, as we only ever saw the busboy bringing us water and bread over and over. Finally, after having to ask the busboy to send over the waiter, did we order. We finally received our meal, again after a long wait, and I didn't have a fork. So, another lengthy wait. But now time to dig into my seared Ahi tuna with lobster risotto, and my wife's duck breast. Sounds epic, right? That's exactly what the entrees were - epic SOUNDING. My Ahi tuna was obviously frozen and then poorly defrosted, as it was flavorless, swimming in sesame sauce, and very stringy - a very poor quality tuna filet. On top of that, my risotto was disgusting and salty, without a piece of lobster to be found.  My wife's duck breast was just as bad - inedible really - and sided with some bland asparagus. We both only finished 1/4 our meal due to it being so nasty. We decided to cut our losses and skip dessert, and after again unsuccessfully tracking down our waiter, we finally had to cash out at the bar. The only positive was the attentive and friendly busboy.  For what we paid, and the poor quality food, I will never be back. Too bad!!",-0.975,0.818,0.054,0.128,0.6416682266682268
2013-10-23,1.0,"Mediocre if Best We have eaten at Deleece three time's, two dinners and a Sunday brunch. The first dinner we thought that they were just having an off night. I ordered the Boneless Amish Chicken with a warm salad of Fingerling Potatoes, Caramelized Onions, Bacon, Celery Leaves and Fig Mostarda Sauce. My partner ordered the Sesame Ahi Tuna with Lobster Couscous, Asparagus, Garlic Chili Glaze & Sweet Soy.  The chicken when it came out looked ok but you could really tell that it was not an Amish chicken, there was really not a lot of meat on the breast or thigh. It looked like the Frozen airline chicken breast that you see at restaurant depot from Tyson. The base of the chicken was nothing but dried figs and maybe one or two fingerling potatoes. If you are going to showcase a dish with figs then you should use fresh figs when they are in season. Dried figs are not a good choice to use if they are going to be sautéed with other components. The tuna was over cooked (we ordered it Med Rare) then the rest of the dish was not anything to write home about. Why would you be selling Asparagus when it is almost winter and it is a summer vegetable?  The Second dinner that we had there was just as bad as the first one. The bar drink menu is not the best. I ordered an Old Fashion and they used a maraschino cherry and a wedge of an orange. For a place that is suppose to be hip and sophisticated they are falling behind in the new trends for specialty hand crafted drinks.  Lets get onto talking about dinner. This time I ordered the New York strip with Mashed potatoes, thick onion rings and a red wine syrup. My partner once again went back to the tuna. The stack that was served to me I would not even feed my dog. It looked like something that you would order from Omaha Steak Company, it had to be 8 or 9 oz for the 27 dollar price tag. It looked like they cooked it on a George Forman Grill. The onion rings were not even good; it was like they soaked them in a liquid then placed them in over used flour then over cooked in the deep fryer. The only good thing on this plate was the garlic-mashed potato. My partner's tuna again came out over cooked and lacked flavor.  When I reviewed Deleeces website they have this statement on it "" One of the first sophisticated, yet casual neighborhood haunts, Deleece is still considered one the the best. With it's innovative, seasonably inspired menus, affordable prices, and warm welcome services, Deleece is the neighborhood restaurant you wish was in your neighborhood."" I find this statement very hard to believe, they need to fire the chef and hire some one that is young and innovative in the food industry to make them the next best place in the southport area. Nothing about deleece is innovative the menu offerings that they have are over complicated and just cover up the fact that the chef doesn't really know how to make good simple food.",0.9758,0.82,0.111,0.069,0.5821459201176182

2013-10-14,3.0,"I enjoyed Deleece and thought it was adequate.  I went with a few of my buddies and 4/5 of us really loved our food.  One of my friends DID have a pretty terrible looking steak (which was strange because our other friend's steak looked incredible, maybe because it was on special). The Calamari and cheese plate were both extremely good and we ate every single thing on our plates.  I thought the beef lettuce wraps were sub-par however.  I also wasn't a huge fan of my mixed drink (Gin 30), which didn't have a ton of flavor other than straight gin.   My main course was really good.  I got the shrimp and truffle pasta.  I absolutely loved the whole thing.  It had the perfect amount of spiciness and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. I'd have given this 4 stars but our waiter was kind of rude.  He was really assertive the whole time he spoke to us and didn't really care about making our experience enjoyable.  He basically told us he couldn't wait to get off work so he could start drinking.  We're all dudes in our mid-20s and not pretentious at all, but we all thought that was a pretty poor way to start things off.  It wasn't a big deal and it didn't ruin our time at all, but it could have been easily avoided. I'd probably go back but I'd prefer to try another restaurant rather than go here again.",0.9328,0.773,0.145,0.082,0.5569327731092437

I made sure I dipped the duck in the sauce....which also had no flavor. I then put on the salt, which helped a little, but still lacked a lot. My date have the shrimp and truffle pasta. It too was bland. Typically, anything made with truffle or truffle oil has that very unique taste. This did not. The waiter raved about the dessert special of the night, which was a pumpkin spice parfait. It looked delicious. It tasted like pumpkin pie filling straight from a can with some whipped cream on top (which didn't have much flavor either).

2013-10-05,2.0,"I was really unimpressed with brunch at Deleece. To start with, the coffee tasted like diner coffee - burnt, and definitely not worth the price or the location. I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was composed of good ingredients but just awful proportions. It had scrambled egg, chorizo, sour cream, beans, and some sort of salsa, I believe. However, easily 80% of the weight of the burrito was just one large mass of plain scrambled egg. It was really unpleasant; there was so much of it that it overwhelmed the other ingredients. I was with two people who ordered it as well; we all ended up taking out some of the egg and leaving it on the plate. It seemed like my friends had better luck with the Black & Blue french toast and the crispy polenta. However, I also tried a bite of the biscuits and gravy, and it was really mediocre (I love biscuits and gravy - I would have been disappointed if I had ordered them). All of this wouldn't have been so bad, but service was agonizingly slow. I have absolutely no interest in returning.",0.7662,0.697,0.171,0.132,0.4997165532879818

The restaurant has a nice interior, with cool canvas prints of the city on the walls. The patio is pretty large, although I've never lucked out with warm enough weather to enjoy it myself. It gets pretty crowded, so I definitely recommend calling ahead for reservations. They definitely try to maximize capacity, so it lacks intimacy or a romantic feel...that being said, Deleece is still totally worthy of 5 stars because of its amazing food and service.  As for the food: My boyfriend has ordered the steak every time we've been, and while I'm not going to pretend to know anything about steak, he raves about it. I stick to the seafood...the diver scallops are out of this world! They could make a scallop fan out of anyone...butttt if you're hungry definitely get an appetizer because its a fairly small entree, despite being the most expensive item on the regular menu. Most recently I ordered the sea bass daily special, served on a bed of julienne veggies and polenta. Everything about it was absolutely perfect! I've also tried the salmon, which is cooked with this amazing glaze that almost makes it a little crispy.  And as good as the food is, the service is still very friendly and down to earth. From the hostess to waiters to busers, I have nothing but great things to say about the staff.

Are you tracking with me? 40 minutes so far. We ended up ordering two SIDE salads. Stupid, but we weren't really hungry anymore after all that time but we felt we should order something. ONE HOUR goes by. No fricking SIDE SALAD. Are you serious? We watched as families of four got their oysters... but side salad? No way, we don't get our plate of lettuce. We flag down our waitress twice as she flies past us (we thought avoiding us at first), she's antsy and keeps insisting its busy and something happened in the kitchen. But why couldn't she tell us that in the first place?? She's embarrassed and apologetic and says she'll 'take care of us' and alludes that something will be taken off the bill. Which, by the way - That did not happen. Finally, our salads came out and we ate them in 5 minutes. I could have gotten that at McDonald's, seriously. No change to the bill (not that we were expecting that, but don't say you will when you won't). They wrapped up our bill as the quickest thing in the night. Literally in one minute. It was weird.

We sampled the entire prix fixe menu available on Mondays and Tuesdays only.  First courses: goat cheese and beet salad, lobster risotto, and chilled cucumber avocado soup. Entrees: eggplant roulade, Amish chicken with papardelle, teres major steak.  Desserts: pot de creme, crepes with mixed berries, chocolate almond bread pudding. We thought the apps and entrees were really well done - good portions, well seasoned, and the chicken was some of the most tender and tasty bits we've had in our culinary adventures.  The desserts were slightly disappointing in comparison; the bread pudding seemed like an afterthought, and the pot de creme was forgettable.  Can't comment on the crepes, because my mother in law demolished the plate before offering anyone else a taste - guess that's comment enough.

2013-06-13,5.0,"After having not returned to Deleece for over a year following my first meal, I have now dined there twice this month (both excellent experiences); it is definitely time for an updated review.  Last week my wife and I dined at Deleece for a special six course wine pairing dinner showcasing the talents of the new executive chef (Ernesto). We were immediately impressed when some of the staff recognized from our prior visit last year as we entered. The entire evening was so much fun; the new chef is outstanding and all six courses were great, especially the scallop course and the duck breast. Ernesto presented each course to the dining room, a wine distributor selected and presented some excellent wines to pair and the owners were in house and were extremely friendly, mingling with all the guests. During our first visit to Deleece we enjoyed the food, but just did not find the ambiance all that warm or inviting (for us service is as important as the cuisine); on this visit we were even more impressed by the food and noticed marked improvement in the service and ambiance.  After such a positive second visit to Deleece we wanted to come back on a normal evening to see if we would be as enthralled with the experience as the wine dinner. With relatives in town from Boston we figured Deleece would be a great venue for a family dinner. All six of us (with vastly differing tastes) loved our meal tonight and once again were impressed by the quality of the food as well as the warmth from the front of the house staff. Even though we are still fairly new at Deleece we were made to feel like long time regulars. Everything from the cocktails through all three courses was spot on; Deleece truly has a wonderful menu with something for everybody (in fact so many dishes seemed appealing to me I really struggled to narrow down my selections).

Brunch: I came alone and sat at the bar- the bartender/waitress was super nice and attentive and treated me to a non-awkward dining alone experience. I started with the beignets, which were heavenly. Three little fried puffs of dough that were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and melted in my mouth. Serious yum. Is this only for brunch or can I order them whenever? Then I had the lemon-ricotta pancakes with a side of sausage. The pancakes were not as lemony as I expected and I couldn't tell that they were ricotta as opposed to a regular pancake. Maybe my tastebuds were spoiled from the beignets and decided to take a nap for the rest of the meal? The sausage came in a huge patty shape, that was rather intimidating- is it weird to call a sausage intimidating? It was nice and spicy though and I enjoyed dipping it in syrup. I'd definitely come back here for brunch again. Definitely. Dinner: Came with two gal pals and we first shared the calamari. Wow. The batter was perfect- light and golden and crisp. Much nicer than the usual fried calamari with the batter falling off in a heavy skin. The dipping sauce was excellent as well. Not as spicy as I was hoping, but delicious. We could have used more of it for the quantity of the calamari served. Then I had the steak, which was covered in blue cheese. As can be standard for blue cheese, it overpowered the entire meal. I like blue cheese, but I wanted it to complement the meat, and not be the only thing I tasted. I would like to come back and try a different entree. My friends liked theirs.

The day started out promising enough, but ended on a sour note as I ended up drunk enough to make Hunter S. Thompson proud. I think it all started with the gallon of mimosa's I drank at Deleece.   Deleece is a cute little eatery located on the Southport corridor. The brunch menu is quite extensive, but I've never met a plate of biscuits and gravy I didn't like, so that's what I opted for. Deleece's version of this Southern staple didn't let me down. It was delicious. I should have just had coffee, but the idea of bottomless Mimosa's were too tempting to turn down. As it turns out , my visit to Deleece is about the last thing I remember about my Sunday of self destruction. I've been told I had a good time.   Here's the bottom line. If you're looking for a new take on brunch, give Deleece a try. The food, service and all around vibe are top notch.",0.9149,0.814,0.127,0.058,0.5077837195484254

No complaints here... nice size portion, eggs cooked just right, good taste w/ delicious guacamole. My wife on the other hand had the Fish Torta sandwich which was a complete disaster. It was basically a heap of mayo, lettuce, and guacamole mushed together on bread that was too soft to handle the load. No comments on the actually fish because there wasn't enough to really rate. Oh... and the combined sandwich had no taste. Deleece has some work to do on this sandwich. The fries that came with it were cool though :) I'm just going to give Deleece the benefit of doubt and just assume that the Fish Torta is one of their worst items.

The WORST part was the FORCED EXIT by our server.  Seriously...who does that!!!   I noticed the manager signal to our bar server to rush us to leave.  So the server just handed us the check as we were still eating.  I don't have to explain...it was terrible etiquette!!  We had been there for 45 minutes.  Deleece just wanted to seat the last minute rush before the show.",-0.9534,0.846,0.025,0.129,0.5553571428571428

2013-01-25,4.0,"So we got the Groupon and came here for a date night dinner on a Wednesday.  Very happy we did. Groupon restaurants can be hit or miss, but this one is definitely a keeper.  Really nice place.   Good food.  Attractive décor.  The server was knowledgeable and friendly.   We started with the Rosemary Polenta Squares, which were quite good.  The polenta was not as creamy as I expected, but I thoroughly enjoyed it anyway.  It is served in a light tomato sauce, topped with roasted cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives, which added a nice bit of saltiness to the dish. It is hard for me to resist a vegetarian Soup of the Day, and they had one:  A corn and potato chowder, pretty good, but very rich.  While I ate that, spouse enjoyed the lobster bisque.   So, on to the entrees.  Spouse was extremely happy with the Indiana duck breast, which was served with Swiss chard and a buckwheat spätzle.  Portion size was pretty generous.  There is only one vegetarian entrée on the menu.  That's okay.  I can deal with that.  It's a butternut squash and mushroom risotto, made interesting by the addition of cranberries and blue cheese.  A little heavy, but not bad.  I had leftovers.  I'm thinking this selection changes seasonally.  It's not on the menu on the website.  (I had been looking forward to the stuffed poblano that is listed there.  Ah well, maybe next time.) Actually, next time I will likely skip the entrée section entirely and build my meal out of salads and appetizers.  There were several veggie choices there, and all of them looked good.  Made me wish I had a bigger appetite, so I could try more! We had the trio of chocolate for dessert:  A flourless chocolate cake, a pot du crème, and a cupcake topped with milk stout ganache.   The flourless chocolate cake was amazing.  I did not need the other two items.  I was a little disappointed that I could not detect much stout flavor in the ganache.    However, the spouse liked them and we had no trouble clearing our plate. The location is nice:  Right next to the Mercury Theater and a few doors north of the Music Box, making this a really good option for dinner if you're attending shows at either of those establishments.  And they have brunch, too?!  Can't wait to check that out.  Yup, we will be back.",0.9987,0.733,0.239,0.028,0.5819358178053831
2013-01-17,4.0,"We dined here on a Friday night with a reservation, and we loved the ambiance. Deleece certainly works as a romantic pick, although it took me a few minutes to adjust to how close our table of two was to our neighbors. I was literally sitting closer to strangers than to my own date. The waitress couldn't even stand beside our table to take our orders so she was kind of awkwardly standing behind me, and I had to keep straining my neck to see her. Overall, I can see how this could be a little off=putting to some people, who would see the space as too crowded. With the high ceilings, though, it still felt very open. We ordered the calamari and the warm onion tart for our starters. I preferred both of these dishes to our entrees--we both thought the calamari was possibly the best we've ever had (just a little bit soft and not too crunchy, and the jalapeno lime aoli was a nice touch). Meanwhile, the onion tart was a great blend of dates, goat cheese, and caramelized onions. The crust was flaky and buttery, and very tasty. For our entrees, my date had the $27 New Year strip steak, cooked medium rare. He thought it was excellent, but the bleu cheese flavor was too intense for me. This was definitely a matter of personal preference. I had difficulty picking an entree, because half come with mushrooms, which is something I tend to avoid. I ended up with the boneless Amish half chicken for $17. It was huge, and very tender. Our server was pleasant, and we certainly didn't feel rushed, although there were clearly people waiting for our table as it was a very busy night. For two appetizers, two entrees, two glasses of wine, and a cocktail, we paid a little more than $100. I'd recommend this as a great place to try if you're heading to the Mercury of Music Box Theatre, although it's a little pricey to head to regularly, which is a shame, because I'd love to have that calamari again soon.",0.9884,0.824,0.139,0.036,0.5838453416502198

The Good: The food, when it finally arrived, was fantastic.  I ordered the regular french toast and my girlfriend ordered a breakfast frittata.  My french toast was great, although a little crunchier than I usually like it.  Her frittata was awesome and she reported that it was even better today when she had her leftovers for breakfast. We also had a pomegranate spritzer that was very tasty. Our waitress was also very friendly and attentive.  She gave us good recommendations and did a great job.  The Bad: On the negative side of things, it took way too long for the kitchen to make our food. It took about 45 minutes to receive our breakfast, which is about 25 minutes longer than it should've taken.   It would be more forgivable if the restaurant was packed and on a wait, but we walked right in and were sat immediately.  Based on other yelp reviews we read (while waiting for our food), it would appear that this isn't a new issue.  The Verdict: Although the food was really good, I doubt we'll go back to Deleece until we know that their kitchen service issues have been fixed.  I don't know whether it's a matter of just removing some tables, hiring more chefs, or expanding the kitchen, but I sincerely hope that Deleece takes steps to improve their food service.",0.9814,0.806,0.157,0.037,0.4883480804909377

I started out with a hot chocolate and it was really good. My husband said the coffee was pretty strong, which is the way he likes it. We started with the beignets. Warm, cinnamon and sugar topped fried dough. How could it have been bad? For my main breakfast, I went with the steak and eggs. So much steak! The moment the dish was placed in front of me, I knew there was no way I'd finish it all myself. Two large eggs, two pieces of toast, potatoes, and again, I say, so much steak! All was cooked perfectly. My husband had the short rib hash. It was very flavorful and savory. I'm not sure I could have eaten the whole plate because the dish was so heavy, but he managed. He said he was very happy with his choice. We didn't take part in the $15 bottomless mimosas, but if I ever return with my girlfriends on a leisurely weekend morning, I'll be all about it.

We arrived for our reservation at 7:30 on a Friday and did not have to wait at all- in fact it looked a little empty, but a line appeared about 15 minutes later. Someone put bread in front of us right away, but it took our server a moment to greet us. When she did, she just asked if we wanted anything and walked away as soon as we said we weren't sure what drinks we wanted, without mentioning any specials. When she did return, I asked for the ""lemonade cocktail"". She said ""what?"", so I started to point to it on the menu, and she said ""just say the name"". The name was ""Deleece lemonade cocktail"", so if you didn't know what I was talking about when I left out only the name of your restaurant, sorry for trying to be thorough. Her unhelpful attitude continued through the evening, and that first encounter was disappointing. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the busser was a little too eager.

We made reservations for a Saturday night which was good because the place was packed and we over heard the hostess telling a walk-in couple that they most likely would not be able to get a table at all tonight. It was only 715 and they were full up for the night. We thought that this was a good sign. We sat down and promptly served. Our server was awesome. She was very knowledgeable and even brought my friend some ice cream on the house for his birthday. The food on the other hand is another story. I got the Chicken Roulade (spelling?) at the recommendation of the server. I think if it was made properly it would have been very good. At first I noticed the chicken was a bit pink inside and was assured by the server that the chicken is first poached and then baked ensuring that the chicken was fully cooked. She must get that question quite often as she had the answer very quickly. As I was eating I noticed the goat cheese was missing. The goat cheese was one of the biggest reasons I ordered the dish. Other than that it was pretty okay, but for 19 or so dollars I do not think it was worth it. My friend ordered one of the specials, grouper, and it was so tough he needed to use a knife. From my understanding fish should not require a knife. To sum it all up we probably will not be going again and we are thankful we had the GroupOn/Living Social because the food was over priced for the quality.",0.9755,0.877,0.11,0.014,0.5561111111111111

I ordered the filet mignon, which was good. Sides of potatoes and veggies were okay.  Fried Calamari as an appetizer was simply too heavy (ie cheap) and greasy.  Ol' girl ordered the scallops.  Again, too heavy.

2012-11-06,1.0,"I don't generally take the time to write a bad review... But my experience with Deleece was quite disappointing. We've been wanting to try Deleece since we moved to the area but it was always a bit more expensive than we were willing to spend. So when I saw the groupon for $25 for $50, I jumped on it. We went to Deleece the same night. I made a reservation on open table and noted that there were 2 of us and a young baby. The hostess was ready for us and very accommodating. It started off well. Our server came and saw us immediately. And then every 2 minutes after that, asking for a drink order. He was a bit overbearing.  Everything came out very fast... I mean, very fast. We ordered two martinis, both of which came out with big chunks of ice in them. Any bartender knows that martinis should be well strained. We ordered the calamari and the WARM onion tart to start. The calamari was great... I'd recommend it. But the warm onion tart came out cold. Not just room temp, but actually cold. Our server was yet again on top of us to order once our apps came out, so we put in our dinner order when he asked us, assuming that he would course it. That's also something pretty fundamental about restaurant service. But they came out less than 10 minutes after he took our order. We were only half way done our appetizers. We ordered the Tuna and the Lamb Special. I had always wanted to try a tuna steak and I love, love lamb. Should have been good. But it wasn't. The tuna looked as if it had been boiled. There was absolutely no sear on the outside. It was on top of  couscous, which I also love. Usually. But this stuff was mushy and bland. The lamb was tough, as if it was cooked too quickly. It was supposedly a 18 hour (or something similar) braised lamb shank. There's no way. If it was, it was a sheep, not a lamb. The horseradish mash was amazing... gave us inspiration for christmas dinner. The busser was great at keeping our waters topped up, but he was also too eager to take away plates that we weren't finished with yet. We looked at the dessert menu, but were too wary to try anything else. Both my partner and I worked most of our lives in the restaurant industry. From busser to hostess to server to manager... and now we're opening our own. We get it, sometimes there are bad nights. We didn't complain because understand that it happens. The menu concept is great, but execution wasn't great. The service is too pushy about turning tables quickly.  When we left, I was looking for some sort of ""goodbye/ have a good night/ come again"" from the hostess, or our server, or the woman at the front who seemed to be the manager, if not the Owner. But nothing from anyone. They looked at us, but said nothing. It shows me that they just don't care. That's perhaps the root of the problems. The worst part was, I was extremely nauseous by the time we got home and it lasted through the night. That's really what pushed me to write this review. I'd normally let it slide, but I shouldn't be paying $50 per person to go home and get sick. Needless to say, we won't be back. It's a bit sad, cause it's a beautiful restaurant with a good concept.

The potatoes in the hash were not cooked so she had to pick around them and pick out the short rib portion (which did taste great).

After a terrible experience at Tango Sur, my party of six decided to forego our FINALLY available table, and head to Deleece for dinner instead and I am certainly glad we did. They were happy to seat us, and our server was energetic and delighted to serve us, which isn't the case with Tango Sur even on a good night most of the time. Everything we had was executed to perfection - My friend was chewing his lamb shank at the bone for every last ounce of meat.  My mom's filet was a little more rare than she preferred, but she still gobbled it up.  I had a wonderful salmon served over black rice.  Some other notable dishes were the cauliflower and apple appetizer (could have been a larger portion - but so unique and delicious) and the fried calamari.  I know what you're thinking...fried calamari?  Yes, typically it's pretty standard but they soak theirs in buttermilk overnight to soften and it and it truly did make the difference.  Not a rubbery piece to be found in the bunch!   But Deleece, can I offer you a piece of advice while I'm here giving you a shining review?  About a year ago, we had an hour wait at Tango Sur - it was about 6:00PM and your establishment was nearly empty.  We saw your bar and figured we'd go in and split a bottle of wine between the three of us while we waited.  When we came in you told us that we had to eat there to drink at the bar.  I understand you probably get a lot of run off from the one Tango Sur, but you shouldn't be so quick to turn away what could become a valuable customer.  I brushed your negligence off my shoulder at the time but had you allowed us to enjoy some cocktails then, you would have landed a loyal customer in me much sooner.  I hate to think you're turning down those same opportunities today.  Just something to think about... Timing is everything I guess...and this time things turned out in your favor!  Thanks for improving a night that had earlier almost ended in tears.  Myself, and my guests certainly did enjoy our experience.",0.998,0.754,0.215,0.03,0.5645191409897292

2012-07-30,5.0,"I love this restaurant.  I go at least a few times a month now.   Before they moved locations, I'd only been twice.  Both times, the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived (due to work schedules we usually get to restaurants around 8:30pm) and we were the last ones there by the time we were eating.  I'm sure some people like that type of ambience, as it were, but I don't like a library atmosphere and the employees clearly waiting for me to finish so they can go home.  The food was very good, though, so as soon as they moved I stopped in to check it out.  Wow!  Very busy, but usually not too noisy.  I always sit at the bar to eat, and the bartender is friendly but not overly chatty.  It also seems like I get my food faster than those seated at tables, but that could also be because people at tables are usually in groups and it takes longer to get orders out for 4 diners than just one or two.  For appetizers, I always order/recommend the same thing: crab cakes and the gnocchi.  Both are outstanding.  The crab cakes are large, fresh, and taste like you pulled the crab right out of the crab legs yourself.  Another reviewer felt they were underseasoned, but I don't want  a bunch of extra flavors & herbs in something that tastes great by itself.  It's really all personal preference.  They are very fresh so there's no ""fishy"" taste or smell at all, unless you just feel crab has a fish taste.    The gnocchi is amazing, and you just have to try it as my description wouldn't do it justice.   Every entree I've tried has been wonderful, but I will say that if you don't like your tuna or salmon rare then that needs to be mentioned when ordering.  The salmon is wonderful and beautifully prepared, and my favorite here.  They do specials which are not on the menu but it's often the same thing.  A filet is one of them and it's every bit as good as most premier steakhouses in the city.  The NY Strip is also very good and I love the garlic mashed potatoes served with it.   They are much busier earlier in the evening, so if you prefer it less crowded then definitely come in after 8pm.   I read some of the negative reviews and since I love this place I have to defend it: I've never smelled anything strange so it must have been just that one night.  Yes, the A/C has been cranked up a couple of times, but in the summertime restaurant kitchens can get VERY hot so even if it's freezing in the dining area, the kitchen might be just bearable.  I know that restaurants, theaters, shops, etc are often too cold for me in the summer so I always bring a cardigan.   I can't respond to complaints about the waitstaff since I always sit at the bar but I've met and talked with the owner and he does seem very concerned about making things right for the customers.  No, the food doesn't come out as fast as at some larger restaurants and they don't have entrees pre-prepared to just heat up and send out to the tables either. So yes, when they're busy it will take some time to get your meal to you.  Have a glass of wine, some appetizers, and linger over them while you await your entree.  To me, taking your time to enjoy dining out is not a bad thing.  If you're in a hurry, or you have small children with you, then maybe consider a faster chain-type establishment instead.  I have teens and I wouldn't bring them here as they just won't appreciate it.   The owner and bartender always greet me and have expressed an appreciation for my repeat business, which is very nice.    I'm not the only ""regular"" either, so they must be doing something right.",0.999,0.782,0.186,0.032,0.5419803376699929

We eventually spoke to the manager who reiterated the hour wait but did end up taking a percentage off of the meal (thus the 2 stars).  Even after that happened, the waitress came back and ONCE AGAIN told us our expectations for receiving our food were out of line.  She was the one out of line and beyond rude.   The food here is decent but due to our experience we won't be back.  Regrettable since we live in the neighborhood.",-0.6648,0.96,0.012,0.028,0.40954106280193237

2012-07-15,2.0,"Used to love Deleece at it's old location...great atmosphere and great food! That's all that I ask for. Since they moved, something has changed and not for the better.  My husband and I visited probably a month after they moved and there was a bizarre smell in the place which everyone commented on. We decided it must just be due to the recent move and opted to look past it since we loved them so much, although it made for a somewhat unpleasant dining experience. I recall the food being fine, but not what we expected, and again chalked it up to growing pains from the move. We recently went back and sat outside on the patio, which I preferred to sitting inside because the ambience is not as nice as it was in the last location. We ordered cocktails, and the key lime pie martini was A-MAZING, but it was all downhill from there.  The crab cakes were flavorless and needed something citrusy or bright to break up the denseness and fishy flavor. I got a fish special, which was described as ""garlicky"" but was bland and boring. My husband got a filet and asked for it medium, but when it came out it was beyond well done. He sent it back and the server acknowledged it was not prepared as he had ordered it. He did get another steak cooked medium and it was decent but not great, though I had eaten my bland fish by the time he got his meal. There was no further acknowledgement of the over cooked steak, no free drink or dessert, no discount or attempt from management to smooth things over. It was pretty disappointing, especially since we went there to have dinner together and we ended up taking turns watching each other eat due to the timing of the food.  I think I'm done going here for dinner...but I might stop by for a martini now and again.",0.7498,0.81,0.1,0.09,0.5556122448979592

After I voiced my concerns to the waitress, she acted like I was wrong, and had no clue what I was talking about.  I don't have time for restaurants acting like they don't make mistakes, and since I never was able to talk to a manager, Yelp gets to hear about it.

2012-02-25,4.0,"Went to Deleece with my wife and another couple tonight. I wanted to try someplace new, have a little adventure. This was absolutely the perfect choice tonight. The menu is focused on comfort food and that shines through so completely. Sadly, the one downside was a poorly made cocktail.  Their specialty is mac 'n cheese. We got the mac 'n cheese trio appetizer for the table: plain cheddar, asiago & bacon, and a mushroom gouda. All three had firm noodles and a creamy, rich sauce. They were all very, very different. The cheddar was very classic. A straight-forward creamy mac 'n cheese. The asiago & bacon had a great bacon flavor that complimented the gentle creaminess of the cheese perfectly. The mushroom gouda was umami and earthy and oh, so delicious! The bar has a wide selection of American whiskies available. There are some common distilleries represented and a few others I'd not heard of before. While it was good to see a decent selection with clear tasting notes, it's a bit puzzling that no Irish whiskey or Scotch is on the menu. They offer foreign wine and beer, why not foreign whiskey? The beer selection is also nice; I only spotted two IPAs on the list so that was good. I ordered the Mudpuppy Porter (I'm a Wisconsin native and it's a beer from my home state I'd not had; felt obligated) and was very happy with it. Nice and chocolatey with a hint of burnt bitterness. My dinner was the Cuban sandwich. Easily the best I've had. For starters it doesn't have mayo (always a plus in my book). Then the three meats were all very distinct. The gruyere was melted and gooey and the mustard was just slightly sharp with a really delightful tang. It looks like it was pressed under a brick or a heavy pot. No panini grill marks were on it, just a golden brown crust all over. Delightful.  The salad was a mix of greens, thinly sliced onions, and cherry tomatoes lightly seasoned with a vinaigrette. The bitter greens contrasted nicely with the hint of sweetness from the vinaigrette. My wife ordered the salmon and said it was really good. Our friends ordered the grilled chicken with risotto cakes and the brisket sandwich. I stole a bite of the chicken and the risotto. Both were very flavorful. The chicken had a great herb flavor, though my bite was a bit greasy, and the risotto reminded me of arancini. Everyone cleaned their plates so I guess dinner was a hit! As I was finishing my dinner, I decided to order a cocktail. An Old Forester Manhattan, served up. Here's the thing... I'm a bit of a drink snob. When I order a transparent cocktail (martini, Manhattan, negroni, old fashioned), it shouldn't be shaken. It should be stirred so it keeps its beautiful, transparent appearance. More to the point, a cocktail shouldn't be mixed for more than a few seconds. Shaking a drink for half a minute just waters it down and kills any subtlety in the drink. Lastly, a cocktail served straight up shouldn't have chips of ice floating on top. Deleece isn't the only bar committing these cocktail sins but it was the most surprising.  All in all I had a great time. The food is superb, the beer and whiskey selections are well labeled and explained, and the decor is simple. (Though they really could just get rid of the one TV in the back; it's just a nuisance.) I highly recommend it but stick with the beer and wine.",0.9951,0.833,0.137,0.03,0.5685864770150485

The first thing that put a bad taste in my mouth was that when we ordered a salad and an entree, the bartender asked us something about if we were going to share both and if they should come out together or in courses.  We said yes, and it was ok to course it.  When the pasta came, it was on two separate plates.  For this, we paid a ""sharing"" fee of several dollars when the bill came.  This really annoyed me.  I never asked for the plates to be split, and would have been perfectly happy to eat off one plate.  It's presumptuous to assume this, and then charge for it.   Also, the bartender seemed to hate everything in life, especially us.  He wasn't nice, and it was EXTREMELY hard to get his attention for anything.  It wasn't even that busy yet, as it was so early, and he spent a lot of time chatting with the other bartender.  Major put-off. At the end, when we were finally able to get the check after a prolonged period of ""excuse me"" and doing anything to get his attention (dancing, singing, tap-dancing, etc), he was like ""oh, it's a holiday, we don't take coupons on holidays.""  I pointed out that it had no restrictions on it, and he begrudgingly agreed to take it to his manager and ask.  He came back and informed us that they don't usually do this, but, fine, for us, today, they'll accept it (groan).  He seemed totally put out by the entire thing, and acted like they were doing us some monumental favor.   Left with a really bad taste in my mouth.  The food was fine, but not good enough to compensate for all the other unpleasantries.  I'm in no hurry to come back.",0.1475,0.864,0.074,0.063,0.47710265924551637

I believe the gentleman who tended to our table last night was named Alex, and he is one of the managing partners if I have it right.  He impressed us with his ability to take our drink and food orders, recommend everything on the menu that was special from appetizers to desserts, while simultaneously being able to take care of the rest of the house without looking frazzled or showing a drop of sweat on his brow.  We saw him greeting guests at the front, taking orders at tables and tending bar throughout the night and never managed to miss a beat.  His enthusiasm and love for what he does was infectious and really showed!   We ordered some items ""family style"" so were able to sample many appetizers (Mussels, Polenta, Steak Skewers, Crab Cakes....) and there was not one item that fell short of delicious.  The good tastes carried through the rest of the meal from our entrees to the desserts to create an overall 5 star memorable food experience.  I ordered the Salmon which I must say was one of the best I have ever eaten.  The sauce and sides with it were exceptional, and the fish wasn't fishy-tasting, dry or under cooked.  I would go back there just for that some other time!   There was a chocolate dessert that Alex described as ""the best chocolate pudding you will ever eat!"" that we got to sample when the array of desserts came that he certainly wasn't wrong about!  Yum!!   The service was smooth and everything went off without a hitch.  The support staff (bussers and food runners) were always helpful, attentive and friendly.  There were a couple of things regarding service that made it GREAT and not just GOOD, being that there was attention to detail that was not forgotten at several moments in the meal.  For example, when a Blue Moon beer was served without the traditional Orange slice, it was not overlooked but brought as soon as possible.  I also mentioned at the beginning of the meal that I didn't want alcohol during my meal but might order a glass of champagne at the end with dessert.  I was pleased to find that I didn't have to remind anyone that I wanted it when the time came.  All of my friends seemed to be having fun and while it wasn't the quietest Saturday night at a busy restaurant, we didn't seem to have trouble hearing each other over the sound even in a large group.   The price-point was right-on for this type of menu and atmosphere.  Nothing felt over-priced or unreasonable for what you got and how it tasted!   The only sort of negative thing I might comment on is that some of the drinks (wine and mixed drinks) came in what we felt were slightly small servings.  The glasses of wine looked more like 4oz pours instead of 5oz pours, and the cocktails served in martini glasses did not come as high to the top of the glass as they maybe could have.  The drinks and wine were all tasty, which of course makes you want to get as much as you can!   I think it is hard to give great service and food to a table of 15 at any location, and this experience felt seamless.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are having a dinner party with a group, a night out with the girls (or boys!) or for a date of any kind.  I will definitely be back!!",0.9952,0.842,0.127,0.031,0.5048544973544972
2012-01-04,4.0,"Deleece has a very special place in my heart.  My fiancee and I went on our first date at the original Deleece north of Irving Park and he proposed 3 1/2 years later at this location.  Their new location is gorgeous-a large, open room with a beautiful bar-the tables are a bit crowded but other than that it is a really great space. I'll be honest, since both of my visits here have been nights of high emotions I haven't been able to focus very much on the food-but I do remember that it was always good!  I highly recommend starting off with a key lime martini-they are delicious and go down very, very easily.  At our most recent visit I ordered the soup of the day which was a rich, parsnip soup with winter spices and it was so good that I was tempted to lick the bowl. For my main course I tried the farfalle with shrimp, pancetta, butternut squash, mustard greens, and roasted garlic sage butter.  I wasn't terribly impressed with my dish but my fiancee's 12 oz. New York Strip Steak with bleu cheese butter, garlic mashed potatoes, thick onion rings, and mushroom ketchip was fantastic.  They treated us to a dessert assortment of all things chocolate to celebrate-so bad but sooo good.  I love Deleece and I'm sure we will back to celebrate more special occasions to come!",0.9969,0.708,0.263,0.029,0.5750826800826803

They store their wine in a room that heats up their bottles. When confronted, the response we received was ""To be honest, you're not the first customers to complain about this"". Wine fridges for ~16 bottles are around $70. You do the math. $35 dollar profit on $50 wine....or $70 wine fridge.  (2) Food was just ok. Sirloin was fatty, turkey was dry and dishes tried so hard to be hip. Ease off the fancy dishes and get the basics right first.  (3) Table set-up was appalling.

2011-11-27,3.0,"Had dinner here with a friend before seeing a play at the Mercury.  We gave ourselves two hours and were seated upon arrival, so that should have been more than enough time.  Was it?  Well, you be the judge...we had to ask for the dessert menu as soon as our entrees (finally) arrived,  just to be sure we'd have time to eat our dessert when it arrived.  And did we?  Well, we managed to get it down (not exactly how you want to enjoy your dessert), but had to leave a pricey cup of coffee undrunk as we dashed for the theater. To sum it up - for the high prices at this new iteration of Deleece, they should be able to serve a salad, an entree, and a dessert in two hours, especially when put on notice at the get-go about theater plans.  Although we were seated with no wait when we arrived and ordered with no delay, we waited for almost 40 minutes for our first course (two very simple salads), and only got those when we asked where they were.  After the salads, we had to ask again for the entrees, as they too remained no-shows.   What we thought would have been a leisurely pre-theater dinner turned into a rush to finish in time.   While the server did apologize for the lengthy delay in service (after we remarked on it),  no explanation was given and no compensation was offered (comping the dessert would have been nice, especially since we split one between us and had to rush with it). Okay, enough grousing.  On to the food.  It was good.  The arugula salad with figs and goat cheese was a nice small starter, and was seasoned just right.  (Can't imagine why it took 40 minutes to get it, though...it was just arugula, figs, cheese, and a pistachio or two tossed in).  My friend found the house salad 'all right' - just greens with a few carrot and red bell pepper slices. The mussels (my entree) were small guys, but fresh-tasting, no hint of fishiness.  The broth could have used a little something-something, it was unexceptional and didn't make me want to soak it up with the accompanying toast points.  Very little seasoning, and although the menu says tomato, I didn't see or taste any, and I'd have to say the same for the garlic.  My friend had the signature salmon, and it was better than good.  It had a delicious caramelized crust (no breading, just the caramelization) and the sauce was mildly flavoured with ginger...even if you're not a ginger fan, you will still appreciate this sauce, where ginger has been used to enhance the overall flavour of the food, rather than dominate it.   IF I were to come back, I'd order that.   We split the apple crisp for dessert; it was too sweet for my taste, but if you like sugary crisps, you'll probably like this.  The winning touch was the Black Dog gelato on top, yay Black Dog! All in all, my friend felt that while the food was good, the prices and the problems with service would not justify a return visit.  Me, I think I'll give them another shot, just for the signature salmon.  But I'll probably be skipping the salad and the dessert - $8 for a small handful of greens and a fig or two just doesn't cut it.   Oh, and you should know that the menu specifies that there is a $2 charge for splitting any item.  Any ITEM, not just entrees.  Just so you know.",0.9954,0.822,0.133,0.045,0.5278341860160043

Salads were decent, probably the best thing about the meal.  For entrees she ordered the farfalle and I ordered the pork chop.  Food took awhile to come out, unfortunately it must have been sitting for a bit, because it was not all that hot.  The pork chop was disgusting.  I think maybe 20% of it was edible, the rest being fat.  It had little flavor and the ""cranberry sauce"" was nothing more than canned cranberries mixed with BBQ sauce.  The yam puree was decent however.  My wifes pasta had was incredibly bland.  She makes better pasta at home.  For $120, we expected much much more.  This place may be packed now, however if they continue to serve this quality of food it will quickly fizzle.

2011-10-01,4.0,"Food:  5 Service:  2 Atmosphere:  4 Value:  3 So I've decided (like most people these days) to slow my groupon-hoarding, and possibly cease buying altogether.  As the expiration date looms, I hate feeling like I ""have to"" go out to dinner.  It's been harder with my wife's new schedule but we managed to sneak into Deleece the day before Rosh Hashannah and beat the Groupon-expiration rush.  The restaurant was buzzing on a Tuesday night at 7:30, and after a brief survey of the menu, we ordered the Caramelized Salmon (pan roasted Chinese black rice, spinach leeks and pear-ginger sauce), Albacore Tuna (baby bok choy, shiitake, roasted garlic, cashews, sweet potato fritters, lemongrass-chili aioli), Garlic Green Beans, and Fried Cauliflower with Curried Apples.   After waiting over an hour to receive our food (the reason for the ""2"" on service), my frustration quickly turned to elation.  I'm not usually big on presentation-I don't care how something looks as long as it tastes great-but every single dish looked absolutely pristine.  The attention that every component of every dish received was as rare as the delicious tuna that adorned my plate.   The salmon's Asian preparation included both sharp flavors and delicate textures.  The skin was crispy, the sauce flavorful, and the black rice was a unique twist I had not encountered before.  The portion size was also quite generous, as opposed to the salmon at Chilam Balam (see my review).  The quantity matched the quality, and for $18 I might dare say it was a ""steal.""  It sure beats three 5-dollar footlongs. The tuna was cooked to a nice rare and had a generous crust on it, and the acidic aioli spread across the plate perfectly accented the hearty-tasting tuna.  The shitakes were a tad salty, but the real star accompaniment were the sweet potato fritters.  Tiny medallions of deep fried, slightly sweet, awesomeness.  They could easily serve these as a side or an appetizer just by themselves.   The garlic green beans were probably the least impressive, but no less flawlessly executed than the rest of the meal.  It was actually nice to have something more ""plain"" next to the intricate, flavor-packed dishes on our table.   The fried cauliflower was every bit as delicious as I had hoped.  It was crispy but not too oily, and the curried apples added just the right amount of sweetness and spice.  The pearl onions that came with the dish were so sweet and juicy that I honestly mistook them for grapes.                Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone but vegans.  There are plenty of options for everyone and every dish is well thought-out and executed.  There's nothing obligatory about making a trek to this gem of a restaurant.  It may be a little far away, and it may take forever to get your food, but trust me, once it comes, the food will be ""de-leece"" of your problems (I'm sorry, I couldn't get through an entire review without a horrific pun).   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9988,0.765,0.197,0.038,0.6077508102098265

Then on the recommendation of friends who had been for brunch and loved it,  we decided to give that a try. Once again a home run in my book. The $15 bottomless mimosas were no where near short on spirits and they were not shy with making sure your glass was always full. Again, the service was great and so was the food. So, again I'm really surprised to see anything below a 4 here. I don't usually take the time to do this, I guess I'm kinda critical usually.

2011-03-03,3.0,"I met a friend here for brunch on Sunday morning and I was excited to finally try it. Thankfully she arrived early and got our name on the wait list because this place is popular with a capital 'P.'  The hostess seemed pretty miserable when my friend went to check on the status of our table, but I'd probably be grumpy too if I had to be asked constantly about updates on getting a table. The area in which to wait is a little cramped, particularly when there are strollers the size of Range Rovers hogging the space.  We finally got seated and ordered our food. I had my eye on the breakfast pasta that I saw on their online menu so I knew I'd be having that, but they changed it up a bit from the one I'd seen. The current one they were featuring sounded a bit heavier than the one I'd been coveting, but I still decided to go with it.  My vegetarian dining companion went with the vegetable tostada salad which sounded unique and delicious and would have been my second choice if I didn't have my heart set on the breakfast pasta. She also ordered a mimosa to go with it. Strangely, I didn't see the ""bottomless mimosa"" option on the menu. Do they still offer it?  Our food came out pretty quickly, which is always a plus when it's your first meal of the day and you're starving, as we were.  My breakfast pasta was interesting. As I expected, it was a little heavy and rich, but I still enjoyed it. It was farfalle (bow tie) pasta with mushrooms, ham, spinach, pecorino, and topped with two over easy eggs. The eggs were a little overcooked (certainly not over easy) and the sauce was a little bland, so I asked for some more cheese to liven it up. I would have enjoyed this dish more if the eggs were less cooked. The original version of the breakfast pasta was spaghetti, roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, garlic, and scrambled eggs. That version appeals to me much more than the one I was served, so boo on them for not updating their online menu.  My friend absolutely loved her veggie tostada salad, which looked fresh and hearty; I'm definitely considering that on a subsequent visit.  They also have some other unique takes on brunch items like benedicts, as well as a smoked salmon scramble and a polenta dish with eggs, rosemary, pesto, and spinach. Their menu reminds me a bit of m henry, but m henry blows this place out of the water.  Service was pleasant, if a little chaotic. Our server even failed to charge us for a couple of things which brought out total below the minimum amount needed in order to use our A La Card, so I actually had to ask him to charge us for them so we could still use it. It seemed a little backwards, but we still came out ahead.

The Poblano pepper entree (with spanish rice and black beans) worked well.  It had a good mid-range taste and wasn't too muddled or unbalanced.  I forgot, their butter was something else (comes with bread).  We had to request more.... yes, more butter!  It was dijon and honey flavored.  The Dijon wasn't overpowering and the honey was a great compliment.   I would come here again and especially for their brunch as it looks good.  (they have a half order option for french toast... as I usually find that most places give too much food, this is perfect)",0.9896,0.768,0.207,0.025,0.5249999999999999

I had noticed Deleece many times, but never eaten there until this past Valentines.  Our reservations were at 8pm, and we were seated promptly.  The restaurant is reminds me more of a small, intimate cafe, as the main dining room and adjacent bar are situated in one area. I'm usually not a fan of small restaurants, but somehow Deleece makes this work well.  As others have mentioned, the room is full of interesting, provacative art works, sprinkled with some nudity. I kind of think it's a nice touch as the peices spark up interesting conversation. The restaurant is purposely dimly lit, which makes the dining experience a bit more cozy.  Food I would have to say that the food is very good here. I ordered the Amish half chicken, and my date had the pork chops. Both entrees were large in portion, as well as freshly cooked. Somehow the cooks prepare the dishes with just the right amount of spices to enhance the flavor of the dish.  I was reminded of some of the dishes at the old Fiddle Head on Lincoln Ave., while eating We all had enough food left over to bring home a nice sized doggy bag.

Okay, I can't comment specifically on brunch since my bookclub had a meeting there more than a year ago.  I can remember we all liked it and vowed to return to Deleece.  Which we did, recently. I returned to Deleece sans bookclub in December for dinner before the White Christmas sing along at Music Box.  A friend and I met up, me with  restaurant.com  gift certificate in tow.  As it happened, it was a Wednesday, and Wednesdays are half price bottle of wine night's at Deleece.  Note that none of Deleece's deals (Monday and Tuesday prix fixe or Wednesday wine discounts) can be combined with other offers - so if you have a Groupon or  restaurant.com  coupon, you're out of luck: it's one or the other.  We, of course, went with a bottle of wine and Amish chicken for me, pork chop for him.  My chicken, far from being the boring bland bird one might have expected, was delicious.  My friend reported the pork chop as very good, as well. My next visit was indeed the triumphant return of bookclub to Deleece.  On this evening, a Saturday, Deleece was pretty crowded.  The hostess took the name of the party I was with, said we had a reservation, then turned away from me and left.  I was confused - was I supposed to wait? Was I being seated?  The rest of my party trickled in and we continued to be ignored by the hostess.  Finally she seated us and the evening improved considerably from this rocky start.   I made it a point to take note of the oft-mentioned naked lady pictures on this visit.  They really aren't that graphic at all.  If I hadn't been looking specifically for them, I'd never have paid them any mind (and didn't on my two previous visits).  I wound up ordering only a soup and salad - both of which were fine, but were a little overpriced at $5 for the soup and $8 for the tiny salad.  My friends that ordered entrees all really, really liked their food.  Mental note: skip apps at Deleece in the future and go for entrees. Although...my mini dinner allowed me to save room for dessert.  And the desserts were amazing.  We ordered two of the chocolate trios and one of the parfaits to share.  Everything was good, but the parfait (chocolate, ice cream and caramel - no fruit  here) was out of this world. Overall, Deleece is a solid bet.  It's definitely a little on the spendy side, but the wide availability of discounts makes it a great option.  Hopefully I won't forget that this time.",0.9953,0.833,0.145,0.022,0.5307364341085271

I guess I was expecting something more like the traditional gnocchi, but what i got was gnocchi balls with whole pistachios mixed in and drizzled with balsamic. Seriously, that's it?? Yeah, disappointment sums that up. Crab cakes were WAY TOO fried to be counted as crab cakes. I was expecting some flavor to them, but it was too hard to get through their fried outer shell. No where in the description did it mention that they were fried. The aoili sauce for the crab cakes was bland and almost non-existent. My main dish was the cavatappi pasta, which was pretty good...but not good enough to lure me back for a second visit. All in all, it's too overpriced for the kind of food it is.

And sometimes it is.  ONCE I ordered their brunch special and it was so melt in my mouth good, I thought I'm coming back here every day.  But it appears it was a one time menu item.  Otherwise, try their sweet potato salad. It's the only other thing that's consistently delicious.

Veggie spring rolls in lettuce were small but filling.  The crispy lettuce was a great contrast against the warm fried goodness of those little wraps.  Dessert was excellent as well.

My entree, the tuna, was unbelievable; tender, flaky perfection. I die. I was in my own little world, eyes closed, savoring every bite. The dish had a mild Asian flare - it came with bok choy and a sauce that made me think of Japan. Alone, the tuna was divine. As a whole, this dish was all I could think (or talk) about for the rest of the evening. Were I a tuna fish, I'd swim as quickly as my little tail could take me into a net for the honor of being celebrated so gloriously upon my self-sacrifice.  Boyfriend and I split dessert - a parfait with brownie, marshmallow fluff, and salty peanut gelato - sounds amazing, tastes even better.

As a true Scorpio who loves this time of year, it wasn't a problem at all! I've been going by Deleece for a long time. I meant to go over the summer to sit on the patio but that never worked out. With that said, I came in around 12PM for brunch and it was comfortably crowded. Exposed brick, light lounge music, low lighting, I was in heaven. We were seated promptly by the window. I started with a coffee, cool. I was starving and wanted to try something outside of the usual so I went with their breakfast burrito. Hold the chorizo and sour cream. Pardon my Polish, but HOLY SHIT. I was literally knocked out of my chair after trying this. The tortilla was filled with scrambled eggs, extra black beans as I requested guacamole, and pico de gallo. Flavorful. Spicy. Filling. EVERYTHING. I was so excited eating the burrito that I never wanted it to end. It was a protein packed monster and I loved every second of it. The roasted potatoes on the side were also very welcomed.  Loved, loved, LOVED Deleece.

App = It was sweet potato with chipotle.. Not bad, tasted little too bland for me but Yukari did like it, so it might just be me.  And it came out pretty fast which is always plus in my book. Main course = seared tuna with bok choy and mushrooms.... Pretty good.  bok choy and mushrooms weren't over cooked and the sauce complimented the tuna beautifully.  I prefer crusted sear tuna but nontheless, it was a good dish.   Things I didn't like about this place included naked girl painting on the walls, call me a pervert for NOTICING it first but I don't think having a naked girl painting on the wall of a restaurant is very professional in my opinion.  Service..... Who wants to wait 40+ minutes for their meal????  not this fat ass.  Come on Deleece!  (maybe because we had a big group?

2010-10-05,5.0,"We went for our anniversary dinner here last Saturday night. It was a lovely time and the food was surprisingly good. It was not a large restaurant, the staff was responsive and the atmosphere wasn't too loud. I really liked the tables for two, which were as wide as those tables usually are, but longer, which makes for more room on the table, even if it distances your dining partner slowly. We arrrived at opening, around 5.40pm, and the restaurant was empty. By 6.30pm it was mostly full, so you might want to make reservations if you plan on arriving later on Saturday. We started off with the gnocchi in a balsamic reduction with truffles, pistachios and Parmesan cheese, and they were delicious in so many ways. The gnocchi were fluffy, and warm and just a little crispy, and paired wonderfully with the reduction. My girlfriend had a Deleece Manhattan, which had some great port and whiskey flavors in it. For our main course, she had the veal with shiitake mushrooms, which I thought was a fantastic combination, and the veal was perfectly done, complimented well with some bitter greens. I had the New York strip, which was an extremely subtle dish that accented the meat very well with some truffle mashed potatoes and spinach, in a sweet demi-glace reduction.  The desert was really the cherry on top, the decadent chocolate with a deliciously mouse-like chocolate pudding, two beautiful truffles with just the hint of orange and an almost overpoweringly chocolate cake, most reminiscent of the Sacher Torte so popular in Vienna. The entire experience was accented by a perfectly executed raspberry reduction that must have taken great patience on the part of the chef.  Our waitress and the staff were very attentive and pleasant, as well as helpful. Overall, the experience was original and delightful, and made the dining very enjoyable.

2010-09-14,3.0,"There's a reoccurring nightmare that I have where I go ""after hours"" to a place that I consider friendly and fun. Usually it's something like a circus or a bar. But, regardless of what the setting is, things are horribly different late at night and, frankly, a bit scary. The clowns are laughing at me instead of entertaining me or the bartender who is so friendly to me during ""working hours"" pulls a gun on me and tells me to leave. That sort of thing. These are close to my feelings about Deleece for dinner.  Not that the service was bad. Quite the opposite. Despite using the Groupon (read by many employees as being a cheap ass bastard in a nice restaurant), the servers, the hostess, and everyone else was really friendly (and there was zero gun-play).  And the surroundings were inviting.  The patio was just shady enough to enjoy a late July day (although the setup was a bit crowded).  But the food, well that was a different story. Something was unaccommodating about it. Something was ""just ain't right.""  One of the great things about brunch at Deleece (at least at the Clark one) is that, even in a slightly upscale setting, I could actually read the menu - the words and the items on it were pedestrian and friendly. At dinner, this veneer was gone and it was like the menu was written in Fancypants.  Now I've taken a few lessons in this so I was able to order a rice-stuffed chili relleno. Sorry, a ""Poblano pepper, char grilled and stuffed with Spanish rice on a bed of black beans and black salsa topped with poblano sour cream and crispy pimenton tortilla strips."" For $15.00 (about a dollar per ingredient or adjective it seemed), I expected magic. I got all of the spicy but not of the savory that normally accompanies this dish. And the rice was sort of dry and burnt.  The off-putting surprises were not over, however, as my polenta came in pancake form. It was easier to share that way with my two dining companions (who were smart and ordered the Amish chicken so there were no shocks) that way and it tasted alright. It was by no means scary but also, by no means, the best that I've had.  A wiser (and fancier) diner than I let me know that Deleece actually started serving brunch only a few years ago so that, technically, brunch is off-hours. Still, I think that might be their breadbasket. Or, maybe, eggbasket as it were. Regardless of what kind of basket it is, that's when I'll return.

2010-07-20,3.0,"Summary: A fairly quiet, relaxed, decent restaurant.  An unremarkable experience, but no great disappointment.  Starting out with their Monday/Tuesday $20 prixe fixe menu is probably the best bet. Full review: Deleece has your standard brick walls, black tables, sparse decoration, candles on tables (that kind of thing). Our primary waiter was very slow and aloof, but the extra service staff was very friendly and efficient. The waiter recommended the wines and said that the main menu is built around ""California Wines"". Keeping that in mind, I got a glass of Riesling, generously poured but very unremarkable. What can I say, California isn't exactly known for good Rieslings, so what did I expect? But I wanted a white to pair with my salmon entree, and this was the best affordable white I saw on the menu, save for one Chardonnay which I just personally don't like. Oh well. My salad appetizer was so-so at best. A tiny plate of greens with chunks of goat cheese and some nuts sprinkled here and there. It was supposed to have a buttermilk dressing or something of that sort, but that added nothing to the flavor. I felt sorry I didn't go for the gnocchi, which sounded good.  Our main courses, however, were excellent, especially my grilled salmon with spinach, which was the best I've had in a looong time. Fresh, flavorful.  I also appreciate the server checking with me about how I like my salmon prepared, too many places don't ask.  This was prepared just right, well seasoned, yum. My boyfriend had the steak with mashed potatoes and reported that it was well prepared as well. One critical note is that the food was bathing in butter. The salmon was sitting in a pool of sauce that was ALL butter. Yes, butter makes things taste better, but this was overkill and I would have appreciated something more inventive. I loved my salmon despite the butter pool, most of which I scraped and left to the side.What's the point of billing yourself as a ""fresh, local, seasonal"" place and then going so wild on butter that the freshness melts away underneath? But overall the entrees were great. I share previous reviewers' warning about slow service! If you have another engagement planned for after dinner (as we did), budget extra-extra time. Even though we were there on a Tuesday (early evening) and the restaurant was nearly empty, we waited about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, and received no apology for the very long wait (unlike some of the other reviewers here). Overall, I would come back here for their Monday/Tuesday $20 prix fixe dinners. The dishes on that menu don't seem as good as the main menu items we had, but the prices are more reasonable for what you're getting.",0.998,0.729,0.204,0.067,0.42797820823244564
2010-07-20,4.0,"I prefer to drink my calories at brunch.  Order light.  Drink heavy.   Admittedly not the most adventurous brunch (hey, I'm on a weight loss plan), I went with scrambled egg whites, wheat toast and tomato slices instead of breakfast potatoes.  Total snoozer, I know, but it IS low-calorie and tasty to boot.  Who needs high-fat brunch anyway? Perhaps the best part of my light meal was there was plenty of room left in my belly to imbibe in the $15 bottomless mimosa special.   The bottomless mimosa brunch is tricky.  Sometimes they're too heavy on the OJ.  Sometimes the restaurant kicks you out after your meal is consumed.  Sometimes the location is so packed you wait for an hour to even be seated and in that hour you totally lose your will to brunch. It's a brunch battlefield out there. The fact that none of these landmines happen at Deleece bodes very well in its favor.  I like knowing that I can generally get a table right away and no one cares if I camp out for awhile to enjoy my morning booze.  I also like that the mimosas are absolutely top notch, low OJ, high champagne drinks.  Hip hip hooray for no OJ heartburn!  I also like that the service is super laid back and friendly.

2010-04-07,5.0,"I loved everything about this place, and after reading some of the other reviews I'm wondering if we just went on an ""on"" night... so first recommendation? Go on a Tuesday. It was nice and quiet, maybe 15 people in the place at 8pm. My immediate reaction on walking in the door is that I was thrilled to be able to see into the kitchen. I'm a pastry cook, so I'm always happy for an opportunity to size up the back of the house. It was insanely clean, and the chef noticed me looking and flashed me a big ol' smile.  Our service was stellar - we didn't wait for anything, and when we were looking at wines our server had some excellent suggestions. She obviously knew what she was talking about, and even brought out a taste of one of the wines we didn't order (and for what it's worth, it was a nice big taste - not some piddly sip). My knowledge of wines is usually limited to ""Sure, I can taste cherries in there,"" so I appreciated the input.  A tip: Monday and Tuesday nights they offer a $20 prix fixe menu which is well worth it considering the prices on the full menu are around $15 per entree.  We decided to go with the regular menu, and I've gotta say it was one of the tastiest meals I've had in a long time.  We started with the gnocchi appetizer - fabulous. Apples and gnocchi and pecans... really, really good. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was smothered in a sauce that I mopped up with my bread (and would have licked from the plate had I been in private) and came with a ""savory apple cobbler"" that I'll remember for a long time. It was like a little bite of Thanksgiving. Delicious. My husband ordered the rack of lamb special which was coated in blue cheese and horseradish - incredible. Cooked perfectly. There wasn't a morsel of food left on either plate. For dessert I ordered the apple cobbler and it was wonderful - a la mode, warm and crispy.  The check came immediately, and the whole thing (2 glasses of wine, an appetizer, two entrees and dessert) came to just under 100 bucks. A bit more than what we'd usually spend on a Tuesday night, but well worth every penny.

2010-02-12,4.0,"One day after intending to head in the opposite direction on Southport, I made a U-turn near this restaurant. The multi-course special caught my attention, and upon going back home, I ventured onto the website and made note on my list of ""places I'd like to eat at"" for future reference. Luckily for us, 2 months later this restaurant showed up as a ""Groupon"" (a service along with Yelp that we adore) and I made the purchase. We finally had the opportunity to venture out last night and decided to go to Deleece and it was definetly all we expected and more!  For starters I'll comment of the food - My husband and I enjoyed sharing 2 of the starter appetizers (the Crab risotto cakes with truffle aioli and the Chicken and vegetable potstickers with ginger, coriander, mustard seeds, honey) and they were absolutely delicious! I personally enjoyed the crab cakes but only tried the sauce for the potsickers (as I do not eat meat, only fish/vegetables) but my husband really loved the potstickers, which he says were crisp and seasoned to perfection! After such a delightful opener of delectable appetizers, we were completely looking forward to our main entrees which were (Me): the Caramelized salmon (cooked to your preference), pan roasted served with Chinese sticky black rice, spinach, leeks and pear-ginger sauce along with a side of sauteed Brussel Srpouts and pearl Onions, (Husband): the Roasted/Broiled Lamb Shank Chops (cooked to your preference) with Steak Seasoned Potatoes and Sauteed Rapini - and we each fell in love with each of our respective dishes.  Of course there was no arguing the necessity of a dessert menu offering after the other dishes were so well prepared and beyond our expectations, and hilariously enough we both opted for the Vanilla Hazelnut Creme Brule which was heavenly.  The service was excellent, there was never a moment when a glass remained empty or an empty plate remained in the way, and our female server that evening was new and still provided exceptional service, more than earning her tip. The whole staff seems to work very well together with a harmonized dinner service and prompt, attentive service.  The atmosphere and ambiance is somewhat romantic and trendy, yet still warm and inviting, and I particularly liked the brick and morar design. As for dress, it is certainly appropriate for the decent casual to business casual dress.  The only area of Deleece that I find a bit negative commentary to add (and why it loses a potential 5 star rating) was how the 2-tops were arranged alongside the wall, they were are too close in proximity (which makes it awkward to be seated without potentially disrupting other patrons) and as they were all full and we were also seated there, it was a bit difficult to chat as the din of the other tables conversations were clearly audible between each other and sometimes made it difficult to hear each other. So if you are seated in this ""zone"" your conversations will not be wistful and romantic, or private by any means, so much so that you may become friends with your neighbors. This is the solitary exception i've found dissapointing from this experience. Other than the aforementioned, it truly was superb!   In closing, we are both more than pleased with this experience, and will most definetly will return again to sample the rest of the menu and culinary specials/events as we hear of them via the website.",0.9982,0.782,0.176,0.042,0.5480727035521556

I was, so I'll stick with ""cozy."" But, given the fact that this was right after the Groupon came out, I won't complain too much about slight cramping and the slightly slow service.

We got cheesecake for dessert that did not disappoint (it was the more savory, less sweet kind of cheesecake).  Basically, Deleece was outstanding. The only negatives were the slightly slow service and the slightly cramped accomodations. As far as prices go, it was a little weird -- I thought the prices were competitive for a fine dining establishment, which matched the food...but they seemed a little high for the atmosphere and accomodations of the restaurant.

2010-01-02,4.0,"There is one thing I hate more than anything in life - standing in line. Thus, I refuse to stand in line at some of the city's more popular brunch spots. And why would I, when there are plenty of great places that let you make a reservation or don't even have a wait. Example: Deleece. I'd been to the other location for brunch before and enjoyed it, so when a friend and I decided to do brunch a couple weekends ago, I suggested it. She preferred this location thinking there would be more street parking available, and she was correct. We ended up being a few minutes late for our reservation, but there was no need to worry - there were only 2 other tables taken. I was really surprised at how NOT busy it was. We were seated in the front window, and my chair ended up being against a door. It was a little drafty on that cold morning, but I figured a mimosa or two would warm me right up and I was correct. We opted not to get the bottomless mimosas, but just know they're there for $15 if you want them. I ordered a half order of the cinnamon orange french toast and a side of bacon, and both were very delicious. As I ""mmm-ed"" my way through the meal, I told my friend that I'd offer her a bite, but I didn't want to share. I'm mean like that. My friend had ordered pancakes, and after we placed our order our server came back and informed her the chef had come extra blueberries and asked if she wanted them on her pancakes. She said sure. Well, when they came out they were actually cooked IN the pancakes. I don't think my friend was too jazzed about that (the server had made it sound like they would be on top), and honestly they didn't look that great. But she ate them, so I guess they weren't too bad. Our server was kind of odd. She did the thing where you'd tell her something, and then she'd just give you a vacant stare for a few seconds too long. It was weird. When we were done eating, there still only a few tables so we didn't feel rushed to leave and were deep in conversation. Our server kept stopping by, dropping the check, asking about the check, asking about change... it became annoying. At first I thought she was trying to cash us out so she could leave (which we would have understood), but she was still taking new tables so it didn't make sense to me at all. At any rate, we decided to leave to get away from her awkwardness. Overall, Deleece is a great brunch spot and I don't understand why it's not busier. If you're like me and want to avoid long waits and long lines, know that you'll get a tasty meal and a nice mimosa buzz to start your day.",0.994,0.799,0.142,0.06,0.5413190686628185

After deliberating for so long for no reason, we finally made it in for a late dinner on a Tuesday night. And the experience at Deleece was quite nice. Lovely, even! Having been to their other restaurant, Deleece Grill Pub, I was happy to find Deleece is similar in design and ambiance. Love the exposed brick walls decked with modern art, and the velvety maroon drapes to soften the room. Only negative to the atmosphere? The blowing heaters! Oy...my upper lip was drawing sweat beats from sitting there for 5 minutes! Our waitress was chatty and willing to help us make our dinner decisions. And we needed her, because so many things on the menu sounded good! The lamb, rolled with bleu cheese and breadcrumbs, sounded amazing. I was contemplating the New York strip with truffle mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach, but the server recommended the boneless half Amish chicken with fingerling potatoes, bacon and celery salad, and fig Mostarda, and that sealed the deal.  My friend's fiance started with the house salad--lettuce, braised cherry tomatoes, peppercorn dressing--and those tomatoes were goooood. The dressing had a little spice to it, too. The bread was nice--a soft sourdough served with a honey-mustard butter. Little slice of heaven that was! Finally our meals came, and the chicken was verrrrrry tender, mmm. I did enjoy the fig sauce, which had the essence of a bbq sauce. Sadly, I didn't really enjoy the smokiness of the bacon and celery salad, but it was okay, because I ordered a side of the garlic green beans. Mmm, perfection! Garlicky, buttery beans with a crispiness to them. My friend's fiance had the chicken too, and he loved it, and my friend had the Szechwan steak salad, and steak was tender, the napa cabbage fresh, and the dressing super spicy! She liked it a lot, and I'll admit I did too. Using my Membercard, our bill (which included a $28 bottle of wine) came to about $76...all things considered, the damage was minimal.

This place is getting 1 star not because of the food, but because of the service.  The food was pretty decent, if not blow your socks off kind of fare, so if I were to rate it on that alone I'd probably give it about 3 stars. However, there is absolutely nothing that excuses the server we had. I get that gratuity is included because our party was so large.. but does that mean she is entitled to be a sourpuss the entire time?  I don't think any of us got even one smile.  Really, the kicker is that we asked her not once, but TWICE even, to bring something out for our birthday girl to celebrate.  She actually said ""no.""  ""NO.""  And not ""No, sorry, we just don't have any birthday candles and/or aren't prepared to handle something like that.""  It was ""No, we usually stick a candle in a beignet, but you already ordered those before.""  Excuse me, but we weren't even trying to get something for free; we were willing to pay for another order of beignet.. or for a dessert since those were *also* available.  It just smacked of utter laziness and disrespect for us.  We informed her how rude she had been and how she would not have repeat business from us.. I also asked to see the manager but was informed the manager wasn't around to speak to me.  I informed that server what had happened and all he said was, ""ok."" Clearly, this staff just does not care.  In this economy especially, I am shocked that they would have such a blase attitude.",0.9644,0.818,0.121,0.061,0.5787857142857143
2009-11-25,2.0,"This is a great example of a restaurant that never would have hit my radar if it weren't for the Chicago A La Card.  So, in effect, they owe my patronage to their participation in the ALC program.  But they didn't seem to appreciate that, as we will see in a moment.   First off, the food was mostly enjoyable but the menu doesn't seem particularly inspired.  I ended up with the szechwan steak salad, which was quite good, although there were far fewer greens than I expected and far more rice noodles.  But, I liked the unexpected twist.  The basil/cilantro/mint dressing was the highlight.  I ordered also the soup of the day--potato leek with bacon.  The soup was a tad too salty but generally quite good, and I appreciated that the bacon topping was hot and crisp, obviously crumbled into the bowl right out of the pan.  I tried a bite of my friend's poblano pepper entree and give that a thumbs-up as well. I finished off with the bread pudding, which was decent on its own.  However, the bacon sauce was a fatal misstep.  I am generally not a fan of the ""bacon + sugar"" phenomeon--Vosges and a certain Avondale kitchen being the exceptions--but this one was terrible.  It took an average bread pudding into ""yuck, I want to spit this out"" territory.  It left a really bizarre and unpleasant aftertaste, which is the opposite of what you want from a dessert.  Sad face. My main complaint regards the service.  First off, our server had a severe head cold which caused him to snort and sniffle every two seconds as he stood over our table reading the specials, taking our orders, delivering dishes, etc.  NOT appealing.  The second snag was with my A La Card:  since we had taken advantage of the half-price wine special, they claimed that we could not use two promotions in the same meal.  I argued that the wine special was on the drink side, while the A La Card was on the food side; I also argued that the A La Card had brought us in to begin with.  But that didn't get me anywhere.  Regardless of their ""rule"" I would think that after a two-minute discussion, they would realize that pleasing the customer is in their best interest, and give me the discount.  There were five tables occupied on a Wednesday night--a Wednesday night with a half-price wine special, no less.  They need to look at the big picture.  I'm pretty sure that the $10 isn't going to bankrupt the restaurant, and that giving good customer service is a much better investment. So between the boring menu and the sour taste left from the A La Card debacle, I don't believe that I'll be returning to Deleece.",0.9884,0.75,0.159,0.091,0.5360949141561387

Outside of the beignets, though, nothing on the menu seemed to blow me away. We went with two recommended dishes, the eggs benedict and the breakfast sandwich. Both were good, but nothing outstanding. The sandwich was just two eggs with cheddar cheese and spinach on toast. Good, but I could and have made better sandwiches at home. The prices were in the upper range of breakfast foods, but not out of the ordinary with most items in the $8-$10 range.  I'd think about heading back next time I'm craving fried dough, but I'm not sure there's much more I'd like.

Generous helping of arugula and the poached eggs are perfectly cooked.

Mexicali Hash - $11 - the hash was tiny cubed potatoes, peppers, and some very tastefully seasoned meat chunks. The meat was a little on the stingy side, could have given a little more for the price. It was also served with two eggs sunny side up, cooked very well.  The food was decent and good, but nothing too mind blowing.

It was probably the closet I've ever gotten to a food orgasm, I'm serious!! The veggie spring rolls (in butter lettuce with salsa verde and nuoc cham) were refreshing and the perfect start to one of the best entrees I've experienced in a long time. Cooked perfectly to the point that each bite was heaven, my only regret was that I couldn't finish it (I tried and tried) but I think most people couldn't, it's very rich. I would have taken it home but this is not a dish to reheat. My dinner was the marvelous Poblano pepper, char grilled and stuffed with Spanish rice on a bed of black beans and black salsa topped with poblano sour cream, plus some crispy pimentone tortilla strips sprinkled on top. I know sounds so simple but it is packed full of powerful flavors that if you let them can overwhelm you. I never in my life would have expected this dish to wow me. I will remember it always, I'm sorry here I go again getting all emotional about it. I just need a minute...  I did break away from my dish to try the special of the day scallops which were very fresh and cooked very well. The service was excellent, great recommendations on the specials and the wine.

Their butter lettuce salad with candied pecans and sherry vinaigrette also stands out. Prices are very reasonable.  They have a small full bar and a well-selected wine list.  Drawbacks: Deleece is a small restaurant with exposed brick walls and tin ceiling , so it can get a little noisy.

2009-05-12,4.0,"Having been appointed ""the Knowing One"" long ago by my family, my brother and mom asked me to find a place in the city where I could take their out-of-town and suburban selves for Mother's Day Brunch.  This is where a combination of Google searches for ""Mother's Day Brunch reservations"" and Yelp reviews came in handy. We decided not to eat anywhere that wouldn't take reservations (which I made online at  opentable.com ) and we wanted a place on the north side so that my brother could get to O'Hare somewhat quickly (at least, more quickly than being in the south suburbs). Enter Deelece. When I arrived, I noticed they were busy, but only JUST busy, meaning that tables were filled, but also reservations were being kept on time. Great! We were seated as soon as my entire party arrived and served drinks almost immediately.  Having looked online at the menu beforehand I had an idea of what I was going to order, but then I noticed a Mother's Day Menu! Beignets? Berry and Ricotta filled Crepes? Homemade Quiche? Asparagus Fritatta? Every plate we had was delicious.  While I had a great brunch with my mom and family, there were a couple things which were a little disappointing. First, I waited a while upon my arrival before any server or hostess was in sight or acknowledged me. Second, we had to ask for a drink three times before my brother's girlfriend actually got her mimosa (while my mom's and mine had arrived some 5 minutes earlier). Lastly, our server wasn't as personable as I would have thought in a place whose atmosphere was so welcoming.

I'll go back - for lunch - and give Deleece another try, but it would be disingenouous to take the review down altogether, so here's what happened... I really wanted to like this place. I really did.  The first indicator was two truly awful cocktails: a French 75 (on the menu) and an Old Fashioned. These are our respective favorites, so it wasn't like we didn't know how they should taste. Before we could even attempt to finish the cocktails (it was hard), the waitress brought the two appetizers we ordered: salmon poke and crab cakes. Both bland at best. During our first course, we were informed that they would be turning the lights off in honor of Earth Hour. Ok, fine, but give us some candles or something because the $29 rack of lamb I ordered was so fatty I could hardly eat it. Unable to see to cut the fat, and unable to taste anything but the blanket of spices atop the meat, I gave up. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs - same problem.  I guess we were still hungry because we ordered dessert despite everything thus-far being disappointing. The ""Chocolate Trio"" was edible - as long as you stuck to the Chocolate Duo --- the flourless chocolate cake was so cold - icy in fact - that you had to cut it with a knife. Terrible experience. Oh, and terrible service. She was apathetic at her best. Our appetizer and bread plates were still on the table when the backwaiter brought our entrees. Poor guy tried to get our waitress' attention to get some help, but she ignored him.

Super cute and warm in there.  It's not too large, probably about 15-20 small tables and a bar.  We opted for the little table for two against the window so that we could get our people watching on.  The server asked us if we wanted some drinks and left us with some freshly baked bread and butter while we thumbed the menu and made our decisions.  Oh...about the butter:  it had these little brownish chunks in it which resembled bacon or apples.  The BF doesn't eat bacon and I'm allergic to dairy, so we had a delema.  Realizing that I wouldn't go into antifilactic shock from a tiny tiny taste, I daringly stuck my finger in the butter dish and sampled it.  FYI:  it was cinnimon apple and I didn't die.  It was pretty tastey, but I couldn't go back in for more, unfortunately. The menu looked great and offered some pretty articulate flavor combinations.  I ordered the Salmon with black sticky rice and spinach.  The dish was asian-inspired with sweet sesame glaze.  The salmon was a perfect portion, as was the entire dish, and was done to perfection...not to dry and flakey.  The spinach was sauteed with onions and yummy.  The black rice was sticky, indeed, and was fabulous when sopping up the glaze from the salmon.  The BF had the lamb rack chops off the special and was very pleased.  I tasted one of them and they were nice and rare with a crisp mustard crust on the outside.  Probably one of the best lamb rack chops that I've had and I eat quite a bit of lamb. Overall, the food was great and Deleece gets a five for that.  Unfortunately, the server was a bit stuffy and unjustifiably so.  If there is one thing that I cannot stand in a restaurant, its snooty service.  I don't care if you're in a fancy schmancy 5 star restaurant or at the Bob's Burger down the street, I feel that there is no place for such behavior.  I fault the snooty server alone for the theft of one of Deleece's stars.",0.9959,0.764,0.175,0.061,0.5819444444444444

I called and made a reservation for later in the evening, and the reservationist made it seem that it would be quite easy to seat us at our requested time. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were told that we would have to wait ten minutes, which isn't a big deal typically, but no one else was waiting, and we had made reservations, but whatever. We decided to sit at the bar. The drinks were poured well and seemed reasonably priced, so we were happy about that. We ordered the spring roll appetizer, but I have seriously had better at the most basic of Thai restaurants. The dipping sauce (not quite sure what it was) was so salty that you could not taste the spring roll. I warned my wife to go easy on dipping, but even with just a tiny bit, the sauce proved too powerful. Without the sauce, the spring rolls were actually pretty bland and flavorless. For our entrees, I had the braised short rib which was extremely fatty. The chipotle bbq sauce was too spicy. I should make it clear that I love spicy food, but with a place like this, I expect subtlety with flavors, but the heat from the bbq sauce was tongue numbing. The entree wasn't terrible, but I don't think I'd order it again. Now my wife had the sea diver scallop special... 3 average sized scallop with some garnish and colorful sauce, but I'm sorry, that was hardly worth $26. The creme brulee dessert was good, and on par with others I've had. Our service was excellent, very attentive. Our waters were refilled, as was our bread. Overall though, I don't think we'll be going back. For that tab, we could have had leftovers from Cafe 28, or two dinners at Laschet's.  As a side, I just don't get the idea of getting an eye dropper's amount of food on your plate and justify selling it for as much as some places do. When I go out, I want to leave a restaurant full. Rather I came home and ate a bowl of pasta salad that I had made earlier in the day. That's never a good commentary on a restaurant, especially when you over $100 If prices were more in line with quality and portion, I'd probably give 3 or 4 stars.

The service was prompt and courteous, but that's easy when there's only 3 tables still filled and there's one waitperson.  The appetizers were just alright (they're so unremarkable that I couldn't tell you what they were..),  the caesar salad's only saving grace was the polenta 'croutons'-- the dressing itself was foul and it was ""California"" iceberg lettuce.  I don't care where it came from, it's still not great lettuce, organic or not.  We shared the duck as an entree...SMOKY.  Like sticking your face in a campfire.  The turnips tasted charred, the greens tasted like liquid smoke had been poured over them.  I really only ate the duck, which was fine, but hardly amazing.  When my half-serving was cleared, really only the meat had been touched.  We also did the chocolate flight dessert.  The flourless cake was AMAZING, the truffle was decent, but the mousse?  Awful.  Gritty and heavy, it was damn near unpalatable.  I make mousse from time to time so maybe I'm particularly fussy, but honestly, it had the consistency of frosting.  It's an obvious issue when the chocolate flight isn't licked clean. I would like to try their prix fixe-- maybe the lowered expectations of $20/person will assist me in giving Deleece more love.  They're close to the boyfriend's and would definitely be convenient to have around.  :)",0.9913,0.718,0.2,0.083,0.68205325140809

After we finished, my friend went to speak to the manager about our bad experience, and he knocked off the two puny orders of beignets.  Wow, thanks!

A salad's a salad, so no  need to get into that. The entrees were hit or miss -- mine hit, his missed. The apricot-glazed pork chop was very tasty, and the mashed sweet potatoes were very interesting (with the addition of pineapple and red onion) yet still very yummy. My friend's tilapia...well... Let's put it this way. I never eat fish and even I could tell that it was severely bland and had a fishy aftertaste.. Yuck.  And now...onto the shining star of the meal (and by shining star, I mean the WORST PART) -- dessert. The profiteroles tasted STALE!

Their brunch selections are unusual but always delicious - a nice break from your ordinary omelette. I've had poached eggs on a roasted acorn squash with sage cream sauce (a flavorful delight), and the Chilaquiles, something I didn't know existed until I moved to Chicago, but highly recommend if you enjoy a Latin flair in the morning.

You really cannot beat the prix fixe deal.  You select your choice of an appetizer, large-portioned entree, and desert.  I went with the bacon-wrapped dates, which did not disappoint.  However, I did go with a pork dish for my main course and it was not nearly as good as Ellie B.'s chicken.  I finished my meal off with a chocolate hazelnut torte which was OK - but not as good as my roomie's strawberry treat.

2007-01-25,4.0,"I lived a few blocks from Deleece back in the late 1990s and was a frequent customer, mainly for brunch.  I was nearly addicted to the breakfast pasta and now that I'm more confident in the kitchen, I make it occasionally at home (it's pretty simple).   I've not been back since the arrival of a new chef with some changes to the menu, but always found Deleece to be a very good value.  I really liked the wait staff, too, and spent many summer evenings dining outside on the sidewalk after an afternoon Cubs game.  Ah, Chicago in the summer!  Just can't take it in the winter . . .",0.9445,0.838,0.149,0.013,0.4122818409660514

2006-10-16,5.0,"Wow. If the last couple reviews had been up when I booked Zachary and my 6 month anniversary dinner here, I might not have done so. I rely heavily on Yelp, but I'm glad I didn't let a couple mediocre reviews of Deeleece stop us from going here. The main draw for us was that it was somewhere we hadn't been, the menu online looked great, and they have a $20 three course prixe fixe on Monday and Tuesdays. Deeleece blew us away. I ordered the chicken and vegetable potstickers since the description sounded exotic. They ended up being fairly normal, but nevertheless, tasty. Zachary ordered the butter lettuce salad in addition to the prixe fixe (squash soup, strip steak, pumpkin cheesecake). I strayed from the prixe fixe because my heart was set on the duck breast, especially after I asked the server what I should choose between the duck and the chicken. She said, ""Between anything and the duck, always order the duck. It's my favorite."" Look at this description off their menu: Crispy Skin Duck Breast, roasted plum, herbed polenta, frisee and confit salad $22.00. How could I have even thought to order anything else? Unbelievable. Stabbing bits of everything onto each forkful, I ate this like it were my last meal on earth. Honestly, it would have been okay if we had died in that crazy rainstorm that attacked us on the way back home because it would have been worth it. Six amazing months of love, so many great meals, but ending with an exquisite one...yeah, it would have been okay, we would have been a Smiths song, but I'm really glad we're still alive to savor future meals here. UPDATE: We went back here with Z's parents and they took my duck dish away. I wrote a comment card begging them to bring it back. If you've had this dish and feel the same way, WRITE THEM! 4/3/07 UPDATE: We went back here for our one year anniversary and again, a near perfect meal. The only complaint I had was that the duck, arugula, and asparagus salad was a bit plain. Though I liked everything in the salad, it just didn't come together the way that the rest of their pair ups do. Last night I tried the Orecchiette with an added duck breast. This dish is mouthwatering. They haven't updated their website with the newest menu yet, but man, this entree is super savory. Itty bitty ear-shaped pasta in a creamy garlic sauce with artichokes, duck, and peas. It was only $5 extra to add a tender bursting with flavor duck breast, so of course I did that. New fave here, but I still pine for that more than perfect duck entree I had 6 months ago. 40/20/ UPDATE: Bourbon & ginger ale may be my favorite drink ever. They make their own ginger ale here with real ginger and it is top notch, really.",0.9969,0.813,0.154,0.033,0.5944555444555445
2006-10-14,3.0,"Wow, talk about major disappointment. I don't get it. I just don't get it. Cassandra B. pretty much wrote my review for me.  We went in with high expectations. Everything was just OK. I mean, it was better than OK, but didn't live up to the hype or the price. It certainly wasn't an $80 dinner. I'd go back for the prix fixe menu, but nothing else.  We started with the crab cakes & the butter lettuce salad. Eh. Nothing special. The salad was a major dissapointment because it SOUNDED so good on paper. overall it was a lot of wannabe iceberg lettuce with a teeny scoop of goat cheese. main entrees were definitely better. I had the rack of lamb, which was perfect. the yukon gold potatos were pretty ambivalent and the asparagus just felt neglected. The Wife had the seared salmon which she liked quite a bunch. the black rice was a great side along with the greens.  Overall, it felt like it was trying to freaking hard to be a neighborhood jewel. And the staff, just plain creepy! I got stared at by the weird host & our waitress was downright annoying. You'd think in a place that serves $30 entrees they'd know not to bother the diners while they're eating. plus, she only spoke to me, refused to acknowlege The Wife. no thanks. I'd rather have two meals at Blue Line than another one here.",0.9909,0.694,0.224,0.082,0.5601767676767677
2006-09-21,4.0,"I tried out Deleece's prix fixe menu recently and was pleasantly surprised at the tremendous value - $20 three-course meal.  The restaurant itself was very comfortable and the decor seemed contemporary cool.  Noise levels were just fine and you can easily carry on a conversation without having to strain your voice or hearing.  The staff was friendly and extremely attentive.  My dinner started with some nice breads served with what seemed to be a honey mustard butter spread.  My appetizer was a very refreshing beet salad that was perfect for the coming main course - a blackened redfish.  The redfish was cooked to perfection (moist and tender) served over a bed of fluffy seasoned rice, haricot, and a spicy sauce with andouille sausage.  The dinner was capped off with a sweet potato pudding that turned out to be more like a mousse cake - absolutely delicious.  All in all, this place is great, the portions were generous,  and I really enjoyed it.  It's definitely a date-worthy establishment.  I can't wait to go back.",0.9944,0.715,0.285,0.0,0.6427536231884058
2006-08-09,3.0,"I would like to start by saying I have only been here once for lunch and I will certainly go back.   The food was so good, and the menu just made you want one of everything.   They had original dishes, with many unique ingredients.   The Cobb salad, Spring Rolls and Vegetable Tostada were all good.  However, we had really mediocre service.   It was an hour and a half lunch with only about four other tables (granted, we did order an appetizer which stacks on some time).  After a problem with the bill, the waitress could barely smile or apologize.  They seemed pretty green around the edges with the whole ""service"" aspect of a restaurant.  I would be concerned coming here if I was in a hurry or if it was crowded.   But like I said, Deleece=Delicious so we will be back when we don't care about wasting an afternoon. UPDATE:  Went here last night for my boyfriend and my sixth month anniversary.  The prix fixe meal was such a good deal:  we had caesar salad, tilapia, sausage and pasta, chocolate mousse, and the cheese/chocolate plate.  The main dishes were delicious and presented beautifully.  The salad was so coated in dressing, I really could not enjoy it.  Dessert was good but nothing wonderful.  We also had cucumber mojitos--- very fresh tasting.  Food overall would get 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the service was really poor.  There were only two waitresses, a hostess and several busboys.  We sat for ten minutes without menus or seeing a waitress and then spent the majority of the meal without water refills.  The bussers were so efficient that I almost felt nervous with the ultra-fast presentation of the dishes and the darting away from the table.  It kind of took away from the romantic mood of the meal.",0.9315,0.812,0.127,0.061,0.5372685185185185
2006-08-06,4.0,"Deleece has been going through a lot of changes recently. Gone is the old sign and the old mural, to be replaced by some new, more contemporary artwork. Most important, they've hired a new chef, who has made a series of changes to the menu. It like the place went through the Food Network's ""Restaurant Makeover."" I think the changes are for the better. The old menu had gotten stale, and the new chef is bringing in new dishes all the time. Unfortunately, the place is still going through growing pains, and the staff aren't all as knowledgeable as you could wish. Also, when the chef is not on duty, the back of the house staff aren't always on their A game. I expect this will all even out in time. On a positive note, the food is terrific. I was there recently with a friend after the theater. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and some appetizers (chicken potstickers and polenta with wild mushrooms, yum), which was plenty for both of us.",0.9392,0.853,0.118,0.028,0.45566534914361
2006-08-06,3.0,"I had been meaning to try this place for forever but when i did, it didn't live up.  You could tell this place is upscale, the decor was quite nice and the entrees were creative and unique.  However, my dish was so overseasoned i could barely eat it.  this is coming from someone who uses salt, mustard, salsa like it's going out of style - i LIKE seasoning - but this was ridiculous.  i felt like i needed to put it on some wonder bread to cut the taste.   my dad's and fiance's dishes, as i understood them, were OK.  the prices were pretty expensive.  I would go back to try the Pris-fix (sp?) dinner during the week, but probably not for anything else.",0.9724,0.761,0.196,0.043,0.6799999999999999

The outdoor seating area is great for people watching, and the inside is nice as well: simplistic and open.  The menu is creative and unique, and I've loved everything I've tried.   Unfortunately for me, I think more and more people have fallen in love with this place, because I stopped by my old hood a couple weeks ago to grab a bite for lunch, and a line was out the door.  Too bad I was too hungry to wait. 2/12/07 Update: Made a reservation this time around to sidestep the wait issue. Our hostess wasn't particularly pleasant, but our waitress made up for it.  I tasted all three meals ordered by my party, and all were AMAZING.  The foods were wonderfully paired together - it felt like a gourmet party on my taste buds.  It's not cheap: most entrees fall between $16-20, with $25-30 for the top of the line meals.  Must go - just make a reservation first!",0.9871,0.751,0.204,0.045,0.6935817805383022
