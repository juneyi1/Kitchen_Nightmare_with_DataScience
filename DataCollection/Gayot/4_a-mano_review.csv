2010-03-07,5.0,"My husband and I dined at A Mano yesterday evening (3/6) for a nice date night down town - we had no idea it was their last night of business and are so very sad! The food was amazing. We started with the Buffalo Mozzerella appetizer, then the Tomato Soup (which I could have happily eaten my way out of a bathtub full of). For dinner I had the risotto special, which was a Lemon Artichoke dish that I could not stop eating - my husband literally had to take the dish out from in front of me so I didn't just put my face in it. My husband had the Flat Iron Steak, which he happily ate every bite of. I was so full I wanted to cry, but my husband insisted on ordering dessert to complete the experience of trying a new place. I ordered the sorbet, the flavors that evening were pear and limoncello. Both were very good. My husband ordered what  I think was called Affagado (?) which was espresso poured over gelato. He quickly downed it, declared it the best thing he had ever eaten, and ordered a second. Overall, we had a great experience. Our server, Muriel, was really nice. She was helpful, answered all of our questions, and didn't hover waiting for us to finish our meal.

Classic moment at this place was a while back when I ordered the ribollita.  This is a classic Italian soup (literally, this is Tuscan cooking 101), which Amano served as a pan-fried wedge.  When I asked where the soup was, the waiter couldn't believe that I was surprised by this preparation.  Oh yeah, my fault.  Usually when I order soup it comes as solid food on a plate without any visible liquid. The pizza was fugaze Neapolitan and not nearly as good as some of these reviews say it was.  Pastas were fine, if unmemorable.  The gelato was good. If people had any taste, Amano would have been out of business years ago.  Thankfully the economy is sparing other diners the indignities of this place.",0.3091,0.838,0.091,0.071,0.4184523809523809

What a steal! And thank goodness for the antipasti bar! I scheduled lunch too late and we were starving when we arrived. My favorites from the antipasti bar was the squash soup (house made), fritattata and crostini. My co-worker was partial to the eggplant salad. I had the A MANO Fennel Sausage (with fingerling potatoes & arugula) personal pizza for my entree. The pizza was 12"" in diameter and lasted me for three lunches (though I'm sure for most people it would satisfy two lunches). The pizza was coated with arugula, the sausage was noticeably homemade, and the fingerling potatoes were an interesting touch of texture. I could not, however, stand the slightly burnt grainy crust produced in the brick or wood fire oven. If I come back, I'll opt for a huge panini - which is what my friend ordered.. For dessert I had the salted caramel gelato which I bet tasted fantastic alone. However, I could not wash my palate of the antipasti bar and arugula entree tastes so the caramel gelato was unpalatable. Now I know to opt for a fruit ice next time.

2009-10-09,4.0,"We had planned for tapas but alas, that pesky thing called work got in the way and we missed the window for specials. Both having recently been on holiday (vacation, not early christmas), something-on-special was all we could afford, but it had to either be or go well with wine... Bin 36's special was on cheese but a MUCH better deal was downstairs with A-Mano's $5 pizzas.  The space is nice, I like that you can see into the kitchen and even though it's fairly vast, it doesn't feel it. The tables for 2 could be slightly bigger though, we had to play plate shuffle to make things fit.  Wine-wise, we decided on a bottle. They sell carafes, roughly two glasses, which price-wise add up to the same as a bottle and we were lazy and didn't want to have to choose twice. But it's a nice idea. The bottle list runs the gamut from not-very-cheap to wait-till-sunday-when it's-half-price to GULP. It seemed like a good selection with lots of Italian reds. On Tuesdays, carafes are $10.  Pizza-wise, these are goooood. Thin Italian style crust, though it could be a little thinner, and for want of a better word, 'gourmet' toppings. I was sad that it didn't occur to me that unless it said tomato, there was no sauce - i know, i know, i'm the anti-tomato brigade but pizza sauce doesn't count, as all us tomato-haters know - so my clam pizza was just cheese, capers and clams. It was delicious, very salty, but sauce wouldn't have done it any harm. My friend had the mushroom one and it was completely the opposite, very sweet and crunchy with nuts. Both were pretty special for $5, anyway. By the way 'whole clams' actually means in the shell. We discussed this for ages thinking maybe it just meant they weren't chopped up, but no, they're in the shell. I hope they're not put in the pizza oven to die. That made us sad. Boiling water is more dignified. Poor seafood. Tasty though.    We finished with some gelato (can someone tell me why gelato is called gelato here, and not just ice cream? There is no difference? Gelato is just Italian for ice cream? Or am I missing something?) Semantics aside, the strawberry balsamic gelato was great, the black cherry sorbet was great, and the limoncello sorbet made us both scrunch our faces up just like when you eat a lemon - perfect.  The neighbouring tables had piles of delicious looking pasta, and my friend tells me their lunch deal is unbeatable - $11 for pizza and antipasti. Our bill for dinner was under $50, including wine, which is incredible. I'll be back even at full price (or Sunday, for the wine....).",0.9957,0.723,0.184,0.093,0.5630045351473923

The restaurant itself is pretty modern, but has some touches here and there that give off that ""you should feel comfortable here"" vibe. Our waitress was really down-to-earth and helpful with trying to pick from their menu; she was attentive but not interrupting every five minutes to see if we were okay.  This is a great place if you're into sharing, because the menu has a ton of options that can easily be split. We started with a create your own cheese and meat platter, and I really should say salad plate instead. We ordered prosciutto and salami (each four VERY thin slices) and gouda (which was practically one bite of cheese). However, the main courses and dessert made up for that disappointment.  We split two pizzas (Buffalo Mozzarella and Fennel Sausage) and 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken with mashed potatoes. The pizzas were SO good, the crust was the perfect mix of doughy and crunchy, the sauces (both pesto and red) were divine, and the cheese was super melty. The 1/2 chicken was really tender and the serving of mashed potatoes (which were really creamy) was quite hefty.  For dessert we got the three scoops of gelato and cannoli. The scoops were tiny, but it gave you a little sample of each flavor: chocolate chip (could use more chips), chocolate hazelnut, and pistachio (I could have easily eaten an entire pint solo). The cannoli was actually five little ones that were neatly stacked and sprinkled with powdered sugar, they were good but nothing to gush about.  I would certainly come back here since the prices were reasonable for a nicer dinner out with a good location close to other nightlife spots.

2009-08-28,4.0,"Two little piggies went to A Mano on a Thursday night, and it was $5 pizza night.  On top of that sweet deal, they are hand tossed and cooked in their brick oven. I watched with attentive curiosity at the kitchen assembly line of getting the many pizzas ordered rolling out of their oven. I like to make pizza at home. So, I took note of how they worked the dough to make the crust. It came out piping hot and slightly charred with a nice doughy crust and thinner middle. These are typical Italian pizzas that are lighter on the toppings and include quality ingredients for your choosing. Combos are a bit different, but don't be shy in trying them. We saw a tasty looking whole clam, roasted garlic and Parmesan pizza at a table near us that I regretted not trying. We decided on the Salami with hot peppers, and Margarita. I was pretty pleased with our choices and the peppers were a nice complement to kick up the heat on the spicy pie.  We also had a delicious heirloom tomato salad. It was our starter, but I had to rave about the pizzas first. A few huge slices of green and red tomatoes and fresh basil and mozzarella. The kosher salt on the veggies was really tasty and the pesto/balsalmic drizzle was a nice extra level of flavor.  Our mains were the lasagna and spaghetti pomodoro. The lasagna was really excellent and had beef, pork and veal between cheesy layers of pasta swimming in a scrumptious San Marzano tomato sauce that I found myself mopping up with their crusty fresh Italian bread. My wife loved her pasta too and said that it had some nice heat to it. But, that could be because she dumps a mound of red chili flakes on just about everything she eats.  We finished with a few gelatos and sorbettos, which are house made. We had the Espresso, Chocolate chip and black cherry and all were very good. The chocolate chip being my favorite of the bunch.  Service was great and they had our salad split without asking. Our waiter was really helpful and let us know a little about their dish sizes and what a few good eaters could put away.

The place was moderately crowded but for a Sat night, it there was plenty of room.  We literally had the worst table in the house.  The dining room is on a harsh angle and the table was tight where the waitstaff was bussing tables back and forth.  There were plenty of tables that we could have gotten but the hostesses spent about 40 seconds when we arrived to put us there.  Off to a bad start.  We were wicked hungry so the wife ordered the bruschetta and I wanted the prosciutto di parma with melon.  The order came out on floor tiles that were stacked on those pizza racks that lift the pizza up on the table.  The table was for two and these towers of pranzo dominated the table. We had to send in the demo crew so we can see each other.  The bruschetta was a ""deconstructed"" trio of chicken liver, bean and mint, and tomato.  The liver was great.  The mint and bean was exactly that.  Minty beans and the tomato was fresh but boring.  So one of three was great, the others was ok.  The prosciutto was good, served with honeydew and cantaloupe.  A common pairing.  This was good but who can mess that up? For dinner I had a pizza that was reminiscent of a Roman pizza.  It was ok.  I was expecting something great from the woodfired oven but it just didn't do it.  My wife had the lasagna.  I could not recommend this to anyone.  It had braised beef in the center that added a nice flavor, but what dominated the dish was the pesto.  The pesto covered the top of the lasagna and had a very strong lemon flavor.  And lasagna that tastes like lemon and basil doesn't do it for me.  When we were leaving I saw a couple that both ordered the lasagna.  I felt bad because who do you mooch off of when you ordered the same thing?   So in closing, I thought that this was not a $100 meal after a few drinks and apps.  This meal wouldn't even make my list of top 50 Italian joints.",0.9364,0.801,0.114,0.085,0.5219817927170869

We ordered a selection of meats and cheese as an appetizer, one of the cheeses was not on the menu, but was highly suggested by our waiter, definitely a good choice.  We then ordered 2 pizzas for the 4 of us, the clam pizza and the prosciutto and arugula pizza.  Both were very delicious. The clam pizza, while a bit weird at the thought, was excellent, the saltiness of the clams mixed with the rest of the pizza, the creamy salty cheese, the crust and the sauce.  WOW, I was impressed.  The prosciutto and arugula was also excellent, with the arugula put on at the last minute, so it hadn't wilted.  Delicious! Finally, we ordered gelato and a piece of tiramisu.  From the sampling of gelato we had, the only flavors that seemed to be really good were pistachio and the chocolate.  In the end, it's still gelato and very delicious, so it's hard to complain!  The tiramisu was very good, reasonably portioned (not HUGE like some places) but still very flavorful and light, the way tiramisu should be.   The atmosphere was nice and classy, but we were still comfortable dressed a bit down (shorts and loafers).  The only real drawback that I felt while we were there was more than once we felt a little abandoned by our waiter.  To his credit, he did his best to make sure we were ok when he did come around.

I'm a huge fan of being outside so I stopped at A Mano on a whim when I saw the ""$10 wine carafes"" (the Tuesday special) sign outside the patio.  I split a 5-star wild mushroom pizza with my boyfriend (although he wasn't a fan of the hazelnuts on it-- more for me!) and people walking by heard stuff like ""Oh mfff gahhhhfff"" as I would ecstatically stuff whole slices in my mouth at a time.  I couldn't get enough and will be returning to try the clam pizza.  I will most definitely be returning on Thursdays for their $5 pizzas-- $12 is pushing it normally but still worth the amazing taste.  $5 however is an f-ing steal. The second plus is the people watching.  It's below ground level and we could watch people going up and down Dearborn.  If you consider people-watching a sport, you'll love this place.  Some people might not like the feeling of being below ground or catching a sliver of the traffic below, but I thought it was great. Why I deducted a star: the carafes were mini!  I know it's a special and getting as much as we did for $10 is better than what we normally would have paid but... totally not worth it as a special.  Other places serve much better happy hour deals (ahem Flemings and McCormick & Schmick's).",0.9904,0.745,0.195,0.06,0.48056795634920635

We ordered a clam pizza, a risotto, and fingerling potatoes on the side. The pizza was just ok. The clams came in the shell, which I thought was kind of weird, although I suppose the presentation looked better. The flavor was decent but I didn't really enjoy the crust. To me, it was almost like a hot pocket crust. Ok, maybe not exactly to that extent, but really similar. The suckling pig risotto was way too salty and had a little bit of the shredded pig. I think it was around $16 or so and it was a pretty small portion. Not impressed. And the side of fingerling potatoes were $6 and probably had only 10 slices. So not worth it.

The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the open and brightly lit kitchen. It's the centerpiece of the entire restaurant. One of the coolest open kitchens I've ever seen. We were seated right away, and were greeted with an 'interesting' waiter.   He was well rehearsed in his 'these are the specials' spcheal, which meant it lacked personality. He was kinda hard to understand (pretty sure he was Italian)  He was a bit pushy, and didn't seem very happy that we were only going to order a few glasses of wine and split a pizza. Once we finished, our plates and glasses were quickly whisked away by our bus boy. After feeling rushed, we finished up our wine, and paid the bill.  This is another great date place or a fun place to go with a group of people.  It looks like their's going to be a pretty cool outside patio for the summer.  I'll go back and try it out.

2008-04-21,4.0,"***UPDATE*** My boyf and I went to A Mano AGAIN!  It's not often that I return to a restaurant.  It's even rarer that I will go back within a WEEK!  Yes, A Mano is that good. We sat in the lounge this time, and took advantage of the $5 pizzas.  This time we got the sausage with potato pizza.  The sausage was friggin good, but I wish there had been more potatoes, and that they had been sliced thinner. One surprising new discovery--the mole salumi!!!  I was skeptical, since I can be a bit of a traditionalist sometimes...mexican mole seasoning at an italian place?!  But it was SO good!  Nice spicy kick!  Try it immediately! A Mano is turning me into a gelato lover.  This time we tried the vanilla, pistachio and gianduja--OH YUMMO.  The pistachio is honestly THE BEST pistachio I have EVER had.  Pistachio is my favorite ice cream flavor, and this was the truest flavor that I have ever tasted.  And what is gianduja you ask?  It is a mix of chocolate and hazelnut, just like Nutella, and it is AWESOME!    *** I love small plates!  I hate looking at a menu full of delicious temptation and then having to pick only 1 or 2 things to eat as my appetizer and entree.  With small plates, I can have everything my little heart (and big appetite) desires!   Our server on Friday night was great.  Not only was she pleasant, but she was also very helpful and made some wonderful suggestions for our dinner!   1 thing I love about A Mano - they offer half carafes of wine!  This too, goes along with my ""I wanna try everything!"" personality.  Each carafe is about 2.5 glasses.  A carafe is about the same as half a bottle of wine, and the price reflects that, so don't think you're getting jipped if you order carafes.  We were trying to decide between a couple red wines, and our server suggested that we start with a lighter red, and then progress to our heavier choice later in the meal, which worked out perfectly! A Mano also filters their own water, so if you want still water, it is filtered tap water, which they bring out in bottles for your table.  Nice!   A Mano offers a variety of antipasti, and they are all $5, so definitely try a few!  We started with the baby octopus salad, which was quite delicious, it tasted like the ocean!  We also got a bit of salumi--our server suggested the culatello, which she described as ""the filet mignon of salumi"".  We mentioned that we were surprised not to see any cheese offerings on the menu--they DO have cheese, but it is listed on the Dessert menu.  Just ask what cheeses they have, you won't regret it!  We had a cheese trio, including an AMAZING dolce gorgonzola!  Cheese plates come with a great nut bread, candied fruit and super tasty caramelized onions!   Next we had the mushroom and onion pizza, which was so deliciously aromatic, since it's drizzled with truffle oil.  YUM.  We also had the spinach & shrimp risotto, which might have been my favorite dish of the night!  WOW, so rich and flavorful!  The rice was just BARELY undercooked--I wouldn't even have noticed unless my boyfriend/personal chef hadn't said anything.  The pastas are also small portions, so don't feel like you will be stuffing yourself if you order one.  I would definitely like to try the gnocchi with rabbit next time, but ALL the pastas sounded really tasty!     We didn't order any entrees, but I would really like to try the whole sea bass with the salt crust!   Now, for dessert.  After a dinner that left me floating on a cloud of foodie happiness, dessert was not as exciting as I wanted it to be.  We decided on gelato and the cheesecake with balsamic reduction.  There are some really great flavor offerings on the gelato menu--we chose espresso, chocolate, and mascarpone.  None of the gelati were overly sweet, but had great flavor.  Apparently the chef went to a Gelato University--I'm not making this up, I read it in Chicago magazine!  The only one I didn't like was the mascarpone, which I don't think tasted anything like mascarpone, boo.  As for the cheesecake, I resisted my urge to get something chocolaty in favor of something new.  The cheesecake had a great presentation, and while I like cheesecake, and I like balsamic reduction, I just don't think I like them TOGETHER.  If you are looking for something not too sweet, it might be a good choice for you.  If you want a big hunk of decadent cheesecake, this isn't it!   Overall, I had a really wonderful experience at A Mano, and I will DEFINITELY be back!  I think the lounge could be a great place to have a light bite--some apps and a carafe of wine, perhaps.  This place can get pretty loud when it's full, so go early or during the week if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner!   The Tab: baby octopus salad culatello salumi cheese trio mushroom & onion pizza spinach & shrimp risotto gelato trio cheesecake w/ balsamic reduction 2 carafes of wine 1 espresso  1 coffee --------------------- $120",0.9998,0.734,0.255,0.011,0.5473986856516977

For an entree I had the Tuna burger.  It was good, but again, not great.  A little bit of lemon goes a long way, and the lemon flavor of my tuna burger over powered the taste of the tuna.   There was a buffet option for lunch (not sure if they have it for dinner as well) this option might be a great way to taste more of the menu, but after the taste that I had...

It did not disappoint -- I absolutely love potatoes on pizza now! The pizza was good,  a little greasy, but good.  The pizza is thinner/crisper than Quartino's, which I loved.  We had the Pumpkin Ravioli (which was savory) and the pappardelle with braised boar and raisins.  We also ordered the Monkfish, which unfortunately, had pine nuts (which I had inquired/informed the waitress upfront about).  Unfortunately, there was no description in the menu about pine nuts.  Luckily, my gf tried it first and warned me -- we immediately called the waitress over, and she was literally shocked, and then very apologetic.  Even though my gf only took one bite, we kept the dish (for free), and we ordered the special fish of the night (can't remember what it was now).   After a couple bottles of wine, we didn't have room for dessert.  Since the waitress still felt very bad about the pine nuts, she comp'd us gelato for the night -- which was extremely nice.

So while the meal started off great, everything else we had was flawed. The pumpkin ravioli was good but too much like a dessert with its cinnamon sugar sauce. The mushroom risotto, salty. The gnocchi, salty. it was the first gnocchi I tried where I could actually taste the potato but then it ended quickly and all I could taste was salt. We did end on a higher note with yummy marscapone and hazlenut gelatos and a nice, not too rich chocolate torte.  It sounds like we got alot of food but the portions (except for the pizza) are on the smaller side. We were surprised at how high the bill was, but then found out that our server gave us and charged us for full portions of some of our dishes when we had asked for half...kind of annoying especially when the full portions looked like half portions.",0.974,0.812,0.145,0.043,0.5996428571428573
2007-11-18,3.0,"I should probably start by thanking the very nice hostess for squeezing my group of 4 in for 7:45 reservations even though they were booked until 9:30.  My friends and I have been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened 5 weeks ago so we were excited to get last minute reservations.  That being said I should know better than to try a restaurant within the first few months....A Mano, like most new restaurants, still has their share of kinks to work out. The meal started off pretty well. The waiter was very accommodating and let us picky winos taste a few different wines so we could figure out which one we wanted to order.  Then we placed the order for our food. While the waiter was explaining the menu some blood dripped from his hand on to my friends place mat. Yes, ummm.....ewww. He looked really embarrassed, explained he just opened a bottle of wine...so he wiped off the blood and then rushed off to get a band aid.  These things happen, but what bothered me is that he didn't bring my friend a new place mat so she said there for the rest of the meal looking at the blood stain on her place mat.  Yeah, kind of gross, but moving on... So we decided on the scallops, mushrooms, peppers with goat cheese, sausage and potato pizza, a half order of the mushroom risotto, and a half order of the gnochetti.  Everything looked really good and we were getting hungry so we were anxiously awaiting this food.  So we waited, and waited, and waited...it took over an hour for them to get us our food! And we just kept drinking our wine and getting hungrier (not to mention more  intoxicated) as the night wore on. We checked in with the waiter several times and even suggested he bring things out one at a time (since we were sharing a bunch of small plates), but he said that's not how they do things here.  Well, A Mano...I think you may need to change your ways or you're going to lose many customers! Just a tip...;) FINALLY the food arrived! And I have to admit it was pretty good- I especially liked the scallops, the mushrooms, and the risotto.  The pizza had potential, but it was absolutely burnt on the bottom(totally black).  We ate it anyway because at this point we were going to eat anything! We were still pretty hungry when we finished our meal (every dish is SO small), but not having another lifetime to spare to wait for our food we decided to just order some sorbet for dessert.  The sorbet wasn't anything special, but it did the trick of filling us up... The waiter did take care of some of our meal at the end of the night- he took the burnt pizza off the bill, as well as some wine and one of the sorbets.  But this was to be expected after the long wait and blood we had served with our meal.  Overall, A Mano has some potential.  They need to move things along in the kitchen much faster, but they have a good menu and the restaurant itself is really cute (gotta love the open kitchen). One of my friends commented that it's very similar to Quartino and with Quartino being right around the corner she's not sure why she could come to A Mano.  Part of me agrees with that (quartino's prices seem more reasonable), but I'd be willing to give A Mano another shot... just probably not until after the New Year to give them some time to work out those kinks.",0.9947,0.839,0.122,0.038,0.5577712701242113

I had to complain just to get our wine orders. Once the food came the SERVING SIZES WERE TINY- a ""full pasta"" order was less than a handful and the clam pizza was unimpressive (watch out- shells included). Our appetizer was a few leaves of arugula with a dab of goat cheese and some peppers. Everyone LEFT STILL HUNGRY. It took so long that I was late for my after-dinner plans.

2007-11-03,4.0,"I dined at A Mano last week after a friend recommended it for a late night dinner. It's located next to Marina Towers, House of Blues, and directly under Bin 35 (I think they are sister restaurants or they share a wine list). This restaurant is brand new and you can tell. The decor is very nice with it's exposed brick walls, candles, comfortable pillows if you sit in the right spot, and a bit loud. The kitchen is exposed, as well as the brick oven. We arrived and were immediately greeted and seated by very nice and pleasant hosts (yes, plural, two people sat us). I was on a first date so we both were craving a drink, and fast to cut the edge. After a few moments of not having a server we were greeted by the hipster looking manager. He was very pleasant, went over the complicated menu and wine list. He did take the drink order. He was then followed by servers (yes, plural again- they must use the buddy system here???), They tried to take the drink order again, went over the menu again, and left us to chat. Even though I had the menu explained to me twice I still do not understand what I was supposed to do. They told me that some plates you share, and some you don't but this is not clearly outlined on the menu what goes where and how to order. This is supposed to be Italian food but there were no dishes on the menu that screamed Italian. My date and I ordered a brick oven pizza and a weird salad to be on the safe side. They brought a salad that was not a salad, rather an antipasti. The plate was nothing more than three leaves of lettuce, two slim slices of pepper, and goat cheese. Hello?? Why is there a French guy in my Italian restaurant? The antipasti was so small a child would have had to order two plates to fill up. The pizza came out and despite the waitress serving us the wrong pizza (we ordered veggies and were served sausage), it was delicious. We didn't complain. The problems with the service are minor and I think they are just so new that they need to work out the kinks. I am sure that the next time I visit they will be squared away and more organized. I am pissed at Metromix because they were there doing the new restaurant review thing and didn't interview me and my date, but the couple next to us. You might see me in the background so at least my hair made the shot. Kudos to the waitress for comping me a glass of wine. I will always return to a restaurant that comps me a drink. I didn't complain about anything so I think she was just being nice, or enjoyed us as customers. I have a rule I learned from my uncle that if I visit a restaurant, or mainly a bar more than a few times and they do not buy me at least one drink, then they do not really want my business or know how to win a customer. Sometimes restaurants and bars forget that they are indeed in the hospitality business and no one was forced to dine there. That is how I weed out the good and the bad.... They passed the test! I recommend A Mano as a date place because it is loud and hip. The food portions are small which is good because who wants to eat like a pig on a date anyway. The bill was surprisingly cheap even though we ordered a few wines. I was so happy I over tipped. This restaurant is for tourists, and first or second dates.",0.9938,0.819,0.128,0.053,0.4709209441352297
2007-10-30,3.0,"This ristorante italiano just opended, so my rating may be a little harsh.  The atmosphere is clean and cool, and I did like the shared sinks in front of the bathrooms - this was a lil touch of europa! The service was very confusing and quite annoying.  For example, the food runners brought out 2 half portions of gnocchetti instead of just one full portion, we weren't sure why and it was just for one person.   They gave us free gelato, the hazlenut was smooth and authentic!, but then charged us $4 a piece per tiny ball.  They did not bring out the vegetables I ordered, but charged for them too.  The service was very sloppy - of course we complained and everything was then alright.   The dishes are a little bit too small to be considered european, this is more like european kid portions.  But, the amatriciana was excellent.  The gnocciale was superb, and was house cured, and the prosciuto and tuscan meat was perfect too.  The food overall was quite solid, and I would like to see some olives added to the menu.   I will go back, and I hope the service is better, and maybe they will figure out how to plate a full pasta meal - but the food is good.",0.9887,0.739,0.2,0.061,0.5150185185185184
