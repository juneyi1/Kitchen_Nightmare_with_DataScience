2017-04-30,5.0,"SushiX delivers a unique sushi experience and is definitely worth a try! What I love is when you are welcomed with a smile and friendly service. That is what you definitely get at SushiX as it is a petite sized restaurant with big time personality! We told the waitress this was our first time dining with them and she said we would get a free dessert (chocolate peanut butter which was delicious). Can I get a Hell yeah!  Let's get to the important part of this review: the food. It is worth noting that this sushi spot is BYOB so come prepared with a couple bottles of wine. As far as the food- there are various options while not overwhelming you like a normal Thai restaurant menu. My girlfriend and I really liked how they offer salads and sushi bowls (similar to poke). We ordered tuna/salmon $6 rolls which are basic and how we like our sushi. We also enjoyed an ahi tuna salad ($9), beef bowl ($15), and I ate the whole shrimp gyoza dish ($6). As you can see everything is reasonably priced as we walked out very full for $80 total (tax and tip included). To quickly summarize, everything we ordered was delicious. The sushi is good but I liked the salad and beef bowl the best. You get a ton of raw tuna on the salad which for $9 is a bang for your buck. The beef bowl offer copious amounts of beef and is like a huge beef fried rice. I enjoyed the shrimp gyoza too as it was light & not fried.  One piece of advice is that I would change the menu to read the normal way as everything is listed from back to the front. It reminded me of Hebrew and reading left to right.. The Waitress said they are making slight changes to the menu in a few weeks. I would keep the food items as they are, however, I would list apps and salads on the front.

Although we arrived before another couple, they were given the option of seating before us. Sadly, that caused us to be seated in front of the entrance although we had just previously shared we didn't want to sit there once the tables opened up.The problem was the staff must have had an out of body experience and forgot we were customers. One literally was like well they are seated already and her expression was so sit here or get lost. The other lady was trying to side with us because she knew we had been waiting but was getting nowhere with the other staff person. Eventually, they both came back and did a reset. They offered to move us once a table opened up and then closed the door for us when we opted to stay because I think we would have just left. Once we were settled in, we were able to focus on the menu. The options were plentiful from a variety of starters to rice-less rolls (zero), to deconstructed bowls to a massive selection of rolls. I had the miso (spicy) and it was spicy! I appreciated it and it was quite sizeable! I then opted for the Japan-A-Wrap - it was interesting.. the cilantro and basil was overpowering and lacked texture. The fish was F R E S H!

It's left a deep un-fillable sushi hole.   I do not like writing such negatives reviews but my last experience with sushi X was miserable.  My friend and I excitedly placed an order and this is what happened: 8:05 PM--Place order the phone. They quote us 60-90 minutes. We thought that was pretty long but fine, we like their sushi.   9:35 PM--We call to check on our status. They claim they left the food on the counter and the delivery guy made a mistake. Okay, kinda of sucks but s*** happens. He informs me that is calling an uber driver to deliver the food to me because the deliver driver will not be back for a while, and we have been waiting forever (obviously.)  10:00 PM--Still no food so we call them back. The guy who previously took our order and claimed an Uber was delivering it is surprised that the food is not here yet. He put us on hold to ""call the driver"" and came back claiming that the driver was 5 minutes away. [By the way we are about 4-5 minute drive from sushi x... we were hung over.. don't judge, you've been there ha]   10:20 PM--Still no food.  10:28 PM--Food gets here. No chopsticks or utensils. ""Uber"" driver states he's been outside and has been trying to call. Makes some claims about the app not working, not sure what he is referring to. The driver clearly was NOT an uber driver--he was apologetic about the late delivery which you would never do if he was just an uber driver. 10:32 PM--We eat and my poor unfortunate friend finds a piece of plastic in his Sushi X bowl. Wow.. this sucks. We call back and Sushi X confirms this meal will be free and will be compensating us with a $20 for our trials and tribulation. That was helpful and a friendly gesture but come on, our food took 2.5 hours and had plastic in it.

You'll notice really cool artwork on the walls and your fellow dining companions enjoying their BYOB beer and wine right off the bat--I like it already. We started off with some edamame and the creamy ginger salad. The salad comes already VERY heavily dressed with a thick dressing so if that isn't your thing, order it on the side. I was starving and thought it was great.  Here's the thing that earned 5 stars from us: REAL fresh crab in the maki rolls instead of that fake stuff. My fiancé (bless his heart) is allergic to fish so any restaurant who tries to pass off their imitation crab as the real thing could potentially kill him! As you can imagine, dining out for sushi is always interesting for us. He ordered the spicy scallop roll and another one that included the crap--I couldn't remember because I was too busy frantically trying to pick from all the delicious looking choices--but he happily devoured every last bite so I know they were good.

2016-05-11,2.0,"Visiting Chicago and was craving sushi.  There was non-metered street parking in front.  There is a large mural directly to the left of the front door- so you can't miss it driving by.  Showed up around 6pm on Sunday- there was only one other table seated.  One other party showed up while we were there.  Pretty low-key place. Ordered edamame appetizer- served warm and salted.  Ordered the sashimi ""mini"" which comes with 6 pieces (2 each of 3 different types of fish).  Fish was generously sliced (larger than the rice underneath) but was slimier than it should have been.  Also ordered the rainbow roll and the spicy tuna roll.  Both were a huge let down.  The rainbow roll was covered in more avocado than fish.  The spicy tuna roll was bland.  Both rolls had rice that seemed undercooked- very crunchy.  Ugh, so disappointed.",-0.4589,0.861,0.076,0.063,0.5531746031746031

We got the tempura green beans, but had to order two since the first order was cold.  The gentleman who served us rushed another round over.  We also had edamame, which was standard, and the veggie potstickers.  The potstickers were my favorite thing of the night.  We each ordered a plain roll and one p the fancier options.  All three ""fancies"" we're meh.  I ended up picking the maguro and super white tuna out since the rice was a bit hard and the roll as a whole had too much cilantro and was just meh.  Sorry for all the mehs again, but it's the best word I can use to describe the bland tasteless dinner.

Then, our server brought one menu, telling us they couldn't give us two because ""there is a big party taking them all"".  Then we asked if we could switch to the table we were told we could switch to. The server said, ""oh wait, the hostess said you could do that? Hold on.""  She proceeded to consult the hostess, and after they decided not to let us sit at the other table, the hostess shouted from across the restaurant, ""Oh sorry!""

Sushi X, on the other hand, I don't love as much. I ordered delivery from Sushi X and while quick and prompt with their service, I couldn't eat half of my order due to the quality of the fish. I got a SPICY SALAD with spicy tuna that came with avocado and spicy mayo dressing. I asked for little (or no) mayo and the restaurant definitely honored that request by omitting the mayo from the dressing. That said, perhaps it's because I altered the dressing but the fish, itself, tasted RANCID. It smelled fishy, it tasted fishy... it made me gag. I could not stomach the salad and ended up throwing it away, much to my great dismay. I also got a SILVER HAZE BOWL with sashimi, lettuce, cucumber, scallions, masago, shiso leaf, carrots, daikon and soybean sprouts, sesame oil, nori flakes, and silver haze sauce (spicy red pepper vinegar sauce). This is basically your Korean ""hwe dup bap"" but better. I loved the julienned daikon and carrots but felt like the raw soybean sprouts were too potent and detracted from the other flavors. The silver haze sauce is essentially Korean ""cho-gochujang"" and was very welcome because IT IS SURPRISINGLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT IN CHICAGO /end rant. Again, some of the fish tasted rancid so I had to pick them out but, overall, after picking out the soybean sprouts and rancid fish, this was an excellent entree and I would order again.

I thought it was a cute place because my partner is into anime and they have it playing on a wall with a projector with no sound, only music.  The place is fairly small but roomy. The place was dark and lit with candles and some light. I liked it. The place is not as loud as I thought either. There was a boy and his mom sitting 3 feet from us and he was crawling on the floor and looking around looking for a toy in the place and I guess he one something, like a game. It was distracting and the place looked unprofessional.  Immediately after picking our table we received paper menus and glasses of water. We started of with the Godzilla roll since I read on here a lot of people enjoy/recommend it. It was my favorite from this place sadly out of 4 rolls. This sushi roll took about 10 min to get to our table. Wasn't even a lot of people. I though they took forever. We got 3 rolls after that and that was it. We got the omega, spider and black widow. Tasted like they out panko in all the rolls. The presentation wasn't worth taking a picture. They all sounded pretty amazing except I wasn't impressed. The tempura tuna in the Omega wasn't as good. The sushi rolls weren't rolled tight. They were falling apart as I tried picking up some pieces. My partner called them amateurs under her breath. I don't wanna  disrespect anyone's hard work in this place but I called this cheap sushi. Not the best I've had.  The service was okay. We certainly didn't get as much attention as the other tables.  At the end I paid $63 for all 4 rolls which is decent for the sushi I usually eat. But I felt ripped off because the rolls were disappointing. I don't wanna give them one star because it wasn't the worst place but 2 stars because the sushi was sad. I will not be back here.",0.943,0.778,0.127,0.095,0.5893815708101422

I was hoping this would be a new go-to for sushi take out but I'm really hesitant to give it another try. Pros: some of the rolls were quite good. Cons: one of the rolls came with mango in, and on top of it. I know I would never order a roll with mango as I am very allergic, but thought I probably read the menu wrong or something. Mango wasn't listed on the menu but was put on the roll. Not really a fun surprise, when I called to let them know my order was not only incorrect, but that I was allergic to the ingredient they added, the employee on the phone asked what I wanted in return for the mistake. While I asked for a refund for the roll, I just thought it was a little insensitive due to the error being a food allergy issue...and now I had less food! The other thing that really irritated me was the portion of the tuna tartare. I am not sure if they give a smaller portion with to-go orders or if this is their norm, but it was SUCH a sad portion size for $14. It was tiny and there was NO tuna in comparison to all the accompaniments. Really a shame. Ordered a ROK bowl that also lacked flavor, maybe this is better in the restaurant? Not a good experience in general and for that, it makes it difficult to try out again, especially for around $15 a roll.",-0.9677,0.759,0.085,0.156,0.5182753460531239

2014-10-30,3.0,"I have been to Sushi X twice now and held out writing a review. The first time a friend and I arrived we bailed after waiting 20 minutes with no end in sight. The place doesn't have a waiting area which is inconvenient to say the least. If I have to wait for a table at least give me somewhere to stand and maybe enjoy a glass of wine or beer while I am waiting. On a side note, the place is BYOB, which everyone loves.  Attempt #2: Same friend and I met again and decided to pop in early in hopes of getting a table. Mission accomplished! The whole place is somewhat small and can get loud but I feel that is to be expected in most trendy places nowadays. We started out with the usual edamame and gyoza. They were pretty typical with what is served at other sushi places. We ordered from the Mega side of the menu. The dragon fly was great, the sushi fruit was different (not to my liking) and another staple, the spider. There is a reason these are on the ""mega"" side of the menu. The portions are exactly what they say - mega.  Attempt #1: My friend and I met at Sushi X again dinner. Again we were seated right away. We got there around 6:30 pm on a Saturday this time. This time we thought we would venture out of our normal appetizers, so we tried the sashimi carpaccio. There were nice cuts and variety of sashimi and I enjoyed the lightly balsamic touch. We ventured out on the menu you a little more this time. We ordered from the Zero section - bombshell, which I was pleasantly surprised. We also ordered the Red Dragon from the Inside Out section of the menu,  The various ideas Sushi X has are cool. Both times I was happy with the quality of the fish, however, when a sushi requires two or three bites I get a little annoyed. I want to be able to enjoy the roll in its entirety.  The atmosphere is very upbeat, however, the place is somewhat cramped and can get very noisy. Each time we were here street parking was relatively easy; however, I have a feeling that is not always the case.",0.9936,0.822,0.149,0.029,0.562862950058072

Not the typical soothing sushi restaurant vibe I prefer. The punny sushi roll names and fun design of the menu did help a bit to distract me from the chaotic vibe of the place.

Shortly after placing the online order, a Seamless employee called me to say that Sushi X called them to say that one of the items we ordered (veggie gyoza) was ""too heavy"" and they couldn't make it. (??) A few minutes later, a Sushi X employee called me and spent five minutes complaining about how terrible Seamless is, how their customer service is awful, it's a horrible organization, etc., and that next time I should order through GrubHub or the restaurant directly. Okay...fine. She clarifies the gyoza thing (which still didn't make sense), and says the delivery guy is walking out the door with my order.  Forty-five minutes later, nothing. I call Sushi X back and talk to a very hyper and defensive guy who says the delivery guy ""left his cell phone at the restaurant"" so he can't call him to check on our food. He says I need to wait a full 60 minutes before he can ""make it up to me."" Not encouraging. Needless to say, the delivery guy never showed up so I called back and the same hyper guy answered and was even more defensive and rude. I said we wanted to cancel the order, and he seemed pleasantly surprised... like he was glad that is all I wanted to rectify the situation. Sounded like this wasn't the first time customers were unhappy with their delivery service. Anyways, I asked him to confirm it would be cancelled and we wouldn't be charged. Yes, yes of course, he assured me and hung up.  My husband checked his online cc statement and what do you know... Sushi X charged us for the full order. Can't wait to call back and deal with that.

Got in around 6:30pm and snatched one of the last 4 top tables there so that was a positive since I hate waiting, especially during winter weather in Chicago. The atmosphere is a little too funky for me with a big screen monitor playing Japanese cartoons and such. There's music as well, which got a little too loud at one point, but despite those things, we still had a great time and definitely enjoyed our sushi. So onto the goodies, we started with a spicy tuna salad for $9 which was a decent portion of tons of spicy tuna with spicy mayo and siracha, some avocado pieces on top a bed of lettuce, definitely recommend it. We also got an edamame which was a large portion as well while we waited for our creative and super size make rolls to be made and let me tell you that these rolls were huge. Some of them barely made it in my mouth, they were big so although on the pricier side, they were worth it.  -Honey roll for $8 had white tuna, tempura flakes, cucumber, honey sesame mayo. One of the smaller rolls but definitely worth it. -Godzilla roll for $14 which happened to be my favorite one and is definitely worth the hype here had tempura shrimp, siracha, scallions, roe, cream cheese, tempura flakes, avocado, mayo, topped w/ eel sauce and wasabi mayo. Seriously, get it now! -Double Stack for $16 (this one was what my hubby really wanted since it had plenty of raw fish for him to eat, but I have to say I didn't love it, maybe I'm just not a fan of cilantro in my sushi but it was made of tuna, albacore, salmon, cilantro, jalapeno, avocado, mayo, roe, citrus chili ponzu. Definitely an adventure item. So the sushi was awesome overall and definitely filling because the rolls were huge in size and pieces. So the best part was when our super sweet server saw me take a pic of the gorgeousness she said ""hey, if you upload your picture at sushi X on instagram, I'll get you a free dessert."" Now that gets a star in itself. I love that kind of service, since I would have probably done it anyway. We ended up trying the mango mousse cake with some mochi ice cream, which was light and a great way to end the meal. So Sushi X is definitely worth trying if you're in the area for some good sushi and great service.

The ""bar"" was set up in one section, it's really BYOB, appetizers were spread throughout the middle, so we could walk around and hang out before sitting down for dinner. The sushi ""buffet"" was set on the front counter, and they labelled everything/had a menu out so everyone could see what they were eating. You know how suburb folks are [super intimidated] about sushi ;) The ambiance is very urban, the actual space is almost diagonal, or even a little Alice in Wonderland since the space gets smaller as you walk from one side to the other side. There is a big screen with a movie playing, but muted, so the guests can enjoy the music playing. It's pretty dim, more than most restaurants but not so much where you would run into someone. The color of choice is black - black interior: black walls, black table, as well as a black exterior. Anyway, let's get to the best part, THE SUSHI! I have had a few sushi misses lately and was really hesitant to jump back on the wagon. This is probably the very best sushi I've ever had, and I have had A LOT. The best rolls were the red dragon, honey, shrimp tempura, and white dragon. Everything is fresh and tasty, although some combinations sound questions (lettuce in sushi?? this place makes it delicious) The spicy tuna salad, coconut shrimp, veggie gyoza, and beef wrapped asparagus are the best appetizers. (Yes, I eat a lot) The spicy tuna salad is probably something I could eat every day if I had my own person Sushi X chef, but unforunately I am stuck to cafeteria salads. Off topic.

Packing was great, no rolling rolls or anything. I had: 1. The house salad with ginger dressing. Nice spring green mix. Ginger dressing was creamy, thin thousand island consistency but yummy.  2.  Spicy shrimp roll. A TON of shrimp which was great, though may have more spicy mayo than some may like.  3.  Crab Rangoon roll. Holy hell this was a big roll. It's extremely rich because of the amount of cream cheese but it does have literally equal if not more wonderful crab. After the first couple pieces I ended up biting off the half of each piece with the crab because so rich. It is tempura--I thought the avocado would be tempura inside the roll, but it was the entire roll. Although not what I expected, for a tempura-ed roll, it was not over battered and not overly greasy. I think it was supposed to come with a sweet chili dipping sauce, but mine came with just soy.  4.  Caterpillar roll. Great, again, TONs of eel and yellow tuna. Didn't overdo the eel sauce, which I appreciate.   5.  Dragon roll. Good, shrimp wasn't over-tempura-ed and eel sauce didn't overpower the flavor of the roll. Also beautifully prepared avocado.  So, short is, very good sushi. Lots of fish/shrimp/eel and avocado. I will order again.",0.9938,0.75,0.207,0.043,0.5521153846153847
2013-11-17,5.0,"Looking around for sushi in the 60610 area, we had quite a limited choice of places that looked good but weren't too expensive either. We found Sushi X on Yelp, and decided a 10 minute cab ride was worth it to give this restaurant a chance, especially after seeing all the delicious photos on their Instagram account. To be honest, it is quite small inside, probably sitting no more than 25-30 people total. They play music in their, so you do have to speak a little louder but it matches the ambiance they put out. The waitstaff are very attentive and nice, and are quite familiar with the menu. They have a wide variety of different rolls, and different kinds of rolls as well, such a rice-less options. We opted to start with the Oyster Shooters and Salmon Nigiri, both of which were extremely fresh. It is also well-worth noting that they have very reasonable prices and feature a special roll every month to be half-off. Moving on to the rolls, we ordered the Lava roll, the Godzilla roll, and the Double Stack roll. Their presentation was very nice and creative and the sushi was all as delicious as it looked. The Instagram photos really did them justice! The Lava roll was a bit heavy on the cream cheese side, but it still was absolutely tasty and melted right in your mouth. The Godzilla is a huge roll, it must have been about 12 pieces and the flavors blended perfectly. Finally, the Double Stack was a bit more ""regular"" compared to the first two rolls, but it did not disappoint either.  We finished off the meal with a few varieties of the Mochi Ice Cream, but we'd recommend you stick with Mango and Strawberry, as the chocolate was not very good. We couldn't catch a cab leaving the restaurant and it was pouring rain outside. This is where their customer service really shined as they tried everything they could to help us get one. They called every company they could multiple times to try helping us. This really stood out to me! Overall, Sushi X receives an A+ due to how delicious and fresh everything was, how great the staff is, and how great of a time we had. We are definitely going to make this place one of our regular sushi places to go to in the city.",0.9986,0.773,0.218,0.01,0.5296677132391416

We had the Five-0 which was quite good but dried meat just doesn't come with the same freshness that you would expect of sushi, so I'll pass next time.

After waiting an hour and 20 minutes for my delivery that was promised to me between 45 minutes and an hour,I received a cold disgusting roll. I ordered the lava roll without cream cheese. The spicy tuna inside although ""dipped"" in tempura does not usually mean that it tastes like tuna fish salad. I called to complain about this item and the guy who picked up basically said it was my fault and if I had ordered a pizza a specific way I couldn't send it back so it basically way my fault. He said they were busy when I called or otherwise would have instructed me to order something else since they obviously knew I was a new customer. Great customer service. If I were in the restaurant I totally would have sent it back. The way I made the roll doesn't effect the fact it tasted horribly.  My husband ordered the sushi fruit. The chef decided to add some pineapple sauce on the top.  This ingredient  was not on the menu at all.  It basically tasted like sugar on fish and was inedible. Another disappointment. When I called to discuss the problem they said they would credit this to my account after the guy had to check with the chef. He wouldn't even put it back on my credit card. Do you really think I am going back after this horrible experience? So basically I just got a credit for nothing since I won't be going back.

The front door and lighting do give the place a club like atmosphere. But this is not a dine-to-be-seen establishment. It has under 10 tables, creating a somewhat intimate dining experience. Also, if you squint you can spot other late night diners in scrubs and yoga pants.  I can recommend the salads they are a great low carb choice. My favorite is Spicy Tuna Salad. Also, don't miss the Tuna Tacos under the cold fusion section. As far as maki's I always stay away from tempura and lean toward cleaner options, which can be a little tricky here. Caterpillar and Sashimi roll are my go-tos.  Sushi X is BYOB!

Good thing we like each other!  We split a creamy ginger salad which easily was enough for two people. But for some reason it tasted like thousand island dressing with some ginger spice thrown in. Then we ordered the maki roll of the week, I forget what it was called but it had avocado, salmon, two different sauces, jalapeño and some major crunch!  Not to mention it was the size of two maki rolls for half off- $4 That plus the spicy crunch tuna roll was just the amount of food to satisfy.

Service: Great! Servers were all really nice and we had several people come to our table, explaining, replenishing water, recommending, etc. Wonderful!  Food: I admit I had no sushi but my table polished off a huge tray of it, and could only rave. I split the Asian Pot Roast with someone else with a side of Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. I wasn't even that excited to try it, but after I did, I couldn't stop myself. This was the BEST MEAT I may have ever tasted in my life.

Transportation: Super close to Blue Line, easy to get a cab, and tons of street parking right outside. Like you can literally park right in front. Wonderful.  Atmosphere: I like that it was dimly lit, a little eclectic, a little rustic. Hard to pigeonhole the decor, because it seemed like art was misplaced but somehow worked.

A little too much dressing for my taste, but overall good! Godzilla: really good. I liked that this roll had cream cheese in it, and didn't take up half the roll. Majority of sushi rolls with cream cheese have way too much and mask the taste of every other ingredient.This, did not. It was great. And it was huge.  Five-0: I will start by saying I am in love with bacon, and just the other day i was telling my boyfriend that they should put it in sushi. Fast forward two weeks later and BAM.. we find a roll here at Sushi X with bacon in it. The bacon is not overpowering and is such a great addition to a sushi roll. WELL DONE! One of my favorites. And again, big roll.  Dragonfly: This roll tasted really fresh, which the mango had a lot to do with. It came with a side of this sweet/spicy sauce. You could compare it to some sauces you receive with spring rolls. Very good. One of my favorites. This one was big too!  Megatron: This had a nice kick to it! Nice balance of everything but a little creamy. Good size roll!  Honey roll: This one I was not such a fan of. It had a lot of cucumber and not much taste, which i was not expecting since the name ""honey roll"" made me expect a very sweet flavor. It was half off. Just not for me. One of the smaller rolls.

For takeout (which I think is where they get the majority of their business), Sushi X rocks!  Inventive, delicious rolls and good hot dishes.  I'm a fan. Sushi in general is expensive, but for the price, Sushi X's rolls are larger and more delicious than any other sushi place I have tried. I know that some people won't consider their Godzilla roll a ""real"" sushi roll because it's got cream cheese and tempura shrimp, but it is so amazingly delicious! Also try their honey roll, hibachi scallop and R.O.K. bowl. Yum.",0.9597,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.6328431372549019

We look on the net for something close and see a few reviews for this place called Sushi X which we thought looked intresting. After grabbing a bottle of vino we pull up to the front. (Great parking which is a plus.) We walk thru the doors and instantly we are warmly greeted by Steven. We are seated at our table and he goes over the menu and the specials with us and we end up getting into a conversation about ""Jiro,Dreams of Sushi."" He tells me after seeing that he couldn't wait to get to work. I felt the same way after I saw that too. So we order are stuff from our server Rachel who also was ultra friendly and attentive. I ordered a few pieces of tuna nigiri with ebi and tako. The fish was good. The Ebi marinated very well. My girl ordered a veggie Buddah roll which I tried and thought was out of this world. I also got the Black Widow which satisfied my every expectation.(By the way..Some of the names of the rolls are funny..like the Thai stick and the buddah kush..Someone is a stoner eh??lol).It came with a chili/ponzu sauce which was the perfect fit for this roll. The flavors were above average. To get straight to the point with this place. The Sushi was very good. The service was exceptionally awesome.They made you feel like a long lost friend of theirs.Great service is a big important part of the dining experience in my book and for that they get 5 stars.

I had pre-ordered for 16 people, and we tried a bit over everything! The roll with bacon is my favorite! Although the spring-roll type rollups were delightful. Love the gyoza, and the tempura mushroom and green beans. So good!  With it being BYOB, we had such a bang for our buck, and all of the people in my party were mucho impressed!

On to the important stuff.  Their rolls are huge.  Got that?  Huge.  If you're a size queen, then this is your place.  We went with the crab rangoon, honey, and sushifruit rolls.  Damn good.  The crab rangoon roll was heaven, the honey was tasty (we switched out the tuna w/ salmon - with no problem, I might add), and the sushifruit was simply amazing, with the fruit accenting and giving a unique kick to the sushi, instead of becoming a full on fruity dessert roll.  They also offer various dipping sauces...um, honey sesame mayo anyone?  Yum.  The service was quick and friendly, and they always have rotating artwork on the walls to enjoy/purchase. We returned a couple weeks later for some takeout, and surprise!  You can grab the lunch special to go.  Score.  My stuffed takeout  bag came with miso soup, a roll, salad, and a pop.  All for $10.  And when it comes to the rolls, they don't crap out on the selection - they give you an amazing choice of 12 rolls, including their delish honey roll.  Oh, and from placing our order to getting our stuff we made it out in less than ten minutes.  Yes, I think I'm obsessed.",0.9853,0.764,0.167,0.069,0.6253663003663005

The music gives you more of a lounge feel, but that doesn't take away from the food. They don't have a bar, but it is BYOB and there is no cork fee. Definitely a plus. As far as the food, the sushi is fresh and it's prepared rather quick. The prices are not bad and about the only concern that I would have is that you can't watch the sushi chef make the food.

2011-08-09,4.0,"I've ordered delivery from Sushi X a few times recently, and have been very pleased. Delivery has been on time or early. I have never dined in, but have driven past there countless times, and it sure is a bit dubious looking from the outside. Might be the black exterior, lack of windows, and understated signage, perhaps. I'm sure the interior is lovely.  Based on rave Yelp reviews, I most recently tried the Crab Rangoon Roll. Delicious! There was barely any tempura batter on the outside, but it didn't matter. It was stuffed full of REAL crabmeat. No crappy fake crabstick. Only small complaint from me would be the choice of the Chili Sauce on the side. I don't like that kind of sauce, and don't think it's a good choice for that roll. Soy sauce sufficed. It most certainly is a Mega Roll as they call it. That roll with a Miso Soup would have been an adequate meal. But not knowing that, I also ordered a Sweet Potato Tempura roll, which might be my favorite. Oh, and I ordered the Wasabi Garlic Mashed Potatoes too, which had to wait for lunch the next day thanks to the Mega Roll! Very tasty potatoes. Great flavor and texture  The Philly and California are above average as well. I didn't enjoy the Vegetable Tempura. A bit undercooked and too firm for my liking. Winter squash and sweet potato aren't at their best virtually raw.  They offer sides of what must be all of their sauces, which is a great idea. 18 of them at last count. The Mango Sauce is wonderful. On a related mango note, the Mango Mousse Cake is awesome, too.  Highly recommend Sushi X.",0.9918,0.689,0.208,0.102,0.5029147422625683

The sushi was so good and they had some different types of rolls. When the food came out, they forgot about two rolls, but brought them out quickly and didn't charge us for them. The only problem was when the bill came, they charged us for some that we didn't order, but they took it off right away. I will definitely be back!",0.9695,0.799,0.157,0.044,0.5631578947368422

We didn't know if happy hour still existed on Tuesdays because we couldn't find it anywhere and they were still not answering their phones at 5pm, so we just risked it and went. Lucky for us, as of December 1, they stopped doing happy hour on Sunday and just do it on Monday on Tuesday. Went in at 6pm and got seated right away (2 people) but there was definitely open seating all around. We brought our own bottle (this is BYOB) and they gave us the glasses and opener and we self-served. When we got the menu we ordered Miso soup and it came right away. When she brought it we order our rolls and an order of edemame. I got the chicken and the buddah rolls (both absolutely delicious) and she had the omega, spicy tuna and Alaska rolls (she loved them and brought a bunch home), but the edemame never came. Everything tasted amazing and I cannot wait to go back, but again the service was terrible for no reason because it was not even busy. All of this was $35, by the way. As a side note, the feel of the room was really weird.

It's still one of my favorite sushi places even if just for their Double Stack roll (three types of fish, chili oil, cilantro, pepper, avocado and spicy mayo)  and the hearty vegetarian Buddha roll (you won't miss the fish) served with their house made ginger dressing.  I'd also recommend the Thai Stick roll and the Pollo Loco as well as the wasabi garlic mashed potatoes.    Also, this place is BYOB - even better!

Boasting hands down the most immaculate to-go packaging, Sushi X rocked my sushi delivery world last night.  I mean, these guys are bringing it with beautiful packaging, leak-proof bags for the soup and the perfect amount of utensils. My first impression was slight annoyance.  I was put on hold for about 5 minutes, but I held strong.  Once I was finally taken off the Muzak hold music, a perfectly nice gal took my order for California, beef asparagus, spicy crunchy tuna and spicy shrimp rolls, a miso soup and extra sides of raw ginger and spicy red chili paste.  I was a bit put off that they don't have sashimi on the delivery menu.  Really?  Bogus.   Delivery estimate: 45 minutes.  Actual delivery time:  About 30 minutes.  And the most shocking part was the (very hot) delivery guy was able to find his way to my bat cave of an apartment without calling me for instructions.  Whoot whoot! The food?  Yummers.  I only partook in a California roll and miso soup (damn diet), but they were very well done and pretty darn tasty.  The roll was actually a bit on the larger side and didn't skimp on the crab meat, which I love.  My miso soup had great flavor, although if I had one teensy complaint it would be my soup wasn't quite hot enough for my liking, but when you get soup delivered, the temperature can be hit or miss.  I'm told the sauce, tempura and mayo-laden beef, tuna and shrimp rolls were delicious.  I bet they were.  I hate people who can eat fried food and mayo right now. Again, I can't say enough about the presentation.  I was asked how many people would be dining, so I received the perfect amount of chop sticks, soy sauce (yes, I'm a bit persnickety and don't like sharing my soy sauce) and mounds of lovely, delicious raw ginger.  The rolls were all served in their own foil blanket so the flavors wouldn't merge and everything was non-smooshed and fairly temperature appropriate.

2009-08-24,3.0,"The only reason why I gave this a 3 star rating was because of the overall experience. First off - The sushi itself is very good. I would probably order takeout to save the money (drinks, tip, time) rather than dine in. The dining experience is what prevented the 5 star rating in my book. Atmosphere - I felt like a DJ was going to pop out of a corner and start spinning house music. This place seemed to be more of a place to be spotted, rather than a place to eat.  There was a wall in the back corner with the DVD emblem bouncing around the wall because in the 2 hours I was there, no one could either restart the DVD player or press play on the player. I don't know why anyone needs to be watching a movie in a sushi restaurant.  Service - We sat down around 8:30 at night on a Monday night (not typically a night for slow service) and didn't get our food until about 9:30. There were 3 of us there, and we decided to split a bottle of wine. The waitress brought out the bottle and 2 glasses. She ran off to get the third glass and we ended up pouring our own wine. We ordered Soup and Edamame as an appetizer (I the edamame, my friend the soup) and she got the soup while I waited on the edamame for another 10 minutes! A group sat after us, and the waitress took their order first, than finally took our order. Once the order was taken, we still waited about 45 minutes to receive our food. Please let me remind everyone that this was on a Monday and I think there was only about 3 tables.  If we are going on food along, this place deserves 5 stars. The price is pretty standard, (about $10-$16 per roll) and the quality is very good.  I was not a fan of the atmosphere and the service, which is why it received the 3 star rating in my book.

2009-07-21,3.0,"It's hard to know how to rate Sushi X.  The food:  Having never been to Sushi X, we ordered one hot item and 8 rolls between us. We had the wasabi garlic mashed potatoes, a buddha roll, a veggie tempura roll (no roe please!), a shitake roll, an avocado roll, a crab rangoon roll, a salmon skin roll, a sake roll, and a kappa roll. The first four were mine (vegetarians who still love sushi, unite!) and the latter four my girlfriend's. We also ordered the ""Japanese Iced Green Tea"". Oh my God. I had no idea how huge the buddha and crab rangoon rolls would be. Is this normal in Chicago? I've never had such a wide maki before. And there were 10 pieces! In the other parts of the country I've had sushi my rolls have generally ranged 6-8 pieces, but not 10. If we had know, I think we'd have cut our order in half.  That said, almost everything we had was fantastic. I agree that Sushi X is a little heavy handed with the mayo. I get why they have it in some rolls, but it's in most of their rolls on the right side of the menu, so they could really hold back a little more. Even so, the buddha was pretty fabulous with lettuce, avocado, daikon, tempura asparagus, cucumber, shitake, and green onions. Better than your usual veggie roll with just avocado, carrots, and cucumber. My girlfriend said the crab rangoon tasted almost creepily like the real thing, in a good way. The wasabi garlic mashed potatoes were unusual in a sushi place, but incredibly good. I mean, I'm an Irish girl. There were potatoes. With WASABI. I'm sold. I didn't really dig my shitake roll because it was drowned in sesame seeds. I love me some sesame but I mean they were literally like 30% of the roll and I think anyone who has have had sesame knows they that's enough to overpower everything else in the roll. Sad. Also, that Japanese iced green tea? Was a bottle of Fuze. Which is made in the U.S. ... yeah. I mean, there might be a slight chance that Fuze uses Japanese tea leaves instead of Chinese or Indian, but I doubt it. I felt more than a little cheated paying $3 for a Fuze flavor I don't even like. The Service: Weird. Sometimes really awesome, sometimes non-existent. It wasn't horrible by any means. Just that our server semi-disappeared after bringing our last dish and only filled our water glass once during the meal. Still, they're a small place with only two servers, so I can see how during a busy time they might flake a little. The Atmosphere: Awesome and headache inducing at the same time. Some might think of it as goth. I don't, largely because in Japan, many restaurants are themed. This one happens to be a restaurant in the US themed to be kind of Japanese. It's dark, with anime playing on one wall. Unlike most places in town, the servers aren't 20-something white kids. Techno is played at a level that's loud but not totally impossible to converse over (though you might have to speak up). I liked it, but I'm a little weird, so I get why some don't.  So that's that. Sushi X is on par with other overpriced sushi places in the area, but Sunday and Monday you can take advantage of the 5-7 happy hour. The price is good for two rolls per person per order but you can put in more orders until 7, so you can technically work it for as long as you want. That said, if you're ordering Mega or Neo rolls, I can't imagine ordering more than two. Really, they're huge.  I will note, I felt a little sick after my meal, but I'm pretty sure that's because of the giant portions, not the quality of the food.",0.9972,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.5364691662105454

The soup was decent, the edamame was a heaping portion.  It would have been nice to have options other than rolls on the menu. There are only rolls. But it seems they are taking the approach of doing one thing, and doing it well.  There were 4 of us and we ordered 2 rolls each thinking that we'd order more after the first round. HOLY CRAP THESE ROLLS ARE HUGE! We had a hard time finishing them.  The happy hour specials are amazing. You get half off most rolls as long as you are seated by 7pm.

Two friends and I end up their last night around 6:30. The place is fairly small, maybe about 10 tables. It also features Japanese anime projected on to a wall. It is a pretty dark place. When we arrive, there are two two-tops in front of us. In about 5 minutes, those two tables are sat so we should be next. Well because of the configuration of Sushi-X two tables got up and they sat another two two-tops after us.  So we finally get seated around 7:05 after the 7 pm happy hour time and I must admit I had a little chip on my shoulder. The table we were seated at had cleared out about 10 minutes prior and the servers made no attempt to clean the table so we could sit down. They really could use a bus boy at Sushi X. From a business perespective I understand it but as a customer I was a little annoyed.  Once I got over it, I ordered a philly roll and a Five-O roll. The Philly was pretty standard, cream cheese, salmon and avocado. The Five- O features bacon, hamachi, avocado, cilantro, scallions, pineapple mustard mayo, rolled in bacon bits, wrapped with proscuitto. All it was missing was a little spam and it would have reminded me of Hawaii! The roll was huge and filling; there must have been about 8 pieces. In hindsight, I didn't really need the Philly roll. I also had the miso soup which was served in a big coffee cup. Very tasty. The bill comes and the staff at Sushi-X was kind enough to give us the happy hour prices....which made me very happy. Sushi-X is a good BYOB place with a great happy hour deal. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here but the food is pretty good. If you are going to go for happy hour be sure to get there early.

On the plus side, it is a BYOB establishment, the food arrived in a timely manner and wasn't half-bad.  Although, if you normally order spicy-tuna, I say refrain from theirs, it was over-the-top spicy, even for me, the spice lover!

Yes, this is very clever, I hear you say, but as a customer, it gives me great satisfaction when I take away food and the restaurant asks me how many people will be partaking in the meal and then making sure the same amount of utensils are not only included but carefully packaged away for me to enjoy and use.  Call me a sucker but small things like that carry a lot of weight for me.

Overall, Sushi X is a small, intimate restaurant that maybe seats 40.  For the price, it seems a little pricey (avg $15 for large rolls and avg $9 for appetizers), but it truly is a lot of food and a lot of rice.  If you're not adventurous, this may be the spot for you, especially if you have a hearty appetite for rice with everything.  However, I like my sushi restaurants without the frills and elaborate ingredients.  Not sure if I'll be coming back again, but it was a good dining experience.  And BYOB!",0.9696,0.839,0.114,0.047,0.4698315278102513

2007-05-14,4.0,"I adore Sushi-X for so many reasons. I've never experienced the negativities that people are mentioning.  They're a neo-sushi place rather than traditional so there is stuff they serve that you definitely won't find elsewhere in addition to staples like dragon or rainbow rolls. Evidence of their neo-philosophy towards mayo: there's a lot of different kinds they offer up. What's really great is customizing your roll here since they offer so many different ingredients. My favorite is the mango. Mango is an awesome sushi ingredient and I'm often surprised it hasn't caught on in Chicago like it has elsewhere.  What's also amazing about this place is that it's good for vegetarians. I know it sounds contradictory, but they offer that many vegetable options for their rolls. The Buddha roll, one of their specialties you'll never find elsewhere, is 7different vegetables. Their specialty rolls are truly special. I can't stand places where their house ""specialty"" selection reads like a catering menu from Jewel (dragon, rainbow, california, caterpillar, godzilla, spider, etcetera).  Here's a short list of specialty rolls: Thai Stick - green curry, shrimp, bamboo shoots, basil Red Dragon - siracha, shrimp, tuna, jalepeno, green onion Honey - albacore, cucumber, honey sesame, tempura crunch Yellow Jacket - yellowtail, mango, shitake, avocado Buddha - lettuce, avocado, daikon, asparagus, cucumber, shitake, green onion, ginger sauce This place is more than affordable for the quality they provide. I think this place is 10x better than Sushi Wabi because of craftsmenship and presentation. I can't think of another restaurant that delivers sushi with such class and design. I'm usually turned off by LA style restaurants, and if you are too, go with an open mind. This place is 100% black with anime projected on a wall with some type of electronica (drum/bass, house, trance, etcetera) playing in the background. It's also not listed on the menu since they've revamped it for the 5th time since they've opened, but this place will customize rolls for you. My favorite has always been the mango, shitake, and yellowtail combination. This is something that'll be new to most people no matter how much sushi they've eaten if don't travel much. And like I've said, this is a neo place so a lot of the traditional stuff is lacking. As much as I love miso, I'd much rather have their butternut squash soup or their wasabi garlic yukon mashed potatoes. To further enforce the idea that this place is really nouveau and far from traditional sushi places: they don't offer any nigiri.  What most people understand to be sushi is raw fish pieced in a roll (which is technically maki) or ala carte by piece (which is technically nigiri), but traditionally sushi is all encompassing and means basically snackable hand items of rice with stuff attached and they just love pushing that definition. Thank g-d someone is willing to do it. Here's something I'm absolutely fanatic about: their rice is top-notch. I've had better, but this is definitely close to the top. I'm seemingly obsessed with rice quality in my sushi, but really, rice the common denominator between all sushi and it usually composes about 50% of the content: the rice NEEDS to be good. AND for the reviewer who said: "" Upon further consideration, we theorize that the sushi isn't even produced onsite. Evidence?  There are no sushi chefs visible as the food mysteriously appears from behind a curtain."" I have ONE word for you: KITCHEN. I know in most circles, it's a well-guarded secret but I thought should let you in on it. High-end sushi places (like most high-end restaurants) use a kitchen and not a barista-style bar. That was a habit produced by fast-food sushi in places like Tokyo or NYC, but a good restaurant uses a good fully stocked kitchen. This ain't Benihana's. I don't mean to curt and insulting, but if you're going to attempt to make a clever slam, at least be clever about it.",0.9977,0.827,0.142,0.03,0.5619567027175726
2007-05-11,4.0,I haven't found better sushi for the price in Chicago.  The experience is sometimes hit-or-miss I think it depends on who is preparing the sushi that night and how busy they are.  This place gets alot of delivery and carryout so sometimes it's deceiving as to how busy they really are.  Sometimes a bit heavy on cream cheese but if that's your thing then it's great.  I usually stick away from anything with flavored mayo because that always seems to be a little much for my tastes.  They also have an excellent spicy tuna roll which also seems to vary from night to night but is usually outstanding.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I keep holding out for sushi as good as I had in California... probably wishful thinking while dead center between both coasts.,0.9269,0.806,0.131,0.062,0.46249999999999997

The atmosphere was nice, it struck me as a very New York vibe: nondescript entryway, dark blue walls, warehouse space, screen playing video clips.  I like this neighborhood for this very reason: it's very urban but not ultra-trendy (yet at least).  But I digress. First, the Miso Soup is delicious and cheap ($2 - but they ended up not us at all for them!).  For the main course, We ordered the Spicy Tuna, the Unagi, and the Godzilla rolls.  They were all good, but the Godzilla was simply incredible.  The presentation (for what its worth) was excellent, on par with Indie Cafe.  The spicy mayo/soy-type sauce that was poured artfully over the whole tray was so good!  For dessert, we had the mochi ice cream.  They were all decent and the waiter gave us extra free of charge. I must comment on the service: outstanding.  We were well attended to in every way and even though we were first-timers, they made us feel like regulars.  Plus not charging for the soup was, to me, a great way to get repeat customers - by making us feel like the waiter was taking care of us. There was this ridiculous drunk rich lady and her husband next to us who kept pointing at our food and loudly saying she wanted it.  She also dropped her menu near us and kept saying really odd things about the restaurant.   In conclusion, if you like sushi, especially if you're a rich drunk bottle-blonde, you'll love Sushi X.",0.9973,0.7,0.241,0.059,0.6057449494949495
