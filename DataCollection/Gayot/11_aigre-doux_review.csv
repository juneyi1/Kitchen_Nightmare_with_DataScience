2010-03-30,1.0,"This restaurant was terrible and the worst dining experience I have had in Chicago. I am glad that it is closed and think it is a result of poor service and food quality. We went there for a special occassion dinner and they were out of the first 5 bottles of wine that we ordered (3 of which were recommended by the sommelier) and the appetizers were cold when served and then when our food came out there was a film on it (like it had been sitting under a light). The waiter apologized but didn't comp anything from our bill. Later they issued a gift certificate when we complained, but it was for 25% of the total bill we spent on that horrific dinner. We never went back and it looks like no one else did either.",-0.7964,0.781,0.093,0.126,0.5569841269841269

2009-07-01,3.0,"Framing: 4 of us in total, no special occasion on a Saturday night. All of us had appetizers and entrees, plus two bottles of nice wine ($60 each). Total bill was $350 before tip. Server was Sophie. REVIEW Going down... So I have been here three times, the first time I loved it. It was new, the chef was passionate and the staff excited. The second time, more recently, I noticed some of the ""pop"" had gone away. I tried again last week and am now ready to confirm this restaurant is on its way to closure. FOOD The food is still good but not great. The menu says lunch but i don't think they still serve lunch. The prices are still the same or higher but the servings are smaller. And $20 for a beet salad is super ridiculous!  Shrimp fritters were good, as was the Halibut entree. Ice cream was equivalent to one scoop but costs $11. Both wine selections were great ( made the first selection - Truchard Pinot Noir) while a waiter picked the Ermitage Pomeral. SERVICE Service is adequate but not exciting or passionate. The chef walked past us and spent most of the night at the bar drinking with friends. Despite being a Saturday night, the place was pretty quiet and I was able to get a reservation with no problem within 15 minutes of calling (meaning walkins were possible). DECOR The bakery area next to the dining room still looks abandoned. The overall decor has gotten dated and lackluster. This is simply a boring, blah restaurant with a few good wins for food but nothing that will excite foodies to go to this somewhat out of the way location. Nor does it seem to have a large crowd of local supporters. I don't think it will be around for much longer.",0.9436,0.749,0.15,0.101,0.5002295684113865
2009-06-24,3.0,"I went there yesterday myself, during ""Gourmet Kid's Week"". The waitress would not let me order the regular prix fixe, or the ""parents' version of the kid's special prix fixe"". Considering they're making it for parents already... I found that disappointing. On to the food. I ordered the onion soup and, on recommendation of the waitress, the duck. Onion soup: [EDIT: I was just informed that it's actually a Spring Garlic Soup. Sorry about that! Totally misremembered.] Light and thin. An interesting mix of herbs and buttered croutons in the dish, over which the broth is poured at the moment of serving. The soup ends up odd, because it isn't clear, like a french onion, nor is it thick and creamy like a five onion. Instead, it's halfway in the middle. Neither rich nor clarifying, it's, well, thin. The onion does come through, I just wish there was more of it. Duck:  With tagliatelle and asparagus.  The asparagus was nothing special. The duck was really quite nice -- I asked for it to be done medium, and it was extremely tender, almost meltingly so. Absolutely no gaminess at all, rich, satisfying on the palate. There was a small layer of fat under the skin, treated so well such that I couldn't feel it being ""fatty"". This is how duck fat should be made -- salty, rich, smooth. Almost like bacon. Tagliatelle was a huge disappointment. First, mushy. There's al dente, there's soft and melty like a nice dumpling skin, and then, there's overcooked. This is beyond overcooked to the point of falling apart into starchy chunks. Also, what's with the overwhelming citrus rind flavor? I couldn't get much, if any, pasta flavor, or mushrooms, or anything else except... citrus rind. The problem with this is that it doesn't balance with the heavy meatiness of the duck. Mint, yes. Orange, yes. Hell, even a little raspberry would complement it . Citrus -rind-, no. I would probably have been more ok with it if the citrus was toned down to about 10% of what it was. [EDIT: Was just informed it's a kaffir lime tagliatelle. Interesting. I tend to like it in Thai curry, where its astringency cuts through the coconut milk. Where I like it is that it gives it an aroma, not so much a flavor, because the lemongrass, or coconut milk is already pretty solid. Here, a little heavy-handed because, well, tagliatelle usually is a fairly delicate and subtle flavor to begin with.] Also, about two hours from seating to exiting, for a single person. Given that there were, at most, four other parties, and I'm not there for the ambiance or the ""dining experience"" (what dining experience?), a little slow. I'd say, comparable to Tru, and Tru was also a disappointment to me. Verdict: I would pay about 1/2 of what I did.",0.8451,0.788,0.111,0.101,0.5452658452658451
2009-06-21,2.0,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to give Aigre Doux a chance because a lot of the issues seemed to relate to restaurant week.  Well, normal dinners are not much better.  As someone else mentioned, the decor has a young vibe that you would assume would attract the same clientele. This is not the case.  The music was a little upbeat but the atmosphere was stuffy.  Most of the patrons were a little older and most wore suits.  Another thing we didn't like about the place was the tiled floor in the main dining space which at some points, in the right light, looked more like a diner than a respectable restaurant.   Now on to the food.  We were not that hungry so we just each ordered and entree and the waitress seemed a little upset that we didn't order any appetizers.  I guess it would increase the amount of the bill and her tip.  The service was ok, attentive, but not really inviting or comforting.  I had the steak, medium, and my girlfriend had the lobster pasta.  The steak came out way over cooked.  It was more like medium well or well done.  It was also overly salty maybe it's the way they seasoned it.  The lobster pasta was good but not exceptional.  The lobster was a little rubbery and the vegetables were not fully cooked.   The positive, the champagne and bread were good.",0.9772,0.786,0.154,0.059,0.5069134199134198

I figure when a restaurant is raking in money, can't they call a service? There are HVAC guys (that means heating and air conditioning) that work on call 24/7.  Good thing the tables are spaced wide and there is a good draft, otherwise it'd be too humid to eat.  Later, as the evening was cooling, it was sweaty for a bit.  I won't mock them too much since this is something that does happen eventually, which is why places like these should have their systems checked seasonally. Maybe they do?  Still, a Friday night and you've cut the menu in half, what does that say to any new potential customers.  I think they were experiencing two problems, cooling the place and refrigeration of their meats.   When it comes to food service, I feel that anyone that handles contact with my food must be ""maintained"".  It was surprising that our waitress had jagged and ragged looking nails, but the valet had an expensive looking manicure (w/polish!).  Food was good but not fantastic. I may feel this way because 3 of the 4 unavailable dishes, I wanted and it sucks to pay a lot of money for a meal you wouldn't normally pick.  Since it was a special occasion in a group setting, you just deal.   Thinking back to that day trying to recall any memorable moments, I think my lamb entree was pretty good and expensive.  Also every dessert we ordered was marvelous, so also, the martinis were all the same strength.  Strong. I would say if you do plan to splurge, try Aigre with a group.  Sharing is caring, so share and try it all.  I wouldn't take a date, even if I had the cash to drop.  I wouldn't even come here to celebrate say... some chick's 22nd birthday, only 22, not 30, okay!    Off the bat I knew I was not going to like our waitress.  Her facial and body expressions were open, but she never addressed the table.  She seemed nice enough, but, she never made eye contact with anyone at the table except the only White person.  It's good to have a White dude in the family. =) If I was White, I think this review would be so much better. I would tell you about how much attention our server paid me, such detail with explanations of the meals.  Even the ones served to my party, she was open enough to only tell me about them.  Whenever she approached the table she would always come to my side to see if I needed anything or if she could answer any questions.

It's strange to me, the cooks are Arabs I believe.  Husband and wife duo that make phenomenal food.  There's an article framed in the basement talking about the wondrous cookies the wife makes; so awesome in fact that while she was pregnant and not working, the lead singer of U2 calls her way too late in night and serenades her unborn baby.  A few hours later, fresh cookies are made and sent over.   See my thinking is, Indian / Arab, close in color, maybe the waitress would get a clue and just treat everyone the same?   Would I come back? Hell f*$king no.  I know it was only one visit and maybe I should give them another chance, but that day we dropped a couple bills, it was for a happy occasion.  $400+ probably.  Good estimate is to assume to spend about $75-100 per person.  You could do it cheaper, I think they offer a seasonal Prix Fix.",0.9975,0.773,0.16,0.067,0.5387040043290044

Audrey went with the Lavender Roasted Chicken served with a potato puree.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were a hit.  I was looking at their Kobe Burger, but the Kuma's curse kicked in and I decided to go with the Veal Duo.  The duo consisted of a two veal preparations one a seared tenderloin and the other a braised cheek.  The tenderloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The cheeks were rich and fell apart in your mouth.  It was also served with some Israel Couscous and a Cucumber Raita.  Finally we ended the evening with the Peach Galette and the Chocolate Cake.  The chocolate cake was served with a toasted marshmallow topping and was just straight up amazing! They even delivered our cake with a candle to help us celebrate the occasion.  We washed down our meal with the Viognier that we brought.  My really only knock on the entire experience was that the corkage was $35.  I feel that $25 is as much as I want to pay, $35 is a bit over the top.  I guess that's what I get for wanting to bring my own.

Then, we waited well over an hour for our entrees to arrive!  We were beginning to think something horrible happened in the kitchen: A fire? Kitchen strike?

Something to improve:  noise level - it's super high - no small conversation possible  the basics: cleanliness = excellent air = well vented service = excellent and no attitude noise level = bad - very noisy scene = hip/classy/established people - all ages - no bling bling - no showing off,0.9656,0.537,0.312,0.151,0.7037777777777777
2008-06-23,4.0,"Sunday night after a stroll down Wacker, my two friends and I entered a strangely deserted Aigre Doux. We were greeted by the host and I presume manager, as well as the slight smell of basement. Hmm. I put that out of my head as we were shown a cozy three-sided booth.  The service was excellent, our server was particularly professional and sweet (and with all three of us in the industry ourselves, were perhaps going over everything fine-toothed).  Starter of champagne, heirloom tomatoes, peekytoe crab & avocado salad, and a delicious lobster ravioli plus some of the best bread. Though not warm, and that would have made it the best bread EVER. The salt sprinkled over the butter was particularly nice. Our starters were all executed brilliantly and were very tastily.  Our mains were a lobster linguine, another pasta dish I am now forgetting and while I vacillated between the veal cheeks, lamb flight and fish, I ultimately opted for the baked salmon. The salmon was presented in a roulade which unfortunately made it a bit overcooked, and was topped with a highly unnecessary fruit compote. I requested that the chef give something other than cooked carrots (I can't stand them. Can't. Stand.) which he did in the form of broccolini while also including the carrots. It was slightly undercooked, but I prefer my veggies a bit on the raw side - hence the anti-carrot. Given a return visit, I would not again order the salmon. I feel like I missed out. One shouldn't pass up veal cheeks on a menu, I now realize. I had perhaps the best Viognier I've ever had, something from a winery called Miner (Napa). It was creme brulee in a glass, I kid you not.  We opted for no dessert but chatted up our server over cappucinos instead, a delightful young lady whose name unfortunately I don't think I ever caught. She made mention of my friends' visit from out of town and one of their birthdays, thanks to Open Table's reservation system's notes. Nice touch.  I enjoyed Aigre Doux and I would return. It's a lovely little date place, dimly lit and nicely tuned.",0.9936,0.801,0.163,0.035,0.6049612713675213

The dcor was simple and elegant.  I'm a firm believer in less is more.  The track lighting of the exposed bulbs was really nice and the wood paneling just gave it a homey feel.  We had a booth and it was quite comfortable.  The chairs at the tables reminded me of bistro chairs that you would find in a caf in Paris.  They must have been comfortable because people seemed to linger after their meals were finished. Speaking of the meals, wow was it good.  I was nervous because I'm not typically a fancy food eater, but I wanted to branch out.  We started off with the sweet pea ravioli.  Wow it was fantastic.  The sauce it was in was delicious and my boyfriend who is not a fan of pureed pees really enjoyed the dish as well.  I asked our waitress for a recommendation for dinner between the lamb, the salmon and their pork chop special, she recommended the salmon.  It was oh so delicious.  The salmon was rolled up in a spiral, but it totally messed with my mind, how did they roll this up?  Regardless of how it's done, it was delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the veal duo and holy moly that was delicious.  I'm not a fan of veal but wow was it good.  When we go back I'll definitely be getting that.  He also said it was the best veal he's ever had.  For dessert we got this chocolate custard thing with a hazelnut ""kit kat"" thing.  It too was scrumptious.   The service was amazing.  I waited tables for 5 years so I'm pretty critical and I notice everything.  First off the waiters wouldn't have been half as good if it wasn't for their busboys.  Wow, those guys seemed as if they had their whole evening choreographed.  I heard a knife drop and the busboy saw it and was over with a new knife to the lady before she could even realize it was her knife that had fallen.  The other waiters were walking around and removing dishes off tables other then theirs if they saw someone was done.  It was great.   Everything about this place is fantastic.  I can't wait to go back.",0.9991,0.704,0.25,0.046,0.6521938573409161

Well, from the beginning, everything was wonderful.  We started with a couple bottles of wine, several appetizers consisting of the truffle pizza, short rib ravioli, some type of hamachi tartare and one other item that escapes my memory at the moment.  From there we went on to entrees.  I had the lobster bucatini which was absolutely filled with lobster meat (at approx. $30 a serving, it should be).  I loved it.  My companions had the black cod in a miso sauce, lamb chops and duck.  Everyone thought their meal was better than all the others - that's how enjoyable it was.  Dessert was interesting, albeit not the most memorable.  We had a cookie platter, a parfait, a chocolate molten cake and a trio of gelatos (which was my favorite).   Aside from the expense of the meal (about $750.00 for 6 persons without grautity), there was nothing to complain about.  I really can't wait to come again.",0.9679,0.826,0.147,0.027,0.563407029478458

Dessert  - the ""sticky toffee pudding"" was basically HEAVEN.  warm cake-like date pudding - the kind you eat w/ a fork - was yum yum yum.  The key lime parfait was refreshing and very very sweet.

We arrived 15 minutes early and found the place swarming with people so we were a bit nervous about making the concert on time (but it didn't matter anyway as Snoop made us wait til 1130!) so we informed the hostesses that we had a show at 9.

He waited on us and set up the bar perfectly for our alternate dining experience.  For appetizers, I went with the pumpkin ravioli and my bf went with the curried peekytoe crab. Both were delish. I read reviews on yelp before going to AD so I went with the short ribs and advised my bf to get the same. The beef was very tender and yummy! The spinach side was extra buttery and tasty.

I received a huge chunk of meat, which was way over my capabilities. it was braised enough to become tender, but not braised enough so you could peel the meat with your fork alone. while I could appreciate the shorter period of time, providing me with more meaty piece, i was a little disappointed as i was expecting something else. the sweat potato garten than accompanied this dish was good. over all, i think i should have chosen a different main course, their daily special - the scallops sounds super-good, and i would definitely try that in my next visit. add a superb service to this beautiful place, and you've just found out another favorite joint in the city.

So, Friday night at Aigre Doux.  The restaurant is full, but not packed.  The bar is empty.  We're about 20 minutes early for our reservation because we're just so damn eager to eat and because we found a parking fairly easily (January!  I tell you!) so we enjoy a round at the bar.  Aigre Doux has a nice little by-the-glass wine list.  I had a glass of Avinyo Cava and Josh has a Delirium Tremens (bottle).   I forgot to mention that everyone at the door was so very nice-- multiple hosts/managers/coat check girls/etc.  A host came around, asked us how we were-- almost conversationally, really-- and let us know that our table was ready when we were. The space is nice-- intimate and spare.  I've heard comparisons to Blackbird, but it's much warmer than the rather cool Scandinavian tones at Blackbird.  Here, the warm wood, small round tiles, amber water glasses, heavy curtains in entry work to soften the white walls and sharp angles.  The appearance may be much different in the day or in the summer, but on a cold winter night, it was plenty cozy.  The tables along the banquette are close together, but are wide enough to keep you from feeling like you need to make friends with your neighbors.   To the food, before I run out of room here... Me: A market apple salad with serrano ham, manchego cheese, matchstick apples and the tiniest arugula leaves you imagine.  This with a glass of Bodegas Nekeas Rose.  Then, Glazed duck with huckleberries, quinoa with almonds and tiny tiny bok choys.  Josh:  Sunchoke soup with a disc of goat cheese; then, rack of lamb with grits and fava beans.  Entrees with a bottle of Mas de l'Abundancia Monsant. Everything was spectacular.  I had been grousing about the supremacy of flavor over texture, but Josh told me stop being a whiner, so I'll just leave it alone.  It's a silly thing anyway. I would go back in an instant.  The service was attentive and pleasant, the food was fun and flavorful (the lamb was *so* tender and I could have continued to eat that duck endlessly) and the seasonal menu well-varied-- just enough choices and all of them appealing and tempting.

My dining partner fared better with the ""loupe de mer"" fish, which was tender yet crispy and sweet, but the sides--lettuce and a puny persimmon--undermined the fish.

In addition, it's unusual to encounter service as bad as we experienced at Aigre Doux.  Bread was not brought, we had to ask to place the wine order, needed to ask to place our dinner order, silverware was never replaced after each course, water was never refilled, we needed to request that the plates be removed, needed to request the dessert menu--and on and on.  For each of the courses: appetizer, entree, and dessert--the servers (not the regular server, but kitchen staff) mixed up the plates.  Not once, but each time.  After each course was served, no one ever checked in with our party.  So when my duck arrived utterly and completed raw, I of course needed to send it back.  But it took nearly 10 minutes just to get the attention of the server, by finally yelling, ""excuse me.""  No apology was given when I showed him the raw meat; rather, our server seemed annoyed.  And when it was returned to me, it was fatty, tough, difficult to chew.  The overly sweet sauce was cloying and overpowering; it was inedible.  Again, no one noticed, and by then I was too exhausted from the entire experience and say anything. While several other menu choices fared better, the food was far out-weighed by the horrible atmosphere, dismissive staff, and deafening noise level.   Quite surprising was the treatment of our entire party, in celebration of what they knew was a special occasion.  I did order a dessert, a passable creme fraiche cheesecake.   But wouldn't you think after the experience we had, that they'd at least comp the one, tiny dessert?  No, of course not.  Very poor pr judgment on their part.

When there should have been no question.  The tuna appetizer was okay, the lobster buccatini a little too sweet, though it did have a lot of lobster and it was tender and tasty.  I really hate to give a bad review, because I prefer to be positive, it's just I kept thinking....ohh, I could be having the tuna at Roys, or dinner at Nomi.    Oh, the bread was incredibly good, so I will give the bakery a shot when it opens.  yea!",0.8129,0.809,0.122,0.068,0.5187229437229437
2007-03-09,5.0,"Update: Had their kobe burger the other night and was floored.  I consider myself a bit of a burger snob and found this to be an outstanding example of the standby.  Great brioche bun, perfect amount of cheese, crisp lettuce, and a perfectly sized and sliced tomato with some salt and pepper on it.  Ridiculously good, therefore +1 star.   I ate at Aigre Doux a couple of weeks ago and came away fairly impressed,  though not totally sold on the place.  The decor was, as others here have described, sleek and modern, without giving the feeling of being overdone. I found the food to be good, not great, but I'm willing to attribute that to the relative newness of the place (it had opened a week earlier) and not the skill of those in the kitchen.   My one issue with the restaurant is the staff; I arrived somewhat late in the evening (9pm) and felt as if most of the wait- and bus-staff had called it a night.  We weren't the last people in the smallish main dining room, but unlike those at the other table we didn't strike up a conversation with our server and the manager and ended up waiting a while for our check.  I'd most likely head back there for the excellent pizza, but I'd probably spend my time at the bar rather than seated at a table.",0.9326,0.868,0.096,0.036,0.5850694444444444
2007-03-02,4.0,"Wow- 15 reviews for Aigre Doux already and it's only been open a little over a month. This yelp crowd really gets around, but I guess I already knew that.   I checked out this new hot spot for lunch today because I was interested in seeing what all the hype was about.  I enjoyed my meal, but I'm not sure it's the right place for lunch...but I""ll definitely be back for dinner. We started with the poached shrimp salad- delicious! The shrimp were absolutely huge and I know I'm going to have future cravings for the dressing they put on the salad.  We were just going to have that and the tomato mozzarella pizza, but our server insisted it wasn't enough food for us.  I definitely think it would have been enough food, but we added the crispy risotto and made it a lovely 3 course meal.  The pizza and risotto were not as good as the poached shrimp salad, but still tasty.  The service was so-so.  They were way too slow for lunchtime and there seemed to be a lot of confusion going on.  When they brought out our pizza the waitress asked if we had eaten it already or we were still waiting for it.  Kind of weird, but it is still pretty new so  we cut them some slack. I'd probably give Aigre Doux 3 1/2 stars, but I'm in a particularly good mood today so lucky for them they are getting 4 stars.  I did really like the atmosphere so I'm looking forward to trying dinner here and especially excited for the bakery that's opening up sometime in March.",0.9885,0.788,0.158,0.055,0.6342078419664626
2007-03-02,4.0,"I recently had lunch at Aigre Doux and was pleasantly impressed!  This new restaurant in River North across the street from the Merchandise Mart has minimal decorations but is very sleek and sophisticated.  The service wasn't the best, not great but definitely not bad for only being open a bit over a month.  I had the shrimp salad appetizer which was 3 jumbo shrimps with lettuce and avocado with some type of dressing that was extremely good.  The bread they serve is salty and delicious as well and it's probably a good thing that they didn't leave a basket of it- I would have eaten the entire thing.  Then we tried the crispy risotto- which was very tasty.  It comes as little risotto balls that are fried, so it's crunchy when you bit into it.  I thought they were very good.  Then onto the pizza.  We had the tomato mozzarella pizza and it was great.  Overall, 4 stars for lunch and I'm interested to go back for dinnner! Edit 4/11/07:  I've been back a few times since my first review and the food is still excellent. The service is still not great...they really need to work on the service.  The food takes a very long time to come out of the kitchen, and they seem to forget about bringing you the bill once you are done with your meal.  Ah, it's a small price to pay for delicious food though:)",0.9848,0.75,0.177,0.073,0.5493401759530793

Service could have been a little more attentive but did get better as the restaurant emptied out.   The vibe is very hustle bustle in a minimal designed space.  It's a  mixed crowd - trendy, business and couples.",0.8871,0.868,0.117,0.015,0.61875
2007-02-23,5.0,"Given the experience that I had here last night, I find it hard to believe that this place could be given anything other than 5 stars!  The food was amazing, the service impeccable and I have already recommended it to friends.  It's that good. Located by the Mart on Kinzie, while a little hard to find with its understated front (never did figure out if there was a sign- I found it by seeing the name on the valet sign!) once you move through the revolving front door you know that this is going to be a special experience.   The hostesses quickly take your coat (entering in your table/coat information in the computer so there is no need to find a coat check ticket) and you are invited to either have a drink at the bar or be seated.  I chose the bar.  The wine list is great and I loved the hammered copper bar top and the upscale ""bistro like"" feel. Once seated, our waitress was friendly and personable even giving us a tip on a very cool necklace that she was wearing.  Keep in mind that the servers don't really look like servers as they were all dressed in ""street clothes"" and it felt a bit like we were being taken care of by friends.  We went with all her recommendations (more on that in a minute) and then since the wine list is made up of many lesser known boutique wines, she offered to have the sommelier come to the table.   The sommelier (another woman I might add- there seems to be an amazing number of women workers in this place which I thought was great) came over and asked us about our preferences, etc and then recommended a Ridge full bodied red (I already love the Ridge winery so this was not a hard sell to me!)  What a great bottle of wine.  Full bodied, a little peppery- I could go on but let's talk a minute about the real star of the night- THE FOOD!!! We had two appetizers and two entrees that we split.  For the appetizers, the oxtail ravioli was amazing, full of flavor with a light reduction sauce.  The other appetizer was more complex with the centerpiece being cold white asparagus surrounded by a small serving of some type of goats cheese and a flavorful toast topped with a poached egg and some type of sauce.  As we told the server- there is no way that the menu description (or mine here, for that matter, does this dish justice)  I would go back just for that! As for entrees- we had the Colorado lamb chops (a very rustic feel) and the Turbot (which had a great sauce and had small brown beans as a side.  Both of these were amazing- although because the tables are close together- I was able to see food on the next table and I must say, the lobster pasta dish also looked great.   Did I mention the bread?  Served with unsalted butter that has been sprinkled with coarse grain salt- this bread has a focaccia consistency with a cheese crust that is soooo good- you really need to be careful or, like us, they will keep bringing it and you will end up full before your entree comes. As for dessert- the toffee pudding was a hit- although it does come with come candied oranges which was not mentioned on the menu.  Since I have an allergy to oranges- when the server found this out- she went back and pulled together a plate of small, yummy cookies just for me! As of March 1st, there will be a coffee shop and bakery located in the front of the restaurant.  It looks cute with crystal chandeliers, a light wood counter and several bistro type tables. For those of you driving- valet ($10) is okay- there is also a parking garage down at the corner of Wells and Kinzie.  If you are cabbing it- cabs are a bit hard to come by on this stretch of Kinzie and you might be better off walking down to Wells. If you are looking for a special night out- you should put this on your list.  I can't wait to go back to see what other things this little slice of heaven has in store for me.",0.998,0.851,0.136,0.014,0.5141637052831082
2007-02-18,5.0,"I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Aigre Doux yesterday. This is the new ""hidden gem"" for foodies. My experience reminds of the unexpected pleasure of Blackbird when it was first discovered. The food can best be described as American eclectic, with French & contemporary California influences. I would highly recommend the seared Ahi appetizer, the duck entree and the sticky toffee pudding. The service was impeccable. Of note, Meredith, their sommelier is simply outstanding -  engaging, insightful and very helpful.  This is a definite must-repeat many times. My only slight quibble is that they need a larger sign outside - I drove by and missed the restaurant the first time around.",0.9752,0.769,0.213,0.018,0.4668037518037519

I try to save 5 stars for places that I will rave about to friends, and this qualifies. The focaccia bread they serve to open the meal is amazing. They may sprinkle it with a dusting of crack, because I couldn't fathom only having one. Luckily they accommodated us with a second helping, though I was still discreetly licking my fingers so as to not waste any. We had the crispy risotto appetizer which was fantastic and salty. My girlfriend had the salmon and I had the lamb. She couldn't stop talking about her salmon all night and the lamb was wonderful as well. Everything worked. The wine by the glass list was small, but adequate. We were both very pleased with our choices. The table next to us was going by the bottle and got some great attention fro the sommelier. I don't understand beefs about the service, as ours was friendly, well-timed, and efficient. On the downside, the downstairs bathrooms smell a bit funny and the area is not quite finished from the remodel.

2007-02-16,4.0,"Came here for dinner last night and was very impressed overall. Here's the rundown... Decor: Combination of modern and 'Chicago loft' with a simple design, and very relaxed for the most part. Service: Excellent, from the front door to the bar to the bill. Food: Tas-ty. We had the Ahi Tuna and the Hamachi & Avocado appetizers... both were excellent. For dinner, the duck preparation (one of the best takes on duck I've ever had) and the mussels, which were good but not great. They were unfortunately drowning in a lemon bath. For dessert, split the chocolate crepes (with ginger and cherry sauce): unique and excellent. Booze: Wine's by the glass were a bit thin, but there was a wide variety on the menu for a 'American/French/Other' restaurant. Actually tried my first Lebanese wine here. Was also thrilled to see they had Steigl beer from Austria... I would definitely return - hope you find it as nice as I did.",0.9758,0.769,0.189,0.042,0.5935064935064935

2007-02-08,4.0,"I'm not big on writing reviews but couldn't help but write a note about my experience at this new spot, Aigre Doux.  I've eaten their a few times for dinner and once for lunch.  I'm hooked.  I don't care who they cooked for in LA or NY but they can cook for me everyday.  Just yesterday I stopped by for lunch and had the brisket sandwich.  My mother, I thought, made the best brisket ever, but I now stand corrected.  Sorry Mom (glad that she doesn't read blogs, I may be disowned).  I've tried a few desserts - can't believe how wonderful the sticky toffee pudding is, and the granite, and pot de creme (spelling??) are rich and yummy.  On the lighter side, the cookie platter is terrific too.  Obviously, I have a sweet tooth.  For dinner, I've tried the mussels (the best I've ever had and now I feel cheated because I thought that I knew how to cook these things but Mohammad has everyone beat); I thought that the salad was too heavily dressed, but I did love the healthy portion of blue cheese.  The shrimp salad is also amazing.  He says he slow poaches the shrimp in butter  (eeks) and that's the trick to juicy tender shrimp.  Who knew?  Regarding the service, I thought that they were amazingly together considering that they just opened.  I haven't had the long lines problem because I'm avoiding the weekends.  Midweek is a breeze.  I didn't find the wine list as limiting as some of you, however, I'm not a big drinker.  I did request that they carry an aperitif and they got it in (for me?)...Seems like they really want to please and that goes a long way.  I'm not wild about the bathroom situation.  Downstairs?  Otherwise, I like the design and think that this place is lit beautifully.    Everyone look good under the amber glow.  If you have the option, request a banquet seat.

2007-02-06,4.0,"I learned my lesson about visiting a restaurant during its first opening weeks, but w/all the hype I decided to try Aigre Doux myself.  And, having done so, I think James K and Ryan C hit the nail on the head with their reviews! We started off with the Roasted Beet Salad and White Asparagus which came out almost too quickly.  Our salads were amazingly fresh, layer upon layer of flavors that popped, and complimented our champagne choice perfectly.  I presumed that this foreshadowed wonderful things to come, but that was not the case.  We ordered the PEI Mussels and Slow Baked Salmon entrees.  They were luke warm, at best, when they arrived and did not hold up to the salads in taste.  The curry and coconut flavored mussels were good, but not something to write home about.  The salmon was a huge disappointment...edible, but a bit bland and overall, not more than average.  We decided to try dessert...order some sugar to sweeten up the night...the trio of ice cream was good and interesting, but the table next to us hit the jackpot with the sticky toffee (can't remember exact name) looked ooey-gooey delicious. The service was good and it was prime time, Saturday night...having read mixed reviews about such, I was pleasantly surprised to find an attentive and knowledgeable the staff. My boyfriend is the wine guy so I am merely passing along his sentiments...he was not overly impressed with the list.  I think he expected something more extensive and more choice beyond the US. I agree with other reviewers in the fact that there was a good variety of grapes and the list is representative of non-mainstream West Coast vineyards.  Alas, we did find a wonderful Pinot Noir.  Since this place is new, we are hoping  that they will tweak the list going forward. In my humble opinion, Aigre Doux has super potential, but I will wait a month or two before venturing back for my second taste.",0.9976,0.772,0.212,0.016,0.5389320029563932

2007-01-21,3.0,"This brand new restaurant just opened in River North, in Pili Pili's old space. This venture provides Mediterrean-inspired New American appetizers and entrees prepared by Chef Mohammad Islam and beautiful pastries by his wife Malika Ameen. The duo executes each's respective role dutifully, maintaining the feng shui a la Francais of the restaurant's name (sour and sweet in French) but, at least on our first visit, didn't wow us. The food, decor, and service were all good, but none of them were outstanding enough at the $75 / person price point to make the restaurant truly stand out in Chicago's crowded marketplace for New American cuisine, at least for dinner. The wine list was interesting and thoughtful. It's obvious that someone with a great knowledge of wine took the time and effort to really think outside the box to put together a list that's a good value, concise, and eclectic without being overly esoteric. We had two glasses of a reasonably priced '01 Bordeaux (9$ per glass) and a hearty Rioja Crianza which were both pleasant and complimented the food well. We also tried four savory courses: the lamb, feta, and olive topped greek pizza, the tagliatelle bolognese, the Niman Ranch Burger, and the Steak Frites, then finished up with a piece of Chocolate Mascarapone cake. The burger was delicious, with rich, high-quality beef cooked to perfection, complimented perfectly by bleu cheese and purple onion and the best of the five. Unfortuantely, though, it was a bit disconcerting that the most enjoyable course of a dinner that had a $150 tab was a burger. However, they do plan to gradually expand their offerings to include a bakery, as well as breakfast and lunch service. If well executed at a better value than their dinner service, this could make Aigre Doux a much welcomed addition to River North, where breakfast is currently under the hold of the oligarchs East Bank Club, upscale hotels, Corner Bakery, and Starbucks.
