The hot dog put a big smile on my face. I guess it's a ""food of love"" kind of thing. The ends of the hot dog are a little different from the center, so I'd eat those first. Spicy togarashi fries were delicious, and enjoyed the curry mustard.  My brother got the chicken, which was also delicious (garlic & oregano rubbed half chicken with chorizo rice & chimichurri sauce). Kimchi was surprisingly good.

2016-10-20,2.0,"I was in the area and love trying new spots. So I pulled up Yelp and noticed that the Belly Shack was near and had very high ratings. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  We ordered the Lemon Grass Chicken Gyro and the Korean Beef Steamed Buns. Both items were slathered with to much sauce which took away from the meat. The chicken gyro had a ton of lemon sauce that at times tasted as if I was taking a bite of bread and lemon with some kind of meat. Gyro's are a greek cuisine and if I recall, I don't think I saw a spinning chunk of chicken like they have at the Greek restaurants. I actually liked the salad on the side better then the actual meal itself.  The Korean beef steamed buns had more sauce then meat. If I am going to be paying $12 for beef I expect to have a nice size portion. Instead I got a bun filled with very little meat, kimchi slathered in some spicy sauce and more sauce added on top. It reminded me of an attempt of a sloppy joe Korean style. My overall opinion is that it is overpriced for mediocre dishes. I don't think they are quite there yet at creating the infusion of flavors they say they have. If you want to try a good place that has done a great job combining Asian and Latin flavors try Saucy Porka on Financial Place.",0.9714,0.877,0.112,0.011,0.5591623376623377

The belly dog has remained consistently awesome from the get go. The first time I had this, I had vowed to eat this at least once a week! Of course that didn't really happen but the thought that one dish could be THAT ridiculously amazing to warrant such a notion was a huge feat.   And don't even get me started on those fries and the aioli that comes with it - these are SO good, they rank in my top 3 fries. So why just 4 stars then? Well, the one new item that we try every time has been really sub par compared to the belly dog. Either we're just bad at picking what to eat or this joint has just one star dish. I'm opting to say that we have just been unlucky with our choices and give belly shack the benefit of the doubt.

2016-04-10,4.0,"** Part of my ongoing review of 2016 Bib Gourmand Restaurants (  yelp.com/list/bib-gourma…  ) Belly Shack is kind of like those turbo Volvos they made in the 1990's - not something you would give two glances at when at idle, but then you're surprised when the green light turns and it accelerates out of nowhere. Located in an unpromising location right underneath an El stop (a site that often features mediocre food all through the city), the space is bright and open with a bit of an industrial feel, but the same could be said about Chipotle, so there's not much to draw from this fact.  There is a short menu of sandwiches, bowls, entrees and soups for order at the counter, and the good news is that you really can't go wrong. I went with the pork banh mi sandwich, which rated among the best specimens I've had - the baguette was trimmed down so it did not overwhelm the other ingredients in volume, a common problem I've encountered with banh mi. The slaw was an excellent accompaniment, and the pork was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. It also came with an arugula salad, which could have been an afterthought but definitely was not in this case.  For a side, I got the tostones, fried plantains with chimichurri sauce. They were a satisfying crispy counterpoint to the banh mi, and definitely size to split with a table-mate. Speaking of which, my friend got a side of the hot tots - I like tots and will takes them over fries, but I can't say that these were much different than anywhere else (although they did feature some tasty pickled jalapenos). If you're choosing between the two, I'd definitely get the tostones.  Finally, I ended my meal with a tasty doughnut, soft serve and caramel soft serve combination. This was again a shareable size, and all of the components held up on their own.  So, those who stumble in here expecting a quick bite will be very pleasantly surprised - and those who came here knowing it is a bib gourmand restaurant will have no problem staying below the $40 before tax and tip threshhold while still enjoying anything on the menu that catches their eye. My total cost for an entree, a side, a dessert and a beer was $28, and it was worth every penny. I will definitely be back to Belly Shack.",0.9967,0.797,0.174,0.029,0.5709352209352211

I had the belly dog, which now seems to have less sauce, fewer noodles, and less flavor. I feel a bit unwell after eating.

I treated a couple of friends to dinner here after they helped me move in and we wound up all making the same order, so my taste sampling was limited here, but was excellent! We all ordered the Korean BBQ Beef, the Tostone's & the lemonade flavor of the day (Passionfruit). The Koren BBQ Beef was excellent, with just the right amount of sauce, full of a good hearty flavor and tender. For this alone I will keep coming back here! I like'd the tostones (I'm a fan of Chimichurri), but my friends were not the biggest fans, mostly because ours came out quite greasy. I will try these once more but if they are as greasy again this is an item I will pass up going forward. The lemonade was a surprise treat. Not expecting a whole lot, the passion-fruit lemonade was amazing and perfectly refreshing. The sweet bitterness of it cut perfectly into the rich flavors of the BBQ beef and make it a mandatory combo. Overall, it was a great little spot for a weeknight dinner or weekend lunch. While it's not expensive, it's not super cheap by any means. 3 of us ordering the Koren BBQ, a Tostones side & a lemonade came out to ~$65 with tax.

I'm a person of variety so the option of all 3 meats in one (pork, beef, and chicken) was what I thought would the way to go. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. The flavors were all over the place for my liking and didn't sit well with my preference. My boyfriend on the other hand devoured his bowl. To each their own! [2/5] They had a ""Belly Fire"" sauce for the taking (sort of like how Chipotle leaves Tabasco options out by the beverages... it's like that, but only one option). It had a citrus taste which I didn't expect from a hot sauce (assuming that ""Belly Fire"" meant hot sauce). [2/5] The Ambiance: I went at 4PM on a Saturday and the place was less than 1/4 occupied. It is a very open, somewhat small, and relaxed place where you order your food by the cash register and then wait for your food with a number. The service was good.

Blue line Western stop, armitage bus, western bus, easy-ish street parking on side streets. We managed to edit our selection to the pho-zole, belly dog, and brussel sprouts.. I am hooked on those brussel sprouts! The dressing has the most perfect balance of salty sweet tangy umami, and the crispy bacon... So simple, but when it's juuuuuuuust right, it's out of this world. We eat a lot of brussel sprouts in the winter at home with similar flavor profiles but from now on we'll just be attempting copycats of this one. Everything else was solid too. Togarashi fries with like a curry-mayo. Delicious. Pho-zole... BRILLIANT. The comfort of slurping piping hot pho and noodles, the hearty warmth of pozole, and somehow the flavor profiles of both really work together! I can see how it's pho-zole completely. Just masterful fusion. The belly dog had really interesting combination of flavors and textures too, but I found it hard to fit it all in my mouth for a composed bite... I wish I did though because based on the other two things, it seems like that's the whole key to their flavors here.

I highly recommend backing those up with a side of the fries (split them, it's actually a big order), which come with a tasty shake-on seasoning and a really good curry mayo sauce. My fries came out WHITE hot, very very good. The prices are reasonable, the service is very fast, and they were quite friendly. I was kind of impressed at their ability to accommodate a 2 year old as well - they were ready to go with a hot dog option on a really nice house made roll with a side of french fries (which the 2 year old's parents and I ate with that curry mayo when the kid got full). Big plus for that - I don't know how many they go through, but I really don't expect a sort of hipster fusion place to be toddler friendly.

2015-07-26,4.0,"What can I say about Belly Shack? Causal Fast Clean Good My friend and I were out in the city for a girls day/night. I randomly pulled up yelp and started searching for a place for dinner. Both of us didn't quite know what we wanted to consume but we had a general idea the food had to be unique. Belly Shack caught our eyes. We ordered two meals for the sharing and two drinks. Belly Dog: big enough to share and hit the spot without being overwhelmed. At first I was bit hesitant due to the fact I DO NOT EAT HOT DOGS. If and when I do there are specific requirements the dog needs to hit. The hot dog used for the Belly Dog was quite tasty and juicy. The overall taste to the Belly Dog was sweet, spicy enough for me not to chug down water, and slightly salty. The best part of the belly dog was the bun. The fact it held in all the ingredients stuffed on top of, the bun was a bit sweet and equally toasted & soft (the perfect combo). The bun brought together the whole taste, which I love as did my friend. The fries and dipping sauce were good. Lemongrass Chicken Gyro: The gyro was supposedly a special that day. I enjoyed the meal except I could do without the slices of the chicken gyro. I understand the Belly Shack was going towards the healthy gyro but a gyro is not a gyro without the greasiness. I would order the item again, don't get me wrong but I wish the slices of gyros was grilled or something that gave it some texture to the overall sandwich. My friend and I replaced the fries with plantain chips. Big mistake. We should have kept the fries. The plantain were not special. Passion Fruit Lemonade: I hate, hate passion fruit especially the flavor in drinks. Passion fruit always takes fake and sugary. BUT THE PASSION FRUIT LEMONADE WAS DELIGHTFUL and REFRESHING. The passion fruit gave the drink a bit of something-something. Sake Margarita: There was a third word but I don't remember it. After a few sips I cared less about the drink (didn't help the passion fruit lemonade tasted a lot better). The combination of the food and the margarita just didn't click with me. I don't know if anyone else had that issue but I did. I knew I should have finished the margarita before eating.  The service was quick for us. The female working the cashier was friendly and nice. She awkwardly stood at the counter waiting for us to make our decision. The price matched the quality of the food, always a plus. The ambience was clean and nice. The background music was indeed background. As for the design, I enjoyed looking at the decor. It fit with the food in my opinion.

2015-07-11,4.0,"Here's an example of how good food trumps everything else. We came on a Friday night around 8 pm and were happy to find that the restaurant wasn't too busy. We ordered a passion fruit lemonade, a belly dog, and a curry udon noodle. The passion fruit lemonade came in a carafe which was excellent, since you get a lot of it for three bucks. I was just expecting to get a glass of it, so good on them. The bad part is that it tasted nothing like passion fruit. It was super sour and felt like it came from a kids lemonade stand. That said, we couldn't stop drinking it! So just be aware that even though it says its passion fruit, its really just some good old fashioned lemonade. So after we got our lemonade we had to wait 27 minutes until our entrees came out. 27! For a place that wasn't busy you would think they'd have the food out to you in 15 minutes, max. 27 is an excruciatingly long time to wait for your noms. That being said, it was worth the wait. The belly dog isn't your classic hot dog, Its a hot GOD. They put fried egg noodles and pickled papaya on it with some spices that you've already read about here on yelp. But no one talks about the ""bun"". Its not a bun, its a thick slice of brioche or something. And its awesome. Perfectly toasted and soft on the inside, it was a nice surprise. A side of togarashi fries were welcome, since those are like four bucks on their own. The fries themselves are nothing special, just fries with some salt and spice. But the dipping sauce is really what takes it over the top. Its this kinda thai curry mayo that socks you in the mouth and then socks you again and again. Next, the curry udon. While the portion itself isn't very large, its large in flavor. A completely unique dish that has an Indonesian style curry with black beans, chicken, basil, and lemongrass. A lot of lemongrass. It just hits that line of almost too much lemongrass, but manages to stay under it. I've eaten a lot of udon noodles, and these were some of the best cooked noodles that I've ever had. Super thick and chewey and provided that bite you're looking for. Phenomenal dish. Even though both dishes are kinda small for $28 (with tip and a lemonade) and even though it took a half an hour to get our food, we would happily come back.

But if you get something else your experience might be better (other reviews of the Belly Dog also don't seem great, they should revamp the item that they seem to be staking their name and reputation on.) I'm recommending the jibaritos and fries because the fries I had with my Belly Dog were incredible, as was the curry dipping sauce.

Went in on a Tuesday evening at about 7pm. We were on our way home after landing at O'Hare and just wanted an easy take out dinner without having to resort to eating fast food. There were only 2 or 3 other people in at that time.  I had the curry udon noodle which was delicious and I can't wait to have again. My husband had the belly dog, which was even better than I remembered. The togarashi fries were perfectly spiced and especially good with the dipping sauce. Our friend had the beef taco platter, which I was happy to see they packaged the toppings and corn tortillas separately.   Prices were average and our bill for 3 people was just under $40. As always, the Belly restaurants don't disappoint. I will say, though, that as much as I like it, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here.    Only bummer was they wouldn't let us use one of our ""a la card Chicago"" cards.

The rest of the dish was good but the noodles,to me, are ramen. They were almost inedible. My son had the beef taco platter. Tacos and meat were good but the lentils were watery. The kimchee was awesome , as usual. We also had our old favorites, Brussels sprouts and  togorashi fries. These were as great as always.  But who goes to restaurant for just the sides? They no longer have my favorite GUS sodas so I was stuck with plain water. The worst part was there were gnats flying around us intermittently during dinner. Service was okay but not something exceptional. The food runner paid special attention to the table next to us, while totally ignoring us.

The restaurant was 3/4 packed and by the time we left, all the tables were full, so the place definitely gets a lot of traffic. I ordered: -Taco platter w/ Korean BBQ beef: this was a good dish. The tacos come deconstructed (w/ 5 tortillas), so you can make your tacos as big or as small as you'd like. The beef tastes like your standard KBBQ beef - nothing special here, but still good nonetheless. -Togarashi fries: these were pretty damn good. If you like salty (which I LOVE), then definitely get these fries. They're crunchy and have a generous amount of togarashi sprinkled on top. The curry mayo is awesome, too. -Soft serve: this was amazing! When we went, it was a vanilla soft serve that came w/ mangos and tapioca. The soft serve was creamier than your normal soft serve, which I think made the dessert even better. Note: one of my friends had the Curry Udon Noodle and said it was ""meh"" and that he felt like the ingredients were just ""thrown together"". I didn't try his curry udon noodles, but I trust his judgment. I should probably add that I'm from California, where we have a ton of food trucks and restaurants similar to Belly Shack, so the Belly Shack concept isn't new to me (which is probably why I wasn't blown away by this place).

Let me tell you, Marloe (so sorry if I spelled that wrong!) is a gem. She was able to cater for us no problem. I ordered 50 Hot dogs with all the fixins' fries, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and their signature passionfruit lemonade for us and it was beautiful.

2015-03-11,2.0,"So first of all, this review is only for the lechon ramen. Obviously, this is not a traditional Japanese ramen. Definitely some Latin inspired flavors going on here. It's pretty much ramen noodles in a pork broth, thin slices of pork (think like cheesesteak thin) cubes of salami, scallions, and crispy tortilla strips. (Also there were like 2 random pieces of broccoli or broccolini stalk in there? Didn't know if that was intentional..)  Noodles- Overcooked. Okay, so this bowl of ramen was at a whopping $13 + tax, which came out to nearly $15. I feel like once you enter the $15/bowl price range, you cannot afford to overcook the noodles! They better be perfect! Even though it is a fairly decorated dish with a lot of flavors going on, the noodles are the main component that helps the other ingredients come out. If the noodles are soft and falling apart, the dish is does not work.  Broth- rich, ideal viscosity, not too thick, not too thin, and this is a mark that a lot of Chicago ramen joints fail to hit. I would imagine it had a nice strong pork flavor, but the broth was very much overpowered by the salami taste, which had a strong sweetness to it, and also a slightly dirty pork flavor. But about the sweetness, I understand that this is a fusion dish, so it's okay to veer from the traditional Japanese pork broth. My issue is that the flavors should stay within the salty realm and not have any sort of sweetness. Because it is a rich, fatty pork base, it matches better with saltiness. Sweet flavors don't complement it and often make me feel a little sick.  Pork&Salami- this is a very meaty ramen. I will give props to the thin pork slices, especially because they were very well cooked, and a good variation of the Japanese pork belly. It worked really because they were lean slices of meat that were cooked long enough so that they melted in your mouth. The salami I felt was excessive and obtrusive. There was quite a bit of pork slices already, and adding salami on that was just too much meat, especially considering that, other than the small sprinkling of scallions, there were no vegetables. 2 different kinds of pork in a pork broth is not what I'm looking for. Also, like I said before, the flavor of the salami was sweet and strange, which flavored the entire dish in a distasteful way.  Tortilla strips were a nice touch. Thin, perfectly crispy, added a nice texture to the dish.  Seems like a cool restaurant, but I'm not in love with the ramen, especially with its $15 price tag. Especially because it's such an overly-trendy item in the city right now. Belly Shack seems like it has some creativity that other Asian/fusion spots in the city are lacking. I would like to see them do something a little more unique, and sets them apart from what the others are all doing.",0.9967,0.778,0.175,0.047,0.6112665343915344

I tell her I just want to place a quick pick up order.  Still puts me on hold. 2 minutes pass, 5 then 7 minutes.  I finally hang up and call back.  I tell her how I was just put in hold for 7 minutes.  She apologizes quickly and asks what I want.  I give her my order and she says it'll be ready in 10-15 minutes!  WTF!   So I arrive and give them my name 12 minutes after I called in.  The girl then tells me 'it'll be 5-10 minutes.' I even noticed they only had 8 people in the restaurant no tickets being made oh and my ticket prints up right as I pay!!!   I tell her my unhappiness so far and get a quick apology.  About 7 minutes later I get my food and she tells me she threw in a complimentary donut.  Thanks but it was way too late and really not something I wanted. I'm in the industry, have been since I was 7.  This service was some of the worst that I witnessed.  Don't ever tell a customer to call back that wants to put an order in for a later pick up.  Don't forget that you put someone on hold.  Don't tell a customer that you are really busy and then walk in to a 20% filled restaurant and not one ticket or cook on the line.  I do consulting on the side...maybe you should call me for help but I can guarantee I won't tell you to call back or put you on hold and forget, or tell you we are too busy.   Your food is great but operations need to change otherwise you'll never last in the long run. Ended up getting directly contacted from the owner.  She was very understanding and corrected the situation promptly.  Because of this I will go back for another try.  I thank the Belly Shack team for making things right.",0.9387,0.89,0.077,0.033,0.4345238095238094

Now is the time to test whether they're as good as my memory keeps telling me they are! First off the Tostones side dish with chimichurri sauce. Yup, first point to my memory. They're crispy, tangy, bursting with flavour and probably way too much for me to eat alone. Good thing I like a challenge! Main course I chose the Korean BBQ beef with kimchi and steamed buns. Good solid kimchi that I'm not sure is store bought or made in house but really good nevertheless. The beef though is the center piece of this meal and could stand happily on it's own. Juicy, extremely well marinated and the Korean BBQ flavour will coat the inside of your mouth well after you're done swallowing. However, it's always a shame to leave behind the residual sauce/gravy on the plate when you know it tastes so darn good. Viola, steamed buns!! The chef who put this dish together knows what he's doing. I admit without guilt that I mopped up every last bit of sauce with the buns and returned an extremely clean plate to the kitchen :) I know it's lunch time but a great balancer to the meal was the sake-margarita, how could I resist!  Overall the decor is simple but cool, they don't pretend towards fancy service or interiors and that accents the great food more than anything else.

If i had one request it would be for another bun to make delicious beef/kimchi sandwiches with, and maybe for the tostadas to be just a weeeee bit crispier (to offset the liquid chimmichurri sauce, of course).

I don't know what was going on with this sandwich. The somen noodles don't make any sense with it, nor does it necessarily complement the flavors or the textures of the sandwich. The meatballs were just OK, and the sauce was maybe a little too sweet. I did not appreciate the mint with this, either.

I ended up throwing away the remaining bun and noodles once the meat was gone.    Also, it would have been really great to have some napkins packed in my to-go box, because I have to say, eating this sandwich is quite the feat!  Also, I wonder if there might be a way to make the food just a bit cheaper, as over $10 for a sandwich (no sides) felt a little hefty to me.     I'm a big fan of fusion and innovation, however, so I'm glad I stopped by.",0.9768,0.801,0.149,0.05,0.500563909774436

I ordered the special that day which was a Porkbelly tostada while my friend and her sister ordered the Somen Noodle Salad and the Asian Pork Meat Sandwich. We also shared a side of togarshi fries which came with the curry mayonaise sauce. The food overall felt a little underwhelming and off balanced in flavor, which was a bummer bcause I so badly wanted to like this place.

Because for the first time in the 8 years that we've been together, I got to indulge in all those comfort sick foods I love without actually being sick. It was great. One of the places that we sought out to nurse hubby back to health was Belly Shack. We ordered the hot and sour soup, Brussels sprouts, Korean BBQ beef and the meatball sandwich. The only thing that we didn't really care for was the meatball sandwich. The taste for the first few bites was good. But it suffers from the construction. It's so big and deep that all of the flavors on the top do not get down to the bottom, which is a little dry. Also, I know that this is a quick serve counter place, but the stool was pretty uncomfortable on my boney ass. That soup, though, is my new ""sick soup."" And the beef had really good flavor.

But the epic fail was the service; the line took ten minutes to go through (with only six people, yes, I had time to count), and when you are talking about counter service that only features a dozen items, I had a hard time figuring out what the issue was.  Then, after a friend ordered an item that was entered wrong in the system, she was brought a quinoa salad instead of what she wanted.  Both sides were graceful about this mistake--the friend ate the quinoa despite not being a quinoa fan, and the server brought out some ice cream to make up for the mistake--but to get to this point, it took 30 minutes to bring out our food.  I'm a patient guy (my pregnant wife, less so), but 30 minutes to bring out a bowl of rice with tofu seems extravagant, and the quality of the dish ultimately was not worth it. This probably sounds like a two-star review, but I'm a fan of BYO anywhere and again, the taste of the meal truly was ""A-OK.""  But I won't be back.",0.6942,0.831,0.091,0.079,0.5041904761904761

It doesn't give off the Demon Dog vibe but I understand what it was going for.  As for the food. Got damn! All I can keep telling people is ""Damn! Those flavors.""  They jump out at you from scent to visuals. I was able to cruise somewhat of the menu since I went for lunch with a couple people. I had the boricua, the dog and fries, korean bbq and hot and sour soup.  There was not one shred of food left.  It all looks interesting and when you bite in it all comes together.  Some people may say its not spicy enough, which I agree, but also I believe spicy isn't what's going on with these dishes. Its fusion flavors which works. They do have a Belly Spice available but still didn't really provide the kick that most would look for. I honestly would consider bringing along some sriracha but really I just rather enjoy the flavors that I don't usually get. They are memorable.

2013-09-13,2.0,"My early dinner last Tuesday was possibly the least appetizing meal I've had in a long time. This came as both a surprise and a disappointment since I loved everything about both of my two visits to BellyQ (another of Chef Bill Kim's offerings in this great city). The chicken sandwich special was highly recommended by my order taker. I was expecting marinated chicken on a ciabatta bun with melted cheese, bean sprouts, and homemade giardiniera. The giardiniera was nearly nonexistent and there was twice as much surface-area to my bun as there was chicken. The sandwich itself was mushy and bland, it could have benefited heavily from any of acidity, spice, or crunch. The Brussels sprouts with chorizo were equally unpleasant as well. Overcooked and over-salted, I pictured them being ladled out of a giant stock pot used for keeping warm whatever was grilled the preceding day, as I forced myself to keep an open mind and try a few more bites. Normally I would have quietly voiced my displeasure, but I was worn tired from a long day, hoped those few bites would provide some form of sustenance through the evening, and didn't trust that I would have been happier with anything else on the menu. Atmosphere: 4/5 - A clean, stripped down to basics, hole-in-the-wall that is a little dark on a cloudy day. Good for both a quick bite and taking time to catch up with a friend. Fun salsa music playing in the background, but not distractingly loud. Quality: 1.5/5 - As displeased as I was, my experience wasn't bad enough to warrant anything less. Creative ideas, poor execution. Value: 3/5 - Average, straightforward prices for a simple menu that would be easier to justify had it tasted better. Consistency: n/a - I generally would want to try a place twice (in case the first was a fluke), but it might be difficult to convince me this time. Service: 3/5 - Average. Nothing to complain about, nor anything to boast of. TL;DR: Not worth your time or money unless a friend insists you join them.",0.9905,0.733,0.189,0.078,0.5275473137973138

2013-07-02,2.0,"I was very under-whelmed by Belly Shack, especially given the rave reviews it has.  Before I go any further, I would like to say that my favorite part of the meal was the Sac Sac that I also ordered, which is this fantastic Asian grape drink, that even has some peeled grapes inside!  Deliciously refreshing!  Definitely try some if you're there.  If it hadn't been for the Sac Sac, this review would have been only 1 star. The menu is a bit all over the place, seemingly focused on Korean cuisine, but incorporating various Chinese and Indian flavors.  I had the meatball sandwich, which I did not enjoy.  The meatballs tasted like siu mai (dim sum) and were flavorful, but fell short.  The sauce, modeled after gokujang, was flat.  The mint in the sandwich is almost interesting, but ends up being just unenjoyable.  The noodles were unseasoned, boiled in water, and did nothing to add to the sandwich texture-wise either, lost in the  bread (which was quite good) and just adding to the mess.  The best part of the sandwich was the raw soy sprouts, but there were very few of those.  As whole, the flavors lacked depth, bringing a crude intensity that left me wanting. For a place named Belly Shack, I expected to see elements of pork belly, but did not find any on the menu.  From restaurant name to menu, to menu items, Belly Shack lacks cohesiveness and depth, seeming like a crude mess put together with little thought.",0.2447,0.815,0.102,0.084,0.49166208791208804

2013-06-26,4.0,"My sister and I came here one evening to try out their famous belly dog.  It had a lot of hype of being one of the best non-traditional Chicago dogs in the area.  Belly Shack is indeed a little shack hidden underneath the train tracks.  Keep your eyes open or you may miss it.  There is a lot of street parking, but it is located around a really busy intersection.  So be careful crossing those streets. It took us a long time to decide what we wanted because everything on the menu looked delicious.  We ended up choosing a couple of entrees to share: -Belly Dog with Togarashi Fries: hot dog topped with kimchi salsa and fried egg noodles.  I don't really like hot dogs, but the belly dog was delicious.  I enjoyed the crunch from the egg noodles.  The fries were also good.  They were seasoned with some heavenly goodness called togarashi.  The fries were also accompanied with some curry sauce.  I'm not a big fan of curry, but the fries were seasoned well enough for me to enjoy them without any sauce. - Chicken with Brown Rice: served with broccoli, kimchi, and mushrooms.  I wasn't a big fan of this dish.  It was overly dry and didn't have enough vegetables.  I feel like for $9, they could throw a little bit more ingredients. - Tostones in a Chimichurri Sauce: deep fried plantains smothered with chimichurri sauce and lime juice.  The tostones were just ok to me.  Nothing bad to say about them, but nothing too unique for me to talk about them.   - Passion Fruit Lemonade:  mmm....flavored lemonade is one of my weaknesses.  I'm glad the lemonade wasn't overly sweet and had the right amount of sourness.  You order these by the pitchers, enough to share between two people. Overall, we enjoyed our experience at Belly Shack.  They have their ups and downs with their entrees, but I would return just for another belly dog.  It was one of the best tasting hot dogs I have ever eaten.",0.9931,0.761,0.172,0.067,0.5627819548872179

I will preface this by saying that I am not a fan of hot dogs but I decided that this item was worth the risk. I LOVED it. The Belly Dog actually reminded me more of a sausage than a hot dog.  The togarashi fries with the curry mayo are well worth it. Best yet, the fries comes with the belly dog. The portion was a great size too. I was full by my last bite.  I read about this being a restaurant where you order at the counter and then find a spot to sit. My anxiety was heightened at just the thought of having to hover to get a table. Luckily, I got there at a perfect time and we found a table right away (at 7:30pm on a Friday night). Over the course of the 90 minutes I was there, only at one point was there a line of more than 4 people.  Loved that it was BYOB. The noise or rumble from the train was not noticable for me.

2013-05-20,2.0,"WHAT'S THAT RUMBLING? At first I thought it was my Belly but then realized we were under the EL tracks or maybe it was both.  I am a big fan of customer service and I was not a fan of the front of the house here. The girl at the front counter looked like she hated it here. Her negative vibe was so not taking me to a happy place. How was I suppose to be happy? Doesn't she realize I've been dreaming of this visit for months? She was a complete Debbie Downer.  The first thing I didn't like was that she read the special sandwich off of a dirty post it note. It was a Burger and did not seem that complicated. It was almost 6pm. Couldn't she had memorized it by now? She also read it with no passion. I couldn't even tell you what was on it 2 seconds, after she was done reading the post it note. Again sell me the special and make me want it.  The second thing I didn't like was the attitude I got when I asked for no mint on my sandwich.  She looked at me in a snotty voice and said, ""We don't make any modifications!"" I was a little shocked at how abrupt her delivery was.  Maybe a ""I'm sorry"" would have sounded better.  I also didn't like the fact that the kitchen couldn't just not add mint to the top of my sandwich.  That seems a little arrogant.  What if I was allergic to mint?  I can understand many kitchens do not want to deal with special orders because it slows down the kitchen. But it was 5:30pm and we were the only people in here ordering food. The restaurant was empty.  Would it be that hard to just hold the mint? Apparently yes according to Debbie Downer.  I was so torn. Part of me wanted to just walk out with the unhappy attitude at the front counter but my desire to try the Asian Pork Meatball Sandwich kept me from walking. I was so close to my tasting my dream.  I decided to try and keep moving forward and placed my order for the #3 Asian Pork Meatball Sandwich stuffed with Somen Noodles, Korean Chili Paste & Mint. Yes I was getting mint no matter what.  I sat and waited.  I noticed the black egg shell sound proofing on the ceiling put in place to keep the sounds of the EL quiet.  It really didn't work but an A for effort.  My sandwich finally arrived and delivered by Debbie Downer. I was a little torn. First I was happy to finally try this sandwich.  The pork meatballs were delicious. In fact, I would be happy with just a bowl of these pork balls. The bread was tasty and toasted perfectly. I did have to use a fork to remove all of the mint from the top of my sandwich.  The Somen noodles were cold. Are they suppose to be cold? It was kind of a weird combination between the hot and the cold. I also loved the Korean Chili paste but there was not a lot of it on there. I could have used some more but I was too afraid to even talk to Debbie Downer at the front counter.  I just heard her yelling at me and saying, ""No extra sauce for you.  Didn't you hear me the first time? No modifications!""  In fact, it would have been nice if some of the sauces were available on the table or at the water bar.   So how do I rate this place.  I'm so torn because I want to put up a 2 Stars.  The meatballs were 4 stars but the front counter was 0 stars. I really have no idea which way to go.  I do know that I am glad I tried the sandwich.  The meatballs were amazing but the sandwich could have used a little more help. Would I come back? Probably not.  The meatballs were good but I did not find myself craving them an hour later.  My goal was to try this sandwich and now my Belly Shack experience is complete.  I do recommend you try this place and see what everyone is raving about.  I just hope you find a happier front counter person because the first face in a restaurant should be a pleasant one and not Debbie Downer.",0.9976,0.759,0.165,0.076,0.6051468846244966

We'd initially hoped to try somewhere a little more upscale, but we couldn't get into our first choice without an eternal wait. Runner-up or no, Belly Shack made a perfect spot to celebrate! We nabbed a big table in the center of the restaurant. Although Belly Shack's on the casual side, making us the dressiest diners there by a long shot, the relaxed, punk-ish atmosphere made us all feel at home. Taking advantage of the counter service, one of my friends ordered a plate of fries to share before everyone arrived and placed their order. Brilliant!

2013-03-23,3.0,"My coworker's student highly recommended this place so three of us decided to go after work last week.  It wasn't crowded, especially since it was 430pm on a Thursday.  I ordered the Korean BBQ beef, which was okay, but not mind-blowing. My side of tostones was easily the favorite dish of the table.  My coworker ordered the organic brown rice w/ beef, so the beef was similar to my dish.  I thought the brown rice could have been better texture wise. She ordered a side of the spiced fries, which were excellent in terms of crunch, size of each piece, and tasty side of curry mayo.  My other coworker order the quinoa ssam salad (meh, w/ the exception of the portobello mushrooms) and belly dog, which was my second favorite dish of the table.  I was looking forward to trying the bacon chocolate chip soft serve, but that flavor was not available during our visit. The dining space itself is very modern.  It was a little confusing listening to the Latin-influenced music while eating Korean-inspired food.  Throughout the meal I thought the place was going through an identity crisis...too many fusions and flavors!  Perhaps that's why the majority of our meals weren't memorable with brief hints of brilliance (tostones and belly dog).",0.986,0.849,0.143,0.008,0.570873015873016

We also had the meatball sandwich and the tostones. We took home leftovers as these are pretty hefty portions.  I would definitely come back since we were too stuffed to try their soft serve.

Feels gritty. The food. The food is tasty to say the least, but not cheap by any means. I embarked on my maiden voyage with the intent of getting the tostones and hot and sour soup, then I got distracted by the Korean bbq beef (my latest obsession) with kimchi. I topped the order off with a passion fruit lemonade. At $15 I was less than amused when the plate and tiny carafe arrived. Like a good ol' American I was like, where's the rest of my order? But once I started eating it turned out to be the right amount of food. Go figure. I was full, but not stuffed and I couldn't even finish the carafe of passion fruit lemonade. Although I gave it the ol' college try because it was so damn good.  The table next to me ordered the togarashi spiced fries and they smelled sooo good! I also intend to go back and try the tostones and hot and sour soup. I have mixed emotions about the Belly dog with the noodles. It seems wrong on so many levels, but is probably really good too.

We forgot about the BYOB, but popped into the liquor store next door and grabbed two cases of beer, making it an ever better time.  The only issue I can see with this place is the seating arrangement as it can get crazy packed at random times. The chairs are a little weird and pretty uncomfortable. Lucky for us, there was only one empty table with 4 seats in the entire place. it's like we were meant to dine here. I ordered the boricua and shared the fries and tostones with my bf. Being Cuban, I have an incredibly high standard for tostones and these were pretty good- not as good as my mom's- but no one can top that. The Boricua with tofu was pretty good and filling. It was kinda bland for my taste but I still ate every bite. Then I went back up for dessert and got the cinnamon caramel. It was delish and not too overly sweet. No complaints there.  The modern-industrial decor is cool for being near a train stop and more of a fast-food spot. I just can't give this place 5 stars because it didn't knock me off my socks.

Look: the vibe of the place is great. People bring booze and share dishes, lively but not loud.  Food: We had the meatball sandwich and the korean beef dish. Plantains on side. The beef was very tender, kimchi was good. The meatballs were good, too.  However, it was really really salty--the type of food where it tastes somewhat tasty when you're eating it, but later has you drinking water all night. Also, the pita bread that comes out with the bread and kimchi just seemed like forced fusion. I know that's the concept of the place, but pita is such a dry, tasteless bread (which is why it's great with hummus.) To eat it with the tender beef and kimchi... we just ate it to fill our selves up. A side of vermicelli noodles or even just a nicer, buttery role would have been tastier.  Overall, the food was nothing I dream about. Service: you go up and order, then the servers bring it out to your table. Our order was brought out in a random order, our side of plantains did not come out till we were almost done with the meal, and even our two entrees came out a good 7 minutes apart from each other.

2012-12-08,2.0,"belly shack quick overview too salty too expensive mildly confused concoctions.... errr, whoops my-bad: mashups details- we ordered: 1 korean bbq beef sandwich 1 pork meatball/somen noodle sandwhich 1 somen noodle/shrimp salad 1 fries 1 kim chi 1 izzies soda 1 ice cream $44 I have begrudgingly become accustomed to the $9+ sandwich. It's an unspoken line that chef's cross haphazardly either because an accountant priced the sandwich or because a chef's ego got in the way. The Korean BBQ Beef sandwich - Taking bulgogi and running it through a tasty BBQ sauce is a decent idea, and that's it. There was no sandwich, a pita-esque pocket bread type thing is cut into 4, a spoonful of bulgogi-bbq, and a spoonful of kimchi comes on a plate. The bread - which is an integral component to any sandwich is tasteless, dry and cold. The beef is salty and barely warm. The kimchi is tasty. Essentially you are left on your own to stuff the combination of kimchi and beef into 1/4 circles of tasteless cold pocket bread. The pork meatball/somen noodle sandwich - Another seemingly nice mashup idea within the context of a sandwich. Sadly the same bread as the BBQ beef makes another appearance but this time it's sliced in half for the sandwich fillings. Frankly with bad bread, the sandwich is cursed. The bread was again tasteless, dry and cold, the meatball was tasty, but barely warm, and the noodles appearance truthfully made no impact other than visually. I had hoped the noodles would have been steeped in a flavor so as to add to the overall experience, but they weren't,  the noodles were just a novelty act atop this mashup. The somen noodle and shrimp salad - I can't honestly delve too far into this as I am not as much of shrimp lover as my partner is, but I found the semi soggy tortilla chips at the bottom of the salad to be another novelty lost in a haze 'trying too hard'. The fries were real good n tasty, and the aoli was a fine addition. The kimchi had a different than usual tang that I liked, nice flavor, good heat... but very salty overall. Vietnamese cinnamon and caramel atop vanilla softserve - The cinnamon is quite amazing, and the caramel is very nice - but seriously not enough of either, so the dessert was 99% vanilla softserve... whatta jip.

The first time I had the Belly Dog, I didn't know what to think.  I knew I didn't hate it, but I wasn't sure if I liked it (does that make sense?).  It was just unique.  Knowing, however, that I was going to be back in area the following week, all I thought about was going back to Belly Shack wanting to try it again.  Upon further review, I have decided that I am a fan of the Belly Dog!   The flavors of a quality all beef dog, the subtle sweetness of the pickled papaya, and subtle flavor and crunch of the egg noodles all blended well together.  They also add some kind of chili sauce and top it off with tostones.  Paired with fries, the curry mayo is strong in flavor, but not overbearing.  I do recommend bringing along a breath mint as the curry & garlic flavors of the mayo stick around in your mouth for a while.  The meal does have a bit a spicy kick to it.  I'm not a fan of spicy foods, but I can deal with it as I think it just adds to the flavor, and doesn't overpower it.     At $9, its a great deal.  Initially, I thought that it was expensive until I realized that I spend that much money at Taco Bell.  This is a high quality meal, worth the price.",0.9708,0.845,0.122,0.033,0.4972777777777776

We came in for lunch this time around so I feel like I can do a proper review.  Last time was just for dessert, which I don't think counts. So you go up to the counter and place your order and you get a number and you find a spot to sit and wait for your food.  While you wait, you can go to the one side and get a glass of water and your silverware.  We didn't have to wait long for our items to come out - maybe 5 minutes tops.  it was fairly busy so that was nice. I had the somen noodle salad, which has shrimp, somen and tortilla chips along with chunks of citrus and jicama in it.  What is the best part?  The sauce that is on the whole thing.  Out of this world delicious!  Green and tangy and garlicy and amazing!  It's a perfect combination of nice, refreshing flavors and the portion is not so huge that you don't have room for dessert.   However, before you get to dessert, you have to decide if you want to be able to kill vampires or not with your breath.  If you do, and I am telling you that you do, you need to have an order of the tostones.  Tostones are mashed and fried plantains and what makes these special is the sauce - it's a chimichurri sauce (the same as on the somen salad, or very similar if they are not the same) that is loaded with garlic and lime flavor.  Holy cats is it loaded with garlic - it's been several hours at this point and I could seriously knock a vamp over with my garlic breath.  This is a good thing, nay, this is a great thing, and you need to have these with whatever main dish you choose. Now.  Dessert.  Soft serve with a couple of options for toppings.  These seem to change from time to time but right now they have a banana/ chocolate/ granola-topped soft serve and it is just right.  Great portion size and not too many bananas or chocolate to do away with the actual flavor of the soft serve.  I like that. Last, they have really good coffee, which is important to me.  I believe it is Intelligentsia but I am grading as awesome based solely on the fact that I could drink it black and without my usual loading of Splenda and milk.  Very good stuff there. Quick service to remove things off the tables and my to-go order that I placed for someone at home only took about 5 minutes to come out.  Friendly folks, too, who seem to give good recommendations.

Sorry, Chicago, but Kogi did it first and did it right. California reppin aside, I checked into the peculiarly named Belly Shack located in the Bucktown community area of Chicago not knowing what exactly to expect, so I ordered something that I was more familiar with to play it safe: Korean beef. When the dish came out, I was definitely a little heartbroken at the small portion size. Being that I was living off a research stipend and I was on a relatively rigorous workout routine, I was really hoping for portions more likened to those at Lao Sze Chuan than those at the Girl and the Goat. Nevertheless, the quality of food did not cease to excite my taste buds. The beef was cooked to perfection and the Korean-styled seasoning and preparation really hit the spot. In addition, the bread and kimchi were welcome complements to the beef. Still, I am/was slightly disappointed by the small portion size, and after the meal, I made the quick walk over to Arturo's Tacos to grab some burritos to make up for the missing Mexican aspect of my dinner and to satisfy the missing ""Belly"" component of my dinner.",0.8219,0.778,0.121,0.102,0.36677489177489186

Honestly, BellyShack reminds me of the Soup Nazi's from Seinfeld.  I put up with their policy for a very long time because I liked the food (overpaying many times for items that could have simply been substituted).  But If I don't stand up for what I think is right, then they will continue with their policy.   Perhaps, if enough people stop eating there then maybe they will see the light.  I KNOW, that I am not alone with people not liking their policy of no Substitutions under any circumstances.   I very rarely take the time to do something like this.  But I am fed up with their bogus policy and if I don't say something, then it will never change.  I hate drama, and I hate having to create uncomfortable situations  for people, but I am pretty pissed that I can't eat at a restaurant that I like because I have to follow my own principles.",0.0889,0.759,0.118,0.123,0.6374666666666667

The menu has a lot of options and also seasonal ones.  Ordered the Pork Meatball Sandwich, Boriqua sandwich with kalbi beef, and the watermelon salad. The best dish by far was the Watermelon Salad. The salad had egg noodles, bean sprouts, basil seeds, and a thai inspired dressing that definitely had fish sauce in it. The salad was light and hit all the spots: sweet, salty, sour, crunchy while the egg noodles made it a little more filling. My meatball sandwich came in a HUUUGE bread loaf and was stuffed with large meatballs, rice noodles (it was listed as somen on the menu), and drizzled with a red chili pepper paste sauce. First, It was a huge carbohydrate bomb, I don't know how anyone could eat all that bread AND the noodles inside. I took a few bites of the entire sandwich and then quickly just ate the noodles and meatballs from out of the bread. Second, the meatballs were tender but a little flavorless so I asked for extra sauce to dip them in which made it better. The sauce was a great riff on Korean gochujang. The sauce was complex while still maintaining it's ""Korean-ness"". The Boriqua sandwich was an interesting sandwich I've never eaten before. The kalbi beef was much too sweet for my taste, though, especially paired with the plantain slices. It was also an incredibly heavy sandwich without much to cut through (kimchi please!).

I've had it bookmarked for over a month. Basically, I was super stoked to FINALLY eat at Belly Shack. I just ate there with my boyfriend and I didn't even want to finish my food because I didn't think it was worth eating. He got the hot dog with a side of Brussel Sprouts. I got the meatball sandwich. I liked his because the crunchiness of the egg noodle was different and it added some texture to the hot dog. I didn't try the brussels sprouts. The fries were alright. Standard. The curry mayo was a nice touch.  I didn't like my sandwich at all. The meatballs were kind of tasty. It reminded me of dumpling meat. A little bit dry and bland. I had to go to the counter and ask for extra sauce on the side because I couldn't really taste anything. The rice noodles were bland, but you can't really do anything about that. To try to make up it, I tried some of the curry mayo on the meatballs and it was alright. I think it would have tasted better if the fried egg noodles were with the meatballs to give it some crunch with the soft meatballs.  The service was good. The lady at the counter was nice. We bused our own table.  Overall, I don't plan on coming here again. I don't think the food was worth it for the price. The only part of the menu that seemed innovating was the desserts and the hot dog. The other main items seemed pretty typical of a Korean restaurant. I kind of wished I got the Korean BBQ beef but it's only because I'm familiar with that dish.

2012-07-13,4.0,"Before heading to a concert at an area venue we decided to pop into Belly Shack to give it a try. Yes, its been raved about for some time now. Yes, I'm late to the party, but boy am I glad I made it!  For starters, the tostones are fantastic! The chimichurri sauce they come in is light enough not to overpower the texture and taste of the plantain but seasoned enough to give it some zest and pop! Our group got an assortment of menu items to give it a fair try: BBQ Beef sandwich, Boricua and the Asian Pork Meatball Sandwich.  BBQ Beef: Stole the show. I've had my share of kimchi and figured this topping would be just the standard but it was richier, sweeter and crispier than any  I've had before. Kudos there. It balanced out the spice of the beef and dripped perfectly into the flatbread bed it called home.  Boricua: Even for a veg. dish, it had heat, flavor and complex spices that made me forget there was no meat here! Pork Meatball Sandwich: Who knew noodles could be the perfect topping to a sadwich? Carbs with a side of carbs? Well, alright, just this once (until I go back.) The mint with the pork was another surprise, it really helped balance out the spiciness of the pork and chili paste, but the meat itself was well ground and tender. Not over dried and molded into balls of juicy perfect. Despite nontraditional toppings for a sandwich (ie: noodles on the meatball sub) the flavors were fantastic! Having been to the soup-sister of the Shack, I had a general idea what to expect, but I was way off. This was better than expected. The items were unique and packed a bigger flavor punch that I was imagining and left a lasting impression on my taste buds. For a busy night, the seating was available, service was pretty quick and everyone in the place was enjoying their food and being a BYOB, a few drinks as well.",0.9971,0.788,0.198,0.014,0.5241935483870969

It was very ""meh.""

Obviously, I enjoy the place given I am a returning customer, but a couple things will keep us from being regulars here in the future. The flavor combinations here are interesting and smart. Everything seems to work and execution is almost flawless. Although it is a counter service spot, the staff is still friendly and attentive. I don't love that the orders come out incomplete from the kitchen which can make for awkward dining amongst a larger group but as my small family was sampling everything it wasn't a big deal. I also wish they had high chairs. I realize the restaurant is not geared toward children but I have an adventurous little girl who we like to take out with us and it was harder to get her focused as she sat atop her own little stool, the same as mommy and daddy were sitting in. High chairs are inexpensive, and I would bet you could even find one to match your hipster decor....in case you are concerned over messing up that aspect of the business. My only real criticism about the food is the price to portion ratio. I know that they are using high end ingredients and sourcing some things locally, which is awesome, but seriously, $3 for some McDonald's style fries from your freezer is a bit high, which leads me to believe that some of the other prices may be a little on the high side as well. Having said that, the aioli served with them is truly 5 stars. Too bad I won't order them again based on the sub par fries.  So I really do like and will eventually return here, just not as often as we may like based on their kid friendly-ness and questionable pricing.",0.987,0.792,0.15,0.058,0.5343197278911563

The brussels sprouts with chorizo might be one of the most addictive dishes I've ever eaten.  Honestly, I like to just get that as a meal - for $5 it's a large portion and it's delicious.  It can be a little overwhelmingly salty, but in a more umami sort of way and not overbearingly salted.  I think it's obviously a result of the saltiness of the chorizo, so it's not as though you wouldn't expect it in the dish. The Korean BBQ beef is packed with flavor and possibly just as addictive... in a different way.  When you eat it by itself, it's a pretty straightforward dish but can be a bit overwhelming because it's a strong combination of flavors.  When you add in the Kimchi and the almost sweet bread, you can taste how each piece of the dish compliments each of the others, which is the beauty of that dish in my mind. I've had the Belly Dog, Meatball Sandwich and the Boricua - all delicious - but I certainly wasn't in love like I am with the sprouts and the beef.  Other highlights - the hot & sour soup I found neither spicy nor sour, BUT, and this is a big BUT, the smoky flavor of the chicken really lends a hand to a soup that I would have found somewhat bland otherwise.  The soft serve - I've tried a few - is so far very good in its simplicity and execution of the flavors.   Definitely also try the specials if they sound like something you'd like - I've never been disappointed.",0.9955,0.789,0.189,0.022,0.6074310776942357

The b/f had the Korean BBQ, I didnt take a bite, but he said it was pretty tasty.  I had the brown rice which was decent.  Definitely the kimchee was good, but I'm also Korean and by no means is it completely authnentic kimchee, it's definitely a variation on the traditional dish making it more palatable to the general public, but good nonetheless. I also had the sweet and sour soup after reading the reviews and quite honestly, it lacked for me, it was a bit on the salty side and wasn't sure why people were raving about it.  Afterwards, tried the bacon, chocolate chip with ice cream, it was okay.   So all in all decent experience, I would go again, but wouldn't be completely stoked about having to go.  I'm more leaning towards 3 1/2 stars, but wanted to be generous.",0.9895,0.797,0.18,0.022,0.5277777777777778

Soft shell crab atop a coconut scented (and flavored) both of various mixed veggies and shrimp. I really liked the coconut aroma, but the flavors were quite subtle. I should have added some heat to kick this one up a notch or two. Some type of cool, drizzled edamame: 2/5: Yeah, another special from the day that I could have done without.

2012-04-11,4.0,"Damn, this place is good. Well done Chef Bill Kim, well done.  Asian Pork Meatball Sammy - Huge sandwich for a big appetite. Giant Asian (meat)balls that pack a ton of flavor on their flat bread. I think their bread makes the sandwich, light and fluffy and a good vessel for the meatballs. The hint of mint was surprising and refreshing. It offset the Korean chili paste and wasn't too spicy. Loaded with Noodles on top? Not the crispy noodles, soft and delicious. I could eat this sandwich daily. Priced at $9, some will complain, but seems pretty consistent with other Chicago eateries. Wish it came with a side though. My only complaint was I think my meatballs were slightly undercooked, pink in the center. This didn't bother me much but to others maybe.  Belly Dog - Like a hot dog on steroids. Again, the flat bread makes this unique hot dog even better. The pickled papaya and crunchy egg noodles on top make for a big tasty bite... this guy gets messy. With a little curry mayo on top, this was one of the best hot dog's I've ever had. Added bonus, the #4 Belly Dog comes with a side of Togarashi spiced fries. These were delicious when dipped into the curry mayo. They were a bit salty with the spices, but really good nonetheless. Worth the $9. The #11 brussels sprout & chorizo side was also really good. I have a weakness for brussels sprouts. Makes me think I am eating healthy, even if it is cooked with deliciously greasy chorizo. This was good and a sizable portion for $5. Easily shared for 2. Last but not least, the bacon chocolate chip ice cream was... for lack of better words... good as fuck. I have a crazy sweet tooth, always needing dessert to end my meals and always snacking on ice cream. And of course, I love bacon. Bacon makes everything better. They make they ice cream to order here, which I thought was cool. The girl cooked up their delicious concoction on a burner like it was some science experiment that turned out deliciously wrong. She poured the mix into the machine that magically turned it into ice cream. It was like magic before my eyes. Bacon bits and choco chip cookie crumble on top topped this off. I might be stopping in just for a cup of ice cream.  The Vietnamese Cinnamon Caramel was also good. Like other reviewers, I don't see how this is Vietnamese but you can definitely taste the subtle cinnamon flavor and the caramel on top was nice. Needed something crunchy, but this was also carefully crafted over a burner. Very cool.  This place is pretty simplistic but speaks loudly with it's flavors. My first experience with Latin-Asian fusion and I was pleasantly surprised. Some will say it's expensive, but $35 for a meal for 2? Not bad at all, plus I was stuffed.

Special of the day: Udon Curry Noodles with Sausage ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sKyA… ) was probably my favorite; the curry wasn't overwhelming and the sausage gave it a bit of salty taste to it. Tostones ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sKyA… ) (crispy plaintains chips with chimichurri sauce & lime zest): I love chimichurri sauce and crispy plaintains, but they can definitely hold back on the lime zest it was very acidic. Brussel Sprouts con chorizo ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sKyA… ) definitely tops the list as being innovative. I was skeptical at first, but after the first bite I kept wanting more. Desserts ( yelp.com/biz_photos/sKyA… ): my gf & I both had the soft serve: I opted for the Vietnamese Cinnamon Caramel and her the Bacon Chocolate Chip; the cinnamon caramel was way too sweet for me and we both weren't fans of the bacon.

2012-02-07,3.0,"With David Chang and Roy Choi rising to Korean bad boy chef stardom in New York and L.A., Bill Kim must have seen his moment.  With its semi-grungy semi-industrial street art decor, Belly Shack looks like a trendy spot run by a male Korean-American chef in his thirties.  Chef Kim probably likes old school hip hop, and his picture confirms that he wears both a mustache and a beanie. I'm not saying Belly Shack is derivative - it just fits into a family of restaurants that has met wild popularity in our nation's largest cities.  It turns out Korean flavors are adaptable and delicious, and Chef Kim has married his culinary heritage with that of his Puerto Rican wife.  It's a ""Ko-Rican thang.""  Fair enough. Michael K. and I met Janice K. here for our last meal in Chicago.  We showed up early, and it was empty.  We had a roomy table, with plenty of space for our luggage, too.  I liked Belly Shack's set-up.  It was comfortable and casual, but definitely stylish.  We ordered our meal from a young, good-looking cashier, and our food came out quick. The meal started off great, with edamame, hot and sour soup, and Brussels sprouts and chorizo.  The edamame was good, tossed with shallots and a heavy portion of ""Seoul sauce.""  I figured Seoul sauce would be some combination of soy sauce and sesame oil, but it was more interesting that, with a nice spice and vinegar tang.  The edamame weren't quite addictive, but they were good.  The soup and the Brussels sprouts were easily the highlights of the meal.  The soup was an Asian take on tortilla soup, with hominy, chicken, and cilantro in a bright, delicious, invigorating broth.  I rarely have tortilla soup, but this was, somehow, my second of the day.  It beat Topolobampo's fancier version by a zesty mile.  The Brussels sprouts and chorizo were superb, sauteéd just soft enough.  The flavors were bold, with fish sauce and cilantro chiming in with the sprouts and sausage and crushed tortilla chips. From here, though, the meal went downhill, with the rest of our food falling a bit short.  We ordered three entreés, and none of them did much for me, though there were things to like about each one.  First, we tucked into a Boricua with Korean BBQ beef.  This was a clever sandwich, served between two large flat slices of crispy fried plantain.  I liked the starchy effect of the plantain.  The marinated beef was also tasty, and it was accompanied by some brown rice and Hoisin BBQ sauce.  This was probably my favorite of our main dishes, but even so, nothing popped for me.  The brown rice was pretty mushy and non-contributing, and I wanted a little more spark.  Actually, a table bottle of sriracha would have gone a long way here.  The Belly Dog showed a similar level of fun and innovation in concept.  This was a hot dog in pita bread topped with egg noodles, crispy shallots, and pickled green papaya.  I liked the texture of the egg noodles, which were sometimes crispy and sometimes soft and fully cooked.  Again, though, this did little in the way of wowing.  Again, sriracha might have been the missing link.  The dog came with a side of togarashi spiced fries with curry mayonnaise, and these were decent.  The fries weren't memorable, but the curry mayonnaise hit the spot.  Finally, there was the Asian Pork Meatball Sandwich, a ridiculous football-sized pita stuffed with meatballs, somen noodles, Korean chili paste, and mint.  This one had a nice drizzle of hot sauce - not sriracha, but ggojuchang.  It didn't save the day.  The size was silly.  The sandwich was really hard to eat, and ultimately, not worth the effort.  The meatballs were flavorful but not particularly delicious, and the somen noodles that took up most of the space were pretty untextured and bland. For dessert, we shared a soft serve with bacon chocolate chip, and this was pretty good.  The soft serve was creamy, and I liked the little bits of bacon.  The chocolate chip cookie chunks, though, were hard and possibly stale.  Still, it was a nice way to end the meal.  Maybe better with sriracha. I'm only half kidding about the sriracha.  I don't actually think sriracha improves everything, but it's a great shortcut to Yumsville when you're not going to make it on your own.  I put it on Domino's, Costco frozen cheeseburgers, that sort of thing, as well as almost all leftovers.  Of course, sriracha also goes well with a lot of great food (see, e.g., David Chang's pork buns).  Belly Shack's food would make sense with sriracha, and since some of it can use a flavor boost, I don't think putting some on the table would be a bad idea.  I think this place has a lot of potential, but the execution was not always there.  If the deliciousness of the soup and Brussels sprouts could find its way into everything else, Belly Shack would be a gem.  In the meantime, cock sauce in a squeeze bottle might take you part of the way.",0.9991,0.782,0.176,0.042,0.5859352453102451

2012-01-29,2.0,"""Promise you won't try it without me."" ""I promise."" And then my dining buddy left for Korea for eight months. Imagine my excitement when she finally returned and suggested we hit Belly Shack for a late dinner. After parking around the corner, we sauntered in. The place was bustling but had a few tables open late on a Thursday night. We approached to the counter, waffled back and forth over the tasty-sounding options, and opted for the Belly Dog, Korean BBQ platter, brussels sprouts and chorizo, and a big bottle of sparkling water. Sitting down by the door (poor choice for warmth; great for people-watching), we waiting about twenty minutes for our food to arrive. Food was served as it was finished in the kitchen and the brussels sprouts arrived first. Diving into my favorite vegetable, I was sorely disappointed. The brussels sprouts themselves were tender and perfectly cooked but the chorizo was oily, crunchy tortilla chips (I believe?) were interspersed through the dish in an unpleasant textural contrast, and the entire bowl was doused in fish sauce. Entirely too salty and funky-tasting, I picked out the bits of brussels sprouts but left three-quarters of the plate untouched. Next out was my Korean BBQ platter, Bill Kim's take on bulgogi. The beef itself was tender and lean, although the marinade could have used some spicy saltiness to counteract its incredible sweetness. Served with fluffy flatbread that encourages the diner to make his or her own sandwiches, I was reminded almost of a Korean twist on Chicago's iconic Italian beef sandwich. The plate also had an ample pile of southern-style kim chee, spicy and tangy with chili paste and big crunchy chunks of cabbage. Perhaps this was supposed to be the savory counterpart to the sweet beef? About five minutes after my food arrived, my dining companion's Belly Dog finally made its way out. Topped with chili paste, crispy egg noodles, and papaya, the dog was a big hit. Served atop a pile of Togarashi fries, she and I could not keep away from the addictive curry dipping sauce. As we wrapped up our meal, we crept to the counter to check out the soft serve options, ultimately settling on homemade vanilla topped with chunks of chocolate chip cookie and smoky bacon bits. While a tasty, sweet foil to the exotic savoriness of the rest of our meal, we found the soft serve surprisingly sweet for a Korean-inspired establishment, having hoped for a tangier yogurt base. Overall, Belly Shack was a decent experience-- interesting menu; cool space. But given the overwhelming saltiness of the dishes' executions, hands-off service, cost relative to quality, and strange pace at which our meals arrived at our table, I'll probably pass on future visits.",0.9943,0.856,0.123,0.021,0.5214197530864196

Absolutely delicious, gluten free, and full of vegan and vegetarian choices. Latin and Koren fusion, you rock. We ordered a smorgasbord of food from here on Saturday night. We called in an order and the pick-up time was a wee 10 minutes. At 9pm. On a Saturday night. Point 1, Belly Shack. Here's what we ordered:  *** Boricua (marinated beef): this was my meal. My taste buds were in heaven. Slightly spicy,  full of flavor , and big enough for two meals. The meat was so savory and the rice was the perfect compliment. The plantains topped it off as the best dish I've had in a long time.  *** Asian Pork Meatball Sandwich: the husband had this. He loved it. He loved my dish more, but what can I say? I always pick the best dish. :)  *** Quinoa Ssam Salada: Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. Along with the Boricua, this might have been my favorite part of the meal.  *** Tostones: Yummy, crispy plantain chips. It came with a zesty little lime dressing. A bit spicy, but so worth the inflamed tongue.  *** Togarishi Spiced Fries: We were afraid these would be a bit soggy by the time we got home to eat them, but we were actually presently surprised what great shape they were in! These also came with a dipping sauce (curry mayonnaise, I believe). The sauce evened out the spiciness of the fires.  *** Brussels Sprouts and Chorizo: Who would have though I'd enjoy Brussels Sprouts...ever? Even a vegetable-hater would rethink their dislike for veggies! These were awesome. Flavorful and full of texture, these were gone pretty quickly.  When we stopped in to pick up our dinner, we actually met the chef, Bill. He was really friendly, down to earth, and extremely modest. He suggested several other restaurants owned by his chef friends- they're on our ""next to try"" list.  Finally, the price is unbeatable! So incredibly cheap! The entire order cost around $30.

I tried to eat here last night but I was turned away from the woman behind the register who rudely informed me that there was nothing here I could eat on the menu and she couldn't help me out.  Why? Because they refused to simply not sprinkle cilantro on as a garnish over the top of the dish I was trying to order.  The restaurant's policy is that there are no substitutions or modifications to each dish. While I would like to try to understand this as a way for the chef to preserve his ""vision"" of each dish, but I think its safer to assume their motivation would be based on seat turnover which directly impacts profits vs. any kind of ""vision"" of a dish.  I cannot understand how a new restaurant will stay in business long alienating their customers.  Also, how is preserving your vision of how a dish is supposed to taste even achievable when there are many of us out there who taste cilantro as soap.

This really concerned me, I did not eat it. My husband did..... Not smart he was sick, and let's not get too detailed, but it was really gross. The fries were fries, average with seasoning served with a mayo based sauce, which obviously had sat out near heat ( it had that discolored film on it). Another pass for me.

The promise of delicious food and convenience put excitement in my heart and the potential of what lies within in my dreams.

The menu is small, but unique. I tried the Korean Beef right off the bat as plates of it were being served around me, and I was surrounded with the sweet aroma of spicy beef and a sort of fried curry smell. I had to try it. If I'm being honest, it may have been the most delicious Korean Beef I have ever tried. The fries were also tasty but were magnified by a most succulent sauce with the distinct essence of curry I had picked up during my wait.  Off the chain. They also had ridiculous flavors of ice cream that, unfortunately, I was too full to try. But the next time I'm in I might just have to try the Bacon Chocolate ice cream. Because if there's one thing I like more than bacon, it's bacon. All in all, Belly Shack is a solid place to eat and utterly convenient for the residents of west Bucktown.

The first time I came here, I got a chicken rice bowl and my S.O. got the beef rice bowl. It was incredibly sweet, and the beef my S.O. ordered was marinated like bulgogi, but it was way too sweet. My chicken was cooked nicely, but the whole bowl was just too sweet. It was also super greasy and had a ton of flavor - almost to the point where the flavors were too confusing and nothing really tasted ""together.""  Completely opposite of that, the side of tostones drenched in chimichurri sauce was absolute heaven. It was a standout dish, and I could have eaten the whole basket of them!

The jibarito came in a basket, wrapped. At first, I thought it was a burrito. But alas, upon unwrapping the dish, it was a jibarito. I attempted to pick it up and eat it, but it slowly fell apart and the plantains were STUCK to the wrapper! Needless to say, my jibarito became a beef-plantain salad as I had to just eat everything with a fork. Also, the bulgogi beef was still too sweet for me, and I have no idea why they stuck the organic rice in there. The bean sprouts in the boricua were a mismatch. The whole sandwich was messy and the flavors were disappointing. It all tasted like sweet beef mixed in with potatoes. Nothing really exciting.

2011-07-22,5.0,"I sometimes wonder if new restaurants started by already-successful chefs who have established a cult following, like Bill Kim, the owner of Belly Shack (and the also-awesome Urban Belly), face a ratings disadvantage.  Readers who are fans of the chef's established restaurants try the new one with sky high expectations.  When the new restaurant fails to deliver exactly what these readers love about the chef's already-established restaurant, these folks over-react and give the new place low ratings.  Couple that with the fact that established chefs tend to attract the worst sorts of hyper-picky foodies (or, I should say, food fetishists) for whom eating is not an end in itself, but rather a means to writing critical reviews, and you have the great Yelp paradox:  famous chef's new place ends getting ratings that don't reflect its awesomeness.

I'll be honest, I wasn't impressed by Belly Shack's sister, Urban Belly. It was okay, but not wow-ing. Belly Shack, however, was something different. It was a little more up my alley. Hidden under the Western Blue Line stop, this spot is so urban. You can tell by the decor. The seats. The walls. The graffiti. The order numbers. It's so street. The locale. The ambiance. The food. Forreal street. You're not going to get a bowl of rice with some pork belly. That's for communal seating restaurants, a la Urban Belly. At Belly Shack, you get food you eat with your hands. My girlfriend and I got the Belly Dog, Boricua with chicken, and hot & sour soup. The Belly Dog is topped with egg noodles, cilantro, and pickled papaya on a pita-type bread. Brilliant. Truly brilliant. Easily a strong competitor in a city with some top dogs. It's also served with togarashi seasoned french fries. The fries are SO good. They come with a dipping sauce, but I honestly thing they can go without it. The Boricua is...a sandwich I guess. Instead of bread, it's hugged by fried plantains. The sandwich also has brown rice, hoisin bbq sauce, and [in my case] chicken. It took two bites to get used to biting into plantains instead of bread. But I forgot about Wonderbread and began to fall in love with crispy yellow plantains. The one that surprised me most was the hot & sour soup. It wasn't traditional by any means. Imagine a bowl of hot & sour soup making a love child with tortilla soup. That's pretty much what you get with this Belly Shack bowl. It's so freakin' good. I was really hesitant after looking at the menu. Why? Because there weren't many choices. That kinda made me have high expectations.

The pork sandwich was flavorless, except for the mint which overpowered any semblance of meatiness which the meatballs may have had. bean sprouts and noodles were unncessary add-ons that did nothing but dilute the overall flavor even more. the kicker in all this is the side of kimchi, a ridiculously tiny portion for $4. As opposed to an entire mason jar full for the same price at Del Seoul. not only that, the ""kimchi"" was a homemade bastardized version which offered no vinegary bite or acidity that is essential to this korean staple. so for $27, we got an over-priced sub par meal. the highlight of the meal was looking outside the window at the giant McD's ad offering a pineapple smoothie. i'd rename this place Belly Shanty.",-0.8859,0.898,0.027,0.076,0.4629629629629629

I saw who was eating there, and they were hipster white folks like me. Please do something to firm of your tofu, it's nasty.  The seasoned fries were good, but fries from anywhere served any way are good. You have to really try to mess up a fry.   Final complaint: the seating. We ended up at that giant communal table in the middle and it sucked.

I love Asian and Latin flavours. Together? It's a taste explosion! Their Korean bbq plate is superb. The kimchi is perfectly balanced. The chicken curry is fresh and the cut of chicken is high quality, never fatty or dark meat. The plantains are fantastically prepared and seasoned. And the bread, my goodness, that bread. It's so darned good that it is worth this wheat-intolerant stomach's bloat to have a little taste. The Vietnamese cinnamon caramel ice cream is worth the visit alone. Third, the service is always friendly. The staff know the food. They have eaten it and can give the uninitiated an excellent recommendation. They are quick to help you out and never make you feel rushed. Which is easy for places that offer a fast casual style of dining to do. Not at all here. Finally, the price is completely fair.

I said it before, I'm saying it now and I will undoubtedly say it again.  I've never met a french fry that I haven't liked.  So it goes without saying that I thoroughly loved the togarashi fries.  And dipped in curry mayo - yes please.  I think in a previous life I was a Belgian because I firmly believe mayo belongs with fries (I may also have been a fat Southern woman - more on that another time).  I also enjoyed the tostones though they bordered a little bit on the soggy side as opposed to crispy.   Like I said, I'll give this place another chance.  I like the hybrid-fusion thing this place has going on.  I think the food at Urban Belly may be more geared towards my tastes so I might give that a whirl before I head back here.",0.9883,0.787,0.174,0.04,0.44325396825396823

It looked cozy, urban minimalist, a menu inspired by fresh ingredients, and a creation of chef Bill Kim's.  What is not to like? I ordered the Brown rice bowl, the togarashi fries and my friend had the Boricua sandwich.  I really liked that they offered brown rice, a nice option for people who are looking for healthy whole grains.  I opted for the tofu as my choice of protein, the other option is chicken or beef.  The tofu was firm and fresh, nice to see that it wasn't the deep fried version.  A thick sauce covered most of the bowl like a blanket and a small serving of kimchi was tucked away on the side.  A scattering of crispy shallots garnished the dish and provided a nice textural crunch to the softness of the tofu.  From the first bite, I knew there would be some trouble finishing this meal.  The sauce was incredibly sweet, to the point where I could feel the sugar burn on my tongue.  It reminded me of a sauce that would be on some generic Chinese fast food dish.  I can appreciate the marriage of sweet and sour flavors, but the sweet factor was way out of balance.  There was no depth to this sauce, no garlic, onion, just syrupy sweet.  There are so many amazing flavors that go into making a great asian sauce; scallion, sesame oil, soy, garlic and ginger.  If there were any of those ingredients in there, I would never know.  You could have dumped some random vegetables, had whatever protein you wanted with a mystery grain and never be able to taste any of it because all you would taste is sweet sauce.  There was no spiciness to this dish even though I did see some red sauce, which I can only guess is their version of Gochujang, a Korean pepper sauce.  I love kimchi, and was hoping that the sour salty flavor would balance out the sweeter flavors, well, keep dreaming, it was a sweet salty slaw.  If I wanted that much sweetness,  I would have ordered dessert.  I wish they would rethink this dish because I think this could be a flavorful and healthy dish on their menu.  The sauce to ingredient ratio was also a bit off as well, a lot of sauce doesn't equal amazing taste.   On another note, I did enjoy the togarashi fries, thin crispy and just the right amount of salt.  I wouldn't come back just for the fries.  I will always give establishments another chance and am willing to try other items on the menu before making a final judgement on this place.  I always want great places to succeed, but on great cooking and not just on hipness alone.",0.9985,0.742,0.224,0.034,0.5197402597402597

The soft-serve ice cream is, at the end of the day, still soft-serve ice cream, but the toppings are delicious, and the whole menu is some pretty daring stuff that's fairly affordable.  On the other hand, everything is really shockingly salty. And oily.

The hot dog went down really quickly because I just couldn't get enough of the sweet and sour combo! Plus those fries were crispy delicious. My friend ordered the Organic Brown Rice topped with Chinese Broccoli, Mushrooms, and Kimchi. I got to try a few bites and loved the flavors and stickiness of the rice. Who knew healthy could taste so good? We also split the side dish of Brussels Sprouts mixed with Chorizo and I almost didn't let my friend try any of it. The salty chorizo really added to the flavor of the caramelized brussels sprouts. That is now officially one of my favorite dishes of any restaurant in Chicago! I'm gonna try to make it at home but it probably won't taste as good!  Definitely give Belly Shack a try. And one day soon I'm going to try the original Urban Belly.

Paleo sounds rough doesn't it...). When I went in, they refused to sell me a hibarito without the disgusting sugary crap sauce they put on it and told me they wouldn't hold anything.  I'm not really sure how someone who eats gluent free could eat here, and I don't really think that the person who planned the whole gluten free pitch knows what gluen free is really about.  I wonder if they batter their plantain chips in flour ....

The thai pork meatball sandwich, case in point:  the flavor is great, but the texture is too homogeneous.  The meatballs are soft, the noodles are soft, and the bread is soft.  How about some crunchy vegetables in there to liven things up? The barbecue beef is somewhat too sweet and the accompanying kimchee lacks bite.  The somen noodle salad is tasty and interesting (particularly the exquisite cilantro dressing) but the corn chips are too salty. The brussels sprouts with chorizo--genius!  I love the brussels sprouts renaissance, and this side dish is a nice vegetable (although not vegetarian) accompaniment to a main dish or sandwich...but...there is too much chorizo!  I wanted to taste the vegetable more.  There was a little pool of grease in the dish.  Too much of a good thing!  Cut down the chorizo by 50% and this marvelous little dish would be ideal. Even the famous soft-serve with famouser Mindy Segal toppings was surprisingly normal.  Sure, mint-brownie bites atop vanilla ice cream is pretty darn good, but it was neither the best soft serve nor the best brownie that I've ever had.  And when you get the cinnamon-caramel variety, the ice cream is half-melted by the time it gets to your table. I have to admit that the hot and sour soup has no flaws.  I love the hominy and the occasional discernible cumin seed.  Two thumbs up on the soup. So...3.5.  I'll definitely eat there again.  And I'm sure that I'll enjoy it.  But am I the only one who thinks that each of these items is just one tweak away from greatness?",0.9957,0.719,0.214,0.067,0.5524621212121213

And chatted.  And chatted.  No food (I think they were done well before I got there).  And, diners waiting on a seat just piled up.  And, there were two large parties of eight who were also just loitering (hipsters....go figure).  Be patient when you go....you WILL be waiting, if you decide to eat there.   So, now for the food.  As it was just me, I only ordered one dish -- #1 Korean BBQ beef (with kimchi, ssam paste, scallions, and served with flat bread).  I'm going go out on a limb here and tell my fellow Yelpers that the kim chi is possibly the best I've ever had (not having been to Korea, I think I can say that).  They make it themselves, and it is delicious.  Spicy, sour, crunchy, briny.  Wonderful...would've loved to have taken home a jar.  For me, that alone was 3.5 stars.  The BBQ beef was basically bulgogi.  But, with flatbread?  A bowl of rice would've been preferable (apparently they also offer rice bowls, but, that was not obvious).  At least I could make little sandwiches with the beef and kim chi.  The beef was flavorful, and really did remind me of good bulgogi...that day, it was a bit salty, but being a salt freak, that was okay with me.  I have no idea what ssam paste is...and, the word ""paste"" is just to un-appetizing.  I would order this again....bring it home...and cook a pot of rice to with it.

How about 4 days later. the soup. that damn soup.. and THEN I discovered the greens and chorizo.. when they say 'greens' they mean Brussels sprouts. Do you know what I love? yep..

The good: The Kogi is good, the kimchi is both cucumbery and cabbagey which made my day.  The Japanese Curry Mayo dipping sauce for the fries. Seriously, I want to start and end everyday with a mouthful of that. The decor is a neat sort of minimalist industrial and it fits well with the location under the el tracks.  The tostones! The garlic/citrus/cilantro chimichurri was BOMB. Not only that, this was the only place I've ever ordered fried plantains, bulgogi, and french fries all at the same time! The tofu in the cuban sandwich - props for having vegan options, and for paying attention to detail for this amazing dish. The Bad: The ""bread"" for the deconstructed Kogi sandwich. Honestly, it's a ten dollar sandwich. I think they could've done a tiny bit better than packaged pita bread from Dominick's. The bread was the weakest link in what otherwise would've been the perfect dish.  The french fries - while the seasoning was perfect and the curry mayo was equally awesome, they were bagged and frozen french fries and it almost hurt my feelings that they didn't care enough to use fresh potatoes.

2010-10-04,5.0,"I can't say enough good things about Belly Shack. This place is the best new edition to the between-Logan Square-Wicker Park area in ages - and BYOB to boot! I've been going regularly since last winter, and I should have written a review long ago. I've tried most everything on the menu at this point, and it's all excellent. I have yet to go wrong. Standout entrees for me include: the Korean BBQ Kogi, the Lemongrass Chicken, and of course, the Belly Dog. I love a good Chicago Style hot dog, but that Belly Dog is a revolution - and I believe they've added it to their daily menu now, rather than having it just on Sundays. It's served on one of their fresh, hearty loaves (sort of a cross between a thick pita and... I don't know, something else, more European perhaps... it's just right though). Inside the bread is a bed of crispy, thin egg noodles, the dog of course, and a pile of scallions, crispy garlic, kimchi salsa, and probably some other stuff. And of course it comes with the incredible Togarishi Fries with Curry Mayo... So. Effin'. Good.  I've loved everything else I've tried - Summer Watermelon Salad Special, Asian Meatball Sandwich both kick-ass. Hot and Sour Soup w/ Hominy, Togarishi Fries w/ Curry Mayo, Braised Brussel Sprouts or Greens w/ Chorizo, Tostones w/ Chimicurri - all excellent sides to share. If you've still got room after your main course, definitely try the soft serve! Bacon Chocolate Chip is the most eye-catching (and it's tasty) - but the Vietnamese Cinnamon Caramel is the real standout here.  My wife and I used to stop here last winter for Sunday brunches, no matter how brutally cold the morning, it was nothing a bowl of the Hot and Sour soup couldn't fix. I can't wait to do it again this winter. This food has an uncanny ability to feel really hearty, wholesome, and home-cooked, while still being really exotic/interesting fusion. It's hard to explain it fully, but everything about the place works toward that for me. The staff has always been great, and Bill Kim, the chef, is often there. I love the cafe style pay-when-you-order, DIY water/silverware, etc. Despite this, the staff is still very attentive, walking around to fill water glasses, and so on.  Some yelpers seem upset by the prices on the menu, which surprises me. I always feel like the prices are a great deal, considering how good the food is. Though it is presented and served very casually, and it's a very stripped-down menu, I consider Belly Shack to be on a similar level of food-quality with Lula Cafe... And the portion sizes? I have a big appetite, and I always leave stuffed. I don't think I've ever spent more than $15 for myself (and that's encompassing an entree and a side).

A meatball sandwich, an order of fries and a can of diet coke was $14.  The sandwich was a funny shaped half pita with three meatballs and some spaghetti noodles (looked like spaghetti noodles to me anyway) and a dollop of hot sauce with the ubiquitous cilantro on top.   For the price it was lame.  And SALTY. Everything was so salty it burned my mouth. At first I thought it was the seasoning on the fries but everything is way over salted and over seasoned. They love their cilantro here too, man alive. I get what the other reviewer meant when he said he was burping up this stuff for hours afterward. I will say that the curry sauce for the fries was freaking awesome .

The menu is short and sweet,  I love small compact controllable menus.  I opted for the chicken sandwich,  over marinated (rubbery)  way too much marinate residue,  it clung to my teeth and wouldn't leave.  The bread was reminiscent of pizza dough and was too fluffy and big too really make a sandwich out of.  Then,  afterward,  the belching began.  A raw garlic experience I have never felt before,  it brutalized my system,  for hours. The Korean BBQ beef was very tender thanks to a brutal pounding under some sort of mechanical tenderizer,  the meat was very tasty and well seasoned.  The bread was much better matched to make little sandwiches,  although the portions are quite small for the price. The menu is interesting and I would love to try other things,  but eating here has caused intestinal distress in both of us and many other Yelpers.  I do not think this is a food poisoning issue at all,  the amount of spices,  marinade and overall seasoning is just way out of wack.  I believe they are marinating the meats too long and over seasoning some things,  because of this I won't go back.  The lemonade was as good as I have had,  the room is sparse and the music........................ethereal?

2010-08-23,4.0,"Last Friday I had just finished post-work gym time so I was ravenous for a late lunch (I heart summer hours). I called up my friend who, as a teacher, was also done for the day and asked if she'd like to meet me for a bite. Based on our locations we decided that the perfect place to meet would be Bucktown and the Belly Shack immediately came to both of our minds. Neither of us had ever been there but we had both been wanting to go for some time so admittedly we were really excited. I was coming via Blue line (man, is this place convenient to get to or what?) so I got there earlier than my buddy who was driving and looping around looking for parking. The space was empty (4pm on a Friday) but the staff wasn't pushy or miffed when I sat down without ordering anything right away. The gal behind the counter brought me a couple of menus and told me to take my time. I love not being rushed!  When my friend arrived we devised our plan of attack. I'm attempting to do this ""healthier eating"" thing but I also wanted to be sure to try some things I wanted so we decided to split a few items so we could enjoy a few things without feeling completely guilty (ha). We both went for the Korean BBQ Kogi ""sammich"" and since we were both craving french fries we agreed to split the Togarashi Fries with curry mayonnaise. She got their house made lemonade which I tried and immediately regretting not getting myself (to the point where I didn't even finish my sad Diet Coke out of protest).  The BBQ was excellent. As explained by other reviewers on here the ""sammich"" comes to you in a basket with flat bread on the left, BBQ beef in the center and then the kimichi on the right and it's up to you to arrange these the way you'd like on your bread. Oh man, YUM. The beef was cooked perfect, tender and juicy. The sauce was nice and sweet with a little oomph. The kimichi gave it a nice ginger bite.  The fries were perfect! Warm and crispy and that curry mayo? Oh man. I've been craving that stuff since!  After a moment to digest my friend and I decided that we HAD to try the ice cream. Being that I'm a little over bacon since my attendance at Baconfest in April I lobbied for the caramel cinnamon ice cream which she graciously agreed to split it with me. Oh man. That cinnamon was out of this world! I don't know if I've ever had cinnamon that good. And the caramel! Oh dear. That' was good stuff. A really nice end to an excellent meal.  A lot of reviews complain about the price and I totally get it. It is a little pricey once you add up any sides and beverages you get and the ice cream of course. But I wasn't that miffed. My friend and I split some sides which cut down on cost and since I've been watching my food intake I didn't even finish my sammich so I had enough to take home for another meal. Not to mention I was really full when I walked out of there so in the end I wasn't weeping for my pocket book.

I ordered the boricua sammich, which was delicious, though it was a little sloppy (this one is definitely meant to be eaten with a knife and fork).  The tostones were even better - hot and crispy with a great Chimichurri sauce that had just a hint of citrusy spice.   Considering that it's a walk-up counter with mostly sandwiches, the prices are a little steep, but the flavors are good and the menu is creative.  Certainly worth the trip.",0.9849,0.754,0.2,0.047,0.5837662337662337

It's like going to a korean BBQ place except you don't wreak of BBQ after eating. I would have never thought to pair korean BBQ meat with pitas but it works. The spiciness and crunchiness of the kimchi cuts the sweet/ginger of the meat perfectly.  -the noodle meatball sando: Another unlikely combination but meatballs sounded delicious. It's very strange seeing what looks like to be spaghetti in a pita but I went for it anyways and was pleasantly surprised.  -fries with curry mayo: Curry mayo is 5 x tastier than ketchup. Yum. I could eat that curry mayo with just about everything and it would taste good. -bacon chocolate chip ice cream: Interesting flavor combo, but the execution fell a little short. The bacon wasn't very crispy and tasted like bacon bits. The cookie tasted a little stale.  Skip out on the bacon chocolate chip ice cream but everything else is highly recommended.

The decor is very industrial, the chairs are metal, the lighting is warehouse/high traffic lights, and the artwork is rough. For the decor sake, the food fits...the menu is simple: sandwiches, sides, and soft serve. We had the meatball, lemongrass chicken and tilapia sammies. The winner here was the meatball, which were meatballs with hot sauce on top of noodles...in a bun. Very tasty, and the lemongrass chicken came in at a close second, the spices were nice and the chicken was juicy. A side of spicy cabbage came with the chicken.  We also got absolut-fabu watermelon salad, which was watermelon, arugula and basil seeds. The seeds didn't really do much, but the light dressing with the fruit/veggies just made a really great flavor and texture choice. Really liked that one, but it was on the specials menu, so not sure if it will be there again. We also got the togarishi (sp?) fries and sweet potatoes. The fries are addictive with the curry mayo, and complemented all three of our sammies. The sweet potato we could have passed, they were just enh. For dessert, we had the bacon choco chip and caramel cinnamon. On the menu it said the toppings were from Mindy Segal, so that was a plus! Both of the soft serves were great! The bacon choco chip is exactly what you would think it would taste like, but the bacon flavor kicks in at the end.  The caramel cinnamon reminds me of a cold solid horchata, and don't let that cinnamon fool you, it's strong stuff.  The food was solid, and the service, although it's a ""fast food"" atmosphere, the servers poured water and took trays away.

That particular intersection that's sort of in no man's land on the cusp of Wicker Park/Bucktown/Humboldt Park NEEDS something trendy, cool and moderately cheap.  I kind of laugh at the comments saying that Belly Shack is over-priced.  Is it?  Mmmmmaybe a little.  But it's not going to set you back any more than, say, buying a sandwich at Letizia's just a few blocks away on Division.  And, while I enjoy Letizia's, the spices in the food at Belly Shack make the cuisine more exciting, in my opinion. I ordered a Lemongrass Chicken ""sammich.""  I really wasn't in the mood for a sandwich; however, the salad options weren't getting me revved up.  It wasn't them.  It was me.  I'd just worked out - do you ever get that way?  Where you're hungry but nothing really sounds good?  Yeah, it was like that.  So the Lemongrass Chicken sounded like an okay option.  I figured I'd just deconstruct my sandwich when it arrived.  No need!  The sandwich is actually served so that you can assemble it yourself.  This pleased me greatly.   I also ordered a side of tostones to share with my dining companions.  Although they were especially oily, the spices were out of this world.  We're talking serious punches of flavour!  LOVED it. The decor in Belly Shack is something that I find especially appealing.  It can best be described as ""industrial.""  Concrete, steel and particle board are the primary materials.  Usually when you see a restaurant with industrial design, it tends to be kind of cavernous, giving the sensation of always being empty.  Frankly, I like that Belly Shack is a smaller restaurant.  Even with the ""colder"" materials, there's a welcoming coziness.   So why four stars instead of five?   One of my dining companions has very specific dietary needs (we're talking ""visit to the emergency room"" if she ingests the wrong things).  She kept explaining this patiently to the person behind the counter who, while nice, just wasn't getting it.  My friend can't have bread.  It can't even touch the other food on her plate.  When requested that the bread just be eliminated from her plate completely, the answer she received was ""No substitutions, sorry.""  When Belly Shack says ""no substitutions,"" they mean it. Also, while I don't think the prices are outrageous, $11 for a sandwich with no side dish is a bit on the high side. So there you have it.  If you want a delicious sandwich that's a cool Asian/Puerto Rican fusion of flavours and don't mind shelling out a little extra for it, Belly Shack is definitely your go-to place.",0.993,0.773,0.158,0.069,0.5870408163265305

Our sandwich orders got messed up, our sides came out after we were half way done with our sandwiches and what made the situation more sucky was that the servers were kinda nasty about it.

The menu is quite short - just a handful of sandwiches and sides.  Based on reviews, I ordered the Asian meatball sandwich.  It was packed with flavor!!  Such a unique combination of very fresh ingredients.  Sure, it cost more than the average sandwich ($9), but it is more than the average sandwich - a true warm meal with fresh, interesting ingredients. I couldn't pass up the bacon chocolate chip ice cream for dessert.  I wouldn't recommend paying the $4 for a dessert that was way less interesting than its name implies - softserve ice cream with glorified bacon bits. While bacon does taste delicious in almost everything, I'd save the calories for eggs or spaghetti. On visit two, I tried the lemon grass chicken sandwich and again was wowed by the interesting combination of flavors.  I give the nod to the meatball sandwich only because I prefer spicy to non-spicy.",0.9921,0.765,0.199,0.036,0.5163082437275984

There were less people there than I expected for 7:30pm on a Saturday night. I was a bit shocked at how empty it was, but it boded well for us as we lingered, drinking our wine. Oh yeah, and it's BYOB which is delightful. Now on to the food! My friend had the special which consisted of some kind of shredded beef jibarito-esque concoction ... she liked it. I got the tilapia and it was delicious!!! A beautifully seasoned and cooked piece of fish topped with some greens, sitting atop some flatbread. We shared the tostones, which were flavorful and crispy. And the food came out lightening fast. We also indulged later in the soft serve with the Vietnamese cinnamon caramel topping, as it was suggested to us by one of the servers.

I do like the interior more than Urban Belly, though the big communal table in the middle was empty while all the smaller tables around the perimeter were full. I get that they want to encourage communal eating, but listen to what your customers want! I had the bulgogi sandwich (pretty good, but the flavors were pretty ordinary and nothing stood out), the chicken lemongrass sandwich (this was underwhelming with smallish chunks of chicken that contained quite a few pieces of gristle). The seasoned fries with the curry dipping sauce were really good, though, and you do get a lot of them. We also shared a yuzu lemonade that was perfect to share and very tasty.

2010-06-04,5.0,"I've been wanting to try Belly Shack for a long time, but I have stayed away because I've heard/read mixed reviews from friends and yelpers. I am now kicking myself for not coming sooner and forming my own opinion (you yelpers are quite persuasive though). I took my boyfriend here on a Thursday night, because we both were in the mood to try something new. Belly Shack is a pay at the counter, then find a table, where the servers will bring you your food, establishment. I had every intention of just ordering the Tilapia Sammich because I was in the mood for fish, but when we got to the counter we were informed that they had only one left  of their Belly Dog special. I am a firm believer that if any restaurant tells you  they have one left of anything...YOU ORDER IT! So in addition to the Belly Dog, we order the Tilapia Sammich, Asian Meatballs, Tostones, Greens & Chirizo. Yes that is a lot of food for two people (which is something we were told when paying), but when trying a new restaurant, my motto is go big or go home.  Let me start out by saying everything was excellent. Really bold flavors, unlike anything I have had before. Surprisingly the Greens & Chirizo side was both of our favorite dish. I don't know what Bill Kim has put into that broth but my boyfriend and I were fighting over the last spoonful. On to the Asian Meatballs...yum yum yum. The flavor combination of the sauce on the cold noodles with the hot meatballs was spot on. There was also a very strong lemongrass flavor that I was very please with. Then came the Belly Dog. One juicy beef dog sandwiched between fried egg noodles and kimchi salsa. I specifically remember my boyfriend asking if it was alright for him to finish that last few bites...my answer...hell no! It was by far my favorite of the sammiches (my boyfriend liked the Asian Meatballs). Also, the Belly dog comes with amazing seasoned fries with a curry mayo. Genius! Lastly we shared the Tilapia which was tasty, and I do not regret ordering it, but it wasn't our favorite. The Tostones were delicious as well. Fried plantains with Chimichurri Sauce, how could they not be? Lastly, we ordered their soft serve with homemade toppings. I know your probably thinking how in the world could we have room for dessert, but we all know there is a separate dessert storage in our stomachs. We ordered the tapioca & strawberries (have to ask for it, because it is not on the menu) and the chocolate chip with bacon. Both great!  The fruity one was more light and refreshing while the chocolate bacon was rich and bursting with bacon flavor (can you guess which one I choose?) Our experience at Belly Shack was superb. I understand where the yelpers are coming from as far as price goes because our bill was around $55, but it is also BYOB so I understand that they have to make SOME money on their food since they aren't on alcohol.  I will 100% be returning to Belly Shack, and bringing my foodie friends with me.",0.9982,0.832,0.155,0.013,0.553980622552051

I shoulda skipped the bread & the empty carbs altogether. The flavor was fantastic, and definitely surprising, but in a very good way. The only thing that was a bit over the top was the amount of garlic in this thing. I took it home to eat & threw the package in the trash there - my husband came home 5 hours later & asked what the heck I was eating!

The space is very cool, and while they have a sort of table service, you have to order from the menu at the register.  Now, it seemed that they were trying for a sort of Asian-Latino fusion, but while daring and creative the place missed the mark from A-Z. I had the tofu jibarito with a side of greens and chorizo. The greens were amazing and the only thing everyone enjoyed. Others had the fish, and others had the coconut chicken. My jibarito was terrible. Traditionally this sandwich is served with garlic paste or garlic mayo, and there was none. The plantain bun was terrible, thick, and tasted nothing like the amazing jibaritos available all over Puerto Rican Chicago. The tofu, was not marinated long enough to take in the flavors, and so eating a block of firm tofu was the basic experience. The others didn't finish the food and left feeling let down. My other friends were almost universally disappointed with the meals they ordered.  I give them a big E for effort (I liked the skate trucks as bathroom door handles), but a C for execution (staff were friendlybut the no table serivce/server thing is just dumb).

After debating whether to drive or take the L we ended up driving only to realize that it was tucked right underneath the blue line western stop.  This place is simple on apperance but bold on flavor.  I already love the fact that it was BYOB and casual.   I ordered the spicy fries with curry mayo and the blackened tilapia.  The fries had a hint of lime and chile powder and the curry mayo was a great combination.  Making it very hard to stop eating them!  The blackened tilapia was on top of a grilled flatbread and was dressed with fried shallots and baby greens.  The tilapia was so fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was drizzled with that same curry mayo which made every bit more mouth watering.

So much so that, even though it's near my hood and I pass it every single day, I did not so much as consider going in until about a month ago. Why the bad attitude? I loooooooved Vella. It was all I could think about on Saturdays, and it was one of the few places I would go to by myself. Sitting alone? Who cares? That food was my crack. So fast forward to last month. After an exhausting day of work and school, I was starved and couldn't imagine spending the five minutes it would have taken to make a sandwich at home. In my moment of weakness, I stopped at the Belly Shack and went in. So the decor is obviously very different from Vela- honestly, I'm not crazy about it. It's trying a little to hard to live up to the ""urban"" part of its name. Gray is not a color that incites my hunger. However, once I bit into my Belly Dog (a special on Thursdays I think), I forgave the decor. I'm not usually a big fan of fusion- just leave well enough alone for godssake- but these flavors actually worked. Good spice level, though it's a mess to eat (don't order this if you're on a first date!). The tostones are also a success--the chimichurri had plenty of flavor and the tostones were fried to perfection. Although the food was wonderful, I have to dock a star for the prices- for a place that's so ""urban,"" they are definitely not catering to the Humbolt Park urban dwellers.

Don't be fooled by the limited offering; you will find something on the menu that you want.  Chef Bill Kim does a wonderful job of keeping menu short but diverse.  There are no filler items here.  Each item looked like a winner.   I went with the Belly Dog which is a grilled hot dog set on egg noodles and a toasted pita, topped with pickled green papaya.  My vegiance (vegetarian fiance) ordered the Boricua, an asian vegetarian take on the jibarito filled with black beans, tofu and brown rice.  We ordered a side of togarashi spiced fries and soft served ice cream for dessert (mine topped with bacon and chocolate chip, her's with huckleberry-lime).   The Dog: the hot dog had the nice charred taste that always makes me wonder why people would even consider eating a hot dog boiled.  The savory mixed with the sweet & sour of the pickled papaya really knocked my socks off.  The egg noodles didn't really do much for me.  They would have been a lot better they were fried until crispy and slightly burnt, like Singapore noodles. The Boricua: The plantain slices were thicker and softer than what you would normal see on a jibarito.  Eating it was a little messy but it was delicious.  The black bean is a nice touch though it would have been nice to be able to get a full bite of everything at once.  Our sammich was falling apart. The Fries:  ooooh, the fries.  Why have I not eaten anything like this before?  Its so simple, yet so perfect.  The fries were perfectly cooked (thin style, crispy outside, soft inside) and seasoned with Togarashi spice (the blended chili powder typically put into Japanese noodles or soups).  They were served with a curry dipping sauce which was absolutely amazing.  When the fries were done, I wanted to use my fingers. Soft serve: The soft serve was good.  The huckleberry lime was really good.  The bacon chocolate chip was a hit and a miss.  The chocolate chip cookie bits are provided by Mindy Segal (Hot Chocolate) and were great.  The bacon... SOMEONE PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG... was essential bacon bits.  As a bacon lover, I was really bummed out. The verdict: its a little too expensive to eat there every day but if I could, I would.  The menu is simple but daring and I can't think of any time where I wouldn't want at least one of its items.  Belly Shack has a perfect mix of friendly fast food service and fine dining food.  It has entered my list of go-to places when I don't know where to go.",0.9984,0.768,0.203,0.029,0.5431335034013606

I had the Lemongrass Chicken Sammitch, which was seasoned beautifully and bursting with amazing flavor.  The Chimichurri Tostones were out-of-this-world, and not overly greasy (which is always a plus in my health-conscious book!)  I also had a taste of my friend's brussels sprouts with chorizo, which were fantastic --the funky cabbage-ness that sometimes underlies my beloved (but for many people, dealbreaker) brussels was entirely absent! Just rich, spicy goodness. For dessert, I tried the Bacon Chocolate Chip soft serv.  At first, my hopes fell when I realized it was just plain vanilla with toppings, but it might have been the best soft serv I've ever had.  Light, fresh, not overly cloying like many artificial vanillas, and with a hint of something citrusy.  And the toppings themselves--which were like breaded cookie chunks with chocolate chips, graham crackers, and bacon bits...splendid!    Everyone at our table went home full and happy--it was one of those rare near-perfect dining experiences.

But really, they make it work. I was lured here by some coworkers (all professional cooks), and we stopped at a nearby liquor store to pick up several (read: WAY too many) six-packs of tasty beer.  The menu IS limited - there are only 5-6 appetizers and 5-6 entrees, one soup, and dessert is vanilla frozen yogurt with a choice of five toppings (created by Mindy Segal, the genius pastry chef behind Hot Chocolate). There were also two specials the night I was there. And lemme tell ya, whatever the place may lack in fancy decor and Cheesecake Factory-like menu tomes, it makes up for in fantastic food. I think between the ten of us we tried everything on the menu, and absolutely nothing was lacking. The squash/maple syrup/pho spices thing nearly blew my mind, and the lemongrass chicken sandwich made my knees weak. I also tried the huckleberry/lime topping on the frozen yogurt, and while it may have been simple it was excellent.

So the hot dog was special of the day - we came here on Thursday. This hot dog tastes like it has been grilled outside in the summer air, meaning it tastes as good as a hot dog can taste!  Plus this hog dog comes covered with this spicy yet sweet asian slaw and pan fried noodles, an interesting combination and its quite a feat to eat this hot dog without getting food all over your face or hands but it is worth every bite.  The bun is a huge piece of pita or naan and thebest part is...the hot dog comes with fries!  And wait there's more, with the fries, comes this satay mayo dip that is kinda funny tasting at first because the flavor is so unique but before I knew it I was practically drinking this sauce.   As for the sides..I wasn't too impressed.  The chorizo brussel sprouts were ok, I mean it tasted like just those two ingredients stir fried together, and the squash seemed a bit expensive for some sweet potato chunks and half an acorn squash.  I mean for $5 I would like two roasted acorn squashes with honey on top, thanks.  I did like the fried plaintains, Belly Shack's chimmicurri sauce is light and has a hint of lime, very refreshing and different from the chimmicurri sauce you would find at a brazillian steak house.   Belly Shack also has soft serve, yes this instantly gave this place an extra star because I LOVE soft serve.  My friends had the bacon chocolate chip soft serve..I don't like bacon (I know its like the only thing I don't eat) and I hate when my salt and sweet mix so I did not venture near that, but I did eat a lot of my friend's softserve with the blondie bites on top.   The hot dog was so yummy that I am definitely looking to come here again on a Thursday just to get that!",0.9989,0.745,0.227,0.028,0.5861846213895395

I don't think it really added anything to their overall taste, so not sure what the deal was... The soft serve was lacking... K and I must have misread the soft serve menu - we thought we were getting vietnamese cinnamon-caramel soft serve, but instead got forgettable vanilla soft serve with some cinnamon grated on top, and caramel swirled around the side.

I tried to order ice cream when we placed our order, but was told to place it separately, at the end of the meal.  That's a good way to lose money.  I did, and it was fine.  I love soft serve - but it didn't taste any different than soft serve I've had elsewhere with caramel sauce on top.",-0.3894,0.77,0.094,0.137,0.6233333333333332

It was definitely solid good food.  I had split the lemongrass chicken and the Korean BBQ sammich with a friend. The Korean BBQ wasn't anything special. I have Korean BBQ all the time, so I wasn't too impressed. However, the lemongrass chicken was what surprised me the most. After eating the first sammich, I wasn't expecting much from the other. However, the lemongrass chicken was quite delicious. What made it even better was the ripe papaya fish sauce it came with. I don't think I would've liked the dish that much if it wasn't for that sauce. All in all, it was good. Wasn't the best sandwiches I had ever eaten, but definitely real tasty, and I plan on going back when I'm in the mood to try the other stuff on the menu.",0.8229,0.836,0.11,0.053,0.5058531746031746
2010-01-10,4.0,"Tried this place for the first time today, though I've been meaning to for a couple months. It's a Korean / Puerto Rican fusion restaurant, which makes for a lot of interesting flavors. The style: Fast-casual, where you order at the counter and they serve you at your table. Certainly doesn't give the impression of fine-dining, although the presentation of SOME of the plates might lean in that direction. The space: It feels somewhat minimalist, with stools the only seating option. All the tables are for 2, with the exception of a large wood-plank table in the middle that could easily seat 10+. There was little decoration, except for some very urban stencil work in a couple spots. As noted in other reviews, it would be nice to have a coat rack or two throughout the restaurant, since there wasn't a place to hang our coats (we had to just put them on nearby stools). The menu: Is pretty small, with only a handful of options. Each entree (and both of the specials) looked really good. I would have liked a bit more description of the various entrees, particularly because they use some unique ingredients that I was not familiar with. The staff: were friendly and helpful, and answered my questions about the various menu options. They also explained the specials very well, and were prompt with service, clearing, and refilling water glasses. They even said ""thank you"" on our way out. The food: DELICIOUS! I had the Belly Dog; my wife had the Tilapia Sammich and Yellow Rice. We shared an ice cream with Bacon & Chocolate Chip for dessert. (Most of the dessert toppings are prepared by the pastry chef of Hot Chocolate. Yum!) My only complaint about the food is that there is SO MUCH competing flavor that it is hard to figure out what the ingredients are. It is definitely Yummy, but there's a LOT going on with each of the plates. The Verdict: I don't think this place knows what it wants to be--fast casual or fine dining. If they lowered the price a bit, and positioned themselves as more of a fast-casual place, it would be a MUST GO place. As it is, it's pretty darn good, and worth a stop.",0.9847,0.854,0.123,0.022,0.5483333333333336

2009-12-31,4.0,"New Year's resolutions are funny things. For example, one of my resolutions for 2010 is to hit up more brand new restaurants while they're still really huge on this site. But this can be a double-edged sword. I actually went to Belly Shack while it was still in the Hot on Yelp Top 5 back in November and the experience was mixed. I went back in December and it was tops.  I can't say they worked out the kinks, necessarily, because I got different dishes each time. But, whatever it was, I resolve Belly Shack is going to be a go-to place in 2010 (goodness, there I am making more resolutions).  I think what led to the mixed experience the first time was the physical restaurant itself's mixture of feels. They seem to be going for a New York City vibe. And the blue line train tracks running directly above (sometimes making it too noisy to talk) definitely gives it a feel like you're in the Belly of an Urban area (sorry, that's the owner's other place). There's trip hop (en Espanol) playing overhead to add to this oeuvre.  But, there's a problem. This place can't seem to decide what kind of restaurant it is - classy or kla$$y (thanks to Mary T. for putting that in my vocabulary in 2009). You order from a counter - and get your own silverware and water - but then you eat in an area that feels like a fine dining establishment with wait service.  And then you can eat soft serve ice cream off their desert menu like a seven year old when you're done.  I resolved a long time ago, however, not to rate places on aesthetics (including aesthetical confusions). And Belly Shack is, after all, about the food - Puerto Rican and Korean fusion to celebrate the marriage of the two owners. And, holy wow, one item on the menu is mind blowing. The tostones off the side orders are actually almost a meal in themselves. I have been ordering them all over the city since my experience with them at Belly Shack about a month ago and none are even close.  These little circles of joy are $5 (everything on their menu is a bit expensive for the size of the portions) but worth every penny. As are all the other veggie sides I've tried from our communal group last time I was there. All the veggie mains contain mushroom (that evil, evil fungus) so I've avoided these dishes - except for the Quinoa Ssam. This one started out tasting waxy to me, but eventually won me over - the rice and veggies were just spicy enough as I sat there staring at the evil mushroom polluting the plate.  Though I'm sure this large portobello mushroom was as spectacular and lovingly prepared as the rest of the menu.  Maybe one of my resolutions for 2010 should be to give foods I hate another chance. Naw. That's probably pushing it way too far.",0.975,0.828,0.116,0.056,0.5284790764790763

My boyfriend and I went to Belly Shack on a Friday around 6 or 7pm.  No wait, moderate noise, fairly crowded (something to be expected when you read about the chef's concept for this place), and very friendly and helpful staff!  The exposed kitchen added a fun factor for me, since I love to watch the chef and his staff rush to prepare all the dishes.  Service was fast, and we got our food within a very reasonable time from when it was ordered.   We selected the Korean BBQ Kogi and Asian Meatballs ""sammiches"" to split between us.  SO much food per ""sammich,"" and it was beautifully and freshly presented!  The meat in both creations was lusciously seasoned and intensely juicy, perfectly played off the accompanying sauces and dressings in a tender-chewy bread pocket.  Both are just very wonderful and well-thought-out dishes!  We ordered the ""Hot & Sour"" Soup, which was an interesting twist on the typical recipe, including the hominy and cilantro to offer new sweet and bright notes, respectively, to the vinegar and chili base.  As our sides, we chose the Tostones and the Brussels Sprouts & Chorizo.  The Tostones were a little disappointing, as we both agreed there was not nearly enough chimichurri sauce.  However, they were appropriately crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The Brussels Sprouts, though, were so good that I've desperately tried to replicate the recipe several times at home.  The nutty sprouts and the spicy-fatty chorizo are a perfect pair--hands down!--when deeply caramelized like that! We have a whole list of items we're looking to try, in order, when we return.  The crowd was nowhere near the level to bother us in the slightest.  And I have a feeling that even if it were shoulder-to-shoulder jam packed we'd be too distracted savoring the food to even notice.",0.9963,0.765,0.196,0.039,0.5700685425685426

I don't know too many chefs out there that can make you ponder how each bite was constructed yet be so compelled to keep going until there's nothing left. The menu only has a few options but I don't think that's a detractor. Having only ordered the meatball sandwich and the lemongrass chicken (there were two of us), I would be tempted to return to explore. The table next to us appeared to be well seasoned and ordered a handful of sides with the lone soup on the menu. Not a bad playcall. As for what I tasted, the lemongrass chicken was not your typical Asian offering. I wish I knew everything I was eating but some mysteries are best left unsolved. Needless to say I loved it and didn't share well. It came with two large pieces of bread that i probably was supposed to use to make a sandwich but didnt.  Also included was a small side of cabbage with a vinegar based dressing.  This was useful for cooling off the mouth as there was a nice helping of spice. My partner in crime went for the meatball sandwich that at first look reminded me of a falafill pita. It was served pita style stuffed with meatballs and cold noodles seasoned with magic. One bite of the noodle meatball bread concoction and I was hooked. If you haven't heard the decor is as unique as the food. An open, warehouse feel with stools, communal tables and a grey steel feeling. Check out the bathroom, I thought I walked into a SAW movie. It all works together though to enhance the overall concept. Lastly, since you order at the front counter and wait for your food at your seat, the initial bill surprised me.

I know that Bill Kim is an amazing chef, uses only top notch ingredients, etc. But I mean...kimchi for 4 bucks? On the northside, you can get literally a vat of the stuff for 6 bucks. I understand, totally different ingredients and whatnot, but come on dude....it's cabbage. And you're charging four bucks for essentially 4 or 5 bites. I call bullshit. The meatball sandwich would be great if it weren't in a pita stuffed with more noodles. Add to it that the meatballs have been pretty dry the past few times I've had it, you really feel like you're eating an extremely flavorful cardboard and sawdust sandwich. The meat in the kogi is amazing, the soup is usually great (although it's been off a coupe of times), and the bacon chocolate chip ice cream is incredible (nod to MIndy Segal for that one).  And the overall look of the place makes me shudder. Look, I understand getting inspired by the whole ""street art"" phenomenon. But that trend hit retail stores about a decade ago.

So when my friend and I went to check it out for a quick bite, we left thinking it was not mind-blowing, but not bad either.  When you when in, you feel like you've entered a more modern and darker version of Chipotle. You go straight to the counter and place your order.

We were confused as to whether we should leave a tip or not since we weren't sure if there'd be any table service for not. We left a few bucks anyway. We grabbed two cups of water and a server came by to open up our bottle of wine (BYOB) and gave us two small cups. Our sammich and sides smelled great but the portions were pretty small for what we paid. I'm Korean, so I've grown up eating bulgogi sandwiches on white bread so the concept was not new to me. The meat was well seasoned, but the best part of the sandwiches my grandmother used to make for me was all the juices that soaked through the bread which made the sandwich messy to eat, but oh so good! There wasn't much bulgogi juice, and not enough meat to eat with the 4 thick slices of pita. The butternut squash side was delicious, but nothing you couldn't make at home.

Belly Shack is the definite more alternative, stripped down, it-is-what-it-is restaurant. Slate gray everywhere, almost a skateboard montage, order at the counter fusion cuisine, awesome. Me and a friend ordered the tostones, brussel sprouts, BBQ kogi, and the boricua sammy then TOPPED things off with Mindy's softserve. Everything was delicious. I love hearty meat dishes but I hate to say it, but I think the boricua outshined the kogi. Brussel sprouts with bacon...can't lose. Mindy's amazing softserve...always a winner. I loved it overall. However....if there is one bad thing I could say....we did rack up quite the bill for an order at the counter, take out style-esque place for sandwiches. It ended up being almost $15-20 a person, ouch. I will be back though alas. 'Oh yeah, and Bill Kim was there serving us. Double bonus.",0.9631,0.753,0.175,0.072,0.5419191919191919

At first the flavors were omg, but it left a bitter aftertaste and I got bored after a few bites. The tostones, however, were amazing and totally worth $5.

2009-11-28,4.0,"I miss Vella a LOT. Memories aside, I was not displeased when I made my first visit to Belly Shack.  Between my group of one vegetarian (me) and two carnivores, we tried the lemongrass chicken sandwich, the Korean BBQ sandwich, and the Boriqua, which was amazing though dripping with oil.  My companions both raved about their sandwiches as well. We tried the roasted squash, tostones, and the brussel sprouts with chorizo for sides.  The roasted squash was PERFECT - the seasoning was subtle and let the sweetness of the squash through, and it was served inside a miniature pumpkin - adorable.  The tostones were good though I would not recommend ordering them with the Borqicua, which uses sliced plantains in place of bread.  Fried plantain overload between the sandwich and the tostones. For dessert, each of us tried a different soft serve - our table had the bacon chocolate, the mint brownie, and the Vietnamese caramel, which was easily the best of the three.  I thought the food was great, the decor so-so (after the brightness of Vella, the dining room felt very dark to me) and the staff was lovely.  Will definitely be back!",0.989,0.777,0.195,0.029,0.6257777777777777
2009-11-28,3.0,"What do you want first, the good or the bad? OK, the bad, then: - a bit pricey for what you actually get - generally speaking, the food is a touch on the salty side (and the service is sometimes, too) - music and decor makes me feel like I'm the sort of nightclub I would never patronize (i.e. trendy urban wannabe) - too ""concept-y"" (or at least, that's the best way I can think to describe it) Let me elaborate on this last one. The (small) menu seems to (gently) force the multi-cultural aspect of the food down your throat. Don't get me wrong, I love diversity (in food and people), but for some reason, it feels kind of like a TV ad that shows one person from every major ethnic group (each attractive, but not overly so) all sitting around a table, laughing and enjoying each other's company. That is to say, the menu seems more to me like it's based on the ""concept"" of being inclusive, rather than a natural mix of different cuisines. The soft serve dessert ""concept"" also bothers me. I tried the chocolate bacon, which was pretty tasty, but it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. Also, the fact that the only desserts they offer are frozen soft serve (albeit with toppings) seems ridiculous to me in a city with as many winter months as Chicago. I don't claim to abstain from frozen desserts in the winter, but I would at least like a warm (or un-cold) option. OK, enough of the bad, now the good: - the food IS tasty (despite the high sodium content) I haven't tried everything on the menu, but one particular standout was the Boricua sandwich (plantains with tofu, black beans, brown rice, and some sort of Moo Shu-tasting red sauce) - the food is also creative; I don't think I've been to another restaurant offering brussel sprouts and chorizo, which is a really good combination. - BYOB is always a plus Let me close with one last disclaimer: I may still be holding a small resentment that Vella is no longer in this space, as breakfast/brunch is the superlative meal of the day.",0.9918,0.783,0.164,0.053,0.5390898345153664

I had the Korean BBQ sammie...this was a 5 star sammie peeps!  Such wonderfully flavorful meat, delish kimchee, served w/the soft pita triangles makes it easy to eat and fun!  I will order this probably every time I return to Belly Shack. Also had the Asian Meatball sammie...this one is adventurous, so if you're not into trying new things, don't get this, and in fact - don't go to Belly Shack!  This place is for food lovers who enjoy different spices, textures and surprises in their dishes.  Looked like a calzone stuffed with cold noodles, bean sprouts (YUMS) and 4 big, great tasting meatballs.  VERY hard to eat/manage...could be served in something easy like perhaps the pita triangles aforementioned.  But tasty and different so I enjoyed it immensely.  This is a 4 star sammie for me and I would suggest it to others and eat it again, but never pick it over the BBQ sammie. Tostones...such a different and unexpected flavor, hard to describe.  The more I ate, the more I liked it and the lemony/herb flavor really works w/the sweetness of the plaintains.  Would def order this probably every time I go back. Great complement to the sammies. Blondie brownie soft serve ice cream:  O M G...I can't believe the goodness that passed my lips!  Where do they get the milk/cream for this yogurt - is it drizzled down from clouds in heaven?!?!?  It is THAT good people...save room and order ice cream, you won't regret it!

I coiuld have eaten 3 bowls of it.  It was so dynamic, hitting the palate on many different levels, both texturally and by taste.  I highly suggest it.  I also tried the quinoa lettuce wraps, which would be great on a summer day when you're looking for something really light. I'm always up for some quinoa though, I just love the way the superfood leaves you feeling, AND it came with some yummy dipping sauces, so i'd ordered it again.  Boyfriend got the korean bbq sandwich, and the meat was excellent and super tender.  Strongly suggest this place for a casual, cheap and GOOD dinner!!!",0.9939,0.689,0.261,0.05,0.5829333333333332

It came with small pita pockets to make little sandwiches and stuff it with the kimchi and beef. Great flavors. The ""ssam paste"" is a delicious combo of soybean paste with hot pepper paste. YUM. We split an order of tostones- fried plantains, ok, twist my arm. I think she had one and I had the other ten. I loved the sweet salty combo. It went perfectly with the chilled Verdicchio we were drinking (BYOB). We are also both fans of day drinking. (Don't judge!) The other side we split was an order of brussel sprouts with chorizo. What an interesting combo! I like both sprouts and chorizo, so why not?! It was just a tad bit greasy, but delicious nonetheless. And of course I also had to try their hot and sour soup. I would come back just for this on a cold winter day. Heavenly. I believe I was licking my bowl at the end. I would have done that with or without the vino- it was just that good! Lastly, we decided to try a dessert. They are all toppings for soft serve ice cream, FYI. The Vietnamese Cinnamon Caramel rocked my world.

I would definately not go back and many have asked how did I like it, and I let them know since I am one of the critics in another site.

The lemongrass chicken sandwich was not at all what I expected, but had a delicious dark tangy sauce served with a tasty kimchee-like (but not kimchee) salad on the side. I was a little thrown off initially about the make-your-own sandwich thing, but I really enjoyed the meal from start to finish.  The boy had the BBQ beef kogi sandwich with kimchee and thought it was really good. The kimchee, at least, was good (I don't eat beef). It looked good :) On top of loving my meal, Belly Shack is BYOB (no corkage fee) and has a great atmosphere; modern and minimalist. You do have to order at the counter (i.e. fast food style), but they bring the food to your table and refill your drinks/uncork your wine at the table. Basically the counter ordering means you don't have to leave the usual 18% tip, more like 10-15%. (More money in my pocket!) The service was still good despite the whole counter business. And this place is super convenient if you live near a blue line stop - it's literally next to (or kinda underneath) the Western Blue line stop.

2009-11-22,4.0,"Korean/Latin food that is vegan and gluten friendly!   I'm no longer a full-fledged vegetarian but I totally appreciate the boricua sandwich-- the vegan version of a Puerto Rican jibarito-- perfectly tender tofu, black beans, and rice between plantains marinated in a tangy cilantro vinegar oil.  If that doesn't satisfy your taste for plantains, the tostones are fried and salted with the same cilantro sauce on the side- a harmonious yin and yang of richness and lightness.  You can bring your own booze or try the delicious sparkling apple soda. This is a quaint spot for people to eat solo, grab take-out or bring a large group of friends.  The staff seemed very attentive, ready to guide incoming customers to the daunting communal table, if necessary. (Communal seating is okay, people; we all just want to eat!)  There are plenty of private tables too for those intending on intimate conversation to discuss illicit financial transactions or what have you.   Also cute-- the little slogans on the walls.  ""Humboldt Park not Heights.""  Not sure if I've heard HP referred to as Humboldt Heights, but I'm guessing the restaurant is saying they want to preserve the neighborhood, hence the Puerto Rican component of the menu. Their presence probably does contribute to the gentrification of the neighborhoods to the south and west of Belly Shack, but I think it's delightful they have put their own spin on local ethnic cuisine.",0.9916,0.797,0.176,0.027,0.6591269841269841

I had the BBQ kogi.  I was not disappointed.  The smell coming out of the carry out bag was very appetizing.  I thought it was very good, especially the meat.  I would definitely eat it again.  I wouldn't call it a sandwich, its really BBQ kogi w/ pita.  When a restaurant says ""no substitutions please"" I would expect them to do the assembly.  At $10 its a little more expensive than I than it should be when you make it a sandwich.  Make it an entree and the price is right. The positives far outweigh the negatives and I would recommend this dish.  I look forward to trying another dish.

2009-11-22,3.0,"I agree with many of the other reviewers about this place.  I'd heard about Belly Shack through the typical foodie media (blogs, TastingTable, Time Out Chicago, etc) and decided to go with a friend for a casual Sunday night dinner. The decor is minimal but urban and cozy.  The lighting is very minimal, so if you were driving by you might not even realize it was open, especially because it is more or less hidden under the El tracks.  The small number of people inside on this Sunday night also probably didn't help.  But that was to our advantage. I had the Korean BBQ Kogi sammich.  It was the typical bulgogi beef with a small amount of kimchee on the side, and four pita squares for you to fill yourself.  Tasty and satisfying, yes.  But nothing you can't do at home yourself with decent Korean bulgogi and pita.  My friend had the blackened tilapia sammich.  I'm not huge fan of tilapia, but I had a bit of his and it was pretty good. We had the hot and sour soup and roasted squash as sides.  The soup tasted more like a standard tortilla chicken soup.  I couldn't taste much of  ""hot and sourness"" that I expected (thought it would be more of the chinese hot and sour soup taste).  But I really liked the roasted squash with maple syrup and pho spices.  I couldn't make out the pho spices in the first few bites I had, but after going back to the dish from having some soup, the spices really came out.  I enjoyed the contrast of the spices with the sweetness of the syrup and squash itself. Gave it 3 stars for some of the same reasons others did.  Prices are a bit high considering its counter service (especially the sandwiches-$10 each) but some of the combinations of Asian and Latin flavors were quite surprising.  Not a place I would go out of the way for dinner on busy nights, but if I were in the area and had a taste for a light but flavorful meal, I'd stop by again. Next time will try the tostones; I hadn't researched enough of what to eat before I went this first time.",0.9826,0.826,0.124,0.05,0.48895833333333333

Flavor wise, the Kogi tasted like bulgogi that you can get anywhere.  Pretty uninspired if you ask me.  The lemongrass was nothing special according to my friend.  My meatball was good.  I like the gingery meatballs and the noodles inside the pita actually tasted great.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The tostones were very good, as was the butternut squash.   The brussels sprouts in chorizo that other yelpers seem to love, disappointed.  It disappointed in that if you are looking for a combination of the two flavors, you ain't gonna taste it.  All I could taste was chorizo.  Luckily I love chorizo so it didn't bother me much but go order it expecting to taste brussel sprouts (which for some might be a good thing) I probably won't be going back even though the food was just OK.  And service?  What service?

First of all, I'm not a fan of tarty ice creams so I was afraid I wasn't going to like the Huckleberry lime soft serve, BUT it was my favorite dessert.

2009-11-08,4.0,"I just went here today and I like and love this place!!! I would give it a full 5 stars except that I'm not a fan of the location.  After spending a day in Wicker Park, I was hoping it would be in a more congested - and walkable area - which I guess helps with crowd control - but it doesn't make for a ""drop by"" spot.  The fact that it's in a spot with little foot traffic makes it difficult for me to convince whatever friends are with me at the moment to get into a car and drive there without promising them gold and/or orgasms. The interior is nice - it's urban chic - with a minimalist theme.  It's a pretty wide open space which I appreciate as I dislike feeling suffocated in small spaces (hi. xoco. the other hype-of-the-moment).  You order at the counter and pay at the counter.  They give you a number that you take to an open table - and according to the servers, they do no remove your number until your entire order is received - it's their way of double-checking themselves for complete orders.  I like that - especially in a order-sit-and-receive-orders type of place - because a lot of the times, the food comes at different times and you aren't 100% sure if the rest of your order is coming or if part of your order was forgotten/misplaced.  This process minimizes the stress of stressing out over whether or not to bother and ask if this-that is coming. Ordered the Sweet and Sour sopa. And it was awesome.  I want a batch of this in my home at all times during the winter season.  It looks small but it's hardy.  It has pork belly bites, spouts, tortilla chips, and these giant-steroid-like corn niblets - which has a consistency and taste similar to garbanzo beans.  It is amazing.  I think of all the things I ordered and tasted off of other people - this was, by far, my favorite. Also ordered Brussel Sprouts & Chorizo side - and that was my 2nd favorite thing I ate there.  The brussel sprouts are perfectly cooked - not too mushy - a little bit of bite.  The chorizo is crumbled so that you can have a little bit of it with each brussel sprout.  There was a hint of mint in the flavor.  Anyway, it was so yummy. Also ordered the Butternut Squash side - it comes in little cubes and kind of made me feel like I was eating baby food - but it was also good. The korean-bbq-gogi sammich - it was good but I'm korean and so it was nothing new to me.  The taste was very familiar - and that alone, is a good thing.  A lot of times ""korean bbq gogi"" doesn't end up tasting anything like korean bulgogi - but it did - as well as the kimchi/pickles served with it. Overall, a good experience.  I didn't get to try the soft serve that I had my eye on - because I was way full.  But there is a bacon chocolate chip soft-serve that I will definitely be trying the next time I go in there because... well... bacon + chocolate = two things I super loves. One last thing, since we were all first-timers here, we weren't aware that people consider it a BYOB - and noticed that a lot of tables had beer/wine/etc - definitely bring some with you!  I'm pretty sure the beer would've helped the experience as well - I think it would have helped bring out the flavor as well as neutralize the mixture of flavors a bit.. as every dish (except for the kogi sammich) had a bit of fusion to it which means a mixture of spices. Side note:   A lot of people at our table decided that there's a hint of latin and vietnamese flavors in a lot of the dishes - maybe it's the use of cilantro and lemongrass?   It was a good experience and everyone agreed that they would want to return to try some of the other sammiches and definitely the soft-serve.",0.9989,0.762,0.197,0.04,0.5693755739210287

2009-11-04,3.0,"The idea of mixing Asian and Latin flavors in a casual setting has apparently been popular in other places such as L.A.  I was certainly very excited about Belly Shack's opening, since I am a fan of Urban Belly, the other restaurant run by Bill Kim.  The set up here is somewhat similar to Urban Belly's: order up front and they will bring the food to your table.  The downside of running a restaurant operation this way is that things can get a bit chaotic when it gets busy (do I still go ahead and order even if all the tables are taken?).  Anyways, back to the food. We ordered the Korean BBQ Kogi and Lemongrass Chicken.  The Kogi was served on a pita-like bread.  Though the beef was fairly salty, eating it together with the bread made it more palatable.  The Lemongrass Chicken was the better of the two, with succulent meat and a much more balanced flavor profile.  The one problem I had was that the accompanying bread tasted burnt, even though I could only see light grill marks on it.  Was it supposed to taste this way?  That threw me off a little bit. Besides the 2 sandwiches, we also got the Brussel Sprouts with Chorizo side dish.  The addition of tortilla chips added a nice and surprising crunch to it. My biggest gripe with Belly Shack is the price.  Though it serves casual street food, the prices were a bit high, especially for their sandwiches.  After all, they were not particularly amazing to justify paying extra.  To satisfy my Asian sandwich cravings, I will stick to Ba Le Bakery's $3.99 banh mi sandwiches, thank you.",0.9447,0.856,0.105,0.039,0.5482777777777778

It was so tasty looking that my lunch companions were jealous they hadn't ordered a bowl.  I followed the soup with the Quinoa Ssam, Billy Kim's version of lettuce wraps. LOVED them- would definitely order this again and seemed a healthier alternative than some of the sandwiches on the menu. We also ordered some sides for the table. The kimchi, which is a total rip off at $4 (it's cabbage!). Should be more like $1. We also ordered the tostones (fried plantains), but those were actually worth the $4 price tag.

The food is pretty darn yummy but the price points are a little off-kilter.  I ordered the tilapia with curry tartar sandwich.  It's not so much as sandwich as it is two pieces of fish atop or akimbo (ha! I totally pwned that word) some bread.  It's $11.  And, it's missing something.  Fortunately, we'd ordered the FOUR DOLLAR kimchi which added the spicy crunch my palette craved.  I felt badly deviating from Chef Kim's vision.  I also ate well now that my sandwich was Johnny-fied.  But, $4 for kimchi?  For shame. We also ordered a communal helping of tostones.  These came with very garlicky chimichurri and they were every bit as delicious as I could have hoped.  Those were more reasonably priced.  I'm pleased to have finally had the chance to have Chef Kim's cooking.  I found it enjoyable.  But, with a neighborhood tour to Humboldt Park in my near future and a friend's Korean mother who (is convinced I am way too skinny and) cooks for me each time I see her...I don't know if I am rushing back.  This isn't a decision my stomach made.  This decision comes courtesy of my George Costanza wallet.",0.9886,0.794,0.166,0.04,0.4941919191919192

Drizzling rain and rumbling trains matched the decor quite nicely, but there is an unfinished quality to the interior design of this place which is unnerving. It looks like they either wanted to go with an urban biking aesthetic or a deconstructed aesthetic and made a compromise between the two to the detriment of each. I thought the egg crate foam on the ceiling was a really neat touch, but it made me miss the clean and cheery lines of the erstwhile Vella Cafe.  I got take-out for myself and a co-worker and the food was all very tasty. I got the lemon grass chicken and ordered him the meatballs. The bread was really good and though I thought it was strange for them to add the lemon grass to chicken like a slaw, it was still pretty good when I put it all together in my mouth. I was confused by the menu with the desert options. I thought I was getting a brownie topped with ice cream [frogurt?] and not the other way around. I will not be repeating this mistake. The frozen dairy treat is just like the vanilla ice cream at McDonalds across the street and the brownie bits, while super tasty, aren't plentiful enough to justify the expense.

Maybe vinegar infused celery slices? That is what it tasted like, but I am sure that is not what it was. Anyway, it was excellent.  Fried Plantains: Um...were these fried potato slices? Because that is what it they tasted like! Not that I am complaining, but just not what I expected. They were tasty for sure, but the one complaint I have is the lack of sauce. There was a sparse amount of cilantro/garlic vinaigarette/oil sauce, which I would like to eat out of the jar. Um...more please!

One last part of the review - the server brought 3 sauces to our table in the beginning of the meal. They came in one dish with some dividers to separate them. But the dish was so shallow, which only yielded about half a spoonful of each sauce. Also, I was confused as to how to scoop up the sauce and deliver it to my plate because it was so shallow. I tried using my spoon, which worked OK. That method only gathered a really small amount, and then I obviously used my spoon the eat the soup, but there was sauce remnants on it. Not a huge problem, but the sauces were so delicious, and there was no easy/obvious way to use them, and the amount they provide it minuscule.  Total amount = $27.00.

After reading about this new spot in Time Out and realizing that I was actually only a few blocks away at the time, I swung by and was pleased to find a seat and no line. The place was hopping busy to be sure, with a young, hip and really diverse crowd. I haven't yet made the trek to Urban Belly, but it's on the top of my list, and I was happy to see this place in a much more accessible location (right under the Western Blue Line stop). The spot is a good fit with the overall vibe of the place - unpretentious, approachable, and a little risky. We're talking underground hip hop, Banksy style graffiti and tables that look like old school Benetton ads. Like most of the other reviewers, I had the Korean BBQ sammy, which was really bulgogi, kimchi and the pita bread to pick it up with. Quality stuff to be sure, and interesting presentation style - nothing fancy, but predictably quite good. I also ordered a side of the brussel sprouts with chorizo, which was also tasty (in a make-you-feel-dirty kinda way) and another relatively simple but excellent idea.    Overall, I was intrigued by the place and it's close and affordable enough to try some other items - soft-serve with bacon-chocolate chips from the Hot Chocolate folks is a must try, and after a trip to Puerto Rico last year, I'm a sucker for some good tostones. Perhaps they'll eventually make some asian-themed mofongo...mmmm....mofongo.  BYO is also a bonus, and I saw what looked like a table full of college students taking advantage of it. My guess is this place is one or two gushing profiles away from being hard as hell to get a seat at.",0.9887,0.779,0.162,0.059,0.4516706750040085
2009-10-20,4.0,"Went here with a bunch of co workers and we sampled almost all the sides / sandwiches and really enjoyed them all.  I had the BBQ Kogi sandwich and really enjoyed the flavors. It was savory and sweet. The sample of soup I tried was my favorite side dish and I would definitely get a full bowl next visit. It tastes like a tortilla soup with an asian influence, very memorable. This place is truly a great blend of different cultural flavors. The sandwiches might be a bit expensive at the $9-$10 range making a lunch rather expensive when you add a side but its a nice treat and would make a good dinner too. The fact that this place is BYOB also enhances the dinner option. The location is right below the blue line so its really convenient if you are able to easily get to the blue line. The sound from the trains overhead is audible but the soundproofing is very well done and does not distract.",0.9853,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.5268353174603174
2009-10-20,4.0,"There is a mix of people who like and dislike Bill Kim's flagship store, Urban Belly, (I being on the side of like), but I dislike that I live now much further away from said restaurant. So imagine my happiness when I hear of a new place opening up closer. Um yay! And this one is a twisted version...  Mix cuisines can be a difficult and quite often nasty combination. However this new mix of Puerto Rician and Asian flair... well stop me dead in my tracks, slap me upside the head and call me later. (If you get a voice mail, just leave me a message, I will get back to you as soon as I can.) Excited? Yes. Intrigued? Fo' sho'. Starving to the point of weak standing and light headedness? Kinda. Could have been the leg workout I did earlier. The place was popping, the layout simple, the idea, counter service and then sit yourself down and wait for your food to be brought out to you.... or like me, a carry out.  The menu is small, but packed with Latin twists with some good Asian panache. Sammiches, (yes... they are called smirches, about five of them), one soup, two salads, about five sides and several desserts and drinks. I was starving, so I needed to throw down the hammer and order a good amount. Well, I had no hammer so I went with just walking in and ordering. I went with the BBQ Kogi beef and the Asian meatball sammich, brussel sprouts and tostones. I couldn't wait to get home. The smell was filling my car, my nose, my head which was making me all starving even more, so when I got home, I quickly laid down everything and laid the food out. Grabbing several napkins I went to town.  The BBQKB was the best out of the bunch. The beef was tender for the most part through out, flavor was definitely there,  though it was four slices of flat bread with a mesh of beef on the side with kimchi. Oh darn, like I minded....  the Asian meatball was pretty good, but I kept feeling like it needed something, perhaps a sauce or something, it seemed slightly dry in a way. Perhaps its my memory of a meatball sandwich having some marinara sauce. The brussel sprouts... yes, I said brussel sprouts. Those nasty little things I had as a kid, those little nasty cabbages I hated, well... if my mom had made them like this, perhaps I would have liked them better. What made them that way? Chorizo. Lots of it. Fab. Total fab. And then the tostones, fried twice green plantains They were good, crispy and well fried but a little salty and I wish it came with more chimichuri sauce, but really I was happy.  My belly is happy, my body is happy so that makes me happy. The space is simple but nice, the food is great, the service was great, the prices were fine, many of the mains were around the $9 to $11 range. I can't wait to try their hot and sour soup, (hominy and Asian spices), and the quinoa salad.  And the desserts. And the Korean BBQ beef sandwich.  And the desserts... crap... I have to go work out and work all this off before my next trip... the sacrifices I make...",0.9977,0.71,0.204,0.086,0.49984914075823167
