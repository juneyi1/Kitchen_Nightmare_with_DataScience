2008-07-13,5.0,"This was recommended to a friend of mine by a Peruvian, so we figured it had some credibility.  A group of us went on a weekend night.  We all have eaten more than our fair share of Latin food.  And we all LOVED this stuff.  They gave us some aji with bread to begin with, which we could NOT get enough of.  Seriously, all of us were in love with it.   I've eaten a ridiculous amount of typical caribbean arroz con pollo, so when my friend ordered it, I scoffed.  Out of all the delicious sounding items on the menu, that was what he picked?  Well, I stand corrected.  Peruvian arroz con pollo is different and I like it better!  I've since forgotten what I ordered, I remember it having beef, potatoes, and rice.  It was delicious comfort food.  We had a great time and loved the food.  I highly recommend it.

I also ordered the Lomo Saltado, which is the Peruvian version of stir-fry with beef, onions, tomatoes, peppers, and french fries served with white rice.  A very simple, tasty dish that I'd order again.  The prices here are a bit high, though, so I might try another Peruvian restaurant that's a little more casual.",0.7854,0.918,0.082,0.0,0.46861904761904766

Tallarin Verde con Apanado - sauted spaghetti in a pesto sauce with basil and spinach, served with a breaded tender steak and grilled potato.  For me, the pesto sauce is really addictive and each cut of the breaded steak is accompanied by some of the pasta rolled up on my fork!  The Lomo Saltado is also quite good.  Think pot roast but not gravy-saturated like typical American pot roast is. Try not to fill up on the complimentary bread and the spicy green salsa/paste before your entree arrives as portions are large (the salsa is more of a paste and not chunky).  Said green paste has a good but not ""I'm-a kill you"" kick.

2008-05-19,3.0,Ok so I debated for awhile on whether or not to write a review on this place and after going back this weekend I finally have decided to give them 3 stars. They get 5 for da food bc it's absolutely delicious but there service gets 1 star. Omg I've been coming here for about 20 years now and don't think I've seen any of the waiters EVER smile.  It's da same ppl that have been working here for years.  That might be why they don't smile and forget orders and are just horrible! As for da food the lomo saltado is the best in my opinion the ceviche de pescado is always tasty and so is the arroz con poyo.  As for appetizers always enjoy a tamal or papa rellena along with an inka cola as a drink.  Many compare it to kola champagne but I don't think it compares.  There prices are decent I guess they seem to be going up all da time but well worth the taste. The portions are decent also. As far as coming back in here to dine I think they've probably seen the last of me.  I will be taking orders to go if I go back or just go to Ay Picante where they are always happy to see you and help.,0.9868,0.815,0.165,0.02,0.45394736842105265
2008-04-29,1.0,"My friend and I were very disappointed with our dinner here. The service was below par.  They never asked how our food was, didn't refill water glasses, etc.   The food was boring and, in the case of my friend's meal, poorly prepared.  I got a dish which was like a basic beef stew.  Completely unexceptional.   My friend ordered a duck dish.  Ten minutes after ordering, the waiter finally came back to say that they have no duck.  He asked if my friend would like to substitute chicken.  My friend didn't really want to do that, but it had been a while and he didn't want to have to go through the menu again, so he agreed.  When the food came, his chicken was hot on the outside and cold on the inside.  Microwaved food?  For nearly $15 an entree?  No thanks. Then the kicker: my friend put the tab on his credit card.  They came back with the receipt and apologized, saying that they accidentally undercharged his card four dollars.  And they asked for four dollars in cash.  I gave it to them, but then we thought about it a bit more and did the math.  The original amount seemed like it was right.  I asked to see the ticket.  They got it, and it showed that the amount that they charged my friend was the right amount.   So what was that about?  Were they trying to bilk us out of four bucks?  Did they just make a mistake?  My friend thought it was just a mistake, but I don't know.  If I made a mistake like that, I'd double and triple check before going back to the customer and asking for more money.  And I'd bring the ticket as well as the receipt to show that the amounts didn't match.  They didn't do that - they just brought the credit card receipt.

2008-04-22,4.0,"I really enjoyed the lomo saltado. It's a stir fry that typically consists of fried potatoes. I'm a sucker for french fries or fried potatoes. And it's stir fried? SCORE! Anyways I was kinda irked by people's ignorant comments on here.  Yeah they serve stir fry type dishes and baguettes... did you know most countries were conquered by other nations, therefore the european influence in their cuisine. Example: Flan was bought over to Mexico by the French, ya dummies. France installed a french emperor there but he ended up being executed. Fun fact I know. Also Vietnamese has baguettes in their cuisine too because they were colonized by France. There's LOTS of asian immigrants in Peru (one of their recent presidents was of Japanese descent) and also in other south american countries so yeah they cook with soy sauce sometimes and expect to see stir fries in Peru.  I hate when middle america decides to be adventerous tonight and try a foreign country's cuisine but complain about EVERYTHING and think they know what's authentic. The food was great, not stellar- I'm still pretty new with Peruvian food, but it tasted good in my mouth. Also I didn't expect much out of appearance of the place nor stellar service where they make small talk with me, fine by me- I prefer that actually.

2008-04-22,5.0,"Rinconcito has been around since 1980. I grew up on their Lomo Saltado and many, many cans of Inca Kola, so I might be a little biased here. Most of the reviews of local Peruvian restaurants seem to complain about the service. It must be a cultural thing. When you go to a Peruvian restaurant, you're not going to be in and out in 30 minutes unless you get carry out. The staff here are not overly attentive, nor are they as talkative and amusing as the guy at Taste of Peru. But the food here is fantastic - better than many places I've eaten at in Peru.  For starters, try the Anticuchos, Papa a la Huancaina, or Papa Rellena. As far as entrees, check out the Lomo Saltado, Aji de Gallina, or Tallarines Verde. I'm not a seafood fan, but friends have raved about the Ceviche and Arroz con Mariscos. Wash it down with an Inca Kola for the full experience. Expect to get a massive serving of whatever entree you order. I don't think there is such thing as ""seconds"" in Peru. (Someone on here dissed the bread served before the meal. Yes, they have baguettes in Peru. Shocking, I know.) Over the years, Rinconcito seems to have become a bit more Americanized, redecorating to cater to a more upscale crowd. Lately it kind of looks like what I imagine a restaurant owned by Scarface would look like. But the food is still the tastiest around.",0.9196,0.886,0.081,0.033,0.6069444444444445
2008-02-03,2.0,"Mediocre at best.  I went with a group of friends last night.  The servers were not overly helpful or friendly.  We had to really work to track someone down to cork our wine.  We ordered the plantains (yum) and tamale for appetizers.  The appetizers were better than our entrees.  I had the Sudo Mariscos - seafood cooked in a very light tomato sauce.  Very flavorless.  My husband had the Peruvian style paella.  Again, lacking flavor and strangely enough our dishes looked exactly the same..........just different names.  It took the waitstaff a long time to clear our plates.  Once they did they asked if we wanted anything else.  We asked about a desert menu and were told that they had flan, rice pudding or cookies.  Yeah, we took a pass.  Also noteworthy.........we were all talking and finishing our wine after our meal and one of the servers turned the lights up.........appeared to be a hint to wrap things up.  It was only 10:00 on a Saturday evening.  Guess there is a reason why the restaurant was half empty all evening.  I won't be back!",0.9211,0.867,0.099,0.034,0.43697530864197526

Now for the bad...  The restaurant itself needs some work, especially for what they want to charge for an entree, which I realize on the fringes of bucktown has to be moderately high.  When I lived nearby I would pass everyday and was a little turned off by the white plastic mini blinds in the front windows...  fine, ill overlook it and finally try.  Well the rest wasn't much better.  The white ceramic tile (it was being patched at the time of my visit) just doesn't do it for me... nor does the plastic over the flower upholstered chairs, and mirrored walls, yikes!

2007-08-13,2.0,"I've realized that I only tend to Yelp about a place when I've had a reasonably good experience, so here is one where I was distinctly disappointed.  At first I thought this was because I just don't have much experience eating Peruvian cuisine, but after reading the other reviews, I'm not so certain.  My chicken dish was reasonably good, but everything else missed the mark.  The ceviche in particular was disappointing, not seasoned or garnished adequately to make up for that ""hmm, I'm eating raw fish"" feeling.  The Peruvian tamale we had for an appetizer was also strange and lumpy. The service was below par.  There was something a little unwelcoming about our waiter's attitude, which contrasted to the mom-and-pop vibe that you might expect from Rinconcinto.   It took a relatively long time to get our food and even longer to get our check.  My friend had left his ceviche about half-eaten, and they took a long time to bus his table; it was almost as though mom was back in the room, refusing to serve desert until we cleared our plates. I'm also not sure what the deal is with the liquor license. There was no wine list, so I asked if they had beer and was told ""Peruvian beer only"".  I ordered one and it was served to me, but the waiter didn't ask if I wanted seconds even though I was just about done by the time our main courses finally came.  It was like they were doing me a big favor by serving me a $4 beer.   Just a strange experience overall.  Head to Cafe Laguardia down the block instead, which is not without its flaws but makes up for them with stiff drinks and some measure of charm.",-0.6515,0.83,0.076,0.093,0.4541061428992464
2007-08-02,4.0,"Like Erin C., I didn't realize that they no longer sell booze here.  Yikes! Alcoholism aside, however, Rinconcito was a pretty good experience.  Our server seemed nice and attentive, but I was the only non-native Spanish speaker in my party and therefore had no idea what he was saying most of the time.  For all I know, he could have been saying ""this white guy here sure looks like a douche,"" but I'm an optimist so I'll assume he was nice. The food was actually quite nice.  I had the rabbit which, although it was very tasty, was almost more bone than meat.  I'm a big fan of eating things that look like they did when they were alive, so that made up for it.  On the side, there was the classic burger set-up (piece of lettuce and a tomato), which threw me off.  The lomo saltado a friend had was good too, as was... some other steak dish (forgot the name) that another friend had. All in all, it was a good experience.  Not absolutely amazing, but enjoyable.  Bonus star for the deliciously spicy green sauce that came with the bread.",0.9971,0.669,0.312,0.019,0.5762731481481481

2007-05-25,3.0,"Actually.... I disagree with Monique B. *Technically*,  Pisco Sour is firstly British, given then it was concocted by some British guy and then Peruvian, given that this took place in a Peruvian city that much later became part of Chile. Oh, and its tasty Peruvian reputation is what made it world-renowned. But lets not worry about the details (I'm not here to start any wars between these two beautiful countries) and enjoy this tasty drink, shall we? Rinconcito is good. Not fabulous, but good. I usually judge Peruvian restaurants based on two things: Their ""aji"" (spicy chili sauce) and their lomo saltado (meat, potatoes, rice) or their tallarin saltado de carne (same thing but with noodles and no potatoes). Both these things are actually pretty good here, except maybe the last time I went the aji was REALLY spicy - and let me tell you, my spicy-food tolerance level is much higher than any mere mortal's, and when I say something is REALLY spicy, I mean it will burn a hole through your tongue and down the esophagus. I've tried other dishes here too, but I wasn't *that* impressed by them, but I blame my family for that - much like anything else, once you've had the real thing, you become picky. Pisco sour is good though, so definitely try it if you haven't already, whether it is Peruvian or Chilean or whatever =) I would recommend this place since it is clean and the people who work there are helpful, and I like the pisco sour and tallarin saltado, but anyone who wants hard-core Peruvian food may want to go somewhere else.",0.9907,0.777,0.179,0.044,0.4058501683501683
