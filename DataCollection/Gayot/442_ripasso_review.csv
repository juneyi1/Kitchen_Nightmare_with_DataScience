2013-06-06,5.0,Loved this little place!  We came in becuase we had a groupon for wine flight and a few small plates.  Ended up enjoying everything.  We went shortly after St. Patrick's day so we lucked out and got to try a few Irish dishes which is great considering my boyfriend is from Ireland.  Started woth coddle which he normally wouldn't eat at home but was excellent.  The rest of the small plates were tasty as well.  Ordered the pappadelle (spelling?) to split and I am still craving this 2 months later...delicious!  Overall great experience and it was nice to see chef/wife making quality authentic Irish cuisine and had some great reccomendations for music and local bars in the area.  Liked that they were raising money for local rugby club as well.,0.9905,0.745,0.255,0.0,0.4595238095238096
2013-05-15,2.0,"We went here last night for my birthday dinner and let me say, I was less then impressed. We decided on Ripasso because the owners/chef, whatever, used to be with Terragusto, this amazing BYOB italian joint on Addison which closed. I had gone to Terragusto two years ago for my bday dinner and it was a great meal, we were so impressed with the food, the service and the restaurant itself.  Ripasso's restaurant itself was okay, not great atmosphere, sparsely decorated, just not impressive. The service was as good as it could be considering. There was only one waiter with every seat filled in the restaurant. I felt so bad for this guy, he was the waiter, bartender and bus boy, and he did a great job, we had to wait a little bit once we got seated to get some attention but it was understandable since he had no help at all.  The food tasted good but every single thing we ordered had something not right about it. We started with the Brodo (meat filled pasta in broth) and the goat cheese crostini, now I love goat cheese, LOVE IT! And I never thought I would say this but....there was too much goat cheese on these. I had to scrap some off it was ridiculous. The Brodo was okay, the broth was amazing but we couldn't identify the meat inside the pasta so that was kind of scary. For our entree's we got the Neri pasta and Paparedelle. The paparedelle tasted good but looked like puke and the meat in the meat sauce was a weird grainy texture that was unappealing when in your mouth. The Neri was just okay, nothing special or noteworthy about the dish.  So unfortunately this was not a great experience. No idea why they closed Terragusto which was an amazing restaurant, only to open one that doesn't have half the charm or good food. Oh well, there is always next year to redeem my birthday dinner.",0.9948,0.726,0.202,0.072,0.6206533776301218
2013-04-29,1.0,"Saturday night. Near empty restaurant.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant and practically had an entire section to ourselves.  We were drinking but not drunk.  We were not interacting with or even acknowledging other tables (again, we were in the back of the restaurant alone).  The food was serviceable but not special.  The Parpadelle was good, the Sheppard's Pie was generally bland and one of the diners disliked her Ravioli; desert was good.   We had reached the end of our meal and one of our dining companions did not like her ravioli (it was untouched) and asked the waiter to remove it from the bill.  Out comes a large man in a baseball cap, Theo, the owner/chef.  Instead of addressing obvious concern that one of the dinners was unhappy with her meal he informed us that other tables were complaining about us.  Bear in mind, we had been there for over an hour without incident.  His comments were a clear response to one of us being unhappy with their meal as opposed to true complaints from other dinners (by this point I believe there were under 10 diners in the restaurant).  I was shocked, one of our party said ""oh, which one of the empty tables around us was complaining?  This one?  Or this one?""; referencing the fact that we had been surrounded by empty tables for well over an hour.  Theo got more defensive.  I still didn't know who this person was (he didn't introduce himself) and I was just trying to process what was happening.  Theo was rude and was clearly instigating.  Odd.  One of our Party, having met Theo previously, told Theo that he had really ""grown out"" his hair.  He kicked her out.  She immediately gathered her things and waited outside.  I stayed behind to deal with the bill; remaining calm and requesting the check.  Theo persisted to stand over my shoulder the entire time even as I had said nothing to this point and had provided my card for payment.  Bizarre.  Then, Theo started talking and criticizing our party again, unprovoked.  He was clearly trying to be a bully.  At this point, I had enough (he had not stopped harassing us...it was crazy) and exchanged words with Theo.  Theo responds by telling me I had to leave and slapping me on the shoulder in the process.  That is the first time I have been kicked out of anywhere in my life.  I am in my thirties.   His touching/contact was wrong.  There was no vulgarity or provocation to this point on my part and I had not been threatening in any way.  I signed the check and gave the server a good tip despite Theo's behavior.  Afterwards, I called Theo a couple of choice names in in retaliation for the touching/contact and informed him that, if he touched me again, I would be forced to defend myself.  Theo followed me out the door.  We had a nice conversation the entire time.   I feel that Theo took offense to somebody disliking her meal, kicked people out and, shockingly, got physical without just provocation.  Ultimately, at this point I must conclude that I had the unfortunate experience of running into an awful human being.  Theo is just a bad person, plain and simple.  This review is not so much an attack on average food at a questionable value so much as an attack on the character of a person who clearly has some major issues with anger, his own ego,  and women challenging him.  If you are comfortable patronizing that, well then have at it.  I'll be elsewhere.",-0.9753,0.746,0.11,0.144,0.5531225604996096

Even more odd, they are currently promoting a special Irish menu in support of a local team (I believe this was the reason, my apologies if I am incorrect) and were playing Irish music in support of the promotion. I liked the concept but it was just weird to go into a place expecting violins and pasta only to be offered bagpipes and shepard's pie.  Service was polite, but a bit clumsy/rushed. NOTE: I love ALL food, so nothing against shepard's pie! I also appreciate their interest in supporting the community, I just wished they figured out a better way to do it.

Olive Garden?!)  -Spumoni - This decadent dessert was a great way to end the meal.  The pistachio cream and berry mascarpone were delicious, and perfectly complimented the dark chocolate. - My Ommegang beer was Belgiantastic, as expected -My girlfriend raved about her Gin Death Punch, which tasted much more delicate and nuanced than the name implies The best part was that we got out of there for way less than expected.  We were too busy drooling at the menu to notice the very reasonable prices!",0.9951,0.755,0.222,0.022,0.5518913929208046

2012-10-28,5.0,"Bravo Ripasso! The pasta here is simply delicious and reminded me of some of the best I've had in Italy.  We made a reservation on gDine for a Sunday night and had an outstanding meal.  The gDine deal is $34/person and includes 3 courses and 2 glasse of wine.  The wine they serve is just the house red/white, but I thought the red far exceeded my expectations as it displayed reasonable structure, balanced fruit, and some light tannins on the finish. We started off with the polenta ricca. It was two hamburger patty sized polenta cakes seasoned with truffle oil. In between the cakes was thinly sliced ham and fontina cheese.  Incredible dish! I was impressed by how meticulous they were with the preparation of this dish and the light and fluffy texture of the polenta cakes.  We also ordered the zuppa: mussels, clams in a white wine sauce. Also served with two crosinis. I thought the broth was light, but showed surprising complexity since they used tomato peels to add a red sauce dimension to it. Kind of reminded me of how red wine is made where the grape skins are added to the wine. My only complaint was that there were not enough mussels and clams, but it was still a very enjoyable dish nonetheless. For my entree, I ordered the foletti. It was a pasta dish (tube pasta to be more precise) with sausage, rapini and cauliflower & pecorino cheese. The pasta tubes were homemade and complemented well by the sauce and cheese. The sausage really made this dish resonate as it has a spicy kick to it that added a bold dimension to the dish.  My wife ordered the pappardelle. This was fabulous. The noodles were excellent and complemented well by a superb meat sauce with delicate touches of truffle and parmigian cheese, it reminded me of some of the incredible pastas I have had traveling in Florence and Rome. Our server seemed pretty new and was although she was not fully aware of the gDine concept, where you prepay for your meal and get to choose the items you want, she was very accommodating and attentive.

On a recent early Sunday evening our party of four dined there all for the first time.  One of the reasons that we selected this restaurant is that it advertizes an assortment of unique house cocktails.  However, when we tried to order a couple, we were informed that no bartender was on duty and that only basic drinks were available.  That being the case, one of us ordered a straight up Manhattan that turned out to be skimpy and served in a stemless, bowl-shaped glass totally unsuitable for that type of cocktail.  Moreover, it took an inordinate time to prepare.  (I believe our waiter mixed the drink.)   The table bread, which is made in-house, was soft and spongy without a crisp crust and not to my liking.  The accompanying olive oil, however, was very flavorful.  Because of the limited entrée selections we opted to share multiple antipasti and a couple of pasta dishes.  Moreover, we had to order one of the plates prematurely because it was the last serving available despite the early hour and the dining room being only half filled.  Overall, the food was mediocre.  As to the service, our waiter was amiable but could not explain what constituted the chef's special that was a combination dishes for that evening.

One of the main reasons I selected Ripasso was because of the interesting cocktails featured on their website. When I asked to see a cocktail menu, I was told that their bartender only works on certain days and the night I was in wasn't one of them. So, the cocktails were not available. I have never been to a restaurant where an entire segment of the menu is only available on certain unannounced days. Total disappointment. We were told that they could make any classic cocktails we wanted. When my mother ordered a vodka with cranberry, she was informed that they didn't have cranberry juice.  After two quick strikes, I was ready to leave but wasn't in a position to. I hoped the food would turn my experience around and was only partially satisfied. The polenta and mussels were quite good. The suppli, which seem to get hyped on Yelp, were just OK. It just tastes like fried. I didn't care for the sformato at all (I found spinach in a creamy custard form to be off-putting). The pastas were generally fine. The folletti with eggplant and tomato sauce was very nice. The neri was interesting, although I found it hard to eat more than a few bites of it. While the gnocchi themselves were great, I didn't think the sauce was a good complement. We had the zeppoli and torta for dessert. They were fine but unmemorable and not worth the cost or calories. I'd skip desserts here and go a few blocks to Black Dog instead. I eat a lot of Italian food so it is only natural for me to compare Ripasso to my other experiences around town. This place is an inferior version of Letitzia's Fiore. Both have a cool drink program, although you can actually try Letitzia's. Both feature arancini and house-made pasta, but Letitzia's are better. Our server was very knowledgeable and informative. It did take a while to get drinks, which happens when the waiters are also the bartenders. Cocktail pours were weak for the money. Thankfully we didn't experience this, but there was an issue with condensation from the air conditioning dripping on certain seats. That is inexcusable in a restaurant at any level, let alone one of the caliber Ripasso aspires to.",0.9919,0.786,0.154,0.06,0.5205782312925171
2012-09-02,2.0,"Service was good and the place is actually pretty cute. But the food was not good. 6 of us went and they said for party more than 4, you have to do family style. We said ok but what's on our menu, right. The waiter said the chef will just prepare the menu like prixe fixe with appetizers, two main courses, and then desserts. We told the waiter no beef and no lamb. We were not given a menu in advance. So the first course came, it actually came with multiple dishes, potato sticks, spinach pudding and prosciutto salad. Not bad! And then the first main course came, with potato ravioli and shrimp and scallops cutter fish ink pasta. We were like, potato again!? Granted, the ravioli tasted kinda bland, it's stuffed with potato with the potato sauce. It's like very potato! The shrimp and scallop pasta tasted no bad actually.  Then the second course came with roasted duck and mushroom pasta. The duck was tender but lack of flavor. The pasta was the same, lack of flavor. It tasted something I can make at home. Usually home made pasta taste much better but this restaurant didn't do a good job with that, in my opinion. Along with the second course, there came with 2 side dishes, and they were spinach and mashed potato. We were like potato again?? And didn't we have spinach pudding for appetizer?  Although the mashed potato tasted pretty good, it was just too much potato at this time, it killed the appetite. The meal was very heavy at this point. Luckily the next course was desserts. We were jokingly saying wondering if dessert was potato too! Thank god they weren't! They were egg custard with peaches and I'm not sure what the other one was exactly. It was something with fried dough covered with chocalate. They were not the best tasting desserts.  Overall, the experience was lots of potato and spinach and flavorless food!",0.9029,0.766,0.138,0.096,0.42522045855379187

They initially tried to give us a high top table and I am not a fan. As for service, I would say it was OK, not great and not horrible. We went with the 4 course Chef's choice dinner. $39 per person sounded like a good deal. I rated this place with 3 starts for the overall experience, but there were some standout dishes for sure. We started with the spinach Sformato. This was excellent. Along with that was the insalata (Arugula, Parmesan, truffle oil dressing). It was lacking acid. I think it was too earthy. I normally like arugula, but the truffle oil did not compliment it. Next course was the Neri and Ravioli. Both were excellent. The Neri especially. It was very balanced and had rich, but not overpowering flavors. The fresh pasta was perfect. Next course was the Pollo. It was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were good. Last was dolci and this is where the meal fizzled out. There were three small portions of something that tasted like a Clif bar, almond brittle, and a cannoli. I'm not a cannoli fan, so dessert all around was lacking. I'd go back for most courses, but I would head elsewhere for dessert.",0.9926,0.765,0.2,0.035,0.5548090277777779
2012-08-06,3.0,"I want to begin by saying that Ripasso really needs to fix the problem they have with water condensation falling from the ""vent ducts"" in the celing (big pipes, just look up, they are pipes that have an industrial feel to them but I have no idea what they are called).  We went on a sunny evening after a rainy day, the rain probably had something to do with this issue.  For whatever reason water condensation forms on the vent ducts and that water fell on us and our table repeatedly, causing us to get up and move until waiters came over to clean up.  This is not pleasant, especially while eating.  In any event, they did their best to wipe the ceiling with a home made mop (rags tied to brooms).  But it was only a temporary fix until the next water issue arose.  I'd like to think they should have comped us desert, an appetizer, or something else for this unpleasant experience, but all they offfered was an apology, which was appreciated. Aside from that, service was pretty good.  Ambiance was nice as well.  But one thing stood out, the noise!  One had to yell to be heard and that was surprising given the restaurant is so small.  I feel like an old man complaing about noise, but seriously, if noise bothers you then skip Ripasso. Onto the food.   Bread Service: Standard white bread and olive oil.  Good but nothing unique. Bigne: These potato-cheese puffs came out a little soggy/greasy.  I'd skip them. Suppli: I liked these but they got mixed reviews from the table.  Very crispy with plenty of mozzerrella and a decent amount of greens. Polpetti: Standard fare meatballs that I thought were quite nice with a simple red sauce. Mussels: Very well done.  Broth had good flavor.  Again nothing crazy or unique but they got the job done.  I do wish they had given us 5 mussels, instead of 4.  We were a table of 5 and we would have paid $2 for a 5th mussel (item is $8 for 4 mussels). Pappardelle: All I can say is I don't get it.  Everyone loves this and cites the truffle oil.  I found it to be very good and light pasta...but it needed something more & lacked flavor.  Maybe it is me or we got a bad batch.  It just seemed bland. Pollo: I ordered this.  It was good.  Chicken needed more flavor but thankfully the potatoes had plenty of flavor, so if you ate the two as one bite it made for a very good combo.  Chicken was cooked perfectly, so it was rather moist. Wine: List is limited and most bottles are over $50 and maybe one or two were under $30.  We ordered a decent chianti and a white that I don't recall.  I do know that we tried to order a 2nd bottle of the white and they had run out of so we tried a different kind...I hate when this happens.  I can understand running out of an entre, becasue food spoils.  But I can't understand running out of a wine on your list. Overall, this place is okay.  They need to fix the water problem and step a few of the food items up and add a few wines in the $20 to $30 range.  If they can do that they'd be a 4 star but for now I can only give them 3.",0.9965,0.79,0.154,0.057,0.5297701149425288

One was a fantastic vegetable custard that came with a goat cheese-filled pastry, and the other was a delicious prosciutto salad, which was accompanied by a small dish of anchovies. It was the first time I liked anchovies! Our main courses were potato stuffed ravioli with pesto (FANTASTIC) and a seafood pasta dish, that was also sensational. Our waiter was excellent. Then we move to the 2-star portion. We waited 20 minutes for the waiter to clear our main course dishes. We then waited another 15 minutes for dessert.

First off, I've never tasted gnocchi like this - it was so light and airy, very pillow-like (most likely attributed to being homemade). Second, there was a decent portion of the seafood, which was was perfectly cooked. Last, the wine sauce was light but still had subtle flavoring so as not to overpower the ingredients.

2012-04-16,5.0,"Ripasso opened late last year in the heart of Bucktown. While it has flown a bit under the radar and not received nearly the recognition as other Chicago newcomers such as Next, GT Fish & Oyster,  Goosefoot etc., Ripasso is a great venue and a welcome addition to the Chicago dining scene. Chef/owner Theo Gilbert (who formally operated Terragusto) is serving upscale, modern Italian cuisine utilizing fresh, locally sourced products and housemade pastas. The ambiance is best described as cozy; it has understated but welcoming decor and the only knock is the acoustics are poor (so it can become quite noisy). In addition to serving dinner six nights per week, Ripasso offers events such as a variety of cooking classes and special Farmhouse dinners (descriptions on their website). Last night I dined at Ripasso for my first time as part of a charity event, Ruck 4 the Kids (raising money for youth rugby). Michael Carlson (uber talented Chef/Owner of Michelin starred venue Schwa) was on hand for a friendly cooking competition with Chef Gilbert. Each chef turned out approximately seven dishes and Ripasso's mixologist (Lorna Biljan) created some excellent cocktail pairings. I had read about this event in the Eater Chicago blog and have to admit I had not yet heard of Ripasso or Chef Gilbert and bought my ticket ($100 for the food and pairings) as I am a huge fan of Chef Carlson (my dinner at Schwa ranks in my top five dinners). While Chef Carlson did not disappoint (and he even served his famed quail egg raviolo) Chef Gilbert's courses were equally impressive. While Chef Carlson displayed more creativity and interesting (but successful) flavor blends, Chef Gilbert's food tasted just as good and was far more interesting then typical Italian fare. I also learned an interesting tidbit about Chef Carlson; before he hit it big he was actually a sous chef for Chef Gilbert and one of Chef Gilbert's prior venues. The Ruck 4 the Kids charity event was a lot of fun. Not only was the food both interesting and amazing, in true Italian fashion there was tons of food! Usually with high end cuisine I am used to such minuscule portioning, but this was a true gourmet feast! Lots of the dishes featured Iberico pork and one particular dish had a sous vide preparation and was outstanding.  Another standout as was a dish with octopus, mushrooms and beer foam. My favorite dessert of the night was a homemade Rice Krispie Treat served with a shot of Orchata. Each chef chose a mystery ingredient the other chef had to utilize and Chef Gilbert selected sour gummy candies (apparently a favorite indulgence of Chef Carlson). Chef Carlson utilized these in some interesting manners (especially a deconstructed Neapolitan where the strawberry component was made from melted strawberry gummies. However the gummies were a bit over utilized as they added such a potent artificial sweetness that they overpowered the other components. Chef Carlson selected blood for Chef Gilbert (in keeping with a rugby theme) and Chef Gilbert made one of the best courses of the night involving blood sausage with homemade pasta. About my only compliant foodwise was that for some courses there was not a description of what we were eating until towards the end of the evening (but the chefs were so busy and these were new creations - so the servers were not used to them; as such this is understandable).  While the charity event last night is certainly not the typical experience one can expect at Ripasso, Chef Gilbert came across as very genuine and charismatic and the food he created was excellent. I am eager to come back and try dinner here on a regular night and am confident it will rank up there with the best Italian restaurants I have dined in. Kudos to Chef Gilbert on putting together such a wonderful event last night! I look forward to returning and wish Ripasso much success.",0.9996,0.755,0.24,0.005,0.5051308612022898

We signed up for the Emiliana-Romagna region.   My wife and I were in Italy for the first time in June, and had the pleasure of experiencing a communal dinner on a ""Fattoria"" in the Tuscan countryside.  Our experience at Ripasso was so similar and fun, and we would highly recommend it.    At the start of the degustation, Chef Theo comes out to the two large tables set up  at the front of the restaurant.  The tables you are seated around are the tables they use in the morning to make their pastas.  Each table holds ten guests.  Chef Theo explains the first two courses in detail, which really gets your appetite going.   Also present is a sommelier who dines with you and, after Theo gives his schpeal, will speak about the first two course wines in detail.   The evening is very educational and we appreciated learning the ""hows and whys' of the selections and assembelages of the meal.   I won't break down each course in detail, but  to give you an idea of what you'll be in for, will say that the first course, Antipasti, consists of a selected wine, and three items.   The second course, Primi, consists of a selected wine and two pastas.  (This is were we died......the squash-stuffed Cappallacci (pope-hats) were incredible.  Equally so was the tagliatelle pasta in a four-meat sauce with white truffle oil - Ohhhhhh man....god-food!)   The third course, Secondi, consists of a selected wine and two items. (The roasted chicken dish was so flavorful! As it was said ""Anyone can roast chicken, but to do it really well takes talent"".)  The fourth course, Dolci, was  served with a sweet Moscato selection, and two items.   So, nine food items and four wine selections will take you on a quick trip to Italia.  Using the Groupon we bought made for a really good value, averaging $55p/p without the tax and tip.   We would highly recommend the ""Fattoria Experience""  for a fun and educational evening and plan on returning to experience another region.",0.9861,0.906,0.087,0.007,0.37664098972922494
2012-01-06,5.0,"Really excellent.  Had the five course chef's tasting.  Really spectacular.  The risotto.  Had everything else not been so amazing, one bite of this alone would have made me a believer.  Creamy, buttery risotto with heaping, perfectly cooked scallops, wild mushrooms, positively pheromone reeking of white truffles.   Earthy musk meets briney sea.  Talk about surf and turf. The pasta course brought not one, but two incredible achievements- a butternut squash ravioli dusted with crushed peach-pit biscotti, whose velvety pillows of love filled butter, butternut put anything I've ever made to shame.   The cream drenched, four legged, four meat (lamb, veal, pork, & beef) bolognese over house made pappardelle, also wafting of truffle, was. Well. I'm actually at a loss for words.  My mouth is actually watering right now as I think about it.  Umami. Game. Cream. Were I a different kind of person, I would never make pasta at home again, for shame. The meat course was a sleeper hit; at first it look like my mom's pork loin, but the sear crust (presumably a dry rub of salt, garlic, and cardimum?) coupled with delciously garlic, bitter rapini was greater than the sum of its parts.  After so much decadence, the meat course almost felt like a palate cleanser. But there's more.  If you call now...   the dessert course.  A whipped ricotta stracciatella with a homemade waffle cone was rich, nicely balanced and not at all over sweet.  The other dessert plate featured an apple/pecan streusel with a mild panna cotta and raw apple salad.  Again, individually, very, very good.  Eaten together, it was like apple pecan pie alla mode-- the sum far greater than its parts.

I couldn't get enough of this, it was delicious and I'd definitely come back again just for this dish. I also tried the Cappellacci which while it was very good, was a little on the sweet side for me (especially after having the Pappardelle). My only complaint of the night was the high noise level, but since it was packed, I guess that's to be expected.

2011-12-04,5.0,"This review is for the bar experience only, which I found to be immaculate. Captaining the bar is former Drawing Room apothecary Tim Lacey, and his style certainly binds Ripasso's cocktail menu. He's been known to make Fernet Branca taste good in a myriad of ways, but ""8 1/2"" is a stand out amongst those. The Fernet is rounded out with the El Dorado 5 yr Rum, cherry compote, lemon juice, orange bitters and is topped off with a flamed citrus peel in a stemless wine glass. It's reminiscent of a cocktail punch, but delivers an elegance with menthol undertones from the Fernet and the almost-umami depth from the cherries.  I was also fortunate to taste Tim's olive-oil washed Northshore Gin paired up with Ripasso's olive appetizer, which was an incredible match. The perfect briney, meatiness of the olives was cut with the edge of the Gin, but still left the tones of olive oil on my tongue.  I've heard good things about the food, but if you're like me you'll consider skipping all of that to have a seat at the bar. I promise, it's worth it.",0.9773,0.834,0.145,0.021,0.5428571428571428

Stumbling distance to the Damen Blue Line stop, Ripasso, will surely attract Bucktown inhabitants. Is it get in a cab and drive a couple miles worthy?  Probably not. We had a large party of 6. Which was awesome because you can let the chef pick what you eat, which we did, and eat family style. For the less adventurous you can pick options. Bucktown is known for mediocre Italian, Club Lucky or Forno, so it's nice to have a place that brings a different slant.

Others in our party had the squid ink pasta (really great flavor, not overly fish and the cauliflower was great in there) and the Pope's hats - stuffed squash ravioli. Too sweet for me for dinner but our dining companion loved it. We all cleaned our plates easily. Desserts were also great, especially the panna cotta. Not too sweet, great texture. Service was attentive and friendly, not hovering over us nor neglecting us. My only reservation with giving 5 stars was that I didn't love the ambiance of the place. It's too bright for a nice dining restaurant and it's a bit spare yet. I hope that's from the restaurant being new and not quite done with the finishing touches but the space does not yet have the warmth of Terra Gusto that makes me really feel at home to settle in and enjoy.

The host and our server were very nice.  They were busy, but found us a spot quickly.  Things went kinda downhill from there. The red wine was served very warm (seemingly above room temperature), which made this type of wine unappetizing.  When I told the server that I was going to switch to a white wine because the red was too warm I was asked if I wanted an ice cube to put in the wine.  I declined and was then told that the manager would come see me.  The white wine came but the manager did not.  I was charged for both glasses. The meatballs had fantastic flavor and texture, but were too salty.   The pasta was the biggest disappointment.  I found the carbonara heavy on the cream, which drowned out the other flavors--which were themselves muted.  My guest ordered the black pasta with shrimp--which was supposed to be spicy, but was not at all.  It effectively tasted like pasta dipped in water in which shrimp was boiled.  The shrimp was overcooked and tough (presumably began the day frozen).   Our check was almost $100.  I would expect much more for this kind of money.",0.9262,0.829,0.122,0.049,0.48280303030303046

The meat ball starter was quite good and we enjoyed the simple salad but our pastas and risotto were average. The pasta is well cooked but the rest of the dishes lacked flavor. The risotto was probably best and the other two pasta sauces didn't add enough to the dish.
