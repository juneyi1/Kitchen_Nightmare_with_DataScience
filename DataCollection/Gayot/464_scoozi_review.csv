2014-04-07,2.0,"I have been coming here and loving it for a long time and it has always been my go-to Italian place. However, after my last experience her I think I will be finding a new place for a while. Fist of all, the server we had rambled quickly through everything. He acted completely like we were bothering him, by sitting down to have a meal. I understand that the job of a waiter is hard, but I came to enjoy my meal not feel guilty because my waiter is clearly on the verge of a break down.  Second the last time I came here they had an amazing menu. Their new menu lacks imagination. Very basic. I ended eating chicken parmesan. IT was very disappointing. I thought maybe it was just me, but right as I thought that my husband looked at me and said ""man Scoozi's is really dropping the ball tonight."" Third, I ordered a cocktail with the intention of ordering more, but for it sat empty on my table because my waiter never came back to my table for the rest of our meal. We had to flag down a bus boy to get a dessert menu and our bill. Oh wait, our waiter did come back to read us the dessert menu. He did it without making any eye contact, and read it so fast neither my husband or myself knew what he said. We skipped on dessert, just paid and left.

2014-03-29,3.0,"I've learned to appreciate Scoozi as a fantastic takeout Italian joint - solid food, not extraordinarily priced, and they'll have your food ready 15-20 minutes after you call.  They give you a solid sized portion, not too little, but not like the massive portion that'll give you leftovers for four days straight (like at sister restaurant Maggiano's).  I've now only actually eaten at the restaurant once, and I'm wishing I had more often.  Unfortunately, now Scoozi is closing at the end of next month, likely to be turned from neighborhood Italian restaurant to the new hot LEYE restaurant - not that there's anything wrong with that, but there's something to be said about the neighborhood charm that Scoozi brings - big enough that it can feel lively on a weekend night, but that you can walk in on a weeknight without a rezzie and grab a bite to eat.  The ambience is great - lighting is not overly dim, the staff very friendly.  Our table gave us a great vantage point into the kitchen through the wine cellar / archway  We started with the brussel sprouts salad, nicely tossed with pancetta and currants to add a bit of sweetness, well spiced with salt and black pepper and shaved parmesan.  The vinaigrette was subtle and allowed the flavors in the ingredients to really shine here.   For an entree, I got the taglietelle bolognese, a pretty basic pasta dish, solidly executed . Nothing fancy, but the sauce had good flavor, the noodles not the freshest, but soaked up the sauce pretty well.  The sausage pizza we had this night was a bit disappointing.  The crust here is thin and cooked at a high temp, so it looks like it has that super thin crust char to it, but for some reason, our pizza was more chewy than crisp.  The sausage was pretty flavorful but just a bit sparse.  The addition of some fresh basil and the red peppers helped the dish though.   The meal was pretty standard for Scoozi - solid, nothing mind blowing.  It's a friendly environment and a great vibe - a nice contrast to a lot of other River North joints that seem to have a bit more attitude.  The menu has a nice variety, and is very affordable.   Unfortunately, it's closing at the end of April, but I hope to try and get there before the closing.   Pics and more on my blog entry: Permalink:  eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.9978,0.739,0.218,0.043,0.5624774056353005

Not very often do I feel the need to complain about a dining experience, but my experience tonight was not very pleasant at all. My wife and I received a LEYE gift card for the holidays and decided to use it tonight to enjoy some one on one time at your restaurant.  Upon arriving for our reservation at 7:30, we were told we would need to wait a few minutes for a table to be ready.  While waiting near the host stand, we overheard a couple who had a reservation request that they have a table for the two adults away from the 5 middle school girls they had brought to the restaurant with them.  The hosts agreed and were thanked by the couple.  Minutes later, we were taken to our table - a small two seater directly next to a table of the 5 middle school girls.  There was not even enough room for us to sit at the table without having to pull the table out to get into the booth.  While we were seated basically at the same table as these girls, they continued to take pictures with their phones, play with their food and ruin our experience. As we were eating our main dishes, one of the girls misplaced her iphone and went to find her father (conveniently seated across the restaurant), they came back to search all around AND under both of our tables while my wife and I were eating.  A manager came to assist the girls as well, but not once stopped to apologize for our inconvenience.  At this point we asked for our food to be wrapped and for the check, yet again without any concern from the staff for our terrible table and horrible service. It was a wasted saturday night and a lot of wasted money on what was supposed to be a romantic evening for me and my wife.  We will not be returning to Scoozi.",0.4701,0.815,0.104,0.081,0.31437728937728937

Also, the menu is good for sharing, similar to Quartino's, which was great. The veal meatballs were my favorite: perfectly tender and delicious sauce. The rigatoni with chicken was also perfectly seasoned and cooked. If you share meals, they already separate out the proportions, which is really nice!

2013-05-06,4.0,"Scoozi is one of my all-time favs in the city. Whenever I have no idea where to go for dinner, I usually end up at Scoozi. It's always a hit and always satisfies. Went with my parents this past Saturday around 5:30, it started to get packed! Sat in a booth, a friendly waiter (forgot his name!) came up and didn't rush us to order. He had some great suggestions for dishes and wine pairings. Answered my dad's question about the short ribs without hesitation. Now that's confidence.  I had what I always have, the gnocchi/ravioli trio. You get to choose 3 tastings of the raviolis and gnocchi on the menu. I had the ever-so traditional tomato and cream gnocchi, crab ravioli, and pesto mezzaluna. The gnocchi LITERALLY melt in your mouth. SO. GOOD. Scoozi doesn't use your run-of-the-mill marinara sauce here. The crab ravioli was succulent and tasty. My family is from Maryland so I can tell immediately if they use imitation crab. Nope. Light chunks of crab garnish on top of the raviolis and they're stuffed inside with perfection. The pesto mezzalunas were slightly crispy, but very tasty in the tomato sauce. Not too much pesto, either. They weren't drowning. Dad had the filet, mom had the short ribs. All were a smash. No left-overs here! I had a couple espresso martinis as well. Again, amazing.  I do have a few gripes about Scoozi. I hate that the bruschetta is only 3 pieces. Ugh. Come on! At least give us more than a few bites! It's so good I could have multiple servings as my meal. Also, the menu is very small. They have the basics and the classics, some specials, but I wish they changed it more often, or added more. Maybe more risotto selections? I'm a huge risotto fan but never stop by when something looks tasty.  Dessert is always had when we come here. What Scoozi does right is offer the profiteroles in a group of 3! They used to offer them individually which was always annoying. No need to let my server know I have an inner fat girl.",0.9625,0.832,0.116,0.052,0.4684077380952381

The kale salad had a ring of ricotta cheese drizzled with honey on top that made it a top notch salad. The veal meatballs came with a chunky marinara sauce that had a little kick to it and I loved it! I'll definitely go here again. Great for groups because it's on the noisy side.

The tuna had a nice crust on it and the prosciutto was very salty but the cheese balanced it out for a few good bites. The pizza was of the cracker crust style which I am not a fan of. There was absolutely no chew whatsoever and a nondescript flavor to it. The toppings were average at best....no better than any local corner pizzeria. The saving grace of our dinner was the gnocchi with sausage dish. Even though the sausage was basic ground Italian, the tomatoes worked really well with the Parmesan sauce and the tender flavorful gnocchi.

Whoever makes that bread should pat themselves on the back every night for a job well done. So wonderful, so soft and crunchy at the same time. Yum. The beets said balsamic glaze but I didn't taste any.  Plain tasting and a huge let down because I LOVE beets. I added some salt and oil from the table to my dish. They were also cut into really huge chunks. I have beets all the time at home and it doesn't take much to make a beet really shine. There was no effort here. The grilled calamari - not good. If you can't say anything nice... The chopped chicken salad - Amazing! I could eat this all the time. This salad has prosciutto, avocado, gorgonzola and sweet basil dressing. So many good things. I would be very happy just eating this and the bread. This salad is crazy filling for one person. Even if you share this salad you end up being super full.  The pizza is ok. Kind of plain tasting.

Arrived at 8pm and headed straight to the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and was knowledgeable about their extensive wine selection.  I tend to just ask random questions just to see what they would say even though I know im going to only order something as simple as Crown on the rocks.   We had reservations for 8:45pm.  Considering how extremely busy it was, we got seated at 8:50 which was fantastic.   Started with the Tomato and Basil bruschetta with their lobster bisque.  The bruschetta was great.  You get 3 thick toasted pieces of french bread loaded to the top.  So much, that we asked for more bread, which was great.  The bisque was full and creamy with just the right amount of basil. I ordered the SHRIMP & LIMONE.  Its 5 pieces of jumbo shrimp, broccolini, capellini, lemon garlic sauce.  Keep in mind, this is a SHRIMP dish, not a pasta dish.  The pasta a small portion which would probably satisfy the normal adult.  But Im a fairly big guy so i need more than a few strings.  All I had to do was ask for more, and BAM, it was on my table in 5 minutes.  Did I also mention it was free of charge =) My wife ordered the RIGATONI with SMOKED CHICKEN which has spinach, mushrooms, parmesan cream.  We eat at a good amount of Italian restaurants, and my wife said this was one of the best she was ever tasted.  The cream wasnt too cheesy, and the mushrooms were diced thin and scattered throughout the dish evenly.   Terrific service since we went through their revolving doors.  Our server was attentive, but not to the point when we have to keep waving her off to get away.  She was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu.  The manager even visited our table to great us and to ask how our experience was going so far.  Recently found out that they were giving out free truffles to every guest they had that evening.  I missed out!

2011-10-27,4.0,"Although I live a block away from Scoozi, I always forget about it when racking my brain for dinner options. I shouldn't--it's a crowd-pleaser, with consistently good food. Your mind won't be blown, but you can guarantee a good, hearty meal. (in other words--think perfect for the parents or extended family). The great thing about Italian is there is something for everyone (*not counting you weird carb-avoiders*): pasta, pizzas, meats, salads, and of course, cheese. So when your parents are adverse to trying, say, that new Ethiopian restaurant, think Italian. And think Scoozi. Their margherita pizza is always a solid choice, and if you aren't very hungry, think their chopped salad. Probably one of the best I've ever had.  Scoozi loses points when it comes to service, though. The last few times I've been here, our server has rushed us along to the point where it has been uncomfortable. I get it--it's a busy restaurant. But when there are plenty of other open tables, there's no need to piss off your paying customers who are ordering that second bottle of wine.

I actually preferred my meal here to picollo sogno. Picollo has amazing pasta, very tough to beat, but i've had some entrees there that were close to being busts (beef shortribs, and a veal chop special which was a bit of a diappontment).

The block is nondescript at first, but then you come upon the absolute cutest outdoor cafe seating area for Scoozi - so quaint you're practically in Italy with everyone sipping on their glasses of vino. I adore the outdoor area so much that I have yet to experience the expansive indoor seating. We bring our dog and it's great to be able to have her sit under the table on a nice summer day. The server even brings a little water dish out for her which indicates the high level of courtesy/service provided here. This is a Lettuce Entertain You establishment so I was pretty skeptical of it's ""authenticity."" However, they proved me wrong as the pasta is homemade and the atmosphere is lovely. They start you off with bread, oil, and grated parmesan. I gobble up way too much of it - spoils my dinner every time but it's so good and addictive.

2011-07-26,4.0,"Overall: Great neighborhood Italian restaurant. Food/Drink: My go-to menu item is the risotto of the day. It's usually some kind of shrimp or scallops over risotto with veggies and pretty flavorful. My only complaint about the menu is everything tends to be on the salty side... so be sure to drink lots of water. (or wine ;-) whatever floats your boat.) The chicken marsala is also and good option. The pizzas are large enough to share with a salad. Entree portions are almost all large enough to share. Atmosphere/Service: It's a large, exposed brick room with booths and tables, high tops around the bar. It can get a little loud when it's full, but overall the noise doesn't bother me. It's vaguely reminiscent of Carraba's in atmosphere, but more upscale. I've always had a good experience with servers. Price: Pasta is about $15, entrees range from $16 - $30  Tip: Make a reservation, it can get pretty busy on weekend nights.",0.9647,0.832,0.152,0.016,0.5598001175778955

Scoozi has been around for quite some time. I know my wife and I went here when we were dating and we have been married over 20 years, so being in business for that long means they must be doing something right.  We ordered a Margherita pizza as a starter to split. The pizza was just alright for me. The crust is quite cracker like. I prefer a bit of a char and a chew more Neapolitan style. The rest of my party liked it better than I did.  I ordered the create your own 3 choice Ravioli / Gnocchi for an entree and went with the mushroom version of the gnocchi and the Marsala version of the ravioli. I only wanted two for my choices so the waitress asked which item I wanted two of since it is served in this three partitioned serving dish. Both the gnocchi and ravioli were quite good.  Other entrees chosen were a cavatelli dish, gnocchi in a tomato-cream sauce, mussels, and a brussel sprout salad (yikes!)  Everybody seemed to enjoy their entrees, I tasted all of them (except the brussel sprouts) and they were all good.  Service was only OK. I know that the place is big and busy but I just thought the service could have been better, hence it affects how I rate.

Fresh italian bread, with a little olive oil and pepper - a perfect starter to go with a nice dry martini. What's amazing is how reasonable the restaurant is. On Mondays they have 10 dishes for $10 each, all really great deals! As tempting as they sounded though, I chose the shrimp risotto, which was outstanding. Light and creamy risotto with abundant shrimp, green peas and a touch of mint. I was also very pleased with the wine selection.

2010-08-02,1.0,"My review is strongly influenced by their advertised ""gluten free"" menu - this was the reason my family chose to dine there as I as gluten intolerant.  The ""gluten free"" menu was largely similar to those most businesses use - they list the items on their menu that are normally gluten free and pretend it's a separate menu. However, when I checked on line I saw that they said all their pastas could be made gluten free. So I decided I would try it out.  We arrived about 10 minutes early on a Monday evening. The place was maybe 1/3 full, probably less. Incredibly, we were forced to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes for our name to be called out, while staring at a largely empty restaurant with all the tables already set up.  For my meal I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese, gluten free. The waitress took the order and that was that.  We got some olives for an appetizer that were inexplicably made so hot (as it temperature) that we couldn't eat them almost until the meal came. Then I got my dish. First, I'm looking at it and it's very clear that the pasta is not tagliatelle. But what's bothering me more is the texture and the appearance of the pasta. That, and the large amount of water at the bottom of the bowl. I took one bite and I knew what was going on.  I had been served bean curd noodles with a thin bolognese sauce. Bean curd noodles do not go with bolognese sauce. They are chewy and sticky noodles for asian cuisine and have never ever belonged anywhere near bolognese. The gross-out factor was magnified by the massive amount of liquid at the bottom of the bowl. Evidently, whoever dropped the bean curd noodles in the boiling water didn't realize how sticky they become and thus how important it is to drain them much more than you would normal noodles. I took one bite and honestly became nauseous.  The hostess came over and remarkably, was complete unapologetic, telling me that that was what they had for gluten-free pasta. My question then is why they said not only on the menu that they had all the pastas available gluten-free but why when I ordered tagliatelle, the waitress didn't tell me that I would in fact be receiving bean curd noodles. I tried to explain to the woman that this simply wasn't an appropriate noodle for the sauce and her response was that they didn't make the pasta fresh. First of all, that's not a great admission but secondly, it's just as easy to buy a box of gluten-free pasta designed to work with italian sauce as it is to buy bean curd noodles which have nothing to do with anything served at this restaurant.  I was pretty shocked by this. No one admitted that this was nothing approaching cuisine. They brought me the gluten free menu again and recommended I try some of their cheese. Yikes.  The main problem was the attitude. They were rude and inconsiderate and the food was cheap tasting. I was much better off going to a local italian dive that has no problem using a box of gluten free pasta. What a joke.",0.8813,0.856,0.084,0.061,0.5512713387241688

But despite its landlocked characteristics, Scoozi's seafood was fresh and tasty, chock full of scallops, shrimp, mussels and calamari. It made me just the right amount of full - and I had a little room left over to have a slice of the decadent chocolate birthday cake that came out for me at the end of the meal. Supposedly this is their specialty and I understand why!  The service was friendly and smiley and though our big party was a bit cramped in our booth, we stayed put when they asked us if we wanted to move to a bigger table.

My friend went with a trio of short rib ravioli, mezzaluna bandiera ravioli along with the tomato & cream gnocchi.   We were both happy with our selections and since we had the bread and caprese before our meal, neither one of us could finish our entree.  We would definitely go back again!!  Just thinking about the chicken sausage, I'm getting hungry!",0.9901,0.812,0.183,0.005,0.6451719576719577

There was a 40 minute wait for a table - not bad for 7pm on the Saturday night before Mother's Day - so we grabbed two spots at the bar where we were promptly given two beautiful chunky slices of fresh bread and a plate of olive oil with freshly grated parmesean.

2010-04-19,4.0,"Dare I say that I am a fan of Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants?!  Its true...what can I tell you?  We got a coupon in the mail for $25 to Scoozi!!  SCORE!! So we decided to check it out Friday night.  I made reservations for 8pm...and off course we were late (tends to be a trend with us...but its not my fault, the BF takes forever!!!!)   When we got there it was pretty busy and there were people waiting to get seated.  We checked in with the hostess and waited about 7 minutes or so to get sat (even though we were like 15-20 min late). The place had a mixed crowd of all ages and the bar area was completely full. We lucked out (not so much) and got seated next to a 12 or 13 year old's b-day party!!! YAY!!!  So there were 8 girls doing lots of giggling, laughing, singing and walking around...No worries, we survived. Our waitress was very nice, and extremely bubbly (I'm guessing she had a couple of shots of expresso).  She told us about the menu and made some suggestions of pick-3 combinations we could get. She seemed confident in her suggestions (or maybe it was the caffeine), but we decided to trust her.... We started with: A nice piece (yes they just give you one per person...although we didn't ask) of toasted french bread and a plate oil and Parmesan cheese..You can't go wrong with that. Pick-3 appetizer which consisted of our choice of little samplings of the following items - grilled calamari (3 small pieces and totally not impressed), roasted beet and hazelnuts (was very good, and we added goat cheese to it and BAM - kick-ass), and Eggplant Caponata (very tasty). I was annoyed however, that it took about 20 minutes for these to come out!! For dinner we opted for the create your own trio, we chose the tomato and cream gnocchi (really tender and tasty), mezzaluna bandiera ravioli - spinach, ricotta, alfredo and tomato sauce (VERY tasty), and the short rib ravioli (too salty and not very good). We also got the rigatoni with smoked chicken, which was great!  We loved the combination of the smoked chicken with the pasta and creamy sauce...don't forget we had some left over goat cheese and that added flavor to every dish we had! (We ended up taking this whole thing home...too much food!) But....we had to try the dessert that the waitress had raved about!  The menu did not do it justice - it was described as plum ravioli or something like that.  But what it really is...light, fluffy layers of phyllo dough, encrusted in sugar with a warm, sweat plum sauce in the middle, topped with vanilla ice cream.   It was crunchy and sweet on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside...YUMMY! A lot of people had pizza and this seemed to be a very popular choice...I think we will try it next time. Overall a good experience, we will be back and will probably bring our friends.  It really reminded me of Maggiano's, but with lower prices.",0.9969,0.828,0.151,0.021,0.4962738679759956

I won't say that the food at Scoozi is phenomenal. It certainly didn't blow me away the past few times I've been there but then again, it doesn't have to blow me away to make me come back here. The food is has been consistent and it may not be one of the ohmygawd-you-must-go-here places in Chicago, but the food is good for a place where you want to have Italian food in a place where most diners are locals and not tourists. The price is also reasonable. And so for that, I will come back to Scoozi. They have $5 pizzas at the bar on Wednesdays. Eat half and save the other half for your lunch the next day. The pizza is huge. I also tried their linguine fruitte di mare and it was only $16.95. I remember paying more than $20 for this same dish in several other Italian restaurants in the city. Their profiteroles are also good. If you're going to get it, bear in mind that the portion is quite big especially if you've just had pasta for dinner.

We made a reservation for 7, kept us waiting for 20 minutes and then placed us at table where I had to sit at the most awkward angle. So so far I am not loving this place. Like we are not trusted with the oil, cheese, and bread, the bus boy give us one piece of bread and puts the oil and cheese on a small plate in the center of the table and leaves. Yes the bread was delicious and the basil olive oil was divine, but give us 2 plates for 7 hungry people... another strike. Oh then comes our waitress! Oh what a delight if I loved a scatterbrained person! So my boyfriend's dad orders a pizza for appetizers and orders a salad for himself (this has a point I swear) and half the table gets to order. She gets to me and I ask her about the specials. well 20 minutes later she comes to our table and asks... you ready to order and I look at her and say... the specials? Oh my I forgot (well 20 minutes of not checking back would do that),  well I dont have the sheet but I know them from memory so let me tell you. Well we have a salad but you guys already ordered a salad so let me move to the entrees. Wait... I didn't order a salad nor did I get to order anything.. so the waitress really was bugging me. I didn't like the specials because she was going on and on and my face was like .. I don't like this so don't tell me how creamy and buttery it is because I don't care! My boyfriend and I ended up splitting the PENNE ARRABIATA with SAUSAGE.. which was actually pretty good, but didn't make up for the horrible service. The table next us was given Parmesan cheese with their pasta and salads and we were ignored. So I have to say.. the food was all right and the service was horrible.

2010-03-15,1.0,"Scoozi is lousy, and I can't figure out how it fits into the Lettuce Entertain You family. So here's a little story about why you should enjoy your time and money elsewhere:  I'm always hard pressed to find dinner on a Sunday night past nine. Options are so limited. So as we brainstormed, we came up with Scoozi. Never been before, had a taste for Italian, and I blindly expect Lettuce restaurants to be a safe bet. At 8:15pm, I called ahead to find out what time the kitchen closed. The host said 11pm. Wow! Another late-r night option ~ great, I thought. And off we went. We arrived about 8:30, and the host quoted a 45 minute wait, but offered immediate seating at the bar, which we happily accepted. I thought it was strange that there was such a long wait.....but no one at the bar. Literally, we were the only customers sitting there. The bartender was busy with 4 tables in the bar area. She hurried back and forth and seemed busy, and after ten minutes, she had still not acknowledged us. I didn't want this to be my dinner experience, so I headed back to host land  and asked again how long the wait would be for two people.Suddenly the wait was only fifteen minutes.  Great, put my name on the list. I'm starving. Back to the bar. A busboy / bar back guy finally brought us a drink.  Soon enough our name was called, and off to the table we went. We waited more that ten minutes to be greeted by a server. Ten minutes, again! We were ready to order by the time she appeared to make menu recommendations. Polite and friendly she was, but ten minutes is plenty of  time to for hungry people to realize that we obviously chose a bad place. As we mulled over the menu with our server, we decided to start with three things and see if we wanted anything more  later. That is when she told us the kitchen closed at 9. How is it that the person answering the phone would tell a caller the wrong hours?? Had I not been starving, this rough start would have been enough to make me get up and leave.  Had I not been starving, I also would have returned the carmelized beet salad that was our first course. I adore beets, so I was intruiged by the description of carmelized beets with ricotta salata. How would a beet be carmelized, I wondered. Well it wasn't. The beets were just strange and soft and seemed kind of old and wierd. The ricotta salata was baked, I think. My boyfriend kindly pointed out that it smelled like dirty mop water and refused to eat it. I was starving, so I scarfed it down anyway. But again, not starving would have equaled a definite return to the kitchen.  Next came a sausage and onion pizza. Yum!!! That's where they earn the singular star. This thin crust pizza was crisp with heavy red sauce and juicy sausage....not greasy or too cheesy, just a nice, clean pizza. We also had the cavatelli with pancetta in a parmesan broth. A more accurate description would be cavatelli in  a pancetta broth. Perhaps some parmesan was in there somewhere, but it was basically a squealing Wilbur soup.  The pasta was delicious, though, and we totally enjoyed it. Mid -dinner was the second time we saw our server, and we knew if we might want another glass of wine in the future, this would be our only chance.  We both ordered a Barbera d'Alba that was $12 a glass. Yuck. I couldn't even finish the glass because it was so un-delicious. The wine wasn't corked or turned, but just generally bad and cheap tasting. When ordering wine, my expectations are closely aligned with the price point, and these didn't match up.  No matter what happens in life, I order dessert. I chose the apple crisp with cinnamon gelato. It is like a baby apple pie ~ about six good bites. Nothing astounding there, but I needed sugar, and it was yummy enough.  The cinnamon gelato had a strange, overpowering cinnamon flavor that makes me doubt it was real cinnamon. I couldn't quite place the familiar flavor until my boyfriend said it tasted like redhots. Exactly! Not bad tasting, but very unnuatural. What's in there, Scoozi? Cherry jolly ranchers do not taste like actual cherries, and this was sort of like that, if you know what I mean.  This dining experience cost $100 for one salad, one small pizza, a pasta, a little dessert, and four glasses of wine. If I could turn back time, I'd choose the money.",0.9923,0.801,0.123,0.076,0.45419737339380184

A slice of tirimisu rounded out the meal.  Good?  Yes, I suppose, but not the best I've ever had.

The biggest offense was that the busboy placed a large stack of short plates on our table halfway through our meal in preparation for the next cover. Smaller annoyances included the clearing of plates before everyone had finished eating (classless), and the thrice attempted seizure of our extra menu (with the wine list). The one plus was our server, a younger woman with short hair, who was both friendly and knowledgeable. When my sister asked for a wine recommendation, she offered a tasting of the two wines by-the-glass that fit my sister's rather specific request. She's the only reason this place gets two stars instead of one. Food: Anti-pastas: The bread was warm but too salty. Plus one of us got a super salty bite. YUCK! The Caprese salad wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. My brother-in-law, a huge fan of lobster bisques, thought it was skimpy on the lobster. Entrees: My chicken parmesan was lukewarm. It wasn't cold, but I would have sent it back if it wasn't already overcooked. The pastas were bland and the veal meh. Desserts: You can get better Tiramisu at the Jewel. The Apple Crisp just tasted like cinnamon and apple and oatmeal thrown together. Price: I thought it was pricy for the fare, but we did benefit from their Tuesday wine discount. Décor/Ambiance: The interior is pleasant (I liked the rafters and the bar), but it's loud. Oddity: The men's bathroom had an old sink with a wide basin. The hot water and cold water spigots were so far apart (and SO hot and SO cold) that it was a challenge to figure out an approach to wash my hands.

After one of those I-know-too-many-places-to-decide-on-one roadblocks, my parents asked if we'd like to go to the ""Tomato Place."" They knew that wasn't the title of the restaurant, but we figured it was Italian food, and we like tomatoes, so we agreed. A fake, oversized tomato hangs outside above the entrace, so I guess I can understand where they're coming from. The restaurant is very large, but broken up into many different booths, kinda like Wildfire - except that it's not as crowded, and its taller celings make it easier to hear yourself think/your dining companions talk. It looks like a converted railroad station and has a nice old-school feel. I didn't eat too much here, since I'd already eaten lunch at XOCO around 3pm. Thus, even around 9pm when we went, I was stuffed. I got the chopped salad, which was fantastic! The light dressing and bits of pancetta added nicely to it. I'll probably update this whenever I return and sample more food, but so far so good. This is a LEYE, chain-feeling restaurant, and I can understand a 3-star review, but I would boost it up to 4 given the service.

I ordered the gnocchi trio and my boyfriend ordered the chicken scarpetta.  I think the servings were just about right.  Sampling all three types of gnocchi offered allowed me to decide on what I would order again or recommend to someone else.  I recommend the pear and gorgonzola while my boyfriend liked the bolognese the most.  In reality, the gnocchi could just be skipped because it was pretty basic.  We also ordered the polenta which was surprisingly not bad and the bellinis to drink were tasty but left more to be desired.

But I happen to like a few places on their list even though I rarely go to them, it's partly the touristy feeling but also because they like to try my patience. What I mean is, they make you wait forever even though you make a reservation (which I highly recommend), they pack the bar (with only people waiting) so tightly that you can't even get near it to order a drink, I wouldn't say that they are very authentic with their food, and finally I believe they are way over priced for the overall experience. All my grumbling aside I love Scozzi, but I must confess I get the exact same thing every time.  I am in completely in love with their Bruschetta, I've experienced bruschetta from all over (trust me I have) and Scozzi is #2 (#1 Broadway cellars but they cheat, they put calamari on theirs). The prefect blends of fresh tomatoes, basil, fantastic oils, and the best crispy ciabatta bread. My other dish is the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, their Alfredo sauce is excellent and the chicken is always cooked perfectly. Sadly I've never tried anything else, and I'm ok with that. These two dishes are so good I have to be rolled out of here afterwards and go home to nap.

That said, their pizza is very dry and not super flavorful.  And last time I was there the server accidentally bumped over my glass of red wine --into my lap and all over my clothes.  He was really apologetic and I know he didn't mean to do it, but it was a bummer and all they took off the bill was a round of wine and a free dessert.  Fair enough I guess, but it'd ruined a few hundred dollars worth of clothes (the one day I dress up, right?)!  Plus, sitting in wet, salty clothes (we tried to lift the stains via salt and soda water) kinda bummed me out on what was supposed to be a nice evening.

The balsamic vinagrette gave it the kick it needed. Man, I was in total heaven.  The only downside was the small wine glasses.

We started with the baked goat cheese and caprese salad. The baked goat cheese was really, really good, however they took it away before we were done with it (they didn't even ask).  The caprese salad was average to below average for the soul reason that they used baby tomatoes and there were only 4 or so of them.

When they brought it back after the reheat it was not seperated and everything got put together which annoyed me. My husband had the pizza margharita which was burnt. He said the crust was awful and there was no sauce. Others in our party also said that the food was cold and sub par. One of my friends had the sea bass special and he said for $22 that he thought it was really quite small. The desserts were redeming as we shared the tiramisu and the chocolate cake.

Two Italian staples done well and served with a beautiful presentation. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their dishes which included salads, pasta, and pizza. 4-stars here. Why they lost a star: Although kid friendly (most groups on a Sunday night were there with children), they placed us in the most inconvenient spot for a child needing a highchair. We were in the way of patrons and waiters the entire meal. The restaurant was half-full and we definitely could have been placed at a table that would have worked better for our party. The food is good but not worth the price. Linguine with meat sauce for $13? I don't think so. I could go somewhere else and pay half the price for the same quality or pay that price and at least have a better meal. Finally, all the parking in that neighborhood is permit after 6pm, which means paying the $10 valet fee or walking many blocks from a parking spot that you might never find. Good (but not great) food and kid friendly. I'd go again if in the neighborhood, but wouldn't go out of my way with so many other options in Chicago. A little side-note: the last time I was here it was for my prom dinner! This shows that it can be a more romantic, kid-free evening and they do a great job of accommodating large parties.

We arrived earlier than our reservation, so we sat at the bar to order a bottle of wine and appetizers.  Our party of four was a bit crowded around the tiny bar table, but we survived.  The appetizer of prosciutto stuffed with mozzarella was so good I wanted to lick the plate.  The standard bruschetta had a little too much tomato topping, so it fell all over my lap when I took a bite, but it was still good. The only downside of eating at the bar before being seated was that they didn't let us transfer the check, so I had to pay twice. A tad bit annoying. I'm surprised they weren't more liberal with the complimentary bread.  I was slightly offended at the single slice of bread since I have a high affinity for carbs. The chopped salad (again, with that amazing prosciutto) was fantastic.  I had the pizza pasta (or whatever fancy name they gave it on the menu).  The pepperoni gave the dish just the right spice, but without it, the pasta would have been bland. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes as well, except one lady in our party seemed to have a little too much pasta, and not enough 'fillings.' Either that, or she was picky.  The entrees are small enough to finish in one sitting, unless you add in apps and salads.
