2014-01-24,2.0,"The two reasons that drew us to this place were that we had a Groupon and it's very close to where we live. As convenient as it is, I don't think we'll be returning... Don't be fooled! ...although the menu looks like it might kinda fancy, it was very basic food. The baccala' cakes was basically fried mac and cheese balls with very little flavor. In terms of flavor for everything else we ate, if you like to eat spoonfuls of salt, I highly suggest you eat here! I do enjoy adding salt to anything I'm cooking but in the end, we couldn't even finish our main courses after everything else we were eating because everything was just too salty. That being said, I think it was quite overpriced for the quality of food. The atmosphere was nice and the bar area looked cool as well - if I was in the area and wanted a drink I would probably stop here. The staff were all extremely nice, although they forgot to give us one item we ordered and charged us for it...but that's our fault for not double checking the receipt.  The only things that would really bring me back here would be my desperate need for a drink and the good conversation with the friendly staff.",0.9363,0.831,0.119,0.049,0.5256372549019608

The food, fortunately, didn't match the atmosphere.  The two of us shared the squash gnocchi as an appetizer.  I got the pork belly special, she got the veal brisket, and we shared polenta.  Everything was very flavorful and well done.  I wouldn't quite say perfect, but the flaws were pretty small (gnocchi texture was squishy not fluffy, some items were very salt-heavy, etc).  There were some highlites, notably the puree and pickled cabbage under my pork belly and the roasty farro under the brisket were really tasty and very fall-appropriate.   When I think of the other upscale options along Clark Street north of Ceres in Andersonville, I can't really think of a better one.  In reading other reviews, maybe we were lucky to be there early when it was slow to ensure good service.  We were also Groupon users, and detected no hint of discrimination from our server.  The drinks weren't outrageous, but maybe an ounce or two smaller than you'd get for the same price elsewhere.  Whew.",0.9762,0.823,0.142,0.035,0.5211412151067324

However, the welcome of the chef/proprietor -- who was ubiquitous this evening -- was appalling.  The evening began as we were met by him at the door and we confessed to him that this was our first visit and ""we had always wanted to try it"".  Instead of a ""glad you're here now"", we got a surly ""well why didn't you!""  Thoroughly reprimanded for our past negligence, we were shown to our table. The proprietor proceded to bring all the courses to our table, nary a word, continuing his surliness.  Made us feel right at home, if by home you mean prison.  Only other problem was the small wine pour. At $9 a glass of a wine that is $9 a bottle in the store, the pour could have been more generous without hurting the restaurant's bottom line. A good dinner out is good food, good service, good company -- all of these are necessary and there are so many restaurants in Chicago that meet our needs.",0.975,0.8,0.16,0.04,0.6165773809523809

For carnivores, there are some real treats.  Without realizing it until it was too late, I put together a three-course meal comprised of nothing but pasta.  In retrospect, I should have started with a salad, but the reason for my final selections was that I couldn't decide between two enticing dishes. So I started with the fusilli with bolognese sauce, shiitake mushrooms, white truffle oil, and parmigiano reggiano (delicious); then my wife and I shared the pumpkin gnocchi with sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, and garlic sauce (lovely and interesting even when omitting the pancetta).  But for my main course, I hit a grand slam:  cavatelli with wild boar, baby spinach, leeks, and pecorino.  Outstanding!  And a giant portion!  This was one of the best dishes that I've eaten in recent memory, and I brought two-thirds of it home. The dessert menu was another stumper, as we gave serious consideration to the chocolate olive oil cake, the plum tart, and the pumpkin creme brulee.  Ultimately we chose the rice pudding with poached pear and crispy almonds.  It was a satisfying end to yet another great date-night dinner.",0.9866,0.82,0.148,0.032,0.626750423489554
2013-10-18,4.0,"Ceres Table was a perfect date spot to take the boyfriend for his birthday. We went around 7:30 on a Thursday night and were seated almost immediately. The wine list features a lot of less-common Italian wines; luckily for us, the waitress knew her stuff and explained the by-the-glass options. We went with a full, but not overpowering Sangiovese.  For starters, we ordered the arancine, which I could eat as dinner themselves. They came with a buttery tomato sauce and a fresh green sauce and were stuffed with an artichoke heart. So creamy and cheesy and crispy--Think of fried Mac and cheese's elegant Italian cousin.  The menu is small. There's a definite Italian influence, but you won't find endless pasta and breadsticks. I found this kinda refreshing. I ordered the Sicilian meatloaf and the birthday boy got the ricotta gnocchi. The meatloaf was fine; it was overshadowed by the MASHED POTATOES. Seriously, some of the best I've had in a restaurant. Also, the fried onion strings were a little much; I could've used about half of them. The red wine sauce livened up the dish with some tang and echoed the traditional ketchup meatloaf topping. I didn't get a chance to try the boyfriend's gnocchi. (I wasn't about to make him share on his birthday, after all). But, he ate mushrooms. Voluntarily. That's actually a first.  The atmosphere was perfect for talking. There was a low din of noise, but nothing too rowdy. The service was great--I don't think my water glass stayed empty for more than a minute the whole night-- and we got our food pretty quickly.

Decor: Its modern with not a lot of detail. The space is clean and inviting.  Service: Its not bad but its not great either. The server did recommend a wine pairing for my entree (white fish with spicy pepper sauce) but never came back to ask how was it. The wine was good ($10 per glass) but it was pricey and pairing wise not the best choice.  Price: We were two. We split a melon salad, ordered 2 entrees- egg plant parmesan and white fish with pepper sauce, 1 glass of red wine, 1 soda and 1 dessert. Total tab including tax and tip was $85. For the portion size and incomplete plates (see later why I call it incomplete), this is pricey.  Food: The fish was excellent, eggplant was greasy at the bottom. My biggest complaint was the portion size. For $10 salad- it was few morsels. The fish was cooked to perfection (crisp skin and flaky) but there were no sides. It was an incomplete plate for $24. The eggplant parmesan was $17 but was served in an appetizer style in a bowl with lots of marinara. My friend was very confused about how to eat with.They served 4 slices of bread which were never re-filled.  Price: For $85 we left hungry.  In conclusion, if the server were attentive (I think they are understaffed) and if the portion size was better my experience would have been 4 or even 5 stars.

To start, just so it doesn't look like I'm some angry internet person, I would just like to state that my boyfriend and myself are both in the restaurant industry for 7+ years and currently both working in high end restaurants. I live literally down the street and have always wanted to try it out. I saw a groupon and thought why not? I made a reservation and noted that it was a birthday celebration.  When we arrived, there was no host which was fine considering there were only 2 tables sat at the moment so it was a slow early night. When we were sat, it was a bit obvious that our server coined us as ""groupon-ers"". He just seemed so cold toward us the entire evening. He never once went through the menu or offer suggestions on wine. He rarely smiled. Though when I asked what was good he would say which items were but gave no detail. He literally just said the name of the dish and that was it. The food we ordered was amazing and we loved the ambiance of the restaurant so we tried to not care. He would talk more to the guest behind us but maybe it's perhaps they're regulars or friends or ordered better drinks than us. Who knows. When it came to dessert, he just dropped off the menus and walked away. He honestly said not one word. When he came to the table my boyfriend said it was my birthday and ordered. Again, nothing from this guy. Not once did he say happy birthday to me. Not even when he dropped off my dessert. Just dropped it off and walked away. By that time he did have some tables come in so I get it that he was busy but still. For a Michelin recommended place and some what high prices you'd think you'd get better service. When I was about to present my groupon, I asked him to come to our table and all I got was him pointing his finger as to to gesture ""one moment"". He then sent someone over to scan my deal and I thought he would say happy birthday but no. Just a thank you and that was it. Even charged the dessert.  Again, I get it. Most servers do not like groupon users as there are people who can be cheap with it or not tip correctly. But it still does not mean to give lousy service. Maybe he was having a bad day. Again, I get it. But myself and my bf are both doing the same thing every day. At the end, I didn't want to give him a great tip but then that would of only made him think he was right. We gave him $1 less than 20%. I would also include his name but for all I know he might be a great server outside of that day.

The salad was fresh light and delicious; the meatballs were uniquely flavorful; Partner loved his entrée as did I. I had ordered the duck medium and probably should have specified medium-well but it was still excellent. Partner ended the meal with their cherry pie; I with the peach dessert which was sort of a rustic tart with whipped sour cream and crème Englaise.

Service: Awful, but we really couldn't directly blame our waitress.  Management: The worst I've personally experienced in Chicago in 8 years. The manager blamed everything from the waitress (not the waitress' fault) to the ""sudden rush of patrons"" (it was 7:30 on a Friday night; what 3-time ""Bib Gourmand"" awarded restaurant wouldn't anticipate this?) to the fact that we ""should have known"" that our dish would contain numerous sharp, tiny fishbones, etc., etc. Our interaction with her was truly one of a kind.

Another 40 minutes until we received our dishes.  Two minutes until we fully explained the situation to the ""manager"" and finally another astounding 25 minutes until we finally exited this truly awful restaurant still hungry and dedicated to never considering it again.

I almost inhaled my Spaghetti Carbonara, the special of the day, and would have devoured my friend's ricotta gnocchi if she let me. I stuck to an entree and a glass of wine for around $25 total.

2013-02-26,5.0,"After my trip to Ceres' Table last night, I seriously questioned why it had taken me nearly a year to go back. Ceres' hit high marks all across the board in terms of the service, food, and presentation, and I was more than pleased with my entire dining experience. I made a reservation for two at 6pm on a Monday night, which wasn't needed as the restaurant was fairly empty. We were able to pick our table, so we chose a booth near the kitchen and away from the other patrons at the restaurant. We put in our drink orders (Founders Dirty Bastard and a Metropolitan Fly Wheel) and they arrived promptly. The waitress went over their extensive specials that they were offering, which was impressive in addition to the offerings of their regular menu. We put in our order as follows: 1) Calves Liver (Calves liver, polenta, bacon): Wow... just wow. I'm always open to trying new things, but I was a tad bit skeptical about this dish for some reason. I'm so happy I put any unease aside and that we went for it. The liver was incredibly tender and packed with flavor, and the creaminess of the polenta really complimented the dish. There were about four pieces of perfectly crunchy bacon on top of the calves liver that truly sealed the dish for me. When we expressed our enthusiasm about this entree the waitress said it has quite the cult following and that this item typically is always on the menu. This was a *very* dangerous tidbit of information that I learned last night, which probably means I'll be back in the near future. 2) Short Rib Special: short rib, currants, beets, pineapple and apriocot salsa, chickpeas, grain: The short rib was smokey, tender, and succulent. I savored each bite and loved how I didn't need to use my knife to cut the meat at all. Ceres' short rib stands apart from other short ribs I've had in terms of the fattiness of the piece of meat. This had a lot of fat to it (as most short ribs do) but it wasn't chewy or gristly, it just made the meat have a buttery, rich flavor. The short ribs were plated on quite the mix of vegetables and grains--the tangy/tartness of the currants alongside the chickpeas really gave balance to the richness of the short rib. Fantastic!   3) Side of honeyed parsnips and carrots: Since Thanksgiving I've had an obsession with parsnips, and anytime I see them on a menu, I have to get them. Ceres' version had a nice bite to them and they were cooked to a perfect medium, meaning they weren't overdone or mushy. There was just enough honey to make them slightly sweet and the seasoning really brought out each of their unique flavors. 4) Butterscotch & Banana Bread Pudding: I only had a bite of this dessert as I'm not a huge bread pudding fan due to the texture, but it was packed with butterscotch and banana and my dad went silent as he was inhaling the dish. I figure that observation speaks for itself alone. As I mentioned before, the service was fantastic and our waitress checked on us just enough and was incredibly friendly. The chef personally delivered the entrees, which I loved as it really brings together the dining room with the kitchen. It's also worth noting that if you live in the area (ie zipcode 60640) you get 15% off on Monday. We already were planning a Monday dinner before this information was made known, but that's all the more reason to justify a weekday restaurant trip! Ceres' Table, I promise you that only a few months will pass until we meet again... I don't think I can go a whole year again!",0.9972,0.822,0.135,0.043,0.5222004286793019

The portion of my entree was pretty filling, but the portion of my boyfriend's pasta dish looked more like an appetizer/small plate.  For dessert, I had their ""doughnuts"", which, were more like cannolis.  I probably would have been disappointed at this fact, but I had known this was what I was getting since I had seen other diners with the dish.  The ""hot chocolate"" that came as part of the dish made the whole dessert worthwhile, and it was probably my favorite part of the meal.     Still, based on the overall lackluster experience, this is not a place that I feel the need to return to.",0.9678,0.812,0.138,0.05,0.5711904761904762

She could not bother to ask my wife if she wanted a 2nd glass of wine.  She could not look directly at either of us.  She was visibly annoyed that we did not order dessert.  Like snatching the menus from us annoyed.  (And we wanted dessert, but could not stand the idea of giving her any more of our money.) The chef delivered our entrees, which would have been nice, if his mouth had opened.  Seriously, why bother unless you at least say ""Please enjoy!""   The bus boys were by far the high point of their service.  I really only left a tip for them.   The hostess came to check on the table next to us, and asked if they had been there before.  ""Oh, only about 27 times.""  And yet, she did not recognize them?  Odd.   I'd be sad if Anteprima, Ombra and Calo were not just up the street.  But as it is, I'll feel sad that a good chef is being undermined by bad front end staff.  And certainly for the prices, I'd much rather eat a cheaper, equally tasty, well served meal at Anteprima.",-0.5572,0.727,0.138,0.135,0.5777130325814537

The green and red chutneys that it was served with made it more perfect.   The devil is in the details and the pink peppercorn in the soup was a nice touch.  For the entree, I got to try the ricotta gnocchi and the risotto. Both were expertly prepared and with a side of the creamy polenta, I was in culinary heaven.  For the dessert, we got banana bread pudding, the chocolate doughnut and the chocolate fudge.... I hate to sound repetitive, but they were all delicious!!  Our friend got the antipasto and the chicken and he enjoyed it thoroughly too. The icing on the cake, was the seeing Chef Giuseppe Scurato working the front of the house.

When we arrived we were told we would have to wait for our table. It took them one hour to finally get us sat at the table. Again these things happen. The main cause of my annoyance was the attitude of the chef and the hostess who I believe are the owners. Not only did they look down their noses at us but they also blamed us for having such a large group. Why take a reservation for 11 people if you are completely unprepared and unable to accommodate this? And what would the normal way to deal with this? Maybe a free round of drinks? Some discount on the bill? No these guys decided to go with dirty looks and a whole lot of attitude. Unbelievable.

They then poured a cup of rich, tomato-based seafood broth, which was so great at complementing all of the flavors. I practically licked my bowl clean. 2. Confit rabbit leg - just okay. My friend ordered it and I had a bite. The rabbit tastes like chicken, except not as tender and almost gummy. I wouldn't order this. 3. Pasta Cavatelli - just okay. My other friend ordered it and I tried a piece. The pasta texture doesn't feel like pasta, and I don't know how to describe it. The flavors were only okay. I wouldn't order this either.  4. Chocolate souffle with berry coulis - pretty good. It's not the most delicious chocolate-based dessert that I've ever had, but I'd venture to say that it was solid 5. Peach neopolitan - just okay.

They mostly have small plates that are meant for sharing, and I recommend that you do so you can try as much as possible. We started with the arancine. The outside was perfectly crisp/flaky and the inside with white wine risotto and artichokes had a gooey taleggio center. Yum! We also had the lasagna with bolognese sauce, bechamel and parmesan. Perfetto! For the main course, we tried the flavorful grilled becker lake pork tenderloin with potato cake, rapini, slow roasted baby beets and turnips.

We live just a few blocks down Clark, and I can't believe it took us nearly 2 years to get over there. My wife and I went for a romantic date night, and we really liked the atmosphere. We also had high expectations for the food with the recent Michelin nod and all. The food did not disappoint. We weren't enticed by any of the entrees and stuck with small plates instead. We tried 6-8 things and all were delicious. Standouts were the arancini (which were the best I've ever had), the pasta with wild boar ragu, and the grilled octopus. The ""In Bloom"" cocktail is also the perfect girly, light martini.  However, despite my having read about the terrible service and going in with low expectations, we were still disappointed. The hostess and manager (chef's wife?) were very nice, but our waiter was horrid. We did our small plates in 4 courses and after having been there for an hour, we'd still only received one course. The waiter seemed disinterested, and he didn't come to check on us often. Thinking back on it now, he never talked about the food. Never gave any explanations. Never highlighted seasonal ingredients or new dishes. To call it a lackluster experience would be an understatement.  We also saw the manager apologize to another table (with a different waiter) for their food being so delayed.  It's really unfortunate, too. Ceres' has a lot going for it, and we wanted to love it.

The liver was a little bland (though I've never had liver before, so maybe it is supposed to be bland), but the bacon really stole the meal and the polenta was great as well.

Ultimately we decided to only go to Ceres' Table, and it ended up being an awesome decision.  The host at the front offered to hang our coats by the door, and we were seated promptly. Our waitress was over pretty quickly to explain some things on the menu.  I've been salivating over this menu since the reservation was made, so I knew exactly what I wanted. We shared the arancine and gnocchi. The arancine are balls of risotto, peas and goat that are fried to crispy perfection. They are the heightened, fancy version of mac and cheese fritters, and I could've made a meal out of them. The gnocchi were creamy and delicious, and they didn't skimp on the truffle sauce.  For the second course, I knew I wanted the duck leg confit. It was moist, and I hardly needed a knife to cut it. Accompanying the duck were lentils, carrots, black kale, duck sausage, red wine sauce and caramelized apples.  Everything was so good. My friend and I hardly even talked once the entrees came, because we were so focused on eating. Priorities.  I tried a bite of her beef cheek, which was tender and flavorful. Surprisingly, a standout was the brussels sprout side dish. The outsides were crispy, the insides were soft, and the balsamic made them absolutely delicious.  I'm not a huge fan of dessert, but the pear tatin and chocolate creme brûlée were both satisfying and not overly sweet.  We didn't try the cocktails but were told the In Bloom is good.  Their beer menu is on the small side but reasonably priced. The wine list is more extensive, but very few of them are sold by the glass. However on Tuesdays bottles of wine are half price. Very tempting. The decor was nice but nothing too special.

2012-02-18,5.0,"Restaurant Week is upon us. My best friend and I have become restaurant... enthusiasts (more like lot lizards) as part of our new years resolutions, so were originally psyched - until the reality of mediocre prix fixe sets in, and you realize $33 per person can cover a bill almost everywhere without a michelin star. So, in honor of screwing tradition, we decided last minute to cancel all of our reservations in favor of planning a blowout splurge at Maude's Liquor Bar (hopefully the soon to be opened Au Cheval) this week instead. Just because.  Ceres' Table, however, is the one reservation we kept. Very wise. This is one of the smartest menus on restaurant week, because they let you create your 3 courses out of anything on the main menu vs a bunch of meh choices. For $33 each, we got gorgonzola truffle gnocchi, crispy fried balls of arborio rice/braised goat/taleggio cheese/peas, roasted duck leg confit with duck sausage, braised waygu beef cheek with eggplant parmigiana, pear tatin, and chocolate creme brulee (a chocolate mousse-pudding with sugar crust). Every single thing we got was fantastic. The risotto balls were creamy, salty, and super flavorful. Super tender beef cheek. We added parmesan roasted brussel sprouts with balsamic glaze to round it out. Rustic, good portions, fantastic flavors on everything. The more restaurants you try the tougher it is for anything to rise to the top. My friend and I were distracted enough by the food that we shut up for a full 30 minutes, so that's definitely something. The ambience is cool and weird, a small and austerely well-decorated minimalist bistro in a quiet part of town. It was crowded but not packed, and fast service. They do a $40 (this includes wine) prix fixe every Wednesday that sounds intriguing, though this place is probably out of the way for most. Bonus points: if you are ever concerned about getting your car towed, be sure to leave a note on the dash to please tow to the Lincoln Towing company next door.

Everything I had was excellent and judging from the satisfied faces on my friends, they would agree.  The best thing I ate was something I didn't even order...the chocolate banana bread pudding. OMG to die for! The carrot cake on my plate was superb, but just a notch below the bread pudding. Oh, dinner? Thumbs way up on the poached pear salad + pumpkin ravioli.

I can't do my usual food ranking system, because all 3 dishes were fantastic.  However, if forced, I would say the scallops win the night!  We started with the smaller (3 scallop, 4 ravioli pieces) portion.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the cioppiono sauce was excellent and the ravioli-type pasta that accompanied it was the perfect  finish.  I kind of wish I had ordered the larger portion as an entree, it was that good.  Next were the braised short ribs.  It looks like a small portion with only 3 perfectly braised, melt in your mouth short ribs, but they are accompanied by a delicious white truffle pasta with wild mushrooms.  I have to admit the truffle pasta didn't quite live up to Gilt's, but honestly, whose could?  My friend had the pan roasted duck breast which was perfectly moist.  Duck is tricky and many restaurants dry it out, but this was really delicious.  It also came with duck sausage, which is as good as it sounds! Never one to turn down a cocktail, I can also recommend the In Bloom (Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, prosecco and hibiscus flower).  Delicious!

Naturally, we didn't want to drop down $$$$, so we turned to the Bib Gourmand section. Lo and behold, Ceres' Table popped out. So with our trusty smartphones, we Yelp'd it and saw some great reviews (some by some friends!). What could go wrong? Not much, that's what. Ceres' Table is a very modern and contemporary restaurant. The teal-ish walls and restaurant name are bold, with very dim lighting highlighting various parts of the restaurant. Booths, bar stools, square tables, and tallboys fill the quaint space. I definitely felt underdressed. It says casual, but it's probably best to look presentable. Think ""just got outta work and I'm going to have a drink and dinner with some coworkers."" The food was definitely on point. I ordered the barramundi, a sea bass served with artichokes, carrots, onions, and a citrus-wine sauce. Eloquently plated. Exquisite taste. Part of my reduction of stars has to do with portions. I wish we would have ordered more, though that would have gone out of the Bib Gourmand-ness of our meal...and I wasn't about to dish out another $20ish for some more grub. The most interesting part of the night definitely had to be when the owner (Carolyn?) came to our table near the end of our meal to ask how things were. Normally that would be fine and dandy, but she just popped out of nowhere and before saying ""hello"" she jumps into our conversation saying ""This is my restaurant!"" It was definitely a conversation stopper. I mean, what do you say to that? ""No, it's actually that gal's restaurant. She stopped over a few minutes before you did."" Interesting meal, to say the least. I'd be open to head back to Ceres' Table to see how their menu changes as the seasons change. Until Next time, Ceres.",0.988,0.862,0.122,0.016,0.46322712418300654

The restaurant is a little bit in bumble, but there is parking everywhere. We got one right outside of the restaurant. The place is nice inside but nothing spectacular. That being said, I did prefer the décor to other overstated restaurants. First off, one thing I didn't care for was the bread. I had heard/read such great things about it (and it really was warm and good - sourdough), but it is their policy to not bring out bread until you put in your food order. As an extremely slow orderer (I like to order my wine, take my time, etc.), my tummy was rumbling for a good portion of the beginning of the meal.  Second off, the food generally had muted flavor and was EXTREMELY rich. We started off with two appetizers:  (1) the braised baby octopus with capers, olives, oregano, white wine, and tomato sauce (not enough flavor and too much green olive), and (2) roasted portabella mushroom salad with radicchio, watercress, black truffle sauce (didn't taste it at all), pumpkin seed pesto, and pecorino sardo (best dish of the night but a tad overdressed for my taste; it is a full portabella at the bottom that you need to cut). For entrees I got the day boat scallops with lobster and crab stuffed aglonotti, grilled young onions (the highlight), carrots, cioppino sauce (WAY too much butter; didn't really taste like cioppino; felt ""icky"" after). My boyfriend got the chicken cacciatora with roasted amish chicken breast, chickpea puree, whole black olives, bell pepper peronata, and mushrooms (somehow even with these ingredients he still said only ok and bland). For a side we got the balsamic roasted brussel sprouts of the night (addictively good but too much oil). The redeeming part of the night was when the adorable chef/owner came to our table to see how everything was.",0.9927,0.861,0.13,0.01,0.5161011904761905

The pumpkin ravioli (in appetizer or dinner portions) is simply amazing.  I had the duck breast during our last visit and it melted in my mouth.  The flavors of the duck breast matched perfectly with the kale, mushrooms and duck sausage.  The seasonally changing menu also offers a good variety of fish entrees, which are also fresh.  We generally have some nice wines by the glass or bottle.  They have a dolcetto, which is tremendous and reasonably priced.

I should note that the restaurant decor is very nice and open and airy.  I can see how noise levels can get very loud because of the big open space.  There is a nice little bar area where you could have a drink as well.  As much as I wanted this experience to be enjoyable, I just do not think that I will try again with the prices that this place charges for the overall experience.",0.9923,0.797,0.146,0.058,0.4995299145299146

Upon first visiting, I have returned several times for different occasions - to celebrate a birthday, to get some late (by my old lady standards of 9pm) dinner, to get dessert. Ceres' Table has been consistently great each and every time. I had my first arancini here. The ""In Bloom"" cocktail is spectacular. It is a sometimes forgotten special place for me. So, when I saw them tweeting about their new fall menu with pumpkin ravioli, braised short ribs, and boar ragu lasagna, I immediately came in for dinner. And it was GLORIOUS.  First of all, I hadn't been in since the spring, and our server remembered us! Mega bonus points! Second, the owner was in the house talking to all the tables. I gushed about the fall menu and she seemed happy that people were paying attention online and that we were enjoying ourselves. Bonus points for caring! Then there was the food...  * Grilled Sardines - One of my favorite little fish! * Arancini - Formerly made with braised oxtail and fontina (and not available in the spring - I may have cried). Now, revamped and filled with braised goat and tallegio cheese. I kid you not. These little fried balls are HEAVEN. * Wild Mushroom Risotto - Perfectly cooked. So earthy and warming.  * Boar Ragu Lasagna - The dish that drew me in. I am a little picky about lasagna (many of them are too cheesy and too firm). This version is perfect - soft noodles, not too much cheese, BOAR RAGU. I mean, this simply isn't fair.  * Truffled Corn - The vegetable side dish of the day and one of the best things I have eaten all year. Freshly shucked sweet corn + butter + truffle = me pulling my hair out and shamelessly licking the ramekin (and then contemplating ordering one for dessert).  * Truffle Pecan Cake - warm, not to sweet. In my mind, a 5-star dessert. Wash that all down with a house-made hibiscus soda, and I was in fat kid heaven. It was such a perfect meal - great service, great food, great drink - but at the same time, so low-key, understated, and effortless.

There are a lot of restaurants that have great menus but the food just does not follow through. Ceres' was great when I went. Shrimp crudo, pan fried cheese, veal stew, pappardelle, and cocktails were all very good. Service was good and I recommended it to a friend. My friend went and had the opposite experience. Amatrichiana herbs' were too strong and pasta was poorly cooked. One of their cocktails had too much alcohol and instead of the drink being remixed, more soda was just poured in.  Seems like most people have been having the same issue, just inconsistencies. I personally will return to give it another chance but my friend will not.

2011-08-17,2.0,"One of our favorite meals from last year was Ceres' Table, where we had a three course meal for $25. Every dish was fantastic and we recommended it to anyone that would listen. Since we liked it so much we didn't understand how it took us a year and half to return. This time the three course prix fixe is $40 including a glass of wine and only offered on Wednesdays (I guess the first deal really was too good to be true). Unfortunately something happened between our two visits because they could not have been more different. Each dish that came out was very disappointing and not very tasty. It's hard to believe that there could be such a huge variation in experiences. Either one of our experiences was a fluke, or something has changed inside the kitchen. Either way we were bummed to find one of our favorite meals from last year is not the same today. What went wrong? We started with soft shell crabs and ravioli. The crab was more or less an accident but still nothing I would want to try again. The ravioli with shrimp was ok, with the shrimp and sauce being pretty good but the goat cheese filling was way too strong.    Our main course was sirloin and trout filet. The meat was cooked medium rare but tasted and cut rare. The trout was ok but a little salty and overdone. One of the highlights from before was the dessert. They were probably the best part of the meal but still lacking something. The peach crisp with vanilla was nice and appropriately sized. We again tried the molten chocolate cake but it was missing the soft, moist cake to go with the fudge in the middle. I really hope we just had a supper off night. Our first meal was so good that I want to believe our second trip was the outlier. The problem is that we might not get back anytime soon to asses so please leave comments and keep me updated which will give me hope to return sooner rather than never.",0.991,0.795,0.147,0.057,0.5083687943262412

Minus one: I have not waited to 45 minutes after my reservation time anyplace in years. We received little acknowledgment, less apology, and zero consolation. Even worse, the host sat a table that came in after us, which he admitted was a mistake. Chef's don't always know how to manage the front of house.

My friends gave it 3 stars because they enjoyed their meal. I certainly didn't and it was a 2 star for me. I was really hungry, so I ordered a $20  pasta dish that look like fussili. I thought my dish would fill me up, but when I received my order  I was dismayed by the size of it.  It looked more like a small appetizer dish than an entree. (see picture).  I should have ordered a salad with it, so yeah I was really disappointed.   I think their portion are just way too tiny and pricey for a simple Italian food. I've been to other high end places, but I think this eatery is trying a little too hard to be upscale. Sorry, but it failed. Ambiance was a little stark and it's right across from a cemetery which is bad feng shui!  Not a good place to take someone on a date. Not romantic unless of course you're breaking up with that person.  We were also seated at one of the high top tables which I found very uncomfortable.

2011-03-18,4.0,"I'm not sure why I waited so long to sit at Ceres' Table. The reviews have always been good; the menu (I've longingly skimmed it several times on their website) is a ""what's what"" of traditional dishes with modernist touches; the cocktail list is in line with the flourish-friendly drinks at In Fine Spirits and other far-north side establishments. I think my mind said, location + price = wait. Who would think to spend more than $20 on a main at a restaurant in what I might call, in a more dismissive mood, the middle of nowhere? Fortunately for me and my penny-pinching pal Aaron, Ceres' table offers a generous three-course-plus-wine prix-fixe on Wednesdays. The entire menu is at your disposal. From a business standpoint, I have to admire their addition of the wine; for the nominal cost of a lower-ranked wine pour, they capture $5-10 more than a prix fixe at any other restaurant in Chicago. Brilliant. Also: I totally took the bait. And so did the trout I feasted upon for my entrée. It was indeed a feast for the eyes first -- a skin-on fillet of fish luxuriantly stretched out over a bed of beautiful mushrooms and a glaze that would have reflected the moonlight had we been sitting closer to the window. Before that, I enjoyed the maybe-too-safe carpaccio, topped with an unsurprising array of oil and arugula.  The dessert caught me quite by surprise. I have been a peanut butter lover for more than two decades, and by choosing the peanut butter tart I was not expecting to learn something new about that nutty spread. But lo and behold -- this circle of cookie crust-buttressed peanut butter crème is outstanding. With the delicate peanut brittle on top, held in place by (unnecessary) chocolate morsels, this dessert may not be terribly Italian, but it is terribly delicious. I sampled Aaron's beet salad with relish, though one bite was not enough to push me over the edge. The same goes for the profiterole. The ice cream was good, and the profiterole was competently created, but it was no match for the true divo at the table -- that peanut butter tart. Like a good patron, I will attempt to revisit on a night that offers less of a ""steal"" to the consumer and pays the chefs and owner back for their generosity.

I live in Edgewater and have been meaning to go here for a while and Phil Vittel's review finally nudged me there. In fact, I kind of ordered and observed based on the review.  I don't have any real negatives to observe. I loved the free parking after 6 PM. I thought the atmosphere was actually more charming/welcoming than Vittel's review indicated.  The arancini were delicious and I'm glad I was engaged in some active conversation that forced me to eat slowly or else I probably would have wished there was more (make sure you use your bread to enjoy the leftover sauce). Based on Vittel's review I had the seared trout with short-rib-stuffed agnolotti over a cabernet reduction and per the review the agnolotti were just little delights, little explosions of meaty buttery wonderfulness.  My companion had the goat cheese stuffed ravioli and it was tasty but I was glad I got the trout since it was so good. We ordered the apple strudel which had a nice pastry crust and the chocolate souffle tart which was deliciously chocolatey but not too heavy. I typically don't enjoy orange and citrus combinations but the tangerine compote was an excellent companion. The owner came by after our meal to check in on us which I thought was a nice touch. It was a really nice dinner and I think for how much we ordered (appetizer, two entrees, bottle of wine, 2 desserts), a $100 bill was pretty reasonable.  I think Ceres Table is a great spot for the neighborhood and the attention is well-deserved.

2011-03-10,3.0,"It kills me that I can't give Ceres' Table more stars.  I have been rooting for it to survive in its less than ideal location and I've been looking forward to going there for ages.  Unfortunately, the experience just didn't jive with the price point.   I went with a friend to take advantage of the Wednesday prix fixe deal.  I'd made reservations via Open Table, which was a snap.  When I arrived I found the restaurant fairly crowded, so I was glad for the reservations.  We were seated at one of the high top tables.  I hate tables like this.  They're uncomfortable and awkward - they also seem very out of place at a restaurant charging $20-$30 for entrees, I think of them as being more the dominion of sports bars.  The other atmospheric problem was that Ceres' Table is, as has been mentioned in other reviews, very loud.  I had to keep asking my dining companion to repeat himself.   The $35 prix fixe deal includes one glass of house wine and your choice of any appetizer, entree, and dessert.  This may or may not be a good deal depending on which items you're interested in.  In my case, it only saved me $3 on the food plus the glass of wine (which was okay, but had I not been getting the prix fixe I'd definitely have opted for something different).  I gather from old reviews the prix fixe used to be $25, THAT would have been an amazing deal.  I started with the arancini which was very good and a pretty sizable portion (3 meatball sized arancinis).  I was debating between the trout and the flat iron steak for my entree - I asked the waiter to help me pick but he told me they were both good.  I went with the trout and I'm thinking I should have gone the other direction.  The wild mushrooms served with it were excellent, but the fish itself was merely good.  My dinner partner did report that his pork chop (the special of the evening) was fantastic.  For dessert I went with the profiteroles, which were actually pretty dismal - there was something decidedly off about the taste.   Overall Ceres' Table certainly isn't bad, in fact, it's good.  I don't think it's $50 per person for dinner good, though, which makes me sad.",0.9695,0.772,0.139,0.089,0.6303514739229026

2011-02-18,4.0,"I was quite pleased with my dining experience at Ceres' Table on Valentine's. Named after the ancient Roman goddess of agriculture, Ceres' specializes in modern, Sicilian-inspired American fare set against a minimalist backdrop. Focusing on local and seasonal products, the menu caters to a range of tastes, appetites, and budgets. To start, a half of a crusty french roll came with a cold, unspreadable slab of butter straight out of the fridge -- a slight annoyance that was quickly forgotten once the dishes rolled out. The arancini appetizer satisfied my initial hunger with three fried medium-sized balls of risotto, oxtail, and cheese over a thick dabs of tomato sauce and arugula. Scallops, a perennial favorite of mine, didn't disappoint with two large mollusks set atop risotto, leeks, and crawfish sprinkled with herbs. Another veritable favorite: goat cheese. On a salad, mixed in pasta, spread over a sandwich -- I can't get enough. Much to my delight, Ceres' offered a tasty goat cheese ravioli with succulent lamb, creamy melted feta cheese, and red wine sauce. But priced at $19, it was a bit expensive for the portion size. The chocolate souffle tart with peace compote and spicy pecans oozed with yummy chocolate, but the warm chocolate chip cookie was the real dessert winner. Warm to the core, the cookie was topped by a single scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate sauce. All the desserts were quite reasonably priced at $5 each. A very minimalist motif of dark wood tabletops contrasted by white tablecloths and azure blue walls leaves you focusing on the food and service. Co-owner and hostess Carolyn Gordon was quick to greet and hang our coats at the door. And our server never missed a beat.

We started with pasta e fagioli which was a combination of white beans, bacon, rigatoni and some tomatoes. It was very good although we were expecting it to be an appetizer dish than a broth. I wish our waiter should have told us beforehand because I think we could have ordered something else.  Our main meals were chicken caciattore which is a deconstructed chicken thighs and the pasta special for the night. Both meals were delicious and well seasoned. For dessert, we just shared the special for the  night.  About the wine selection, it was pretty impressive. There is a variety of selection to choose from and are reasonably priced. Our waiter started slow during the first few minutes but got better in the middle of the whole dining experience. Our hostess even came to our table and chatted with us about our dining experience.

Ceres' Table isn't in the best location -- on a kind of gritty stretch of Clark Street next to a towing company and across from a cemetery. But if that location helps them keep the prices this affordable, I can tolerate the neighbors. We stopped in on a Wednesday, which is prix fixe night. The special gets you three courses (that would normally add up to $40+) for $30. You can add a glass of wine for an extra $5. The oysters were wonderfully fresh and briny... the chicken cacciatore was unique in presentation, but familiar in flavor... and the desserts were decadent without pushing into the realm of TGIFriday-size insanity. The flat-iron steak was a little tough for my liking, but was cooked to a nice medium rare. Service was prompt and friendly... the room had good energy from a nice weeknight crowd... and the wine list had a nice mix of affordable options amidst some pricier Italian wines.

Beyond this epiphany, I also commend the restaurant on their service.  As soon as we checked in, Mrs. Scurato, the proprietress, immediately told us that they are running behind, and we should help ourselves to any drink at the bar on the house.  We were seated maybe a little over a half hour after our reservation time.  No big deal at all during Saturday night prime time.  Our waitress, while also serving 2 huge groups around us, never made us felt left out.  She managed to be efficient and witty to a group of 3, or 10.  Chef was at the front desk while we were leaving, and we gave him our appreciation for a wonderful experience.  While we were still at the curb, Mrs Scurato came outside, and thanked us profusely for coming.

2011-01-18,4.0,"We tried Ceres table last night as part of ""Operation Use the 2011 A La Card Deck to Death"" and I have to say it was a fine beginning to the year in that regard. We had a reservation for 5:45 so the room was almost empty when we arrived.  Parking was a breeze, and I could see my car from my seat as we were parked right in front of the restaurant.  Between the not very large crowd and the installation recently of new sound absorbing tiles we had none of the noise issues that others have mentioned regarding previous visits. There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, but he was doing a good job of keeping up with all the tables as well as working the bar.  I hope that at busier times they do not try to get by being understaffed, but with a few backservers helping out, things went pretty smoothly during our meal. We decided to go for a few small dishes and split a main course.  And here again I didn't find us dealing with an oft-mentioned problem, that being too-small portions. The Beef Carpaccio ($10) was a reasonably sized serving of thinly sliced beef with cheese, greens, and a bit of truffle oil.  The beef was flavorful with the cheese and oil as a nice complement to the meat.   Arancini ($9) was an excellent dish for my money.  Three nice sized fried risotto balls filled with braised oxtail, fontina cheese.  The oxtail was tender and the risotto slightly creamy under the crunchy outer shell.  Very happy with this dish. I only barely tried the scallops ($14) but I didn't think the dish was out of line from what most other places would charge for this plate.  With crawfish, orzo, greens, and a couple good sized scallops.  The review of the scallops from across the table was ""nom.  nom nom nom.  And nom.""  So there ya go. We split the 12 oz. Bison ribeye steak ($28).  This was the highlight of the meal.  The bison was juicy and full of meaty flavor.  The sauce was slightly spicy without overpowering the meat in any way.  The parmesan potato rosti was an interesting textural contrast  to the hearty steak.  This was one of the best meat dishes I have had in a while, and what for me pushed this up to a 4-star meal.  Worth every penny. For desserts we tried the chocolate chip cookie and the pistachio creme brulee ($5 each). The cookie was warm and tasty with chocolate ice cream.  The creme brulee was a treat, really strong of pistachio flavor in a good way.  The desserts may have been a touch small, but nothing that made me want to flip the table over and begin bellowing ""Shenanigans!"" in the middle of the restaurant. So overall, a good experience at Ceres' Table.  Nothing to complain about, and a few things to really be excited about.",0.9971,0.831,0.149,0.02,0.5122947422947425

2010-12-04,2.0,"I am glad to welcome a new(er) restaurant to the Andersonville neighborhood. This part of Clark street is particularly dead (pun intended) and it is nice to see new businesses coming in. Basic summary:  - Waiter was indifferent. Had to flag him down several times. He never made conversation, never asked how our food was, and never offered to get us additional drinks or anything for that matter. He was too busy chatting it up with what appeared to be the owner's wife at the bar.  - Food was meh. The quality was fine, tasted good and was presented well, but the portion size was, IMO, very small. My $24 trout contained as much fish as a 1/3 can of tuna (less than what you would find on a smoked trout sandwich). When my plate was scraped clean, I was still hungry and sad rather than full and happy.  -Desert was good, best part of the meal in terms of flavor, price and portion size.  -We were seated very quickly which is a plus. But it took forever to get the waiter to ask us if we would like a drink (15min?) it then took equally as long for him to bring the drinks. When he finally got around to bringing the drinks, he took our food order. Food arrived within roughly 8-10 min suspiciously fast. This doesn't sound bad, but it really killed the pace of the night. We sat at the table for nearly 25 min with no food, no drink and no waiter. Then the drinks and food came out all at once. Due to the super small portions we were done and ready for desert moments after receiving the food.  Overall Summary: A small dinner for 2 which left us both hungry and with a $70 tab to boot. The restaurant attempts to be higher end by offering high prices and small portions rather than a quality dining experience. Just because you serve me half a meal doesn't mean you should charge me twice as much. My advice: drop your prices by 10-15% and increase your portions by the same margin. Also, please instruct your wait staff that a high(er) end dining experience should be accompanied by higher end service and not a drive by 'throw the menus at us' waiter.",0.963,0.806,0.122,0.073,0.46551365932047745

The food is exceptional.  When he first opened up there was a lamb dish that was incredible and it disappeared.  Although I missed it very much, I realized it was not a good idea to get too attached to items on the menu as Giuseppe keeps the menu lively by changing it on a pretty regular basis.  So far there has been something on there that has soon become a new favorite.  He also has liver on the menu (of which I am not a fan of) but my little girl orders it every time we take her.  I reluctantly had a bite of hers as she wanted me to try it, and to my surprise it was very nice. Desserts are just right...not too big or sweet, just enough to hit the spot.  And the pastry chef is pretty creative as well when it comes to switching up the menu.  I tend not to eat desserts much, but have gotten one every time we have eaten there.

Then we continued on to the entrees.  I had the 12 oz. BISON RIBEYE with portobello mushrooms, scallion ragu and parmesan potato rosti.  As with bison versus beef, the meat was very tender with tons of flavor due to the fattiness.  It was cooked to perfection with juices for dipping, yet not an overwhelming quantity for the plate or palate.  I must say, however, that the potato rosti/cakes were not all the impressive and were on the bland side.  My friend ordered our second choice, the Gunthrop Farm RABBIT LEG with sweet potato gnocchi, cabbage, rabbit confit, sherry wine vinegar and thyme sauce.  Yet again, the dish was very light and moist with plenty of flavor for a white ""chicken-like"" meat.  We both enjoyed our entrees.   We had to satisfy our sweet teeth and ordered the Chocolate Souffle for dessert.  It was nothing spectacular and is another take on chocolate lava cake, however, it did finish off our meal right. I was extremely pleased with the meal, the prices (super reasonable at ~$10 an appetizer and ~$20-25 an entree without skimping on the portions or quality), service (the hostess stopped by to see how our meal was towards the end--a plus!) and I even received good feedback from my foodie friend!  I now proclaim that Ceres Table is not only the goddess of harvest, but Chicago's New American dining scene!",0.9981,0.827,0.15,0.023,0.6738832001332

But things happen, and for one reason or another I never made it there. Until this past weekend. I'm a fool for waiting. I had it in my mind that Ceres was fairly pricey, and it's really not. Appetizers are around 10 bucks, entrees 20-25. Reasonable for what you get, which is seasonal, local when possible (there's not much cod in Lake Michigan), and creatively prepared. And delicious. Can't forget delicious. The menu is fairly simple, but everything on it is tempting. I went with the pheasant, my dining companion had the liver. Yes, liver, and it was excellent. You think ""pheasant,"" you think one of two things: foofy (as in, ""under glass"") or gamey. This pheasant was neither. It had crispy skin, moist flesh, and was served on a bed of eggplant caponata, which is midway between a stew and a relish. It's the tip of the hat to Sicily in this preparation, and complemented the meat nicely. I started with the heirloom tomato salad, which is what you would expect it to be (but very good). My companion had the soup, which I want to say was a cream of fava beans, and which he was mad for. I was talking too much to try it, and now I regret it. The atmosphere is relaxed. I was in shorts, my friend wore a t-shirt, and neither of us felt out of place. The service was good, but not outstanding. However, both the chef and his wife stopped by the table during our meal, which was nice. The saddest thing about our meal was that we ate at 8 o'clock on a Friday night, and the place was nowhere near full. The location is a little out of the way, and Clark Street was torn up for construction for a lot of the summer, so I'm hoping the slowdown is temporary. This restaurant really deserves to succeed.

So it was with anticipation that I returned to the now-transitioned area to enjoy a restaurant poised on the brink of national acclaim. We visited  on a pleasant Monday evening, which allowed an unhurried staff to truly showcase their talents. The decor is intentionally quite spare, with the exception of a multicolor mosaic on the floor of the entryway. Unusual. We were offered our choice of seating. We took the semi-enclosed booth by the door; it was fine. We tried the In Bloom and Watermelon Margarita cocktails. Both were imaginative and nicely prepared; the margarita was sweeter than I had expected.  A mildly sourdough bread was served with a sweet butter, very tasty. For appetizers, we ordered gnocchi, arancini, and the baby spinach salad. I am not a fan of gnocchi, but I am assured that these were quite good. The arancini were exceptional. The waiter saw us sharing the dishes, and proactively delivered the salad on individual plates, a nice touch. We wiped up all the sauces with the sourdough, which got replenished as we devoured it. I had not had expertly prepared calf's liver in years--typically it is overcooked and over-onioned. But the waiter steered me into the (for me, equally unfamiliar) pheasant. Turned out to be a great choice: perfectly crisped skin, plenty of meat, cooked yet moist. The steak entree was also quite tasty, cooked as ordered, and served up pre-sliced. The day boat scallops were something special: moist, tasty, and nicely arranged on the platter.  Desserts. We couldn't decide, so we just said ""Bring one of each"".

2010-07-20,2.0,"Other reviews boast of Ceres' Table as a hidden gem, I found it a cubic zirconia rather than a diamond. The dishes included a few fresh ingredients that elevated the flavors, but overall, the taste was lacking.  Here's the line-up: goat cheese ravioli - With this dish, I enjoyed the light, tomato water broth and the ripe, cherry tomatoes. The ravioli did not meet my pasta expectations, as spoiled by Terragusto.(not solicited) beef tartare - As with firsts of many sorts, I cannot judge the experience but can only say, 'thank you'. With trepidation and tentative bites, I ate past my raw beef and raw egg virginity. I may not return to the dish but I am happy to have tried it. fettuccine - when a dish is labeled ""fettuccine"", the pasta better be delicious, unfortunately, it wasn't. The mushrooms had a wonderful flavor but the asparagus was overcooked and pale. If the dish was $10, I would expect 'ok' pasta, when it's $17, I expect homemade, perfect pasta. chocolate souffle - The gooey, chocolatey middle oozed delightfully out of the center, texture was spot on. The cherry sauce was enjoyable but if tart cherries were used, it would have brought it to four-star level.",0.9922,0.788,0.198,0.014,0.5525587606837606

But I'm undecided on my entree, the Goat Cheese Ravioli with Rock Shrimp & Tomato Water.  The tomato water was a light, flavorful broth that was great on its own, and the few shrimp were tasty.  However, the ravioli was really, really heavy on the goat cheese...I was expecting maybe some herbs or other flavors to cut all that sharp, mushy cheesiness?  I couldn't even finish it, I got so goat-cheesed- out (this coming from someone who LOVES the stuff :P) For dessert, I had an adorable little warm apricot tart, which more or less tasted like apricot preserves, but really good ones.   I'd definitely go back to try out more of their dishes -- would be great to see some more variety on their menu, as well.",0.9955,0.722,0.256,0.022,0.6018115942028984

2010-06-13,5.0,"Yep, I think I have a new favorite restaurant in Chicago. After wondering if Ceres' Table could possibly live up to the hype in my head, the service and food put all doubts to rest and put the rest of Chicago's 'hip' dining scene on notice: you're about to be served!  I arrived before the rest of my party, so the hostess showed me to the bar to cool my heels and get a drink. Not learning my lesson from so many bad evenings beforehand, I started with beer (""beer before liquor...""). But, I couldn't help myself. The Two Brothers Country Ale was begging to be mileage on the spare tire around my waist. I had to comply. As I sipped my frosty beverage (served by a friendly barkeep), the rest of my party arrived and we sat. We were seated in the middle of the room which gave my ample opportunity to study the black & white/simple motif. I dug it. Why? Because when you do food well, why put forth a dog and pony show with your decor? Keep it simple and the focus on the food. The food. Wow. Even though I'd missed on the prix fixe deal from earlier in the year, I was committed to having three courses (spare.tire). Luckily, my friends like to eat as much as I do. For apps, we shared the crab cake, goat cheese ravioli and pate. I don't like pate and I ate the h#ll out of this. The crustini was crunchy but not ""Ow, my mouth is bleeding"" crunchy. The pate was seasoned. The sweet pickles were scrumptious... and this is the app I wasn't excited about (initially). The goat cheese ravioli was a revelation: shrimp, tomatoes, basil and GOAT CHEESE RAVIOLI. Yes. Hit me baby, one more time. Really. Do it. Because that crab cake was not kidding around and I needed to wake from my reverie. Healthy portions of lump crab were served with spicy peppers and tomato to make an app generous enough for three to share and signature enough for me to claim. For myself. Don't forget who I am. One glass of red wine later and I was ready for my meal. Doing my Yelp homework, I settled on the octopus spaghetti. Sounds basic, right? It's not. Copious amounts of octopus are hidden within mounds of thin-cut spaghetti. Basil and olive oil help is all go down easily while the capers and olives remind one that this dish is all-Mediterranean -- a love-letter to the ocean. My friends ordered the scallops and steak and were equally happy with their plates. All the while, our waiter asked us how we were, if we needed new beverages, what beverages would pair best with our food, etc. He wasn't obnoxious and he didn't hover. He was just... helpful. Good show. Not to be outdone, the hostess came by our table to ask how everything was, how we heard of the restaurant, etc. She seemed genuinely interested in our time at her establishment and that's to be appreciated. I think she liked our answer, as we soon got flutes of limoncello to top off our meal. Oh, everyone around us did as well? I'm going to pretend it was just me. I couldn't possibly eat more, right? These jelly rolls don't fill themselves, honey! It's dessert time. Someone might have gotten bread pudding. Someone else might have had the terrine. Who knows? It was all background noise to the strawberry rhubarb extravaganza in front of me. The idea of rhubarb grosses me out. Veggies are not dessert. However, when paired with luscious strawberry, cooked in its own juices and topped with crunchy sweet oats and vanilla gelato... ? Done. Too.F'ing.Done (in a good way; a later review is coming where I am TFD in a BAD way; you'll note the difference). To top it off, we had *another* shot of limoncello! If this is how they do it in Italy, no wonder Marlon Brando said, ""F my sexy; pass the seafood!"" I'm on my way. Recap: believe the hype. Believe everything.

The server approached and was very pleasant, asked for our drink order and let us know the only addition to the menu that evening was a soup. We each ordered an appetizer, I had the beef tartar and my partner had the crab cake.  Both were prepared very well and the portion size was plentiful.  For our entrees I had the Bay Boat Scallops and he had the steak.  Both were cooked perfectly and very enjoyable.

2010-04-19,2.0,"We went to Ceres' last Saturday night. First off, let me say that this rating has nothing to do with the food. The food is fantastic. The waiter was fantastic as well. I hvae no complaints on the waiter's attentiveness nor the food. I ordered the lamb special and my boyfriend got the spaghetti with baby octupus. Delicious! The banana chocolate bread pudding was tasty as well. My complaint stems from our arrival and departure experience at the restaurant. Our reservation was for 7 PM. We arrived on time and learned that our table was still occupied by two customers and we'd have to wait at the bar with a drink until they decided to finish their wine and leave. Not a big deal, but unfortunately we had to wait 45 minutes for our table to open up. Meanwhile, there were at least 5 tables empty, although they were for parties of 4 or more. I understand they were for other reservations, but why didn't this restaurant have a back up table for instances like this? If not that as an alternative, why didn't they offer to comp us a drink or a dessert or appetizer? The reason I'm complaining is because we had to wait 45 MINUTES to get our table. We didn't sit until 7:45 for a 7 PM reservation. Luckily we didn't have tickets to a play or something. I was livid, and it completely set a negative tone for our entire dinner. We barely got an apology. We did hear a meager ""thanks for being patient"" but no offer to comp an appetizer or dessert for our inconvenience. What was the point of the reservation!? Soon after we had a tasty appetizer and main course and dessert. I was letting go of my experience from earlier. They had almost redeemed themselves.  Then when we went to leave, my boyfriend went to the restroom. I went to the front of the restaurant and waited for him. His coat was still at the table. A random waiter came up to me with his jacket and abruptly said, ""Is this yours?"" And I said, no, it's my boyfriend's, he is in the bathroom but he'll be here in 2 minutes to get it.  Then he quickly replied ""Would you take it? Thanks."" and then he flung it at me and quickly ran off.  The hostess could have taken it or he could've offered to hang it until my boyfriend came up. Needless to say, my boyfriend came out seconds later and the table didn't have new people sitting at it so it wasn't an urgent situation to seat new people. I left just about as angry as I was after we arrived.  I wasn't too impressed with the ambiance either. They went too far with the 'modern' look. Stark gray warehouse floors and no tapestries whatsoever made for too cold and not cozy enough atmosphere. The store front windows felt like just that, like a retail store with no goods to sell. Very gray and drab.  I'm a resident of Andersonville and I'm glad this new restaurant went in. I just hope they fix these issues and make it better quick. Bottom line: Great food and waiters.

2010-04-18,3.0,"I'm really torn about this review. We had a GREAT experience at Ceres, but something happened at the bar that rubbed me the wrong way. We got there early and decided to have a drink at the bar. They had a cocktail with gin. One problem- I don't do gin. It makes me want to vomit just thinking about it. So I politely ask the bar tender if she could switch it out with vodka. Simple request right? I get a frank NO.. it ruins the ""integrity of the drink"". Excuse me? No you will not sub it out for vodka? Am I at Whistler or Violet Hour? NO I am at a restaurant with 5 drinks on a list- one of which is a dessert martini. Out of principle I was not going to give her my money and order something else. Who is the customer here? A simple.. we really suggest drinking the cocktails as they are, we can sub out gin for vodka but the flavors may be off. The whole experience was just weird and a first encounter for me. That being said- Food: Phenomenal, we ordered the arancini and the ravioli as an app,  we also got a salad to split between the table. They actually split it out between 4 plates and brought it out to each of us. Then for the main courses we tried the steak, quail and sea bass. The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. For dessert we shared the creme brulee and the lemon dessert that they were offering. Service: Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing he made some great suggestions and the staff was always around to pour wine and water.  Ambiance: it was a little bright for me but over all very nice and welcoming.  I would definitely go back, but get a drink somewhere else until I work gin back into my diet. They also have a semi BYO policy. If you buy a bottle they waive the corkage fee.

2010-04-07,2.0,"Eh, I think this place tries too hard. It feels trendy and is, but it lacks something desirable in a dining experience. Maybe it feels too uptight for me. Let me explain. I went here with a large group of friends to a celebrate a birthday on a Saturday evening. We had 8:00 pm reservations, which was smart, as the restaurant was almost completely full. After taking our coats and handing us coat check tags, the hostess sat us in the table set and waiting for us.  The older waiter greeted us and handed us menus. We ordered wine and heard the day's specials. I expected the waiter to be experienced and very good, but he did not smile once. When he came around to pour me a glass of wine, I asked him discretely how much was the entrée special, and he responded by describing the dish to me again. I decided to go for it, even though I didn't know the answer to my question.  I ordered the day's salad and entrée, arugula salad with artichoke among other ingredients and calamari stuffed with ground lobster. The salad ingredients tasted fresh but the dressing rather heavy and mayonnaise-like, not to my liking. The stuffing of the tube-like calamari tasted so savory creating a combination unlike other dishes I've had. One of my  friends had no luck with any of the dishes he ordered. Most notably, he got the pasta with the boar meat, which he compared in flavor and texture to Chef Boyardee. His girlfriend ordered the lamb and it was huge. I ate some, and it was tender and delicious. That dish was definitely the winner. Some of us split appetizers with one another and they were brought out to us plated separately, in half portions. I appreciated that. More than usual, I think dessert was the best part of the meal for most of the people in my group. We had heard that the place had good desserts and I was tempted by the strawberry rhubarb pastry and banana option. I sipped a chocolate cocktail instead. I enjoyed it and sampled my friends' selections, which were indulgent.  I saw the waiter touch my friend's back in an uncomfortable way, when he ordered a beverage and the hostess handed one of my friends the wrong coat at the end. The food was not fantastic. We felt fancy and the cost was only moderate for the kind of place it is.

2010-03-26,5.0,"I had the pleasure of meeting the chef's wife one day, as she is a friend of my neighbor's.  She mentioned her husband ran a restaurant in Uptown and since my husband and I are die-hard foodies, we decided to give it a try. We are so glad we did. This was one of the best meals I can recall in recent memory.  As others have mentioned, the $25 prix fixe is a STEAL as you can choose ANYTHING on the menu! To start, my husband chose the mussels, our friend had the baby octopus and I went with the romaine salad.  Everything looked and tasted amazing and was a nice portion - not too much, but not too scarce. For the main course, the hubby had the flat iron steak, our friend had the bouillabaisse and I had the pork chop - a stand out served with blue cheese gratin potatoes, fuji apple slices and watercress. One note about dinner -  my husband had ordered his steak rare, and apparently it was overcooked.  So, rather than bring out the overcooked steak or worse - put the other two meals in a warmer to wait for a new steak to be made - the chef himself came out with a small salad to tide my husband over until his steak could be re-made.  He was very apologetic, but we were blown away by the thoughtfulness and care - he did not want anything less than stellar to be leaving his kitchen. I suppose since I am pregnant and couldn't enjoy the free-flowing wine (but DID enjoy the housemade soda!), I couldn't wait to get to the dessert:  My husband and our friend enjoyed the subtle and delicious bread pudding, but I believe I scored the winner -  and because I was so blown away by the dessert, I can't recall the name of it!  It was a peanut butter pie-esque filling, with crushed oreo crust and a thick chocolate ganache top that was speared with two bites of peanut brittle. Oh. Em. Gee. One note about the noise.  We went in on a Thursday night and the place was about half-filled.  It wasn't too noisy for us, but I could imagine it might get amplified with more bodies in there.

2010-02-28,3.0,"Although it started on a misstep. They had our reservation but did not have the number in the party, it ended deliciously when we tried almost all the desserts.  The menu is devoid of any vegetarian or vegan options so make sure that friend will eat fish or they will stuck dining on bread all night (The bread is excellent). We had a variety of appetizers and standouts were the octopus salad and the gnocchi.  The bouillabaisse was good and the lamb shank was the hit of the table as well as a bleu cheese potato dish the water recommended.  The service was stellar and attentive.  The noise level was as loud as a bus station and i could not hear two people at the end of the table so that sort of made the experience a bit less than I need to return here with more people.  As stated the desserts, were delicious especially the rhubarb pie and the bread pudding ( i am crazy for a good bread pudding).",0.9813,0.79,0.173,0.037,0.6932539682539682

We were promptly greeted and seated. Service was decent - friendly but a little on the slow side. For an appetizer we got the gnocchi with rabbit confit, arugula pesto, pinenuts, and pecornio cheese. It was pretty tasty - the rabbit especially. For main course, I had the flat iron steak. It was lovely - perfectly done and full of flavor. The lemon roasted potatoes were particularly delcious. My husband had one of the specials that was being offered that night (forgot what it was!) and though the portion size was a little small, he enjoyed it. In terms of beverages, I can vouch for the blood orange cinnamon soda (made in house). It was yummy! We contemplated getting dessert, but as we progressed through our meal, the space became increasingly crowded and noisy, detracting from the experience, so we decided to skip it. We're usually not too sensitive to noise, but by the end of our meal we could barely hear each other across the table. The concrete floors and minimalist decor, don't allow for much sound absorbtion.  Overall, this place has some good food and I would give it another try - perhaps on a weeknight when it's not so crowded.",0.9862,0.849,0.135,0.016,0.4962962962962963
2010-02-27,4.0,"Ceres is the ancient roman goddess of harvest.  You know her. She stands atop the Chicago Board of Trade holding grain in her hand for it was the trade in grain that put Chicago on the map. Thus at Ceres' Table you will find locally produced and sustainable products that are made into unique dishes that are quite tasty and beautifully presented.  Chef Scurato used to be the chef at Topaz ( a restaurant out in Burr Ridge) where we used to enjoy many of his interesting dishes. Today- you can find some of those creations on Ceres' Table menu, like my favorite, the whitefish set atop a bed of clam chowder. Unusual but delicious!  We had reservations for a Friday night. Good thing as the place was packed. The noise level in the restaurant is a little off putting. Felt more like a bar than a fine restaurant. This is due to the fact that there is nothing to soften the noise. No curtains, no wall coverings, just robin's blue painted walls, dark wood chairs, tables and booths. The starkness is lends a contemporary feel but does nothing for the noise level. We spent the evening shouting across the table at each other.  The big winner here, though is the food. We started with the baby octopus and the crab Louie salad. Both very good especially when combined with the warm sourdough bread and butter and was on the table.  We fussed over which entrees to order- my friend finally decided on the beef brisket special of the day, and I had the pork chop. The food was delicious, with the brisket tender and moist and the blue cheese potato gratin perfectly complimenting my chop.  Portion sizes are reasonable so we had room for dessert. I had the winner of the evening- a banana bread pudding with caramel sauce. The cannoli that we also ordered was just okay.  They now have their liquor license but you can bring your own wine. Know that they have a $20 corkage fee ($20 for the first bottle, second bottle is free, limit two bottles) On the night we were there- they were out of one of their signature drinks which seemed a little strange given it's base was a well known whiskey.  Service was good although a couple of times we wondered where our server had gone. But the bus staff was great- taking care of everything else that we needed. Free street parking is readily available on this stretch of Clark.   And prices were reasonable.  Dinner for two with drinks and dessert ran about $130. Glad I finally made it to Ceres' Table.

With the weekday prix fixe deal, there is absolutely no excuse for you to skip this place!  You really ought to read Darick's review for the low-down on this joint. He breaks it down like a science.

2010-02-23,5.0,"In Short:  Come here Monday-Thursday between 5-7 for the $25 per person 3-course special. Bookend your meal with the Gnocchi appetizer and the Chocolate Souffle Tart and let the good times roll in-between. Leffe is a tasty beer. In Long: Not what I expected. I was sure this place was going to be over-priced with very little delivery and I was WRONG! *FIRST a note: Their $25 per person special 3-course meal is amazing and includes anything off the menu AND specials. I met a friend here on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty, but the staff was extremely friendly in that ''we are so glad you came, please come back and tell friends' way, you could tell they were very proud of their place, I even heard the bartender comforting a waiter ""Chicago is a WHOLE different place in the summer"". Appetizer: Our waitress suggested the Gnocchi so I had that and Pam ordered the Country Pate. Both were excellent dishes although the toast with the Pate was VERY hard and chewy. The Gnocchi was far better, we tussled over the last bites. Dinner: I had the Pork chop with blue cheese au gratin and apples and (inaudible drooling) and Pam had a Duck leg special with a bean simmer with lamb sausage. Both were very good, hers was better. My chop was tasty, but I asked for medium rare and it was well-done (i'm sure they would have replaced it, but it was good anyways so I didn't say anything). The bean simmer with the duck leg was the highlight of the meal to me, I hope they include it more regularly. Desert: Again we went with 2 suggestions from the waitress, Pam had the Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding and I had the Chocolate Souffle Tart, although Pam and I were having a great conversation, talking stopped as we dove into these, they were truly amazing dishes, both of us preferring our own over the other. The tart was the perfect temperature and so gooey inside with a crispy crust. The oranges and reduction sauce made my mouth tingle-it was oh so so....mmmmm There was minor confusion over the bill (the waitress accidently charged us $50 a person from their Valentine's Day special), but she was very apologetic and it was a quick easy fix. This was such a great surprise, this location seems a little cursed so I hope they keep their heads above water.

2010-01-30,4.0,"Ceres was surprisingly good, and I'm hard to surprise.  The flavors of everything I had were excellent.  I ate there with my brother and I tried his food, too.  So I tried the steak, the venison, the blue cheese gratin, the roasted brussel sprouts, the baby octopus, the gnocci, the bread pudding and the pistachio crème brulée.  They were all quite good, but the highlights were probably the baby octopus where I could taste every ingredient, but they also went together perfectly.  The blue cheese gratin was also very nice - much smoother than I expected, the gnocci were gummy, but the sauce they came in was wonderful, and I love pistachios and am picky about how they should taste, but the pistachio crème brulée was spot on. Service was also very good.  The server was helpful and quick, but not overbearing.  The host was very gracious about the 15 minute wait we had past our reservation, even comp'ing us dessert. All that said, it wasn't quite perfect. I have three relatively minor complaints. For a place named after the goddess of grain, there was only one  pasta dish  (despite the menu listing Ceres as the ""goddess of harvest,"" she is more often described as the goddess of grain, especially here in Chicago where a statue of Ceres graces the Board of Trade commodities exchange).  I know southern Italy isn't as known for pasta as northern Italy, but when you're named Ceres, I think more than one pasta dish would be nice. The space is simple and modern, but desperately needs something soft to absorb some of the sound - it is needlessly very loud. And lastly, my steak had a ribbon of sinew in it that was extrememly chewy and should have been trimmed out - especially since they serve the steak pre-sliced and so would have definitely been able to see it. Overall, though, I had a great time and would love to go back and recommend it to anyone who isn't bothered by a lively dining atmosphere.",0.996,0.766,0.193,0.04,0.5543711843711845

And... if the ""lack of energy or..."" whatever is going to prevent you from coming to this place?!?! Then for sure go to your nearest Jerry Kleiner restaurant and have a mediocre meal. I'm going to come back to Ceres' Table as long as Giuseppe will have me! Look, people... his most expensive entree is $22. His most expensive bottle of vino is $75. Giuseppe is one of the absolute most talented Chefs you have NEVER heard of because... He's actually in the kitchen and not whoring it up for the press! So let's talk about the FOOD!  OK... sorry Nana (my late Grandmother), I grew up thinking that you were the queen of Pate... The Country Pork Pate was a real close contender and the fruit compote with the mustard gives Pepe the edge. Mussels and Meurgez Sausage... the Speedball combination of the culinary world. My Venison Ragout was truly excellent. Lovely and rich, nice peppery overtone with that gamey-mineral. Absolutely anti-Atkins with the velvety polenta. My friend's chicken was 1. Really pretty and 2. near perfect. Airline cut breast, perfectly seasoned and carmely loveliness potatoes, skinny haricot vert and a rich jus.  We also had a side of Rapini, one of my absolute favorite veggies of all time. Olive oil, garlic and a hint of pepper flake. A very reasonably priced (and really tasty) Barbera d'Asti accompanied dinner. The Chocolate Souffle is their take on a molten cake and is for sure about as addictive as Opium. Rich, lush, gooey bitter chocolate with Orange and Hazelnuts. The food here is HONEST. It's SIMPLE and it's done with HEART (hell, he might put hearts on the menu!). This is real cooking where the food isn't tortured or made to resemble something that it isn't. It's about stews, braises and roasts (the winter menu is for the most part) and as well as it SHOULD right now! Ceres' Table is one of those slightly out-of-the way joints that people had better wise up to and go to. This is real food and it is certainly reasonable. Giuseppe's cooking really out-does several Bistro's that I'm quite fond of. Whine all you want about the decor... that you can see people's coats (ghast!)...

My BFF and her husband suggested this place for our night out this evening. I had no idea this restaurant had opened but since it is a short walk from our place, my Mr. and I were in.  Decor is sparse. Minimalist. Nice.  Our server was friendly... but a couple times I wondered if he was in the weeds. There was a big lag from the time we were sat until we placed our order. Not that big of a deal. Honestly, my favorite thing about our server was that he talked my husband into the pork chops that were the special for the evening.  I'll get to that later.  So we started with the gnocchi and the octopus. I only had one bite of the gnocchi because our friends are seafood challenged but I thought it was incredible... smooth and rich. The octopus... MMMMMM... really delicious. I'll definitely order it again.  Entrees: I had the bouillabaisse per the recommendation I read here and it was good. Very good. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and while I usually avoid the bivalves, I enjoyed them here. My friend had the venison ragout and her husband had the boar pasta.  Their plates were clean so I'm assuming they liked it but since I'm trying to convince them so Yelp, I'll leave it at that.    My dude... he was ready to go with the lamb shank until the waiter mentioned the special was a pork chop with blue cheese potatoes and roasted shallots. He went with that.  I was allowed two bites... and oh... they were a magical two bites. Two bites I'll be dreaming about for a while.  Dear Dude That Owns Ceres' Table,  Please add the pork chops to your regular menu. We'll be there twice a week.  Love,  Natalie S. We shared the banana bread pudding and the pistachio creme brûlée. I am such a sucker for creme brûlée and this one did not disappont. Loved the banana bread pudding too.  A bottle of wine, two appetizers, four entrees, one side, two desserts, a cup of coffee and 20% tip... $200.  Not bad at all. We decided that we easily scored the best table in the place. We were in our own cozy corner behind the host stand and it was great for conversation but the rest of the place was kinda loud. Bonus: corkage fee is $20... but it's waived if you order a bottle of wine from them first.   There's not a lot along this stretch of Clark so this place is a welcome addition to the area...  ... and I'm always glad when I'm close enough to walk to a bitchin' meal.",0.9986,0.742,0.214,0.044,0.6207358567358567

2009-12-23,5.0,"So we went in last night. First off they have no connection to the old place that really was bad.  Decor- It is simple and nice- If I owned the place- I would do something about hiding the coats in the front and I would hide the tables. A little wing wall on the coat rack, some table cloths, and a little paint in the bathrooms would be a 10 for me but when it comes to decor in restaurants I am kind of a pain in the ass.  Service- Our waiter- Jeff T- was great- he had had all of the food- understood the menu- could talk to this restaurant and others- and all around good service- he is great. The other people in the restaurant were great too. Front door person was very nice and helpful- taking our coats was nice- everyone was excited about the place and polite and over all a 10.  Food- I am not super adventurous. I like good food but not into many organ meats- things with heads- this place is great because you can get a few things that are pusing the envelope and things that anyone would eat. We had the country pate' - I do like pate' a lot and this was really good. Nice options of sauces, nice bread and we asked for more and they did not charge which is nice. Then we had entrees- I went with the steak- It was really good- roasted potatoes, roasted tomato's, and a generous steak made it filling and flavor filled and normal enough for me to not worry- It was really good for your unadventurous person at the table. Deserts were awesome too. I love that they are all $5- I mean really some places you are at like 12.93 for a piece of cake- this place is great because you can justify $5 and they are all - at least the banana thing and carrot cake are awesome. They had crunchy shaved items on top and sauce that you did not even need to make it moist but was good. Giuseppe Scurato does a good job with price, service and good food.  Com parables:  Province- This place wins because the food is more filling portions and the place is more approachable. Province restaurant is really pretty and the outside is cool but this place you are paying for the food and not the decor as much.  Terza Piano- This place wins because the service is better and food I just like better- TP wins a little on atmosphere as is is a cool building.",0.9991,0.667,0.271,0.062,0.5888444170771756
