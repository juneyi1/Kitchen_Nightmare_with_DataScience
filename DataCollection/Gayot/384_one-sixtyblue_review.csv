2012-01-03,5.0,"We had New Year's Eve dinner at this restaurant. Only my second time being here in at least 5 or 6 years. But I remember it as the best steak I ever had. I don't know why when we are thinking of somewhere to go this place doesnt come to mind. Anyway, it was again the BEST steak. This time I had the filet, perfect. GREAT desert, wonderful side dishes, and the service was excellent. My husband and I were very impressed and have vowed to never forget about this place again. We will build it into our rotation and make sure we visit regularly.",0.9866,0.733,0.267,0.0,0.628489032335186

The food was great (I recall a seasonal duck dish being great, a beet salad that was delicious, and some dessert that was beyond tasty.) Service was excellent as well. Only downside for me was location - it's pretty far west. I'll be back some day though!",0.9887,0.61,0.364,0.027,0.8277777777777778
2011-12-14,4.0,"One Sixty Blue was a nice experience for us and came in at about 4.5 stars.  We had the 3 course prix fixe menu for $33 pp, and it's only offered Mon - Thurs.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that the smoked salmon appetizer (with mashed sweet potato, and served over a large hash brown) and main courses were all on the salty side for us.  The wife had their hangar steak, and I had their Atlantic fluke over couscous.  Both were nicely done and presented with flavorful and colorful sides.  The desserts were a carrot cake terrine and chocolate semifreddo (a semi solid mousse concoction that I don't think I've had before) - and both were sweet, satisfying, and filling.  I also tried their $20 wine pairing.  It was a nice touch for a nice meal, and the pours are about half sized.  I never get pairings, but assume the pour size is typical.  The three half pours were plenty good for a little buzz at the end, and for the drive home.  Dining area is spacious, chic, and comfortable.   Service was friendly, attentive, and top-notch.   Street parking was fairly easy, though they do have $10 valet.   Overall, great place for a special occasion meal!",0.9909,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.6277777777777778

Food was okay...I got the saffron pappardelle. The sauce wasn't that good; I felt like I could have made a better sauce for this. It was missing some key ingredients (like cheese) which I feel should be in almost all pasta. The goat meatballs were really good though. And service here was good.

The staff was incredibly accommodating - they all seemed to know that we had booked our intimate family dinner in their private room on our wedding day and hadn't been back to the restaurant since our indulgent first anniversary.  The hostess, the bartenders, the servers and even the pastry chef all went out of their way to wish us a happy evening and to congratulate us on our marriage.  It gave the elegant restaurant a very warm, friendly feeling. Last night's experience was worth every penny.  We ordered the tasting menu and accompanying wine flight.  Each course was delightful but the duck, the squash soup, and the gnocci were perfect.  There is true artistry in the preparation and presentation of each dish.  The combination of flavors and delicate balance of layered tastes made me want to savor and scarf at the same time.  Our server, Mike, was thoughtful about his wine recommendations and had more than a superficial knowledge of the wines' origins and strengths.   What I COULDN'T believe, was that the restaurant wasn't packed.  I recommend you take advantage of this pronto.

The Smoked Salmon appetizer was delicious and a little unexpected!  I also was convinced to try the pumpkin cocktail, which was equally adventurous and delightful!  I loved that the menu was SO reflective of the season! Our entrees were good as well!  I really enjoyed the filet, which was cooked PERFECTLY and ordered the EXCELLENT mac'n'blue cheese and acor squash.  BOTH were incredible, and my tablemates, enjoyed them as well!

2011-11-07,5.0,"We stopped in for a celebratory Saturday night after we had tasted some of the restaurant's goodies during ""Taste of Randolph"".  The service is great from the moment we stepped in and had our coats checked. All staff at the restaurant are very attentive, hustling to take care of everyone. The atmosphere felt pretty chic and fancy, but everyone was not dressed to the nine's by any means. My girlfriend was wearing jeans and converse. I was a little nervous that we didn't look quite the part and would get substandard service- especially after getting the reservation on Open Table, but it didn't seem to be an issue. We had the sea scallop and pork cheek appetizer: scallop was a little overdone, but the salty collard and black-eyed pea mixture complemented the dish well. The potato gnocchi with pork belly and quail egg was a great take on bacon and eggs. A little too salty overall, but the pork was amazing. For dinner we had the saffron parpadelle with goat meatballs and spicy tomato sauce: wonderful, juicy meatballs and such a delicate, tasteful twist on spaghetti. We paired the cauliflower tagine with that- who knew curry and mint on cauliflower could be soooooo tasty? I'm not a big mint fan at all, but it worked.  My girlfriend and I split everything so we could try it all, and it was the perfect amount of food for us. I was actually a little over-stuffed! We had to pass on dessert, but the waiter (shout-out to Bradford!) brought over some AMAZING milk chocolate truffles for us. The PERFECT bite! And all tables seemed to be getting the shot of cider with vanilla foam.  The total for 2 apps, 1 side, 1 main course, and 2 alcoholic beverages was $80 without tip.

2011-10-30,4.0,"Great Meal, Great Service.  Pleasantly surprised by our experience! Food: We chose to visit to try out the new autumn menu and it was fantastic.  For appetizers we had the tomato and mussel soup, warm spinach salad, and the salmon hash brown.  Main course: we had the lobster and the capon.  Both highly recommended by the waiter and both were outstanding. The Capon may have been ever so slightly over salted, but it went well with the sweet cranberries.   Richie was our server and he was great.  He was able to accurately answer every question we had.  And he actually came by the table several times check up on us - Both are fading qualities in servers these days, especially in Chicago.   Thanks, Richie.    So why 4 stars? Assistant servers killed the night.    Well the kitchen servers, not Richie, made a huge mistake by serving our meal when one of us was in the restroom. Thus we returned to an already cooling off plate.  Also, the buss staff tried to remove some plates that we were not finished with.  So, the meal ended up feeling quite rushed - we just wanted to relax and enjoy our night out and not feel rushed for our $200.    Finally, the decor is scant and there isn't all that much of an internal atmosphere.  I understand they are going for the 'mod' look, but since there are no sweeping skylines to view, I think they need to do a better job on the inside -At least touch up the knicked and scuffed paint.   If the restaurant wants to make a leap up to 5 stars, they have to brush up on some of these little things that make the experience better for its patrons.",0.9881,0.792,0.164,0.045,0.5182027168234065
2011-10-22,2.0,"Most likely one of the most disappointing birthday dinners my boyfriend and I have shared, to date. Upon looking for somewhere to take the birthday boy for dinner, I came across One Sixtyblue and was impressed by the positive reviews and my ability to get a table 1 month out (unlike SO many other places). I was excited about the menu, there were plenty of meat and fish options as well as a Meatless Monday Menu. My experience here receives a frown as a combination of both the food as well as the service. I was annoyed at the attentiveness of the service to surrounding tables that were seated at near the same time as compared to ours. Tables receiving drinks and bread and their food, while we were still waiting for a damn glass of wine. The food? I got the Meatless Monday 5 course meal that consisted of an udon noodle salad, vegetable paella, mozzarella salad, a papperdelle and saffron dish, and a pumpkin pie dessert. Nothing about my 5 course was bad, nothing...but at the same time, nothing was great either. I think my boyfriend enjoyed his meal, he probably wouldn't tell me if he did not anyways.

2011-09-25,2.0,"Very good food, but horrible, pushy service. My husband and I went here on a double date with some friends from out of town.  I'd been looking forward to trying One Sixtyblue for weeks, but was extremely disappointed by the experience we had there.  I will not be going back. THE GOOD The food was very good.  The menu had a varied selection with many dishes that sounded great.  I had the duck and thought it was excellent - crispy skin on the outside, perfectly done medium-rare on the inside, yummy sauce.  My 3 companions all enjoyed the food they ordered. THE BAD Cocktails were disappointing.  My husband and I each ordered a different signature cocktail.  They were described as sophisticated, hand-crafted cocktails but ended up being basically frozen daiquiris served in wine glasses. And then there is the service.  Our waiter was wannabe pretentious and extremely pushy all night.  I ended up feeling extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed that I suggested this restaurant to my friends. The waiter insisted on giving us an extremely long-winded explanation of the straight forward menu.  This explanation was clearly a memorized speech but our waiter kept fumbling through his explanations.  His drawn out speech was 60% buzz words (local, farm-fresh, farm local, local farm) and highlight almost all the dishes on the menu so it wasn't helpful at all. When I placed my order I didn't order an appetizer since I wasn't all that hungry.  Our waiter was horrified and insisted that we should order several appetizers for the table as well as several sides.  I declined again but he kept on suggesting appetizers until I relented and agreed to order an appetizer to split with my husband.  When everyone finished ordering he again tried to get us to order a bunch of sides and we literally had to shove the menus back at him to get him to leave us alone. After I finished my cocktail, the waiter wanted me to let him choose a glass of wine to go with my entree.  He was annoyed when I instead asked to see the wine list and made my own selection.  My friend and I both ordered glasses of wine well before our entrees were served, but they took forever to arrive.  When my husband flagged down the waiter to remind him about the wine we were told that the delay was because they had to get those bottles out of the back.  (Really?  You don't have the wines you serve by the glass readily available?)  We finally got our wine when we were more than halfway done with our entrees. In summary, I was very dissapointed by One Sixtyblue.  I found it overpriced and extremely pushy.",0.9784,0.752,0.146,0.102,0.5320227920227919

We told the maitre-de that we were only killing time before a cooking class and were only in for a drink.  They were happy to accomodate us and even sat us outside with a waitress (i was sure we'd be relegated to the bar area). Our waitress was ADORABLE.  I wish I could remember her name.  She was blonde and had perfect Marilyn Monroe make-up and was so sweet & helpful.  Both my friend and I ordered an amazing champagne drink with blackberry. lime & ginger.  The waitress also brought us out a bread basket (on the house) that came with amazing flat bread, yum-tastic ciabattas and butter with pickles in it!  YUM!!! My favorite part of the experience was not only being outside in Chicago on a gorgeous summer evening, but also that the flower boxes next to which we were seated were loaded with fresh herbs that smelled heavenly and created a very relaxed atmosphere. i'd love to come back here again.  BRAVO!!!!",0.9946,0.756,0.234,0.01,0.6229074074074075
2011-08-28,4.0,"I made reservations for our anniversary dinner here at One Sixtyblue and the hostess on the phone was very polite. We were able to get free street parking across from the store which is a big plus, that's just another $10 I'm not spending on valet so I can get a nicer bottle of wine inside. Food selections: Summer market vegetable soup (with pork broth), seafood and lamb sausage paella, field duck over quinoa salad and plums, rainbow trout with cheesy grits and fresh corn, side of blue cheese macaroni, and a dessert of banana cake with chocolate ganache, a brown sugar caramelized wafer and a tiny ""Happy Anniversary"" chocolate sheet. Cute, I guess. The wait staff was obviously very knowledgeable and eager to assist with any decision making. We got a bottle of Clos Du Mon-Olivet (French Red, 2009). Nothing pricey but just sweet and dry enough to pair well with my duck. The misses always prefers red regardless of what she's eating it with, so it fit just fine. The food came in a very timely manner and the courses were paced well. Appetizers were just that; perfectly sized and they had a hearty warmth to them that dragged me into a comfortable atmosphere to the mostly empty restaurant. We arrived around 6:00. The vegetables in each dish were freshly picked from their local urban garden, and though surrounded by many other flavors and combinations, each ingredient went hand in hand with each other. The chef is truly a master of his craft. The duck came perfectly seared to medium rare, the rainbow trout practically melts in your mouth, and the banana dessert just became more delicious the more I ate. I was in such a good mood (maybe it was the wine) that we stuck around for another half hour; she ordered a white Spanish dessert wine and I got a scotch.

Here are a few highlights: - I'm gluten free and called ahead to make sure there would be options.   When we arrived, everyone knew of my allergy, the restaurant printed a special menu for me with GF options, which was full of options.   Our server was helpful and informed. This might sound basic but typically I feel like a pain with my eating restrictions rather than a normal guest. It was a refreshing change to be treated so well.  - I went with my mother and boyfriend. All three of us were thrilled with our food and tried a variety of items.   Between us we had the hanger steak, prawns, duck, pork tostados, seafood paella, mushroom caps with foie gras and mozzarella salad. All the vegetables were fresh and amazing. - The sommelier helped us pick out a wine for dinner.  Not only was it delicious, but it was only half of what I said the budget was.   Who does that? - Again, I must comment how great the service was. There's something to be said that my water glass was never more than half empty, - I heard taxi's don't come by as often but they ordered one for us and it was there within minutes - My boyfriend commented this is easily on his top list of Chicago Overall, it was a wonderful meal and I would highly recommend it.",0.993,0.787,0.189,0.024,0.5980661375661375

The service was good, very attentive staff, but our main waiter seemed to be trying desperately hard to appear like a snooty waiter.  He repeated everything 2 or 3 times, and rather rudely informed us that we couldn't order appetizers while still deciding on our mains - they need to send the ticket in as a whole once. ???

2011-07-04,4.0,"I saw their booth at Taste of Randolph last month and was intrigued by their menu.  When my friends were in town for the July 4th weekend, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to try the place.  It is located at the very end of Randolph, so if you are getting off at the Ashland CTA stop, exit via the eastern stairs.  We went out the western exit and found ourselves in some questionable territory. The food itself was really tasty.  I liked their bread basket which included the typical dinner rolls plus these large crackers with different types of seeds on it.  We decided to get the grilled chorizo-stuffed chicken wings based on the server's recommendation as an appetizer, and it was quite good albeit in tiny portions.  The same could be said for my wood-grilled duck breast.  Nicely cooked with lots of flavor, but the quantity was a little on the small side.  One of my friends also got the duck and finished it in 2 minutes.  Another friend got the grilled Amish chicken which compared to the duck was a larger portion. After finishing the main courses, we declined dessert as we were heading back into the city but that's when the surprises started coming.  First, the palatte cleanser drink of watermelon lemonade with a pickled blueberry.  Very refreshing and hit the right spot after dinner.  Then we got chocolate truffles which were unexpected and amazing.  Finally, we got some candied peach bites as well as baked peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies.  All these treats were totally unexpected and made for a nice surprise ending to the meal.",0.9852,0.863,0.126,0.011,0.6042282430213466

We wanted a fancy dinner for our three year anniversary but didn't want to go broke so chose to come to One Sixtyblue after researching on Yelp.  After eating at places like Gary Danko in SF, I always have pretty high expectations from my $$$ to $$$$ restaurants. One Sixtyblue did not disappoint.  5 STARS FOR APPETIZER AND MAIN COURSES Appetizer 1. Ceviche - very fresh seafood but very small portion (that or the bf and I are fatties)  Main Course 2. Pan-Fried Walleye - cooked perfectly. The texture of the fish was thick and a little flaky, seasoned with some lemon butter. I loved this dish.  3. Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon -  also cooked perfectly! The salmon was pink on the inside and crisp on the outside. Served with a side of dungeness crab salad and roasted garlic crab sauce. Amazing flavors. MINUS 1 STAR FOR SIDE DISH Side Dish: 4. Wood Grilled Fingerling Potatoes - Overgrilled and tasted burnt and hard. I did not enjoy this at all, but the bf ate it anyway (not as picky).  MINUS 1 STAR FOR DESSERTS Dessert  5. Sorbet - Came in 3 mini scoops each with a different flavor. Strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry? Very refreshing, but nothing too special.     6. Fruit tart - The fruit was good but the cup made with dough was dry and had no flavor.  PLUS 1 STAR FOR SERVICE AND AMBIANCE 8. The bf had mentioned it was our anniversary and they gave us a complimentary dessert (dish with ""happy anniversary"" written with chocolate). It wasn't much but a very nice gesture =]  Also, they gave us free peanut butter choc chip cookies to go! I usually don't like peanut butter but these cookies were heavenly.  AND on our way out, our waiter gave us free choc truffles too. How do you say no to so many free things? =] Our waiter and hostess were very friendly and even offered to help us take pictures for our occasion.  9.

2011-05-18,3.0,"So i was visiting chicago last week me and my girlfriend was craving meat good meat like meat that just melts in your mouth good! Our choice was One Sixtyblue, this restaurant was owned by the man the legend Michele Jordon! We figured this restaurant had to be great. Our reservations were at 9PM, we arrived 10 minutes before and was greeted by a coat checker than the hostess, they told us give them a few minutes so they can prepare the table,  we spent roughly 10-15 minutes at the bar being entertained by the bar tender. They had a full bar with everything, which was nice.. Then we got called to be seated, our server jason was very helpful read us the specials, and described the menu to his best ability. And here comes the numbers! Ok for those that don't know how i score i find 5 different categories about the specific restaurant score them individually and average out that number for the final rating of the restaurant.  Food and Drinks: I have ate at many steak places in my life time, i know average when i eat there and this place was just AVERAGE, the 20oz Ribeye that we both got was kinda dry the seasoning is ok nothing extravagant, and the baked potato was smaller than the diameter of 3 quarter rolls put together.  We usually get 2 main entrees and try them but as i said before we were craving meat.. haha Our appetizer we ordered were the smoked salmon drizzled in orange blossom honey which was very good, as good as it can get the honey that they used just made me say mmmhm out loud!  It hit every single taste bud i had with flavoring, all i can say is i highly recommend this dish if your a salmon fan like myself! The other appitaizer we ordered was Hawaiian Ahi Tuna Tartare, i ordered this just to see if it was better than the tuna tartare we had at our hotel which gave me a mouth orgasm but ill review that one soon! ;) This Tartare was made with aji amarillio, yuzu soy mayo, avacado, and battera kombu. Off the back when i dove into this it had a tangy flavor but not in a bad way. It was good but it didnt give me that i must try it again kinda feeling. For deseret we were stuffed but they decided on giving us free complimentary dessert shot and some special made cookies.  Score: 2.8 (this is mainly because of the ribeye, if im paying almost $40 for a steak it has to have some good seasoning.)  Wait time and Customer Service: Wait time was average, they didnt have a lot of people in the dining area but they still made us wait a little, we werent in a rush or anything so it really didnt matter to us. The customer service here was awesome, from the hostess calling us a taxi 10 minutes before we finished to the GM coming by to check on us twice. The waiter jason was a comedian, he never let my wine touch the bottom, and refilled my lady's Shirley temple before prompted to, the bartender gave us directions on nacional 27 where we decided to go latin dancing afterwards and entertained us while we waited for our table.  Score: 4.6 Restaurant Environment: I have to say this is one of the much more nicer restaurants i been to in my life time, after all Dr. J owns it right? The ambiance was nice, the bar and dinning area was setup perfectly and the wine area was stocked and elegant looking. If you wanted to wine and dine a girl this would be the place to take her.  Score: 4.7 Price: The price reflects the food right? So do you think paying $40 bucks for a average steak is ok? i didnt think so. The other dishes were on par but its just something about that steak... Over priced for small portions that didn't deliver taste..

LOCATION: It is on randolph, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's near the cluster of conveniently located places right off of halsted and randolph. It's quite a treck if you're walking like we were in the cold( from halsted & randolph), but definitely worth it.  DECOR/AMBIANCE: We loved the ultra clean look and minimalist approach that resonates through the entire experience from the lighting, tables, open kitchen, to the plating of the food. This place has all the elegance and quality of a pretentious place without all the pretentiousness. Nothing is more off putting than a place were you love the food, but don't want to go back because of the snobby atmosphere.  SERVICE: Hostess was very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating even though we were 30 minutes late for our reservation. We were seated immediately in a nice corner table that was private, but not lonely. Our server Tori was extremely helpful, informative, but not intrusive. The manager Kate was also very friendly and we were glad to hear they've added a patio for the summer. Our server even asked us if she could call a cab for us when she brought our check. Excellent customer service.  FOOD:  We went for chef's week, so we had the $33 pre-fixe menu. There were plenty of delicious options, and everything we ate here was delicious. The warm bread and butter they serve is great.  The great thing about this place is that every dish we ordered here had amazing texture ( some sauce, something soft, something crispy, something green) along with being delicious. Nothing on the plate was superfluous though. Everything was in perfect balance and enhanced the flavor of the dish. It is rare when this happens at all, so we were pleasantly surprised that it happened for multiple dishes. My friend had the skate fish and the portion size is huge and it was melt in your mouth tender. I thought it was a touch salty on it's own, but when eaten with the couscous below it, it was perfect. The porcini mushroom ravioli was also excellent. The desserts were delicious as well. They also have little complementary surprises like a kiwi tapioca palette cleanser they bring out after your main course. And a homemade cookie and sweet candy with your check. Nice touches we thought.  DRINK: They have AMAZING sodas on the menu. I had the blackberry lime ginger soda and the strawberry mint soda and both were delicious. They are $5 each and were a nice option to have. I did think they were served with too much ice, which kind of made them a bit watered down by the time i got to the end, but still delicious.

After our waiter raved about the vegan caesar salad I had to give it a try - the mix of seasonings in that dressing were spot on for anchovies. It was very nicely done. The pan-seared skate just fell off the knife in a beautiful way, and was truly delicious. And I have to give praise to the hash brown, cooked in shallots and duck fat. Very tasty! We had a very charismatic waiter, excellent cocktails, and we were close enough to the kitchen to watch the chef in action, which is always fun. The portions were ideal sizes as well.

The interior is surprisingly cozy and romantic, not at all what I expected from the outside.  Our waiter was very friendly and professional.  I ordered the Blackhawks special cocktail, ""Quinville's Cup"" and had to silently chuckle when he pronounced the Q-stache's name Qwen-veal.  The actual cocktail was made with absinthe, gin, and elderflower.  It was my first time trying absinthe and I thought it was delicious.  The elderflower was the strongest flavor, but it clearly paired well with the alcohols.  Also, the bread and crackers served with pickle butter were very fresh and tasty.  It's rare that the complementary bread and crackers get mentioned on yelp, but that butter was sooooo great.  Yum! On to dinner - everything on the menu seemed to be delicious.  So much so that we almost skipped the restaurant week menu to try the a la carte selections instead.  The steak tartare was very good, but should be served with more breads.  Shrimp and grits - mmmm.  Shrimp gumbo was so good it should be served by the terrine.  Wood grilled flat-iron was cooked perfectly.  Chicken and sweet potato gnocci were also great.  I could have eaten there all night. Dessert - we had the sticky toffee bread and the peanut butter something.  Both were great.  The peanut butter one tasted like a gourmet Reese's improved 1000x.  The best part of both was the caramel.  If I was eating this at home, I would have licked the bowl (gross, I know, but worth it lol).

Before agreeing to do this I asked our waiter if it would be a problem that I do not eat any seafood and he assured me it would not - they always tailor the tasting menu to any taste requests and allergies.  In fact he told me they had recently done a vegan tasting menu!   Going with the tasting menu was one of the best restaurant decisions I've ever made.  It was so much fun getting food that I would never have ordered on my own.   {And it was very nice of the restaurant to give us a print-out with everything we ate at the end of the night!} Here was our menu: First - Wood Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow Second - Dietzler Top Sirloin Steak Tartare {for me} & Pumpkin Pancake & House-Cured Salmon {for the BF} Third - Pan Seared Vermont Quail {for me} & Charred Baby Octopus Pastrami Pork Belly {for the BF} Fourth - Acorn Squash Ravioli {for me} & Sauteed Florida Tile Fish {for the BF} Fifth - Grilled Hanger Steak {for me} & Braised Beef Short Rib {for the BF} Sixth - Chevre Cheesecake Seventh - Chocolate Torte The highlight for me was the Acorn Squash Ravioli.  This is like heaven exploded in your mouth.  Incredibly flavorful and delicious. The highlight for the BF was the Braised Beef Short Rib, which came with byrd mill yellow grits.  I LOVE grits and these were easily the BEST grits I've ever tried. The lowlights for me were the bone marrow and the steak tartare.  I would have never chosen bone marrow, and I'm not sure I'd have it again in the future.  It tasted like oily fat to me.  The steak tartare had so much pickle that it kind of tasted like tuna salad.  The lowlight for the BF was the charred baby octopus.  He said it was so charred that he didn't taste the octopus at all. We definitely enjoyed our meal and the wait staff was superb.  If you're heading there I definitely recommend the tasting menu.  It was a lot of fun and the portions were perfect.",0.9964,0.818,0.163,0.02,0.4719348659003831

Over the phone she asked about out likes and dislikes on wine preferences. We are pretty much only red wine drinkers. When we arrived,  there were several couples waiting for tables but she greeted us both by name and sat us immediately.  Our waiter was already prepared for us having the grand tasting and our first course started with celebratory champagne. Now here is where they get 4 stars and not 5. Now I like red meat, don't get me wrong, but because i asked specifically for red wine, they gave us all red meat for our tasting. Most of their menu is not red meat at all so i was highly disappointed in that regards. And a little of backwards thinking by the sommelier and/or chef. But i found out i don't have a palate for bone marrow. However I did mentioned in our wine preferences that he has a particular taste for Oregon wines and low and behold they brought out two for the pairing (nice touch, i thought). I also had a special request for a chocolate desert.

2010-12-13,4.0,"Long overdue in (re)visiting one sixtyblue.  It had been nearly a decade since dining here last and one thing struck me as I walked in the place.  I think it identical aesthetically/design layout speaking as it was back when MJ was still a big part of this place....as well as the Bulls. It is pretty timeless imo, and still manages to pull off a quality class feel in a fairly understated manner.  The EC has obvi changed hands since then and the current in charge has a pedigree that's no slouch, Trotter's and Everest to name a few.   So there are a certain few restaurant's entrees that hold on to your memory long after you've indulged in them and 160 is right at the top with their Delmonico Steak.  No longer avail. Boo, etc! Not to worry, they had a few other steaks to choose from, 3+  grain fed (a Hanger, Bone in Ribeye and ?) and a grass fed NY Sirloin.  Normally I opt for a grain fed steak as it generally yields more flavor but was enticed to go with the grass fed  for whatever reason.  It was good but was a lot  like a filet in it's buttery texture...note to self: stick w what you know and like...and in Steak's case, the end all be all for me is the Bone in Ribeye.  Anyway, it was still good and the quality and prep was first rate. The accompanying Blue Cheese Mashed potatoes matched this dish about as good as any i've tasted.  She went with the maple leaf duck breast that was seared and cooked to a perfect Med Rare and topped off with an equally perfectly cooked poached egg.  It was sliced and displayed pretty much like you would see seared ahi tuna and it was exquisite, both in taste and presentation.  Shared a side of Vegetable Hash which was very tasty as was our finishing dessert dish, the pan fried carrot cake. As for service I dare say our lovely server knew more about the menu than perhaps Chef Michael himself.  She was ridiculous and could probably recite the entire menu, including each dish's origin, prep and presentation straight from memory.

2010-12-03,4.0,"""Let's pop into One SixtyBlue"", said I after a party at a nearby bar.  ""Where?"" said my friend.  ""One SixtyBlue. It's practically across the street""  ""Strange name"", said he.  Strange name, indeed but great food and service.  As for that name, while many associate this with Michael Jordan as it is one of the restaurants he owns, the name actually comes from the old address of this refurbished pickle factory as the parking lot used to be Loomis Street and the address? 160. As for the Blue-the building used to be colored bright blue, thus the name.  History lesson complete, One SixtyBlue has gone through a renovation since my last visit and now is much more contemporary in its approach.  We had dinner in the bar area which turned out to be a huge value for on Wednesday and Thursday nights- they have amazing specials. On Wednesday nights- it is a fried chicken deal for around $8.  And on Thursday (the night we were there) they had $4 burgers. We ordered the crab cake appetizers to start and a burger and fried pickles to share.  The crab cake appetizers, while good, were a little salty for my liking, but the presentation was lovely. Instead of one large crab cake, they served up 8 mini crab cakes beautifully presented each with a dollop of sauce on them.  As for the burger, it was great! Served on a chewy pretzel roll- there are a variety of toppings that you can add and it came with french fries.  I have to say, that One SixtyBlue did fine by it's heritage as a pickle factory with their fried pickles. No small slices here- these are full sized garlicky pickles deep fried and served with a sort of pickle relish aioli sauce. We also asked for some regular aioli sauce and their chipotle sauce which were also good choices. Delicious although I was a little skeptical when my friend suggested we order them.  The beer list is full of craft beers (the only domestic light they have is Bud Light so try something new!) and the servers are knowledgeable about them. Speaking of servers, Mary took great care of us making sure we had everything we needed in a pleasant and professional manner with none of the pretense that I remember from the last time I was at this place.  Dinner for two with drinks was only about $40 (cheap by any standards!), parking is easy- either in the lot or on the street and the dinner menu looked great as well (note to self- go back and sit in the restaurant soon!)

After dinner, they asked us for dessert -- which we skipped bc we were so full.  However, our waiter came out with chocolate cookies -- which are to DIE for!  Super bits and chunks of chocolateyness bursting into your mouth.  I ate them the next day and they were still good!  The passionfruit candies were a bit mushy again.  I kinda wish they were more gummy texture and the cider shot was a good way to end the meal.   Overall, 5 stars for being great at service and for the food.  The decor is also extremely nice.  They have simplistic contemporary themes with the perfect amount of light.  I'd come here and take my date here any day.",0.9935,0.814,0.166,0.02,0.4946969696969697

Now, if you factor in the service, the value as a whole package rises. The Duck Fat Fries though flavorful can not be compared equally or favorably against the Duck Fat Fries from Hot Dougs. But on grounds of merit and execution, it was pulled off rather well. There was an error on the burger that my partner had order in which they were quick to correct. The burger I had ordered was pretty good with the three pieces of bacon was 3/16"" thick and cooked very well which was impressive. The texture the burger had been pretty spot on though the bun was a bit much from my recollection. The fried pickle although unique had me wishing it was a bit more crunchy. Now the fried chicken, thoughtfully executed with the chicken being moist and the skin having that crunch that is greatly desired or perhaps expected. The waffle that was served with it was nice and not to be ignored even though it was literally overshadowed by the chicken. My partner had ordered the pheasant which though was nice, I could recall very little from the experience at the time. We had ordered desserts to round off the experience the second time around. One was a certainly memorable and entertaining experience through and through, the ice cream roll with pop rocks. Though, it maybe the nostalgia of it all or the liquor, it was the first experience I had in describing a dessert ""fun"". In contrast to this was another ice cream plate, which just didn't sit well with my palette. Having eaten quite a few curries in my life, [this set-up doesn't sound right, does it?] it came off as spice heavy with a savory hit. There maybe ways to execute it but tasting, cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, tumeric, and more was just a bit too much for me. Overall, if you have spare cash to burn in the neighborhood or looking for a place with nice service and a very date like environment, then this is certainly ideal",0.9891,0.863,0.133,0.005,0.6146541950113377

My husband said that the $4 burger was very good (I don't eat meat), particularly considering the price!  Can't complain about that.  He also added on smoked cheddar and caramelized onions.  I ordered the veggie burger for $10, since they won't sub out the veggie burger in the special. From a restaurant like this, I expected something delicious and homemade.  Well, it turned out that it looked a whole lot like a Gardenburger.  Not a 100% sure that it was, but I've eaten a fair amount of Gardenburgers in my life, and this was at least pretty close.  The description had said bulgur and mozzarella, so I thought there would be mozzarella on it.  Guess they just meant the mozzarella in the patty.  Needless to say, it was disappointing.  It was the most expensive Gardenburger I've ever had.  I thought the fries were just ok, and the fried pickle was good but nothing spectacular.  So, vegetarians be forewarned.  If we go back for the same deal, I'll order the pizza--better chance of that being made in-house.    We had the same bartender both times, and he was nice.  I had a glass of the viognier, which was refreshing.  My husband had the 160 brew, which I tasted and liked.  It's a very easy-drinking beer, good but not challenging.   All in all we've had a good time, but I won't be running back for the veggie burger anytime soon!  I'll go to DMK if I want a quality veggie burger (and better fries, too).",0.9926,0.818,0.156,0.025,0.5922936507936509

Sides: +fried green tomato: you get two large slices of fried tomato over a tangy romesco sauce. i loved the romesco sauce but my husband liked the fried tomato sans sauce. +hash brown: SO good! seriously, fried potato heaven! the hash brown comes is cooked in duck fat powder and has caramelized shallots and melts in your mouth.

Its apparently very popular because the bar was filled with patrons around 6pm. The bar area opens at 5pm and the dining area opens at 5:30pm. We got there early which was great for me because I was starving and ready to eat! We walked in and were immediately greeted by the host.  We were allowed to choose any seat in the bar area. They have seats at the bar, and regular high tables with chairs. The burger special is a burger, fries, and fried pickle for $4! Its a steal!!! If you want toppings though, it'll cost you an additional $2. Still pretty good for the size of the meal. Service was friendly and timely. They didn't talk down to us just because we came in for a burger. I LIKE THAT!!!!! If you like chicken, they have a chicken and champagne special on Wednesday nights for $8.

My first reaction to Trout and Bratwurst was, come again? This turned out to be my favorite course partially based on the creative nature of the dish but it was also delicious. I like how one sixty blue does their tastings, it's not prix fixe as the chef decides which courses to prepare but the server asks if there is anything you do want or don't want to have. I was a bit surprised that the dining room wasn't packed on a Friday at 8pm... Maybe it was an off-weekend?

Our server was everything a server should be --  knowledgeable but not intimidating, professional but not uptight, friendly but not cheesy. He totally put us at ease and made us feel that no question was too stupid (""How do you pronounce this word?"")  The Pinot Grigio and Riesling were excellent. I had the Grilled Amish Poussin which was savory and tender. The entrees themselves were beautiful creations in every way, presentation and flavor. The menu is constantly changing based on what's available in the urban garden out back - yes, the garden is out back in the parking lot. 160 Blue hires a local gardener, Jessica Rinks, who directs the planting and harvesting year-round. For me, that was the coolest part about this place. Without that, the restaurant might seem a little too much like your typical fine dining for rich execs. But the rotating menu + garden out back gives it the feel of a totally unique place that is on the cusp of local food movement restaurant trends. Add to that the outstanding service and unusually friendly and knowledgeable staff, and ding, ding, we have a winner!  Executive Chef Michael McDonald seems to be at the top of his game right now. I read on the website that as a young chef he was mentored in fine French cuisine at  ""Everest"" (what better way to start your career?) then was trained in Asian techniques before heading up one of Charlie Trotter's restaurants in Los Cabos, Mexico.

2010-07-15,4.0,"I am going to back off my previous statement of ""best fried chicken ever"" but it's still very good, and a hell of a great deal for $8.  This time around, my white-meat piece was very dry and my dark-meat piece was moist but quite oversalted.  Fries, slaw, waffle--all fine, but the chicken is still the star. A beet dish on their ""Sides"" menu caught my eye (only five dollars to boot), so of course I had to try it.  There were chopped almonds, a sherry vinaigrette, and a few haute little greens (sorry, I don't know the names of these things) complementing the wonderful bars of roasted beets.  I gobbled up the whole dish; it wasn't one of the best that I've had but was well worth ordering. We had a rookie bartender who needed some coaching from the veteran on how to mix the drinks.  He also denied any beer specials, when the menu indicated Bell's Oberon for $4.  In the end I didn't mind, but it might have annoyed me another time.  Declining to pay $8-9 for a bottle of beer, I tried two of their specialty cocktails.  The Spice on Ice--10 Cane rum, jalapeno peppers, and red lemonade--was creative and tasty, but I didn't care for the sugar rim which quickly became a wet, sticky goo all over my face and hands.  The Sublime Chill--Hendricks gin, cucumber juice, and ""orange"" (whatever that means)--was the blandest $11 drink that I've ever tasted.  I typically love Hendricks cocktails, but this tasted merely like cucumber-flavored water.  I detected nothing orangey whatsoever, not to mention any gin. Next time I will insist on the beer special or drink water.  Makes for a cheaper meal anyway, and isn't that the spirit of the $8 fried chicken special?",0.9893,0.772,0.166,0.063,0.5334318555008211
2010-07-15,3.0,"Enticed by the $8 fried chicken special as well as the declaration of ""best fried chicken ever"", I finally made it here last night. I arrived ahead of my friend and sat down in a virtually empty bar. Where was everybody? Anyway, due to my newly discovered love of gin, I ordered a cocktail called the Sublime Chill: Hendrick's gin, cucumber juice and ""orange"". I wasn't really sure what they meant by ""orange"". Orange juice; orange simple-syrup; orange segments? The drink was pretty, I'll give it that; a lovely shade of green. And you could definitely taste the cucumber; the orange, not so much. It was a nice summer cocktail but it should have had more balanced flavor. My friend arrived and asked about beer specials and he was told there weren't any, so he ordered a something or other off the cocktail menu but was dismayed to get the drink and find powdered sugar all over the rim which quickly turned into a sticky paste from the condensation on the glass. Then, after looking at the menu again, he noted that there were in fact, beer specials. We had a bartender-in-training so perhaps he wasn't aware, but he should have asked the other bartender there, who clearly was a veteran. Since the fried chicken was the main reason for coming, we both ordered it, and to that, my dining companion also added a beet salad. He's all about the beets. The food arrived and I was a little disappointed. For $8, I wasn't expecting half a fried chicken or anything, but I did expect at least a breast would be part of the equation. Instead we got a thigh and a wing, but at least the wing was a good size. It also came with fries, a waffle, and slaw on the side. The chicken was good; it was definitely not the ""best ever"". If I'm going to eat dark meat, I'd rather have a leg than a thigh, so I didn't eat much of it; the wing piece was better and oddly not as dry as the thigh. The crust was crispy and well-seasoned. My dc thought it too salty, but I am a salt fiend, so it wasn't an issue for me. The waffle was decent; it added a sweet component to the savory/salty chicken, but the fries were kind of blah. I was there for the chicken anyway, so it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. He offered me a taste of his beet salad, but knowing his predilection for beets, I declined so he could have them all to himself and I'm unselfish like that. Besides, that salad was crawling with almonds and I no can do. We finished up and declined dessert because greater sweets awaited us elsewhere. Would I go back? Sure. I love fried chicken, and the price is right. Maybe it was a bit of an off night since it was far from the best I've ever had, but I'll give it another shot. Side note: Helena, how come you got three pieces of chicken? Geez, way to play favorites, one sixtyblue. 3.5 stars.",0.9972,0.813,0.157,0.03,0.5717861008039579

All of the food was either over cooked or undercooked, and either over seasoned or underseasoned.  It was most disappointing because everything sounded like it was going to be good and it just wasn't. The service was also not great.  Our waiter was very distant and did a poor job of explaining the dishes and drinks.

The gift cert had a 1-year expiration date, and we didn't check (in the wedding kerfluffle) but instead put it away for a rainy day. Fast forward to April 2010. After digging the certificate out of my sock drawer, I noticed the date (4 months past expiration!), panicked, called the restaurant and spoke to the manager--she was lovely!

April 30 rolls around, and my husband and I, all dolled up, go down to onesixty blue, where we have an absolutely delicious dinner. My pork tenderloin arrived in several different styles and textures on the plate, and underneath was a delicious sauerkraut sauce that complimented each pork flavor--perfect! Ben had the rabbit, which was like a richer, smoother chicken, and a gorgeous sauce underneath it as well. Our starter was the crispy rice crusted shrimp, with cucumber, curried yogurt and papadams. Ben said he could have eaten it as an app and again as an entree--very good indeed! For dessert, one sixtyblue did the nicest thing, and gave us an anniversary dessert on the house. It even came with a piece of dark chocolate with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in icing script.  Dessert itself was a dark chocolate mousse with whipped cardamom cream.

For din all four of us went for the walleye, which came with purple potato mash, snap peas, and morels.  Fish was delicious--flaky, mild, and paired well with its array of accompaniments.  As per usual, I wished there had been about 3 more pieces of fish on my plate, but such is life. Skipped dessert, nothing sent our hearts a-palpitating--though they did have a coconut curry sorbet, the sound of which made me vom in my mouth a little.  On the upside, they give you complimentary cookies with the bill!  Chocolate peanut butter.  Delightful.   Other addendum: lovely host and hostess--very flexible--but they should have been, given that the restaurant was only 1/2 on a Friday night in the fine city of Chicago.

I made sure to call a week ahead of time to discuss having a special dessert and/or candle brought to our table and they assured me that they do it all the time - easy enough.  The night of the event, I scooted away from our table, no hostess at the front, so found a not-so-busy older male server to discuss the events of the evening.  I pointed out who my fiance was, repeated his name several times, and the guy said it'll be taken care of - not to worry since they had noted it a week before and we had just discussed it further at the beginning of dinner. Dessert comes around - BAM - no candle.  No acknowledgement at all.  The lovely people at our table gladly cheersed with us, but I was pissed - and extremely embarassed.  After the checks had been delivered and paid, and half of our party had left, I asked to speak with a manager, who only then (5 minutes later) brought out a little dish with a candle and said something along the lines of, ""Oh thank you for reminding us!""  You're welcome.

2010-03-16,4.0,"I went to one sixtyblue last Thursday for their burger and beer deal.  It was my first time dining at one sixtyblue .   $4 dietzler farm-aged burger (small farm w/ grass fed cows) & $4 craft beer was the deal that attracted me.  There were only two beers to choose from for the price, I believe they were both from the Metropolitan brewery (a local Chicago brewery).  Which is fine by me, I love their beer.   The space is great.  Music wasn't too loud.  The lounge/bar area was full.  I took a peek at the restaurant, and at 7:30, there were only 3 tables, looked sad for such a great place.  Bathrooms were fantastic, nice paper towels and a bowl of little candy things.  Only eye sore were the TVs.  But they were silent, so not a problem. The burger came with a list of add-ons, different cheeses from American to Cypress Grove Truffle Tremor.  Also could add on caramelized onions, mushrooms, or foie gras.  Burger comes on a pretzel roll, with fries, and a fried pickle.  The only thing I could ask for was some aioli or some kind of fatty sauce to go with the fancy burger.  I know it's a 4 buck burger, my suggestion is to add the sauce to the add on list.   (or maybe there was and I didn't see it) The burger was a little over cooked for me.  I ordered medium-rare, same as my friend dining with me.  Her burger was perfectly cooked, mine was closer to med-well.  Wasn't about to send it back, it took over 45 minutes to get the burger from the time we ordered.  Didn't mind the wait, was having a great time drinking beers and chatting.  Although, if I have to wait 45 min for a med-rare burger, you should get it right.  The rest of the bar menu looked great.  I saw duck fat fries among other great bar food.  I would love to return to one sixtyblue to sit at the bar again and to try out their regular in their beautiful dining room.",0.994,0.838,0.147,0.015,0.5864621489621489

2010-03-11,3.0,"Listen up, Recessionistas: one sixtyblue has a Wednesday night Fried Chicken Special for only $8!  The chicken was delicious - perfectly crispy outside, tender meat inside. It was served with a side of spiced waffle (a take on the Southern classic ""Chicken n' Waffles""), fries, and cole slaw. The three pieces of chicken were extremely filling. It was a struggle to finish (a struggle I won, however, as I do not forfeit deliciousness).  An additional $8 gets you a glass of champagne... but we all know that I'm a beer girl at heart. Goose Island is on special for $4.  As for the rest of the beer list - Pricey with a capital P. Now, I get it, beer is going to cost more at a nice restaurant than at my local convenience store. However, when you mark up Bud Light (a ""Traditional beer from St. Louis, Missouri"" - exotic!) to $5, I'm at an eye-rolling level of discontent.

2010-03-10,2.0,"Restaurant Week Review--  This was the finale to my restaurant week tour. The big kahuna, the end all event, a celebration of my bestie's b-day planned much in advance. Overall, I was really looking forward to a special evening out at this much talked about restaurant, and although the company was 5 stars all the way, the food was about 4 stars and the service was maybe 1 star worthy.  Starting with the good- the menu was great. Lots of options to choose from and definitely something for everyone. I enjoyed the Pork Belly gnocchi, although I had never had pork belly so white and it wasn't very fatty, almost bordered more on a pork chop? Just weird. But the gnocchi, oooohh man, sooo big and pillowy, it was excellent! The others at the table had the shrimp appetizer and I did not hear any raves from those folks.  As for the entree, I love my salmon. Perfectly cooked and great sides. My friends did not enjoy their overly mushroomy ravioli and I can't believe the chicken entree was a chicken breast. Seriously? I mean it was tasty but at an upscale restaurant, I would think they would showcase something a little more creative then a hunk of chicken breast.  Desserts were ok. I had the sorbets which I had no clue what flavors I was eating because our waiter never came by so it was more of a guessing game palate cleanser and the cracker was just not working with the sorbet.  Now for the service- I get it, it's Restaurant Week, but geez people, this whole shabang was created because it's a SLOW TIME in the restaurant world. This place was BARELY full at 8pm on a Saturday night and still our waiter treated us like high schoolers at a Steak and Shake. A few of us went with the wine pairings-- which we had to ask for when our food was delivered, without the wine. Also, the waiter never asked if anyone needed another drink and the bus boys ended up doing most of the work. Not to mention that our food was placed down in front of the wrong people and plates weren't cleared very fast. I expected a whole lot better.  To top it all off, at the end of the night we discovered the automatic 20% gratuity for the server tacked on the bill. While I certainly don't mind this, I was never made aware of this while making a reservation and the service was definitely not up to par for a 20% tip.  The moral of this story, I gave it a shot during Restaurant Week and based on my experience, I probably wouldn't come back nor would I recommend people to check out this place.",0.9843,0.855,0.107,0.038,0.5131849206349205
2010-03-10,2.0,"Went to one sixty blue last night for a special tasting event in conjunction with Goose Island Brewery. The other special aspect of the evening is that I was there with my fiancé to celebrate my 30th birthday. We were pretty excited for the beer pairings and the menu looked fantastic.  The food ended up being good but not great. The best part of the evening was getting to hear from the chef and the Goose Island representative between each course to hear about the pairings and the brewing process. I'd never given so much thought to pairing different kinds of beers with particular foods and hope to add these tricks to my own culinary repertoire.  Overall, the service was good though the servers did little more than fill glasses and clear plates since it was a set menu and the narration was provided by the chef and Goose guy. Yet we walked away with quite a bad feeling about our meal for one simple, Molly Ringwaldian reason. They forgot my birthday.  My lovely and loving fiancé called ahead to ask if they would stick a candle in my dessert or do something - she even offered to bring in the cake and/or candle herself. They said they would take care of it and not to worry. She again reminded the hostess during our meal (after faking a bathroom break to step away from the table) and the hostess said they would take care of it. And they forgot. Only after my fiancé went back up to the hostess stand and asked to speak to a manager did someone bring out a hunk of fudge with a candle stuck in it. They came out with this only AFTER we had our regular dessert and only AFTER we had already paid the check. Talk about an afterthought.  I don't so much mind that they forgot, we had a good meal and plenty of great beer, I mind that my fiancé felt bad about not recognizing my birthday. She gave the folks there ample time, notice, and reminders to do something as simple as sticking a candle in a brownie and they blew it. To bring out a second haphazard effort at a dessert with a candle stuck in it makes it even worse. Just apologize for the oversight and buy us a free drink or something but to bring it out after we already paid our check is poor customer service and I doubt we will be back.",0.8662,0.777,0.126,0.097,0.5189203073349417

I had the Pom Delight cocktail to start; it had the perfect ratio of sweetness to alcoholic taste.   To start, our table had the Seared Maine Scallops (perfect texture) and Alaskan King Crab.  I ordered the Wagyu Beef Shortribs for dinner, which I LOVED.  They were not too fatty at ALL, which tends to be the case with shortribs in general.  As side dishes, the table ordered the one sixty blue Hash Brown and Roasted Acorn Squash.  The hash browns come with ""powdered duck fat"" on top.  I'll admit it kind of weirded me out at first, but it was very delicious.  The squash was sweet and creamy.   I would definitely go to one sixtyblue again on either a date or with a group of people.  Its environment is appropriate, comfortable, and upscale for a variety of occasions.",0.9873,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.6733333333333335

2010-03-01,5.0,"Best meal I've ever had. Yet another restaurant week review, but I know I'll be back. First, I should say that I really like the decor of this place. Modern, but not stuffy. Spacious but not cavernous. The bar area was a nice place to wait with lots of nice couches and an attentive bar tender. Service was very good too. The server was excited by Restaurant week - not annoyed by it. Very attentive and informative too. The meal was excellent. Their restaurant week menu looks a lot like their Thursday special menu for a similar price (for those of you who missed out on restaurant week). I highly recommend doing the wine flight pairing with the meal. The wines were all very good and  complemented each course exquisitely.  My first course was the Pork Belly Carbonara. It reminded me of a very high quality and excellently prepared Filipino Lechon. I was worried it would be overly greasy of fatty but it really wasn't. The gnocchi was excellent as well, offering a good starchy contrast to rich pork. Definitely a 5. My second course was the Ravioli. It didn't taste like any other raviloli I've ever had but was excellent. A solid 4. The last course I was a bit worried about. I had the Chocolate Peanut Butter Terrine. I've had bacon and chocolate before and really did not like the combination. But here it worked and it worked well. The chocolate wasn't overly sugared as most deserts and candies are, but actually tasted like chocolate. It was creamy and not too rich. The bits of bacon in there gave the course a salty/sweet quality - kind of like a chococalte covered pretzel. The peanut butter brittle was good too and when eaten with the chocolate was like a warm and delicious peanut butter cup. I love deserts. I've never really had a bad one. But this is the first to really blow me away. Definite 5. The fourth course was the cookie and caramel they give you with the check. The cookie was very soft and the caramel was fresh and gooey. Take both in the same bite and thank me later. This place exemplifies why Restaurant Week is so great. It gives me an excuse to go to a great restaurant and have a mind blowing meal. And looking at their website and regular menu, I know I got a deal, but I also know that a regular meal or weekday special is an option for me to try them again.",0.9994,0.682,0.302,0.016,0.503400666000666

I'm not going to bother rating the decor, ambiance, location, etc (all of which are fine, by the way), but all four of us in my party loved the food. It was our first time there.

My wife had possibly the juiciest and most flavorful chicken I've ever tasted. Our companions had the berkshire pork chop (which was brined and unbelievably delicious) and a very nice crab starter as an entree. I also had the pork belly carbanara as a starter course - outstanding!. We shared three incredible side dishes: root veggies, grits, and squash. All were terrific. And by the way, we also thought the service was excellent.

My entree was the salmon with mashed potato + black trumpet mushrooms. My bf had the chicken dish with sweet potato puree. Both dishes were just ok, nothing memorable.  We were anxiously waiting for desserts as we were wondering whether desserts could turn-around the dining experience. We had key lime panna cotta, and chocolate cake. My panna cotta was awful, awful. it was way too sour, to almost the inedible stage. The sourness was the only thing we could taste.

The quail leg was the tiniest thing I have ever seen, it was almost cute.  For my entree, I had the chicken with sweet potato puree and it was surprisingly a good sized portion. Tasted like Thanksgiving but with chicken because it was so sweet, rich and like something my mom would make. For dessert had the chocolate peanut butter and the key lime panna cotta. Neither were outstanding but the first was better. The flavor in the key lime was SOOO tart it was shocking, in a kinda bad way.   Was disappointed in the cocktail list because all the martinis were super sweet concoctions, so i just ordered a vodka tonic which was fine (what's there to say?).  BF had the ginger martini and i thought it was gross, way too sweet and strong.  One of the best parts was at the end...when they bring the bill, they bring you a caramel and an individually wrapped chocolate chip/peanut butter cookie that is one of the best cookies i have ever had in my life. That was a highlight...sad, but true! The hosts and our waiter were abrupt instead of welcoming, the atmosphere is not cozy/intimate, and you can tell the place was decorated by a man (i commented that i felt i was in a fancy Cheesecake Factory).  Due to those things, I had to dock some points.

Another reviewer mentioned something about salt, however, I think smoked salmon and salt go hand in hand. 3) Scallops- They had a little too much going on for me,but I'm sure most others would like them just fine. I like my food simple. 4) Pork Belly- Oh how I wanted to sample, but I had a ""meat cheat"" day a couple months earlier. It looked (and I guess was) soooo good. Entrees: 1) Salmon- delicious mushrooms, so fresh. 2) Wagyu Short Ribs- husband was raving. 3) Cod- the best of what I had the last visit. My Lord it was tasty. 4) Brussel Sprouts- Loved. Shocked so many restaurants carry these now; I thought they were definitely a no-no for most kids growing up. I've always loved them. 5) Hash browns- They were good, not great. The restaurant's interior is beautiful. When you first enter, there's a gorgeous bar with some lounge tables. Love it. Then a large dining room that is very impressive. I love open kitchens- not only to see the chefs at work, but also less fear of where your food is coming from!!! I definitely want to come try the fried chicken!!",0.9988,0.632,0.336,0.032,0.5974310966810966
2010-01-28,5.0,"Back again for a post opera meal, and I'm going to stick with my 5 stars, again, benefit of the doubt for what I want to rate a 4.5. This is not, however, to take anything away from one sixtyblue.  I started with a house cured salmon, which was good, but salty, served atop hash browns, which were good, but salty, and sprinkled with capers, which were salty - yes. The dish had a little too much salt, but was nicely balanced by some lemon curd, and what appeared to be almost a lemon jelly. Without those moderating elements, I think we would have been in trouble, but the salty sour was a good combo, and the salmon was tasty. Maybe even more lemon curd (who would ever wish for *more* lemon curd) next time. Others had the same salad I enjoyed last time (but now with pomegranate seeds) and a salad of apples and crab. An interesting combo, but really quite good.  My entree was ravioli stuffed with a nice ricotta and topped with chanterelle mushrooms and all atop sauteed spinach. The mushrooms were in a tangy sauce, which I thought was a great touch, not something I had expected at all. The only knock here is that the ravioli were a tad more al dente than I would have preferred. Another diner's aged sirloin steak was good - flavorful, but maybe a bit chewy? It was supposedly aged dry 31 days, so I would expect the flavor, but not necessarily the tooth. Her sides were traditional - a cute twice baked potato and some very good creamed spinach.  And for desert - goat cheese filled, fresh fried donuts dipped in granulated sugar, served with lemon and blackberry dipping sauces, and with a side of what I think was an olive oil custard - odd, but good in context. The rich melty goat cheese with the hot donuts and cold tangy sauces were a great combo.  I cannot end without mentioning that this was another Thursday night, which means good looking (and cheap) burgers in the bar, plus...yes...duck fat french fries served with smoked tomato ketchup, among other things. Thankfully, our server was willing to ""break the rules"" and bring us an order of fries from the bar, even though we were in the dining room, and man, were they good. Fresh cut, skin on, and while I couldn't have told you they were fried in duck fat specifically, I could certainly tell you that there's no vegetable oil in play here. The house made smoked tomato ketchup had a nice depth to it - regular ketchup would have been unfortunate for fries this good.  So, as I opened saying, this is probably a 4.5. A lot of tangy in my meal, but maybe my fault - and I'm so close to the ""oh my goodness"" moment but not quite there...but I give one sixtyblue benefit of the doubt for great service, creativity, and what I feel is pretty reasonable value for an excellent meal.",0.9988,0.73,0.228,0.042,0.579909423909424

And I love it even more when they still treat you with respect and give you good service even though they know you're only there for the dinner special. Such is the case with One Sixtyblue.  A friend and I decided to go here one Wednesday night after I found out about their Wednesday night special: a 3-piece chicken dinner with potato wedges, cole slaw, and (a surprising twist) a piece of waffle all for $8! And you can pair it with a glass of champagne for another $8. The chicken was cooked perfectly and everything was delicious, even the waffle was a nice touch and went great with the chicken and the champagne.  Our waitress was super nice and provided great service. The restaurant has a small but cozy bar area with modern glass decor. Great spot to grab dinner and a drink before heading out for the night.

2010-01-18,3.0,"one sixtyblue is a decent representation of the Charlie Trotter school of dining here in Chicago.  Too much here was as expected, and nothing really stood out for either the wife or myself.  We both went with the table menu, the daily 3-course prix pixe menu  (the special for only $32.)  They had 3 or 4 choices for all 3 courses, but my wife and I both agreed on what we thought were the best options for the 1st course and dessert.   We began our night with cocktails, as usual - a sazerac for myself and a pom special (pomegranate, pear vodka and pineapple) for my wife. She really liked the pom special and stuck with it for the night.  The color was a deep red, bordering on purple and the aroma gave an mysterious tropical illusion.  The rye whiskey used in the sazerac was rather strong and, coupled with the liberal use of absinthe, made for a rather strong drink.  It lacked the proper orange twist.  Needless to say was not the best sazerac I have had.    For starters we had the pork belly carbonara.  The pork belly was a single thin slice, and really should have been called bacon.  The carbonara and gnocchi were good, but the entire dish seemed far less rich than either of us had expected.  We had recently had pork belly at both Spring and Boka and and tonights did not wow us.  Good, but not inspiring. I finished my sazerac and ordered a corpse reviver #2.  I liked that they use north shore gin, but the table shaken cocktail service seems to cause a downfall.   I have had this drink at a few other places, including In Fine Spirits, and know that this should be made with a glass rinsed in absinthe.  At one sixtyblue they forgo the rinse due to the table-side service and put the absinthe in the shaker.  It left the drink with a far too heavy anise flavor that did not do the gin justice. For mains I ordered the duck breast, served med-rare over sauteed spinach.   The flavors were great, but the textures all blended together.  A piece of crispy duck fat would have gone a long way.  My wife ordered with chanterelle ravioli, which was good, but slightly more al dente than my wife preferred.   For dessert we both got the chocolate peanut butter something-or-another.  It was a combination of dense chocolate cake, peanut brittle and vanilla foam.  It was by far the highlight of the night.  Everything else was average, but this was a standout.   A decent dinner and given the special menu worth the price.  Nothing was out-stand but overall a good night out in the west loop.",0.9963,0.805,0.157,0.039,0.5113782051282052

Modern and open interior; not uber-minimalist or alienating, with a wide open kitchen.  We got there early but were seated immediately and greeted by very attentive and knowledgeable staff.  After hemming and hawing, we threw caution into the wind and put our fate in hands of the chef for the seven course tasting...good call. Aah yes, not to forget the main event... uniformly harmonious, innovative, and paired to perfection with accompanying wines, we enjoyed every last morsel of food.  Not to mention that every round landed us each a different dish so really we ended up tasting a total of eleven different items by swapping plates midway through each course. A-list (please do not die or move away from Chicago without first eating): 1) Pork Belly Carbonara. Caramelized thick bacon with liquefied fat center.  Trust us on this one - paired with the succulent and perfectly resilient potato gnocchi, pork lovers will be tempted to will their first-born or sell their soul at a chance for seconds. 2) Wagyu Sirloin Flap Steak. Cooked to perfection with med-rare, pink center on some nummy, marinated and mildly spiced cabbage.  Super match with the alcoholic, almost syrupy intensity of the Trefethen cab. 3) Berkshire Pork Chop. This is incredibly tender and savory pork cheek with a slightly crispy crust, atop home-made sauerkraut (ordinarily I'm not a fan of the kraut, but I'm now officially converted).  Man those cheeks just bust out with flavor and moisture. 4) Alaskan King Crab.  This is warm crabmeat atop a cool, sweet salad consisting of shredded apples, cranberries, and cinnamon in a creamy, rich base.  Wonderfully fresh crab and paired up with a sweet German riesling - not being fans of anything but dry wines this was a match that we wouldn't have experienced if left to tour own devices. Lots of other amazing courses across the spectrum but I don't want to spoil the surprise.  Just know that if you go and either get the tasting or choose from among the four options above that you will be very happy. The night zipped by and only 3 hours later we found ourselves finishing up with two superb dessert courses and ready for the damage.  This is what's really interesting and why OSB gets 5 stars - price.  Seven courses, all done well, for $75pp; add the paired wines at $35p and you get a really memorable experience without totally breaking the bank like you'd do at some many other places serving up at a similar level of quality.  So for quality to price ratio, you just can't beat it. This would be a great place to bring a larger group too because of the extensive menu.  Something or everyone, while maintaining this kind of quality across the spectrum....gotta wonder how they can do it.",0.9991,0.766,0.22,0.014,0.5376865671641791

You get two large pieces of white-meat chicken that aren't greasy at all! I don't know how the chefs accomplished that but once you bite in all you get is tender, juicy goodness - the way it ought to be! The two biscuits are tiny but delicious! They taste even better with the sweetened butter that it comes with. The Asian slaw is refreshing and a nice contrast to the potato wedges and biscuits.  We made quite the scene digging into our large pieces of chicken breast and scooping up every last bite of that asian slaw. I think I saw the bartender look over at us in digust a few times. But hey, when fried chicken is on the line, there's no stopping. The real dangerous part was the champagne. I think each of us went through three glasses each so our ""cheap"" girls' night out ended up being a little more than we had anticipated but the waitress brought out an order of thesticky toffee date cake for my birthday - which was really nice.

Carlos was our server and he was amazing! Both him and another waiter were very helpful in explaining all the food, making sure we were okay. The manager came by to introduce himself and walked by another time to make sure things were going well. The chef came otu to talk to the table next to us about their tasting menu. I made a  530pm RSVP and told them I needed to be out by the game and they were great about timing everything well and taking care of us. Decoration: There is a modern wave like theme thru the entire building and it is very beautiful with the private room seperated but flows well with the bar and main eating area. The bathrooms were great near the bar and had  door you went thru before going thru the gender doors to the specific bathroom. They had nice mini bowls of mints placed thru the building. The kitchen was an open area space off the main dining room and very well run. Food: you order all your food at once and then they timed it perfectly. The food came out super fast and in great order. The white wine came out right away and the red one came out with the steak as ordered. The bread bowl was very original with regular bread, then cheese and herb thin pita bread, and then also cayenne pepper other type of pita bread. The butter was a great texture and was pickle butter. That came out right away and within 10 mins the appeitizers came out. We got the scallops (seared maine scallops with baby carrots, carrot cardamom puree, and sea beans) and the pork belly (pork belly carbonara with potato gnocchi, caramelized red onion, cracked black pepper...). The scallops were great large, and came with a wonderful sauce (2 large ones per order) than the pork belly was perfectly cooked. It was a bit salty for my taste but the potatoes and sides on it made it great. All the veggies came out well! Main course came out few mins after we finished the appeitizers (we were aiming for a 1.5 hr dinner). One of us got the 31 day aged steak (31-day aged new york sirloin: truffled twice baked potatos, matsutake mushrooms, and creamed spinach) which was a huge slab of meat cooked medium rare as we ordered. The double cooked potato was very good with the steak and creamed spinach. The steak was a bit chewy on the ends but in the middle was melt in your mouth meat. Since the slab was huge it didn't matter that you needed to cut the outside out and we both didn't finish all our food. J thought his steak was 12ozs... We ordered a side of squash which came out with a creamy and very sweet texture that was not stringy at all. I ordered the special that day which was a steak with mashed potatoes (AMAZING) and was crispy on the outside and great on the inside. It came as three huge pieces and I def did not expect it to be that big. If it had been one piece it would have been okay for a place that was that nice.  We didn't get dessert but they had amazing little take aways. They gave us a dessert amuse which was pretty tart on botttom but a nice vanilla foam. It looked like a citrus mini boba drink with the seeds on the bottom. We got 2 caramels (melt in your mouth and you don't want to put wrapper anywhere) and 2 pieces of gingerbread (okay..not the greatest) desserts to take away. Parking: the parking lot is not connect to the other buildings in the area and it is a bit hard to catch a cab since its the end of the street and semi odd place for cabs to pass by.

All seemed like very friendly conversations - laughing, smiling.  6) Every table of diners that I could see seemed to be happy with their experience as well.  7) The dessert we had -- brown sugar/apples/stout vanilla ice cream/ cake -- was tremendous. Upon finishing the meal they also brought us to-go snacks - root beer caramel and a mini loaf of ginger bread.  I ate them this morning. Both item still tasted fresh and melted in my mouth.

As my mom put it, the hasbrowns were greasy and tasted like...regular old hashbrowns with salty onions. The pheasant was very tender but was bland and the only discernible flavor it had was mushroom. The grits it lay on were ""meh"" but at least helped to dial down the darn mushroom.  Ironically, my waitperson said this was the best dish on the menu. If that's the case I may never go back. One thing I will say for one sixty, it's a hot date spot. Great ambiance and staff. However, if my hunny bunny brought me to this spot, the only thing that would keep me from doing a one eighty right out the door is that damned date cake.",0.986,0.827,0.137,0.036,0.5399299113584829
2009-10-21,4.0,"File this under: Quick hits to revisit. I spent roughly two hours at One Sixty Blue this evening. I went for the fried chicken and champagne special ($8 for a dinner of the best fried chicken your mom never made, drop biscuits, slaw and potato wedges, and $8 per glass of Moet Brut Imperial.) I yea'ed the chicken, nayed the bubbly, opting instead for a dirty Hendricks martini or two. Three things: Food--That chicken deal, only in the bar, is amazing, and well worth the  pittance you pay. (To be fair, I'm easy. My people come from the South, but my Nana married young, bred early and often, and worked 10 hour days to boot. She didn't have time to be some stereotypical hereditary repository of culinary excellence. Her fried chicken? It was cooked through, and may have involved salt, possibly pepper. Nothing to write Frank Bruni about.) Crisp skin and juicy meat. Those birds were clearly brined. Excellent chicken, slaw that's just the right blend of fresh creaminess and tart crunch, fluffy little biscuits with honey butter. Honestly, the potato wedges weren't special, but what potato wedges are? Staff--From hostess to servers to manager, were attentive and courteous from start to finish, and accommodated our divided checks without complaint. Nothing but praise for them. Drinks--So the food is good, and the martinis were, too, though the dirtiness I requested (very dirty, blue cheese olives) must have completely nullified the typically herb-heavy Hendricks. I'd try those again, dry, with plain pimentos and Hendricks just to see how they'd fare with tougher 'tini 'teria. Or I'd go for another cocktail. The signature list is okay, the whisky selection is very good. Think Oban, Lagavulin. Plus a grappa, some sherry, the usual mix. If I lived in the 'hood, I'd be be well pleased by One Sixtyblue and its neighbor across the street. It'll likely get the final star next time I return for a la carte dining.",0.9968,0.771,0.21,0.019,0.6109809523809524

I did not try a single thing that I didn't absolutely love (especially the ceviche, and the ahi tuna---and PLEASE treat yourself to the chocolate souffle!!). My friend said it best, ""This food is so yummy I never want to leave.""  I totally agree with her.  There is a wonderful wine list that takes an eternity to skim through.  I half expected our server and the staff to be pretentious, but they were as nice as can be, and very helpful.  Despite our pricey bottle of wine, our bill was much lower than I anticipated.  I am definitely ready to go back.

2009-10-15,5.0,"Apparently I have unknown treasures of patience. I took me 8 months to go back for a REAL dinner. I must be busier than I thought...or more broke...not sure. Well it must have been all for the better because last night was a perfect time to enjoy the fall bounties the kitchen had to offer. Chilly, windy, drizzly.....just warm me up and bring the goodies please! I arrived early and sat down in the lounge room for a seasonal cocktail....Bacardi limon, Frangelico and black mission figs did the trick. Definitely on the sweet side (usually not my thing) but this time it hit the spot. I had to share the room with a bunch of loud and obnoxious businessmen who thought they were the kings of the world, or at least the floor. Standing there, laughing at their lame jokes and blocking all access to the bathroom. I was looking at them with a fixed intensity, hoping to make them: a. disappear in thin air b. fly across the room thanks to my Wonder Woman super powers. They must have been scared after a while and chose to leave for the dining room on their own. We followed them in after a little while but were lucky enough to sit at the opposite side of the room. Sometimes it does help to have a killer stare... Our meal was nothing short of fantastic: - Pork belly carbonara: potato gnocchi, caramelized red onion, cracked black pepper. Crispy belly. Good and creamy, super yummy (even for me - the non-porky gal) - Alaskan King Crab salad: honeycrisp apples, cranberries, cinnamon, crispy rice chip(s). Good and refreshing. A nice autumn dish with a very strong crab taste that might unsettle some but just seduced me. The apple julienne was just delightful. - Braised pheasant: savoy cabbage, wild mushrooms, stone ground grits. Two preparations for that winner of a dish: the tender breast was rolled in the cabbage and cut in slices; the thighs were confit duck style. Black trumpets, creamy grits - perfection on a plate. Really. Of course we also tried two of their staples: the onesixtyblue hashbrowns with caramelized shallots, duck fat powder and parmesan cheese (yummy when you get everything in one bite) and their luscious sticky toffee date cake that comes with sesame brittle and frozen yogurt. I tasted fall the other night, and it was definitely delicious. Great job Michael.",0.9969,0.707,0.219,0.075,0.5591550925925927
2009-10-10,2.0,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago ... went last night after a long hiatus and was very disappointed. The food tried to live up to the expense of the place but just didn't deliver -- the plating was a complete mess and the flavors didn't come together. Ordered the halibut with brussel sprouts and some sort of puree which was cold and just so-so. the steak had a great smokiness to it but should have been offset by some other flavor. The drinks were just awful but did the trick in liquor content. I will say that the service is awesome! Our server replaced a drink we didn't care for immediately and my food was re-heated. The chocolate cake was delicious although the hazelnuts were over toasted and tasted like bacon!

The mushrooms were not your typical button mushrooms, but meatier & more organic mushrooms. I had no idea what kind they were, but I did enjoy. Ryan liked his as well. The truffle cheese didn't really taste like truffles, but more like blue cheese. I'm not the biggest blue cheese fan, so this was kind of a disappointment. I didn't stop eating. I don't give up. By the time I ate half of my burger (these baby's are HUGE!) the place had filled up. I mean pretty packed.

I tried the pork chop and strip steak. Both great. For sides we all split the mashed potatoes (tasted just like my dads!), cucumber salad and hash-browns.

This fabulous restaurant has the understated coolness of restaurants that perpetually make you feel like you're too young to dine there.  That is until the sommelier greets you warmly and invites you to your table close to the kitchen so you can check out the action.

We noticed the prices are mostly in the $20's, which is lower than we expected given the raves we had heard.

I wish I could tell the readers all the items that they presented to me and my wife (most times we did not actually get the same item, so we could taste 1/2 of our own and switch so we could taste/experience each others).

I can truly say that the food was incredible!  Out of 4, 3 of us did the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Although the tasting menu says ""5 courses,"" we essentially had 7 courses! As the night went out, the food got more and more amazing, however the service did not. But first, lets talk about the food, we started with a soup course to wake up our palettes and it was absolutely delicious. The other interesting thing that the chef does is he creates different tasting menus for male and female diners. So, to get the full experience I would definitely recommend taking a date of the opposite sex with you. You can also say this is very romantic as you can feed each other the different foods you are being served. I would highly recommend this delectable tasting menu!!! The service on the other hand was not quite as consistent. We had an early dinner reservation at 6:30 and at that time, as you can probably imagine, the restaurant was only about 1/2 full and the servers were quite attentive. By the time desert rolled around, the restaurant was pretty full by this point and the wait staff just looked overwhelmed. We noticed this when we had to ask twice for a glass of wine to be brought to the table. Since the tasting menu was not pre-selected, they came by and presented each course to us along with the wine. By desert, it would take them 5 mins for someone to come by and explain what we were having. By that point, we were digging in and 1/2 way through the course!  The restaurant definitely redeemed themselves when they sent us home with a printed out copy of the tasting menu we had that night along with each of the wine pairing and they also sent us home with home made lemon pound cakes for breakfast the next day!!!

Well, at least not in my skyscraper heels. The space is open, spacious and elegant. I was a bit embarrassed smuggling in 2 wine bottles in a huge handbag, but it was the last Friday of the month which means... BYO* at one sixtyblue! It's so rare to find a restaurant of this caliber offering a BYO option so of course we had to take it. Yes ma'am! The sommelier is such a knowledgeable man, and quite charming too! We talked organic wines, sulfites, soil (so we wandered a bit off track) as well as his suggested pairings for our selected courses.  Food: I had the smoked chicken chorizo gumbo to start. So different than a gumbo you'd find in New Orleans (our server agreed), but I really enjoyed the depth and the complexity of the flavors. Rich, smoky and spiced relevantly. A win. For my main course, I selected the blue crab ravioli (ricotta, spinach and lemon brown butter). Based on the description alone, I just knew I had to have it. Simple yet rich but not excessively so. My dining companions had the Wagyu short ribs and the grilled hanger steak. Now the Wagyu is the definite star of the show (hint, hint!), but the hanger steak was surprisingly tender! Both were cooked perfectly... and the Wagyu's accompanying creamy grits were dreamy. We passed on dessert but were still treated to one sixtyblue's signature mini poundcakes and housemade vanilla caramels to take home Presentation was gorgeous, service impeccable... and affordable especially given the quality of the food! And, most importantly, my two 'San Francisco foodie/weekends in Napa' friends loved it. If that's not a test, I don't know what is. Thanks one sixtyblue for making me look good! *Note: Please ask them if they're still offering the BYO on the last Fri. of the month when making a reservation...

2009-02-25,4.0,"Definite eye candy and palate pleaser. Checked out this restaurant during Restaurant Week after always hearing the name thrown around in various conversations.  After reading yelp reviews I definitely had high expectations and was definitely excited to try it out.  This place is very simply decorated, very contemporary modern and classy. Food was great- just as expected.   Appetizers:  Leek gnocci- awesome.  very light and fluffy and full of flavor.  a great starter course. Gumbo- good, nothing out of the ordinary.  first i have to say, i've never had gumbo before, but i expected a lot of flavor and different level of spices, which i did not get here. Entrees: Chicken and Biscuits- very flavorful and moist.  my friend thought it was a tad on the salty side, but i thought it was flavored ok.  i'm not much of a chicken person so it's probably not something i would order again, but those who do will probably like this dish. Seared Salmon- it's interesting.  the first half of my dish was pretty good.  toward the middle, the salmon was a little raw. i mentioned it to the waitress and she told me the chef cooks it that way so that you get the most flavor.  it's also sashimi grade so it's totally safe to eat. i dunno.  i still thought it was a little too fishy.  and i like my fish either cooked all the way or not cooked at all.  the half cooked- half raw is weird for me. Hangar Steak- YUM! Definitely the best entree of the three selections.  I'm a steak kind of girl and this definitely hit the spot.  The mashed potatoes were good but the sauteed veggies were awesome- so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  this was a meal that you need to get a little bit of everything on your fork to really enjoy the dish- a bit of steak, potatoes, and veggies with sauce.  great balance of saltiness and texture from the steak, creaminess of potatoes, and the bite and tang of the veggies.  i definitely kept trying to steal my husband's portions of this dish and would order this again and again. Dessert: Date Cake- my husband read reviews on this and insisted everyone at the table get this.  it definitely was very good and the flavor grew on you as you continued to eat it.  but for variety i got the Chocolate Panna Cotta- which was awesome.  I dont like straight up sweet desserts so this was perfect.  the panna cotta was very creamy and rich, but the shaved chocolate underneath offered a great bitterness that played down the richness and made it all just melt in your mouth.  3 out of the 4 at the table liked this more than the date cake, though they still also liked the date cake. Everything was plated very beautifully- i'm a big believer that presentation matters almost as much as taste.  Drinks were a little bit pricier than other restaurants, but nothing ridiculous.  Regular prices aren't bad either.  service was ok, perhaps a little slow.  one of our waiters i thought was slightly snooty, the other waiter was very nice and friendly.  i would definitely come here on a non-restaurant week day.",0.9995,0.711,0.27,0.019,0.5550612818967249
2009-02-24,3.0,"Restaurant week: a good way to guarantee that the waitstaff is going to treat you condescendingly and to spend more money than you expect.  With that in mind, I set out to find a restaurant week experience that would still be worth it. thanks, one sixtyblue, for a lovely and worthwhile evening overall. We were seated by the window, with a view of...the occasional passing car. Even the waiter pointed out the unremarkable nature of the view. He also mentioned that the Denver Nuggets were in the night before, which I'm pretty sure was supposed to impress me. I'm guessing they didn't have to sit by the the cold window. It does have a lovely atmosphere--not too dark, not too loud (in fact, I could often hear a little bit too much about the economic woes of Dubai from a nearby table...good to know that we both read the same New York Times article.) I was pleasantly surprised by the flatbread, which is almost always disappointing as a bread basket selection. Don't be afraid of the pickle butter, which does not taste much like pickles. The leek gnocchi was the standout starter--delicate and delicious. The chicken chorizo gumbo was tasty as well, but mostly I wished that I was still eating the gnocchi. Chicken & biscuits and hangar steak were the two entree selections. I started with the chicken and biscuits. Overall, the dish was a bit on the salty side, but the chicken was tender and moist. By the time I swapped dishes with my husband and got the hangar steak, it was a bit...on the cold side. He says that it was warm when it was served...I find it likely that it had been sitting a bit (another peril of restaurant week). Temperature aside, it still was pretty delectable. I appreciated the portion sizes of both plates, which seemed reasonable for a normal (hungry) person to enjoy.  Our waiter recommended the sticky toffee date cake, so we ordered this and the chocolate panna cotta. I can't emphasize the excellence of the date cake strongly enough. If you're going with a friend, forego your rule about not ordering the same thing and order two of the date cakes. Order one to go, or distract a neighboring table and take theirs. (The panna cotta was fine or maybe even good, but simply couldn't compete with the surprising awesomeness of the date cake.)  The night ended with some pound cake to take home (a nice touch) and a medical emergency at a nearby table (to which the staff responded quickly, and the diner was OK.) Valet is super fast as they have their own parking lot...feels a bit ridiculous to pay $7 to watch the attendant move your car 5 feet, but options are limited.",0.9918,0.796,0.15,0.054,0.5728722409277965
2009-02-23,4.0,"So after living in the neighborhood for 7+ years, I'm not sure why I never made it to One SixtyBlue. To start restaurant week off right, we decided to try someplace new to us and made reservation for Friday night.  I had just come off a 15 hour flight and 20+ hours of travelling so we decided to make the reservation for 5:30, which is the earliest I have ever eaten dinner....well other than our ridiculously early Polish holiday meals that are typically at 2:00 PM!   I ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu and had the Leek Gnocchi, Hanger Steak, and Sticky Toffee Date Cake.  The Leek Gnocchi were light & delicious, but some bites were a bit too salty for me.  The Hanger Steak was served with fingerling potatoes, wild mushrooms, onions, and smoked sausage. The steak itself was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The accompaniments were equally as good, especially the subtle smoked sausage. Audrey went with the Raw Beet Ravioli as her starter, which was delicious. As was her Pork Chop which was served with Sauerkraut and Crispy Potato Noodles.  We finished the night by splitting the Sticky Toffee Date Cake.  I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but recently I have been really liking non chocolate desserts. I mean this date cake was delicious! The cake was served just a bit warm with a scoop of ice cream. Yum! The space is beautiful! It's warm, comfortable, and totally relaxing.  It seems that this restaurant was designed prior to the ultra modern fad that has seemed to influence every restaurant in Chicago over the past 5 years.  The service was equally as impressive. Our server was knowledgeable, the sommelier/manager was extremely friendly, and even our bus staff was on the money.  It took me 7 years to make my first trip to One SixtyBlue, but my second trip will most likely be in the next few months if not sooner.

We went last night for Restaurant Week.  I had pretty high expectations after hearing all of the rave reviews.  I was preparing for a let down after our server greeted us and said (in a monotone voice), ""You here for Restaurant Week?""  I was kind of bothered because it seemed like he was annoyed that people would be there for the promotion.  Maybe it was just the way he talks or trying to be professional, or maybe an off night?  Not sure.  He was not too keen on giving recommendations either.  Fortunately, that was the only thing about the night that I didn't love.  The service ended up being attentive without being overbearing and the meal was paced perfectly. I decided to start with their monthly classic cocktail offering, the sidecar.  It was so delicious, I contemplated ordering a second before I realized I would most likely end up on the floor.  My bf offered to carry me out. Sweet, but I decided to save my ""that girl"" moment for another time and go for a glass of pinot noir.  Our second server recommended the Loring over the Oyster Bay.  The Loring was almost twice the price, but I was really happy after my sidecar so I caved.  It was good, but I probably would have been just as happy with the Oyster Bay. So now, the food.  We started with the leek gnocchi and the chicken chorizo gumbo.  The gumbo was very good, but the licking of the plate came into play with the gnocchi.  OMG, it was unbelievable!  For entrees, we went with the hangar steak and the chicken & biscuits.  Now, I'm not a huge chicken fan, but when they put biscuits and foie gras sauce with it, I'm sold, two of my favorite things all in one place!  Also, bonus chicken nuggets on the side.  Brilliant.  Both entrees were amazing.  The hibiscus tapioca served before dessert was also very tasty.  To top it off, we went with the chocolate panna cotta and the sticky toffee date cake.  The cake was incredible, especially paired with the clementines, mascarpone cream and pear.  Yum.  I was so full but couldn't stop eating.

2009-02-18,5.0,"I have dined at one sixtyblue several times before, but not since their new chef Michael MacDonald redesigned the menu.  I had always enjoyed it - but today - the experience was on a whole different level.  There seems to be a new energy in the whole restaurant, and it is all coming from the large, pristine open kitchen.   My friends and I arrived a little after 5 and had a cocktail in the lounge.  Though we didn't order anything off the bar menu, we did take a look to see what had changed.  The offerings are very approachable; classic American with a twist, like house fried pickles- so fabulous!).    We sat at a table in the middle of the dining room and were introduced to our wonderful server Nathalie.  She is hands-down one of the best servers I have ever had.  She knew the menu inside and out, and was able to talk about the details and minutia of anything we asked for.    She also had a couple of one-liners that had us rolling.    As we were there to sample the new menu, we all decided to share appetizers and each ordered a different entree.   After ordering our wine (the wine list is still one of the best in the city) a basket of house made bread was brought to the table along with pickle butter.  Yes, it sounds sort of gross - but it was amazing (why the pickles, you ask? The space used to be pickle factory, so Chef MacDonald is paying homage to the past of the space).    We ordered the squid ink risotto (perfectly prepared with basil and parmesan, topped with a chili oil marinated and grilled scuttle fish - the little heat from the scuttle fish was a nice balance to the rich risotto ), leek gnocchi (fabulous little light pillows with the slightest hint of truffle) and the one sixtyblue hash browns with caramelized shallot, duck fat powder and a generous serving of foi gros that tasted so rich and sinful.    We then moved on to our four entrees.  1.  The most perfect wagyu short rib that just melted in your mouth on top of hand-ground grits from Virginia - which are some of the best I've tasted.   2.  Scottish Salmon over a purple potato puree  - the salmon was perfectly cooked with a lovely crust on the bottom - and was covered with this very finely diced pickled vegetable mixture that provided a great counterbalance to the buttery salmon.  3.  Grilled Hanger steak with pureed fingerling potatoes, wild mushrooms and smoked Italian sausage -  the steak was cooked perfectly and was amazingly tender and 4.  Chicken and Biscuits - the chicken was prepared two ways:  a ""chicken nugget"" of sorts - but very high end, with lots of great flavors, a roasted piece of chicken (I believe it was a small breast, but I don't know for sure) and two house-made biscuits that were flaky and buttery and lovely.   Though the entrees were filling, there wasn't copious amounts of food - we were left feeling full, but not stuffed.  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground at many restaurants, but one sixtyblue succeeded.   Our entrees were followed by an amuse-bouche of hibiscus infused tapioca, a sparkling soda, and a grapefruit sorbet that you drink like a bubble tea.  It was a bit too strong for some of the people at my table (grapefruit is something that not everyone enjoys, and hibiscus can be quite strong if you've never had it before) but it really did completely cleanse our palettes and prepare us for dessert.  I am never usually a huge dessert person - I am always more savory than sweet, and if I go for something sweet, I usually do a spice/fruit option rather than chocolate.   After Chef MacDonald joined, a new pastry chef also joined in the revitalization of one sixtyblue.  And though she is only 24, we were all blown away by all of the desserts we ordered.  This time, we only ordered three.      1.  Brown butter carrot cake with a gingersnap ice cream sandwich -  if I could have bought a case of the ice cream sandwiches, I would have.  it was just outstanding.  The ice cream was so rich and perfectly spiced, the cookie itself was buttery and had the perfect crunch.  The carrot cake itself tasted like Christmas.  2.  Roasted Apple and Quince doughnuts with buttermilk ice cream - the combination of the  fabulous little beignets with a dollop of apple butter in the center, a little bit of the buttermilk ice cream and some of the warm, roasted apples - divine! and the best dessert of all 3.  Chocolate panna cotta with a chocolate peanut butter fudge and espresso ice cream.  I don't even know how I can describe this.  I am generally not a fan of panna cotta (it always seems to be more like flan than I would like) but this was the perfect texture and decadently dense.  The fudge was also dense but was cut with the perfect amount of salt, and the espresso ice cream?  The texture was rich and creamy, just perfect - and the flavor was intense, but not too intense.   So impressed -  there is a new energy and taste at one sixtyblue!",0.9997,0.76,0.219,0.021,0.6136168991502323

They could've been more generous with the wasabi, though, because I really needed more to balance out the sweetness of the pineapple sauce underneath. I thought the heart of palm went very well with the fish.  -My friend's porkchop was slightly overcooked making it tough and chewy. I wasn't a fan of the crisp potato noodle, either. It was slimy.  -Nearly all the guys ordered the rack of lamb and raved about it. I didn't try it but it was also recommended by our waiter so I think it's a safe bet.  Wine: Rebenhof Riesling 2007.

Art on a plate.  Service was fantastic except for one small hiccup. I ordered scotch in a tumbler and the waiter brought back my scotch in a brandy glass.  The only other very minor check mark against our wonderful dinner was the dessert. We ordered the Chocolate Panna Cotta, which was a delicious selection of coffee and chocolate deserts on a plate.

They were a bit over the top and got in the way of the creamy fudge and ice creams. you had to finish chewing them up when you just wanted a little more fudge. It was still delicious, more of a texture thing I suppose.  My wife and I will definitely go back.  Kirk out.",0.9959,0.74,0.26,0.0,0.6142571428571428
2009-01-18,4.0,"My friend and I had an early dinner here after the opera matinee on a weekday.  It's a short taxi ride west from the Lyric Opera House and the nearby train stations. The setting and service was welcoming and professional.  The bar seating area is contemporary but cozy.  The server brought shakers and poured our martinis at our sofas.  She decided my friend's wasn't quite full enough so she went back to the bar and brought more. They weren't busy so perhaps they had more time to wait on us, but the entire staff was just terrific.  Our meal was delicious.  I had a wonderfully presented fish, and was thrilled to find cheese grits available as a side.  My friend had a pork chop, equally good.  They have a new chef as of August 2008.  Guess I'd describe the menu as upscale electic American comfort.  Wonderful presentations, delicious flavors and a broad enough selection that everyone should find something they like.  Where else do you find chicken and biscuits on a menu with Hawaiian yellow fin?  Dress is business casual; would be a great place for a special dinner for two, or a fun outing with friends who like to experience beautifully prepared fresh food.",0.9979,0.674,0.326,0.0,0.5468729502820412

The food was amazing - particularly the potato leek soup and the lamb. Another person in our party had the lobster risotto, and she said that was exquisite, too.  The interior is calm and modern. Each table felt private.  Probably one of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago. My only concern is that it's a little off the beaten path - not sure how easy it is to access from CTA.

The tables are not placed too close together, so there was enough privacy--something that is often lacking at a nice restaurant these days.  I'm surprised it wasn't more crowded.  They have a cute little bar and lounge area at the front of the restaurant.

The goat cheese dish was a total miss. The bread was hard and the goat cheese was neither warm nor cold and in small portion. The pork tenderloin starters I got were excellent. Highly recommended (good amount of grilled fat , really tender and tasty). The duck breast were slightly undercooked and not grilled enough. They also lacked a good sauce or something to go with it.  The wine was really disappointing. I ordered a Lalande Pomerol (2002) which are usually really good and it was relatively flat-tasting.  The dessert was good (coconut dessert) especially the nougatine-tasting bottom. It probably could have used something to counter balance the coconut taste. We were ""treated"" with a pastry & chocolate as a parting gift. The chocolate was just ok. The madeleine should probably not be called ""madeleine"". It was undercooked, underpuffed, too sweet (probably invert sugar). This place would be good as a regular restaurant but it can't quite achieve its attempted higher-end billing.

Everyone from the waiter to the hostess is sincerely happy and glad to serve you with a smile. The ambiance is perfect and quiet.  No bad choices here. Bouillabaisse, suckling pig, steak, fish, and deserts were all well made and beautifully presented. I found the steak too salty which was a disappointment, but it was still delicate and delicious. the fried potato balls were so good we ordered them twice. I can say 160 Blue is equal to Everest in food quality and presentation. I would have ordered all their deserts, but we were just too stuffed. We shared three: the banana thing, the peach thing and the Napoleon thing. Thing-licious. The portions are small, but enough. With tip and no wine you will drop about $80/per person.

2008-07-08,5.0,"Mmm scrumptious. Mmm delumptious. I still have dreams about my dining experience at this place. Dinner started off with a cocktail. A perfectly chilled, fresh fruit blueberry martini. Appetizers followed. If you eat here for dinner, you MUST order an item  on  the cheese from the wood oven section of the menu. I had a taste of the great hill blue cheese, camembert affine and capriole farm herbed goat cheese. All had distinguished varying combinations of temperatures and textures with playful sweet, sour and savory flavors. For my main course, I had the beautifully cooked beef tenderloin. It melted in my mouth. The sides were pretty good too. Wilted greens with a non-vampire friendly garlic confit rounded out the meal well with a potato type vegetable called a sunchoke. This paired well with a cab, to which I didn't get the name of...(deduct my ""useful"" points here.) Despite the fact that I was beyond full at this point in the meal, I forged forward toward my dessert - the coconut crunch. What is a coconut crunch you ask? A coconut mousse with a macadamia nut crisp, really cool looking and tart, but refreshing lime foam with sprinkles of fresh pineapple. Not a chocolate lovers fantasy, but a really great alternative - very light. But wait there's more!  Dessert continues even after you leave the restaurant. Freshly baked madeleines (in all of their ""fat free"" butterlicious goodness) are provided in mini packaging to take home with you as a sort of dessert doggie bag. On a full disclosure side note to my possible bias - this was a work expensed meal and free food always tastes better.

Wow, were we impressed. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable.  Our waiter put up with countless questions and actually had meaningful and helpful responses (unlike most restaurants where you can pretty much count on the recommendation for the more expensive items on the menu). Although the four of us were tempted by many of the same dishes, we all tried something different and tried each others.  My cod was perfectly cooked and, although it appeared to be a small portion, I was more than satisfied without feeling overly full.  I heard rave reviews about the veal tenderloin and the beef tenderloin as well.   The cheese appetizer was also good.  This is definitely the place to go if you're a stinky cheese fan.  I'm not particularly but could still appreciate the dish.   Dessert was also incredible.  This sounds strange but the coconut dessert tasted like the most amazing granola bar I've ever had - AND I LOVE GRANOLA! One recommendation - if you're heading here and have a car, you really should drive.  It's a little ways out and the valet parking will be much less expensive than cab fare.",0.989,0.782,0.187,0.03,0.5551470588235294

The decor is chic and modern without being stuffy, a blend of formal but casual where you can arrive well dressed but never feel snobby. The service is very good and the wine selection is more than adequate but what really sells this place is the food. There are many nouveaux-style french-american restaurants in Chicago, but none execute as perfectly as one sixtyblue. I have never had a dish here I did not absolutely love, and the mashed potatoes (you'd think a trivial aspect right?) are unbelievable. A great place to take a date without breaking the bank, while the cuisine is on par with some of the top restaurants in the city (Tru, MK, The City (Cite)), the slightly more casual atmosphere indicates you wont need to take out a second mortgage and accurately so. While it is by no means cheap, it is reasonable enough where I have no qualms about dining there somewhat regularly.

2008-06-16,3.0,"Cool area (Greektown, I guess), and a remarkably upscale restaurant.  It was billed on Chowhound as casual fine dining (unlike Tru or Alinea), so I thought it would be more hipster with a pedigree.  It was just fine dining.  We went entirely fish, which all was good but complicated.  The tuna carpaccio was on a parmesan shortbread, while traditional carpaccio has just the parmesan shaved on top, and the simplicity of the traditional would have been just as good or better and way less complicated.  The halibut had a pea terrine, and a pureed pure green pea reduction would have been simpler and maybe better.  The scallops were on a coconut milk risotto, which was good, but an even more austere Asian-style risotto would have been easier.  So the chef is working hard, but could serve amazing food with less work.  I do think less is more.  Gary Danko, while not always perfect, achieves that simplicity a fair chunk of the time.  The chef seemed like a really nice guy, actually, and the food was inventive, but slightly lighter would achieve a more sublime result.  But it was good.  I guess I just prefer simpler and less complicated (see my review of Avec). The wines we had were delicious.  The server was the nicest guy, really sweet, but the service was so erratic.  I didn't mind:  it was sincere and nice, but let's just say that Gary Danko wouldn't like that either.  (It's not the server's fault.  I liked him.  He had the same nice-guy quality of the folks at Gary Danko, but that seamless quality?

2008-05-14,4.0,"Loved it.  My date and I went on a Saturday and were seated at the beautiful bar for a few minutes waiting for a table.  When I ordered a rather frou-frou cocktail (the bluetini, with blueberry syrup and champagne), my girlfriend made fun of me the bartender quickly jumped to my defense, noting that a member of the '85 Bears orders it whenever he comes in.  When our table was ready, the maitre'd carried our martinis to the table for us!  Just a couple of examples of the awesome service here. Our server immediately arrived at the table and suggested we start with a pot of cheese warmed in the oven.  The camembert with honey, pear and almonds was awesome, much more satisfying than any amuse bouche. For dinner we started with a citrus crab salad (I couldn't guess at half the ingredients in it but it was tangy and the big chunks of crab were super fresh) and sea scallops (some of the best I've had, although the vanilla risotto it was served over was a little overcooked and not exciting).  Then two awesome main courses.  The pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly and was obviously real high quality, but the star was definitely the bed of warm red cabbage slaw it came on.  I took one bite and made a little involuntary orgasm noise right away.  The tangy sweet cabbage had little bits of crispy pork belly cooked right in and I am still dreaming about it.  My date's filet was not only HUGE (it would easily have been 50-60 dollars at a big downtown steakhouse), it was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and draped with some succulent braised beef short rib.  Kick ass. For dessert, we shared the one dish I had seen mentioned in the Timeout review I'd read, which was a strawberry rhubarb tart.  Expecting something like a little pie, I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation: a butter cookie like bottom, topped with poached rhubarb, an airy strawberry marscapone, an icy cold sorbet, and a little flake of caramelized sugar resting on top.  Then our server poured tasty fruit syrup all over it right at the table.  Fun, and addictively tasty.  Our meal ended with some complimentary truffles and cookies, and a huge, but not undeserved, bill. We had  a great time and there were just a few things keeping this from a total 5-star experience.  The wine list was enormous, and featured an impressive selection of rare and cult wines, magnums, and funky new world selections.  But our server offered no guidance or recommendations, and there was scarcely a bottle under 80 dollars in the whole 15 page book.  We opted for some wines by the glass, and our server tried to sneak a recommendation for a $25 glass of meritage past me, even after I had noted that we were a bit budget conscious.  Overall, our main server was pretty inattentive, perhaps because we looked like a couple of poor young college students (we are, but we know how to splurge), but the host, bartender, maitre'd, and lovely backwaiter made up for this one lapse.  If I can ever pay off the credit card tab from this first visit, I'll be right back here!",0.9986,0.768,0.2,0.032,0.5571828676374131
2008-04-08,5.0,"One Sixty Blue is the Chicago restaurant one would never find in New York City. On the periphery of a pocket of ""cool"" establishments along West Randolph Street, the restaurant is an unassuming building painted in a pale blue and white with large windows that peer into a small bar and lounge area. The thing is, nothing on the exterior will prepare you for the shock of the dining area, where massive columns of dark mahogany paneling support a twenty foot high ceiling with curled parchment muting the light from above. The tables are fairly large, and the spacing is so that one would not automatically be privy to the conversations of the neighbor. We were a good three feet or so from the next table. This is something that could not be done in Manhattan, where real estate would be too valuable. The food preparation area is open for viewing, and one could spy the sous chef and pastry chef frenetically preparing dishes for the well-heeled clientele. She and I were the youngest diners at the restaurant by far, but to be honest, I don't know why there weren't more diners our age there. It was a Friday night, and given the clean, muted decor, the sufficient spacing between tables and the pleasantness of the staff who served us, it seemed like The Perfect Date Restaurant. Now the setting was perfectly romantic, but it was the extraordinary food that has me perfectly willing to jump on Oprah's couch declaring my undying love for this place. There is a massive, massive wine rack that separates the bar and lounge area from the dining room, and they have a fair selection of wines to choose from. We went with a modest bottle of syrah, which was surprisingly good. The red wine glasses, I'd like to mention, were massive and lovely to look at - so opulent. If only I remembered the brand, I would buy a set. Now we had selected a red, but our appetizers were both seafood. If ever there were an example of how much cooking matters as an art and as a science, the Maine diver sea scallops served with mascarpone pumpkin puree, chanterelle mushrooms, pancetta, frise and sage would be it. The scallops, perhaps not the full size of her fist, but close enough, were exquisitely prepared - the precise application of fire to the heat-sensitive protein flesh of the mollusk left the meat so tender as to cleave smoothly to the knife, so juicy and gloriously absorbent of the flavors of the chanterelle mushrooms, pancetta, and sage that formed the base of the sauce, and all so complimentary to the mascarpone pumpkin puree and frise. Then there was the rock shrimp gnocchi, the tiny shrimp floating amongst gnocchi so incredibly light and fluffy as to put marshmallows to shame. The asparagus and shiitake mushrooms were well-selected compliments to the textures of the meaty shrimp and airy gnocchi, all in a truly delicious emulsion of lobster and tarragon. I would say that these appetizers were fairly close to crack in terms of how addictive they could be. I would possibly kill someone I didn't like too much for more of those scallops. And really, never has gnocchi ever been so phenomenal. She selected the Colorado rack of lamb. Now they listed ""eggplant caviar / pulled lamb shoulder / oven-dried tomato / tomme de brebis / thyme sauce"" on the menu, and to be honest, I don't quite remember much of that, but I do remember that it was all rather delicious, and the lamb was perfectly prepared. The meat was simply so tender, in a sauce that tasted so good. And I did have a rather good rack of lamb at Salpicn only four days or so before. I went for the duo of free-range veal - a pan-roasted striploin and crispy sweetbread, served with spinach mousseline, bacon lardon, pickled white mushroom, mustard-honey sauce. The veal was incredibly delicious, the striploin as tender as Kobe beef without the marbling fat, the crispy sweetbread  well prepared and rich. It was just all so good that I was sorry to see that I had finished everything on my plate. Only there was more to come. The desserts that I write about, I can still taste in my mouth when I close my eyes and think of heaven and heroin.  Her crme brle was beautiful to look at, and the layering of the mousse and crme was rather pretty. The candied shell crackled as our spoons crunched through. The chocolate was decidedly rich, and the vanilla just so good, the entire dessert was fantastic. The souffl was definitively spectacular. Richly chocolately, but just so airy, this dessert was fantastic. As you punctured the risen top layer of moist cake and made your way down into the dense molten center, your tongue was kept from being overwhelmed by the clean, cold, sour-sweet raspberry sorbet, elegantly perched above the white porcelain in its phyllo dough cone As we finished our desserts, and finally made our way down to the end of our bottle of syrah, I don't think I've ever been as happy after dinner as at the end of that meal",0.9995,0.784,0.194,0.022,0.61675661898488

But the ambiance, mood, vibe, whatever you want to call it - just wasn't there for us. Usually, I love soft music and the secretive hush you often find in classy restaurants... but this place could have stood to up the volume a little. It was so quiet, it was almost eerie... and everything about the place felt sort of dead (on a Friday night, nonetheless!). Maybe it just wasn't our style but I was hoping for more of a lively vibe at a place so talked about.  But on to positives. The food was a delight. We started with a cheese plate - terrific, bold flavors that paired nicely with our server-recommended wine. For entrees: try the beef tenderloin. Amazing. Perfectly done, with a fabulous espresso crunch topping that gave just the right amount of zing.  Service is top notch here.

We tried the prix fixe menu and between everyone in my foursome we had almost every option.  The endive salad wasn't particularly special, except for the yarmulke-like crisp it had over the top.  The combination of ingredients could be had at Cosi or any other lunch chain in Chicago.  The potato leek soup, however, was to die for.  I would go back there just for the soup.... and the presentation was fabulous (they presented a bowl of leeks and bacon and then poured the creamy potato soup over it).  Those who had the fish said it was excellent, and the duck with fennel was really tender and tasty.  I was, however, disappointed in the pork tenderloin with crispy pork belly and some sort of cherry compote... the fruit flavors seemed to overpower the pork, which was well cooked but not flavorful or seasoned enough.  Dessert was fantastic; after sampling the sorbet, coconut crisp and banana cannelloni, I couldn't decide which was my favorite.   I probably can't afford to return to one sixtyblue very soon, but I definitely plan on going back and checking out the rest of the menu sometime.  If it's within your budget, you pretty much HAVE to go. :)",0.9867,0.826,0.148,0.025,0.598727422003284

2008-02-28,4.0,"3.5 stars for one sixty blue I had dinner at one sixty blue last night for Restaurant Week.  After reading everyone's enthusiastic reviews, I was anticipating an AMAZING dinner!  Maybe that was my problem, my expectations were too high.  I'm not saying it was bad, it was very good.  Solid.  But nothing blew me away.  I will not find myself dreaming about anything I ate for weeks afterwards, which is what usually happens to me when I eat something unbelievably delicious. Now, it might be because of the prix fixe menu.  Obviously your choices are limited.  We looked at the a la carte menu as well, and there were some very tasty sounding dishes on there!  (Including their specialty Delmonico steak, but $42?!  That's kinda crazy.)  Actually, they had special prices for some of their a la carte items, in case you wanted to switch one of the prix fixe choices out for another item on the menu.  The appetizers were an extra $8, and the entrees were an extra $15.  Except for the aforementioned Delmonico, which is an extra $25.  I thought this was a nice idea, but I'm too cheap to actually take advantage of it! The first hurdle to overcome was ordering--my boyfriend and I wanted all the same things, so we were fighting over who got to order what, and who had to order their second choice.  Here's what we had: Appetizers Belgian Endive Salad--My boyf couldn't bring himself to order the soup, so he got this.  Actually, it was a pretty big salad!  Blue cheese, candied walnuts, a nice vinaigrette.  It was topped with this lil wonton-like ""cap"", which was cute.  And tasty!  His only complaint was that the walnuts were a bit too bitter, like they were not cleaned properly.  Parmesan Gnocchi--Yay, I won the appetizer round!  The gnocchi was quite good, I loved the big square of parmesan on top!  I always forget that I am not the biggest fan of butternut squash, I find it a bit too sweet sometimes.  Plus the amaretto cookie crumble just added to the sweetness.  I could never eat a whole plate of this as an entree, but it was nice as an appetizer.  Creamy and tasty. Entree Duck Breast--I let the boyf get the duck, since I got the gnocchi.  We both thought the duck was a bit tough.  I thought the presentation was very pretty though.  The duck also came with roasted persimmons.  Mr Man didn't care for them, but I thought they were delicious!  The roasting really brings out the flavor and aroma of the fruit.  I was happy to take them off his hands!   Pork Tenderloin--I am slowly becoming a pork eater, I never used to order it!  I was having trouble deciding what to get, and the waitress said this was her favorite of the 4 entrees.  I thought it was really, really tasty!  When the pork arrived, it was pretty pink in the middle.  Everyone says its OK to eat pork a bit more rare these days, but I guess it still scares me!  The pork was VERY tender though, MMM.  It came with a sweet potato puree, and I LOVE sweet potatoes, and a red cabbage confit, which I liked, but I see how some could find it too tangy.  I really liked the sauce too, I think it was a berry sauce? Dessert Coconut Crunch--I got most of this to myself, since Mr Man doesn't like coconut.  MMM, yummo.  White chocolate-coconut mousse, so creamy and delish.  On top of this macadamia nut crisp, which was toasty, nutty deliciousness.  The lime foam was SO good too, a great compliment to the coconut and macadamia!  Not so much a foam as a cream, really.  There were also little wafers on top of the mousse--as soon as I put it on my tongue it was like a ZING! of lime!  Woo!  It surprised me, but it was a nice extra bit of flavor to cut some of the sweetness of the coconut. Banana-Mascarpone Cannelloni--Mr Non-Coconut Eater ordered this.  It was good, but I thought mine was better.  I loved the caramel sauce, and the carmelized bananas were really yummy too.  It was a different, unique dessert.   A pleasant evening.  I like the decor of the restaurant.  Sleek, classy.  The bar/lounge area looks cool too.  We sat right in front of the wine cellar, and it was interesting to watch the servers climb the ladder to fetch bottles.  :)  I thought the staff were all very friendly and accommodating.   Again, everything was solidly good.  Would I come back?  Maybe--I want to come for their ""dust off the bottle"" dinner, where you bring in a bottle of wine, and they create a menu for you, based on what kind of wine you bring in!  COOL!",0.9996,0.726,0.236,0.038,0.5209106529209622
2008-02-28,3.0,"Ehhh...I was expecting amazing and what I got seemed, well, flat and contrived. We did the Chicago Restaurant Week menu.  We started, though, with some herbed goat cheese that was supposed to have been warmed in the wood burning over.  The cheese was delicious and served with garlic, lemon confit, and sundried tomatoes.  However...the cheese was still cold when it arrived. For my first course I had the potato leek soup...it was easily the best thing I had.  It was smooth, creamy and delicious!  I loved it.  Brian had the parm gnocchi, and he thought it was okay. We both had the white fish with suckling pig for our entrees...they were okay.  The fish was piping hot, but the skin was soggy, which told me it had either a) been reheated or b) had been sitting for a while.  Additionally, the sauces that were served with the entree had skins on them (from exposure to air), so my guess is that they had been sitting. Our desserts were fine too, B had the sorbet trio (mandarin, coconut, and raspberry).  They were all pretty good.  I had the cannelloni with bananas.  Eh... Overall, I would have been terribly disappointed to eat there at the regular price.  I just didn't think the meal had the quality I expect for that price.   On a side note, our waiter was very knowledgeable, but he talked to us as if it was our first fine dining experience.  And, when we asked for suggestions, he only suggested things that weren't available on the Chicago Restaurant Week menu.

2008-02-19,5.0,"I found my favorite Chicago restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate Valentine's Day at one sixty blue this year. After reading several positive reviews, I was very excited to finally experience this place. We started our meal with a small goat cheese platter heated from the wood oven. The goat cheese was delicious - my boyfriend likened the cheese's silkiness to butter. They only gave us a few pieces of crostini to eat with the cheese, but one of our waiters was kind enough to give us more once we ran out. My boyfriend had a salad as a first course, which was presented nicely with a wonton-like dome that he had to crack to get to the salad. For our main courses, I had the yellow tail snapper and my boyfriend had the pork tenderloin. The snapper was very soft and also had some toasty skin. The texture contrast was a delight! I tried some of my boyfriend's pork, which was very flavorful. It was so soft I don't think he needed a knife to cut through the pieces. We also ordered pommes frites with truffle oil and gruyere cheese. WOW. I think I actually loved the frites more than my snapper. It's definitely a must-try. To wrap up our meal, we split a Grand Marnier souffle. I always equate souffle with chocolate so I was a bit shocked when the waiter showed up without chocolate in the ramekin. Nonetheless the lemony souffle was delicious. The souffle came out piping hot and I ended up burning my tongue a bit as I gobbled down all its yumminess. And just when I couldn't take any more food, our waiter gave each of us lemon meyer madeleines to take home with us. The madeleines were a perfect way to end the meal. I couldn't have asked for more. I have to admit the dinner was a tad pricey, but the entire culinary experience - from the decor, ambiance, service and food - made it all worth it.

2007-11-25,5.0,"Me and a foodie friend of mine happened upon One Sixty-blue on a Friday night around 5pm looking slovenly in our sweatshirts and jeans--- but had heard good things about the place.  Granted--- we were also the kind of sweatshirt & jeans wearing guys who wouldn't really care about forking down $200 for a good dinner. So considering we were able to jump in and sit right down at a table without a wait, it was a score. The Joint This place was one of the best in its class of upscale-yet-not-ungodly-expensive. The menu seemed playfully experimental without being unapproachable.  With items like Sunchokes and Sweetbreads, one could definitely try out new slants on dishes. We were up for solid basics of meat and fish. Appetizers will set you back $12-18 but given the flavor combos, they're worth it.  Main courses are late twenties to late thirties. The Food The starter appetizer included an oven-warmed goat cheese crock filled with a few tasty morsels of olives (I counted three kinds) and beets. It was a good sized portion that we spread on toasts the waiters served seconds and thirds of. My buddy got the Belgian Endive Salad with blue cheese mixed greens and candied nuts.  To call this an appetizer salad would be unfair.  The portion of his salad was definitely meal-worthy.  On the other hand, I had the soup du jour: celery root with bacon and homemade croutons.  It was about 2 cups of warm, smooth, layered goodness. For the main course, I got the Kona Kampachi--- a whitefish farm-raised off the coast of the island of Kona.  It's a hearty fish that the chef pan-seared to rare and placed on a bed of rutabaga puree with toasted peanuts, macadamias, and dotted with chunks of flageolet. It was rounded out by two leeks and drizzled with a gooseberry vinagrette that was WHY I LOVE SAUCES.  Complex and concentrated with flavors that I swear included ginger, grapefruit, lemon and vanilla. The roasted gooseberries thrown onto the plate were a great final touch. However great my Kona was, it paled in comparison to the house-specialty: the Prime Delmonico Steak.  In fact, if you have a steak-lover in your midst who swears by only eating steak in its simplest form, without sauces or toppings, you ought to have them try this out. Why?  because this 12 ounce BONE-OUT cut of meat is dry-aged for a week and then cooked to perfection. Some might call it sacrilege to cover a steak with anything, but One Sixty-Blue found the right formula by blanketing the meat with a thin layer of carmelized shallots and roasted shallot sauce.  Each slice of the steak held flavors that rivaled those of the great steak halls around this town.  Some slightly sweet, then salty/savory and juicy.  One could eat it plain, but it came with a cup-sized saucepan filled with potato puree (and doused in another kind of gravy- this one more traditional). We had to finish with some dessert--- in our case a couple different sorbets (mandarin orange and cranberry). And our check was brought to us with a couple samplings of their homemade candy & homemade madelines. IF YOU THINK that you should leave them with the check, given that you've just gorged yourself on a hefty meal, think again. I grabbed my madeline and he left his-- and I damn him for doing it.  The madeline was one of the best I've ever had.. and it left me completely shocked that I'd even care about a simple french cookie left as an afterthought.  I'd have eaten a dozen of those little jewels. Our Waiter Cordial and attentive without hovering.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the food and intelligent enough to recommend a wine to complement the Delmonico-- although I'm sure that's come after plenty of experience with nightly recos. We gave him a hefty tip for guiding us through the meal and having a good time with it. I'd tell you his name if I had remembered it.   Just look for the dude with the mohawk (that's right) and steel-rimmed glasses. He'll have you covered.",0.998,0.824,0.141,0.036,0.5272017599886452

I have, but I also call for ""gun shot"" every time I want to sit up front during a car ride, so go fig. A couple of friends took me to 160 Blue for dinner on my birthday this year. I liked the ambience, with soft mood lighting and simple but modern dcor. We decided to sit at the bar while waiting for our table and order a couple of cocktails. I don't remember who the bartender was or if he/she is still there, but I would suggest to not order any type of mixed drinks from there. I ordered a simple apple martini to begin with and it was horrible. I'm still convinced that they served me straight-out vodka with green food coloring. My advice is: Stick to the wines. Unlike some of the reviewers, the rest of our evening wasn't as painful: Our table was ready within minutes of us sitting at the bar, our appetizers and entrees came out promptly, and our server was as pleasant as can be. I'm not sure why, but I was obsessed with the bread they served us with first. The cheese/fruit-tasting platter we ordered was pretty darn good. As an appetizer, I got the bouillabaisse - don't you just love that word? Bouillabaisse. Bouillabaisse. Bouillabaisse. I could say it all day long!

But, alas, after tossing it around in my head for a bit, I have decided to give this place NO STARS, and here's why: We arrived promptly for a 9pm reservation and had to wait for 1/2 hour at the bar before finally inquiring about  our table. We were then (finally) seated.  That I could have forgiven.  The waiter came over promptly and was engaging and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a cheese course and waited 22 minutes for it to arrive. Now, I know that they don't ferment their own cheese at 160 Blue and it was not terribly busy, so the kitchen wasn't slammed. All they really had to do was slice and plate the cheese. But 22 minutes later it finally arrived. It was decent cheese, about the quality of cheese I get at Whole Foods, but not bad. Anyway, all this I could have forgiven. My husband ordered the ""Boneless"" Squab but kept picking the bird's ribcage out of his mouth throughout the meal. I ordered the Halibut and it was good, not great (but does halibut every really get great?). The squab, despite the millions of tiny little bones, was quite tasty. The food took incredibly long to come out. All this I could have forgiven.  The dessert took forever as well but was amazing. I had the brioche pudding, which was heaven on a plate and my husband had the truffles, which were good. So, now we have been at this restaurant for THREE HOURS, mostly wondering why our food was taking so long, and the bill comes. We noticed that our entire bar tab was transferred onto our dinner check, which would have been fine if we hadn't closed out our bar tab before being seated.  I was a high-end server in college and have seen this trick used a hundred times, almost always with great success. Bartenders and waiters do this to pad the bill to increase their tip. It's an old trick and it left a bad taste in my mouth. After we complained the hostess come over and gave us some half-baked excuse about the bartender's forgetfulness; it was obvious that she hardly believed her own story. This was the final and inexcusable straw.  I do not go out to dinner to get swindled by the staff.

2007-04-29,4.0,"Let's start with the good things: - Onstreet parking on Randolph.  We were there at 9pm on a Saturday night, and there was plenty of parking within a block.  Right there, that's like a $10 gift certificate.  Of course, they also have a $7 valet. - The interior is wonderfully done.  Warmly modern, with a mix of woods, fabrics, stainless steel.  Good use of dividers to add an intimate feel to an airy space.  Tables are well offset, so that you feel you have your own private space (and don't need to squeeze past people when walking around).  There's a great lounge space near the front bar that's probably worth a trip just for itself.  Acid jazz pumped unobtrusively throughout. - The food was pretty good.  We started with cheese, which was just OK.  I'd skip any of the warmed cheese (they were out of the Cambrio goat's milk, which is what we wanted so we wound with camembert, which was unspecial), and the two other cheeses (petit basque and a domestic blue) were just OK.  BUT . . . when we mentioned that we were underimpressed, the staff brought over a chunk of frome that was much better -- nice!  For appetizers we had a crab salad that was all gingered crab -- recommended.  Our entrees were the squab (really good) and the hallibut (pretty good).  For desert we had some rice pudding pastry thing that was good, and the one sixtyblue truffles (which were probably very good, but I don't know what I was thinking, as I'm not a chocolate person). - The service was friendly, engaging, and knowledgable.  We felt that we got pretty good feedback on the menu, and, as above, when we were dissatisfied with something, we got a nice response. - The wine list was good.  We were able to get a nice 1/2 bottle of Rhone from among a solid selection of 1/2 bottles. But there were some things that cost what would otherwise be a great dinner a full star: - Everything was s - l - o - w.  We arrived promptly for our 9pm reservation, and had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated.  Not cool when you're really, really hungry. - The s- l - o - w -ness continued through the meal.  I don't think we wound up with any food on the table until almost 10pm.  Courses showed up in a very languid manner.  We didn't get bread until after our appetizers. - They padded our bill.  We'd closed out our bar bill immediately at the bar (as we were silly enough to think we'd be seated promptly) . . . but then found our drinks back on our dinner bill, along with an apple martini (blech!) from who-knows-where.  Nice try for an extra $30.  We got apologies, sure, but walked out with a sour taste.",0.9965,0.821,0.168,0.011,0.5530314347961408

2007-02-26,2.0,"I went into this restaurant with high expectations, mainly because I had heard many rave reviews and also because of how pricey it was. (Note: expensive doesn't necessarily equal good.) The atmosphere was very spacious and modern, and the service was impeccable...however, I was not too impressed with the food. (Maybe I went on an off-night, who knows?) Let's start with the appetizers: We got the scallop app, which was $16. It had only 2 large scallops with a lot of little garnishes. The scallops were fresh and tasty, but I thought they overdid it with all the garnishes. It seemed that there were just too many flavors that were mixing. We also got an ahi tuna dish that was good, but again overdone with the garnishes. For my main dish, I got the steak delmonico. The first bite was divine...so tender and fatty. But then, bite after bite was just fatty. I know it is supposed to be a more ""fatty"" cut/type, but it was fat overload! I actually like the fatty parts, usually but not for the whole steak! (Note: the steak was huge! That is one good thing about the $36 entree!) And then we got a couple of desserts: the black and white creme brulee and a chocolate souffle. Those were decent...don't know if they were great since I am not a huge dessert fan.  Overall, the place was nice, trendy and upscale. It would be a good place to impress someone on a date or a business dinner. To me, if you are not paying for it--try it. If you are, you probably could spend your pennies elsewhere and get a better meal for less.",0.9883,0.837,0.138,0.025,0.4923938223938225

Superb service - our waiter recommended wines, appetizers, etc. and everything he recommended was great, he was also very attentive while remaining unobtrusive.  Went on a Tuesday night for a business dinner, and it was sufficiently uncrowded despite the concurrent Bulls game. Definitely get the Beef Tenderloin and the Scallops, those were the favorites at our table.",0.9726,0.706,0.28,0.013,0.640909090909091

Beautiful restaurant, very modern but still a comfortable dining experience. Everything from the food (fantastic), to the wine (large list, rotates fairly often), to the service (excellent) makes this an easy return for me. You will drop some cash on this place, but keep an eye out for their many dining and wine events during weeknights that will help the wallet.",0.9152,0.771,0.18,0.049,0.7747799422799423

If you are serious about food, you will not be disappointed here.  I cannot count the number of times I have eaten here.  The kitchen is consistent, service good, wine selection abundant and we always leave full and happy that we spent our money here rather than some average restaurant where we have to push thru the crowd to the bar for an after dinner drink. I love the bar/lounge area and that I can always get a seat...and a table in the dining room, for that matter. This is not for the hipster looking for a scene...which is perplexing to me b/c the place has such a sleek and sophisticated atmosphere.  Hmmm...I guess there are just too many new places popping up throughout the city.  Anyway, it works for me.",0.9779,0.8,0.177,0.023,0.5845117845117845

2006-12-05,5.0,"I just LOVE returning to One Sixty Blue. It has been a habit of mine to return on our wedding anniversary and they have always delivered.  I strongly recommend planning to stay a while. One Sixty Blue is more of an experience. The first couple times we went there, they were introducing their cheese platter. I seldom if ever eat cheese, but the smell of this cheese was impossible to resist. I tried it and loved it. The servers who have generally been busy ALWAYS seem to be devoted to us. They are knowledgeable, witty and remarkably attentive. The menu varies and I think the Delmonico Steak is the only one I have seen at every visit. I highly recommend this. I generally eat this cooked rare.  I also remind you to leave room for dessert. Otherwise you are dutibound to return just to try it. They are adventurous with their dessert and every time I have asked our servers to recommend what they would eat. I cannot recall them all, but they were always mouth watering.

2006-11-01,4.0,"I got to One Sixty blue for the Dust of your wine bottle night.  It's the last Friday night of every month and the dinner is set around the a specific type of wine (California Cab, Oregon Pinot....)  The menu is set around the wine for a fix price. It's a four course dinner which normally has a chicken/fish course then a meat course followed by cheese and dessert.  I can't eat dessert so they always give me an extra cheese course. I suggest telling them to have the chef pick out another cheese that would go well with the wine.  Honestly I've never eating off the regular menu so I can't give any insight into that. Besides the food the restaurant is very spacious and you do not feel crowded. It's nice to go to dinner and not feel on top of your neighbors.",0.7437,0.933,0.056,0.011,0.38185897435897437

2005-07-11,4.0,"This place really blows me away. I went in with no expectations the first time, BUT, man, was I shocked by the level enjoyment from the first bite to the last. After that wonderful meal, I was dying to go back and experience more than a party of flavors in my mouth, but rather a soiree of flavors in my mouth. I was not disappointed.  I've tried several menu items between two trips, so I will touch on some of my favorites. First off, the diver sea scallops appetizer is a MUST have.  My God, the first time I had these, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! The scallops are so perfectly cooked, not too chewy and the temperature was just right throughout. Now to the entrees, on my first visit, I enjoyed the beef tenderloin in a red wine reduction sauce, served with a side of whipped potatoes. Sheer excellence. On to dessert! First off, I don't know which was better, the chocolate bombe or the bittersweet chocolate souffle. Both are very simple, yet divinely satisfying. The quality of chocolate used in both is top notch.  Just thinking about it makes me drool.  On my second visit I was fortunate enough to enjoy the bittersweet chocolate souffle served with raspberry sorbet.  W-O-W is what my mouth and brain were screaming on the first taste of the chocolate. I could not get over just how good the melty, chocolately goodness was on the inside of this treat. Another perfect ending to a perfect meal. I highly recommend one sixtyblue to anyone looking for a wonderful night of food. It was truly amazing on both visits. And to think they were going to close this place down and replace it with a Michael Jordan Steakhouse! Will I be back? Hell yes. EDIT: I went back in winter 2006, and I was very disappointed with my dining experience, so I had to take away a star.  I'm hoping that it was just an off night, and they haven't slipped that much.  I ordered the delmonico steak, and it was all fat.  Good at first, but after the first couple of bites, it became closer to the gross side.",0.9985,0.679,0.263,0.059,0.47838501291989655
