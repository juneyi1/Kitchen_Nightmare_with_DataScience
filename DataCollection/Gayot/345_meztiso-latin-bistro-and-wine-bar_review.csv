2006-07-05,3.0,"The sangria and fresh guacamole and chips are delicious.  Although the restaurant attracts many people, it is never crowded (not a lot of of restaurants or shops around this area on Wells)  so you can get a seat at almost anytime of the day/ night.",0.8271,0.821,0.179,0.0,0.6666666666666666
2005-12-30,2.0,"You walk in and you get a great feeling about the place.  Everything seems wonderful....until you order the chips and salsa and think to yourself that it looks delicious, but it's missing something....taste.  The story continues for the soups, ceviche, and everything else we ordered.  I couldn't help but wonder if there was even any alcohol in my mojito.  It's a wonderful looking place with great presentation, but the food is not worth what you're paying for at all.  Try the pulque though (under the beer selections).  Guaranteed to be a nice treat.",0.9546,0.713,0.218,0.069,0.6642857142857144
2005-08-15,5.0,"Fun decor, nice staff, homemade Sangria and excellent food ... how can you go wrong.  This is the type of place you can make your neighborhood restaurant/bar and be delited that they always remember you and try their hardest to make your meal great.  Also, a great way to enjoy a few tapas with a pitcher of sangria before moving on to a full meal, the mix of mexican and spanish food makes for a long and fun meal.",0.9698,0.705,0.262,0.033,0.48846153846153845
