2015-10-15,1.0,"I should have known not to do it, but my coworker is constantly ordering from this place, the menu is a mix of Indian, Italian, and southern American dishes. Like what restaurant serves food from so many different types regions and do them all mediocre. Please save yourself the menu will have your mouth watering but you will be disappointed by lack of flavor and authenticity.",0.5267,0.77,0.137,0.093,0.39791666666666664
2008-04-11,5.0,"I tried Luciano's when I went to my cousin's wedding in Chicago awhile back. I just remember it being so good~. The steak was awesome, the atmosphere was great and the wine, tasty, no bitter. The whole Rush street scene was nice and seemed like a very hip place to be. Oh, and phenomenal service.. the waiter recommended most of what we ate we were more than satisfied, even my picky-eating mother. *^^*",0.9243,0.723,0.218,0.059,0.5875

2005-11-04,4.0,I came here three years ago for my one year anniversary on a recommendation from a friend.  The atmosphere was very cozy and intimate.  THe waitstaff was excellent - they were friendly and efficient and very attentive.  We ordered a bottle of wonderful red wine and the meal was simply delicious - we stuffed outselves silly with really good calamari and pasta.  Definately a great recommendation for a nice dinner on the town since it's so close by the Magnificent Mile.,0.9876,0.637,0.363,0.0,0.7923076923076924
