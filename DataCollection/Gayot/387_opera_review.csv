However, the second time I went with my parents, the food was not that good.  It did not seem as tasty as it was the first time.  We had the same special, which I think was on a Sunday, but it was a fairly forgettable meal. I do remember the sorbet for dessert which I thought was very good.

2010-12-12,5.0,"After a long, long awaited visit to Opera, I can safely feel comfortable typing in a public setting that this restaurant lives up to all the hype and greatly exceeded my expectations.  First of all, the interior is incredible. It is a dark, mellow funhouse filled with mirrors and shapes and sparkles, so cool. We were seated at the front of the restaurant near the bar, and I seriously couldn't wait to excuse myself for the restroom in order to explore the layout some more. Also the furniture is comfortable. Also our waiter was awesome.  Oh! The food is delicious too. We absolutely splurged and ordered a huge assortment of vegan items from the ultra veg-friendly menu: For appetizers we ordered the Malaysian Flat Bread and Shiitake Mushroom Wontons. The Flat Bread was a buttery and delicate rotti bread covered in an insanely delicious coconut tofu curry. The wontons were the greatest things I have ever tasted, ever. They were earthy and fried and served with a salad with a sweet, ughhhh so good dressing. The food and presentation blew me away, I seriously could have stopped here.  But we didn't! We also ordered the Orange tofu and Kung Pao tofu. The Kung Pao was the only thing that didn't entirely blow me away, mostly because I was expecting a sweet pea-nutty sauce and instead received a really fascinating BBQ or southern-cooking kind of dish. The Orange Tofu came with a ton of fresh, crisp veggies and the sauce was super sweet but not-too-sweet - it was awesome. Finally, the Hainanese Kaipong. Imagine the world's most inspired, incredible fried rice wrapped up in a lotus leaf with -- with lychees! Best dish ever.  This is the kind of meal I want to go back and take out on a weekly basis, but I don't want to ruin the sincere magic I felt eating in the restaurant. It's a serious dilemma for me. Does this become a constant favorite or a gem for special occasions? To be announced. In the mean time, get over there!",0.9959,0.776,0.197,0.027,0.6442422161172162

The last time was about 2 years ago and it was still fairly happening, with a great wine list, extensive menu and beautiful waitstaff. Much to my dismay, the only redeaming feature of Opera, the duck, is no longer offered. The menu has been culled to one page of 12 items, none of which contains duck!!! The waitstaff appeared to be pulled from Fame castoffs and the customer-base consisted of families and couples wearing white tennis shoes with acid-washed jeans.

The second star is for our waitress, who, while seemingly quite busy being the only one there, was genuine in hoping we enjoyed the food.  Unfortunately, we both did not.  I would not recommend this restaurant.

The decor was great.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The chairs all being different and eclectic was a great touch I thought.  The service was awesome too - everyone was very friendly.   I was, however, super bummed about the prix fixe menu.  I had read all these reviews about it and decided it was definitely in my future.  Nowhere did it say in anyone's yelp reviews or on the Opera website that this was only available on Sundays and Tuesdays.  I went on a Monday.  Nuts!

2010-10-27,5.0,"This may just be the best prix-fixe value in the city. We went for the Tuesday night prix-fixe, in which diners can order any appetizer (dim sum), any entreé (wok or grill), and any dessert for 24.95. The only catch is that everyone at the table must order the prix-fixe -- not a problem since there were only two of us and that's what we planned anyway.  Loved the decor, and since it's been well-covered by other reviewers, I won't go into specifics. We started out with drinks at the bar since we were early for our reservation and they don't start seating until 5:30 (we were there for a pre-show dinner). The bartender did not seem to love his job (or the customers), but the drinks were good. My seasonal mojito (blackberry) was very tasty.  Once seated next to a window (my favorite spot) by the friendly and engaging host, our server was wonderful, and we could not have been happier with our service. He asked right away if we had any time limitations and promised to get us out in plenty of time to make our show. I actually saw him check his watch a couple of times to assure that we were on schedule. When he saw that we were sharing our meal, he had the entreés split into two servings and brought them one at a time. Bonus points for this -- very thoughtful! And the food was very close to perfect. For our dim sum course, we selected the golden shrimp (outstanding!) and the lobster springrolls (very good). The shrimp exploded with flavor, yet was very light for tempura. I could seriously eat this every day. For entreés, we selected the diver sea scallops and the beef and broccoli. Yes, we received only one large scallop each, but they were perfection. Served atop a mushroom/bacon risotto, they were perfectly cooked and seasoned... really among the best I've had. The risotto was unique and delicious. After finishing our scallop course, our server brought the beef. Again cooked to a perfect medium rare, the flavors exploded. It was, perhaps, a bit on the salty side, but I like salty so it didn't bother me. It did bother my husband just a tad. The garlic ginger broccoli was crispy and delicious. Overall, if I hadn't been in public I would have been very tempted to lick the plates -- it was all that good.  Don't let the smallish-sounding portion sizes fool you. I am a big eater, as is my husband, and we were full after the dim sum and entreés. I really wanted to try and tackle the flourless chocolate cake, but I opted for the minted cherry sorbet instead due to my engorged stomach. At the risk of sounding repetitive, the sorbet was among the best I've had. I was served three scoops, and it was covered with sliced strawberries, diced pineapple, and blackberries. My husband opted for the pineapple upside down cake, which he raved about. I don't do pineapple (I removed the pieces from my dessert), but I did try his creme fraiche ice cream which was served on the side and it was delicious as well.  All in all, an excellent experience and we would definitely go back for the Tuesday or Sunday night prix-fixe.",0.9989,0.777,0.196,0.027,0.5654136141636141
2010-10-16,3.0,"Ok, I've been to Opera twice for dinner.  The experiences were very different and so I average my rating.   Once was a weekday and we did the prix fixe menu and everything from the service to the food was excellent.  We got seated in one of those private, closet type rooms and it was kind of cool to have the privacy, but a little strange to not know that the hell was going on in the rest of the restaurant.  Our server was awesome and gave some really great suggestions.  I had the orange beef dish and it was prepared perfectly.  The portions were huge, so we asked to get our leftovers wrapped to take home.  Well, the people in the kitchen accidentally threw our leftovers away, so they were kind enough to make us all fresh new meals and box them up.  Score!  We seriously ate that stuff for a week and it was just as yummy reheated. The second time I dined at Opera, I went with friends on a Saturday night.  The experience was just average that night.  We sat outside, which was nice.  But the food wasn't nearly as tasty and the service was mediocre as well.  It wasn't busy there either, so I'm not sure why there was such a difference.  I ordered the orange beef again and it was kinda tough and rubbery this time around.  Seems like this place is either hit or miss.  The restaurant has an awesome interior vibe and is in a good location (really easy to find street parking, woot woot for using would be valet money for extra drinks!) but you'll never see it packed.  It's never busy there, even during prime dining hours.  Which leads me to believe that everyone else knows it's hit or miss too.  And why gamble when there's so many sure things in Chicago dining?",0.995,0.736,0.199,0.065,0.614875901875902

No people....this is not a review about the Lyric Opera. This is a review about the restaurant Opera.  I have been to Opera twice now. I was there Halloween last year and then last weekend I was here with a party of 25. I would have to say that I was more impressed with their food last year, but their service and decor is still just as amazing, if not, it captures me in more every time I get there.  This time around our waiter was amazing. Part of our group was late and our server was very accommodating to some of the late guest especially since most of us were at least 15-30 minutes later than we had scheduled.  I ordered the Malaysian vegan flat bread. That tasted great, but then I recall liking the crispy orange tofu more than I did this time. I think it was way too sweet. I was expecting sweet, but that was too sweet for even my sweet tooth.  I think everyone else enjoyed their food too. I also tried the vegan rice noodles and they were good and so was the kung pao tofu. I had the martini with the mango flavoring.  I think it was kinda dead for a Saturday. I was with a party of 25, but it still seemed like the other half of the restaurant was dead. I was pretty surprised that there was not more people.

2010-09-29,2.0,"I will echo all the reviewers before me and say that the decor in this place is great! Definitely kept me interested while I waited for my food. Our waiter was great, very attentive but not hovery. We ordered the Malaysian vegan flatbreads for an appetizer and they were DELICIOUS. Very spicy but sooo good. It is basically cubes of tofu with peas and bean sprouts on a flaky pita (roti). It came with a delicious coconut curry dipping sauce on the side which I could have DRANK it. We loved it. Unfortunately, that's where the love affair ended.  I find that recently, a lot of the restaurants we try will wow us with the appetizers, and then just have so-so entrees. Are they hoping you will be too full to notice? Or maybe we are so hungry when the appetizers come that anything will taste good. Anyway, I ordered the vegan rice noodles for an entree, which was so-so. At first bite it had a fishy flavor, which is alarming since it was vegan! But once I mixed the noodles and veggies (minimal veggies I might add) in with the curry sauce, it was better. Basically, it was a plate of noodles, swimming in sauce, with a few peas, tomatoes, zucchini slices, and carrots mixed in. Nothing to write home about. My husband got two orders of the eggplant quinoa for his entree (we were told by the waiter that the quinoa is more of an appetizer-size portion, and he was right). Measly slices of eggplant wrapped around a heap of quinoa. Again, nothing to write home about.  Granted, we don't eat meat or seafood, so perhaps some of the other menu items were better. But still, in this day and age, in a big city, I expect vegetarian/vegan food to be just as tasty and prepared with just as much care as meat dishes. Why shouldn't it be? Vegetables are delicious, but they seemed to be missing from this meal.  I'm rambling now... all in all, I would go back and try something different at Opera, but my husband swore he wouldn't return so I probably won't be back any time soon.",0.9962,0.796,0.174,0.03,0.5303061224489797

The golden shrimp appetizer followed by the firecracker chicken was unbeatable.  Sometime in the last year something changed. The decor is still the same: bold and whimsical, but the food and the service has sadly slumped. The last time we went, the waitress was a little spacey and ridiculously pushy about the wine and cocktail list (we were traveling at 5:30 the next morning and not in the mood to be hungover on an 8 hour flight). We ordered Cokes instead and they both tasted really off. My girlfriend asked if maybe it had gotten a little flat and the waitress replied that no, they just don't have Coke. So....then....what did you just serve me?.....and why?......Anyway, not a huge deal as we weren't charged, but really...maybe you could've just told me when I ordered.  Apparently there is also a new head chef (Beverly Kim, where oh where did you go??) and the once-glorious firecracker chicken came out dry and tough.

Sat outside on a slightly sticky August night - would highly recommend the outdoor patio although the decor inside is fun and over the top in standard Kleiner fashion.  Since it was a Tuesday, we decided to do the $24.95 3 course pre-fixe special. Note: They ask the entire table to participate, which wasn't a problem for us, but you may want to know that before you go.  It's a very good deal considering some entrees are $22-26 alone. Drinks - friend got a pomajito - not really ask minty and muddled as she'd like. My peach frozen martini was really sweet and seemingly lacking alcohol. Although it was refreshing on a muggy night, it's not typically what I look for in a martini... I should have caught the ""frozen"" description and ordered something else.  We each got different apps: lobster spring rolls, shrimp dumplings, and lettuce wraps. All were good but the shrimp dumplings were my favorite (like pot stickers). For mains we got beef with broccoli, scallops, and the pine cone sea bass (names for the shape it takes when scored and cooked - sans pine cone flavor for those who might be confused... I was!). I am not a shitake fan, so my scallops were orders without and were delicious. Of all the entrees, the scallops were my favorite, followed by the sea bass and beef w broccoli.  Dessert was lava cake with cherry ice cream and a white chocolate panna cotta for the friends, pineapple upside down cake for me. Both the chocolate cake and pineapple upside down cake were a little dry.  Our server was great and gave us ample time for chit chatting and catching up (it's been a while).

This suburbanite gives a 5 star, 2 thumbs up, A+ rating  for that.  Beautiful night for patio drinks and dinner, so that's where we park ourselves. Then joy oh joy, our friendly and attentive server suggests the $15 Friday Relief special and our frugal evening gathers momentum: 2 full size martinis & an appetizer for $15? Sign us up! Basic French martini but the Asian Mist Martini was yummeh - and so was the crispy pork belly appetizer. Two GIANT blocks of porkly perfection, fresh mixed greens and two tasty dipping sauces. We made so many nomnom sounds, the couple next to us got the exact same order.  Happy thus far with our food foreplay, our helpful server mentions that even though it's not on the $15 app menu, she can offer us Soup of the Day Relief - and even split the portion. WOW: it proves to be one of the best soups we've ever had. Cold potato-leek soup with lemongrass and spicy bits and big honking slices of crispy bacon. Dayum - too many people around to lick the bowl in public.  Probably couldda shouldda stopped there, but we forge ahead with entrees. Scallops for me (3 very large, perfectly seared) atop a brown rice risotto (tasty, but slightly too crunchy) DH has the panko crusted skatewing special, which is as large as a smallish kite, perfectly cooked, and has a side of greenery stuff that I ignored completely. In a go for broke moment, we decide to split a almond-chocolate ganache cake. Pretty good, but hanging around on the same plate as the cake is a scoop of honey ice cream beyond belief.  All told? 4 martinis. Appetizer. Soup a deux. Two entrees. One dessert. Bill pre-tip came in under $90. Less than we'd pay for a semi-decent chainish place in the 'burbs.

The flatbread was a very interesting idea/flavor, and we very much enjoyed it (esp. for the price!). For our entrees; I ordered the Crisp Orange Beef (GREAT flavor for an Chinese ""orange"" dish)...the lotus and scallions really offset the semi sweet orange glaze nicely and added texture. However, the BEST PART OF THE MEAL BY FAR was the Massaman Short Ribs!!! Although one of the most expensive items on the menu, it was definetly worth the price.

2010-07-30,2.0,"My what a difference a couple of years made on this place, all of our favorite dishes are gone, most regrettably the the peking duck three ways which was the entree that drew us back again and again.  Instead the menu has been dumbed down so that it's just another Chinese restaurant except that the prices are higher and the portions smaller.  Our waitress tried to explain that it's now Pan Asian but honestly we had a really hard time finding enough things to eat up our $50 certificate.  For what they charge for a tiny bowl of fried calamari that was mostly tentacles, I could get a huge bowl at a dozen other eateries for  just about the same.  The pork satay came out cold and we sent it back, the shortribs were a rather pathetic 6 ribs with very little meat on them.  I guess they jack the prices up or pare the portions down because of the drink/appetizer specials or the huge number of 3 o'clock club certificates floating around. If you are just interested in drinks and a couple of appetizers they do have a $15 for two martini and 1 appetizer that's a good deal considering 1 martini is $10-12 by itself. Sorry Mr. Kleiner, Opera is off my list, regrettably along with the now shuttered Marche.  It's time to go try some peking duck at one of Tony Hu's places in Chinatown or up on the northside to Sun Wah",0.6026,0.852,0.082,0.066,0.5227777777777779

Cant complain about the price (180 for 6 people in the city is awesome) My friend had the scallops and the portion was quite small. If they had been bigger scallops 3 would have been ok. The kung pao chicken got rave reviews but the orange beef was also a bit over cooked. The 2 vegans we went with enjoyed thier meals and the do have quite a few vegan friendly options. The lobster spring rolls werre a bit bland but the sauce did make up for it. I will try this place again and see if other dishes are a bit better.,0.9751,0.825,0.165,0.01,0.6329545454545454

It was my date's bday, so I paid and got a private vault. Not that comfy, and a little creepy and isolated. Overall I was not as impressed with the decor as some of the other people here. The portions were rather small, with the exception of dessert, but I liked that. I was very hungry going in, and when I saw the size of our meals I expected to leave hungry. Not so. Surprisingly, I was very satisfied, without feeling bloated. My date said the same thing. So don't expect leftovers, but you won't leave hungry (unless of course you're one of those people who supersize their McDonald's every day). Personally, I think most American restaurants should consider cutting the size of their entrees in half.  Now for the food... We got the""love letter"" dumplings and mussels for appetizers, recommended by our server as his top 2 favorites. Both were good - interesting flavor combinations. I liked the dumplings more, but the mussels were nice and spicy with cilantro and pork. As far as mussels go (and I'm not a fan), these were very well prepared. Entrees: I ordered the scallops - there were only 2, but they were delicious, and so was the rice risotto. I love variety in my food, and the flavors in this meal were something different and very complimentary of each other. My date got the short ribs, which I tried and didn't like so much. Maybe it was the curry sauce, maybe the fatty meat, but I definitely preferred my plate to his.  We got the chocolate cherry dessert and the pineapple upside-down. Ahh I wish I wasn't so full because I only managed to have a few bites, but the chololate cherry thing was amazing. It had like 5 different things on the plate: warm, cold, fruit, chocolate, cake, ice cream, something else cheesecakey looking... I didn't get to the pineapple one, but it was also elaborate.

The presentation of the food was very appealing and the flavors come together nicely when one puts it all together.  For example, my seabass - tossed in a light cornstarch, was really bland and the cornstarch overpowered any flavor of the fish. But when  shared with the bok choy and citrus sweet chili sauce, it was pretty good.  Same for my wife's NY strip - grilled w/ just the right amount of char for our tastes, but bland (and I very well know you shouldn't need to season steak). However, once eaten with the ginger soy sauce, it was much better.  So why just ""A-ok"" if everything was pretty good? Because I believe one shouldn't have to add a sauce (at least in both cases for us) to make the dish.

There's an open area filled with seating as well as a bar.  Closer to the back, however, I noticed several rooms for large groups as well as miniature rooms/halls (I'm not exactly sure how to describe it?) for intimate seating.  So basically it was a number of dark (mood-lit?) corridor/rooms for two?  I'm not sure, but I'm glad we sat in the more open area--I think I would've been a little bit afraid to sit in those ones.

Next time I go, I want to get one of the private nooks on the side.  They looked neat.

2010-02-08,3.0,"Upsides: What a fantastic date spot.  IF you get seated in a vault.  My review would not be as good as it is if i had been in general population.  The atmosphere is indeed great here, though you can totally tell that the management group also manages Marche (KDK).  A lot of the decor is interchangeable. The drinks: Serious cocktail menu and good beer list.  The waiter put us on to the strawberry basil martini.  It was the recommendation of the night.  Muddled strawberries, basil and simple syrup with Vodka.  Damn. For the food, we went for the 5-course tasting menu.  Lots of it was great.  Some of it I would have passed on.  It's pricy, but you get a lot of food and you get to eat your way through the menu.  It was worth it because it was a special occasion for us...and I had a groupon. The highlights were the rib sampler - beef and pork.  My wife loved the Scallop and the Shrimp Salad.  They have a beef flatbread thing that happened to be the second thing they warned us was ""supposed to be greasy"".  I liked it, my wife did not. I hat to say it, but I could have done without the pork belly. It relies too heavily on the sauces to carry it.  There's very little flavor otherwise for as complicated as the presentation is.  The Chicken Wings and Chicken Soong were unremarkable. Dessert was another highlight.  My wife got an almond cake with raisin glaze that was excellent.  I got a white chocolate mousse with a cherry ice cream and that came with the apparently-federally-mandated death-by-mini-chocolate cake that is a fixture on all menus where the average entree price is over $10. Service is excellent. So, why the 3-star rating?  Well, they're not quite a 4 in my book, but they're better than a three.  And the food, while by-and-large good, is not outstanding.  I mean, there's not one dish where I would say, ""I can't wait to rush back and try x"".  ...except maybe that strawberry basil drink.  The Singapore sling and the lemongrass marini my wife had were likewise excellent.

It's really red inside. There are 2 levels though I've never been upstairs. Some of the tables near the window are plushy booths which are nice to sit on. For soups, I had the quail egg soup, which I wasn't really keen on. It was just a bit too oily for my tastes. The next time I went I had a potato soup (can't remember full name of it and their website is down) which was pretty good with the right amount of creaminess. Their scallops were cooked to perfection. Scallops always seem like a good test to me because overcooking them is so easy and so apparent. The Peking duck had this nice crispy skin layer.

Not just average, but downright terrible. We've walked past this restaurant several times and always thought it was somewhere we'd like to try due to the neat decor, but after eating there this past weekend, we were VERY disappointed. The only plus was the peach frozen martini (still scheming on the right concoction to re-create it), otherwise the food was poorly seasoned. Everything we ordered had WAY too many hot peppers and was overpoweringly spicy, and I love spicy food!! Not ""flavorful"" spicy either. We ordered the hot-n-sour soup, beef and brocolli, and spicy chicken. I barely touched the soup, and needless to say, we were not too keen on eating the leftovers the next morning. What went wrong?

J. which always makes for a wonderful time and gives me the urge to bump the restaurant up a star or two even though it doesn't deserve it... so as objectively as I can: Pros: - Easy street parking on Wabash.. or maybe we were just lucky? - Great service, friendly staff, complimentary coat check - Wok Wednesdays (1/2 off wok items.. a very good deal!)  - Large portions. I ordered the Kung Pao Beef as part of the Wok Wednesday special, and it was enough for 2 meals.  - Pretty good food. We started with the ginger mussels, which had a very very delicious broth. Would definitely recommend it. My entree (Kung Pao Beef) was not spicy at all (as claimed on the menu), but it was still very flavorful. A little too flavorful I would say, had to drink a lot of water but overall a pretty good dish. My date ordered the Cantonese-Style White Fish Filet, which was very tender and had just the right amount of flavor.  Cons: - Not a huge fan of the decor, seemed a little too dark and almost tacky to me. - Drinks were on the weaker side. - Would have been really expensive if not for the Groupon we used and the fact that it was Wok Wednesday.

The decor is great, but the most important to me are service and food quality which were both horrendous.   We went on New Year's Eve and were in great moods to have some fun!  Unfortunately at Opera it was a NO day, as in they said NO to every request we had...  1) We brought caviar as it was a special gift and we were going to taste it before our meals.  We were told NO way can we eat it there as they would be liable if we got food poisoning.  OK fair enough, I can see their point.  So we tossed it. 2) We ordered the tasting menu which was 70's retro and very creative in the descriptions online.  The waiter, cute guy with tattoos botched up the descriptions completely.  He did not even mention the wine tasting options that would go with the tasting menu.  We asked to order one of the wine tasting options and he said NO, every person in the party has to order the wine tasting with the menu tasting menu.  OK I can understand that everyone has to order the tasting menu (food), but the wine?  What if someone was an alcoholic in the group?  Does NOT make sense! 3) The bill was $130 ish.  We had a $100 and a $50 coupon.  We were told that we can not use the remainder of the gift cert for tax and tip.  OK makes sense.  THEN we were told that NO we can not use the 2 gift cards and then get a $20 ish gift card back.  We would be wasting $20...  I have NEVER heard of that one!   So you have to plan your night to use every single penny on the gift card?  We used the $100 gift cert and then I had to pay for the difference on my credit card. On top of that the food was really mediocre.  The crab appetizer was not good, the ""liver and onions"" was foie gras and onions was very good (hard to mess that one up), the ""stroganoff"" lamb in a pastry shell was not very good and the dessert ""jello mold"" was ok.  We asked the waiter to slow down as I was not even done with my course and he would bring another one out.  When he brought the 3rd course out rushing again, he said he was sorry but the chef had it done already... well send it back brain trust, we are not ready yet!!   We were out of there before the champagne toast.  The General Manager Sarah seemed good and sent us to a table at Marche for the champagne toast.  It was not so happening at Marche either, though the vaudeville theme was very cool.  The junior manager Amber at Opera was useless and I believe that it was her and the waiter who failed big time in Customer Service department.  For the food, they still need to do a lot of work to figure out what they want to be when they grow up!  Save your money.",0.9908,0.739,0.159,0.102,0.5031512799369942

The food was absolutely delicious and can only be described as upscale Chinese. I have to point out that each dish tasted significantly different while being delicious. Usually, Chinese food has a common base, so everything tastes the same. Not here. And that's what makes this place so good. I have to agree with Maurice Y. concerning the food. Every bite is so flavorful, that you'll need a couple cups of water to clean your palate over the course of the dinner. Overall, I would not hesitate to go here again. I would give this place 5 stars if their portions were a bit larger, though I do commend them for not catering to the obese mindset. Oh! I almost forgot to mention the vaults.

2009-12-09,3.0,"I had to wait a couple of days before posting this review because my initial gut reaction would have been too critical.  However, I feel like there are very redeeming characteristics of this place, and after careful thought - I've placed this restaurant in the ""A-OK"" rank.  If you're bored of reading by now, here's something to sum it up: Go to 65 Asian Kitchen and ask for similar dishes which they will give to you in styrofoam containers.  Put them on nice plates.  Voila...you have the Opera lunchbox special for about half the cost. I do, however, want to offer more of an objective review on this place: Location: 4 out of 5 Easily accessible by public transportation.  If you're taking the El, get off at the Roosevelt stop and walk towards Wabash.  Go south about a block.  If you're driving on LSD or 90/94, get off at Roosevelt and go south on Wabash.  Six of us walked from work at Jackson and Clark and it took about 25 - 30 minutes each way.  Not a bad idea if you have an afternoon to kill because it's the quiet season in the office. Decor: 4 out of 5 As others have alluded to, the building was once used in the film industry, and remnants of its history are still around.  Overall, I would describe the decor as being a controlled whimsy.  There ARE bright colors that bombard you.  The ducts are painted to look like wood.  There are vintage pictures of movie stars.  Would I have preferred more muted colors?  Absolutely, yes.  But for what the restaurant is trying to do, it's perfectly in line, and I must give credit where it is due.  Not sure if this is where I should put it, but upon being seated, ask for a table that's further away from the first set of windows, as that area is drafty.   Service: 2 out of 5 You must take this with a grain of salt, as after lunch I asked a co-worker if service was faster for dinner, and he attested that indeed, it was.  It was a Monday at 11:30 or so, and when all was said and done, the lunch time crowd that I saw was no more than 12 - 15 people.  As the host and two others were playing all positions of entertaining everyone (Taking orders, seating, explaining the menu, getting drinks, etc.) I understand a little delay, but what we experienced, I thought - was a little on the slow side.  Don't get me wrong - the man was friendly and helpful, but the speed at which he worked was underwhelming.  There were nice touches, of course.  The hot tea was presented in a wooden box in neat rows, and we were allowed to pick which one(s) we wanted on the spot.  Again, my main gripe was with time.  Towards the end of lunch, what appeared to be some type of manager appeared, and that alleviated wait times. Quantity of food: 4 out of 5 I can't complain about the amount of food we got for the fixed price lunch menu.  I started off with a duck wonton soup, went to a shrimp dish with veggie fried rice, and ended with a mini creme brulee.  This ties into my allusion earlier to 65 Asian Kitchen, as that place also serves you great quantities of food. Quality of food: 3 out of 5 This category is what gave me pause before writing, because none of the food I had was particularly bad, per se.  Instead, I just expected a bit more creativity, a bit more inspiration, and as ye old man from Ratatouille said, a bit more.....perrrsppeccctive.  The duck wonton soup fine.  The wonton itself was meaty enough, and there were vermicelli noodles as well as ""regular"" ones in the broth floating around with a few vegetables.  My co-workers who had the same soup complained that the broth was too bland, but to me, it was perfect because if you really taste the broth, and I mean REALLY taste it, it's actually naturally flavored with whatever else they simmered in it.  The kungpao shrimp that I had was the weakest link in the meal.  Oversauced would be the one word I would use to describe it.  Forget 65 Asian Kitchen on this front, because any Chinese takeout place could slap the same dish together.  The high point of my meal was the mini creme brulee with specks of vanilla bean.  Absolutely no complaints there.  Again, it's not that the food at Opera was bad, it just wasn't anything memorable.   Pricing: 3 out of 5 Double edged sword.  By trendy standards, 15 bucks for a fixed price lunch menu is a steal.  By logical standards, 15 bucks for Chinese takeout with the added benefit of a creme brulee is excessive.  Go into the experience with one attitude or the other, and you'll come out at opposite ends of the happiness spectrum. Other notes: The umbrella that comprises of Opera, Marche, Gioco, and Red Lantern are doing a deal right now where if you buy 100 dollars in gift certificates, you get 50$ free.  Not a bad deal, in my opinion.  And as you're paying for the experience anyway, or for someone else to have the experience, it makes a decent present. Overall: 3 out of 5.",0.9883,0.845,0.099,0.057,0.4879362623328139

Opera is decorated in rich, sumptuous colors with big chandeliers (like Marche) and thick drapery (like Carnaval) lending privacy to certain tables in the back (if you make reservations for a romantic date, ask to be seated in this semi-private area). Like Marche, it features an open kitchen so you can observe the chefs creating their masterpieces, which I always thought was cool. Ambience abounds.  For starters, we selected the beef satay, which sounds so ordinary but was anything but, and the Fragrant Minced Chicken Soong, which was complemented with plum sauce and some chili sauce which was so spicy that it forced us to order many, many martinis to sooth our palate: French Martini, Black Currant Martini, Ruby Peach Martini, you get the picture ;)  (**On Fridays, they have a recession special of 2 martinis and 1 appetizer for $15**).  I had their Beef and Asparagus entree, which again doesn't sound sexy but was delicious. I was so full but I couldn't stop eating it.

2009-10-21,3.0,"Opera used to be a weekly regular meal for me.  Chef Paul Wildemuth was able to work absolute magic to create modern Chinese fusion dishes that were alive and dynamic.  He also had wonderful soups, specials almost every day, and we often got a little something extra from him, sometimes something not on the menu.  Then Paul did the unthinkable: leave for a country club.  He hired Beverly Kim as a replacement, a young Korean chef who had an impressive background from the Ritz-Carleton under Chef Sarah Stegner (now of Prairie Grass Cafe) and Charlie Trotter's. She replicated some of Paul's classics and also added some of her unique dishes to the menu.  One thing she made for us quite often was a Korean soup that was considered a fortifying tonic, a recipe from her grandmother.  Her work was lighter, more refined, more subtle, but still excellent.  This is when I stopped being able to eat any Chinese food. Since then, they have again switch chefs to Chef Erica Leigh Fisher, a former sous chef of Chef Jackie Shen's from Red Light.  She is also young (graduated culinary degree in 2007).  I took a moment to review her menu and a lot of the flair Paul and Beverly had put into it seems to be gone, so I don't know how it is now.  Oddly enough, I can't find any reference to where Chef Kim went. Physically, the room is amazingly decorated and lit, with a hip, vibrant feel that is high-energy.  The staff is fun and I loved chatting with them.

Atmosphere: this is what makes it worth the trip.  The decor is stellar, there is no pretense, or snooty attitude from the employees, it's a young professional crowd on a Saturday night, and there's no rush; we all felt free to relax and soak up the environment.  The little rooms seemed like they would be good for a date, but our group sat in the large open area next to the windows and enjoyed the entire place.

Entrees, the 3 of us shared the Peking Duck 3 presentations, and the Hong Shao Short Ribs.  The Peking Duck is a half duck served 3 ways - (1) traditional with moo shu wrappers - this was very good, no complaints.  Duck was juicy, skin was crunchy.  3 wraps and about 6 pcs of duck, served with hoisin sauce and chopped scallions.  Too bad it was just 1 per person.  (2) Duck and thigh were served cut up whole, roasted, in a sweet orangy plum sauce.  To be honest, I didn't try much because I was busy eating everything else.  It looked dry, but the 2 bites I took were juicy.  (3) Served kind of like a pad see ewe - large soft broad noodles, egg, broccoli, mushrooms.  Duck was cut up really small, could barely see it, but could taste it - this was REALLY good.  We were so busy enjoying the duck that we forgot about the short ribs on the side of the table!  The short ribs were AMAZING.  It was a huge portion of ribs served over crispy noodles with green beans.  YUM YUM YUM.  The ribs tore apart so easily and melted in our mouths.  Flavored wonderfully, and the noodles and green beans were a great compliment.  Oh, and we also ordered the tempura green beans - WOW these were soo good, I ate them all night long, and they stayed crunch all night long!  The peppercorn soy sauce was my fav sauce.  In all, the 2 entrees & green beans were plenty of food for 3 people.   Skipped dessert as we were too full.  Bill after our $50 off was about $70, so pretty awesome for 3 people!  I'd definitely love to go back to explore the rest of the menu, and would definitely order the short ribs again.",0.9995,0.702,0.263,0.035,0.5245528792912512

Plus, it had that Chinese restaurant smell that hit me as soon as I walked in. We opted to eat outside. That kind of stink lingers in your hair long after you leave. Service is solid. Everyone is professional and gracious, which I always appreciate. We went on a Tuesday, which is when they offer a  $28 3 course prix fixe meal. First course: Shrimp Goyza, Crisp Lobster Springrolls -Shrimp Gyozas were really delicious! 4 pieces actually stuffed with enough shrimp (I hate it when they call it something but it's mostly fillers). The chili relish was really tasty. Spicy and sweet. My only complaint with this dish was that the relish was cold and I would have preferred it warm like the goyza. -Lobster Springrolls didn't taste like lobster. At all. Standard fried spring roll, nothing special. Presentation of both appetizers was pretty. Second course: Kung Pao Beef, Spare Ribs -Kung Pao Beef was swimming in sauce that was entirely too salty. It could have been a fantastic dish if it was more spicy (it was labeled spicy but totally wasn't), coated lightly with the sauce, and not overcooked (some pieces of beef were more tough than others). I ended up picking out the pieces of beef and trying to get all the sauce off before eating it. And yet, still too salty. I ended up eating more rice to offset the saltiness. -Spare Ribs were tender but a little too fatty. Still, tasted pretty good. Not as salty as the other dish. Dessert: creme brulee, toasted chocolate coconut something or other. -Creme brulee was HUGE and tasted light. I thought it was pretty good. -toasted chocolate coconut was really strange. It looked like a chocolate muffin with creme on top and little pineapple bits. The creme didn't really taste like coconut. Actually, it didn't really taste like anything. And the chocolate muffin had the texture of flourless chocolate cake. It had a bit of bitterness from cocoa but didn't taste particularly chocolatey. The strongest flavor was the tart pineapple. I might return, but I don't think the food is particularly worth it. They really need to reel back on their sauces. Try low sodium kikkoman soy sauce.

Bad:   -  there were small flies all over our table.  when we mentioned this to the waitstaff, they apologized and had us move to the table right next to it.  the flies just eventually migrated over.   -  some of the actual ingredients used to make the dishes were not at all the quality they needed to be, especially since it's a relatively nice restaurant.  for example, the mussels, while prepared well, did not taste fresh, i think they were purchased frozen and thawed Ugly - the steak was done wrong.  it was a new york strip and tasted like a sirloin cut.  and it was overdone.  i ordered it medium rare and it came out well done (maybe medium-well, i dunno.  regardless, both are levels of doneness that a steak should never be).  an overcooked steak is one of my biggest pet peeves and the reason for the 2 stars.  i regret not actually saying something directly to the chef at the time, but how can you have any sort of culinary experience and overcook a steak?",0.6507,0.868,0.087,0.046,0.5241393527107813

I've been to Red Light (Asian Fusion place, same owner) which was awesome, so I figured this place would be pretty comparable and worth the extra penny. Unfortunately, I was in for a serious disappointment. I typically do not give a negative review for food that arrives to the table quickly, but I am going to write one for Opera. Our food literally took 6 minutes AND it was cold. This makes me think we got someone else's mistake. My boyfriend had the Slow Roasted Pork Tenderlion--it was cold, dry, and lacking flavor. My Singapore Noodles were also dry. They had some spice to them, but they other than that there was minimal flavor. Not to mention, the portion was much smaller than I was expecting...  I essentially paid 24 dollars for a dish with four prawns and a fist full of dry noodles.  I do have to say, if you're looking for a restaurant with a great dining atmosphere, then this would be the place. It's super cute--in an eclectic kind of way.  All in all, I'd probably give them 4 stars for the ambiance and one star for the food. But who knows, maybe we just ordered the wrong things or dined in on an off night??

The prix fixe is great for birthdays, I think.  A diner can order anything on the menu as long as it fits into the appetizer, entree, dessert.  The tasting menu was a lovely way to spend New Year's Eve.  My only complaint with the longer tasting menu was that the time between courses was at time quite long.  However, we had a table of vegans, vegetarians and carnivores.  So, I imagine the chef was quite overwhelmed trying to balance all three varieties.  But, the great thing is, Opera did it!  I conclude then that Opera is a great place to bring a group.

We took my dad here for his birthday one year, and he liked it, but said, ""You know, why is fried rice $17?"" The Tuesday night $25 prix fixe menu is a winner, and outside of that, the scallop dish, several of the chicken dishes, and the dessert (creme brulee especially) are amazing. I like the fact that they offer several vegan/vegetarian options, and that they also ask if you're allergic to anything before serving you. I could do without the snobby attitude of the bartenders and hostesses, but that's possibly because I live right down the street.  Tourists staying at the Hilton have a tendency of stopping me and asking for restaurant recommendations and if they're looking for something a little ""upscale"" that's not going to break the bank, I send them here.

The decor is pretty cool and artsy-unusual, and the service was friendly and prompt. I also love that they have a separate vegan menu, however small it may be, and however confusing (it's not separated into traditional groupings of appetizer-entree-dessert, so make sure to ask what's what). Now onto the food. The morel mushroom wontons were pretty good but nothing spectacular. Morels are delicate, so I wasn't sure that deep frying them in batter was the best cooking treatment. The portion size was kind of small considering the price ($9). My Mapo tofu was also decent, but nothing special. The portion size was much larger, even though the price was only $8, so I'm not sure how they set prices. The flavors were a strange mix of sweet and spicy, but I found the dish became boring after ten or fifteen bites. There were two other vegans in my group and one of them was greatly disappointed by her ""vegetable rice noodle stir fry"" which she found to be overly sweet with low quality noodles. I tried her dish and concurred---it was almost sugary, rather than savory. Finally, the last vegan in the group enjoyed her ""spring vegetable muushu."" So while I must give the restaurant kudos for having a vegan menu, and having hip decor and nice service, I was not impressed by the food.

I'm not gonna lie, I wouldn't mind turning in my Asian card to drench my rice in Opera's black peppercorn sauce... BUT: The meat itself was not great.

However, if you're trying to base your decision on the reviews below, make sure you're reading reviews of the food, and not just the atmosphere. Unfortunately, there was nothing else enjoyable about our experience at Opera tonight.  I had read very good reviews of the place and have many a time lamented the lack of good Chinese food downtown, so I was very excited when Mr. Z. made a reservation here.  The elegant feel of the place was diminished when we received our menus...plastic folders barely containing a faded xerox of a page that looked as if it had been left in a back pocket and run through the laundry. Our tablecloth? Paper over padded vinyl. I ordered a beer that was decent, but very small, and ended up costing us $9. For our appetizer, we ordered the Morel Mushroom Wontons, which I thought sounded delicious. They weren't terrible, however they were swimming in an oily citrus sauce that made the bottoms of them quite soggy.  Our entrees had to be better, we thought. Oh god, were we wrong. I ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken and he ordered the Firecracker Chicken...two dishes that sound hard to scew up. They were both disgusting. The breading on mine (which our server played up as ""velveted"") was soggy and the chicken in both our dishes was mush...literally, you didn't have to use your teeth to eat it. Gross. So we sent them both back, which is something we have NEVER done at a restaurant in all our years together. The front of house manager came to apologize and then offered suggestions as to what we might order instead. Being somewhat discouraged by their seeming inability to ""cook"" anything properly, I went for the Zuke Ahi Tuna Salad, and Mr. Z., on the manager's recommendation, ordered the Filet Mignon. When we received our dishes, we were initially encouraged by the presentation. However I was blown away by how terrible the tuna was. Seriously, it tasted like a rubbery, luke-warm fishstick that had been soaked in oil. It tasted fishy, too...seared ahi should NEVER taste fishy. And the salad greens that accompanied were limp and less than fresh. His steak was edible, but overcooked--he had asked for medium and it was visibly dry. Also, they didn't even give him a steak knife. What's up with that? We were both appalled by the food at Opera, and even more appalled at our $90 bill. Just ridiculous. And the best part is....now we're both sick!  Needless to say, we will not be back. Please don't waste your money.",0.8795,0.792,0.114,0.094,0.5843127321850726

I went with the lobster spring roll appetizer, the peking duck ""three ways"" (moo shu - yes!, with noodles, and a crispy wing and thigh), and the eponymous flourless chocolate cake, and all were very tasty - certainly of a higher quality than your run-of-the-mill Chinese takeout joint, but not overly foo-foo.  My date went with the shrimp dumplings, the scallops, and a banana pudding-cake sort of concoction (I'm sorry, I forgot the actual name of the dish), and based on my samplings of each, I would order them were I to return.  The only thing that I did not enjoy was my end of the night capuccino, which quite frankly sucked, but hell, this wasn't an Italian restaurant so I deserved what I got. Service was solid, and the atmosphere was funky, but pretty cool (thick wood beamed ceilings, lots of deep reds, and vintage chairs and tables.  The decor seemed to have nothing to do with China, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Well it was a banana date bread pudding, with a vanilla caramel cream sauce and some cognac ice cream on the side. Thank god my company hates banana's, it just meant I got to keep it all to myself. Lovely, luscious, luxurious and above all mine! It was wonderful.  I really did have a great time, service was very good, though I would have preferred to have been checked on a few more times.

The food is consistently good  - not amazing -  but always tasty, with unusual flavour combinations transforming many ordinary Chinese dishes into soemthing much more enjoyable. The peking duck trio is great, as are the shrimp dishes. Recently the Australian lamb and barramundi dishes have also been very good. Meal servings tend to be on the large size. The wine list is, however,  a weakness. There are some fine selections, just not enough of them and they are very overpriced. Goldeneye pinot noir for example, retails around $50 and sells at Opera for $140ish. Unfortunately this applies to most of the wines, meaning that I'm unlikely to buy something good that I can buy for a third of the price somewhere else. Dessert can be hit and miss and why they continue to put the paper menus in crappy plastic sleeve beats me.

Colorful and vibrant asian infused art, somewhat like my bedroom. Even the bathrooms are decadent.  If you're either a ravage beast or can manage to starve yourself for a day or two, go ahead and order the Chef's tasting menu.  An unbelivable 9 course tasting. Yes, NINE! It starts out small with something like a poki dish, then gradual works its way to the piece de la resistance - filet mignon. And ofcourse, dessert is waiting for you at the end if you can stomach it. We wrapped ours up as we were running late for the show. The dinner took almost 2 and a half hours!!! But it  was some of the yummiest dishes I've ever eaten. As an added overload, we ordered the wine pairing with the tasting. Wow! NINE glasses of wine, one served with each dish. So not only were we stuffed to the gils, but pretty bubbly. Perfect. Even though we took a deep breathe when we received our bill (next time we'll actually look at the menu prices), Opera still remains one of my favorite places.",0.9453,0.866,0.095,0.039,0.48935185185185187
2007-12-10,5.0,"I went here for the 1st time last weekend for my buddy's birthday, and we were treated like absolute royalty. It was almost awkward when you consider that the 10 of us guys would be happy having window pickle races at the nearest Burger King.  They put us in our own room for 10. I LOVE the decor...over sized colorful lamps and mirrors everywhere. You can't forget about the drapes and the pictures of Jack ""the Joker"" Nicholson in the bathroom. Normally I tend to think that ""loud"" decor can lead to overpriced and overrated (cough--Sushi Samba Rio), but Opera left my in awe.  On to the food!!! We shared a bunch of Golden Shrimp appetizers as well as the Sticky Ribs. I have never had ribs that sweet, tangy, and tasty before. The shrimp packed a punch of spice but had a subtle finish that didn't leave your mouth burning. I highly recommend both.  Since we had a huge group, they offered family style dinner for $45, $55, or $75. We passed on this option (which I am glad we did) and decided to order off the menu. I had firecracker shrimp that lived up to its' name. I love spice, and this was right up my alley. My favorite thing I tried was the duck presentation, which was duck 3 ways. One was a pad Thai duck, and the 2nd one I tried was duck under a slice of pineapple with Hawaiian influence. It was fabulously seasoned, and the flavors were very clean and did not take away from the taste and texture of a good piece of duck.  Our group left full and extremely happy. I would recommend Opera for a fun night out with friends or an experience to definitely have you suburban parents check out (and pay for, as it can be a bit pricey). I was here on a Saturday, and while they did have some nifty little nooks/private rooms, this place was mainly one large room, which can create a heck of a lot of noise that can shatter the intimacy factor.",0.9974,0.79,0.203,0.007,0.5598214285714285

I'd venture to say this place will be around or a while since its close to the Hilton and with the appropriate ""incentives"" the staff will send them lots of business....which is fine.

We had a guest in town, so we decided to treat him to Opera on a prixe fixe night.  They have raised their prices to $28.75 a person for their prixe fixe dinners on Sundays and Tuesdays.  Definitely still a bargain given their portions and their normal prices. We decided to share the entire meal.  For appetizers, we chose the Ahi Tuna, Chopstick Crabcake, and of course their Duck Mushuu.  Everything was amazing and delicious.  For entrees, we chose the Duck Three way, Australian Rack of Lamb and their Mongolian Beef and Broccoli.  The lamb, hands down was one of the best that I had ever eaten, the duck, AWESOME!!!!  (Sorry...no other word can describe the flavor explosion or the meatiness of the duck.)  The Mongolian Beef which was prepared with a filet...I would definitely not recommend.  It was boring, and the mushrooms were woody...nothing Mongolian at all.  For dessert, we chose the tower of Chocolate, The trio of Creme Brulee, and something banana.  All yummy, but I'm greedy, I wish that the portions of Creme Brulee were larger.  We also brought our 2 year old, and I have to say that despite that Opera is a great place to bring kids.  It is loud enough that the banter and fussiness of a 2 year old doesn't intrude or spoil the evening for other guests, yet quiet enough that you can still hear yourselves speak.  The bright eclectic decor is also interesting enough to keep them preoccupied.  Staff was friendly and informative.  Drinks are a little bit on the pricey side, but not shocking.  I'd highly recommend Opera.",0.9965,0.775,0.195,0.031,0.5683506944444444

2007-11-14,5.0,"So I was a little nervous about Opera since I am always very hesitant about trying pan-asian types of restaurants but what attracted me to try Opera was the fact that they are not your regular run of the mill chinese restaurant. They take a traditional asian dish but they add the flair, ingredients, and presentation of contemporary american dishes. It combines the best of both worlds! I would recommend coming to Opera for the $30 pre-fix menu where for just $30 you choose an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. It's a great deal considering that just ordering an entree can get you close to $30 already. My only complaint was that some of the dishes came out lukewarm.  I would definitely go back here again, especially for the pre-fix menu! Crab & Chopstick   LOVED the presentation, set next to a big crab cake are two long ""chopsticks"" that are spring rolls filled with this spicy crab filling. Sea Scallops   This dish was amazing and exceeded my expectations! Three scallops set atop a bed of polenta and surrounded by this amazing rich brown XO sauce that taste more like an exquisite blur blanc sauce. Sooo yummy!

Note: if you get a chance, request seating in the ""cubbie"" area, which is basically the once-vault area. Our party of seven ordered plenty appetizers and most everyone agreed that they were phenomenal. Dinner arrived shortly thereafter, although the same favorable reaction wasn't received by the main entre. Perhaps this was because we were all enveloped in heart-felt conversation, but I personally did not enjoy the Firecracker  Chicken. Opera offers several wonderful desserts on the menu, and they will suffice to round out your dining experience. The pastry chef should be commended for creating an interesting pallet of dessert choices, though it is a fairly safe combination. All in all, Opera is worth the price tag (seven people for approximately $430) and the establishment offers fine service and excellent ambience. The food selections weren't extraordinary, but I would recommend it when in the South Loop and looking for a moderately ""upscale"" establishment.",0.9891,0.769,0.202,0.029,0.5127777777777777

So with some trepidation, I came here fully expecting to empty my wallet without filling my stomach. I was wrong. First, the cold sesame noodle appetizer was overpriced but delicious. Perfectly chilled, with a slight crunch that I think came from deep fried crushed peanuts. It was overpriced because I ate it all in about 3 bites. The entrees we ordered- beef with asparagus, scallops with corn pollenta, Singapore style noodles- were overpriced but very good. The beef, I'm pretty sure, was cut from a filet, which would justify it's $26 price tag. The scallops (all 3 of them) were large and quite good.  So if everything was overpriced, why am I giving it 4 stars, you ask? Because they also gave us free food. A complimentary sauteed string bean entree and 3 complimentary dumpling appetizers. For no apparent reason. For that, we gave the waitress a good size tip and this place gets 4 stars.",0.9912,0.706,0.234,0.06,0.5571858465608466

Trendy room, but warm and inviting, not cold and stark. The food, however, was just average. And for the price, average won't do. If I am going to pay $17 - $26 for stir-fry dishes, they had better be stunning! Think about it this way - if you went into a really fancy Italian place, say Cocco Pazzo or Cafe Spiaggia, the pasta dishes would be $14 - $18 and would be fantastico. In my mind, a good pasta dish is like a good stir fry - a nice sauce to ladle over lots of carbs. It certainly isn't rocket science, especially so close to Chinatown. It's PEASANT food for f's sake, just like pasta, just like a big honkin' burrito, just like shepard's pie. Can you imagine paying $20+ dollars for shepard's pie? Anyway, we had firecracker chicken, slow-roasted salmon and the peking duck service. Portions were immense and the food was good, but in the end it was still basically stir-fry.

Morel Mushroom Wontons- Superb.The two Vegans literally split the 7th one in half. They loved them. Lobster Egg Rolls- Really nice as well. Their wasn't much lobster, but the flavor was very nice. Haianese Mussels- Best dish of the night. The lemon grass and coconut flavor is so light and delicious. I'd go back just for these. Huge portion with nice size mussels. Dan Dan Mein- did not try this, but the two Vegans were very happy with it and their wasn't a bit of food left on the plate. Hainanese Style Kaipong- OMG...orgasmicly good. Really amazing flavor and the presentation is what really made everyone at the table go ""ooooh aww"" Fillet Mignon- Nice flavor and I would order again Pecking Duck(trio)- AMAZING. So much food, I was shocked. Every single one of the preparations was superb. Flour-less Chocolate Cake trio- The peanut butter egg roll was so good! The choclatey thing next to the cake was the most amazing tasting dessert EVER. The flour-less was not as light and airy as I would have liked, but it was definitely rich and chocolatey. Sorbet- Pineapple-AMAZING. Lychee- INCREDIBLE. Coconut- SPECTACULAR Creme Brulee Trio- ALL of them were to die for.

While I was skeptical at first (why go to this restaurant when the ""real"" Chinatown is only a bit farther south) that this was going to distinguish itself from any other Chinese restaurant- I have left each time feeling like I've discovered some new food combination that I like better than the last. The decor is fun- done up in the style of several of the other restaurants from this group (Red Light, Marche).  I love the way the bar is situated along the one wall open to the restaurant with the giant lamps anchoring each end- a great place to people watch, I might add.  The bartenders are personable and pour a good drink.  I have even stopped in some nights just to have a martini at the bar as it is a nice, quiet place to sit and talk with friends once the dinner rush is over. This used to be an old movie storage warehouse and they have kept some of the vaults in the back and turned them into private dining areas (If you are on a date- great place to sit- otherwise I'd opt for the main room upfront by the kitchen).  The kitchen is open and you can see the food being freshly prepared.  On one of the nights we were there, Chef Paul came around to the table to ask us how it was, which I thought was a nice touch and then served us a complimentary dessert. They have a nice wine list (I like Alsatian wines and they have several excellent choices)  For appetizers, I would suggest the ginger dumplings and the sticky ribs- both delicious!  As for the entrees, I've had the duck- done in three ways (yummy!), the scallops (my fav as I love the rice that comes with them) the beef and broccoli (careful that those you are with don't think that they are getting a typical steak- this is a Chinese restaurant where things are in bite sized pieces- I had a friend disappointed as I guess he must have thought he was at Gibson's or something) ,and the beef and asparagus- all excellent and they come with these Chinese noodles which are good also. As for dessert, trust me I have tried them all and the three chocolate dessert or the flight of different creme brulee's top my list. For those of you driving, there is valet parking, however you can still usually find street parking on this stretch of Wabash (try a block south on 14th St.).

I loved everything I put in my mouth. The one thing I will say is that I was not into the private booths that are supposed to be the most coveted seats in the house.

The $25 prix fixe was such a good deal though (choice of any appetizer/soup, entree, and dessert) that I will go back and try other things.",0.994,0.719,0.274,0.007,0.5577167277167278

The decor is fabulous, similar to a circus/ opera but done in a very tactful way.  I actually had the same server each time I was there, and she was great, nothing spectacular, but knew quite a bit about the menu and the wine.  As other people have mentioned it is pretty pricey, especially the wine, but it's worth it for a nice date or group night out.",0.973,0.816,0.174,0.01,0.5027777777777777

2006-08-27,3.0,"This is a very interesting place to dine. You pay a little bit more for the experience. The dishes are basically standard Chinese items with flair or ""fusion"" dishes. Sitting back in the private vault areas is fun, but you don't have to be disappointed if that area is full as it is not really all that special. I would say only sit there if you are on a date, a table for 4 will be a little cramped and you would rather be out in the main area. I think I would have just sat in the main dining area.  Service was pleasant. I would come here again to try something different or perhaps try their Peking duck which I didnt have last time.",0.8016,0.858,0.1,0.042,0.4261278195488722

2006-08-07,5.0,"I am not sure why I have such an opposing position compared to other reviewers... but I have completely loved everything I ordered here.  I thought the food was fantastic, the wine was above-decent, the decor was fun, and even though the place is a little loud, it isn't as bad as BJs.  I am not sure why one would expect it to be authentic; as far as I can tell, it is Chinese-French fusion.  Creamy spicy goodness, every-which-way.  I come here every time I visit Chicago, and it's a good thing this restaurant is not located in San Jose or within a 50 mile radius there-to, because I would be broke and homeless.  Opera is literally my favorite place to eat.   The last time I was here, the service was excellent, and when I asked for something vegetarian (long story), the waiter very kindly pointed out my options, and then gave me a vegan menu also.  Maybe I get friendly service because I go here with my super-trendy-and-pretty sister-in-law.  That was a lot of hyphenation for one person... It is on the pricy side, but two can eat here for $50 without much trouble.  So I advise you save up those pennies and come on over.

2006-06-26,2.0,"Wow... each time I end up here I just keep getting reminded of how much I miss Saiko (the now closed, most awesomest japanese fusion restaurant EVAR).  This place has good atmosphere and service, but the food served up at Opera can be an insult to chinese food in general.   The noodle dishes are horrible... to the point that you'd get better stuff at the typical $4 chinese take out in nearby Chinatown.  Nothing is really done right - they seem to think that changing from beef to filet mignon or shrimp to lobster automatically makes the dishes better.  I think you'd need to know how to cook chinese food first and foremost in order to make it good.  The ONLY thing that's good here is their Peking Duck but you can get it twice as big and twice as good also in nearby Chinatown.  Don't waste your time and money on their suped up ""chinese"" food.  Just drive a couple of miles further to Chinatown if you're craving chinese.",0.9609,0.838,0.131,0.031,0.37957875457875456

I work in the industry, and I don't care how much of a bad day you had, an allergy is an allergy.  Anyway, when I was assured that there were no peanuts in my dish (and it wasn't included in the description on the menu), I was upset to see WHOLE peanuts in my meal.  Ugh.  How frustrating.  I gave it two stars only because I really enjoyed the appetizers, and loved the decor.",-0.9195,0.712,0.115,0.173,0.6548611111111111
