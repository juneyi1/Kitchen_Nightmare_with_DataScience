2007-03-31,3.0,"I am not a bit Brett's fan.  I have been here twice for brunch on the weekend.  The most positive comment I have to make is in regards to the bread basket.  It is full of sweet breads (well, not the glands, but, you know, bread that is sweet) like pumpkin bread, cinnamon bread and banana bread.  Yum.  And this is where my compliments cease.   First off, this is not a deal breaker, but I thought it was odd.  There was a small line at the door when we entered.  We waited there to be seated, and then when it was our turn, the hostess handed us the menus and walked us over to the table.  That is, we carried our own menus to the table.  I saw her do this to other people as well...which was weird.  I mean, she wasn't holding anything, and she works there!  Why did we have to carry the menus?   Okay, enough of that.  The food was just, okay.  I had veggie chili, which is an odd brunch choice, but whateves, stop judging me.  It came in a giant bowl and cost about 10 bucks.  For veggie chili.  What?  Hubby had an omelette, which was kinda small and had shell in it.  So, you know, I wasn't a big fan.  I'd rather hand off my sunday morning money to the crazies at victory's banner any day.",0.8033,0.853,0.087,0.061,0.5363835725677831
2007-02-26,4.0,"A great brunch spot, especially if you're sick of the long waits and excessive noise at other popular north side brunch spots (I'm talking about you, Bongo Room/Toast/Nookies)!  I could have ordered just about anything on the menu and been very happy.  I do feel strongly that the decor is FUG, but I still plan on going back.  And yes, you gotta love that bread basket!",0.9446,0.726,0.243,0.03,0.6923160173160173
2007-02-24,2.0,"The first thing I noticed about Brett's was the higher than usual prices for fairly common breakfast options.  The second was how delicious their basket of sweet breads tasted.  The third was that we had been sitting at our table for over 20 minutes without so much as a nod from a waitress, in a restaruant that was only three fourths full.   No coffee, no 'sorry about the wait', nothing since the bus boy dropped off the bread as we were seated.  We walked out, stomachs full complimentary bread.  2 stars - both for the bread.",0.7096,0.846,0.097,0.057,0.5023809523809524
2007-02-10,2.0,"My fiancee liked her meal and the place, so she's making me give this two stars. If it was up to me, I'd petition yelp for the capability of negative stars. It's so overpriced it's not even funny. I guess when no one goes in to begin with, you have to make your money some how. Amazing it's still in business. There's a reason people line up at Kitsch'n instead of this place.",-0.1793,0.816,0.082,0.103,0.775
2007-01-28,5.0,"Thanks Laura R...for making sure this review went with the correct restaurant... I love this place!  And I love that it is not overcrowded!  I went here for dinner on Friday night with my good friend.  I was early (which, if you know me, is no surprise!) and I came in from the freeeeezing cold to be greeted by the host and soon-to-be our waiter.  He warmly welcomed me and sat me even though my friend didn't show up until closer to our scheduled time.  He sat me across from the fire because that was where he said he would want to sit.   I sat and ordered a glass of wine and they brought me some delicious bread and black olives to munch on while I waited.  When my friend go there, we ordered a bottle of wine and she started on it while I finished my other glass.  The waiter made sure to pour me a glass so that it would breathe and be ready when I was ready to drink it.  Good lookin' out! There was no pressure for us to order and we sat and chatted for quite a while before ordering.  My friend ordered an entree of the menu...the fish tacos, which she said were fantastic!  I ordered off of the special menu...halibut with lentils and a spicy sauce.  When I ordered the halibut grilled instead of sauteed the waiter responded without hesitation: ""of course.""   The food was outstanding and the portions were not too small and not overbearing.  Good blend of spices and the lentils were a nice touch to the perfectly grilled halibut. He brought us the dessert menu, which we originally put aside and instead ordered another good wine by the glass that came per our waiter's recommendation.  Another good choice! Then, as the dessert menu sat there, we opted to order something and split it.  We were between a couple of things, but decided, with the good choices that our waiter had made thus far, to ask his opinion.  He initially recommended something that was chocolate, but we responded that we were not crazy about that much chocolate and inquired about something else.  He recommended the bread pudding, which came with cinnamon ice cream.   DElicious!  But...he insisted that we try the chocolate cake and brought us a little slice of it to split, on the house.  And he topped off our glasses of wine.   It was a wonderful and warm way to start the weekend! I will definitely add this to my ""old reliables"" for meeting up with friends or grabbing a good glass of wine and dessert.",0.9969,0.797,0.189,0.014,0.6346632346632347
2006-05-10,4.0,"I like any place I can sit down on a Sunday with very little waiting, and last Sunday we walked right in and got a table. The basket of coffeecakes and fresh preserves were awesome. All of our food was good, including huevos rancheros and my goat cheese and spinach omelet. We are always looking for places that we can bring our toddler and this place was very kid friendly, and Mia gave the kid's pancake plate the greatest compliment- she finished her food, which is a rarity. I'll be going back to try their dinners!",0.9669,0.768,0.212,0.02,0.4946608946608947
2006-05-04,5.0,"We discovered this place by accident, walking to our car in despair after realizing that the place we'd wanted to have brunch was so crowded there was no way we'd get in before noon. If we have brunch, these days, we go to Brett's.  They give you coffeecake instead of plain bread - a nice twist - the coffee is fantastic, and the brunch menu is fairly extensive. Recently, we haven't been impressed with the service at Brett's.  As the place has become more popular, the management hasn't seemed to notice that an increase in waitstaff might be a good move.  The staff works hard, but there's only so many of them and a LOT of coffeecups to fill.   Still, the food is great and plentiful, the prices are reasonable, and you can walk in and get seated with a cup of coffee in five minutes on a  Sunday at 11am.  Parking can be an issue, since it's street/meter parking and there's a lot of retail and restaurants on the street.  Most of the sidestreets are zoned 24/7 residential, so don't even try it.  Just circle around a few times until someone leaves,  then get a spot within a few blocks.  Walk around the street afterwards - there are some surprisingly good boutiques and interesting stores, including one storefront art gallery that sucked us in for nearly an hour.  Really, a great place for brunch in a fantastic neighborhood.",0.9767,0.803,0.141,0.057,0.594642857142857
