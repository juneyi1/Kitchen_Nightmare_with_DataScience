The cracklins are coated in parmesan cheese and rosemary which takes away some of the pork flavor. I found the coating to have an odd taste.  The proscuitto was good but it was only a couple of pieces with no bread or other accompaniment. I imagined it would be served more as a charcuterie.  We also ordered the spicy sausage link, the gnocchi, and the short rib ravioli. The sausage link was very good, as was the ravioli. The gnocchi lacked flavor to me.  We ended up spending about $65 per person for an ok meal (only one of us had drinks), which for me is too much given all the good and reasonably priced Italian restaurants in the city.

2014-09-28,5.0,"My wife and I had a wonderful dinner here this past weekend. From the moment of booking, everything was perfect. We were able to get a reservation for 530pm on Saturday without issue, and the restaurant itself is incredibly easy to find. It literally sits in the ground floor of one of the Northwestern Hospital buildings at the corner of North St. Clair and Erie. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for indoor seating, and it was worth it. The décor of the restaurant is rustic and spacious. There is an open kitchen area, which adds to the ambiance. Our server John K was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. If you've not been before, the menu consists of a few dozen small plates that should to be shared for your first courses. Then, you choose an entrée that sounds yummy. Make sure to save room for desert as well. For our starters, we went for the aged hanger steak carpaccio, cheese board, and sardines. All were perfect! It's hard to say which one we liked more. I'd say the carpaccio, but my wife would say the cheese board. For the mains, I went for the duck breast with duck sausage and cauliflower, and my wife went for the short rib ravioli. Both were excellent. There is something truly magical about crispy skin on a duck breast! For desert, we went for the doughnuts and the caramel tart. Both were a wonder way to conclude the evening.  I'd highly recommend this place due to the great food, high quality service, and ease of location.",0.9903,0.843,0.153,0.004,0.6115509259259259

Like some other reviews I have seen of this restaurant we were not blown away by anything.  The restaurant looks great and the service was very good, however I think we were over-sold on every dish.  We started with some meatballs, which were a let down: a bit dry and the sauce was pretty average. We also shared some sausage and peppers which were good but not great. We also ordered a margarita flatbread to share and I thought they did a nice job with this, but to be fair it is hard to mess up.  For our main course two of us had the braised short rib ravioli and one had the pork shoulder and the other had the corn fettuccini. Like the meatballs, the short rib ravioli sauce was a little pedestrian - and someone made the comment that it tasted like Ragu. The pork shoulder was also dry and there were giant cuts of bread included in the dish (too much), the star of the plate was the fennel.  The corn fettuccini dish was very sweet and compared to baby food.  I enjoyed the drinks we had including the wine we had at the table, but with food left on our plates we passed on dessert and got the check.",0.9882,0.789,0.18,0.031,0.5547453703703704

The second best dish was the Venetian seafood stew which had a wide variety of seafood including prawns, lobster, mussels, squid, and calamari. The couscous and tomatoes sauce went great with ciabatta bread but I'm also a fan of dipping bread in sauces. At the end, we were given complimentary limoncello which was very strong.

I definitely scraped up the last bits of this dish. We also had the Venetian seafood stew--- also very delicious. Yes, CIcchetti definitely knows how to do seafood well--- which I feel is a hard feat in the Midwest.  We finished with the sundae---- not my choice, as I would have wanted to try the revgerse affogato, but whatever, dessert is dessert.

We've made it a 'thing' to make a big restaurant judgement based on this classic pizza/flatbread - this thing was so unusual but not in a good way.

Overall, I was very unimpressed with Cichetti. We started off with a cheese plate and burrata. The cheeses were decent as was the included grape and parsley salad. The apple compote (or whatever it was) was very good but incredibly sweet. The bread appeared to be made in house and was very good when it first arrived and was warm. It slowly became average bread. As for the burrata, my mom called it ""tasteless."" My wife and I have had much better burrata as well. This one had an overpowering amount of lemon. It was also odd that they didn't serve it with some bread or something to put it on. The short rib ravioli was nothing special at all. The meat, pasta, and sauce were all fine, but I'm not sure I'd use the word ""good."" The sauce was sweet with the right amount of acid, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The mushroom pizza was alright, although parts of it were overly-charred and it was a little bland. My mom felt that her salmon was undercooked and sent it back, and that is something she rarely does. None of the desserts really sounded appealing, so we passed. Lastly, with your bill they bring complimentary lemoncello. I literally thought it was one of the worst liquids I've ever consumed. It tasted like ground lemon rinds and rubbing alcohol. Portion sizes were small, and the food was generally overpriced. As for the service, it didn't get off to a great start. We were seated promptly, but our server seemed to lack confidence and comfort. She did improve as the meal went along, but it was definitely nothing special. Overall, things were prompt and glasses were generally filled.

2014-07-06,3.0,"Went here with a big group of friends on a Sunday to grab a bite for Brunch. Even though we didn't have a reservation, they were able to accommodate us on their outside patio. For my meal, I went with the baked egg venetian strata. I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting myself into, but I liked all of the ingredients, so I decided to give it a shot. Basically, it was a very eggy baked item with hollandaise sauce and pickled vegetables. The vegetables were a bit overly pickled in my opinion and didn't really pair well with the strata. The problem with this is that the strata was very rich and sort of one dimensional flavor-wise and needed something to break it up. I used a bit of tabasco and ketchup to break up the richness, but I was left a little bit at odds with my dish.

2014-07-05,3.0,"Finally got around to trying this place! For months now I've been jealous of all the happy faces I see in the windows and patio as I walk by. After being supremely disappointed in their lunch-time sister restaurant Sopraffina next door, I've been eager to try this place, with the idea that all their effort goes into Cicchetti, while Sopraffina is like their embarrassing ugly step-child.  Giving it 3 stars was a tough decision. The place has its ups and downs. What's great is the service once you're seated, the decor, and the outdoor lounge seating. What's bad is the restaurant's ""snooty"" attitude towards walkins; I've tried to come in before and gotten the same response: you walk in without a reservation, the hostess looks around and ignores ALL of the many EMPTY tables both inside and out, and comes up with an arbitrarily long wait time (at least 30 mins). This last time we simply sat at their empty bar and ate, which was fine for me.  As for the food, it also has it's good and bad parts.  What's good: The Braised Short Rib Ravioli really is as good as they say. Every bite was delicious, and I was sorry I had elected to share it with my buddy. The only bad part is that it's only like 3 pieces of ravioli. I should order several orders worth next time and ask them to put it in a bowl.  The roasted olives wIth focaccia & spreads was also good. 3 separate times they mentioned something being 150 years old with this dish... I think the bakery that makes the bread or something? Whatever it was they were proud of it, and it was a nice appetizer.  What was disappointing:  The Morel Mushroom Risotto - I've never seen or tasted risotto quite like this, and not in a good way. It resembled a gooey porridge underneath, and tasted just as bland. Definitely skip this. Also, as much as I hate to say so: the Reverse Affogato was not as good as everyone says. The server touted their award-winning pastry chef, and I bet this dish would have been tasty, but the donuts it comes with were stale. I'm thinking It may have been an off-day for them.  I do want to come back and try again. Even if it's just to share a pitcher on the patio.",0.9242,0.824,0.109,0.067,0.5789399092970522

I have been to the restaurant in Venice last year and it is nothing compared to Cicchetti and while Cicchetti claims to be a small tapas Italian restaurant, they do have large portion dishes. SImply put, the food just was not that good.  We started off with Roasted mushrooms, fontina mornay, scallions, chili-garlic  flatbread pizza. The pizza was flavorful and probably the only good thing we ate. Honestly, how can you mess up a flatbread, nowadays it seems like everyone has flatbread on their menu.  For entrees, we ordered the Saffron Rissoto and Gnocchi with Braised Pork Shank. The Rissoto was undercooked and lacked flavor. The saffron was too overpowering. The Gnocchi absolutely had no taste, all you can taste is the dough.  The only other good thing that we had was the dessert, the dessert matches up to the hype. We had the Reverse Affogato which is dognuts with coffee gelato and vanilla malted milk. This is a must. You can eat dip the doughnuts in the coffee gelato and the vanilla milk and its mind-blowing! I would probably not go back here again. With a slew of Italian restaurants popping up in Chicago over last 3-4 months, I would be interested to see if this restaurant has a chance to compete with the others and more notably, Nico Osteria.",0.3233,0.896,0.055,0.049,0.44859307359307365

The space is bright, vibrant, and airy; the staff is friendly and knowledgable; and the food is exceptional.

We started with cocktails - I had the Bello Vecchio, which was a great balance between tasty and strong - and the roasted mushroom pizza. It was crispy, delicious, and just the right amount to start us off.  Then, as girls are wont to do, we carbo-loaded and ordered one of each of the four pastas. So worth it. The saffron risotto was comforting and creamy, the orecchiette with lamb was flavorful with a hint of spiciness, the gnocchi was pillowy and delicious, and the short rib ravioli was saucy and savory...everything you could want in a pocket of pasta.  We were seated right by the kitchen so witnessed the constant parade of servers carrying plates of donuts to different tables, so obviously, we had to get in on that. The reverse affogato is their best-selling dessert for a reason: donuts and ice cream, helllooo.

While it isn't really my cup of tea, I predict it'll do alright in this location, with its contemporary décor and small plate emphasis. I wasn't captivated about many of the menu choices, but that's just a matter of personal tastes. The ambiance didn't do much for me, either: it has sort of a pricey lunchroom feel, with very plain tables & chairs, lots of glass and a minimalist sensibility. And noise -- it has noise. Foodwise, a shaved root veggie salad was pleasant. Charred baby squid in ink with polenta was OK -- the flavors were fine, but the squid had a slimy mouthfeel. Our favorite dish was short rib ravioli; the richness & texture were just right, and the sauce bright & lively. Pan-roasted hake was OK, though not at all memorable (save for a pretty good romesco sauce & very fresh hazelnuts). Dessert was ""reverse affogato,"" with malted milk poured over espresso gelato with donuts on the side -- very witty, and tasty, too.

2014-03-17,5.0,"My friend and I made reservations for dinner at Cicchetti on a Monday night. Although the restaurant was nearly empty when I arrived around 5:30 pm, almost every table was spoken for as we were leaving so I strongly recommend a reservation to guarantee yourself a seat. I arrived a little early and grabbed a cocktail at the bar before my friend arrived. I went with the Buongiorno and it was the perfect choice-St. George Terroir Gin, Aperol, Bergamot, Lemon, and a frothy Egg White to top it off. Once we were seated we got right down to business and ordered a bottle of red wine and an order of Nonna's Meatballs. Served in a Pancetta Tomato Sauce with a couple chucks of Ciabatta for dipping, these are definitely not your ordinary meatballs. I recently had sinus surgery at Northwestern so I sent my mom and husband over to Cicchetti for lunch while they waited for me. I made sure they ordered Nonna's Meatballs and they both agreed that these were one of their favorites! Next up we went with our server's recommendation of the Charred Baby Squid with Squid Ink, Black Garlic, and Creamy Polenta. This dish was straight up outstanding! My friend and I both agreed that it was an incredibly unique dish - but unique in a very good way. The squid is actually black from the squid ink, we didn't really get much of a charred taste, but that was totally fine by us! Mixed with the creamy polenta and black garlic and a bright note of cilantro on top, it was very delicious and my favorite of the night. After the squid we went with an order of the Bruschette and the Braised Short Rib Ravioli. We ordered one of each of Bruschette: Duck Liver with cocoa nibs, Pork Belly with fennel and golden raisin agrodolce, and Tuna Conserva with pickled shallot and parsley. We split each piece in half so we were both able to try a bite of each and the pork belly was the winner for me. The Short Rib Ravioli is just as good as you might imagine-extremely tasty and definitely a dish that's on the heartier side! We finished off our meal with Cicchetti's house-made Limoncello and an order of the Reverse Affogato. The limoncello packs quite the punch so make sure to sip slowly! The sugary doughnuts and bold coffee gelato of the reverse affogato made for the perfect ending to an already notable meal. Everything we tried here at Cicchetti was wonderful and I can't wait to return to explore more of this fantastic menu. Word on the street is that the Pork Cracklins and the Aged Hanger Steak Carpaccio are must-orders, so I definitely need to get back soon to give those a try!",0.998,0.816,0.181,0.003,0.5316132167152575

Can't fault it at all. - The Gnocchi with Braised Pork Shank: Aside from having a very bland appearance (all white, no color), the texture and flavor were excellent. The bad: - The chairs: I was thinking the whole time i was sitting there that the chairs reminded me of white outdoor patio chairs. As we were leaving, my friend said ""Those chairs were weird. Did they remind you of patio chairs?"" -The service: I've read the service can go either way. Unfortunately it was the wrong way for us.  -There were two of us dining. We were seated and 4 menus were literally splattered across the table by the hostess.  - We sat for 10+ minutes before our waitress came by. The busboy even came by at one point to ask if our waitress had come by. By the time she stopped by, we had already decided on every dish we wanted, so her explanation of the menu was useless at that point. - We ordered three courses, but after the waitress took our order, she didn't come by to check how our meal was until after the final course was delivered (maybe an hour later?). This also meant we couldn't order more wine. - When she came by after the third course, my friend ordered a glass of wine which was never brought by (and thankfully didn't show up on the bill) - She grossly over-estimated portion size. She said that the two courses we ordered were plenty of food for two people but we were still pretty hungry afterward. The pasta was definitely an appetizer size. The seafood stew is small for an Italian seafood stew but good, in general, for a single person. -After still being hungry, we ordered a flatbread with mushroom and onion. This was the most onion-y tasting thing ever. It was covered in what I think was sliced scallion, some crispy onion pieces and several small onions (the size of pearl onions). I didn't really see or taste any mushroom. After the second slice, my friend stopped eating it. I took off both the ""pearl"" onions and the scallions then ate it only because I was still so hungry after the other smaller dishes At this point, I don't think I'll be back.",0.9852,0.858,0.104,0.038,0.492052767052767

To begin, it's not where you would typically think a place like this would be.

The design inside is an adorable rustic chic look to it, with an amazingly welcoming staff. The service was beyond excellent, and the food surpassed. My table ordered drinks-all were great, the mushroom flat bread and all of the pasta dishes. The flatbread was so delicious i wish I had more. Each pasta was decadent and mouthwateringly good in their own right. I've had saffron risotto before, but this melted in your mouth. The lamb in the squid ink orecchiette was something I will crave over and over again now, the pork shank and combo with pear and celery root was so fantastic. The braised short rib (my dish) was great! I would recommend all to any who go. The highlight of our meal was the dessert. I actually have no words but melt in your mouth, crumbly, crunchy, creamy goodness that is the Reverse Affagato. This masterpiece was a raving success at our table.

Upon entering the first thing you notice are the high ceilings and lit bar. The loft style design and wood pillars make for quite a lot of character in the middle of sterile hospital streeterville.  First thing we wanted to try was Nonna's meatballs. It came out super quickly and was garnished with cheese and a side of bread. The meatball itself was very well seasoned however with the sauce it was so over salted!! So salty to the point where we drank two glasses of water each to bear the sodium. We were too hungry but now thinking back it's a dish I would have returned rather than get hypertension over.  Next we ordered the pork shank gnocchi and it was very unique and delicious with apple and celery slides within. The white sauce is unexpected and goes well with the gnocchi pasta and pieces of pork. The pasta texture was perfect and I would enjoy this dish again.  Next came the seafood pot and as the waitress said it does come with a little kick. Overall the flavor is just ok and there are decent sized pieces of lobster, octopus and mussels. The crispy rice was also interesting texture in this dish. Order again? No it was also very over salted (sauce) and made it difficult to finish.  What saved this review from a 3?, the affogado donut dessert. Gosh this was very delicious. Donuts have great chewy texture and dipped in the coffee ice cream made it even more delectable.

2014-03-04,2.0,"Wow, I was really underwhelmed by this place :(  After hearing so many great things about this restaurant, I brought a friend who was visiting from out of town. Of everything we ordered, I only really enjoyed ""Nonna's Meatballs""- this appetizer and the decor of the restaurant are what gives it 2 stars. Here are the other items that I ordered: Bruschette Assortite (1 duck liver + cocoa nibs, 1 porkbelly, fennel, golden raisin agrodolce, and 1 tuna conserva, pickled shallot, parsley) - of the three, the best was probably the tuna, as the shallot & parsley were very light and complemented the taste of the fish. However, I was so disappointed by the bitter-tasting duck liver - and don't get me wrong, foie gras is one of my FAVORITE foods in the world (I pretty much order it at every restaurant that offers it), but this was just ... bad. Squid Ink Orecchiette with Lamb Soppressata, brussel sprouts - the waiter should probably warn the diner that this dish is EXTREMELY SPICY, as it is covered completely in red chili flakes (an ingredient that should probably be listed on the menu...). The orecchiette was so hard and tough to chew, and the brussel sprouts weren't even cooked... it was just a humongous jumble of hard/soft/crunchy texture and weird flavors, and I actually felt sick eating it. I took the rest home (and later threw it away) because the waiter kind of made me feel bad about not finishing the last bite of the foie gras bruschette. I can't comment on my friend's dishes (the prosciutto salad and the braised pork shank gnocchi), but personally, I really did not enjoy the dishes I ordered, and this was the first restaurant in which I didn't completely finish everything on my plate even when I didn't love it.",-0.9615,0.833,0.058,0.11,0.5808963585434173

So far so good. The ambiance of the restaurant was very cool, it has a cool vibe and look to it, not too over the top it was cool. The food was 5 stars. Everything we had was great, some I liked more than others, but that's just my personal taste. Some items that stuck out.. Shaved Root Salad - Excellent, so much flavor for a salad! Fantina Flatbread - SO GOOD! I Could eat 5 of these... Gnocchi - Great Seafood Stew - Not as much flavor as the other dishes, but still great. also it's a big portion. For dessert we got the Reverse Affogato and I mixed up the gelato flavors and sorbet, which was a very wise decision as I wasn't feeling 3 flavors for each of those categories, so I'm glad they let you mix and match. The hemingway cocktail was also very good, but at $14 a pop it's hard to keep going...  The only issue we had all night was that they never cleared our plates, we used the same plates for every single dish, and after the meatballs our plates were very messy, so mixing the meatball sauce with salad wasn't too fun... Also I wish they had spaced out the dishes a bit more, our table was very small for the 4 of us, and having more then 3 entrees out on the table was overkill for the space, especially when we all had drinks. I understand they bring it from the kitchen to the table as soon as it's finished, but can't they just wait a little bit to cook a dish after we have like 3 of them on our table? At one point I think we had 7 dishes on our table, it was a little crazy, and we had to shove all the food on our plates so they could clear the larger plates. I'll definitely be back, they have a nice setup for their bar area which looks like they accept walk-ins and I live near by so this is probably the best nice spot for food in Streeterville right now.",0.9976,0.763,0.206,0.032,0.5881304112554112

Came here with another person and we ordered: - Bruschette assortite (duck liver, porkbelly, and tuna conserva) - $8: I liked the porkbelly and tuna, while the duck liver was a bit too metallic for my taste. A bit pricey considering each piece can be eaten in 2 bites, but it was a good way to sample different flavors. 3.5 stars - Charred baby squid (squid ink, black garlic, polenta)- $14: I really like seafood, and the squid itself was really soft and tender. There wasn't as much flavor as I had expected - after a few bites, the flavors were rather muddled. Decent portion size, especially compared to the bruschette. 3.5 stars - Venetian Seafood stew - $34: Although pricey, there was a good variety of seafood and great flavor. I got to sample prawns, lobster, mussel, and octopus. My biggest complaint about this dish was the ciabatta loaf. It was SO hard that I could barely break it apart and it hurt to bite into it... like what is going on?? 4 stars - Dessert was a reverse affogato: typically, an affogato consists of pouring coffee over vanilla ice cream, but the ""reverse"" part of the name alluded to the fact that there was vanilla/cream poured over coffee ice cream. It came with a side of donuts to dip. Awesome dessert! Really great flavor, and the donuts complemented the ice cream/vanilla flavors really well.

With all the mumbo jumbo, decided on your classic tomato and mozzarella. It was simply outstanding. The red sauce was delicious. Cheese fresh and plentiful. Zero complaints. Wanted another! Main course, went with the gnocchi. The dumplings were perfect. The sauce it comes with is adventurous. If you like gnocchi, this may not be the dish you were expecting. It tastes a little like ...if you subbed the gnocchi for chicken, you'd have the best chicken salad sandwich (sans the bread) of your life. Heavy on the dill. Very creamy (pureed celery root?) white sauce. A little bit of a mind-eff, but I was down with it. Regrets? Not trying the squid ink pasta, the tiramisu sundae, or ordering a 2nd glass of wine.

My dad and I each did a glass of the Nerello.  It was light bodied like a Pinot with a smooth finish.  Perfect start to our dinner.  We started with the mushroom pizza.  It was sooo good!  It's loaded with roasted mushrooms, scallions and chili flakes.  Will make your breath stink but it's worth it!  Next, we had Nonna's Meatballs.  There were about 12-13 bite size meatballs soaked in a delicious tomato sauce.  I'm not a fan of Pancetta or anything like bacon, but it was a nice touch. Next we had the short rib ravioli.  At first glance, we thought 2 per person wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect.  Each ravioli was loaded with short rib and the sauce was nice and light.  Our last entree was the Brick Chicken.  I wish I could make chicken this good.  As I went to pick a piece, the chicken broke apart.  That's how perfect cooked it was, and married well with the beans, sun-dried tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Lastly, we had to try the donuts that everyone around us had ordered.  So good!  instead of the coffee ice cream, I would've prefered hot fudge to dip the donuts in, but it was still a perfect ending to our wonderful meal. Although we had to wait a bit after having a reservation, I would come back.  This is a nice addition to the neighborhood!",0.9961,0.759,0.209,0.032,0.5482578397212544

2014-02-16,4.0,"We came to celebrate 2 birthdays. With a group of 6 adults and 1 kid, we decided to share everything and ended up getting about 13-14 things. So it averaged out to be 2 dishes per person. Here's the quick sum up: Good:  - Pork Cracklins (fun, salty, light, easy to munch on - def a good start) - Meatball: smaller size meatballs packed with flavor in a freshly-made tomato sauce. The size of these meatballs will definitely make you come back for more.  - The pasta e risotto section: (we ordered all the 5 dishes on this section of the menu - asides from the safron risotto which needs a little more flavor and texture, the rest are good. Gnocchi could have used a little more salt, and the Squid Ink Orrecchitte had some fried scallions that were a little too burnt. But they were all good and safe options.  - Flat bread - mushroom flat bread with green onion was delicious.  - Olive with focaccia & spread - olives were good, the kumquat marmalade was delicious as well as the butter.  - Shaved root veggie salad: the Parmesan dressing were creamy yet light - this was perhaps my favorite of the night.  So-so: - Baby squid - I thought this dish did not have any texture at all, the squid was a little too soft (I prefer mine with a bite), and the polenta didn't help.  - Tomato flat bread - the cheese was dried up and the bread was hard - not so great. - Sunchokes and baby artichoke: this was alright, the dressing was overpowering the dish.  - Duck trio: duck had a little too much fat and I prefer my duck a little more cooked but this was rather chewy. - NY Hanger Steak: the steak had some gristle in it - and we had to threw out some pieces.  - Bruchetta: duck liver was good, but pork belly were very dried and had no flavor.  - Tomato & basil flat bread: this was actually terrible - the mozzarella cheese was dried, no flavor. Skip this dish.  Service was good although it seemed like at times there were some confusion. Our food came out whenever it was ready, which was fine because we were sharing everything, but it seemed like they didn't plan for the food to come out. Our server was very nice and the owner was there saying hello to our party. They offered lemoncello shots at the end and they also brought out free deserts for the birthday boys.

The space on the whole was nice, with the very odd exception of the TV in the dinning area. Really? This is supposed to be a nice restaurant, not a sports bar. The service was just perfunctory and so-so. Appetizers, for example, came out before drinks were delivered and dessert took forever. The waiter was sort of absent for long stretches and just seemed like he had no desire to be there. As for the food, we shared a flatbread to start, which was very good. For the mains, one of us got the duck, which was perfectly cooked and quite good. High marks on that entree. The gnocchi and ravioli both came out lukewarm. The ravioli tasted ok, but were oddly dry, as if it had been sitting out for a while. It could have been really good but it wasn't. The gnocchi was dull and lacked seasoning.  The desserts (cannoli and reverse affogato) were a highlight. The complementary limoncello was also nice. All in all, I was expecting better. A friend went the night before and raved about his meal.

The space isn't quite right or the food isn't up to snuff. Cicchetti thought offers a great place to chat a bit over some delicious food. Sure the prices are a bit high but so is everything in this area so it is what it is. We started out with the potato focaccia on the recommendation of our server. Apparently it comes from a 150 year old started. Wherever it comes from, it's delicious. A nice little sprinkling of salt on the top really helps it out as well. Loved the European butter it came with was less excited about the kumquat marmalade. For my main dish I had the vegetarian entree which was an eggplant served over cauliflower gratin with roasted brussel sprout leaves. The dish was inventive and flavorful. I usually think of gratins as casserole type dishes but this one was akin to a puree.

I was presented with the restaurant week lunch hour menu. I chose the only app on the restaurant week menu (pork cracklings), prosciutto/sweet potato/arugula salad for second, and pork sandwich with egg on top for the main course.  The cracklings were ""eh"". Pretty ordinary, simple, but still seasoned well. I wouldn't order these on a regular, non-restaurant week lunch; just not worth the $. The prosciutto salad was good! I only wish it was bigger. I scarfed it down in two bites, literally. I am aware that restaurant week menu items at this location are ""slightly smaller"" than their normal offerings, but wow...that was small! :(  The sandwich was surprisingly tasty! I had read other reviews regarding this particular pork sandwich saying that it wasn't seasoned enough and tasted bland so I took a precaution and asked for salt and pepper before my sandwich came out. I didn't need it! I tasted onion and pepper bits. Maybe after reading those reviews, the chef changed the recipe or maybe the other person who previously posted about this caught the chef on an ""off day"", I don't know. But I was very content with this. Also, the chips were crispy and were definitely homemade! Yum :) My coworkers ordered some doughnut looking dessert that came with coffee ice cream.

That's about all the good I can say though.  The place is still working out kinks in the kitchen obviously because I can't say I've had worse service in quite a while. You would think with the restaurant week menu they would be getting food out of the kitchen quickly as most people are ordering the same thing. We sat for no less than 15-20 minutes between courses and the dinner turned into an almost 2 and a half hour affair. Also, they brought out the wrong entrees for us after we sat and waitied for our third course for an obnoxious amount of time and the dessert took just as long even though it was a tiny sliver of cheesecake and I made it clear that my parking meter would expire soon.  The food was DECENT but not what id expect from an apprentice of blackbird and the chef of trenchermen. The tables around us were going through the same thing as I saw.

They eventually made small gestures to alter the ambiance. They messed up our orders, brought out bread after the food arrived, threw away our special champagne bottle without asking, and seemed limited in their flexibility to accommodate vegan and vegetarian options.

2014-01-27,3.0,"I too came here for Restaurant Week's lunch menu.  The review from Janice A. was pretty spot on, but I have a few takes on things. I'll just talk about the food itself, although I will start off by saying, my water tasted a little funny.  The service was great and they were very good about remedying this, however, it might have just been me because even my second glass was a little funny.  Started out with the pork cracklings, which were tasty.  Flavor was excellent and I found myself eating em like they were the air I breathe.  Very effortlessly and addicting.  Not sure if I would pay 7 dollars for it, but it was good. Then I had the meatballs.  Very tasty and well done also.  Sauce was fantastic, and the ciabatta they give you is great to scoop the remainder sauce with.  First two dishes were off to a good, solid start. Then came the 3rd entree.  When looking at the restaurant week menu, its hard not to order the braised pork panini.  The other options were salads, a tofu panini, or an egg dish.  So how do you not order, what sounds to be the most substantial, the pork panini with a fried egg?  The problem with the panini was it was very heavy and rich, but I got no flavor or seasoning in it.  Theres a giardiniera in it, but even that you can't taste much.  The pork was cooked well, the bread was delicious, but that was it.  It just felt like you were eating texture, which was very rich because of the pork and egg.  I didn't mind the potato chips (thought they were decent actually), but the panini itself was lackluster to say the least.   I ended with a scoop of grapefruit sorbet.  For me, when you order a citrus sorbet, it has to have the right balance of sweet and sour, while being overall very refreshing.  I think it swayed a lil too far on the sour side, and not enough sweetness.  it had a cookie crumble on it too, which was ok, but I think should be saved for the gelatos and not the sorbets. I understand its restaurant week, so they are not going to offer the best the restaurant has to offer, however being a new restaurant, it should offer a good representation.  I also think because it is so new, they are still going to work on the dishes to see what works and what doesn't.  I am torn because I believe what I tasted has me very intrigued to go back and try other things, however, that third panini dish has me very cautious about what to order.  Based on the first two dishes, the service, and the comfortable and clean atmosphere, I am definitely willing to give it another try and hopefully update this review.",0.9988,0.752,0.221,0.028,0.5153527185602658
2014-01-26,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went to Cicchetti for lunch during Restaurant Week. I came with fairly high expectations after reading about Chef Sheerin's history, and even then, I was still quite surprised by the quality of the food.  I'm big into design, and I was every excited to view the interior of the restaurant. The place looks great--minimalist, but homey. I also love how open and bright the interior feels. The space feels smart, but simple; it feels elegant, but not pretentious. The same can be said of the presentations for the food. To the food: My boyfriend is a picky eater and isn't really into trying anything that's not extremely safe. The thought of eating parmesan-covered pork cracklins, which we got as our appetizer, actually freaked him out a bit. However, we both ended up really enjoying them. The rosemary gave them an awesome complexity, which isn't something I would usually expect from...well... pork cracklins. For the second course, I had the bruschette assortite. The duck liver was quite good, the tuna was great, and the pork belly was outstanding. My boyfriend and I also really liked the meatballs, and by ""really liked,"" I mean my boyfriend really LOVED them. The bruschette dish was refreshing and tasty, and the meatballs were rich and delicious. For the final course, we both ordered the braised pork shoulder and provolone panino. Overall, the dish was pretty disappointing. While the braised pork shoulder was good, the egg didn't add much to the panino. That was ok. The strangest and most unfortunate part of the course was the chips that came on the side that were completely lacking in either salt or spices. Though it makes me sad to say something so acerbic about any aspect the food at this great restaurant, I have to just be honest: eating the chips felt a little like taking bites out of crisp sheets of sawdust. However, the dessert more than made up for it. I asked for the cannoli to share between the two of us, and it was wonderful. My boyfriend (more the lover of comfort food) liked it, and I (the one who seeks out the crazier foods) appreciated that it still had a great combination of texture and surprising flavors to make it a memorable dessert. Finally, despite my disappointment with the third course, I still refuse to detract a star from my rating. The place and the food were aesthetically enjoyable, almost everything I had was unique and delicious, and the service was excellent. The servers were very pleasant, and the lady at the front desk handling the reservations was especially great, and really helped boost our experience by just being kind and sweet both as we were entering and exiting this great restaurant. For all these reasons, I highly recommend Cicchetti, and I am so happy to add it to my list of favorite Chicago restaurants.",0.9995,0.665,0.298,0.037,0.6527083333333333

Such simple flavors but really does amazing things when you eat it. The bread and spreads were a suggestion from the server. Bread was so good! giardiniera was odd to me-maybe better for summer? Bruschette was delish, Liver was yummy, added the apricot jam to it for a few bites :) pork belly was good, but I really liked the tuna which is the one I didn't think id like. Weird combo (mustard seed? And parsley) but tasted so light and fresh. I had the gelato that was super rich and had a little salty sweet thing going on.

And I don't know why they thought a red sauce would compliment the raw fish.  We next had the charred baby squid.  If the squid was charred you couldn't tell because it was drowning in squid ink.  Again, very little squid, a lot of polenta, a mushy mess.  We had the sun choke and artichoke insalate and it was sauced with balsamic caramel which made it strangely sweet.  Finally the squid ink orchiette with lamb soppressata was a thick unpleasant jumble of flavors.  There are so many Italian restaurants in River North with much better food (and I don't just mean Eataly - although their food is quite high quality).  Maybe the chef is still trying to get his legs under him.  I would give the food one star, the service is okay, the design of the restaurant is its best feature.",0.7906,0.831,0.101,0.068,0.5319519230769231
2014-01-12,5.0,"Tucked away in the shadow of Northwestern Hospital and only a block off the Mag Mile, Cicchetti blew me away the other night with the high level of food and service! The name Cicchetti means ""small dishes or side dishes"" typically served in the little bars that you find in Venice, Italy.  Chef Michael Sheerin (Blackbird) has opened this new restaurant that features fresh, local ingredients served in the first ""green seal"" approved restaurant in the city.   The restaurant decor features reclaimed wood from a barn in Wisconsin which is a lovely contrast interspersed with the marble counter on the bar and the light colored seats and tables.  Don't be put off my the menus cut up to act as your drink coasters . . . it's just another attempt to be green (although until the bartender told me this- I thought they were out of cocktail napkins! Ha!)  And you should have seen the look on my friend's face when he asked for a cocktail napkin to wipe his hands and was told there weren't any . . .but he was accommodated with a full size cloth napkin. We were warmly greeted as we walked in by Joshua, bartender extraordinaire, who was a good with a drink (he  makes a mean martini!) as he was with his passion for what he was doing and in wanting to share that with us .  It was like having a drink with an old friend, so much so, that we ended up having our nightcap at his bar as well. We were seated by the front windows and began to look over the menu.  ""The menu is share able"", explained our highly competent and friendly server, Sean offering up several of his favorites for us to consider.  There were so many things that we wanted to try- I certainly will need to return as we only scratched the surface of this wonderful menu. We started with the focaccia bread that came with kumquat jam, olives and giardienera to spread on it.  Delicious!  And Sean said that it came from 150 year old starter . . . . which whether true or not . .you gotta love a bread with a past! Next up- ""Nonnas"" meatballs served with pancetta sauce . . . .these were amazing!!  As was the grilled black ink squid served with garlic and polenta.   A wonderful dish!  And since my friend is a bit of a risotto connoisseur,  we also devoured the saffron risotto which he claimed was one of the best he had tasted! And finally- for our entree- we split the seafood stew which was a wonderful combination of prawns, lobster, mussels and octopus served in a wonderful pepper tomato sauce served with couscous and rice.  A hearty dish for a cold Winter's evening!  Molto Buona! After all that food- there was barely room for dessert but somehow we squeezed in a taste of a creamy, cherry gelato that was nestled on a shortbread crunch and served with a shortbread cookie.  A perfect ending! But we weren't done yet as they give everyone a complimentary serving of their in house made limoncello . . one of my favs!  It was a nice touch that said they appreciated our business.  There were so many other things that I also wanted to try like the duck three ways, the chicken, more of the amazing pasta dishes as well as the sardines.  Sardines you say?  Not my usual go to food but everyone who works here sings their praises so I just have to check them out on my next visit. If you drive- there is valet parking located just south of the restaurant at the Hyatt on Erie for $14 for three hours.  Be sure to have your ticket validated by the hostess to get that rate. Grazie, Cicchetti!  I had wonderful dining experience that just made my night . . . .and isn't that what eating out is all about?",0.9993,0.792,0.196,0.011,0.5669767187177901

I only wish we had room to try one of the delicious-sounding desserts.  The complimentary limoncello at the end of the meal was a nice touch.  Come summertime they will have a large patio, but we won't be able to wait that long to return!",0.9926,0.697,0.291,0.012,0.7365620490620493
2013-12-31,5.0,"An excellent addition to the Chicago culinary scene. The food is simply amazing. I deliberately ordered the risotto as many restaurants attempt risotto and fail. Cicchetti delivers on all fronts. Flavor, innovation and presentation. But let us back up to the appetizer; bruschetti was excellent with my only regret that I tried all 3 as part of experimentation. A world with only duck liver bruschetti would be most magical. Despite the technology employed by the pastry chef such as the liquid nitrogen, the cocktail menu is fairly mundane. Well executed but not innovative like the rest of the offer. I hope that this will improve with time as the bar staff has been recruited from the best places in the region and could do more than the traditional Prohibition-era cocktails. That said, every meal ends with homemade limoncello and it brings everything back together for an amazing finishing touch.",0.9649,0.77,0.171,0.058,0.5956140350877194

2013-12-29,5.0,"Dang, this is the kind of place that makes me want to go and redact stars from previous reviews of restaurants with similar concepts. This place deserves 5 stars more than other places I've given 5 stars - I'll leave it at that.  Service/atmosphere - Amazing. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive (though I can't discount the fact that this may have been because almost no one else was here on a Sunday night; where are you, Yelpers?!). The space is huge and super cozy; just ""fancy"" enough without feeling uptight. No white tablecloths here. There's a bar area at the front with high tables and TVs, and a huge, more elegant dining area with a kitchen view further back. Food - Beyond amazing. Every single thing we ordered would blow any other Chicago Italian restaurant out of the water. Favorites at our table were the oysters (and the condiments that come with them!), the perfectly-spicy charred squid with creamy polenta, the lovely house-cured sardines with rye crispbread, and the hearty seafood stew. I don't know if I'm just not used to getting warm olives, but they were also shockingly good, and paired well with lovely warm focaccia and a soft salted butter.  Drinks - Fantastic. Yes - they are up there in price next to Violet Hour and other speciality cocktail bars, but they're worth that. Anything with an egg white is done right, and even the more boring (...""classic""?) sounding cocktails were flawlessly executed - nothing ever too sweet or foofy.  Plus they have an great wine menu as well a surprisingly thoughtful beer menu for an Italian place. And they gave us a complimentary bottle of house-made limoncello after our meal - um, way better than Andes mints.  With so many bad Italian-American restaurants near the Mag Mile and so many people who seem to love these upscale-Olive Gardens, I'm crossing my fingers that Cicchetti will be able attract customers. Come on, Chicago - please show America that you have some taste.",0.9965,0.727,0.228,0.046,0.5283333333333333

It's in a great location that's close to a lot of residential buildings in streeterville! Service was great!! Everyone was so amiable and willing to answer questions. For dessert, I ordered one scoop of tiramisu gelati and they accidentally gave me a full portion instead! They apologized and told me it was on the house! :) overall the food was great! The chef really knows how to mesh flavors together! Some dishes were a little on the salty side, but I'm sure that's easily fixable. All in all. Love this place. The food. The service. The atmosphere. The decor. Will definitely be returning! Shout out to our awesome waiter, Jeff!",0.9881,0.728,0.249,0.023,0.6827485380116959
