2015-07-30,3.0,"First of all, this place would deserve 3 1/2 stars; since Yelp does not enable fractions yet and it falls short of my 4 star ideal, I'd give it 3. Here is why. The food was fair, though on the pricey side, and the decor is quaint and inviting. Good spot for date night and overall average fare and service. We had the charcuterie plate as a starter: it had its highlights (the prosciutto, uber-tasty) and its low points (the terrine, too dry); overall, not bad, but not spectacular either. We also got the escargots: classically prepared, did not disappoint. Our mains were lamb shank and bouillabaisse. The shank was quite large and tasty, though a tiny bit too greasy for me. The side dishes with the shank lacked a bit of fantasy, though: I took for steamed vegetables! The bouillabaisse, on the other hand, was so-so: though the fish variety was remarkable, the broth tasted like the chicken broth I buy in Costco. No herbs to be noticed, and the whole things seemed assembled on my plate without much thought.  I would say the food here is good, but very un-exciting. Perhaps they strive to adhere to some classic French standard I did not appreciate enough or perhaps it's just a bit boring. As for me, I want to be impressed when I go out for dinner. At least a little bit. Cyrano's cute, but no more than that.",0.9786,0.796,0.155,0.05,0.48656994047619045
2015-07-06,3.0,"I have been meaning to dine here for years, but for some reason haven't. I had an old friend coming to town, so I used that as an excuse to go. Overall, I'm glad I did. I got there early and had a by far the coldest martini I've ever gotten in Chicago (points from me!) at their rather snug bar and perused their rather impressive wine list (a white Côtes du Rhône by the glass?). When my friend arrived, she ordered one of their specialty cocktails - which she loved and we caught up a little bit.  When we were seated, we were the only ones there, which made me a little nervous. We ordered the Duck Rillettes, which came with toast points, cornichons and a capered slaw. Wow! I was transported right back to France with these lovely, delicate flavors! Rillettes aren't exactly ""heart-friendly,"" but they are delicious, and Chef Didier has quite a selection to choose from! My friend ordered the mussels and frîtes - which looked and smelled wonderful. She obviously loved them as they were gone in moments! I ordered the poached salmon with goose fat garlic crushed potatoes and brussels sprout leaves. It was most definitely red wine poached and a little undercooked to my liking, though a rather beautiful dish. The potatoes were a bit bland and just tasted a little boiled - none of the goose fat came through to me - and there were just enough brussels sprouts to tease you... I would have liked more. The salmon itself wasn't bad (I finished most of it), but the red wine poach became a little overwhelming. It hit one note nicely, but stayed there. *Side note: If you go to the men's room and feel like you're being watched... you are! The stuffed deer head mounted on the wall is just a ""tad"" creepy! If you're in the mood for Country French, this is definitely a solid option for you. I wouldn't call it haute cuisine, but it is elevated. Next time I will likely pass on the salmon, but I will be back, especially for the rillettes - I think I have to try every one of them!",0.9982,0.752,0.227,0.021,0.5587662337662338

2015-03-21,5.0,"From top to bottom, a flawless real French evening. If you've only eaten French food in the States or Paris, you won't get it. This is true French country food like you would find in Lyon, food capital. The cheeses are phenomenal, and go ahead and splurge the 3 bucks for French bread and the tomato butter, it's worth it. My husband ordered the steak frites - to this day we cannot figure out how they got the meat to be so tender. The spring asparagus soup was out of this world, as were the escargots.  True French without gallons of oil and melted cheese, like you get at other places. Take your time with dinner, so you can enjoy dessert. The chef makes his own truffles, which will change your life, and if you can get the seasonal creme brulee,  do. We had squash creme, and it was just as fragrant as you would imagine. Our waiter was so pleasant, so was the busboy,  the jazz musicians downstairs changed our view of jazz (for the better), people got up to dance, chef came out and sang us a song called ""coq au vin,"" and we closed out the place.

2015-03-01,5.0,"TLDR; Thoroughly delightful evening. We ate on a Saturday evening with a reservation, and had a choice of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Neither was packed.  Downstairs was the right choice -- live blues/jazz standards with a vocalist and guitarist, loud enough to permeate the room but not so much as to impede conversation.  The atmosphere and decor was inviting, warm, and ex-pat French (but no Le Mans cars or Bardot pinups in the men's room, sigh). Despite what you might have read here, service was *impeccable* -- friendly, attentive, timely and thoughtful.  We ordered in stages (wine, two stages of appetizers, entrees, coffee, desert), and never had any lag in either our order being taken, or in the plates showing up ... nor did we ever feel rushed.  Mssr. Durand was present on and off in the room throughout the evening, and stopped by our table to greet us. The wine card was a bit short, but very well priced, and with enough choice to make up the difference.  We had a nice sancerre rouge / pinot noir. Each of the plates was delicious in a straightforward way -- nothing surprising or ""ooh, wow!"", but also not a single wrong step.  Portions were moderate (by American standards), so don't worry about over-ordering.  We finished dinner feeling that we'd left 3/4 of the menu unexplored, and wanted to come back to explore the rest. We had: - Fois Gras:  conventional preparation (rich, well-cooked) and moderate portion -- not knock-your-socks-off, but quite tasty. - Beet salad:  terrific mix of beets, well-oiled greens, pears and blue cheese. - Peking Duck Pate:  I should note that they have a *great* selection of pates, and I think that you could probably plan to spend evenings working through the options.  The Peking duck was good (although hard to tell the difference between this and a regular duck liver pate, other than the bok choy-style cole slaw side). - Duo of Duck:  a confit and a breast -- both were *awesome*, perfectly cooked and succulent. - Cassoulet:  a little odd (thin, maybe?), but a very savory selection of sausages and meat, with the most tasty chicken I've ever had (had to call the waitress over to ask her what it was, as it tasted just too darn gamey-good to be chicken). - Cheese platter:  a nice (if comparatively pricey) selection of four cheeses, each of which was nice, but where the clear winner was the marinated chevre; - Creme Brulee:  two preparations, one with blackberries and one with ... well, I was paying too much attention to the cheese to notice. Along with the desert, we had a very nice Calvados and Armagnac -- light pours, but good brandies. We look forward to returning ...",0.9976,0.804,0.173,0.023,0.5662087912087913
2015-02-15,4.0,"This place was AMAZING, but why did I miss a star. That is because we arrived at 930pm fhe time of our reservation. We were seated right away which was nice. The restaurant has this amazing rustic feeling and it makes you feel like you are in France. At 1015pm the server (Bridgette) stopped by and said she would be right with us and would get us some water. Mind you it was 45 minutes later. Which it was ok as we were enjoying the lovely music that was being played. We decided to do the Valentine's pre fix menu in the Barrell Room, which included appetizers, soup, entree, and then a sample of desserts. Well at 1030pm, here comes a bus boy with our soups. Well we both thought what happened to our appetizers. We asked the bus boy to please take the soups back and to call our server (Bridgette), we told him nicely and he said ok hold on one second. Well finally (Bridgette) decides to come to our table and takes our drink order, no appologies or anything. We felt like she didnt care to provide any service to us. Finally at 1055pm we get our appetizers and we were so hungry we devoured them but they tasted so good and fresh totally worth it. Other servers saw how we were a bit annoyed by the service from (Bridgette) that another server (Mando) came by and appologized about the bad service we had received so far. We told him it was Valentine's day and we were just trying to enjoy the night and the delicious food. He said he would take over as our server and offered us a complimentary glass of champagne, which was a nice gesture. He was SO MUCH BETTER THAN (Bridgette). Mando went WAY above and BEYOND. HE should teach Bridgette some server tips. After him taking over everything went smooth and the food was delicious. NO complaints there at all. We will definitely come back and we will make sure we do not get placed under Bridgette's care because then we would have to walk out. (Yes it was that bad) MANDO THANKS AGAIN FOR MAKING OUR 1ST VISIT ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES EVER. BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID, WE WILL RETURN SOONER THAN LATER.

We had to wait for the rest of our party at the cute little bar and the bartender was great. The wine I usually drink was not on the menu so he offered me 2 choices to taste. He found me a perfect one.  My friend was thrilled with his version of a cosmo. Got seated as soon as the entire party was there. We all choose to do a menu special to benefit Ovarian Cancer. What a deal for a 4 course meal and they donate a portion to OCSA.  The mussels were wonderful in a tasty sauce that was perfect with the baguette. The baguette also came with a homemade butter and mustard. All i can say is WOW!! The owner/chef came out to great the diners which is such a nice touch. Making sure that what we had so far was to our liking and asking what we decided on for dinner. What I loved is he made a suggestion to us that I went with and it was perfect.  The main meal , everyone's ,was to perfection. The duck was tender,juicy and so full of flavor. There is a small Cabaret in the basement and the waiter offered us to have our desert down there. We were so glad we did. An adorable cozy room with a trio playing. The piano player named YoKo was a riot. She made sure to greet every table. Looks like she has a following but if she didn't know you she made you feel like you were friends forever. The desert was divine!!! The staff down in the cabaret were friendly and attentive. The band was so entertaining. People were up dancing and everyone was so relaxed and enjoying themselves. We had the best time and a perfect ending to a wonderful experience.

We had a couple of martinis, perfectly shaken, up front and then were led to our seat.  To start with- try the cheeses of the day and the chacuterie plate.  Very good! But be sure to ask for additional bread as you will definitely run out.   Also noteworthy to start with are the French fries with 4 dipping sauces and the warm baguette with butter and mustard. I had the steak which was quite good and others in our group had the coq au vin which was also quite tasty.  The wine list has several good selections by the glass and the server was good at making sure our glasses were always full.

After sending an email to the restaurant with the disappointment of the suppose the deal, I also questioned how they got to the amount of $144. They were actually unsure. He also was rude in the email response, asking if I was not provided with a good meal and good music. My whole email was just a response to the fact that nothing in the three course dinner that's a deal included would have added up to $144 value. He continued to tell me how much he makes off of the deal being sold, and acting as if that is what I paid. After two emails explaining to him that I did not pay 70% of the deal, I was just fed up. He did not seem to understand, and although he may be an excellent chef - he is not a very good businessman. I spent $65 and we only received $69 dollars worth of food.

Drinks: ordered the bellini and the French Kiss: both were just passable.  Food: Excellent. We ordered a few extra items, the french bread with whipped butter and mustard, the beet salad. The charcuterie plate (shared by 2) was excellent. I was stuffed I could not eat  my main course.The bistro steak and the duck breast were also fabulous.  Ambience: we sat inside. It is fine if you are into the country look. The music was very loud and it reminded me of Edith Pfaff. They had seats outside which were not offered as an option  to us. THe music there was much better.  Server: Good: Very attentive.  Bad: I asked her what the meats served on the charcuterie plate were and she couldn't name anyone of them and told us they were all sausages. (Really!). She didn't even offer to find out for us. At the end of the meal, she brought us 2 checks (one with the real price of the food we ate, and one with just the extra items we ordered). We knew we had to tip based on the actual price of the meal and not on the coupon value and we had no intention of cheating anyone out of their tip. I had already done my research to figure out what I was going to be eating and what the cost of the items would be. The coupon also stated that the meal was approximately 50% discounted. Anyway she brings us the meal which she says actually costs approximately 50 bucks for each entree. Actually doubled the cost of both entrees.

2013-10-20,2.0,"Went to Cyrano's Farm Kitchen last night with my husband for a late dinner after a movie.  The place has been remodeled since the last time we were there a few years ago. The decor matches the new ""farm kitchen"" name but I personally do not appreciate  the rustic farm motif. The prices are high, typical of most french restaurants, and I just don't think a farm theme matches. When I think of a farm kitchen, I think of someone's mother in the kitchen of a diner making very simple delicious dishes. This restaurant's menu and prices just don't match. Overall the food was decent. We got a beef crepe as our appetizer and it was just ok. My husband got the steak and frites and it was good. I got the whitefish and it was ok. I've had better but it was not bad either. The best part of our meal was the dessert...a chocolate mouse...delicious but it was plated in a very unappetizing way. Now for the worst parts of our experience...They make you pay for the bread. Three dollars in fact. What french restaurant makes you pay for a baguette? This was weird especially considering the menu prices. Bread should be free and bountiful. It is staple in French cuisine. Bizarre. We were also not thrilled by the fact that we had to wait 20 minutes to get the bread we ordered. How do you not have bread baked at all times? The other bad aspect was the service. Our waiter was absolutely clueless. I'm not sure he had even read the menu yet. He seemed to have heard of all the dishes for the first time when we ordered them. He was friendly enough and attentive enough, just seemed to be in a daze. The food runners also seemed clueless. One of them dropped off a jar of twice baked potatoes (or something to that effect) that we did not order and did not tell us what it was or that the jar was straight out of the oven. My husband picked up the jar curious to see what was in it and he burned his fingers. Dangerous and not cool.  I really want to see this place stick around as I think some tweaks to their menu, service, and theme could make it complete with some of the other wonderful French restaurants in the area. Until the changes are made though, they won't be seeing us again.",0.9559,0.8,0.112,0.087,0.5300933345614195

We grabbed some seats at the bar, ordered 2 glasses of wine and looked through the menu.  Cyrano's has a great wine selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable. I ordered the popcorn & the lobster bisque, & my manfriend had the brie & gorgonzola with pommes frites. The few things we ordered tasted great & I'd definitely like to come back to try actual entree's for dinner, but my main complaint (and apparently everyone else's on Yelp's) is how slow the service is. Our server was also the bartender, and he was super friendly but was just never really around, as I think he was also training people at the same time. What we were hoping would be a quick drink & bite to eat turned into an almost 2 hour affair.

To make matters worse, while we were waiting for our food we inquired with our waiter only to get a big whiff of cigarette smoke - clearly he was taking a smoke break and bringing the smell back into the restaurant to share with us instead of checking on our orders.  Disgusting.

You can tell a lot about a restaurant by their salads.  I've had two composed salads, perfectly dressed and presented with craftsmanship and detail with broiled pears and a fresh vinaigrette.  Composed and classic soups have also been consistently lovely.

We made a reservation for girls night out Saturday night.  We all live in the city and were looking forward to trying something new.  We were seated promptly for our 8pm reservation.  The dining room is very cute and the decor is attractive.  We were surprised to see how empty the restaurant was at this hour on a Saturday night, however, we thought it may have been due to the holiday weekend (this is important to remember later).  We were not in a hurry as we were getting settled but soon realized that no one was in a hurry and the entire dining experience went downhill from there... Our waiter approached and we placed an order for a bottle of wine.  We then waited until his next return (5-minutes later) to place our order for appetizers.  The wine arrived shortly after and was appropriately presented.  It then took over 25 minutes to get the apps.  Now, this is girls night, we have now started drinking (some have had a drink before dinner) and we are starting to get very hungry.  We were not offered any bread or other appetizers as we waited now close to 30 minutes from ordering. We did stop another server to ask for some bread as we were all becoming annoyed.  Our bacon wrapped dates and mushrooms finally arrived.  The dates were warm and that is a generous statement.  They had obviously been sitting for sometime before being delivered to our table.  We quickly informed our waiter who apologized,  He immediately offered to bring us a cheese platter and said ""let me guess, you could use another bottle of wine, let me get you one.""  He then got us more bread, a cheese platter and brought out another bottle of our white wine...we thought we were on the road to a better evening. It then took at least another 25 minutes from the point of receiving the appetizers to get our entrees.  At this point, I had had at least a loaf of bread because I was so hungry. The bacon wrapped dates are only 3 in an order and we had 5 in our party.  We did know this upon ordering but we were obviously still hungry.  It was now close to 9:15 and we were still without entrees.  The dining room had maybe 15 people seated and most appeared to have gotten their food.  We asked our waiter yet again (with fear someone would spit in our food) to see where our entrees were.  He assured us that they were on their way.  He was apologetic and said that if we ""wanted to know whose fault the issues were,"" he would gladly tell us.  We didn't care, we just wanted to eat.   Entrees finally arrived.  All looked like what was ordered.  The steak, however, was extremely overcooked.  Now, at this point, we look as though we complain, A LOT.  However, at this point we were shocked that they overcooked a piece of steak in a FRENCH Restaurant!! Once again, we had to call over our waiter and he again apologized offering, ONCE AGAIN to tell us who was at fault.  The steak was removed and returned a short time later cooked more to our liking.  I will say it was still quite tough and not great.   In the end, we were comped the appetizers.  The overcooked steak still remained on the bill as was the bottle of wine our trusty waiter offered to bring early on.  We asked to speak with a manager who apologized and said they were ""swamped"" and had some issues in the kitchen.  He brought us a to-go container of homemade truffles (which were tasty).  He also paid for our friend's valet.  Overall, it was much too little far too late.  We were all in poor moods and upset that we had still spent a significant amount of money on a meal that was a disaster.    If you have read this entire review, it is clear that my suggestion is to go anywhere else in the city.  It is unfortunate that this establishment (which has been there for 17 years) cannot handle simple issues on a very quiet Saturday night.

2012-11-11,1.0,"We thought we'd try a restaurant in the neighborhood and were in the mood for some classic, French bistrot fare.  Cyrano's Farm Kitchen was a total disappointment on a number of fronts:  mediocre food and terrible service, most critically.   First, the decor felt a little like it was designed for Epcot Center ~ we were greeted by a great big ""Bonjour"" in a thick American accent.  Despite having reservations, we had to wait for about 10 minutes to be seated.  Normally this would not be a problem, but the restaurant was quite empty and the hostess had to go and clear a new table for us.  Once we sat down, we waited for over 15 minutes more before we had to ask the hostess for water.  She curtly replied that our server should have already been there, but she'll get us water anyway.  When the waiter finally did come, instead of introducing the restaurant, welcoming us to Cyrano's, or even talking about the food or menu, he simply and abruptly asked ""So, what can I get you?"".  Not a great way to start a meal.  We placed our order for the Country Pork Rillette and the Mussels Mariniere as appetizers, then one order of Shrimp and Lobster special, and two orders of Bistro Steak (medium rare).  The service was a disaster.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir, and then waited for over 20 minutes before asking both the hostess and waiter if the wine was on its way.  One member of our party actually had to walk to the bar ourselves to ask for the bottle of wine - where we were told that the bartender had received that order 15 minutes ago and thought someone already brought us the bottle.  Honest mistake, but it went downhill from there.  Before we even received our appetizers, our waiter brought us an after dinner drink and a coffee - cleary meant for another table.  We reiterated our order, and he walked away without apologizing.  He came back with French Onion Soup - and french fries - which we did not order.  He finally asked us again what we actually did order, because he had forgotten.  Horrendous.  While We ordered our steaks medium rare, but they came with a flag in them that said ""medium"", but were cooked medium well.  It happens, but if you are going to ""steak a claim"" and ""put a flag in my steak"" - then you should be sure you cooked it the way I asked.  Worse than that, my friend's shrimp and lobster dish had absolutely no lobster in it.  We struggled for water and service all night, and our waiter seemed only attentive and responsive when he brought the check.  We will never be back - I am so sorry Chef Didier, we had high hopes for your restaurant but had better service at a McDonalds.",0.9173,0.831,0.099,0.07,0.5292843719587905

This is a place that knows what it is doing, takes pride in itself and understands how to create a great experience for customers. Great variety of quality offerings with fresh ingredients and vegetarian friendly. Strong emphasis on the details-the meal was very well paced. It has a welcoming, comfortable neighborhood feel to it. I will be coming back.

2012-07-17,4.0,"Two things caught my eye while walking by this place on my way to work one morning, the interesting ambiance of a rustic French farm house and a beef burger with foie gras. I wouldn't say that I'm your everyday fan of foie gras, but sometimes funny things like this are spectacular when married with burger. I was right. The Farm Burger was spectacular. The intense flavor of the salty liver atop a lightly seasoned, juicy medium, quality beef burger, was killer.  Thankfully they didn't ruin it with a joke of a bun like so many places do.  I added a little of the aioli here and there, but this burger needed no help.  I love when new spins on old staples turn out so well. This is definitely on my short list of best burgers in the city.   I'd love to go back and try something else. Maybe. But, I honestly don't know if I'll make it past the Farm Burger staring at me on the menu. I guess I'll just have to mooch off someone else's dish in order to try some variety.",0.9931,0.687,0.259,0.055,0.501917130488559

We have been dining here for years (we started eating here before they changed it to Cyrano's Farm Kitchen), and the food and service are consistently fantastic. They also make a great martini. If you want a leisurely meal, they will happily comply. If you're hungry and don't feel like waiting, no problem. My personal favorite is the pepper steak and pommes frites. The chocolate mousse is also great. And the atmosphere just doesn't get better. Cozy and just what we're looking for when we are missing Paris.",0.9553,0.705,0.205,0.091,0.6136363636363635

2012-06-22,5.0,"AMAZING! My mom and I came here on a Friday night, and were easily able to get a table outside. Our waiter greeted us immediately and throughout the meal he was attentive and gave great advice on the menu. Also, I am gluten free and had very few restrictions on the menu. My mom only eats locally sourced meat, and all of the vegetables and some of the meats come from the Chef's own farm. Other meats are locally sourced from Indiana. We had the fromage du chevre and the brie cheese plate to begin. It was spectacular! The goat cheese was out of this world. We also had a garden salad. It was mainly arugula, which neither of us are very fond of, but the salad ingredients were very fresh. We ordered the Duck Duo to split which came out in huge portion (the picture shown is one half). The duck was amazing, incredibly tender and in a delicious cherry sauce. The roasted duck tasted perfect. We also had the goat cheese potatoes au gratin which were delicious and creamy. To finish we had the truffle sampler which came with a raspberry, grand marnier, and ginger truffle. They were outstanding, and you could order truffles to take home 15 for only $7.95. We also had the chocolate mousse which was to DIE for, it was perfect like eating silk. Overall, I would recommend everyone to try it even for just cheese and wine or dessert and wine!",0.9952,0.761,0.217,0.022,0.6591071428571429
2012-05-24,4.0,"I'm surprised to see such poor reviews for this place. I had been to the old Cyrano's and love the new concept, too. It's hard to find an affordable meal in this area, and the new burger-centric menu here is really high quality for the price. We ordered a few apps (the mussels were the most memorable), and you have to get the warm baguette, served in paper the authentic French way. The best entree I tried was the duck, so flavorful and moist. The chef/owner and his wife are adorable, and our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. It may not be as snazzy as GT Fish & Oyster or the other new spots on the block, but sometimes a classic, old-school meal is a nice change of pace from the ongoing small-plate craze.",0.8279,0.837,0.112,0.05,0.532042160737813
2012-05-07,4.0,"Linda, one of the concierge at the Magnificent Mile Marriott, recommended this restaurant.  They were booked but said they could work us in.  We had to wait for 10 minutes when we got there because they seemed to have forgotten about our reservation, but we ended up in their basement right next to the piano.  The decor and ambiance was great, but the piano player was not such a good singer.  The food took a long time, but it was not surprising because it was crowded and we ordered food that usually takes a bit of time.  The veal bone marrow was very good, but I would have liked more toast points.  The bacon wrapped dates were the best my fiance has ever tried and he ate every last drop of the roasted red pepper puree that came with it.  I think we shared the braised lamb (I'm writing this about 10days later) for our entree.  It was good but the white beans were underdone.  We had the delicious chocolate mousse for desert, but I thought it was going to have a warm chocolate sauce with it.  Overall, it was an awesome meal.  Though it took a little while for the food to come out, it was worth the wait.  The staff there was very nice about the timing issues and made up for it by giving us a small box of truffles.",0.9851,0.771,0.167,0.062,0.4685531135531135
2012-05-01,1.0,"The good or the bad first? Nice decor, friendly staff, cool name but horrible food!  There is nothing absolutely nothing redeemable about the food. To start, we had the escargots which brought zero flavor & 2--tiny pieces of crouton as bread. After the escargots we ordered the beef bourguignon crepes, which we thought would be tastier than the other choices they had on the menu. Yet, the meat was tough & tasteless; at this point the warning light should have gone off but much to our chagrin we ignored it. The hubby suggested we share 1-entree (dish). I had my heart set of the Seared Ahi Tuna, ""the Special,"" which I ordered RARE...guess what happened? Right, it was cooked nearly well done. After a long wait, our waiter (Jesus) finally came over & we showed him the overcooked Tuna. We were honest about all 3-dishes & he did not offer a discount, free desert, tea, coffee; Rien!. After clearing the table, Jesus didn't come by again until 20-minutes later, after I yelled out his name to get his attention so that we could get the bill. Again no remark from Jesus... I was left with a bill of $60 & completely dissatisfied & cheesed off. This is the least tasting (French) food I've ever eaten!  PS: Oh,a French restaurant (& this is country French) that  does not bring any bread to the table, not even with the escargots!

2012-04-02,2.0,"So I guess the old Cyrano's Bistro just changed their name and maybe their menu in hopes of reviving - what the other yelp reviews made it seem like - a not so great place. My meal I had here was very average so I probably wouldn't make any effort to come back. My husband and I had a travel zoo deal that got us an appetizer, entree, and dessert. To start, I ordered a french martini to drink. The server came over and pours out a clear drink from the martini shaker (french martini's are a pinkish color from the chambord). I told him they aren't clear and it's missing the chambord. He brings me back a pink drink this time and when I tried it it definitely wasn't a french martini. I have no clue what it was but it was some overly sweet drink that wasn't bad but I knew I wasn't going to order another ""french martini"". I didn't send it back because I knew if they got my drink wrong twice the bartender was probably just clueless. It was less effort to just drink it and deal. For an appetizer we ordered the mussels and baguette. I was a little disappointed that you had the pay for the bread but it was only $3, so not a big deal. It came with some butter with sundried tomatoes in it and some mustard. I think it's really weird to serve mustard with bread. Neither of us ate that. The butter was good, but I am a fan of plain butter with bread. The mussels were good, nothing out of this world, just your typical mussels. No complaints there. For an entree, I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the amish chicken. He said the chicken was good, but like the mussels, just your typical chicken. My salmon was good though there was an overwhelming amount of parsley in the lentils that I had to pick out. Again, average food overall. For dessert, we ordered these puff pastry sheets with raspberry cream in between. It was ok, kind of lacking in flavor and the puff pastry sheets weren't as crispy as I feel like they should have been. We were really struggling to cut them with our fork and i feel like good puff pastry should break apart easily. The last drink I ordered was one already on the drink menu (I didn't want to challenge the bartender in any way) - the french kiss. It was a ginger vodka that I think was mixed with sparking water. It was good and refreshing, definitely better than my ""french martini"" or whatever that really was. Overall, I wouldn't come back here. The travelzoo deal made it more worth it but I think there are a lot of great french restaurants in Chicago that leave you overwhelmed with delicious flavors and this just isn't one of them. The food was too average in comparison to all the places we have in chicago!",0.99,0.777,0.145,0.078,0.43223970944309914
