2011-12-15,5.0,"Avenues is closed and Chef Duffy has already moved on to his next project, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fantastic evening my wife and I had here for my 30th birthday.  Simply put, the meal was a master class in gastronomic artistry, balance, and creativity.  The thoughtful, perfectly executed food (the King Crab, Steelhead Roe, Kalamansi, and Togaroshi course was as amazing as you may have heard and then some) paired with top notch service made for a truly memorable evening.  The champagne cart brought extravagance to another level (with the price tag to match), but hey you only turn the big 3-0 once!   I'll save the dinner details for another review since another restaurant concept will soon take Avenues' place.  I'll just end by saying Chef Duffy puts amazing food on the plate and hopefully he gets that third Michelin star when Grace opens in the West Loop.  Cheers!",0.9933,0.725,0.255,0.021,0.5582417582417583
2011-10-06,5.0,"***I was able to visit Avenues before their well respected chef left; the tasting menu was very good with great flavors across a wide variety of dishes; too bad the restaurant is now closed as The Peninsula begins to transform the dining room into something else*** Now closed, Avenues was located on the 5th floor of The Peninsula hotel, which provided a nice (though not great) view of The Magnificent Mile.  Unfortunately, the room had a standard luxury hotel dining room (traditional carpet, traditional lights, etc.).  The open kitchen though was very nice as well as warm and inviting.  If they could have just built off of that, they might have been able to turn that room into a really good and more unique dining atmosphere. Thankfully, the food was very good.  Avenues was probably the Chicago restaurant that reminded me most of some of NorCal's fine dining spots, which focus on fresh, light and vibrant flavors. They did an extensive bread service here including a crusty and chewy baguette, a pretzel roll and a coconut and basil waffle.  The waffle was a nice touch and had a great crisp outside center.  Unfortunately, it was a tad dry and bland (some maple syrup would have helped). The spreads for the bread were great.  There was a very creamy butter as well as a flavorful lemon and olive oil spread (there was also a herb spread). The amuse bouche was just okay.  It was a mix of uni and rhubarb.  The rhubarb was good, but the uni lacked flavor.  The first starter was great though.  It was like a cocktail of citrus and very soft and fresh crab.  It was topped with a nice crispy sheet, which provided a pleasing texture to the dish. This was followed by a scallop dish.  The scallops (served chilled) were soft and fresh and were paired with a fragrant and slightly sweet marmalade as well as refreshing and light milk. The next dish was my least favorite of the night.  It was a barley soup mixed with oats, sunflower seeds and hazelnuts.  It tasted okay, but it was too reminiscent of an everyday barley soup. My fish entree was good.  It was a seared yellowtail, which was moist and flavorful (with a cooked texture that was similar to mackerel).  While the quality of the fish here might not stand up to top California spots, the sides were great; there was some nicely cooked carrots as well as a creamy and sweet toasted meringue. The Wagyu beef entree was also satisfying.  The beef was good (nice sear, juicy inside), but it was not as good as the beef I've had at fine dining California restaurants like Providence and Baume. The sides included a good red wine reduction (also some flavorful mustard seeds) as well as morel mushrooms and morel meringue.  The potato fondant was just a garnish, but the inside was noticeably undercooked. Desserts were done nicely here.  The dessert amuse was a candy shell that held a burst of vibrant yuzu.  My first desert was a coconut cylinder filled with a creamy and rich custard (great slightly mellow egg yolk color).  The dessert was cool and refreshing (good for summer). The second dessert was just okay.  There was a chocolate ganache as well as some hazelnut cake, sorbet and huckleberries.  It was sweet and tasty, but it lacked the flavor of the coconut cylinder.  They also provided housemade chocolates at the end of the meal (caramel, Meyer lemon, pistachio) and they were all good. Service was good--very professional and polite.  I felt the service was a little too stuffy for my tastes, but the staffed loosened up considerably throughout the meal, which provided a more enjoyable experience. Prices were high but reasonable.  They only did tasting menus here (vegetarian or proteins), but they were a much better value than the tasting menus at Alinea, Ria and L2O (mainly because they featured a lot of proteins and portions were generous). Unfortunately, the very well respected head chef left and then The Peninsula decided to close the restaurant.  This might have been my most satisfying dining experience in Chicago (along with Ria) and I would put it up there with some of my favorite meals (Sona, Providence and Baume). Parking does not matter now, but I imagine they did valet and it was probably expensive.",0.9994,0.763,0.217,0.02,0.5841993464052289

2011-08-29,1.0,"Oh, no.  Let me break it down: FOOD/ATMOSTPHERE: Amazing. 4-5 stars. Literally, was dreaming about some of the dishes we had later that night and thought about them the next day. Easily, l can say that the crab soup (first course) was one of THE BEST things I've ever eaten. Hats off, Duffy. SERVICE: No stars. A fatal error was made during the last coure of our service. We had a 9pm reso on a Saturday, so by this time it was 11pm and only 2 tables were left eating in the dining room. In the beginning of the meal, they of course survey for allergies or conditions - we had a serious no-alcohol request that was accommodated first by a complimentary glass of sparkling cider. Somehow between then and the end of the meal, the server forgot about the sobriety going on at the table and dropped the final dessert, which features raw amaretto brandy, haphazardly. One bite in and the entire ""special occasion"" night was shot. For a $300 meal for two, the service has to be as on-point - if not more - as the kitchen.  Such a serious slip up from a two-star Michelin restaurant. Totally inexcusable, would never happen at Alinea....or Olive Garden, honestly. Will not return and would suggest another venue if you want to truly relax with the type of service that knows your needs before even you know them.",0.9504,0.831,0.116,0.053,0.52160243138504
2011-08-07,5.0,"Full review in the blog - highlights below: Arriving at Avenues just moments early for my 7:00pm reservation and greeted by a young woman who greeted me by name (perhaps I was the only party of one that evening?) I was led swiftly to the otherwise empty chef's counter - to a seat perhaps 5 feet from Duffy and even closer to the rest of his team. With the menu explained - chef's tasting, vegetarian tasting, or any/all of the choices available ALC - and a small modification requested ordering was a breeze and with greetings by a number of the chefs as they did their work plus an invitation to ask questions about any dish or technique it would be a short wait before things would begin - first with a glass entitled ""Toblerone"" and without exaggerating a drink that tasted almost identical to the celebrated candy bar with notes of thick cream and honey muffling the almond and coffee tones of a blend of Frangelico, Bailey's, and Kahlua. Moving next to the tasting menu proper, the first course of the night is perhaps Chef Duffy's most famous - a layered dish titled ""Alaskan King Crab - Golden Brook Trout Roe, Kalamansi, Lemon Mint"" with so many textures and flavors that it really must be experienced to be understood.  Deliverd with the roe, mint, and other creams and textures atop a sugar chip with the supple crab, more roe, and refreshing cucumber broth below the diner is instructed to crack the chip and ""explore"" the dish - a great suggestion as truly no two bites are alike with some sweet, some briny, and all entirely delicious. For my 3rd course, ""Chestnut - Perigord Truffle, Quince, Garden Herbs"" was served in a hand-blown double glass vessel looking quite like the start of a potted plant this amazing dish featured a creamy chestnut pudding at its base topped with large chunks of summer truffle, small micro herbs, and cubes of quince gelee.  Ornate and again focused on multiple textures and flavors the dish was subsequently finished with shaved truffle powder and a mildly acidic vinaigrette just prior to service and with the flavors all melding into a sweet earthy porridge it was the scent of this dish that thrilled me the most - the scent of truffles that met you a good two feet away and perfumed the palate with each bite. Course four was another of Duffy's more famous dishes, a service entitled ""Grains, Seeds, Nuts"" and featuring no less than six variations of those ingredients including a 'veil' of toasted Amaranth and Herbs paired with roasted sunflower seeds, sultana raisins, hazelnut-oil powder and sunflower blossoms resting atop a blend of texturally complex barley, quinoa and chopped hazelnuts.  Again presented with a broth added tableside, this time 'sunflower seed tea' the aroma was something like a fresh field during summer in Ohio while the tastes and textures were light, complex, and lightly sweet. Progressing towards heavier proteins my next dish would feature ""Hamachi - Lardo, Yuzu, Rainbow Chard"" but that limited list of ingredients told nothing of the story of this dish - my second favorite of the night and one of the best fish preparations I've ever tasted.  With the tender hamachi first grilled and then topped with a drape of melting lardo before rainbow chard and balls of yuzu were added the smoky centerpiece of this dish was further complimented with a dollop of carrot froth, sliced kumquats, grilled morels, poached rhubarb, and a buleed cardamom marshmallow all adding a significant degree of variability to individual bites.  It was sweet, it was smoky, it was savory, and although complex nothing on the plate seemed extraneous or out of place with each component contributing to the overall effect. Moving to sweets - ""Sambirano Valley Chocolate - Brown Butter, Mandarin, Stevia"" proved to be even more texturally interesting than dessert #1.  Clearly unwilling to settle for subtle presentations, this dessert centered on dense 'noodles' of chocolate ganache traversing the long plate and intermingling first with hazelnut cake and freeze-dried mandarin orange, then frozen blood orange sorbet followed by sliced citrus and chocolate cake, and finally flaked stevia and huckleberries - a veritable roller coaster ride that served not only to keep the presentation interesting, but also to highlight the myriad nuances of the chocolate. With a copy of the menu gathered and bid farewell by the team (both in the kitchen and the front of the house) I made my way back out to the lobby where the chocolate bar was still hopping and met my family outside the hotel to tell them what they had just missed out on - a meal that blew ""NEXT"" out of the water and rivals L2o (under Gras) and Alinea for best in the city with a Chef every bit as capable as his pedigree would suggest...a chef whose next venture will not take me nearly as long to visit.",0.997,0.877,0.109,0.014,0.4543389724310774
2011-08-06,5.0,"Overall Verdict: This place is fantastic, well deserving of the recognition from Michelin. And, it is now taking the first place slot in my list of Michelin restaurants in Chicago.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it and will likely go back next season. LONG VERSION: Continuing on my Michelin star restaurant quest and admitting up front that this review is biased based on comparison to the other Michelin star restaurants at which I have dined.  See all reviews of the list here bit.ly/nGR9Vc Most relevant comparisons: L20 (taste and appearance of the food); Boka (boring bland decor); Ria (Service and friendliness of the staff; though NOT for the sommolier who was friendly but NOWHERE NEAR Dan from Ria). Food: 5 The food here was amazing. I had the Vegetarian Tasting Menu at $115 while another friend had the largely seafood based Tasting Menu @ $125  each. A few items were on both menus. Highlights include my favorite the Cauliflower with swiss chard and black cardamom; along with the unique vegan treat ""Grain, Seeds, Nuts"".  The two meat eaters at the table this evening enjoyed the  Alaskan King Crab (""Amazing!"")  but were less impressed by the Wagyu Beef Ribeye. EVERYONE loved the chocolate dessert (2nd of 2) while the Sheep's Milk dessert on the vegetarian menu seemed to beat out the frozen like a rock Coconut  concoction on the regular menu.  Decor: 4 YAWN!!!! This place really does look like someone said ""what should we do with that random space?"" and they decided to put in a restaurant. For pure aesthetics, I would give this place a 3, because really it is NOTHING SPECIAL.  However, due to the quiet, good ambiance, and ease of parking and dining, I bumped it up a bit. Service: 5 Where L2O #failed miserably, this place got it perfect. The servings came out in a timely and well-organized manner. Our glasses were always filled, and there was never (like Topolo) a moment where our table had no food. Friendly and attentive but not overbearing. I felt the staff here were working on the same team and actually liked working together. And the kitchen staff looked like they enjoyed what they were doing as well. Where L2O was a bit depressing, this place was upbeat. Value: 4 Pricing of this place is more like Boka and the Tasting Menu is pretty steep. However, unlike L2O, you do not feel pressured to do a wine paired tasting so you can choose a nice bottle of wine that can go with all courses and keep your bill relatively reasonable.  Somehow, we were full, happy, and had great service for $225 each versus $350 each at L2O. Still not as good a value as Takashi and much more pricey than Sepia, but this is the place you would want to splurge on rather than L2O. Overall: 5 I'm going out of a limb and giving this place a 5. I think that the food is great, service spectacular and the boring decor does not matter as much when you are comfortable and satisfied. Compared to the other Michelin starred restaurants, this place comes out of top thus far.  Therefore, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it and will likely go back next season for a new Tasting Menu.",0.9991,0.746,0.225,0.029,0.5818516694573032

And the service was attentive and impeccable. They have a large and splendid selection of wines. I didn't get to see the full menu, there were really only two choices, a 7 course chef's tasting menu with meat, and a 7 course chef's tasting menu vegetarian style. On the one hand this was an exhausting experience. We sat for about two and a half hours through the seven courses, including the amuse bouche and the final treats at the end. But what a great way to spend it. I was truly amazed by each course, but especially one of our starter courses that included suspending items on a platform of thin caramelized sugar in a glass.

We should have known we were trouble when we arrived for our 7pm reservation and we were told that our table wasn't ready...meanwhile the dining room was only about 25% full! After waiting 10 minutes to get seated, we had to wait another 10 minutes or so for a waiter to grace us with his presence. We started with two glasses of champagne from the cart. While the drinks were excellent, the prices were not! $24 for my wife's glass and $34 for my glass of champagne. Yikes. After the champagne, we had to wait even longer to order which is outrageous considering there are only TWO menu options (chef's tasting or vegetarian chef's tasting). The menus appeared to be printed on a home color laser printer, which doesn't jive with their four-star rating. We had the chef's tasting (with protein), and we felt all of the courses were pretty bad. The presentation of each course was nice, but the flavors and tastes really stunk the joint out. Some of the lowlights included the Grains/Seeds/Nuts soup and the Wagyu Beef Ribeye. Shockingly, even the desserts were pretty horrible. My wife wanted to order a drink to go with dessert and she requested the drink menu when they served coffee. However by the time the drink menu arrived 10 minutes later, our guests had already finished their coffee and everyone had finished their desserts! Therefore we passed on the dessert drinks. Considering this is an EXPENSIVE four-star restaurant, the service was appalling and the food was below average.

2011-01-22,5.0,"Avenues offers an outstanding chef's tasting menu, and truly deserves its reputation and Michelin rating. I find it most helpful to compare my meal here with recent dining at Spiaggia and L20. Where the other top restaurants serve substantial portions, I found myself leaving Avenues only moderately full. This wasn't a disappointment, but certainly a difference in approach among the kitchens. The courses at Avenues came quickly, I think no more than 7 minutes separating the last plates cleared and the next presented -- a fine dining land speed record. The service was essentially flawless, but also picks up the attitude of the Peninsula Hotel in which Avenues resides. I found the the service to be fawning -- nearly lickspittle -- and was slightly uncomfortable as this type of service is rare in 2011. I most enjoyed the famous Alaskan king crab soup, with a sugar tuile elevating some cool ingredients out of the broth when it is served. For a few dishes I wasn't thrilled with the flavor and texture pairings, but still enjoyed the dishes as art and sustenance. Here are my overall tips: -Expect to spend at least $200 a person. -If you are a cooking fan, ask to sit at the bar overlooking the plating area. -Don't you dare enter the Peninsula Hotel in jeans, sneakers, or a t-shirt. Wear your best. -Though I stand by the five stars, if you aren't accustomed to this type of restaurant I suggest starting with a different one -- perhaps Spiaggia.

2010-11-18,2.0,"Just left avenues after joining two colleagues for dinner. Generally it was a disappointing meal. Had it not been for the bread and extras served between courses, we would have left avenues far hungrier. The food itself was nothing special. The ""king crab"" appetizer, @ $21, was perhaps 2 tablespoons of food. The short rib entree offered at best, 2-3 ounces of meat. The chocolate dessert was a lab experiment gone bad. By far, however, the worst part of the evening was the wine service. When the wine steward presented the bottle, she commented that it was a little ""cool"" and that she would let it sit in the decanter for a while so as to allow the temp to rise. The red wine was refrigerator cold and should have never been served. She served it immediately and it was shockingly cold. There were 14 guests in the restaurant and what appeared to be an equal number of waiters. They waiters all stood next to the service bar like vultures waiting to pounce. A huge expense for a totally inferior meal. I want my money back. Shame on the chef and wine steward. Michelin **??? Gimme a break",-0.8925,0.822,0.066,0.112,0.5280045351473923

2010-10-25,5.0,"Just amazing.  Food, Service, champagne, wine choices etc.   Of course this what you should expect from a restaurant of this quality but what i was most suprised is other than the maitre'd everyone was very warm and welcoming and did provide more expression than what I expected.  had a  friend who was in town visiting and he knows one of the sous chefs.  I really didn't want to go at first and suggested a few other choices.   I am not a fan of the Peninsula.  Don't get me wrong I love opulant and enjoy feeling spoiled at a hotel of this caliber but I can't stand staying at hotels that do not have an energy and life about them and The Pen just makes me Yawn.  (the Trump, Kimpton Hotels, and a few Ritz Carltons can offer you both)  the Lobby is not welcoming and most of the staff makes you feel like your stepping where you shoudln't be and god forbid you talk to anyone.  He knew that I would truly love the experience so I gave in.  When we were the seated, the chef even he asked if he could choose our 8 course meal for us and we did the pairing menu along with it.  i won't bore you with all eight courses but at least 4 out of 8 were probably some of the most creative and wonderful flavors I have seen and tasted.  the other four were still wonderful tasting, just not as creative.    I will agree with most that the King Crab was my favorite.  I have been to the James Beard house for several dinners (used to do PR for a chef) and I can see why this has won the awards it has. I will leave at this.  I expected great food and got it, expected great champagne and wine and got it.  I expected stuffy and unpersonal service and really they were much more warm, talkative and welcoming than expected.  Few small jokes were cracked and they truly had an interest in making our experience what we wanted it to be.  and of course spoiled by the chef menu goes along way as well- LOL!

2010-08-25,4.0,"The Peninsula Hotel is my happy place in Chicago, my luxurious urban oasis where I always feel pampered and fabulous.  I had dinner here with one of my besties, and we had a positively lovely time. Our host was incredibly gracious and welcomed us to the restaurant the most charming French accent. The dining room is super elegant, much like the rest of the hotel. The lighting is perfect and makes your skin look radiant (aka, perfect pores). We were seated in the corner of the restaurant by the window, and had a very nice view of the city.  Right away, we were presented with the Champagne cart, where we had a choice of one Champagne and three different sparkling wines. I went with a light and fruity Italian sparkling wine (sorry, the name escapes me) and later switched over to something a little drier.  While we did have a terrific dinner, there were a few gliches along the way. It did take about 15 minutes for our server to come back, when there were really only two options - vegetarian or not.  The eight courses went by pretty fast, but we enjoyed them very much! I have to say that the Alaskan King Crab (1st course) as my favorite, and really set the bar high for the rest of the meal. Named the ""Best Dish of the James Beard Gala"" by the editor of Food & Wine, this dish certainly lived up to the hype! Other highlights of the meal include - the goats butter and two different olive oil emulsions served with the bread, Elysian Lamb Loin (Japanese eggplant was fantastic) and Strawberry Tube with Chambord (heaven). The braised shortribs were just ok in my book. It was a bit too salty and was a little dry. I still ate the whole thing.  My friend ordered a cocktail and I ordered another glass of Champagne. The empty glass made it to the table, but was never filled. Le sad. They realized this when they brought out the check. How unfortunate.  They did end up giving us a complimentary glass of bubbly, which was delicious. We left with a small bag of chocolates.... it was a lovely treat.  I do think the servers need an updated wardrobe here (and the rest of the Pen). Who's idea was that?! Overall, we had a very nice time.

2010-06-01,5.0,"************* REVIEW 158 *************** I often tell my friends, I follow the chefs, I don't follow the restaurants. If the chefs left, I'll follow his footsteps. I've been anxiously waiting to try out this dish ""Alaskan King Crab"" was the talk of the town at the James Beard Awards gala. His team earned the Food & Wine's best dish of the night, & right when I read about it, I thought to myself, I have to take to trip Chicago for this. I've been to French Laundry when he was there. I've been to Charlie Trotter when he was there. I've been to Aliena when he Chef de Cuisine there. So here I go again. The Peninsula is 1 of the finest hotels in the world, so I honestly didn't know what to expect, but let the chef surprised me: 1. Grains, Seeds, Nuts - amaranth veil, puffed, sunflower - clean & a fresh start. 2.  Alaskan King Crab - lightly poached in citrus with elements of spring cucumbers, wild steelhead row, kalamasi puree with floral note, lemon mint - THE DISH I've been dying to try since the James Beard Foundation Award event in NYC. Let me tell you, hard to describe when I crack that sugar tuile layer to get to the bottom of the glass for the piece of crab. It all made sense! It was such a gratifying feeling. I did it!  3.  English Peas - chilled soup of English peas with frozen coconut dome, toasted pumpernickel, pressed pineapple, golden pea shoots - amazing, refreshing & I felt like I was in a park playing, it was that much fun! 4. Alsatian White Asparagus, toasted milk, rhubard, sweet woodruff - the dish like an art work, so beautiful to eat! & the asparagus was really nice. 5. Homemade Tofu, smoked paprika, majool dates, parsley root. I thought of my mom with this dish, she would enjoy it tremendously. 6. Black Cod - brandade, pommery mustard, fennel blossom - oh so nice & buttery tasty. 7. Acquerello Risotto - 4 mushroom risotto with braised spring ramps, red wine, morels, sweet garlic - love the broth, so sweet & well balance. 8. Elysian Field Lamb Loin - hibicus poached majool dates, raw parsley root, pickled mustard seed, eggplant, nasturtium - this dish was so gorgeous &  memorable photographic - & the lamb was so tender, tasty & perfect cooked. This was probably on my top 3 dishes of the night. 9. Ohmi Gyu, with black truffle creme caramel, summer truffle, braised pistachios, scallions - I placed the truffles on my face & couldn't stop sniffing it. This dish was amazing. The beef was unbelievable tender, the truffle was pairing so well with it. Just simply a delectable dish! I could eat this dish alone all night! 10. Passion fruit, tapioca, rose, lemon balm - it brought out on an ice tray, I love it. 11. Dark Chocolate, saffron, honey, bergamot - this desert looks like my jewelry, seriously it was just so beautifully plating, that I just didn't want to eat! It was sweetness from heaven! 12. Raspberry, Thai black pepper, mascarpone, African blue basil - another art piece, I was guilty to break it open to eat it! Finally, another 6 pieces of chocolates to go!  Wine pairing was also phenomenal. The service was undeniable for me as the class to Thomas Keller & Joel Robuchon impeccable service. The night was so amazing for me, & probably 1 of the most memorable dining experiences of my life.  Chef Duffy was named one of the 'legacy chefs' at the James Beard Award & I'm sure it's just a beginning for him. I'm looking forward to his summer & fall menus.

The service was nice and very paced out for a total of around 3 hours.  There was an amuse bouche that absolutely floored us. The rest of the tastings hit right on the melody of this. We loved everything. I also remember an insane amount of delicious desserts. Seriously, I think there were at least 4 servings of dessert. The wine list is extensive & pricey ( and nothing available under $75/bottle), but we weren't really drinking that night so we settled for two glasses of pinot noir.

2009-10-12,4.0,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday this past weekend.  We really wanted to love Avenues, but, overall, we were underwhelmed.  While there were no flops in the food arena, there were no WOWs either.   The good:   - A bread service that is almost as good as L2O's, certainly far and above all other bread services - Interesting food combinations - Knowledgeable servers (for the most part, see below for the exception) - Fun, tasty cocktails to kick off the evening - The fish course was lovely, as was the beet course and the coconut dessert  Improvement areas: - I am an extremely adventurous eater and adore restaurants like Schwa.  That said, at a certain point it gets tiresome to have almost every dish served to you be ""artfully deconstructed"".  Funny that the salmon, the only non-deconstructed course, was one of our favorites. -   I was really surprised that there were no little surprise amuses.  I cannot think of another restaurant in this range that does not do something like this.  While the servers called the first course an ""amuse"", it was listed on the menu as one of the 8 courses. - The protein component of most of the dishes was quite skimpy.  Two tiny hunks of duck in one course.  A half tablespoon of beef cheeks as the capstone course.  What gives? - Atmosphere: It feels like you're in a hotel dining room (name tags on the servers doesn't help with that) - Jose:  Our head waiter needs some lessons in what service means.  He was, for the most part, absent.  Thank heavens for some of the other staff who were much more interested in our dining experience.  Jose did not even ask us if we wanted coffee, tea or an after dinner drink.  Just brought us the check.  And we watched as he tried to drop the check at another table while they were still eating dessert.",0.9968,0.734,0.221,0.046,0.5329081632653062
2009-07-04,4.0,"Good god, man, this place a needs a updatin a. Uno: Curtis Duffy replaced Graham Elliott Bowles last year. He's working with a skeletal staff--from my view of the open kitchen, it was less than both Schwa and Urban Belly--which means he is out there, on the line, working and observing. Saying how refreshing that is is a sad observation on the state of the chef-as-laborer, but the economy should put 'em--well, at least Gordon Ramsay--back in the kitchen. Dos: The room is still unfortunate; I'm sure the hotel guests think it's the BLT/Arnold Palmer room (they have a room just for that in $400+/night hotels, right?). The view looks straight out at...Nomi (the rich: different from your and I--because they like to look at each other at four stories up?). The place seems to attract...old people. I always love being the youngest person in the room, but Duffy is even younger than me; he needs a wider--and younger--audience. Tres: 8 courses for $115 is not a bad deal, I think; $150 for 15 looks to be a steal (though see below for a warning); you can even order a la carte, with the items culled from the pre fixe menu.  Careful with the champagne cart: with wine, you'll end up spending $300/person. Cuatro: Duffy has a very nuanced, very mannered take on avant-garde cooking, clearly influenced more by the formalists of the Kinch (Manresa) variety than the playful wizards (Cantu, GEB); if memory still serves me, we didn't have an out and out foam until dessert--though plenty of liquid/solid plays (e.g., gelees, ""dirts"", cremes, licorices). Highlights: 1) the opening amuse is shiver-inducing play on tradition, with a golden dome of a quail egg and meyer lemon gelee dotted by two kinds of caviar--the veritable math rock of fine dinings, with stops and starts of flavors as the egg dissolved in the tongue; 2) A king crab ""experiment"" that has African and South seas notes, with slowly revealing set of tastes from the cucumber puree, kalamansi juice, roe,and a few hits of pepper--would make a great summer drink (if, you know, you've got an immersion circulator on your deck); 3) a salmon belly, apple milk, and chlorophyll creme dish that lovingly ""cheated"" by showcasing its pure and lush fattiness; 4) a Wagyu ""cannolini"" that I did not order--expecting it to be boring, I ordered the rabbit and morels dish, which was good but nowhere near this--but whose Japanese touches (sudachi and shiso) and avant-garde whims (black sesame dirt, horseradish foam) were academically and gustatory-ily fascinating; 5) a palate cleanser of carbonated cabernet that popped--to climax the savories--but then relaxed the tongue for the sweets. Great stuff, all of it. Oh, but let's talk dish of the year: a study of spring peas in various forms (fresh, frozen, pureed, as shoots), with herbal and fruity notes coming from a lavender creme and macerated cantaloupe, respectively. Pure spring. Complexity articulated as a sense. One of the most brilliant things I've ever experienced. Sheer genius. You will have a few misses--such things are inevitable--and you may very well be disappointed with the pork belly course, which in spite of its cocoa and paprika licorice was pretty boring. Dessert is an afterthought: we had a study in chai that was two-star level and a belgian chocolate and strawberry construction that was profoundly unmemorable; the mignardise were novel but certainly not at L20's level. The bread and butter service, by the way, is excellent and very fun--I love me my $200 waffles (church!). Service was very approachable and friendly; they were particularly knowledgeable about the food, which I think is key for this sort of cooking. Nice to have the pretense broken down, you know? One last thing: order a la carte (I think). I know, I know--you just read 500+ words of mine about the degustation. But if you don't want to give up the time or the money required of it, you can order most of the items from the prefixe menu and save yourself a hundred dollars or so. The menu will change at the end of July, so I'd suggest waiting until the initial reviews of the fall menu come out, and then just order what everyone on LTH is raving about--that would be a heck of a meal, methinks.",0.9985,0.793,0.162,0.045,0.5397967772967774

2008-12-28,5.0,"We chose this place for our 5-year anniversary dinner. What a wonderful experience.  We live in the city and decided to hole up in the Peninsula for a decadent, luxurious weekend.  Neither the hotel or Avenues disappointed.  Our dinner was on the night of the Festival of Lights parade when they light all the trees on Michigan Avenue, so our view from our table was Chicago all a-twinkle and romantic.    The service was absolutely the smoothest I've ever experienced.  No one hovered or was uptight, and everything magically appeared and disappeared with precision and grace.  For example, I had a little purse that I tucked beside me on my chair.  At some point during the dizzying 15 courses, I realized that someone had taken the purse and put it on a cute little stool beside me.  Now that I think back, I'm like, ""Dang, whoever did that should go into pickpocketing!""  Don't freak out, the chairs are roomy, so it wasn't like someone had to go digging around for it.  It's just one example of how they anticipate things and really take care of you.  Our wine steward was young and very friendly, not the least bit pretentious.  We didn't get a bottle, but opted for glasses of a heavenly chenin blanc of all things, and then a carafe of a beautiful red. They perfectly aligned with our parade of courses.  I won't and can't write about every course, but a few standouts were (1) Potato soup.  A bowl with a stonehenge-like structure made up of 2 teeny potato columns supporting a thin slab of frozen bacon consume.  On top of the slab were teeny little piles of herbs, foam and who knows what else.  They poured the creamy soup around this structure, which you then broke apart releasing all the flavors into the soup. Whimsical and supreme! I hated to eat it and ruin the fun little tableau.  (2) Smoked trout with spruce meringe.  Yes, spruce meringe! The waiter said it the dish was meant to ""invoke the forest."" Well, dress me in some flannel and hand me a chainsaw.  The flavors were trouty, smoky and sprucy with cute little herbs delicately strewn about.  Eating this dish was like a lovely walk in the woods. (3) Lamb with gingerbread.  Very interesting flavors, this one.  I loved it.  The dish featured a ball that you broke open to release some delicious sauce.  Other dishes included salmon belly with cocoa foam and pistacio creme, cute little palate cleansers every now and then, wagyu beef and a bunch of desserts.   I very much want to go back and sit at the bar area where you can eat and watch the chefs at work.  Apparently, many of the dishes are so precise and delicate that they work with tweezers to get everything ""just so"" on the plate.  I read all the other reviews before making our reservations here, and I was hoping that it would live up to and exceed my expectations, which it did.  It's a pretty penny, yes, but you have go to these types of places ready for that. Whatever we paid for it was worth it.  They don't push anything on you, so order what you want with no regrets and enjoy!  It's a special, sublime experience, and sometimes those aren't cheap.  We walked out of there completely stuffed and happy, so whoever said they left hungry, I really don't get it.  But then again, we had 15 courses.  oink oink.  On our way out, they handed us a little bag with 2 juicy apples, a note card signed by the manager wishing us a happy anniversary and our menu rolled up with a ribbon.  The menu had been personalized for us, with ""Happy Anniversary Wendy & Eric"" printed on it.

The service and food were impeccable  The space beautiful and we had a great table by the windows.

There are three tasting menus to choose from- a 4, 8 or 15 course option.  We chose the 8 courses even after being assured from our server that if we went with the 15 course that he could get us out in about 2 hours.  I'm not sure how that would be possible given it took us over 2 hours to move through the 8 courses. I loved the presentation of the food.  Little planks made out of bacon, foam gracing the plates and multiple flavors and textures all mingling together to create taste sensations that were as interesting as they were delicious.  A few of my favorites on this night were the sea scallop with huckleberries, the hato mugi which was almost risotto like and the Wagyu which was the most flavorful beef I have ever had. The sommelier was helpful in finding us a bottle of wine that was the perfect pairing for our meal and was actually at the lower end of the price range of their wine list.  There was also a wide variety of breads that came out with each of the courses that were delicious. I would save Avenues for that perfect place for that special evening- after all- dinner for two came to around $550 including the champagne and wine so I doubt I will be a regular here.  But with the impeccable service and great food- I'd definitely consider it for my next special occasion.",0.9971,0.768,0.209,0.023,0.6353530130000719

2008-01-08,4.0,"In order to celebrate the holidays with my special someone, we opted to have an intimate, holiday dinner versus buying each other expensive gifts.  It was a special night, so I phoned the restaurant ahead of time and spoke to the sommelier in order to pre-select a nice bottle of champagne to pair with our first two courses.  Upon his recommendation, I selected a 1/2 bottle of Krug and gave my American Express in order to pre-pay for the bottle so that m date would not be charged for the bottle.  The champagne was also part of his Holiday gift. We walked over to the Peninsula hotel, arriving a few minutes early,  our table was not quite ready so the hostess took our coats and we headed to the lounge.  I ordered a Basil Hayden's on the rocks and my date a Stoli Soda and headed back as we finished our drinks. When we got back to the restaurant, we were told that we still had a few more minutes so I sat at the Kitchen Bar while our table was being readied.  I am glad I sat down for that brief minute because I learned that you can order any item from the tasting menu for $17 a course if you sit at the kitchen bar.  This is great news, you can sit there and have an abbreviated version of the tasting menu and have two courses if you like!  Shortly after we were seated our server brought over the champagne and we toasted the New Year.   I remember having the chestnut soup, which was fantastic.  And the sturgeon was remarkable as well - light in comparison to other preparations of sturgeon I have had at various other restaurants.  I was a little disappointed by the short rib (which is  usually a favorite dish of mine), it was over cooked - medium well. We only did the five course tasting and those were the courses that stood out the most.  I don't recall dessert but all in all, I thought the food was fantastic.   Ultimately, I would say that when I go back, I will most certainly sit at the Kitchen bar.   I love sitting in front of an open kitchen where the opportunity to converse with the chef exists.  I love to watch them prepare the food with such precision and attention to detail.  Best of all, I love the fact I can still have a four star meal in a more casual setting - and have the ability to pick and choose which courses I prefer.",0.9966,0.817,0.175,0.008,0.5188272476315955
2007-12-16,5.0,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers on this one. It's a great, make that incredible dining experience. My wife and I went a few days ago for my birthday and we were blown away at both the quality and creativeness of the food as well as the high level of service. Yes, it's not cheap but when you paying that kind of money you had better receive the ""invisible"" service (the staff is almost one step ahead of you) that Avenues delivers.  We tried a wonderful bottle of pinot noir recommended by our server and opted for the 15 course dinner.  if I go back, I would probably try the 5 or 10 course but everything looked great.  It's a great special event restaurant and we really enjoyed our four hour dinner.  I highly recommend it.",0.9923,0.724,0.276,0.0,0.6134285714285713
2007-11-29,2.0,"I went to Avenues about 3 months ago with my boyfriend.  He actually proposed right before dinner, so we were excited and looking forward to a great meal.  We only had about 2.5 hours because friends were meeting at our apartment to celebrate, and we didn't want to have them waiting there forever for us.   Our server was nice and congratulated us.  We wanted to do the largest tasting menu but were concerned about time.  Our server said that we could do it in 2-2.5 hours as long as we didn't mind if the courses came out a little faster than normal.  We were totally fine with that and very excited to eat. My boyfriend and I are very big foodies.  I kinda suck because I don't eat meat, but I love all seafood.  We've been to countless prix fixe restaurants, and I always let them know I don't eat meat but do eat seafood and I'm always really pleasantly surprised with the chef's substitutions.  Avenues was a whole new experience...and not in a good way. The first few courses were either vegetarian or contained no meat.  And to be fair, they were mostly very good.  Then came the squab with huckleberry, ricotta and truffle.  The server put the plates down and explained the components of the dish.  Since I obviously knew I was not having squab, I asked, while she was walking away, ""oh, and what am I having?""  This is honestly what she said, ""...everything but the squab.""   I almost started histerically laughing.  I've never been somewhere that they haven't substituted a protein.  I mean sear a scallop or something.  Grill a shrimp, no biggie, just do something!  Before this even happened the dishes were coming out slower and slower and we had no chance of leaving at the time they said we could.  Our server was also present less and less.  We had to leave 3 courses early.  They did take some money off since we weren't able to eat the last few courses, which is fine, but I'd rather have had the chance to eat them! Another nice thing Avenues did do was print out our menus with the date and a note of congratulations as a keepsake.  Wish I wanted to remember the menu more. Long (really long, sorry) story short, I was really disappointed in Avenues, and I just think there are WAY too many great restaurants in Chicago to recommend it.",0.9934,0.786,0.158,0.056,0.524650743313534
2007-11-26,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this restaurant.  The food was mostly excellent, the wine list impressive in breadth and depth, and how can you not love the Peninsula Hotel?  It's a beautiful, beautiful place. That said, I believe that Avenues falls short of reaching the Trotter's/Tru/Alinea pantheon of Chicago fine dining.  The dining room (which I understand was recently renovated) is unrelentingly stuffy, surprisingly dated, and way too quiet for my liking.  The food, which is well-prepared and of above-average quality, did not have the ""wow factor"" that I demand of a meal costing in excess of $100.  This was especially surprising to me, given Chef Bowles's current status as one of the rising stars in the culinary universe.  So, in passing, my review will be of little use to anyone, as my criticisms of Avenues are fairly vague.  But all I can say is that if I have $500 to drop on a meal, I'm going to Trotter's or Alinea.  Or Spiaggia.  Or Everest.  Or Topolobampo.",0.9566,0.762,0.167,0.072,0.6435185185185186
2007-09-19,5.0,"I really can't figure out why people are complaining that the food here isn't on par with Trotters or Tru.  I agree with Chris B. (and the legion of obsessive foodies-in-the-know over at LTHforum)--Avenues is the most grossly overlooked restaurant in Chicago.  In fact, it may be edging out Trotters for the top spot on my personal list of top Chicago restaurants. I don't want to sound like a snob, but if you're reading my review I figure you need some basis for assuming my opinion is worth considering.  Gambling a significant amount of cash on what you hope will be a significantly awesome restaurant isn't something most people do without some reassurance it's worth it.  And I do have a real basis for saying Avenues is fabulous because I have a lot to compare it to.  In Chicago, I've been to Alinea, Trotters, Tru, Everest, Les Nomades, Avenues; further afield, I've been to the French Laundry, Per Se, Chez Panisse, Gary Danko, Le Bernardin, Alain Ducasse, Jean Georges, Daniel, Nobu, Masa, and others I am forgetting.  What can I say?  Some women spend on shoes and handbags.  I spend on restaurants because I really enjoy dining out and take food really seriously. I kept forgetting Avenues existed, despite seeing the name pop up on LTH quite regularly as a top contender among Chicago restaurants.  Maybe I overlooked it because it's in a hotel.  Maybe I overlooked it because the chef isn't a celebrity, or because the name isn't that memorable.  I don't know WHY I overlooked it, but when I finally got around to visiting, I realized I'd been making a mistake.  Avenues is absolutely wonderful. The food is nothing even close to boring.  It's not Alinea or Moto, but experimentation is not the sole measure of what makes food memorably good.  My favorite restaurants tend to be places like this or like Trotters--places that experiment with tradition but don't go crazy with it.  So many of the courses at Avenues were stand-out amazing--the squab with huckleberries and ricotta, or pork ""barbecue"" with sassafras, or lighter courses like fennel gazpacho--and even the less-explosive courses were perfect in their sequence.  But then, I'm easy.  An upgrade to a full ounce of golden Iranian osetra for my first course had me in such a good mood I'd say my judgment may have been clouded if my husband didn't agree with me. All this comes at a price.  A 15-course menu, without wine or water or coffee or upgrades, is $175 a person.  Add in an aperitif, bottled water, wine, coffee--and it starts to add up a lot higher.  Do something like I did, and upgrade to osetra over domestic caviar, for example, and with tax and tip you're walking away having spent WELL over $1000 for two.  (Avenues did call the next day to apologize because they had double-charged for something and to tell us they were deducting it from our bill.  I thought that was pretty nice, given that there was no way I would ever have noticed that.) The service is very, very good.  It's more invisible than friendly, and exceedingly professional and competent.  The decor is likewise not obtrusive in any way, but is quiet and subdued with well-spaced tables.  I liked both, and thought them definite pluses. In short, I can't fathom why people overlook Avenues, and I certainly can't figure out what's going on with the negative reviews about the food.  Sure, Avenues isn't the dazzling culinary pyrotechnics people seem to expect out of restaurants today,  but I don't trash Everest just because very traditional french food disagrees with me (in fact, I puked my guts out all over Chicago Street afterwards).  I don't declare that Tru sucks just because I was majorly underwhelmed by what I considered pointlessly different but not very well-thought-through dishes.  My only guess is that some reviewers spend a whole lot of money for a special dinner expect it to meet some subjective ideal, and then decide that the restaurant objectively fails because they personally aren't thrilled.    And that's really very silly.",0.9979,0.764,0.17,0.067,0.550653324131585

I was sadly disappointed and now I question Brad and Angelina's taste in food.

Fifteen courses gives the chef 15 opportunities to impress us and well... there were only 2 real stand out dishes. I liked the Lobster course while my boyfriend liked the very chocolatey dessert. The remaining 13 dishes were fine, but I've had better for a LOT cheaper.  The presentation was pretty and the service was fine (although they could've done better with the drink refills), but I don't think Chef Bowles, is one that matches my tastes.

2007-07-03,4.0,"As I write this review, I am thoroughly ashamed to admit that my husband and I dined here for his 42nd birthday.  I am ashamed to admit that the dinner would have paid for 2 months of our car payments.  I'm afraid that my friends will read this review, and know how absurd and taken we were.   Neither my husband nor I have ever been to a true 5 star restaurant.  We really didn't know what to expect.  We knew that it would be expensive, but we were naive...seriously naive, we thought that maybe it might cost $400....we were such children. This is a restaurant where you truly feel like you are one of the special people. and have lots and lots of money.( No one needs to know the truth.)  The menu changes nightly.  And what I did not anticipate is that the Chef insists that everyone at the table order the same amount of courses to ease the flow.   It costs $90 a person for 3 courses.  $185 for their pre fixe 10 course meal.  And if you would like to experience their wines with every course, well, it's going to cost you over $250 a person.  Did I mention that EVERYONE has to order the same amount of courses?  Yes, I know that I did, but seriously....you really have to keep this in mind and be fully prepared to spend lots and lots of money. The menu was very unusual.  Lots of strange fusion whatevers.  The portions were miniscule.  Seriously, hardly more than a bite full.  You didn't have the option of lingering and savoring, the portions were that tiny.  We had our first taste ever of authentic Kobe beef...and when I mean taste, I stress taste...it was served carpaccio style...about 4 tiny see-thru slices.  We also had different kinds of stuff like confits, sea foam, and gross lavender salad. ( some things in life should be smelt only, never consumed!)  For dessert we had pastries made with Guiness beer.  Sounds strange, but awfully good.  The presentation, the service, etc was spectacular, more than we ever expected or dreamed of. We were starving when we got home.  But we were also in heaven. I give it 4 stars because it is an experience of a lifetime, and truly unforgettable.  Knowing that we could never afford to go back, we saved our menus as souvenoirs.   The host was sweet enough to tie 1 up for us and also present us with fresh from the oven lemon poppyseed muffins to take home. Honestly, had I done the research, we wouldn't have gone.   I am way too frugal nowadays, and way too sensible.  Since we truly had no idea what to anticipate...this was an incredible experience because it was totally out of our character and totally spontaneous.  Yes, we could have gone on a mini vacation, we could have done alot of things....instead, but there was something magical about that evening that made it worth every penny.  My husband and I made a pact never to tell anyone that we knew about what we did....this is the first time I have ever talked publicly about it.  I feel so free! So please....don't be dumb like me....be prepared to pay well over $600 total, and another $35 for valet.  I'm serious. P.S.

2007-04-18,5.0,"My first experience at the Peninsula came at afternoon tea almost two years ago. Since that exquisite experience, I have returned for Father's Day brunch in the Lobby, dinner at Shanghai Terrace, and several drinks at The Bar and have been more than satisfied every time. However, it took almost two years before my first trip to Avenues. Even after such intense, chronic anticipation, I was absolutely blown away. My date and I had picked out our meals from start to finish days in advance, and the reality surpassed both of our imaginations. From the pre-pre-appetizer (lemon and chive-flavored goat cheese mousse wrapped in a light pastry shell) to the parting gift (cherry-walnut shortbread), everything was exceptional. The plating was phenomenal, the aromas tantalizing, and the taste out of this world. Unlike so many other restaurants in Chicago, the environment was extremely conducive to conversation (granted, the conversation degenerated to rapid-fire ""this is so good, ""this is unbelievable,"" ""I think this ____ is the best ____ I've ever had,"" etc.). The dining room was neither brightly lit nor dark, allowing us to see the food that we were eating without being overwhelmed by light or lost in shadow. The tables were far enough apart that we could share our food without being mocked by the other patrons, although not far apart enough that we couldn't overhear the host and the waiters switching back and forth seamlessly between English and French. The chairs were extremely comfortable, remaining that way for the entirety of our three hour dinner. The service was to the standard of the Peninsula: knowledgeable, attentive but not intrusive, and very friendly and accommodating. My guest and I were greeted by name as soon as we entered the restaurant and treated like family throughout the duration of our stay. Chef Bowles was happy to substitute an extra fish course for my date, who doesn't eat meat. The wait staff was able to explain the tiniest nuances of the cuisine, from ingredients to techniques. In conclusion, my dinner at Avenues was the best meal I have ever had. Granted, I haven't been to Tru or many other ""Pantheon"" restaurants in Chicago, but I have been to some of the best in other cities across the world; Avenues definitely deserves to be mentioned in the same breath. I can't recommend it highly enough.",0.9918,0.862,0.122,0.017,0.5325925925925926

The food was very good, and the sommelier was very helpful as well.  I kind of needed it since the wine list was literally a book, and a weighty one at that.   My husband was bored with his Pheasant Pot eu Feu, and while it was delicious, I didn't really blame him.  It wasn't very exciting.   My Kobe beef (for a supplement charge) was very good as well.  The quail appetizer was delicate and moist inside, while maintaining a perfectly seasoned crisp outside--amazing with those tiny little things.  I ordered the Vanilla souffle as my desert, but to be honest, I could have just had the small scoop of rosewater ice cream that accompanied it and been satisfied, that was fantastic.   Here's my problem:  I could have flown to Europe for the cost of our three course meal, and while it was lovely, I just feel that I've had more memorable dining experiences elsewhere.   I'm glad we went, but I don't think we need to go back again.  Definitely worth experiencing.",0.9923,0.732,0.238,0.03,0.6463580246913581

Except Avenues. I really wanted to love Avenues, too. But, I just couldn't. The thoughtful servers at Avenues really tried to make our experience good, but the food prepared by Chef Bowles just flat out poor. My first experience at Avenues was at a Prix Fixe Valentine's Dinner ($175/person) where I was unimpressed by all but 1 of the 14 courses tried between my guest and I (the now banned foie gras lollipop) and borderline revolted by several (the worst being a flat out nasty, rubbery sturgeon over oatmeal.)  The wine director, however, was very knowledgeable and fun, and tasted our '69 Gaja with us and passionately discussed his takes on its taste and evolution as it aerated. He also suggested a stunning, obscure dessert wine that we thoroughly enjoyed. Additionally, we were nickeled and dimed for another $16 dollars for bottled water, were quoted a $35 dollar corkage fee, which appeared on the check at $50, and when it came to the dish entitled simply ""TRUFFLE"" on the Hers menu, were told we could ""purchase an upgrade to real truffles"" for an undisclosed price.  The chef and management tried their hardest to improve the experience, replacing my guest's main course with an alternate entree (which still failed to deliver) and inviting us back for a second chance at a discount. But, even on our reluctant second visit, the food wholly missed its mark and even the Kobe beef was bland and dull.",0.8587,0.721,0.163,0.117,0.4502164502164503
