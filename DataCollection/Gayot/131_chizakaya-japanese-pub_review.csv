2012-09-25,3.0,"I decided to look for an izakaya after going to an awesome place called Guu in Toronto . A breakdown of my visit to Chizakaya: Service: I went with one other person on a random weekday around 5pm, so it was pretty empty and service was ok. Nothing really wrong with their service, but nothing great about it either. Ambiance:  They were playing some good music while I was there (hip hop) and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  Food:  They were out of the puffed pig ear, which was a huge bummer, so we ordered the crispy pork and the pork belly bao to start. The crispy pork was really very good, but I would not get the pork belly bao again.  Next we ordered tonkatsu ramen (my favorite japanese dish)- the broth was so underwhelming. Tonkatsu usually has an awesome richness from being cooked for many hours (usually 20+ hours), but chizakaya's did not have this. I'm pretty sure they're using a powdered tonkatsu and not making their own broth. The pork shoulder was dry and not very tender.  Still hungry we decided to order a few skewers. We ordered the chicken skin, wagyu cheek, and the wagyu wasabi skewers. The chicken skin was cripsy and enjoyable, wagyu cheek was overcooked, but the wagyu wasabi skewer (forgot what it was actually called) was awesome! I wish they served that as an entree and not just skewers. We did check in on yelp and did get free dessert. I don't remember exactly what the dish was called, but it was a round ball of dough with honey and sesame and it was the highlight of our night. I recommend that everyone try this. Overall: I will be returning to give them another try. This would easily be a 4 star review had it not been for their tonkatsu and overcooked meat. I would recommend that people give this a try.",0.9969,0.754,0.214,0.031,0.6188117283950617

The lobster bao was really nicely done and the fish one was also good. The noodles were super spicy (we asked for spicy...but I will say that these made my lips plump like Angelina Jolie...).  Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was relaxing. Bathrooms could use a bit of cleaning (they were clean, but I think the person before me got water all over the place).

We started with the chicken bao (because it was so freaking good last time) and the lobster bao which was also delicious.  Next we had the Japanese sweet potato fries- there were not your ordinary sweet potato fries... they were less starchy than sweet potatoes that I am used to and mixed with the chipotle mayo they were to die for.  I was hesitant to order them but I was not disappointed.  We also got an order of the baby octopus skewers- they were great (but I LOVE anything octopus).  For our finale we had the chicken ramen.  I would highly recommend it!!  We had it with a poached egg and it was more than enough food.  Every time I have eaten here I have not saved room for dessert but next time I will change that!   We had Leo as our server and he was delightful.  Ivan was working behind the bar and he came over and said hello to us which was really nice that he remembered us from last time!  I think the staff is what makes this place 5 stars.  They are beyond knowledgeable and have such a passion for their food that it is easy to trust any food recommendation that they make.  Thank you Chizakaya for having such amazing staff and delicious food!  I look froward to my next visit!,0.9962,0.73,0.237,0.033,0.5616666666666665
2012-07-09,3.0,"Service was super attentive, even though it looked like he was the only waiter for the place (we went on a Saturday night), he did an amazing job.  Had great suggestions and was uber nice!   The only thing is ...well I thought the food was just ok.  Chizakaya really loves the deep fryer and I know that the point of japanese pub food is that most things are deep fried but Chizakaya takes it a little too far.  For example we ordered the pork belly bao, on the menu it says braised pork belly...the pork belly came fried.  We order the shouyu ramen - pork belly also came fried.  Now I love fried food but when I am expected lovely braised pork belly, I am super disappointed if it comes out fried.   The one thing that was amazing fried was the octopus biegnets - yep sounds crazy to order but it is really yummy.   We order mom's spare ribs - it was a pretty sizable portion, great flavor but some of the rib meat pieces were rather tough. Pork belly bao - sauce was good but again the deep fried pork belly just takes the flavor away. Shouyu ramen - was most disappointed as pork belly was fried, noodles were a little soggy and it just wasn't that great. Chicken skewers -  was ok, not as good as Slurping turtle. I checked in with Yelp and we got a comp dessert (so note to yelpers check in with your yelp app for free dessert!)   We ordered the bread pudding which was delicious - had a buttery sauce and came out hot and toasted.   Definitely a great ending to the meal.   I had a Lady Volda cocktail which was also very delicious. In summary, stay away from the pork belly if you are expecting takashi style pork belly or the typical pork belly.  Small plates are good, ramen was disappointing.",0.998,0.696,0.258,0.046,0.6731060606060606

2012-04-01,5.0,"Loved this place--one of my favorite Japanese meals I've ever had in Chicago. We made reservations for a Friday night and while waiting for our friend, we grabbed a beer at the bar. Most places don't have Sapporo or Kirin on draft, at least in my experience, and it was $4, so that was a score right off.  The hostess tried to put us in the back room, which was overly bright and with two big screen sports TVs, but we asked to be put back the front room, which is much more atmospheric and low-lit. They kindly obliged, but you might want to ask for the front room from the get-go if you can. We started with a few bao, on special. They were interesting in that the bao dough was used as ""bread"" and rolled around fillings taco-style. We had the seafood bao, which was wonderful--crab, shrimp, etc. mixed with mayo and lots of citrus and some herbs. The others had a few ""po-boy"" bao with fried oysters and sriracha mayo, which looked great. They also tried the chicken skin skewers--my husband wasn't much of a fan, but our friend was. Outside of the bao, the real winners were the noodles. Those two had the House ramen, with braised pork, slow poached egg, fish balls, and added mushrooms. I don't eat meat, but I tried the broth anyway, and it was incredibly rich and awesome. I had vegetable yakisoba and added a slow-poached egg on top. It was also incredible--the shaved bonito on top added an almost pine-y flavor to the noodles. Super high quality bonito. It was a nice surprise, but I didn't know that it was going to come with that, so if you're a vegetarian, I would definitely ask before you order anything on the menu to make sure you know the ingredients. The waitress was very attentive and the bussers also on top of everything even though the restaurant got busy quickly.

We were greeted promptly by the hostess who was also our server,she was very friendly and came to check on us throughout our meal. The food was okay. We had the crispy pork. The dish came with three pieces with a poached egg at the bottom. The pork was to be dipped in the egg - it was quite delicious! We also had the okanomiyaki (sp?), I've had better...it had a bit too much sauce to be very enjoyable. The wagyu beef skewers were very tender and flavorful as well. The mom's spareribs had an amazing flavor and extra moist texture, it came in a medium size bowl, more than what we expected! The tuna appetizer was disappointing - it only came with 5 pieces and tasted prefrozen...I know majority of tuna (raw fish) probably comes frozen, but it actually tasted very watery for some strange reason. The crab/seafood balls were yummy as well. I don't think I would make a special trip to this restaurant, as it is very far from us - but if I was in the area, I would definitely go back.

2011-12-04,5.0,"The best surprise of our entire trip to Chicago.  Read about Chizakaya on the LTH forums and after a bit of research, decided to make a rez for Friday night. First of all, I love the location.  Lincoln street bustles with great shops, bars and restaurants.  It's nice to be out in a neighborhood with so many options. We walked in at 8 to a packed house.  The music was bumping (Nas, Passion Pit, Common...) and set the tone for the night.  The restaurant felt alive and modern, with beautiful Japanese murals on the ceiling and a small bar lit by candles. The cocktail menu was developed by Nick and Ira from Bitter Cube and blew my mind.  I would think that matching the food to spirits in a Japanese restaurant would prove to be a challenge and normally I would have ordered sake, but I was curious as to what Nick and Ira had in store and ordered the Ferry the World and the Japanese Cocktail. I would recommend both, the Japanese Cocktail being the boozier of the two while the other being frothier and more seductive.  FI had the the Yasaka Shrine which was one of the first cocktails I have tried featuring Japanese whisky, which is more similar to Scotch than  American whiskies. On to the menu... The waitress laughed when we started ordering, saying it was A LOT of food.  We negated one dish and decided we would see how we felt after. We started with the black edamame.  These are soy beans that have matured which result in a nuttier, creamier flavor.  More umami present than a young soy bean. Onto the puffed pig ears.  I could eat bowls and bowls of these delicate, airy munchies.  The bowl we had disappeared extremely quickly and we fought over the last few crumbs, literally diving our sticky, greasy fingers into the depths of the bowl. The crispy pork with the poached egg melted in our mouths.   I am finding that egg yolk is my favorite sauce these days:) The takoyaki (octopus fritters) are a common street food in Japan and other Asian countries and are typically made with a Takoyaki pan, a flipable cast iron or electric skillet with spherical molds. These were crisp on the outside and almost liquid in the centers.  The bits of octupus were tender and flavorful.  Nuances of ginger and onion were present and the BBQ sauce complimented the flavors and texture of the dish.  The best part, the dish was garnished with bonito flakes that popped and melted making the dish look almost alive as we enjoyed it.  Be careful, despite my FI's warning, I popped one in my mouth right away which resulted in a couple of burnt tastebuds... We had the hamachi with bone marrow.  Japanese amberjack is a little oily and buttery, making it a great sushi fish and a great match for the gelatinous and rich bone marrow that accompanied the slices.  It was topped with crispy, fried garlic and house-made umeboshi or pickled plums which are known for the acid content they add to compliment many foods. We had four types of kushi yaki: chicken skins, sweet sausage, Wagyu cheek and beef tongue.  All were wonderful by the Wagyu cheek was the standout! The unagi donburi (BBQ eel rice bowl) was good.  The pickled daikon that accompanied it was a nice touch as it bought a crisp texture contrast to the dish.   The breaded chicken livers were earthy, rich and  unbelievably tender with a crispy outside.  The teriyaki sauce sweet and savory at the same time. My least favorite dish was the okonomiyaki.  This is a Japanese pancake that is filled with a variety of ingredients.  Literally translated to ""what you like-grilled or cooked"" this dish had an array of seafood with bacon and ginger in it.  The whole pancake was covered with a mayo-like sauce that, with the oiliness of the bacon, ended up being too much and way too rich.  The sauce disguised the presence of the squid and shrimp that only could be identified by texture.  The amount of bacon  over-powered the dish. For dessert we had the sesame fried mochi balls.  Mochi is a glutinous rice cake that is common in Japanese desserts and is one of those must order things for me when I see it on a menu.  These were delicately fried in a sesame batter and served on skewers with a black sesame paste that I swear had essences of chocolate.  Delicious. The negatives?  Service was only so-so.  It was hard to get someone's attention for another cocktail or the check and you really had to flag them down for attention.  The food pacing was all over the place.  If we were to go back, I would order in rounds instead of giving the server our entire order at once. There was one point where we had 5 dishes on our table and with certain dishes being temperature sensitive due to poached eggs or breading, this forced us to eat very quickly instead of being able to savor the flavors. The bonus?  Checked in at Yelp and got 20% off my entire bill, making this one of the most affordable places we went to over the weekend.  Less than $100 with tip for 2!  Amazing experience!",0.999,0.842,0.141,0.017,0.49574946817214854

2011-11-22,5.0,"My wife and I try to take time out from our busy schedules for a date night at least once a week. I felt bad because our last few nights out have been aimed towards my tastes instead of hers. Last week, I bit the bullet and picked a place that I thought she would really enjoy. Little did I know, the night would turn out to provide one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.    The first thing I noticed was our stunning server. Not only was she beautiful, she did a fantastic job. She made sure we were well fed and liquored up. The food was unique and delicious. Chizakaya offers a lot of small plate options, my Wife and I shared a few things before my gargantuan bowl of Raman. The highlights of the small plates were the Pig Ears, Chicken skins and Beef tongue skewers. Beef Tongue may sound gross, but let me tell you, it's tender and delicious. The Pig ears were out of this world. They were spicy, light and crunchy.    My Giant bowl of Ramen was fit for a king. This huge bowl of goodies consisted of bean sprouts, tender pork, scallions, and just to be decadent, I topped it off with some chicken dumplings. Without the side dishes, the Ramen would have filled me up. It's a hearty dish that I really enjoyed.   Do you want to know the best part about Chizakaya? It's an amazing bargain. If my Wife and I would have laid off the hootch, we would have feasted for under $40.00. It's a terrific value considering the high quality of food Chizakaya provides.   Here's the bottom line: If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, give Chizakaya a try. You will receive top notch service, unique food that will knock your socks off and a tab that won't dent your wallet.

I remember they had wheat noodles, which I appreciated, as I was on a veggie diet. I do remember there was not bread served while we were waiting on our food, which we prefer due to us usually coming to the place hungry. Also, we did leave a bit disappointed by the food. I do not remember what he had, but I remember him not being too satisfied with his dish.  I think this is place is a 'hit or miss', depending on your love/like for Japanese food.

Because they offer small plates, ala tapas style, we decided to just grab a few items before the main event, which was a lovely, steaming hot bowl of ramen. I had heard the Puffed pig ears was a specialty here, and it did not disappoint.  Light, airy and crisp, they were highlighted by a spicy little jalapeno dipping sauce.  Highly recommended.  I don't even care how bad they must be for you, I would get an order every time I came here. Then we got a few skewers. They are tiny toothpicks, 2 to an order, with bite sized morsels on each one.  We got the beef tongue (delicious, perfectly cooked and tender), chicken skins (not in any way as weird as it sounds) and the baby octopus (delicious but slightly rubbery)  For my ramen I chose the spicy version (what else is new) of the House ramen.  Loaded with braised pork, a slow poached egg, fish balls and nori, this had a pleasant heat that took a while to register and actually made me sweat a little!  Nice.   Plus our server was wonderfully attentive, and was by the table in a flash.  Nothing ever sat around empty, or did we wonder when something we ordered would appear.  Loved every minute of it, and appreciated their level of service.  Would go back anytime!",0.9911,0.786,0.171,0.043,0.5826420454545455

Sure, I was a little wary of some things, but after years of watching Iron Chef (the real one, not the one with the guy from Good Eats- sorry Monica), I was eager to try anything.   The dining room was on the small side, or, rather intimate as some might say.  For reasons unknown, power ballads were being pumped in over the stereo system, but it did nothing to dampen the mood.  Our server was very well versed in the types of sake when I asked a question about what kind I should have with our tasting menu.  When each course would be brought out, she took the time to explain what we were eating, which was very helpful.  Each course was just the right size and left us hungry for more....deep fried squid balls with bonito, arugala salad with beef liver sashimi, chicken wing covered in a sort of bbq sauce with rice...culminating in the most amazing ramen ever- rich broth, pork belly, fish ball, daikon, a lightly poached egg that just oozed yolk when you touched it....more please!  Even though the portions were ""tapas"" sized, we had enough to share with another friend who joined us.  Bonus?  The last two courses were their strawberry yuzu ice cream and their decadent mochi with dark chocolate sauce.   We loved Chizayaka!  Two of us live in River North and Streeterville and we kept wondering what would it take for Chizakaya to open an outpost downtown?  Please?  Pretty please???  Open one downtown?  I'll be your best friend!  (seriously, I would eat there nearly every damn day if you came downtown!)",0.9978,0.781,0.207,0.012,0.5737077737077738

Overall, I give this place 5 stars.  Its not perfect, which admittedly is what 5 stars should signify, but there is nothing else like this in Chicago and this place fills the hole in my heart left from the 11 months out of the year that I'm not in Japan.   Well done Chizakaya!!!

The drink menu is extensive, and fun to peruse.  My friend and I both tried some of the specialty cocktails, none of which really wowed me.  It's OK though.  This is more of a place to order a big, cheap Japanese beer or some sake. The food was great.  Fried pig ears were an awesome way to start out.  The crab crusted salmon was a knockout as well.  I will probably keep coming back until I've tried every last item on the menu.   I really hope this place succeeds so we can get even more authentic Izakayas in our fair city!",0.9894,0.773,0.219,0.008,0.4373543123543123
2011-07-16,5.0,"Forget your Americanized rolls stuffed with cream cheese and covered in sauce and tempura crumbs, this is what Japanese food is really all about. Ask anybody who's been to Japan about the food and they won't be raving about the sushi (although I'm sure its quite good), they'll be raving about the ramen, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, etc.  As a self-proclaimed Japanese-focused foodie, this place has all of the best Japanese foods that are impossible to find (including the ones I previously mentioned). == Food == (Five Stars) I am going to make it my mission to go back here until I've tried everything on the menu (and will keep coming back after that of course), but so far I've had the following... Wagyu Beef Cheek Skewer - I have never before had beef that melted in my mouth like this.  Perfectly seasoned with sea salt and some heat (guessing from shichimi?). It was unreal.  Order this, 'nuff said. Chicken Skin Skewer - The name might turn off some, but just think of it as a condensed version of the tastiest bit of the chicken, when it is perfectly crisp. In any event, another must-have. Takoyaki - Another one that might turn some off when they learn what it is (an octopus fritter), but you really need to not let that bother you.  This is one of the most famous and beloved Japanese street food dishes (particularly in Osaka where it is from) and a must order.   I guarantee you will not be able to eat just one of the bite-size balls. Okonomiyaki - Flavor-wise, this is like the big brother to Takoyaki.  Some equate it to Japanese pizza, but aside from the shape, and the fact that you put toppings on it, that's about where the similarities end.  Basically, there's some cabbage, a batter, and toppings (bacon, shrimp and squid) that are all cooked together on a griddle to make sort of a pancake type creation.  Then there's okonomi sauce (similar to the tonkatsu sauce on the takoyaki) and the mayo and katsuobushi.  This and the takoyaki are pure Japanese umami goodness (google ""umami"" if you don't know what that is). Black Edamame - These are dark green with darker blackish spots.  Basically soy beans that havematured a bit more than their typical brethren. More buttery than regular edamame and thanks to the chef's magic, almost a little smokey. Salmon with Crab Meat Crust - My girlfriend had this and I only had a couple bites, but what I had was delicious.  A bit basic for me, but still incredibly well executed. Honey Toast w/ Tres Leches ice cream and rum honey - Holy crap get this.  Its like grilled pound cake with the ice cream and honey on top.  Simple in concept, but delicious in execution. == Drinks == (Five Stars) I can't write much here because I'm horrible at describing drinks, but I had the Ferry the World and it was fantastic.  But I'm a sucker for anything with egg whites and absinthe in it.  They also have a solid sake list that I'll have to t == Service == (Five Stars) Attentive and very friendly staff.  The owner Harold is frequently out serving tables, filling water, etc. and unless you knew who he was, you'd never know he was the owner/head chef because he's just focused 100% on making sure you are enjoying yourself and taken care of. == Price == (Five Stars) The portions are decent for the cost, and this is typical small plates.  So don't be expecting standard American-sized portions where you have enough leftovers for two meals.  If you get a couple dishes and skewers, you will be sufficiently full.  If you don't get alcohol, you can  have a fairly inexpensive meal by any standard, and given the quality of the food, that makes this a steal. == Atmosphere == (Five Stars) Unpretentious, cozy, welcoming, modern.  Chizakaya is all of these.  The paintings on the walls in the main room make you think you're in Japan, and the backroom (reserved for larger parties) has a front row view of the kitchen. == Summary == Overall, a much-needed addition to the Lakeview area, which typically does not get the more adventurous restaurant themes that have been the mainstay of the downtown River North/Fulton Market scene.  If you love REAL Japanese food, this is your dream come true.",0.9982,0.84,0.135,0.024,0.5182730463980463
2011-06-25,5.0,"I am aware that some izakayas have had a rough go in Chicago, but this place is a gem.   This is a  very cool space...from the stylish exterior, to the beautiful ceiling murals inside, to the open-kitchen family-style back room, it could deliver for a terrific date spot or a large group venue. I have enjoyed Chizakaya for each of these occasions, and most definitely recommend it.  Following the classic fundamentals of the izakaya, the music is not just some background noise, but a feature of the place. I thought the hip-hop genre had good energy and meshed well with conversation. I am perhaps biased, but any place that drops Kanye, Biggy Smalls, Passion Pit, and The Xx on me in one meal gets an uptick in my book.  The food is fantastic, though I should warn those who translate ""Japanese"" as ""sushi"": this is non-sushi fare. They have a solid spread of appetizers and small plates that are great for sharing. We LOVED the crispy pork over slow poached egg (dip it!), sweet potato fries, and takoyaki. For larger dishes, I can testify that both the hamachi dishes are amazing. You can tell that some real care and skill goes into both the flavors and presentation. Chef Jurado has made stops at Charlie Trotter's and Japonais, and was very cordial in bringing some dishes out himself and describing them for us. He even took the time to walk us through the extensive sake list for pairings. They also have several ramen selections. I've tried both the house and seafood  curry selections, and each is flavorful and filling. As my last comment on the food, the mocchi (sp?) is heaven. Try it. As mentioned, Chizakaya has an extremely solid selection of sakes. They have to offer fifteen or twenty different makes, and have good options by the glass vs small or large bottle. Our table shared a few, and they can taste quite different from one another. I've also tried two of the craft cocktails, and judge the Pompelmuse (sp?) and Cobbler to be terrific. The bartender was able to make some good suggestions based on what I told him I like to drink. I will definitely try some others on future visits. I found the service to be quite good. Various front room and kitchen staff brought food to our tables, and they really seem attempt to get food out  immediately upon completion. Our waitress was attentive, and I have yet to see the bottom of my water glass while at Chizakaya. It's pretty easy to order as you go, as most things come out quite fast . If I were to nitpick, I do wish there was an outdoor seating area, and in my dream world they would also serve sushi.

2011-06-22,4.0,"Hey Chicago, you need more izakayas! I didn't know what to expect when I walked into Chizakaya. It's kinda small, kinda dark, kinda toocoolforschool. The interior is adorned with awesome murals, one with Hokusai-style waves and a Japanese girl, and the other with a samurai. A far cry from some more traditional izakayas I've been to before. But that's because it's not a traditional izakaya, and the food is not traditional, straightforward Japanese food.  It was pretty crackin' when my boyfriend and I walked in - which makes me wonder why izakaya spots haven't done very well in Chicago - but we were seated immediately and our server was very sweet and attentive. $4 Sapporos? Yes please. In a fancy glass? Well, it IS date night. First came the puffed pigs ears. If I could eat these before every meal, I would. Think chicharrones, but less greazzzy. So good. The skewers were pretty straightforward. Chicken skin sounds funky, but it's actually pretty tasty. I don't see myself eating the skin of an entire chicken, but a small skewer I can get down with. My second favorite dish of the night was the kombu marinated tai. The fish was so fresh and buttery, and seasoned with avocado, shiso and a lime vinaigrette. It might as well have been seasoned with crack. The pièce de résistance for me was the crispy pork with slow poached egg. It's presented as a small bowl - the pork dangling on a skewer above the poached egg à la Sylvester Stallone in Cliffhanger, and it's your job to end the pork's misery, plop it into the egg and enjoy it in all its glory. I wish this dish was the size of a swimming pool so that I could jump in, swim around, and eat all the contents. It's crispy, it's creamy, it's asdfoifjoihegoifjjf amazing. One negative - I wasn't a huge fan of the ramen. Chizakaya serves it in a creamy white broth that is a mystery to me. The noodles were not that flavorful but the fish cake that came in it wasn't bad.

They somehow combine creativity and tradition, and it seems the menu changes often but has several staples. The first time I came here I had pork belly, and it was absolutely amazing and perfectly cooked. The second time, I was here for lunch and I had the takoyaki (which seems to have the chef's own spin on it but is delicious) and the house ramen, which I would recommend to anyone who is apprehensive about other items on the menu. Most recently, I went here for dinner and tried a LOT of the menu. We had the puffed pigs ears which were crispy and came with a jalapeno dipping sauce. We also had the takoyaki again, the edamame, and the crispy pork. Everyone decided to have the skewers for dinner and share them. So I tried the chicken gizzard, beef tongue, wagyu cheek, duck hearts, the baby squid, and the bonito & pepper. Everything was delicious, but I will say the duck hearts are a little strange in terms of texture and powerful in their flavor (which, is to be expected). Not a dish for everyone. The desserts are also equally amazing, I had the honey cake twice here and I would definitely recommend it. The strawberry yuzu ice cream and brown sugar cookie are also really, really good.

All things equal, it's probably a good place for a date. The food, however, was just ok. Something about the flavors were off. Out of everything we ordered I probably liked the skewers the most, which is ironic because despite trying to elevate the concept of an izakaya, the skewers are probably the most basic part of the menu. And definitely do not order the tonkotsu ramen (though it looks like they took it off the menu since). All-in-all, it was fine but I dont think I would be back.

2011-05-12,3.0,"My friend and I came here for a late lunch one Friday afternoon after they started doing their ""Backroom Ramen"" deal. I got a $5 off coupon from Tasting Table, so we printed those out, and headed out for some FOOD! When we arrive there was only one other party sitting in the back, enjoying some ramen. Warning bells went off in my head, but I shook off the slight feeling of uneasiness. It was about 2 pm, after all, pretty late for lunch on a weekday.  We were seated by a very courteous server and given our ramen menus. They have something like five types of noodles on the menu, although to be fair, only three are ramen, with the two others being udon and soba dishes. I decided to go for the house ramen, figuring that I might as well try it. My other option was the seafood curry udon noodles, but I had had my heart set on ramen, so house ramen it was!  At this point, I must make a disclaimer. I'm not a huge fan of meat. I love, love, love seafood, but growing up, I hated most types of meat. I've been trying more meat recently, but I still can't handle it in large doses. So when my dish came out and I poked about and found huge hunks of pork floating about, I was a little put off. The broth was a surprise too - very creamy, probably from pork fat? There's a slow poached egg in there too... I had fun poking at it until all the yolk ran out and turned my broth creamy orange. Look - I can tell when a dish is made well, even if my own personal tastes do not align with it. This was a well-made bowl of ramen (save for the noodles, which were disappointingly soft for my taste) and fairly authentic-seeming. I've never had ramen in Japan, so I can't say for sure.  I'm giving this restaurant three stars only because I really, really, disliked the food I had. I enjoy clearer broths better (Arami's house ramen for one, I loved) and I probably would've rated higher had I ordered something else, like the seafood curry udon. Maybe at some point I'll go back and try that one, and in that case, I would revise my rating. For now, though, I'm giving Chizakaya a sad three stars, despite how much I liked the service and the ambiance (the murals on the walls are gorgeous and I loved that there were tiny hooks on the tables for women to hang their purses).",0.9937,0.75,0.172,0.078,0.612421557770395

2011-04-01,3.0,"Even with the izakaya theme, the Filipino lineage of head chef Jurado still comes through in several of his dishes.  For example, the Crispy Pork is very much like Lechon Kawali (and it gets paired with a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg that becomes a sauce for the dish) and the Sweet Sausage skewer is basically grilled Longanisa.  Back to the Japanese side of things, the tender and tasty wagyu cheek was another solid choice off the Kushi Yaki menu and I enjoyed the Hamachi and Bone Marrow as well.   Overall the food was good, but not necessarily memorable.  Price point is slightly on the high side, as the wife and I walked away with an $80 tab but not necessarily full stomachs.  There was a slight air of pretentiousness with the service, but the general atmosphere was good and I am a fan of the dim lighting and grey-toned interior.  Bonus points for playing some classic hip-hop tunes as background music, and a very good Sake selection is worth mentioning as well.  In the end this is a pretty good spot for a date, but maybe not to fill your gut.",0.9907,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.43041666666666667

Not every dish is excellent, but they are all ""good"" or better.  Sake selection has always served us right, speaking of which, the service has always been very attentive as well.

2011-03-26,2.0,"In short, this was a bit of a letdown. While the menu is certainly interesting, some of the flavors and options weren't truly Izakaya-style.  Our table ordered the Oshinko (Pickles), Japanese sweet potato fries, chicken ramen bowl, hamachi kama, grilled tofu and the hamachi with bone marrow. I think it's fair to say that we truly only enjoyed the frieds and the ramen bowl. The ramen bowl broth was amazing, as were the chicken dumplings in it (even thought it only came with two).  Part of the problem (not sure whether the blame falls with the server or the kitchen) is that we received an order of mushrooms that we didn't order, and then the server asked if we wanted desert when we hadn't received three items. These three items were put in to the kitchen, which I believe had started to shut down. It took 25 minutes for the food to come out, at which point our minds and stomachs had synched and we were no longer hungry. Not to mention that the grilled tofu wasn't interesting, and the hamachi kama was a slab of hamachi (with bone) that was grilled and overcooked and slightly rubbery. Also, the Izakayas I've enjoyed through Japan have a warmer feeling, with many more menu items and presentations that allow you to eat with just your chopsticks. Upon realizing the timing mistake and the fact that we didn't touch 90% of the last delivered food, the items should have been removed from our bill, or at least we should have been asked if the food was alright. At that point, we were done with the restaurant and I won't be returning again.  The flavors of Japan are unique and peculiar, a nice contrast to many other cuisines. This restaurant has a little more work to do to ensure that people's introduction to Japanese food is memorable in a positive way.",0.9781,0.826,0.128,0.046,0.5959160571229538
2011-03-24,3.0,"Dear Cousins,  Please forgive me if this was a sub par dining experience. I, too, was disappointed. But please don't un-fan me; my quest to find us another restaurant continues.... Love, Your Elite Yelper Cousin  (who HATES to be referred to that in your hopes to thinking we'll get some extra perks) Restaurant Week reviews continue to exemplify that this place was not to what everyone expected to be *authentic, Japanese bar food* okay where?! While I have never made it to Japan and may not be a connoisseur, some of the specialties were unseasoned and just lacked creativity.  Goal was to try as much of the restaurant week menu, family style, so everyone can get a taste and opinion of each item. For appetizers, we tried the black edamame, the pig ears, and the chicken meatball. Edamame was really good, and no, its not overrated. Staff explained that its aged longer, making for a nuttier pod. ""Now where do you buy this from?"", I asked.  ""From Assi"" a cousin mumbled under their breath. Staff said they were specially ordered from a distributor...darn... Okay, so the chicken meatball was a tad dry for my taste and even Anthony Bordain's Top Chef comment of ""you put a runny yolk on anything, and I'm happy"" still did not make this my favorite. The pig ears I chose were NOT what filipino chicharon idealize to be. Yes, they were puffed, but underseasoned to my liking despite the heat that was sprinkled on.  The skewers were actually my favorite course of the meal. The chicken sausage DID taste similiar to a filipino longanisa, just not as fatty. Thumbs up! The duck croquets were phenomenal, great crunchy exterior followed by a flavor packed soft middle.  I'm not a fan of peppers so regardless of how they tasted, they were pushed to the side For entrees, we had grilled calamari, the pork belly with egg and the seared scallop.  Pork belly was seared to perfection, had a nice amount of flavor.  Scallops done perfectly, and honestly, to those who stated they were rubbery, I would've sent mine back.  Scallops have that tiny window where after some ""carry over time"" cooking, no matter what, they're 86'd and done.  As for the grilled calamari, these were my least favorite.  The seasoning that they put on them made them taste burnt and charred after being put on the grill.  Not a good combination, but the calamari minus the seasoning was decent. I'd recommend putting the seasoning after being grilled. That taro rice pudding deserves a night of dreams.  Served warm, it was the perfect ending to the meal and was everyone's favorite dessert.  The taro flavor wasn't too sweet, and the rice itself was done al dente.  Coconut rounded it off with a nice added bonus. Now this is real creativity.  Chef also gave us some complimentary dessert bites.  Some vanilla coffee cake like dessert which was good, and some carmel brownies.  Thank you chef!  Might I add that these were brought out BEFORE cousin pointed out ""She's a Yelp Elite"". Ha.   Suchada was a wonderful waitress.  She recommends her favorites very well, and makes sure your glasses are never half full.   I'm giving this place 3.5 stars because I think there's still room for improvement in the creativity dept. I know they have it in them!  I'm not completely ruling out a 4 or 5 star review, which is why I'm quite to go back to try their well talked about ramen, and reevaluate.",0.9991,0.759,0.219,0.022,0.5858232181761595

While it ain't like any izakaya i have been to - it's more like a lounge -  the food is very good.  It's less of a greasy fried-stuff izakaya or a home-style izakaya and more of a trendy, upscale small plates place. That aside, there were items that I didn't get to try the first time around I would go back for.  Salmon, octopus, tofu, hamachi kama were all well prepared, tasty, and just the right amount for two. They should try enoki mushrooms for their mushroom dish, although the shiitake were fine, just a bit expected.  I wish the okonomiyaki was bacon-less. Drinks were GREAT. I especially liked the Tsuyu Doki cocktail - tea infused gin, frothy egg white, lime and plum juice. if you like gin, try this. also good whiskey cocktails too! Don't know anything about sake but seemed to have a wide selection. However...the bad part. The first half of our meal was served fine. The wait staff was not overly attentive, necessarily, but took note of when dishes were done and came back enough for us to order.  It was not crowded, or anything, despite it being a Saturday night.

The front room is somewhat small and a little bit loud if there are a lot of people in there.  The artwork on the walls is quite nice.  Overall, a fairly comfortable atmosphere. Overall, the service was really good - good on refills, acceptable on explaining menu items and going back for clarification when our server wasn't exactly sure on an item.  Food came out in a timely fashion - we weren't stuck waiting 30 minutes between courses which is something that makes me immensely cranky. The food itself was pretty good.  There were a few items that were maybe not the best but overall (the black edamame was just edamame and the pigs ears were maybe a little disappointing in comparison to what my dining companions were expecting).  I enjoyed the duck confit croquet and the wee sausages on the skewer.  I also really liked my sweet potato fries with spicy mayo and the scallops I had were perfectly done, though another member of our party who also ordered the scallops found hers to be slightly undercooked.

2011-03-06,4.0,"This place is truly doing something special and I'm glad it's in my neighborhood. Just take a look at the menu and you'll see they aren't trying to be like everyone else.

The light is dim and then the magic starts.  Open the Cocktail menu and it's inventive and introductive. Just to name a few: The Nihon-rita with Jalapeño Infused Sweet Potato Shochu, Combier Liqueur d'Orange, Lime, and Candied Jalepeño. It's sweet with a kick and then as you drink on, spicier by the sip. The Pampelmuse is my favorite made with Rehorst Milwaukee Gin, Lime, St. Germaine, and Creme de Violette. Smooth and sweet. The food is thoughtful and beautifully plated. They like to play with textures like pairing hamachi sashimi with bone marrow. The mouth feel is sensual and the flavor -- addictive. The tuna with spicy ponzu had just enough kick to make it interesting. The fish is extremely fresh.  A fun addition to the menu were the skewers -- chicken skins, baby octopus, beef tongue, wagyu cheek, and beef heart just to name a few. One of their specials was pig head roulaude with dallops of creamy pine nut ""mayo"". Delicious. Fun. Perked my adventurous side. Duck is something that I usually get when it's on a menu. I was not disappointed with their take: Duck breast, persimmon, chestnut, and mixed grain congee. This dish introduced me to congee and I loved it. It's like risotto with more texture and grain flavor.  Something else I never tried before: Hamachi collar paired with ponzu, daikon, and ginger. Amazingly delicate. Lastly dessert.

Everyone should have this! $10 off your meal~! Plus the lady was super nice and let us keep our card for next time. Yay. *Puffed Pig Ears. They weren't what I expected at all. For some reason I thought they literally would be puffed...soft and such. They actually are hard and kinda chewy but so tasty! The Puffed Pig Ears are only $4 and a huge portion! Definitely a good bang for your buck. *Atmosphere - loved it. We loved the table set up, wasn't too crowded when we dined here during peak time on a Saturday night and we loved the modern Rap music...Mos Def and Talib. *Biggest Hit Of Them All *Crispy Pork Slow Poached Egg*. This is just amazing. It's $6 for a very small amount of food but it's so worth it. Everything blends together in perfect harmony in my mouth~! Next time I might just order two of these and some puffed pig ears. Misses- *Wild Mushrooms. I'm obsessed with mushrooms and these were just eh, whatever. Nothing bad but nothing great either.

2011-02-19,2.0,"With the anticipation of Restaurant Week starting February 18, I made 7 reservations for the week.  The first was Chizakaya.  I looked at every menu and basically picked my restaurants off that.  This menu reads delicious but is just meh. We had a 7pm reservation and arrived about 20 minutes early.  There were a few tables and we got seated right in front of the door.  I would have preferred that two top tucked away in the corner but whatever.  The service was good but slow.  I understand you want us to enjoy our meal and not feel rushed but at a certain point, it just becomes laboring.  I ordered the sweet potato fries with spicy mayo, trio of Japanese peppers, duck confit and sweet sausage skewers, oden with soba and the rice pudding with coconut.  The skewers and the dessert were already determined selections made by Chizakaya.  The hubby got the chicken meatballs and the pork belly with egg.  Instead of an alcoholic beverage, I ordered green tea and the hubby got jasmine tea. I have to say the sweet potato fries were decent.  I loved the nori flakes and the black sesame seeds that garnished the fries.  The spicy mayo was on the thick, maybe too hard, side and I had difficulty dipping the fries in it.  The trio of skewers were good.  My favorites were the sweet sausage and the peppers.  The peppers had a little heat which was nice and the sausage was grilled well.  The oden with soba was just plain boring.  The broth had some flavor but with the winter vegetables, there wasn't anything that really added to the dish.  The rice pudding was the true winner of the evening.  The fresh coconut on top made it delicious and the rice pudding was very creamy.   So, yes, some of the dishes were good so why the 2 stars?  Well, after receiving the bill, we noticed both teas cost $8 each.  What?!  Are you serious?  A nonalcoholic beverage cost $8?  Had I known the tea would be that expensive, I would not have ordered it.  I have never in my life paid that much for tea and for a reason.  I can purchase 20 tea bags of green tea for $2.  I felt taken advantage of and know why the price of tea isn't on the drink menu.  The hubs was mad because for the same price of a drink, he got tea.  And the water wasn't even hot. To sum everything up, this place was unimpressive.  I won't be coming back and was disappointed with the quality and flavor of food.  On a positive note, the following restaurants can only be better.",0.9977,0.759,0.197,0.043,0.5337021821715701
2011-02-18,1.0,"Decided to try Chizakaya during the first night of Chicago Restaurant Week. What a mistake.  Food: We got the $33 per person menu - the highlight of Restaurant week. An appetizer, skewers, and entrée and a desert. Ordered the Puffy Pig Ears and Edamame. The pig ears were good and the Edamame - well, really hard to screw that up. The skewers this evening were a Duck Confit (really good), Japanese Sausages (eh), and a japanese pepper with bonito flakes (seriously smelled like ass, tasted very bland). Entrées ordered were Scallops with lemon curd and ginger curry sweet potatoes (super sweet and the scallops were overcooked - they were rubbery and did not melt in the mouth) and pork belly (this was wonderful). Desert was off the menu due to a coconut allergy - brownie, caramel, and vanilla ice cream - really hard to screw that up.  Service: This is were Chizakaya became a major #fail. First, the place was packed like sardines. As the tables didn't turn over that fast, the bar filled up. It got to the point where sitting in the tables in the front room had people waiting for tables and trying to get to the bar right next to them.  Second, imagine taking 25 minutes to get Edamame. One skewer coming out and the others coming 30 minutes later. And the entrées coming 35 minutes apart - when there was supposed to be one for each person.  Part of the problem was the bar was so busy our waitress was back helping the single bartender making drinks. She was back there for 25 minutes at a time - basically abandoning her tables during that time. After two hours of getting horrible service, we asked for the pork belly and desert to go. The reaction - a sigh of relief.  I am sure that there are great things on the menu. We had some of them. But the fact that half the food was average at best and some of the worst service I have had in a very long time, Chizakaya gets the worst recommendation I can give.

2011-02-07,4.0,"A couple of weeks ago, I visited Chizakaya with a friend off his recommendation. My experience with Japanese dining has been mostly sushi and hibachi houses...so I knew that this was going to be a unique dining experience. I have never been tried traditional Izakaya-style cuisine, however I was extremely open to the idea of the sampling anything new.     We arrived early on a cold Wednesday night, (which I guess happened to be a slower evening for them due to the time of the week and the weather). The restaurant had a cool setup of cozy tables and seats at the back-lit bar in the front section; while in the in the back section, huge communal-style tables (for possible large parties) with a topnotch open view of the action taking place in the kitchen.  There was ample seating available, but we welcomed an opportunity to sit at the bar. The service staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  We were greeted with an immediate hello by the bartender Ken, who offered excellent explanations of the various dishes on the menu.      Being a Japanese pub, Chizakaya had an extensive sake list, with around 20 different kinds to choose from.  To start our dining, we chose to go with a bottle of the Cloud 50 Yamaguchi--a delightful and sweet sake (Bartender Ken offered this great recommendation).   The portions at Chizakaya were small plates and meant to be appetizer-size type servings that you can eat slowly while you drink.  Here is a rundown of what I devoured that evening:   Beef cheeks: Absolutely ridiculous!!  The beef was very tender and had a tantalizing glaze.  One of the main highlights of my evening.   Sweet sausage skewers: Yum!! You can never go wrong with slightly-seared servings of sweet pork.    Wagyu beef with wasabi: The wagyu beef was juicy and tender and the wasabi was subtle and smooth.     Chives wrapped in bacon--Probably my least favorite item from that night.  Don't get me wrong.  It was good--it just didn't provide the wild circus in my mouth quite like the other dishes.   Crispy pork with poached egg: Fantastic!  I was told the point was to break the egg yolk and mix it around so that the sauce from the egg nicely coated the piece of pork belly.    Puffed pig ear: The best way to describe these starters are like light pork rinds.   These were faint and airy and melted in my mouth as soon as I tasted them.   Duck breast with persimmon: The smooth and nutty taste from the persimmon puree complimented the moist duck breasts very well.   Kakuni pork belly with pickled vegetables: Apparently, there was theme to my evening--pork!  Since this was the last dish of the night, it also was the largest size dish I ate that evening, and I was glad there was so much of it for me to eat.  After I pierced into the nice crust on pork belly, and scooped some of the rice and vegetables into my mouth, my eyes literally rolled into the back of my head from the salty and sweet goodness.  The pork was cooked perfectly--a great glaze on the outside but tender on the inside.  Eating this was the other crowning moment that night.   What I thought spoke volumes about this restaurant was that I got a chance to talk to the owner/ head chef Harold Jurado.  He asked us how our thoughts on our food and the evening, and even brought out a little sample of warm chocolate brownie and basil ice cream he was creating as a sample for our two person party.  I would have never thought to try basil ice cream but this was phenomenal.  Chef Jurado was definitely a cool, down-to-earth guy with a sharp and inventive mind for food.   Expect a laid-back and comfortable feeling from Chizakaya.  It is best to go to with some friends and try different dishes, sampling off each other's plate.  Most importantly, go there with the mindset to spend some time just drinking and enjoying the food as it comes out.  Overall, everything was hitting, and I was surprised by the different tastes that these eclectic dishes pulled off.  I plan to return the next chance I get!",0.9993,0.796,0.195,0.009,0.5632006521616909

The drink selection was awesome.  We started with different bourbon mixed drinks and beers.  We shared sips with each other's drinks.  By the second round of appetizers, everyone had a nice buzz going.  We ordered the fried pig ears and pork belly dipped in a perfectly poached egg.  I envisioned the pig ears to be floppy ""ear shaped"" that have been puffed.  But they were actually strips of pig ears that were crispy and awesome. Then we moved onto the hearts, gizzards, cheeks, and other organs/meats that were cooked on a stick.  I could eat these all night with a few bottles of sapporo served in small glasses. Entrees were a mix; we had ramen, pork belly, white fish, seafood pancake, and more pig ears.  All portions were plentiful and shared amongst the group.  We were all more than content and wanted to stay longer, but unfortunately, Chizakaya had to close.",0.9844,0.84,0.141,0.019,0.4326923076923077
2011-01-28,4.0,"I have never been to Tokyo.  I have never sat in a smoky izakaya next to a Japanese businessman drinking himself into oblivion with a side of chicken skin.  So for all I know this might be the most inauthentic place ever to call itself an izakaya. And I don't care. The dishes were almost all hits, with a few misses.  And the service was attentive and friendly throughout.  I'm sure it helped that we were there on a Thursday night in winter, but bad service will manifest itself even if you're the only party in the restaurant. We were seated in the front room.  I really liked the mural-style painting on the walls and thought they added a nice touch of color to an otherwise cool and somewhat dark room.  The back room looked much brighter and sounded a bit more raucous, but we didn't get a chance to check that out.  Next time. And there will be a next time.  Because there were some dishes that demanded attention. They started us with a bowl of complimentary miso soup.  This was okay.  It was very nice to have a bowl of warm soup after being in the cold.  Simultaneously a bit bland and yet a bit overly salty.  As Homer Simpson might say it was a perfectly cromulent soup. Life got better with the next batch of dishes.  The puffed pigs ears with togarashi were a salty, spicy, crunchy, porky pile of wonderful.  My lips were numb and my tongue was happy after going through a bowl of what pork rinds dream of growing up to become.   As we finished the pork the duck confit croquettes arrived.  These were topped with small cubes of asian pear.  This is important, because this helped make these the best part of the meal.  The pear helped give the dish a sweetness that made this deep fried candy.  Seriously, these are just wonderful.  The contrast of the duck flavor with the pear, all against the breading and slightly greasy goodness from being fried is just excellent. Next came a skewer with a small amount of wagyu beef, a little bit of wasabi, and a lime to squeeze atop.  The lime and wasabi combined to almost make the dish taste like something out of a Mexican restaurant.  Spicy and a little tart, along with the soft and juicy meat.  This was a hit. Somewhat less inspiring were the chicken meatballs.  I loved the warm egg yolk to dip the meatballs in.  And if I had these as a first plate I might have been more impressed.  But after the 1-2-3 punch of the puffed ears, the duck croquettes, and the wagyu-wasabi, this seemed a bit bland and uninspired. A few more skewers followed.  The wagyu cheek was unrepentantly meaty and almost like eating chicharrones.  And that's a good thing.  The baby octopus skewer was the only dish we tried that did nothing for us.  The flavor was okay, but the texture was just too unappealing.  Unless you have a deep love of squid I would say to try other things.  Like the chicken skin skewers.  Perfect for anyone who has been yelled at for pulling the skins off all the pieces of fried chicken before anyone could get their pieces.  I could have eaten about 10 of these. We finished with a bowl of squash bisque with lemon, Japanese curry, and blue crab.  This was excellent.  The lemon was a flavor I didn't expect to work with the squash bisque, but it was a winner.  It flitted through the taste of the squash and crab, giving a brightness to the otherwise hearty and earthy flavors of the dish. For the amount of food we had, the quality of the food, and the attentive service I felt like the price was totally within reason.  The most expensive thing was the bisque at a whopping $9.  Certainly if you come in looking to fill up to the point of bloating it could get expensive, but there's nothing wrong with being able to walk to your car instead of being rolled there. I hope this place makes it, because we had a great meal here.",0.9994,0.77,0.208,0.023,0.5842837546541252
2011-01-28,4.0,"So I got tired of writing reviews and mostly because I'm lazy and just wanted to use Yelp to find new places. However I felt compelled to write a review about this spot because it's different and people should check it out.  Most people associate sushi with Japanese food, so it's neat to have a different style of Japanese influenced food. Of course we're not in Japan, so the food has been crafted for american palettes, but its still damn good and authentic enough. We sat at the bar and it had a really cool chill vibe, with great lighting, it was nice to sit at a bar without a TV for a change. The drinks were spot on, most places' cocktail menu is full of sweet over powering cocktails, but not their menu. Very well balanced drinks and you'll be impressed with the method of preparation. Jane makes a ""sweet"" drink. I really liked the Shibuya Station, the Yasaka Shire which had fresh ginger that you could taste but didn't over power the rest of the drink. The Rakushisha was also very good. All Whiskey/Bourbon based drinks. Their cocktails have the same feel and style as the violet hour and longman and eagle without the violet hour prices.  The specials were great, I had duck hearts which I've never had before and I would highly recommend them. The texture is a little hard to describe, it is very uniform in consistency, a little more gamey than beef, but still mild in favor. They have real seaweed salad, not that crap every sushi restaurant serves. The Hamachi Kama was excellent. I'm really looking forward to going back and trying more of their beef and pork dishes, I was with a pescatarian, so the meat dishes were very limited.  All and all I would definitely go back and I hope the word gets out about Chizakaya.",0.9963,0.77,0.198,0.032,0.5137363430220574
2011-01-26,3.0,"Izakayas are somehow cursed in Chicago.  I wrote about Masu last spring, but the place closed within 3 months.  Others have also come and gone.  So it was with trepidation that I found myself at Chizakaya. They have very creative, on-trend cocktails and a large beer selection.  Sake gets its own menu, given Ms. Pabros' history.  I LOVE Franciacorta (Italian bubbly), so we started with a bottle of NV Quattro Mani.  The hostess explained that they only started carrying sparkling wine because of New Year's Eve.  After the bubbly was gone, we moved on to a half bottle of Southern Beauty tokubetsu junmai from the Iwate prefecture.  Clean and crisp.  Reminded me of spring water.  Or was it melting snow?  So we had 9 dishes between 2 people, including dessert.  I'll group the food into the following: LIKE - Puffed Pig Ears.  Move over Publican, this is where I will get my pork skin fix.  Paper thin crunchy deliciousness. - Beef Tongue Yaki.  The tongue came in folded ribbons on the skewer.  Nice char on the outside, meltingly tender meat.  Heaven. - Wild Mushrooms.  Sautéed simply with soy, lemon & butter.  My 2nd favorite dish.  Rich intense earthy flavor matched with rich butter. - Okonomiyaki with Bacon, Squid,Sshrimp.  Japanese pancake not commonly found in Chicago.  It was covered in paper thin bonito shavings.  Because of the heat of the pancake, the bonito undulated like some mutant seaweed for a good 5 minutes.  Fun. - House Ramen with Braised Pork, Poached Egg, Fish Ball.  Move over Urban Belly.  This was my favorite dish.  Super intense broth, brought even more so when the yolk was broken.  I loved that the fish balls were not the commercially-made variety.  It was more like a deep fried fish quenelle. - Taro & Ube Rice Pudding.  Nice tuber & coconut milk mixture.  We even got sweet sake on the house.  Thanks guys! DISLIKE - Chawan Mushi.  Our waitress made a blunder and did not put this order in.  The texture was worth the wait, being more like a panna cotta than custard.  It was topped with a layer of trout roe and dashi.  Made it excessively salty. - Hamachi in Bone Marrow,Garlic Chips, and Umeboshi.  Sounded good on paper.  I was most interested in the nodules of marrow, which our waitress described as nature's butter.  It wasn't bad, but I thought good fish should best be served without tampering. - Baby Octopus Yaki.  I don't know how far in the gestation period these guys were in, but grilling it made it worst than rubber toys.  The overpowering sauce did not help either. Why 3 stars?  While most dishes worked, with a few knock-outs, there were also others that didn't.  With the small plates format, it adds up easily just between 2 people.  Forgetting an order, I could shrug off.  But on a Saturday night, they were barely half full.  So my next thought is, how long can they succeed?  Let's keep our fingers crossed.",0.999,0.74,0.23,0.03,0.5195598845598846

I can't remember everything I had, but the most memorable things were the octopus skewers, delicious blue crab congee, and some badassed pork-belly served over a little cup of raw scrambled-up egg.  Take that belly, dip it, put it in your mouth, and let your eyes tear up and turn away from your girlfriend a bit so she doesn't see you welling-up with joy.  Then, turn back and go ""That's fucking delicious"" like you're just a cool normal dude who doesn't cry when he eats perfectly cooked pork belly. Also, check out the cocktails.  They were pretty unique and got the buzz and atmosphere going relatively quickly I think that we had fun overall.  I especially had fun since I didn't pay.  I'm not sure how often I'll go back, but it's cool enough to get my 4 star rating.

2011-01-07,1.0,"It's not hard for me to put my finger on what didn't resonate with me about Chizakaya.  It starts when you drive by, and doesn't let up until you leave.   First off, the space is unattractive.  I don't know what is going on with that lighting and the space over the center of the dining room, but it's unattractive and the light is way too bright.  No self respecting Japanese business man is going to drink himself silly in a room that is lit like a library.  The space itself doesn't lend itself very well to conversation.  It's a bit sterile on the inside, and quite frankly, didn't make me want to eat and enjoy a night out. The service seemed forced and awkward.  The type of food certainly didn't match the service, anyway.  This kind of food is best served in a fun atmosphere by people that look like they enjoy their jobs.  Nobody seemed to be having any fun, and it showed in the service and the food.  Once you get past the atmosphere and service, you have to dig into the menu a little bit.  We sampled quite a few dishes on the menu, and barely any of them were delivered hot.  Everything was lukewarm and sort of sloppily prepared.  The squid was rubbery, the gizzards were almost raw (a texture that isn't even close to tasty) the chicken skin was burned on the outside and chewy on the inside, the okinomyoki was bland, tasteless and chewy, and in general nothing really tasted like anything that I've ever had at a real izakaya. Which brings me to my final point.   Dear Chicago Restaurant Entrepreneurs, Don't pretend to be an izakaya!  Just call yourself another crappy old Japanese knock off restaurant that is trying to lure in suckers.  Small plates of deliciously prepared food with drinks, music and fun.  It's not that difficult.  Oh, and you can't do an Izakaya on a street without foot traffic, near where people actually congregate.  Put a damn izakaya downtown, near the CBD, please?  Nice Try Chizakaya, but you know what you are,  and you're not what you're pretending to be.",0.9932,0.745,0.181,0.074,0.4945651247976828

It is not, as most Chicagoans probably expect, your typical sushi, insert-meat-here-don, tempura restaurant. SURPRISE! It's not.  Instead it's a bunch of small plates and the food is more of a fusion of traditional Japanese dishes with...whatever they feel like.  I recommend coming here with a couple friends at least and getting a ton of dishes to split. You will (should) end up leaving satiated and definitely not sick of one taste on your little buds. I've always sat in the back with the large tables by the open kitchen. Love both of those concepts. Large table. Open kitchen. They have nothing to hide.  My favorites so far (been here twice, once for a complete tasting menu)... Hamachi Kama w/ponzu, daikon, ginger -- AMAZINGGGG both times I've gone, this has been my absolute favorite. One of my friends who came with me the second time picked this CLEAN. That is how good it is. Get this. Crispy pork w/poached egg -- I'm a sucker for crispy pork, poached egg adds another layer to it. Sweet potato fries and the puffed pig ears are just tasty and fun to munch on, don't try to deconstruct these too much. Although the jalapeno dipping sauce for the pig ears is fantastic. Have not had this kind of pairing before and I love it! From Winter Menu -- Kabocha squash bisque w/Japanese curry and blue crab. A slightly larger portion and very very satisfying, especially in cold weather. Especially if you love soup. Like me Anyways, I always enjoy myself when I come here. I'm not a big drinker, but they have a great selection of beer and sake as well. Everything together makes for a fun time. :) Oh and did I mention the owner/chef? Mr. Jurado? Great great guy.

She says oh I didn't know we had a website? I said well yelp and metromix has info on the restaurant, to which she replies oh I don't believe everything I read on-line (really was this necessary, why is it ok to be a smart ass with customers?).

We were both disappointed. What makes an izakaya fun is not dissimilar to what makes tapas fun: lots of good booze and tasty small plates that are a singularity, not necessarily thematically similar or complex. What we were served was high concept decadent food (deep-fried chicken livers, hamachi served with bone marrow etc) that was soul-less. Nothing was terribly satisfying and food was oversauced, overcooked, or overthought. I'm all for using Japanese ingredients and ideas creatively. I love a good simple menu centered around good alcohol.

I'm not sure how people who are not used to authentic Japanese flavors and textures will react to this place.  I suspect that I might not have raved quite as much about this place if I hadn't experienced all these delicious flavors before in different contexts.  All I have to say, is some of these dishes are probably acquired tastes, but PLEASE...go and acquire them!!

2010-10-14,2.0,"There is a trend in Chicago lately revolving around bringing the idea of Japanese ""Izakaya"" pubs to the city. The track record so far has been mixed, if not bad. Chizakaya is the latest attempt and possible the best to-date, though I never tried the others. However ""best attempt"" still does not qualify for ""great"" and I don't know if I'd call it a success. The concept of Chizakaya is well thought out but lacking execution. It would be great to have a go-to sake bar with great small plates, a change of scenery if you will. What we found was an interesting and difficult menu to navigate serving food most people did not know existed. There is talent behind the counter, some flavors came out nicely, but I argue the talent is misused. Our drinks were pretty good; I enjoyed trying a few sakes, Russ had their version of a mojito while Erica sampled the beer on tap. Our food was hit or miss, mostly just confusing. We were served an ""offering"" consisting of a croquette of pork. It was nice touch and tasty. Our first couple of ""small plates"" included string beans, daily gyoza selection (pork) and agedashi tofu. I liked the string beans more than my table-mates; they had a nice kick but drenched in the teriyaki sauce. The gyoza was pretty good with the dough having an interesting texture. The sauce wasn't very flavorful though. Russ and I enjoyed the tofu, though it was not the best agedashi I've ever had. I prefer a stronger flavored sauce with my tofu since it can be quite bland without. The challenge we faced was ordering what we could decipher as something recognizable. Those three starters were just a small sample of the menu, but a large sample of what looked appealing. We became more adventurous as the meal progressed. The second round of food featured our favorite dish, blue crab meat served with rice in the style of risotto. It was bar far the best thing we ordered and priced well at $9. I wish there were more noodle/rice dishes on the menu, only three seems to little. After ordering relatively ""safe"" dishes, Russ led the charge to explore the menu into uncharted territory. There is a section of the menu devoted to food served on a stick. The options are vast, but we went with sirloin steak (for Erica), sweet sausage, beef tongue, and chicken skins. You could get even more adventurous with gizzards and livers and the like, but this was a good start for our table. The steak was tasty, especially with the dollop of wasabi. The sweet sausage was kind of weird, especially since we didn't know what the sausage was made from (probably a good thing). I could not stomach or finish the chicken skins. I don't like skins on my poultry with the meat so I'm not surprised to dislike the skins alone on a skewer. To my surprise, the beef tongue was quite good. You would not know it's tongue because it looks like regular meat, tasted salty but with nice flavor. The final dish was something other people have talked about: hamachi and bone marrow (above). This was the biggest disappointment. The most expensive dish we ordered ($12) was the least impressive. The hamachi lacked meaningful flavor and the bone marrow added nothing. I liked the garlic chips but that was about all I liked. Bummer.  Chizakaya is not a complete disaster, I like the idea but it is too hard to navigate and figure out what to order. Russ asked the simple question: would you come back and what would you order again? I don't have good answers to either question. I like the pub feel and sake list, but that's not good enough. The funky food on a stick thing is cool but only so much. It's too early to tell what the future Izakaya scene will look like in Chicago, but since it's a huge success around the country, someone is going to nail it sooner or later.",0.9995,0.719,0.239,0.042,0.5840575241085445
2010-10-13,4.0,"Stopped in for a Saturday night dinner with my girlfriend after reading some good things. The space is different that how I pictured it. I've been to izakayas in New York that are a little older and darker looking, more pub-like. Chizakaya is a decidedly modern japanese re-interpretation with a pitched ceiling featuring anime-style murals. We started with drinks--their spin on the mojito is excellent and hopefully indicative of some of their other creations. We were then treated to a pork croquette, an offering from the kitchen. That small, crispy morsel set the bar incredibly high for the rest of the meal. We opted for the sweet potato fries as well as the crispy pork. Our main course was the house ramen and the clam dish. The fries and pork arrived first in short-order. The sweet potato fried were unexpected--the lack of orange color being the most prominent difference from what we were used to. They were crispy and dense, well seasoned, and served with a spicy mayonnaise that worked well with the subtle sweetness of the fries. The crispy pork is difficult to split among two people, as it comes in three bites and is small portion-wise. Plus, it is extremely tasty and you and your dining partner will fight over who gets the third bite. The slow-poached egg added another dimension to the flavor. Very sumptuous. I was literally drinking it. The house ramen was also different that I was expecting. It came with a milky and delicate hakata broth instead of the shoyu style common in so may other ramens. The taste of pork is very prevalent. Not a bad thing, but it caught me off-guard and I was very much in the mood for something a bit saltier. The clam dish was good, however a large number of the little guys didn't open on their own. We'd love to go back and be a little more adventurous with the menu. I'm sure there's lots to discover.",0.977,0.86,0.114,0.027,0.5241551729923823
2010-10-10,3.0,"Chizakaya was kind of out of the way in terms of public transportation, but my sister was determined to check it out.  To that end, we decided to take our cousin there as a birthday dinner treat. The sister and cousin each had a Sapporo on tap for $4 each.  That was not a bad price for the long and tall glasses that were brought to the table.  My $8 Lie & Cheat cocktail tasted like an $8 drink.  It was small, but had the perfect balance of alcoholic taste to fruitiness.  I rather enjoyed the sudsy top reminiscent of latte foam and lychee garnish serving as a substitute for a maraschino cherry. We had 13 dishes from almost every type category, with the exception of the steamed, fried and grilled sections.  Of the okashi (snacks), we tried the puffed pig ears and the crispy pork/slow poached egg.  The ears were deliciously crispy and served with a sour vinegar sauce.  The pork was skewered above the egg, which we were supposed to break and use as a sauce.  Since I love eggs, this was definitely a great dish.  There's nothing as yummy as crispy swine and gooey egg yolk. For the raw, pickled and salads category, we had the octopus salad and home-made tofu.  The dressing for the salad was a bit too tangy for my taste and the ingredients, while fresh, were a bit commonplace.  As for the tofu, it was my favorite of the thirteen.  The tofu was so fresh that you could taste the soybean.  As for the kushi yaki, we had the chicken gizzards, chicken meatball and confit octopus.  While I can dig partially cooked meats, the gizzards were a bit too raw for my taste. The ramen, while not winning awards for creativity or showiness, was not bad.  Compared to the other micro-size portions, this bowl of noodles was decently substantial.  All three of us got at least two tastes of the broth, noodles, crispy pork, etc.  Unfortunately, I only considered the oyster and clam dishes from the roasted section to be solidly good in flavor, but the flavors didn't pack a different or unique punch.  I've had king oyster before, so there was no epiphany from me. Lastly for dessert, we went with the yuzu cake/green tea ice cream and chocolate sesame ganache with puffed barley and soy milk sorbet.  Man this place really cemented my idea of small portions at a trendy restaurant because I almost needed a magnifying glass to see each dessert.  The yuzu cake reminded me of a Chinese steamed sponge cake my Ma used to make at home.  Instead of the thin sliver I was expecting, we were given a spooned out scraping of caaaaaaaaaaaaake.  There was about a tablespoon of green tea ice cream and some green tea crumbs.  The chocolate sesame cake was kind of hard to eat as the cake was slightly on the firmer side.  I was afraid I was going to break the plate or bend the spoon backwards.   Honestly some of the dishes, the skewers, were marked up versions of items you can probably get at Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights and definitely in your garden variety supermarket in Japan (I really have had these items in a market in Japan). On the plus side, the service was outstanding.  Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the other employees were attentive.  I'm not sure how I felt about the music.  Biggie Smalls?  I felt like it was the mid '90s and I was back in high school in L.A.  It was blasting in the bathroom, too.  Not bad, but kinda weird and out of context for this type of restaurant.  Then again, I was once in a club in Japan in 2005 and felt like it was the 1990s based on the spinning music.   All in all, this was a better than so-so experience.  Chizakaya, you weren't wow-za to me.  I may give you another try.  This time, please knock my socks off!",0.9974,0.828,0.135,0.037,0.5661258473327438
2010-10-10,3.0,"Staff was friendly Music was nice mix of vocal trance, groove Ambiance was hip and cool Food was 75-95% there.  I was left wanting it to be a little more at each level. We ordered about half the menu as we were only in town for the night and wanted to see what they could do. Crispy chicken skin had been left on the grill too long, so must have caught fire and charred the bottom half.  Need more salt to brighten it up. Pickled veg did not have much complexity and were all marinated the same. Fried chicken thighs had not been done enough so were soggy and too large of pieces to crisp and cook through enough. Also the batter did not have any flavor. Needed salt or Yuzu or something to cut the fat and wake it up. Hamachi was a bit fishy - too old? Ramen had decent flavor, but was light in complexity and on the broth. Noodles were a bit overcooked, so halfway through the meal, they were a solid mass. Green Beans - nicely prepared - crispy and tangy Piggy ear was one of the best I have had - perfectly, thin sliced and fried like a chip with a Japegno dipping sauce. Pork and slow cooked egg - though it came out cool as opposed to hot - was a nicely seasoned piece of fried belly.  If the egg had been sous-vide and been more custardy as opposed to poached, it would have been perfect. Yuzu cake was well plated, thoughtful, had interesting green tea ice cream and a fun take on a green tea milk crumb. I liked the delicate nature of the texture and flavor. Overall - I like what they are doing and hope they can iron out the little things to bring this up to its full potential. And might want to train the staff a bit more about sake as they could not pair or really explain them properly.",0.9963,0.801,0.19,0.009,0.491046626984127
2010-10-09,5.0,"I finally made the journey over to Chizakaya, which I mistakenly passed by twice because the front of the storefront was dressed in, for lack of a better description, vertical blinds lol. Upon entering, we were greeted very courteously and quickly. My date and I were offered 1 of 2 seating options, the communal table in the back by the open kitchen, or the dining area. In hindsight, I kind of wish I had opted for the communal table but I am definitely going back for another visit so no biggie. After being seated and given a couple of minutes to review the drink list and menu, I look up to see murals up on the ceiling which were quite a nice touch to the dining room. Nothing overly flashy, just the right touch.   Now I read the reviews on here from fellow yelpers before going in so I had an idea about what to order. My date and I opted to start with some sake, a sapporo draft,  chicken meatball, sweet sausage, and beef cheek. To our surprise though, before our apps came, the owner came out w a chefs offering (amuse bouche) of pork croquettes for my date and myself! Free stuff?! OK! Ive never had a pork croquette before, but the sheer thought of it  was already sounding appealing...and that it was.  The chicken meatball has a very nice texture, with a great flavor to it. The sweet sausage, sweet with a hint of saltiness to it (although that mightve been the salt that was meant for the beef cheek) The beef cheek though I think stole the show, soft and flavorful w every bite. I took my time w that one...all 3 were served on skewers. In between sapporo, sips of sake, partaking in the skewers and some good conversation, I was conflicted with what to order for the main part of our meal. I wanted to leave some things for another visit (i.e. puffed pig ears, crispy pork/slow poached egg which by the way I REALLY wanted to try, and hamachi w bone marrow) so I chose to go with the king oyster mushrooms and the hamachi kama (collar). The king oyster mushrooms was great as a side/accompanying dish, I wouldnt recommend getting it as a standalone dish. Then the hamachi kama came out...talk about perfection. Fish was cooked perfectly through and through, texture was amazing and the ponzu, daikon, and ginger definitely help accent the fish as a whole. Some more of the items that caught my eye for future visits are the steamed walleye, whole saba (I love mackerel), and crispy chicken thighs. My overall experience at Chizakaya was a memorable one. From the hostess, who actually checked up on us during the course of our meal, to the wait staff who by the way are very friendly and very knowledgeable, to the cooks, it was my idea of a 5 star experience. I know what you might be thinking, is the price worth it? I can never put a price on great eats, and I spared no expense my first time here. Go big or go home I say! Subtract the cost of drinks from the bill, I definitely think the meal was worth it. I look forward to going back to Chizakaya and I look forward to writing another satisfying review!",0.9986,0.794,0.181,0.025,0.5565476190476191
2010-10-05,3.0,"I thought I was going to absolutely love this place due to the fact that my brother recommended it by saying it could compete with my  latest restaurant find - Chilapan (AMAZING Mexican in north Bucktown). I walked up to the rather over-done exterior of Chizakaya last night with my boyfriend, expecting great things as I walked in the door. The inside was really cool - great murals on the ceiling, and it was pretty full for a Monday night. Anyway, on to the food. What we ordered:  Pork with poached egg - Good flavor, super rich. My boyfriend liked this the best. I at least liked it. Walleye - I was bored by this and overwhelmed again with its rich flavor. BF thought it was okay. Corn fritters - My brother described these as tasting like ""fried dough from the carnival."" Turns out they were more interesting in flavor than that, with lime and spicy mayo but again, very rich and oily. Mushrooms - The waitress told us this was her hands-down favorite thing on the menu. I can make MUCH better mushrooms at home. They had an overwhelming lemon butter flavor, and weren't cooked enough. The chewy, lemon zest taste did not live up to than the amazingness I usually relate to all mushrooms. Beef cheek skewer - This was awesome. The flavors far exceeded the other plates. However, by this point, I was honestly slightly nauseous from the richness of the food.  Octopus skewer - Good. Again, nausea and chewy octopus tentacles don't go well together, but I could appreciate the flavor. So the story is, if you really enjoy rich food like my brother, you will probably enjoy this place. The food is creative and refreshing for  Japanese cuisine in Chicago. Still, I left feeling like I had eaten 5 bites of food and a full cup of oil and butter, undecided whether I was full from food or nausea. Needless to say, I don't really want to go back.",0.9979,0.726,0.254,0.021,0.596276595744681
2010-10-04,4.0,"After receiving a Tasting Table email about Chizakaya (they had me at hamachi with nuggets of bone marrow and fried garlic), my friend and I decided to try it out ASAP. So, guessing that the place was likely to have a long wait and unlikely to take reservations, I sent an email to them. I got a nice response letting me know that the waits didn't start until 8 (I wanted to get a reservation for 7:30) and that the hostess would put my name down for 7:30 in case there was a wait. Luckily, I got there on time and was promptly seated. I definitely got a Japanese pub-y vibe, with the open kitchen and high tables, which was a nice plus. I was hungry so of course everything sounded appealing and affordable so here is a rundown of what we ordered: Puffed Pig Ears, Togarashi - yum! very chicharron-ish and a good amount, perfect for snacking before everything else came out. Crispy Pork, Slow Poached Egg - this was my favorite. The crispy pork came out on a skewer to be dropped into the poached egg. Porky-eggy amazingness. Hamachi, Bone Marrow, Garlic, Umeboshi - the reason why I came. Unfortunately I expected the bone marrow to be softer, so it had the consistency of solidified lard. Otherwise, a tasty dish. Kombu Marinated Tai (Snapper), Avocado, Shiso, Lime Vinaigrette - really good, nice quality fish, exactly what I was hoping for. Cold Soba, Summer Vegetables, Shrimp Tempura - good, but a bit overpriced for the portion size. Next time I would order more of some of the other stuff, such as the tai or the crispy pork. Corn Fritter, Chili, Lime, Mayo - Sounded good, looked cool, but really not great. Mostly fritter and not much corn -- basically a bunch of fried batter. Overall, I really liked Chizakaya. The creativity was definitely there, the portion sizes and prices were good for sharing, and it was definitely like what I hoped for when I read ""izakaya"".. four stars.",0.9937,0.807,0.175,0.019,0.559114114114114
2010-10-03,5.0,"Went here for dinner on Friday night.  For once, a restaurant actually lived up to the hype.  As described in other reviews, this places has small dishes that can easily be shared.  Tried at least 10 dishes.  All of them were outstanding.  My favorite was definitely the crispy pork belly that you dip in a poached egg.  Don't expect typical Japanese restaurant food (sushi, teriyaki, etc).  The other great thing about this place is that they have Hitachino on tap (although its a bit pricey at $7 a glass).  Service was also great.  Waitress was very helpful in recommending dishes and plenty of staff to clear plates and bring out food (especially helpful in a tapas style environment).  Only drawback to this place is that it is a bit pricey.  Granted that I am a fat kid and like to eat lot, our bill for two with 5 drinks was over $100.",0.9872,0.784,0.216,0.0,0.5612745098039216

Our waitress was not very helpful.  She didn't explain things on the menu like how we overheard other waitresses do.  I had to ask her how we would typically order.  What were the most popular dishes?  etc.  We just kept ordering and ordering because she said the dishes were small. She said typically you would order from each category.  And when I asked her if she thought that was too much, she shrugged and still made it seem like we didn't order enough.   The pub is known for serving 2 rare sakes that are not served anywhere in the US.  Our waitress, unfortunately did not know what we were talking about.  How could you not know????  Your restaurant was just featured in Time Out (last week) for having a spectacular Sommelier from L20!  WTF? For the 2 of us, we ordered:  -Kobe yaki: their special for the day.  not bad, very tender, cooked medium rare to enjoy the fat content -Octopus yaki:  one of my faves.  sooo delicious. it was grilled perfectly, crunchy on the outside and still very tender... didn't become rubbery -Daicon salad with anchovies and grilled seaweed.  The grilled seaweed was disappointingly nori paper.  blah.  But the dressing was tasty and the daicon was refreshing   -Crispy pork:  Well cooked pork belly on a skewer served with a slowly cooked poached egg that you break and dip the pork in.  I'm not a yolk eating person... so I passed.  I dipped the pork in the daicon salad dressing. -grilled eggplant with miso dressing.  Tasty but could've done without -King oyster mushroom dish.  Soooooooo freaking good.  A little salty, but almost tasted meaty because of the heartiness of the larger mushrooms. -Steamed walleye with ginger and lemon.  Tasty.  Delicate.  Cooked well.  Very flaky and light.   -Crispy chicken thighs.  Good crunchy breading with mayo dipping sauce.  the lemon spritzed arugula was a nice light touch to break up the heavy dish. -House ramen:  came out last.  I was so full by then.  But it was good, not salty, cooked well.  But the fish ball was too fishy (and I'm southeast asian).  There was the redundant pork belly in it, which was described differently but the same as the crispy pork dish we had earlier.  And had the same poached egg in it.  i wish she wouldn't have recommended the crispy pork dish or the ramen dish when she knew they had the same ingredients in it It was way too much food!!!!  But we ate it all.... I was disappointed with the timing of the food.  We waited for a long time.  We didn't get to enjoy multiple dishes together like other tables did.  We sat munching on the eggplant for a long while before the next dish.  It would have been nice to have some protein around.   One of the great things???  Filled out water glasses efficiently.  Cute atmosphere.  Very striking from the outside.  Fun murals on the ceilings.  Intimate.  The back room had more communal seating.  And the music?  Totally my taste.  John Legend, Tribe called quest, the roots, The temptations....  i was boppin my head while I was eating.  I wanted to stay in the restroom as a midnight marauders track came on.

We started with some tea.  Uh, don't get the tea. It was 8 dollars and not worth it.  I've had super expensive Japanese tea and this was not worth the large amount (we even split it so it was 4 dollars each but still). NEXT... hamachi kama.  Delicious hamachi with bone marrow.  This stuff was the bomb.  We also got Saba (yum), eggplant (one of my least favorites, but still ok), skewers (nothing special), the blue crab and lobster congee (AWESOME!!!!!!!!), the oyster mushroom dish (OH YEAHHH!!!!), Sweet potato fries (the most filling thing we got, and way more delicious than your ave.

So basically, we're all done, and afraid to see the bill thinking it'd be a ton of money since we got so many dishes, tea, and this place wasn't cheap. 35 bucks each!  Not bad, in my opinion, for getting to try SO many things... for real.

It was sort of busy when we went in and our table had the ""better"" seating area in the back near the kitchen. I LOVED the ambiance and the good music. I liked how it was dark and intimate. It was cozy and cute. But...I was truly disappointed in the food. Between my boyfriend and I, we had the Japanese Sweet Potato Fries, the Gyozas, the House Ramen, and two Kiuchi beers. I liked the Japanese fries, tasty but nothing special. The Gyozas tasted like microwaved instant gyozas you can get from the Asian mart and it was super soggy. The House Ramen was overcooked and tasteless, I am pretty sure my instant noodles from the grocery store tastes better. I did really like my Kiuchi beer though, light and easy to drink. Our bill for the two appetizers, one entree, and two beers was about $46 dollars (including tip) which is kind of pricey since the dishes were not big. I wish I could give it 2.5 stars since I really did enjoy the environment and nice beats. So in the end, I may not be coming back, UNLESS I have the change of heart to give it another try.

2010-09-17,5.0,"Please come here!!  I live in west Lakeview and this is the only interesting restaurant that has opened in god knows how long.  Now, compared to what I would normally give 5 stars, it probably falls a little short (it's more like 4 stars) but I want this place to stay open so for the concept of it, the great service, and the overall bang for buck so let's go for 5 stars. Drinks - Sochu cocktails - Interesting and tasty but a tad on the sweet side. Beers - great selection, Hitachino White Nest on tap, yay!  Sake - big selection, same with Japanese whiskeys. Food - anything with Hamachi, get it.  We tried 3 kinds, and the one with bone marrow was mm mm yum.  The Kuchi (sp? stuff on skewers) were all very good, especially the octopus and the beef cheeks.  A pickled daikon salad was so refreshing.  The corn fritters were to die for.  We ordered it 3 times.  Soba was on the salty side for me, everybody else liked it.  The ramen was just OK. (Any type of noodles in soup are my ultimate comfort food and so I have very high expectations.)  But puffed pig ears, blackened edamame, daily dumpling, sesame string beans, and more were all yesses! Dessert - we were there for almost 4 hours and ordered a TON of food, consequently were almost too full for dessert.  Almost.  But the 6 of us shared one rice pudding, and it was the perfect bite to end the meal.  Great flavor and texture, perfect degree of sweetness.  It's rare to get a good dessert at an Asian restaurant so way to go Chizakaya! Atmosphere - terrific!  Great crowd, fun decor and the music could've been from my iPod!  Also check out the great back room -- open to the kitchen, with a nice big communal table.",0.9985,0.712,0.274,0.015,0.5501666666666667
2010-09-17,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place but it just disappointed.  It's been a long time since I've been this disappointed by a restaurant.  Here's what I ordered: - Sapporo on draft.  Can't beat the price at $4.   - Chicken gizzard skewers and chicken meatball skewers.  The flavors were okay.  Chicken meatballs fell apart and were nothing to write home about.  -Hamachi Kama - collarbone of the hamachi.  Can't mess up here and cooked to perfection.  Best thing we ordered. -Mushroom combo - ehh.  Displayed on a banana leaf (i think).  They should have steamed it in the leaf if they were going to display it.  Oily and flavored with lemon and soy.    -House Ramen- Now this is where this restaurant deserves no stars.  Noodles were overcooked and fell apart on contact.  Broth was watered down and had no essence of a good stock.  Pork belly was pan fried and dumped in the soup.  Ramen pork belly should be braised to perfection.  I believe they called this the house special.  If their specialty is this, prepare for failure.   Ultimately, I am disappointed with this restaurant.  When I went there, the customers were mostly friends and family because it's relatively new.  My review is based on the honest truth with no strings attached.  Take what you will from the other reviews.",0.9312,0.727,0.161,0.112,0.5613085744664692
2010-09-15,5.0,"Having just moved to Chicago from Miami, I must say that this city is far better of a food & service city than Miami will ever be. Taking a walk around my new neighborhood, I found Chizakaya and I am glad I did!  The decor is spot on, and so is the staff. Everyone so nice and welcoming, it makes you feel comfortable right from the start. I recommend ordering the ""Lie & Cheat"" cocktail, if light & fruity drinks are you kind of thing. The chicken meatballs are amazing, so are the pork meatballs. I had a miso soup which was also great, along with steak on a skewer & wasabi on top of it. I don't eat sushi so I was totally in love with all the cooked food on the menu.  Overall, this is a great little place that serves its portions on the smaller side, so don't come here expecting a big platter kind of dishes. If your looking to have some great drinks (along with Sake & an interesting beer selection) and a couple of small platters to share with friends, this place is definitely worth checking out.

2010-09-15,5.0,"This is probably some of the best Japanese food in/around Chicago, which is high praise. This is what I would call ""Japanese Tapas."" That is, a party of two will typically order 4-8 dishes, some of which are somewhat filling (e.g., clams, walleye, eggplant, crispy chicken thighs) others of which are more like tastings (e.g. pig ears, skewers, himachi w/bone marrow). Dishes typically go for about $5-8 each, but range between $3-15 (approx.). MUSHROOMS! If/when you go you MUST get the ""King oyster..."" dish which is a substantial helping of (primarily) oyster mushrooms with lemon butter and some soy. It is absolutely amazing. Also of note was the ""crispy pork"" dish, which was actually pork belly suspended above a poached egg in a ponzu sauce. The himachi with bone marrow was also delectable and the pig ears were a nice crispy, salty snack. I can honestly say that, after ordering a wide range of dishes (octopus, beef cheek, pig ears), my guests and I did not regret a single thing. As a result, I recommend ordering outside of your comfort zone (chicken and beef livers are on the menu, as are chicken gizzards--you get the idea). In terms of booze, they have a pretty extensive wine, sake, beer, cocktail, and liquor (mostly/maybe all whiskey).  All told, this is a must-try--a few times over.",0.9914,0.793,0.19,0.017,0.49034632034632036

2010-09-12,4.0,"wow, i can't believe how much food and drinks we ordered the other night at Chizakaya but the menu really looked interesting and we felt that we simply had to try everything... so here is what we had: foodwise: black edamame (not really black in color but it matured on the vines longer, giving it a more nutty taste), puffed pig ears (crispy and tastier than the pork rinds at publican), crispy pork with slow poached egg (not really crispy but tasted good, esp with the egg yolk, we drank the sauce), hamachi with bone marrow (fish is very fresh, bone marrow was creamy but i am not that's my fav dish though), beef liver sashimi (i love it, its livery tasting and tangy at the same time), chicken gizzard kushi (tasty), chicken skin kushi (i prefer salt grilled so this is a bit sweet for me), hakurei turnips (very earthy, yummy), beef cheek (tender), beef tongue (good but i like katsu's version more), blue crab congee (tasted good but looks more like a risotto than congee), chawan mushi with foie gras (earthy, foie gras tasted great but the eggs needed a bit more salt), clams with beer (clams are fresh but i think the beer was too dark and the taste overwhelmed the delicate clams), roasted chicken liver (i loved it but my dinner companion thought it was a bit overcooked), taro ube rice pudding (tasted great but the rice needed a longer cooking time) drinkwise: lie and cheat (awesome), shiso mojito (too sweet), chu hai (tasted like vodka soda) and different kinds of sakes (forgot which ones we tried but they do have a good variety of choices) definitely a good addition to chicago esp with masu izakaya gone",0.9967,0.763,0.216,0.021,0.5601029601029602
2010-09-12,4.0,"The history of izakayas in Chicago is not one of great success. When my wife and I went to Shochu awhile back (where Deleece currently resides on Clark), it was a forgettable experience. We'll see if that changes with the opening of Chizakaya. After reading stellar reviews for this place from people whose palate I trust (Achatz, anyone?), we took a walk down Wellington for a late dinner. The team behind Chizakaya is in itself impressive. Between the chef/owner and the chef de cuisine, stints at Chicago locales alone such as Charlie Trotters, Japonais, Sunda, and L2O speak to the reputation that precedes their opening of Chizakaya. The menu consists of Japanese small plates, so my wife and I shared the teriyaki string beans with sesame seeds, the crispy pork with slow poached egg, the cold soba with summer vegetables and shrimp tempura, the walleye infused with ginger and scallions, the blue crab congee with corn and chives, the corn fritters with chili, lime, and mayo, and a skewer of beef sirloin tips topped with wasabi and lime. Of the seven plates, only the walleye and the crispy pork left us wanting more, and even so, they were plenty satisfying.  The menu is not comparable to your run of the mill Japanese restaurant, though I overheard the drink menu was created by Chantelle Pabros (former L2O sommelier).  There are several items on the menu I'll be anxious to try on my next visit- notably the hamachi/bone marrow and the king oyster with shimji mushrooms, soy, and lemon butter.",0.8861,0.906,0.067,0.027,0.4188034188034188
2010-09-11,5.0,"Let's be clear about one thing, Yelpers.  Just because I like Japanese food doesn't mean I like Japanese people.  Ever since they declared independence from England in 1997, I refuse to go to their country.  Now Tokyo on the other hand is an amazing country that I visit all the time.  But I wasn't in the mood for Chinese food last weekend... I was in the mood for authentic Japanese. I found Chizakaya by accident.  I saw four pretty Japanese girls standing outside a building, and since my body naturally gravitulates towards other ethnic minorities I uncontrollably was ushered into this trendy Japanese pub.  And that was fine, since I was in the mood for some raw fish and sake. Do I even know what I ate?  Does Martha Stewart know how much money is in her bank account?  No, so why are you bothering me to review food?  I'll tell you what was excellent though (all that I remember before I got drunk on the sake): the little chicken meatballs and chicken skins are superb, and so were the chicken livers and the pork meatball thingies.  I also liked the foie gras soup thing, although it was a small portion.  All the portions are small, which is great for me.  You don't keep a 27-waist by eating at Outback Steakhouse every day.  Do ya Paris? Best of all was the service at Chizakaya.  So many friendly staffers came up to talk to me, and it wasn't just because I'm stunningly beautiful.  The manager even brought me a complimentary little bottle of hot sake.  A restaurant that doesn't flag me after 3 drinks, and actually encourages me to drink more?  This Japanese pub has no idea what they're in for... If you're looking for a cute spot in Lakeview for small plates and pre-""going out"" drinks, then this is it.  The beer selection is eclectic, and the food is unique and well-done.  And the boss of this place is some Japanese woman with fierce heels, so that just makes my life complete.  Had she smashed a bottle of hot sake over my head and told me to kiss her Christian Louboutins, I would've still given this place 5 stars.  Especially for that cute Japanese male chef... hEllO. But that's right, all you horny middle-aged men with a Japanese dominatrix fetish, this is your hang-out.  But don't tell the folks at Chizakaya that I said that.  I don't want to jeopardize my free sake shots... Anisha A.: The words in your review were way too big.  I can't understand it.  Can you like, post a dumbed-down review for me?  Or bullet points? Oh, and FYI yelpers, Chizakaya has a very cool ambience.  If I knew what that word meant, I would explain further.  Since I don't, I'm just going to repeat myself and use it in a new sentence.  The ambience at Chizakaya is really amazing.  It could be a set in a Kill Bill movie... only I'd be Uma Thurman, and Bill would be Jean Georges or Nobu Matsuhisa.

2010-09-10,3.0,"Mammoth Japanese comic murals make for more tasteful ceiling décor then mirrors. Hence, score one for Chizakaya- a laid back surprise on Lincoln. The waitress diffused our incessant questions to give on-point recommendations for shochus (the barley one goes down a little too easy) and sakes (the 'milky and refined' one has a depraved charisma, channeling Malcolm McDowell's earlier work). Too bad the pours were unequivocally paltry. We signaled to the ceiling superheroes to swoop in and top off our glasses, but those lazy asses stayed put. The menu has moments of intrigue- the hamachi with bone marrow, the crispy pork with slow poached egg, the blue crab congee and the clams in beer broth- all come close to singing. The string beans are lackluster, and the snapper is overly oiled and acidic.  There's practically a mandate on sharing, so ditch the dining buddies with cold sores.  And, beware, you can easily run up quite a bill with drinks, and the snack-sized portions.  Regardless of its imperfections, the place is so damn affable, it almost doesn't matter.",-0.2915,0.885,0.06,0.055,0.5388888888888889
2010-09-08,5.0,"Right after landing in Chicago, we decided to dine at Chizakaya for a small snack and a few drinks. Much to my surprise, I was fairly pleased with the extensive food menu and the awesome drinks. I focused mainly on the cocktails so I can't say much about the sake and whiskey list.  Came in around 9pm and for a party of 2 we were seated promptly. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. The decor of this place is very modern -- dim lighting, beautifully painted murals on the wall and the decorations are nice and simple.  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… Here's what we ordered: HAMACHI KAMA --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… This is a must get. It's seasoned really well and cooked to perfection! Hopefully this dish doesn't sell out on you because we were able to snag the last one! HAMACHI W/ BONE MARROW --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… I usually don't like bone marrow because it's gooey and lacks flavor but the bone marrow paired w/ the hamachi is a very ingenious idea. There are bits of fried garlic on the dish too so you must enjoy it with a piece of fried garlic! TAI SNAPPER --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… I love avocados and I love raw fish so if you put them together, I'll be one happy camper. Despite the fact that this dish was a bit on the vinegary side, all the flavors worked well together.  AGEDASHI TOFU --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… This was the only dish I didn't like. Agedashi tofu is supposed to be soft, but this was a bit on the firmer side. The sauce was a bit bland too but perhaps this is another way of preparing agedashi tofu that I'm not aware of...? SHISO MOJITO --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… Shiso leaves instead of mint leaves? Love the idea. This mojito was on the sweeter side in my opinion so for those who like mojitos and/or sweet cocktails, this ones for you. LYCHEE COCKTAIL --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… Thumbs up! The consistency was thicker than the rest of the cocktails but for those who are lychee fans, don't miss out on this drink.  GREEN TEA COCKTAIL --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… A bit mild on the flavor but you can definitely taste the matcha in your drink. I think this was my favorite cocktail.  UME COCKTAIL --  media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bp… For some reason, this drink tasted like a margarita to me. I don't know how a Japanese sweet plum drink can translate into a margarita. It wasn't bad though. The server said it was her favorite.  All in all, I would come here if you're looking for a rather inexpensive meal. For 2, we were able to fill ourselves and get a bit tipsy for roughly $80. There's a back area that can seat a big party -- I believe 20 people so keep this location in mind if you're out looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion! I would come here again for some good Japanese pub style food (think Japanese tapas). Plus, you can't go wrong with really tasty cocktails!",0.9983,0.796,0.186,0.017,0.5052122387416504
