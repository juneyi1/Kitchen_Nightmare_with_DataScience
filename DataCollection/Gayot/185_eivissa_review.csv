2010-05-06,2.0,"This review is a little late, but I thought I would throw my experience out there anyways. I went to this place last October. I believe it had been only open maybe a week or so. A friend was visiting from CA and wanted to try out a one of the new Chicago restaurants. She had read about Eivissa and suggested it for a quick dinner.  We went on a Monday night. The place was not crowded at all, but it wasn't empty. We sat towards the back and there were about 3 other tables (two small w/ about 2-3 people and one with about 5). We decided to try the pintxos (appetizers) combination plate which was half-off that night. We had the ""entrecote, cabrales, aioli"", ""asparagus, marcona almonds, aioli"" and ""pork loin, cebolla, riojana salsa"". Each item was on a small toasted bread. They were good. I would recommend trying all three items, but not for sharing since they are small portions. The combination plate was priced to my expectation. We wound up ordering a magrana (half-off that evening) and a pumpkin spice sangria. The magrana was just OK. The pumpkin spice sangria was a risk. Unfortunately, it was a bad risk. It was sweet and had an aftertaste of cough syrup. We shared ""patatas al aioli"" (cold tapas) and ""solomillo cabrales"" (hot tapas). Both were very good. I would definitely recommend both. The food overall was quite good. However, the service was extremely slow. All the employees were very nice and courteous, but considering the number of diners at the time, they could have been more attentive. We sat there for a while before our drink order was taken. We had another wait for the food to come out. If you factor in the the time it took to come out, what we had ordered and how not busy they were, it was really slow service. I chalked it all up to just being a new restaurant and having the need to iron out the intial kinks. Based on some of the recent reviews, it doesn't sound like they have done much to improve service. The food was good & the staff was very nice (just slow service). I may give this place another shot, but maybe on a weeknight again in case service is slow.",0.9932,0.807,0.149,0.045,0.5396775446775445

Would recommend the dates, the empanada de carne, and the grilled beef tenderloin served with potatoes. On another note, our waitress couldn't have possibly been less interested in performing her job that evening. Made for a long dinner, but hey, we had nowhere to go I guess. The restaurant was also extremely warm in temperature, made the long meal a lot uncomfortable. Oh, and when we got there, they informed us that it was cash only, as their cc machine was broken...

2010-03-07,4.0,"I had never had tapas before, so I was eager to try Eivissa one Saturday night at the suggestion of Ginger D along with Howie M.  I love tapas! I discovered my love for aioli sauce (yummyful), my favorite dishes were their patatas bravas, tortilla de espinaca and manchego (a yummy flat bread). Howie M. thought his sangria was some of the best he had tasted, the fruit was fresh and crisp, as if they had sliced it for that particular glass. My two friends split the catalana paella, which was supposedly for two, but looked to be enough for four persons. Yes, yes I ordered the flan because I love flan but never seem to run into it on my restaurant adventures- the portion was small for $7 but I acknowledge that I am a US American who is used to gigantic everything. The atmosphere of Eivissa is quite sexy- perfect date place with lots of red/brown, low lighting, vases of faux flowers and chic silverware. Our service was good, not great, but commendable. Granted, this place is not cheap, I would consider it a ""special occasion experience', once every couple of months, but I would recommend it to others looking for tapas in Chicago.",0.994,0.722,0.248,0.03,0.5419172932330827

The food was also outstanding.  The dates wrapped in bacon, stuffed with almonds are a hands down favorite, but we have tried a number of other dishes and all were spot on.  Some interesting and welcome twists on traditional favorites.   I also really enjoyed the atmosphere both times.  The exposed brick is warm and inviting, the giant mirror hanging over the bar is a nice touch and great for inconspicuous people watching.  The upstairs has an intimate laid back feel.

I'd say that this was one of those times. Service was attentive - in fact, they got a little overeager with the plate clearing, but that's not the worst thing in the world. they never tried to take away a half-full plate or anything - they were always just right there to take away empty plates as we devoured our food.

SERVICE - we were initially seated in a strange location...the absolute corner of the restaurant and super close to the adjancent table. We requested to be moved to a high table near the entrance. Also, we had not one, not two, but a series of three to four people waiting on our table through the night...the hostess, the manager, the dude who took our order, and a bus boy--a little strange if you ask me. 2.) MENU/FOOD - while the menu boasted some interesting  choices, we found only a few of them to be well-executed. The rack of lamb and braised artichokes were nice while others were nothing special. We were so excited about the Sangria we ordered but it came out with too little fruit and too much ice. For dessert, the hostess recommended we try the homemade churros with chocolate ganache.

2009-10-11,2.0,"I wanted to like Eivissa, I really did.  It's an attractive and colorful venue in a convenient location, and I appreciated being able to make a reservation online via Open Table.  We were greeted quickly by a friendly hostess, who had our reservation.  A server came to our table quickly and explained the variety of sangrias to us.  We chose the peach sangria (made with white wine and flavored with a peach  liqueur.  It tasted good, and at $18 for a pitcher with at least 6 glasses seemed a bargain.  From that point the experience went downhill.  Eivissa wants to be a fun destination location and therefore plays super-loud music; everybody in the restaurant is also trying to have a conversation and are having to shout at each other to do so.  This makes for a very noisy setting.  The menu has a bit of a basque flavor to it.  Intrigued by this, we stayed away from the classical tapas on the menu, which may have been a mistake.  The beet salad was delicious, and an interesting mix of flavors, including fresh pineapple.  The bacon-wrapped dates were also a success.  Empanadas (not commonly found in Spain) were a miss - pastry was overcooked, filling didn't have much taste, and the sauce had no discernible taste.  A crab- and tuna-stuffed cannelon that supposedly was a cold tapa was actually served warm -- the pasta was thick, there was not even the hint of crab, and again the sauce was tasteless.  The gazpacho was excellent, served with a few crispy, garlic croutons.  Tapas come with bread - they are eaten with bread - and we had to ask for it.  (When it came it was good.)  We also ordered paella which at the last minute we realized was priced on a per-person basis -- so we ended up with too much at too high a price.  The paella itself was just OK - rice was more like risotto (which might be because they are using the wrong kind of rice, or because they overcooked it and the rice exploded).  For dessert we had arroz con leche (rice pudding) which was served warm and was quite tasty -- though it was a bit of a surprise to bite into a large piece of orange peel and a large hunk of cinnammon.  All of the above came to right at $100 including tax, about double what it would have been at Cafe Iberico, where the food is consistently good.  Service was so-so.  Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu but seemed very rushed (the restaurant was quite busy).  The 2-top table was too small for even four tapas dishes plus our two salad-sized plates.  Adding the paella pan would have been impossible, so we had to prematurely scrape some of the tapas onto our plates  Verdict:  If you want a bar-like atmosphere to have a few drinks and a bit to eat, this is probably a worthwhile stop.  If you want really good tapas, good service, and the ability to have a conversation this is not your place.",0.987,0.869,0.109,0.021,0.4495100732600733

Fast forward to 9/5/09. I came in for a late dinner with a small group of girlfriends. We rode in on champagne and second city fueled happiness ready to continue a great night.  All seemed well. Eivissa was quite sexy. Loud but sexy.  And then we were seated. Too close to the kitchen and near the most obnoxious bunch of people I've ever come across. The tapas all sounded great but to make things easier we all decided to order our own selections and share as desired (due to dietary restrictions, etc). Our waitress showed up and although we made it clear that the 8 of us were going to order multiple items each she didn't feel the need to write anything down. Even after she tried repeating the order and got it wrong we urged her to please write it down. She refused and it was then that the evening went to hell.  The sangria she suggested( and dared call awesome) was not even sangria and more like cheap red table wine with fruit chunks. The tapas started coming out and the servers didn't know what it was they were bringing out. This was a problem because as I mentioned we had some dietary restrictions and that is the main reason we ordered individually. After finally figuring out what things were we were still missing a ton and when our waitress finally came back to check on us we let her know how much was missing. I saw her go over and put the order in which means she forgot the first time.  I could go on about the poor service but I think you get the point. The manager stopped by our table and I had to be honest with him. I could tell that he was very sorry and embarrassed. He comped our entire bill and gave us his card to contact him on our next visit.

In terms of drinks (on Saturdays the sangria is 1/2 off) - the magrana sangria was the best one ... didn't taste watered down like the pressec or the nabiu.  The martinis were decent but not all that.

With that said, I will echo the other sentiments here by saying that you do get a much better deal at other tapas joints.  It was just the two of us, and we each ordered a glass of sangria (muy bueno and affordable at about $6-7 per glass) and about seven to eight dishes, but it barely fed the two of us.  Usually tapas plates will cover about 4 and up to 6 peeps, but these tapas plates (granted, they were the small size) could only feed 2 people, and for the same price elsewhere you can usually get more bang for your buck. As far as the food quality, I can't say that any dish was particularly memorable.  The mini empanadas (they were tiny -- the size of a pinky and there were 3 of them for 7 or 8 bux) were good, but the croquetas were very salty and dry.  I personally thought the churros were kind of too heavy... not like fried dough really... they were made with too much flour in a bread-like sense, and the chocolate sauce was too thick and light on chocolate flavor.  I've had authentically made, high quality churros... and the chocolate dipping sauce has to be more akin to a very rich, dark hot chocolate drink.  The chocolate sauce here was more like a custard pudding. This is a fun place to drop by if you're in the Old Town area for a glass of sangria and a couple of mediocre tapas with friends (make sure to order the large sizes for up to 4 peeps), but not for serious eating.

Lovely ladies with pitchers of sangria and martinis and other tropical drinks are all around here. Men smiling and laughing and everyone having a good time. Good signs, yes? Hmmm slightly deceiving in my opinion. No, not that they aren't having a good time, just will I?  The inside is woodsy, in the tropical sense, floor, walls, stone, it really is a pretty good looking space, but quite loud. In fact quite I am yelling at you while you are three feet away from me, loud. The drink list is long. Plenty for everyone. Good amount of wines, tropical, various and colorful. In fact it feels like the number of drinks out number the number of food dishes two to one. I think that is and will be the big draw here, the drinks. No one at our table had a bad drink. No one had one that said, ""Mmmm this is crap."" ""Wow, this sucks."" Now to get one of those drinks... well... I do have to say our service at the start was great. Very attentive and making sure we were enjoying everything. Always smiling, very friendly... and then it got busy and we saw our waitress, I tried flagging her down three or four times and was denied. Its okay. I really didn't want another glass that badly.  What I did want, was some better food. Tapas can be a hit or miss. We got some of the basics and I'd be scared to have anything beyond them here, because the basics were meh... okay. The sausages were great, no denying that fact, the empanadas were okay, though a little too flaky and with no bold flavors. In fact most dishes felt like they lacked any punch, pizazz, that bold hit of flavors that I think of with tapas. It feels like so much of what was missing was just that, no hit of flavor, no real seasoning, so much was done with sauces and not the actual item. The chicken was okay but better with the sauce, I hoped not to get an aioli free one. The potatoes brava was good, but missing something, the flatbread was, well flat.  We had a good time because we were all in good company, many good friends and new ones surrounding each other, smiling, laughing and imbibing a bit, sharing stories and that made this night more fun. I hope they can work on the menu a bit, through some unique excitement in to it. I looked at the rest of the menu and really, not much made me want to jump back here. For drinks and some good friends, I'd return, for good tapas, I'd probably look else where.",0.9986,0.68,0.238,0.083,0.5263408735239723
2009-07-10,3.0,I have dined at Eivissa twice since it opened. I live in the neighborhood so I am always thrilled when a new restaurant opens in the area.  While the food is good not great I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood.  The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is festive.  We went there to celebrate a friend's engagement and it was perfect.   If I didn't live in the area I am not sure I would be trekking in from afar to dine here but I am sure given my proximity I will go back.  I thought the cheese plate was excellent along with the grilled octupus and endive salad.  The highlight of the menu (beyond the sangria) is without a doubt the roasted chicken with bosc pear.  I do not usually order chicken but it was fantastic and a favorite of the table.   The other thing that is worth mentioning is the attentiveness of the staff.  I am not sure whether it was my heels or if the floor was slippery but I managed to fall (basically into the splits) walking thru dining room. It was almost embarassing how worried they were about me and to top it off they also took care of half of our bill.  I was very impressed that without even asking or complaining they did the right thing.,0.9857,0.753,0.186,0.062,0.6571437229437229

The service was very good - we didn't have reservations and they set us up within 10 minutes outside as requested, and it was pretty busy.  Our server was wonderful!  She was pleasant and quick with the food and our drink orders.  Definitely a plus for the place.

The prices did not seem as crazy as some make them out to be. The sangria is $6 per glass which is no any more expensive than most other Spanish restaurants. The tapas go from $5 to $9 for most which is also in line with other restaurants. The service was a little weak. The food was...meh. It started well with the mushroom pinxto which was really good. Aside from that, the sausages were good, but hard to screw that up. The goat cheese was a special and it was below mediocre. The pimiento salad was boring. The pork medallions kind of tasteless. Had the sangria sorbet for dessert and must say that was pretty good. I was not a big fan of the layout or the decor either. All in all, this place fell short of expectations.

You'll be there for 2+ hours, at the very least. I saw a lot of servers, but not the best service. I believe the owner was there, busing tables, talking to customers, and overseeing the operations.  Our waiter went over their 'unique' menu, but basically just reiterated what was written in the description.  A lot of seafood options and specialty drinks.  We had 5 or 6 small plates, including cheese, and we never got completely full.  Like the other reviews, minuscule pieces of bread with the cheese platter. It got 2 stars for the pitchers of Sangria and our dessert of mini churro's served with a bowl of melted milk chocolate and a dollop (yeah I said a dollop) of vanilla ice cream.  Oh and the chef sent over a small plate for us to try, which was pretty good, and free!

It's visually appealing and a nice interior space, but the service needs a TON of work.  I arrived and saw an empty table near the bar that still had empty glasses from the previous diners. I asked if it was open seating in the bar and got a different answer depending on who I asked. The hostess said it was fine to sit there, but it took another 10 minutes to get the dishes cleared.  Our server was sporadic at best. She came over the moment my friend arrived to take our order without giving her a second to look at the menu. So we asked for a few minutes. 20 minutes later (which I'm pretty sure is more than a few minutes) the server came back to take our order. The sangria was marginal at best, and each round we had (of the same flavor) came out different. Not a little different. Then when we tried to pay the bill and get outta there, the server disappeared again and I had to take the bill to the hostess to pay.  We didn't have any food, so I have no idea what that's like.

How about that they lost my reservation for Saturday night for my friend's birthday?  When we arrived I was told that the reservation had been canceled however they did accommodate our party of 10 in short order so no harm no foul there. Mostly just confused.  However when seated it wasn't clear who our server was as one guy was taking our drink  orders (but not really listening) then passing them to another server who in turn had to come over and ask what we ordered again. And then got the drinks wrong, more then once. However she was nice and definitely trying but under-trained and perhaps inexperienced.  Speaking of the first server, perhaps not the best idea to twirl across the dining room with two glasses of red wine on your tray. Yeah, you read right, twirled, through the dining room. With two glasses of red wine on the tray. Hey buddy, flying red wine and stains do not happy customers make. These things might have been overlooked (ok, not the twirling server) if the food was any good at all. It just plain wasn't. And the portions were ridiculously small. Even for tapas. I was starving when we left but we just wanted to get out of there.  And the prices weren't much better. The piquillo relleno turned out to be not only tasteless but closer to an amuse-bouche then tapas (although there was nothing delightful or amusing about it) And at $8 bucks a pop it pretty much blew. Oh, not to mention it looked like, well just not an attractive presentation; not even a little. But let's talk paella. At $64 bucks for a 4 person serving I expect to be blown away. I'm talking mouth dancing, feet tapping, loving life sorta way. It might have been one of the worst things we had. We tried the catalana paella which was supposed to be a mix of  pork, monkfish, shellfish and octopus. I had a random piece of mushy fish and a piece of pork with the bone still in. The rice was crunchy as it was seriously underdone.  We had a few other random things hardly even worth mentioning. Asparagus with red form-whatever. Croquettes of some sort-whatever.  And again our server was nice but the service was slow and she wasn't getting much back up.  On a good note after a completely underwhelming and disappointing experience we did talk to the manager and had some items removed from our total bill. Along with a sincere apology from our waitress. But she wasn't responsible for what was coming out of the kitchen. Or for the twirling server. However that's the ONLY reason I'm giving it two stars. Otherwise it would be a one.

2009-06-08,1.0,"Overpriced and underfooded. I would actually give this new tapas restaurant 1.5 stars and the only redeeming part would be the sangria and the decor. I went there with a party of 5, as at most tapas restaurants, that would be an adequate number to share with. Well, not at Eivissa... each tapas served about 2 people. Not only are the portions tiny, but they are also hard to share. I thought the whole point of tapas was that they are meant to be shared. Here, it was not sharing-friendly. Basically, each person would get 1 small bite, at most. We did try the pinxtos, that is probably meant for 1 person, being one small slice of bread with toppings. But for $5 a slice, it just wasn't worth it! We tried about 10 different tapas, plus paella, and we left starving. (This was the typical amount that we would order at any other tapas place.) And we spent about $45/person w/drinks, which you would be plenty full and buzzed with at Iberico or Ba-ba-reeba. Plus, all the food was just mediocre. Nothing stood out as being extraordinary in flavor. As I mentioned before, the only thing that stood out that we all liked was the amnesia sangria. VERY tasty!! I would ONLY go back there for drinks.   I will have to say that the space is cool. They converted the old Hong Kong Bay space into a really trendy atmosphere. The upstairs is beautifully decorated. However, I will have to say that it is super loud in there. You basically have to shout at your dining companions. Again, I would hesitate to go back. If anything, only for the yummy sangria. I think that the owners should re-think their concept if they want to last awhile. You can only be trendy and new for so long. Especially in this economy, people want to eat good food in a fun atmosphere, but also don't want to feel like they were ripped off.

2009-06-01,4.0,"Checked out the newest addition to the Old Town lineup this past Friday night. If you like tapas and interesting drinks- Eivissa may be your new favorite place. Eivissa is named after a town on Ibiza  (a Spanish island with ruins southwest of Majorca) and did a nice job of making me think I was in my favorite little restaurant in Spain.  First of all the ambiance. Eivissa's contemporary environment spans two floors. On the entry level- is the bar area with exposed brick walls, cool lights hanging over the bar and some seating in the back. The place was loud, packed and had a really good energy about it.  We were seated upstairs in a similarly decorated room although the noise level was much more conducive to dining. There is also a bar on the 2nd level where you can wait for your table.  Our server was great! (Thanks Miriam. All of your suggestions were spot on!) She came up and immediately got us going with some fancy cocktails (I had something with plum vodka and cranberry juice that was garnished with Majorca edible pearls) Odd but tasty! She actually warned us off of one drink as it had so much alcohol in it- it comes with a limit right on the menu!  We started with a meat and cheese course with some of the best Serrano ham and manchego cheese I have had since I was in Barcelona, Very good. Next up- grilled octopus in a spicy sauce. I only wish that it had come with some bread to sop of that sauce. We then shared a piece crunchy bread topped with herbed cream cheese, tomatoes and sardines. Sounds like a crazy combo but it was delicious!  Finally- our paella arrived. Wonderful aroma- we had gone with the seafood version which had shrimp, mussels, and clams mixed with peppers and rice. Very good and just the right amount for 2.  While the bar had a couple of issues with making the drinks- our table service was top notch, and the owner came over to greet us and it was a great evening overall. Dinner for two with drinks and dessert came to about $100 which didn't break the bank either.  Outdoor seating will be available in about two weeks as they wait for their permit from the city. If you are looking for a little touch of Spain right in the neighborhood- give Eivissa a try. I need to go back just to try a couple of the other specialty cocktails on their list and to try some more of their unique tapas.",0.9949,0.84,0.137,0.023,0.493406267645398

2009-05-31,2.0,"Nothing to write home about. It was loud and crowded, bad layout for traffic on the first floor. We were excited and had high hopes as we read a few reviews on MetroMix about this place. I'm thinking the staff wrote the reviews because this place was overpriced and gnarly. Thought it was rather expensive for the portions we received and I couldn't get over the glitter all over our waitresses face (hope I didn't ingest any). My friend who is a very light eater even proclaimed ""I feel like I should be more full for what we just paid."" I understand the concept of tapas and have been to numerous places around the city, but these were very small. Diet tapas, if you will. Don't expect the traditional bread with olive oil to start you off, that will set you back $1 for 4 pewny slices, I've seen salad croutons bigger than these. It was almost a joke that they made you pay for the bread, let alone, how small it was. We got the Magrana Sangria, which tasted like regular ol' sangria. My friend ordered the Cillario cocktail, which tasted like concentrated sun tanning lotion. The tapas staples, gambas al ajillo  and the pulpo were ok. The Gambas could have used a little more of a charred taste. It seemed as though the boiled their shrimp and slathered it in butter, but lacked a garlicky taste. The pulpo was edible but I wasn't wowed by it by any means. We ordered the escargot (caracoles) and they tasted like dirt, literally. I've had my share of escargot, but nothing this horrific. It smelled like wet rags. When we spoke to whom we assumed was a manger of some sort (or may be he was playing secret service agent with his little ear piece) he said it was suppose to be ""earthy,""  It was just plain dirt.  We ordered seafood pinxtos (salpicon aioli) which was one piece and had to divide it between 3 people which was tedious and messy. It lacked flavor and tasted mostly of red pepper. Skip the calamari and the piquillo relleno. We were grossed out by the presentation which resembled an O'Keefe painting (we used other words to describe what it looked like but I don't think it would be appropriate to quote what we used to describe these dishes), especially with all the oozing that came out of the opening. The piqullo relleno was $8 and was basically one bite. I'm definitely not going back.

2009-05-31,1.0,"""Think El Bulli, but not as intimidating."" That's how Eivissa partner Joe Alcantar described the new restaurant in the May 28 issue of Time Out Chicago. I think Eivissa needs to stop worrying about how it compares with El Bulli and try to at least compete with Emilio's and other local mid-range tapas offerings. High-end this is not, at least not yet. Let's start with the space. It's gorgeous. One can tell immediately why Eivissa was under construction for what seemed like a millennia. The crowded bar on the first floor looked like a great place to have a drink, and a young and vibrant (read: loud) Old Town crowd filled the cavernous space. The colors and lighting fixtures complement each other well, but I wasn't a fan of the Cheesecake Factory-like vinyl banquette that ran along each wall. Our bespeckled, tattooed server was friendly and helpful. Our cocktails - a ""foam party"" of foam-topped spicy red sangria and a ""coco pearl"" martini-like drink with floating juice pearls - were decent. Unlike the Metromix reviewer, I didn't think I had enough foam in my party, so I asked for more. Our server really got a kick out of this, saying that the manager went over the Metromix review with the staff and gave strict instructions to cut out the offers of more foam. Tamara's pearl cocktail looked like a cheap knockoff of a superior cocktail she had a Moto - one that had more and smaller pearls without the overly sweet flavor. While showing some signs of brilliance, the food was an unfortunate disappointment.  We started with the piquillo relleno txanguro - a chile stuffed with crab and scallion cream resting on a ""lobster lake."" I read about this in Metromix as well and liked the thought of a frozen disc of lobster bisque - it sounded interesting and original. But the stuffing tasted fishy and barely contained any crab, mostly just mayonnaise. And I don't know if Eivissa changed its recipe because of the Metromix review, but my ""lake of lobster"" was definitely not frozen - instead, it was a room-temperature pool of what I thought was olive oil - definitely no lobster flavor at all. The coca manchego - flatbread topped with caramelized onion, roasted pepper and manchego cheese - was the standout dish of the evening. But honestly, it's quite hard to screw up what's essentially a small pizza with no sauce. And ""small"" was the word of the night at our table. Each dish offered only a few bites. Tapas are made for sharing. Good luck coming here with a group looking to take a bite of everything - no passed plate will get past the second or third person. When I hear ""grilled zucchini, eggplant and manchego,"" (""escalivada"" on the menu), I expect rustic vegetables with an enticing smoky flavor and some melted cheese. What I got instead was a tiny portion of grilled-then-chilled (?!) vegetables topped with an awkward foam. The dish was 180 degrees from my expectations. Imagine Mom's grilled vegetable salad left out on the kitchen counter too long. The ""pato confitado"" (duck confit) was another standout for me - the duck was well cooked and the asparagus was bright and tasty. However, even though I ordered the smaller tapa portion, I expected it to be more than a few bites. Portion size is a definite issue at Eivissa.  The only ""large plate"" we ordered was the ""bogavante a la vizcaya"" - lobster in a garlic mojo, saffron potatoes and crisp pork belly. This dish went two-for-three. Despite a lobster that was smaller than some cocktail shrimp, it was cooked perfectly and the garlic mojo was delicious. The comparatively generous portion of saffron potatoes was a welcome complement. The missing piece, literally, was the pork belly. It was nowhere to be found on the plate! At first, our server (with the best of intentions) tried to explain that the pork belly was ""in there"" with the potatoes - that some of the cubes were potato, and others were pork. We were not accepting this explanation, as we have the ability to tell spud from pig. So she went back to ask the kitchen. While gone, a manager happened to stop by. He asked how we liked everything, and we told him of the case of the missing pork belly. He disappeared instantly and returned with something on a stick. I'm not sure what it was, to be honest. I took a small bite of it, and thought it tasted a bit like a cold, greasy, too-fatty chicken nugget. GROSS. And definitely not crispy pork belly. That was the end for us. Our server returned and offered a round of drinks on the house, but by that time we had enough of Eivissa. I think they have some great ideas going on, but for now their execution and portion-size issues will keep me away. Many other tapas restaurants in the city offer tastier (if not as adventurous) food and better value.",0.9987,0.772,0.166,0.063,0.5081984814127669
2009-05-29,3.0,"In the spirit of its namesake/Ibiza, Eivissa was hopping on a Thursday night. It's a more colorful spin on tapas, in the vein of Mercat a la Planxa. While Mercat is superior, this spot is more then worth checking out.   The pinxtos are a perfect start, go for the seafood one. The chef transformed the traditional, typically blah gambas al ajillo into an explosion of flavor. Had the barramundi entrée, semi-solid without blowing us away.  Our loud-talker server was persistently present and helpful, and he didn't pussyfoot around our annoying drink demands that usually go ignored.",0.8166,0.806,0.133,0.061,0.5272727272727273
2009-05-29,4.0,"Eivissa was the perfect venue for a recent girls' night out.  Giant, unique and delicious pitchers of sangria with names (and effects) like Amnesia?  Yes please!  Staff who didn't mind when we hung around drinking and chatting for more than an hour after getting our check?  Yes please!  Small, tasty plates just begging to be passed around and shared?  Yes again! The restaurant space manages to be both expansive (it's deep but not wide with two floors) and intimate at the same time.  Decor is classy with muted overall colors and bright pops of accent color here and there.  We sat upstairs at a combination booth/table with plenty of room and ledges to put our purses (love that!), but the bar scene on the first floor was hopping all evening long.  The drinks were my favorite part of the night and we didn't even get past the sangria to the ""sangriatinis.""  Highly recommended- the lavender/St. Germain sangria (Presecco, maybe?) and the aforementioned Amnesia, which comes with a special secret ingredient- lots and lots of brandy. Not for the lightweights!  The sangria list itself has about 8 different options of white, red and rose-based concoctions- gotta love the variety. The food was good, but it's not the most vegetarian-friendly place in Chicago.  An exception was the large assortment of Spanish cheeses, which we definitely took advantage of.  Veggie dishes we tried included vegetarian pinxtos (toasted bread piled hiiiigh with mushrooms and cheese foam), the grilled asparagus and the artichoke hearts.  Asparagus for the win!  Other ladies at the table raved about the calamari and white beans and the roasted baby octopus.  We tried two of the desserts- there was no dessert menu, just a list from the waiter, but I'm not sure if this will change as the restaurant is open for longer.  The chocolate creme brulee was served cold and without a really crispy topping, but the taste was good.  We questioned whether our fried plantains were really plantains or just unripe bananas, but we finished the whole thing anyway.  The paella came highly recommended from the server, but we didn't try it this evening. The only minor wrinkles of the whole evening were menu-related, and probably also related to the restaurant being really new.  Eivissa was out of a couple menu items we wanted to try.  Our server was super-friendly but didn't seem to have the menu items down yet and occasionally gave inaccurate information.  The biggest issue, personally, was a total unwillingness to do any sort of customization- they were out of one kind of meat, but they wouldn't subsitute another kind to make the same pinxtos, and they wouldn't make vegetarian modifications to another dish.  Not sure how this would play out for someone with food allergies or really specific dietary needs.",0.9954,0.849,0.133,0.018,0.49051834130781485
2009-05-27,4.0,"I had some friends from LA visiting and we went as a small group to Eivissa. The atmosphere was great. Sangriatini's were amazing. Service was pretty good. We had an extremely entertaining waiter. He added spanish flair to every dish delivery. Had some trouble with getting our bill (took nearly 40 mins). Food was pretty good (not the best tapas in town) and somewhat overpriced, but I would still go back. Definitely great for small groups or happy hour.",0.9837,0.637,0.344,0.019,0.5625
2009-05-20,4.0,"Well played... extremely well played Eivissa! I got to check out this new Old Town Spanish Tapas restaurant on ""Friends and Family"" night, prior to their official opening (the night before actually). For a restaurant that isn't even open yet, Eivissa had an extremely friendly, polite and coordinated staff.  A lot of new restaurants are a hot mess in the service department when they're new, but the service was the stand out part of the experience.  They have an awesome drink selection, and the bartender Tony is more than willing to make a special concoction for you based on your flavor pallet.  How many places in Chicago are going to mix up a tasty unique beverage based on your preferences?  Well now, there's one, Eivissa.  Pretty darn cool, if you ask me! I got to chat with one of the owners, Fred, and this is his group's first foray into the fine dining market.  Fine it was, and beautifully decorated.  If you want to impress someone, the sleek modern (but not tacky or overdone) decor will definitely do the trick. Now on to the meat and potatoes... how is the food?  Any foodie (such has myself) or former San Franciscan (myself also included) has probably tried the gamut of tapas restaurants, and Eivissa had the standard fare that you would expect.  The quiche thing, lots and lots and LOTS of seafood, croquettes, etc.  While nothing on the menu (and the one I saw was just a preview) stood out to me, everything I tasted  was delicious and presented beautifully.  And I tried quite a few items (including a mushroom bread thing, duck, lamb chops, salmon, croquettes), I highly recommend the grilled shrimp tapas.  It was one of the best tapas dishes I've ever had.  Ever.  Period.  I'd go back just for that. Again, I think the menu could be a lot more expansive, but since I only saw the ""preview"" menu, I'm excited to see what the team there has coming.  You can expect amazing service, high quality food and ingredients, and overall enjoyable dining experience!",0.9976,0.786,0.206,0.008,0.5124618635332922
2009-05-20,4.0,"Went for the soft opening of Eivissa.    They provided a glass of complimentary sangria, duck pinxtos, and the bill was 50% off which was a huge plus.   The tapas had a flare of molecular gastronomy with hints of French technique.  One thing I have to say is that Eivissa really knows how to cook pork!  The cerdo secreto was just excellent including the sweet potatoes.   Jamon serrano was mediocre in my book.  It came with 3 slices of jamon, two pieces of bread, some olives, nuts.  But I've had better in Barcelona.   The paella valencia with chicken, sausage, and pork was too salty and undercooked.  They rushed the dish because even the waitress said it came out earlier than expected.  This was our least favorite dish of the night.  Sadly enough, I liked the paella at Sangria much more which is such as shame.   But once again the pork in the paella was maravilloso.   The herb rack of lamb was nicely done.  However, I was only able to cut two small bite sized morsels off the rack, and the bone did not have enough to even chew.  Also I'm not too sure if I fully agreed with the reduction sauce, maybe too sweet perhaps.  The quince ravioli had a really subtle taste and a very interesting texture.  Almost like asian fruit jello. The barramundi was cooked nicely as well.  But I still have to question the portion size.  The fish was 2.5 x 4 inch piece with a few scattered vegetables and regularly it was $20.    This was our second favorite dish, but I don't think I would pay $20 for it.   The duck confit was agreeable, but the sliced pork hidden underneath the leg stole the show.  I believe the confit was supposed to be accompanied with sweet potato, but instead we got pork loin.  A-ok with me though. Since they still haven't officially opened yet, they still have some kinks to work out and it is too early to give an accurate rating.  But, if I do come back, I'm definitely coming back for the pork dishes.  Since we received complimentary items, the bill was half off, and I was amazed with the pork, I'm gonna give it four stars for today's experience.  If I had this same experience maybe 3 months from now at $74, then I would give it a 2.5 to 3 stars.  Eivissa is definitely one the most skillful and cutting edge Tapas restaurant I've been.",0.9861,0.85,0.116,0.034,0.5249814195466369
