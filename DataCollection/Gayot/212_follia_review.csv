We were seated promptly at our reserved table but our server was slow to show up and service remained slow for the rest of the evening. We tried the four cheese pizza (which was the only really good thing on the menu), the risotto, and the halibut.

I ordered the special, butternut squash ravioli (always a winner), and my date got another type of ravioli, I think stuffed with spinach and something else. Both were superb. Like a good waiter, he checked back on us just a couple minutes after serving us with our entrees (really - as a note to waiters elsewhere - what's the point of asking how something is 15 minutes after serving it?). For dessert we split the chocolate cake which was both decadent and delicious. It took a little while but when it came out it was clearly fresh from the oven, so I'll forgive them.

First point off for the location--it's not a pleasant or appetizing walk through the fish-scented streets of this west-side warehouse district. Regardless, the food probably warrants the adventure at least once. Half a point off for the prices--probably $2-4 too pricey for the pizza and about $5 too expensive for the main courses.

So we have friends in town from CA this weekend. This is their second time visiting Chicago, and the one place they wanted to go back to from their first visit was Follia.  They brought really special bottle of wine--a 2002 Shafer Hillside Select--with them from CA specifically to enjoy with Follia's pizza.  So we decanted it at home yesterday afternoon, filled the bottle back up and made our way to Follia for our much-anticipated dinner. As Bruno was seating us, he tells us we can't bring our wine in. Not because they have a policy of not allowing corkage, but because his restaurant is Italian and he only allows Italian wines. When we tried to explain that we planned to buy at least one other bottle of wine (there were 5 of us in the party) it didn't matter to him.  ""Trust me, I've been doing this a long time,"" he said.   We then explained that our friends were here from CA, this was a special bottle of wine they brought with them from CA to enjoy specifically with this meal. It just didn't matter to him. We left and went to Machello and had a great meal. We won't be back to Follia. What a bummer, because the food is incredible.

The gnocchi was cooked perfectly--though nothing has ever beaten the gnocchi at Fillipo's. The decorations / ambiance / acoustics were great, as well.",0.9592,0.659,0.341,0.0,0.525
2007-02-27,4.0,"I was always reluctant to go here based on numerous bad reviews about service and how stuffy it is, but one day I was walking by and it was busy and had a great atmosphere.......and I thought I need to go to see for myself!   I loved it, I had the complete opposite experience of anything I had read.  When I walked in I felt I was somewhere else other than Chicago (probably Italy!), it is such a hidden little gem, the space is truly amazing. It reminds me of a NYC  rest.in  the meatpacking district, so unassuming and then you walk in and it transforms you! The food is fresh and I love their thin crust pizzas (truly amazing, yum.)..    We had to wait a few minutes for our table one time and while we waited they let us try wine at the bar on them AND at the end of the dinner they brought us each a glass of dessert wine complimentary just because!! I love those small touches, it really makes for such a great experience...and it appears everytime I go, they do something like that! This place is top notch -it is one of my fav's to bring friends for the food, atmosphere and experience!! Huge fan!!",0.9969,0.715,0.27,0.015,0.5329999999999999
2007-01-30,3.0,"God, I hate to carry a grudge...but Bruno Abate still hasn't offered an apology, and thus, 3 stars buddy. We had visited Follia the week it opened and every week for about 9 months, thus creating a unique chef/owner - patron relationship, only to learn Bruno didn't make it happen for a birthday dinner.  Sure it was my birthday, but hell, he offered to host my party (12 in the group total).  8pm reservation equated to a 10:15 seating.  1/2 the party left.  And the bill -- he charged us extra because the reservation was for 12 and only 1/2 our party showed up.  (uh, wait, we were all here until 9:30)... No apology...no coming out to visit, etc.  So, I have concerns.   And the strangest thing is that we see eachother on the street and in the stores around Chicago all the time.   The food is excellent, however.  And I miss it.  His side business (Model Agency) fills the hostess/waiter/waitress roles, and they are nice to look at, indeed.   Best not to plan on anything rigid, and given the small space, make your reservations for 6 or less.",0.9264,0.77,0.143,0.088,0.6465811965811965
2007-01-17,3.0,Ehhh...I wish I had like it more.  The decor is so cool-very meat packing district New York.  Except it's the meat packing district Chicago.  Food was definately fresh and the staff were very involved in greeting the customers.  I just wasn't blown away by anything I ate.   Nor was anyone I dined with.  We all had a good time though.  Caprese salad looked big and yummy and I'll have to go back and try that one.,0.9399,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.35064935064935066
2007-01-07,5.0,"If you are looking for the freshest Italian food served in a contemporary location with informed waitstaff- then Follia is for you.  Located in the Fulton Market district- this restaurant is one of my favs.  From the moment you enter the chic space (don't be confused by the mannequins in the window- the owner supports local fashion designers) you are accommodated in every way.   Instead of ordering off the menu- have the wait staff put together an antipasto platter for your table- it will come with little tastes of delightful antipasto- make sure you ask them to include the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes to the plate.  The oven fired pizzas make an excellent 2nd course- my fav is 1/2 margarita 1/2 ham and arugula- plenty for 4 to share.  And then on to the pastas and entrees.  The pasta specials each day are amazing (if they have it, try the linguine and with red cream sauce and crab and lobster) and there is a pounded veal chop that I have not seen elsewhere in the city.  (watch the veal chop- it is huge- easily could be shared by two!)  For dessert- while not always on the menu- try the white ice cream with espresso poured over the top!  It is amazing.  For wine- they have a nice list of Italian wines and the wait staff is well informed as to what might be a good fit for your menu choices.  And don't forget  a glass of muscatto with dessert.   When finished with dinner- slip through the side door and enjoy a cocktail at the Fulton Lounge which is conveniently located next door.   I have sent many friends here and they all come back saying the same thing , ""it was a great night out"".  Make reservations as it is tough to get in on the weekends!  And watch for ""Bruno"" the owner to be flitting about making sure that everyone's needs are accomodated.",0.9946,0.807,0.178,0.014,0.49593253968253975
2006-12-12,5.0,"It's been a long time since service at a place has left me this smitten. There were 6-7 people bustling around us, never intrusive, perfectly timed, dashing over to grab my coat/pour the pellegrino/wisk away the olive platter etc. The atmosphere at this little West Loop Milanese hot spot couldn't be better. The legend of an owner struts around the place in a plum suit, we spotted him grabbing drinks next to us at Fulton Lounge (which is right next door, no need to go outside) and he is a total charmer.            Prices very doable, entrees $16-$25. Antipasto platter was to die for, specially imported cheeses and an impeccable wine list to match. Ask the very knowledgeable wait staff for recommendations.        Decor is minimalist, cool and trendy, and the astro-turf mounted on the walls is a nice modern touch. Urban intrerior meets quirky  fashion meets great authentic Italian. One of the top restaurants in the city, but please don't spread the secret; grabbing a weekend table is still no problem the night before.",-0.438,0.853,0.068,0.079,0.5021978021978022
2006-12-01,4.0,"Excellent, super authentic Italian food. Everything was very fresh and not drenched in sauce the way most Italian restaurants are. The owner is very friendly and will probably stop by your table and chat with you a bit. It is also pretty reasonably priced. The only thing I thought was a bit off was the decor. The restaurant itself was very stylish and fun but the clothes in the windows and throughout the restaurant were weird. I get that the theme of the restaurant is ""food and fashion"" but most of the clothes I saw were distracting and frankly hideous and just didn't seem to fit in. I would definitely recommend going next door to Fulton Lounge for drinks after dinner. It has a great sexy vibe, althoug a little bit of an older crowd.",0.9689,0.742,0.199,0.06,0.5909090909090909

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - the place is on the smaller side, and sometimes they get really slammed and the service and food is not 100% - I would recommend going here on an off night, but here at follia, there are no off nights and a random tuesday will be just as crowded as a saturday night!",0.8709,0.762,0.167,0.071,0.5064102564102564
